[59:03] that way this morning
[59:04] a many many men and what a time we have
[59:08] been having and what a set of services
[59:11] over the last few Services my mind is
[59:13] completely blown and we ought to be so
[59:15] grateful for God to keeping us tuned in
[59:18] to the his presence and his power and
[59:21] his will and his grace and how God has
[59:22] been using the ministers to bring us
[59:24] into Readiness and we are so appreciated
[59:26] of that by the grace of God so this
[59:30] morning I want to wish a special happy
[59:31] birthday to our precious brother Anthony

[59:47] sister kosher
[59:48] may God richly bless you and continue to
[59:51] use you and from strength to strength
[59:53] and for those who were in the youth
[59:55] service yesterday we had a really
[59:56] tremendous time so I want to salute The
[59:58] Young and the young at heart who were
[1:00:01] present for the Youth service and we had
[1:00:03] a really tremendous time and we are
[1:00:04] looking by the grace of God to have some
[1:00:07] wonderful sessions coming up again so we
[1:00:09] want to encourage those of you who were
[1:00:11] not there to make every effort to be
[1:00:15] there and to be able to grow and
[1:00:17] strengthen one another by the grace of
[1:00:19] God so we are here one more time and as
[1:00:22] you know today
[1:00:23] we have this service after which we'll
[1:00:25] serve lunch and then this evening we can
[1:00:28] have a time of Praise on worship and
[1:00:30] spending time in the presence of the
[1:00:32] Lord and when you really look at how
[1:00:34] much time we have in the week we really
[1:00:36] don't give enough to the Lord we could
[1:00:38] always give more to the Lord so we want
[1:00:40] to give a little more today and push a
[1:00:42] little extra today and to give him what
[1:00:45] he rightly deserves our lives and not
[1:00:47] our own we belong to him so the least we
[1:00:49] could do is give our all back to him you
[1:00:51] feel that way this morning
[1:00:53] hey man so just for a few uh also
[1:00:55] critical announcements next Sunday uh as
[1:00:59] you know is the first uh of the month so
[1:01:02] we'll have our communion service in the
[1:01:04] evening uh the following Sunday which is
[1:01:07] October 8th I want you to take note uh
[1:01:10] that yarel Tabernacle will be coming up
[1:01:12] to have service with us and uh brother
[1:01:15] yadel you would remember would have
[1:01:16] greeted a convention uh before brother
[1:01:18] robledo preached and it was such a
[1:01:20] tremendous blessing so brother yadel
[1:01:22] will be ministering to us on October the
[1:01:25] 8th so beyond the great expectation to
[1:01:27] be in fellowship with the Tabernacle by
[1:01:29] the Thornhill and the church and uh
[1:01:31] bring your fire so we create an
[1:01:34] atmosphere of fellowship and praise you
[1:01:36] believe that this morning you're on the
[1:01:37] expectation for what God is doing
[1:01:39] wonderful so just before I get into the
[1:01:42] message I was reading this quote and
[1:01:44] this quote really blessed me from the
[1:01:46] message here em and brother Madam said
[1:01:48] what we need today is a real genuine
[1:01:51] cleaned up Holy Ghost Field Church
[1:01:54] packed up with the Holy Ghost and he
[1:01:57] says Ready filled and unctionized with
[1:02:00] God's holy spirit so the prophet said
[1:02:02] this to that word unctionized becomes a
[1:02:04] word right there
[1:02:05] can I read it one more time he said what
[1:02:07] we need today is a real genuine cleaned
[1:02:11] up Holy Ghost Field Church packed up
[1:02:14] with the Holy Ghost ready filled and
[1:02:17] unctionized with God's holy spirit yes
[1:02:19] sir I believe that he said if we fail to
[1:02:22] preach it God will raise up the Baptist
[1:02:25] or Presbyterians or somebody to do it he
[1:02:28] certainly will because he is going to
[1:02:30] have a church there without spot or
[1:02:33] wrinkle and he says yeah he will do it
[1:02:35] so it's not me to do it it's not you to
[1:02:38] do it he said he will do it he will
[1:02:40] bring it to pass if that doesn't make
[1:02:42] you happy to know that he promised to do
[1:02:45] it and he is going to fulfill it he is
[1:02:48] going to raise up he is going to deliver
[1:02:50] he is going to baptize he's going to
[1:02:52] call from the east from the west from
[1:02:54] the north from the south he's going to
[1:02:56] straighten out he's going to shape oh
[1:02:58] Hallelujah so whether Bradham goes on he
[1:03:01] said so brethren let's just shake
[1:03:04] ourselves and rise out of the Dust oh
[1:03:07] sometimes we find ourselves in the dust
[1:03:08] sometimes we find ourselves in the ash
[1:03:10] heat sometimes we find ourselves feeling
[1:03:12] all kind of different ways and when the
[1:03:14] Branham is seeing that in the spiritual
[1:03:16] realm he says let's shake ourselves oh
[1:03:19] and rise out of the dust and Shake
[1:03:22] ourselves he says he says it again and
[1:03:24] get in the ground All gospel way and
[1:03:27] March up the highway that's the only
[1:03:29] thing to do is Onward Christian Soldiers
[1:03:32] he says he had no time to slack or be
[1:03:35] easy now let's start going for the
[1:03:38] kingdom of God oh
[1:03:43] no time to slap the slack no time to
[1:03:45] give up a Holy Ghost Church a holy ghost
[1:03:48] filled Church washed in the blood of the
[1:03:50] Lamb can the church see amen
[1:03:53] so I have a title this morning God will
[1:03:56] always have a witness can the church say
[1:04:00] amen God will always have a witness you
[1:04:03] believe that throughout every age I
[1:04:05] don't matter how tough it gets I don't
[1:04:07] matter how bad it gets him I don't
[1:04:09] matter what the devil is doing I don't
[1:04:11] matter what takes place brother Branham
[1:04:12] said one day the message itself will
[1:04:14] look defeated but God will always have a
[1:04:17] witness oh Hallelujah he's gonna find
[1:04:21] somebody somewhere in every single age
[1:04:23] he do he did it this age is going to be
[1:04:25] no different and for a subject what we
[1:04:29] have seen happen should put every soul
[1:04:31] into action oh you know the quote what
[1:04:34] we have seen happen should put every
[1:04:36] soul into action and my inspiration is a
[1:04:39] question what kind of witness are you oh
[1:04:43] hallelujah hallelujah what kind of
[1:04:45] witness are you you know I was driving
[1:04:47] up to church this morning and I was
[1:04:49] saying to my wife the ten lepers they
[1:04:52] saw something they met Jesus you know
[1:04:55] what it is to meet Jesus and have Jesus
[1:04:57] talk to you and minister to your need
[1:04:59] but these ten lepers met Jesus didn't
[1:05:02] meet a preacher didn't meet an
[1:05:04] evangelist did he admit a message person
[1:05:06] with a Booker they met Jesus and they
[1:05:09] were looking to find some kind of relief
[1:05:11] and Jesus said go show yourself to the
[1:05:13] priest and while they were obedient to
[1:05:16] the voice of the master while they were
[1:05:18] just walking under the instructions of
[1:05:21] the master healing met them on the road
[1:05:24] and they were all healed up they were
[1:05:26] all Witnesses of the healing but you
[1:05:29] know something only one of them came
[1:05:31] back to give worship and it made me
[1:05:34] realize many people will see many things
[1:05:37] many will experience many things but
[1:05:40] only few will come back to worship only
[1:05:43] few will give God praise only few oh
[1:05:47] come on now somebody say Amen
[1:05:50] what kind of witness are you God will
[1:05:53] always have a witness because the
[1:05:55] witness means to testify or something to
[1:05:57] witness means you can't sit still if God
[1:06:00] did something for you because the Bible
[1:06:02] said they overcame by the blood of the
[1:06:04] lamb and the word of their testimony
[1:06:06] you've got to have a testimony you've
[1:06:09] got to have a voice of what God did for
[1:06:12] you oh Hallelujah do you know overcoming
[1:06:15] is title you are testifying
[1:06:19] that's why but the Branham said if you
[1:06:21] don't testify about this thing you're
[1:06:24] gonna find yourself back sleeping one
[1:06:25] day you've got to tell somebody they
[1:06:28] might call you crazy but you at least
[1:06:30] got to say God is good at least you
[1:06:32] gotta say his Mercy endure it forever
[1:06:34] you at least you gotta say I've never
[1:06:37] seen the righteous forsaken at least you
[1:06:40] gotta say he saved me at least you gotta
[1:06:43] see this message found me at least you
[1:06:45] could say I didn't do nothing on my own
[1:06:47] but goodness and mercy follows me all
[1:06:50] the days of my life oh do you have a
[1:06:53] reason to testify this morning did he do
[1:06:56] anything for you has he been keeping you
[1:06:58] has he raised you up Hallelujah you
[1:07:02] should have been dead but here you are
[1:07:03] in the house of God you should have been
[1:07:06] somewhere else but grace and mercy
[1:07:10] God will always have a witness it's
[1:07:16] God's business to have witnesses he
[1:07:18] loves to take a witness and and shake it
[1:07:21] in the face of the devil he said there's
[1:07:23] no one like job oh
[1:07:26] search the Earth such high search low I
[1:07:29] can boast about this man called Joba I
[1:07:32] have a witness on the earth and there's
[1:07:34] nobody like him in the days of Noah
[1:07:36] there's nobody like Noah on the face of
[1:07:39] the hilltop God will always have a
[1:07:41] witness in Noah's day it was sin
[1:07:44] everywhere but Noah was God's witness
[1:07:46] what about our day this morning

[1:11:41] the passionate they can't wait
[1:11:44] iniminating it if I call somebody and
[1:11:46] you see that
[1:11:47] you see what just you see how he catch
[1:11:49] him
[1:11:52] that's a kind of excitement
[1:11:54] like a woman at the at the well when she
[1:11:56] met Jesus she comes here man
[1:12:00] you couldn't keep her quiet about it she
[1:12:03] went to the well many times before but
[1:12:06] this time she left you well different
[1:12:07] she said come see a man who told me all
[1:12:10] about me I've never been this way before
[1:12:13] she was excited
[1:12:17] she experienced something she didn't
[1:12:19] hear about it you know it was her
[1:12:21] experience and because she experienced
[1:12:24] it she could get a certain kind of
[1:12:25] excitement about it that's why I always
[1:12:28] know when somebody have an experience
[1:12:29] with God
[1:12:33] but Ibraham said it makes you act
[1:12:35] unseemly
[1:12:40] it makes you act out a character
[1:12:43] it makes you act a little crazy
[1:12:46] because you know he wasn't that way
[1:12:47] before but all of a sudden something
[1:12:49] happened and then you can't help
[1:12:51] yourself you're spinning wrong you're
[1:12:52] dancing you're bouncing your bills still
[1:12:55] happy but you're happy you know you have
[1:12:57] problems to deal with but you're not
[1:12:59] resting on the problem you're resting on
[1:13:01] the Promises of God and the church amen
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:06] [Applause]
[1:13:11] it's a joy it's a peace it's a comfort
[1:13:13] that comes from having an experience and
[1:13:17] that's what we need we need experiences
[1:13:19] with God
[1:13:21] not just one experience experiences with
[1:13:24] God
[1:13:25] [Applause]
[1:13:28] because when you have an experience with
[1:13:31] God
[1:13:32] nobody could shake you you know
[1:13:34] because you know you met God you know
[1:13:37] you experience God you know God did
[1:13:39] something for you
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:42] somebody that's got backslide somebody
[1:13:43] to do this but you you are unshakable
[1:13:45] not that you wouldn't have moments when
[1:13:47] you feel them low David at all kind of
[1:13:50] encounters I mean say Lord create me a
[1:13:51] clean heart restore unto me the joy of
[1:13:54] my salvation
[1:13:59] he went back to his Source every time he
[1:14:01] said Lord many are there that increase
[1:14:03] that trouble me many a day you could see
[1:14:06] going through something but he's still
[1:14:07] going back to his Source many a day that
[1:14:09] say of my soul is no help for him in God
[1:14:12] but but John oh Lord he keep looking
[1:14:15] back to his God because that's who he
[1:14:17] had the experience with
[1:14:18] [Applause]
[1:14:22] remember the seven
[1:14:24] when he experiences at God your job
[1:14:27] can't shake your your neighbors can't
[1:14:29] shake your the government can't shake
[1:14:30] your the economy can't shake your
[1:14:32] nothing could shake here because you

[1:14:40] he is Jehovah Nissi he is a way maker he
[1:14:43] is a restorer

[1:15:10] I'm trying to encourage you to get into
[1:15:12] a relationship with God so you lean on
[1:15:15] him lean not on your own understanding

[1:15:24] in your job by yourself and all hell
[1:15:25] against you the person are there with
[1:15:27] you

[1:15:37] give me the Comfort he could give any
[1:15:39] confidence to give it his strength to
[1:15:41] stand he can tell you square your
[1:15:43] shoulders back lift your head up as he
[1:15:45] caught you red but the man said Shake
[1:15:46] Yourself come under the dust guard your
[1:15:49] loins like a man I am with you
[1:15:58] God's Great desire was to move from God
[1:16:01] above them to God with them to God in
[1:16:05] them so you're never walking alone
[1:16:07] you're walking with God on the inside
[1:16:09] inside he's sitting on the controlled
[1:16:12] power of your heart Seated on your
[1:16:14] throne
[1:16:15] can the church see amen can we give the
[1:16:18] Lord a shout out praise
[1:16:25] God
[1:16:27] will always
[1:16:28] have a witness
[1:16:30] it could be one it could be two it could
[1:16:32] be five it could be ten but he will
[1:16:34] always have a witness
[1:16:42] what we see hasn't impact in our lives
[1:16:46] I was sharing with you on people
[1:16:47] yesterday your environment has a lot to
[1:16:50] do with where you achieve and what you

[1:16:55] spend your time with people who do not
[1:16:57] do want to save
[1:16:59] and spending their money foolish
[1:17:01] because you will gravitate just like

[1:25:08] [Applause]
[1:25:12] can the church
[1:25:14] Say Amen
[1:25:18] God
[1:25:20] will always
[1:25:22] have a witness
[1:25:24] what we witness what we experience has
[1:25:28] an undeniable impact on our lives that
[1:25:31] is why young people it is so important
[1:25:33] to God what you watch
[1:25:38] God what you see
[1:25:40] God what you listen to God your heart
[1:25:44] for out of it comes all the issues of
[1:25:47] life
[1:25:48] [Applause]
[1:25:56] got it defend it protect it protect your
[1:26:00] eyes protect your ears
[1:26:03] some rules you're not supposed to drive
[1:26:05] down there are shady places you're not
[1:26:07] supposed to go
[1:26:10] and nobody could tell me when they start
[1:26:12] to drive down the wrong road they didn't
[1:26:14] feel something telling them this is
[1:26:16] wrong you know
[1:26:19] because your conscience was given to you
[1:26:22] as a flashing red light a warning
[1:26:26] you know in your heart this is this is
[1:26:28] this is not right
[1:26:31] and that's why the prophet taught us if
[1:26:33] there's a question about something
[1:26:36] leave it alone
[1:26:38] don't do it run for your life your soul
[1:26:42] is too important
[1:26:46] we are way up the road now it's not the
[1:26:48] time for playing games is there any type
[1:26:50] of play in church anytime the backslide
[1:26:51] is any type to experiment with the world
[1:26:57] what we see what we experience helps to
[1:27:00] shape Our Lives
[1:27:02] I challenge young people yesterday you
[1:27:04] who grew up in church grew up in your
[1:27:06] message you should be so grateful to God
[1:27:09] for your parents
[1:27:12] so thankful to God
[1:27:14] listen you have to accept the reality
[1:27:15] there's not everything you're going to
[1:27:17] agree with agree with your parents you
[1:27:19] are an individual but it doesn't take
[1:27:21] away from the fact that the Bible said
[1:27:22] honor them
[1:27:24] honor is beyond obedience
[1:27:27] not just obey but honor
[1:27:30] give them honor
[1:27:32] give them respect
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:36] salute them cherish them reference them
[1:27:38] respect them that's what honor means
[1:27:40] people want to honor the president the
[1:27:42] Prime Minister a dignitaries honor your
[1:27:44] parents
[1:27:47] [Music]
[1:27:49] [Applause]
[1:27:52] this is why it's so important to be
[1:27:54] conscious of where you go what you do
[1:27:57] who you spend time with
[1:27:59] you come to a service like this but all
[1:28:01] week is spending time in the things of
[1:28:03] the world you're not going to grow
[1:28:04] friends
[1:28:05] you have to want it you have to make a
[1:28:08] choice to be a Christian when nobody
[1:28:10] else is around it has nothing to do with
[1:28:12] them pressing nobody I want to be an
[1:28:14] individual in God
[1:28:16] [Applause]
[1:28:18] can the Church Say Amen
[1:28:22] God will always have a witness
[1:28:25] why does
[1:28:26] God need Witnesses
[1:28:29] and I share this in Germany
[1:28:31] in August God is a spirit
[1:28:34] God is a mystery and in order for God to
[1:28:37] fulfill his Divine Purpose to reveal
[1:28:40] himself in this Earthly Dimension he
[1:28:43] uses Witnesses
[1:28:44] and by the testimony of these Witnesses
[1:28:47] we could get a glimpse of the power of
[1:28:51] God the nature of God the desires of God
[1:28:54] the intent of God without the ability to
[1:28:57] interact with Witnesses we wouldn't
[1:28:59] really understand what God is trying to
[1:29:01] do
[1:29:03] could you imagine if everyone who had an
[1:29:06] encounter with God never said anything
[1:29:07] about it
[1:29:11] Joshua was there waiting and and and he
[1:29:13] heard a Russell and he joined so he said
[1:29:15] are you false against us it was Joshua
[1:29:18] and the captain he was alone
[1:29:20] there was no Paparazzi there
[1:29:23] if Joshua never told anybody about it we
[1:29:25] wouldn't know about it
[1:29:27] when Moses went to the burning bush
[1:29:28] nobody else was there
[1:29:30] if Moses didn't tell us what happened
[1:29:32] but upon you wouldn't know what happened
[1:29:34] when David was really lying and you
[1:29:36] overcome the lion he was there was
[1:29:38] nobody else there but
[1:29:39] he come and tell us about it when he was
[1:29:42] having a beer it was him and he beer
[1:29:44] [Applause]
[1:29:49] the Lord delivered me
[1:29:52] that's how we know about it and I want
[1:29:55] to know what the Lord doing for you
[1:29:56] because you can't be here this morning
[1:29:58] if the Lord is doing something for you
[1:30:02] can the Church Say Amen
[1:30:06] and it's in little things you know
[1:30:10] if all the witnesses stayed silent
[1:30:13] throughout all the ages we would know
[1:30:14] nothing about Abraham
[1:30:18] if nobody talked about it we would know
[1:30:20] about it we will know nothing but Noah
[1:30:23] we will know nothing but Moses that will
[1:30:25] just be lost somewhere in history we
[1:30:27] will know nothing about Joshua David but
[1:30:29] when these Witnesses understood what
[1:30:32] they saw
[1:30:33] understood what they experienced they
[1:30:35] couldn't stay quiet about it
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:38] can the Church Say Amen and these
[1:30:41] Witnesses were not accidental Witnesses
[1:30:43] God waited until Abraham was born
[1:30:46] because he was looking to be a father
[1:30:48] and he had to wait until he had the
[1:30:50] right witness in position to display his
[1:30:53] attribute of being a father
[1:30:55] oh you don't hear me this morning and by
[1:30:57] the time God was finished with Abraham
[1:30:59] Abraham could testify that I am a
[1:31:02] witness that he is Jehovah Jireh
[1:31:04] come on now somebody preached back to me
[1:31:08] and the story of that witness and the
[1:31:10] testimony of that witness still lives
[1:31:12] today
[1:31:13] Abraham was a true witness he was a
[1:31:16] faithful witness and throughout all the
[1:31:19] ages there were many witnesses
[1:31:24] Say Amen
[1:31:27] when it looks like nobody would stand
[1:31:29] God will find a witness look at Gideon
[1:31:31] the people hiding in the caves
[1:31:34] everything in media nights come they go
[1:31:36] and hide in the cave
[1:31:37] yeah
[1:31:40] Hayden
[1:31:43] trying to do hiding on your Mighty Man
[1:31:46] of Allah
[1:31:47] you didn't know anything about that he
[1:31:49] looking wrong to see if you're talking
[1:31:50] about some other Gideon
[1:31:52] I think he didn't have all his excuse
[1:31:54] I'm the least in my family my family's
[1:31:56] the least family any child he's at least
[1:31:58] tribe of all the tribes but callers
[1:32:00] looking for witness and in every age you
[1:32:02] need dark is age he found Luther
[1:32:06] one man
[1:32:07] stood against the Catholic church in the
[1:32:09] darkness he found Wesley in the darkness
[1:32:11] he found some Bible believe in
[1:32:13] Pentecostals was a Street Revival in the
[1:32:16] darkness of this world oh come on now he
[1:32:18] found a prophet
[1:32:19] please the prophet as a true Witness
[1:32:24] so that the son of man could be filled
[1:32:26] in a son of man to be a witness that
[1:32:29] Jesus is coming soon and he's coming for
[1:32:31] a bride
[1:32:33] and that bribe will also be a witness
[1:32:35] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:32:37] forever that bride will be a witness of
[1:32:40] the outpouring of the Holy Ghost that
[1:32:42] wide will be a witness of seeing a super
[1:32:45] Church
[1:32:46] come into manifestation she will be a
[1:32:49] witness of seeing a super race coming to
[1:32:51] the manifestation
[1:32:52] [Applause]
[1:32:54] somebody give what a shout out praise
[1:32:58] could you take some more
[1:33:06] [Music]
[1:33:08] but a troubling part of this friends
[1:33:11] is like with the lepers who witnessed
[1:33:14] Jesus many witnessed what God did in
[1:33:17] Egypt to them
[1:33:19] but only Joshua and Caleb
[1:33:22] made it to the promised land
[1:33:26] many witnessed Jesus performing Miracles
[1:33:29] you know you remember how much was there
[1:33:30] for defeated early the five thousand
[1:33:32] with the Loaves and Fishes
[1:33:34] five thousand
[1:33:38] I'm only 120 megade Upper Room
[1:33:42] so where was the other where was the
[1:33:44] rest of them
[1:33:46] but a punch these were Witnesses they
[1:33:48] all went home and say I was there when I
[1:33:51] saw Jesus take the lobes on the fishes
[1:33:52] what a service that was I tell you I've
[1:33:54] never been a series like that to it
[1:33:57] so it's not about how long you're in
[1:33:58] church what you see what you experience
[1:34:00] you know is what kind of witness are you
[1:34:03] because out of all of them bridging who
[1:34:06] was there good to see you brother Jaden
[1:34:08] God bless you
[1:34:10] or to all of them who was there
[1:34:12] only 120 make it to the upper room
[1:34:15] so what was different about this 120
[1:34:20] people said uncomfortable in church come
[1:34:22] to any message well I have books I have
[1:34:24] tapes these Believers were in Jesus
[1:34:25] service not my service
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:31] sister olivery they heard Jesus minister
[1:34:35] they experience five notes which is many
[1:34:37] were there for different Miracles but
[1:34:39] out of all those people
[1:34:42] only 120 make it to the upper room
[1:34:45] why they didn't show up
[1:34:50] you ever wonder about that all those
[1:34:52] left Egypt
[1:34:54] they saw the Miracles
[1:34:57] but when it come down to going there
[1:35:00] when Moses forgetting Ten Commandments
[1:35:02] they're making Graven image
[1:35:14] they left Egypt or Egypt was still there
[1:35:16] so what it teaches us experiences and
[1:35:18] witness and don't take all the Egypt in
[1:35:19] your heart to know
[1:35:25] by type they would have put Blood on the
[1:35:27] door and thing and and leave Egypt and
[1:35:29] we go into the Promised Land
[1:35:33] that's what they left Egypt
[1:35:36] and they all even we're going to make it
[1:35:37] see you over Yonder Over Yonder
[1:35:45] and after that whole group
[1:35:49] two
[1:35:54] no that kind of thing brother Jason the
[1:35:57] shake me to my core
[1:36:01] because I know I do have Moses Ministry
[1:36:05] I don't have Jesus ministry
[1:36:07] and if their Ministries couldn't keep
[1:36:10] everybody
[1:36:16] I told young people yesterday but
[1:36:18] Ibraham said he could preach it a bloody
[1:36:19] face
[1:36:20] until it is inspired to you to do what
[1:36:23] it takes to make your calling an
[1:36:25] election show
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:30] God will always have a witness and the
[1:36:33] question is what kind of witness are you
[1:36:34] and if something is what we have seen
[1:36:37] happen should the operative order should
[1:36:40] put our souls in the action it should do
[1:36:44] it
[1:36:46] and the fact that but I don't put the
[1:36:48] word should there means it it'll do it
[1:36:51] for some
[1:36:53] it should do it but there'll be those
[1:36:55] who sit along in church will I any
[1:36:57] message I I could I I I I believe
[1:37:02] but you are doing the praying yeah do
[1:37:04] any sacrifice yeah yeah they're they're

[1:38:10] you are the problem I am the problem we
[1:38:12] are the problem Lord shape me Maul me
[1:38:15] what we have seen happen should put our
[1:38:18] souls into action to make a church that
[1:38:20] will make a Revival
[1:38:24] anybody with me it has to be a change of
[1:38:27] behavior it has to be a desire what we
[1:38:29] see happen should make us want to be in

[1:40:31] what kind of witness are you
[1:40:39] what we see should bring a change in our
[1:40:41] lives
[1:40:43] the Bible speaks about Isaiah leaning on
[1:40:45] King Uzziah
[1:40:51] Isaiah was a priest he was a prophet
[1:40:55] and when Uzziah died
[1:40:57] and he went to the temple
[1:41:00] and when he said I saw the Lord
[1:41:02] and when he came to the presence of God
[1:41:04] he experienced something that made him
[1:41:06] trembling made him shake and make him
[1:41:09] realize as he got closer to the presence
[1:41:11] of God he started to see things he never
[1:41:12] saw about himself
[1:41:15] and he came to a point said why is me
[1:41:19] I'm a man of unclean lips and that's a
[1:41:21] prophet
[1:41:25] that his experiences Sister Paulina to
[1:41:28] push him to a place to have a different
[1:41:30] kind of experience
[1:41:32] a personal experience to say Lord I have
[1:41:34] some issues in my life I need to change
[1:41:36] he said well it's me I'm I'm undone I'm
[1:41:38] a man of unclean lips
[1:41:42] I have some issues to fix he wasn't
[1:41:44] embarrassed he said I'm a prophet I'm a
[1:41:46] priest I really don't want to say it and
[1:41:48] I'll put it in words that I have issues
[1:41:51] I said technicals cleanse my lips here I
[1:41:55] am I don't want to go back home the same
[1:41:57] way that I came and experience and make
[1:42:00] you want to get a change
[1:42:04] [Applause]
[1:42:07] some of us come to the presence of God
[1:42:09] and you know you have things to make
[1:42:11] right but you want to go back home
[1:42:12] because you don't want anybody see you
[1:42:13] at the altar you don't want nobody see
[1:42:15] you're crying you're the one really
[1:42:16] think you have some stuff going on well
[1:42:18] I've got news here I have stuff going on
[1:42:20] [Applause]
[1:42:28] if God could tell the prophet of God you
[1:42:30] need to be more sincere
[1:42:32] who are you who am I
[1:42:34] God could tell the man of God on the
[1:42:37] Earth has tiny right hand of God there
[1:42:39] was no man on the earth like the prophet
[1:42:42] after the Lord Jesus Christ and he can
[1:42:44] look at that man and say you need to be
[1:42:46] more sincere
[1:42:52] [Applause]
[1:42:58] I need to be more sincere we need to be
[1:43:01] more sincere we need to be more
[1:43:03] consecrated we need to be more dedicated
[1:43:06] we need to be more honest and say Lord I
[1:43:10] need our help I need a touch
[1:43:12] and not where I'm supposed to be Lord
[1:43:15] [Applause]
[1:43:17] before Isaiah's encounter he thought he
[1:43:20] was a righteous
[1:43:22] that statement war is me it's like whoa
[1:43:25] whoa whoa
[1:43:28] I didn't realize the light that just
[1:43:30] shown on
[1:43:32] show me some stuff about that and
[1:43:33] realize what's the issue and that's why
[1:43:35] friends God will send experiences your
[1:43:38] way the show things you didn't know was
[1:43:39] there
[1:43:44] he'll shake up your house he'll she 'll
[1:43:46] shake up your family heal shake up your
[1:43:48] job he will shake things up to make you
[1:43:51] uncomfortable
[1:43:52] because it's when you're uncomfortable
[1:43:54] you'll get to see what stuff you're
[1:43:56] really made of
[1:43:57] [Applause]
[1:43:59] because these virtues have to live and
[1:44:02] God has to prove it that it's in you
[1:44:05] and the devil the prophet said will also
[1:44:08] test to see what's in you
[1:44:10] [Applause]
[1:44:14] will you forgive
[1:44:15] will you love
[1:44:18] don't to be very any Prophet is tested
[1:44:19] he's in church preaching the young
[1:44:21] couple making love in church and God
[1:44:24] again gave his Prophet options just like
[1:44:26] he gives us a happy right option God
[1:44:27] will always give you options you know he
[1:44:30] said whatever you say to them will
[1:44:31] happen say blindness to go blind
[1:44:39] God give him Choice A B C D and he
[1:44:42] probably said none of the above I
[1:44:43] forgive you
[1:44:46] none of the above this multiple choice
[1:44:48] is none of the above
[1:44:50] and God said that's the character
[1:44:51] looking for
[1:44:54] that's in nature looking for because I
[1:44:56] could trust you with more power because
[1:44:57] God wants to forgive he's a god of
[1:44:59] judgment he's a god of judgment he's a
[1:45:01] judgment seat but blood makes it a mercy
[1:45:03] seat this morning so there's Mercy For
[1:45:05] You Mercy for me but he's a judge he's a
[1:45:07] righteous judge thank you
[1:45:10] but there's Mercy this morning for your
[1:45:12] soul Mercy for your family that if
[1:45:15] you're living out of the will of God you
[1:45:17] can get black in line with God and mercy
[1:45:20] could minister to you
[1:45:22] [Applause]
[1:45:25] [Music]
[1:45:28] I said it a few weeks ago many of us we
[1:45:30] are so caught up with ourselves we can't
[1:45:32] even see that we're entering into
[1:45:34] somebody else's pain God's way for you
[1:45:36] is through that
[1:45:40] I can look down at nobody
[1:45:44] there's nobody better than anybody in
[1:45:46] the room you know
[1:45:48] we all need a blood
[1:45:51] we all need Mercy we all here by his
[1:45:53] grace
[1:45:58] God cannot choose anybody
[1:46:01] God cannot give anybody to speak he is
[1:46:03] he won't give any gift
[1:46:06] nobody actually if you didn't ask to be
[1:46:08] on the earth you didn't put yourself
[1:46:09] here you had nothing to do with your
[1:46:11] conception you had nothing to do with
[1:46:13] you being here
[1:46:15] you couldn't plan it you couldn't stop
[1:46:17] it
[1:46:19] but God too for knowledge
[1:46:22] he predestinated that you'll be here who
[1:46:26] if only we called who we call it
[1:46:29] Justified and we justify he hath already
[1:46:32] past tense glorified
[1:46:36] we are walking in a story that's been
[1:46:39] already written
[1:46:44] and the devil has no access to the book
[1:46:46] The Devil can read the book he doesn't
[1:46:49] know your name is written it's Written
[1:46:51] in Blood and Jesus said all that the
[1:46:54] father has given me
[1:46:57] they must come they will come no devil
[1:47:01] could stop it your past can't stop it
[1:47:03] your mama can't stop it your papa can't
[1:47:06] stop it the Devil Himself can't stop it
[1:47:08] you belong to God your name is written
[1:47:11] in the Lamb's Book of Life In The Blood
[1:47:14] section you could try to walk away but
[1:47:17] Mercy will always say no
[1:47:20] [Music]
[1:47:24] that's a reason to shout that's the
[1:47:26] reason the praise God he said no weapon
[1:47:29] from against you could ever prosper
[1:47:35] [Music]
[1:47:36] Keep Holding On keep fighting keep
[1:47:40] pressing God is going to work it out
[1:47:42] [Applause]
[1:47:48] come on Church Give the Lord a shout Our
[1:47:51] Praise come on say root this is your
[1:47:53] service this is your time this is your
[1:47:57] season don't let it pass you by
[1:48:03] e yes but Ashby God is going to have a
[1:48:07] witness I want to be a witness I want to
[1:48:11] be a witness are you going to be a
[1:48:13] witness are you going to be a living
[1:48:15] testimony
[1:48:15] [Applause]
[1:48:17] that shakes the devil it's a live voice
[1:48:21] that's the witness that God is looking
[1:48:23] for a lived voice
[1:48:25] [Applause]
[1:48:27] [Music]
[1:48:34] can the Church Say Amen
[1:48:36] Give the Lord a shout out praise
[1:48:38] Give Him worship this morning
[1:48:41] oh Hallelujah
[1:48:42] [Applause]
[1:48:53] could you take some more
[1:48:54] [Applause]
[1:48:59] so Isaiah's experience with God is not
[1:49:02] that he didn't know according to him God
[1:49:04] unspoken then he's a prophet
[1:49:06] but God wants more
[1:49:08] not just more you know he wants all
[1:49:11] he wants everything
[1:49:13] he wants your hands
[1:49:15] he wants your feet he wants your eyes he
[1:49:18] wants your lips he wants your worship he
[1:49:21] wants your commitment he wants your
[1:49:23] passion he wants your energy he wants
[1:49:27] you all he wants you all he wants
[1:49:30] everything
[1:49:31] [Music]
[1:49:33] I told the young people yesterday all
[1:49:36] the things you're looking for in life is
[1:49:38] directly tied to your ability to
[1:49:40] surrender to God
[1:49:41] [Applause]
[1:49:43] you think you want is connected to
[1:49:46] surrender because the more you give up
[1:49:48] and surrender God is is like a pipe I
[1:49:50] give you analogy yesterday's like a pipe
[1:49:53] you ever open a pie that was clogged
[1:49:55] it's not even water not there no but
[1:49:57] there's something blocking me pipe
[1:50:00] but you clear
[1:50:02] you clog any pipe brother Papa don't
[1:50:04] know what happens the water just flows
[1:50:06] automatically
[1:50:07] because the water wants to flow
[1:50:10] but if something blocking the pipe then
[1:50:12] you water can't flow so you get a little
[1:50:14] Trickle and it's not low pressure
[1:50:15] something block any pipe but if you
[1:50:18] Clarity pipe you're getting full benefit
[1:50:20] of the water I want to float and he says

[1:57:12] believe but now you're climbing high up
[1:57:14] the mountain you need something to keep
[1:57:16] on pressing yes this is that day this is
[1:57:19] that service this is that season not
[1:57:21] just more information but an experience
[1:57:24] word and spirit together
[1:57:29] foreign
[1:57:30] [Applause]
[1:57:38] but the spirit
[1:57:40] is what brings life
[1:57:45] could you take some more
[1:57:56] God wants to use you
[1:58:01] he has no hands but your hands
[1:58:05] he has no feet but your feet
[1:58:07] [Applause]
[1:58:09] [Music]
[1:58:12] Ethiopian eunuch was reading the word
[1:58:14] and couldn't understand it God had a
[1:58:17] choice
[1:58:18] he could have gone and met that man but
[1:58:21] he sent Philip
[1:58:23] because he had somebody on the earth who
[1:58:26] had the sea germ
[1:58:28] the life itself in the body
[1:58:30] [Applause]
[1:58:32] so God will not do what he could
[1:58:34] delegate
[1:58:36] [Music]
[1:58:37] [Applause]
[1:58:39] [Music]
[1:58:44] the relationship with your children with
[1:58:47] your family might be strained but God
[1:58:49] wants to delegate to you
[1:58:52] and give you such a transformation that
[1:58:56] those you can't reach now will wonder
[1:58:58] what happened to you they will say is
[1:59:00] this is this not Joseph's son
[1:59:04] could anything good come out of Nazareth
[1:59:06] I thought I know this man I thought I
[1:59:08] know this woman but something must have
[1:59:11] happened because you're talking
[1:59:12] differently
[1:59:15] your approach is different
[1:59:17] your life is different
[1:59:19] [Applause]
[1:59:22] you wouldn't have to say anything about
[1:59:24] it the prophet said it will speak for
[1:59:30] [Music]
[1:59:39] so because God had fill up on the earth
[1:59:42] he moved Philip he translated Philip
[1:59:45] from a Revival to meet the youth
[1:59:47] European eunuch to reveal to him the
[1:59:49] word what he was reading
[1:59:53] [Applause]
[1:59:54] and this Bible is a closed book
[1:59:57] without the prophet
[2:00:01] don't try to take away my prophet
[2:00:03] there's nothing we could preach in this
[2:00:05] Bible if it was done for the prophet
[2:00:09] iron up the Loose Ends revealing every
[2:00:11] mystery bringing the word it's a plain
[2:00:14] view
[2:00:15] not just Clarity of the full picture of
[2:00:18] God but what was needed for us to
[2:00:20] prepare ourselves for the rapture
[2:00:22] [Applause]
[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:27] [Applause]
[2:00:30] we are not trying to preach our
[2:00:33] understanding of it
[2:00:36] our interpretation of it
[2:00:39] our feelings about it the way we think
[2:00:42] God meant no
[2:00:45] God is The Interpreter of his own word
[2:00:50] and that's why we say what the tape say
[2:00:53] [Applause]
[2:01:00] everybody feeling fine
[2:01:02] everybody enjoying the world
[2:01:04] we here for the day right
[2:01:06] don't worry we have some little food
[2:01:08] afterwards the totally young people is
[2:01:09] under Buffet he's not a restaurant
[2:01:14] but a little sustenance to keep us going
[2:01:17] Our Lives don't belong to us you know
[2:01:19] [Applause]
[2:01:22] listen the more you acknowledge God
[2:01:25] I was sharing with you on people I did a
[2:01:26] a prayer meeting a few weeks ago about
[2:01:28] Hannah
[2:01:29] and I said Hannah's Prayer activated
[2:01:32] something in God
[2:01:34] has a vested interest
[2:01:36] in displaying his power
[2:01:39] that's why when you read his Bible and
[2:01:41] you see them pray men pray because they
[2:01:43] understood God they say Lord is your
[2:01:45] name they they will bring no
[2:01:50] he said they beefing with your name
[2:01:56] they say let not your name be taken down
[2:01:59] or not and when you pray like that God
[2:02:01] does feel a certain way about it
[2:02:08] because God has a vested interest
[2:02:12] them Ben of all Brothers you say pray
[2:02:14] Lord is not not about us not even for us
[2:02:16] but for your name
[2:02:18] come and fight this battle to Save Your
[2:02:21] Name Lord you know we messed up but your
[2:02:24] name don't let our messen up mess up
[2:02:27] your name
[2:02:29] because your name is higher than every
[2:02:31] other name yo
[2:02:34] and when they talk like that God says
[2:02:36] send angels
[2:02:37] open the inventory send soldiers
[2:02:51] so that's why even that's why I have to
[2:02:53] know how to pray
[2:02:55] Samson and say oh God lord
[2:02:58] and they say Lord hear what now avenge
[2:03:02] me
[2:03:04] of my two eyes
[2:03:06] in other words I didn't put it
[2:03:11] is you put the ice
[2:03:13] them take out your eyes
[2:03:18] they had no right Lord I know I messed
[2:03:20] upon them but they have no right to come
[2:03:23] and take all the eyes that you put in
[2:03:26] who these people feel they are that they
[2:03:29] got high that you put in
[2:03:31] and when you talk like that God say you
[2:03:34] know you're right is I put them eyes
[2:03:36] there how come these Philistines God and
[2:03:39] take all the eyes that I bought it all
[2:03:42] you don't hear me deceived
[2:03:44] who gave them the right to take out the
[2:03:47] eye that I put there
[2:03:57] come the church semen and the devil had
[2:04:00] no right to come in your house he had no
[2:04:03] right to come in your body he had no
[2:04:05] wrong come on now to touch your children
[2:04:09] that's why we have the authority to take
[2:04:12] them back
[2:04:22] [Music]
[2:04:27] the devil has no right
[2:04:29] [Applause]
[2:04:33] [Music]
[2:04:36] [Applause]
[2:04:38] don't touch this bride don't touch this
[2:04:41] family don't touch this house
[2:04:51] [Music]
[2:04:54] in other words friends don't let your
[2:04:57] sins and your mistakes and your failures
[2:04:58] keep you back from calling on God
[2:05:01] [Applause]
[2:05:05] [Music]
[2:05:13] [Applause]
[2:05:22] I hope this helped build your feet this
[2:05:23] morning you know remember that Andrew
[2:05:27] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory
[2:05:32] [Applause]
[2:05:34] start to look at your hands in front of
[2:05:36] them but at balance
[2:05:39] it takes a little bit of confidence to
[2:05:42] look at the Devil and say Boo
[2:05:43] I'm pretty
[2:05:45] you know because the devil is one used
[2:05:48] to shut up you just want you to take
[2:05:50] a preaching like a trillion is
[2:05:52] but when did they say poo
[2:05:55] the devil do expect you to respond
[2:05:57] because your whole life you're taking
[2:05:59] licks all kind of stress all kind of
[2:06:01] pressure he think you want to beat into
[2:06:03] subjection like those children of Israel
[2:06:05] were in Egypt
[2:06:07] all right
[2:06:09] but he mommy didn't say boo back
[2:06:12] whatever gets smaller and when you see
[2:06:15] that little move
[2:06:16] that'll change your power listen you're
[2:06:18] ready
[2:06:20] so if you see me walk around church
[2:06:22] after service saying boo look at this
[2:06:25] with me I'm watching devil shrink boo
[2:06:28] boo boo boo I that's how I walk into my
[2:06:32] house now boo let them take out crazy I
[2:06:34] don't care I don't care I'm taking back
[2:06:37] what the devil took from me every place
[2:06:40] every place that shows up your feet
[2:06:42] train that time I shocked
[2:06:48] I'm trying to find a place to close off
[2:06:50] this morning
[2:06:55] I hope is this helping anybody this
[2:06:56] morning
[2:07:03] you may be seated
[2:07:07] so many people had experiences with God
[2:07:13] we have spoken a lot about positive
[2:07:15] experiences
[2:07:18] I want to remind us
[2:07:20] that not ex every experience with God is
[2:07:22] positive you know
[2:07:27] brother random taught us when you come
[2:07:29] to the house of God
[2:07:30] you will never leave the sin
[2:07:34] he said he will either get better
[2:07:37] or you'll get worse
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:42] can I say that one more time
[2:07:44] whenever you come to the house of God
[2:07:46] you will never leave the same
[2:07:49] you will either live better
[2:07:52] or you will leave worse
[2:07:56] and one day Jesus is preaching and
[2:07:58] there's a young man sitting there in the
[2:08:00] church
[2:08:03] and maybe close to the end of the
[2:08:05] service he must us up the courage to
[2:08:07] approach Jesus
[2:08:09] with Anthony preach a beautiful message
[2:08:12] in 2013 I believe around this subject
[2:08:14] what lack I yet
[2:08:18] and this Rich Young Ruler waited for his
[2:08:21] turn as it were to say good master from
[2:08:24] my youth
[2:08:25] I've observed the Commandments I've done
[2:08:27] all these things what
[2:08:29] what a neater this eternal life thing
[2:08:34] friends what an experience to talk to
[2:08:38] Jesus
[2:08:43] and to get her answer
[2:08:46] we pray and we talk to God and we lord
[2:08:49] we want to hear from you and this Rich
[2:08:51] Young Ruler had the opportunity to sit
[2:08:53] and talk and stand and have a
[2:08:55] conversation with Jesus and it wasn't as
[2:08:57] if he had to hope to get an answer Jesus
[2:08:59] responded
[2:09:03] and he told this young man he saw the
[2:09:05] sincerity in his heart he said go sell
[2:09:08] all you have
[2:09:10] and give to the poor
[2:09:15] what a what a thing to not only talk to
[2:09:18] Jesus
[2:09:20] from Jesus and
[2:09:21] him and to get a plan of action
[2:09:26] of naughty things you may have to do you
[2:09:28] know religious but the exact thing to do
[2:09:33] it is not that he left the service I
[2:09:36] already sure what I need to do next
[2:09:40] he was told exactly what he had to do
[2:09:43] next
[2:09:44] [Applause]
[2:09:47] the Bible said Jesus loved him
[2:09:52] was love that
[2:10:00] and the Bible said this man left hope
[2:10:03] sorrowful
[2:10:05] because he was not willing to do what it
[2:10:08] took
[2:10:09] to change his life
[2:10:12] anybody who spoke to that man after the
[2:10:15] surface
[2:10:16] who was looking
[2:10:18] because I would have imagined this was a
[2:10:20] private conversation
[2:10:23] hey you you spoke to Jesus
[2:10:27] I wish I had a chance to get to I didn't
[2:10:30] get to talk to him
[2:10:32] brother how was it how is it how is it
[2:10:34] to talk to Jesus
[2:10:37] what you wanted to know what did you ask
[2:10:39] him what did he tell you
[2:10:43] testify about it
[2:10:48] I wonder what this man was saying
[2:10:54] if he could have even said that he could
[2:10:56] have even repeated it
[2:10:59] how come you look inside didn't you just
[2:11:02] talk to Jesus
[2:11:04] everybody else who we saw with Jesus
[2:11:06] left rejoicing
[2:11:10] the woman whose daughter was vet with
[2:11:12] the devil if you see how she rejoice
[2:11:15] do you remember the issue of blood if
[2:11:16] you see how she rejoice
[2:11:21] this Centurion who said enough to go to
[2:11:24] my house just speak the word
[2:11:28] brother what happened to you
[2:11:34] he was a witness he had an experience
[2:11:36] but he was unwilling
[2:11:39] to do what was required to get his life
[2:11:43] in order with the Lord
[2:11:48] if there ever was an example to us this
[2:11:50] is not my Ministry but the oven Ministry
[2:11:52] the prophet Ministry this was Jesus
[2:11:54] himself
[2:11:55] this is not there's somebody in the
[2:11:57] audience who need to sell what they have
[2:11:58] and give this is not that
[2:12:01] this is not a somebody with a back pain
[2:12:04] there's somebody with a headache out of
[2:12:06] 100 200 you must have somebody with a
[2:12:07] headache this wasn't that
[2:12:12] there's somebody here who lost a pen
[2:12:15] this was done that
[2:12:17] this was Jesus Discerning love
[2:12:19] discerning
[2:12:20] and writing a prescription
[2:12:23] that you need to go to the pharmacy and
[2:12:26] fulfill
[2:12:28] and do what it takes you have to take
[2:12:30] the tablet you have to take the therapy
[2:12:32] you have to cut all the sugar you have
[2:12:34] to stop it in Salt you have to exercise
[2:12:35] 30 minutes a day you have stuff you need
[2:12:38] to do
[2:12:39] [Applause]
[2:12:41] and he left sorrowful not willing to do
[2:12:44] it because it was a deep issue in his
[2:12:46] heart
[2:12:49] when you come to the house of God you
[2:12:52] either live better
[2:12:53] or you're left worse that man left worse
[2:12:56] how will you leave the service
[2:12:59] today
[2:13:02] musicians get ready I have one more for
[2:13:04] you
[2:13:09] and this is one it is a message I enjoy
[2:13:12] preaching the most is this one
[2:13:15] because it blew my mind out of Jesus's
[2:13:18] Ministry what he chose to highlight in
[2:13:20] his ministry
[2:13:22] I preach many times Jesus never in his
[2:13:25] preaching said remember David remember
[2:13:28] Joshua remember Elijah remember no
[2:13:32] the only commandment he said was
[2:13:35] remember Lord's wife
[2:13:38] he's single her out specifically not by
[2:13:41] name but by role
[2:13:46] he could have identified a name he chose
[2:13:47] to leave a nameless because this wife is
[2:13:50] a is a is a is a avatar it's a it's a
[2:13:53] person it's a it's a it's a place people
[2:13:56] in this place are being lost wife you
[2:13:58] know
[2:14:02] and how did it play out the Bible says
[2:14:05] that this situation was a natural
[2:14:06] problem
[2:14:08] between lot's family of Abraham's family
[2:14:10] and Abraham being the bigger man said
[2:14:13] you choose
[2:14:16] to speak about this as well and Lord
[2:14:18] pitch his tent towards Sodom
[2:14:23] but he didn't consider the effects of
[2:14:25] his decision
[2:14:27] because the Bible said
[2:14:29] when you study it a lot was strong
[2:14:31] enough because he was at the gate and
[2:14:33] then Peter Peter Justified him and said
[2:14:34] blood was bothered by the filthy
[2:14:37] conversation in Sodom
[2:14:40] so he wasn't being influenced by there
[2:14:42] but his wife and children were exposed
[2:14:44] to it what lot could have handled his
[2:14:47] wife and family could not have handled
[2:14:49] and this is the call and a warning to
[2:14:51] the fathers and the leaders in the house
[2:14:53] you might be able to handle decisions
[2:14:55] that you make but you have to think of
[2:14:57] the second order consequences what about
[2:14:59] your wife what about your children what
[2:15:01] about your family
[2:15:03] our actions affect other people
[2:15:07] am I speaking to anybody this morning
[2:15:14] and the way God operates just like the
[2:15:16] Ethiopian you're not where God had fill
[2:15:18] upon the Earth God said I'm not gonna
[2:15:19] touch Sodom and Gomorrah without talking
[2:15:21] to my man and he got to have a witness
[2:15:23] his name is Abraham before I do anything
[2:15:25] let me bring Abraham any Luke
[2:15:28] she said shall I hide from Abraham what
[2:15:30] I'm about to do
[2:15:32] in other words I respect my man on the
[2:15:34] ground
[2:15:36] you say Abraham
[2:15:38] this is what I'm about to do I'm about
[2:15:39] to go on this choice of the mangamore
[2:15:44] hold up hold up
[2:15:46] I have family I have loved ones I know
[2:15:49] this situation bad but oh gosh
[2:15:51] if at least he has 50. spare them now
[2:15:55] I'm a child in trouble
[2:15:57] holding on for them I'm holding on that
[2:15:59] I love a lot a lovely Families my family
[2:16:02] I don't want to see them lost I don't
[2:16:03] want to I just want to go to the Rapture
[2:16:05] and say fire upon them no that's not
[2:16:07] true that is that's not being a
[2:16:08] Christian
[2:16:10] Abraham could I say like some of us
[2:16:11] Chinese where they make a bad day like
[2:16:13] lying it
[2:16:18] he saw that let me reap it let me reap
[2:16:21] it reap It Bun them
[2:16:25] that's not the Christian way
[2:16:29] and Abraham plea and he said Lord oh
[2:16:31] gosh if there's no 50 of his team is
[2:16:32] twenty if it's too deep it's twenty
[2:16:34] Xavier's even 10.
[2:16:36] he looked into place insurance policies
[2:16:38] he wants to mitigate the risk as far as
[2:16:40] he could he risk
[2:16:42] and they couldn't even find 10 right
[2:16:43] just in the Old City
[2:16:46] and because God's love for his servant
[2:16:48] Abraham you don't think God honors your
[2:16:50] prayer your sacrifice your faithfulness
[2:16:52] because of Abraham's love
[2:16:57] do you understand that the angel that
[2:16:59] went to Sodom and Gomorrah was because
[2:17:01] of Abraham
[2:17:04] that if Abraham did not plea for them
[2:17:07] these things they would not have gone I
[2:17:09] want you to understand this
[2:17:11] for you parents who want to give up on
[2:17:12] your children that you're pleading for
[2:17:14] your children dispatches angels
[2:17:17] [Applause]
[2:17:18] [Music]
[2:17:21] when you can reach them the Angels could
[2:17:24] reach them
[2:17:28] and the Bible give the type of when
[2:17:30] Daniel stopped praying the Angels stop
[2:17:32] fighting
[2:17:35] so whatever you do keep on praying keep
[2:17:37] in faith keep believing keep pleading
[2:17:39] and watch God do the rest
[2:17:47] I'm getting ready to close out
[2:17:51] so because of love God dispatched two
[2:17:54] angels
[2:17:56] to go into Solomon Gomorrah
[2:17:59] and as they are coming lot is at the
[2:18:01] gate
[2:18:03] biblically the business center he not
[2:18:05] with only back now he's there he's
[2:18:07] mining his business he's trying to
[2:18:08] defeat his family and he observes the
[2:18:10] two men and he knows just by the way
[2:18:11] they walk in the different
[2:18:17] their countenance their son he
[2:18:19] recognized he know his losses Are
[2:18:21] Spiritual enough to know these men come
[2:18:23] from God
[2:18:25] and you know when they meet somebody who
[2:18:27] come from God you know you know
[2:18:30] we are playing games your spiritual
[2:18:32] being
[2:18:37] and he decides to take these men at the
[2:18:38] gates I said to carry them to his house
[2:18:40] and in the journey
[2:18:42] the filthy Sodom and gomorians whatever
[2:18:44] you want to call them see these men
[2:18:49] sodomites
[2:18:51] and say we want to lie with them
[2:18:54] a lot have to go and hide them in his
[2:18:56] house
[2:18:59] and the Bible said the men of the
[2:19:01] village surrounded lot house
[2:19:04] to get these men
[2:19:07] Lots concerned for these men of God was
[2:19:10] so great that he offered his two virgin
[2:19:12] daughters to the men and the men of the
[2:19:15] city they say we don't want them girls
[2:19:19] we want the men who just came in
[2:19:25] and Jesus said as it was in the days
[2:19:30] so shall it be what day is we living in
[2:19:37] we're not playing games it's a reality
[2:19:40] we're living in hell
[2:19:45] and people are born to declaring ball
[2:19:47] the same ball to stand out about it
[2:19:50] and you say I want to keep my skirt on
[2:19:53] me and you fight them with that
[2:19:55] foolishness still baby steps you still
[2:19:57] in for this yeah
[2:20:03] whenever the child is picking the child
[2:20:04] when there was a
[2:20:06] childless things when when I go grew up
[2:20:12] Satan's kingdom come into maturity you
[2:20:14] know we have to come to maturity then
[2:20:15] climb the pyramid and get to adoption
[2:20:17] we can't be playing in standard one
[2:20:22] the devil has a thousands of years to
[2:20:24] get the University degree in them
[2:20:29] the Bible says and this way I want to
[2:20:31] get the Lord's wife
[2:20:32] so lots of wives did cook a little food
[2:20:35] the Angels friends
[2:20:37] the Richer ruler met Jesus Lord's wife
[2:20:40] Entertaining Angels
[2:20:43] but I see when you have to know his
[2:20:46] angels
[2:20:47] and if you didn't know the Bible said
[2:20:49] that after a while when either get fed
[2:20:51] up of again knocking on the door but
[2:20:53] upon what they do they walk outside and
[2:20:55] they're blinded all the men
[2:20:59] so if Lot's wife didn't know it was an
[2:21:02] angel then
[2:21:06] see God move and see
[2:21:10] somebody in my house there's a anointing
[2:21:12] here never see this before and
[2:21:22] [Applause]
[2:21:24] many saw the prophet and they don't even
[2:21:26] believe the message anymore
[2:21:32] the Bible said when they blinded these
[2:21:34] men all night long these Blind Men
[2:21:38] running around the house trying to find
[2:21:40] it all
[2:21:43] and you want to let your children go to
[2:21:45] your house without praying
[2:21:49] and you want to walk down and go to work
[2:21:50] without praying
[2:21:53] you so big and bad
[2:21:56] that you could go out there anywhere
[2:21:57] without committing your life to the Lord
[2:21:59] before you leave your house
[2:22:01] you that strapped you that ready that
[2:22:04] you ready to go all day without the Lord
[2:22:09] when the land of hell is open and
[2:22:11] streams of demon powers walk in the
[2:22:12] earth you want to risk going out there
[2:22:14] without saying Lord cover my child where
[2:22:16] your blood cover me on the road with
[2:22:18] your blood government will work with
[2:22:20] your blood cover me everywhere in your
[2:22:21] blood protect his home protect my coming
[2:22:23] out we're going in he said the angel of
[2:22:25] the Lord and come around those are clear
[2:22:27] Lord may you dispatch Angels you heard
[2:22:30] such a rajkumar's testimony she got to
[2:22:32] her house a car pull in front of her
[2:22:36] she don't know what to do watch your
[2:22:38] movies
[2:22:39] [Music]
[2:22:44] with the craziness the home invasions
[2:22:46] going on around new country
[2:22:50] I said to the young people there was a
[2:22:51] time people respected the mature on the
[2:22:54] old and his senior citizens not the
[2:22:55] coughing 85 year old woman in the head
[2:22:57] to take three dollars
[2:23:00] and but a Branham said right now love is
[2:23:02] on the earth you know
[2:23:04] he said when the bride lives in a
[2:23:05] Rapture log will go with the bride I
[2:23:07] don't know
[2:23:07] there'll be no love in here to know so
[2:23:10] if what we are seeing is actions and
[2:23:12] behaviors with love being here what
[2:23:14] would it be when love leaves with the
[2:23:15] bride
[2:23:16] and you don't want to have a
[2:23:18] relationship with God
[2:23:22] after what we have seen what we see
[2:23:24] should put our souls into action Every
[2:23:27] Soul
[2:23:32] I'm trying to close out
[2:23:34] let's bring this home
[2:23:36] so Lot's wife sees blind man
[2:23:39] the Angels plead the Angels the Bible
[2:23:41] said because lot had more than two girls
[2:23:44] he had multiple children
[2:23:46] because the Bible said he went to his
[2:23:47] sons-in-laws
[2:23:50] so these were the boys were married to
[2:23:52] his other daughters
[2:23:53] and the Bible said they laughed and
[2:23:55] mocked him
[2:23:56] read the Bible we did this in a Bible
[2:23:57] study
[2:24:00] and lot is so anxious now he is there
[2:24:03] trying to get them until the Bible said
[2:24:05] the Angels physically grabbed them and
[2:24:07] pull them out
[2:24:09] this is the way caller extraction so a
[2:24:12] lot his wife and his two daughters have
[2:24:14] to walk out
[2:24:19] and they are given one instruction Don't
[2:24:21] Look Back In other words don't backslide
[2:24:26] Don't Turn back don't go back into the
[2:24:28] world don't play games if you leave this
[2:24:30] service make up your mind to not look
[2:24:32] back
[2:24:34] make up your mind
[2:24:36] I don't care about yesterday last week
[2:24:39] last month last year 20 years ago make
[2:24:42] up your mind from this day forward I'm
[2:24:44] Not Looking Back
[2:24:46] I'm looking to Calvary I'm looking to my
[2:24:49] retention I'm looking to the Holy Ghost
[2:24:51] I'm looking to be a lived voice I'm
[2:24:53] looking to add these virtues I'm looking
[2:24:55] to live above sin I've said it many
[2:24:58] times but the Branham taught us you
[2:25:00] could live in such a way the devil don't
[2:25:02] even know what to do with you
[2:25:10] thank you
[2:25:12] you can begin to play something Softly
[2:25:15] I can start to walk out
[2:25:17] walk out
[2:25:19] I can imagine maybe a lot is leading
[2:25:21] them out because the Lord spoke a lot he
[2:25:23] said follow me let's go the angel said
[2:25:25] here's the Escape Theater in other words
[2:25:27] don't stroll
[2:25:29] don't stroll out
[2:25:31] but the brother would stand there in the
[2:25:32] Tabernacle and he says when God come to
[2:25:35] you say respond quickly
[2:25:38] he said if you don't respond fast enough
[2:25:40] the angel moves away but Anthony didn't
[2:25:42] he teach us this
[2:25:43] when you feel the talk of God in your
[2:25:45] heart just respond quickly
[2:25:48] these are told I'm here skip to the run
[2:25:51] for your life
[2:25:53] so lot is moving come on come on let's
[2:25:55] go let's go let's go let's go let's go
[2:25:56] and while they're walking out
[2:25:59] fire is falling over Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:26:02] judgment striking behind her I said come
[2:26:05] on don't look back don't look back why
[2:26:06] if you're good
[2:26:08] daughter say good let's go let's go
[2:26:09] let's go
[2:26:15] it wasn't easy for a lot he was leaving
[2:26:17] his other children behind
[2:26:22] his children had reach a point where
[2:26:23] they made their own decision
[2:26:26] he had done all he could do
[2:26:28] [Music]
[2:26:30] but a Madam taught us there's a line
[2:26:31] that
[2:26:32] after while they cross the line there's
[2:26:33] no hope
[2:26:35] he taught us do not cross the line
[2:26:37] he said I see a day where the young
[2:26:38] people at the altar praying crying and
[2:26:41] no help for them no hope for them
[2:26:43] because they don't cross in line it's
[2:26:44] too late
[2:26:47] no more salvation for them that's a
[2:26:49] quote
[2:26:50] I preach that do not cross the line
[2:26:52] so there's Mercy is not a always last
[2:26:55] and mercy said seek you the Lord while
[2:26:57] he may be found call upon him while he
[2:26:59] is near there's always been a time limit
[2:27:04] [Applause]
[2:27:05] I don't know who this is for today
[2:27:09] I don't know he knew who needs to hear
[2:27:10] this today but God knows my heart I
[2:27:13] don't want to miss it and I don't want
[2:27:15] you to miss it
[2:27:19] and after a while imagine and this to me
[2:27:22] is the painful part of this lot is
[2:27:24] calling for his wife honey you're there
[2:27:26] and there's no answer and by the Mikey
[2:27:29] you know it's the hard part you can't

[2:27:40] because our instinct is you okay
[2:27:46] we can't even do that

[2:27:53] [Music]
[2:27:57] sister a lot had seen enough to keep on
[2:28:00] walking
