[49:47] no God hello him all he knows this
[49:52] perfection amen
[49:55] he's the perfect one he is eternal made
[50:01] up of seven perfect spirits
[50:03] the function of infinity and that God
[50:08] created a perfect man in the garden in
[50:10] his very image and likeness can we say
[50:15] man notice when God formed man from the
[50:20] dust and breathed into his nostrils man
[50:24] became a living soul not a body
[50:29] Genesis 2:7 can we say man a living soul
[50:34] praise God mind so God made Adam a
[50:39] living soul there's something or the
[50:42] soul of man that God is interested in
[50:45] this morning hallelujah
[50:48] and I almost created in the image and
[50:51] likeness of God he was perfect he was
[50:55] the perfect creation of God he was the
[50:59] perfect fruit of God and sin brought a
[51:04] separation when Adam fell between God
[51:08] and man a man and the life line was
[51:12] broken the connection to perfection was
[51:16] cut and the image fell down from a
[51:19] perfect level to a human level a carnal
[51:25] level the fruit itself was no longer
[51:28] perfect
[51:30] my god Adam originally could never grow
[51:37] old now he can
[51:40] there was no sickness before the fall
[51:43] no he could get sick there was no death
[51:48] before the fall but a wages of sin is
[51:51] death and Adam died after 930 years my
[51:58] man
[51:59] God's fruit was now corrupted by sin it
[52:04] was no longer a perfect fruit my and all
[52:12] other fruits that would come forth
[52:14] through Adam would not be public fruits
[52:17] my God my god a man Moses was the
[52:23] greatest prophet not like him but he
[52:26] disobeyed God and struck the rock an
[52:30] imperfect fruit Jacob was a trickster he
[52:36] deceived many people imperfect fruit
[52:40] David committed adultery and murder are
[52:44] imperfect fruit so he was a man after
[52:47] God's own heart but still imperfect
[52:50] fruit hallelujah
[52:52] Joseph came very close to perfection so
[52:55] much so that he was used to type
[52:57] affection but he lied he told us but us
[53:02] to say that they were not Shepherds my
[53:06] brother all those Bible believers had
[53:09] some flaw to tarnish them from being
[53:13] perfect fruit
[53:16] glory to God my God my God my my my yet
[53:22] yet if we go across the Matthew 5:48 the
[53:28] Bible says be therefore perfect even as
[53:32] your father which is in heaven is
[53:34] perfect
[53:35] my brother Branham says God demands
[53:40] perfection God requires perfection no
[53:47] one could ever come to heaven outside of
[53:49] being perfect you must be perfect
[53:53] hallelujah amen yet the scripture says
[53:59] none is perfect
[54:01] we all have sinned and come short of the
[54:04] glory of God my how are we ever going to
[54:09] enter God's dwelling place when he
[54:12] requires perfection my god Branham says
[54:21] from the message the law having a shadow
[54:24] when sin was first given in the Garden
[54:27] of Eden the man was in a perfect state
[54:31] until he fell
[54:33] then he marred his perfection he marred
[54:38] his inheritance with God he lost his
[54:42] fellowship and was cut off away from God
[54:46] amen so the fruit was no longer perfect
[54:51] hey man Oh Luke chapter 8 verse 14 are
[54:56] you ready he talks of all those seeds
[54:59] and fell among thorns how they were
[55:02] choked by different situations and they
[55:05] brought no fruits on to perfection
[55:09] [Applause]
[55:11] my so God is interested in perfect fruit
[55:17] so you mean you can have bad fruit good
[55:22] but then there's fruits aren't to
[55:24] perfection perfect fruit amen
[55:29] you mean that God was not happy with it
[55:31] with those fruits that are not brought
[55:34] on to perfection
[55:36] he started me with any man so tell me
[55:41] where are you going without half the
[55:43] Christian life my brother say man you're
[55:48] not praying every day you're not in the
[55:51] word you're not seeking the baptism of
[55:53] the Holy Ghost desperately praise God
[55:58] raise your fruits of the spirit love and
[56:01] joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[56:04] goodness faith meekness and temperance
[56:08] come on now say man where your fruits of
[56:12] the spirit is mourning and my nephew
[56:15] Daniel you told me I'm a rough guy
[56:17] so after pray for Gentiles amen amen
[56:21] praise God hallelujah but God once a
[56:25] perfect fruit amen
[56:28] Satan is laughing at you if you don't
[56:32] come to perfection because Satan knows
[56:36] the world amen he even believes the word
[56:42] my he knows it's the truth say man
[56:49] don't be fool now he knows more than
[56:52] some of you my hallelujah praise God
[56:59] Satan comes to church every Sunday
[57:01] morning hallelujah he takes notes he
[57:05] records it on his telephone my god
[57:08] Satanists in church every Sunday morning
[57:11] my so he knows what we are supposed to
[57:16] become a man so when he sees hypocrites
[57:21] or nice church members or pious lovely
[57:25] religious spirits he is happy with you
[57:28] he says very good you stay right there
[57:32] don't go any further my my glory to God
[57:40] the word says don't cut your hair
[57:42] sisters but just the devil oh but just
[57:45] cut just enough so that no one can see
[57:48] after all you won't be stumbling anybody
[57:50] Mart they can't see anything of
[57:54] stumbling them just cut it short enough
[57:56] that nobody could see a man somebody
[58:00] give it all on the praise very strong
[58:05] bracelet
[58:06] so Satan is coming to church not to
[58:10] become the word but to see how best we
[58:13] can tie up your head from what you have
[58:17] heard in church
[58:19] now you will bring reasoning you will
[58:23] prey on your affection your affection
[58:25] and emotions he will look at your
[58:28] conscience Amen hallelujah glory to God
[58:32] a man but all of it always says Satan is
[58:36] not afraid of who you are now
[58:39] with all your friends and your mistakes
[58:42] these are afraid of that but he's afraid
[58:45] of who you can become by the Word of God
[58:48] and by the spirit
[58:51] so his job is to distract you from
[58:55] focusing on getting the Holy Ghost and
[58:57] becoming the word say Amen hallelujah
[59:02] see but not one more days devil Oh glory
[59:08] to God Satan you're exposed today
[59:11] get out of here in the name of Jesus
[59:14] hallelujah I can see those demons
[59:17] pushing one another and scampering on
[59:19] the stairs
[59:20] praise God this place is getting too hot
[59:23] for the devil amen praise God a man you
[59:27] are going to be perfect you are going to
[59:30] be perfect
[59:31] give the Lord a hand the press thank you
[59:35] lord
[59:35] [Applause]
[59:37] hallelujah hallelujah come on now not
[59:40] one more day for the devil not one more
[59:43] day for the devil I'm on my way to
[59:45] perfection hallelujah glory to God Oh

[1:00:20] and ordained you that you should go and
[1:00:22] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[1:00:24] should remain amen there are two things
[1:00:29] that are very important that God is

[1:01:10] in a group and I bought my pass all the
[1:01:13] others and selected this particular one
[1:01:17] this one over there
[1:01:19] not one over there running about to the
[1:01:22] black jacket that's why I selected I
[1:01:25] chose him Alleluia praise God praise God
[1:01:28] amen you mean to say that there are over
[1:01:32] seven billion people all over the earth
[1:01:35] and the core of eternity hello him
[1:01:39] Jehovah the creator of the universe
[1:01:41] shows me pouring of God praise God

[1:02:05] choose you say man this morning
[1:02:09] hallelujah praise God you did not choose
[1:02:13] me but I chose you before the foundation
[1:02:16] of the world

[1:02:23] strong people intelligent people holy
[1:02:27] people and Lord you chose that were all
[1:02:31] insignificant me

[1:02:37] faults and our failures and my
[1:02:40] shortcomings what do you see in me Lord

[1:02:49] gratitude

[1:04:18] you Lord you may be seated
[1:04:20] praise God let us go back to sin John 15
[1:04:25] again there's a second very important
[1:04:30] thing that God has sent to you from that
[1:04:33] scripture he says I have obtained you
[1:04:39] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[1:04:45] or danger or change you so I went to the
[1:04:51] dictionary to make sure I understood
[1:04:53] clearly what ordained means in this
[1:04:56] context and it says to a point so anoint
[1:05:02] to order to give a command hallelujah
[1:05:07] praise gonee man then I understood that
[1:05:11] after he chose me he commissioned me to
[1:05:17] go forth and bear fruit
[1:05:20] [Applause]
[1:05:22] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah in
[1:05:25] other words after he chose you
[1:05:28] he anointed and appointed you to bring
[1:05:31] forth fruit he is not asking you kindly
[1:05:36] it is a command and yes giving you what
[1:05:40] it takes to carry all the instructions
[1:05:43] hallelujah praise God blessed be the
[1:05:47] name of the walk glory now listen it's
[1:05:50] not just any fruit but fruit that should
[1:05:54] remain say man not in church today and
[1:06:01] tomorrow you're backslidden not today up
[1:06:04] to day and down tomorrow not fruit Sarah
[1:06:08] green not true Sarah tossed about by
[1:06:11] every wind of doctrine and fall off the
[1:06:13] tree and I my he wants fruits that would
[1:06:18] remain a man he wants mature fruits he
[1:06:23] wants ripe fruits amen
[1:06:26] if you don't remain in the presence of
[1:06:28] the hot to lie son how will you get
[1:06:31] right say man so he sends trials and
[1:06:36] tests and buckles on every side and you
[1:06:40] stand steadfast unmovable flat-footed
[1:06:45] grounded in the love of God praise God a
[1:06:48] many many men on your fruit sow remain
[1:06:53] Oh Lord of God thank you Jesus
[1:06:56] hallelujah
[1:06:57] in other words fruits on to perfection
[1:07:04] hallelujah given order hand the Prince
[1:07:07] [Applause]
[1:07:11] [Music]
[1:07:13] so God has ordained you to bring forth
[1:07:17] perfect fruit tell me say man not good
[1:07:22] fruit now but fruit unto perfection
[1:07:28] female espresso so now God wants a
[1:07:32] perfect fruit
[1:07:33] he had a perfect fruit son and the god
[1:07:36] Adam Adam was perfect before he fell now
[1:07:43] man becomes human amen
[1:07:47] to be human is to be imperfect that's
[1:07:52] why when we make a mistake and we are
[1:07:54] caught
[1:07:55] what do we say we are quick to say I'm
[1:07:56] only human
[1:07:58] I'm not perfect amen do we say that
[1:08:01] sometimes
[1:08:02] amen okay
[1:08:05] so man after the fall is human imperfect
[1:08:10] freshly and Conner
[1:08:14] amen the Bible says to be carnally
[1:08:17] minded is death death Romans 8:7 the
[1:08:23] carnal mind is enmity against God so God
[1:08:27] hates the carnal fleshly man my god amen
[1:08:32] hallelujah therefore God had to make a
[1:08:38] way to lift fallen man out of this mess
[1:08:42] called a humanistic realm or the human
[1:08:46] spirit Oh glory to God Amen hallelujah
[1:08:50] praise God praise God amen let me just
[1:08:55] stick with it
[1:08:56] God does not make mistakes
[1:09:00] if he makes some mistakes then he is not
[1:09:03] God he is a human just like you and me
[1:09:08] you don't want a god who's making
[1:09:10] mistakes like yourself a man car don't
[1:09:14] get surprised like we humans do he is
[1:09:18] infinite he's omniscient he knows all
[1:09:22] things hallelujah from beginning to end
[1:09:25] amen hallelujah he's Alpha and Omega
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:30] God is not reactive because you do this
[1:09:34] let me see how I can fix this problem no
[1:09:37] no no God is proactive amen so when the
[1:09:42] devil thought he was finishing off God
[1:09:45] by introducing sin in the garden God was
[1:09:49] one step ahead of the devil ah
[1:09:53] louia praise God in it so before the
[1:09:57] beginning God said I know that ugly
[1:10:01] devil will try not silly trick in the
[1:10:03] garden mine to put an end to my perfect
[1:10:07] fruit harvest so you know what I will do
[1:10:10] I will choose my people before Satan
[1:10:14] even comes into the picture hallelujah
[1:10:18] praise God he got before Satan was
[1:10:21] created corner already chosen you
[1:10:26] do you praise God amen praise God amen
[1:10:34] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:39] so God chose even before he created the
[1:10:42] devil and because he wanted a perfect
[1:10:45] fruit a perfect harvest in the fullness
[1:10:49] of time or at the end of time or when
[1:10:53] time runs out because he wanted a
[1:10:56] perfect harvest he put a perfect seed in
[1:11:01] each of the ones that he chose
[1:11:04] hallelujah before the foundation of the
[1:11:07] world honey or take them to bring forth
[1:11:11] perfect fruit in the last days give the
[1:11:14] Lord a shout hallelujah
[1:11:16] Oh glory to God hallelujah no seed no
[1:11:23] fruit perfect scene perfect fruit
[1:11:27] hallelujah praise God amen if you want a
[1:11:31] public fruit they will rise up perfect
[1:11:33] see a man
[1:11:36] praise God so the fruit is a finished
[1:11:40] product amen
[1:11:42] praise God hallelujah let me say Amen
[1:11:47] praise God so when we are talking about
[1:11:50] seeds yes some laws which I call the
[1:11:56] seed laws praise God
[1:11:59] seed laws
[1:12:03] and the first one from Genesis 111 every
[1:12:07] seat must bring forth after its sky give
[1:12:11] the Lord a hand a brace thank you lord
[1:12:14] so whatever we are saying it's right in
[1:12:17] the Bible a man ma a man a mango seed
[1:12:22] brings for a mango fruit a cherry see
[1:12:26] bring forth a cherry fruit
[1:12:30] can we say man me sailors a serpent seed
[1:12:34] bring forth a silver fruit
[1:12:40] hallelujah praise God so whatever is
[1:12:44] locked up inside that seed will
[1:12:47] determine the type of fruit can be say
[1:12:51] man hallelujah but the seed that God
[1:12:54] placed in you before the foundation of
[1:12:56] the world was a perfect see it had
[1:13:00] perfection in it it has eternity in it
[1:13:03] it has the Holy Ghost in it but what
[1:13:07] kind of fruit will you produce fruits
[1:13:10] unto perfection say man a perfect fruit
[1:13:15] hallelujah glory to God amen another
[1:13:26] seed law Luke 8:11 the seed is the word
[1:13:32] of God say man what about says the Word
[1:13:39] of God is a seed say man praise God
[1:13:44] my so when God placed a seed in your
[1:13:48] soul
[1:13:49] was it a word seed was it
[1:13:55] but what I do know is that this bride
[1:13:58] will be a wood bride huh
[1:14:02] isn't it probably is because she has a

[1:41:57] brought a second Adam Jesus Christ born
[1:42:01] outside of sexual desire amen he had to
[1:42:06] come out of the devil's method he meant
[1:42:09] by Bizet a virgin shall conceive they
[1:42:12] men had to come outside of Satan's
[1:42:14] method II Men to restore the standard
[1:42:17] Amen or the original man that Adam was
[1:42:22] before the fall can you say Amen
[1:42:26] anybody sleeping see one I kind of
[1:42:30] closed along there somewhere and I've
[1:42:32] called names
[1:42:33] praise God but God had a plan which he
[1:42:40] pulled us to achieve in three Falls
[1:42:45] and bourbon call it the tree fool
[1:42:48] purpose of God or the tree fault mystery
[1:42:51] of God however you say God simply once
[1:42:56] man back in a perfect state so that he
[1:43:01] can come once again and have fellowship
[1:43:03] with him can we say man praise God now
[1:43:08] the Prophet said that we are living in a
[1:43:11] house soul body in spirit he said that
[1:43:17] is the way God lived in Jesus soul body
[1:43:20] and spirit so we know that in a human
[1:43:24] heart in the center is a little
[1:43:28] compartment where not even my blood cell
[1:43:31] touches the animal heart does not have
[1:43:35] it science says is the occupation of the
[1:43:39] soul that's where God dwells inside a
[1:43:43] heart inside the soul mmm that's where
[1:43:47] he wants occupy to come and occupy the
[1:43:49] throne in your heart this morning amen
[1:43:51] praise God that's where the seed of God
[1:43:55] is placed in there before the foundation
[1:43:57] of the world amen but that seed will
[1:44:02] remain dormant until it is sweetened by
[1:44:07] the Holy Spirit and that's when you are
[1:44:10] reborn or born again hallelujah
[1:44:14] hallelujah
[1:44:17] we did not become seed by the new birth
[1:44:22] but because we were seed therefore we
[1:44:26] can't be reborn can we say man glory
[1:44:32] notice a church member has no seed in
[1:44:38] their soul you have a soul because
[1:44:42] you're a human but there's no seed and
[1:44:46] only elected the ones that are chosen
[1:44:51] are ordained to bring forth fruits have
[1:44:54] a seed and can't be reborn say Amen so
[1:45:03] in the church member there's nothing to
[1:45:06] quit they are just happy to feel the
[1:45:11] anointing the sale was a good message
[1:45:13] but you go out and do their own thing
[1:45:16] they have nothing to do it bearing
[1:45:20] fruits on to perfection they just want
[1:45:25] to be nice good people they just want to
[1:45:29] be a good fruits but not interested in
[1:45:33] being perfect they can't take the cotton
[1:45:37] and the pruning on the shaping but you
[1:45:40] can say man
[1:45:43] hallelujah you can Tina you are not a
[1:45:47] church member he meant you have to know
[1:45:50] that my revelation Amen praise God amen
[1:45:54] so the spirit because the word in you
[1:45:57] and it begins to produce the life from
[1:46:00] inside the seed then your Christian life
[1:46:04] starts to grow now you have just become
[1:46:09] a Christian
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:13] what about themselves after you get the
[1:46:16] Holy Ghost
[1:46:16] then make yourself into a purse then
[1:46:19] give a lot of hard to praise hallelujah
[1:46:23] hallelujah praise God praise God praise
[1:46:29] God praise God praise God praise God
[1:46:32] amen hallelujah hallelujah so God wants
[1:46:38] to bring man back to perfection
[1:46:40] in terms of three fools one God reveals
[1:46:46] himself to the church through Jesus
[1:46:48] Christ to God wants to have the
[1:46:52] preeminence is in his church that he
[1:46:54] might live in us so that Christ will be
[1:46:57] manifested in his church 3 God wants to
[1:47:02] restore the kingdom to its rightful
[1:47:04] position in other words bring the
[1:47:06] original Adam and Eve again made out of
[1:47:09] the same blood and spirit so that we
[1:47:12] could go back to Eden again
[1:47:14] amen amen so now step one is complete
[1:47:19] God has already expressed himself in
[1:47:22] Christ Word made flesh God becoming less
[1:47:28] mysterious more tangible that we can
[1:47:31] handle him hey man he's our kinsman
[1:47:34] redeemer hey man
[1:47:35] great score bharanam said Christ is that
[1:47:38] seed that was produced by the Word of
[1:47:41] God the perfect fruit hey Manny man from
[1:47:47] spoken with his original see God
[1:47:50] manifested himself so perfectly in Jesus
[1:47:53] Christ because he was the seed word the
[1:47:56] germ itself the germ that's inside the
[1:48:00] seed that's the life
[1:48:02] that's the germ the germ is a spirit the
[1:48:06] Germans of water that's Christ can we
[1:48:10] say Amen hallelujah so step one is fear
[1:48:18] amen
[1:48:19] but it is step two where Christ the word
[1:48:24] not a crisis revealed Christ the word
[1:48:27] must come into our flesh and ooze out of
[1:48:31] us Christ was a very word which is God
[1:48:37] in flesh form now that same word Christ
[1:48:43] must become flesh in our lives
[1:48:47] and that's where most of us are amen
[1:48:52] you lord on the praise
[1:48:55] [Music]
[1:49:02] this is where the wood image Christ must
[1:49:06] be formed into you as to take the word
[1:49:10] that's see then you can't expand and
[1:49:12] grow it says give me the word give me
[1:49:17] the word word on top of word something
[1:49:20] in your soul says amen to the word
[1:49:22] because the word see the news agreeing
[1:49:25] with the words being spoken hallelujah

[1:49:31] to tell you to say man that's what he
[1:49:34] does a little encouragement
[1:49:35] praise God but a genuine sees of God
[1:49:39] will already be shouting and saying amen
[1:49:42] to the word hallelujah amen glory
[1:49:50] they may just bear with me a little bit
[1:49:52] again I'm almost ready so the soul is
[1:49:55] redeemed by the blood of Jesus

[2:33:27] time in the precious name of Jesus
[2:33:30] Christ and the church says
[2:33:32] man you may be seated come oh Jesus
[2:33:44] in the book of st. Matthew chapter 16
[2:33:48] one of the most notable chapters in the
[2:33:52] book of Matthew prior to Matthew 16 the
[2:33:59] disciples had been with Jesus but it was
[2:34:02] not very clear as to what their
[2:34:04] understanding of who he was really was
[2:34:08] so he ventured to ask a question who do
[2:34:12] men say I am and they responded with the
[2:34:16] best of their knowledge with the best of
[2:34:17] their ability with the deepest of the
[2:34:20] revelation that they had in the sea some
[2:34:22] say you are this some say uija lies some
[2:34:26] say and it was all good things and Jesus
[2:34:29] went beyond that and posed the question
[2:34:32] to the individuals who do you say that I
[2:34:35] am you've been with me you've been to
[2:34:37] services you have seen me preach you
[2:34:39] have seen miracles now based on what you
[2:34:41] have seen and what do you experience who
[2:34:44] do you say that I am and there were
[2:34:46] silence Peter responded thou are the
[2:34:49] Christ and Jesus said to him flesh and
[2:34:53] blood did not reveal this to you but my
[2:34:55] father in heaven but as we progress
[2:34:59] through that scripture in Matthew 16
[2:35:01] it's the first time Jesus opens up to
[2:35:05] them and tells them what's about to
[2:35:07] happen and then he speaks one of the
[2:35:09] most pivotal scriptures in Christendom
[2:35:12] if I could say that and and as brother
[2:35:15] Stephen was speaking he asks the
[2:35:17] question how can I die
[2:35:20] how can I die Hogan Hawking little me
[2:35:23] become smaller and smaller until Christ
[2:35:26] becomes visible what can I do every day
[2:35:31] what do I do in the morning and lunch
[2:35:34] them an evening on Monday or Tuesday or
[2:35:36] Wednesday and Thursday to make sure that
[2:35:38] that Christ can become visible so 1 lakh
[2:35:40] and look into the mirror of the world
[2:35:42] and see Jesus looking back at me and
[2:35:46] jesus said to his disciples in Matthew 6
[2:35:49] he was 24 he said if any man any man
[2:35:52] will come after me let him deny himself
[2:35:57] and take up his cross and follow me
[2:36:02] and whoever or whosoever shall save his
[2:36:06] life shall lose it and whoever whosoever
[2:36:11] shall lose his life for my sake shall
[2:36:13] find it and then he asks a question
[2:36:16] that's supposed to be the great
[2:36:18] equalizer for what is a man profited if
[2:36:21] he shall gain the whole world and lose
[2:36:24] his own soul and he brings it even more
[2:36:28] personal or what shall a man give in
[2:36:30] exchange for his soul and as where the
[2:36:35] stephan1 speaking this script it jumped
[2:36:37] out at me and I said I want to share it
[2:36:39] with the church because there are a lot
[2:36:42] of people trying to save their lives
[2:36:45] you work hard to see in your life
[2:36:47] because that's how you think you're
[2:36:49] gonna see or come out of the situation
[2:36:51] that you're in you wanna work harder you
[2:36:54] wanna do this you wanna you struggle to
[2:36:56] do this and and in the process of trying
[2:36:59] to save it your way you are losing it
[2:37:02] but Jesus made it claims there is any
[2:37:05] man
[2:37:06] who come after me let him deny himself
[2:37:09] and that there is where the death takes
[2:37:12] place where you deny yourself
[2:37:15] so as you're about to do something you
[2:37:18] ask yourself is this really me or is
[2:37:21] this the word and it is not a word you
[2:37:24] deny yourself
[2:37:28] that's how you die everyday by giving up
[2:37:34] the things that you want to do giving up
[2:37:38] the things that maybe you love to do and
[2:37:40] in doing so you make room for Claude to
[2:37:43] step in and direct how you should move
[2:37:46] how you should act and that's what
[2:37:49] perfection is because Christ directed
[2:37:52] service when he is in the control tower
[2:37:54] of your soul and he has control of the
[2:37:57] steering wheel of the car of your life
[2:38:00] this should not be a battle for the
[2:38:03] steering wheel Jesus shouldn't be
[2:38:06] pulling left and you are pulling right
[2:38:07] he should have total control
[2:38:10] there's no need of a backseat driver
[2:38:12] when Jesus is driving there's no need of
[2:38:15] a side driver when Jesus is driving
[2:38:18] Jesus doesn't need directions
[2:38:21] turn left turn left don't know is the
[2:38:22] second house on the right turn after
[2:38:24] that Jesus doesn't need directions he
[2:38:26] knows where everything is he knows where
[2:38:29] your blessing is he knows what time you
[2:38:31] need to get to your destination and he
[2:38:34] will never be late he will always be on
[2:38:37] time so let Jesus Drive the car of your
[2:38:40] life deny yourself let go of the
[2:38:45] steering wheel let go of the controls
[2:38:49] relax in his presence let him take the
[2:38:53] wheel put your hands up in the air say
[2:38:56] lord I give it to you
[2:38:58] I let go I let go I heard a testimony
[2:39:04] one time keep playing this if a guy who
[2:39:08] was driving very very fast he said was
[2:39:12] very late he was trying to get home and
[2:39:15] he said he may have started a drifter
[2:39:18] sleeping when he caught himself his car
[2:39:21] was just going out of control
[2:39:24] he said his human mind didn't know what
[2:39:27] to do so he just lifted his hand and
[2:39:30] said Lord take over and he said he
[2:39:33] cannot explain what happened he can't
[2:39:36] explain what happened next but he found
[2:39:39] himself back at the side of the road how
[2:39:41] do you explain stuff like and I don't
[2:39:45] know what condition you are going to
[2:39:46] right now and many of us our lives such
[2:39:49] as turning out of control when you are
[2:39:54] out of control there's one solution I
[2:39:56] will never feel put your hands up and
[2:39:58] say Lord fix it
[2:40:01] Lord fix it
[2:40:04] because you didn't place the seed in
[2:40:06] your soul you couldn't put it a he put
[2:40:10] the seed in your soul and all God wants
[2:40:13] and every service is designed to catch
[2:40:16] your attention so that for a few minutes
[2:40:20] you can focus on him as well the black
[2:40:25] man said when you take care of his
[2:40:27] business
[2:40:27] he'll Teke of yours he said seek ye
[2:40:31] first the kingdom of God and His
[2:40:34] righteousness and every other thing will
[2:40:36] be added unto you
[2:40:37] can we give the Lord a hand upraised you
[2:40:40] love him this morning will you serve him
[2:40:43] this morning will you worship him this
[2:40:46] morning give the Lord a shout of praise

[2:41:16] service let's see what the Lord will do
[2:41:18] for us tonight
[2:41:20] maintenance Group one police metered by
[2:41:24] the puffle after the second service to
[2:41:26] handle the cleaning of the church and
[2:41:28] from Addis even on behalf of the
[2:41:31] ministry my general reminder for
[2:41:34] contribution to the maintenance fund is
[2:41:37] a box located under the staircase
[2:41:39] towards the maintenance of the property
[2:41:42] and very important there'll be I want to
[2:41:48] call it a youth oriented service not a
[2:41:52] youth service because we don't want it
[2:41:55] limited by age in any way if the entire
[2:42:01] church could be there that's what we
[2:42:02] want
[2:42:03] button Saturday the 16th of September
[2:42:06] that's not this Saturday the following
[2:42:08] Saturday at 5 p.m. we want to have a
[2:42:11] youth oriented service and there are a
[2:42:15] lot of believers in the church who have
[2:42:20] a burden for the young people and they
[2:42:23] are others sadly who have no burden no
[2:42:26] interest in what takes place
[2:42:30] you know and whether Daly was speaking
[2:42:32] last week and he said the very sign that
[2:42:35] those who are under the altar would not
[2:42:37] bride he said they were crying for
[2:42:39] vengeance
[2:42:41] there is a nature that is attached to
[2:42:45] the seed in your soul that seed has
[2:42:48] certain behaviors that come with the
[2:42:51] seed as the seed begins to blossom and
[2:42:54] bring forth and expand and in its
[2:42:57] evolution if I can use the word towards
[2:42:59] bringing forth fruit but in your souls
[2:43:02] that have a burden you don't have to
[2:43:04] have kids to have a burden for young
[2:43:05] people
[2:43:07] if your children are not in church
[2:43:09] doesn't mean you have no burden I
[2:43:13] challenge you to catch a button I heard
[2:43:17] a preacher say recently people people
[2:43:20] don't like prayer meetings because they
[2:43:22] don't pray enough they don't know what
[2:43:25] to pray for if you don't know what to
[2:43:27] pray for for yourself pretty for the
[2:43:30] young people because what the young
[2:43:32] people have to go through us all on and
[2:43:36] I consider myself now and all the one
[2:43:37] we've never had to go through that so
[2:43:40] catch a burden for the young people that
[2:43:42] God could give them an experience with
[2:43:44] the supernatural because without an
[2:43:47] experience it's impossible to last but
[2:43:51] it's even said it in your human flesh
[2:43:52] you are no match for the devil it takes
[2:43:55] more than your intellect it takes more
[2:43:58] than you planning it takes more than
[2:44:00] your effort to make it it takes God
[2:44:02] Himself to pour fire so poorly on the
[2:44:07] seed for you to come to life and we are
[2:44:10] praying that God will lose something
[2:44:12] special for the young people and I'm
[2:44:14] charging you with the responsibility to
[2:44:17] spread the word about the youth service
[2:44:19] and every service you have
[2:44:21] responsibility that's part of our
[2:44:22] Christian walk in the book of Acts said
[2:44:25] be witnesses go into all the world and
[2:44:28] preach the gospel
[2:44:31] I challenge you call somebody up why did
[2:44:35] you miss service today call somebody I'm
[2:44:38] calling to make sure you'll be in next
[2:44:39] service we are our brother's keeper it's
[2:44:43] our responsibility but brother Isaac I
[2:44:48] really make it myself I was trying to
[2:44:52] encourage anybody else do you know when

[2:45:34] situation and go beyond yourself
