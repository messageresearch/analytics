[22:36] God this morning as always
[22:41] and what a timeless sees me living in we
[22:48] head into uncharted waters is that in
[22:51] something and this morning I went along
[22:54] so Joann Leo - I know she was here
[22:57] before - could you stand CP fellowship
[22:59] among us here god bless you and also
[23:04] Ricardo Alexis son Oh bless you my
[23:08] brother
[23:09] I don't know if you remember him he came
[23:12] here with some long hair right on his
[23:13] back the rostrum I didn't recognize when
[23:16] he cut that here so that means God is
[23:18] dealing with him and you thank God for
[23:21] that when you see people acting upon
[23:24] what they hear is it give a real or
[23:27] something ok so you know if I'm not
[23:31] going directly into the scriptures after
[23:34] me Jesse right
[23:35] normally I would just read scriptures
[23:38] but I just want to mention about well
[23:42] you see how you already have a case in
[23:45] Trinidad with a virus and so on and I
[23:50] don't know where to get a name virus
[23:53] from but I think it has to do something
[23:56] but viral win viral - in terms of the
[23:59] virus is something that want to
[24:01] perpetuate itself it want to grow it
[24:04] want to spread is one two shades poison
[24:08] and I have no respect for his country
[24:14] doesn't care what kind gender doesn't
[24:16] matter that is what I was thinking about
[24:20] that that this virus is nothing going
[24:25] wherever you want to go they are loyal
[24:27] to take him and I was thinking about the
[24:29] opposite of that I was wondering if
[24:33] people got infected but the whole eco I
[24:37] wonder what will happen overnight I
[24:41] wonder if that could go to every nation
[24:43] all peoples just the Holy Ghost and fire
[24:47] lilies the prophets in the Holy Ghost
[24:49] walk across the world overnight I am
[24:51] believe that I believe that all my heart
[24:53] now this virus could be tested they do
[24:58] have the cure the dollar vaccine by the
[25:00] Knesset
[25:01] and this Holy Ghost could also be
[25:04] still isn't that something
[25:08] this whole he goes to be tested too you
[25:10] know hallelujah though this virus
[25:13] because is one virus is not to one tree
[25:16] is one haven't named it - I have an
[25:19] infant but Israeli a demon that invadin
[25:26] bodies knockin all old people taking our
[25:31] lives but this whole egos the Spirit of
[25:34] God looking to invade bodies - looking
[25:38] for houses looking for heart and a life
[25:41] and if virus could knock a man down and
[25:44] take him out why the Holy Ghost can
[25:46] strike you and bring you up
[25:49] [Music]
[25:55] we still we still development two forces
[25:59] and two kingdoms and every battle and
[26:02] every issue is connected by those two
[26:05] forces until Kangnam I don't have a tell
[26:07] patty there's only two parties in this
[26:09] matter and you're under the influence of
[26:12] one or the other
[26:13] and I dare you today to believe that we
[26:16] are under the influence of the Holy
[26:18] Ghost I dare you to believe you are
[26:23] under the influence of divine leadership
[26:27] [Music]
[26:31] hallelujah hallelujah glory praise the
[26:37] name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah
[26:40] and the virus is programmed to multiply
[26:45] it's included to multiply not the state
[26:48] by self in a corner the virus intend to
[26:51] spread and when Jesus calls 12 disciples
[26:54] and fill the matter holy was in power he
[26:57] said going to all the world and in fact
[26:59] and call em sons

[31:01] realm was not two men was two powers was
[31:04] two forces the Holy Ghost behind David
[31:07] and the devil behind Goliath and we said
[31:09] the lab was a principal spirit
[31:11] challenging the armies of the Living God

[31:17] he will not let up if the devil you have
[31:20] one on you he will Jam you as much as he

[34:15] Hebrews 10:1 a read from verse 1 to 14
[34:19] and first Corinthians chapter 1 with
[34:22] something 229 it's kind of mind-blowing
[34:25] oh we get here but we are here we still
[34:30] have no fear Hebrews 10 1 2 14 and let's
[34:37] read see what we have yet for the law
[34:42] having a shadow of good things to come
[34:43] and not the very image of the things can
[34:46] never with those sacrifices which they
[34:50] offer year by year continually make the
[34:52] comers they aren't too perfect for then
[34:55] would it not have ceased to be offered
[34:57] because that the worshipper once purged
[35:00] should have no more conscious of but in
[35:03] those sacrifices there is a remembrance
[35:04] again made of sins every year for it is
[35:08] not possible that the blood of bulls and
[35:11] goats should take away sins aware for
[35:13] when he commits unto the world he said
[35:15] sacrifice and offering don't word it's
[35:17] not but a body has not prepared me in
[35:19] burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin
[35:21] though has had no pleasure but ice then
[35:23] said i lo i come in the volume of the
[35:25] book it is written of me to do thy will
[35:27] O God above when he said sacrifice and
[35:30] offerings and burnt offerings and
[35:32] offering for sin though it is not
[35:34] neither hats pleasure Darren which was
[35:37] offered by the law then said he lo I
[35:41] come to do thy will O God he take away
[35:44] the first that he may establish the
[35:47] second by the which will we are
[35:50] sanctified through the offering of the
[35:53] body of Jesus Christ once for all and
[35:58] every priest standard daily ministering
[36:01] an off time offering of time the same
[36:04] sacrifice which can never take away sins
[36:06] but this man after he had offered one
[36:10] sacrifice for sins forever sat down on
[36:14] the right hand of God from henceforth
[36:17] expect him till his enemies be made his
[36:20] footstool for by one offering he are
[36:24] perfected for
[36:25] dim that are sanctified honey wanna read
[36:29] from first Corinthians chapter 1 verse
[36:37] 17 Paul speaks for Christ set me not to
[36:41] baptize but to preach the gospel not
[36:43] with wisdom of words lease the cross of
[36:48] Christ should be made of none effect on
[36:51] the line that in your heart lease the
[36:55] cross of Christ should be made of none
[36:58] effect for the preaching of the Cross is
[37:00] to them that perish foolishness but unto
[37:03] us which are saved it is the power of
[37:07] God for it is written I have the sheet I
[37:10] will destroy the wisdom of the wise and
[37:13] I will bring to nothing the
[37:15] understanding of the prudent where is
[37:18] the wise where is the scribe where is
[37:21] the disputer of this world hath not God
[37:23] made foolish the wisdom of this world
[37:25] for after that in the wisdom of God the
[37:28] world by wisdom knew not god it pleased
[37:30] God by the foolishness of preaching to
[37:34] save them that believe for the Jews
[37:37] require a sign and the Greeks seek after
[37:40] wisdom but we preach Christ crucified
[37:42] unto the Jews a stumbling-block under
[37:46] the Greeks foolishness but unto them
[37:48] which are called both Jews and Greeks
[37:50] Christ the power of God and the wisdom
[37:54] of God because the foolishness of God is
[37:57] wiser than men and the weakness of God
[38:00] is stronger than men for you see your
[38:03] calling brethren how that not many wise
[38:05] men after the flesh not many mighty not
[38:08] many noble a call but God had chosen the
[38:11] foolish things of the world to confound
[38:12] it - wise and God hath chosen the weak
[38:16] things of the world to confound the
[38:18] things which are mighty and the base
[38:19] things of the world and the things that
[38:21] are despised had God chosen he things
[38:24] which are not to bring to nought things

[46:08] your hands I will constantly pray
[46:12] constantly until you fill me with
[46:16] sweetness and goodness of the Spirit
[46:19] I offer my prayer for you now as we
[46:23] borrow his and that he begins to pray
[46:25] you see our Heavenly Father they are
[46:28] trophies of your presence they know that
[46:31] these words are true because they are
[46:33] yours they know that they have been give
[46:36] by the Holy Spirit because they are the
[46:38] wood of God and they have been convinced
[46:40] that they need you
[46:42] that they need sweetness of the Holy
[46:44] Spirit in their life to give them
[46:46] overcoming power and they will receive
[46:49] power from on high
[46:51] receive the power to live a Christian
[46:54] life to receive power to overcome
[46:57] temptations as the song we just singing
[47:00] they gathered in the upper room and was
[47:03] trained in his name they were baptized
[47:06] with the Holy Ghost and powerful service
[47:09] came and at what they want powerful
[47:11] service to come upon them
[47:12] I pray thee father as your servant as
[47:15] you have seen them reason their hands
[47:17] that they have made a pledge to you and
[47:19] a promise a day shall never cease they
[47:22] will not lead a sight but they will pray
[47:25] until you fill them Lord to a satisfying
[47:28] portion of the holy presence in their
[47:31] life
[47:32] I offer my prayer in their behalf Lord
[47:34] as your servant that they'll be filled
[47:37] with the Holy Ghost Lord I pray they
[47:39] will not leave this church until that
[47:41] happens that will be right there under
[47:43] each soul it's filled with the Holy
[47:45] Ghost granted Lord doe-eyed God the
[47:48] Almighty he was manifested in the flesh
[47:50] to take away the sins of the world
[47:52] you rose on Eternia cells on high and
[47:54] you are here tonight among us and in the
[47:58] name of the Holy Spirit we pray father
[48:00] that your precious Lord you will fill
[48:02] each one of them with your own self and
[48:05] may they be a blessing to your kingdom
[48:07] and in the world that is to come and one
[48:11] day when you finally see another Road
[48:13] maybe today yet we don't know whether
[48:16] we'll be but may I be able Lord to be
[48:19] counted among those who go in the
[48:20] rapture may these be the ones that go in
[48:23] the rapture may every person and divine
[48:25] presence that's forbidden spirit belongs
[48:27] to you go into the rapture they are
[48:29] yours no I commit them to thee so this
[48:32] path to the Holy Ghost another imaginary
[48:34] thing it's not a distant thing it's a
[48:37] promise that God mean and it's a promise
[48:39] for you
[48:40] it is something to happen to you and
[48:42] happen in you and that is your please
[48:45] note
[48:46] if you believe this Laurita got the new
[48:49] bird you have to have the new but by
[48:51] being believe in Allah Jesus Christ my
[48:54] having faith and accept him as their
[48:55] Savior
[48:56] that's bit because you are passed from
[48:58] death unto life and if you want to
[49:00] scripture he said send John 5:24 he that
[49:03] hear my words and believe it on him that
[49:05] sent me has everlasting life see he's
[49:07] got life because he believes no watch
[49:09] but the Holy Ghost is power for service
[49:13] so when you talk about your gut to be
[49:16] born again and I pilots at the Holy
[49:18] Ghost many of the Methodism so forth
[49:19] along the air Cannady it won't cope with
[49:23] true the scripture you getting sideways

[49:37] forth but they had to have the Holy
[49:38] Ghost for power you shall be witnesses
[49:41] unto me after the Holy Ghost come upon
[49:44] you because the Holy Ghost is a witness
[49:47] of the resurrection show in you have
[49:50] become an adult in Christ I think I want
[49:56] to say that again the Holy Ghost is a
[49:58] witness of the resurrection showing that
[50:02] you have become an adult in Christ and
[50:04] it's Wesley hadn't stepped out on the
[50:06] word and got a bad name and was called a
[50:09] crazy man and everything else he would
[50:11] have never be able to achieve but Wesley
[50:13] was one of God quits scientists Luther
[50:16] was one of great Godwin scientists and
[50:17] they didn't care what the churches said
[50:21] what the organization said Luther didn't
[50:24] care what the Catholics said he just
[50:27] believed the trust shall live by faith
[50:29] and he took God's chemicals of the world

[1:02:09] bruised for our iniquities the
[1:02:11] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:02:13] and with His stripes were healed and all
[1:02:15] we like sheep have gone astray not some
[1:02:21] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[1:02:25] have telling everyone it is always and
[1:02:28] the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of
[1:02:32] us all of us all of us all the issue
[1:02:41] today the sin that is why we needed a
[1:02:44] savior because she was still sin that is
[1:02:48] why we need a tournament the issue is
[1:02:51] still sing of Calvary or cattle or - oh
[1:02:56] if you could save yourself
[1:02:59] he did not go to the cross if you could
[1:03:02] do it yourself you did not even have to
[1:03:04] go to the cross but because you can do
[1:03:06] it
[1:03:07] because they couldn't get back because
[1:03:09] they wouldn't come back to God somebody
[1:03:11] mess away

[1:03:57] blood he has perfected forever them that
[1:04:08] are sanctified so in other words this

[1:04:16] your sins and remembering your sin that
[1:04:17] yes sinner and you see when you come
[1:04:19] back on your sin and as soon as they say

[1:09:34] eternal Redemption because Jesus was a
[1:09:36] Balaam Abel offered to God a more
[1:09:40] excellent sacrifice so this sacrifice
[1:09:43] that even offered was a witness of the
[1:09:46] perfect land that was coming all the

[1:10:48] years last twenty years if you push if
[1:10:51] you push it now you'll recognize it
[1:10:52] wasn't saved last year or last twenty
[1:10:54] years ago you know you were saying
[1:10:56] before there was a moon before there was
[1:10:58] a star before I was a molecule before
[1:11:00] you were even born
[1:11:02] ah
[1:11:03] [Music]
[1:11:03] [Applause]
[1:11:08] glories glory to God salvation is not
[1:11:13] from time salvation from eternity
[1:11:17] brother would put your name on the
[1:11:20] Lamb's Book of Life or glory to God or
[1:11:24] you think Jesus finding one of the well
[1:11:25] you think Jesus googled me where that
[1:11:37] woman name is normal it can find that
[1:11:40] because we call a woman at a well I
[1:11:44] don't know what was the title
[1:11:45] I guess the Bible leave it that way
[1:11:48] first leave her like that woman I do
[1:11:51] well maybe she named Mary Ann will you
[1:11:59] mean you would I mean freed a free
[1:12:02] charge is not a name but whatever name
[1:12:06] she had she was not known by that name
[1:12:09] died Jesus her name was in the book not
[1:12:16] not the name your mother giving your
[1:12:21] name is in the world so he was sent to
[1:12:24] call that name notice he was not
[1:12:27] intimidated by her condition he was not
[1:12:30] mystified by how she could live with all
[1:12:32] these men in the war never is not her
[1:12:34] know that was the issue the issue was
[1:12:37] given a call because once the seed in
[1:12:41] her he had the voice was the seed in you
[1:12:45] get a voice there's only one voice and
[1:12:49] was the voice of God Jesus confidently
[1:12:54] said all that the father had given me
[1:12:58] shall come
[1:13:01] not if not perhaps not the devil stand a
[1:13:06] chance
[1:13:06] the devil has aa chance with all that
[1:13:09] the father hacked you my decision
[1:13:16] because what the father had given Jesus
[1:13:19] was before the devil was created what
[1:13:22] did that wonder what the devil what God
[1:13:24] did Jesus was before there was even the
[1:13:26] beginning so when Jesus caught you was
[1:13:30] before the beginning let me hit that no
[1:13:38] no no no allow us before he was caught
[1:13:41] he would be gotten of him one y'know
[1:13:46] before he was brought because it became
[1:13:51] God in the beginning
[1:13:52] when he created the angels to worship
[1:13:55] Him that made him God and mousses always
[1:13:58] pocket attacked but before he was God he
[1:14:03] was ill him and he was part of him come
[1:14:08] on oh come on a girl or - OH
[1:14:10] [Applause]
[1:14:19] Laurie so you are first rights in this
[1:14:24] battle or glory of God you can't get a
[1:14:29] johnny-come-lately who came in the
[1:14:31] beginning and you were to yet before the
[1:14:33] beginning you were telling this thinking
[1:14:36] or chlorine ago that's my quoted
[1:14:38] prophesy the people that know that God
[1:14:41] shall be strong
[1:14:43] how do great exploits or poor you
[1:14:47] between us from right here let me drop
[1:14:54] another bomb from you we are part of the
[1:14:58] spirits that rotated out of God that did
[1:15:02] not fall
[1:15:03] [Applause]
[1:15:11] let me see them so God put in you of the
[1:15:17] feast anointing a free spirit
[1:15:21] is already built-in born to conquer
[1:15:25] notice when Samson let that little boy
[1:15:28] him to the post times lesser God may I
[1:15:31] uh
[1:15:32] pressure Sakana Prerna he's gonna avenge
[1:15:36] me once more
[1:15:37] hallelujah Samson knew he had direct
[1:15:40] access he felt the seven locks he fed
[1:15:44] them seven thunders he felt them seven
[1:15:47] voices he seldom seven virtues they
[1:15:50] wanted understandable diverges at all
[1:15:55] there were no connection they weren't
[1:15:58] alive here and interact here but when
[1:16:01] you put it together his word and spirit
[1:16:04] that's why he said what we see should
[1:16:07] make a church that would make a revival
[1:16:09] and we can say the seven thunders is
[1:16:13] being manifest I not talking about
[1:16:16] mystery truths I am talking about
[1:16:18] manifestation of the truth seven choose
[1:16:23] several mysteries seven voices
[1:16:28] [Applause]
[1:16:30] maybe see that you can explain my
[1:16:34] manifestation Anna beat up as he
[1:16:36] couldn't say any name
[1:16:37] he was fisherman he wasn't a University
[1:16:40] grad he was a fisherman but when that

[1:20:18] they're not interested in living it
[1:20:19] they interested in debate in it so they

[1:22:17] hoax we go in for them call it proof
[1:22:27] every man would be alive copper
[1:22:30] syndicated would to be true oh my
[1:22:33] hallelujah glory to God are you ready no
[1:22:38] matter how well we are taught how well
[1:22:41] we believe how much the Bible says is
[1:22:44] true and believe it all true it's got to
[1:22:47] be the dynamics have got to be dear for
[1:22:50] the spark to set the wood of fire and
[1:22:53] get it to start rolling it's got to have
[1:22:57] it no matter if you don't yet the church
[1:22:59] said still the car said still you will
[1:23:04] sit still without the dynamics without
[1:23:08] their spirit
[1:23:09] everybody said still oh my hallelujah so

[1:23:21] big truth of God go to move in is got to
[1:23:23] take the mechanics here we go with the
[1:23:25] dynamics nothing is wrong with the
[1:23:27] mechanics but lacking dynamics and I
[1:23:31] think that's what the matter with the
[1:23:32] church today we lack the dynamical power
[1:23:35] to press the word and make it live for
[1:23:37] this day so it doesn't matter hold right
[1:23:42] somebody is in the doctrine where is he
[1:23:44] dynamics to press the word to make the
[1:23:46] world seven lives because that's what we
[1:23:49] want the world to live the word to walk
[1:23:52] or the page of the Bible manifests
[1:23:53] itself the see cancer defeated listen
[1:23:56] every action of Jesus was to expose the
[1:23:59] sit-ins kingdom when he cast out devils
[1:24:01] it expose it only in them the maniac man
[1:24:03] he exposes the kingdom he raised the
[1:24:06] girl from the dead he exposes and
[1:24:07] Kingdom the show life is more powerful
[1:24:10] than that he called Lazarus from the
[1:24:11] grave he exposed Satan's Kingdom the
[1:24:14] only clickity of the depth he has no
[1:24:17] power beyond that that's why he cannot
[1:24:20] stop Jesus because she has really some
[1:24:21] but that your tequila dead man or glory
[1:24:25] down there already
[1:24:26] he is rose from the dead he is risen
[1:24:29] from the dead or close he's alive if the
[1:24:32] Devils are like jesus is alive I wanted
[1:24:34] to understand that if the devil is alive
[1:24:39] Jesus is more alive
[1:24:42] and he wants to vindicate himself he
[1:24:45] wants to confirm this word in your life
[1:24:47] you want to prove he's the same
[1:24:49] yesterday than forever you want to
[1:24:50] vindicate himself assign them one of the
[1:24:52] miracle that's his glory Oh hallelujah
[1:24:56] that's his glory or glory if I don't
[1:24:58] want no picture no light behind the
[1:25:00] pulpit here I don't want that I don't
[1:25:01] know the glory of God it's signs and
[1:25:03] wonders and miracles he sent us here
[1:25:06] before you are you ready
[1:25:10] Martin Luther had mechanical dynamics
[1:25:13] for his day
[1:25:13] John Wesley had them the pentecostal had
[1:25:16] them in their day
[1:25:17] what about our day this is another time
[1:25:20] the church should be fully grown now
[1:25:22] ready to go I'll meet Christ with the
[1:25:25] manifestation of every blessing that he
[1:25:26] promised operating at one great body
[1:25:29] where he promised he would meet the
[1:25:31] people and be worship you mean crisis
[1:25:34] still to be yes he said when
[1:25:36] the thunders begin to manifest itself
[1:25:37] then your worship in the Living Christ
[1:25:39] him moving in and out among us I want
[1:25:42] him to move in here this morning I began
[1:25:45] to heal people and see your people and
[1:25:47] deliver people I can deliver what Jesus
[1:25:50] the deliverer
[1:25:50] I can't hear but he can heal you Oh
[1:25:53] Gloria caught he could free you Oh
[1:25:55] doodlee that Oh glory to God here we go
[1:25:59] we see nations breaking Israel awake men
[1:26:02] the signs that this Bible 4:12 for this
[1:26:04] day we see the mechanical things taking
[1:26:06] place
[1:26:06] now the spirit here we go love this the
[1:26:09] dynamics of that promise word to kept
[1:26:13] into his church and drive them to
[1:26:16] Calvary under under the rapture all but
[1:26:20] over before we go to the rapture we have
[1:26:22] a stop yeah
[1:26:26] I thought we just compensation consumed
[1:26:28] the rapture no no no you have a stop he
[1:26:31] said the dynamics of the promise would
[1:26:34] has to get in the church and drive them
[1:26:38] because they're not volunteering to go
[1:26:40] ahead the payments had to disappear
[1:26:44] inside here nobody up could you
[1:26:51] show me the direction to Calvary anybody
[1:26:54] knows I want to get there quickly
[1:26:57] no I ain't seen anybody line up asking
[1:27:01] for that direction
[1:27:03] that's why I see the dynamics of the
[1:27:07] promise world after comment of the
[1:27:09] church and change them push them
[1:27:15] [Music]
[1:27:16] people don't want to die if season only
[1:27:24] knew that beat up afflicted man that we
[1:27:29] clicking man you had to get some way to
[1:27:32] help him it across struggling it see
[1:27:34] them only knew his power was about to be
[1:27:37] busted and broken
[1:27:38] you never let him get that licks because
[1:27:41] all his wings he was wounded for our
[1:27:43] transgression all his booze and was for
[1:27:46] our iniquities he wasn't taking his
[1:27:48] licks for himself I saw you and me
[1:27:50] because he know really healing and her
[1:27:53] stripes produced that Oh glory to God
[1:27:57] hallelujah hallelujah when again the cry
[1:28:00] fam he said away from me we fear
[1:28:01] children Oh glory to God hallelujah
[1:28:05] qapla all before that he sprained even
[1:28:08] it's possible let this cup pass he is
[1:28:11] struggling that battle in his mind but
[1:28:13] when he busts through he it was finished
[1:28:16] he was determined to make it to Calvary
[1:28:19] all glory to God hallelujah and where
[1:28:23] banham says he says okay that day was so
[1:28:27] important it was one of the greatest
[1:28:29] days he said the one great importantly
[1:28:31] at Calvary means to us under the world
[1:28:33] it's settled the sin question once and
[1:28:36] for all
[1:28:36] man was found guilty of sin and sin was
[1:28:40] a penalty that no man could pay the
[1:28:43] penalty was so great until there wasn't
[1:28:45] anyone could pay the penalty and I truly
[1:28:47] believe God ordained it that way that
[1:28:49] the penalty would be so great that no
[1:28:51] man could pay it that he could do it
[1:28:53] himself
[1:28:53] now if the penalty was of sin was death
[1:28:56] and we were all born in sin and shape
[1:28:58] iniquity come to earth speaking lies
[1:29:00] therefore there was none of us was
[1:29:02] worthy or they could find no one on it
[1:29:04] that was worthy and sin did not stack
[1:29:06] and sin started in heaven Lucifer the
[1:29:10] terror was a condemned creature for his
[1:29:12] disobedience before he ever struck the
[1:29:14] earth sin began in heaven where court
[1:29:17] put the Angels upon the same basis that
[1:29:20] he put human beings on knowledge the
[1:29:23] tree of knowledge or the Tree of Life
[1:29:25] where you have to make your choice so
[1:29:29] the study
[1:29:30] in just had a choice whether to follow
[1:29:34] in obedience or listen to another voice
[1:29:36] you have a choice
[1:29:39] guys what make God so perfect he give us
[1:29:42] choices and nobody season actually he's
[1:29:44] not gonna force you you have to choose
[1:29:50] you have to choose whether you're gonna
[1:29:53] go all the way I want to see something
[1:29:56] walk lorida let's go watch
[1:30:00] so when sin struck the earth back in the
[1:30:05] beginning like a sheet of blackness
[1:30:07] fallen upon the heavens it literally
[1:30:10] paralyzed it it showed every creature
[1:30:13] any good all of Ag all creation and
[1:30:14] bondage man was under bondage of debt
[1:30:17] sickness trouble sorrows all nature of
[1:30:21] elevated sin was anesthetic anesthetic
[1:30:24] that actually paralyzed the earth and
[1:30:26] when we set a hopeless cause every
[1:30:28] creature note was subject to it everyone
[1:30:30] born on earth was subjugated so it had
[1:30:32] to come from someplace where there was
[1:30:33] no sin it could not come from the earth
[1:30:36] one could not redeem the other Oh glory
[1:30:39] to God so that's why the prophecy for
[1:30:41] Messiah had to come a full change shall
[1:30:42] conceive so wanted to bring the egg and
[1:30:45] sperm outside the realm of human or
[1:30:48] Gloria caught but he had to be a kinsman
[1:30:50] so he had to go through the baby process
[1:30:52] to become one of us to become a big
[1:30:54] brother to be kinsman redeemer to us you
[1:30:57] have to come down as a man the world is
[1:30:59] made fresh until among us to pay the
[1:31:01] price answer the devil's question Oh
[1:31:03] glory to God who will pay
[1:31:06] so what Oh give the Lord a show know
[1:31:15] where we get an average true with all
[1:31:17] the price being paid know where we could
[1:31:19] get back
[1:31:20] hallelujah and joy all I'm struggling
[1:31:23] ever man die shall he live again the
[1:31:25] mystery beyond death hidden and
[1:31:30] originally wasn't supposed to die there
[1:31:33] is no need of resurrection we wasn't
[1:31:35] supposed to get all we are supposed to
[1:31:37] be stayin young living forever that was
[1:31:41] the original

[1:58:18] was forgiven when Jesus Calvary
[1:58:26] are you still with me but it will never
[1:58:30] do you any good until you accept it you
[1:58:34] have got to accept it then it becomes
[1:58:36] your personal property then you can get
[1:58:40] down there the altar you don't
[1:58:42] necessarily have to come but I believe
[1:58:44] in altars get on the altar you could cry
[1:58:46] you could pray you could walk up and

[1:58:51] you say you have to believe that you are
[1:58:54] saved until you believe you have to
[1:58:57] believe and when you really believe no
[1:58:58] matter if you are the altar or out in
[1:59:00] the street wherever it is when you
[1:59:01] believe it and accept it then it becomes
[1:59:04] your personal property a gift of God by
[1:59:08] grace oh my hallelujah oh my this is a
