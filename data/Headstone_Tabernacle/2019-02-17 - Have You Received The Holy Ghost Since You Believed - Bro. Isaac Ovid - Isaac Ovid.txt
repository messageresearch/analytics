and the church says and the church says amen amen you may be seated hallelujah are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning I believe anything could happen anything could happen you think I could play anointing fall on me we had a blessed time with the young people yesterday but those that were here and I touched on something that we shared with the officers last week I see on people what do you own what is yours what belongs to you because the Bible says in Psalms 24 the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein so caught into this Bible everything belongs to God it's not your card and brought you here this morning it's God's car he owns it he has entrusted you with it that you have custody over it but it's his it's not your house is his house set his grace provided for you that you could have a place to put your head at night but it is your time is not your time it's his time and we are living on his time the food that you eat what you have it's his all belongs to him the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof the trees belong to him the shirt that you are wearing belongs to him the seat that you're sitting on belongs to him the person was next to you belongs to him everything belongs to him and that gives us a reason to thank him because we have not earned anything we didn't work for anything he provided everything the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof and for this we are glad this morning because he has provided a room a space of grace in time for us to give Him praise with him for us to give him glory for us a thank him for what he has and in Stubing an is a powder to in your life that you didn't even realize can the church name and we shared with young people that God made an investment by depositing something inside of you that you didn't know what's there so when the time came for him to get his return on investment he went to Gideon and said Gideon the mighty man of Valor he wasn't now putting it into Gideon it was already there Gideon just didn't know what was deposited in him and God came to get his return on his investment because when he came to Gideon's house it was to get a return he had a purpose and a plan that Gideon was supposed to accomplish that Gideon didn't realize he was supposed to accomplish because the deposit that God made him Gideon's soul he didn't tell Gideon's father he didn't tell Kyrian's mother he didn't tell Tyrion schoolteacher he didn't tell Tyrians pastor God made the deposit in him and God is looking for his return investments and for everyone here who is called by his name go a Miller deposit into you it's a seed of predestination it's a seed and in that seed has power brother Branham said to reproduce itself it could only produce itself it could only produce what's inside and God is looking for a return on investment what is his return on investment the same work I do shall you do also and greater than these that shall you - because I go unto my father that's the return cord didn't put something in you to get nothing back he wants to get praise back he wants to get worship back he wants you to to stir things up in your home stir things up on your job stir things up you may be seated I several young people but the Branham said the bride would be a cuted hunted group something would have to happen that cause us to be hunted something has to happen to call us to be persecuted this is a meeting that's disruptive this morning because we are interrupting what the devil is doing we are interrupting the plans we are interrupted what's going on in in the hearts of certain people this morning sister Christina swung at the angiogram and we are interrupting the machine that has to get the report of what's happened or you don't hear me this morning hallelujah we are interrupting what's happening with your daughter this morning we are interrupting what's happening with your son this morning we are interrupting what's happening in your body this morning by the power of the resurrected Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost that's the commission that's given to us we are interrupting your old age right now it looks like you get it all but we are interrupting that you are in fact getting younger and even if you give up this body you have another body waiting for you you may be seated [Applause] [Music] everything on earth is defined by terrestrial law is the time by the laws of the earth but when we come to churches to get access not to the law but to the law makeup because the law maker could move things around and he operates on a higher law law that is beyond this single earth that we live in because he's a good not just of this it he's accorded the universe he's a God of the stars he's a God who could put the Sun in place and move things around all for his purpose is nothing out of control this morning in your life if there's a trial that's hard for you to handle be confident be happy that God designed this trial for you it's your trial on it it's your problem on it God designed it to bring out the best in you to bring it a character in you because he is confident that the scene he put in your soul is able to withstand greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world no devil could stop it no demon could stop it no principality no power nothing past nothing present nothing to come nothing under near nothing anywhere can stop the plan of God concerning you and the church amen hallelujah you may be seated I don't know what's gonna happen this morning but we have not been this way before but we are looking one of these days I said to the young people one of these days we'll have the last song service wonders even have the last service in the house of the last time but the Panem said you'll open the Bible in the pulpit because this Bible has for a long time been transferring a secret message God never wanted his glory to be in book form he wanted his glory to be in 16 elements of this book was to hold a mystery until certain people came along this book was a means to transfer a file Oh glory to God hallelujah you may be seated [Applause] hallelujah I feel like we're now starting to warm up I feel like telling a warm up a little bit testing the temperature a little bit before we get to the scriptures I wanna make sure this army is ready for plateau because we are going toward it's morning you're going to offer the young people we're going to war for marriages we're going to war because Adam because Elijah because Moses because Jeremiah because when the Planum they are waiting on us to bring the knockout puncher that is devil who has fought for all these years is about to come to his end he may be seated [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] a flashdrive pendrive what do you want to call it there's nothing unless you are connecting it to something if you have files on a computer and you want to move it to another computer one of the ways to do it is to get a flash drive and you transfer the files to the flash drive and then you could go somewhere else another country perhaps and in another computer you could take that flash drive and put it in the other computer and access the files that's on the flash drive the job of the flash drive is to transport as the carry as is what was originally placed on the computer on this side so God Almighty had some file some and in those files had power in those files had certain operations in the past had the ability to do something so God had to find a way to make a transfer from the computers up in heaven but some sons and daughters who would be in 2019 and yet the final way to keep this file in order to keep this file safe he put an anti-virus on this flash drive he put the precautions on this flash drive the prophets carefully and all of this flash drive so when you come along you didn't know who you were you didn't know what you were called to do you didn't know what you were born to do but then when you come and you come into the house of God it's to get connected and cortex that flash driver and begin to do a download operation that's why the Prophet said when the Holy Ghost sub is downloaded into your soul it'll make you dance it'll make you jump up it'll make you shout up it'll make you see hallelujah you can't even explain it but it's a file tall order from your father up in heaven can the church Famer [Applause] [Music] no room [Music] is this apprentice phone [Music] whoa [Music] let the power afterwards before [Music] Thank You musicians if you have your Bibles will return it meter to portions of scripture reading Matthew 24 and reading from acts 19 Matthew 24 and from verse 40 Matthew 24 and verse 14 then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left two shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left what's there for for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come but know this that if the Goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such an hour as you think not the Son of man cometh and reading acts 19 and verse 1 and brother Branham said that this particular scripture was the theme of every apostle and it came to pass that while Apollo's was a current Paul having passed through the upper coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have ye received the Holy Ghost since he believed and they said unto Him we have known not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost was not being preached to them we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost so they were there in Ephesus they were believers but the Holy Ghost was not being preached to them and he said unto them unto what Dan ye baptized and he said unto John's baptism and then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance seeing unto the people that they should believe on him which shall come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they speak with tongue and prophesied me the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated for a title this morning is have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed I believe it's a fitting message and it's a message that we could preach almost every service because the question is not have you received a message the question is not have you received church the questions that have you received doctor and the question is have you received our Holy Ghost since you believe so even as a believer there is something to receive believing and receiving are two different things so when you talk about the Holy Ghost you're talking about something external to yourself you know when I was reflecting on the scripture be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind I was looking at those words conformity conforming to receive so be not shipped to this world but be transformed and transform means the properties that you are made up of is actually changed and the church say Amen so there are people who actually conformed to church you know but it's the same properties is the same person it's just like taking as the Prophet set of pig and and washing the pig and beating the pig and put in Cologne under pig and put in a bowtie and a pig that's conforming and once the pig is under enough pressure the pig will be here if you keep the pig away from all the mud the pig is on his best behavior because there's no mud lock to pick up in a beautiful clean house with no mud with no fills the pig will have to adapt to his environment but that's what legalism is so people try in the message to legalize this thing and keep pigs locked up in cages and see well look they're behaving but the moment the kids have a little hole this big finds a way to push himself out because he hasn't been transformed he has just confirmed but when you are transformed you're no longer a pig when you transform you become a lamb when you transform your desires change and your appetite changes your first genes or what attracts you changes what motivates you changes what inspires you changes because you have been transformed when you look into the mirror the way you're used to look you can't even recognize yourself you want to know who is that looking back at you because something is different you you're here cut different you you walk different you talk different you're different you live in your family I recognize you your wife want to know what happened to you your husband want to know what happened because you have been transformed by the word transformed by the spirit transform I'm gonna better preach a message the transforming power of God and he said the Holy Ghost of spirit is what is the transforming power hallelujah hallelujah now the world has its place the mechanics have its place of the mechanics is the network the neural network that connects all the pieces but when the dynamics comes it comes to activate this network up so every service you come the mechanics comes to you as word in other words like recipes it comes as instructions it comes as inspiration it comes as revelation but spirit and revelation is two different things pizza had a revelation tower the Chrysler pizza had word God open their understanding to the scriptures but when he cooked to the day of Pentecost up and he were in one place up in one mind in one Accord er under one expectation with one burden with one desire up with one expectation the holy ghost up which was what was promised him I made the word lived him and made all the experiences come alive now all of a sudden they had to take note that these disciples had been with Jesus they had to take note that Peters walk was different people are new Pizza say that is not the same man people who knew Andrew and James knew that is not the same man and one of these days people will look at you and say that's not the same man that's not the same woman and God loves to get glory for it because you go to your mess and your mistakes and you can't even help yourself but the Holy Ghost comes a change shooter Holy Ghost comes a chance for you the Holy Ghost comes to turn things around and the church say man I'm gonna take my time this morning the purpose of the endtime message the whole purpose of the endtime message was to lose the Holy Ghost because given T power for us to make it to the rapture but the Brandon said this bride will stop cancer this bride will stop diseases this bride will stop all kinds of powers all kinds of sicknesses it is that talk that will doing that it'll have to be power to do that it'll have to be the spirit to do that so the whole purpose of all these ages and generations was record the Great Architect the great scientist great designer who wanted a finer way to replicate himself to find vessels in this day and this age that he could use can the church say Amen now the Holy Ghost but a random total was bound at the river Euphrates for almost 2,000 years but Christ the Son of man feel in the Prophet loose the Holy Ghost loose your inheritance loose your promise not the Holy Ghost as a but but the life itself because the Pentecostals had had movement and feelings and had the spirit upon their flesh but this is different this is sustainable power this is not live under the anointing and go back home and do foolishness but it says God on the inside him in control he is directing he is meeting can the church say Amen I want to read a quote and then touch something are you with me this morning everybody on expectation in the message Cyrus that's the matter it is to deal with the people that's the matter with America tonight we can say tuning out of where our tonight the only thing I conceive America from a total annihilation is to return to God with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the only thing return to God with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's exactly right that's right and they're scared of it who is scared of it scared of this thing you know why it has make it change [Music] but people some people don't want to change them you see me this is how I am this is you love it or I don't like it take it you could take a break and leave it this is me this is and people have your dassies but this is how god make me not for that bad attitude you might say Beach and somebody renewing of your mind to renew the world renew means to bring it back to how it was when it was new in order to reboot your mind because over time all of the principalities and powers and it devil is he is the Prince of the power the air in mess up minds and that mind mess of a people conformance or the in church but they conformed into the world they come into children reading books but but there's no prayer life that's a conformance in the world no desire it they're not singing the songs of Zion first thing in the morning they're not going to do I need to drive down that road or I can make a u-turn and come back out because cause if we keep driving down that road because the world comes to change our behavior because we are leaving this place and the rapture so the external thing is an internal thing the wrapped is on our outside in thing is an inside out thing you have to be walking around with the rapture where's the rapture is inside of me just waiting for the time waiting for the time for kotas already come and all of a sudden the power that's working in you transforms itself can the church say men everybody feeling fine now from the message Jehovah Jireh but the band said and no that's the way that Christianity is and I want you to get this when a man is or a woman or a child is born of the Spirit of God listen carefully and this is what we're talking about now born of the Spirit of God then everything you have made off in this world listen and the world to come is given to you when you receive the Holy Spirit you see how important this thing is that I'm talking about let me read this one more time young people listen carefully now that's the way that Christianity is when a man is or a woman or a child is born of the Spirit of God then everything you have need of in this world and the world to come is given to you when you receive the Holy Spirit and you are planted in Christ and to my estimation of Christ or the Prophet is trying to create an estimation of Christ he said he is the inexhaustible function of life when you start to drink from this function in Orono an exhaustible inexhaustible mean there's no limit there's no enliven you can outdrink it you can the drink is you will hold up all of your drinking too much that will happen he's inexhaustible and you just are planted in him and drink and drink and push out and drink and push out and drink and push out everything you have need of is in him the only thing you have to do is get thirsty and go to drink him and it'll produce yet exactly what the seed is and if it's a promise God promised to do it God's obligated to do it and he will do it and the church say man I hope this thing's in the somebody this morning and the Prophet goes on he said pushing shoving something comes in as we move in a tabernacle this morning that means spring ever heard of the mainspring that means spring in the middle of the watch that makes every movement click the perfect timing now he's talking about not easy to tell not the iWatch and these digital watches these watches is to make us forget about the mainspring where there are so may you all time watches with the mean spring it is moving everything connection these desert watches young people Kevin reference it means for anymore but those watches it's a way you connect the next wheel on a spring and Ito buddy mainspring in the middle of the watch that makes every movement click the perfect aim now if all he pieces of the watch the end something wrong with him in spring then you watch wouldn't click to the perfect time so the profit goes on and when the Holy Spirit comes in there's something that moves and listen him you can't understand what it is it's a supernatural being inside you moving controlling your emotions making you scream when actually you feel like running but you will shout when you don't know what you're doing you just praise God automatically then something happens it's that mean spring the spring of God's grace in the middle of your heart controlling you making you shun from evil accept life get away from tote have me that means spring can we talk about the mean spring this morning that means spring will make you cast down reasoning it'll make you stop trying to figure things out and accept courts would it's a moving ticking going around and around and making your whole emotions come right in a control with God what a marvelous thing but if Adam goes on the Holy Spirit brooding over you as he did a bleak at one time and the fruits come up out of the bleak and when the Holy Spirit drove together the calcium and port ash and moisture and whatever texture it taken to make flowers and fruits and peace and animals and mankind the Holy Spirit brooding in connection with God and these things come to pass what more will he do over a born-again man now for his health or whatever he has need of of God's eternal prophets and of course eternal promised and the church say Amen from the message impersonation of Christianity but I said God's new heart that he put in you that's right in the center of you that's your impulse where your emotions goes out and the new spirit says right in the son of the newhart see them on a new heart a new spirit and quartz spirit the holy spirit sets right in the center of your new spirit and peer it controls your emotions it's just like the mean spring in a famous watch and it's self-winding you don't have to wind it every day God won't it once and for all and it's set right in the middle of your life of your new life and as the mean spring as it relieves and takes away the watch it controls every little organism of that watch the perfect time and when the Holy Spirit can the church the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit not the new degree not the new church this is a prophet hey man when the Holy Spirit not the new decree not the new church not the new thought not the new emotion not the new oil not the new dance not the new lips not the new tongue not the new this not the new that but when God places his spirit in the middle of your new spirit then you don't have to act meek you don't have to act like a Christian it controls everything that's within you it puts you decent makes a church act orderly makes the gifts work perfectly if you have to be taken from a place where you think you should be and put down something else it controls you can the church say man what are we talking about whereas if we're talking about the Holy Ghost not swapping I'll never come back again no sir that shows that the mainspring is not in there when you blow up at every little thing that happens poisons that disposition and when the pastor happens to hit something that in the wood and you say well I don't believe that watch out the mainspring hasn't been set in there right so when you fly off the handle and they get all upset and get all emotional on you you you can't even take correction what does it mean the mainspring has immense that's right but when the mean spring is set right when the Holy Ghost is in the control tower off your heart then you don't fly off the handle it controls it makes you believe so the Holy Ghost will make you believe it makes you act in such a way till you become salty the whole world turns to be like you can the church say man that's the Holy Spirit sitting in the middle of your spirit it's the mean spring oh I just hate to go to church tonight and that preacher if he wasn't so long-winded I'd like to hear him a few minutes but I tell you what the last time I went when I went down to the car party Susie said to me do you mean to tell me the very audacity that you belittle yourself to take your hair down you mean to tell me that you're not going to wear those shorts anymore well you see the thing of it is if you've just got a new spirit it'll just kill you that's right but when you got his spirit it makes every emotion tick just write to the word of God it'll tick right with the word you see well no Susie just a moment the Bible said it's an abomination before him to do that and the love of Christ has come into my heart and I love him too much to do it see I love him that's what the mainspring does it makes you love him it makes you serve him it makes you worship Him it makes you act different and if you don't have that mean spring we ought to be desperate to get that mean spring if you don't have the Holy Ghost we ought to be desperate to get the Holy Ghost because once the Holy Ghost is operating in you it's a new Walker it's a new talker it's a new life it's a new way it's a new kind of church semen [Applause] hallelujah let's sit be the name of the Lord hallelujah are we gonna see on that until that comes to pass because there are too many people who are coming to church because they want to be better but that's not what this is talking about we're not trying to be better we're trying to be the way God wants us to be because our understanding of better doesn't have to line up with God's expectation of us can chatzi mm we want to meet God standard not our standard we don't want the improvement we want perfection we don't want to be better we want perfection we want adoption we want to see in science not let a piece of a Sam you want the same wonders we want the same spirit we want to stand there God set for holiness the standard is set for righteousness the standard is set for how Christians are supposed to be not conformed to this world but the fire of the Holy Ghost taking a permanent residence in our souls controlling our movements of you driving down the road and something tells you no you can't go there you are both to tell somebody something that's how I see don't see nothing what is it it's a Holy Ghost it's controlling you you are being controlled by a high opinion let's sit be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord glory glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah oh we are going somewhere we are going somewhere your flesh is in trouble this morning your spirit is in trouble and sworn in because when the word comes like this it goes into violation of what your body wants and what your spirit one's and what your memory tells you and your own reasoning of what things are supposed to be like God is speaking the receipt in your soul for the ceiling of so to begin to grow and to take control of everything around you take control of your heart your mind your body everything kinda church amen Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can the church cement hallelujah hallelujah lujah oh I'm waiting on something right now I'm waiting on something right now Oh blessed be the name of the Lord God did not want the Holy Ghost to fall on your flesh he didn't wonder what he goes to fall on your ideas he didn't want the Holy Ghost to fall on your emotions he didn't want the Holy Ghost to fall so the Prophet had to come to bring the word hallelujah so the Prophet had to come to bring the wood so that the wood will change you and the word would prepare you and the wood would instruct you on what your expectation is supposed to be and the wood will be your anchor point the world would be your a point of understanding of what you are supposed to live up to so when the Spirit comes you will know how to recognize it because when the rain falls it brings up every seed it brings up every spirit but the way to discern if the spirit is moving in the right way is like I'm here with a winner that's why the word has to be spoken a certain way the wood has to be presented a certain way the word has to be focused a certain way so that when you see the movement of the Spirit you can see that is it this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Malachi for not a work up that I eat borscht and not a mystery not something that you have to try to figure it out but it will speak for itself and the church shame and without that we are like any other Pentecostal church without - be like any other Church up but when it's line upon line precept upon precept God has always water the spirit up on the instructions of the word not under way you wanted he told him Terry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high those brothers couldn't go down the Syrian wait he couldn't go down to Lebanon and wait he had to be where God told them to be and brother branham here with a message told us rapture and faith is laying in this message of he puts up another Ephesians he speak of another time he speak of the power coming into the church and all these years god this guy's the Holy Ghost as the word deceive you can handle it up because the Pentecostal had signs and wonders and they couldn't handle it of the Pentecost had spirit and they couldn't handle it up because the Spirit is so powerful but God wants support power on character God won support power and sons and daughters whose DNA have been changed of the appetite has been changed no more luster no more sonication no more lying no more evil surmising no more gossip no more make-believe them but it's genuine it's real and chorus the filter up filter out these things can touch it's me man Oh hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah is anybody looking for this does anybody want this does anybody want a new walk a new talk a new desire a new ambition [Applause] [Music] so every service we come to renew your mind every service we come to tell you forget the words forget about the mortgage forget about the bills forget about the problems forget about your job because God is in control if you trust him he could change of mind of your boss he will change the industry he will change the economy he will change everything because you eyes focus and settle in this score that he had with the devil that is his focus can the church say man so service after service God made sure that you have access to the full word and you have to do your homework you have to do your part you have to do your part to ensure that you are ready the Bible says make your calling and election sure my job is to make my calling and election so I cannot make your call and so you have to take care of that yourself Lord show me show me where my name is written show me what my expectation is show me how am I supposed to live show me how I'm supposed to act up I want to be sure I don't want to take chances I don't want to take chances I don't want to take it for granted coming to church it's not the requirement singing is not the requirement shouting it's not the requirement the Holy Ghost is the requirement dancing is not the requirement the Holy Ghost is the requirement being in the message is not the requirement the Holy Ghost is the requirement have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe them I know you believe but there's something more than just believe him God promised to pour out the Holy Ghost to pour out the spirit upon planted wood Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah oh my shake yourself shake your emotions or we let our emotions control us we let these things affect us we let anger and hatred and jealousy and all these singer of the flesh affect us tiredness that has nothing to do the spirit the spirit has nothing to tie this we got a holy spirit can I get tired the horse wasn't limited by what's happening around you he is able to revive you he's able to restore you he see what they deliver you he's there with the break the shackles and the chain that you have been fighting for all these years up in this service the Holy Ghost is here to change your life to give you a permanent transformation to bring you one step closer to the rapture one step closer to adoption one step closer to perfection one step closer to your family be in the level one step closer to your total healing your total victory and the church say man I'm still warming up I'm still warming up Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what are you trying to see preach I'm trying to see one man one Accord I'm trying to see one expectation the Prophet self if we could get in one minor one Accord he said in five minutes there'd be not a feeble person in the building all it takes is five minutes I'm looking for a five minute service a five minute service but to get that five minute service we need to be in one mind of one Accord we need to have one expectation we need to know it's one Lord it's one pitch it's one baptism it's one Holy Ghost it's one mock of adoption it's one token it's one absolute it's one spirit it's one party by one spirit we are baptized into the body your sickness is defeated today because you are part of the body and you kind of make a rapture in your sick condition that's why we're the Branham said how can you have peace for the rapture if you can't even ask for divine healing you must be healed you have to be healed the devil cannot stop it your healing is on its way it's already paid for it's already sent from heaven it's on its wave your deliverance on its wave your family be restored on its sweep hallelujah and no devil can stop it no demon can stop it nothing could stop him coming to pass not many days hence let me prophesy you will see your children restoring the house of God not many days hence up you will see the pins in your body disappear not many days hence how could you say that because the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy and we are commissioned we are commanded to prophesy again after we take the book and eat the book and we are speaking from the book this morning we are speaking from the hidden manna under the seventh seal this morning we are speaking because we know who we are what we are called to do what we are called to achieve what's about to happen and the devil could do nothing about it but I say I don't have no money forget about it he could provide your financing but Isaac you know what's happening in my marriage forget about it he is the first one instituted marriage he can fix it around it's not your job to fix it trust him he'll fix it he'll change things around because that's what he does allow God to do what he does allow God to be a healer allow God to be a great position [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when the wood and spirit comes together Healing actually happens people were healed while the preaching is going on people were healed because they caught feet you don't even need lead to be laid hands on this morning because the wood is going forth wood and spirit together you can answer each other and grab it and say Lord I'm ready I'm tired of this condition you promise you'll heal me I'm gonna clean my healing and you can walk out here this morning with your healing you can walk on here this morning with your victory [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah it's an uphill battle that in our human strain we cannot win it's an uphill battle friends that in your human strength you cannot win our track record will always be failure our track record will have the only thing that could change from failure to success event go exception and he starts to drive the car of your life and you tired of trying things you're weak and you tried of your approach and you try to be here today had any wall and teasin work only waited and you have been doing you have been doing it and chorus in the battle is not yours it's my battle listen is not you listen you may be seated listen it's not you have this score to settle on oh is that your score to settle is good score to settle we happen to be the instruments that he will use to settle his score the devil rose up with war in heaven and he war became the war of men not it was nothing to do with us but we were represented there in the battle when Michael thought we were represented there and because you overcame their God chose us for this age because we had experience of fighting alongside Michael we were there represented but God wiped your memory because when a Terran spoke in a couple of weeks ago because God wants of good battle you want a good fight you don't want no opponent that losing up front so you want to get it ever a play a game he wiped your memory that you could remember so Angela's in his condition God unlocked his memory and said job let me remind you where was though when I lay the foundation of the earth and the morning stop oh you were there and when you remember he got a confidence he felt different he said I know my redeemer Levitt brother Branham preached it spiritual amnesia and the spiritual amnesia is what has you sick in your body you don't even remember that test body is temporary and your theophany oh come on somebody help me please this warning but me the word come down upon you black white spirit to remind you you are just like your father [Music] poor halleluja halleluja he may be seated [Applause] [Music] you may be seen in where the random taught us the devil is jealous of you because he could never access this inheritance because for him to access inheritance he has to come under the blood and if he come under the blood he'll be your brother but because he had come under the blood he could oh god somebody help me this morning he cannot come under the blood because underneath the blood the devil do you no harm so you are here to prove that call to take away everything from you and you still span not on your own knowledge but on your representation by predestination [Applause] you may be seated in other words what are you saying preacher you are winner before you even born before you took up residence on the earth you are winner if we can remind rewind you may be sitting for a minute rewind back to that war when Michael threw his sword returns and there was some sons of God represented with him but a Terrence I was there you were there oh listen we were the ones who take the devil out you know so the devil knows who you are he knows who I am and his job is to keep us from reconnecting to who we I am God because the devil knows that if this Holy Ghost thing because the Holy Ghost is the connector the Holy Ghost is God in spirit it's caught in his sons it's caught in power [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you may be seen it for a minute but feels good in here feel somebody catching something but a random cell and the Bible says it everything that we see today the things that appear are meeting the things that did not what we see is made from things that did not exist you ever seen it for a minute and then he said everything that's on the earth know all your raw materials was here all along so when Adam was on the earth the raw materials were here to make the airplane it says that Adam didn't know how to make a airplane and in fact when Adam was in his position he didn't need a airplane because as a son in position he could just move from wherever he wanted to he had to go but it doesn't deny the fact that the raw materials were here all along you receive for a minute so God who could think levels above us can we talk about Gore for a little bit buckle your seatbelts and go here for a ride this morning God is a scientist can we trouble go to scientist early doctors to this deal no trying to understand basic biology after call it basic because it kind of reached cause understanding how Gore cat-friendly right cells to put together and the way birth takes place on the way there your body heals itself anyway that when you have a fever the fever is your body's defense mechanism God built in a defense mechanism to raise your temperature because certain certain viruses or bacteria cannot exist a certain temperature God in designing man sat down and mapped out all this biology all the chemistry for how your brain would work because it's electronic different synapses that transfer your brain to move and calculate and that's electric so girls an electrical engineer he's a biological engineer he's a chemical engineer he's an architect if the earth tell too much the water were melty I capsule meant so quad nose can we preserve it before the flood but a brand said the earth was in its stable condition but when the flood came caught tilted on the axis just a little bit he knew exactly how much until today oh come on somebody help me he's uh he's uh he's ah he's architect he knows how to design he's a mechanical engineer when they wanted to get from Egypt to the promised land he's the only man he's the only God could open the Red Sea they still don't know how to open up I see somebody bleeds back to me you may be seated [Applause] this God were talking about this scientist was able to take a man that looked just like you and me because he was not big man he was a looking majestic tattoo on me named Samson and with the same bone structure the same muscle structure in fact where the Branum she didn't look strong he look like a but Korra's able to finally use that same body that same mechanics that same height that seems to Anne's Five Fingers five fingers and make that man so strong he can lift up a gate or somebody please back to me you may be seated can I talk about his resume listen for a minute [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Alijah without a whole egos tapped into the science and I babble say he may be axe flute because he tapped into the intelligence I know a better man I'm taught us there's no moving faculty after the eyes it's just the intelligence so this bride and I'm getting something now because but over the last weeks at the touches I called spiritual scientist and I'm sure better at in my notes I have some notes and spiritual scientists Muhammad said Luthor was a scientist he went to the wood and he found what was needed for that oh it was here all along you know it was a new things he thought it was day all along but as a spiritual scientist said it a mix of ingredients together mechanics and dynamics and when McKenna then is a reaction I'm an Wesley Kim he is a scientist went to look for all your raw materials and they say in a chemistry lab if you ever would a lab when your mix chemicals he's had to add another element most time is fire your mixer men together and we put it any ponds in Berlin are your presence in Romania to put a external element I was a little lighter on fire and many things begin a bubble and mix and create what it's supposed to be so this word is mechanics and true this mess another prophet we have all the mechanics because s ratcheting is a listen but if I said this you know long dr. tscheiner stop cancer but he said this purchase and this bread will stop cancer in this bride is a formula to stop diseases it's here but it takes to the right people to mix it together and then fire with a Branham Center rapture and faith is laying in a message it's already here you know in other people looking for the formality formula is here but God is waiting for some scientist to say okay we need to take this and but if I said one of you right word will be spoken and will - into the presence so it's here already so what are you worried about what are you stressing about what are you letting your emotions getting away about can the church same and everybody feeling fine [Applause] [Music] so the full word has to be in us as see so that when the spirit comes it could bring up what's inside of the CD that's why the prophet could say the secret is the wood is in the pride not the word is in the church the word is in the bride and how do you know bride how do you know she is bride she could take the wood I went the wood is in the bright and your womb is sealed it means that anything that is not Christ you recognize listen you can't let you go when you have a genuine experience with God you guide you but a brand said when you have that experience that all you need with this wool and it would to come already tell you he will guide you into all truth that's the comforter all the way from fear to charity we go better Baron said after you receive the Holy Ghost you make yourself a Christian that is the process of climbing would feed virtue knowledge temperance patient goal it but it can charity and when you up chatting you seal with love know you reach a stature that you are now looking like the formula to make it because there's being when completed is the being that appear there hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so I'm contending this morning for us to come back on speaking terms with God back into a relationship with God a genuine relationship with God not a sometimes relationship but a relationship with God that he every decision that you actually think before you act what will God want and you will find many such a do that everything around you begins to change because if he walking in his will and when you embodied in that walk and in your calling and in his will then the only thing that could come your way it's what God allows to come here whether you can handle outside of that you are creating your own problems and it's right below it always said we are yet to be led by the spirit into the wilderness to be tested how we test you and as you create your test you create your trial you create about you look and you walk into trouble and it's a malgor take mountain you see by never leave you there because I give you grace to do what I lead you into but now you find yourself in their mother Branham said if you ever find yourself away from gold retreat systems and go right back to where you left them because he be right here because it but everyone said God never leaves us he said we walk away from God and if you ever want to get back into fellowship with God go right back to where you left him come to church say Amen or hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord everybody feelin fine in the end time sign see but ever I said Jesus said the scriptures has to be fulfilled every word has to come to pass today we have gotten so far away from it we have just mixed ourselves up with creed and so forth until we have just gone out on a wild tantrum just as the Bible said we would do but in but he goes on but in the face of all that there's a real bride that God's bringing forth each time has been a Reformation has been so much for the word spread forth and each generation gets his time did he notice there'll be a manor come along and it'll strike the fire with God and there'll be a great revival that shook the land but what happens immediately after that they take out man's idea and it nominated and bring in Crete and mixes and she dies and never rises again but in the face of all that there's a real pride that God is bringing forth and we are going back to the Bible to produce a wood bride because I'll never be a bride like this bride there has never been and they will never be because it's the last bride what's about to happen has never happened before and will not happen again in the black part of God's mind it's the final showdown the final point that God has been waiting on from a message either was it Moses so I'll be with thee and that's a trouble today we tried to get ahead of the wood and bypass and make the wood to fit this the wood to fit that God bless your hearts what we need to do is follow the wood what we need to do is get rid of a lot of our fancy fandango's and get back to the Bible and back to the old-fashioned Holy Ghost and back to a place where man and woman look and act and walk like Christians you might think I'm a little excited I'm just a little crazy but I tell you I love to be this way what we need today ministers what we need today brothers and sisters is this one thing the devil has got into our church and got us all formal indifferent what he needs are calling back what mean these are all fashion gathering together again the sounding of the jubilee the pouring forth of the Holy Ghost the all coming of the Spirit sure there's cause to come back to the prayer meeting it's true we have just begin to fashion off just like the world do just the same things the world does and how it happens a lot of Hollywood evangelism and a lot of television staying home at night watching television instead of going to prayer meeting watching who loves Lucy and all I kind of stop and stay away from the Word of God and away from the church and I tell you brother that's the reason you know that's the truth god help us today to come back to the old fashioned Pentecostal experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit today but a parent said the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word because the holy sprit alone leaf indicator would that's my expectation that's my hope I don't know what your desires this morning but I know they always lead I know that time is fast spent and I know that judgment is hanging over here and I know chorus about to call all these people home to the rapture and I know that this economy cannot be fixed the crime situation cannot be fixed this world cannot be fixed there's no way out but up there's no solution that man can figure out some God has the same fire to purify this earth fire to purify lives lives who are willing to give up everything to make it in this green call a new heart a new spirit his spirit that's the only formula that God is looking for a noun a new heart a new spirit his spirit and the church semen Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord so we want to create the right atmosphere in every service you wanna create a right atmosphere every day in our homes in our lives is here Lord I need a new heart if you have not even had a heart transplant then me you pray today for new heart tough and he said I've to get in new heart because he said it hard you have can't even live with your brother can live with his sister you know the things you like you don't like that's not God's heart he promised to give you a new heart I hided with tears after him a high that would love him I had it would seek him come on church speak he preached back to me Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh hallelujah a new heart and he puts a new spirit he says God has to give you a new spirit because you couldn't get along with him God has to put something between your heart and his spirit and as a new spirit to bring compatibility between God because his thoughts are higher than our thoughts he is holy and we are not by nature holy so something has to come to us to allow us to communicate on his level because he is righteous and our nature is unrighteous we are born in sin sheep in iniquity our best efforts are abomination to God all the books you read all that you do is still filthy rags unto God but when the Holy Ghost steps in then you are perfectly compatible with him because he can say that spirit of my spirit flesh of my flesh bone of my bone [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let me just drop this in here you put a new spirit corn as they give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him and that new spirit is not the Holy Spirit he said a new heart a new spirit and his spirit three different things there's no heart is to take away the stone he has and it comes to this world with you all need to or behavior and then he crossing your new spirit you can get along with yourselves he said with only news where you can get load yourself Yesi people can't live with a oneself people in the house by this self and a frustrated whoever who who has just know this just on your own self people having overcome same with all that stress on your own self you miss a man who gave action nobody so who talk to you nobody so why have ax whenever just telling myself that whole argument who will come visit with yourself the new spirit sorts on your own being with your own self you kinda know with yourself that all devil spurred you had in you that's not my words oh she's caught up with a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit I will put a new spirit in them remember what our team is this morning how he received the Holy Ghost since you believed it that people who believe and have no news personal and I believe him I didn't love the message but our being Christian is being christ-like in him I was saying somebody speaking recently but years ago in the message before people had wisdom the prophet said that only the only woman who had makeup was Jezebel any Bible you remember that I said Jezebel got fed to the dog she's dog meat he probably said that be car walk on the street driving on highway screaming dog meat people did that know you intend to win somebody to Christ like that and half of these people doing that not even anywhere near any message no because they had knowledge but no new hat no new spirit and they didn't have his spirit because his spirit knows how to get to somebody he went to the woman at the well and he said cocora husband he didn't have said a yes five money I have yet they said Coco her husband he knows about the probe and she was he one say well here's what I have no husband and then Jesus began a talk to her he said you speak your truth because you you had five honey one the Buddha is not yours and he tried to make her feel like Oh cause she said well I had a speaking to you are he biting he finished with her she feel good enough to run and tell people come see a man who tell me all about me and show me that I could find a way out of my mess she didn't leave a feeling so messed up she was a diagonally well and commit suicide and that process that Jean because everything in this world is a processing and our Christian walk God takes us through a journey you coming to the Lord and it you get to know and then and then you realize you're such a hit your full center child guru trial and then you're like good lord toward this Christian thing was changing my walk my talk my life and then now your hands a battle and bullets flying around your through your leg your clothes get shut because they entered a war didn't realize the way it was in a war listen when is any warrior was a no warrior because you was in friendly zone because the Arab and Bishop is it gonna see village so when you serve the devil you walking wrong normal normal normal it's like but the moment you such a display behaviors that look like you from above you have a bull's eye starter go on your head all of a sudden again speeding tickets well you shouldn't be spilling that's wrong example bad example but all of a sudden situation you have problems for flat tires on your way to church and ever choice what if it is but his situations that try to frustrate you because the enemy is also fighting but true this process God is doing something in your soul to bring you closer to him and to his plan to give you a new heart to give you a new spirit and to put his Holy Spirit inside of you can the church say Amen [Applause] but I said I'd listen to the Prophet again so he's got about a new spoon in you so you can get along with his spirit I was put a new spirit in them I would put my spoon in them he said he's giving you a news pert that's you don't get it confused with God's Spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you because you in your condition never gets along you can't get along with your wife you can't is along with your husband can't even get along the neighbor how are you ever going to get along with God the prophets would so you have to give you a new spirit so you can get along with him so he puts a new spirit in you then he puts his spirit in you gives you a new skirt a new outlook a new Fiat then he puts his Holy Spirit in you and the church glory so after the new heart after a new spirit now you can look forward for his spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Branham said in the future home to heavenly bridegroom and the bride if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the same conditions is met he ever ever saved a man he's got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time if he ever failed a man with the Holy Ghost listen now he's got to do it on the same grounds he did the first time if he ever raised a man up from the grave he's got to do it the second time and every other time on the same principle so what do you say brother I said once you meet the condition God is obligated to honor his word and he said full obedience and the entire Word of God entitles you that would entitle meanness no you're right it entitles you to the token it entitles you to the Holy Ghost so you have every the company Lord I'm coming for something that belongs to me because you told me when I fully OB the entire Word of God you will do something for me and that's the position you want to be as a church where we can lay down any altar cry and lead on say Lord we have done all that we can no it's up to you father what is the Holy Ghost given for the Holy Ghost comes to give you power the Holy Ghost comes to give you power in prayer we've read as many times you take a person has lived a good life but they always defeated oh I tell you I sure love the Lord brother Branham always defeated you never get a prayer answer you feel that little woman with the Holy Ghost one time watch what takes place when she calls before God she's not defeated she comes ball into the throne of God believing she has a right because she's a daughter of God by but take that little man so cowardly the boss kick him all over the place say wait a minute here now something chintzy he caught the Holy Ghost he gives you power in your life is full of power he gives you power in speech those people were afraid standing there Peter James John Luke and all the rest of them they done gone any upper room or we can't see no more there's dr. so-and-so and rabbis so and so he got four degrees Peter said I remember selling that man fish one day oh I could never stand them what time we do Brechin wait what we've been doing it for four days just keep on waiting how long until well did he see it would be in the fifty he never said how long he said until so they just kept waiting how long until it is pass until 90s that's a profit until and finally when the day of Pentecost had fully come they were all in one place in one Accord God had been above them in a fiery cloud go ahead walk with them alert now something else is going to take place something's fixin to happen they were all in one place in one Accord and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the room where they were setting is that your expectation this morning suddenly it was just a prison they were just there worshiping they were just in one mind they were just in one Accord they had one expectation they knew what the promise was they knew that they needed it they were under expectation for it's up they were desperate for it they were afraid of the Romans but he was there and God give them a commentary until you get the power and they were waitin and they were praying and they will worship Him and they were waiting and they were praying and they were worshiping and they were waiting and they were praying and they were worshiping and they were waiting and they were praying and they were worshiping didn't change doctrine they didn't change a message didn't change what they believed that he was holding on to the promise Lord you promised the Holy Ghost and they will wait him and they will worship Him and they will pray Lord you promised the Holy Ghost and they will worship Him and they were praying and they will wait him Lord you promise you'll change me and they were worshiping and they were worshiping and they were worshiping Lord he promised to pour the Holy Ghost and they will worship Him they were in one mind it didn't happen under fifty he didn't happen on the second name and they were in one mind and they were getting warmer and they were gonna get one Accord they began to forget the things of the world because I were in one place they were in one minor they were in one room he knew the promise of every team the promise was getting more real to them every day they were getting more into expectation every day they realize that their lives depended on it you could not leave the upper room it didn't make sense they'd be long enough they have been there long enough you didn't want to come out the same way they came he didn't want to leave the room at all nothing they knew that God said that tarry until until until and then all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden it wasn't the Alima but grace came to them it wasn't their efforts but grace came to them it wasn't their work but grace came to them and the Holy Ghost ran through the room so never rushing mighty wind and fill everyone with the Holy Ghost every single person God Himself divided himself and a pillar of fire became licks a fire and every single person got their own portion of the pillar of fire every single person got their own experience made called every single person got their own encounter with God nobody was looking around them nobody was studying anybody else they wanted their own experience with God and God did not disappoint them if you came this morning for your own experience with God God will not disappoint you we are moving into the season of the spirit of where the rushing Mighty Wind he has already left glory the Great Spirit of God he is on the earth now fixing things around him to seal up the young people the seal of the collapse to manifest himself [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah the pressure in the outside world had made those in the upper room desperate they were not just waiting they were waiting under pressure they were waiting under pressure they were afraid they knew that what they had there was not enough to meet the challenge of the hour they needed something more and God had promised something more for them Jess's God has promised something more for every one of us in here this morning you don't have to leave a semi you came this morning Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah Oh keep the motors humming hallelujah Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah hallelujah from the message oneness let's begin a tire together here we are in the end time young people there's no more time coming there's no more time to play Church there's no more time to play games there's only time to make sure that you are in Christ that's the only time you have that's the only time you have if God gives you grants to go to school and have a job that's okay but make sure that you are in Christ don't sacrifice being in Christ for your education don't sacrifice being in Christ for your job you'll be making a fatal mistake here we are in the endtime coming from the east and the west north understand what are we doing getting ready for that rapture the whole purpose of the Holy Ghost is to get us ready for that rap job getting ready for hauling ourselves steady for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost that's what a prophet is saying so God wants us to slow down a little bit and hold steady for a few minutes stop running all here and everywhere unsteady from human until every fiber it's filled with the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the God it's a promise hallelujah as long as cars got the people course that a chillage course got the Holy Ghost marching with it that's what God gives the Holy Ghost for intellectuals will rise always half but God's got a minority somewhere friends I could spend time talking about all kind of different things all kind of nice information and you leave here he could he could have no I learn a lot and no I didn't know this critter was connected a scripture but if all of that hasn't turned into you haven't power in your life you wastin time there are many fine choices this morning into all kinds of different things I'm not against what they preach or what anybody goes into that's not the point but if the equal sign of all of this doesn't equal the holy goes in your soul Lewisohn time because the rapture only recognizes the token when the dead angel passes by is that when I see the blood how pass but a man I'm in the token II preacher angel and asking how long he been a Jew how long in the message what try we belong to what church should go to east looking for one thing he's not he's not even asking he's not talking to people he's just watching as a token there he doesn't need to have a conversation with you because you see the token implied on your house if you were to pass by this morning and this house would he see the token applied in your life have you received it since you believed it should make all of us look at ourselves this morning these are the kind of messages that are hard to preach that some preachers don't like the preacher people don't like to hear because it comes back to every man examining himself and your walk with God have you you have people to answer that question have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and if they answer that a question is no then what are you doing about it are you getting desperate are you hungry I use thirsty because blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness the Bible says for they are the ones that shall be filled it says nothing to do with a person next to you this has to do with you and God have you received a gift from God since you believe if you don't believe then at the end this question is not for you I'm talking for those who have believed you call yourself a believer have you received the gifts because he said baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so that promises on you upon baptism but what are you doing to see that promise come to life in your life promise come to reality in your life till this court be read there's something is a new being a spiritual being moving inside of your soul he wants to take control he wants to take leadership leadership over your life and when he leaves the life when he leaves your life the father's in here when the Holy Ghost is leading your life now he's leading your house because when he is controlling you know you could have proper control as a father of the house and when the mothers have the Holy Ghost now you can properly guide your children because you're not leading on your own understanding on your own ability but the Holy Ghost is directing you spiritual leadership that's a property we are depending on our own strength our own knowledge our own inspiration of our own ambitions of our own advice we are telling Sharon what we want to tell him we didn't even talk to God about it but when the Holy Ghost is dear it will lead you in how to speak to your children the Holy Ghost will have husbands speak to their wives the right way demonstrate love the right will have wives to reference it husbands the right way not how you were taught but how the Holy Ghost leads you to do it because he knows how to do it this is not legalism this is the Holy Ghost but but I problems and people afraid of it because disrupt away we do things it will disruptive to the tradition because we have all kind of plans where the holy ghost doesn't respect our path he is the Holy Ghost he is quad and spirit moving direct and changing things around in perfect order put the comedy brooding over your life brooding over the church as he brood over the earth in Genesis and created order out of chaos he wants to create order in your life out of the chaos in your life together Holy Ghost it must be total surrender total surrender complete surrender you have to let go of your emotions let go of your feelings let go of your desires and the other side become for wanting Lord I need you because he is spirit he was above them he walked with them now the whole gospel the whole mission was hidden for ages and generation is Christ in you the hope of glory it's not Christ in flesh in you is the spirit in you that's what this world gospel is above that's what the message is about to bring Jesus Christ on the scene again that's what it's all about [Applause] oh my my my my all of your struggles your struggling to do this and it's struggling to do that and it's struggling to live the life and it's struggling to make it may your struggle to the beat just to get the Holy Ghost because when you get the Holy Ghost the struggles become different Oh me labor this morning me you have the birth pains of the Holy Ghost it'll be a messy thing but that's what we need baptized a little body get the Holy Ghost and everything else fall into place [Music] you want to get a wife get the Holy Ghost first you'll get the right wife you want to get a husband get the Holy Ghost first you'll get the right husband you want to know what's the best job for you get the Holy Ghost have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed shake your world this morning but I think I had experience how do you not know that was just your spirit your new spirit who you know you're still gossiping Cody hole he goes doesn't gossip a lot of people got a new spirit and they believe that is the Holy Ghost new heart new spiritual you have a new outlook you love the Lord a new spirit things jeans yes but get stopped and many people get mixed up when they get a new spirit the thing that's it but look at your life what are the fruits of it because the Holy Ghost has a certain fruit their fruits of the spirit and if these fruits in a manner Philip Watson and I'm turning down Sydney because you're just video or some of you people walking along this is the Prophet saying well I just can't quit drinking I just can't quit this the Holy Ghost comes to live in you to make all these cans get away from you so all that you see rhymes and when you hear you don't cut you hear and it all is no worldly music and what you do with that boy in a world when you're not girl in the world what did you anticipate any premise all these things that that your finest have doing that's what the Holy Ghost comes for the change your makeup the change your attitude and when that change takes place no you are candidate for the rapture outside of that you are doing it by information and not by genuine revelation make woman stop cutting they're here that's what the Holy Ghost is given for make them quit wearing shorts and slacks no excuses that's the profit that's his words I'm reading his words make them quit tattling all the gossiping and talking about people that's where the Holy Ghost comes to make you change so when a Branham makes it very clear what is wood it goes ting is supposed to produce it's alive it's about alive what good is it being in the methodologies and it can produce a life the books are not alive the life with a spirit walking in you you want to see something but the spirit shuts you up and kills the desire to see it your love could only go so much when the Holy Ghost comes your love goes beyond yourself because it's now his love through you the person you can talk to that your blood couldn't take when the Holy Ghost comes it makes you see them totally different because it's God he has no hands but your hands he has no feet but your feet he has no eyes but your eyes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's what it's for to make you a holy life it'll follow the instruction of the Bible every time so if you find yourself and I'm you tell me you have the Holy Ghost balloony some things you like and yeah like holy preachers say this and then you already agree with this then it's not the Holy Ghost because we're the Branham said it will follow the instructions of the Bible every time every time it copy something's apply and some things don't apply no you can't pick and choose it's not the Buffy and I eat in the snow and eating this no that's not it it's all of the wood flesh of my flesh bone of my body spirit of my spirit everything that is in court reported the Christ everything in Christ ported to the church and you are that church you are that people so you have to manifest everything that God has locked up in him that's what has to be manifested and every hindrance every obstacle in your life get rid of it that is stopping you living this life get rid of it let's today be the last day that you are putting on by the things of the world let today be the last day you have to know what's keeping you back I don't know what's keeping you back but you have to know what it is destroy it today every Amalekite every headlight every champion sight anything that's keeping you from God today I command you in the name of the Lord Jesus to get rid of it [Applause] today today today we're not leaving this place until we see the chains break off we're not trying to have a church spirit without trying to be good church members we want to be holy ghost field sons and daughters of God that'll be part of the manifestation of the sons of God that when they speak in a flash like lightning the seven thunders will utter their voices only to that group who could take and I hand it there you know the place the wood is the position I'm tired friends I'm tired of seeing people walking around in circles people have time to watch movie marathons watch TV series for hours and hours have time to do all kinds of stuff people study for university and for school and do this and when at the end of the road they cannot stand in the judgment and speak anything good and quadra see I don't even know you fighting for things that would be destroyed and when they come to their crossroads some of the wealthiest people Steve Jobs who created the Apple company he died worth about seven billion dollars he spent all that money could buy to get the best doctors to solve his medical condition and I see lead in his bed the last treat is he said I wish I had lived better he wish he could have lived better because at the end of it is money all the money he had could not change the situation I don't know if he gave His life to Christ or not but where does your soul stand today young people spend hours playing video games Winston time it was been hours on the phone talking about all kind of nonsense wastin time can't even succeed in the spirit or in the natural wasting time when time has to come to an end time with a lasts forever and as time runs out you have time to waste people have forgotten our priority what is most important because you cannot sacrifice something that's secondary the something that's primary you kind of make something that's fourth in the level of importance more important at what's worse your number one goal on this earth is deliver good everything else is sacrifice for that one but the Branham settlement is whether I meant in my family let me meant in Christ the Bible says seek first the kingdom of God first first first then His righteousness and everything else will be added young people one boyfriend/girlfriend is that'll kind of nonsense and God is nowhere in the picture and you are guaranteed for failure without the Holy Ghost guaranteed failure preachers who wanna preach that but that's the truth everything you are cheap in life without the Holy Ghost God will keep interrupting you because you are under a different covenant David asks Lord is their Lord when I look at the people around me and they're all blessed what about me said have you considered their end have you considered what they end this you cannot compare yourselves with the people in the world they have a different end your end we sell it all sleep some of us don't have an end because will change from water to immortality [Applause] have you considered your destination where concorda to do have a bird in my heart this morning because people are too casual about this thing will it become ordinary become too normal we have got to so used to

pollination that's in this city you pull your hat mighty heavy for your children you have not heavy for the young people I can have your Dirt Devil of China snatch them into the world it lost and pornography and fornication drugs and alcohol some of you don't even know what's going on with your children father's abandon their roles of leadership because the Holy Ghost is not in their lives mothers abandon their role the Bible says let the older woman teach the younger woman but the older woman spending time gossiping not seeking counsel not seeking advice not getting this very young man wasting time when they are called to be leaders but the Holy Ghost broods over us this morning to put things in order we read the scripture when the Holy Ghost is operating in the church all the Deacons are in their place the elders are in their place the officers are in their place all of the gifts will operate in the church the right way because we make the holy spirit a priority no this will feel prophecies will feel do I give my body to be put do I give to the poor all these things would have no charity which is love the bond of perfectness that charity l.o.v.e the holy ghost and self god is love if you don't have him operating on the inside we are nothing may this resonate in your soul city that you realize that you don't have the time to play games anymore you're not the

just have to wear these talking about this worldly clothes gives me a headache if I let my hair grow but there's no executors with the Holy Ghost that's what the Prophet says it's there to make it so it'll follow the word just exactly that's what the Holy Ghost is to do it's to make you man turn your head from them half-naked woman and quit lusting after them it's to quit making you smoke and drink and want to be a big-shot it'll take that out of you it'll Humble you when you do that that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's for a holy life make you quit gossiping make you quit playing cards
