[42:28] 22 we read from is actually from verse 1
[42:37] to 14 but we'll skip down
[42:39] big-big from this eighth then said he to
[42:43] his servants the wedding is ready but
[42:45] they which were bidden were not worthy
[42:48] go ye therefore into the highways and as
[42:51] many as ye shall find bid to the
[42:54] marriage so those servants went out into
[42:57] the highways and gathered together all
[42:59] as many as they found both bad and good
[43:01] and the wedding was furnished with
[43:04] guests and when the king came in to see
[43:07] the guests he saw there was a man which
[43:10] had not the wedding garment and he said
[43:14] unto Him friend how camest thou in
[43:16] hither not having a wedding garment and
[43:19] he was speechless then said the King to
[43:24] his servants bind him hand and foot take
[43:27] him away and cast him into outer
[43:29] darkness there shall be weeping and
[43:32] gnashing of teeth for many are called
[43:34] but few chosen and our second Bible read
[43:40] in his second Peter 1 verse 4 read from
[43:46] verse 1 to 4 but our pick from
[43:49] for tonight he said whereby are given
[43:52] unto us exceeding great and precious
[43:54] promises that by this ye might be
[43:57] partakers of the divine nature having
[43:59] escaped the corruption that is in the
[44:00] world through lust and beside this
[44:03] giving all diligence add to your faith
[44:05] virtue to virtue knowledge and the
[44:07] knowledge temperance and to temperance

[44:18] you that ye shall neither be barren nor
[44:20] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[44:23] Jesus Christ but he that look at these
[44:26] things is blind and cannot see afar off
[44:28] and as forgotten that he was purged from

[55:52] name of the Lord Jesus Christ because we
[55:55] are Prince cake Oh glory be to the
[55:59] Living God you may be seated tonight
[56:09] hallelujah so we know that amen the
[56:13] Bible says Jesus said I can be whole I
[56:15] come in the volume of the book so
[56:18] Genesis to Revelation is Christ and
[56:20] Christ is the word and Christ is the
[56:24] capstone Christ is the cornerstone
[56:26] Christ is the headstone that must unite
[56:29] with the body and without you Christ is
[56:32] not complete hallelujah
[56:34] so we've got to put on this group of
[56:36] righteousness
[56:37] what is this root of righteousness it is
[56:40] a perfection that was built on the day
[56:43] of Pentecost from the masterpiece with
[56:45] Abraham said he say he started on the
[56:48] day of Pentecost to build another
[56:50] masterpiece the original seed word is
[56:54] started in the first church so this
[56:57] masterpiece started somewhere it's got
[57:00] to finish somewhere hallelujah is
[57:03] started with Paul the first church the
[57:07] seed the word the word manifested the
[57:10] promise that had been given Joelle said
[57:13] it shall come to pass in the last days
[57:14] saith god I will pour out my spirit upon
[57:17] all flesh your sons and daughters shall
[57:20] prophesy the old men shall dream dreams
[57:22] your young men shall see visions what he
[57:26] would do in this last day even in this
[57:29] last two thousand years what is it
[57:32] it is Christ coming back again
[57:35] hallelujah
[57:36] what is it it is Christ coming back
[57:38] again how is he coming back he made
[57:45] promises now notice it started out as
[57:48] the original and Jesus says this word of
[57:51] God is his seat that is so uh so uh sold
[57:55] and he was the soul the seed was the
[57:58] word and NEC that is that abides alone
[58:01] does nothing he's got to fall into the
[58:04] ground to bring forth through touching a
[58:07] king hallelujah
[58:09] so Paul went to the ground but it
[58:12] remained there it had to bring for
[58:14] another see that Uranus came on the
[58:17] scene it couldn't stay there to bring
[58:19] for another sea and the Prophet said he
[58:22] went on down up to love Asia brotherly
[58:24] kindness hallelujah
[58:26] but out of that God had to call him
[58:28] right now amen because all of them went
[58:32] into the nomination but this bride has
[58:35] no denomination that will come out of
[58:36] her
[58:37] there's no many ideas that will come out
[58:39] of here she's the sinless virtuous bread
[58:42] of Jesus Christ
[58:43] she's a word seed now and no seed is
[58:47] contaminated once it comes from the
[58:49] original see you believe that tonight
[58:52] there's no contamination in that
[58:54] original seed
[58:55] [Applause]
[58:57] [Music]
[58:58] [Applause]
[59:02] so the headstone the capstone comes upon
[59:07] that bride not laudation because out of
[59:11] loud Asia comes the bride to get our
[59:15] wedding garment
[59:16] now that wedding garment is not for
[59:19] anybody it is for the bride of Jesus
[59:21] Christ that has been called out and
[59:25] positionally pleased to receive it
[59:28] hallelujah hallelujah the wedding
[59:31] command is not for church member it's
[59:33] not for big believer in stuff or
[59:35] denomination is exclusive right promise
[59:38] it's exclusive right comment be the name
[59:50] of the Lord we made and the Prophet said
[59:54] Amen is got to fall into the ground to
[59:57] bring forth is production again and this
[1:00:00] see that perfect church fell to the
[1:00:03] ground
[1:00:03] admission room where she become a
[1:00:05] denomination but she's not to remain
[1:00:08] there it is the original seed nothing
[1:00:12] can keep it down they try to keep it in
[1:00:15] a roman tomb it couldn't hold it
[1:00:17] on the third day he broke forth
[1:00:20] hallelujah they tried to bind it a bay
[1:00:23] feed them to Lions but they couldn't
[1:00:26] kill it
[1:00:26] they tried to fry it out of John but the
[1:00:29] Korean fried a holy goes out of him so
[1:00:32] this wedding commando man can take it
[1:00:34] away from you brother you have been
[1:00:36] designed to fit into the wedding comment
[1:00:38] of the world that is why you escape the
[1:00:41] phone's Christ you escaped false
[1:00:43] anointed no mass idea can tie you down
[1:00:47] hallelujah because you are here to take
[1:00:50] the headstone my sheep hear my voice
[1:00:58] a stranger they will not follow
[1:01:01] hallelujah
[1:01:02] that is why they see the wedding garment
[1:01:05] is is you but it doesn't sound right
[1:01:11] I am NOT the wedding Cummings I've got

[1:20:18] Holy Spirit it is the only way
[1:20:22] hallelujah the only sign that God will
[1:20:25] ever pass because it is the literal life
[1:20:29] of Jesus Christ returned back into the
[1:20:32] believer so these are not know this this
[1:20:40] faith all the way to charity is the
[1:20:42] literal life of Jesus Christ which is
[1:20:46] the seven rainbow coat of Joseph God
[1:20:51] couldn't build a check on Isaac love on

[1:22:29] of Jesus Christ returned back into the
[1:22:32] believer now here we come back from them
[1:22:35] from what the church has got to do the
[1:22:37] talking has got to be applied and I was
[1:22:41] got to be displayed when I see the Blood
