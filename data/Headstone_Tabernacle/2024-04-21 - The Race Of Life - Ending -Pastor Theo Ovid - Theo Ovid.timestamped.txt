[7:12] certainly want to thank all of these
[7:13] groups and certainly if you would like
[7:15] to be involved in one of these groups we
[7:17] certainly encourage it and we ask you to
[7:19] just let one of the deacons know or let
[7:21] brother Steven oliv know as well so may
[7:24] the Lord richly bless you we are not we
[7:26] are not finished yet last week Wednesday
[7:29] it was our pastor's birthday how many
[7:31] appreciate our
[7:35] pastor
[7:36] so everything that has been said thus
[7:40] far he has been aware of it what what
[7:41] what we going into now he is not aware
[7:43] of it so this is this is where we
[7:47] exercise a little you know discretion
[7:49] and Authority Under headship but there
[7:51] are some things we we you know can show
[7:53] him everything you know so but we
[7:55] certainly love and appreciate our pastor
[7:58] andov we salute you you know and was
[8:02] standing preaching this morning and I
[8:04] telling myself wait like he getting
[8:05] older he getting better at this thing
[8:07] but you know you see something there and
[8:09] it's like you know so certainly he's not
[8:10] let letting age slowing down slowing him
[8:13] slow him down at all so we certainly
[8:14] love him and appreciate him and there's
[8:16] one scripture uh that I want to read
[8:19] just from Jeremiah
[8:21] 3:15 and this is my testimony and I
[8:24] trust is yours as well but here it is
[8:26] the Lord is speaking through Jeremiah
[8:28] and I will give you pastors according to
[8:30] mine
[8:31] heart which shall feed you with
[8:33] knowledge and understanding and that is
[8:35] my testimony so I believe the Lord has
[8:37] given us a pastor after the Lord's own
[8:39] heart that will lead
[8:41] us feed us with knowledge and
[8:45] understanding so we could deal with the
[8:47] issues of Life the challenges of life
[8:51] and to point us to Jesus
[8:53] Christ and that I think is the most
[8:55] important thing because the one thing
[8:56] you know about brother the over he
[8:58] doesn't Point people to himself he
[8:59] doesn't Point people to headstone
[9:01] Tabernacle he is a damant to point
[9:03] people to the Lord Jesus Christ he is a
[9:06] sign pointing to the Lord Jesus Christ
[9:09] it's something that's a foundation of
[9:10] this church and it sets you know so many
[9:13] things in order because in a time when
[9:14] you see so many people pulling people to
[9:16] themselves and saying you know unless
[9:18] you go through me you can't get anything
[9:19] and that kind of foolishness this is a
[9:21] very very very strong position we take
[9:23] here that we are just tools in the
[9:25] Harvest pointing to the coming this
[9:28] context Where We Are under the Good
[9:30] Shepherd the great Shepherd that God has
[9:32] blessed with an Earthly Shepherd who has
[9:34] a heart for the sheep and operates in
[9:37] the way that he does so but over may the
[9:38] Lord richly bless you happy birthday may
[9:40] God grant you many more
[9:42] years of life of health of strength and
[9:45] the wisdom to lead this
[9:47] church and um so he doesn't know this
[9:51] part so the next part are going to put
[9:52] him on the spot we like to invite the
[9:54] church downstairs right afterwards we
[9:56] have some cake and some ice cream and
[9:59] you would like everyone to participate
[10:01] in and even before that we we have a
[10:02] custom cake that we want you to stick
[10:04] the cake with sister ID so I know CH
[10:08] don't know this either so this is now
[10:09] being this is the first full second full
[10:11] F just unfolding here this evening s but
[10:14] but we do want to be able to celebrate
[10:15] with the pastor um on his birthday so
[10:18] may the Lord richly bless you church and
[10:20] um as the ushers and deacons Usher us
[10:22] downstairs for part two of the service
[10:24] where we are able to give honor to where
[10:26] honor is due while we could give the
[10:28] honor that is due so so may the Lord
[10:30] Rich you bless you may your faith be
[10:32] strong and may God continue to lift You
[10:35] Higher and Higher and but over said
[10:37] something really powerful today and I I
[10:39] trust it resonate with you he said as a
[10:41] Christian your battle cannot always be
[10:43] just fighting with sin it needs to move
[10:46] from the struggle with sin to the
[10:47] struggle of growth where the focus is no
[10:50] longer about the lusting and the
[10:52] fornication and these things that that
[10:54] and and and the Bible said to to to to
[10:56] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[10:58] that's your reason able service meaning
[11:00] as the foundation and that the battle
[11:02] becomes adding to your faith virtue and
[11:03] knowledge and Temperance and patience
[11:05] and godliness so that is the growth so
[11:07] I'm looking to see Sons and Daughters
[11:09] come into spiritual maturity because
[11:11] when you have that level of spiritual
[11:13] maturity your roots get deep and no
[11:15] matter which way the wind blows your
[11:16] tree don't get pushed down because you
[11:18] have been through some stuff and the
[11:20] stuff that you have been through have
[11:21] you solid you might feel weak you might
[11:23] feel tired but you're not going to go
[11:25] back in the world to him that overcome
[11:27] it I'll make a pillar in the Church
[11:30] pillar in the Tabernacle pillar in the
[11:32] temple so may the Lord Rich you bless
[11:34] you stay on fire don't let take don't
[11:36] let the devil take your joy away
[11:38] whenever the Trials come look the devil
[11:39] in the face and say hahaa and say Boo

[11:44] Rapture I'm going to make it I'm going
