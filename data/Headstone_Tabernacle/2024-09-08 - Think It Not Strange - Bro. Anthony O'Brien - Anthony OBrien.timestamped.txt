[53:41] kind of warming up here
[53:43] amen think it not
[53:46] strange and when God gave the prophet
[53:50] seven visions that must come to pass
[53:54] before God come
[53:57] uh during the unfolding of
[54:00] it um there were three isms that God
[54:03] revealed to the prophet isn't that right
[54:06] that would rise up during that
[54:09] time um and it is said here that these
[54:12] three isms the prophet said here on um
[54:14] broken system sisters he said um that
[54:18] these three
[54:19] isms
[54:21] Nazism fascism and
[54:24] communism he said and I said they all
[54:27] wind up in
[54:29] communism the prophet said Russia will
[54:31] take it all in
[54:33] communism so that's how it it ended up
[54:37] but uh these three isms rose up and of
[54:39] course as we know these are these are
[54:41] spirits and one of these
[54:43] isms was Nazism as we know and when we
[54:47] speak of Nazism obviously we speak of
[54:49] Adolf
[54:50] Hitler and history tells us that Adolf
[54:53] Hitler had somewhat of a disturbing past
[54:57] he had an abusive father his mother
[55:00] would always defend him in his drunken
[55:03] episodes and so forth and this kind of
[55:06] created a love and adoring for his
[55:08] mother that would last until her death
[55:10] he grew up as a struggling youth he
[55:12] tried to applied for Art
[55:14] School uh because he fashioned himself
[55:16] an artist um but he was rejected twice
[55:19] and I'm I'm told that the second time he
[55:21] was told not to come
[55:23] back around this time his mother passes
[55:25] away so so he goes through a lot of
[55:28] tragedy um and of course he got involved
[55:30] in the World War I and different things
[55:32] and and you know the whole story wound
[55:34] up that he ended up being the leader of
[55:36] the German Workers Party which ended up
[55:38] being the Nazi party where he found his
[55:41] voice um to be able to voice his uh idea
[55:45] of the world of course we know how that
[55:48] ended
[55:49] up but a part I wanted to get to In This
[55:52] Strange
[55:54] story is that in the midst of all of
[55:57] this that was happening in that time all
[55:59] that was unfolding let's say in arolf
[56:01] Hitler's
[56:02] life historians cannot quite pinpoint
[56:06] yet where his hatred for the Jewish
[56:09] people started or where that came from
[56:14] they actually still don't know they
[56:16] don't know if it was when he was
[56:17] rejected at Art School they don't know
[56:19] whether he just had a despise for them
[56:21] or what it was it was a mysterious thing
[56:25] it still remained S A mysterious thing
[56:28] today where this anti what they call
[56:31] anti-Semitism or where this hatred for
[56:34] the Jews actually started up but it was
[56:38] a very key thing that evolved in the
[56:41] whole unfolding of World War
[56:45] II and it was a strange
[56:49] thing even other regimes that rose up in
[56:53] that time talking about Joseph's Stalin
[56:57] and uh Benito molini of Italy also
[57:01] shared similar anti-semitic laws as well
[57:05] which means in the midst of all this
[57:07] World War II that would have unfolded
[57:09] during the 1930s and
[57:11] 40s there was this strange hatred for
[57:14] the Jews that was taking place as a
[57:17] strong
[57:18] undercurrent um in spite the war and the
[57:21] the the battles and conflicts that was
[57:23] taking place between countries and and
[57:26] so
[57:27] on and
[57:30] um and as we know God used these isms as
[57:33] they were described by the Lord God
[57:35] called them
[57:35] isms to drive the people of God back to
[57:39] their
[57:40] Homeland they needed to be driven back
[57:44] in order to fulfill prophecy later
[57:46] on here's a prophet saying on the 3
[57:49] Exodus he said and as it was in Germany
[57:53] and all up into Russia and in Italy the
[57:56] people raised up Joseph's uh Hitler and
[58:00] Stalin
[58:01] musolini who hated the
[58:04] Jew they had to go back to their
[58:08] Homeland Prophet said God he's praying
[58:11] in this message he said God you got ways
[58:14] of doing
[58:15] things that we don't
[58:18] understand and you pressed them no home
[58:22] in
[58:23] Germany everything taken away from them
[58:27] also in Italy and in Russia no place to
[58:30] go and they were sent back to their
[58:33] Homeland just to fulfill the
[58:37] word oh the loving hand of God the
[58:40] prophet
[58:43] said doesn't doesn't sound
[58:47] loving but it is what what the prophet
[58:50] described it as he said how sometimes it
[58:54] looks cruel right
[58:56] of the way that that people
[58:59] suffer but it still he said he call it
[59:02] it's the tender hand of
[59:05] Jehovah leading his little children we
[59:09] thank you Lord amen praise God now
[59:11] precious Pastor over always referenced
[59:13] this so I just wanted to read it back
[59:14] what he said said now I pray God as I
[59:18] see the day that the denomination is
[59:21] pressing the
[59:22] Believers and excommunicating them so
[59:25] this is prophecy now
[59:26] saying that their name must be on a book
[59:28] that they're lost having to do with the
[59:29] other group it's only the tender hand of
[59:33] Jehovah leading them to the tree of
[59:37] life I pray God he said that each one I
[59:41] know they will because it's your word
[59:44] and it can't
[59:46] fail and may we be led to the tree of
[59:50] life that we may be a possessor of
[59:53] eternal life and see the hand of God and
[59:58] we by the eyes of Faith look Beyond
[1:00:01] these Shadows that we're walking in
[1:00:04] today and see the promised land laying
[1:00:07] just ahead amen and amen do you
[1:00:10] appreciate that this morning hallelujah
[1:00:12] it's the tender hand of
[1:00:14] God he call it the loving hand of God
[1:00:19] and so God often uses these things what
[1:00:23] look like cruel things what look like
[1:00:27] harsh things or what look like things
[1:00:30] that are not to be
[1:00:32] desired sometimes he uses these things
[1:00:35] to get us in position to bring us back
[1:00:39] into the place he want us to be
[1:00:42] in uh that is why we ought not to think
[1:00:45] it a strange thing when things happen to
[1:00:48] us as if some evil thing is taking place
[1:00:53] with
[1:00:53] you think it not strange this morning
[1:00:57] that God is using your
[1:01:00] circumstance that God is using your
[1:01:03] trial because there's a place he has for
[1:01:06] you this morning that he wants you to be
[1:01:09] in he wants to bring you into a large
[1:01:13] place a wide place a great place a land
[1:01:19] flowing with milk and honey a land
[1:01:24] flowing with prosper perity with the
[1:01:27] Holy Ghost with healing for your body
[1:01:31] healing for your spirit healing for your
[1:01:34] soul where your family could come in oh
[1:01:38] Hallelujah because of the labors that
[1:01:40] you did in the
[1:01:41] sewing they could come in in the
[1:01:46] reaping and enjoy the
[1:01:49] Harvest praise God and amen hallelujah
[1:01:52] so that's what God wants to do this
[1:01:54] morning I feel yes sir and that's more
[1:01:56] or less the summary of it amen so God
[1:01:59] often uses these things to bring his
[1:02:01] word to pass in our lives and often
[1:02:04] times these things seem strange to us
[1:02:07] true we describe them as
[1:02:10] strange strange because we are not
[1:02:14] familiar with God's ways and God's ways
[1:02:18] of doing things isn't that right Isaiah
[1:02:21] 55 says my ways are higher than your
[1:02:24] ways and my thoughts are higher than
[1:02:27] your
[1:02:28] thoughts uh and this this Chasm that
[1:02:32] exists now between our ways and God's
[1:02:36] ways didn't always
[1:02:38] exist but it happened because of
[1:02:41] Sin Sin caused man to get out of touch
[1:02:46] with God's ways and God's motives and
[1:02:50] objectives so much so that it's almost
[1:02:53] opposite or in reverse isn't that right
[1:02:57] and most times we are
[1:03:00] unaware of God's favor in our lives even
[1:03:04] amidst the
[1:03:05] misfortunes that life often presents to
[1:03:09] us we are still unaware of his
[1:03:12] favor in our
[1:03:17] lives you know it's funny because uh as
[1:03:20] I'm saying this I remembered that uh we
[1:03:22] had gone through an incident about a
[1:03:24] couple years ago or three years ago
[1:03:26] um you know me and my wife were home
[1:03:28] working
[1:03:30] and uh all of a sudden this truck came
[1:03:32] into the area and it started doing work
[1:03:34] on the sewage
[1:03:35] line and then the entire sewage system
[1:03:38] came up through my toilet through my
[1:03:41] shower through my bathroom came into the
[1:03:45] house and started moving
[1:03:49] across the living room but the funny
[1:03:53] thing is as crazy as that sounds and we
[1:03:56] had to deal with all that on the
[1:03:57] aftermath um which was quite an
[1:04:00] episode um the interesting thing is I
[1:04:03] looked and I saw the hand of God even in
[1:04:05] that
[1:04:07] situation because when it came up in
[1:04:10] there my wife had the the the the
[1:04:13] responsiveness to grab certain things
[1:04:15] and get it out of the way to save
[1:04:17] it uh and I thank God for her but there
[1:04:23] it was interesting because when the the
[1:04:25] the stuff came down it came down a step
[1:04:27] that was in there and when I looked I
[1:04:30] saw that it for some reason I I don't
[1:04:33] know to this day but there are certain
[1:04:35] rooms it just didn't go
[1:04:37] into I don't ask you to explain it
[1:04:41] because it's water it's it's it's moving
[1:04:44] how come it didn't go here how come it
[1:04:47] didn't go there and when I went into
[1:04:49] those rooms there were valuable things
[1:04:52] things that would have been utterly
[1:04:54] destroyed had that flowed into that that
[1:04:57] that room there and so I could still say
[1:05:00] without a shadow of a doubt that even in
[1:05:03] that
[1:05:04] situation the hand of God was still
[1:05:07] there even though he he allowed things
[1:05:10] to happen to you but you could still
[1:05:13] safely say it could have been
[1:05:15] worse but for the grace of God it could
[1:05:19] have gone way South if God wasn't in the
[1:05:23] midst he don't let you go through
[1:05:26] something where his grace can't keep you
[1:05:30] and for every
[1:05:32] Temptation he makes a way of
[1:05:35] Escape for your soul this morning and
[1:05:39] like a a bird out of the snare of the
[1:05:41] Fowler we are escaped this morning we
[1:05:44] ought to be happy today we ought to give
[1:05:47] God praise every day for the things he's
[1:05:51] kept us
[1:05:52] from there ought to be a praise on your
[1:05:55] lips
[1:05:56] every time you walk out your front door
[1:06:00] God you've kept me you've been keeping
[1:06:03] me you will keep me in my
[1:06:08] situation oh
[1:06:13] hallelujah oh glory to
[1:06:16] God
[1:06:18] Amen David said his praise shall be upon
[1:06:22] my lips Contin continually amen
[1:06:25] continually upon my lips thank you
[1:06:29] that's right we ought not to ever stop
[1:06:31] praising
[1:06:33] God because there's things we don't know
[1:06:35] about that God is keeping us from and
[1:06:39] giving God praise and worship it's like
[1:06:42] paying rent for the things that you got
[1:06:44] for
[1:06:44] [Music]
[1:06:45] free so pay your rent this morning
[1:06:49] you're in AR rise of some praise this
[1:06:51] morning you're in AR rise of some
[1:06:54] worship this morning
[1:06:56] oh Hall he brought you through a mighty
[1:06:59] long way and when I look back I
[1:07:04] realized where would I be was not for
[1:07:08] the grace of God he was with me in the
[1:07:11] shadow he was with me in the trial he
[1:07:15] was with me in the Tempest and when the
[1:07:17] Storm come to blow me over I saw one
[1:07:21] walking under water and he said fair not
[1:07:26] oh Hallelujah that one is here this
[1:07:29] morning he's always been
[1:07:32] here don't let the
[1:07:35] devil steal your
[1:07:37] joy oh
[1:07:40] hallelujah oh Hal praise the Risen
[1:07:44] King
[1:07:47] amen he is Jehovah
[1:07:50] Shaman God is present with us
[1:07:55] he's a present
[1:07:57] help in time of trouble and in a time of
[1:08:01] trouble David said he will hide me in
[1:08:04] his
[1:08:05] Pavilion in the secret
[1:08:09] place you know what a pavilion
[1:08:11] is that's a wide Place have enough room
[1:08:15] to put your your fireplace and to place
[1:08:18] your cut just for the journey hallelujah
[1:08:22] oh
[1:08:23] hallelujah oh my
[1:08:26] even in the
[1:08:27] storm we could find
[1:08:30] comfort in the word of
[1:08:32] God Amen and
[1:08:36] amen so so and these misfortunes come in
[1:08:40] many forms on now what we just talked
[1:08:43] about uh with Adolf Hitler there was a
[1:08:45] great Misfortune that was going on but
[1:08:48] that was God moving even in in the in
[1:08:50] the in the macro level right you know of
[1:08:53] it it was a war conflict but in there
[1:08:56] yes sir the grace of God pushing the
[1:08:58] Jews towards their
[1:09:00] Homeland so I want you to see it now and
[1:09:03] this is what it is sometimes it might
[1:09:06] come as a loss of a loved
[1:09:08] one sometimes sickness takes a
[1:09:10] home some of us might lose homes houses
[1:09:15] possessions as the song says some
[1:09:17] through the
[1:09:18] waters some through the flood some
[1:09:21] through great
[1:09:22] trials all through the
[1:09:25] blood the blood that cleanses us and the
[1:09:29] blood that gives us Fellowship one with
[1:09:31] another amen and despite what happens we
[1:09:34] can still have Fellowship one with
[1:09:37] another because the blood of Jesus that
[1:09:39] was shed for me was shed for you
[1:09:42] also it was shed for your brother it was
[1:09:45] shed for your sister it was shed for the
[1:09:48] bum on the street it was shed for the
[1:09:51] tax collector it was shed for the banker
[1:09:54] it was shed for the politician
[1:09:56] and if you really understand that this
[1:09:58] morning then you could treat each other
[1:10:00] with love we could treat each other with
[1:10:03] respects because the same blood for me
[1:10:06] is the same blood for you oh and if
[1:10:09] there's hope for me then there's hope
[1:10:12] for you this morning and if he did it
[1:10:14] for me he could do it for you this
[1:10:17] morning if he saved me he can save you
[1:10:22] there's nowh you can go that the Great
[1:10:25] of God cannot reach you He's Got The
[1:10:29] Whole
[1:10:30] World in His Hands your daughter is in
[1:10:34] his hands your son is in his hands your
[1:10:38] wife is in his hands your husband is in
[1:10:40] his hands your home is in his hands your
[1:10:45] family your job where you go Hallelujah
[1:10:51] is in his hands this morning oh
[1:10:53] hallelujah amen brother bati
[1:10:56] oh
[1:10:57] my
[1:10:59] Hallelujah
[1:11:01] Glory
[1:11:03] oh Hallelujah in this will I be
[1:11:06] confident one thing have I
[1:11:09] desired that will I seek after this
[1:11:12] morning that I may dwell in the house of
[1:11:14] the
[1:11:15] Lord all the days of my life we are in
[1:11:19] his house this
[1:11:20] morning I thank
[1:11:22] God that through it all he gave me the
[1:11:24] faith to get up this morning to come to
[1:11:28] his house amen God bless you on the
[1:11:30] internet you're in his house virtually
[1:11:32] this morning amen praise God Amen praise
[1:11:36] God hallelujah
[1:11:38] hallelujah to inquire in his
[1:11:41] Temple to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:11:44] David loved inquiring of the Lord yes
[1:11:47] that's right to to seek counsel to find
[1:11:50] out what to do next one of his favorite
[1:11:52] PHR phrases and I hope to preach on it
[1:11:54] one time
[1:11:55] David always say bring me an
[1:11:58] ephod bring me that prayer garment I
[1:12:01] want to find out what God wants bring me
[1:12:04] an
[1:12:05] epon let me get down in pray amen oh my
[1:12:09] all right so where we at now sometimes
[1:12:11] six takes a hole right but God all all
[1:12:14] come through the blood so a Christian
[1:12:17] life is not a strange
[1:12:21] thing it's not might be strange to the
[1:12:24] world amen but it isn't really a strange
[1:12:27] thing see it's
[1:12:30] predestinated it's
[1:12:32] intentional it's ordained of God the
[1:12:36] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:12:38] of the Lord they are ordained by the
[1:12:40] Lord that even if you fall he' make a he
[1:12:44] would pull you
[1:12:45] up because he's walking with
[1:12:48] you you're not alone isn't that right
[1:12:53] praise God so
[1:12:55] so that's how it is it's not strange see
[1:12:58] God himself is not really described as
[1:13:01] strange if we do check it he's described
[1:13:04] as strange by
[1:13:05] others but he usually he's usually
[1:13:09] described as mysterious right so we say
[1:13:10] that our God is
[1:13:12] mysterious uh you know our God is is is
[1:13:15] is wonderful he's glorious he's
[1:13:18] Majestic but we never call him strange
[1:13:20] you see strange has a kind of a negative
[1:13:23] connotation right
[1:13:26] you know yeah strange Gods he himself is
[1:13:29] not strange watch God throughout
[1:13:31] scripture he actually hates the strange
[1:13:33] thing right right he usually expresses a
[1:13:37] certain level of disdain or dislike or
[1:13:41] discontent or dissatisfaction for the
[1:13:44] strange
[1:13:46] thing strange things don't really please
[1:13:50] God the wrath of God is kindled against
[1:13:54] those that did strange things in
[1:13:57] scripture they are not pleasing unto the
[1:14:00] Lord anytime God calls anything strange
[1:14:04] it is usually when he's upset with
[1:14:07] it you know it have certain words that
[1:14:09] Daddy does use when he's angry you know
[1:14:12] Daddy is angry when he calls you by your
[1:14:14] full name or when Mommy or your
[1:14:17] government name when Mommy is angry when
[1:14:19] she calls you by your full name or or
[1:14:21] when he says things a certain way you
[1:14:23] know there a certain word that comes out
[1:14:26] well if we learn God's ways and if we
[1:14:29] begin to learn God's thoughts through
[1:14:31] prayer and through having a relationship
[1:14:34] with God and through reading the
[1:14:36] scripture and the word because as
[1:14:39] brother brandham said if we want to grow
[1:14:41] in God we have to read our Bible and
[1:14:45] pray every day and even in that simple
[1:14:47] way we could begin to learn his ways and
[1:14:51] as we learn his ways we begin to learn
[1:14:53] what he don't like
[1:14:55] and what he like you know it's like
[1:14:58] somebody goes to the restaurant all the
[1:14:59] time and they say give me my favorite
[1:15:01] and and the waiter says coming right up
[1:15:04] there's no need for that level of
[1:15:06] communication CU he already knows what
[1:15:08] this guy likes he comes there all the
[1:15:11] time and so if you want to give God a
[1:15:13] good worship a good praise from your
[1:15:16] lips and you have to know what your
[1:15:18] father likes and what how to approach
[1:15:22] him uh what the approach is
[1:15:25] when coming to Daddy isn't that right
[1:15:28] amen and amen
[1:15:30] so so so as we learn him we understand
[1:15:33] what is not pleasing to him and anything
[1:15:35] anytime God calls anything strange
[1:15:38] usually he's upset with it when he's not
[1:15:41] pleased with it if you want to trouble
[1:15:44] God start bringing strange things to him
[1:15:48] and you see what he
[1:15:49] does an example of this is in Leviticus
[1:15:52] chapter 10 and in the previous chapter
[1:15:55] Moses and Aaron are actually offering
[1:15:57] spiritual sacrifices unto God and
[1:16:00] everything is going according to plan
[1:16:02] right um we won't read it but they
[1:16:05] offering sacrifices there's certain uh
[1:16:07] exacts that God is giving to Aaron and
[1:16:11] instructions how to cut the sacrifice
[1:16:13] and different things and so they're
[1:16:15] doing it according to the
[1:16:17] instruction Moses is uh getting the
[1:16:20] instruction and they are doing it
[1:16:22] according to instruction sir and guess
[1:16:24] guess what God is blessing it at the end
[1:16:27] of that chapter N9 you will see that the
[1:16:29] fire comes down and consumes the
[1:16:33] sacrifice and the people give a great
[1:16:35] shout unto the
[1:16:37] Lord um and this is how God likes things
[1:16:40] done in a certain order and instruction
[1:16:43] right according to the things that are
[1:16:45] patterned in heaven uh that is how he
[1:16:47] give to Moses amen so it's not just
[1:16:50] spiky VI it's a there's a there's a
[1:16:53] there's a reason for it
[1:16:55] amen and even if you don't understand it
[1:16:58] fully just follow the instructions
[1:17:01] instru the understanding will come
[1:17:04] later but a good soldier knows how to in
[1:17:07] follow the instructions if he says stand
[1:17:10] here in a vertical position that's what
[1:17:13] that means stand exactly there you can't
[1:17:16] stand where you feel like because it BM
[1:17:19] might drop right there you weren't told
[1:17:21] to stand there you were told to stand
[1:17:23] here follow the
[1:17:26] instruction but in Leviticus 10 verse1
[1:17:29] it says and naab and Abu the sons of Aon
[1:17:34] this is tragic these are the very sons
[1:17:37] of the
[1:17:38] priests that are uh doing this the
[1:17:41] sacrifice and so on he said my they had
[1:17:45] their own anointing but
[1:17:47] but my the sons of Aaron took their took
[1:17:50] watch look what it says he says the sons
[1:17:53] of Aaron took either of them his censor
[1:17:55] right and put fire therein they put
[1:17:59] their fire therein and put incense there
[1:18:01] on and offered Strange Fire before the
[1:18:05] Lord which he commanded them
[1:18:08] not and there went out fire from the
[1:18:11] Lord and devoured them and they
[1:18:15] died before the Lord and then Moses said
[1:18:19] unto Aaron this is it that the Lord
[1:18:22] spake saying I will be sanctified in
[1:18:25] them that come n me and before all the
[1:18:30] people I will be
[1:18:32] glorified and Aaron held his
[1:18:35] peace so those guys
[1:18:39] perished for not having uh fulfilled the
[1:18:43] law and following the instruction that
[1:18:46] God give and they give strange incense
[1:18:50] they brought a Strange Fire unto the
[1:18:52] Lord and so we ought to be real careful
[1:18:55] with this
[1:18:56] scripture uh and I think it's a lesson
[1:18:58] for us an example for us to see how God
[1:19:03] deals with strange things when we come
[1:19:06] to church like we come this morning we
[1:19:09] ought not to bring a Strange
[1:19:11] Fire or a strange offering unto the Lord
[1:19:15] something that he's not familiar with he
[1:19:18] wants a broken heart this morning he
[1:19:21] wants a contrite spirit he doesn't want
[1:19:25] Pride the Bible says he resisted the
[1:19:27] proud and the arrogant and he know them
[1:19:29] are far off he has no relationship with
[1:19:33] them amen isn't that right so hearing is
[1:19:37] the lesson in this scripture that
[1:19:38] anytime you find yourself not obeying
[1:19:42] God's word then you're doing a strange
[1:19:45] thing oh Hallelujah so let's never be
[1:19:47] caught in Disobedience this
[1:19:49] morning we want to offer an acceptable
[1:19:52] sacrifice this morning we want to come
[1:19:55] holy into the Lord holy into his
[1:19:58] presence holy into his Sanctuary we want
[1:20:02] to have the consciousness of knowing
[1:20:05] that these ordinances and even coming
[1:20:08] into this building this morning is a
[1:20:10] holy thing to approach his presence to
[1:20:14] come into His Sanctuary it's a a
[1:20:16] privilege to come here and if you have
[1:20:18] the ability to come here then we ought
[1:20:21] to walk in a holy way we ought to walk
[1:20:24] walk in a purified way in a Sanctified
[1:20:28] way not bringing strange fires unto the
[1:20:33] Lord isn't that right because there's a
[1:20:37] judgment clearly from scripture we could
[1:20:40] see we're bringing Strange Fire all
[1:20:43] these things are lessons now we have to
[1:20:45] take because God wants to take the
[1:20:47] church to the next
[1:20:49] level there's going to come a time when
[1:20:51] people won't just be able to Walt in
[1:20:53] here
[1:20:55] um you know
[1:20:57] unchecked WS in here um you know anyhow
[1:21:02] or any way you feel like on cuz after a
[1:21:06] while God's going to say he's had enough
[1:21:09] and when God has had enough he's had
[1:21:12] enough he's a god of Mercy but he's also
[1:21:16] the god of judgment and he will judge
[1:21:19] right because he's given people a chance
[1:21:21] to get with the program
[1:21:24] uh but we have to know how to follow his
[1:21:26] rules so that's what this word is all
[1:21:28] about Amen to understand what God wants
[1:21:31] so that we could obey his Commandments
[1:21:33] amen so then this strange thing happen
[1:21:35] is not all right so now watch Genesis 35
[1:21:38] here's another example Genesis 35 verse1
[1:21:41] God said unto Jacob arise go up to
[1:21:44] Bethel and dwell there and make there an
[1:21:48] altar unto God that appeared unto thee
[1:21:51] when thou flest from the face of Esau
[1:21:55] thy brother so God is summoning Jacob
[1:21:59] and his house to come up to bethl to
[1:22:02] worship and God this is look listen to
[1:22:05] Jacob's response to God's call to go up
[1:22:09] to
[1:22:10] worship listen to this response here and
[1:22:13] Jacob said unto his household and to all
[1:22:17] that were with him put away the strange
[1:22:20] gods that are among you and be clean
[1:22:25] and change your garments in other words
[1:22:28] change your clothes don't just roll off
[1:22:30] your bed in the morning and come up to
[1:22:33] worship no no no no go take a bath go
[1:22:35] get refreshed even your natural self
[1:22:38] he's urging them and he's admonishing
[1:22:40] them to get cleaned up get cleaned up
[1:22:44] naturally get cleaned up spiritually he
[1:22:47] said and let us arise in verse three and
[1:22:50] go up to bethl and I will make there an
[1:22:53] altar unto God who answered me in the
[1:22:56] day of my distress and was with me in
[1:22:59] the way which I went oh Hallelujah I
[1:23:03] just love this this morning because it
[1:23:05] shows that there's an approach to God oh
[1:23:08] Hal because Jacob knew that there were
[1:23:10] people in the camp who had their isms he
[1:23:13] didn't want that to hinder his worship
[1:23:16] he didn't want that to hinder his
[1:23:18] offering so he told them put away those
[1:23:22] strange Gods put away way all those
[1:23:25] strange Idols you have among you because
[1:23:27] we're going to turn the season now we're
[1:23:29] going to change the tide now we we can't
[1:23:32] go on the same way we've been going
[1:23:34] because you've been called we've been
[1:23:36] summoned to worship oh have you been
[1:23:39] summoned to worship this morning did God
[1:23:42] call you out of the myy Clay did God
[1:23:46] bring you out is God speaking to you
[1:23:49] this morning then put away strange
[1:23:52] things from among you this morning he
[1:23:54] says be separate walk before me and be
[1:23:59] therefore perfect even as my Father in
[1:24:03] Heaven is perfect amen it's a call to
[1:24:08] Perfection amen Deuteronomy chapter two
[1:24:10] also but jaran wax fat we're just giving
[1:24:13] some examples here of God's
[1:24:16] language how he talks about the strange
[1:24:19] thing right Deuteronomy 32 but Juran
[1:24:23] waxed fat and kicked and thou art wax
[1:24:26] and fat Thou Art grown thick Thou Art
[1:24:29] covered with fatness and then he forsook
[1:24:32] God which made him and lightly esteemed
[1:24:36] the rock of his
[1:24:38] salvation verse 16 says they provoked
[1:24:40] him to jealousy with strange Gods with
[1:24:44] Abominations provoked they him to anger
[1:24:49] and they sacrificed unto devils not to
[1:24:51] God to Gods whom they knew not
[1:24:55] to New Gods that came newly up whom your
[1:24:59] fathers feared not oh my my my isn't
[1:25:03] this a warning this morning a bunch of
[1:25:05] new stuff that people want to dig up or
[1:25:08] find or fish for praise God and worship
[1:25:11] that that that a good Pentecostal can't
[1:25:14] even agree with my isn't that right
[1:25:17] praise God but they they they finding
[1:25:18] new things to worship New Gods when this
[1:25:21] God of Abraham is who brought us out out
[1:25:24] of the Wilderness this this God of Jacob
[1:25:27] is who was there with us and and who
[1:25:29] presented us a vision this God of Isaac
[1:25:32] this God of Moses this God of
[1:25:35] Deliverance this God of power who's been
[1:25:38] with us all these years oh how can we

[1:25:45] one who put shoes on our feet when he
[1:25:48] was the one who put money in our pockets
[1:25:51] when he was the one who when we had
[1:25:54] nothing thing to eat he provided for us
[1:25:57] oh remember the Lord in the days of thy
[1:26:00] youth oh
[1:26:02] hallelujah oh David said I've never seen
[1:26:07] the righteous forsaken I've never seen
[1:26:11] his seed beg
[1:26:13] bread that is the God we serve this
[1:26:16] morning the devil is a liar to come to
[1:26:19] try and present a new thing this morning
[1:26:22] we are already too far up the road to
[1:26:26] turn our backs now on the things that we
[1:26:29] know to be true oh our faith has only
[1:26:33] grown
[1:26:35] stronger stronger in the word of God oh
[1:26:38] the longer it takes the more positive we
[1:26:41] are oh Hallelujah because the greater
[1:26:44] the battle is the greater the victory oh

[1:32:14] forgive your transgressions or your
[1:32:17] sin uh if he forsake the Lord and serve
[1:32:20] strange Gods then he will turn and do

[1:35:28] you're living in is a evil time oh
[1:35:31] Hallelujah but at this time in the

[1:35:44] you could arise this morning oh and put
[1:35:46] on the armor of light and walk in
[1:35:50] soberness and walk with a right mind

[1:35:54] lifted up and with your heart
[1:35:56] surrendered with a praise upon your lips
[1:35:59] if you could walk in a way that is
[1:36:02] righteous according to his his his
[1:36:05] statutes he will bless you this morning
[1:36:08] and he will keep you in all your
[1:36:11] ways unless you dash your foot against a
[1:36:14] stone amen and amen so God told the
[1:36:17] children of Israel when you possess
[1:36:19] Jericho take nothing with you destroy
[1:36:23] everything thing isn't that right but we
[1:36:25] know Aon kept a strange garment hidden
[1:36:29] among his stuff and his actions cost
[1:36:32] them 30 and six men when they went up to
[1:36:35] possess the land of
[1:36:37] I and of course we know the story I
[1:36:39] wouldn't read it but an investigation
[1:36:40] was
[1:36:41] done they had to find out what's going
[1:36:44] on they didn't know what would happened
[1:36:47] but Aon kept a little secret said surely
[1:36:51] they it wouldn't it wouldn't bother them
[1:36:52] it's a small thing thing it's a nice
[1:36:55] tunic it looks good this is a rare
[1:36:59] silk I mean why destroy it but God
[1:37:04] already gave an
[1:37:05] instruction what to do when you get into
[1:37:08] Jericho he told them ahead of time
[1:37:11] because he didn't want anything among
[1:37:13] them God wanted to be their provider
[1:37:16] Hallelujah he promis to bring them into
[1:37:18] a large place a land with milk and honey
[1:37:20] he wanted them to plant their own land
[1:37:22] and to achieve don't be taking anybody
[1:37:24] else's stuff this those things are evil
[1:37:27] they are not of mine yet he found it fit
[1:37:30] to do that in some way see he transgress
[1:37:33] God and uh uh uh uh uh and once and
[1:37:37] strange things started to happen when he
[1:37:40] took that
[1:37:41] garment it went into up to eye and they
[1:37:43] got smoked men died the Bible says that
[1:37:47] Joshua and went into mourning right
[1:37:50] after because what they were seeing was
[1:37:53] not what God had said God said no man
[1:37:57] shall be able to stand before thee all
[1:37:59] the days of your life but here was men
[1:38:03] dying in battle this is totally uh
[1:38:07] different uh from what we
[1:38:10] expected we expected Victory we expected
[1:38:14] Victory going into this thing is the
[1:38:17] Lord not with us and then God started to
[1:38:20] deal with them and they begin to search
[1:38:22] the camp
[1:38:24] triy by try family by Family Man by man
[1:38:29] to see who was the
[1:38:31] transgressor of course we know that they
[1:38:33] had Came Upon Aon who hid his stuff in
[1:38:36] the tent well they dealt with that
[1:38:39] situation and they burnt him and his
[1:38:41] family they got rid of the problem by
[1:38:43] fire isn't that right they called it the
[1:38:46] valley of acor they Mark the territory
[1:38:49] don't even go near that Valley pray God
[1:38:51] because that is transgression to the the
[1:38:53] Lord amen so in this time and season
[1:38:56] that we are about to approach cuz God is
[1:38:59] getting ready to turn the tide now we're
[1:39:01] going to go into spiritual things they
[1:39:04] are not strange things these things are
[1:39:07] according to the things that pattern in
[1:39:08] heaven God's going to pour out his
[1:39:10] Spirit upon you he's going to anoint
[1:39:13] he's going to make his ministers a flame
[1:39:15] of fire discernment is going to drop
[1:39:18] down God is going to speak once more
[1:39:20] like he spoke excuse back there in the
[1:39:24] book of Acts when holy men spake as they
[1:39:27] were moved by the holy ghost that time
[1:39:29] is coming again and I feel this morning
[1:39:33] that God is warning us against strange
[1:39:35] things do not bring a Strange Fire unto
[1:39:39] the Lord this morning but make sure your
[1:39:41] sacrifice is right that your heart is
[1:39:44] right that your approach is Right amen
[1:39:48] amen of course they got rid of Aon his
[1:39:50] family and all that buried them on the
[1:39:52] stones and now God begin to deal with
[1:39:54] them and God said take a portion of men
[1:39:57] God start to give instructions now
[1:39:59] because his his wrath was no longer
[1:40:01] kindled against them God is now happy to
[1:40:04] give instructions he said take a portion
[1:40:06] of men and go up to ey he said and when
[1:40:08] they come run back play like you're
[1:40:10] running but keep a portion of men to the
[1:40:13] west and let them lie in weight and when
[1:40:16] they empty the city with confidence to
[1:40:18] beat you let the men of the West run
[1:40:21] into the City and smoke the city oh
[1:40:25] Hallelujah and they did as the Lord
[1:40:27] commanded and when the men saw that the
[1:40:29] city was smoked they tried to run back
[1:40:31] but it was too late Joshua and his men
[1:40:34] smoke the people of ey oh Hallelujah and
[1:40:38] surrender their King it his hands God
[1:40:40] will give you Victory when you get rid
[1:40:44] of all the things that are clogging up
[1:40:47] your prayer life your Christian Life
[1:40:50] when you are get ready to get next to
[1:40:52] God and as the prophet said set your
[1:40:56] face towards heaven put your hands
[1:40:58] toward Heaven oh let your pants legs be
[1:41:01] bagged at the knees oh Hallelujah when
[1:41:05] you're ready to do that then God will
[1:41:07] meet you and take you over to the side
[1:41:11] somewhere and adopt you and give you a
[1:41:14] gift and let the whole world know he is
[1:41:18] with you I'll never leave you I'll never
[1:41:22] for forsake you I promise to be with you
[1:41:26] in your trial with you in your test he
[1:41:30] is with you in your storm the Bible said
[1:41:33] the Lord went everywhere with them
[1:41:36] confirming the word with signs with
[1:41:40] wonders and with Miracles that is what
[1:41:43] God wants to do the end time church
[1:41:45] friends let's get ready for it amen oh
[1:41:50] my so when God does something it's not a
[1:41:52] strange
[1:41:54] thing God himself is not strange he is
[1:41:58] righteous he is just he is Holy he is
[1:42:03] pure in all his ways holy is his name
[1:42:07] this morning and it might seem strange
[1:42:10] to us because our thoughts and
[1:42:12] perceptions of life and reality are so
[1:42:15] far away from God's thoughts that what
[1:42:18] we have to do this morning is to forsake
[1:42:21] our own way yes sir forsake our own
[1:42:24] thoughts in order to even understand
[1:42:26] God's ways he said the let the right uh
[1:42:30] let the Wicked Man forsake his thoughts
[1:42:32] amen amen let them seek the Lord isn't
[1:42:34] that right while he may be found and
[1:42:36] call upon him while he is near amen when
[1:42:41] we are void of understanding the only
[1:42:43] thing we have left is Faith to trust
[1:42:47] that whatever God puts us through this
[1:42:50] morning is for our good isn't that
[1:42:55] right amen so think it not strange don't
[1:42:59] think of it this morning as a strange
[1:43:03] thing as the scripture we read in 1
[1:43:05] Peter 4 beloved think it not strange
[1:43:06] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[1:43:10] try you yes sir oh so the fiery trial
[1:43:14] actually has an objective what is the
[1:43:17] objective of the fiery trial it is to
[1:43:20] try you Amen to prove that that you are
[1:43:23] really who you say you are to prove that
[1:43:27] you are not like Eve but brandham said
[1:43:29] this bride will not be like Eve she will
[1:43:33] not be deceived well in order to prove
[1:43:35] that you have to be tried you have to be
[1:43:39] tested you have to be proven and you
[1:43:42] have to be able to take that word oh
[1:43:45] hallelujah hallelujah and die to your
[1:43:48] senses die to your unbelief die to your
[1:43:52] way of doing things and receive God's
[1:43:55] word concerning your life but as much as
[1:43:59] you are partakers of Christ sufferings
[1:44:00] that when his glory shall be revealed ye
[1:44:04] may be glad also with exceeding joy in
[1:44:08] other words you are happy when God is
[1:44:10] happy and you mourn when God Mourns
[1:44:14] because you are like him in his image
[1:44:16] and likeness amen and you share the same
[1:44:19] values you share the same beliefs the
[1:44:23] Bible said how can two walk together
[1:44:26] unless they agree your spirit have to
[1:44:29] come into a condition this morning where
[1:44:31] you can agree with the things that God
[1:44:33] agree with then when he calls something
[1:44:36] strange you call it strange too and when
[1:44:40] you say something is wonderful he says
[1:44:42] something is wonderful too because you
[1:44:44] share the same ideas after a while you
[1:44:47] begin to think the thoughts of God this
[1:44:50] is how in sync God wants you and him him
[1:44:53] to become this
[1:44:55] morning to walk in his statues and to
[1:44:58] live in his presence amen so think it
[1:45:01] not strange that God hath called you
[1:45:04] this morning that he has chosen you and
[1:45:07] ordained you think it not strange that
[1:45:10] you are here this morning that God
[1:45:13] brought you out of all that you've been
[1:45:15] through every trial every test that he
[1:45:19] brought you think it not strange this
[1:45:21] morning think it not strange that he
[1:45:23] woke you up think it not strange that
[1:45:25] Millions were lost when you were saved
[1:45:28] think it not strange that you were born
[1:45:31] in the family that you were born into
[1:45:33] that was for a purpose that was for a a
[1:45:36] whole thing that God wanted to unfold
[1:45:39] that only when you look back you begin
[1:45:42] to see that it was the hand of God in
[1:45:44] your life it wasn't a strange thing that
[1:45:47] he put you in the job he put you in it's
[1:45:49] not a strange thing that you're going
[1:45:51] through what you're going through now he
[1:45:54] had ordained it he had already thought
[1:45:56] of it in his mind but he also put
[1:45:59] overcoming power in you this morning to
[1:46:02] face the
[1:46:03] test think it not strange this
[1:46:06] morning concerning the
[1:46:09] trial so here's our synopsis this
[1:46:12] morning what is strange to man isn't
[1:46:15] strange to
[1:46:17] God but what is strange to God man
[1:46:20] usually tried to make himself acquainted
[1:46:22] with
[1:46:24] see so I'll say that again just for
[1:46:26] clarity what is strange to man isn't
[1:46:29] strange to God but what is strange to to
[1:46:32] to God Yan usually makes himself
[1:46:34] acquainted with and so there's a
[1:46:36] misalignment of values and beliefs and
[1:46:39] uh and uh and uh we usually
[1:46:41] misappropriate strange things as a
[1:46:43] result misappropriate the
[1:46:45] supernatural we misappropriate the move
[1:46:47] of God in our lives because we don't
[1:46:50] know how to interpret it we're trying to
[1:46:52] interpret it through the lens of our own
[1:46:54] mind and our own understanding not
[1:46:57] realizing that it is God's work per
[1:47:00] Adventure in our lives amen isn't that
[1:47:04] right so that we end up calling the
[1:47:05] things of God strange and what God calls
[1:47:08] strange we are often too willing to
[1:47:12] accept amen isn't that right praise God
[1:47:15] okay so I read this already so amen all
[1:47:19] right so let the wicked forsake his way
[1:47:21] this morning and the unrighteous man his
[1:47:23] thoughts Isaiah 55 and let him return
[1:47:25] unto the Lord and He will have mercy
[1:47:28] upon him oh Hallelujah God will have
[1:47:31] mercy upon us when we turn towards him
[1:47:34] oh will you turn towards him this
[1:47:36] morning and to our God he will
[1:47:38] abundantly pardon for my thoughts are
[1:47:41] not your thoughts neither are my ways
[1:47:44] are your ways my ways say the Lord for
[1:47:46] as the heavens are high higher than the
[1:47:48] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:47:51] ways and my thoughts thoughts than your
[1:47:54] thoughts isn't that right and it might
[1:47:57] have seemed strange when God told
[1:47:59] Abraham that he was going to bring for a
[1:48:01] child in his old age that seemed like a
[1:48:04] strange thing Sarah being Barren also
[1:48:07] and was told that you were going to
[1:48:09] bring forth a son this was the word of
[1:48:12] the Lord for that day Abraham you are
[1:48:15] going to have a son no matter how old
[1:48:18] you are no matter how sickly you are no
[1:48:21] matter what the doctor said say it's not
[1:48:24] a strange thing but this is my word to
[1:48:26] you this morning that even in the midst
[1:48:29] of your situation you are going to have
[1:48:31] a son praise God Amen and what is
[1:48:34] strange to man isn't strange to God
[1:48:37] hallelujah but God needed an impossible
[1:48:40] situation to prove that nothing is too
[1:48:43] hard for God Isn't that right he said
[1:48:48] why therefore did Sarah laugh is
[1:48:51] anything this morning
[1:48:53] too hard for the Lord but at the
[1:48:55] appointed time I will return unto you
[1:48:59] and Sarah thy wife shall bring forth a
[1:49:03] son isn't that right might have seem a
[1:49:06] strange thing that after Isaac was born
[1:49:10] God told this same Abraham to offer up
[1:49:13] thy son upon an altar isn't that right
[1:49:16] that seemed like a strange command to us
[1:49:19] but to God all things are possible God
[1:49:22] God knew what he was doing God knew he
[1:49:25] wanted to test his son to see if he
[1:49:27] would really go all the way and obey his
[1:49:31] every command isn't that right where's
[1:49:34] your love Abraham is it for me or is it
[1:49:38] for something else isn't that right what
[1:49:41] a request for God to make to Abraham
[1:49:44] after that he had given Abraham a son
[1:49:47] after 25 years of testing that's right
[1:49:49] isn't that right on his fate he now had
[1:49:52] to offer up the same
[1:49:55] son isn't that right and that seemed
[1:49:57] like a strange thing to us but God knew
[1:50:01] what he was
[1:50:02] doing Abraham's Faith didn't waver and
[1:50:06] we know that because he told a man he
[1:50:08] said I and the lad go up and I and the
[1:50:11] lad will come back down Abraham knew
[1:50:14] that God was a provider and he was going
[1:50:17] to provide for himself oh hallelujah
[1:50:20] hallelujah he was going to make away out
[1:50:24] of nowhere all he had to do was obey oh
[1:50:29] Hallelujah when they went up the
[1:50:30] mountain sometimes you got to go up the
[1:50:32] mountain Hallelujah to get what God has
[1:50:35] for you they start to get the word and
[1:50:37] the fire and Isaac begin to say but
[1:50:40] Daddy I see the word I see the the fire
[1:50:44] but where's the sacrifice where's the
[1:50:46] offering for the sacrifice and he said
[1:50:48] Son don't you worry God will provide for
[1:50:51] himself oh I don't know how it's going
[1:50:53] to happen I'm just doing what God said
[1:50:57] to do and this morning we are just doing
[1:51:00] what God told us to do God told us to go
[1:51:04] up to stay with the word to stay with
[1:51:07] his promises to stay say what the tape
[1:51:11] say and to believe every word that was
[1:51:14] preached by Malachi 4 oh had to stay
[1:51:17] with that word and despite every trial
[1:51:20] despite every test where hold it on to
[1:51:24] faith to know that God will make a way
[1:51:28] where there seem to be no way he works
[1:51:31] in ways we cannot see it might seem to
[1:51:35] be a strange thing uh but God knows what
[1:51:38] he is doing this morning think it not
[1:51:42] strange oh Hallelujah think it not
[1:51:45] strange oh H when things happen you
[1:51:47] don't expect God is only testing your
[1:51:50] faith to see if you really believe this
[1:51:53] message or if you're going to turn back
[1:51:56] many walked away many have turned their
[1:51:58] backs but God put a faith in your soul
[1:52:01] this morning that's the only reason you
[1:52:04] made it this far he opened every door he
[1:52:09] cleared every river for you to be here
[1:52:11] this morning and you are here to
[1:52:13] acknowledge your God this morning to
[1:52:16] acknowledge the one who brought you
[1:52:19] through oh Hallelujah
[1:52:23] Hallelujah glory to God Amen oh my give
[1:52:28] him praise
[1:52:29] [Applause]
[1:52:39] amen amen and
[1:52:41] amen my it seems strange but Abraham did
[1:52:45] what God said that's right when he was
[1:52:47] coming down with a knife the angel had
[1:52:49] to call twice just to stop him in his
[1:52:52] trap
[1:52:53] is God saw that he had done enough to
[1:52:57] prove that he was uh willing to do what
[1:53:00] God whatever God said what an obedient
[1:53:03] man what an example that we could take
[1:53:07] from God's servants this morning
[1:53:09] patriarch of Faith
[1:53:11] Abraham uh and what he was willing to do
[1:53:14] amen because he had loved God so much
[1:53:17] isn't that right might have been a
[1:53:19] strange thing when God told Noah to
[1:53:20] build an ark because rain was coming
[1:53:24] that's a strange message we accustom
[1:53:26] with rain now that's right but back then
[1:53:29] rain had never fallen before we have to
[1:53:32] remind ourselves that the message that
[1:53:35] God gave Noah was a strange message to
[1:53:39] the people at that time because they had
[1:53:41] never seen it before and God set it up
[1:53:44] that way so that if anyone were to
[1:53:47] believe Noah's message they had to
[1:53:49] believe for something they had not seen
[1:53:52] but but even Jesus said blessed are they
[1:53:55] that have not seen and yet they still
[1:53:57] believe oh Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:54:01] we walk by faith and not by sight oh it
[1:54:04] takes Faith to believe God's word
[1:54:07] because the world will never give you
[1:54:08] enough evidence to prove that that thing
[1:54:10] is real you have to dig deep inside and
[1:54:14] find the faith that God give you to
[1:54:16] believe what he has revealed in his word
[1:54:19] because the revelation of God's word is
[1:54:22] what gives you Faith to stand the test
[1:54:25] God revealed to Abraham he was going to
[1:54:28] have a son and he stood on a revelation
[1:54:30] of that faith and God counted that faith
[1:54:34] for righteousness amen amen hallelujah
[1:54:37] isn't that right he made it in because
[1:54:40] of the righteousness of his faith that
[1:54:42] he had in God and the same thing with
[1:54:44] Noah a strange message to preach his
[1:54:47] message was not in keeping with the
[1:54:49] science of that
[1:54:51] day with the technology of that day
[1:54:53] there was no evidence to prove Noah's
[1:54:56] message yet it was what God gave him to
[1:55:00] preach and every Sunday morning he
[1:55:02] preached the same message like a broken
[1:55:05] record every single day he flip it he
[1:55:09] boil it he fry it he cut it up in pieces
[1:55:13] he steam it it was the same message same
[1:55:17] inspiration same title same subject it
[1:55:21] will rain
[1:55:23] oh and he stood with that message for
[1:55:25] 120 years oh and it's been 50 plus years
[1:55:30] since the prophet came with a message
[1:55:33] and we are staying with that message
[1:55:36] seven tunders give fate seven tunders
[1:55:39] gather the bride together seven tunders
[1:55:42] give the bride fate for Rapture and
[1:55:45] Grace to take us out of here the only
[1:55:48] hope we have left is those Seven Locks
[1:55:51] CL on Samson's head and the only hope
[1:55:54] for the church today is for her to find
[1:55:57] the coin which she has
[1:56:00] lost to restore the
[1:56:03] Covenant to add to your faith seven
[1:56:06] things oh to build yourself up in the

[1:57:56] also amen and
[1:58:01] amen man how am I going for time here
[1:58:05] okay so a few more few more minutes left
[1:58:08] all right you're going we're going fine
[1:58:10] this morning amen yeah are you happy
[1:58:12] this morning amen my so you see so God
[1:58:16] told him to obey no preach that message
[1:58:19] and he lived it also by building an ark
[1:58:23] he didn't just talk about it this is the
[1:58:25] part we want to get to now where we go
[1:58:28] beyond the talk it's easy to say what
[1:58:31] somebody else said or to speak back
[1:58:32] something but to show you really got the
[1:58:35] Revelation is when your actions are in
[1:58:38] alignment with the things that you you
[1:58:40] profess to be true and Noah just only uh
[1:58:44] preach the message that God gave him but
[1:58:46] he lived it by building that Ark that
[1:58:49] God said to build he put it together he
[1:58:52] put it on dry
[1:58:53] land think think about this now this he
[1:58:56] literally built his ark in
[1:58:58] central he didn't go on maracus Bay and
[1:59:01] built the
[1:59:02] ark you know some stories might have it
[1:59:05] the ark built and you see the water next
[1:59:06] to it and but reality it was in the
[1:59:09] middle of like I don't know a plane
[1:59:11] somewhere I don't know how it looked
[1:59:13] exactly but it wasn't near to any Bay
[1:59:15] Area that you could say Okay Noah I get
[1:59:18] the I see the plan when you finish build
[1:59:21] the ark we'll get some wheels or
[1:59:23] something and push this thing down into
[1:59:24] the water I mean that makes sense that
[1:59:28] that's a way that that see it right on T
[1:59:30] man she build a boat near to the water
[1:59:34] but he built this Ark on dry
[1:59:38] ground no you had to drive through the
[1:59:40] desert to get to Noah to get to church
[1:59:44] if he was going to sit in his
[1:59:45] congregation that morning to hear the
[1:59:47] message of the Ark while he preached in
[1:59:50] front of the open door saying come into
[1:59:54] the ark for rain is about to fall he
[1:59:58] preach it like it was present tense he
[2:00:00] preached like it was going to happen
[2:00:01] tomorrow like it was going to happen
[2:00:03] this afternoon like right now so good
[2:00:06] was his faith so strong was his
[2:00:09] conviction that it was going to happen
[2:00:11] yet for 120 years they laughed at him
[2:00:16] Bible says he was a he was the guy of
[2:00:18] the day you know I guess every year they
[2:00:21] would publish a paper and say this is a
[2:00:22] new year and Noah is still building the
[2:00:25] ark and whatever next year come on
[2:00:27] papers New Year happy New Year everybody
[2:00:29] God bless you and Noah is still building
[2:00:32] the ark happy New Year everyone
[2:00:34] wonderful Merry Christmas we season
[2:00:36] greetings Noah is still
[2:00:38] building an
[2:00:41] ark but one
[2:00:43] day The Laughing had to cease because
[2:00:47] God called Noah and his family into the
[2:00:50] ark and then God shut the door shut the
[2:00:53] door and sealed them in after they had
[2:00:57] done all that they were supposed to do
[2:01:00] God was now ready to preach his message
[2:01:04] oh H isn't that right and when the Rain
[2:01:05] Begin to Fall it rained and it rained
[2:01:10] and it rained and it did not stop until
[2:01:13] the whole world was covered in water
[2:01:17] isn't that right amen and they tried to
[2:01:19] get in then but it was was too late what
[2:01:23] God had said had come to passl it always
[2:01:26] does isn't that right so think it not
[2:01:29] strange this morning what God has called
[2:01:32] you to do you might be the only one in
[2:01:35] your family you might be the only one in
[2:01:37] your workplace or the only one in your
[2:01:40] street but God has called you as an
[2:01:43] individual to stand for
[2:01:45] righteousness in this last day when the
[2:01:49] righteous are so scarce to be found the
[2:01:52] Bible says Where shall the ungodly and
[2:01:53] The Sinner appear somebody has to pray
[2:01:56] for them somebody has to go after them
[2:02:00] there is a Ministry for the bride to go
[2:02:03] after the loss in this message to go
[2:02:04] after the loss and bring them in before
[2:02:07] those terrible that terrible time comes
[2:02:10] isn't that right amen when Moses saw the
[2:02:12] burning bush in the distance he was
[2:02:14] puzzled there was something strange
[2:02:16] about this bush that he had not seen
[2:02:19] before and the angel of the Lord
[2:02:20] appeared to him Exodus stre in a flame
[2:02:22] of fire out of the midst of a bush and
[2:02:24] he looked and behold the Bush was burned
[2:02:26] with fire and the Bush was not consumed
[2:02:29] and Moses said I will now turn aside and
[2:02:31] see this great sight why the bush is not
[2:02:34] burned when the Lord saw that he had
[2:02:37] turned aside to see God called out to
[2:02:40] him out of the midst of the Bush and
[2:02:43] said Moses Moses and he said here I am
[2:02:47] here am I isn't that right and he said
[2:02:50] draw not hither no put thy Sho uh put
[2:02:52] but put thy shoes from off thy feet for
[2:02:55] the place where on thou standest is Holy
[2:02:58] Ground oh Hallelujah as we say the fire
[2:03:00] didn't come for the bush it come to
[2:03:02] speak to Moses it come to do something
[2:03:05] for Moses oh Hallelujah sometime he come
[2:03:08] in a strange way but think it not
[2:03:10] strange that he come in a burning bush
[2:03:13] cuz Moses had seen fires before but he
[2:03:16] had never dealt with one like this it
[2:03:18] didn't get bigger it didn't get smaller
[2:03:21] it remained just that way it remained
[2:03:23] constant ever burning it wasn't going
[2:03:26] out this wasn't a natural fire this was
[2:03:30] a supernatural fire and God's fire is
[2:03:33] constant it's ever burning it's always
[2:03:36] there it's a fire by night it's a guide
[2:03:39] for you oh H when all of the lights are
[2:03:42] gone out he is a light for us in a dark
[2:03:46] place it's ever burning it's ever
[2:03:49] constant and if the Holy Ghost ever come
[2:03:52] into your heart if God ever baptize you
[2:03:55] with the fire of the Holy Ghost then
[2:03:57] when he gets into your heart he's ever
[2:04:00] burning he's ever constant he's ever
[2:04:02] Eternal he is with you in your trial the
[2:04:07] anointing will be in your heart to teach
[2:04:10] you how to walk in Jesus name he'll show
[2:04:15] you what to stay away from he'll teach
[2:04:18] you about strange things and he'll set
[2:04:21] your
[2:04:22] heart towards eternally
[2:04:26] eternity
[2:04:28] amen not a strange thing but it is God
[2:04:32] and that's how he does amen hallelujah
[2:04:34] it's his nature his being and how he
[2:04:37] moved his people throughout the ages I
[2:04:39] believe he'll move that way yes but the
[2:04:42] real job of leadership oh is when the
[2:04:44] situation is call for somebody to stand
[2:04:48] for a just cause you have to be able to
[2:04:50] rise up and
[2:04:52] is there not a cause oh who is this
[2:04:55] uncircumcised Philistine who defiled the
[2:04:58] armies of the Living God I will chop his
[2:05:02] head off oh and God is calling up people
[2:05:07] today unlike any other people that the
[2:05:10] world has ever seen think it not strange
[2:05:14] that you are the way you are God loves
[2:05:16] you just as you are because he wants to
[2:05:19] use you this morning to chop the enemy
[2:05:22] to
[2:05:23] Ribbons
[2:05:26] oh
[2:05:27] Hallelujah by faith he used Moses by
[2:05:31] faith he used Joshua by faith he used
[2:05:34] Joel and different ones all throughout
[2:05:37] scripture and by faith this morning he
[2:05:39] has a bride on the earth I know
[2:05:42] Hallelujah she's here this morning oh H
[2:05:46] my little anointed ones God is going to
[2:05:48] raise up
[2:05:50] Messiahs little anointed ones that he
[2:05:53] could use for his honor and His glory oh
[2:05:58] Hallelujah think it not strange this
[2:06:00] morning oh she said call for a fast in
[2:06:03] shushan I and my people will Fast also
[2:06:07] and she said if I perish I perish but I
[2:06:10] go in to see the king oh God knew oh
[2:06:15] Queen Esther would have what inside of
[2:06:18] her he put what he needed inside of her
[2:06:21] to rise to the occasion when it was
[2:06:24] needed the most David Rose to the
[2:06:27] occasion when it was needed the most and
[2:06:29] he slew that Philistine Goliath and God
[2:06:32] is going to put inside your heart what
[2:06:34] is needed the most that when the
[2:06:36] situation presents itself the faith that
[2:06:39] God put in your soul amidst All Odds
[2:06:43] will rise to the occasion oh this
[2:06:46] morning rise to the occasion this
[2:06:49] morning rise up in
[2:06:52] oh Hallelujah and receive your portion
[2:06:56] receive your inheritance receive what
[2:06:59] God has for you this
[2:07:02] morning Hallelujah think it not strange
[2:07:05] when the angel Gabriel appeared unto
[2:07:08] Mary and he told her that she was to
[2:07:11] bring forth the Christ and that his name
[2:07:13] would be called Jesus she asked how
[2:07:17] shall these things be she knew no man
[2:07:20] what a strange message to bring but the
[2:07:23] angel answered her and he said the Holy
[2:07:26] Spirit the Holy Ghost is going to
[2:07:28] overshadow you and bring forth that
[2:07:32] promised
[2:07:33] child and she said be it done unto me
[2:07:37] according to Thy
[2:07:39] word that was not Mary's mind speaking
[2:07:43] that didn't make sense but it was a
[2:07:45] message she reive in her heart and at
[2:07:49] that very moment me to happen within her
[2:07:53] because she had received the word oh
[2:07:56] that the angel brought oh Hallelujah be
[2:07:59] done unto me according to Thy word God
[2:08:02] wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost
[2:08:03] this morning be Aon unto me according to
[2:08:07] Thy word God wants to test you with the
[2:08:10] fiery trial this morning be it done to
[2:08:12] me according to th word when you go out
[2:08:16] of here let the words upon your lips say
[2:08:19] be it done to me Lord according to Thy
[2:08:22] word let me be stripped let me be beaten
[2:08:25] let me be crucified with Christ I don't
[2:08:28] want to be the same no more I want to be
[2:08:31] changed be done unto me according to
[2:08:35] your word if you have to cut me if you
[2:08:38] have to boo me if you have to break my
[2:08:41] pride then do whatever you have to do
[2:08:44] this morning be it done unto
[2:08:48] me according to Thy Word
[2:08:52] not according to my feelings not
[2:08:55] according to what I like not according
[2:08:57] to what I am accustomed to but according
[2:09:01] to Thy
[2:09:02] word at Thy word
[2:09:05] Lord I will do your
[2:09:07] commandment what a young
[2:09:10] lady what an inspired young lady amen
[2:09:14] amen many young women like that in
[2:09:16] scripture but Mary stands out because of
[2:09:19] her faith to willingly
[2:09:22] accept what God Said hallelujah oh H
[2:09:25] isn't that right when she began to do
[2:09:28] that thank you Lord strange things
[2:09:30] started
[2:09:31] happening there was persecution from her
[2:09:34] family they didn't understand what was
[2:09:36] going on how you could do that did you
[2:09:39] what man did you know she keep giving
[2:09:41] them the testimony God told me that I
[2:09:45] would have a child it didn't make sense
[2:09:47] it was a strange thing to them but Mary
[2:09:50] didn't think it strange
[2:09:51] because she heard from the angel if they
[2:09:54] didn't hear from the angel that is their
[2:09:57] business but she heard from the angel
[2:09:59] and she come to church this morning to
[2:10:02] worship God for what the angel told her
[2:10:05] if you can't praise God this morning and
[2:10:08] maybe you need to hear from the angel
[2:10:10] but for those of you who heard from the
[2:10:13] angel this morning lift up your hands
[2:10:16] for your Redemption Joy n for I saw an
[2:10:20] angel come down from Heaven clothed with
[2:10:23] a cloud rainbow upon his head and he
[2:10:26] cried and seven voices utter their
[2:10:30] voices Oh and those voices caught you
[2:10:33] this morning and we are alive
[2:10:36] today
[2:10:38] oh by the voice of him that cried amid
[2:10:41] the seven golden candlesticks hallelujah
[2:10:45] hallelujah oh glory to
[2:10:48] God oh man
[2:10:51] my God
[2:10:53] hallelujah amen amen hallelujah what a
[2:10:56] strange message it was but she received
[2:10:59] it when she receiv received that word
[2:11:01] Christ begin to form see even the
[2:11:03] government started up with tax laws and
[2:11:05] all these things isn't that the census
[2:11:08] bringing the people back to the place of
[2:11:10] birth and whatever and by that they had
[2:11:13] to come back to Beth
[2:11:15] Bethlehem why because God's word uh had
[2:11:19] to be fulfilled while Christ was being
[2:11:22] formed in Mary yes the persecution set
[2:11:24] in trouble on every hand the prophet
[2:11:27] said watch what happen What take place
[2:11:30] he said the devil actually goes on a
[2:11:32] rampage because he knows that Christ is
[2:11:35] being formed in you oh hallelujah
[2:11:38] hallelujah hallelujah so the devil going
[2:11:41] on a rampage or the fiery trial this
[2:11:43] morning is only evidence that something
[2:11:46] is happening inside of the Bride this
[2:11:49] morning that something is happen
[2:11:51] happening in your heart under your skin
[2:11:54] God has found a place to dwell inside of
[2:11:57] you and it's too late for the devil God
[2:12:00] is going to be formed line upon line
[2:12:03] precept upon precept here a little there
[2:12:07] a little every Sunday every Wednesday
[2:12:11] God will rebuild the church again under
[2:12:14] the power of the Holy Spirit oh he'll
[2:12:18] have another one that he can rest his
[2:12:20] hand upon
[2:12:21] and say Here's my spirit flowing freely
[2:12:25] here's another one over there here's
[2:12:28] another one over there I can place him I
[2:12:31] can place her the placing of the
[2:12:35] church oh God has longed for this
[2:12:39] moment when people could find their
[2:12:42] place find their purpose in God and
[2:12:46] serve in that office amen and amen amen
[2:12:50] how many love the Lord today praise God
[2:12:53] so think it not strange now think it not
[2:12:55] strange that God will call a prophet out
[2:12:58] these last days 20th century Prophet
[2:13:02] William Mariam brandham to bring us an
[2:13:04] end time message just before the great
[2:13:07] and terrible day of the Lord think it
[2:13:09] not strange this morning that he went
[2:13:11] through all that he went through he lost
[2:13:14] his wife he lost his child he lost the
[2:13:17] anointing for about 5 years isn't that
[2:13:19] right God put him through hard trials
[2:13:21] sometimes he pray and a black curtain
[2:13:23] drop down that might seem harsh that
[2:13:25] might seem cruel but God was forming his
[2:13:28] prophet he had to come to obedience
[2:13:30] because the level that he wanted to take
[2:13:32] him to it takes obedience to get there
[2:13:35] oh H you have to be able to follow my
[2:13:37] every command you need to be able to
[2:13:39] walk with me I can't stand Disobedience
[2:13:42] I can't stand strange things oh h no
[2:13:45] strange fires you got to do exactly as I
[2:13:48] have told you follow my instructions and
[2:13:51] I will be with you I will never forsake
[2:13:54] you I will always be with you isn't that
[2:13:56] right oh Hallelujah God put him through
[2:13:59] hard
[2:14:00] trials what was it God training his son
[2:14:04] getting him ready for the ministry that
[2:14:06] he had for him God training this last
[2:14:09] prophet to the age isn't that right of
[2:14:13] laia 1963 seven angels come down from
[2:14:16] eternity isn't that right right form of
[2:14:18] a cloud the world saw it they thought it
[2:14:21] was a strange thing but that was God
[2:14:24] himself seven angels descending from
[2:14:27] Heaven according to Revelation 10 1-7
[2:14:31] isn't that right I saw another Mighty
[2:14:33] Angel clothed with a cloud rainbow upon
[2:14:37] his head his feet as fillers of fire oh
[2:14:40] how he come down from heaven with a book
[2:14:42] oh how give it to his Prophet he's ready
[2:14:45] now he's been trained he's been trained
[2:14:48] on the back side of the desert oh he's
[2:14:50] been tradition trial been through this
[2:14:52] test oh Hallelujah and if God put him
[2:14:55] through all that what do you think about
[2:14:57] us this morning think it not strange
[2:15:00] concerning the fire trial that is upon
[2:15:03] your life it is God in you working his
[2:15:07] way out of your
[2:15:10] situation God promised to make a way in
[2:15:14] your Valley to make your Desert Blossom
[2:15:17] oh you just got to stay with that word
[2:15:22] and don't look to the left don't look to
[2:15:25] the right stay with what he said and God
[2:15:30] hallu will fulfill his word exactly what
[2:15:34] he said isn't that
[2:15:35] right Prophet said that you will call
[2:15:38] okay this is a revelation of Jesus
[2:15:39] Christ listen to this and this is how
[2:15:42] see um okay let me read it you'll recall
[2:15:44] that I mentioned at the beginning of
[2:15:45] this message that the book that we're
[2:15:47] studying is the actual revelation of
[2:15:49] Jesus himself in the church and his work
[2:15:52] in the future ages and then I mentioned
[2:15:55] that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[2:15:58] Revelation or we will fail to get it
[2:16:01] Hallelujah in other words you will think
[2:16:02] that it's a strange thing but it takes
[2:16:05] the holy spirit this morning to give us
[2:16:07] Revelation or we will fail to get it
[2:16:10] Hallelujah and he said bringing these
[2:16:11] two thoughts together you will see that
[2:16:14] it won't just take ordinary study
[2:16:16] Hallelujah and thinking to make this
[2:16:18] book real but it is going to take the
[2:16:22] operation of the Holy Ghost that means
[2:16:25] that this book can't be revealed to
[2:16:27] anyone but a special class of people oh
[2:16:32] that's you here this morning that book
[2:16:34] cannot just be revealed to anyone but a
[2:16:37] special class of people it will take one
[2:16:41] with prophetic Insight it will require
[2:16:45] the ability to hear from God oh are you
[2:16:49] hearing from God this morning
[2:16:51] then God put that ability in you to be
[2:16:54] able to hear his word in a day when
[2:16:57] people don't want it in a day when
[2:16:59] America kicks God out you have the
[2:17:03] ability to hear from God oh he that an
[2:17:07] an ear let him hear what the spirit of
[2:17:12] God sayth unto the churches oh he is
[2:17:15] speaking to you this morning come out of
[2:17:18] her my people think it not
[2:17:21] strange oh
[2:17:24] hallelujah oh my it will require
[2:17:27] Supernatural
[2:17:28] instructions that we have to
[2:17:31] follow in order to follow we got to know
[2:17:33] the instructions God revealed all these
[2:17:35] things to a prophet oh we thank God so
[2:17:38] that now we have Supernatural
[2:17:40] instructions isn't that right and not
[2:17:42] just a student comparing verse with
[2:17:44] verse like in a you know in a studied
[2:17:46] kind of way like that he said he said
[2:17:48] though that is good he said but a
[2:17:50] mystery requires the teaching of the
[2:17:53] spirit or it never becomes clear amen
[2:17:57] isn't that right that's why brother
[2:17:59] always says Revelation ought to make us
[2:18:02] humble because we couldn't reveal it to
[2:18:05] ourselves it was God that reveal it to
[2:18:08] us then when you get a true Revelation
[2:18:11] the hands go up the tears come down your
[2:18:14] cheeks because you know he showed it to
[2:18:17] you and if he didn't open your eyes to
[2:18:19] see you still be walking in darkness but
[2:18:23] we thank God this morning that Upon This
[2:18:26] Rock God promised to build his church
[2:18:29] upon the revelation of Jesus Christ in
[2:18:33] this last day bride how he's going to be
[2:18:36] formed in You by seven spirits seven
[2:18:41] manifestations of one Holy Spirit isn't
[2:18:44] that right oh Hallelujah and he said not
[2:18:46] as a student but a mystery requires
[2:18:48] teaching of the spirit or it never comes
[2:18:50] clear how we need to hear from God and
[2:18:53] lay ourselves open and become yielded to
[2:18:56] the spirit to hear and to know he said
[2:19:00] think it not strange say so so think it
[2:19:03] not strange isn't that right that the
[2:19:04] seven Thunders are the seven voices of
[2:19:07] the seven Church ages seven
[2:19:09] manifestations in one Holy Spirit into
[2:19:11] the church as Faith a live voice virtue
[2:19:14] a live voice knowledge a live voice
[2:19:17] Temperance a live voice patience a live
[2:19:19] voice Godly a live voice brotherly
[2:19:22] kindness a live voice thundering out in
[2:19:25] sweetness and humility and it is these
[2:19:28] divinely reveal mystery truths that
[2:19:31] literally turn our hearts back to the
[2:19:33] fate of the fathers thinking not strange
[2:19:36] oh they couldn't understand it all these
[2:19:38] years but you wait till them seven
[2:19:41] Thunders utter their voices to that
[2:19:43] group who can really take the word of
[2:19:46] God and hand it there it'll slice it'll
[2:19:50] C
[2:19:51] they can close the heavens they can shut
[2:19:54] this they can do that whatever they want
[2:19:56] to Glory the prophet
[2:20:00] said
[2:20:01] Hallelujah he'll be slayed by the
[2:20:04] word that proceeds from his mouth is
[2:20:07] sharper than a two-edged sword Prophet
[2:20:10] said they could call for a 100 billion
[2:20:12] tons of flies if they wanted to amen
[2:20:16] whatever they say is going to happen
[2:20:19] because it's the word of God coming from
[2:20:23] the mouth of God yeah amen that God
[2:20:26] always it's his word but he always uses
[2:20:30] man to work it so you have been called
[2:20:33] this morning men and women to work the
[2:20:36] word oh hallel that he has put in his
[2:20:39] last days amen amen amen you have been
[2:20:42] chosen think it not strange this morning
[2:20:45] that God is speaking to your heart this
[2:20:47] morning you are the man you are the
[2:20:50] woman that God wants to use today and to
[2:20:53] pour His Spirit into you and to build
[2:20:56] you up into this stature of a perfect
[2:20:59] man oh my I'm getting ready to close now
[2:21:02] conclusion so thinking not strange
[2:21:04] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[2:21:06] try you God is not the author of
[2:21:09] confusion Ecclesiastes 3 says to
[2:21:12] everything there's a seasonall and a
[2:21:14] time to every purpose under the heaven a
[2:21:17] fiery trial has a purpose and as we read
[2:21:20] uh in 1 Peter 4 that purpose is to try
[2:21:23] you amen it's to prove you prove that
[2:21:27] you are not like Eve the only way to
[2:21:29] prove that is to try you amen is to test
[2:21:33] you that's right and the only way he can
[2:21:35] give you power is if he tries you he has
[2:21:38] to prove that you are worthy of it
[2:21:40] before he can give it to you and
[2:21:43] according like the prophet said in that
[2:21:44] message he's got to shake your box car
[2:21:47] in order to he can't seal you if it's
[2:21:49] too loose isn't that right if he wants
[2:21:52] to seal you with the Holy Ghost this
[2:21:53] morning if it's too loose he can't seal
[2:21:55] it pack it over again it's got to be
[2:21:58] packed right no strange Gods no strange
[2:22:02] fires no strange offerings but exactly
[2:22:05] what he said to put in there according
[2:22:08] to his specifications it's got to be
[2:22:11] built right and when it's packed right
[2:22:14] then the inspector can come by once he
[2:22:16] checks it and he likes what he sees he
[2:22:19] says it is good give them the Holy Ghost
[2:22:22] give them the seal until the day of
[2:22:25] their Redemption oh Hallelujah give them
[2:22:28] that Holy seal and that's what we come
[2:22:30] for this morning we want to be packed
[2:22:32] just right may God put into us all of
[2:22:35] the value that us be packed just right
[2:22:39] fit for
[2:22:40] sealing but rejoice in as much as ye are
[2:22:42] partakers of Christ sufferings we go
[2:22:45] through sufferings to pack us just right
[2:22:48] so that when his glory shall be revealed
[2:22:50] ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy
[2:22:54] Psalms 118 says the Lord is my strength
[2:22:56] and my song and is become my salvation
[2:23:00] the voice of rejoicing and salvation is
[2:23:03] in the Tabernacles of the righteous oh
[2:23:05] Hal the right hand of the Lord doeth
[2:23:07] valiantly the right hand of the Lord is
[2:23:10] exalted musicians get ready to come the
[2:23:12] right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly I
[2:23:15] shall not die but live and declare the
[2:23:19] works of the Lord
[2:23:21] for the Lord had chasen me sore but he
[2:23:24] had not given me over unto death open to
[2:23:27] me the Gate of righteousness and I will
[2:23:30] go into them and I will praise the Lord
[2:23:35] this gate of the Lord into which the
[2:23:37] righteous shall enter and I will praise
[2:23:40] thee for thou Hast heard me are you here
[2:23:43] to praise him this morning I will praise
[2:23:46] thee and thou become my salvation the
[2:23:49] stone which the builders refuse is
[2:23:52] become The Headstone of the corner this
[2:23:54] is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous
[2:23:57] in our eyes this is the day which the
[2:23:59] Lord has made and we will rejoice and be
[2:24:02] glad in it amen and amen praise the name
[2:24:06] Lord do you love him
[2:24:08] today oh
[2:24:10] my Hallelujah one more quote and then
[2:24:13] finish uh this is the prophet's message
[2:24:16] and I see that shall possess the gates
[2:24:18] of the enemy 1962 he said that of it is
[2:24:21] like I was saying last night the
[2:24:22] Pentecostals are waiting for a rushing
[2:24:25] Mighty Wind but they fail to hear that
[2:24:29] still Small Voice see that is it's so
[2:24:33] wrong to do those things they think so
[2:24:36] as long as the wind is rushing it's all
[2:24:38] right but that didn't attract the
[2:24:40] prophet's attention the rushing wind
[2:24:43] never bothered the Prophet Elijah in the
[2:24:45] cave Mighty Thunders and Lightnings
[2:24:47] pouring down never attracted him but
[2:24:50] what startled him was that still Small
[2:24:52] Voice that something speaking with
[2:24:55] inside my word is truth let every man's
[2:24:59] word be a lie and mine be true that's
[2:25:03] what attracted the prophet see you could
[2:25:05] you could begin to play something softly
[2:25:07] if you would and it still do it it'll
[2:25:10] still do it the word of God always
[2:25:13] attracts the spiritual mind because it
[2:25:16] is the mind of Christ in you that knows
[2:25:19] that the word is true true oh we know
[2:25:21] the word is true this
[2:25:24] morning he said in paragraph 87 he said
[2:25:27] and you go through a testing time the
[2:25:30] church goes through a testing time each
[2:25:33] individual goes through a testing time
[2:25:36] before it can ever possess the Gate of
[2:25:39] the enemy Abraham went through it Christ
[2:25:42] went through it after Christ was filled
[2:25:45] with the Holy Spirit there at the River
[2:25:46] Jordan he went through a testing time
[2:25:49] amen after Abraham was called out put
[2:25:52] into his hand where he was to be a
[2:25:54] pilgrim then give circumcision then God
[2:25:56] met him and time after time yet he had
[2:26:00] to go through the time of testing you
[2:26:03] can begin to stand every Seed of Abraham
[2:26:07] does the same thing Abraham and his seed
[2:26:11] an organization a church that's the
[2:26:12] reason we find ourselves organizations
[2:26:14] Falling by the ways sign is become when
[2:26:16] it because when it comes to the test
[2:26:19] what test he says God's word there's the
[2:26:22] test God's word is the test will you
[2:26:27] stay with his word amen and will we do
[2:26:29] what a bunch of men says do or will we
[2:26:32] do what God says do that's the
[2:26:34] difference he says may God add h a
[2:26:37] blessing to his word let's all stand and
[2:26:39] just worship him I'm finished oh

[2:41:50] days last night I experienced a
[2:41:52] tightening in my throat I prayed about
[2:41:54] it and I took the pill for the condition
[2:41:56] after a while I got a release of the
[2:41:58] pressure the doctor said it could be
[2:42:01] allergies due to the harsh weather
[2:42:02] conditions there's also redness to the
[2:42:04] tonsils and there's still some
[2:42:06] discomfort in my throat thanking you for
