and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he did run the readers it for the vision is yet for an appointed train and at the end it shall speak and not lying do it Terri wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry behold his soul which is lifted up is not a bright in him but the just shall live by his faith Genesis chapter 18 verse 14 is anything too hard for the

therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is a reasonable service IV not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God that is for head so I pray Heavenly Father we we stand in your presence tonight and we slowly penned up on you that you would give the option to speak and the unction to hear bless the hearers of your word Lord interpreted to their hearts may they see the plainness of God that they will know to conduct themselves in the present did I deliver granted father and bring their bodies in the behavior of the world granted God and Jesus my ask it amen i'm gonna be seated or praise the lord blessed be the name of the law [Music] with tonight our title the vision is yet for an appointed time vision is yet fun appointed time I now have an inspiration catch the vision and cope with the word that's the inspiration that I have catch the vision and cope with the word now Jesus he rebuked his own disciples when they didn't have a real positive testimony when he was talking to them after he rose from the dead he actually told them all fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken or not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory so he was telling them I mean you supposed to know this stuff if I told you I'll be offered I told you all these things but he went on and did something to them and he the Bible says that these are the words this is Luke this is from 2444 which I spoken to you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which was written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooves Christ to suffer and to rise from the today on from the dead on the third day and so on and who is 49 his pretend is presented to them so now that he's opened it understand in the description open the word to them he is pretending to them the vision of what they must expect and what they have to look forward to what was the target what was the endgame what was the goal and he said behold I and the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high yellow is a stay there until stay there until this power that I've been loosed by my father because I did a price I paid a price I just come off the cross I am now risen from the dead and know that I have done that nothing could stop the power from being released the power is on its way but be in position to receive it and he Jesus let them us faster Bethany he lifted up his hands and bless them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parting from them so he was leaving now nobody was crying nobody was depressed nobody was frustrated and Jesus was leaving and they worship him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy he's gone what did they have in there Jesus told him if I don't go the comforter will not come and then knew he was leaving something else is coming well get the Lord a shout in the house Oh hallelujah that is when and they were and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing God because now their mind is open up the understanding is open up the world has been Brook to them praise God not to look for some man that interpret more words to them they don't have to look to some bishop somewhere or some man of God from somewhere or a certain man have to come and be this and this certain man didn't have to look for that no more they got spoken word they got Jesus own words they got the breath of God receiving the Holy Ghost they got the breath of God upon their life no man didn't we get this God spoke it and we are promised we have been promised equality Luke 17 thirdly the son of man would be reveal again that's not a son of man that's the son of man so decent a man was veiled in that prophet DS shadow man was veiled in William Branham so the words coming on that prophets mouth wasn't William branham's words what's the words of the Son of Man and the Solomon who came to Abraham he said I will return unto thee according to the time of life appointed this vision of God this prophetic vision that was released by seven seals and seven thunders there's an appointed time for this vision to be fulfilled but this shall be fulfilled and shall come to pass don't swore by himself that ain't going to come to pass ordinary mothers even or glory to God hallelujah my Kojima be seated Oh hallelujah so when God came down in Genesis 18 Genesis 19 to tell them I will return to be a corner time of life two angels went on to Sodom under investigative judgment isn't that right but one angel stays in the backside of the desert with Abraham another angel said the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I about to do so core data print the seals on the backside of the desert to Abraham to reveal to Abraham judgment was next coming to Sodom or glory to God but Abram as the elect have to get the divine revelation and vision as Kings that ought to be or glory to God we believe that and because God brought that upon Abraham Abraham brick in the intercession the brief a lot because luck was a believer accident but a believer formal but a believer lukewarm but a believer it was family Oh glory to cook and you can make revelation 22:17 it has to be a scriptural voice so Abraham was anointed with revelation 22:17 to go after his brother lot Oh glory to God is not right Oh hallelujah praise praises his family love is my right and plead for God if there is 50 if there's 25 in there is 10 and they couldn't find 10 10 with Christ living in them uncaught sentence that city the judgment and that same God Oh sentence the world judgment Oh Sunim condition the name I can be a packet of Sodom condition again and it has to be a manifestation of the revealing of the son of man again but this time in a body bride that is what you're called to do to give one final witness and they're gonna be a voice going on the spirit and the bride say come they don't even know what they would wit but the world is gonna head for Oakland could see a woman going to the bank Sodom and Gomorrah you're gonna call like a pay but they didn't know next one and fire was coming I could see somebody kindly children amen to the babysitter but they wasn't seeing I was coming on the backside of the desert seals be an open mysteries being revealed vision being made clear and they don't see the seals of judgment is about to be poured out with the wrath of God or glory that God and people have sat so long enough in this message it becomes ordinary it become normal like if nothing is taking place like if the Lord Allah is coming and they fighting one another and accusing one another one another but the vision is for an appointed time the vision is correct the vision is tough saith the Lord we have not been gathering them in vain seven thunders God is the bride together not the missile Association seven thunders seven thunders whatever it's going to Gaza the bride together a prophet spoke it that's an exclusive bride promise that's why I hear tonight no devil in hell could stop the brand from these promises because the devil himself don't have a clue of what's under that seventh seal [Applause] ordained so under there Oh hallelujah praise God this is hidden from the devil this is hidden from the wise and the prudent this is revealing unto babes such as we learn ocarina God you may be seated what get caught seen in Habakkuk right division and make a clean not complicated clean not difficult please not to scratching your hair trying to figure what the man of God is trying to say we not trying to say anything [Applause] the lion that broad the Lord God had spoken we're not trying to say anything we have a message and it stops here the Lord we have the King's message for Tory not God undo your abyss hidden [Applause] no no hair tight no Jackie sighs no amirite no Philistine going to stop the bride from possessing for redemptive rights knock when the lamb took the book not when the lamb gave the prophet the book not when they mighty angel came down with the book and the redemptive rights of being revealed no no no no no Oh glory of God Michel Fortin the dragon fought this battle we and you may be seated didn't start on earth it started in heaven so if you take you war in a new war and it started way back in heaven there was no whiskey up there nobody was more smoking marijuana nobody was going point no no no no no no no no no no no no was just yes that's the ambition of of Lucifer wanting the kind of worship that beginning our God this morning because a father seeketh such to worship Him and Lucifer got jealous and wanted to worship and we were represented by those angels and we say who you not you you not get in this version Oh glory to God and the first over true and COO was in heaven hallelujah trying to make a coup that record off is true and instead a train going off God kick him off and fell to the earth and the Battle of Angels became the battle of men that's why we are here tonight to give you a sword in your hand to give your shoes on your feet to give you a shield to give you a breastplate well Chloe look god this is not a game so not again I'm not here to entertain you may be seated praise God Hebrews chapter 4 says let us therefore fear Lisa promise left us of entering into his rest any of you should come short of it so the promise is to enter into his rest Oh glory to God hallelujah because the word was preached so all of them but it wasn't mixed with fate so quarter to bring the fate to mix with the wood I promise when I saw we couldn't even go forward on typical backwards let me say that again we couldn't go forward until we pick up the faith that was once delivered to the Saints so courts and a prophet to go back and pick it up bring it here that we could deal with them Devil's trying to cut us off from the resurrection did you get that it takes perfection to bring on the resurrection this vision is a vision of perfection not Church anybody can go to church anybody to join church this is perfection this is seven voices this is seven loving spirits this is the rainbow living in you hunger in you this is what this is about [Applause] I don't want nothing less than that maybe season forgive me forgive me tonight I get him excited oh my god did promise me a stipend you put me cmp keep the stipend until I get the same pay you give me something to hold a small measure to work with but the same thing mean just what Peter had just what Paul had just what the early church we have to have it back nothing less than that which man on earth right now to say like we don't silver and gold have I none such as I did wish man we want that we have to get back [Applause] when Peter met that man in the gate called beautiful maybe see said he stole hold on come back with a spoken book for you bullet hole or not began a team I hope we live again give me address in the email address are coming by you tonight the player team was no plane I take the mantle idiot a be a stripper he needs to walk you're blind you need to save your balance you need to be loosed you're dumb you need to speak [Applause] you need to pay taxes you need to catch a fish the gospel being preached and ministering to the needs of the people present tense [Applause] [Music] [Applause] gee you may be seated Jesus had per minion over fish cook fishy Jesus have dominion over cook bread he could multiply it you say this is one I can make a - I can make pewter before I can make four become it I could multiply whatever you put in my hands I don't have to accept this is one bread this is poo fishes this is how you have to accept that I could make it what I want to make it I can make a revival right here in noodle right now [Applause] that's the gospel let me see that's a custom ABC said some brothers brought a crippled friend on a pilot to half we policy or whatever came to the surface and couldn't get going in it's packed out nobody got our shame there's no Deacon there's nothing coming and those bars refused to go back home like that they said we come too far there was no bus there was no taxi there was no car they walk with that guy that was their friend they walk with him because it's Jesus isn't own and if Jesus is all wrong something has to happen Jesus either turning water into wine multiplying bread wherever gin something has to be taken place Jesus in a quiet man there is always activity around Jesus some pasta to be forgiven somebody been healed some died now opening some never being cast Oh once Jesus is around what those guys did it t up the roof unelect on the man in front of Jesus you think they're wasting time you think the idol you think you do have fit they have two feet to climb the roof that's our faith the pulling the guy who owned the stretcher have to fit that these guys have fit it must have been painful to go up the wrong side of that building but when he left in front of Jesus he was letting down and coming up in the atmosphere I pushed it was all around Jesus so he was coming down in the atmosphere my god and jesus said which is easier to say we could be better walk but I still be forgiving me he said which one God which one I could do both I can forgive you of your sins and free you from your crippled condition oh you wanna go free tonight who the son of man set free every need or you can go free tonight [Applause] [Music] maybe season so when God given the promise of the Promised Land known in Egypt the Prophet said God came down to make this promise of reality so it's good to see we have a promise but the promise has to become reality Maryna good these guys were so inspired go told Abraham hundred year before that he was gonna do it Jules has said don't move my balls on me until you go to the promised land and bury me with the rest of my father's cause he know the resurrection was coming or glory to God each one of them prophets know what the other prophets said so they were consulting the prophetic utterance or glow in the core of those men of God that went before them to see what the prophecy see because all of them knew it was men that was moved by the spirit so they were not speaking from the intellectual level they were speaking from the intelligence of God that tongue into the heart to give them to see at the Lord Abram said bury me right here with you was buried said sirrah I'm gonna buy pieces wrong we're gonna be buried right here I stuck with a prophet after his daddy said listen to you bury me here don't eat you take me right to the promised land Oh glory to God so that's how they were you may be seated well until they've died years later he said oh you big blueberry me here take my bones with you because God will surely visit you so they were in the spirit they know a resurrection has promised they were looking for it so much that because they don't economy in Egypt because I have 19 apostle is appalled nineteen is only coming in a promised land if you stay in Egypt you can't get this anointed you got what I'm saying Laurie listen one time one time they were burying a man under hood some enemy coming and if that man in the grave of Elijah and when they just joined them that's run when that body hit Elijah bones [Applause] Misun the bible in cinema with a christian there was an ordinary man but when that dead man hit quitman power and bring the dead back to life I'll give the cripton power only laser bones could bring a dead man to life what about Elijah Coates William Branham died since 1965 and we arrested we are resting on this coach on these words because the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say would already be said in the world [Applause] LeBron said it's got to be a promise to enter into the rest what to fear that we don't have a promise but we have a promise the promise is the antenna is rest you may be seated [Applause] so you're even a battle tonight to fight to get into his rest because his rest is the promise what about him said this here he said watch notice let us therefore fear lisa promise being left us the end in distress so I want you to remember that unless we find out unless God reveal it to us here we go no matter how much you go to church that has nothing to do with it God must come by revelation and reveal himself to us and that takes all the teens of the world out that's not good I'm not hearing of amens on that that's not like 60% something like a 1 I heard a read it again maybe younger idea God must come by revelation and reveal himself to us and that takes all the world polity that will out because once is being being made plain to you you could run if you read it don't walk your run with it because I run with a message it is clear can you see not only coming for your soul or your spirit you come in for your very body itself you want to be completely redeemed Oh hallelujah praise God in an but a Branham now remember now remember you may be seated they were on their road to rest the pillar of fire let them and we want to find out what is this rest watch so first you have to end into the stress but it shouldn't come short of it so when you know you have a promise don't come short of it you want to be faithful to the promise of God you want to see it manifested in your life not in the church but in your life and then you can come to church with it in your life you understand - revival in your home you can't start something in the church what you don't have in your home you have to get it on the inside inside that way just when you're praying go in the secret closet and pray dr. heavenly father who sees in secret when we want you openly or gives a lot of shout praise God that the professor Nome is at the big revival the revival of the comforter people you have to [Applause] you have to remember you have to bring it look after it right now right now by your worship by your shows by the Airman's by your hallelujah you are creating the atmosphere right now [Applause] maybe season here is the promise here is what we got to feel if there's not a promise left us but the Prophet said but there is a promise and the next thing don't come short of it now the thought is if we are on our way to the rest what is the rest where is it it is join in church it'll being baptized decision we is it becoming remember the greatest church in the city we're in better clothes it is education is it money so we can quit work and just lay down rest the rest of our lives that's not it listening to what the Bible says it is let us therefore fear Lisa promise left us that enter into his rest that you should come short of it for unto us the gospel was preached as well under them what is the gospel the good news the good news came to them in Egypt that quarter-cent the deliverer he's going to bring us out and take us to the promised land the good news for us now is that God sent a deliverer the Holy Ghost and we are on the road to the promised land and the people has made Cui's and denomination but God still remains that our rest is the Holy Ghost so this rest is the Holy Ghost we are pressing towards the Holy Ghost that's our promised land is the land of the Holy Ghost in that land of power in that line of deliverance in that land of freedom in that land of miracles in that land of anointing and that granule contact with the supernatural in that land of angels descend an angel walking back and forth that's in that oh it's a good man oh he is here tonight Oh blowing up cotton in Alleluia somewhere around says here the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with fate and then I heard it so after was it have to go beyond your Shelton priests you have to be praising God on a planet to your own heart he said no no matter how much the word is preached how well you like the way it's being preached unless you yourself are partaker of that it won't do you one bit of good so you gotta say this is mines man I'm taking it tonight my taking it back home to my wife or glory to God husband love your wife that's the word or glory they're going you have to express it you have to show it you have to live it take it back all hallelujah praise be to Jesus or glory no God in it hallelujah you may be seated so Genesis 1 goes to let every seat before and after its kind and God could only speak that because quad notice it have the power to transform itself into whatever the seat is isn't that right and but a man was talking about transformed to be made different to what has been its character and everything has to be changed and that's the word to be transformed isn't that right and God saw chaos and darkness and God saw the condition but that didn't intimidate God darkness and chaos and confusion didn't intimidate God all that has to happen is the spirit half the moon I wants the spirit moves it has to have a voice because God have to use the voice of his word or glory no God is not just a spirit move the screen of the connect with the voice the voice have to speak and the word becomes that season to produce the miracle Oh glory to God so God transform chaos into a garden a Eden isn't that right everything was perfect he commanded each one of those seeds of what there would be that they would transform themselves into the plant of which kind of life that the Word of God spoken in them should be it was an oak tree it was the bridge were an oak it was a path what a perm because the Creator just sent this word and everything under his control now when he put the seed in the earth this seed can only come forth with the power of life within it and that is why God put that seed in you when before the foundation of the world you are not in charge of that seed that's his seed or glory to God let me say it again you are not in charge of that see the predestinated mission who you are he's in charge of that is who he foreknew he called you have to knew you before that's why he called you because he knew the seed where they planted in Nigeria your ceiling whatever village whatever state he had to find you I mean know where you are well glory to God that mother Eagle know where you are he's a seed inside of you oh yes yeah fleshly habits yes you have a human spirit you didn't even know you had acceded when you were smoking and drinking but what was looking after you all the time because you know one day you have to hear that call you have to hear that call or glory that God listen we were getting soon and we heard a call and the people that are dead in the grave they don't hear a call one day - Oh glory to God God Collier the Baptist Church of Methodist Church what corner of the University of the drunkenness of the adultery of the fornication what to call you further and transform you into a son and daughter of the Living God to reproduce and manifest Jesus Christ do you believe it amen each one of those seeds let me go you may be seizing each one of those seeds has the power in itself I love this the transform itself into the species that I desire it to be that is what make me that that's what it must be because I have given every seed let me go transform in power [Applause] to make out of itself in its potentials no to make out of itself exactly what I wanted to be God has never changed I'm just the same as he was then God is he telling to do something nothing is going to stop him and he will do it that's why when God finished with his works he turned his back and rested because you know every secret word of this time so part of this guy so gorgeous rested and let the magic work and bored acting on this drama composer Adam like it good Adam where do we get a word from your position then humans had a takeover but well the woman didn't so he began the past epoch and possible and got Kingdom kill a lamb bring this atonement that's very first income because that was required so God couldn't spare him he said the day you eat thereof that day you die and there was no gambling house there was no drinking homes there was this Adam Eve his wife and a gardener Eden and Mansell hip-hop it had no rock star and Hollywood you know man fell in that environment so man to fall anywhere oh I thought you wasn't born in sin and shipping in the gritty I thought was me alone I thought all of us born in sin and ship iniquity understand this if God don't hold you you fall let's let's talk so don't play more righteous than anyone inside of here if God don't hold you before that's my damn except I look unto the hills from whence cometh my help Maya come from the law [Applause] the decision Alleluia I like Weber Isaac said this morning about the tapestry of David's life from a young man the King to old man to died cool he God make sure this life span from childhood go straight up a whole big circle of life I mean God call him a man after my own heart you may be seated or praise the name of the Lord so then God the power to transform and the devil bring up something to deform and the reform is to take us from its original state make something go wrong with it same seed but messed-up same seed much tied up hallelujah we are prejudiced tied up under before sometimes it industry but the twisting but there is coming a power and it's coming a brain that can have revelation 22:17 and the voice of that is not go the voice of that is not cut off I have not agree with you that's not the voice of it the voice of it the spirit and the bride say come you have your ticket to glory you are both the board the plane you are saying goodbye world what you have time to do to be bitter with anybody or hateful towards anybody you are leaving here your ticket is County your visa is stamped you cannot be deported you came from there [Applause] did you get that you cannot be reported that is wet by your home you're going back home if I was seeking a city whose metal building is but maybe season you should see me in my home there's no gray headed you should see my house you should see the street leading to my house Mike I see the wondering no no I'm not talking about in Trinidad that old house oh my god you should see the real one [Applause] another season do you understand that God's objective was to bring back the original man that was supposed to be standing in the gadna even as if he never did fall that's why God introduced justification not just forgiveness but justification is you never did it we can't even figure that out but God could because only he as far as I know have a sea of forgetfulness everybody remember what you did but when God take your sins [Applause] [Music] and chop it you remember and remember some of the things I've done but Jesus with the special blood forgive me of everyone [Applause] tonight under the blood of Jesus you can justify I've never let on you never did because God said so forgive the Lord a shout maybe season you see you need to get that because that will affect your confidence to approach the throne of grace with fullness you need to get that because I can affect you from going into D to the angel they say give me a little book because if you not sure of your salvation of the redemption and predestination you wouldn't think about going to the angel because you were interpret that you're not worthy but the question wasn't if you're worthy Jesus died for you to have access to the book Satan don't have the password to go into the book access denied no you don't need mustard type in a password this will just put your fingerprint he doesn't have your print no you don't even a print will just show your face Lord Jesus your son and the book opens to you the vision bricks what the Lord is about to do I told him back home you may be seasoned I said they go outside on the street level you seen this street that's true that's true if you fight at that level you would lose you only seen this street I said well if you go in a helicopter you will see beyond the streets you will see the village you go higher you see the city you go higher you see the state you go higher you see Nigeria you go higher the salasi ghana you start a city whole of africa because you're going higher and higher got you see a bigger vision and the vision when you come down to the street now it changes perspective because you see a broader picture you see the enemy coming on the road they will come along the street so you moving on that street or you cut them off here because what take you up into a vision and when you come down from that vision you are invincible because we know the next move and that's what quarters to abraham shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do just think you are here and cause about the biggest seventh on the revival it's about to break nice easy boom you be seated so caught up in that helicopter gives you a bigger vision hallelujah I had vision that's why quad abandon was so caught up his I see that right called I see she's sealed in this game when he what is he talking from he's talking from up dear he see you sealed he said Oh God so close I could feel it my god sons of God going down the streets and praise God silver and gold have I none he said god help me live to see it he said it's so close I could see it missing limbs being restored the prophet prophesy missing limbs that's why I'm excited because he ever loved to look sour to [Applause] oh there's another negative less than negative we could spoon true but we were talking about that we talked about bridle promises and the vision that have to be clear to you because windows guys got the vision from Jesus they were clean and clear about what they were about that's why the Whitney upper room and waited in fear it's not that they were they was Poland no no no they were fearful but they know what they expect him power to take away that fear they were nervous but power control our takeover all of that this power is promised I love it I love it I love it Oh glory to God in the Upper Room was pastor and congregation apostle and communication bishop oncologist and everybody was of me upper room the heart was the hideous room because power is from the Father or do you believe that tonight Oh glory to God hallelujah amen amen amen blow it up God so before before the word could be manifested a seed has to be spoken let there be let there be let there be that's the word seed and then it's manifested is the real seed so gotta to speak you first so you are thought by past you see often in the world God sent a prophet to connect you back with your world so when you get a word preached you connect with it because the world is an expression of you the thought of what you are you are become a world expression so you have to connect with the world or glory to God you can't help it it's part of your makeup it's part of your call it's part of the gene and your soul you can't help it I'm gonna be a perfect man yet I'm gonna be a perfect man because that is my seed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what if I'm talking about ministers could be halfway go to McCaffrey preachers but we just could be hovering reason they get their own week messed up and an interrupted promo but for their lives but core don't make a free preachers he makes full preachers he put something in since the teach preaches the preach isn't that right but the thing about them we can get mixed up and messed up in our own human spirit and affect the program of y'all because God wants to be conductors of the Spirit so we have to become the word isn't that right and once you become the word then you become a conductor that the speakin flow true difference that mashing up and doing that other things and give us hope for come out of the way if I come out of the way tonight who is speaking you said wherever gift the givers hope to come out of the way that the Holy Spirit could operate and speak to that gift where's a teaching give a prophetic if whatever gift it is it's how the cut out of the way I want man move out what moves in you hear from God and you know you hear from God or glory to God so sin John 14:12 is a seed the same works I do shall you do also sin John 15:7 is a seed if you're batting me in my ways I bury you you can ask what you will send Mac 16 is a seed these signs shall follow them that believe not maybe not perhaps these signs shall follow them not you follow signs signs following you wherever you go the signs are right behind you you can't help it because this is the word you can't help it because this is true [Applause] so when God made man he'll be Caesar in his own image after his kind the robber said what is his kind the word so the man that God made was would kindly not interpretation kind with a kind you see man like the follow force installation because man making it easy for and easy for Abraham to believe to go too eager to have a child that they believed all wrinkled up Sarah go have it so that's right Abram could move like that because when God Abraham attrition of exact I see seen the baby but when you look at Sarah he's your Lord now the thing about it quarter Abraham is true Sarah so he gotta force up you have to treat that woman rate or ever she is she I wanna cook that some day she wanted food and it doesn't matter that is still zero it's true that woman he will get that promise so ever had to walk right Oh liberally and make sure Sarah don't even because God didn't talk to Sara poor Sara here only watching the mirror and say good lord but abraham believed God not seeing agree here not seeing a wrinkle not Sarah grumpy and the Bible consider him a hero of it father of it and it's so accurate is it isn't a valid force even struggle but when when the subtle writes his testimonial the Bible said he staggered not at the promise of God she only sang God God sign that that that's already the cat question that testimonial look who signed it static not it's Ricky none and tonight we have not stager we stand on that rock if I perish I perish Gordon [Applause] this vision can change Dorie Perry with fans went that where there it's common [Applause] I am
