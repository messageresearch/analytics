========================================

[Music] Hallelujah [Music] Worthy is the Lamb what we here to do to worship him and to honor him and to lift for him thank you so much praise God so we going to stand we want to read to two three portion of scripture tonight 1 Corinthians chapter 6 we want to read 15 to 20 Acts chapter 7 verse 47 to 50 and Hebrews 10 one verse there verse 5 I want to read from 1 Corinthians chapter 6 reading verse 15 know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of ANH halot God forbid what know you not that he which is joined to an halot is one body for two say he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committed fornication sinth against his own body what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which ye which is in you which ye have of God and you are not of your own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods acts 7 reading verse 47 but Solomon built him an house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as sayth the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me seeth the Lord or what is the place of my rest ha not my hand made all these things on the last scripture reading some Hebrews 10:5 it says wherefore when he cometh into the world he sayith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body has thou prepared me let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we thank you for those gathered here tonight we pray a hand of mercy and Grace be upon them bless them bless those who are connected live that your spirit might have the prominences and among us tonight God we are needy people and just one word from you would make all the difference so may you come down and speak to us I make myself available to you and I pray each one of us would be circumcised Lord to hear the word and to receive the word and circumcise me to speak your word granted God in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you may a seat praise God it's so good to be here tonight is always a great blessing to be in the house of God we will not have all we will not always have this privilege and while we have this privilege let's take advantage of it so I have a title this tonight the Temple of the Holy Ghost your body that's title the Temple of the Holy Ghost your body and have an inspiration glorify God in your body which is to honor God and bring glory to him in your body I'm talking about your physical body and I have a context scripture from 2 Timothy 2 verse1 15 says study to show thyself approve of God a Workman that needed not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more godliness I'm going to skip to little but nevertheless verse 19 the foundation of God standed sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity not some everyone that name the name of Christ depart from iniquity but here this part but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver also of wood and of Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor and this is the fine print now if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meat for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work flee also youthful lust but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart oh Blessed Be the name of the Lord amen so we have an exaltation right there to depart from iniquity and purge yourself ourselves and to become a vessel of Honor so we are not automatically vessels of Honor but we become vessels of Honor do you believe that tonight all right Revelation 10 in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to song The Mystery of God shall be finished as he had declared to his servant the prophets there it is he is sending a Vindicated prophet prophet he is sending a prophet after 2,000 years he's sending someone who is so far from organization education the world of religion watch and he will hear only from God and he will have thus sayith the Lord and speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece he as it is declared in Malachi 4 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him here we go in that day will be the ones who will truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his Works who the elect with him oh give the Lord some Praises just as the prophet was elected this bride will be elected and the elect with him will truly manifest the Lord and be his body and he is the head of the body called the church that's how he sees the bride as a designated body that he can work through oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah he said God sent Luther with the Earth he said God sent Luther with the word Lutheran spoke for God at a time they organized against against the pure was lost for organization tends towards dogma and Crees and not simple word they could no longer speak for God then God send wle so what what we getting here God wants somebody that could speak for him he wants somebody that could be his voice on the earth in other words he wants a body he wants a temple he wants a tabernacle he wants a house Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me but a body has now prepared Hallelujah and you were prepared before the foundation of the world to receive this word hallelujah so this word coming into you but this word is housed in a body a body of sinful flesh that the word come to sanctify and get a people ready for his name's sake oh give the Lord some praises the people they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley he was the voice with the word in his day the people there we go who took his revelation from God became the living Epistles Oh Glory to God where they get it from from the messenger what they get from the messenger the Revelation and the Revelation become word made flesh and they became living Epistles Oh Glory to God from what the Revelation so this message is to make us live something oh give the Lord a shout in the house the people who took the Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the Methodist fail God raise up others so it has gone through the years until in the last days there's a again here we go that's us we talking about now another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age seven voices through seven Church ages and then the seven voice coming into one voice and that voice will be in the bride what it be the voice of the Archangel it will come into the one voice and that bride going to be that voice going to be the bride yes let's go yes sir the church is no longer the mpce of God we talking about any message here the church remember that bright and church all has same spok on books but it's bright and church let's go let's go the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it it his own mouthpiece they're speaking for theel they speaking their own Revelation they speaking their dreams and the vision and what they get Lord show them and all kind of stories they are the own little mini prophets then right watch the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is his own mouthpiece so God is turning on her when God turn on you there something else you know when God turn on sa that was it you know when God turn on this one when God turn something else you know he will turn on her here the part Hallelujah he will confound her who her the church through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her to confound is to cause surprise or confusion in someone especially by not according to the expectation to confound to amaze to surprise to stackle confound is a verb that means to surprise and confuse someone or something so that they are unable to explain or deal with the situation Oh Glory to God he will confound her who's that church people in this message with the bride and the prophet Oh Glory to God because the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing oh give the Lord a shout that's a sign for you that's a sign for you when a man talking something as we know a no bright talking there's no word talking that's he talking but the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing oh glory to God they will say how them so false and they have this and they have that and they have the other and they so false and they all false to their thoughts false to their ideas but not to God friends we have to come to that place where our desire our motive and objective and our interest is in pleasing God not men not flesh Oh Glory to God not your family not your friends but to please God as long as God is pleased I'm fine I'm all right Hallelujah hated but I'm all right love I'm still all right dislike I'm still all right rejected still all right as long as God is pleased amen an example of confound is when you ask someone a really tough question or act in a surprising way he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her for sin the last days the spirit in the bright they come so the spirit that spoke to that prophet will will come into the bride that same spirit will jump revelation 22 will jump from from from from that prophet and jump on revelation 22 the spirit and the bride What Spirit The Same Spirit that spoke to that Prophet will anoint our bride and speak to the bride and will the bride will have voice as they come oh we in for exciting time it's having drama and More Drama Oh Glory to God you seen the ending of America Oh Glory to God you're seeing the finishing of America you're seeing the stone getting ready cut out without the hands of man to destroy man's Kingdom Greeks had their time Romans had their time everybody have their time but Daniel saw this Vision with iron mixed with Clay Oh Glory to God the end time a broken Kingdom a broken people but out of that there will be a people that know their God oh glory to God out of this whole disaster that is yet to come there will be a people that know their God wind are shaken and are rocking Oh Glory to God but the world will be rocking but the the bride will be rocking to there'll be a short quick message that going to shake this whole nation but it said hallelujah praise God the spirit and the bright say come seven voices seven spirits one Holy Spirit seven manifestation watch he said once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost let's review that quickly at Pentecost what happened son man was revealed in Jesus Christ he raised from the dead private Ministry openly understanding open the scriptures Spirit come upon them and they were hearing direct from God from another book of Acts from Peter Son of God manifested in a bride so this is not press play press play going to be with son of man you understand that words of the son of man but this is the son of man's prophecy being fulfilled in other words this is that that the prophet Willam Bram spake of not this is press play what William bam is saying this is that that there's going to be a bride she will be the final voice to the final church do you believe to your final AG do you believe that he say cried of you have the word you more Bible than ever but you are not you're not interested in living it you are you doing nothing but hacking and dividing the word into pieces taking what you want leaving out what you don't want you are not interested in living it but debating it oh my let's go depart from iniquity iniquity is knowing right and doing wrong house cleaning time you know the story which woman having a lost coin lost a coin wouldn't sweep sweep the floors and sweep the cobweb and and the about house clean time we going into it tonight in other words she she lost a coin her husband is coming if she doesn't have that coin they will put her like an adultery and adulter and stone and something like that so she's sweeping the floor she's doing something to get that that coin she not saying I lost the coin I lost the coin you know lost the coin pray for me I lost the coin I lost the coin I testimony I lost the coin you know Co where lost it in the house you sweep you sweep the cobweb Hallelujah you fast you pray you lay at the altar you cry out to God you want back your joy you want back your peace you want back Assurance you already open the gate for Devils to come in and you have to shut those doors now and get them Devils out you open those Gates you open those doors by how you do by how you act by iniquity by sins and whatnot and you give a opening for the enemy to comeall she swept the floors she clean out the cobwebs she kept on until she found what she has lost the revelation of the seven seas and seven Thunders was to bring the bride Church into true sanctification to waiting on the Dynamics to the mechanics not just to stay in justification that you are called and God open your eyes with I Sal that you may see this message of the hour but to move further real sanctification by the blood of Jesus a separated life unto God let's go even the foolish virgins did not make the Rapture and they were Sanctified holy clean let me say tonight there is no Rapture for the unsanctified Hallelujah we know the Raptor is for the Holy Ghost filled but I want to bring it real to you tonight the clean foolish virgins did not make it how dare you be unclean if you're talking about the Rapture depart from iniquity Sanctified in the message goes where you are not even in the message outside the blood of sanctification of the age which is brotherly kindness the blood for this age is brotherly kindness real brotherly kindness the world will sanctify you because brother what what what does Jesus say forgive us as we forgive those because you cannot approach god with condemnation and your forgiveness from God is based upon you forgiving other and God set it up that way that there will be issues in people's heart Minds lives they'll be jealousy and envy and all kind of mischief and so on and God testing you to see if you will drop it or if you'll keep happing about it and yapping about it and gossiping about it talking about it if you will let it go and you move onall because in the separate dream what happened they pour out the water and it leak right out and Prophet said nobody could hold you Holy Ghost no church could hold the Holy Ghost but then the man came with a big bucket of honey and poured into the Rock box and he said yes he could hold that the honey look like it wouldn't stick but it will stick you could get honey in a group you could get honey honey in a bunch of people praise God but the Holy Ghost you cannot hold that because no church could hold the Holy Ghost amen so sanctification is to be made holy clean apart s see people in the message say I believe message I I bride I bride not because you say that you it's so you know you just talking talking you don't be a m Ching you know you have to me God requirement that's right justification sanctification Holy Ghost just three stages three steps because because the resurrection fell into four stages God brought four stages back justification salification Bap to Holy Ghost Prophet brought the word once the word restored we go back to three steps now justification sanctification Upper Room Holy Ghost the token the person of Christ in Peter and them they didn't go to baptism what the Pentecost had they had the token itself silver and gold such as I I don't have but such as I have I give I have the person I could release it because I am in the body itself oh give the Lord a shout in the house then then Cornelius can't stand for nobody outside the body Oh Glory to God he had to stand for a man who was part of the body who was in the body Oh Glory who blood the blood of Jesus was flowing through his body send for Peter oh give the Lord I shout in the house there was a group who preaching heavy heavy word but they here about the Holy Ghost when Paul said what we baptize unto John he said John baptized in Repentance and so like that he said they said we have not even heard about this thing called Holy Spirit we heard about word on top of word on top of word we heard about Mysteries upon Mysteries upon Mysteries we heard about Deeds Divine reveal mystery truths but we never hear about Holy Spirit baptizing you wave after wave after wave baptism after baptism after baptism ah we haven't heard about this thing called the refilling of the Holy Ghost oh you have heard about it but the prophet said the Dynamics of this church will be more Mysteries no he didn't said that the dynamic of this church will be word on top of word on top word he didn't say that it will be a refilling and the refilling acts 4 but it can't be refilled if it never was filled that's acts two oh give the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory to God if Luther had mechanics and Dynamics Wesley had mechanics and Dynamics the Pentecostal had mechanics Dynamics you think we going to be short of that we are going to have mechanics and Dynamics and we are expecting it if the rest of the message will don't want to expect it that is their business but I am under expectation for the Lord to come suddenly to his Temple amen Oh Glory to God I'm on expectation for my Dynamics Oh Glory to God we become members of the machine of his body you become a member of his body and when the Holy Spirit Come you become an active part of this body matching matching onto Zion unw Christian Soldier matching unto war with the cross of Jesus going on before you are part of that body oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God hallelujah all right Hallelujah sanify is a Greek word the word mean clean and set aside for service so God can't put us in service unsanctified I'm going repeat that God cannot put us in service unsanctified what is depart from iniquity what is Iniquity when you know what you're doing is wrong and you do it anyhow you do it anyway and you become a worker of iniquity Matthew 72 any1 says not everyone that said to me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will come and say to me in that they Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name have we not cast out devils and in thy name have we done wonderful works and then I will profess unto them I never knew you Lord depart from me ye that work iniquity Oh Glory to God so I want to rephrase something we want to say it this way blessed are they that are in a Sanctified state that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled oh praise God hallelujah oh glory to God blessed the day that in a Sanctified State hungering and thirsting after righteousness Hallelujah the opposite of that is those who hunging and thirsting after unrighteousness so you have to labor to live a Sanctified life because Sanctified is the work part sanctification is the laboring part sanctification when you stop smoking you stop drinking you they delete people off your phone because them are the wrong people talking to you the wrong people connecting to you that's is sanctification when you sanctify your phone book you sanctify your phone you sanctify everything that you're doing you want it cleaned up cleaned out oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah what life sory when I was about 8 years old 10 years years old my mother Tak me to a Baptist Church and that was the only church in the country that was my first visit to the house of God later we moved to Indiana that was in the state of Kentucky later on at the age about 7 years old I was packing water one day from a well and I passed by a tree I was weeping I didn't want to pack water I wanted to go fishing with the rest of the children but when I heard something in the tree like a roaring of a wind I looked up I see nothing but a place in the tree that was big around roaring around I kept looking and I wondered why just stayed there like a little Whirlwind none of the rest of the leaves were shaken I Heard a Voice of a man up there said don't never drink Don't drink don't never smoke don't defile yourself a woman s years old don't defile yourself woman for there is a work for you to do when you get older I was scared I dropped my bucket I ran to the house screaming I jump in my mother's arms I said there's a man in that tree the went down to look nobody was there they called the doctor and said I was just nervous I said no I see I heard him speak and I never would go by that tree part I want to get is what God told him don't smoke don't drink in other words you watch what you put in that body because I'm I want to use youall blessed are thou some some Simon M Jonas for flesh and blood has not revealed to you watch but my Father which is in heaven has revealed to you Upon This Rock or Revelation I'll build my church now each church has his Rock confession up to the lodia you cannot make a holy church one two there's no such a thing as a holy church or holy Organization three the Holy Spirit can be preaching it but in there you find good bad and renegades in Trinidad the churches have good bad and renegades they can't say that one girl and this one better and this one is the best they are liars the churches have good bad and renegades are you ready this church too you know I some bad you know you might not be able to identify them I can all right so about tonight I not talk about tonight all right let's go now so watch the Holy Spirit can be preaching it but in there you find good bad Renegades indifferent and everything else so an organization will not hold you can't say we got it none of the rest of them has it no sir the Holy Spirit you should shout on this one is poured out on individuals that that we should close off right here right now in other words nobody no group nobody could stop you from getting access to this holy Spirit it is poured out now the Mystery Men can't talk that you know they can't quot this one you know because pouring out notice the men don't point at all you because see they can't do that they could teach positional P believe teach and teach and teach and talk three hours but they can't out nothing but here what he here the holy spirit is poured out on individual it's the individual isn't that right so this Tabernacle we will see where she comes to church that this Tabernacle is not a holy ghost Tabernacle do we believe that there is no such a thing individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they are the Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost but not the church in the body or a group therefore it runs out oh give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah glory to God do you see it now that's how God sees it God doesn't see the church holding the Holy Ghost he see individuals so really and truly this Temple or Tabernacle is your bodyall I want you to see something tonight he said it's an individual one person Christ God Reve all hell is against his teaching all hell is against against this truth but it is the truth Jesus never said now Peter you and John and all the rest of you got the Revelation the whole church is saved no he said personally I say unto thee not unto them I say unto thee that thou art Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the word Peter means Stone confess one or separated one not one watch he said watch there is the Revelation not them but him Hallelujah an individual not a group an individual all hell is against it oh praise God Hallelujah the Bible said flee fornication every sin that a man doe it is without the body but he that commit fornication sinth against his own body what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah your body itself is a temple is a tabernacle is a house that's how God see it Oh Glory to God that's how God see your body your physical body as a house as a tabernacle as a temple and what you think the devil sees people as as a house as a tabernacle the devil want to step into people that's why when he get kicks out he gets seven more worse than himself to get back for free rent he want to live rent free in your mind in your heart so watch the Bible says what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and that you are not of your own and I said this in the pre this body or house is not your own you were not part of the design team or part of the team that made it we must be concerned with what we do with it Bible say we are fearfully and wonderful in we need verse 20 says and you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods so it doesn't have any time to be loose B talk about women wearing clothes they shouldn't even wear in their own house and they went on the street watch shun immorality this is the Amplified and all sexual looseness flee from impurity in thought word or deed any other sin which a man commits is one outside the body but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body and that's why the devil have all the woman all the lust all the porn all of that to actually get people to sin against their own body you were bought with a price purchased with precious and paid for made his own so then honor God and bring glory to him in your body Oh Glory Give the Lord some Praises brother Bram he start of man you're saying we if we can I want to teach rather building the living Tabernacle building the look what he's saying building what shout it out so people like to talk about their Church talking about the building and the deacons and the ushers and the elders and what but he's not talking about that he's talking

[Applause] you says to build the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place the perfect man the living Tabernacle of the Living God where he dwells last Sunday I preach on the key and the key is fi Faith holds the key so Faith takes the little hinges of the script and unlocks the glories of God to his people Faith holds the key and here this brother Kangle we are going to try to take that same key to unlock the way to become a virtuous Christian in the stature of God and be a living Tabernacle for the Living God to dwell in Oh Glory to God so he prais faith in the key and he said I'm going to take that same key to unlock how we're going to become a Christian virtuous Christian in the statue of God to be a tabernacle for the Living God to dwell in hallelujah hallelujah John 2:18 then answered the Jews and said unto him what sign showest thou unto us seeing thou doest these things the question in Jesus verse 19 of John 2 Jesus answered and said to them destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up Hallelujah then said the Jews 4 and6 years was this temple in building will th ra up in three days but he spake of the Temple of his body when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said unto them and they believed the scripture and The Words which Jesus had said so these unspiritual Jews they thought he was talking about the building but he was speaking about the Temple of his body a body has now prepared and I say tonight ye are the Temple of the Holy Ghost I say tonight you are the Temple of Dynamics oh give the Lord I shout in the house the devil the Dynamics that F in outside upon rocks and trees and grass and no no no no no no no it have to have Tabernacles it have to have temples it have to have bodies that this Dynamics could fall on Oh Glory to God the Pentecostal didn't have the seed so rain upon them only produce gifts oh they were shock Oh Glory but you bride you had the seed itself God was waiting for you to step forward God was waiting for you to come forth that he could release the Dynamics to the mechanics isn't that right he said the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body Hallelujah the Dynamics is the holy spirit oh give the Lord some praises the Dynamics is the holy spirit not I am the Holy Spirit that's a lie from the pit of Hell that's Demons of doctrines of devils praise God man claiming to be the Holy Ghost and man claiming to be God Hallelujah the Dynamics is the holy spirit Peter said seven things Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godness Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true note the word now true baptism of the Holy Ghost not not some mystery com into your head not some mystery that you could talk back Christ Hallelujah comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you get all these virtues sealed in you Oh Glory to God then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place Oh Glory to God then the whole picture changes you're not going to church just going to church you are the church you are the Tabernacle you are where God is activating when you

shout in the house God don't want you nothing less watch when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon Him Hallelujah you might speak with tongues you might imp person any gift God's got but until these virtues here go into you you are still off the real Foundation of Faith even though you jumpack with Mysteries Hallelujah but when these virtues grow in watch the words

bodies presenting all your members and faculties as a Living Sacrifice holy devoted consecrated well pleasing to God which is a reasonable rational intelligence service and spiritual worship and do not be conformed to this world this age Fashion After adopted by his external superficial Customs but be transformed Changed by the entire renewal of your mind that's why people don't change because there's no new thing coming into their system I know people sit down here for almost 20 25 years nothing new they're not reading they're not studying and applying themselves they are the same person as was 20 30 years ago to change you have to get something new this world is changing amen the be system that is to come was waiting for technology to reach to speak Hallelujah why you think have all these cards and all these uh automatic things and all these robots and technology and whatnot is not for joke when the Bible said you can't buy or sell until you take the mark of the beast that's not a game that's what God seeing that's it they overcame them the Beast by the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah and by the word of the testimony understand this the system coming you know all whose name not written shall worship the Beast a system but say it going to be a boycott you have to belong Hallelujah who going to keep you then who going to preserve you then when you have to belong that's it praise God hallelujah I think Kenya already turn the whole country on the gold standard and the prophet prophesy about that they're going back to the gold standard money will become almost worthless when that come what happen now money going to fail just like in Joseph time money fail things going to fail and fall and that going to be a test of people's faith if they ready believe this thing so this is not a joke this is real Brethren hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's go Galatians 2:20 Paul said I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live here Paul words yet not I but Christ liveth in me Paul still speaks the life that which I Live In the Flesh you talking about no church life and separating it know talk about the life in his flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God hallelujah who loved me and give himself for me Hallelujah Philippians 1:20 says according to my Earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by my life or by my my debt for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain okay we in a home Church oh praise God but Bram talk about Elijah he tell them fill the vessels go on get some empty vessels and so on he said take this from Your Vessel and begin to pour and begin to pour she had enough to take care of her kids and so on take it and sell it and so on like he said God send us a prophet that will take the word of God and will take but empty vessels here we go I'm almost done okay so have 13 pages on page nine yeah if God can just get empty vessels and then take the word of God and pour it into the person not say I shook when I receive it I spoke in Tong when I receive it I dance and forget it just stay there until it comes till the vessel is full that's the way you do it the Simplicity of it the vessels was filled up God's strategy here we go is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them that's God's strategy not take coat vers like tennis pow serve the ball man serve back a ball you serve the ball is not tennis God playing God nothing his rocketing oh praise God like when Moses come and thr Sak what you're doing and to go nothing into that you know God snake Moses come eat up their snake that's when he wrongs one God nothing his back and forth thing you know afterwards is action are you

God's strategy how we going all right we going now God's strategy is to take human vessels and shake the world with them at Pentecost what did he do he Tak him 10 days to get them all emptied out oh give the Lord is I here with that man he take 10 days to empty them out that is what wait until was about wait until you get emptied out oh glory to God somebody feeling let feeling L to leave I feel I get it you know Hallelujah P says sit down and shut up because Jesus said the Bible said with stammering lips you you speaking tongues anything happen to you my feet that message word on to of word I I see myself in the word see in the word he say wait until you shall be in with power from on high listen they know they had no power that why the doors were shut because they were afraid once you have fear you know the power hit you yet go perfect love oh come on pre back to me somebody come on come on now come on now what what perfect love does what cast out all all not some fear all say shout out all fear all perfect love cast out all fear so they knew they had fear they knew they have perfect love but when you see that anointing brother the Clarance that Dynamics in the mechanic sh them they slam the door open and they walking out not normal and know God God bless you God bless you that message thing Hallelujah jacket and tie straight tie straight and whatnot This Time Peter tie gone so you understand and they start to walk out so they can't walk out straight you know well here they were so shocking how they was walking out then people but there not time the B even open this hour this hour this hour what you drinking what you drinking hallu it's too early to be looking like that too early to walking like that Peter said wait wait wait wait these people are not drunk he can't walk straight these people not drunk as you suppos but but this is that that that the prophet Joel spake of Peter rocking under the anointing everybody know something happening everybody know that's not a normal service everybody know that's not a normal night everybody know something was happening Oh Glory this is that that the prophet Joel spake of and we will say this is that that the prophet William Brown spake of oh give the Lord a shout in the [Applause] house hallelujah what he say he what at Pentecost what did he do he taking them 10 days to get all emptied out and they were still all standing there with their vessels turned up and God took himself and filled them up and they shook the world he poured himself into them that's what we need today what on Earth a minister have to do between God pour himself into the people what on Earth a minister have to do with injecting himself in the sermons in the message what on Earth is he doing with that when God to point into the people God don't Point me into you that's Madness God had to pour His Spirit into you I can't be in between there that's what we need today is the empty vessels so God can fill them up and you cannot he said God cannot use you as long as you already filled up if you're full of theological training God can't use you God has got to get empty vessels Elijah didn't say go get some vessels and borrow a lot of oil no and and see if you get good sale price he said just get empty vessels and that's what it was at Pentecost they had empty vessels and God could fill them up who is strong enough to conquer these Devils walking up and down the tombstone of inom and crying that these am miracle pass he said we can't do it by ecclesiastical forces but there was a voice one time that did it that Tamed them devils and put them in the right man and put clothes on them that same voice give us a promise The Works that I do shall you do also here we go you will never do it under ecclesiastical gasoline in a carbon struck car you will never do it in organization you will do it when you empty up and become weak musicians come up please musicians come up please you empty when you become weak and pour out all of yourself and let the Holy Ghost come in and flood over every part of you what it have to do with the Mysteries preaching and how deep and how depth how much Revelation and we spend four hours Hallelujah nothing pouring oh give the Lord a shout give me five minutes but George what God said about Moses five minutes in the presence of the pillar of fire taught him more than a 40 years theological training he had in Egypt just 5 minutes 5 minutes Hallelujah if our young people get five minutes in the presence of God their life completely change five just five not 10 just five not with Mysteries not with coat not with books not with who's the man of the hour and who have the Revelation who meet an angel somewhere the corner in the bush somewhere I mean nobody never get to see the angel we don't know if there whoever Angel come and when we ask them about what Angel say they don't want to say we know it's a ly Angel God has said No Angel to to pose Angel come with a message and and the message could become compared with what the Bible say and what the angel say compar what the words say you know where he come from he come from the below he fly from on top he come from below empty vessels that's what he needs a called our church a little minority that we receive God's power and blessing on this message that's what we need get weak so you can get strong it will conquer every devil here we go it will put the learner to shame it will bring men and women that God has called and that only deny your own ability you out in radio out here that hear these tapes wherever they come empty yourselves out pour yourselves out upon God's altar as a sacrifice let the angel come with a coal of fire fill that vessel with the power of almighty God then he said this the some my perect weakness come Lord Jesus catch away your church and if it Be Your Will Lord just before that church is raptured May there arise power oh God fill these vessels raise them up Lord shake this world once more we know it will be Pastime there'll be no repentance there'll be too far them then you show your power fill these vessels and shake this world like it if never shook before take your church then leave the world in a chaos that she sets in oh God this trouble oh my Hallelujah I'm going to skip Down 2 Corinthians 4:7 says but we have this treasure in Earth vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us what do you saying but over tonight I'm saying don't look to the church the building this church scenario here look to the god that says he wants this treasure to be in you you are the Earth vessels that he want to slip this treasure inl the question is not why me the question is you that he have chosen will you surrender would you yield would you humble yourself would you admit on what you need need him God let this sing deep begin to play something let this thinging deep in the hearts the word of God has no right to be preached out of an Unholy mouth it should not be preached out of a mouth of a man that would say that Jesus Christ at once one thing and now something else it must be preached by a power of the Living God through Sanctified lips that is dedicated to the service of the Lord no man has a right to preach the gospel without first being Sanctified from the cares and things of the world I'm going to close God wants to work through Sanctified vessels in the Pentecostal age he worked through men some of them was gifted men Spirit upon them prophecy tongues healing and they with somebody El's wife they're living unclean lives and God using these men his Spirit was at work God sent a prophet word amen and the secret is the wood is in the bride so what God has done now he put wood into his sons and now he's going to use that word that's in you he going to shape that word that is in you and he going to shape you brother Bram somebody was speaking and they interpret something and this was part of the interpretation I've anointed my servant to bring you things that you ought to know but Ram says I've sent him to many nations to many peoples this same message and I'll speak to you this morning take heed to it he said for anointed him and sent him oh God what is it here we go the Holy Ghost the true witness of God what is it deity Tabernacle in men the Holy Ghost is deity God Tabernacle in men here we go I'm I'm closing it's more than a sensation it is more than speaking in tongues it is more than shouting in the spirit it is more than weeping it is more than joining Church it is God living in men deity God himself tabernacle into that person when he can speak is just the same as God speaking that's the Church of Jesus Christ that's the way the First Apostolic Church went forth what we need today is not a Revival a breaking out of Salvation like the days of the wealth Revival when the people in the shops fell under conviction crying and and join and bootle joints and pleasure and so on we need a day of weeping and mourning waiting until God sends the Holy Ghost his witness not an empty shell not an empty denomination but Dey Tabernacle in men could we stand and begin to Worship
