And um Psalms 89, we're going to read from um 1-7 says, "I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever, and with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. For I have said, "Mercy shall be built up forever. Thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. I have made a covenant with my chosen. I have sworn unto David my servant. Thy seed will I establish forever and build up my thy throne to all generations." Silla, the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord, thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord? Or who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord? God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in the reverence of all them that are about him. May God add blessing to the reading of his word. Let us bow our heads.

Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. Okay. Praise God. But God bless you. I think we're ready to switch over the order of the service now. Amen. And we have a tape that we like to play for you. Says, "I will restore." Amen. So, as you get ready to put it on, may the Lord richly bless you as we get into it this evening. You say amen to the word. Write the anointing. Praise God. There's something in store for you tonight. Amen. God promise to restore. This is the uh season for it now. So, God bless you as we hook in to the word. May God bless you. Amen. Oh, you can have your seats briefly. Amen. Praise God. Amen. I trust if you'll bear with me, I express my thoughts on scripture. I want to read out the book of Joel, the first chapter of verse and the second chapter of verse, the fourth and the Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just stand for the reading of the word now. Amen. As he goes into Joel, God bless you. &gt;&gt; In Joel the first chapter, it says, "That which the Palmer worm has left as the locust eat." That which the locust has left as the uh I'm part. I'm reading it wrong. That which the palm worm has left has the locust eating. And that which the locust has left, the tanker worm has eaten. And that which the I mean the caterpillar has eaten that which the caterpillar has left as the tanker worm has eaten as the caterpillar. Now I'm all mixed up again. But standing here with teard and shaking. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll read it again. That which the palmer worm has left as the locust eating. And that which the locust has left as the cankerorm eating. That which the tank canorm has left as the caterpillar. And then over in Joel 2:25, I will restore unto you. Lord, &gt;&gt; thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Our precious Lord as a bunch of pilgrims and strangers, we humbly bow in your presence. Lord, &gt;&gt; first of all to ask you to forgive us for all of our sasses. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. and to say within ourselves that we are unworthy of any blessing that you should give to us. And we have come this morning as a group of people under the old oak tree as it was to sit around for a little time of fellowship. And I pray be God to be merciful to on us and to give unto us that which we have need of. &gt;&gt; May the great Holy Spirit now come among us and come upon each of us and give us the food from the Bible that we have need of. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Bless this group of men. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Yes. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless this gathering today. Bless the revival &gt;&gt; and the Christian hear and for everything that's been done or said during this meeting. And we pray that in the end we'll hear those wonderful words. It was well done. My goodness. Enter into the joy of the Lord. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. Now may the Lord add his blessing to his word. subject that I would just like to briefly say because I know we got lots of things to do as tenant based team. You know, there's none of us just alike. If we should all go up this morning and they give us a fingerprint, we'd find out there's no two fingerprints exactly alike. That's known. They claim there's no two people got noses just exactly aligned. We're so different one to the other and in many makeup. But we can certainly agree that we're all human. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And in our religious beliefs, we find the same thing. We find that some believed one thing and some another. But I've always tried to make it a policy to never try to cross up anybody to do anything wrong. I when I come out of the Baptist church, I haven't went across the country telling what a bad bunch of people the Baptists are. I go across the country telling what a fine bunch of people the Baptists are. &gt;&gt; Because they are. I might not agree with them just on everything, but I certainly would take one of them before I would take an unbeliever, before I would take a communist. &gt;&gt; And as long as they are mentioning the name of the Lord, though I wouldn't believe with them, &gt;&gt; I certainly we might not believe on every principle, but we believe on Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the main thing. I wouldn't need to speak evil of the Baptist or the persecution are not even to the Catholics because there's Catholic people who I believe are saved. &gt;&gt; God has so made it so simple to us that he that believeth and there's many other I wouldn't believe the system of the Catholic Church but I believe in the Catholic people. I don't believe in the system of the maybe the Baptist or Presbyterian or even the Pentecostal sometimes, but I believe in their people &gt;&gt; because they're my brothers in church. Now, in our short message, I had just the first time I've ever tried to write down something, just a point that I wanted to make and come to because not only to preach, I didn't come to preach. I just come to speak to you. And um I preached by inspiration, authority. But in speaking like this, I just want to talk to you. But there's four great danger that I want to mention. And that is Joel the prophet who was God's eagle who climbed up into the sphere of God and saw the day coming. Peter quoted him on the day of Pentecost in Joel 2:38. He said, "This is that which is spoken by the prophet Joy." &gt;&gt; That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; And Joel saw that coming. And if Joel's prophecy was so accurate that it saw Pentecost many hundred years before it ever happened, then surely the prophecy that he has given to this day, we could say would be accurate. But the thing I want to speak on is this. the four great destroyers. First it was the the Palmer worms and the next was the locust and the next was the tanker worms and the next was the caterpillar. Then were destroyers and what they were destroying was the heritage of God. the vine. And if you will check closely on your insects, those three or those four insects are the same insect in a different form. the caterpillar and the uh locust, the canker worm in the I mean the mixed up. The first was the Palmer worm and then the locust and then the canker worm and the caterpillar. We are told that that is the same insect and just a different form coming down. Now if Pentecost was God's vine, which was the new vine that had grown up, then these four destroyers have been the one that eat the vine down. Now let's find out what Pentecost had and find out what we got lacking. Then we ought to find out what the destroyers are, who they are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or what city. Now the first thing that Pentecost produced was brotherly love. That's right. Amen. That's right. It tore down the middle wall of the teachings and made a brotherhood to such a way that they had everything in common. In the Bible days, a brotherhood. Paul spoke of this brotherhood and he gave all the gifts of the Pentecostal church and then said in first Corin or Corinthians 13 that though I speak with tongue as men and angels and have not this love which brings the brotherhood, I am nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. And though I have the knowledge to understand all the mysteries of God, I am still nothing without love. The love of the brethren. Jesus said this for all men know that you're my disciples. &gt;&gt; When you have love one for the other. Pentecost had that. I'm speaking Pentecost, meaning the first group of the apostles and the disciples. They had that brotherly love. They wasn't greedy. They sold everything they had for the furthering of the church. They were so together to even when one heard the other one died, he said, "Let us go and die with him." such a deal. Now Jesus spoke of this and said that Paul and other said let brotherly love continue that was in the first church. But something taking place and there was a fellow come in by a name of a polymer worm. And when you begin to eat on that vine of brotherly love, he cuts the very sack line of it. Because it don't make any difference how smart we are, how much we think we know, or how much we want to be different from somebody else. As long as that brotherly feeling isn't among us, we are fighting a lossy battle. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; We can't win. There's no way for us to win. And now in the Pentecostal church of today comparing the two and what's happened now if you'll notice the routine of the gift. The first is the gift of wisdom. Thank you. The first is the gift of wisdom. That is the best gift of the group. And if we don't have wisdom, we won't know how to use knowledge &gt;&gt; is the second gift. &gt;&gt; And if we can't use the second gift without wisdom, how are we going to use the last gift interpretation or next to the last speaking in tongues? Our zeal has eat up our wisdom and our zeal for our denomination and our enthusiasm has eat up the wisdom of the vine brotherly love. It's all right. And you brethren, the reason I said for you to come this morning, I want to speak to ministers. It's all right to have denominations. There's nothing against that. But when denomination isolates itself and separates his fellowship from his brethren, that old Palmer worm has eated out of it to begin with. That's right. &gt;&gt; When we get to a place, if you want to differ with a man, why is man that I know that I could see eye to eye with as close to scriptures as anybody in the world is brother Moore sitting here. But oh, do we times we're a million miles apart. But did that ever touch us? No. Here he is with a little wide over yonder anchoring the phone so much that she's got almost a nervous breakdown. Call last night crying on the phone. And he loves me well enough. Not because he gets a penny of money. No sir. But he flies on an old rocking plane and everything else to get over here to be with me a little bit. I don't believe the night would ever lead to the dark or the rain would ever fall too hard. But what I climb and crawl through the jungles to get to me. Hallelujah. It's a love. Yet we wouldn't agree on scriptures by 100 miles on millenniums and so forth like that on security of the believer. But that don't make it. I'm even he even in our different I am elected associate attri &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that the power room hasn't touched the guest &gt;&gt; now I'm just saying that for an example and if we could do that between two understand. Why can't every brother do it? &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; I might have a right to say things against the church. I went to his church here not long ago and I thought he never would invite me back. Well, I come to find out that godly bunch of little saintly women he had there was bobbing off their hair and wearing lipstick. I tore the thing apart. But I thought he wouldn't ask me back. But you know what? There was such an anointing of the Holy Spirit around the vine that that old Palmer worm couldn't touch it. &gt;&gt; You know there's electric fence right that Palmer worm can't get over that fence. Amen. &gt;&gt; That shock of the Holy Spirit of love. &gt;&gt; You're going to kill him every time, brother. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if we need fences to build, it ought to be denominational fences. It ought to be love fences that keep the power. &gt;&gt; For he is the devil's number one destroyer. I don't care what a man believes. Whatever he believes now, he's got a right to come right back and tell me he don't believe little things that I believe. I got a right to say little things that he doesn't believe in this church, the Methodist, the Baptist, the Presbyterian, even to the Pentecostal. See, whatever. I'm with the Pentecostal people. I am Pentecost. I don't belong to the Pentecostal denomination because Pentecost is not a denomination. &gt;&gt; Experience heard that Lutheran say a while ago and I will shut the Baptist sitting over there coming down. &gt;&gt; I believe there's another Baptist looking at me there at the check or was see it is an experience. That's right. [Applause] And the trouble is we let these insects get in and tear us the pieces. &gt;&gt; And that is the number one killer. &gt;&gt; That's what's eating in our Pentecostal experiences today. &gt;&gt; Now the next great thing come up was the locust and He was the one who was to destroy in unity of the believers. In the Bible there was in Pentecost there was a unity. And these people were with one heart and with one accord. And Paul said, I believe in Romans the 7th chapter, that there was nothing to separate us from the 8th chapter of Romans of the love of God that's in Christ Jesus. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There was nothing. I've never expressed this before the street Pentecostal people or anyone but seeing the tremendous strain that's been on me. That's why I come to do it this morning. It's the mightiest church on the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And it is the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's only one church. Many of them are still branded badges, Presbyterians. But I might not look like at this point, but I used to herd a few cattle. And up there in Colorado, where we graze on the repol forest and and bring the cattle down on the trouble river association, her association grazes the has the ranch down on the trouble river. at roundup time at the spring when we brought the cattle up to put them on there many times as I sat there with my leg across the horn of the saddle watch the ranger count those cattle as they went through and I was amazed to look some of them had the lazy cave brand on them some of them had the diamond bars brand on them ours was a tripod and others are different brands the rangers the brand didn't make much difference. But everyone that passed through that gate will be a reminister. That's why I think it'll be at the day of the judgment. &gt;&gt; It won't be whether you're a Methodist or Baptist or Presbyterian, but what brands you got on you, &gt;&gt; but it'll be a bornagain experience doing. So, not only amongst the Pentecostal denominations, but all denominations, this great Palmer worm has broke down brotherhood. It did it with the Lutheran. It did it with the Baptist. It did it with the Presbyterians. It did it with the Nazarines. It did it with the Pentecostals. It's always been that old worm in there to make them isolate themselves. God, &gt;&gt; we got it. You ain't got nothing. My &gt;&gt; what a pin &gt;&gt; reasonably at a meeting where a a Lutheran group of people, a dean of a college had brother Moore and I there and he so differed with me. But what got him was in the supernatural and he called me out. to have dinner with him and they would sit there and send his drinks as breakfast. And then when we got through eating and was explaining to him, he wanted to know what we Lutherans have. And I said, "Well, do you say he said to me, "Do we Luther have anything?" I said, "Sure." He has crying. I said, "I'll make it to you in a parable." A man once planted a seed of corn. And he went out in a few days and he looked and there were little two little sprouts sticking up like this. And the man be to praise God for a field of corn. I said, "Did he have corn?" He looked at me said, "Well, perhaps in a sense he had corn." that he has corn potentially. Bind by that corn mature and after a while it becomes a tonsle. Now I said the first two leaves are eluded first reformation. And after a while along come the telles that also look so pretty. They looked back down to the leaf and said I ain't got nothing to do with you. I'm a pretty console and you aren't nothing but just an old green leaf. But if the truth was known, the very life that was in the leaf is made to &gt;&gt; and it has to have the leaf to drop its pollen to further on towards maturity. After a while, the ear comes and grains on it. The Pentecostal restoration of the gift like the one that went in the ground, the return of the power of God in fullness, showing Christ alive at Pentecost to the gifts and manifestations of the first church. But you know when this ear corn come on, he looked back to that thought and said, "You ain't got nothing. If you &gt;&gt; and you old dead losing leaves down there, there's nothing to you. &gt;&gt; But brothers, remember the life that's in the grain come out the leaf also. &gt;&gt; It's nothing but a corn further mature. Amen. &gt;&gt; But don't laugh at the Lutheran. &gt;&gt; Remember, it's a further maturing of the year. &gt;&gt; But now the thing about this, we've had that in our minds until it has created another thing. And we got fungus growing out all over the years. &gt;&gt; You know what fungus is? Well, you know what fungus is what brains? Is something wrong? Something's wrong with the tree that has fungus on it. It's got a disease in it. And Pentecost has got a disease. &gt;&gt; It's got a lot of fungus growing on. That's right. In in all of our churches got fungus growing on we've got the old Palmer one come along with his stinger break down brotherhood break down unity among us. Paul said in the Bible that he wanted us to all speak the same thing. He wanted us all to be in unity. I got a little note right here. I'll go to uh read on it all the operation of the gift and so forth. And in unity they stood as one great big union church. But we find out that that church stayed that way with brotherhood and they love not their lives unto death. They went on in martyrdom. Many of you men here who are scholars, you've read uh the well the early ages of the church and books like pop book of martyrs and so forth and many other church uh church history and how they stuck together. Nothing could separate them. Then during this dark age, they come forth with an organization, they come forth with a man-made policy. Yeah. The locusts begin to fly in. The same devil that broke up brotherhood is trying to break the unity of man. And they made their first organization and that was the Catholic Church. &gt;&gt; God's church never was organized into Catholicism. That's right. And then it was a forces that you had to do it or they pulled them apart with pops. They burn them. They fed them the lines. They done everything and they forced in a false unity. [Applause] The locust begin to stain and it's too bad after the caterpillar has got into the Pentecostal church and broke up the brotherhood. Then the locust comes around add to that and begins to state us to organize different little groups to break up our unity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's one of the destroyers. If the old general counsel when the Pentecostal move was first brought in, is in by speaking with tongues the bottom of the gift, bring it up. If they would have just stayed put and would have never organized and just let it be a Pentecostal fellowship &gt;&gt; in the sin of any organization, we'd have been a million times better off and let us experience &gt;&gt; and not a denomination. Now remember, I'm stating myself. I'm not against the denomination. It has to be that way or God's word would have said it would be that way. &gt;&gt; If these caterpillars and thugs are going to eat the church, they're going to eat it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. God said so, that's just as plain as he said he pour out his spirit. &gt;&gt; What God says for one thing, whether it's good or evil, it's going to be just that way. But I'm just I'm just bringing out something to your view so you can see. Now the caterpillar uh begin to eat or the locust rather and he broke up against unity and they organized the first church leader organizing second and all down to the angels constantly one organization. And when you do, you tear down the very principle &gt;&gt; of brotherhood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brethren, to my opinion, if we are mentally right, we don't weep God's Bible and look out upon the thing and you see that it's that way. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; We are not designed. All one body we &gt;&gt; one in hope and doctrine, one in charity. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What are we going to do about &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's all stand. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just raise your hands and give him praise this evening. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Father. Just give him praise. as we bless your name Lord. Oh, I shall restore, sayeth the Lord. Restore the brotherhood. Restore faith. Hallelujah. Restore love. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Blessed be your wonderful name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Thank you for your word, Lord. Thank you, Lord God. We bless you. We praise you. We worship you this evening, Father. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Father. Amen. Praise you. How many appreciate the message this evening? Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Amen. I will restore, sayeth the Lord. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Let's just turn to our Bibles as we switch over now to the Lord's Supper. Amen. We want to go go to 1 Corinthians chapter 11 23-32. Amen. Praise the Lord. Heavenly Father, we approach your word at this time. Father, we pray that you'd blessed and sanctified and inspired to our hearts as we would read now in Jesus name with thanksgiving. Amen and amen. Praise God. Verse 23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my word body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." After the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he comes. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself. And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Let's just bow our heads and close our eyes this evening. Heavenly Father, we pause at this time, Lord, to observe the ordinance of uh the Lord's supper and feet washing. Father, Lord, Father, we pray that you would bless the articles that have been prepar prepared, the bread and wine representing the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. Father, Lord, you said to do this, Lord, till you come, Father. And Lord, in obedience, we observe this ordinance this evening. Father, bless your people, Lord, as we would come this evening to partake of the bread and wine and to wash one another's feet. Lord, may we come with humility. May we come with reverence and respect and love in our hearts for the brothers, the brotherhood. Father, Lord, Lord, may you fill and refill your people, Father. May you heal the sick and afflicted, Father. Lord, even as we partake of it, Lord, may your presence come down and anoint and inspire your people, Father, for the journey that lies ahead. Lord, we commit everything now into your hands. Bless your people, Lord, as we fellowship and partake around it your table this evening in Jesus name with thanksgiving. Amen. And amen. Keep your heads bowed as we want to observe a moment of silence where you would pray for the ministry and the ministry would pray for you at this time. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. You may be seated as the deacons and elders are ready to serve. Amen. God richly bless you. Brothers get put on the music. Hallelujah.
