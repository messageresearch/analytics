you amen and I believe it's a super sense amen I preached by uh our Prophet William Marion Browning so God bless you as you get ready to put that tape on and you just enter into the wood and write the word as it comes forward and I know God will bless you especially tonight amen preschool so God bless you you could just have your seats briefly and we'll just see just as they put the tape on Amen we're going to open up the precious word now okay okay as he reads the Bible and the 11th chapter just for a a short message being a little hoarse but I had a wonderful afternoon with Brethren and sisters and never got into almost six o'clock and I just run into the room and knelt down at the side of the bed at the bedroom and prayed for a few moments got up and picked up my Bible and started to read and I've seen a magazine laying there and I picked it up and it was wrote an apricot so I couldn't read that and sometimes in the reading you'll strike a word and that word becomes alive to you that's where a minister gets his his message just start reading reading the Bible something first thing you know you strike something then something adds to that something something adds to that something then underline it and just go to the pulpit and read it God will do the rest of it you'll take care of the rest now sometimes you get so carried away to you make little thoughts of what little notes of thoughts that you thought of sometimes in a meeting where you have to come quickly to the platform that is read over them little thoughts that you had made the Holy Spirit equip them to you again done that many at a time now Hebrews 11 let's read the first verse beginning and we'll read quite a few verses now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear isn't that rich let me read that third verse again listen closely through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear as a word of God by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet spake by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see dead and was not found because God translated him far before his translation he had a testimony that he pleased God 500 years of life too but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him by faith nor being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness which is by which is by faith now let us pray just a moment and bow our heads Lord our most gracious God and Father we come now into thy presence again with Thanksgiving and not only are we now feeling that we are in thy presence because that we have bowed our heads to pray but we believe that we are constantly in thy presence because at the eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the Earth and you know all things and you know the thoughts of the heart therefore Lord the reason we bow our heads is to ask this petition that you would forgive us for all of our trespasses and transgressions against thee and that thy mercy once more would be extended to us in so much that you'd open our lips to speak and our ears to hear and if that word might become real to us tonight that these few verses that we have chosen to read might become a great help to every member of God a mythical body on the earth thus spiritual church the church of the firstborn that church that's been bought by the blood of Jesus that's been washed and has been Sanctified and will be presented to God that day without a blemish or a wrinkle how we thank thee to have faith to believe that we are partakers of this goodness of God through the righteousness and mercy of our Lord Jesus praying now that you'll heal all the sickness thanking you for touching that little girl just a few moments ago they ain't doubled in the room in there from pain see her walk out that little childlike faith and accepting you and your mercy and we thank thee for this and pray that you remember a sister Baker's little loved one over in Kentucky and the ones that brother Neville spoke of and oh God the innumerable Camp of the sick everywhere and especially Lord those that are unsaved and Know Thee not if they should die in their sins they cannot come where you are we pray that you'll give us witness and power bone is to speak the word and wisdom to know when to speak it and then speak to us when we have said enough that we might walk away and leave the people in the amazement wandering of the great Holy Spirit in his work Grant it Lord hear us now we pray in Jesus name we ask that amen I would like to speak just for a short time upon the subject of senses we are taught that the natural man has five senses and those five senses control his is or give God gave him these five senses to contact his Earthly home and those senses are known as see tastes feel smell here those five senses which are known to the Natural man and they are good and we cannot operate or live a normal life when one of these senses fail to act your sight hearing feelings smelling or tasting we cannot be normal without them there's something missing some potion of life that we cannot contact without that sense acting and they're good and they're useful and they were given to us by God gave those senses but they're given to you as a gift and it depends on how you watch you yield these senses to will be the way that your life is controlled the way you yield those five senses your what you see what you hear what you taste smell our field whatever those senses are yielded to they will dominate you and we are grateful to God that we have the five senses but by no means was these five senses given to you to guide you they were given to you for Earthly contact but there was giving you the Sixth Sense and that's Sixth Sense is belongs only to the Christian and you cannot have this Sixth Sense until you become a Christian is the only way that you could ever have any more than the five natural senses for the natural person but Sixth Sense is better known to the Christian as faith it's the one that governs and guides you and it is superior to all the other senses it's a superior to all of the senses the other five senses now I would not say that because that we receive the Sixth Sense that the five senses are no good no more yes they are those five senses were given to you by God and they are to be used but when the five senses act contrary to the word of God than they are lying Now The Sixth Sense cannot lie it's a super sense and that's what I want to speak about this morning I spoke on a super sign and tonight on a super sense and the super sense is the Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you and if you let the five senses be yielded to The Sixth Sense it'll guide you and bring all the other five senses under control of that super sense for it's so far above the natural sense as a spiritual man is above the natural it's as far as high as the heavens is above the natural man and his five senses it makes you believe things that you cannot see it makes you act or you do not think the five senses would ever think about it the devil can get into these five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch that super sense that's far beyond his reach that come from God it's called faith faith is that great thing and the five senses does not control the sixth sense but the Sixth Sense controls the five senses the super sense controls the natural senses and the these five senses is see tasty of smell here and the supersense is something that will make you believe God's word well that's the only thing it'll speak about and it'll make you believe for things that you can't see tasty you'll smell it here because it'll take God's word and it will deliver that word to you and make you walk contrary to any other thing there is but God's word by faith Faith does it now in giving this illustration of the senses the natural man is born with these senses so they are nature given senses and that's really only thing he'll ever know about it in his intellectual thinking he can only think as the man you can see as a man he can understand as a man here is an end but when it becomes govern or regenerated or we would call it born again then that six Super sense takes a hold of him doing so that's super sense raises him up into a spot nowhere yes Faith to believe things that he could not hear things that he could not see understandings that he could not understand he believes in anyhow because he's governed by that Sixth Sense that super sense oh how marvelous it is to know it and to think how simple it is to believe it now you cannot believe it until you are regenerated the Bible said that no man can call Jesus a Christ only by the Holy Ghost we went through that this last week and it's been such a stumbling block especially to the Pentecostal believing people when they hear me say that Jesus said and Saint John 5 24 he that heareth my word and believeth on him it sent me has eternal life eternal life comes from God Alone and no man can say Jesus is the Christ only by the Holy Ghost you're only taking what somebody else said what you learned by intellectual what you learn by the natural five senses but when the Sixth Sense comes in the Holy Spirit it takes away all the reasonings of these six senses and five senses and lifts you up into that sixth sense to make you believe things that you can't eat taste do you smell anything does something to you then you can say Jesus is the Christ because you have witnessed it not what intellectual teaching has taught you but what you've experienced what is the sixth sense to do then brother Branham why did The Sixth Sense come The Sixth Sense come for this reason now six senses of Faith the super sins now get the Sixth Sense come for this reason only that was to make the five senses in you deny anything that's contrary to God's word that's what the sixth senses are the scripture speaks of casting down reasons the the fear five senses will you can reason well now why should this man why should but the Sixth Sense doesn't see that at all it's so far beyond it it's so much higher than it is until it don't even have any reasons at all with it we believe it far beyond anything that the five senses would have to say about it now get ready for a healing service see we believe it you walk for that Sixth Sense you talk for that Sixth Sense you live for that Sixth Sense God by that Sixth Sense and rise for that sixth sense that's super sense something that's in you that's different from what the natural man is the natural man only has these and they're all right if they can be brought in submission to The Sixth Sense if the natural mind says read the order of God and says that is the word of God is speaking the truth but if it reads it says it's not all the word of God or or it's uh was something it was one time but it isn't now then that Sixth Sense comes in and says he's the same yesterday today and forever man see that's the difference that's why that so many people fail to be healed they're trying to come with an intellectual conception they say oh I um I do this or I believe this and so forth but if that Sixth Sense is saying that then there's nothing you'll ever shake them from that Sixth Sense the Sixth Sense is come upon the human being to make them deny anything that's contrary to the word of God any symptom any sin is sent contrary to God's promise the sixth sense as it is now if the Christian that's born again and the first thing you know some Infidel unbeliever gets around to the Christian and said now look here there's no such a thing as that Holy Ghost you're just mistaken in that you're crazy if you believe such stuff as that there's no such a thing as it that success goes right straight to work let me show you in the Bible where you can't receive the Holy Ghost you see I can show you where the disciples are got it but uh but yeah well you say look at the sixth sense of point you always say but he said the promise isn't to you to your children well that meant their children there that didn't mean for you it isn't for you but that Sixth Sense knows better why it's already in you they've said it too late you've already received it people who talked that there is no such thing as the Holy Spirit don't know what they're talking about like a boy once beating an apple and was asked by the Infidel debating a meeting he said why do you want what do you want up here he said I want to ask you a question while he was eating the apple and enjoying it a very simple sort of a look like a delinquent person with the hair hanging in his face in one tooth out in front of an old dirty overhaul jacket on he said just one question I want to ask you the infidelity just said there is no such a thing as God it's all emotion there's nonsense to it is all it is and the boy said I want to ask you a question Mister is this apple sweet or sour is that a hard-on or I'm not eating it he said that's just what I thought walk right back no when you haven't tasted the Lord how do you know when you've never received the Holy Ghost whether he's real or whether he is not yeah how do you know where there's faith and power how do you know there's not giant unspeakable and full of Glory when you've never tasted to see it The Sixth Sense leads you to them The Sixth Sense declares that to you there's no intellectual Powers at all I'll ever bring that to you the intellectual Powers will reason and say well it's psychology it's something this way it's emotion with the people but when the Sixth Sense comes in it denies all of those things and moves a person straight into the bosoms of God either come into God must believe that he is and rewarder those that diligently seek him our faith by faith Abraham by faith Isaac by faith Jacob all by faith it's a sixth sense that does it Sixth Sense denies all Simpsons all symptoms anything contrary to God's word any feeling emotion somebody say oh well I was prayed for but I just don't feel any better Sixth Sense would never stand still for that Sixth Sense and say it's a lot I feel better I'm getting well God said so that settles it up amen God said so Sixth Sense only feeds on the word of God that's super sense it's super above the senses it's a greater sense it's a faith it's a power that stairs and drives Hallelujah something that makes you do things that you never thought you would do it's the Sixth Sense the super Sansa you get prayed for it say you got I got a hand you get prayed for your hand you come up there and you believe in God's going to heal you the pastor prays for you you go back the old natural man will say this you don't feel any different in that hand you're no better than what she ever was but the Sixth Sense comes along and said that's a lie you've been prayed for that settles it amen amen like a woman to come to a meeting one time and she come to your meeting two of them they crossed the platform they'd seen the discernments them women were just just swallowed up they were both real Christians one come up in the spirit came and said you are suffering with a stomach trouble at her face lit up she said that's true ah and the Holy Spirit said to you and he said and it's an ulcer it's caused from a nervous condition you've been examined by a certain Doctrine he said that you could not have that I had to have an operation to have it cut out she said every word of that is the truth and then seen she's such a great believer that is that your name is Miss so and so you come from so and so in such and such a place he said that is the truth what was it the Sixth Sense catching it amen the sixth sense in the Holy Spirit was standing side by side the Holy Spirit was speaking The Sixth Sense for saying amen something has to happen when Martha run out to find Jesus I watch he said Lord what's the sixth sense if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you there's the Sixth Sense Jesus pulled himself together and said I am the resurrection in life he that believeth in need though he worked dead yet shall he live whosoever live with them believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this what are you going to say reasoning there's a man laying on a dead and the worms is crawling through him but he's just got through saying he was the resurrection and the life that's God's word that's Sixth Sense beyond the doctor's care beyond the thoughts of scientific research they found final reasonings and pass them down what it's witnessing to God's word I am another will be I was I am now that direction in life amen he that believeth in me though he were dead yet he shall live in whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die leave a style of this he said you know Sixth Sense I believe that you are the Son of God that should come into the world my brother shall rise again home to the Grave they went them two together something had to happen that was a super sense with god-standing presence something had to take place the sense was super sense was God there was something telling Martha that she'd seen him she knowed him she didn't recognize him to be the very Messiah and she knows if she could only get to him if she could only get close to him and present the case yeah just hear one promise come from him that's all she wanted when he said I am the resurrection of life ye that believeth in me though he were dead that's all Martha wanted to hear oh she wanted because of sixth sense to Super sense her faith was moving her to confessing believing this woman when she left the platform it was thus saith the Lord go home and eat Jesus Christ makes you well she went home that night a friend of hers living in the neighborhood was third or fourth behind her she had a big knot on her neck and here she come all thrilled about their our neighbor was going to be healed that ulcer that had bothered her so much this is one of the hundreds of cases thousands of them and this thing not sticking out on her neck and she come up I said no one would have to discern that but you're happy about something you've been thrilled because that woman sitting over Yonder is a neighbor of yours Holy Spirit she thought how in the world could that man know that it has to be something to reveal it to him so when that was said he said you're thinking about your neck yes do you believe it'll leave I believe it she stepped with all my heart I said thus saith the Lord go home and you will receive your healing the natural man looked around and couldn't see no sign the woman with the ulcer went home and tried to eat in my she like to died all the natural man the natural sense of feeling still declared the officer there so after about a week or two had passed she went to the neighborhood through all of her people in the church testifying the Lord has healed me and they said are you eating now no not exactly everything I want but she said I'm already healed for biased Stripes I am healed no matter what well she's healed anyhow one morning the children had gone to school and she got real hungry she was standing washing the dishes by the window she came to the meeting another meeting about a year later and she was washing the dishes and when she first thing she felt a real funny feeling go over and she thought what was that felt like I wanted to scream and her husband had told her said honey you quit talking about that healing that because although he was a Christian said you're bringing a reproach upon the calls how has his word you'll bring a reproach if you don't testify that if you were healed you were healed she said that man stood and looked me in the eye and told me my conditions and the things that I had done and who I was and where I come from she said I hadn't been in the building 15 minutes when he come to the platform how in the world could this man know that I never saw him in my life and he told me thus saith the Lord you're healed and she said I'll believe it until I'm dead he said I don't believe it anyhow so her and her sister blow our friend had Covenant to God that they'd hold that faith that morning she felt real funny and a few minutes she got hungry so the children had left some oats in a plate a little dish and said oh it's always this burner up if anybody ever had an ulcer you know what it is so she reached down and took a couple of bites of those oats oh my she said I have to pay for it I suppose but one of these days I'll be all right but she noticed she was still hungry so she just finished up the dish she waited a few minutes see what happened nothing happened felt good still hungry she fried her a couple eggs and poured her a cup of coffee and got some toast and had her real Jubilee she just eat all she could eat you want to head washing the dishes and about a half hour later she was hungry again no ill effects she put on her little Bonnet and down the street she went into this neighbor's house and when she got there she heard she thought they'd been a death baby in a family they were screaming and shouting and walking around the woman had slept late that morning and got up looking for the goat that was on her neck and it had disappeared during the night [Applause] what was it God at work up here at tato Tabernacle when we had that meeting that crippled boy that come in there was prayed for many of us are deceiving they brought him back in that emergency room Billy led me to him they had him on a platform for three four nights or on the in the building he didn't get a prayer card so they put him in the emergency room I went in and prayed for him looked at him he said Mr Branham can you tell me some consolation I said yes sir son polio got you this way he said that's right I said your name is such and such and come from a certain place that's right he said he said what about my healing I said by his stripes you were healed yeah he went home testifying giving God praise and he brought such a reproach they claim in the neighborhood until one Sunday a group of ministers come in and sit down by him and said you must stop doing that you're bringing a reproach upon the calls and the young man sitting there said Mr if you were sitting where I am if you were in the chair that I'm sitting in you would try to rob me of the last hope I got in Christ that by his stripes I am healed and you know lord said that sitting there paralyzed hands body back and no more than he said that and out of the chair he went glorifying God his natural sense he said he'll sit there the doctor said he'll be there forever or as long as he lives but the sixth sense says by his strength I am healed and he wouldn't have nothing to do it's casting away everything contrary to what God said that's what the Sixth Sense is for old John Ryan not the r-y-n-r-h-y-n that was a blind beggar in Fort Wayne there where we went that day and he was prayed for in the meeting that was the night before the piano played the great position now he's near without anybody behind and when he was blind is Catholic by faith and he he stopped in the line and I looked at him and I said your name is so and so John Ryan yes you're a beggar on the corner you've been blind for years yes that's right you're Catholic by faith that's right I said thus saith the Lord you receive your healing said thank you sir I said thank the Lord he said but I can't see also that has nothing to do with it you are healed and he said he went down along the helped him off the platform the natural man couldn't see nothing they couldn't see no results from that at all well I said he's just as blind as he ever was so two of his friends brought him back and put him in the prayer line again and running through again hard let him pass through when he come back again he said mister you told me I was healed I said you told me you believe me he said I do believe you I have no reasons not to believe you said you've told me all things in my life and he said I don't know what to do said there was a woman back there testifying and she had a daughter a few minutes ago and it's gone away I said then if you believe me why are you questioning me I'm telling you the word of God he said what must I do sir knowing he was Catholic and had to have something physical and he could hold you I said just keep testifying by Stripes I remember you and giving praise the old man for the next two weeks or three he stood on the corner and he sold papers he would haul her extreme extreme praise the Lord and healed X3 X3 praise the Lord I'm Healed when he come back to the meeting the next night I couldn't hardly preach for him he'd raised another everybody keep quiet praise the Lord for healing me praise the Lord for healing me as a Catholic he didn't know how to take a hold of Faith but even though if he kept on saying it kept on kept on kept on until that Sixth Sense would go to work that's right praise the Lord for healing me you stand on the corner and praise the Lord for you the extra praise the Lord for healing me and he walked down the street and I said make him I said how are you John praise the Lord for healing me all right and that life that even made fun of him and another little news boy led him over to the barbershop for a shave about two or three weeks later from the meeting and that Barbara put him up in the chair and lathered his face and he said John he said I understand some little smart addict and he said I understand that she was down to see the Divine healer when here he said yes I went down he said I understand that you got healed just to make fun of him and the old man said yes praise the Lord he healed me and his eyes come open [Applause] the barber trying to catch him in the razor in his hand and down the street they went ah God's word had went to work little Georgie Carter laying down you know what you all know some people share close laid there for nine years and eight months couldn't even nothing but pull a draw sheet from under from the kidneys and bowels she weighed some 35 pounds laying out at Middletown Indiana and our people belong to a church that when I went to hold a meeting there at the Milltown Baptist church and praying for the sick that church said of any member of this congregation attends that fanatic will excommunicate him and her father was a deacon but she got my little book called Jesus the same yesterday and forever brother Hall take me to her one afternoon her mother run out of the house wouldn't have nothing to do with it I went in prayed for her said well how about that nail girl she'd know about the vision I said that was a vision sister I can only pray you have faith the poor little thing had been taught against it a few days and then I was standing up there baptizing she was down there crying but she'd promised that she'd come and be re-baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ if God would only heal her there's your little old legs just about size of a broomstick they couldn't even put her on a bedpan her mother yet a young woman sit there broke with policy gray-headed from watching her daughter laying there dying the inches to work for the female glands and went all the way through her she weighed some 37 pounds I think it was they judged her couldn't raise her up how to put the bedpan on her had to pull her draw sheet from under a rubber one nine years and eight months should lay there not even able to raise her head to see a tree that was by the window one day spinning back up on top of the hillside at George writes the holy spirit said to me rise to your feet thou looking there's a light shining onto a dogwood tree said go over the way of Rights or go by the way of Carter's when I got there the Lord Jesus had showed her mother a sign that I was coming walked into that girl laying down that bed so weak that she couldn't even raise a sputumen cup her mother would hold it trying to spit in the speed him and cuff with the TV I said sister Georgie Jesus Christ the son of God let me honor in the wilderness about a half hour go and told me to cut my hands on you the saith the Lord stand on your feet The Sixth Sense went to work a power struck that girl for the first time in three years or nine years and and eight months she'd ever been on her feet jumped to her feet run into the yards and blessing the trees and the grass and everything and went in and set out the piano began to play there in the fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins why reasons were to cast down she couldn't do it I don't know now I'll never know only the power of God that held her up her legs wasn't that big around up here at the joints nothing I just like Broomsticks that's been some 12 years ago or 14 and today she's strong and healthy going for the Lord Jesus what was it the first time there wasn't nothing seemed to happen but reasoning would have said it couldn't happen but brother she held on to that word if God could take that triple girl at that Salem that nail girly be crippled and paralyze her arms hung down like that could heal her she could heal her too she believed it brother Hall leonider dying with the cancer the same man took me over there his doctor in Milltown sent him up to this doctor that in New Albany down here that so that the Saint Edwards Hospital I forget he brought my children fine man good doctor he examined he said cancer said to Dr Brown down Milltown said he's dying Dr Brown said I thought so tuck him up to his sisters down here which is a a relative of Mr cop used to be the judge in the city and when he got down there said just keep him here until he dies and they sent for me to come down I went day after day with my wife back there we prayed for brother Hall I loved him he'd been one of my converts to Christ and he got lower and lower and he couldn't move his hands Miss Hall said Billy is there something you can do I said there's nothing on Oh Sister oh I can't hear a word from the Lord we I said I'd like for my doctor to look at it and said who is your doctor I said Dr Sam Adair Now call Sam Sam said the only thing I'm sending to Louisville Billy for X-rays and things so I'll give you the report the senator ambulance down pick him up touch him come back Sam called me up and said Billy he's got cancer I'll deliver we can't cut his liver out and Him Live he said he's a preacher he ought to be all right now he might as well tell him he's going I said he's ready to go Sam but the thing of it is I just hate to see him go he's my brother and I love him and I thought oh God do something for me I start to go squirrel hunting that morning I looked out before day nobody was out in the yard picked up a rifle and started at the house there was an old rugged looking Apple hanging on the wall I thought why didn't mean he put that on the wall I looked at another and another and another until six of them hung there I jerked off my hat and fell on my knees on the floor looked up there and then a great big beautiful Apple come down and eat all those apples up I'll look extended above there and there's that same light hanging on that picture younger anyone said stand on your feet go tell Mr Hall nice if the Lord you'll not die but live I went down and told him he wasn't any different but he believed that he held on to it there was no difference seemed like a day past no difference the second day no difference about the third day it started and here he is a living today after years and years yeah man noticed sitting right here miss Weaver but I'm not mistaken when her daughter came after helium Margie Morgan I went down there and there wasn't nothing that woman could do should be dead within the next few hours they had a shot or two they could give her and that was all it had a female operation cancer rubbed through her spine they scattered it when they operated it there was nothing to do for the woman I want to talk to her about healing but she said sir you are a minister of the Lord God and I'm not that you would come into my house counting herself unworthy for a minister come she said I'll live the life I've danced and I've done things that I should not have done I've used bad language or whatever more she told me her sins and she said I'm not worthy of it a scene she was hitting the right line she'd have to get Christ in here before that six Super sense that ever go to work we knelt down I talked to her about though your sins be a Scarlet she gave her life to the Lord Jesus Christ and when she did she said oh oh I feel so different Something's Happened to me something's happened to me I want to shake hands with all of you just then I looked out and I seen her in a vision going back behind the house to a chicken coop I said Mrs Weaver the saith the Lord God you'll make a trip to that chicken coop and you'll live she couldn't go over the way she felt cancer eat her up she couldn't go before what the doctor said she was dying and that's been I guess 14 15 years ago Miss Weaver 14 years ago she staggered up to this Tabernacle when she simply didn't look like she's able to get out of the bed little old bony arms because she promised God she'd come and be baptized in the name of Jesus we picked her up out of the wheelchair almost there a chair took her down in the pool and baptized her in the name of Jesus and there she sets tonight look at her if you want to see a specie of hell wow casting down reasonings and scientific researches and everything else am I because the Sixth Sense went to work that's it look let me say this again just for a minute Jesus passed by a tree one time and it was a fig tree and he looked at the fig tree now please don't miss this he looked at the fig tree and there was no figs on it and he said he cursed the tree and said no man eat from thee the disciples looked around she looked like it always did an hour from that is still looked the same God never opened up the Earth and swallowed it up God never set a fork and lightning out of the skies and burned it to a charcoal he could have done it sure he could he never did those things what did happen the tree had been cursed the faith of God replaced against that tree's life there was nothing physical you could see but weighed down beneath the Earth down in the roots of the tree death was set in it had been cursed The Sixth Sense had come against it it had to die started dying from The Roots that's the same thing takes place with the cancer that's the same thing takes place with a tumor that's your pain take place with any disease finding that sixth sense of power of the Lord God raises up against it but Satan come out of there you might not see no physical condition happen right away but that Faith holds there just the same it's been cursed that Sixth Sense won't that super sense won't let it go it won't pay attention to how you feel how you look how you act it won't have one thing to do with it God's word's been applied The Sixth Sense takes a hold of it that's all she goes to work the cancer of the goodness adrenal away it dies from the roots and it's gone certainly by the same forceful Sixth Sense kingdoms has crumbled lap one wall against another about this Sixth Sense the Red Sea pushed back on a dry ground Made A Way for our children of God to escape on by this Sixth Sense Mighty Miracles has been performed the most powerful force that ever hit the Earth is that super sense call The Sixth Sense has nothing to do with this down here if this down here declares it it says Amen to it all right you're moving on but regardless of what this does bleed that there's where the power if you believe in your heart your fifth sense of thinking lays within your brain but your Sixth Sense lays in your heart you believe with your heart confession is made by the mouth you believe with your heart yes sir that sixth sense that powerful force was that sixth sense that raised Jesus Christ from the dead after you laid in the ground because he believed the word of God said destroy this body and I'll raise it up again on the third day where David said I'll not leave my Holy One see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell is that super Saints cast down the reasonings of these senses believe the super Saints the sense of faith that Jesus Christ gives by that same sense God spoke when there was nothing what is that sense that supersense is God the faith of God in you the part of God that comes into you gives you the Super Saiyan but that same super sense God framed the world together with things which was not and did not appear he spoke his word and believed his word and a world shocked into existence Hallelujah The Sixth Sense the super sense oh God pour it out on me yeah man give it to me and everyone who needs it pour the sixth sense into me Lord I'm willing to surrender these five my own knowledge thoughts casting out all reasons Lord let Thy word be true in every man's Word of Life every reason you ever doubt be Cast Away and let me walk by the super sense the sense of the Holy Spirit don't you want that that's the thing that we want God bless you friends that's what you need that's super sensual ask for something and it knows that he'll give it it's persuaded for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him if the sixth sense says God keeps his word I give myself to him I surrender all I got to him my sense says this will bring it to pass my faith in God's word then call anything else contrary to it as though it wasn't Abraham that God and God said you're going to have a baby by Sarah and him 75 and her 65. Abraham called everything that wasn't God was contrary to that as though it wasn't he walked as if he seen God and he he believed he'd call anything that said that it wasn't any reasonings anything else that the doctor might have said well Abraham you're too old to do that that don't make a bit of difference what the doctor said what anybody else said what his own mind said what anything else said God was right stayed with it that's the Sixth Sense the super Sans God give it to me God let me have more of it to minister to his people is my prayer this morning when that mother brought that little red-headed baby standing here the tears running down our cheeks I said what's the matter sister you said brother Brandon it's got leukemia felt something rise up amen oh he's a very present help in a time of trouble you're not long gone billing I was going down the road driving some colored boys come down the road and they were driving past and they'd swiping the car and turned around and around and around and told boys all over the road and one little fellow was pinned under the car with his back leaning against the car the boy jumped out and started to raise it up and said oh please please Franken would you kill me you'll kill me and they said oh we got to get it off if he's catching a fire that let don't move that you're mashing me to death don't do it don't do it a holler another son are you a Christian he said no sir I said you better pray he said yes sir The Sixth Sense went to work walked right around behind the car and I'll never go to the Judgment but all of a sudden that car flicked over and was off of him and he jumped up and was all right what was it a present help in a time of trouble and God we were coming down from a young colored lady was driving a car in a Road New Plymouth about 400 miles on it she'd been driving a pretty good speed I've seen the car drove its crank past chap all the way into the tree but then I stopped them in a snowy slick road ahead of us but it was dry there and the girl that winds blowing so hard up in Minnesota thought it blowed the car off you remember Billy I run down there to her and there she's sitting there she said oh I'm dying I'm dying they'd call the endless animals come and they had a dead man laying in the back of the animals said I can't take her and so the farmer said well send somebody else quick the woman to dying I walked up there and I said lady just a minute she said oh don't touch me sir don't touch me in my back I said lady are you a Christian she looked at me and I said I'm a minister of the Gospel if you're dying how is it with you and God she said sir I want to be right now and The Sixth Sense went through her the power of God came down she could walk out of the car without anybody helping her the power of God present the very present help in a time of trouble we walk by faith we live by faith the just shall live by faith we must live that way yeah how
