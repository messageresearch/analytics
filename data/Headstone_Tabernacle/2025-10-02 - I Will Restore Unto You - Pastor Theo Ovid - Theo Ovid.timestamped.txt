[0:00] Ed, Father, may you come and confirm
[0:01] your word to your people. Take me out of
[0:03] the way and be glorified in our midst
[0:04] tonight in Jesus name I ask it. Amen.
[0:06] You may be seated and give God some
[0:08] praises while you take your seat. Praise
[0:10] God. Amen.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. The Bible
[0:16] said, "Behold, I send you Elijah the
[0:18] prophet before the great and territory
[0:20] of the Lord."
[0:20] &gt;&gt; So God sent Malachi 4 as the final sign
[0:23] before judgment.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. There's
[0:27] no need. There's no other sign to come.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; There's one sign. Behold, I send you
[0:31] Elijah the prophet before the terrible
[0:33] day of the Lord come.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; And Elas has already come.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; So, we know we have had the last sign.
[0:38] Is that right?
[0:39] &gt;&gt; So, Malachi 4 himself was God veiling
[0:42] human skin.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; According to Luke 17:30,
[0:45] &gt;&gt; according to Malachi 4,
[0:47] &gt;&gt; God veiling a man in the end time
[0:49] &gt;&gt; as a last sign before judgment.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; So, we are living in the judgment hour.
[0:54] What we have is blood applied. Mercy
[0:57] amidst judgment.
[0:58] &gt;&gt; That is what we have here right now.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The judgment is fixed. It
[1:02] cannot be cancelled. It cannot be
[1:04] changed. And whenever God send a
[1:06] prophet, it means he sending a word of
[1:07] warning that we could prepare ourselves.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; So once a prophet come on the scene, he
[1:12] comes with a word of warning. He come
[1:14] with blessing. He come with warning of
[1:16] oncoming judgment.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God. We believe that.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus final ministry was preaching to
[1:25] the eternal lost.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. His the quickening power
[1:29] brought him down to preach into hell
[1:31] &gt;&gt; to souls that cannot be saved.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham saw that. That was
[1:35] Jesus pull
[1:37] &gt;&gt; preaching to the lost. So they got to
[1:39] have a ministry on the earth once more
[1:41] that will preach to the lost.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; So this is not a game. This is real.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; All the warnings, all the rebukes, all
[1:48] the instructions is that we might be
[1:50] prepared. Amen.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; The question that was asked and brother
[1:53] Martin asked the question when the son
[1:55] cometh shall he find faith on the earth.
[1:57] &gt;&gt; The amazing part about that scripture
[1:58] that is after Luke 17:30
[2:00] &gt;&gt; that is that is Luke 18. After the
[2:03] Solomon being revealed the question was
[2:05] that shall he find faith in the earth
[2:07] &gt;&gt; or would unbelief hit the message world?
[2:09] with unbelief take over and we have to
[2:11] have to dismantle the unbelief
[2:13] &gt;&gt; and I am reading the scripture tonight
[2:15] and meditating on the scripture tonight
[2:16] wanting do people believe this
[2:19] &gt;&gt; that I will restore
[2:21] &gt;&gt; do people believe this thing here
[2:23] &gt;&gt; what God said in this word and God is
[2:25] not a man that would lie he said I will
[2:27] restore he's not dependent upon you for
[2:30] restoration he's saying what he will do
[2:33] and God can't lie oh give the Lord some
[2:35] praises God is going to restore all All
[2:39] the canerable, all what the palmer, all
[2:43] what the caterpillar, all what the
[2:45] locust, God himself said that and we
[2:48] believe that tonight he going to restore
[2:51] back another book of Acts. He going to
[2:52] restore back another day of Pentecost.
[2:54] He going to restore back another day of
[2:56] dynamics to the mechanics. God promised
[2:58] that.
[3:01] Hallelujah.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:04] I tell several ministers, brothers,
[3:06] &gt;&gt; one of the things that trouble me in the
[3:08] message was the unbeliever part.
[3:10] &gt;&gt; I understand true believer.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; I understand make believer. But the
[3:13] unbeliever in the message was a tough
[3:15] one. Now I realize it have unbelievers.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; It have preaching unbelievers. It have
[3:20] ministers who are unbelievers. Yet they
[3:22] quoting brother Brandham, but they don't
[3:24] believe this thing. They don't believe
[3:25] Joel too that God said I'm going to
[3:28] restore. And God say shall come to pass
[3:30] afterwards. I will pour my spirit. They
[3:33] don't believe you shall eat in plenty
[3:34] and be satisfied. They do believe he'll
[3:37] pour out upon sons and daughters of God,
[3:39] upon maids and handmaidadens when I pour
[3:42] in my spirit. Oh, old men will dream
[3:45] dreams. Oh, young men will see visions.
[3:47] The young men have a vision to fulfill
[3:49] the visions. The old men have to dream
[3:51] about it. Oh, the Lord, I shout. They're
[3:53] going to dream dreams, but young men
[3:55] going to see visions. Oh, give the Lord
[3:57] a shout in the house. We are here. You
[4:00] are people called out for his name's
[4:02] sake.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God.
[4:10] &gt;&gt; So when God called his prophets, he call
[4:12] them to give them give the prophet
[4:13] secrets
[4:14] &gt;&gt; to reveal to the people
[4:16] &gt;&gt; because we don't have a clue what going
[4:17] on.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; We don't God doesn't give the us the
[4:20] ability to know what's going on.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; That's why he's in a prophet
[4:23] &gt;&gt; to reveal what is happening, what has
[4:25] happened, and what will happen.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; Is the Lord a shout? So you talk about
[4:30] former rain and latter rain, right?
[4:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God. God sent Noah to warn them
[4:34] about the flood. Isn't that right? God
[4:36] sent Abraham give a warning concerning
[4:38] Sodom. God must them warning
[4:40] &gt;&gt; before judgment. Isn't that right?
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. And God
[4:45] has reserved the six seals for the
[4:47] church members.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. For the foolish
[4:50] version, the sixth seal is there. The
[4:52] sixth seal is judgment. The bride is for
[4:54] the seventh seal.
[4:55] &gt;&gt; Under they have seven tenders under
[4:56] there. That's the card of the bride
[4:58] together. That's the gift by faith to
[5:00] fight the unbelief. Oh, blessed be the
[5:03] God. Seven voices, seven voices, seven
[5:06] thunders, seven thunders, seven virtues.
[5:10] Oh, seven manifestation of the Holy
[5:11] Spirit to fight the unbelief. God going
[5:14] to prevail in you. He say one day you're
[5:16] going to wake up and see God is in you.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[5:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Is a message of
[5:23] rapture for the bride and judgment for
[5:26] the church. Isn't that right?
[5:28] &gt;&gt; So therefore, there must be a ministry
[5:30] to preach to the lost, not a book and
[5:32] tape ministry. That books and tapes are
[5:34] preaching to no loss. There's be a live
[5:36] bride.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Preaching to the lost. Isn't
[5:38] that right?
[5:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:41] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; So therefore, God sent this word to do
[5:44] it for a purpose
[5:46] &gt;&gt; to clean you,
[5:47] &gt;&gt; to wash you,
[5:48] &gt;&gt; to sanctify you,
[5:50] &gt;&gt; to prepare you
[5:51] &gt;&gt; for what is yet to come.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
[5:57] Praise God. Hallelujah. And we find out
[5:59] the Baptist almost take over the
[6:01] message. When you believe they have the
[6:02] Holy Ghost and that's false because all
[6:05] because the prophet said evidence of the
[6:07] Holy Ghost is when you receive the
[6:08] message.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; But he was talking to Pentecostals who
[6:11] claim to have the Holy Ghost. He said if
[6:13] you have this quickening power, if you
[6:15] have the spirit, you going to receive
[6:16] what I am preaching.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; And they turn it down. But here come a
[6:20] bunch of people from Catholic,
[6:20] Methodist, Hindu, Muslim, whatever,
[6:22] whatever, whatever. And believe this
[6:23] message and think they have the Holy
[6:25] Ghost because they believe the message.
[6:26] Even the devil believe and he trembling
[6:28] &gt;&gt; and he don't have the Holy Ghost. Even
[6:30] the devil believe and he's trembling and
[6:31] he doesn't have the Holy Ghost. The Holy
[6:33] Ghost is a promise of God.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; He told his receive the Holy Ghost. He
[6:37] wasn't talking about some mystery or
[6:38] some talk or some education. He was
[6:40] talking about as something to receive,
[6:42] something to possess, something that you
[6:44] must have. That's why he say you must be
[6:46] born again in of the word and of the
[6:48] spirit. So he sent the word to give you
[6:51] a seed in your soul. And then he sent
[6:53] the spirit to water that seed in your
[6:55] soul to give you an experience. Oh give
[6:58] the Lord a shout. I'm going to say it
[7:00] again. To give you an experience not
[7:02] without sensation with sensation with an
[7:05] experience something that you know that
[7:06] you are alive unto God. Oh give the Lord
[7:10] a shout in the house. Hallelujah. But
[7:13] when he talk about without sensation,
[7:15] he's talking about the person of Christ.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; This is brother Bron. The Holy Spirit.
[7:34] You are believing unto eternal life. But
[7:36] when the Holy Spirit come, it is eternal
[7:38] life.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; You are begotten of the spirit at
[7:42] sanctification.
[7:44] begotten.
[7:46] &gt;&gt; That is womb and and and flesh upon
[7:48] flesh and and bone and everything adding
[7:50] and the cells the belly getting big and
[7:52] the baby being formed inside it. That's
[7:53] begotten.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; The born is when the baby come true.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; Here he say now he said you are begotten
[8:01] of the spirit at sanification but never
[8:04] born of the spirit until the holy ghost
[8:07] comes in.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; That is correct. A baby got a life in
[8:12] the womb of the mother.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; Little muscles are quivering. It's a
[8:15] life,
[8:16] &gt;&gt; but it's a different life, but it
[8:18] breathes the breath of life into its
[8:21] nostrils.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; So the baby bouncing, kicking, and I
[8:23] feel a kick in his stomach. That is a
[8:25] different kind of life that he shouting,
[8:26] the praising God, hallelujah, glory.
[8:28] That he's singing specials and writing
[8:29] message song, all that. He's kicking.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But until the baby come
[8:34] forth, that's a different kind of a
[8:36] life. So you have a message life and
[8:38] have a born again holy spirit life.
[8:41] Would we give the Lord a shout in the
[8:42] house? I will say it again. Have nice
[8:45] message folks. But there I get the burnt
[8:47] there get the fire. The fire is what
[8:50] burn the snake out. They could baptize
[8:52] the snake still there. They could dip
[8:53] him in water seven times. The snake is
[8:56] still there. You can wash him with
[8:57] mysteries. The snake is still there
[8:59] until the fire come. Oh give the Lord a
[9:02] shovel need fire. Fire from God.
[9:06] Give the Lord some praises.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother
[9:11] Brandham, I read it again. He said, "A
[9:13] baby got life in the womb of their
[9:14] mother. Little muscles are quivering.
[9:16] It's a life, but it's a different life,
[9:19] but it breathes the breath of life into
[9:21] his nostrils. It's a different." He
[9:23] said, "My dear Methodist brother,
[9:25] Pilgrim, Holiness, Nazarene, the baptism
[9:27] of the Holy Ghost is different from
[9:28] sanctification.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; Sanctification is the cleansing, which
[9:32] is preparation of life. But when the
[9:35] Holy Ghost comes, it is life.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; Preparation is cleaning the vessel. The
[9:39] Holy Spirit is filling the vessel.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; Sanctification means cleaned and set
[9:43] aside for service.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost puts it in service.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Then you are the vessel that God has
[9:49] cleaned up.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, do we get that tonight? Praise the
[9:52] name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise
[9:54] God. Praise God. So in the bride gets
[9:57] word on top of word on top of word
[9:58] because the prophet brought a board
[10:00] message. Isn't that right?
[10:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And then the come upon
[10:04] that wood message like what Jesus did.
[10:05] Jesus breed upon them receiving the Holy
[10:07] Ghost. It wasn't the Holy Ghost when he
[10:09] said it. He just gave him a promise. But
[10:11] the Holy Ghost has yet to come.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout in the house.
[10:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. One time he
[10:17] cried, "If any man test, let him come
[10:19] unto me and drink. And he that believeth
[10:21] on me, as the scripture had said, out of
[10:23] his belly shall flow raise of living
[10:26] water." This spake he of the Holy Ghost
[10:29] which was not yet given because Christ
[10:32] had not yet died. Oh get the Lord as
[10:34] though he is prophesying that a sin
[10:36] coming, a power coming, an anointing
[10:38] coming, a desperation coming.
[10:41] Hallelujah. If I don't go, comforter
[10:43] will not come. I will not leave you
[10:45] comfortless. I'm going to come to you.
[10:47] That's a while the world seeth me no
[10:49] more. But you are going to see me
[10:51] because I let you shall also. He was
[10:53] prophesying of what was about to come.
[10:56] And tonight we are here prophesying what
[10:59] is about to come. Who prophesied that?
[11:01] God said it. It shall come to pass
[11:03] afterwards. I will pour out. I will pour
[11:07] out. I believe that tonight. I don't
[11:09] want to stand in the unbelieving shoes.
[11:11] I want I believe that tonight. And if I
[11:13] believe that, I want to act on it. I
[11:15] want to create an atmosphere. I want to
[11:17] praise and worship God.
[11:19] [Applause]
[11:22] I believe
[11:24] &gt;&gt; you're going to pour his spirit.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Not just generally,
[11:27] &gt;&gt; which is generally too, but you going to
[11:29] pour it on me.
[11:30] [Music]
[11:32] &gt;&gt; The title of the message tonight is I
[11:34] will restore to you.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; I want to stop it right there. To you.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; Not to every everybody. To you.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; You have to see how to have a personal
[11:44] restoration.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:49] Glory to God.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't feel nothing. Abraham
[11:54] just believe God.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; He feel turning back. He feel you have a
[11:57] child. He say Sarah was in the flesh.
[12:00] Hallelujah. Sarah was under
[12:01] sanctification. Sarah was feeling
[12:03] feeling feeling feeling that when she
[12:04] felt that Abraham could take a
[12:06] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; But Abram was just believing what God
[12:09] said. God said so. God said so. That's
[12:12] the original faith. That was the faith
[12:14] in Abraham. That was the faith in
[12:16] Genesis. The original faith is not
[12:18] feelings, emotions, and you don't like
[12:20] this and they get in a fight like
[12:21] foolishness. The original faith is God
[12:24] said so and God is in a man that would
[12:26] lie. If God said it, it has to come to
[12:28] pass. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[12:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said,
[12:32] "Rejoice.
[12:34] [Music]
[12:36] &gt;&gt; Rejoice because I'm going to do
[12:38] something. I'm going to cause something.
[12:41] I'm going to start something. Just start
[12:43] to shout. Start to rejoice. He said fear
[12:47] not to land and rejoice for the Lord
[12:50] will do great things. What can the Lord
[12:52] a shout?
[12:55] We don't have the US going up or down.
[12:56] We don't know what going on with the
[12:58] money, what going on with the economy,
[12:59] but God said rejoice because he is about
[13:02] to do great things.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Another scripture says,
[13:05] "Spread your bands. Spread your tent.
[13:08] Spread spread. Spread. Don't stay where
[13:10] you are. Show your expectation. Show
[13:13] what you believe. So where you think God
[13:16] is going to take you the Lord a shout in
[13:18] the house? I'm excited tonight. The
[13:21] devil didn't want this series, but God
[13:22] wanted it. He want to let you know I am
[13:25] going to restore unto you. I don't care
[13:27] what happened in your past. This is what
[13:29] you you're concerned in your future.
[13:32] [Applause]
[13:38] Lori,
[13:40] Lori,
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Sarah was in his in her flesh to tell
[13:44] Abraham, go and check.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; She seen with she eyes maybe, you know,
[13:48] she young. She she
[13:50] &gt;&gt; and look at look what he got produced.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Look at Mary.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Mary was in the spirit.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Mary said, "Pay it done unto me
[13:59] &gt;&gt; according to thy word." Immediately when
[14:02] the angel spoke to her, Holy Ghost
[14:03] overshadowed the children to Elizabeth
[14:05] to say they're not having a baby. You
[14:06] know,
[14:07] &gt;&gt; somebody got said, "You feel anything?"
[14:08] No. You're emotional about something?
[14:10] No. You feel any sensation? No. I just
[14:14] believe what God said.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Do you believe what God said?
[14:17] &gt;&gt; You come in the service all these years
[14:19] and the word coming word on top of word
[14:21] on top of word. Do you believe what God
[14:22] said? Do you believe what coming to you
[14:24] is the word and that word can't return
[14:26] void. He says, "So shall my word be that
[14:30] goes out of my mouth." Oh give the Lord
[14:32] a shout as you sow seed. Oh, glory to
[14:35] God. When a man saw a seed, you don't be
[14:37] looking at it, looking at it. You just
[14:39] sow it and walk away. And you know it
[14:41] going to come forth with the rain, with
[14:43] the sun, with the weather, it going to
[14:46] comfort. God said, "So shall my seed
[14:48] be." God send a seed out to go get that
[14:51] bride. Oh, give the Lord a shout. I
[14:54] don't care what church it was in. Go get
[14:55] that bride. And as we come down closing
[14:58] off to 2025, he's saying go get that
[15:00] elect before we preach the eternal loss.
[15:03] It has some lost people in the message.
[15:05] That's my fallen brothers. That's for
[15:07] fallen sisters. This is what the bride
[15:09] ministry is about. There's a five-fold
[15:11] ministry yet. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[15:14] A five-fold ministry is going to come
[15:16] forth. Go get that bride.
[15:20] [Applause]
[15:26] Brother Brandon,
[15:27] &gt;&gt; he's talking about seeing the sea and
[15:29] the waves and so and beating up and so
[15:32] like that. And he talk about having the
[15:34] same amount of water is not no more new
[15:36] water. It's just turning up. He said
[15:38] revival is not so much bringing in new
[15:40] members but revive what you already got
[15:42] in you.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; You have seed your water but some get
[15:45] stale. They get dull,
[15:47] &gt;&gt; get tired, they get weary. Even the
[15:49] Bible say even young men shall faint and
[15:50] utterly fall but they that wait
[15:53] &gt;&gt; upon the Lord shall renew.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Renew your strength.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; When an eagle get old crusted up against
[16:00] a rock and then they get young again.
[16:02] Renew your strength. When you get a
[16:04] revival in faith, a revival towards God,
[16:07] a revival in prayer, a revival in
[16:09] spirit, a revival to walk right, to talk
[16:12] right, to live right, to do right. It's
[16:14] a personal revival. It's an individual
[16:17] revival. It's not a church revival. It's
[16:19] your revival. And I'm going to restore
[16:21] to you. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[16:24] He said, "Watch. God got the same amount
[16:25] of water. No more additional water, but
[16:28] it shake all the trash out of the water
[16:30] on the bank."
[16:32] &gt;&gt; So that is what a revival does. It whip
[16:34] it up to get all the sticks,
[16:36] &gt;&gt; all the crooked ways, all the trash off
[16:38] the back. That's what the church needs
[16:39] today is a revival. We will get we we we
[16:42] we we will get all the unbelief shook
[16:46] out of us until we can be clean.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; So that's why oft times it get a message
[16:51] like what it brings to stir to shake to
[16:55] rock. What for? To get the trash out the
[16:57] system
[16:58] &gt;&gt; because a purpose there.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; This message not getting rid of trash
[17:05] system. You know that message the trash
[17:07] getting rid of is for purpose.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; The cleansing of the is for purpose. God
[17:11] want to fill you.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; But he got fill up the trash inside.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; He got fill you when you already fill
[17:17] up.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Come and turn you upside down and shake
[17:19] you out.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; When you turn your son, he shake out.
[17:21] Good. Right. Put your right side back
[17:23] up. And then he could pour something
[17:24] inside of you.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, Joe, let's go.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Me long with you because we most of the
[17:34] time we went with this. So,
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Job went by inspiration because he had
[17:38] no Bible to read. So Job wasn't a text
[17:40] man.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; Job wasn't an intellectual man.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Job was a man that moving by
[17:44] inspiration.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; He was a prophet and he only had to be
[17:48] inspired because he know his position.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; So once you know your position, you
[17:52] don't go and pray and say Lord God. No,
[17:55] no, you know your position.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; So when Jesus had to pray for a sick or
[17:58] something, you don't have to say
[17:58] hallelujah, glory. And I woke up and
[18:01] said sweat. Jesus had to walk up and swe
[18:03] you know who he was.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; He said pick up your bed and walk.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm telling you to do. Pick
[18:07] up your bed and walk. He had faith to
[18:09] speak it. The man had faith to receive
[18:10] it. And the man pick up his bed and
[18:12] walk. Oh, give the Lord a shout. And the
[18:15] bride will have that same authority,
[18:17] supreme power and control. Because
[18:19] there's a faith from the innermost.
[18:20] There's a faith on your position. It's
[18:22] not a faith because the anointing is
[18:24] there. When the anointing there not have
[18:25] to do with that give the Lord a shout,
[18:28] these signs shall follow them that
[18:31] believe. It didn't say the pastor, the
[18:33] preacher, the elder or the deacon shall
[18:35] follow them. Not if you follow them, it
[18:38] shall follow you. Do you believe they're
[18:40] going to follow you? Oh, give the Lord
[18:42] some. You ought to believe that in them.
[18:46] When you look back, you're seeing signs.
[18:48] When you look back, you're seeing
[18:49] wonders. When you look back, you're
[18:51] seeing miracles following you. Oh, give
[18:54] the Lord some praises. Who said that?
[18:56] God said that. God said that.
[19:02] But over them is Pentecost. Tell you
[19:05] come message keep
[19:07] &gt;&gt; keep advance.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; The brother tell me now the message so
[19:12] dead to somebody so dead like in the
[19:14] Catholic church
[19:19] man preaching on people looking
[19:20] depressed.
[19:22] That's the worst
[19:23] &gt;&gt; in this message
[19:25] &gt;&gt; preaching on people looking depressed.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; How many you can look depressed?
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Read what the Bible say rejoice.
[19:31] The Bible said they were in the upper
[19:33] room praising and blessing God
[19:34] continually.
[19:36] [Applause]
[19:38] &gt;&gt; When the wise men saw the start, they
[19:40] rejoice with Bible script with exceeding
[19:42] great joy.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; They're not normal smiling, you know.
[19:46] They not that know exceeding great joy.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; What God doing? He's roughing you up.
[19:53] Let your rejoice be it happen. Let your
[19:56] shout be happen. You're not waiting to
[19:58] get a breakthrough to shout. You're
[20:00] getting your shout now. Your shout and
[20:02] your breakthrough coming after. You
[20:04] shout your healing coming after you.
[20:06] Praise God. And you
[20:08] [Applause]
[20:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; So Job now the only thing had to happen
[20:21] for was for inspiration to strike him.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; So these guys were positionally placed
[20:25] and ready for the anointing to strike
[20:26] him. Amen.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; When they strike him so they could
[20:28] speak, right?
[20:29] &gt;&gt; That's the church. Here we go.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; If it's in order.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, the church have to come in order.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. You don't hear much about that, but
[20:38] that is in the word. The church itself
[20:41] have to come into order.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; What order? Man's order or God's order?
[20:45] &gt;&gt; Order.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; It's God's order. He said, but watch. If
[20:48] it's if it's in order, it got the
[20:50] mechanics ready.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; It only need the dynamics.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he said this tonight if we
[20:57] could get the mechanics ready,
[20:59] &gt;&gt; get our hearts right.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; So that the mechanics then
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Not just text and mystery and words and
[21:10] quotes. No, get your heart right. There
[21:12] we go. The things that we can do
[21:17] &gt;&gt; and the things that you can do is the
[21:19] labor part,
[21:20] &gt;&gt; is the sanctification part,
[21:22] &gt;&gt; is the working part,
[21:25] &gt;&gt; is the hard part, is the grinding part.
[21:29] That is what you could do because you
[21:32] cannot produce dynamics.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach back to me. Preach back
[21:36] to me somebody.
[21:39] Let's go a little deeper here. Watch
[21:41] this. Follow him. What? Follow him in
[21:44] baptism. Follow him in every order he
[21:46] told us to do. Get every mechanic ready
[21:49] and stand there.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Then we are ready for dynamics
[21:54] &gt;&gt; to be lit off.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; How you ready for dynamics and you had
[21:57] order against somebody
[21:59] &gt;&gt; that can't work.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; You had condemn.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; You know you have a hindrance. You know
[22:04] you have some obstacle inside your life.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; You have to be clear
[22:07] &gt;&gt; about your own objective motive desires
[22:09] and everything else.
[22:13] Look at those brothers when B say have
[22:15] oil somewhere
[22:17] &gt;&gt; and them brother said boy if we get if
[22:19] they tell us what he say but can't use
[22:20] the gift of commercial
[22:22] &gt;&gt; you see if we get it we go go do this
[22:24] for the Lord and that for the Lord.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; All right they went and after they get a
[22:28] little oil there what for the Lord
[22:32] &gt;&gt; none for the Lord
[22:33] &gt;&gt; they gone only to find out they get it
[22:35] dripping
[22:37] &gt;&gt; and it drop after a while.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; See God was testing them. Yes.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; They say they say with the mouth they do
[22:42] for the Lord
[22:43] &gt;&gt; and when things people say you know when
[22:45] they get a blessing they do that for the
[22:46] Lord. Which Lord
[22:48] &gt;&gt; they are the Lord.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; They serve their own self.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; You see and afterwards now somebody come
[22:54] now and strike the main vein
[22:55] &gt;&gt; to vindicate the prophet did see oil
[22:57] down there.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; But them other guys church folks mind
[23:00] you.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; They had the wrong motive and objective.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Something was messed up inside their
[23:05] heart
[23:06] &gt;&gt; called heart issues.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; Is the inside job.
[23:10] Oh, praise God. As B say get heart
[23:12] attack that's inside job.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Won't heart attack you inside job.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; So watch then we are ready for dynamics
[23:19] to be lit off and only God can do that.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; So there's no need to manufacture
[23:26] nothing. Amen.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; When when Elijah challenge them, let the
[23:30] God of answer my father let him be God
[23:31] gone.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; And them fellas carry on because they
[23:34] custom doing stuff you know them fell
[23:36] afraid for the challenge you know them
[23:38] them seven altars them fellas jump and
[23:41] cut the self and man god they carry on.
[23:43] They wasn't dead believers like me. You
[23:45] know the words on fire brother they off
[23:47] the word but they on fire.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Blow them off the word but they on fire.
[23:51] That's a different kind of group all
[23:52] together. You know when he light when
[23:54] they finish so he say oh god like going
[23:56] for a trip boy only go but he going to
[23:58] bagel or go by the beach where only God
[24:01] go. You understand or go a little louder
[24:04] because he can not hearing because I ask
[24:06] you no fire. When his time come he said
[24:09] pour water. He restored the altar. He
[24:10] said pour water. You said pour water
[24:12] again because I I want them to know
[24:14] there's no kerosene. There's no diesel
[24:16] oil. There's no nothing under no wood
[24:18] there. I want you to know it's water,
[24:20] water, water, water. It's so wet.
[24:24] The fire had to come from God. Okay. The
[24:26] Lord I shout and God take the word.
[24:28] Seven seals, seven thunders. And we wet.
[24:31] We dripping with water. Water. Word.
[24:34] Word. Water. Water. They laugh at us.
[24:36] They mock us. Let them laugh. But we
[24:39] dripping with water. Water. But one day,
[24:41] the Holy Ghost and fire, the Holy Ghost
[24:44] and power. Oh, hallelujah. Let the God
[24:46] that answer my fire. Let that God be
[24:49] God.
[24:53] [Applause]
[24:55] &gt;&gt; This is going to be a short quick
[24:56] message tonight. Don't worry.
[24:57] Hallelujah.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; So, watch. When you get your heart
[25:01] right, when you follow everything you
[25:02] could do, you in baptism, whatever, and
[25:06] you stand there, we are ready for the
[25:08] dynamics. And only God can do that. Here
[25:10] we go. And this detail now that's to
[25:13] drop into your heart that faith that
[25:16] says I am now healed.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; So when when brother pray for the blind
[25:21] man and then make spend money come back
[25:23] in the prayer line because he other
[25:25] people healed man say you're healed.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; He's a Catholic his faith have to hold
[25:30] on to.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; His faith have not hold on to. So but a
[25:35] man tell him say by stripes I'm here. By
[25:36] strip I'm here. So he say by stripe I'm
[25:38] on here. What is happening there? Mental
[25:41] faith at work.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; His mouth.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; His mind.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; His mouth. His mind. By faith, I'm
[25:47] healed. By faith, I'm healed. By faith,
[25:48] I'm healed. And one day in the barber
[25:51] saloon, it dropped down to his heart
[25:53] &gt;&gt; and he was healed.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Then he jump out the barber chair
[25:56] &gt;&gt; and the man finish cutting here.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Then
[26:00] make
[26:02] half zed, half cut. He's out because
[26:04] he's now cut his own hair. He's out of
[26:07] the Bible chair because something
[26:09] connect from here to here. This is the
[26:12] problem. This is the unbelief.
[26:14] Subconscious unbelief. Unbelief you
[26:16] don't even know it's there. But when the
[26:18] word hit you, then you realize, wait a
[26:20] minute, when I look at myself, I have
[26:22] problems. I have issues. Do I believe
[26:24] what God said? It shall come to pass
[26:27] afterwards. I will pour out. I will
[26:30] restore. Oh can the Lord I shout when
[26:33] them conquer them crack the teeth and
[26:35] break down the God's tree when they come
[26:37] to the end
[26:40] they say that no more is a stump
[26:42] &gt;&gt; they walk away
[26:43] &gt;&gt; and God wait for it to come to a stump
[26:46] &gt;&gt; and baron said nothing is stopping it
[26:48] now
[26:48] &gt;&gt; I will restore Luther Wesley Pentecost
[26:52] William Brandon and here comes the bride
[26:55] nothing going to stop this bride it have
[26:58] false anointed it have unbelievers it
[27:00] have interpreters It's a pop center in
[27:01] the message
[27:03] &gt;&gt; that spirit bold you know
[27:05] &gt;&gt; that pill right coming in the message
[27:06] right trying to take over trying to make
[27:09] unity and not unity of the faith just
[27:11] unity and if you don't hear him he vex
[27:14] he upset
[27:16] &gt;&gt; go say unity you know he say unity of
[27:19] defaith
[27:21] &gt;&gt; then you have to go back to def faith
[27:23] &gt;&gt; to get it united
[27:25] give the Lord a shout and it don't have
[27:27] six faith and four faith and three faith
[27:29] you know it only have One faith.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Eva has one Lord.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Them crazy but seven thunders. Give that
[27:36] one faith.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout in the house.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; That's a reserve faith.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; God leave that only for the bride. The
[27:44] church can have everything else. They
[27:45] can have trumpets, fires, woes, woman of
[27:48] the sun, pope, all kind of thing. They
[27:50] could have this mystery, hidden mystery,
[27:52] underground mystery and top mystery.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; All kind of mystery they could have. But
[27:57] you see the seven thunders that the
[27:58] mighty angel came and threw out. Oh give
[28:01] the Lord a shout. It have resurrection
[28:03] in that. It have rapture in that. It
[28:06] have change your body in that. Oh give
[28:08] the Lord some praises. I am preaching
[28:11] all this for no tribulation. Hallelujah.
[28:14] I'm preaching to leave you correctly.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[28:26] What will happen on Sunday? Hallelujah.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; All right.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; No, but preach started perfect man and
[28:33] night he preached blasphemous names. You
[28:35] can't really clarify or get it clean
[28:37] without really studying blasphemous
[28:39] name. Blasphemous names. Get clarity to
[28:41] what he preach in the morning. And then
[28:43] the blasphemous names. No blasphemous
[28:46] right in the morning. Okay. Is right.
[28:48] Then he preach that. So watch he said
[28:50] now when you talk about he say you say
[28:53] automobile.
[28:54] Now I've got several mechanics in the
[28:56] church and he said I'm not a mechanic
[28:58] but it has co coils plugs points valves
[29:02] &gt;&gt; to make up the automobile.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Now when you talk about the baptism of
[29:05] the Holy Spirit
[29:07] &gt;&gt; there's a lot goes with that.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; He say there's a lot that goes with
[29:13] that.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; It have coils plugs and points into in
[29:15] the Holy Ghost too
[29:17] &gt;&gt; to make it up. It's not just one thing.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Now Peter now he is putting it back in
[29:22] the word. Amen.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Peter said faith first.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Add to your faith virtue,
[29:28] virtue, knowledge, knowledge,
[29:29] temperance, and from this bring in seven
[29:31] church ages and so on like that. Are you
[29:32] right? Then he said he has built a
[29:34] bride, born a bride. Hear the words
[29:37] begotten a bride on earth for Christ.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; And the same way he beggets his bride,
[29:43] he has begotten individuals.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; So the churches is a reflection of
[29:47] what's supposed to work in you. Amen.
[29:49] Amen.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; The church age people didn't wasn't
[29:54] conscious and aware what they were
[29:55] living out
[29:57] &gt;&gt; but they were rocking Satan's kingdom
[29:59] &gt;&gt; turning out God's life
[30:01] &gt;&gt; in every age.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; And what God sent the prophet to do was
[30:05] to gather the entire life.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Now the Holy Ghost was born at the river
[30:12] Euphrates
[30:13] &gt;&gt; because of priests and dogmas
[30:16] &gt;&gt; like an electric wire. You can't put a
[30:18] PVC pipe and say current flowing through
[30:20] that.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Water will flow through a PVC pipe,
[30:23] &gt;&gt; not current.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; It have to have a wire for it to flow.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; And through the ages because the word
[30:27] was broken, the wire was cut.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; What brother Brandham did, he stitched
[30:31] the wires together,
[30:33] &gt;&gt; connected through seven angels. And once
[30:35] the wire line up and he jam it and flick
[30:37] the switch,
[30:38] &gt;&gt; it start to flow through the current
[30:40] start to flow. And this is the same
[30:42] thing he want in his last day that he
[30:44] can said there is my spirit flowing
[30:46] freely from them men.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; That's why I keep saying the first sign
[30:50] of the ministry of Jesus Christ is
[30:51] virtue
[30:53] &gt;&gt; going out
[30:54] &gt;&gt; from the man's body.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Because when virtue come at Christ, the
[31:00] woman say he say he say um she say um he
[31:03] say who touched me?
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Watch this. The disciples say everybody
[31:07] touching you. Where's the point?
[31:09] &gt;&gt; They miss the boat clean. He said, "No,
[31:11] I feel I felt a drawn.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody pulled something out of me.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; That woman pulled virtue." And when
[31:17] Jesus saw the woman, he said, "Thy
[31:19] faith."
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Look where virtue is in the pyramid. And
[31:24] look where faith is.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Faith is at the bottom. And what's next?
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Virtue. So faith pulls virtue.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Virtue is power. Power to stop the blood
[31:35] issue. Power to heal you. Power to give
[31:37] you the breakthrough. Give me a
[31:39] scripture. As many as receive him, to
[31:41] them gave he power to become.
[31:45] [Applause]
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Is that instant power to become?
[31:51] &gt;&gt; So God give you a start
[31:53] &gt;&gt; that you could run to the finish.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; So with your faith, you pull down
[31:57] virtue.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Virtue left me. I'm feeling weak.
[32:04] Brother,
[32:07] &gt;&gt; now these things here
[32:09] &gt;&gt; talking about the temperance and
[32:10] everything else virtues must be in the
[32:13] Christian s
[32:15] &gt;&gt; before the Holy Spirit
[32:18] &gt;&gt; ever seals them.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; And makes a complete unit.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; He's not talking about the baptism now.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the person of Christ.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the Holy Spirit
[32:29] &gt;&gt; coming and seal the virtues in.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; Then you become a living moving
[32:32] monument. Then you become a vindicated
[32:35] son. Then you become a vindicated
[32:37] daughter. Every devil in hell know your
[32:39] name. Okay. The Lord I shout.
[32:43] [Applause]
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Then sister gave him a dream.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Sister shepherd.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; We know the dream.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; And she was wondering if she had the
[33:00] Holy Ghost. Yes.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; And in the dream, she said, "I dreamed
[33:03] she was up on a mountain."
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Now, if I didn't feel that, I know we
[33:06] know it. If I didn't feel it to say
[33:08] tonight, I was going to say it.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; A reason why I saying this thing
[33:12] tonight.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; I want to show the context of the
[33:15] message.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; She dreamed she was up a mountain and
[33:17] this mountain she says now she saw a
[33:20] large man standing there with work
[33:22] clothes on, sleeve rolled up, bailing,
[33:24] bailing the most pure water she ever
[33:27] seen,
[33:28] &gt;&gt; pouring into this box. this rock box
[33:31] sitting on the top of the mountain and
[33:33] the rock box would not hold the water.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; It rolled right out of there and just
[33:41] boiled up all the trash and sticks and
[33:44] everything in there and boiled it out
[33:46] and rolled down the mountain and it
[33:49] rolled over her feet and she was
[33:51] standing there right in that stuff only
[33:54] it didn't stick to her. And when she
[33:57] asked why the box didn't hold it, the
[33:59] man said, "That is not water."
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Nothing will hold it.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; And then he went and got another big
[34:09] bucket. It was full of honey.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; And he poured honey into there. Said,
[34:14] "Now it will hold this."
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Do people still believe this message?
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Do people still believe what he is
[34:20] saying here?
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Now she thought the box was a rock box.
[34:25] It was going to burst out and spill the
[34:27] honey, but it didn't.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; It finally stuck together.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; And held it.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; She turned, went down the mountain,
[34:34] going on the mountain, she stopped at
[34:35] the bottom of the mountain. She saw five
[34:36] streams of pure Christian water, not
[34:38] contaminated with the things it has went
[34:40] through.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the dream says the shepherd?
[34:43] No more. I picked up the letter and
[34:45] opened it. I saw her dream.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; So now she wrote the dream, but now he's
[34:50] seen a vision
[34:51] &gt;&gt; of the dream itself. Yes.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; So that is how we end up interpreting
[34:54] the dream.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; All right. Let's go now. Now
[35:00] &gt;&gt; here how he backdrop this dream. Now you
[35:02] cannot make a holy church.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as a holy church.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; So so so you sisters were in just above
[35:12] the knee. Well, I I I I didn't know that
[35:14] but somebody come inside here somebody
[35:15] seat that way they tolerating and
[35:17] they're judging the whole church by one
[35:18] person that they don't even know if they
[35:19] are saints you know or if they just come
[35:21] inside just get baptized in Jesus name.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying?
[35:24] &gt;&gt; And yet this prophet said you cannot
[35:26] make
[35:28] &gt;&gt; a holy church
[35:30] &gt;&gt; there is no such thing as a holy church
[35:33] &gt;&gt; or a holy organization.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit can be preached in it
[35:37] &gt;&gt; but in there you find good
[35:41] &gt;&gt; bad
[35:42] Renegades,
[35:44] &gt;&gt; indifferent,
[35:45] &gt;&gt; and everything else. Everything else
[35:47] means everything else.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Everything else.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; I even like to talk about everything
[35:49] else tonight.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; There's the next sermon all together.
[35:51] Let me leave everything else alone.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; So an organization will not hold it.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; You can't say we got it. None of the
[36:02] rest of them has it. Our ministers
[36:05] preaching that
[36:06] &gt;&gt; not exact words,
[36:08] &gt;&gt; but their life and the reflection of
[36:10] arrogance and pride on their believers
[36:13] reflect that they believe this.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; I want to repeat that.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; They're not saying these exact will be
[36:18] on the pullpit but their life and the
[36:21] arrogance and attitude and pride of
[36:22] their believers reflect this
[36:24] &gt;&gt; that we have it
[36:26] &gt;&gt; and the others don't have it. So we are
[36:27] special and the rest of you in other
[36:29] words like we
[36:31] &gt;&gt; we are able
[36:33] That's exactly right.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; So watch. So an organization will not
[36:41] hold it. You can't say we got it. None.
[36:44] The rest of them has it. No sir. The
[36:46] Holy Spirit is poured out on
[36:48] individuals.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Well, that should make you shout
[36:51] tonight.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; That should make you
[36:54] This should be the greatest revelation
[36:56] striking you
[36:57] &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost, you don't need a
[36:59] church for the Holy Ghost
[37:00] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is part of
[37:01] individual. You get bought it in your
[37:03] bathroom. You get bought it in your
[37:04] bedroom. You get bought it in the
[37:05] drawing room. You can pour it in your
[37:07] kitchen. You get poured on your in your
[37:08] car.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; You get p
[37:15] on you in the church.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is poured on
[37:18] individuals.
[37:21] [Music]
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; So the man pouring the water was
[37:30] brother.
[37:32] Yes.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; This was the seals,
[37:37] &gt;&gt; the thunders,
[37:38] &gt;&gt; the mysteries,
[37:39] &gt;&gt; the word.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; The revelation because the mysteries of
[37:42] God come from God is the word of God.
[37:43] And this word was supposed to boil out
[37:45] &gt;&gt; the trash
[37:46] &gt;&gt; trash.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; In order to receive
[37:51] &gt;&gt; the honey.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; I know people make light of this. Every
[37:55] time I talk about honey canisters,
[37:57] somebody tell me I have fake B can them
[37:59] check my B can fake them have a
[38:02] thermometer that checks whether B kind
[38:05] is real or not. Anyhow, leave that
[38:07] alone.
[38:08] Now
[38:10] look where brotherly kindness is
[38:13] &gt;&gt; and on top of brotherly kindness is the
[38:14] Holy Spirit.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Therefore you can't access Holy Spirit
[38:19] &gt;&gt; outside of brotherly kindness.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; So let's change Jesus prayer a bit. When
[38:23] you stand praying
[38:24] &gt;&gt; for charity,
[38:26] &gt;&gt; forgive,
[38:27] &gt;&gt; forgive,
[38:28] &gt;&gt; if you have ought against any,
[38:30] &gt;&gt; let's change it further. When you stand
[38:32] praying for dynamics,
[38:35] &gt;&gt; amen.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Because if you can't manifest bodily
[38:38] kindness, you're short and mechanic.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Because bodily kindness, the blood have
[38:41] to be displayed.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Because that's a virtue for our age.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; God put it correctly. So the bride,
[38:47] yeah, listen carefully. Have to be
[38:49] positionally placed.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. on the seventh step
[38:55] &gt;&gt; to receive the groom.
[38:57] [Applause]
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Do you get it tonight?
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; The bride has to be placed positionally.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; On the seventh step.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; To receive the groom. Amen.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; What is below bod is godliness.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; To be like God.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; That's a godly man.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; And yet on top of that godliness, God
[39:29] say you have to get somebody on top of
[39:31] that godliness.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Godliness alone can't make it.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout in the house.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; You have to act to godliness. brotherly
[39:45] kindness.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; God have to see the spirit of
[39:47] forgiveness.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Look at Joseph. The quote in him wasn't
[39:52] by chance. Look at Joseph when his
[39:54] brothers came. Now if Joseph was a
[39:56] train, you know what happened? When the
[39:58] brothers come
[40:01] &gt;&gt; wood, you know, not wood, you know, wood
[40:06] cut a piece of wood and licks. You're so
[40:09] wicked,
[40:11] so long.
[40:13] That mean unconverted unchang
[40:21] now and the same v temper and anger talk
[40:26] about the man dying and the man said of
[40:28] foolishness dead don't change you
[40:30] &gt;&gt; if you're a foolish man you're dead a
[40:32] foolish man
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Joseph says to his brethren these wicked
[40:42] men they were wicked
[40:44] very hard.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; You know, it wasn't wicked.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; He told those wicked brethren, God,
[40:52] not you.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; God,
[40:54] &gt;&gt; send me ahead
[40:57] &gt;&gt; to preserve life.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful man.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; That's a man who have a lot of grace for
[41:02] you.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Because that they make him learn a new
[41:05] language. They make him hit a new
[41:07] culture. They make him leave him in a
[41:09] whole new environment. They could let
[41:11] his father grieve and father suffer in
[41:13] tears because he lost his favorite son.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; And yet he was sent ahead to save the
[41:18] entire world by putting a pyramid in
[41:21] Egypt. And when all other bands are
[41:23] empty, only Jose B of green.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. I have a time tonight
[41:32] when all the bands are empty.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Only ch band of green. What was Joseph
[41:37] sent for? To warn them. We have seven
[41:40] years plenty coming
[41:42] &gt;&gt; and seven years of famine.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Get ready. Get ready. Get ready.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4. What did he come to do?
[41:50] Judgment is coming.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Get ready. Get ready.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Today Putin had a dry run of nuclear
[41:58] warming warning for the entire nation
[42:01] &gt;&gt; because Trump Trump sent a nuclear
[42:04] you say he sent a nuclear submarine
[42:06] close up to Russia.
[42:09] Now if he didn't say that he might not
[42:11] do nothing but now that you see that
[42:15] &gt;&gt; as you see that
[42:18] &gt;&gt; so alarms went out all over Russia and
[42:20] they know what to do.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; We don't even have a basement.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Them have bunkers
[42:34] &gt;&gt; things to go along to hide to protect.
[42:38] We we we don't even have a subterranean.
[42:43] Forget it.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Bible says is a small thing in court.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; My lord. So we find out that the
[42:51] messenger, right? So watch this man.
[42:55] Okay. So this tabernacle we will see
[42:57] that's where she comes to church. This
[42:59] tabernacle. Listen to these words
[43:01] &gt;&gt; and you could see if people really
[43:02] believe the prophet but George. This
[43:05] tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost
[43:07] tabernacle.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; There is no such a thing.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Individuals
[43:14] that come into this church
[43:16] &gt;&gt; is Holy Ghost tabernacles.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; There are tabernacles that contain the
[43:22] Holy Ghost,
[43:23] &gt;&gt; but not the church in the body
[43:25] &gt;&gt; or a group.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Therefore, it runs out. Amen.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; So that's why the church the box
[43:30] couldn't hold the Holy Ghost
[43:33] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is not going into
[43:34] that box. It boil the trash out but the
[43:37] Holy Ghost goes into individuals
[43:43] &gt;&gt; so watch
[43:45] &gt;&gt; they are tabernacles contain the Holy
[43:46] Ghost not the church in the body or
[43:49] group. Therefore it runs out. Mission
[43:51] come please. Now this man, here we go.
[43:54] Who was pouring the water, the messenger
[43:56] to the church,
[43:57] &gt;&gt; pouring the message into the church.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; That is the seals.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; That's the thunders.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; That is the mysteries.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Both written and hidden.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; They like to talk that talk. So talking
[44:09] that talk too
[44:12] are written mysteries and hidden
[44:13] mysteries.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; So that the whole message
[44:16] &gt;&gt; was poured into the church
[44:17] &gt;&gt; and the objective of it was to clean it
[44:20] out.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. to pour honey.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost is only coming on
[44:28] &gt;&gt; honey.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Let's fight that.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; That's why that's why God tell John the
[44:35] one
[44:36] &gt;&gt; who you see the dove
[44:38] &gt;&gt; resting and remain
[44:40] &gt;&gt; not one without order day.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Because sometime the dove rest and not
[44:44] remaining.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; True.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; You see, oh, I see a dove hit him
[44:47] &gt;&gt; and you look back just gone.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Gone.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:52] The dough can't stay
[44:53] &gt;&gt; when you start to react. So say you
[44:56] catch so
[44:59] &gt;&gt; that is doing it this way. He said do it
[45:01] the other way.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; I know me coming.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; There's a wolf there. You understand I'm
[45:07] saying? So that dove meow meow dove
[45:10] landing think a cat thinking humble
[45:12] thinking lamblike. And when the
[45:14] arrogance come up and the temper come up
[45:16] and the attitude come up say I gone.
[45:17] Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; And he does not fire the dove on a
[45:21] little waiting. He's waiting for you to
[45:23] change.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; He's waiting for you to adjust. He's
[45:26] waiting for you to repent. He's waiting
[45:28] for you to get a different kind of
[45:29] attitude and atmosphere and spirit
[45:32] because the lamb only hanging up with
[45:34] dove. Dove only hanging up with lamb.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Dove and wolf don't mix together.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Let me finish.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; This man was pouring the water, the
[45:43] message of the church. Pouring the
[45:45] message into the church. But what was
[45:46] the water doing?
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; It was boiling all the trash out of it.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; That is what the Holy Spirit does.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; It boils it out.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Now the honey. There we go. This is
[45:59] brother Ram teacher, not this brother
[46:00] over teaching. The honey represented
[46:03] brotherly love.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness which is this age.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; And you say I shout like brother Jones.
[46:09] I shout like brother Jones sometimes.
[46:11] But let something happen to him. Your
[46:13] heart is broke because we can obtain
[46:16] brotherly kindness and feeling for one
[46:20] another.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't be brotherly
[46:22] kindness by yourself. You go shake your
[46:24] hands. Happy birthday to me.
[46:26] Washing in the mirrors and tell yourself
[46:27] I love you. That makes no sense. In a
[46:30] group is where there are issues,
[46:32] problems, you know, disappointment. That
[46:35] is where you get to exercise this thing
[46:36] called brotherly kindness.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Why do you care for that brother?
[46:39] Because you book bread with him.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; You was at the altar. I'm going to
[46:41] close. You fellowship with him. You
[46:43] shook his hands. Here we go. You worship
[46:44] with him. He's your brother. Now, he
[46:46] might do something in the flesh that you
[46:47] would disagree with. And because you
[46:50] just kind of stay which you ought to do
[46:51] and shun him a little bit, but in the
[46:53] bottom of the heart, if something
[46:54] happened to that brother, it would
[46:55] nearly kill you.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "No." And then he went and
[46:59] continuing on. Oh my. I'll close with
[47:01] this quote here. We continue on Sunday.
[47:05] Before this body can ever be perfected,
[47:11] the spirit will bring it in submission
[47:13] to God.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; To make you
[47:19] &gt;&gt; That's a big one.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; It's a war all the time. A constant war.
[47:24] Paul said, "When I will do good, evil is
[47:26] near me."
[47:26] &gt;&gt; There's a constant war, the flesh
[47:28] against the spirit.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; But he prophesied that the spirit will
[47:33] bring it in submission.
[47:35] You got a soul beside your senses. God
[47:37] never give you those senses to trust him
[47:38] with. God give you his spirit to trust.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Your senses is only to contact, see,
[47:45] smell, taste, and hear and so on. All
[47:47] right. I I had done here already. No,
[47:50] I'll leave it at this.
[47:53] But I close with this line at top of I
[47:56] thought I had here. The spirit here we
[47:58] go. Will bring the people right back to
[48:00] where they were at the beginning. Amen.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; So when God say I'll restore and you
[48:06] know the prophet said this the the the
[48:09] uh when the church is believing that the
[48:13] same Holy Spirit
[48:15] &gt;&gt; is just as real
[48:17] &gt;&gt; as it was at the day of Pentecost.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; How they are born and positionally born.
[48:22] He is saying that we are going right
[48:24] back to that.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; I will restore. Let's all stand
[48:28] &gt;&gt; and give God some praise and begin to
[48:29] pray. Father God we thank you for
[48:30] tonight. We thank you for your presence
[48:32] and spirit. May you have the prayer
