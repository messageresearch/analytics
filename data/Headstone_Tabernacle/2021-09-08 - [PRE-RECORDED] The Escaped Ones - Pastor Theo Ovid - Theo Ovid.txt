thanks for coming uh we want to tune to the scriptures tonight ezekiel chapter 24. i want to read from verse 24 to 27 and second peter 1 i want to read verse 1 to 10. ezekiel chapter 24 24 thus ezekiel is unto you a sign according to all that he had done shall he do when this comment he shall know that i am the lord god also thou son of man shall it not be in the day when i take from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes and that whereupon they set their minds their sons and their daughters that he that escape it in that day shall come unto thee to cause thee to hear it with thine ears in that day shall thy mouth be open to him which is escaped and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb and thou shalt be assigned unto them and they shall know that i am the lord ii peter 1 reading from verse 1 simon peter a servant an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be modified unto you through the knowledge of god and our jesus our lord according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that call us to glory and virtue whereby a given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world true lust and besides this given all diligence up to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and the patience godliness unto godliness brotherly kindness and the broadly kindness charity and if these things be in you and a bone they shall make you that you shall neither be barren unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he had lack of these things as blind cannot see a file had forgotten that he was pushed from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall may god bless this world you may be seated our title tonight the escape ones that's that after the escape ones the escape ones and uh you know america started off as a lamb and the bible speaks that it would speak like a dragger and what we are seeing unfolding being thought before right in front our eyes is the uh dismantling of democracy that's what you're seeing the dismantling of democracy it has to happen because the lamb have to speak like a dragon and things have to happen to turn alarm [Music] the dragon and the prophet said they will raise up a pharaoh that knew not joseph and joseph represent freedom of religion see so therefore it will be a system and take away the freedom from the people freedom of religion and i want to just uh go back to revelation chapter 13 and read something from there there was tree said i saw one of his heads talking about the beast he was wounded to death and his deadly one was healed and all the world wandered up after the beast and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the beast so the beast have to be empowered let's continue and they worship the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to walk with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 40 and two months and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given unto him over all kindreds and tongues and nations this is not skim milk this is the word we're reading here now and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world not some all therefore all those who will escape that's you know the bride we're going to be the ones that are going to be not going to the escape ones everybody else going to worship the beast and the b system watch if any man on air let him hear he that leave it lead it unto captivity shall go into captivity he that killed but the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the fate of the saints and i beheld another beast coming out of the earth he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exercised all the power of the first beast before him and causing the earth and then that berliner to worship the first piece whose deadly wound was healed which you know was pagan rome to enter papa rome let's continue and he do a great wonder so he making fire come down from the heaven on the earth and the sight of men and they received them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying unto them that well on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live hallelujah make what an image unto the beast and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast so the image don't power in itself the image has to be given power hallelujah hallelujah and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he caused causes all both small and great rich and poor free and burned to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that had understanding come the number of the beast for it is a number of a man his number is 600 three score and six six six six is not something tonight oh glory to god should the bible identify the image unto the beast oh praise god you know and the thing of it is in the beginning in genesis god said let us make man in our image and likeness hallelujah and god put an image with first created image isn't that right wasn't flesh man yet and god put this flesh man in the body isn't that right that man couldn't fail that man could not fall that was the original man isn't that right and god completed creation with a man that was in power a man that was in dominion because the man himself as a son had to reflect god and to reflect god you have to reflect his attributes so he said let us make man let him have dominion over over over over everything that creeped upon the earth so man wasn't was supposed to be a conqueror a overcomer a dominator is that right hallelujah man was supposed to be in control of in charge of ruling over that was man and god's original intent but you were by product because eve was a byproduct of the man hallelujah she was that in the original she pulled out of he of man and that became the woman isn't that right satan didn't approach the man he approached a woman we know their story and man fell but god promised to restore praise god you can't catch god in that god promised to restore because god had a plan to bring right man right back and i've got news for you tonight you're living in the verge of the manifestation of the fulfillment of the plan that god had since man fell god always was going to bring back man back to his original condition back to his first creating image so just as the beast of our image we have an image that image is fate virtue knowledge temperance patience goldiness brotherly kindness charity isn't that right and the mystery of god comes from god as the word of god and the word is being preached and the word come as a seed and that image coming to you in seed form by the word of promises and peter said by these promises not by this explanation by these promises you have become a partaker of his divine nature but power shelter power power after coming to that image and we are promised dynamics we are promised charity we are promised the price absolute is not right power to come down oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah two images going to be empowered you may be seated praise god the image of the beast versus the image of god isn't that something let's continue now anyone who can explain anything you don't have to accept it anymore by faith it is things that we cannot explain that we have to accept by faith we cannot explain god no man can explain god he is sovereign he is great and mighty we just accept it because we know he is there and then by our faith and accepting it he brings the response back to us the baptism of the holy spirit so the baptism of the holy spirit comes in response to your acceptance by faith god is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him blessed and added hunger and taste after righteousness because in this last days it wouldn't be two churches or two groups there'd be two marks however i get the mark of god or you get the mark of the beast let me say it good tonight there is just two marks it's not six it's not twenty it's just two all glory to god and you come to church tonight to get marked by god because in ezekiel 9 oh glory to god the slaughtering angels were sent to kill utterly young and old male female little children but come not near any man with that mark and course and a prophet to bring a revelation of the mark of god or the shield of god every mystery is to bring a seal to your life there's only seven seals oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god you'll be sealed oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah by the genuine baptism of the holy ghost glory to god may be seated but abraham dear brother and sister if you haven't got the baptism of the holy ghost this morning run into the kingdom of god as quick as you can the ceiling time is on when the enemy coming like a flood he's raising a standard against it he prophesied that there will come a seal in time when the church gonna be sealed and in united time and sign he said i believe the bride is called i believe she is sealed into the kingdom of god and when god put you in the kingdom no man can take you out no trial no testing nor tribulation nothing present nothing to come could bring you [Applause] glory my god you have blessed the night to be one of the escaped ones oh glory to god you escaped hallelujah you escaped the beast you escaped force anointed you escaped rome they escaped the pope you escape the systems for glory to god you escape ones [Applause] [Music] are you going to escape the corruption that is in the world true lust oh give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] glory glory hallelujah listen you just come to the message you know you escape you escape you didn't know my cell friend you didn't know myself family they escaped the boss who deceived yeah escape the prime ministers who deceive your scope the bishop the popes they escape all of them and you are elected because you'll see your name on that book oh god that's why you could rejoice and shout it'd have nothing to do with what condition you was in or backslidden was sin you come true that have nothing to do with it all that bill on the earth shall worship the beast and if they're not worshiping the beast you have to be worshipping god [Applause] [Music] the holy spirit always speaks the word i've got many things that tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he will guide you to it so after the prophet was taken off the scene god released a spirit of truth two spirits was unfold on the earth the spirit of truth and the spirit of error but the spirit of truth was sent to guide us to the truth so listen to this part now that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of god should be finished to know who god is what he is how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up there by that time in other words you're supposed to be on top of brotherly kindness [Applause] by that time you're supposed to have a faith based on forgiveness by that time by that time there ought to be no odds no grudge no jealousy no malice no foolishness by that time it's just our faith to pull down the cap all glory to god give the lord a shout listen to this listen to this tonight the stone that daniel saw no money cut that out no money cut that saw now that stone coming the coming of the headstone ready or not it's coming oh glory to god you better get ready brad oh hallelujah let me say that again the finishing of the seventh seal not the beginning this is 54 years since the prophet left this is coming out to the end now we finish him we supposed to be up there this pyramid is the bible the zodiac is the bible and we have a bible a written bible all three is the bible your care preaching zodiac you can preach the word and when the world comes to you is a pyramid so that's why when the rapture come and the magnet come it only can magnetize and pull up those that have that in them because that's how the magnetism of the hole he goes jesus listen jesus could say destroy this body in three days i will raise it up because jesus knew the quickening power was resident in him oh glory to god hallelujah praise god that light was already in him you put him down in hell he's still coming up you can't stop him [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] the bible the bible call it listen the glorious liberty of the sons of god that's not your think you're free you know that's that you think you're free you know that is free on the inside free free [Music] the glorious liberty the whole creation said come on you can make it come on come on come on you sir you can make it we waiting on you we waiting for our masters we waiting for our rulers [Applause] may be seated let's continue watch he said the seed of god the word of god jesus said in a certain place the word is a seed and every seed will bring what after its kind now if the christian the children of god the church of the kingdom has become the seed of god then they must be the word of god the word of god manifested in the age that they're living in you shall replace it if the children is the seed then there must be the word word manifested don't get tired not talking with no word manifested hallelujah so when they say the children of the seed and the children had a word would it manifest it so god wants a life from you god wants your life to thunder when you speak the devil must hear hell must know our son and her daughter is walking the street do you believe that this is not to join anything you know this is coming to sonship coming into godship coming into inheritance coming to know who you are and what god bless you for [Applause] let me see then okay we are first with children with your husband white children family whatnot and first it's not really fast enough spirits on them amen if god give you the power and you're walking with the anointing and back the spirit offered them they get free you know because they don't even know what on them you know no you're watching flesh and blood the acting so they answer back they ruined this but you have seen the spirit behind that but if they get spread off at that if the child nice the child normally try their bone to be like they want to want to look back like that but something moving upon that child that's why the prophet said when they check up the age of accountability the devil has come and the holy ghost has come and whatever the child leans to used to that is what overtakes the child then you have trouble in schools then afterwards they get the bandits and rubbers and everything else a spirit on them a spirit different spirit mandatory anointing all kinds of alternative employment do that kind of stuff it's a spirit and the prophecy a spirit has to come upon the bride [Music] it wasn't samson muscles it was the spirit upon samson it was the spirit upon david it was a spirit upon the brothers it's not you it's not going to be you is the spirit coming upon you jesus said the spirit is upon me for he hath anointed me oh glory to god [Applause] oh give the lord a shout you could be anointed and get your healing tonight get your ceiling tonight get your deliverance tonight you can leave there completely change and transform tonight [Applause] do i hear a shout in the house oh glory to god hallelujah you may be seasoned that is why the devil fight worship fight the atmosphere fight your worshipping and your praise and life baptised in the is day but have people with itchiness you know what they want teachers not preachers you know they want teachers people that could stimulate the gray matter stimulate the head i never see you so good but that can't fight the devil you know you can explain this the devil you know because that some fellas intellectual thought they could get a gift and the power and say come out devil in the name of of jesus paul preacher come on daryl in the name of jesus and the impersonation the devil said to talk to the man he said paul i know peter i know that talk i don't know you don't have what you're talking about and you spray jump on them and all them get in trouble but when paul comes walking the devil is going left right they say are you saying that devil's moving away why because a man of god is stuck because a son of god is back in the earth somebody who know where they come from know where they're going how much time did they ever back up in your own home back up in your whole house in your own environment you don't even know what to do it's the devil but there's a mind of christ in every situation there's an intelligence behind everything if we can tap into the intelligence it's over oh give the lord a shout praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god every situation in your life and around you there's an intelligence behind it nothing is by chance hallelujah glory to god when esther was in the king and she didn't know where she was at and who she belongs they had to tell her but do you know that you were there for such a time as this you think you will escape because you're in the palace you don't know you will get a lick up to you when you get destroyed too you have to do something then esther say if i perish apparent she come to a point of desperation she come to a point where she didn't care no more she said i'm going to the prison of the king you're not supposed to go unless you are called did you hear that you're not supposed to go until you were called but this woman she saw the need she saw the hour she saw what was going to happen if she didn't make a move and if you don't make a move you will be hitting this tribulation normal normal normal but there's a rapture oh glory to god there is a wedding supper i don't want to miss it this being when it's completed is a servant of god in the church of god that's going in the rapture not this being when we talk about it that is not something on a blackboard to send our blackboard to say faith and virtual knowledge and second be that one foot that have to be a living [Applause] let me be seated i want to see if god could bring it uninspired be real to you those virtues have to come alive it has to be living and the only way you can do it alive is when it's tested and i know you might want to say amen because i said test it because people have a problem with using certain words but i go say it anyhow the only way you can know that life is when it's tested the only way to know your brotherly kindness is when somebody really do you in and you have no you have to forgive them [Applause] and there are situations where you are right and they are wrong and you've forgiven them you've given up your rights to be right and letting it go even if you are right and let us kill you because you know you're right but you're it wrong oh give the lord a shout hallelujah praise god you're pressing for peace because you want to keep the atmosphere right devil want to shake you off the atmosphere oh my oh glory to god when the prophet was behind the pulpit you may be seated and that maniac man coming you got some beating up preachers he thought there was another one of them what he come up with he said you snake in the grass you say you're hypocrite i could beat you and whoever you trapped me prophet nice words you know it's not just words only speaking spirit if you only let that seed inside of you you fight that you run to four hundred men how much many are the prophets running on the platform and they leave here alone five foot short man standing there and the prophet just under the anointing he keeping the atmosphere you're breaking it the devil that man talking his talk he said because you have challenged the spirit of god you will fall over my feet you will fall over my feet so you had to come come on the platform somebody said call the police he said no don't call them police there's no flesh and blood affair no blue blue lights anything in the end with this thing hallelujah not blue blue uniform coming to interfere with this thing there's the devil coming out of here and he says god on top of here this is the god versus the devil oh glory to the god of the devil and that man is guarding me devil upon that man is god upon me oh he shall fall on my feet the man come up on the platform spinning around he's like come on i'm satan and fall right over the prophet's feet oh glory to god you can defeat the spirit of god show me once wherever the spirit of god will defeat it in genesis darkness cover the earth and god said let there be light and the spirit of god began to move upon the water and in every confusion in every darkness and every chaos once the spirit began to move what we need is the spirit to begin to move you can't explain that you can't overtalk that other you can't teach that that is something to be manifested oh give the lord a shout they want teachers having itchiness they are here enough still want to hear more oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god praise god amen or if the church and the children of god the church of the kingdom had become the seed of god there must be the word of god the word of god manifested in the aid that they're living in for the promises of that age that is why watch watch we have lived through luther's age wesley age pentecostal age and the pentecostal age each age is given a promise of the word and the people of that age that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age i'm not going to do who the past says the people that manifest the promise of that age so god put brotherly kindness on top and on top of that have the holy spirit because the cap can't come down on top of early candidates that they be called out so they called out is the escaped one be called out is those who escaped laurisia which is heavy high-minded lukewarm god spewed them out the mouth that means church members that is not wise version that is foolish versions the called out is who see the oil who see the holy spirit that is dear you have to get into so that is why he said does if that be so then the seven thunders kept the pyramid then he wasn't identifying the thunders through the ages and that way he was showing their thunders in the holy spirit slot to cap your pyramid the pyramid of your life oh glory to god therefore the seven thunders julies and two parts mechanics and dynamics hallelujah literally turn the half of the children back to the face as far as these mysteries that's that's the mechanic part but the dynamic part what we see should make a church that will make a revival that people would fly from everywhere saying them seven thunders is being manifested devil has seen nothing here all he's seen is church and groups and pulpit and nice talk and nice messages and nice titles the devil has seen nothing yet or give the lord a shout when they were in the upper room they were shouting and dancing up a room that they moved shaytan but when peter said silvan gold how i known such as i have i give it unto you devil got up he took note of that oh the devil [Music] we have nice messages nice sermon and lucy lucy nothing first another impress when this become manifest oh yeah he said no no no no this can work this just can't work but it's going to work because god promised to release the sons of god when born sons fill speak and their word is backed up the world began to materialize oh glory to god you think all these years the training was just to be talking talking yapping yapping yapping no the writer said the lord himself went everywhere with him confirming the world with signs following do you know the glory of god had to fill this tabernacle do you know that you are the tabernacle do you know that you have to be filled with the glory of god do you know when solomon had everything in place and shalom begin to pray the glory of god filled the tabernacle that the minister couldn't even stand to minister do you know when god is finished with you word on top of a word on top of where and upper word and that glory coming upon you it will fill your tabernacle you shall be filled that is your promise or give the lord some praise and worship [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god watch this watch this here and the people of that age that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age according to jesus right here they are the children of the kingdom not angry message nabiva prophet not that this is children of the kingdom the manifestation the detail in it now there's the fine line the manifestation of the holy spirit operating through his children is though seed of the kingdom at that age so god they're going to rest until the holy spirit begin to operate in you in me until you come into your position until you get your inheritance he gives some apostles he gives some pastors he gives some teachers he gives some evangelists he gives some prophets isn't that right and after that he give gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues prophecy gift of healing gift of wisdom gift of knowledge gift of interpretation every gift have to be on the floor every gift is needed god only god only have a mouth god advice to god i have hands to god i fought through or give the lord a shout your body is not just a mote part or give the lord a show [Applause] what do you say i'm saying every member is just as important as the preacher [Music] i know i know i know the preachers might talk that and preach that but i will say to you every member is just as important as the man behind the pulpit because everybody will be baptized into the body they are outward parts of your body and they are inside part of your body you like your hand you like your head like your ears take out your heart and see what happened let somebody come and take out your two kidneys and see what happened to your body your nice body it had parts you can see [Music] [Applause] body that

before the breath come everything was in order like a mighty army stand up without life oh glory to god the bread another prophecy have to call for the breath but everything was in place now it was like in a gardener eating a man formed in the dust of the earth but there was no spirit man inside there you could see adam the whole body standing there but there was no breath in him and god put the first man the spirit man in this standing man with no life in him and when he put that first man in the second man man become a living soul all the time adam couldn't tell the soil he couldn't walk the field it was a spirit just moving but now the spirit take up a house the spirit of a body and when we die the host is in the box but the spirit move on step into your teaophony step into another body altogether oh glory god if this earthly time that could be dissolved we have another one waiting so we know what we're talking about we know where we go in or give the lord a shout hallelujah

will put on your shoes he would wear your tie he would wear your dress you'll be feeling good [Music] [Applause] god has predestinated us unto inheritance watch if i am if i am a right inheritance of something if god is knocking at my heart and said say william branham i call you a long time before the foundational world to preach the gospel i have an inheritance of eternal life god sent jesus to make that inheritance real to me we ourselves had no inheritance we were sinners we had rejections all of a sudden we find out we have a deed we have a book that was sealed oh good and somebody said your name and they know let me see let me see when he said to pull the seals off you see his name and what my name connected with inheritance what what my father leave for me oh you mean a house land a boat you leave destiny oh yes i want it it doesn't say you deserve it you want it because he'll leave it for you [Applause] i thought of my hair because i thought i thought you bought the roof already you know when you hear that you know this is not i'm so unworthy don't call me that talk this is not the unworthy business am i saying oh god oh god they've done that this is inheritance left [Applause] [Music] [Applause] andrew standing up with a guy who the kind of comedian guy comic guy he said um he was checking his how much it's how much square acres did he would have and he recognized that if if you're measured everybody can get 80 equals or something so and he asked god for 80 acres and then he said lord i have some friends in prison did not come out could i get theirs too and he ended up getting about a hundred acres in his life he you know i mean but i'm saying a child like kind of fit he said them for the communists so they they can't get any of this i can't get mine if you don't want what god promised it have somebody else who will take it no no no no he came and says oh and his own receive him not but as many i'll receive him that's you like me to them he released our power to become power to be transformed but i want to add okay if the lord i shall is that instant thing is something that takes it from one spheres to another phase one step to another step you see we all want to get there right away but god have steps shout out steps right order my steps oh god god have steps and he make you go through these steps and test you at every step that you're qualified to go to the next step oh glory to god he's not trying to pressurize you he's trying to qualify you to go to the next level [Applause] you know like them young people playing a video game they came business i could have never played like they had a hand moving so anything like that well to go to the next level you have to pass the reason level if you don't pass that level you'll never you'll never break out instead of keep on keep on keep on keep on and i'll go next level the room next level next level whatever god have here in every age god was having levels hallelujah until the final age all them thunder that he'd ever get in each age god gathered them together in this age and dropping it on the bride to give him all seven every age he was getting them one by one by one god say get it all i'd drop in some sundays last days they will get the devil some good thunders what are you talking about shake up hell shaken up listen this place will be so shaken the graves are not gonna shake open there will be a resurrection because the church will come to perfection by manifestation give the lord i shall always fight for ministry for the perfecting sins men flesh men ordinary men human beings think that they're doing that monkey perfect man sinful man perfect man they don't understand his fifo ministry as prophesied by the prophet of william branham and he said the fifo ministry is the ministry of jesus christ it's not this man ministry and that you have a great ministry what are you talking about that's not the message jesus christ you mentioned something different all together you have to be given that you have to come into that god have to put you put that upon you there is not a man trying a thing and my church and my church is better than everybody else's church they foolishness like humans business that's not the message jesus christ there is one cap there is one head there is one head you must recognize the headship of jesus christ oh glory to god i'm not the head of the church he is the head of the body called the church in that body of fightful ministry in that body of believers with gifts with places in that body but on top of that body christ alone is the head could look at the lord i shout oh do you see what i'm saying then oh glory to god so in the early part of bahrain ministry he said i said boy i represent the faith by way of a divine gift it's a powerful statement i represent the faith by way of a divine gift the faith didn't come into him yet he had a gift of healing and that was so powerful to take him for jesus christ but here was a growth from first pull second turtle into the ministry of jesus christ where god himself was veiled in him that's why you could say come to the unveiling of the mighty god oh glory to god and when god was veiling him god spoke himself out on books and tapes in the form of promises hallelujah and we catch the promises all the preachers catch explanation interpretation all kind of crazy revelation but what we see is promises so when you come to church all you want to hear is what you promise you want to hear what your inheritance is you want to hear what you call on to you want to hear what you're here for what you must anoint what you must claim what you must pull down you know if you have a backing confusion and talking other people business you're not here for that i am not here for that we have to speak at the oracles of god oh glory to god when we speak we have to speak for god hallelujah look i will open my mouth to the escape ones oh give the lord a shout that's a promise you know hallelujah yes prophetic otter runs will go out to the escape ones hallelujah you wouldn't want to miss a service because you don't know what god wants to say you don't want god going to speak because god's going to speak by direct inspiration it's not just the quotes we are quoting here is the spirit of god coming i'm speaking to you because once more the world will hear direct from god oh glory god direct from god god speaking directly to you when you leave here you know god talk to you oh glory to god you get a direct word from the lord oh my my my my mind hallelujah so but he said i called you a long time ago before i found the world and god sent jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing i could do but inherit it there's nothing i can do but in the fullness of time god sent his own good time jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that i might go to my inheritance to be walked what inheritance the sonship to be a son of god not church member let's go with me a little bit right uh moses people children of israel gorge people pillar of fire they come out on its own right so go give them prophets they have the word they have the law from malachi to matthew hundreds of years no prophet here comes john the baptist repent by that time hundreds of years passed them fellas are tall hats long guns nice little twiddling beards nice tabernacles and temples and so on nice traditions and so on people respect them and whatnot here come a man not zechariah his name is johnny here come a man with camel skin blast and bring forth fruit me to repentance and blast in them the pharisees knew something happening because that behavior is out of sync with what they're custom with they say are you him are you the messiah should we look for another you see me i'm not me there's one standing among you whose shoes i'm not what if you're loose he gonna baptize you with the holy ghost on fire oh glory to god you under know who it is yet to god give him a sign upon whom you see the dove coming and resting and remaining that's the messiah jesus he is watching what's happening he had to wait for his time he can't come on the ball i ain't mess i'm jesus i am jesus everybody i'm jesus he can't introduce himself john has to introduce him a way has to be made for the messiah so jesus had to wait for john to start to preach and john the timing has to be just right and then all of a sudden the holy spirit tells jesus move now he's standing in line to be baptizing everybody else and john baptizen baptized him when you see jesus he said i said you should baptize me he said that might be so but it becomes us fulfill righteousness and john baptized him he said behold the lamb of god then the elect among john disciples stop following john and they start to follow jesus because they knew john was to introduce jesus john cena disciples but this guy is following jesus now because they know that the messiah oh glory to god what did jesus find another priest so-called fightful in them days the so-called custodians of the wood in those days they have the books they have the tips of the scrolls you follow i'm saying the caretakers they were taking the music scrolls after john got back jesus got baptized holy spirit again not man holy spirit led him into the wilderness you about lord is that you i've seen with this in front is that you i thought i was going i'm going on a platform and people would welcome me i thought i'd get up a lot of people shake my hand but is that really you yeah that is really you the holy spirit led him into the wilderness to overcome lucifer one-on-one private trial to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life to overcome himself because a lot of people they don't have the internal power self-discipline self-order conquering of self so that's why they multiply lose their they carry on because they don't have the eternal stuff so when jesus had that discipline look at this stone could turn into bread and say it is written this is written it's also written he overcame now the spirit come back upon him so here it is he baptized spirit on him when he hit the wilderness spirit off of him now he had to face the chest alone no help of faith this is written it is written he's doing that for you and me you don't need power to beat that devil you just need to know your word hallelujah it's written as written but i'm saying did that for you he did that for me that you could tell satan it is written it is written if you don't know it is written that's why you have to be in the word to know it is written oh give the lord a shout you have to know it is written you have to know it's in the word you have to study the word so when he come true and he come back over then he's speaking back upon him the bible called the power of the spirit so now you have a super anointing upon him he goes to the temple they say somebody wanted something we want somebody to read jesus put up his hands maybe the first time he went and read hallelujah then he had to find the scroll of isaiah isaiah okay then he's scrolling down now and finally and going down to the part where he marked the spirit of the law is upon me so they taught him reading scripture that's scripture this is the manifestation right now they thought he was reading that text they thought he quoting and he quoting he just quoted but he's himself he's quoting the spirit of the lord upon me because he anointed meter and when he finished finished reader he said this day the scripture is fulfilled in your air and he sat down close the book drama no start action no start hallelujah victorious vibrations from heaven oh glory to god he is now anointed he finds the scripture he is now commissioned he is ready to go out and heal the sick and raise the dead and give them scribe and pharisees and run for the money or give the lord a shout what you think that pride going to do anointed in commission find your scripture spirit is upon me oh glory to god hallelujah you are going to be with you you belong to them escape ones the escape bunch let me see like wrap up here i'm going to keep you alone hallelujah praise god this may choke me to death but they do know that men that are sons of god are amateur gods or this is beautiful men that are sons of god are amateur gods he didn't say men that are sons of god are preachers and teachers and explainers he's shown you that the inheritance is your sonship to be a son of god and the son of god rightly not church sun seven and pew son of god rightly is a mature god watch watch how many ever know how many know jesus said so did not the law say that you were gods watch in genesis 2 because they had full domain dominion of the world he gave the dominion of all things he lost his godship he lost his son ship he lost his domain satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time and then now he quantif he qualified the fullness of time as when the pyramid gets to the top so he showed it can't happen before time it have to come in the fullness of time when when the pyramid comes to the top watch watch watch watch when the pyramid gets to the top when the full sons of god will be manifested so let's have a timing in it do i hear amen this have a time in it when the pyramid gets to the top when the when the full sons of god will be manifested let's break down a little bit full sons when the power of god will walk out he will hallelujah and will take every power that satan's got away from him [Applause] that's why that's why jesus said you shall hear about wars and rumors of wars and kingdom rise against kingdom and earthquakes and diverse places he said the end is not yet but then he's qualified with this gospel must be preached not taught this is not taught now this is after all the teachings this gospel must be preached and then shall the end come nobody is coming to earn us without us preaching the gospel they're not ending us we have to we have to close the story or give the lord a shout let me say it again we have to close this story no manacles in this story the bride the escape ones we have to close this story then the end shall come my god my god remember this hangarly we have to close the story then the end shall come this gospel shall be preached if they're preached yet will press come in [Applause] oh glory to god the true church is in mark 16 in action that has to come you have to see a church but signs one of the miracles not a sign not a wonder not that signs plural wonders plural miracles plural power plural oh glory to god the lord himself not i try to explain you god no the lord himself i have to explain nothing the manifestation will be the interpretation of all the explanation oh give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] may be seated who who are the trump who are the violence who are the woes why did this who are the mystery of the destiny mystery that's a mystery all kind of mysteries and somehow the mystery power lacking and the prophecy is this the mystery of the thunders that will bring back a power into the church he said then when the thunder's come forth then you're worshiping the living christ him moving in and out among us they're not no preacher man there ain't no no pastor man that is christ the holy ghost moving in and out he can heal you tonight he can touch you sunday moving in and out he said then we are worshiping the living christ my god i can say so much things tonight oh glory to god hallelujah you know what what what defeat is you might be seated defeat is resurrection fate that is faith after jesus raised from the dead that's a different kind of faith that's not when he's walking among them you know we have to see christ among us manifesting himself we have the preaching the teaching this is a good word it isn't nice but this is not good enough we need a little more than this we need he himself to step out of this thing oh glory to god you have to see the living christ that's not me oh give the lord a serve [Applause] oh hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] moses wood could only bring them up to jordan up to the promised land then the joshua was take them over jesus could only bring them so far and no more all the teaching could only bring you so far and no more jesus himself couldn't cross them over he told them if i don't go the comforter will not come i've given you a word i've given you prophecy but i have to go the purpose i have to go is that the comfort of the goal will come oh glory to god the words that i speak their spirit and their life is not just word only or can the lord this gospel is nothing word only i'll preach until i die or up in the sky but this gospel is nothing more only oh god i want to see a living christ
