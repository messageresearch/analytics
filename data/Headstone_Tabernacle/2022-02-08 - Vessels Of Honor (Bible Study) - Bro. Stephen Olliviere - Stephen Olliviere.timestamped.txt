[12:30] you one more time
[12:31] amen in the name of jesus god bless you
[12:34] brother
[12:35] pastor
[12:36] and all of you here tonight we welcome
[12:38] you in a special way
[12:40] let's just turn to our bibles
[12:42] to second timothy chapter two if you
[12:45] have your bible tonight
[12:46] ii timothy chapter two
[12:49] verses 20 and 21. praise the name of the
[12:53] lord
[12:54] glory to god amen
[12:59] hallelujah
[13:02] amen so it goes like this
[13:06] but in a great house
[13:08] they are not only vessels of gold
[13:11] and of silver
[13:14] but also of wood
[13:16] and of earth
[13:18] some to honor and some to dishonor
[13:23] if a man therefore purge himself from
[13:25] these
[13:27] he shall be a vessel unto honor
[13:30] sanctified
[13:32] and meet for the master's use
[13:35] and prepared unto every good work
[13:38] praising of the lord
[13:40] blessed be the name of the lord
[13:42] amen so tonight
[13:44] the thought for this bible study is
[13:47] vessels of honor
[13:50] vessels are on
[13:52] let's look at the word vessel
[13:57] there are many different examples of how
[13:59] vessels can be used
[14:02] so a vessel
[14:04] for example can be a bull or a mug
[14:07] to hold water or food items
[14:10] or anything you may want to store
[14:15] you may have a blood vessel
[14:18] for example veins that are trees to
[14:20] transport blood throughout the body
[14:25] my sister benedict she's smiling
[14:28] there we may have a vessel could be a
[14:32] boat or ship
[14:34] to transport passengers or cargo from
[14:37] one place to another
[14:40] or it can be a person
[14:43] whom god calls and uses
[14:46] to do
[14:47] a job
[14:49] so what we observe in all these
[14:52] different examples
[14:53] of how the word vessel is used
[14:57] in each case
[14:58] we see the vessel is tied
[15:01] to our purpose
[15:02] somebody say purpose
[15:05] purpose
[15:06] in other words
[15:09] the vessel is used to achieve to achieve
[15:11] an objective
[15:13] so it has a specific use
[15:18] one hardly designs and makes and crafts
[15:21] any item
[15:22] without having a vision
[15:25] or specific plan or use in mind
[15:29] for the thing
[15:32] for example a pen
[15:34] is made to write with it has ink it is
[15:38] slender
[15:39] for the user to hold it
[15:41] a car
[15:42] is made to drive on the road it has
[15:44] tires
[15:46] there are seats for the passengers to
[15:47] sit on
[15:50] a house is made to live in different
[15:53] rooms and facilities for the inhabitants
[15:56] to occupy
[15:59] and anything you can think of
[16:01] that was carefully made
[16:04] is tied
[16:05] to a pulpers
[16:07] is tied to a vision
[16:10] of the manufacturer
[16:14] so again
[16:15] any vessel
[16:17] has a use
[16:19] it has a purpose
[16:21] for which
[16:22] it was created
[16:24] praise god
[16:26] a vessel must also have the ability to
[16:28] accommodate or hold
[16:30] or carry what it was made
[16:33] to contain
[16:35] it must be receptive
[16:36] amen
[16:38] okay so
[16:40] now what is honor
[16:44] honor means
[16:45] given high respect to
[16:49] great esteem
[16:51] admiration
[16:53] it also means uprightness and
[16:56] righteousness
[16:59] so when we say
[17:01] lord we give you all the honor
[17:04] we are saying
[17:05] lord we lift you high
[17:09] high above all others
[17:11] we are giving a special salute
[17:14] we are given great recognition
[17:17] and high adoration
[17:20] so putting the phrase together
[17:23] a vessel of honor
[17:25] what does it mean
[17:27] question
[17:31] in second timothy 2
[17:33] we read
[17:36] in a great house
[17:37] there are vessels of gold
[17:40] and silver
[17:42] wood
[17:43] and
[17:44] clay but over in
[17:47] second chronicles chapter 9 verse 20.
[17:51] you don't have to find it
[17:53] all the drinking vessels of king solomon
[17:57] were of gold
[18:01] so there are special vessels in a great
[18:03] house
[18:04] some esteem more highly than the others
[18:07] the golden vessels were only used for
[18:11] the king's
[18:12] drinking purposes
[18:15] but
[18:16] there were vessels some of wood
[18:18] some of clay
[18:21] note
[18:22] note
[18:24] there were vessels of honor
[18:27] and there were some vessels of this
[18:28] honor
[18:30] praise god so depending on the purpose
[18:33] for which it was created
[18:35] there is where the value lay
[18:40] and each vessel was made to achieve
[18:43] a specific purpose
[18:46] praise god
[18:48] but for this study tonight
[18:50] we will focus
[18:51] on the human vessels
[18:55] vessels that are created by god himself
[18:58] to achieve
[18:59] a desired purpose
[19:02] praise god amen so that was just an
[19:04] introduction and say praise the name of
[19:06] the lord
[19:07] so vessels of honor
[19:09] let's go
[19:12] so as a vessel of god
[19:14] we want to know lord
[19:18] what is it that you will have me
[19:21] to do
[19:23] what is your purpose for my life
[19:27] my analyze in fulfilling
[19:30] the purpose you have intended for me
[19:35] i want to do your will can we say amen
[19:37] tonight i want to do your will today
[19:39] amen
[19:41] i want to please you in every way
[19:45] help me to find my purpose
[19:48] and be the best that i can be
[19:51] there
[19:54] one time the prophet said
[19:56] if you are a bomb
[19:59] be the best bomb you can be
[20:02] dig in every dustbin
[20:04] look as dirty as you can be
[20:07] as smelly as you can be
[20:09] but just be the best bob can we say amen
[20:13] glory to god amen
[20:15] he said if you are a dormat in the house
[20:17] of god
[20:19] be the best donut
[20:22] be fluffy and comfortable and well
[20:24] padded
[20:25] so that when people
[20:27] wipe their feet they would feel good
[20:30] amen can we say amen
[20:32] praise the lord
[20:34] have you ever gone to pay a utility bill
[20:37] at an office
[20:39] and the customer rep
[20:40] is so unmanly and hostile that you feel
[20:44] to just still not walk out the building
[20:48] it's like but you are saving customers
[20:52] you are the feast to represent all that
[20:54] the company stands for
[20:57] and that is your best representation
[21:01] you are certainly a misfit
[21:05] you are in the wrong job
[21:08] maybe you need to go and grind iron or
[21:10] something
[21:11] the mean face might be appreciated there
[21:16] but the thing is
[21:18] are you achieving the purpose for which
[21:21] you were specially designed and created
[21:26] and one songwriter says
[21:28] you are a designer's original
[21:32] hallelujah
[21:33] so to speak amen you are unique
[21:37] you are
[21:38] a unique and special vessel
[21:41] unique special amen
[21:44] so god does not make halfway christians
[21:48] but a christian can be halfway
[21:52] and you don't want to be a halfway
[21:54] christian
[21:56] we've come too far just to be a halfway
[21:59] christian can we say amen today
[22:01] we don't want to be a happy christian
[22:05] so what is a vessel of honor
[22:09] a minister
[22:11] that is sanctified
[22:13] consecrated
[22:14] and set apart for that holy office
[22:19] now in the old testament brother isaac
[22:22] this was just for the priests
[22:25] but in the new testament
[22:27] when jesus ran the veil in two
[22:31] we all became royal priests
[22:34] so now
[22:36] who are the vessels of honor
[22:39] question
[22:43] and in second timothy 2 again verse 21
[22:47] if a man purges himself from these
[22:50] he shall be a vessel unto honor
[22:54] so three things
[22:56] one
[22:58] sanctified consecrated and set apart
[23:02] two
[23:04] fit or meet
[23:06] for the master's use
[23:10] and three
[23:11] prepare to do
[23:13] every good work
[23:15] so these are the requirements
[23:18] for a vessel of honor
[23:22] from the message earnestly contending
[23:23] for the faith
[23:25] sanctification
[23:27] note
[23:29] cleansed and set aside for service
[23:32] is not being
[23:34] in service
[23:36] let me say that again
[23:38] if you are cleansed and set aside for
[23:39] service
[23:41] that is not being
[23:42] in service
[23:44] that's just being sanctified
[23:47] he says
[23:49] blessed are they that hunger and this
[23:51] after righteousness for thee shall be
[23:54] filled
[23:55] glory
[23:56] the holy ghost comes in and fills up
[23:59] that vessel
[24:00] till it's running over
[24:02] till it's bubbling over
[24:04] and then you are in service of the lord
[24:07] can we say amen tonight glory to god
[24:10] thank you jesus
[24:12] so we get cleaned up or sanctified
[24:16] then we seek the holy ghost
[24:19] once we are filled
[24:21] now you are a christian as it will
[24:24] the journey has only just begun
[24:28] don't say you're ready to go
[24:30] after you get the holy ghost
[24:33] so don't say you're ready to go
[24:35] after you get the holy ghost
[24:37] then you make yourself into a christian
[24:40] it's praise god
[24:42] then you start to add and add and add
[24:45] and eat and grow and die and add
[24:50] then the more you dive
[24:53] the more you can add
[24:55] less of you and more of him
[24:58] fighting your way to perfection
[25:01] like the little lily at the bottom of
[25:03] the pond
[25:04] pushing up to get to the top
[25:07] all the way to perfection can we say
[25:09] amen
[25:10] praise god
[25:11] from the message the seal of god
[25:15] he says a vessel
[25:17] must first be broken up
[25:20] sorry must first be taken up
[25:22] full of mud
[25:24] so it's justified
[25:27] the man has picked it up
[25:30] the next thing is got to be cleansed and
[25:33] scored out
[25:35] sanctified
[25:37] cleansed and set aside for service
[25:40] set us again he says set aside does not
[25:43] mean you are in service
[25:48] the holy ghost comes in the sanctified
[25:50] real true
[25:52] sanctified believer
[25:56] as soon as the sanctified believer gets
[25:58] right
[26:00] the holy ghost got into it
[26:03] praise god
[26:05] praise god notice
[26:07] you can't bring oil out of a bottle
[26:10] unless there is oil in there
[26:13] no matter how clean the bottle is
[26:16] amen
[26:17] praise god
[26:19] so don't expect god to put that power
[26:22] in an unclean
[26:24] vessel
[26:26] and he's talking about the disciples
[26:28] he had to clean them up and give them a
[26:30] life of sincerity
[26:32] before he let them go out to preach
[26:35] praise god
[26:36] so once again the vessel is cleansed
[26:40] cleaned up
[26:41] it is ready to go in service to be used
[26:46] one songwriter says
[26:48] if you can use anything lord
[26:51] you can use me
[26:54] he is looking for vessels that are
[26:56] willing
[26:57] and able to be used
[27:00] praise god
[27:02] i'm born into the kingdom
[27:04] i'm booted in at the bottom of the
[27:06] pyramid
[27:08] and i'm growing closer daily
[27:12] climbing up the steps
[27:14] but yet
[27:16] yet
[27:18] there are things in me that need to be
[27:21] thrown out
[27:24] a death is required
[27:26] and paul said i die daily
[27:30] a total death to self
[27:33] is required
[27:36] we say i have the holy ghost
[27:39] but does the holy ghost
[27:41] have you
[27:42] that's jim
[27:45] is every emotion and that whole self
[27:48] in total subjection
[27:51] to the holy spirit
[27:55] you look fine you're a very nice person
[27:58] you treat everyone nice
[28:02] your earthen vessel is all polished up
[28:06] but god your maker
[28:09] your manufacturer
[28:12] demands more
[28:14] are you pleasing the designer
[28:17] are you pleasing the manufacturer
[28:22] you are good
[28:23] but a manufacturer wants perfection
[28:28] you are given 50. 75
[28:31] but can you give more
[28:35] what do i do
[28:37] and where
[28:39] can i go
[28:40] question
[28:44] where can we go tonight
[28:47] let's go down to the potter's house
[28:49] praise god let's go down to the potter's
[28:51] house glory to god
[28:53] and we go across you can write this one
[28:54] down jeremiah 18.
[28:57] this versus one to six
[28:59] remember
[29:00] preached a message on the potter's house
[29:02] some years ago
[29:03] jeremiah chapter 18 verses one to six
[29:10] the word which came to jeremiah saying
[29:13] arise and go down to the potter's house
[29:16] and there
[29:18] i will cause thee to hear my words
[29:22] then i jeremiah
[29:24] went down to the potter's house
[29:26] and behold
[29:28] he wrought a work
[29:30] on the wheels
[29:31] a potter is someone who makes pots out
[29:34] of clay
[29:36] verse 4
[29:37] and the
[29:38] vessel talking about vessels of honor
[29:41] tonight
[29:42] and the vessel that he made of clay was
[29:45] marred
[29:46] in the hand of the potter
[29:49] so he made it again another vessel
[29:52] a seemed good to the potter
[29:55] to make
[29:56] and was for any amplified
[29:58] but a vessel that he was making from
[30:00] clay was spoiled
[30:03] in the potter's hand
[30:05] so he made it over
[30:07] reworking it
[30:09] making it into another pot
[30:12] that seemed good
[30:13] to him
[30:16] verse 5
[30:18] then the word of the lord came to me
[30:19] saying
[30:22] o house of israel
[30:24] cannot i do with you as this potter
[30:28] saith the lord
[30:30] behold as the clay is in the potter's
[30:33] hand
[30:34] so are ye in my hand
[30:37] oh house of israel praise the name of
[30:40] the lord we stop right there
[30:43] and
[30:44] i decided to look up for the
[30:47] research on the process of making
[30:48] pottery and i found
[30:50] a simple one
[30:52] and the first step involves one
[30:55] sourcing the clay
[30:57] sourcing the clay
[30:59] you need to get the right mixture of
[31:01] clay
[31:02] to give the work character and texture
[31:06] and consistency
[31:08] so you must have the right type of clay
[31:11] two
[31:12] then you prepare the clay
[31:14] you mix and roll the clay to make it
[31:17] consistent
[31:19] and air bubble free
[31:21] you have to knead the clay with a slight
[31:24] rotation
[31:25] because this helps to push out any air
[31:27] bubbles within the clay
[31:31] air bubbles will cause issues
[31:34] when throwing the clay on the potter's
[31:37] wheel
[31:38] and if they remain in the clay
[31:41] during firing
[31:42] they can cause the clay body to break
[31:45] or even explode
[31:49] next step
[31:50] putting the clear on the wheel
[31:53] you want to form
[31:55] well
[31:55] formed vessels
[31:57] where the walls have an even thickness
[32:02] clay is attached to the wheel head
[32:04] and is shaped
[32:06] with the potter's hands
[32:08] or tools as it spins around
[32:12] after the pot is formed it is usually
[32:15] cut off the wheel
[32:16] to dry
[32:18] i mean uber and twine knows a lot about
[32:20] making pots
[32:22] and man god bless you rather than trying
[32:24] so on the potter's wheel
[32:27] is where you are shaped
[32:31] somebody says shape tonight
[32:33] shapes
[32:34] even on the potter's wheel
[32:36] so when you think of the potter's wheel
[32:39] you're thinking about
[32:40] the place where you are shaped
[32:43] praise god another step they call it
[32:45] bisque firing the pots are fired to make
[32:48] them more suitable for glazing
[32:51] and surface decorations
[32:53] then there's glazing a mixture of
[32:55] materials that when fired
[32:58] will melt
[32:59] and fuse into the clay
[33:01] usually creating a glassy surface
[33:05] it adds color and texture and
[33:07] functionality
[33:08] that's glazing
[33:10] then you have other decorations like
[33:12] putting images screen plate printing
[33:15] brush work
[33:16] carvings and so on can be done on the
[33:18] vessel
[33:20] finally
[33:21] firing
[33:22] the pot vessels are placed and
[33:24] maintained at high temperatures
[33:26] which can
[33:28] change clay and glaze
[33:30] into a permanent
[33:31] object
[33:33] amen so that kind of summarizes the
[33:35] stages
[33:36] in pottery making
[33:38] to some extent
[33:39] a very simple
[33:41] illusion
[33:44] but this scripture of jeremiah 18 1-6
[33:48] it shows how sometimes
[33:50] god uses things
[33:52] physical
[33:54] real situations and visible objects
[33:58] to convey a clear understanding of his
[34:01] mind and will for us
[34:04] amen
[34:06] and in the new testament he uses
[34:08] parables and stories to enlighten our
[34:11] understanding and to make us
[34:13] as christians see clearly
[34:16] how he feels and thinks
[34:20] he uses vessels of clay in the potter's
[34:23] hands
[34:25] he compares the potter to god
[34:29] and the clay vessel as human vessels
[34:32] so that's austenite
[34:35] it shows how the potter
[34:38] has power over the clay
[34:41] to mold it
[34:43] however he chooses to
[34:48] and this implies
[34:50] that god can do whatsoever he wants with
[34:53] us
[34:54] and will do whatsoever he wants
[34:58] to bring us to a place
[35:01] that he wants us to be
[35:03] can somebody say amen tonight
[35:05] hallelujah praise god
[35:07] a place of perfection
[35:10] a vessel of honor
[35:13] that he can use
[35:19] so god and
[35:20] god wanted to talk to jeremiah
[35:25] get up jeremiah
[35:27] arise
[35:29] i have a message to give you
[35:32] but i want you to see something first
[35:36] you must go down to the potter's house
[35:40] and there
[35:41] i will cause thee to understand fully
[35:47] then jerry buyer arose and went down to
[35:50] the potter's house
[35:52] and when he went there
[35:55] the potter was at the wheel shaping a
[35:59] vessel with his hands
[36:03] spinning the wheel
[36:04] and shaping the pot
[36:08] but then the potter was not pleased
[36:12] because the clear pot
[36:15] did not get the sheep he was trying to
[36:17] make
[36:20] the bible says it was marred in his hand
[36:24] in other words there was a flaw
[36:27] there was a fault in it
[36:31] it did not please
[36:33] the potter
[36:37] so as the amplified said
[36:39] the potter
[36:41] made it over
[36:43] reworking it
[36:45] and making it
[36:46] into another pot
[36:48] that pleased him
[36:50] or that seemed good to him
[36:53] can we give god a hand to praise tonight
[36:55] thank you jesus
[36:56] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[36:59] to god
[37:01] and right here
[37:03] is where we are at
[37:05] some of us
[37:07] on the potter's wheel
[37:10] being remolded
[37:13] being broken
[37:16] being remade
[37:18] being crushed
[37:21] because the potter god
[37:24] is only pleased with a perfect vessel
[37:30] a vessel of honor
[37:32] that is meet
[37:34] or fit
[37:35] for the master's use
[37:37] praise god
[37:40] if you are sanctified
[37:42] set aside
[37:44] that's good that's a requirement
[37:47] but now
[37:49] we must be fit
[37:50] for the master's use
[37:54] not how you like it
[37:57] or what looks good to you
[38:01] but what
[38:02] he demands of you
[38:05] which is a work of perfection
[38:07] amen
[38:08] praise god
[38:11] glory so from a message why are we not a
[38:14] denomination
[38:16] prophet says
[38:19] can the pot say to the potter
[38:21] you made me this
[38:24] you made me this
[38:27] who is on the wheel in other words who
[38:29] is in
[38:30] charge who has got the clay in his hands
[38:35] whose hands
[38:37] is it in
[38:39] hallelujah
[38:40] so we can't tell god
[38:42] how to shape us
[38:44] because we are in his hands
[38:48] we as clay
[38:50] must know how to yield ourselves to the
[38:54] touch
[38:55] of the potter's hand can we say amen
[38:58] tonight
[38:59] hallelujah
[39:00] hallelujah hallelujah
[39:03] praise god
[39:04] look at how the prophet
[39:06] says
[39:08] from the message witness
[39:11] he said the prophet jeremiah was going
[39:14] down to the potter's house
[39:16] to be broken up
[39:19] to be made over again the prophet
[39:22] himself jeremiah
[39:24] he says if there is no breaking up
[39:28] there is no making over
[39:30] can we say amen to that
[39:33] you have to be first
[39:36] broken up
[39:41] you have to break up your ground
[39:43] first
[39:45] tear it all to pieces
[39:48] then you can plant your seed
[39:51] and it will come forth
[39:53] let me see
[39:54] amen from the message
[39:57] why is it that so many christians find
[40:00] it so hard
[40:01] to live the christian life that's the
[40:03] name of the message
[40:06] he says thou art the potter
[40:10] i am the clay
[40:13] mold me and make me tonight
[40:16] this is this is the prophet not after
[40:18] some church creed
[40:22] but after
[40:23] thy will can we give him praise tonight
[40:26] just raise your hand wherever you are
[40:27] tonight
[40:28] oh praise god more last lord mold us
[40:30] lord we make us lord after i will
[40:33] tonight
[40:34] let seth be the name of the lord thank
[40:36] you jesus
[40:38] he said not after a church creed
[40:41] you don't want to be molded after church
[40:43] creed
[40:44] but after
[40:45] his will
[40:49] so not only did jeremiah get broken up
[40:52] himself
[40:55] because prophecy god took jeremiah down
[40:57] to be broken up
[41:00] but god gave the prophet a message
[41:03] to the
[41:04] people jeremiah chapter 18 verse 6 o
[41:08] house of israel
[41:11] can't i do with you as this potter said
[41:14] the lord
[41:16] behold
[41:17] as the clear is in the potter's hand
[41:21] so are you
[41:22] in my hand
[41:24] o house of israel
[41:28] see
[41:29] where we are located
[41:32] in the master's hand
[41:35] in the potter's hand
[41:38] being shaped
[41:39] be informed into a pyramid vessel as it
[41:42] were
[41:43] into a word image
[41:46] by the process of character formation
[41:50] seven deaths
[41:52] seven birds
[41:54] seven voices glory to god amen
[41:57] being turned
[41:59] and
[42:00] shaped and molded
[42:03] and cut into the stature of a perfect
[42:07] man
[42:08] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen
[42:12] and that's where we want to be that's
[42:13] what we want that's our goal amen oh let
[42:16] us go down to the potter's house tonight
[42:20] i have a message for you there
[42:22] i will show you something
[42:25] i'm forming a vessel of honor
[42:30] a vessel that is sanctified
[42:32] consecrated and set apart
[42:35] a vessel that is fit on meat
[42:38] for my use
[42:42] a vessel that is prepared
[42:44] onto every good work
[42:46] hallelujah praise god
[42:49] so how does he shape us
[42:52] amen i'm not going to be very very long
[42:54] praise god
[42:57] how does he shape us tonight
[42:59] how
[43:02] i see the clay on the physical wheel
[43:07] spinning
[43:08] and being shaped by the potter's hands
[43:13] but how does he shape
[43:15] the human vessel
[43:20] what is the potter's will
[43:23] to shape
[43:24] the human vessel
[43:29] how will he break me
[43:31] and mold me
[43:36] how will i know
[43:37] when he is shaping me
[43:40] hallelujah
[43:42] on the message god call man
[43:49] i hope i'm not too short tonight
[43:52] i'm not too loud
[43:59] that's the way god takes his men
[44:03] and beat out all their fears
[44:06] all their intellectual
[44:09] and the great master potter
[44:13] puts them on the weave
[44:15] and begins to mold them over again oh
[44:17] glory to god hallelujah the prophet has
[44:20] answered the question here from god call
[44:22] man let me see that one more time
[44:24] so the question was
[44:28] what is the potter's wheel
[44:31] to shape the human vessel i see the
[44:32] physical wheel for the physical clay
[44:36] but what is the potter's will to shape
[44:38] the human vessel
[44:40] how will he break me and mold me how
[44:44] will i know
[44:45] when he's shaping me
[44:48] so he says from god call man
[44:50] that's the way god takes his men and
[44:53] beats out all their fears
[44:55] all the intellectual and the great
[44:58] master potter puts them on the wheel and
[45:01] begins to mold them over again
[45:04] the workman worthy
[45:07] it's god's man
[45:10] who could train a man better than god
[45:13] himself
[45:14] hallelujah
[45:16] praise god watch the way he trains them
[45:19] god himself is training his men amen
[45:21] hallelujah shaping them on the potter's
[45:23] wheel
[45:25] so god
[45:26] shapes us
[45:28] take note of this
[45:31] god shapes us
[45:32] and removes us
[45:34] by training us
[45:37] by experiences
[45:41] by trials oh glory to god give the lord
[45:43] a praise tonight hallelujah hallelujah
[45:46] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[45:48] blessed be the name of the lord
[45:50] o praise god
[45:54] david
[45:57] he made devil david to be a vessel of
[46:00] honor
[46:02] but david had to go through
[46:05] rugged training
[46:09] david went through rugged training in
[46:12] god's school
[46:17] david was going to be a vessel of honor
[46:20] that god was going to use mightily
[46:24] god had a specific job for that vessel
[46:27] but david had to be trained
[46:30] and shaped
[46:31] and molded come on now hallelujah
[46:35] hallelujah
[46:38] don't feel that one day you will just be
[46:41] turned into a vessel of honor
[46:45] you have to go through the process
[46:50] you have to sit on the potter's wheel
[46:53] and be turned and shaped by the potter's
[46:57] hand
[46:59] you are his vessel
[47:02] not your own
[47:05] you are his vessel
[47:07] not your own vessel
[47:10] it is just you and the potter
[47:13] at the wheel
[47:15] of glory to god
[47:17] nobody else
[47:20] it's just you and the potter at the
[47:22] wheel
[47:25] notice
[47:27] david was led
[47:29] beside the still
[47:31] waters
[47:33] in other words that means
[47:36] he was alone brother himself
[47:43] david was on the backside of the desert
[47:48] that means
[47:49] he was not contaminated by the things of
[47:52] this world
[47:54] still in training
[47:56] glory
[47:59] david had experiences with the bay
[48:04] the lion
[48:06] so he learned how to be fearless
[48:10] how to be courageous
[48:13] he is being prepared for
[48:16] his specific purpose
[48:19] as a vessel
[48:21] as a chosen vessel
[48:23] for a specific purpose
[48:26] and the prophet said he cannot use you
[48:29] if you are afraid
[48:31] to take his word
[48:33] and believe him
[48:36] god cannot use you if you're afraid to
[48:38] take his word
[48:40] and to believe every word
[48:42] hallelujah
[48:43] trade in us
[48:44] glory to god amen
[48:48] so god elected david
[48:52] that specific vessel
[48:54] for a specific purpose
[48:57] he was a chosen vessel
[49:00] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[49:02] hallelujah hallelujah
[49:04] glory
[49:07] so tonight
[49:10] can we see our trials and tests
[49:14] as training
[49:16] in preparation for a greater purpose
[49:19] that the master potter has in his mind
[49:22] for us
[49:24] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[49:30] the trials
[49:32] paul said the trials or trials are more
[49:34] precious than gold tried in the fire
[49:39] can we change our mindset or the way
[49:42] that we look at our trials tonight
[49:47] one songwriter says
[49:49] lord i long to go higher with thee
[49:53] he said son
[49:56] you can't grow in this mountain
[50:01] so he picked out a valley for me
[50:06] and he leads me besides still waters
[50:10] somewhere in the valley below
[50:13] and he drove me aside
[50:15] to be tested and tried
[50:18] and there in the valley
[50:20] he restore it my soul hallelujah give
[50:22] the lord i had the praise tonight oh
[50:24] glory to god amen blessed be the name of
[50:27] the lord he restores our soul tonight oh
[50:31] praise god praise god praise god
[50:35] so is it that his child is his love for
[50:38] us training us shaping us
[50:42] glory so it's in the valleys
[50:47] where he trains us some i mean in other
[50:49] words in our low points then
[50:52] in our low areas
[50:54] it's in the valleys where he trains us
[50:57] on the backside of the desert
[51:01] moses in the wilderness
[51:04] rocks and deserts
[51:07] hard trials
[51:10] there he was cooled in
[51:13] character development
[51:15] preparing to be used as a vessel of
[51:19] honor for god
[51:23] and he had a specific job to do
[51:26] hallelujah hallelujah
[51:28] in the wilderness
[51:31] rocks and deserts falling down getting
[51:34] back up
[51:36] school
[51:37] in character development
[51:39] and the back side of the desert praise
[51:41] god amen
[51:44] he grew up as a nice prince
[51:47] of egypt
[51:50] but he had to get on that wheel
[51:55] to be remolded
[51:59] to be broken up
[52:01] to get all the intellectual from egypt
[52:05] out of him
[52:07] and become fit for the master's use
[52:12] a tool
[52:14] in god's hands oh glory to
[52:16] god
[52:18] a tool that will bring
[52:20] honor
[52:21] to god
[52:24] a vessel of honor
[52:26] is to be used by god
[52:29] for his glory
[52:31] and for his honor can we say amen
[52:33] tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[52:35] glory
[52:37] glory to god
[52:38] thank you lord thank you jesus
[52:42] from the message to the exodus
[52:45] prophet
[52:47] remember
[52:49] the pot
[52:50] must be broken into sheaves
[52:54] little pieces
[52:56] to be remolded
[52:57] and ground again
[53:01] this may look like a terrible thing to
[53:03] destroy it
[53:06] but it has to be done
[53:08] in order to get the pot remade
[53:12] again
[53:14] or the verse or whatever you are making
[53:17] it must be done
[53:22] from the message who do you say this is
[53:26] o foolish man
[53:29] can they clay say to the potter why make
[53:32] us meet us
[53:36] doesn't he have power to make one vessel
[53:38] to honor
[53:40] and another to this honor
[53:43] the potter
[53:45] yes he does
[53:48] yes
[53:49] you can only be
[53:52] what god
[53:54] made you
[53:57] he is the potter
[53:59] and we are the clay
[54:01] oh glory to god
[54:03] another place he says
[54:06] god is his prayer
[54:09] god
[54:11] make me what i ought to be
[54:15] i am the clay
[54:16] and you are the pot of lord amen can we
[54:18] say amen tonight
[54:20] that's our attitude tonight that's our
[54:22] disposition
[54:25] so i want to stress tonight that god can
[54:27] do what whatsoever he wants
[54:32] he can show mercy on whomsoever he
[54:35] chooses
[54:37] he is the potter
[54:42] hallelujah he is the father
[54:45] amen and from the message half this time
[54:49] glory
[54:51] this spot on this
[54:53] this this master potter he also likes
[54:56] variety
[54:58] and god has to display all of his
[55:01] attributes glory
[55:04] so he has to make one vessel of this
[55:06] honor
[55:07] and the other one to honor
[55:10] yeah why
[55:11] to show up the vessel of other
[55:14] amen
[55:16] glory so he makes one vessel of this
[55:18] honor

[55:44] he likes variety
[55:47] don't tell him how to make it and why to
[55:49] make it and when to make it he likes
[55:52] variety he makes us different
[55:54] the stars are different the angels are
[55:56] different they have some cherubims there

[56:00] amen he makes mountains he makes valleys
[56:03] he made plains and deserts and
[56:06] seas

[56:17] man give the lord a praise
[56:19] hallelujah glory
[56:22] glory
[56:23] thank you jesus
[56:25] continue from who do you say this is
[56:29] if he hadn't made night
[56:33] you would never appreciate the sunshine
[56:38] and if it was all sunshine
[56:40] you wouldn't know how to appreciate it
[56:44] see
[56:46] he said if there was no sickness
[56:49] you could never appreciate good health
[56:56] they are good people and they are evil
[56:58] people
[57:00] god made one
[57:02] to be dishonorable
[57:04] to show up the honorable one
[57:06] is just a law of contrast
[57:12] so god is the master
[57:15] and he can do whatsoever pleases him i'm
[57:18] just trying to underscore that tonight
[57:21] he is the potter tonight
[57:24] and we are just play
[57:27] in his hand
[57:31] you can't have a bogus dollar
[57:33] until there is first
[57:35] a real level
[57:38] there is no sin
[57:40] unless there was righteousness first
[57:44] there is no lie
[57:46] until there's truth first
[57:51] there are two systems
[57:54] one the right system
[57:56] which is god's word
[57:58] and two the perverted system
[58:01] which is denomination
[58:04] but god is the master
[58:07] and he uses the law of contrast
[58:11] he is
[58:13] suffering
[58:14] hallelujah give me a lot of hand to pray
[58:16] god is talking tonight i'll don't try to
[58:18] bind him don't try to fix him won't try
[58:20] to box him praise god hallelujah he's
[58:23] bigger than
[58:24] our mind he's bigger than this universe
[58:26] amen
[58:28] glory
[58:31] okay it's nine o'clock so to break it up
[58:33] close a bit i'm not available
[58:52] a powerful word
[58:55] i'll say that one more time
[58:57] we have vessels on the potter's will be
[58:59] in shape and prepared
[59:01] for a short quick quick work powerful
[59:06] a bride being prepared
[59:09] being shaped
[59:11] a chosen people
[59:14] chosen vessels
[59:17] hallelujah
[59:19] cutting out all the world
[59:22] cutting out cutting out all of self
[59:27] baking out all the greenness because
[59:29] part of the pottery making process is
[59:31] the firing
[59:33] bacon
[59:34] there's a bacon part of it
[59:36] burning also with the fire of god
[59:38] burning out
[59:40] with the hard trials burning out all the
[59:42] greediest
[59:46] if we don't come out right
[59:49] on the spot as we
[59:51] guess what
[59:54] he will crush us over
[59:56] and remake us
[59:58] until we come out right
[1:00:01] because he will only have perfection
[1:00:03] hallelujah
[1:00:04] glory
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:07] so if we don't come out right he will
[1:00:09] crush us over
[1:00:11] and remake us
[1:00:13] until we come out right
[1:00:17] righteousness
[1:00:18] vessel of honor
[1:00:20] if it takes seven deaths he will do it
[1:00:24] glory glory glory
[1:00:26] and when we are fully prepared
[1:00:30] all baked out
[1:00:33] then we will stand
[1:00:35] as empty
[1:00:37] earthen vessels
[1:00:39] we tend to be refilled
[1:00:42] ready for the master's use
[1:00:46] ready for that
[1:00:47] powerful
[1:00:48] short quick powerful work praise god
[1:00:50] amen
[1:00:53] rory
[1:00:55] and you know i was thinking
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:58] if it is
[1:01:01] that the only group
[1:01:04] that will make it
[1:01:06] on the other side
[1:01:08] it's not this church or that church or
[1:01:11] this group of people but the only group
[1:01:13] that will make it on the other side
[1:01:15] is a group of overcomers
[1:01:19] the prophet said
[1:01:21] and
[1:01:22] then god must give us trials and tests
[1:01:26] to overcome
[1:01:29] so what are you going to overcome
[1:01:31] if you say you are an overcomer
[1:01:34] god of necessity
[1:01:37] must give us trials and tests to
[1:01:40] overcome
[1:01:43] and to learn how to overcome ourselves
[1:01:50] i wonder if we could on the line in red
[1:01:51] if you're writing on the line overcome
[1:01:53] ourselves in red
[1:01:55] and circle it and highlight it and stick
[1:01:57] it up on the wall
[1:01:59] overcome ourselves that's a real
[1:02:02] important part of the process
[1:02:06] because once we can't overcome ourselves
[1:02:09] then
[1:02:10] we are as clear
[1:02:12] yielded in the master's hands
[1:02:15] hallelujah
[1:02:17] glory
[1:02:19] not my will
[1:02:21] lord
[1:02:22] but thine
[1:02:24] you are not fighting up anymore with
[1:02:26] what he wants do whatsoever pleases you
[1:02:30] i am just a lump of clay in your hands
[1:02:35] tonight hallelujah praise god praise god
[1:02:38] praise god
[1:02:40] make me a vessel of honor
[1:02:44] a vessel that you can use
[1:02:48] to bring honor to your name
[1:02:53] because the vessel only gets its honor
[1:02:57] from its purpose that is saving
[1:03:01] that's where the value lies
[1:03:03] solomon
[1:03:04] vessel the golden vessel
[1:03:07] was the one that the king drank from
[1:03:10] and those are the ones that were
[1:03:11] prestigious
[1:03:12] in the king's house in the great house
[1:03:16] because of the purpose it was fulfilling
[1:03:19] make me a vessel of honor
[1:03:22] a vessel that you can use
[1:03:25] to bring honor to your name

[1:08:37] words but here truth and we heard the
[1:08:39] truth tonight lord a call to be under
[1:08:42] potter's wheel that is where he calls to
[1:08:44] places and father sometimes things
[1:08:46] happen and we can't explain it like the
[1:08:49] winds blowing contrary this happening
[1:08:51] and that happening but here we have a
[1:08:53] word from you the vessel was
[1:08:56] uh prepared and
[1:08:57] and the purpose was channeled and i saw
[1:09:00] love what was here tonight that is
[1:09:02] connected to our purpose our lives
[1:09:05] are connected
[1:09:06] to purpose and if we are not fulfilling

[1:09:11] vessel about what what are we here for
[1:09:13] so lord i thank you that the word is
[1:09:15] becoming clearer and clearer as to what
[1:09:18] you call us unto father vessels of honor
[1:09:21] and the vessels of honor can only be
[1:09:24] truly identified
[1:09:26] as honor when it is served in your
[1:09:28] purpose or we thank you for this end
[1:09:31] time because your prophet taught us
[1:09:33] that a lot of people millions and
[1:09:35] millions of people will be atomic father
[1:09:39] they'll be just material
[1:09:40] where the atomic bombs begin to fall
[1:09:43] that their bodies will be dissolved and
[1:09:46] destroyed
[1:09:47] atomic further but amidst all this
[1:09:50] darkness that cover in the earth and
[1:09:52] gross darkness covering the people you
[1:09:54] call out a people for your name seek my
[1:09:57] baptism not matter this not pentecostal
[1:10:00] not your witness but a people for your
[1:10:03] name say we believe that a bunch of
[1:10:05] these peoples got here tonight we
[1:10:07] believe you're calling us to accept this
[1:10:10] purpose of god
[1:10:12] jesus in the beginning of his ministry
[1:10:14] father
[1:10:14] he was healing the sick and the cast now
[1:10:17] devils and doing miracles and
[1:10:19] multiplying bread and fish and all of
[1:10:21] that was just
[1:10:22] a channel a road a pathway to his real
[1:10:26] purpose
[1:10:28] when he got down to garden of gethsemane
[1:10:30] when he began to pray if it's possible
[1:10:33] let this cup pass
[1:10:34] i guess and i believe
[1:10:36] that it was a group experience for him
[1:10:38] to graduate from the first stage when he
[1:10:41] said the spirit is upon me to hit to the
[1:10:43] garden of gethsemane when he knew it's
[1:10:45] all over
[1:10:46] no more signs
[1:10:48] no more wonders that he's gonna do no
[1:10:51] more
[1:10:52] breaking bread and fish and multiplying
[1:10:53] it
[1:10:54] it was the cross
[1:10:56] that was in front of him at some point
[1:10:58] in time lord after all the bubble
[1:11:00] dancing after all the rejoicing after
[1:11:03] all the jesus is so sweet after all of
[1:11:05] that we have to come down to our own
[1:11:08] garden of gethsemane where before us
[1:11:11] lays the cross
[1:11:12] and jesus himself didn't run into the
[1:11:14] cross he said father if it's possible
[1:11:16] let this compass and he's it's a
[1:11:18] reflection of all of us that when we
[1:11:21] come down to that hour we're going to
[1:11:23] ask if is there another way is there a
[1:11:25] different way for character formation is
[1:11:28] there a different way they're almost so
[1:11:30] much catch phrases of too blessed to be
[1:11:32] stressed and all kind of a cuckoo things
[1:11:35] that people have in their own mind and
[1:11:37] yet every prophet every siege every wise
[1:11:40] man every man of god that you have truly
[1:11:42] called there's only one process which is
[1:11:46] the potter's wheel where you take your
[1:11:48] break you reshape your mold you reset
[1:11:52] your repurpose father me each individual
[1:11:55] here tonight
[1:11:56] find
[1:11:57] the right spot that right fit
[1:12:00] someone was saying today that if you
[1:12:03] take a one-year-old child and give them
[1:12:06] a five-year-old shoes until i'm going
[1:12:07] around they may lose the shoes and maybe
[1:12:10] fall down because it's it's not a fit
[1:12:12] it has to fit
[1:12:14] just right and every vessel
[1:12:17] has to fit
[1:12:18] just right for the purpose it was
[1:12:21] created for each one of us are different
[1:12:23] called the different purpose and things
[1:12:26] but we want to yield ourselves to you
[1:12:28] father we want
[1:12:29] to be truly purged because that was the
[1:12:31] conditionality that was placed if
[1:12:34] a man
[1:12:35] push himself he shall be
[1:12:37] a vessel of honor you have left
[1:12:39] something for us to do to clean up to
[1:12:42] get it right to give up to let go to
[1:12:44] walk away from to cut off
[1:12:47] all these things are things that we can
[1:12:49] do and that is what the mechanics is all
[1:12:51] about to do all that we can do in the
[1:12:54] questions tonight have we done all that
[1:12:56] we can do for you to do the rest just
[1:12:59] like it said if we could only get
[1:13:01] started god will do the rest may this be
[1:13:03] a starting point tonight may this be an
[1:13:05] anchor point tonight would this be a
[1:13:08] moving uh a place that we could look
[1:13:10] back and say you know what i have
[1:13:11] accepted that i'm a vessel of god i am
[1:13:15] accepted that i'm called to be a temple
[1:13:17] of god and i want to be a vessel of
[1:13:19] honor not just a vessel because a vessel
[1:13:22] could be used
[1:13:23] for different purpose but i want to be a
