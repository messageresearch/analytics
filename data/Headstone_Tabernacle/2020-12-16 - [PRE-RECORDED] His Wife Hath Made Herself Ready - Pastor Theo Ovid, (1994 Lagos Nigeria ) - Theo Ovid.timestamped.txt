[14:44] [Applause]
[14:51] something about the
[14:54] final service i'm not much of a talker
[14:59] this part but on behalf of my wife since
[15:02] ameri and myself i would like to express
[15:04] my gratitude
[15:05] to you the believers in nigeria
[15:08] and to thank you the host pastor by the
[15:11] ulu
[15:12] and the lagos church for the hospitality
[15:15] and the invitation to come
[15:18] and i know
[15:28] and i know that if the meeting will
[15:30] close now it would have been voted all
[15:32] i want to appreciate all the pastors and
[15:35] the churches
[15:36] for coming out to the meetings and i
[15:39] know
[15:39] that and i believe in my heart it will
[15:42] be a blessing and has been a blessing to
[15:44] all the believers
[15:45] from the east and the west and the north
[15:48] and the south
[15:53] and to me i believe is just a food of
[15:56] indication
[15:57] that the seventh seed is broke
[16:05] because when the seventh seal broke
[16:07] there was silence on the devil they knew
[16:09] nothing about it
[16:10] but listen to what the prophet said in a
[16:12] message called influence 1963
[16:15] he said what we have seen happen shall
[16:18] put every soul in action
[16:20] it should make a church that would make
[16:22] a revival here in phoenix
[16:25] that people will be flying in from
[16:26] europe to see what's taking place
[16:28] they will say there's a place in arizona
[16:30] called maricopa valley
[16:32] a city called phoenix there is something
[16:34] broke out there until the seven thunders
[16:37] of revelation 10
[16:38] that's not even written in the bible is
[16:40] being manifested
[16:42] you mean the thunders is to be
[16:48] manifested
[16:51] amen so truly we are
[16:54] happy to be here and we know that uh
[16:58] that if we don't see each other on this
[17:00] side we will meet in the morning
[17:02] but we will meet amen
[17:05] so go we stand because we
[17:09] want to turn our bibles to matthew 25
[17:12] revelation 19 and revelation 21 for
[17:16] scripture reading tonight
[17:17] praise god the miracle of the
[17:20] transforming power of the word seed in
[17:22] you
[17:23] what a message this morning to know that
[17:25] everything is in that sea
[17:27] and that seed is inside of you the
[17:30] miracle is inside that seed inside of
[17:31] you
[17:32] so one soul another reap but god gave
[17:35] the increase
[17:36] so maybe that miracle could come out
[17:37] tonight oh praise be to jesus
[17:41] because you already identified this
[17:42] morning that that miracle is in that
[17:44] seed amen
[17:45] so reading from matthew 25
[17:55] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[17:56] lightened unto ten virgins
[17:58] which took their lamps and went forth to
[18:00] meet the bridegroom
[18:02] five of them were wise and five are
[18:03] foolish they that were foolish took
[18:06] their lamps and took no oil with them
[18:08] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[18:10] with their lambs
[18:12] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[18:14] slumbered and slipped
[18:15] and at midnight there was a cry made
[18:18] behold the bragging comet go yell to
[18:21] meet him
[18:22] then all those virgins arose and trim
[18:24] their lamps
[18:25] and the fool is said unto the wise give
[18:27] us of your oil
[18:28] for our lambs are gone out but the wise
[18:31] answered saying not so
[18:33] at least there not be enough for us and
[18:35] you
[18:36] but go he rather to them that sell and
[18:39] buy for yourselves
[18:40] and while they went to buy the
[18:42] bridegroom came
[18:44] and they that were ready went in with
[18:47] him
[18:48] to the marriage and the door was shut
[18:52] afterward came the other virgin saying
[18:54] lord lord open to us
[18:56] but he answered and said verily i said
[18:58] to you i know you not
[19:00] watch therefore for you know neither the
[19:02] dean or the hour
[19:03] wherein the son of man cometh reading
[19:06] from revelation 19.
[19:12] reading from verse 5
[19:15] and the voice came out of the throne
[19:17] saying praise our god all your servants
[19:20] i needed fame both small and great and i
[19:22] heard as it were the voice of a great
[19:24] multitude
[19:25] and as a voice of many waters and as the
[19:27] voice of mighty thunder and saying
[19:29] hallelujah
[19:30] for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let
[19:33] us be glad and rejoice
[19:35] and give honor to him for the marriage

[19:42] her was granted that she should be
[19:43] arraigned and finally clean and white

[19:47] the saints and he said unto me
[19:49] right blessed the day which are called
[19:52] unto the marriage supper of the lamb
[19:53] and he say unto me these are the true
[19:55] saiyans of god
[19:57] revelation 21 1 verse 9
[20:03] and they came unto me one of the seven
[20:05] angels which had the seven

[37:07] man she has a fear with him and to come
[37:09] back to her husband he should kick her
[37:10] out and so forth
[37:11] he said but the bride of christ is vowed
[37:15] to christ
[37:16] and he is the word not even a wink
[37:20] at the other side
[37:23] in other words this bride must even wink
[37:26] at the interpretation

[37:45] [Applause]
[37:46] oh my god you may be seated
[37:49] blessed be the name of the lord
[37:52] hallelujah
[37:54] notice
[37:57] a very strange thing in this age of
[37:59] grace
[38:02] when god has taken a people for his
[38:03] name's sake
[38:05] that is his pride in this evil aid that
[38:09] should be called the age of evil the
[38:11] very age that god is calling
[38:14] a people for his namesake by grace
[38:17] and it's an evil age very strange to
[38:20] think of that
[38:21] that in an evil age like this
[38:24] that god then would be calling his bride
[38:29] did you notice he said a people not a
[38:32] church
[38:36] so anytime somebody say my church better
[38:38] than your church
[38:39] forget it
[38:52] you are free christopher liberto you are
[38:55] free
[38:56] christ is your liberty grace is your
[38:58] freedom
[39:10] [Music]
[39:14] you're gonna be sick
[39:32] but did you notice he said a people not
[39:34] a church why
[39:35] yet it's called the church but he would
[39:38] call up people
[39:39] now a church is a gathering of many
[39:42] people of all different makeups
[39:45] but god is calling one here
[39:49] he didn't say i will call the methodist
[39:51] the baptist or the pentecostal
[39:54] he said he will call a people what for
[39:57] for his name
[39:58] a people one from the methodist
[40:04] one from the baptist
[40:06] [Applause]
[40:07] one from the lutheran one from the
[40:10] catholic
[40:11] but he is calling not a church group
[40:15] but a people
[40:19] so no man have any right
[40:23] to find the people of god let them go
[40:35] and i mean it praise god
[40:38] i am serving a summons to every pharaoh
[40:41] in nigeria
[40:43] hallelujah glory to god the enforcer is
[40:47] here
[40:47] the holy spirit is here the angel is
[40:50] here
[40:51] let my people go
[41:06] [Applause]
[41:15] [Music]
[41:18] oh
[41:21] playing game is over the shock is
[41:24] dead the seat is dead right
[41:27] and nothing happens you heard that this
[41:29] morning outside the sea
[41:32] term
[41:43] oh hallelujah one of these days only the
[41:46] bride will walk him with life
[41:49] all the life of the shock will be guided
[41:50] up in the brain and the pride will be
[41:52] the talking on the earth
[41:54] [Applause]
[41:56] the pride will be the final voice on the
[41:58] earth
[41:58] [Applause]
[42:01] if anybody want to talk to god god but
[42:02] say talk to my wife
[42:10] hallelujah if she say hired you're hired
[42:13] if you're fired you are tired my voice
[42:16] isn't hurt
[42:22] oh my i feel good
[42:25] oh hallelujah something is moving
[42:28] glory to god oh hallelujah
[42:32] before the fall adam didn't have to use
[42:35] jesus name
[42:40] adam said tree move mountain move
[42:43] he didn't have to use jesus name and the
[42:46] pride
[42:47] oh hallelujah when she come one
[42:50] with the reveal word the mate she don't
[42:53] even have to use jesus said
[42:55] if you shall say and don't tell
[42:58] you're gonna have what you say how's
[43:01] that how i arrive
[43:02] the church should be in speaking
[43:03] conditions with god
[43:12] oh glory to god oh my god
[43:33] oh man he's calling another church group
[43:37] about the people for his name that
[43:40] receives his name
[43:42] engaged in his name going to a wedding
[43:45] to be married to him
[43:47] to become part of him by predestination
[43:51] just as a man that chooses a right wife
[43:53] in life
[43:54] was ordained to be part of his body so
[43:57] the bride of christ will be
[43:59] and is now from all ordained by god
[44:04] to be part of that body
[44:08] so it is not a church here a church
[44:10] there
[44:11] there is one body
[44:18] that is why you hear so much about
[44:20] ephesians
[44:21] because there is one law and he is the
[44:24] head of that body
[44:25] [Applause]
[44:28] and if the head moves so and the body
[44:29] moves so something is wrong
[44:32] because my head move my body is going
[44:39] because the body and the head is
[44:41] connected together my body is moving one
[44:43] way and the head moving the next way
[44:45] wherever my head move my body is moving
[44:51] and when jesus become the headship over
[44:54] the bride's body
[44:56] oh hallelujah every move is thus saith
[44:58] the lord
[45:12] you maybe see know this
[45:17] what someone call what what not not what
[45:19] someone called
[45:21] but what god chose before the foundation
[45:25] of the world
[45:25] [Music]
[45:26] [Applause]
[45:27] and in these days he's calling not an
[45:29] organization
[45:31] a people for his name and this
[45:34] evil age is when he's doing it the very
[45:37] age of deception
[45:40] and matthew 224 it was the most
[45:41] deceiving age of all ages all ages of
[45:43] his seat
[45:44] watch from the garden of eden all the
[45:46] way down
[45:47] there has never been an age so deceptive
[45:51] as they say false prophets with rights
[45:56] show signs and wonders if possible to
[45:59] deceive the very lit
[46:01] just a coal formal statue churches
[46:05] so forth of manthology wouldn't the
[46:07] elect would never pay no attention to
[46:08] that
[46:09] but it's up there almost like the real
[46:12] thing
[46:13] just leaving out one word
[46:16] is all you have to do not two words
[46:20] just one that's why the pride will be
[46:24] wrapped
[46:25] in the kong of his promised word nothing
[46:28] will be left out
[46:29] [Applause]
[46:31] [Music]
[46:35] you may be seated what would god call a
[46:39] people out of this evil age for
[46:41] his name you want to hear why
[46:47] the reason it is is to try here
[46:56] [Applause]
[47:00] no i can't expect that i don't expect a
[47:03] show for that one
[47:05] but it's still the word you mean he
[47:07] called the people of the trial
[47:09] yes you want to prove to the devil that
[47:12] this spread is not like you
[47:15] she can face the test anywhere
[47:19] anytime any place on any condition
[47:22] she will stand
[47:34] are you with me oh glory to god
[47:48] oh my god hallelujah oh praise be to
[47:53] jesus
[48:00] you may be seated we find out
[48:04] this evil age is to prove the satan but
[48:07] like eve
[48:08] she is not that type of a woman she will
[48:11] be
[48:12] tried by his word oh my
[48:15] the bride watch uh
[48:19] she will be tried by his word the bride
[48:21] as adam's bride was tried by the word
[48:23] adam's bride believed every bit of the
[48:25] word but was confused on one promise
[48:29] that he was the same yesterday then
[48:31] forever but failed on one promise
[48:34] under the temptation of the enemy face
[48:36] to face
[48:37] and now the people that is called for
[48:39] his name of course
[48:41] is his bride she is to come in contact
[48:44] with the same team
[48:51] you mean that's why not being so rough
[48:53] over the years
[48:54] of course if you went to the angel
[48:58] and you took the book it's supposed to
[49:00] be sweet in the mouth
[49:02] and it's supposed to be bitter in the
[49:03] belly so what you're complaining about
[49:08] [Music]
[49:11] we're talking about wife of the lamb
[49:16] [Music]
[49:18] [Applause]
[49:28] hallelujah
[49:30] oh glory hallelujah
[49:34] you may be seated now watch for my
[49:36] message
[49:38] only one true living church 1951 he said
[49:40] the gospel commonly believed
[49:43] is the word of god now that is true in
[49:45] one sense
[49:46] but the word of god is not gospel alone
[49:49] amen the word of god is the seed
[49:52] that produces the gospel
[49:58] but jesus said i saw went forth to sew
[50:01] some fell in stone
[50:02] places some fell on the way side falls
[50:04] of the eddy of all them some fell upon
[50:05] twenty tissues
[50:06] ground some went over brought a
[50:08] hundredfold now the seed you people here
[50:10] were farmers every single produce of its
[50:13] in the right kind of ground and every
[50:16] divine promise of god
[50:20] in the bible will produce if it's met in
[50:24] the right kind of our heart
[50:26] it will produce the promise
[50:32] but watch not the right kind of a head
[50:37] the right kind of a heart
[50:41] so the ground has to be prepared

[51:39] commit it to the earth let it alone
[51:42] it's up to nature god to water it and
[51:44] the seed it produces

[51:48] god
[51:49] accept it in good heart already

[54:08] according to the scripture the great sin
[54:10] paul said the gospel comes nothing will

[56:07] seed
[56:07] or it will rot or it won't do no good it
[56:10] will perish
[56:11] but if it got the seed in the ground the
[56:14] right ground with the right kind of a
[56:15] sunlight on it
[56:16] it's got to ripen and he promised that
[56:18] in the last days
[56:19] in the evening time the sun would come
[56:21] up to right in that seed
[56:23] the seed is being preached

[58:40] god

[59:46] every small town small village small hot
[59:48] revelation
[59:49] going to disappear god is bigger than

[1:00:35] wedding with a hard face
[1:00:38] it's only if they want to be the
[1:00:39] bragging on the bride
[1:00:44] but it's a rejoicing time
[1:00:48] to know all things are ready oh
[1:00:50] hallelujah
[1:00:51] praise god amen so what do you think the
[1:00:54] thunder was sent for to gather the
[1:00:56] bright together
[1:00:57] the shore hope to be pure

[1:01:12] it wasn't for that
[1:01:25] oh hallelujah court is not going to stop
[1:01:28] the devil
[1:01:29] it will take a revelation oh you know
[1:01:32] what i said
[1:01:33] quoting wouldn't stop the devil
[1:01:38] because those guys that jonathan spoke
[1:01:40] about said uh come out in the name of
[1:01:42] the jesus that paul preached
[1:01:45] it was caught into
[1:01:50] and those devils say paul i know peter i
[1:01:53] know too
[1:01:54] because they kicked me out when we were
[1:01:57] up there
[1:01:58] and they're doing the same thing down
[1:02:00] here but i don't know who you are
[1:02:08] i'm not ever going to know the pride oh
[1:02:11] hallelujah how
[1:02:12] she gonna do the very same works same

[1:02:28] i tell you praise
[1:02:32] oh god hallelujah
[1:02:36] glory to god
[1:02:40] hallelujah
[1:02:46] oh my seated oh hallelujah are we almost
[1:02:49] there
[1:02:50] from ephesian church agents daniel heard
[1:02:51] the seven thunders
[1:02:53] unforbidden and john heard the voices
[1:02:55] and this book was sealed
[1:02:57] and the back of the book was sealed with
[1:02:58] seven seals but in the days of these
[1:03:00] seals to be opened the mystery of god
[1:03:02] shall be finished
[1:03:03] in other words god would be known into
[1:03:05] his church
[1:03:06] not in three persons but as one person
[1:03:10] the mystery of god would be revealed and
[1:03:12] when that was completely revealed
[1:03:14] then the seven mystery be open to the
[1:03:16] church because in deer
[1:03:18] the church would be living under the
[1:03:20] inspiration
[1:03:22] of the holy spirit him moving in and out
[1:03:25] and showing his signs of being alive
[1:03:28] living among us and then we are
[1:03:30] worshiping the living christ
[1:03:44] know every revival you maybe see every
[1:03:45] fire produces twins
[1:03:48] [Applause]
[1:03:54] every fiverr produces twins
[1:03:58] [Music]
[1:04:06] good books and deeds and esau was a
[1:04:09] probably a better
[1:04:10] a boy that if he interchanged
[1:04:13] then uh jacob what
[1:04:16] but you see the natural man when a
[1:04:19] revival comes there's two classes of
[1:04:20] people
[1:04:21] comes out of every revival there's a
[1:04:23] natural man goes and he will come the
[1:04:25] old say yes accept christ as my savior
[1:04:26] he will go out
[1:04:28] first thing he'll wind up in some cool
[1:04:30] formal church because he thinks well if
[1:04:31] i join the church
[1:04:32] i'm just as good as the next man
[1:04:36] am i not just as good as so and so what
[1:04:39] difference
[1:04:40] does it make as long as i belong to the
[1:04:41] church
[1:04:43] why it's a whole lot of difference you
[1:04:45] have got to be born again you have got
[1:04:54] to have the
[1:04:55] birthright now a lot of people don't
[1:04:58] want to get the birthright because the
[1:04:59] thing
[1:05:00] is just a little unpopular they don't
[1:05:02] want to get down at the altar
[1:05:03] and cry a little bit miss a few meals
[1:05:07] they don't want to cry they don't want
[1:05:09] the new bird
[1:05:10] because the new birth is kind of messy
[1:05:12] it's like any other bird is a mess
[1:05:14] and so the new word is a mess it will
[1:05:17] make you do things that intake you will
[1:05:18] do
[1:05:19] it will make you sound a corner and beat
[1:05:21] the tamarind and sing glory be to god
[1:05:23] hallelujah praise god
[1:05:24] you would act like a maniac oh
[1:05:27] hallelujah
[1:05:28] now unless anything dies and rot life
[1:05:30] can't come from it
[1:05:32] unless a man dies and rots in his own
[1:05:34] thoughts christ cannot get into his
[1:05:37] heart
[1:05:37] and when you are trying to think for
[1:05:39] yourself now if i walk up to the altar
[1:05:41] and say
[1:05:42] yes lord i'm a fine fellow i will take
[1:05:44] you i will pay tights i will do this
[1:05:46] you gotta die and rot right there to
[1:05:50] your torch
[1:05:51] let the holy ghost take over and just do
[1:05:53] whatever he wants to do with you
[1:05:56] oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:05:58] lord
[1:06:01] oh hallelujah glory
[1:06:04] all right god you may be seated from the
[1:06:07] titan to a church
[1:06:08] how about the clothes
[1:06:19] i'm about to open back
[1:06:32] amen will you remember seated from titan
[1:06:35] age he said i know you're fake
[1:06:37] no he doesn't say here he did to the
[1:06:38] church in pergamos you hold my faith
[1:06:41] he's talking about his faith now but he
[1:06:43] is commending them
[1:06:45] for their faithfulness as he does he
[1:06:47] also mentioned their patience
[1:06:49] now faithfulness and patience go
[1:06:51] together in fact
[1:06:52] patience is the outcome of faithfulness
[1:06:54] for it says in james 1
[1:06:56] 3 the trying of your fate work a patient
[1:07:00] there is absolutely no other way in
[1:07:03] which to gain patience
[1:07:05] it has to come by the trial of our faith
[1:07:09] tribulation work at patience how highly
[1:07:13] god regard this outworking of our
[1:07:15] patients
[1:07:16] as seen in james 1 4 but let patience
[1:07:18] have a perfect work
[1:07:20] that he may be perfect an entire
[1:07:23] lack in nothing god's will for us is
[1:07:26] perfection
[1:07:28] and that perfection is patience waiting
[1:07:31] on god
[1:07:32] and waiting for god this is the process
[1:07:36] of character development
[1:07:45] oh hallelujah
[1:07:46] [Applause]
[1:07:49] no i don't want him to miss it his wife
[1:07:51] has made herself ready
[1:07:56] and he chooses his wife by character
[1:07:58] [Applause]
[1:08:04] and this is the process of character
[1:08:06] development
[1:08:07] the trial of your faith and 75
[1:08:11] to be tried seven times
[1:08:20] are you going to rub yourself are you
[1:08:22] going to wrap yourself
[1:08:24] in the kong of this promised world
[1:08:31] you may be seasoned now i really want to
[1:08:35] leave this with you
[1:08:36] before i go
[1:08:39] [Applause]
[1:08:41] because i know when this meeting is over
[1:08:42] there'll be trials there'll be testing
[1:08:45] there'll be ups and downs but you've got
[1:08:47] to understand that
[1:08:48] the bride is going to be ready
[1:08:54] and she has got to stand you have got to
[1:08:57] stand attack
[1:08:58] the test after the meeting is over
[1:09:08] the brother hand you didn't for a
[1:09:10] long time you got to go over and god
[1:09:12] bless you brother
[1:09:13] forgive me i had an attitude towards you
[1:09:15] forgive me i love you
[1:09:18] then you overcome
[1:09:24] [Music]
[1:09:27] hallelujah oh glory well i don't think
[1:09:31] against you but i drop it thank you
[1:09:32] jesus hallelujah
[1:09:34] you are overcomer when you do just that
[1:09:37] [Applause]
[1:09:43] oh hallelujah
[1:09:47] my mind you may be seated oh praise god
[1:09:50] man the holy spirit looks down
[1:09:52] you see probably kindness you see
[1:09:53] forgiveness you see mercy
[1:09:55] you see grace you see meekness you see
[1:09:58] checklist you see patience you see
[1:10:00] virtue you in love oh glory to god
[1:10:03] he's ready to seal the whole thing with
[1:10:06] [Applause]
[1:10:14] charity
[1:10:16] oh my you may be seated now only the
[1:10:19] bribe would have love
[1:10:21] [Music]
[1:10:25] not the shock the shock like to argue
[1:10:29] because you have nothing inside seedless
[1:10:32] seed going out
[1:10:35] [Applause]
[1:10:38] oh hallelujah the shark was a good shot
[1:10:41] it protected the seed
[1:10:42] but the seed is of age now it could
[1:10:44] speak for himself
[1:10:52] when the seed is in baby form it needs a
[1:10:54] protection
[1:10:55] but when it grows up wants some room
[1:10:59] glory to go they want some elbow room
[1:11:03] so when the holy ghost fell in the upper
[1:11:05] room that upper room was too small for
[1:11:06] them
[1:11:07] they began to stagger my god they began
[1:11:09] to move
[1:11:10] oh glory to god the seat began to pop
[1:11:12] open oh glory to god it was like drunk
[1:11:15] man
[1:11:16] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:11:20] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:11:24] oh hallelujah let god break upon that
[1:11:27] seed
[1:11:28] you heard it this morning and that seed
[1:11:29] will produce the miracle
[1:11:31] and that sea is prolila you can't
[1:11:33] forgive your brother
[1:11:47] oh hallelujah you may be seated i'm
[1:11:50] almost true
[1:11:51] waiting on god waiting for god
[1:11:55] so no longer waiting and waiting she
[1:11:57] said but that
[1:11:59] this is the process of character
[1:12:01] development
[1:12:03] how highly god has commended these
[1:12:05] saints of the dark ages
[1:12:06] patient as lambs led to the slaughter
[1:12:09] lovingly faithfully they walk they serve
[1:12:11] god
[1:12:12] that is all they wanted out of their
[1:12:13] life just service to the lord
[1:12:16] how great was to be their reward oh
[1:12:19] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:12:21] hallelujah blessed be the name of your
[1:12:24] lord
[1:12:26] you see and from the first seal he's
[1:12:28] talking about
[1:12:29] that something happened and when and
[1:12:31] they said the worship god and he said
[1:12:32] you see the book actually was planned
[1:12:35] and written before the foundation of the
[1:12:36] world this book the bible was rarely
[1:12:39] written before the foundation of the
[1:12:40] world
[1:12:41] and christ being the lamb was slain
[1:12:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:12:45] and the members of his bride dna
[1:12:49] will put watch in the lamb's book of
[1:12:52] life
[1:12:53] before the foundation of the world and
[1:12:55] it has been sealed up
[1:12:59] you mean the names were sealed
[1:13:04] and if that book was that open we
[1:13:06] couldn't get to know our names
[1:13:11] so when that mighty angel descended with
[1:13:14] the book open
[1:13:16] and seventh understood the voices out
[1:13:19] the devil was trying to check you
[1:13:20] out but he couldn't find you
[1:13:22] [Applause]
[1:13:25] because it was sealed the voice that
[1:13:28] sealed up
[1:13:29] you shall be sealed because you are that
[1:13:44] book
[1:13:47] oh my hallelujah praise god
[1:13:50] oh hallelujah may be seated
[1:13:53] now watch and the members of his bride
[1:13:56] dear names
[1:13:58] were put in the lamb's book of life
[1:14:01] before the foundational world but it
[1:14:03] sealed up

[1:14:07] name will endear and all about it

[1:14:18] only the earth
[1:14:20] everything heard him saying blessing and
[1:14:22] honor and glory and
[1:14:24] and that was in symbol form
