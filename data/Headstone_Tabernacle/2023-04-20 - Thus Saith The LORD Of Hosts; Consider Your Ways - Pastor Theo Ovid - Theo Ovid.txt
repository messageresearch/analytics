Zechariah Chapter 4. I want to read verse 1 to 10. and had I won we want to reading one to five reading from First Corinthians 6 18. free fornication every sin that a man do it is without the body but he had commit fornication sinned against his own body what know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which he have of God and you are not of your own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods and our next scripture from Zechariah Chapter 4 reading verse 1 and the angel that talked with me came again and with me as a man that has written out of his sleep said unto me what says Thou I said I have looked and we hold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl up on top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven Lambs which are upon the top thereof to all of three by one upon the right side of the bowl the other up on the left side thereof so I answered and speak to the angel that talk with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel talk with me and said and said unto me no it's no not what these be I said no my Lord then he answered and speak unto me singing This is the word of the Lord unto the rubber Bill saying not by might not by power but by my spirit seeth the Lord of hosts who are thou great Mountain because the room well though shall become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shouting scrying Greece grease unto it moreover the word of Lord came to be saying the hands of Jehovah Bell have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shall know that the Lord of whose had sent me unto you for who had despised the day of small things and for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of the river Bell with those seven they're the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro to the whole earth or last of the reason is chapter 1 you want to read in the second year of diary as the king the sixth month and the first day of the month came the word of the Lord by had I the prophet unto zero Bell the South Shield governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of Jose Tech the high priest saying thus speak at the Lord of who saying this people say the time is not come the time that the Lord's hope should be built then came the word of the Lord by hadai the prophets in is it time for you or ye to dwell in your sealed hoses and that word in the Empire is panel houses and this house liewis therefore now therefore thus said the Lord of hosts consider your ways let's ball heads Heavenly Father we thank you for your word tonight may you come and interpret it to our hearts in Jesus name I ask it amen any man you may be seated praise God uh if you want to keep a marker in that scripture there we go back to it he got chapter one we want to just get something something Saturday tonight but have a title of the night thus said the Lord of hosts consider your ways that's the title of tonight amen thus say at the Lord of whose consider your ways of an inspiration rebuilding the last day bright Church under the power of the spirit oh I appreciate the services Sunday when God stirs and I believe it was a message direct from the Lord when God stirs and it got to do that and Trooper Anthony he identified how Cyrus was stood this King by God himself to put a burden to release the people to go and rebuild this Temple so I want to hook into that I got this uh through that has come to me to go into this so I'm going to share this with you tonight and this is from the book of I no just look a little background a little bit you know go out something with Kings and Priests and Prophets in the Bible right and that's the story of the Old Testament Kings priests prophets and most time the king of Ki sometimes the priests go all free coffee but not the prophets the prophet sent by God the street and Kings and Priests straighten the whole system so that's why God have to send Prophets no hagai was considered a minor prophet and his prophecy I believe was within the same year about four months it wasn't a long period of time that he had to see what God put upon him to see now the wickedness of Israel brought destruction it brought the desolation of the temple it was all in Ruins amen and this was some second Kings chapter 25 I'm going to read part of it one and it came to pass in a 90 of his Reigns other Bible teaching but we're going to get we're gonna get to where we're going to get tonight in the 10th month in the tenth day of the month that Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came he and all his hosts against Jerusalem and pitched against it they built fought against roundabout and the city was besieged on the 11th year of King zedekiah and on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city and there was no bread for the people of the land now this is Judgment for sin and wickedness coming to God's people in Jerusalem okay and the city was broken up and all the men of all fled By Night by the way of the gate between two walls which is by the King's Garden now the Italians were against the city wronged about and the King went towards the there was the plane and the army of the child is pursued after the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho and all his army was scattered from him so they took the king brought him up to the king of Babylon to rebab and they give judgment upon him they stood the sons of zedekiah before his eyes put all the eyes of zedika and Bong him with Setters of brass and carried into Babylon in the fifth month of the seventh day of the month which is the 19th year of King Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came nebuch uh nebul zaran captain of the Goddess servant of the king of Babylon unto Jerusalem and he burnt the house of the Lord and the King's house all the houses of Jerusalem and every great man's house burned he would fire and all the armies of the Charlies that were with captains of the god break down the wall House of God broken King's Palace broken burnt with fire judgment but the captain of the god left the poor of the land the Divine dresses and husband men and the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord and the bases and the prison sea was in the house of the Lord the Italians break in pieces and carry the brass of them into Babylon pots the shovels the Snuffles and so on they took away so Israel spent 70 years in Babylon as prophesied by Jeremiah we're talking about prophecy fulfillment of Prophecy and God can't change his mind about what he's in his body now Jeremiah 25 verse 8 says therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts because you have not heard my words Behold I will sin and take all the families of the north saith the Lord the king of Babylon my servant I saw God identifying Nebuchadnezzar a man that will do what God ordained because of the behavior of his people Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof against all these nations wronged about and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment his sin and a Perpetual desolation moreover I will take from them the voice of myth the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom the voice of the Bride the song of the millstone and the light of the candle and the whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations Shall Serve the king of Babylon 70 years God can change that God cannot reverse that the ball from his Arrow has been shut his Arrow from his bow has been shut and that's it and I shall come to pass prophecy continues when 70 years are accomplished so what have his time you know we may feel it's supposed to be so it's supposed to be so but God have his timing so nothing is by chance this lingering time is not by chance Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God and it shall come to pass when 70 years are accomplished that I will punish the king of Babylon and that Nation said the Lord for their iniquity and the land of the challenge and will make it a Perpetual desolation and I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which Jeremiah had prophesied against all the nations so he recognize now God has back up His prophets go to have his prophecy in one thing and he's saying something else because he is who gives the prophets his words we're not talking about false prophecy we're talking about true prophets genuine prophets like what goes in our Prophet this last day Malachi foreign genuine Prophet true Prophet give him his words in the last days a church that will be rebuilt under the power of the spirit Oh Glory to God that's the prophecy that we are sitting on the right now that's the prophecy that is over the bride of Christ around the world that there will be a rebuilding oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God what was the prophecy that Jeremiah had that's Jeremiah 29 verse 10 says for thus saith the Lord is Jeremiah after 70 years we accomplished Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word towards you in causing you to return to this place 70 years and Babylon means another old has died out a lot of children born in Babylon in other words born in captivity they know nothing about what happened back there because they're born and are different thing altogether Hallelujah all they know is the Babylonian system but God promised I will visit you this is his people we're talking about because the Lord some praises for those here the Lord after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word towards you in causing you to return to this place and we hit this in the prayer meeting for I know the thoughts that I think towards you say the Lord toss of Peace another of evil to give you unexpected end then shall you call upon me he shall go and pray unto me and I will happen unto you and he shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart and I will be fond of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity I will gather you from all the nations from all the places where I have driven you saith the Lord I will bring you again to the place when I cause you to be kind of a captive I will bring you back to the original spot the may have to bum you out and run you out I'm gonna bring you back to that the devil's a liar but I have to take 70 years Oh Glory to God to cleanse this land Oh Glory they got to clean up this whole thing oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah we in a message and all a lot of mess what's in the message you know God given time to clear up a lot of stuff you know but we are going to return return back to what the Pentecost return back to the original return back to the faith of the fathers requirement to when the day of Pentacles are fully Come Oh Glory to God fire on the bride power on the brain the spirit on the brain no brother Branham we read this I believe in um the same scripture in desperation you say for thus said the Lord after seven years they accomplished we read this in prayer meeting for another thoughts I think towards you he is not sweet says the Lord the thoughts of Peace not of evil to give your next accepted him then shall he call upon me he shall go and pray unto me I will happen unto you you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all of your heart I'll be fond of you said the Lord I will turn away your captivity I will guard you from All Nations and from the places where I've drove you said the Lord I will bring you again unto the place which I cause you to be carried away captive Pentecost now what he said here I put that in myself it doesn't say that that's what I was meaning to the church Luke 17 the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man pressed into it every man presented not just simply walks into it easily he's got to be pressed into you when you seek me with all your heart I'll be found so you put the key right there people join the message they come into the message they believe the message they're pressing nothing but the kingdom of God had to be preached and every man had to press their way into it so this message this morning tonight is an exaltation and it's something to encourage you to get your apathy get out your laziness your your your deadness your your formality your your formal thing of going to church and just going back home and recognize there somebody's a person too isn't there something there so the king of Babylon took the children of Israel into captivity 70 years but then Cyrus the position King captured Babylon and he was stayed by God as we heard Sunday that God had decreed to go back to the Homeland and build the temple of God it's not something yet he even get them funds money afterwards about two steps down Darius coming to see and cut it off affecting the work of the building her battles because once ever you stood up to do something for God what the battles come what's the fights come watch the opposition come watch the enemy come once your spirit is still Watch What Happens now watch so Cyrus gave the decree okay they stood up to go back and build this Temple this house of God right and watch just a Remnant went back the rest who were born in captivity they remained there and by that time I've guessed they're in business they're doing good they are the hoses they're the homes you know the prospering yeah I know burden you know only the remnant who have a spiritual antenna that we have to be going out to visit us only that Remnant decide to go back I just surrendered it's not something there and this Remnant was led by two people two persons two persons let this small Remnant was the rule belt a prince a governor and he was along the Royal line of David and Joshua a priest is that right no doubt they left family friends in order to go back to desolation and hardship to a land that wasn't till or wasn't brought into subjection for 70 years they're going back to abandonment with a spirit upon them to restore and to rebuild to get it back in order Hallelujah glory to God it wasn't about Comfort or money that caused them to make this journey if they wanted comfort and money they got to stay in Babylon they can stay with their business they could stay where they Prosperity Prosperity but something was burden in them where they were taken from as he was born in Babylon but he wasn't staying in Babylon there was a call inside of him to get back to Jerusalem Oh Glory look they get back to the land what calls inside you tonight you have to have a call in you you know not everybody have that call you know it's just a bunch of Remnant Oh Glory the god set that call to go back not the prosperity and comfort and Easy Living you know go back to Desolation but this is God's lamb go back to Desolation but of course I'm going to restore Hallelujah go back to the ruins Oh Glory the God is not something there it was something spiritual for them a destiny to bring honor and glory to God it was challenging it was no easy part by Clans it was challenging Hallelujah praise God and from Ezra chapter 3 there's three verses there and when the settlement must come the children of Israel were in the cities the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem then stood up jeshua or so when they're traveling to the land you know the first thing to do the first thing they did was what Villa altar a place that they could talk to God least that he could offer sacrifice so when you're on the path of restoration you have to get connection first thing they build backer altar to restore back a connection to Jehovah watch and when the seven month was come to me Israel was the cities the people Ghana together themselves together as one man to Jerusalem then stood up Joshua the son of Joseph his bridge in the priests the Ruleville the son of Shield his Brethren and builded the altar of God of Israel to offer burned offerings thereon as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God and they set the alt upon his bases for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries and they offered burnt offerings therefore unto the Lord even burnt offerings morning and evening so they're coming back into our Zone let's say for instance the rubabell he Clueless he had born there you grew up there this is new land and they have countries all around it have enemies all around they are small bunch but they have a mission they are small Bunch but they stood up they are small Bunch but they have a calling upon them and they know that they have enemies out there so they are playing with this altar they're calling upon God they're frightened but they praying they're shaking but they pray isn't that familiar when he was in the upper room they were fighting but it was their present and blessing God continually Oh Glory to God it was the upper room for fear of the Jews Oh Glory to God's favorite frightened pray if you're scared pray if you're worried pray oh glory the lord is not things not working as they wanted pray ER Hallelujah now this time that these guys going in this maybe I think it's about 20 years since Cyrus gives the decree to build the temple stood up by God to do that and you know what they were working they actually work on the temple for two years and then stopped so that fire that stirring that anointing lasted for two years and didn't step this Prophet call haggai that is where he came in because he had that burden to get them back on track Hallelujah and this is the question that God presented to them and this is where we read a guy come up speaking thus said the Lord of hosts sin this people say no we're not talking about those in Babylon we're talking about the cold loved ones we're talking about the remnant no we're talking about people in the land because what happened they started work at the temple Foundation late you're gonna get it and afterwards things stop and I think it's 14 years past not a stone nothing moving foreign taking a coffee break relaxing time in the message here come had I hear what God is saying this people say the time is not come the time that the Lord's hope should be built they can't question going back that is folly they know they have to go back but a query come up now you know I mean I do think there's the time you know you know what continue then the word of the Lord by higai the prophet saying is it time for you or ye to dwell in your sealed hoses and this hosts like ways now therefore the Lord of hosts not that simple consider your whis this small group low resources choose to build a smaller Temple than Solomon home but they were working on their own home they were working on their own stuff and not the purpose that God raised them up for what are you working on what is your project the priorities got skewed they was focusing on the wrong thing oh praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah they stopped building after two years and of 14 years nothing was done on the house of God now remember you are the temple of the Holy Ghost you gonna be God's house hallelujah hallelujah you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you know yes you are to work on that you know yes you have other things doing other things but you are supposed to work on you know I place a double pray daily tell everyone on their virtues is in this stature of Minds oh get the Lord a shout out how many will pledge it that's what we pledge to write and the statue of a perfect man pleasure to pray for Faith and for virtue and for knowledge and for temperance and for patience and for godliness and for brotherly kindness that we could be a living Tabernacle of the living God's dwell in place we'll give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God a conflict of returning to the land if it was right or wrong no it was right but like our timing is wrong it was a terrible condition God raised up the prophet to speak to his children and all this isn't just about the four months the purpose that God raised up that Prophet was to motivate and Inspire the people to work on the temple of God when the foundation was laid and that Foundation was laid identified in Ezra 3 8 to 11 he said no the second year of their coming into the house of God at Jerusalem in the second month began the rule about the same Shield Joshua the son of Jose and the remnant of the bridge when the priest and the Levites all that they will come out of the Captivity unto Jerusalem they appointed Levites from 20 years old upward to set forth the work of the house of the Lord then stood Joshua with his sons and his Brethren Camille and his sons and the sons of Judah together they set forward a Workman in the house of God the sons of hinenaad with his sons on the abrasion of the Levites and when the builders laid the foundation of the Temple of the Lord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the Levi is the son of Assaf with symbols to praise the Lord after the ordinance of David king of Israel and they sang together by course and praising and giving thanks unto the Lord because he is good his Mercy endured forever towards Israel and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid Oh Glory to God disapproval laid a foundation his hand shall also finish it walketh the Lord some Praises oh give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah Hallelujah with a tangly that Foundation was able to shouting but praising they were there's going to be a short quick message oh give the Lord some Praises they're going to rock the Nations Hallelujah glory to God glory the God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my god of fires in the building tonight after two years workstop then go to the tell his Prophet these people say the people talking the time has not come the time that the Lord's House should be built the mid an excuse that song spiritual not that it won't be built you know but but you know I mean I believe my house I I had it all night doing this I doing that I fixing me and God said consider your ways think to consider is to think carefully about something come from a Latin word to examine to pause a moment to consider to reflect because what happened after a while this lack of Interest lack of enthusiasm lack of concern apacy take them make a Revival they stirred up does he say what you see should make a church that will make a Revival that we will find them everywhere I said there's seven Thunders that are rip this there's been mean man he says what we see should make that produce that manifest that bring that into a reality there'll be a church where the shout of the king will be in the camp Glory opposite of apathy is enthusiasm the prophet says he said no this is your own life this is my life if this isn't the truth what I'm fixing to see I'm one of the most foolish people in the world I've given my life for something there's nothing to and so have you but if it is the truth then I owe everything that I am I owe everything that I could be to the cause of which we are standing for I think that we must lose our enthusiasm push yourself tonight Hallelujah fight yourself tonight you can't afford to lose your enthusiasm the devil will frighten you he said I'd rather you're hot or you're cold but because you lukewarm you lose your answers enthusiasm you're in apathy you're in laodicia I will spill you out in my mouth and hear any message with books and tips okay the Lord some praises Hallelujah glory to God change the priorities consider your ways consider your ways reflect on your behavior reflect on your choices reflect on your actions take a step back and examine see-o entitled you are a lot they'll be so disappointed that's been hurt you know when you feel entitled to something yeah Jesus gave an example he said when somebody invite you take the lower seat you figure you belong to some higher seat and new places over there and somebody more worthy come than you and that is actually excuse me your Shadow coming moving from there then your vexing everything else because Jesus said what to do take the Lewis seat when you take this you don't feel you're entitled when you take a seat that you feel you're entitled to and have to remove from that there's a problem that is what is happening now people feel the entitled because a long time in the message they're entitled because this they're entitled cut it out you entitled to fight you're entitled to press you're entitled to back back to your way you're entitlement of every place you put your foot is yours that is what you're entitled to examine yourself to see what it is improving everybody say a nice you're good you're fine with that channel that what them say what did God say and what do you know reputation is what other people talk about you characters who you are Hallelujah when you're by yourself that's character Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God coming personally aware and coming uncomfortable that's the problem no some people are not accomplishable to nobody so they do whatever they want like if we're in the days of Judges everybody do what's in the heart oh blessed be the name of the Lord God ask a question is it time for you you say it's not time to build the house of God but is it time for you to dwell in your panel houses and this whole line wheeze parties were off not having the right priority making and this is where we have to come to making the most important thing the most important thing let the main thing be the main thing everything else is inside you let me say it again let the main thing be the main thing only the most important thing be the most important thing Hallelujah getting a burden for the house of God to be rebuilt and to be in order your house in order but you're not burdened about a church being in order your house in order but you're not burden about anybody else getting an order and the fire of God in the church you're not burdened consider your ways a message to reorder priorities Matthew 6 33 and seek ye first the kingdom of God of his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah verse 5. now therefore thus say the Lord of hosts consider your ways and then go start to rip into them the sixes you have sown much and bring in little you eat but you have not enough you drink and you are not filled with drink he clothed you but there is none warm and he that earned wages earned wages to put it in a bag with holes in other words you're doing your thing no burden for Revival no burden for breakthrough no burden for this touch of man back in the church and individuals no burden for Holy Ghost not burden for nothing in the house there's some people they have zero burden none I remember when he was building this church what was involved or who was in the early days make sense and and toting bricks and and everything else that was a labor to bring it to where we are now and the people could walk in the building now and never have a clue how this got here and they may even feel the entitled to criticize they wasn't there for the foundation they wasn't there for the building they come when it's finished but there are things that God put in individuals that that that that only you could produce that only you could do that that you're called to it got that pick nobody else go Choose You and if he choose you it means he'll put something in you that's why he chose you he chooses the idol he actually to be like a like a leech like a parasite in church just sucking and drawing and benefiting and giving nothing back Hallelujah just like I don't know he's so much bring it little drink not filled with drink I've clothed not warm I hear Ernest witches and the witches put up in a back for the holes money leaking out the car even show what all the money God bless them but they can't show nothing for it because holes in the back then he said they can never serve him don't see it the Lord of hosts consider your ways God telling them you know God telling us God telling you God telling me consider your ways verse 8. he said go up to the mountain and bring wood and build a house I like that he didn't say Valley you know go up in the mountain you have something to do yeah Hallelujah I'm going to put it easy you know he said go up the mountain and bring wood bring the material what it takes to produce this revival go up and get what it takes to produce a church with Jesus Christ walking in it we find us to come among the people in their homes and their lives go up the mountain and bring back your gift bring back what God gave you oh give the Lord a shout in the house bring it bring it to God bring it to the house of God hallelujah go up to the mountain bring wood and build a house and I will take pleasure in it so God has got pleasure too you are pleasure and you hold your house nice your pleasure on your own nights your pleasure what about God's pleasure no praise God you think God already won the physical building he said him with my children hurting my footstool what house will you build me okay the Lord some Praises you think you think God won the building come on now it's a little more than

Mountain because the Hoover belt though shall become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shouting's crying Grace with unto it we are all acquainted with the scripture that reason the Bible we all know is during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and zerubbabel was a great Prince among the people who had laid the foundation of the building now I want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointed jacket this morning as we think this great Prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord and when he did he did the foundation stone we read on further we found out God said the rule has laid the foundation with his hands he shall also bring forth The Headstone I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the Cornerstone he shall pray for The Headstone and we all know the scripture said that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone and he also is a headstone and we will think for a few minutes that the seventh Church messenger was the restored of faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by might not by power but by my spirits he at the Lord not my organization not by denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church and the last days okay the Lord some Praises do you see what all ties together oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen Joshua was the one who wants to bring forth The Headstone he had laid the foundation he took the people back to the foundation and type we all know that these candlesticks and so forth represented both Jewish and church there were Olive branches the Olive Branch we are the wild branch that was grafted into the root of the tame Olive Tree Gentiles and out of these two branches come ascensor pipes seven colon cancer six to give light to 70 ages not remembering our teaching on the lessons and you talk about the pyramid he said the architecture the stones could weigh tons and tons and tons and that's the way the body of Jesus Christ should be so cut because they were so they cut so cleanly so the body of Jesus Christ should be so cut by the Holy Spirit by God

glory to God let me see if I can tell him my Lord my Lord my Lord Hallelujah praise God verse 10 of this chapter two in the fourth and 20th day of the ninth month in the second year so it's still the second year of Darius all this happened in second year of the arrested King the word of the Lord said prophet Isaiah the prophet singing thus hear the Lord of hosts acts no the priests considering the law she's going to bowl them I want to say googly pull him a ball ask the concerning the law hear the question I was asked if one be a holy flesh in the scoot of His Garment and with this could do

shall I be holy the priest answered and said no then here guy he said if one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these shall be unclean and the priest answered and said it shall be unclean so in other words your car transfer holiness you can't take Holiness and and convert something into Holiness but it could take corruption and everything is starting to get corrupt you hear what is a question here he said if one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these things shall it be unclean they said it shall be unclean then answered and said so is this people so is this nation

Hallelujah watch this now and upon this Stone upon this Stone in each case to vindicate that word coming up I was gonna skip prophecy sometime but again musician companies sometimes the Capstone will return the head of all of it and receive the bride unto himself which the woman is took from The Man a part of the man isn't that right praise God that's how we know notice then you are a son of God in the house of God you are part of God's economy Romans 8 1 there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus for they are debt to the world alive in him living in this present day making the way that God has used them for for ordain them placing names on this bright book and when the waters come upon that see that's in the heart raises up to the bride of Christ that's the prophecy hanging all the time the secret is what the word is in the bride what's the word the seed is in the bride what's the seed waiting for everything for water you can manifest in the water God and charge a rain or man this doesn't say brain rain rain no God doesn't rain goddess and Son God has to send Dynamics when the day of Pentacles was fully come he have to do it praise God isn't that right so he said no

understandification the Pentecostal under the arms The Works the dies and so forth watch but watch but now we come to the Head Grace Grace the Capstone cried The Headstone crying what Chris Grace pass from death and Creed unto a Living Word of the Living God God's only provided time for this age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit over something to make it alive

them as they age couldn't do any particular age but in the day when the Sonoma will be manifest revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of God among his people showing this invisible sign manifesting himself like he did at the beginning he was manifested on Earth in the form of a prophet God promised in Malachi 4 by the rest of the scriptures don't like so quickly and I'm finished here is God's reflector me knows that the reflector doesn't reflect is in his reflection is something have to strike the reflector to make it reflect so a prophet is a chosen vessel of God that can't reflect nothing at all but he's in a direct line of that reflection God to reflect the image of Christ in the word nothing can do it you are reflector and that's the reason the prophet has to eat the book that's the reason he had to eat the scroll he had to reflect that word for that age you got it there's a final quote notice Enoch God's perfect reflecting type when God was true with him he just translated them took him up the mechanic that he had reflected became Dynamic with the spirit and took him up friends is a prophecy that the church will be rebuilt under the party spirit every gift have to find its place every person have to find their position in the body of Christ can't sit back as if you're on a tea break you can't sit back as if we have all this time you're doing your own thing running your own show having your own program and the things of God have been neglected We Could Be Few but that doesn't mean we cannot make it go tell them be strong they are the
