[46:33] verse six
[46:43] somes 8506 will thou not revive us again
[46:47] that thy people may rejoice in thee will

[46:58] may the Lord had a blessing to the

[47:01] this morning amen and certainly on
[47:06] behalf of the pastor this morning I want
[47:08] to certainly wish everyone a wonderful
[47:11] and blessed Christmas season time of
[47:15] family a time of reflection and we
[47:18] understand clearly that historically
[47:21] Jesus was never born on December 25th
[47:23] but we do understand that it is it is
[47:27] also a time when even though the world
[47:29] reflects on that birth within the
[47:32] context of their understanding we also
[47:34] have a deeper understanding of what his
[47:37] birth and his life and his death and his
[47:40] burial and his resurrection means to us
[47:42] so in all our going and all our coming
[47:46] let us not forget the real reason for
[47:48] the season and to keep Jesus at the
[47:51] center of our lives the center of our
[47:53] hearts the center of our affairs you
[47:56] know as we approach this week just for a
[47:59] few announcements
[48:00] there will be no midweek service this
[48:03] week our next service in fact we just
[48:06] have two services left in 2018 so make
[48:10] every effort to make it and also
[48:12] encourage and write someone tell someone
[48:15] last services will be this coming Sunday
[48:18] at 10 a.m. and then Olli as night 10
[48:21] p.m.
[48:22] into the new year to start 2019 in the
[48:26] house of the Lord and in the presence of
[48:28] the Lord and with believers of like
[48:31] precious faith who traveled this journey
[48:35] not by our own choosing but because he
[48:38] chose us our love for him cannot even
[48:41] compare because he loved us before we
[48:43] could even understand what love was and
[48:45] before we even were aware of ourselves
[48:47] he loved us before and that itself is a
[48:50] blessing amen
[48:51] so I'm not gonna be preaching this
[48:54] morning as we know beloved is in South
[48:57] Africa and they're having a tremendous
[48:59] time a few hours ago actually because
[49:02] they are six hours ahead of us a few
[49:04] hours ago the Sunday morning service but
[49:07] all be preached so we already have it so
[49:11] he's gonna speak to us this Sunday
[49:12] morning and when you appreciate the
[49:15] pastor this morning and I woke up
[49:18] something woke me up at around 3:00 a.m.
[49:21] 4:00 a.m. and I tell myself let me just
[49:24] check what's what's what's turn and as I
[49:27] connected to the service it's fire all
[49:29] over the place and but Obon is there
[49:32] preaching like he's 19 years old you
[49:36] know so I'm at a great expectation for
[49:38] what look what God will do for us today
[49:41] in the tabernacle but I came across this
[49:44] story that I wanted to just share with
[49:46] you and hopefully it will help somebody
[49:49] to old and particularly their young
[49:52] people there are many inspiring stories
[49:55] connected with the writing of our hymns
[49:57] you know we sing so many songs and
[49:59] sometimes you never really understand
[50:02] what happened what letters somebody
[50:04] writing the song Amazing Grace what
[50:06] let's somebody write in a song it is
[50:08] well with my soul or the song that we
[50:11] sing and we sing it you know because we
[50:13] live in it and it but it is real to us
[50:15] but sometime when you look deeper to see
[50:18] what took place I just want to share
[50:19] this with you there are many inspiring
[50:21] stories connected with the writing of
[50:23] our hymns but it would be difficult to
[50:26] find a more unusual one than what
[50:29] happened to William McKee when at the
[50:33] age of seventeen he left his humble
[50:35] Scottish home to attend college his
[50:40] godly mother gave him a Bible in which
[50:43] she wrote his name and a verse of
[50:45] scripture away from home he began well
[50:49] but as time went by he drifted further
[50:53] and further from the way he had been
[50:54] raised he began drinking heavily at a
[50:58] low point to satisfy his thirst for
[51:02] skee he carelessly pawned the Bible his
[51:06] mother had given him many years went by
[51:10] eventually McKay completed medical
[51:13] training and took up his work in a city
[51:16] hospital there one day the Lord met him
[51:20] in a special way I imagine it started
[51:23] out like any other day doing rounds
[51:25] writing reports but in one room he had
[51:28] an encounter that changed everything it
[51:31] was a sad case the patient was nearing
[51:34] the end no hope for him bring me the
[51:37] book he cried I need my book and the
[51:39] words seemed to echo in the flinty soul
[51:42] of dr. McKie a while later he was told a
[51:45] fellow had died and the doctor went back
[51:48] to the room curious to find out what
[51:50] book have been so precious that holding
[51:54] it once more had been a dying man's
[51:56] greatest desire soon his search
[52:00] uncovered a Bible but not just any Bible
[52:04] there inside the front cover in his
[52:07] mother's hand was his own name William
[52:10] Hutton McKee it had been many years
[52:13] since he had seen it but there could be
[52:15] no mistake someone had reclaimed the
[52:19] Bible from that pawn shop and it had
[52:22] become a priceless treasure to a dying
[52:25] man McKay went to his office and closed
[52:28] the door he opened the Bible slowly
[52:31] turning the Warren and weddin weather
[52:33] pages many contain specially marked
[52:37] verses his mother hoped he would read he
[52:40] was alone in that room for many hours
[52:42] but when he emerged a long night of sin
[52:45] had been blasted away by the
[52:48] life-changing light of heaven with a
[52:50] newly tender heart and a desire to
[52:53] reclaim wasted years he resigned his
[52:57] place at the hospital after training he
[53:00] went on to serve the Lord as a pastor
[53:02] and it was William McKee who wrote the
[53:05] song hallelu
[53:08] I'm the glory mist and hallelujah
[53:14] ha
[53:20] the glory revive us one more time
[53:35] [Music]

[1:11:32] 1 a good Jew chapter 1 want to
[1:11:35] verse three unsaid march up the sixteen
[1:11:38] we wanna read from verse fifteen to
[1:11:41] twenty readin Ephesians four reading
[1:11:53] from verse 4 there is one body and one
[1:11:56] spirit even as here call in one hope of
[1:12:00] your calling one Lord one faith one
[1:12:03] baptism one God and Father of all who is
[1:12:07] above all and through all and in your
[1:12:09] but under every one of us is given grace
[1:12:12] according to the measure of the gift of
[1:12:15] Christ wherefore he saith when he
[1:12:17] ascended on high he led captivity
[1:12:19] captive and gave gifts unto men know
[1:12:23] that he ascended what is it but that he
[1:12:26] also descended first a little or
[1:12:27] possibly that he that descended is the
[1:12:30] same also that ascended up far above
[1:12:33] heaven that he might fill all things and
[1:12:36] he gives some apostles and some prophets
[1:12:37] and some evangelists have some pastors
[1:12:40] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:12:43] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:12:45] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[1:12:48] we all come into the unity of the face
[1:12:50] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[1:12:52] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:12:55] stature of the fullness of Christ we
[1:12:59] would add Jude Jude 1:3 beloved when I
[1:13:04] gave all diligence to write unto you of
[1:13:07] the common salvation it was needful for
[1:13:08] me to write unto you want to exhort you
[1:13:11] that you should then thusly contend for
[1:13:13] the faith which was once delivered unto
[1:13:17] the Saints are we go to st. mark 16
[1:13:19] reading from verse 15 and he said of the
[1:13:24] demin go into all the world and preach
[1:13:26] the gospel to every creature he does
[1:13:29] believe in his baptized shall be saved
[1:13:31] either the V but not shall be damned and
[1:13:33] these signs shall follow them that
[1:13:36] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:13:38] Devils they shall speak with new tall
[1:13:40] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:13:42] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:13:44] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:13:46] and they shall recover so then after the
[1:13:50] Lord had spoken unto them he was
[1:13:52] received up into heaven and sat on the
[1:13:53] right hand of God and they went forth
[1:13:56] and preached everywhere the Lord working
[1:13:58] with them confirming the word with signs
[1:14:01] following amen
[1:14:03] may God bless his holy word you may be
[1:14:05] seated so this morning I have a title
[1:14:17] unity of the original faith restored by
[1:14:22] Malachi 4 that's my title this morning
[1:14:26] unity of the original field restored by
[1:14:29] Malachi 4 and I will thought contending
[1:14:33] for the original feet defeat and I
[1:14:36] believe in my heart and I'm looking
[1:14:38] forward for it that there is going to be
[1:14:40] a unity of disease that's what the Bible
[1:14:44] said that the five four minutes are
[1:14:46] gonna be here until we all come into the
[1:14:48] unity of the faith so all the issues in
[1:14:52] the message we're supposed to be sorted
[1:14:54] out by another Ephesians and Merritt
[1:14:58] Ephesians was to bring us all on the
[1:15:01] same page because when the country
[1:15:03] Ephesians we come to the Lord one faith
[1:15:06] one baptism it has nothing to do with
[1:15:10] interpretation doctrine and Ben's idea
[1:15:13] is going to be one more it will be one
[1:15:22] be seated brainstorm Loreena borderland

[1:18:11] primary this is the many seasons
[1:18:18] hallelujah glory to God I am NOT in
[1:18:23] South Africa I'm a hidden places this is
[1:18:27] where we measure Kingman not attached
[1:18:46] [Applause]
[1:18:57] in the kingdom gospel preached and the
[1:19:41] gospel is not
[1:19:53] our promise member abbien expectations
[1:19:57] with it say Mary Stuart I said the
[1:20:04] Midlands but sit beside a Methodist but
[1:20:07] many custom is not shittin in order the
[1:20:11] coming of the Lord Jesus will be so
[1:20:13] powerful that Patti will come as a
[1:20:15] disciple church the rest of them from
[1:20:18] the baby there will be an election
[1:20:21] schibetta banner 1954 he said so tonight
[1:20:26] I'm somebody like this one
[1:20:38] I mean yes we are living in a time of
[1:20:42] the restoration of the gifts it's
[1:20:44] fundamentally design churches
[1:20:46] it's the Nazarene it makes the
[1:20:49] Pentecostals but just the same God is
[1:20:53] Romanian listen imminent the rapture and
[1:20:57] faithful research when athene what
[1:21:01] that's right
[1:21:03] so tonight listen I represent that
[1:21:10] Senate the faith that was once delivered
[1:21:14] to the scenes and the real of a divine
[1:21:18] gift this is very important human
[1:21:24] decision he was saying tonight I
[1:21:28] represent that village by way of the
[1:21:32] gift what he's doing here he said the
[1:21:37] gift is demonstrating and showing
[1:21:39] something represent interference but the
[1:21:43] faith is common because the factor only
[1:21:45] come by the breaking of the seasons
[1:21:49] if we stop activate or in a cocktail
[1:21:55] visual what they had
[1:21:57] it's not a Vietnam it is d hate we want
[1:22:03] to emphasize that part original one not
[1:22:06] dependent on one another how naughty
[1:22:09] ones that are worn and on the TV I know
[1:22:11] not that that is not original original
[1:22:15] is alpha additional revenue I said so
[1:22:29] okay
[1:22:47] pouring of God
[1:22:50] you may be seated and this rate is the
[1:22:55] papacy of this regional this fate is
[1:22:57] based upon forgiveness so what we ask
[1:23:00] them this edge here is a bubble on the
[1:23:04] top so let's analyze that is like what
[1:23:12] miss you and I and we have challenged
[1:23:16] you we are challenged because we have to
[1:23:22] come what is this or get the Lord our
[1:23:29] show
[1:23:33] [Applause]
[1:23:40] Moby's easy
[1:23:54] but abandon the ABCs work number than a
[1:23:58] restaurant and he saw this woman and he
[1:24:01] began to condemn and say Lord is that's
[1:24:04] the kind of place might jog on the raise
[1:24:06] up in and so on like that and God tap it
[1:24:09] on his shoulder put him aside give him a
[1:24:13] vision showing when he was more his sins
[1:24:18] coming up to God and the blood of Jesus
[1:24:21] like a bumper bouncing at all and they I
[1:24:24] can't God will forgive me but Kappa
[1:24:27] merciful death fulness and God said I
[1:24:30] forgive you and you condemn her so he
[1:24:34] himself has to be built into the
[1:24:38] kindness into the spirit of forgiveness
[1:24:41] it's not just saying I forgive you it's
[1:24:45] a spirit it's an amazing it's a fish
[1:24:49] here there's something I have to be real
[1:24:54] Jesus a Miss Mary because they're
[1:25:01] dependent charity
[1:25:11] let me see a we have five feet to pull
[1:25:15] down the capstone if we have to leave it
[1:25:17] in the rapture we have to put on the cap
[1:25:20] because charity never faileth
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:26:17] even Jesus even Jesus manifested it
[1:26:25] Jesus this is Flip Wilson now make at
[1:26:40] least one forgiveness go glory to God I
[1:26:44] think is it a message for the ground
[1:26:49] Bambi's PowerSchool mom says rapture and
[1:26:53] fate will only be revealed to those who
[1:26:55] forgive their brothers

[1:32:08] [Applause]
[1:32:10] no no no we can't even cuz I can attest
[1:32:13] because it'd be for children people on

[1:32:25] dressed right
[1:32:26] oh she's a sinner
[1:32:33] [Applause]
[1:32:46] [Applause]
[1:32:55] we may be seated
[1:32:57] when we lust for knowledge it's a sin to
[1:33:01] do so it's a strong statement this from
[1:33:06] a message Seaton Seaton but a brand now
[1:33:13] someone's treated this message in lust
[1:33:15] for knowledge but the Bible prophesied
[1:33:18] that their people in last have itching
[1:33:19] ears you want to know is elitist mystery
[1:33:22] that they could understand and Christ is
[1:33:27] the mystery of God revealed I have
[1:33:32] written preached so much stuff and I'm
[1:33:35] not saying nothing about the life stuff
[1:33:38] is because poorab Adam said and I
[1:33:40] thought the court yet he said the
[1:33:41] mysteries was revealed that we can see
[1:33:44] the plainness of God I know how to
[1:33:47] behave ourselves in the present day that
[1:33:51] we live in now the mysteries are not
[1:33:53] received information saved it's revealed
[1:33:56] that we can see the blameless of God and
[1:34:00] know how to behave so turn back to our
[1:34:05] behavior that God must approve so Purim
[1:34:12] says the thing of it today we don't try
[1:34:14] to establish the Word of God in the
[1:34:15] people's heart we tried to establish
[1:34:17] ourselves or churches that trying to
[1:34:19] establish the doctrine of the church and
[1:34:21] the person whose heart we are commanded
[1:34:23] to establish the Word of God you may be
[1:34:24] seated
[1:34:25] Paul said I could Paul I didn't come to
[1:34:28] you with enticing words of man that you
[1:34:31] have faith my dress under knowledge of
[1:34:33] the man
[1:34:34] I come to you in power and
[1:34:36] manifestations of holy course that your
[1:34:39] faith might rest in God so Paul was
[1:34:42] careful that the people not impressed
[1:34:44] with his knowledge
[1:34:46] information and revelation as a person
[1:34:49] having confidence in the power that got
[1:34:51] to museum Colin do you get abused that
[1:34:55] man of God and team - Johan and - given
[1:34:58] your spirit and see your soon by the
[1:35:01] power of Almighty God Alleluia and the
[1:35:04] word is the conductor of the Spirit so
[1:35:07] perhaps might repair to a soul and the
[1:35:09] spirit of Florida will complete the
[1:35:13] voice
[1:35:14] he said establish the Word of God take
[1:35:17] all the unbelief and SW the king of God
[1:35:18] in on my heart and the kingdom of God
[1:35:21] tie the established in a man's heart
[1:35:22] least what me that man does Oh God when
[1:35:26] the son of man comment shall he find
[1:35:28] that feet and they do it he said restore
[1:35:30] the feet of the children back to the
[1:35:32] feet of the fathers the original word
[1:35:36] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:35:39] original word all glory to God not if it
[1:35:43] was delivered he said defeat and defeat
[1:35:47] was mentally better the Saints not
[1:35:49] afraid people say is like as I fade
[1:35:51] there's only one fate there's only one
[1:35:54] law
[1:35:55] so what are we against what his people
[1:35:57] are kept in this message when there was
[1:35:59] only one fate we come to preach that
[1:36:01] fake this morning does anyone say well
[1:36:04] glory to God hallelujah praise God will
[1:36:07] result now the only way that we ever
[1:36:11] want to know if we can find out what the
[1:36:13] faith is then we can even see contention
[1:36:16] that fate now the faith was much
[1:36:18] delivered if you go back to where they
[1:36:20] were first for sins and what the faith
[1:36:22] was what they come for the content for
[1:36:24] and that would church to say miss me
[1:36:27] sanctified they had a faith you know in
[1:36:30] our resurrected Christ
[1:36:34] someone who rose up to death and was
[1:36:37] living among them just to see my z1
[1:36:39] before he died
[1:36:40] it wasn't contended for some historical
[1:36:42] of fear but they were contending for a
[1:36:43] living Christ who was in there miss yet
[1:36:46] a little while we will see it in an all
[1:36:49] but you shall see me and that is what
[1:36:51] the apostles believed they believed that
[1:36:54] he was in the flesh and he was more in
[1:36:56] the spirit that is what they taught that
[1:36:58] is what they believe that what the
[1:37:00] practice and that is what God confirmed
[1:37:03] and that's the very faith this that they
[1:37:06] had in the beginning is supposed to be
[1:37:08] today that same fate in a resurrected
[1:37:12] Christ not just talking about brother
[1:37:15] Branham but talking about me now right

[1:50:49] and some but people believe
[1:50:52] naughty more treats to reveal as
[1:50:54] important as it is because this here is
[1:51:00] written the way it is and we could read
[1:51:02] and understand it is written that way
[1:51:05] these define let's follow people

[1:51:27] faith because faith he says the Bible is
[1:51:30] the road map that leads to the power of
[1:51:32] God and faith leads you to the power so

[1:52:31] original doctrine that original faith
[1:52:34] watch what bring them back to the faith
[1:52:37] of the father's here we go I ready the
[1:52:40] Pentecostal part in the restoration time
[1:52:46] so he is healed
[1:52:48] there's going to be a restoration time
[1:52:49] but there's a Pentecostal pact
[1:52:52] that's the fire part that's the power
[1:52:54] that that's the anointing part that's
[1:52:57] the anointing

[1:57:27] they were gifted under that feet and
[1:57:29] when he died Beethoven fishes anybody

[1:58:14] Jesus I figured reason that did seem him
[1:58:17] working among them oh praise the name of
[1:58:20] the Lord
[1:58:21] oh ha let's continue praise God from
[1:58:23] Juba Jireh 1962 is one of my favorite
[1:58:27] quotes
[1:58:27] he said you have written for something
[1:58:29] that's going to take the feet 1962 he's
[1:58:34] seen we are beaten on something that
[1:58:36] will take the feet and we store the feet
[1:58:38] of the children back to the original
[1:58:40] Pentecostal tree all their denomination
[1:58:42] increase Easter down God said I will
[1:58:44] restore it in the last days it will be
[1:58:47] restored here the prophecy God shall
[1:58:50] send the Holy Ghost in such a way upon
[1:58:54] planted burden that it will restore so
[1:58:59] we still coming from these seven
[1:59:01] thunders mystery to turn our children
[1:59:03] back to the faith of the fathers but we
[1:59:04] going on deeper now how that will be
[1:59:07] because these sheets will bring season
[1:59:09] to you which will be planted word and
[1:59:11] now you take the Holy Ghost

[1:59:46] case in the last days more glory to God
[1:59:49] for all these teachings and all these
[1:59:51] revelations it has to be converted
[1:59:53] something has to change or glowing a
[1:59:56] government brother Brown wasn't a
[1:59:58] mountain he a blast went for three
[2:00:00] blasts one two three
[2:00:01] he said a bredrin for the blast but I
[2:00:04] heard the voice
[2:00:08] the boy said Justin strike in Westeros
[2:00:18] the Bridgman who the blasts so they
[2:00:22] could go on for some last revolution I
[2:00:23] do this for myself but the purpose of
[2:00:34] the voice well blowing their God is
[2:00:39] harmless interpreted Scripture voice of
[2:00:43] one time the Willis that's the word but
[2:00:46] that's also John Fletcher self concede
[2:00:50] that's the word but that is Mary or
[2:00:53] globe market for six that's the word
[2:00:56] that's you the children who has to be
[2:01:00] paid back to the faith of the Father

[2:01:31] in brand then he spoke about an adoption
[2:01:33] he's talking about coming out and I'm

[2:01:38] the labor pains and so on
[2:01:39] he's in our church go to labor pains

[2:01:47] of the outside world believing on the
[2:01:49] Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy
[2:01:51] Ghost is just as real as it was the
[2:01:53] Pentecost and this is the problem I
[2:01:55] don't hear people talking about it
[2:01:57] that's just that real Oh glory to God I
[2:01:59] want what Peter had just what Paul had
[2:02:02] those brothers had it
[2:02:04] whatever I'm keen that we kind of go
[2:02:06] forward until we go back and pick up
[2:02:07] what they had we have to go and pick up
[2:02:09] the feet
[2:02:10] because that is the original shape it
[2:02:13] have no new city its original shape that
[2:02:17] you want pick method of God and that
[2:02:20] fate is run in a turn to face the
[2:02:22] rapture oh boy those guys were adopted
[2:02:25] those guys had the holy ghost but time
[2:02:29] ran out on them and they fell into the
[2:02:31] ground but be who are alive and remain

[2:03:34] behavior praise God you cannot be a kind
[2:03:37] of missile the early church fell because
[2:03:40] the people take the anointing they take
[2:03:42] anointing of the people and put it on a
[2:03:43] man who has become a pope Nicole Eaton
[2:03:46] and then we become a doctrine then
[2:03:48] become a man and the church fell away
[2:03:49] from that God heats organization gets
[2:03:52] the domination he hits the even God is
[2:03:56] like but a roundover disability of the
[2:03:58] local church because once you go to this

[2:50:52] reason for the season I look back over
[2:50:54] the years and we face 2019 I remember
[2:50:58] being in secondary school and back then
[2:51:00] we will look in towards the year 2000
[2:51:03] y2k and teenagers don't even know where
[2:51:05] that is now but back then we didn't know
[2:51:07] what was going to happen
[2:51:08] and I used to tell my school friends I
[2:51:10] don't think we're gonna make it past
[2:51:12] 2000 wrapped
[2:51:13] come and was it form one form to form
[2:51:15] tree I was preaching then the rap tears
[2:51:17] come in and to see how time has unfolded
[2:51:20] I'm but a random tortoise he said plan
[2:51:23] as if he's coming in 20 years but live
[2:51:26] as if he's coming tomorrow you know so
[2:51:29] as we come to 2019 many of us in the
[2:51:32] message never thought we'd see 2019 and
[2:51:34] we don't know how much time is left but
[2:51:36] we do know that time is short so we want
[2:51:39] to be conscious friends to do all that
[2:51:41] we can do for his kingdom and that Great
[2:51:44] Commission that Borobudur is reaching
[2:51:46] about that Jesus said to go into all the
[2:51:48] world and this gospel must be preached
[2:51:50] as a witness before the end could come
[2:51:53] so we're looking for the end but before
[2:51:54] the end could come this gospel will be
[2:51:57] preached and the preaching of the gospel
[2:51:58] is not in word only but it is empower it
[2:52:02] is in demonstration it is in signs it is
[2:52:04] in wonders it is in your behavior being
[2:52:07] change that when you look out you
[2:52:09] recognize hey the person I was in 2018
[2:52:11] I'm not that person anymore
[2:52:12] so may the Lord richly bless you and me
[2:52:15] you have a blessed week see you on
[2:52:17] Sunday Lord willing and I know last
