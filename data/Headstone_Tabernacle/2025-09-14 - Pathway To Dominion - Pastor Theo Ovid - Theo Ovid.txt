Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who health all thy diseases, who redeemth thy life from destruction, who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies, who satisfied thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles. The Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and piercing. He will not all his child, neither will he keep his anger forever. He had not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heaven is above the earth, so great is his mercy towards them that fear him.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ. I am not the preacher. Uh but I do want to greet you this morning. &gt;&gt; And before you take your seats, I just want to read one scripture. Um St. John 5, a very familiar scripture, but there's something in there I want to pick up as part of the greeting this morning. St. In John 5 from verse one, after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is a Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water, whosoever then first after the troubling of the water, stepped in, was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity 30 and 8 years. When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Willil thou be made whole? The impotent man answered him, "Sir, I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool. But while I am coming, another stepeth down before me." Jesus saith unto him, "Rise, take up thy bed, and walked. And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked. And on the same day was the Sabbath." May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I greet you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's certainly good to be back home. There's no place like home. God bless you, church. I want to acknowledge our pastor Timothy Redhead that's here with us this morning. God bless you, brother Redhead and his sister in Jamaica. God bless you. Certainly happy to have you here with us in fellowship uh this morning. And brother Redhead will be preaching for us on Wednesday night, Lord willing. So make a great effort to be here in the house of the Lord on Wednesday night. And this week is a special week for us. Uh we also have a special weekend of services that's coming up uh this weekend on Saturday at 3:00 p.m. and two services this coming Sunday at 10:00 a.m. and 4 p.m. And I know without a shadow of a doubt God has something in store for us in a really special way. So I greet you from Uganda and from the believers and the saints over in Uganda. They send their love. They sent their greetings to the church here in Henso Tabernacle and the believers here in Trinidad from brother Gideon Beckaso who was a host pastor of the meeting. There were more than maybe 40 50 ministers that were present from different churches from different countries. So it was held in Uganda but there were believers from Kenya, from Congo, from Rwanda. Um so just to name a few and there were 69 churches represented in the meeting and it was quite something to see and I told the host pastor um the western world is not ready for this kind of convention and I'll tell you a bit more about it. I also bring greetings from all of the ministers also our precious brother John Chakone who I had fellowship with John Chakone as well and his son brother David who has his own church as well and brothers from Buna Congo who were there in Uganda as well and what a time in the presence of the Lord to see that all over the world the spirit is moving &gt;&gt; it was my first time in Uganda and I told him it felt at home and um so Uganda is is east Africa many of the meetings that I've been to have been on the western part of of Africa, Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, etc. But my first time in the east, and um you know, one of our deacons messaged me when he saw like the picture, he says, you know, take care with the heat and the dehydration. But that part of Africa is actually colder. So temperatures of 18° in the morning, 19°, so um the environment was was a wonderful environment. Um food and the culture very similar to us. I felt like I was in Tobago because the staple of a lot of the meals was what we call provision and plantin and dasheen and I was like wait a minute this structure the food here is a bit you know um interestingly I didn't see any fast food places except KFC. KFC was like the only one there but all the pizza place stuff we used to um Uganda is known for its agriculture. It's a it's big export and it's big economic driver is agriculture. So everything is organic and natural. And I told my wife, "It's the healthiest few days I've had in a very long time. Everything was healthy. The food was healthy. The food was, you know, but it was such a wonderful time to be with the believers and for the saints, you know." So, both in the in the natural, we we had a lot of healthy food, but the services, I have to tell you, um I've been in meetings all over. I've never been in one with this structure. Um over the days, which was have been Thursday night was the arrival. So Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and by Monday morning, I think there would have been about 17 services I think over those few days. So I messaged a few people and say we need to reook at our convention. I think we we have clearly too much space for it because I've never seen anything like it. You know the meeting started on Thursday night and um one of the pastors from Kenya, brother Guandaro, opened the meeting, a tremendous opening service on Thursday night. And then from Friday service was started at 5:00 a.m. &gt;&gt; So there was a 5:00 a.m. service. This was a they call it the morning glory. You know the host pastor say, you know, you have to wake up in the morning and start the day right. So 5:00 a.m. I thought it was going to be like a the morning devotion, read a psalm, sing a song. It was a fullblown service &gt;&gt; at 5:00 in the morning with the Clarons and that went from 5:00 to like 6:30 and then it was breakfast time and then the next service was 8:00. &gt;&gt; So 8:00 was fullblown preaching service that went to around 10:30 and then they said we can't stop now. Let's get ready for the next service. And just like that we swung into song service again for the third service. So it was two services back to back and then lunch and then next service that flowed into the next service. So I told them after the first day that we made it. We made it. And interestingly as we went in in the next day the exact same pattern. On Saturday was five services again. On Sunday was five services again. Um I ministered three times over the course of the services. Brother Jonathan Martin Julie ministering to us this weekend ahead of us also ministered three times in that meeting. Brother Maduka ministered three times in the meeting and then uh brother Guandaru from Kenya spoke twice and brother Jackson Kaha from Kenya spoke twice as well and then those morning glories were brothers from Congo and different things and everybody was on fire and the last service I have to tell you was jumping and shouting and praising like the first service. So I told the brothers, anything beyond this is rapture, you know, &gt;&gt; but it was such a tremendous time in the presence of the Lord with the worship and it was a youth focus meeting. There were about maybe around 800 or so young people there and it was such a blessing to see young people on fire for God &gt;&gt; and to see a passion for the word, a passion to be in the spirit and they're looking for something, looking for a true experience with God. So again, I wanted to give you a bit of a report that it was a good land. We look forward by the grace of God to being back there in Uganda again. And many of them would love to come here and be able to come for our convention as well as to come and fellowship. Um many of them know you from online. So they have seen you. So if they see you, they they would recognize they know you from on the streaming and and they send their love, their greetings, the song leaders, the ministers, the musicians, you know. So they feel as much a part of you as as when we go there and we are part of them as well. So once more let me greet you on their behalf and and may God richly bless you by the grace of God you know and on that note um while we were there um brother Jonathan Martin had preached and it was such a tremendous blessing and the Lord just connected us in such a special way in the spiritual realm that right away I I called brother Oid and we had a conversation and um you know by the grace of God we will have him here this weekend for us. And I know God has something special for us. &gt;&gt; God has servants of God everywhere. &gt;&gt; And God has servants of God that are cut differently. And Belove preached a message recently uh I think around the end of the convention or thereabouts, um where he played a tape speaking about different administrations of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And what I'm looking for personally is to see God call men around the world. God has men everywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No man could define who is in the fifold ministry. The five ministry is not defined by man. is defined by God. &gt;&gt; God is able to raise up individuals in the east, in the west, in the north, in the south, who could speak English, French, German, Spanish, or some language we've never heard before. But God is the one who is sovereign enough to choose and to pick and to confirm the word with signs, with wonders, with miracles, and with the opening of the word that has already been revealed by the prophet messenger Malachi 4. We don't bring our own message. It's a vindicated message. The message speaks for itself. It is already revealed, fully revealed. So we are happy to be identified with sons and daughters of gods all over the world &gt;&gt; that we may not have seen each other on this side before but when we come together there's a kindred spirit you recognize we were there we kick Lucifer out we had the representation by predestination before there was a bill before there was a mortgage before there was anything else and when we come here on this earth wait a minute we fought back to back there and we can fight back to back here again against sickness against doubt against unbelief against depression against your past, against your mistakes, against your failures, against the things you don't understand, against the losing of your identity. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So after the meeting, I had the opportunity to also preach last Wednesday night in the local church and we had quite a time in the presence of God and I was speaking about the the the divine mystery of your spiritual identity &gt;&gt; to recognize that nothing could change who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are born into a family. So with a punch, you are born in a punch. &gt;&gt; Whether you wear a red shirt, a blue shirt, a green shirt, you can't change the family you're born into. &gt;&gt; And if the devil understands that you are something, you are see his finger. But then then he cannot change who you are. But what he could try to do is make you forget who you are. &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet speak on on on spiritual amnesia. Because if the devil could trick you into you are nobody and you're ordinary and you live your life under the privilege of this revealed word then that's on you. But the job of coming to church is for us to remind you that you are bigger than your problem. That the seed in you greater is he that's in you that he that's in the world. And this message came with your name on it and your past your mistakes your failures your ups and downs have nothing to do with the promise of God and the purpose of God concerning you. So that that's a reason to get comfort. But every service you see your name because your name is your identification. It's the mystery of who you are. &gt;&gt; And your father can't stop it. Your problems can't stop it. Your mistakes can't stop it. Sickness cannot stop it. Nothing present, nothing past, nothing to come could separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus. Because your name is not now being put in the book. Your name has always been there. Who we forneew he called. Who he call he justified. Who we justify, he hath already glorified. is written in the past tense. God is not picking people this morning. You were chosen before the foundation of the world. God is not now waking up looking to see who in Headstone Tabernacle or any tabernacle he could find. His fornowledge already put your name in the book. He knew you'd get the Holy Ghost. He knew you'd have a revival. He knew you would overcome. He knew that no weapon formed against you will prosper. He knew you would come to perfection. He knew you would walk away from sin. He knew you would be restored. He knew you would come to your senses. He knew you had a theophony. He knew the word body is coming. He had a church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I'm excited because God is doing something. God is not a God of disappointment. He's a God of appointment. And I believe God has appointment with each of you this morning. Each of you on Wednesday night, each of you on Saturday service, each of you on this two services this coming Sunday. So don't miss it because I believe church time is short. &gt;&gt; We don't have too much time left. &gt;&gt; You see what's happening around the world &gt;&gt; in the political realm, in the economic realm and all these things. And it's the government, it's this, it's the forex crisis, it's the US ships in the area and all these things. &gt;&gt; Everything is getting into their place. &gt;&gt; But you know what? They can only do limited things until the bride gets into her place. &gt;&gt; God isn't waiting on them. He's waiting on you and I to come to a recognition of who they are. But the parent said the moment the bride gets to know who she is, then the rapture is going to go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we are coming here this morning to get a revelation of who we are in God. And because of who we are, what we are entitled to. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a good time to be a Christian. It's a good time to be on fire. It's a good time to put a smile on your face. It's a good time to spare your shoulders back. It's a good time to lift your head up. It's a good time to know your father is the king. It's a good time to know that all that the father had given me must come. Hallelujah. He's not going to lose one. He's not going to lose your daughter. He's not going to lose your son. He's going to put food in your table. He's going to fill you with the Holy Ghost. He said, "I've never seen the righteous forsaken over beg." &gt;&gt; I'm almost ready before the pastor comes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I want you to raise your expectation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You need to ask God for big things. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "You get what you expect. If you expect a little bit, you get a little bit. You you want a little healing, you could get that. But I want to get big things." &gt;&gt; But the Brandon said, "How could you have faith for the rapture if you can't have faith for divine healing?" Which means divine healing is on the journey to the rapture. You got to believe that the sickness in your body has got to go. It has got to go because he said how you can have faith for the rapture if you don't have faith for divine healing. So it means that rapture in faith is more than the faith for divine healing. It's got to be part of the journey. God is not going to rapture sick people. You're going to be healed before the rapture. You know what I said? This body change, there's a process. The rapture is from the inside out. On the journey to the rapture, oh, you're going to feel a charge in your body. The tiredness not going to affect you no more. That arritis got to go. Hyper pressure got to go. Female condition got to go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We still believe in miracles. We still believe in healing. We still believe in deliverance. We still believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We still believe in a holy life. We still believe in the ability of the Holy Ghost to change a man from the inside out. Can the church say amen? Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let me close out this greeting. I just want to greet you this morning. The pastor is going to preach. Are preaching the pastor this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You read that scripture. And my wife shared something with me on this. You have to thank the Lord when you have a spiritual wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Spiritual husband, &gt;&gt; spiritual friends, &gt;&gt; who can have conversation not just about politics. and about the problems and about what the government do and it do. &gt;&gt; So we sitting there yesterday and she shared something with me and it just opened up &gt;&gt; something that she heard and when I saw it I shared a bit with it with brother as well. This scripture we have preached this many times is a measure of faith. For 38 years this man had kept coming &gt;&gt; because he had a need &gt;&gt; and we preach keep coming because God is going to meet you. &gt;&gt; And that's true. That's powerful that at a certain season the angel will come and stir the water and whoever got into the water first &gt;&gt; will get their healing. Yes. &gt;&gt; But there's something interesting in this and I want us to pay attention in this season to this. This man actually defined two problems. When Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he said unto him, "Wil thou be made whole?" And the man's response was, "I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool." And it there's a question in this for us because here is a man who we cannot question his faithfulness &gt;&gt; because he had proven over 38 years to be consistent in his faith that if he could get into the water, he would be healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we cannot question his faithfulness. We cannot question his belief in healing because by his being present was evidence that he believed. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's something that started to look and and my wife shared with me as a contrast to the crippled man or the lame man who had the four friends &gt;&gt; who open up the roof &gt;&gt; and they brought the sick man and dropped him in front of Jesus. And I wanted to contrast this for a minute between who helps you or who do you help &gt;&gt; because there's a big difference between both men had a condition but one man had four friends &gt;&gt; who made it their business to climb up the roof of the building open up the top while Jesus preaching and dropping this man in front of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Many of us don't realize at some point in time we all need help. &gt;&gt; We could come to church and go back home and say, "Well, I don't want to talk to anybody, but it's important for you to build the right type of relationships. &gt;&gt; It's important for you to invest." So, I asked myself the question, what was the difference between these two men? Because one of them had four friends. even though he could not help himself, they were willing to help him. &gt;&gt; Do you have quality relationships with people that when you come to your crossroad, they would climb the roof of a building &gt;&gt; for you. I want to come back to this man at the pool of Bethesda because over 38 years &gt;&gt; he had no friends. &gt;&gt; And he had to tell Jesus, I have no man to help me. &gt;&gt; The Bible is a book that speaks of what we should do and what we should not do. &gt;&gt; And in these two examples, we see two men who both had needs, who Jesus both ministered to and helped. But one was able to be helped even before Jesus helped &gt;&gt; his four friends brought him to Jesus. And the other man was a different kind of struggle. I asked myself the question, did that man not have children, &gt;&gt; siblings, neighbors, &gt;&gt; co-workers? What kind of life do you live &gt;&gt; that after 38 years of a declining situation there's nobody there to help you? &gt;&gt; I want us to draw reference that in that room around that pool as it were there were people of different conditions. &gt;&gt; Now I have seen people in hospitals and when you look at somebody say now boy your situation is worse than mine so you go first. &gt;&gt; This is the process of triage in a hospital. Nurses are trained to ascertain this is a level one emergency. This is a level five. You have a headache. &gt;&gt; Your foot off your off your body. &gt;&gt; This is a different situation. &gt;&gt; So I asked myself the question over the course of 38 years did this man not build any conversation with anybody else who was there to even convince them you know my situation worse than yours. The reason I'm raising this is the reason God allowed churches to exist &gt;&gt; is not just for people to come to hear the word alone, but it's also to build a network of support &gt;&gt; because we all need help. When you think you are so strong, there will come a point when somebody needs to pray for you, lift you up, or as the case of the other example, carry you to church or you don't hear me this morning. So I want to take this I want to encourage the church. Don't have the mindset that well I come in the church and I when I get the word I go home &gt;&gt; because that is how you build no connections. &gt;&gt; You build no relationship. &gt;&gt; So I want us to cherish the value of relationships and the right kind of relationship. &gt;&gt; Not just doing it because you want help but just by helping somebody else. You don't even know what you will trigger in doing that. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And that's what the prophet preacher with a church that Jesus in the church. A church that stick together. A church that the devil can't shake you. The church that gossip can't live in the church because everyone understand that it's some through the fire, some through the flood, but all through the blood. We go through a trial and testing. But when I'm weak, I need somebody to pray for me. I want to pray for you. You in trouble? Somebody help me. Can the church say amen? So I want you to look at that scripture again and study it. I prefer to be like the man who had the friends who take him through the roof &gt;&gt; because I realize that in this world you cannot live alone. &gt;&gt; If God wanted you to live alone, he'd have been in a hill somewhere and God would speak to you himself. But God built a structure and he put a five-fold ministry in place and he have virtues that need to be tested. Even the virtue of brotherly kindness that could only be tested when you're around people. You can't test brother when you on a mountain by yourself, you on your home in Moses seat judging people and you not meeting nobody &gt;&gt; because the virtue has to be tested by real life situations to see if you could handle stress, handle problem. The who you really are is only tested is only proven under the test. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; So listen. So God did heal both men, &gt;&gt; but I much rather live a life &gt;&gt; that is connected to brethren. &gt;&gt; Connected. There are many of us, we have more connections outside of church than in church. &gt;&gt; We have more connection with unbelievers than with believers. &gt;&gt; You need a friend who will say you're going to church today. &gt;&gt; You need somebody who say don't give up. You need somebody say that what you're wearing is not right. You know it's not right. You could do better. You need a friend who could push you onto perfection. Encourage one another unto love and good works. That's the word of God. Can the church say amen? Can we give the word a shout of praise? I'm finished. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So, are you ready for the word this morning? &gt;&gt; Brother Jason, you can come and sing a song before the pastor comes. God bless you, church. Love you and appreciate you. Amen. Push your but this morning. &gt;&gt; How I love you, Lord. [Music] You're my all and all. I can see your face. [Music] your glory and your grace. And when you speak to me, you set my spirit free. Words can never tell. [Music] Just how I love you, Lord. Ooh. How I love you, Lord. [Music] You're my all and all.

You're my only I can see your face, your glory and your grace and the way you speak to me. You set my spirit free words. Hallelujah. Glory. That's how I just worship him this morning. How I love you, Jesus. Sing. How I love you, Lord. You're my only. I can see your face, your glory, and your grace. And when you speak to me, you set my spirit free. No words can never. Jesus, how I love you. One more time this morning. Jesus, how I love you, Lord. You're my only. [Music] I can see your face. Your glory and your grace [Music] and the way you speak to me. You set my spirit free. The words can never but I love you. [Music] I see your face. The glory and your grace will be victorious. [Music] How I love you. I love you, Lord. You're my only see the glory of your speak to me. You set my spirit free. Words can never tell [Music] how I love you, Lord. Father, we praise you this morning. We thank you. We thank you for your presence. We thank you for your love. We thank you for this grace and your blood that give us this opportunity to access your presence. May you come down among us as we read your word. May you be with us in a special way. In Jesus name I ask it. God bless you. Welcome for blessed by the redhead. Praise God. Amen. Appreciate you. Um we want to turn our Bibles to Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and 28 to 28. 1 John chapter 2 15-17. Revelation 5 1-10. Certainly appreciate brother Kelly South sharing with us &gt;&gt; the things that belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Read in Genesis chapter 1 26-28. And God said, "Let us make man in our image after all likeness. Let him have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, over the cattle, over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them, and God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply, replenish the earth, subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." &gt;&gt; 1 John chapter 2, reading from verse 15. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life is not of the father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever. &gt;&gt; Revelation five. And I saw in the writing of him that sudden thrown a book written within on the backside sea with seven seals. I saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof. And no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book near to look thereon. And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book needed to look thereon. And one of the elders said unto me, weep not. Behold, the land of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, had prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seas thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and the four beasts, and the midst of the elders, to the lamb, as had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne. And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and the four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb, having every one of them hops and golden vials full of all those which are the prayers of the saints. And they sung a new song, saying, Thou worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof, and as thou has slain, and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, tongue, and people, and nation, and has made us unto our God, kings, and priests. and we shall reign on the earth. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we have read your word and I pray that the anointing and inspiration will come. Take me out of the way, Father, and release your spirit to your people with revelation, inspiration, and confirm your word with signs, wonders, and miracles. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated. Praise God. Have you sit down, just give God some praises. Praise God. We have to have some Holy Ghost noise in this place. Where there is God, there is noise. Don't let no quiet Catholic spirit in this message fool you. Don't let no quiet church. You have a quiet Holy Ghost. You don't have no quiet Holy Ghost. Where there's God, there's noise. Where there's God, there's fire. Our God is a consuming fire. He just burn. He'll burn in your seat. He'll burn you in your heart. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Burning in your spirit. Our God is a consuming fire. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So this morning I have a title, Pathway to Dominion. No, it's odd, but this is what I have this morning. Pathway to dominion &gt;&gt; and an inspiration. We shall reign on the earth. &gt;&gt; That's what we have this morning. &gt;&gt; Pathway to dominion and we shall reign on the earth. This word dominion, this word is a Latin comes from dominion. It means property, ownership, lordship. I like that. So you can't have a property without a owner. &gt;&gt; So it's not just you have property, who owns it. So the dictionary meaning is sovereignty control. The power or right of governing and controlling supreme authority &gt;&gt; also territory under control. And in the biblical context, dominion means God-given authority and stewardship. &gt;&gt; This word dominion is what God said when he made man in his image and likeness. He said, "Let them have dominion." &gt;&gt; This in Genesis was given in two parts. man as the who is to have dominion &gt;&gt; and the what part dominion over what. &gt;&gt; So the who and the what was given but not the how part. &gt;&gt; In other words, God say who you &gt;&gt; man in my image. You have dominion &gt;&gt; over the what part? Over the earth &gt;&gt; over every creeping thing on the earth &gt;&gt; have dominion over the fish. over every living have illumin over it. But God didn't say just yet how &gt;&gt; Abramham said this &gt;&gt; he gave him a bride second Adam. He gave him first the first Adam bride. She fell. He gave the second Adam a bride. She fell. Why? She's a byproduct. She is not original. The bride today is a byproduct. She calls herself the bride. But what she is, she's made up of material of organization and not the word. Now the bride of Adam was a type, the second Adam's bride. Now Adam's bride could not wait. God had told Adam and Eve, "Multiply and replenish the earth." It was an uncommon thing, &gt;&gt; a promise. So this son that was in dominion, &gt;&gt; this son that was in God's image and likeness was supposed to reproduce other sons, &gt;&gt; just like that, &gt;&gt; just like him. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; But they were supposed to wait for further revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As to how. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Multiply and replenish the earth." It was an oncoming thing, a promise. &gt;&gt; She was not his wife as yet. He had never lived with her. &gt;&gt; And the bride of Christ is not his wife yet. &gt;&gt; The wedding supper is to take place. &gt;&gt; She got in a hurry for what Eve she crossed her seed. She mingled with the serpent seed and what she brought forth was child of death. &gt;&gt; And she perverted every child after that. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. When the church of Jesus Christ was perverted in the time of Rome after a virgin birth and was given to Christ at Pentecost, what did she do? She cross over with the Roman dogma. &gt;&gt; A woman engaged a fine young clean man and before they come together she's found pregnant by somebody else. Then her own seed is betrod. Her own body which is betrod to her boyfriend. Her engaged husband is found full of seed of another man. What a disgrace. That is exactly what Adam found and that is what Christ found. They couldn't wait. And that's what the matter with the people today. They can't wait for the real Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to take the church in position. &gt;&gt; They have to manufacture something. &gt;&gt; They have to work up something. &gt;&gt; They can't wait for the Lord for the real manifestation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ making himself known among the people &gt;&gt; because he promised to come among us. &gt;&gt; Not not no he promised to come among us. He said and then we are worshiping the living Christ. him moving in and out among us. Then we have to come in expectation for that and preparation for that. Oh, give the Lord some praises this morning. Hallelujah. Both preparation and expectation for the Lord to come among us because one day he will come suddenly into his temple. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Hundreds of years they quoting scripture in the Old Testament from in in in a scribe and Pharisees, but one day Jesus walked into the temple &gt;&gt; and he said nothing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was silent for 18 years and then God broke the silence by giving Jesus an experience on the bank of the Jordan River. &gt;&gt; When John was baptizing, the Holy Ghost filled him without measure that he was anointed to go into the wilderness to face Lucifer himself to overcome all that was in the world to overcome the lust of the eyes to overcome the lust of the flesh to overcome the pride of life. He had to have dominion over himself. Oh, give the Lord a shout before he could take full power. And I want to say to you this morning, you have to have dominion over you. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. Everybody want power over somebody. Everybody want power over something. But the Bible speak about the order &gt;&gt; or the process or the pathway &gt;&gt; to this dominion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; When Jesus came &gt;&gt; his first sermon, &gt;&gt; give the who which is you &gt;&gt; must be born again. Amen. &gt;&gt; He give the who, &gt;&gt; he give the what. &gt;&gt; You must be born again. And he give the how. &gt;&gt; By the word and the spirit. &gt;&gt; So he give all three. &gt;&gt; You. &gt;&gt; Who is that? You &gt;&gt; must be &gt;&gt; born again. &gt;&gt; By the word &gt;&gt; and by the spirit. &gt;&gt; So we identify &gt;&gt; this birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is word and spirit. Not just word alone. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 1:23, being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When the lamb took the book, &gt;&gt; John make a big declaration. &gt;&gt; He said, "We shall reign on the earth." &gt;&gt; In other words, we shall rule on the earth. &gt;&gt; It's a commission from God. &gt;&gt; It is what was original. It was what God tell man in the beginning. Man wasn't overly subject to the elements. The elements was supposed to be subject to man. Man was supposed to be in charge. Man was supposed to be in power. Man fell from that. And God purposed in his heart to restore man back to dominion, back into authority, back into power. God would not cancel that. It already gone out of his mouth. He's going to restore it. And when the lamb took the book, because John had a revelation, that book, this same seven seed book, this same seven thunder book is connected to dominion and power and authority. This book is connected to man getting back to Eden. Oh, the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have to have this book to make the pathway or to make a road to get us back on track. We are going to get back on track. The whole creation is groaning, moaning for the masters to step forward. Okay, the Lord I shout. God called sons. God restored sons. Sons in dominion, &gt;&gt; sons in authority and power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This word reign, &gt;&gt; the exercise or possession of sovereign power. &gt;&gt; You more hear it with queens and kings and sound like that. Reign is to be predominant. &gt;&gt; Reign, there's a difference between reign and dominion. &gt;&gt; Dominion speaks of authority, control, and power. Reign speaks of exercise or duration of ruling. So this king reigned for so many years &gt;&gt; and that one reign for so many years. Hallelujah. And he Jesus shall reign forever and ever and ever. &gt;&gt; And he will be crowned king of kings and lord of lords. &gt;&gt; You can't reign over nothing. That makes no sense. You have to reign over a a a kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's where the kingdom king over a domain. &gt;&gt; That's where the word come from. &gt;&gt; A king over a domain. That's a kingdom. So God have to release something. Let's call it for now inheritance &gt;&gt; and have sons because it don't have make sense if you have an inheritance. Brother Kelly spoke about guys across there with businesses and have no heir &gt;&gt; and and this is third generation businesses and there's no son &gt;&gt; if they think out of the box they could adopt one &gt;&gt; but there are no sons to carry on business die business close. &gt;&gt; Well God not to close that business. God not in that at all. You know, after Abraham is Isaac, after Isaac is Jacob, Jacob and and so on and so on, God have a continuity. You know, when Elijah about to go, he pick up Elisha. God making sure a man in place, you know, when Moses, he say now Moses, my servant is dead. Now Joshua take them people over. God not making a missing a beat. You know, if he not this generation, he raise up another generation. Oh, give the Lord a shout. God missing a beat. You know, God moving on. If you don't want to move, he's moving on. When that pillar of fire move up, you have to move with the cloud. You have to move with the pillar of fire. Well, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God's plan is to bring back man in position &gt;&gt; to reign &gt;&gt; and to rule. Brother, he said, you know that man in the beginning when God made him, he didn't make him to be doctorred. He had his own doctrine in him. &gt;&gt; He was equipped. He was a unit of his own. Then healing does not come from any outside resource. &gt;&gt; It had to come from inside. &gt;&gt; Now we can take outside aids and to kill germs or whatever it is. We can take hands and cut each other and piece out and something like appendix and bat tooth or something like that. But healing does not come from anything that you apply. Healing only comes by the power that's within yourself &gt;&gt; to build back the tissue that has been torn from the place have been taken out. &gt;&gt; Therefore, healing is in you. &gt;&gt; Now listen close and think hard. Watch. Man in the beginning when he was made a man, man is a god. &gt;&gt; Small G. He is absolutely a god. Small G. For he was made in the image of God. That's big G. &gt;&gt; Being a son of God, then he's an heir to all that God is. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope that's reached you this morning. We have been talking about inheritance and so on. Inheritance. If for somebody, you know, &gt;&gt; they don't write a will and there's nobody for it. Um, there nobody. This is for you. The fact that there's inheritance mean that there's somebody &gt;&gt; to inherit it. &gt;&gt; You don't work for inheritance. &gt;&gt; You are given an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; When Jesus died was to pay for what God put in that thing for you. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, a son of God, here we go, is a heir of all that God is. And man was given a domain and the domain was the earth. &gt;&gt; You have power over the fishes, over the f of the air, over everything. He could speak and everything had to obey him because he was a god within himself. &gt;&gt; Not universal god. &gt;&gt; But I mean he's the god of heaven and earth. But he was a ruler of his domain. &gt;&gt; He was a king, &gt;&gt; a king ruler. &gt;&gt; That was man. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. What did the Bible say? Thou has made us kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth. That has not been cancelled or erased. Give the Lord a shout. God, I want to hear a shout on that one. God has not cancelled that. Thou has made us, not we made ourselves, you have made us &gt;&gt; kings and priests and we shall make reign on the earth. It's not what you are, it's what God has made you. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And if it's anything you have to know, inheritance, you don't have to be deserving. You don't have to be the best child. You don't have to be nothing. All you have to know is that your name is on that deed. And it's written that this is for you. This is for you. This is for you. And once you know by revelation what is for you, you have a right, what's that word right? To make your claims. [Applause] You are making your claims based based upon what has been left for you &gt;&gt; or released for you, &gt;&gt; given to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he was a king. &gt;&gt; King ruler that was man and even in his fallen state now we see that we see how man conquers. Man conquer space. Man conquer the air. Man man is something else. Yes, &gt;&gt; even with technology now, man is a conqueror. &gt;&gt; He's an achiever. &gt;&gt; So, it's very tough to see men or woman without ambition. &gt;&gt; Without drive. &gt;&gt; It's a sickening thing &gt;&gt; where you find yourself in idle mode. &gt;&gt; You're just idling. You're not It can't going away. You're idling. It's not going into gear. You're not putting it in drive. The island is what you call it M. Idle well p like in a traffic jam and no and and and no traffic jam you know that come like a man in the market say don't push to push don't rush don't rush everybody will get and nobody there but he advertising in a dynamic way don't push to everybody going to get there's not a soul in front of him all right let's Abraham confessed he was a pilgrim and stranger all the days of his life. He looked for that city and make us build his God. Moses drifted away from Egypt, got out into the wilderness, was living fine. He was living by the mountain, lovely wife, little boy Gersham to fall air to all Jethro sheep and that that was all right. He was going just drifting along with ease of tide. Israel down there in trouble crying. God had elected him to deliver the people and he got away from it. Your family in trouble. You in trouble. You know people in trouble and you're still drifting at ease. This is it here. Now that's what the matter with many of our churches today. God called us to a ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; God call us to be his people. Write it with me. &gt;&gt; As you hear it, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; God called us to believe in signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; God called us to perform &gt;&gt; signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; He called us to do that. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I think I want to read that over again. &gt;&gt; God called us to be his people. &gt;&gt; And the church, say, "Amen." Don't just shake your head. &gt;&gt; Open your mouth and say, "Amen." I'm going to say it again. God called us to be his people. &gt;&gt; God called us to believe in signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; God called us to perform signs and wonders. He called us to do that. &gt;&gt; And we are drifting too far away from it. &gt;&gt; So why shouldn't we preach it? &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we call for it? Why shouldn't we pray and ask God for it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What we need is another visitation of God. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; See, send the vision of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; We are drifting too far away like Moses did. Moses was all right back there. He was having a good living. The church today has got bigger building, better churches, better dressed people, better living people ever had. But brother, that's not the thing. &gt;&gt; We have got to victory. You got to fight. We have got to do something for the kingdom of God. There was Moses living luxuriously walking down one morning and God spoke to him out of a burning bush. That man was changed from that time on. What a radical thing that causes you to do whenever you find God. Look at Moses run, kill one Egyptian, run out in the desert. And there he is next morning after he met God in the burning bush. His wife sitting a straddle in a mule, little Gisham on a hip, whiskers hanging down that low, sticking his hand, where you going, Moses going to Egypt to take over a one-man invasion. But he done it. He did it because God said so. He did it because he had faith. Oh, glory to God. He did it because God said so. Do you know what God said? You have to know what God said to tell the devil what God said. And God can't lie. God is not a man that would lie. If God say going to revive you, he going to revive you. If God say going to heal you, he going to heal you. If God deliver you, he going to deliver you. God cannot lie. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Right with me now. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; When God speaks to a man, &gt;&gt; he has faith. &gt;&gt; So maybe people not hearing God or God not speaking to them. &gt;&gt; But when God speaks to a man, &gt;&gt; he has faith. &gt;&gt; And he has ambition. &gt;&gt; There's two things happen when God speaks to a man. He give you faith and ambition. Ambition is when you have big expectation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ambition pushes you past yourself, past your fears, past your shy, past all the excuses you have. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Yeah, but I talk about desire, expecting great things and big things. God want you to have that &gt;&gt; because it's part of ambition. &gt;&gt; Your ambition can't just be to pass through school. You want to get your exams, papers. &gt;&gt; You want to be successful in your subjects. &gt;&gt; You want to get good results. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your ambition be you don't want to be also run. You want to win the race. &gt;&gt; So you run to win. &gt;&gt; You don't run to participate. You run to win. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So when God speaks to a man, he has faith &gt;&gt; and he has ambition &gt;&gt; and he has a purpose. &gt;&gt; When God speaks to a man, he gives him a purpose. &gt;&gt; When God speaks to a man, he gives him ambition. &gt;&gt; That's when God speaks to man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If God hasn't spoken to you yet, ask God this in the service to speak to you &gt;&gt; to give your faith and ambition &gt;&gt; and to give you a purpose. So when you wake up in the morning, you wouldn't wake up in the morning like in your traffic jam as said and you're in gear. You wake up with a purpose. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You wake up to come to give God praise. David said, "I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of God." &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I was." &gt;&gt; They had to drag me. I was glad when they said unto me. &gt;&gt; Let's go. When God speaks to a man, he gives him ambition. When God speaks to a man, he gives him faith to do it &gt;&gt; to accomplish &gt;&gt; or to achieve what his purpose in life is. &gt;&gt; And God called him to do it. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise and amen. Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I remember when we were renting high up there in Shine's building and one day one person come say but Barcel church and that time I think the come Lord I said I don't have time to build a church but Lord coming soon and I you know and then somebody has come to me but you why you know same day now these two people have a choice I'm hearing two different people bringing so I went and pray I said Lord what are you saying to me are you trying to get these people to tell me to look this way. And that is how I changed my mindset &gt;&gt; from saying renting to looking for a place. Then I said, Lord, if we have to get a place, I don't want two transportations. I want when you come, you could get to the place. I don't want to come to Sandy Grandandy and then go somewhere else. So we started look around and saw and there was a place we found looking good. And my wife just I put this way. She hated it. But that was going to be a second transportation. She just didn't like it at all. Well, well, you know what that means? No go. But the prayer was, I want a place that we don't need a second transportation. And we got here then we're going to build and we going to do it without funds. &gt;&gt; I remember I said which man would build a house without the cost. But I used to miss it. That was the man because we never even called the course. But I shame drew the building all the size that was legally correct for the size and everything else. And then we started and we got help here, help here. People came and after the building finished, it disappeared. We don't know where they going. But God wanted this done &gt;&gt; because there was a purpose behind it. &gt;&gt; And God gave us faith. God gave us ambition. And God gave us purpose. &gt;&gt; And here we are. And to go forward, we have we have to have faith. We have to ambition. We have to have purpose because God want to take us further. Oh, give the Lord a shout. This is not the landing day, you know. No, we now getting started. This is the launching part. We now about to get Oh, God. Did you hear me this morning? I want to hear a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; God was waiting for you to be here. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. God was waiting for you in your seat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And when this church was built up, I think I was 38 years old. &gt;&gt; At that time, nobody was building upstairs, downstairs, but then that was well my heart. There was little complainers and fussers in the church saying, "Why you go be flat and this and that and thing and that." But they didn't have the vision. &gt;&gt; They were not seeing what I was seeing. why they didn't go and build flat. &gt;&gt; God talked to them, God spoke to me. &gt;&gt; So I had the vision &gt;&gt; of what I wanted to see &gt;&gt; and here it is today. &gt;&gt; If I had studied those voices and those negative people because it cost less and this and that, I followed them. But I wasn't following them. &gt;&gt; I was following God. &gt;&gt; And this is what we have to do. When you hear from God, you walk in what God has spoken. You walk in what God has unfolded because God can't lie. I remember when you were in Kaiw and I told them God told me that I will be in standing granny after a couple of months a brother come and tell me brother say nobody believe that you know I said it doesn't matter if nobody believe that if God said that God big enough to bring it to pass. Praise God. God don't need your opinion. God don't need your suggestion. God don't need your idea. If God said we're going to be here, we're going to be here. If God say we're going to have a revival, we got a revival. If God say power going to be in the church, power going to be in the church. If God said the sick going to be healed and the blind going to see and the deaf going to hear and the going to walk and the pillar of fire going to hang over the building, God can't lie. Hallelujah. God will confirm his word, but he has to have a people that he going to confirm his word by and through. Give the Lord a shout. He said, "By and through the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised in this hour." Glory to God. So you're not here by chance. You have a purpose behind you being here. There's a purpose behind your life. There's a purpose behind your failure and success. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. Glory to God. Do you hear what I said? &gt;&gt; There's a purpose behind your failures and success. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. All right. &gt;&gt; When God speaks to a man, he gives him faith to do it. &gt;&gt; To accomplish or achieve what his purpose in life is what God called him to do. He called us &gt;&gt; to be in the church of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What did David said? How come this man defy the armies &gt;&gt; of the living God? &gt;&gt; He said defy the army. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of &gt;&gt; the living God. &gt;&gt; Who is this uncircumcised Philistine? &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; When are you going to recognize who you are? &gt;&gt; As part of God's choice in this hour. &gt;&gt; Because who he for you, he called. &gt;&gt; If he didn't phone you, he can't call you. He only call you because he knew you before. &gt;&gt; Well, give the Lord a shout. I ain't talking about your struggles. I'm not talking about your weakness. I am talking about the call. The call. Who he found you, he called? That's Bible. That's Bible. That's Bible. Who he call it justified. Justified as if you never did it. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. Hallelujah. That's Bible. That's Bible. Hallelujah. Who he justified, he has already glorified. If God be for us. If God be for us. &gt;&gt; I don't care what other brothers say. This minister say, this pastor say, liars. If God Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? Which Philistine, which demon, which devil going to stop us from marching forward on what? Christian soldiers marching onto war with the cross of Jesus going on before like a mighty army moves the church of God. Brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod. Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; We are moving on. &gt;&gt; We are moving forward. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Huh?

[Applause] Let's believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; For he said &gt;&gt; this Jesus said &gt;&gt; all things. &gt;&gt; Shout out all things &gt;&gt; are possible to them that believe &gt;&gt; not some things. &gt;&gt; I don't think that's strike yet.

To them. &gt;&gt; Not the minister. To them. To them that believe all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "I am glad for your sake. &gt;&gt; I was not there." &gt;&gt; He message Lazarus sleeping. &gt;&gt; Next message Lazarus is dead &gt;&gt; and he's still moving &gt;&gt; in a groove. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

All things are possible. Where have you laid him? &gt;&gt; Roll away the stone. I am the resurrection. [Applause] [Applause] Mary M when they hear roll away the stone. What do you think she doing for God? &gt;&gt; Help me man help me was in that so excited for a word from the Lord to roll away the stone. Say sister pushing stone. &gt;&gt; Then brothers go and help. Then everybody pushing stone too because Jesus said roll it away. &gt;&gt; He say you have to roll it. Only you alone roll it. Everybody come and roll it. But because somebody inside there is locked up. Somebody in the house of hell. Somebody needs to get out. Some family member we see need to see delivered. Somebody sick need to be healed. Okay. The Lord has shout in the house. Somebody bound need to go free this morning. Roll away the stone. Roll away the unbelief. &gt;&gt; Roll away the negativity. &gt;&gt; Roll away your doubts, your questions, your fears. &gt;&gt; Roll it away. &gt;&gt; See what the Lord will do. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So Moses when God finished with him, he had ambition. &gt;&gt; Never was the same after that. &gt;&gt; He had ambition. He had something to work forward to. &gt;&gt; That's how I want you to come to church. &gt;&gt; Come to church with something &gt;&gt; you're looking forward to. &gt;&gt; Come to church with a fiery expectation. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. If your husband giving problems that he will be delivered. If your wife giving problems that she'll be delivered. If your children giving problem that they will be delivered. If your house are problems that the house will be delivered. But you have to come here not empty. You have to come here with something. There are people came to brand meeting with something in their heart. People people lucky to get a a number to come on the platform &gt;&gt; and when they reaching the platform no faith &gt;&gt; you got to tell me your name from so and so and your house number so and so and your brother is this and your father is this and all kind then they have we we &gt;&gt; and he is there &gt;&gt; and somebody sitting congregation with faith &gt;&gt; pulling the pillar of fire right off the platform and Bam have to move with the pillar of fire.

Jesus just healed you. Rise up and heal her. Fire start to move all over the building there now. &gt;&gt; He come back here.

Hallelujah. Glory to God. I feel the pull this morning. Glory to God. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. All things are possible. Glory to God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Sometime God has do some shocking things, you know. Sometime he has moved suddenly when you don't even expect him. He just moved like that. Tell you, &gt;&gt; you think God tell Peter everything was going to unfold when he went to Cornelius's house. God had to hijack Peter and tell him eat, rise and eat. Give Peter a vision. Change Peter mind and thinking about eating unclean meat and whatnot because God preparing him to face the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; When Peter come out the vision so man outside calling for Peter plenty Peters in those days you know one in Japer &gt;&gt; specific you going the wrong Peter wrong results you know watch them Peters you know &gt;&gt; make sure you get the right one. When Peter come down and said he said he he gone down to Cornia's house and he be to testify &gt;&gt; he doesn't know what exactly was going to move. &gt;&gt; He be to testify about Jesus. All of a sudden fire fell &gt;&gt; and they were filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; When Peter went back Peter give the testimony. He said the same Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; that we received them people received. &gt;&gt; Not a different Holy Ghost. Not a minor Holy Ghost. Not a mini Holy Ghost. Not a message Holy Ghost. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Same. &gt;&gt; Same. &gt;&gt; Same means same. &gt;&gt; I don't have to go for a dictionary to explain what same is. &gt;&gt; Same signs, &gt;&gt; same wonders, same miracles, same power, same healing, same deliverance, same breakthrough, same just mean same. Take that message world. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house, brother. I feel like a bird. Nobody cut me, holding the coail. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I feel like jumping. My God, I don't know about you. I feel like jumping. 67 and jumping. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let they say to you dry up &gt;&gt; part of me dip in oil &gt;&gt; and part of me on fire &gt;&gt; and the oil I am the wick now the wick just &gt;&gt; just oil just pumping up so and light you on fire stop that you had to take me out of the oil first &gt;&gt; that's a tough one &gt;&gt; all right so Moses was never the same &gt;&gt; he had something to look forward to so if I'm sick in this building here I am looking forward to my healing. &gt;&gt; I ain't looking to thank God for my sickness. Lord, thank you, Lord. My mother had it. My father had my grandfather had it. What? What kind of praise is that? &gt;&gt; What kind of foolishness is that? That what God want you to pray and praise. &gt;&gt; You thank God for your healing. &gt;&gt; You thank him in advance. &gt;&gt; You thank him because you know he is able. &gt;&gt; You thank him. Let heaven get disturbed. &gt;&gt; There see she acting like a crazy woman. She praised him and nothing happened yet. Mary didn't wait for a feeling. You know, I wonder if it's for when we pregnant and and Mary wasn't that, you know. Once the angel said that what you have going to be the Christ she ran to Elizabeth hey news girl news. Where's the news? A angel appeared to me and tell me the Christ and his name is called Jesus. John inside Mary. John inside Elizabeth belly move. When John hear Jesus he say aha. &gt;&gt; He say amen. &gt;&gt; He say hallelujah. John give a kick in that stomach. Oh glory to God. You didn't hear me this morning. don't move at all. But when he had Jesus, I tell you, devils will run, demons will tremble. When the church get into step to produce Jesus Christ, the same yesterday is dead forever. Oh, glory to God. Give the Lord a shout. If you never shout before, let the men in the house give a shout. [Applause] Glory &gt;&gt; brother. &gt;&gt; All the days of his life, &gt;&gt; he served God to deliver those people. &gt;&gt; He wasn't concerned about that. &gt;&gt; As long he was getting along, all right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God said he looking to buy more furniture. &gt;&gt; He just want to visit the car, &gt;&gt; the new car department. You can look at make a down payment on a car and God come down to say I have heard. I know you ain't hearing nothing. You're looking at wheels. But I have heard &gt;&gt; the cries of my people &gt;&gt; and I have come down to deliver &gt;&gt; and I am sending you. &gt;&gt; You see whenever God come down he had to send somebody. &gt;&gt; Whenever God come down he have to use somebody. [Music] &gt;&gt; Today when the church is sick the sickness is piled up and the people because of intellectual pride and so forth is getting away from divine healing. You hear what he's saying? &gt;&gt; In other words, they're ducking divine. &gt;&gt; They're getting away from Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; God hears the cry of his people. &gt;&gt; Somebody has got to go. &gt;&gt; Couple of years ago, I shared this and I want to share it back. I felt like to bring this back this morning. A word called inertia. &gt;&gt; One time I was talking about action is caused. &gt;&gt; For something that is in action, you have to cause it. &gt;&gt; There are some people watching what happening. They may participate just watching watching &gt;&gt; they are the watchers. There are some people that wondering what happening. &gt;&gt; They know going on. They just wondering. And the third set is those who causing things to happen. &gt;&gt; Well, I want to be part of the third set. &gt;&gt; Causing things to happen. &gt;&gt; So action is cause. &gt;&gt; But inertia is a tendency to do nothing or to remain unchanged. All right. &gt;&gt; A word come from the pullpit and you move. &gt;&gt; Say, "Praise God." And your mouth tight. &gt;&gt; Raise your hands and give God a shot of praise. You're not even your finger move. &gt;&gt; A tendency to do nothing &gt;&gt; or to remain unchanged. The the the synonyms of this word is inactivity, &gt;&gt; inaction, &gt;&gt; inattentiveness, &gt;&gt; passivity, &gt;&gt; apathy, &gt;&gt; malaise, stagnation, &gt;&gt; dullness. In physics, this word inertia, a property of matter by which it continues in its existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line &gt;&gt; unless that state is changed by an external force. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So if they're going one today, &gt;&gt; one tomorrow, &gt;&gt; for the rest of your life, &gt;&gt; they're going so for the rest of their life. One today. &gt;&gt; The worst person to work with, you're working on something and somebody going packs, packs. It's best you work by yourself. You know that is so demotivating. &gt;&gt; You hustling, you're hustling, telling Pax. &gt;&gt; Like examining the nail, hit it packs. You're watching the hammer to hit it packs. This is a lazy spirit. &gt;&gt; Listen, I appreciate your help, but you'll be better home. &gt;&gt; Your help is needed elsewhere. In physics, the property of matter by which it continues in existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless that state is changed by an external force. Probably if love don't get it desperate. Two accidents, &gt;&gt; roof blow off, &gt;&gt; conditions will &gt;&gt; that why people get in conditions &gt;&gt; all the time they in praying or what not. They hang up on hospital bed stick up in the air drips on one side. Oh God, &gt;&gt; you shall be praying oh God long time. &gt;&gt; You should be praying for help long time. &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Don't just continue continue until an external force change the circumstance. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That man who daughter was vexed that sick. He didn't want to go he was a big shot in the scheme of things you know he couldn't take it no more. Lord my master my daughter sick dying &gt;&gt; while he talking somebody come she dead now &gt;&gt; don't waste the time &gt;&gt; and he tell telling man I I go wake her up &gt;&gt; because the level of his faith is completely different. The eyes of Jesus faith is completely different from what man see. And you keep seeing things and going in what you see. Why don't you ask God for his eyes? &gt;&gt; Some of you never even pray that God give me your eyes in this situation. You're using your father eye, your mother eye, your wife eye, your husband eye. You're using your all eye, but you're not asking God for his eyes because you still want to do your own thing. The reason some people don't want to come to bring the things to God or the ministry of a prayer is because they want to continue in the same state &gt;&gt; in a straight line. &gt;&gt; They don't want to hear anything different than what they have in the heart. There's a statement, a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion. Still, &gt;&gt; we're not trying to convince you against your will. the power required to overcome friction and inertia in moving past. All right. Disincclination to move or act. So when the mirror comes to you, instead of looking at the mirror and seeing yourself, you find fault with the man holding up the mirror. When the word come is a mirror &gt;&gt; and the mirror comes for you to see look look at here and you doing so why you brother over saying that somebody telling someone me this morning why you on that road you got to go somewhere else no is this the mirror &gt;&gt; take a look in it now tell me what you seeing &gt;&gt; you see you see how few people say amen &gt;&gt; the mirror we you want you want a bigger mirror then &gt;&gt; you only seeing your face you want to see whole body physics. &gt;&gt; The tendency of a body to preserve its state of rest or uniform motion unless acted upon &gt;&gt; by an external force. Lack of movement or activity, especially when movement or activity is wanted or needed. A feeling of not having the energy &gt;&gt; or desire &gt;&gt; that is needed to move or change. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, you're fixed. As my friend from Green say they lock say they lock it they lock and sometime when they lock the stuff up like that they have the key to that you know &gt;&gt; you can't open that they lock Jesus after 18 years of silence when his seed got dead ripe. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; In other words, he can't go down on the Jordan River age 27. &gt;&gt; He had to hit 30 &gt;&gt; to move. &gt;&gt; So age 30, he's heading down in line. John already get a word. The one upon whom you see that dove resting &gt;&gt; because some does dove rest and move him &gt;&gt; and the man give my testimony. Oh say the dove rest on me. Where do now dove rest? I ain't doubting that you know. But has it remained? &gt;&gt; Because the Bible John said the one who see the dove rest and remain. &gt;&gt; So it have dove resting and taking off &gt;&gt; because a dove thinking is a is a lamb. Why do lamb soul is because that was the time they was being stroked this way and the cat ping meow meow. &gt;&gt; But then the prophet say stroke it the other way. And when they get his throat the other way, that is when the growl come &gt;&gt; and the wolf come and that's when they the dove take off. &gt;&gt; So friends, we have to be in a condition we want that dove to remain. &gt;&gt; We want that dove to abide. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So Jesus, he wasn't idle in those 18 years. &gt;&gt; He was in the word. &gt;&gt; He was studying the father's business. He said so when he was age 12. &gt;&gt; So he knew his promises. &gt;&gt; He knew his scriptures. So when they invited him for to read, he found the place. &gt;&gt; Some people can't even find the Bible. &gt;&gt; But Jesus found the place where it was written. &gt;&gt; If they can't find the Bible, you can't find the place in the Bible. Do you know where your Bible is? &gt;&gt; Don't answer that. Don't answer. Don't raise your hand. Tell me where. &gt;&gt; So he found the place where it's written and he read the scripture and said this day &gt;&gt; this scripture is &gt;&gt; fulfilled in your air. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is where they threw him out. &gt;&gt; But then something happened to Jesus. &gt;&gt; He was led by the spirit &gt;&gt; into the wilderness &gt;&gt; to demonstrate dominion &gt;&gt; by the word &gt;&gt; to overcome the lust of the eyes, &gt;&gt; the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, which summarizes all that is in the world. So all that is in the world is connected to three these three steps or these three temptations or these three tests. Lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh, pride of life. &gt;&gt; But he proved he had dominion over it. &gt;&gt; The big hit was all these kingdoms are mine to give to whoever I want. Satan talking very confident &gt;&gt; if he would only bow down &gt;&gt; and worship &gt;&gt; because that is his original desire &gt;&gt; in heaven to worship. He wanted to be like God &gt;&gt; and Jesus denied him that &gt;&gt; and stayed with the word &gt;&gt; his flesh was hungering his appetite. &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God turn the stone into bread. &gt;&gt; It's 40 days he's fasting. &gt;&gt; The devil know he's hungry. &gt;&gt; Every demon in hell know he's hungry. He's a man. We supposed to live off the earth. &gt;&gt; He know he is hungry. But he had to have power &gt;&gt; over his appetite. He had to have power over his flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I buffet myself." Hal to bring my flesh in subjection. Least after I preach the gospel, I perish. Oh, give the Lord some praises. God can't do that for you. You have got to do something about you, your decisions, your actions. You can't just be living in the emotions. Everything is emotional. Carry on. Like if you're immature, like you're a child. You ain't got sweetie. You ain't got this. It carry on. &gt;&gt; Deny your child something and see what's going on now. It's havoc in the house. &gt;&gt; If your child normal cuz that's what children do. &gt;&gt; They want this. They want it now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we have to have this dominion. &gt;&gt; Amen. over self. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; We have to get to this dominion. &gt;&gt; You have to begin to visualize it and see it as part of your Christian walk. &gt;&gt; You have to take a hold of it. That is why God put them seven virtues &gt;&gt; to give us a means as to how to get out of the way &gt;&gt; by these seven virtues. That's what temperance is for and patience is for and godliness is for. How much marriages would have been so different if that tongue we going to get to it &gt;&gt; was correctly silenced? &gt;&gt; I expect much amen for that. So when that maniac man came up to brother brand and say you snake in the grass look look the devil spewing words. If you can't handle words you you lose it or not. &gt;&gt; If you can handle you snake in the grass you hypocrite. The devil calling Barama a hypocrite &gt;&gt; in that man. You snake in the grass, you hypocrite. &gt;&gt; The man have a repetition of beating up preachers. As far as that spirit concerned is another one go and get licks. &gt;&gt; But Abraham had 400 men. How much men behind him there? All them jump off the platform. &gt;&gt; All them all in glory. Hallelujah. Amen. The word when that demon run out there and start to challenge brother. All them soldiers behind there them going marching not to war. You know them getting marching straight out the platform. Straight out the platform. Leave this little man 5 foot something standing there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And brother stand up there and said &gt;&gt; because &gt;&gt; you have challenged the spirit of God, &gt;&gt; you shall fall over my feet. &gt;&gt; He can't say fall my feet and roll on the platform. &gt;&gt; Stand right there. &gt;&gt; He's standing in his position. &gt;&gt; He is standing under authority. &gt;&gt; He is standing in dominion. He's not speaking to the man. He's speaking to a spirit because &gt;&gt; you That's not not the man. There's a spirit in a man because you have challenged the spirit of God. You shall fall under my feet. &gt;&gt; Fall over my feet. &gt;&gt; The man come up at the platform and when the man raised his hand, he said, "Come out of him." &gt;&gt; Amen. Spin around and fall on Abraham feet. &gt;&gt; Had to take him off Bram. &gt;&gt; All them ministers jump home. Them should have them should have a boxing ring and said, "Come. Don't touch that prophet. They they shall be so if they cast at least fight &gt;&gt; at least hold on the man wrestle the man or something. So all them fellas run straight out. &gt;&gt; That prophet stood there &gt;&gt; because he knew his sunship. &gt;&gt; He knew his godship. &gt;&gt; He knew we getting back to Eden. &gt;&gt; He knew he was the first example seed son &gt;&gt; in this hour to demonstrate what we have to display. The devils are coming. The maniacs coming and we have to withstand them. We have to have what it takes for the channel of the hour. If those ministers think for all these years we just be behind the pulpit saying word word word. They're wrong. You know &gt;&gt; something is about to shift. &gt;&gt; Something is about to move. &gt;&gt; It started. &gt;&gt; I believe it can start today. You know, &gt;&gt; oh give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many time you hear me say the bull coming? And the bull don't want hear about no mysteries and vials and praise and thunders and seals and thing and know only one language the bull understands the language of love &gt;&gt; and if you don't have it that bull coming for you get you're getting frightened now &gt;&gt; but the bull's still coming &gt;&gt; if you're fighting the bull's still coming if you're not frightening it's still coming &gt;&gt; the bull is on his way give the Lord some praises but a bride is on the way there will be a super church there will be a super race as we near the headstone stone. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You asked brother a question, brother Abraham. How could you know what you know and go among them brethren? &gt;&gt; He said, "Knowledge know what they believe." &gt;&gt; No, it's in their heart, &gt;&gt; hoping someday. In other words, he was showing that these virtues are now operational &gt;&gt; inside of him. &gt;&gt; That he could do go where no other person going to go. So how people want to tell you where to go, &gt;&gt; who to talk to. &gt;&gt; You can't talk to this one. You can't talk to this one. &gt;&gt; Talk to the bees. Tell them to don't talk to the bees. He talk to the bees and all. Even bees get in language. Bees just go around and and just settle yourself. &gt;&gt; Talking to bull. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Demonstrating the power of a restored Eden &gt;&gt; is already back on the earth &gt;&gt; because the book has come down. No man have to go up for the book. So no man can come and make a revelation that is not written hidden and all kind of thing like that to bring it down. Now the book already come down &gt;&gt; and brother Ram demonstrated &gt;&gt; the book the deed on the earth. &gt;&gt; So when he said to the fish that died little fish I give you back your life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Pray for fish. May the life of God come say I &gt;&gt; give you back your life &gt;&gt; because he had dominion &gt;&gt; over the fish. &gt;&gt; He had power &gt;&gt; to give the fish life. And the bride will have power to give out life. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The spirit will anoint the bride and the spirit and the bride will have a voice &gt;&gt; to say come. &gt;&gt; Whosoever will they coming. &gt;&gt; So let me prophesy to you. Your family coming, &gt;&gt; your loved ones coming. Nothing can stop them from coming because the spirit will be here upon the bride. The word, the bride becomes the word. The spirit monks the pride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen to this from the fourth seed. He said, "Wait till them seven thunders utter the voices to that group who can really take the word of God and hand it there." &gt;&gt; Not just any group. &gt;&gt; A group that could take the word &gt;&gt; and hand it there. &gt;&gt; Take the word and challenge devils. Take the word and challenge in this message. Take the word and hold on the sword. It take a faith to hold that sword. Oh, give the Lord a shout. The sword can't operate on itself. It take a hand to hold that sword. Take the word and hand it there. The word is the sword. The hand of faith holds that sword and challenge every devil out there. Oh, glory to God. We going to challenge every intellectual giant on the field. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. God going to raise up his Davids that going to challenge these intellectual giants that invade this message. We coming to get you. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Wait till the seven utter the voices. &gt;&gt; That group going to read what a word of God handed there. &gt;&gt; It will slice and cut. &gt;&gt; They can close the heavens. &gt;&gt; They can shut this or do that. Whatever they want to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God, it's his word, but he always uses man &gt;&gt; to work it. God could call for him flies down in Egypt. He said, "Moses, that's your job. I'll tell you what to do, but you go do it." And he fully done it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; All right. You're a great audience. &gt;&gt; Seven out of 18. We're going good. &gt;&gt; I do believe in purgatory. I believe it's right now. &gt;&gt; You purge your own soul. &gt;&gt; Purgatory means to purge. When you see you have done something wrong, get out there and clean it out of you by confession, crying, fasting, and praying. &gt;&gt; Someone even laughed at me when the Lord came not long ago and give me a vision. I always wanted to see about binding that serpent. I always wondered how to the questions he asking. &gt;&gt; I should step out like that when that's what I wanted all my life. Then I begin to fast and pray. a prophet &gt;&gt; fasting and praying. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Somebody said what did you do that for? I said in dear he said I was not sincere enough &gt;&gt; after he come then I wanted to purge myself &gt;&gt; or it have a self to purge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not wait till you die unless some priest try to purge you. purge your souls. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, he's talking about uh uh Noah and the ark and it was hollow. It was uh a lighter word, lighter than balsam because it was absorbent, right? And a real seed of God compare it now is absorbent for the spirit. All denomination is took out, all unbelief is out. And when the Holy Spirit comes into that gym of life that's laying there, it produces another seed. I am Brham because I was born of Charlie and Ella Bram that's make me Brham. I'm their seed. Their two agreements and sperm and seed make me that's make me. And when God and his word becomes one that is when God's spirit waters the seed of God, the word of God, it produces God. &gt;&gt; You know he said the secret is the word is in the bride. Right? So the spirit comes as water to water what's inside of you. &gt;&gt; So you don't fully know all what going to unfold out of your life when the spirit watering spirit for that seed inside of you comes to you. &gt;&gt; Each one in the upper room received their own liquor fire to activate what was in them. And God has put things in you that has to be activated. &gt;&gt; It come like you get a cell phone. You can buy the latest phone of any kind of phone. If it's not activated, it's not going to work. You can turn in your air, show people cover, put cover on it, put all kind of nicely, fancy thing and thing, but it's not working. &gt;&gt; You have to go to the company &gt;&gt; and get them activated. And when it get activated, then it could work. &gt;&gt; Well, that's you, &gt;&gt; that's me. That's us. That's Peter T in the city of Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Until you get activated, &gt;&gt; until you get power from on high, &gt;&gt; you shall receive power when after the Holy Ghost come upon you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So power is promised. &gt;&gt; Don't let nobody take that out of your heart. &gt;&gt; You are promised power. Power to live. Power to stand. Power to pray. Power to say forgive me. Power to say I am wrong. Power to overcome. Power to pray. Power to have dominion. Give the Lord some praises. The promise to be weak. The Bible say, "Let the weak say, &gt;&gt; I am strong." Give the Lord some praises. When Joel saw this army, he saw a mighty army that shall not break his ranks. &gt;&gt; I want to get some pictures here now. Sorry, I didn't get it. And the Chinese had a match the other day. You talk about rank, &gt;&gt; you talk about order, you should take a look at it. Long, long lines. and American army working army. Praise the Lord. And when I saw those Chinese marching, I was thinking about Joel army. They shall not break their rank. &gt;&gt; Listen the foot. You should see them &gt;&gt; foot. Everybody you know &gt;&gt; boot shining you know &gt;&gt; not one doll and one shining and one half and no everybody shining &gt;&gt; man they well trained for that &gt;&gt; that's not they not automatic thing they train they practice they went it over and over until they get it right because they wanted to display the world where they are reach where they had they were celebrating 80 years where Japan a small little island conquered them and overcome them and Now they are are showing victory over that 80year period. And for almost 6,000 years, this bride have been battered and bruised and conquered. And God will wait in the last days to show forth this glorious bride to show in Satan's Eden what he has raised up. He sent a mighty Elijah. He sent Eleazar to call out for Isaac. You want to tell me that this glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost will not be released. He said we are looking forward for it. God was in a glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost where there is virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness and the Holy Ghost itself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praises. China show their army on display. A army in order, a army walking in step, a army that is trained. God going to have a bride that's going to walk in step onward Christian soldiers marching on to war with the cross of Jesus &gt;&gt; going on before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me see how I can wrap up here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe &gt;&gt; the spirit will come upon you? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the spirit will water the word that's inside of you? &gt;&gt; You have to believe that. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; When God and his word becomes one, when God's spirit waters the seed of God, it produces God. He said it's not the individual. &gt;&gt; It is God. &gt;&gt; You are dead. &gt;&gt; You are not yourself no more. &gt;&gt; You reconcile yourself dead &gt;&gt; hollowed out waiting for the sea germ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is it? It isn't the man. It is God in the man. &gt;&gt; It is the sea germ &gt;&gt; like the beginning the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now you could watch Peter's flesh and say he denied Christ. He's a denier. Cuz that's what have on Facebook. &gt;&gt; That is what the news report, &gt;&gt; but it was God in that man. &gt;&gt; Because when Anastasia came lying, it wasn't to a man they lied to. He said, "You lie to the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; And they perish in front of that man. &gt;&gt; That man called Peter. &gt;&gt; Because it was not Peter. It was God in the man. &gt;&gt; And when Peter was speaking the word to Kir's house, it was not Peter. &gt;&gt; It was God in that man. Peter was demonstrating what Adam was supposed to do because see Jerm was must come from the body and Peter was part of the body of Christ. So he had life to give out and life was coming out of his lips. Life was coming out of his mouth because it was the spoken word which is the original seed. The seed the germ of God and when Peter spoke the Holy Ghost fell upon those words and and and baptized Cornelius with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Oh praise the name of the Lord. It isn't the man. It is God in the man. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. I'm going to wrap up. There he was. He was God made manifest. This is Jesus. And he died in order to pay the debt of your hybrid. There it is. What is it that you could die to yourself? &gt;&gt; Oh, we have to die, too. &gt;&gt; That's right. But I don't hear that in the message. No, what you hear is that you're the bride, you are this, you going straight to heaven. You're going glory. Hallelujah. Go straight to rapture. Like we we talked the other day this song on Jordan storing banks I stand and cast a wishful eye. That's looking like binoculars. You see that's the top part. But the bottom part is every place you put your foot. &gt;&gt; So you just cast your wisful eye and by Canaan and fair and happy land and bound for the promised land across there. &gt;&gt; But it's not yours until you put your foot &gt;&gt; and to put your foot yet across Jordan. during a reason debt. &gt;&gt; People don't want to die. &gt;&gt; You have to die. &gt;&gt; Even if you don't say amen, you say not to die. You know, &gt;&gt; if you don't die, you will abide alone. &gt;&gt; But if you want to see your family delivered, you die. &gt;&gt; And Christ come to life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The death of a corner wheat, you die. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. Watch. He said, "There you are. You die to yourself." So he died. What is it? That you could die to yourself. &gt;&gt; To who? &gt;&gt; To who? &gt;&gt; Yourself. Nobody self. Yourself. &gt;&gt; Yourself is your whole self. Then &gt;&gt; yourself is you are talking to &gt;&gt; some people like talk about the people know he doing wrong. She doing wrong. I'm not talking about he or he. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you. &gt;&gt; Yourself. &gt;&gt; Myself. Yourself. The individual. You taking ownership of you. Let's go. So watch. He said, watch. And until you die to yourself, until you are no more yourself, and be filled with his word, believe in his word, and then the Holy Spirit that was in him comes down to water that word and make it grow. Then what is it? God manifesting, continuing the work of his first son, his only begotten that died for our high breeding life, that he might reconcile us back to be sons and daughters of God. And through the church, here we go. might flow the same life &gt;&gt; by the word continuing the work being manifested as it was in Christ. So the church supposed to be like a teaching well &gt;&gt; where the spirit is flowing &gt;&gt; to continue the work. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; The Bible has got to be in you. The word is a seed. It it it it's laying there. But when it comes in the heart, then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit the works of God. Then vision comes, power comes, humility come. All your know it all is gone. You become nothing. &gt;&gt; Does that sound like the message? That's that song messages. You hear that? &gt;&gt; You become nothing. So where all this pride and arrogance going? I'm the pride. I am this and this and this. Really? &gt;&gt; You become nothing. &gt;&gt; Christ becomes alive. &gt;&gt; You die, &gt;&gt; he lives &gt;&gt; because he died, I live. And when I die, he lives again. &gt;&gt; And when I die, he promised me life. And when I die out of myself so in order I can have his life. &gt;&gt; How do we do it? By taking his word. &gt;&gt; So this self have to die. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the question is which self? &gt;&gt; The bad self or the good self? &gt;&gt; Well, Christians not supposed to have bad self. &gt;&gt; That is what the Lord deliver us from. &gt;&gt; So what self is he talking about here? &gt;&gt; Job 42 says, "Then Job answered and said, I know that thou can't do anything, everything that no knowledge can be withholden from thee. Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew not. And I beseech thee and I will speak. I'll demand of thee and declare thou unto me. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the air but now my eyes seeth thee. Wherefore I abhore myself and repent in dust and ashes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So true job experience which Job didn't ask for, volunteer for, offer themselves for a battle going on in heaven. A debate, a challenge going in heaven and job is the recipient or the object of this whole lesson that has been on display and Job go through all his stuff. He's in boils and he come to a revelation where he was speaking out of timing. He said things he shouldn't have said and then he said, "I abhore myself and repent and dust and ashes." &gt;&gt; Now look at the next verse there, which is verse seven. And it was so that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, the Lord said unto Elephite, "My wrath is king against thee, against thy two friends, for you have not spoken to me the thing that is right as my servant Job did." &gt;&gt; So they were in their self-righteous mode, thinking Job is a sinner, thinking it's because something could do wrong. Why disaster is all around him? And they didn't realize they are nothing. And when Job say I hate myself, God tell them guys listen I am against you now because you say what Job say. &gt;&gt; Job said the right thing. &gt;&gt; He hate himself. &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Then he said take now seven bulocks, seven rams. So Eleazar skipping Elifas and Timmonite did that and so like that and the Lord commanded them. The Lord also accepted Job. Here the verse 10. And the Lord &gt;&gt; turned the captivity of Job &gt;&gt; when he prayed for his friends. &gt;&gt; Also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. &gt;&gt; Double for his trouble. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Twice as much that he had before. &gt;&gt; He went through a disaster and God pulled him through. &gt;&gt; But what Job had to do, he had to say, "I hate myself." His friends had to come to that same spot and then Job had to pray for his friends. Now, if Job didn't have a real breakthrough, it's hard to pray for them people, you know. &gt;&gt; They're too wicked. &gt;&gt; There's friends, but oh God, there's problems. But not Job. He prayed for them. &gt;&gt; And when he prayed for them, God was able to clear up the whole thing &gt;&gt; and give him double. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Abhorance of good self. coming to see yourself as nothing. &gt;&gt; You're putting yourself in the mirror. That's where is that? That's dust. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? I'm going to close. &gt;&gt; God want to kill that good self. &gt;&gt; That message self. &gt;&gt; That long dress cover your knee self. &gt;&gt; That is self &gt;&gt; cuz you're dressed longer than others. You're not wearing hot pants. That self we talking about. &gt;&gt; That message self. &gt;&gt; God want to kill that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God don't want pride and arrogance beefing yourself around. God want you in humility. &gt;&gt; God want you in surrender. &gt;&gt; God want you healing yourself. &gt;&gt; There too much are bad behaved people in this message and I will call it out bad behave. &gt;&gt; The other day I preach about your character and conduct bring you another office. &gt;&gt; Character is what God sees who you are. &gt;&gt; Conduct is your behavior and attitude. &gt;&gt; Oh praise the B. The Bible said Jesus found favor with God and men. That mean Jesus learned how to behave himself. &gt;&gt; Jesus wasn't carrying harm. Jesus make way. Make room. &gt;&gt; No. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do do you believe that now? &gt;&gt; And especially when people wrong you or even if you are right and they're wrong and you forgive them, that's a killing. &gt;&gt; So brotherly kindness really is the virtue to kill. And that virtue is what will keep people out of the kingdom &gt;&gt; because they did not forgive, neither will I forgive you your trespasses. Therefore, you'll remain in your sins. &gt;&gt; Did you get that? &gt;&gt; If you do not forgive, neither will I forgive you. Therefore, your sin remain it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So to release your brother, you release yourself &gt;&gt; by releasing your brother that did something to you and you forgive them and drop it. Even if it even if you are right and they are wrong, forgive them, &gt;&gt; talk to them, encourage them &gt;&gt; or give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Let me close for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time, what you're going through, is not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall reveal in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God and so on. I want to skip with earnest expectation. The whole creation is waiting for what? The manifestation. What is the manifestation? Making known. So in this promised land, everything belongs to us in the promised land. When Israel crossed the Jordan in the promised land, they fought for everything. In the promised land don't mean you're immune from sickness, &gt;&gt; but it does mean it doesn't mean you're immune from troubles, but it does spell this. The land is yours. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what you must be convinced of. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. I'm going to skip here. Hallelujah. Adoption placing positionally and so on like that. What's the world creation waiting for? The manifestation of sons of God is waiting for the church to come into position. Isn't that right? He said man of dominion over the earth. And the whole creation is waiting for the sons of God to be manifested. waiting God trying to place the church in position to manifest himself getting the one he can work through and say there is my spirit flowing freely &gt;&gt; so Peter's service on the day of Pentecost was 15 minutes &gt;&gt; another hour and a half sermon you know 15 minutes and 3,000 people got convicted by the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; so this six hour sermon sermon explaining explaining what we don't even Instead of mechanics, a mechanic if a mechanic mechanic mechanic fixing wheel, tire, battery, all kind of in the car, cargo, a little child, three-y old child riding a tricycle passing you on the road. He going somewhere a tricycle with with with guider wheels on it and you shining, shining, shining, polishing, polishing 15 years polishing, taking pictures, putting on Instagram, posting by the car but the car not starting. He cannot go in &gt;&gt; because he's there for pictures. &gt;&gt; We don't want that. &gt;&gt; You want me to turn the engine to tumble? &gt;&gt; It take mechanical dynamic. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. We talk about inheritance. All right. Missions, come on, please. Domain over self. And one of the key things I have here, the tongue. And and James said, "My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive greater condemnation. For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same as a perfect man, and all able to bridle the whole body. Behold, we put bits in horses mouths that when they obey us, we turn about their whole body. The ships, though they be great, are driven with fierce winds. They turn around with a very small helm. Whether ever the covenant listed even so the tongue &gt;&gt; your tongue &gt;&gt; don't watch your neighbor you know you have a tongue &gt;&gt; that's the one we're talking about &gt;&gt; even so the tongue is a little remember boasted great things behold how great a matter is little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire &gt;&gt; a world of iniquity &gt;&gt; so is the tongue among your members that is defileth the whole body &gt;&gt; and set it on fire. The course of nature, it is set on fire of hell. For every kind of beast and birds and serpents and things in the sea is tamed and had been tamed of mankind, but the tongue &gt;&gt; can no man tame. &gt;&gt; Mark the perfect man. &gt;&gt; He could bridle &gt;&gt; his tongue. &gt;&gt; He could bridle his mouth. So perfection is is is is recognized by the order of what we say &gt;&gt; because life and death is in the power of &gt;&gt; the tongue. &gt;&gt; But the tongue can no man tame is an unruly evil full of deadly poison. There we bless we God even the father and there curse we men which are made in the similitude of God. Out of the same purses blessing and cursing. My brethren these things ought not to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm skipping. Proverbs 16:32. Love this one. He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. &gt;&gt; So you governing yourself is greater than a man who actually conquer whole city. &gt;&gt; That's how powerful it is having dominion over oneself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So Joseph conquered the lust of the eyes by refusing partition's wife. &gt;&gt; Daniel purposed in his heart he would not defile himself with the king's meat. &gt;&gt; His powerful appetite. Moses, the Bible said, refused the pleasures of sin in Egypt, choosing suffering for Christ's sake. And David spared Saul life twice when he could have taken it. And he could have used vengeance or his pride. But David choose to say touch not God's anointed &gt;&gt; knowing he going to someday &gt;&gt; sit on that throne. &gt;&gt; So Jesus was our example in the wilderness. He overcome the lust of the flesh, stone into bread, lust of the eyes, all these kingdoms, pride of life, castel down. Cast in other words, show off. He showed and demonstrated what it was dominion over self. And I'm going close with this quote. Begin to play something. All what we preach this morning ties into God's three-fold purpose. One, to reveal himself, which is by the word. Two, to have the preeminences. Three, to bring us back to Eden. To go back to Eden is to go back to dominion. When the lamb took the book, John by revelation understood the restoration of that book meant restoration of dominion and authority. So we are actually going back to the original. That is why we have to be concerned about what we speak. And this bringing to for St. Mark 11:23, if you shall say to the mountain, be moved and don't doubt in your heart, &gt;&gt; you can have what you said. &gt;&gt; So when man fell, but Jason, the cherubims came to guard the tree. And he's saying here, "Now I want to show you and make sure it's an altar. This must have been an altar at the Garden of Eden." Do you remember when Cain and Abel come up to worship? So that shows that God's altar was moved and set in the Garden of Eden. And the only way back to Eden is by the altar. Here you are again. See, back to Eden through the altar. And they were to keep that way. and guard it. They couldn't get there until this altar was covered with blood. So, it must have been an altar. That's right. And before this altar, they built a substitutionary, another altar. Here is the true altar of God is in the heart of man. That's where the true altar is. Let's all stand [Music] him. How we long to worship you. God bless you. Praise the Lord. [Music] How we long to worship you, Lord. We come to you in worship.

Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Give the Lord a hand of praise this evening. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. What a message this evening. Amen. As the brothers get ready for today's offering, let's sing that song. We are able to go up and take the country and possess the land from Jordan to the sea. So the giants will be there away to him. We already win the victory. [Music] We are able to go up and take country and possess the land from faith to charity. Though the giants will be there to wait to end up, we already have the victory.

Be lifted up on high. I will draw men unto. Lift Jesus higher. Lift him higher. Lift Jesus higher. Lift him up for the world to see. He said, "I be lifted up. I will draw him.

Oh, lift him up for the world to see. He said, "If I be lifted up on high, I will draw him for the last time." Oh, lift Jesus higher. Lift Jesus high up. Oh, lift him up for the world to see. He said, "If I be lifted up on high, I will draw all men unto me." Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You appreciate the Lord this morning. You appreciate the message this morning. You appreciate your pastor this morning. Oh, wonderful. Wonderful pathway to dominion. What a masterpiece. What a time. What a reminder to us of what we are born to do. What we are placed here to do. Can we give the Lord one more hand of praise? Hallelujah. Glory. Amen. So, let's just bow our heads as we close out in prayer. Our gracious heavenly father, we thank you this morning, Lord, for the time in your presence, Lord. And Lord, what a blessed opportunity and a privilege to be able to come to your house of praise, your house of worship, your house of training and correction, and the house of God's bread where we could eat from the hidden manner under the seventh seal. Father, we thank you, Lord, for the message today and the time in your presence and how you are shaping and preparing us for, Lord, what lays ahead. May you strengthen your people in a special way. We pray a special blessing upon our pastor this morning. That you would touch him from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet, Lord. May you renew his strength as you renew the strength of the eagles. Father, you said they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, Father. They will mount up with wings as eagles. They will run and not be weary. They will walk and not faint. Father, so Lord, may you bless Lord his wife, Father. Lord, may you bless all of the ministers and elders, the deacons, the trustees, the helps and governments, Father. Lord, may you bless your church in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Father, may you bless all the visitors in our gates. May you bless those that are connected online, Father. And Lord, may you be with your people. May you grant traveling mercies and may you bring us back at your appointed time, Father. Lord, may you bless the service this coming Wednesday with our precious brother Timothy Redhead from Grenada. Lord, may the shout of the king be in the camp and may spirit spoken words, Lord, be uttered from behind the sacred desk, Lord, that chains and shackles will be broken, Father. And we'll be, Lord, constantly reminded, Lord, to have our faith strengthened in the present truth, Father. And Lord, may you bless the special meetings this coming weekend with our brother Jonathan Martin from Lord True Word Tabernacle, Ohio. Father, Lord, I we know it's going to be a mighty time in the presence of the Lord. May you bless the tree services. May you bring him safely to us later this week, Father. And Lord, may a revival spark out here in the church in a mighty way, Father. Lord, may you bless your people, Lord. If there's anyone needing a physical touch, Father, Lord, may you touch your people. Anyone need, Lord, anything from you, Father. We unite as a church in faith. If two shall agree, touching anything, knowing we could have what we ask for, may you touch your people. One more time, may you bless those that are here, Lord. May you bless those that couldn't make it today for whatever reason, Father. Lord, how the enemy has, Lord, attacked and broken into homes and situations, but Father, we plead the blood and apply the token, Lord, upon our families. And Lord, as the Bible say, as for me and my house, we'll serve the Lord. So we stand in faith knowing that you are a deliverer. You are a maker. You are a Lord God a restorer. May you bless your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ. We commit them into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen and amen. You may be seated for a few announcements. Hallelujah. Glory. service continues this coming Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. as we have announced. Brother Tim Redhead from Grenada uh will be ministering to us this coming Wednesday. We encourage you to make every effort to be here this coming Wednesday looking for a special time in the Lord. And as we see things happening, we don't believe there's much time left. We want to make every effort that we have to this uh this coming Friday, there will be no service this coming Friday. All of our efforts we want to focus on this coming weekend. Our service on Saturday at 3 pm for the entire church service this coming Sunday at 10:00 a.m. and at 4:00 p.m. our brother Jonathan Martin from True Word Tabernacle, Ohio will be here to minister to us and we are under great expectation for a time in the Lord and I want you to come under great expectation for it as well. Uh all are welcome. We have also invited uh the local churches. So we expect some believers to be joining us uh sometimes over the over the services. So uh come under great expectation. Bring your fire. Come under great expectation for God to do something special for you and for your family. Invite someone. Reach out to someone who is not here today. Let them know we're having a a season of revival that starts with this Wednesday night with brother Tim and then this weekend with brother Jonathan Martin. with respect to Sunday's service. Uh it's two services. Of course, you are welcome to walk with your lunch. Um but there is also provision made u for $50 for a meal and a drink. The menu is downstairs. So if you are interested in purchasing a lunch for the middle of the two services this coming Sunday, please see the sisters downstairs so that we could be able to take care of that. um $50. It includes the drink as well. And of course, if you want to walk with your own meal, you're certainly welcome to do so. But the most important thing we want to encourage the entire church is to not miss any of the services. Make every effort. God will see the effort. He will reward the effort. And this coming Saturday in particular, it's for the entire church, but is dedicated to the young people. So, we want to make an extra push to get all of the young people here at the church and um and of course the two services on Sunday. I think they'll be critical for the church as well as to the believers from the other assemblies that will be joining us as well. Uh looking for God to do something special for us. um maintenance team group four please meet with brother Malon Alexander after the service and next week Sunday Lord willing group two is called to serve. I do believe with having the weekend of services we will need some impromptu support uh to be able to ensure that the place is ready between Saturday and Sunday as well. So look out for that as well. And last and certainly not least, there'll be a brief meeting of all the musicians, song technicians, video technicians, um streaming worship leaders directly after the service. We're going to have a brief meeting with you after the service. So may the Lord bless you richly. Stay on fire. Stay in the presence of the Lord. God bless you, brother Jason. Amen.
