God so it's good to be here so thank you so much and we want to switch over now to the word portion the service amen and it's wonderful that you come out tonight uh was all the rain and inclement weather but um it means so much for us to be here Amen in his presence amen where we could hear from God where we could be uh affected by him Amen in a way that would change our lives amen so we thank God for his presence amen so thank you so much for coming out tonight making the effort to do this thank you so much m Ians amen um so as you turn to your Bibles uh we like to read a portion of scripture in the Psalms we're going to read from Psalms tonight Psalms chapter 51 want to read from verses 5 and six for a scripture reading tonight amen Psalms 51 from verse 5 it says behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom may God have blessing to the Ring of his word let's bow our hands Heavenly Father Lord we thank you to be in your presence tonight Lord Lord there's nowhere other place that we could come Lord and be lifted up and feel the presence of God like we do but in your presence Lord where there's fullness of joy no wonder we hear the psalmist David say I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord it's good to be in your presence tonight with we thank you for your people tonight that have gathered here to hear from you Lord Jesus we pray that your presence would come down now for a few moments while we talk on the word tonight Lord we are nothing with in ourselves Lord but you are the controller you are the masters of the master of our destiny tonight Lord we just give ourselves over to your hand Lord and we pray that you have your way with us tonight Lord may you come down in your word father and as we share the scriptures tonight we pray that you take charge of each heart and life Lord may you move in whatever way you choose to move tonight we just surrender to your will and to your program tonight father have your own way tonight we pray and ask it and Lord may you just uh uh take control of the service we pray and ask these things in your precious name amen and amen and the church says amen you may have your seats God richly bless you amen praise God I want to take my time tonight I uh amen it's been quite a week already um but we thank God for the holidays tomorrow and for a time of rest amen amen praise God but um I have a thought here tonight and it comes off of something we just share sh with the young people uh just Saturday gone we had a you a youth Gathering service and um we had such a great time in the presence of the Lord and so I felt led to bring back some of these thoughts here tonight that you know we would have shared there and trust it would be a blessing to you tonight amen as we talk on the word amen so I have a title tonight it's called shaping and forming of the sons of God shaping and the forming of the sons of God Amen and um just give me one second here I'm just going to get a file quick amen but uh we just read that scripture there Psalms 51 isn't that right and in that scripture he says plainly here behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me isn't that right uh there was a shaping that took place when you were born here on Earth you came that way the Bible says you were shaped in iniquity it was not your choice you just come in that condition you didn't choose to battle but you came here and found a battle from the moment that you were born you were born into struggle born into a conflict isn't that right the Bible says there was war in heaven isn't that right and Michael fought and the dragon fought and there was no place found for the dragon so he had to find a place somewhere else because heaven is not a place for Dragons Heaven is a place for God and His angels and Purity and righteousness and love and tonight we come to reflect that same Heavenly Glory there's no place for dragons in here tonight there's only place for worship and for Glory and for giving God praise and for thanking God for what he has done there's no no place for negative thoughts negative attitudes there's only place for Revival and for worship and for getting on fire for God and for getting into the spirits this is a place to let off the pressure this is a place to shout this is a place to lift your hands this is a place to let the devil know whose side you are on let the devil know that you're on the Lord's Side that you're not here to take sides with demons but you're here to take sides with God that you're here to take sides with righteousness oh I to stand for all the things that Jesus stood for oh can I get an amen tonight oh am I speaking to Christians tonight am I speaking to people who are not afraid to show their true colors who are not afraid to make a stand while they're here on planet Earth oh we're not afraid of the devil and all of his forces but we're here to stand for the truth we're here to back up the word we're here to get filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire we're here to be changed we're here to be shaped we're here to be formed uh into the word image be not conformed to this world but the Bible says be transformed uh by the renewing of your mind that you might prove come on now what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God oh hallelujah oh we're here to stand for something uh or don't stand for nothing at all I didn't come all this way tonight just to occupy a church but I come to stand uh upon the word of God oh Heaven and Earth uh will pass away but my word shall never pass away oh are you here tonight to be conformed uh to the image of his son and to be changed into that image from glory to glory to glory even as by the spirit of of the Lord oh there's an anointing coming tonight a glory that is getting bur to rest upon the Sons and Daughters of God uh in the last days say it God uh I'm going to pour out my spirit upon All Flesh there is a glory coming tonight oh I'm here to get in the spirit to get ready for that glory to come down oh can somebody praise him tonight oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God yeah what a glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace full of Truth amen so let's get into this thought here tonight amen Psalms 51 we read right I was shapen in iniquity and then sended my mother conceiv me you come in that way and it's because of the Fall as we know in the Garden of Eden every man woman and child that was born since that time has come in this condition almost like a pre-shape or prefabrication uh but the objective of God is not for us to remain like that we thank God for giving us his word so that now he could begin a process of shaping us over of changing us from what we are now into what we are meant to be if Adam hadn't fallen in the Garden of Eden we would have come perfect knowing everything under the control of the master which is God himself we would have been just like attribute Sons just expressed in the fullness of that but it come that we bypass our theophany and drop down into flesh in this condition not knowing anything and needing God's help more than ever I thank God that he didn't leave us in that condition but he sent his only begotten son to shed his blood for us on Calvary and because of that sacrifice he has made an entrance for us to make a way for us to come back into Redemption isn't that right amen and amen so shaping and forming that's the subject of what we want to talk about tonight now we know that the world is made of shapes isn't that right the whole world if you look at it you know from a simple perspective we can see that it's made up of shapes different types of shapes you know and uh you on the on the internet tonight you in this building when you look around this building we look around where we are and our homes and we could see different shapes it's a very simple concept and I my trade as a designer and my skill that God has blessed me with um by the grace of God um this is kind of how I guess we see the world you know when everybody's walking around trying to pay bills and stuff we're staying into space because we're seeing all these shapes very interesting shapes some of them very unique some of them common common to the naked eye but the interesting thing is that all these shapes are meant for a purpose for instance the chairs that you're sitting on tonight are a series of this different shapes that were welded together to serve a specific purpose it's not just a loose shape but the the wisdom that God put into man is to be able to put these things together so that it can serve a particular purpose or function and it just like a natural thing is put together and welded together and fabricated together in order to serve a particular function or purpose so too are you tonight so too are all lives a series of shapes that God is putting together in order to serve a particular function Hallelujah in order to serve in a particular purpose or capacity isn't that right amen and this is uh this is the basic concept of it isn't that right and um yeah so it's made up of shapes isn't that right your life is made up of shapes as well and the interesting thing tonight is that God knows the shape of us tonight I'm not talking about your natural shape but I'm talking about your spiritual shape what shape that you are in tonight when you look in the mirror of the word how do we see ourselves how have we been shaped so it's quite an interesting thing to reflect on and I pray that you reflect on it tonight in an inward way so that we can begin to take account of our lives and see literally what shape are we in tonight are we in good shape are we in a bad shape do we need shaping do we need help tonight I believe there's a Master Mason in the room tonight and his name is Jesus and he can do things that we could never do or dream of he can shape us tonight shape us into what we want to to be tonight what he desires for us tonight oh on a higher place in a higher level he could take you tonight anybody that interacted with Jesus never remained the same whatever experience they had with him something about that experience shaped them differently they came in one way and then all of a sudden they were shaped differently maybe their mindset changed maybe they were depressed but something about meeting the Messiah had an effect on the shape of them tonight oh Hallelujah they came in prostitutes and they left clean they came in sick and they left healed they came in blind and all of a sudden something happened and they begin to see oh they came in spiritually blind and he opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures understand where they were who they were and what they are to be oh what a wonderful thing it is to encounter this Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah because no matter what Society does they could never have this transforming power that Jesus tends to have Society can put you in jail and they will in the e effort to reform you or to try to make you over to be fit for society but only the power of God could transform your nature only the power of God could transform your being oh Hallelujah can give you something powerful and give you something real isn't that right so God is the god of our destiny do you believe that he's a god that is in charge of our lives and he is the one putting you together tonight and putting you getting you in shape he's like your personal gym instructor he's working on you working on you and he's still working on you so tell the devil tonight I may not be what I want to be but I'm certainly not what I used to be he's still working on me tonight I may not be the perfect parent but I'm getting there I may not be the perfect son but I'm getting there I may not be the perfect daughter the perfect wife or the perfect husband but by the grace of God the word of God is teaching us how to get there and we know that by faith when we get there oh hallelujah we're going to be just like him oh Hal we going to see him as he is oh H we're going to see him face to face do you believe that tonight amen and amen so God is very interested tonight in our shape and he's interested in our form am he's interested in what we look like amen spiritually speaking yes sir because when we look back at the creation story we realize that you should have come a different way shaped a different way formed a different way but unfortunately because of the form man kind is all bent out of shape they are deformed they are without Conformity uh they are out of character out of order it seems isn't that right and more they go on is the more they become out of shape out of form until men want to be like women women want to dress like men becomes more and more like that because it start off bad to begin with so what we need now is a conversion what we need now is a change tonight and the only way that could come is by the baptism of the Holy Spirit an infusion of God's power in your soul to cause a change tonight in your nature and in your being Hallelujah because you can't do that naturally it's going to take something Supernatural tonight to change your Supernatural form to change your spiritual likeness and to make you like Jesus Christ to give you those Seven Virtues to give you those seven manifestations of one Holy Spirit into the individual it'll take a supernatural power in order to do that and to change you into this shape and change you into this form isn't that right so God is interested in our shape scientifically we could scientifically sorry we can say that our construct our human body is made up of shapes isn't that right or nose or eyes or facial construct and what we see outside as features of our natural appearance is really a reflection of a deeper construct which is our skeletal frame and our muscle uh tissue isn't that right all these deeper things is what actually give life to what we see on the surface that's why each one of us is unique yeah each one of us is made different there's no one person with the same fingerprint as the other even the iris and all these things are unique to you because God knows how you are shaped God knows how you are formed amen and beautifully and wonderfully are you made tonight give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah and I love it because his objective is not for you to stay even as you are but he wants to bring you to Perfection he wants to bring you into adoption he wants to bring you into the place where you could have the power of a son to sign the check and to do the father's will and to operate the father's business and the father's business is signs wonders and miracles the father's business is healing of the sick the father's business is raising the Dead the father's business is casting out devils and God wants people tonight in shape he wants people tonight in a certain form so that they could take up their mantle of authority to take up their mantle of position of power in the kingdom of God as sons of God and begin to do the works of the father and then you could be like Jesus and say I do only that which pleases my Father in Heaven don't you know I'm about my father father's business oh I want to be about my father's business tonight oh the devil has people distracted to in this to in that but I believe there's a people in here tonight who are interested in the Holy Ghost you are interested in getting it right you are interested in getting in shape in getting informed in getting fit to do the father's will oh oh do you believe that tonight oh God's got to have a people in the land who have this kind of Desire this is the generation of them that seek Him of them that seek thy face we are the ones that God has raised up for such a time as this to seek the face of God if there ever was a time to seek him now is that time tonight because we we are badly out of shape we need to be shaped tonight but the shaper is here tonight the the master builder is here tonight and he wants to make a masterpiece out of your life and it is only that you yield to his master craftsmanship tonight oh Hallelujah so shall you be formed so shall you be shaped in as much as you all be willing to be yielded tonight oh Hallelujah isn't that right glory to God and the work always reflects the man who's doing the work isn't that right if the man is a halfway man then he does halfway work if the man is a lazy man then he does lazy work but if the man is a perfect man if he believes in getting it right if he believes in measuring up if he believes in laying the line to the plummet if that's the kind of man you're dealing with then that is the kind of work that is going to come out of that man and if God is the man in whose hands you are in tonight then you are going to reflect his work his craftsmanship his Perfection I'm so glad tonight I'm not in the hands of a man but I am in the hands of Jesus and in his hands you're going to be all right when you're in his hands you're going to come out okay you can say like tonight like job though he slay me yet I'll trust him because I'm in his hands and if I'm in his hands I could never go wrong he will never steare you wrong he sticks closer than a brother tonight he's closer than a closest friend tonight oh Hallelujah brother brandham said he love his wife so much he feel like he could just wrap her into him he said God loves us so much more than that oh is accelerated so much wider so much greater so much deeper deeper than the deepest ocean tonight is where he put your sins is where he put your mistakes oh town in the sea of forgetfulness oh it's lost down there never to return again oh he don't even bring it up it's so far gone the Bible says as far as East is from the West is how far he has removed our transgressions from us oh do you believe that tonight oh Hallelujah I'm here to talk about Jesus I'm here to brag about Jesus oh because he is the best thing that can happen in your life he is the best thing that ever happened in my life oh and I know I can't live without him I didn't bring myself here he brought me out he brought me out of the myy CLA and the one that brought me out is the same one that's going to take me through every trial every test every condition oh do you believe it tonight amen and amen Oh Glory let me just amen amen that's right see Oh Glory Hallelujah so there's a lot of stuff happening down in the surface we talking about the body construct right so there's a lot of things happening below the surface that gives life to the things we see outside isn't that right and this is kind of what it is it's made up of deeper things the Bible says the world itself was framed by the word of God so that things that we see around us were not made by things which do appear isn't that right so this world that we live in right now all these shapes that we see around us there was once nothing here but there was a God one time that spoke it into existence and he said let there be and there was so therefore everything we see around us all these shapes we see around us is just a a a manifestation of the mind of God a God that spoke it into existence isn't that right isn't that right you see so so so that's what it is and so we thank God for a prophet who William Marian brandham isn't that right who sent to us in these last days amen to give us evidence that this spiritual World actually exists isn't that right he was influenced by it every day Visions Healing The Sick raising the Dead doing the works of God those are not Natural Things science couldn't explain what brother brandham was doing but he was a prophet he had the eyes to see what men could not normally see and what he saw were pictures from a place that was just as real as this place that we are in right now oh and his life and his ministry did testify of a supernatural place a supernatural World Jesus was the same way he said I come from God oh isn't that right I come down from God out of Heaven I am the bread of life I am the door I am the way he said I am the truth and I am the life no man can come to the father unless he come by me he came to give us evidence that there is a reality beyond the skies that there is a reality beyond the world that you are currently living in tonight there is a God somewhere that can heal your body that can help your condition that can uation oh that can heal the mess in your mind what you think is mess God could bring it back to order what you think is corrupted God could raise it up and bring it back into a semblance of order because he is the god that made order in the beginning oh and he knows your shape tonight he knows your form uh he knows what you're supposed to look like uh oh Hallelujah and he's here to get you in shape he's here to get you in form so that you can be as Sons and Daughters of God isn't that right amen and amen praise the name of the Lord isn't that right hallelujah praise God so that's how the natural and spiritual is Right amen and amazingly what sometimes what we there's things happening outside of our sphere that we know nothing about right job had no clue that he and that God and the devil was having a conversation about him outside of his sphere of reality there are conversations happening tonight about you that you know nothing about the Bible says the devil is the accuser of the Brethren accusing the people of God before God day and night oh hallelujah hallelujah he's the plaintiff Amen in the courtroom constantly handing in complaints look she did this look she did that look he did this he's not worthy of the Gospel he's not worthy of Christianity but I thank God that God didn't just leave a plaintiff in the Box he also put a defendant on the other side and his name is Jesus and the defendant is here to say I'm here to defend my clients oh there is blood for him there is blood for her though they did this though they said that there is blood for them there is atonement for them uh though judgment requires their life Mercy said no I will not let you go I will not let you slip away God is not about to let you slip away tonight he's got you he's going to save you he's going to redeem you he's going to restore you there is an atonement for you tonight there is blood for you tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hal don't let the devil oh rob you of your rights your access rights your Redemptive rights to claim your promises in this hour you deserve to be a Son of God you deserve to smile you deserve to praise your God in the midst of your trial yes yes you deserve just like Peter when he was sinking on water he had every right to raise up his hands and say Jesus help me I am sinking and if you are sinking tonight you have every right to cry out to your car tonight and say Jesus I need your help I can't make it without you I need your mercy I need your power I need your grace cry out to him tonight don't be afraid to call upon your lord cuz he is your savior tonight amen and amen amen do you believe it tonight so hurrying along with this thought now and we I'll make a reference to Genesis cuz I think it's a powerful reference here and if you want you could read it along with me it's just Genesis 1 the the creation story and you know of course you know Genesis 1 I'll read it out in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth right look in verse two says and the Earth was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep isn't that right and so here we see identified are three problems three issues that need solving three things that need addressing and it's clearly identified here in the scripture isn't that right it was without form meaning it was without shape like what we are talking about tonight it was also void meaning it was empty of life and it was dark darkness you couldn't see nothing at all isn't that right and uh so the Bible goes on to say say that the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters isn't that right any time God is getting ready to do something in your life he's getting ready to perform a work there's a move that takes place there's a rushing in the Mulberry Tree there's a there's a whirlwind there's a there's an action there's an incitement amen isn't that right there's a stirring when God begins to stir it means he already has a plan in his mind about something he's going to do but because we are living in the present instance what we first begin to see is a move of God and I believe tonight we are living in a time when we are about to see a move of God because God already has a plan in his mind about what he's going to create about what he's going to do about the work he is going to perform he wants to make back this pyramid he wants to rebuild the church again and he has to do it under the power of the spirit and when God has to do something he begins to move oh Hallelujah Hal and tonight oh we are here to move as he moves oh Hallelujah isn't that right when the children of Israel were going through the Wilderness and they were setting up camp it is because they were moving with the the pillar of fire isn't that right and wherever the pillar of fire went they had to go right along with it if the pillar of fire stopped they stopped and made camp and the Bible said it was a pillar of fire all night long and it gave light to them that were camping so that they weren't alone so that they weren't afraid what a comfort the pillar of fire is in the day he's a cloud and at night he's a pillar of fire to keep off the Scorpion and snakes to keep you in the light so that you never walk in darkness Oh How He loves you and me tonight we are not walking in darkness but we are walking in the light of his glory and where his light is there is healing in that light there is Deliverance in that light there is Restoration in that light every fi of your body can be affected uh by the healing power of the pillar of fire tonight oh somebody give him praise if only you can get in the spirit get in the atmosphere of Faith where the Miracles take place you will feel the effects oh the warm sensation of that Pillar of Fire Light coming upon your soul coming upon your body coming upon your spirit oh he wants to live inside of you tonight oh can't you feel those Warm Rays of the S so n of God oh until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts who is he he is Jesus the son of the Living God he's here to come inside of you he's here to born in you again H by the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh and fire and give you a real transformation and begin your shaping and forming process to bring you into the image of the stature of the fullness of Christ isn't that right to the stature of a perfect man amen that's what he's here to do tonight do you believe it amen so the pillari moving move with it that's right am amen if you don't move with it you'll get in trouble because you don't know the way he didn't take the the the the road that everyone knew God actually purposefully took the road L travel when he led the children of Israel amen by the way of the Wilderness and the purpose of that was to try them to get them in shape to get them to change to get Egypt out of them amen because they had come out of Egypt yes but they were still holding on to Egypt on the inside so God wants people tonight who can be affected by his school of character training where he can take you through stuff isn't that right take you through trials take you through Wilderness take you through sorrow Oh Hallelujah but all is to form you and to shape you into what he wants for you oh just like butov is saying on Sunday isn't that right no one likes discipline doesn't matter how it comes across whether it's soft or hard whether it's rough or smooth whether it's high or low whether it's in or out no one likes disciplining but disciplining yields the fruits of righteousness it yields the fruits of Peace it yields the fruits of humility and all these things that we long to see if only tonight we could yield to God's shaping and to God's Conformity because that's what he wants for us tonight is that right amen so you have to move with the pillar of fire isn't that right otherwise you will get lost and it is 100% possible to get lost we can actually get lost it is possible for us to actually go off track you know we preach the gospel as a positive thing God loves us and he cares about us and that he wants good for us and and that we're going to be perfect we're going to be filled with the Holy Ghost we're going to be this and that's how the gospel is preached isn't that right and there's nothing wrong with that but what we have to get in our minds is that if we don't do the things he says do we can actually go off track and God actually sometime allow us to go Plum off the beaten path and go kening down into the precipice and off into the Ravine somewhere in an unmarked map location and let you keep going until you realize that you are lost and that you really need his help until you come to that realization you will keep heading in the wrong direction and the more decisions you make is the more you will continue to spin out of control it happened to the prophet one time he needed a guy youall know what I'm talking about tonight he told his story about how he was a ranger and how he's supposed to know the woods like the back of his hands but all of a sudden he found himself making circles he found himself doing something called the death the death walk isn't that right going around and coming back to the same spot what a reflection of Our Lives sometimes we say we've made progress sometimes we think we've done so much only to come back around at the same spot and then we tell ourselves it's not so bad maybe I'll just keep walking surely I know where I'm going and then we come right around to the same spot we try to turn over a new Leaf we try to get a New Year's resolution we try to write it down on a book but we come back to the same spot when are you going to recognize tonight that you need a guide when are you going to recognize tonight that you don't know of him we need him more than we realize when I take a airplane ride and you you go up into the clouds and you look down at the ocean the mighty ocean below you you think for a second if this plane engine was to fail the ocean would be my destiny you tend to think how small you are at one time I was looking up from a from a from an airplane and I saw ship uh boat or something was on Water I could see it from there it looked like an ant of course cuz I was so high up and above that ship was a cloud and it was raining and I could see the rain falling like a stream like that you could see it swaying in the wind over
