[43:40] happy to be back home and we are yet
[43:44] yeah tremendous victory in Africa
[43:46] tremendous victory in Nigeria forgive us
[43:49] some tremendous tremendous meetings and
[43:52] there was testimony is to testimony of
[43:54] the Dead been raised and God is the
[43:57] supernatural is at work and the god of
[44:00] this prophet is still alive
[44:03] but a historical God you just readin
[44:06] quotes on reading history he still
[44:08] healing
[44:09] he is the deliverance he still alive he
[44:13] still restoring
[44:14] and that's what we are here for to get
[44:16] in contact with this this God amen
[44:19] freeze a limb of the Lord so I was away
[44:22] when I hear but it's good quick let's
[44:25] chop this Trinidad and now you know I
[44:28] always talk about see I'm not concerned
[44:32] much about a hurricane but the it quick
[44:35] that's coming that just a deposit they
[44:39] really want is yet to come
[44:40] so you know it's wondering all these
[44:44] bandits and robbers if they might get
[44:46] shake up what if a time then they back
[44:48] to the robbery and banditry and so on
[44:51] because the nature of man is still the
[44:52] nature of man she can it has a temporary
[44:55] shaken one thing with earthquakes do it
[44:58] make you that you're not in control
[45:00] see when storms I could put a thing and
[45:03] block and duck and different thing but a
[45:05] chicken that's a little different I
[45:07] don't think that they could shoot at
[45:10] that and they could fight that you see
[45:13] but the judgments of God is hanging over
[45:15] the earth and we have to begin to see
[45:18] that our lives is not in our own hands
[45:21] many choices and easier to make we have
[45:24] to make it prayerfully you have to
[45:26] really put things before God because you
[45:29] could plan but cordon have other plans
[45:31] and you want at this kind of our here
[45:34] now to really surrender your plans and
[45:37] put us to go on so this morning we gonna
[45:40] bless you we have a mixed message but I
[45:42] want to share with you a preach in a
[45:44] legal church but before that or how a
[45:46] few words I want to share with you up on
[45:47] my heart so that's time we're gonna turn
[45:49] our Bibles to Luke chapter 14 Thank You
[45:52] musicians a beautiful we want to read
[45:54] some scriptures there from 25 to 33 Luke
[46:03] chapter 14
[46:05] just although you're fine and whether in
[46:08] the challenge is that
[46:10] Gordon is wisdom send your way let me
[46:14] repeat that hope you're fine and you're
[46:17] weathering the challenge that challenges
[46:20] that God in His wisdom sentences you're
[46:22] being looked up the 24 verse 25 to 33
[46:28] and they went great multi-use with him
[46:30] and he turned and said unto their
[46:33] business Jesus if any man come to me and
[46:37] he'd not his father and mother and wife
[46:41] and children and brethren and sisters
[46:46] year and his own life also he cannot be
[46:51] my disciple now the context of this
[46:54] would heat is not as you know it doesn't
[46:57] mean you do not put above his
[46:59] discipleship your parents your wife your
[47:02] husband nothing must come ahead of him
[47:04] he must be first let's continue if any
[47:10] man come to me this verse 26 and heed
[47:13] not his father and mother and wife and
[47:14] children and brethren and sisters year
[47:17] and his own life also he cannot be my
[47:19] disciple and whosoever does not bear his
[47:22] cross and come after me cannot be my
[47:25] disciple for which of you intending to
[47:28] build a tower sitteth not down first and
[47:31] contact the cost whether he be have
[47:35] sufficient to finish it lease happily
[47:38] after year lay the foundation and is not
[47:41] able to finish it all that behold it
[47:43] begin to mock him saying this man began
[47:46] to build and was not able to finish or
[47:50] what King going after to make war is
[47:53] another King sit at nothing not first
[47:54] and consulted whether he be evil with
[47:57] ten thousand to meet him that commit
[47:59] against him with twenty thousand or else
[48:02] while the other is yet afar off he said
[48:06] it ambassador his arid conditions of
[48:08] peace so likewise whosoever he be of you
[48:11] that forsake it not all
[48:13] all that he had he cannot be my disciple
[48:16] his boyars Heavenly Father we thank you
[48:19] for your presence and we pray that you
[48:20] would speak to us Lord these few words
[48:22] that I put you put up on my heart to
[48:24] share with them in Jesus and we ask it
[48:26] amen and him and you would be seated
[48:30] Luke chapter 14 14 in Luke chapter 14

[49:20] husband not wife not children not father
[49:22] mother brother it doesn't matter he must
[49:24] be first
[49:26] isn't that right and the disciple is a
[49:30] follower Elena that's how we have to
[49:33] become not arrogant not nobody got told
[49:36] talked to you not not nobody can tell
[49:39] you nothing because you're so we will
[49:41] tell you when you're so Jesus came and
[49:47] you know we were born in same shape
[49:50] iniquity we didn't stand a chance so we
[49:52] were at that base level

[49:56] come and do something special for us
[49:58] are you are you understanding me now so
[50:01] Gaurav was the calm now and go past your
[50:03] flesh past your human spirit and turn a
[50:06] key inside of you to unlock the

[51:29] than that you have to call them out and
[51:31] show them you have to be my disciple or
[51:33] follower but sit down and think the true
[51:35] and cut the course because this is not a
[51:37] game you're not gonna start if you don't

[51:50] it could be a super Church let's get
[51:52] started right now let's get started
[51:59] or glory the thought I believe there is
[52:02] no limits to the church I believe we can
[52:05] come to a place where there is
[52:06] absolutely no limits one of the
[52:08] testimonies the sister died in church
[52:11] and they were take her to the hospital

[53:14] vaccine and and all these different
[53:16] vaccine doctors discover light and and
[53:18] and the Wright brothers but airplane
[53:21] what is in it and they're these men that
[53:23] believe it could be conquered because
[53:25] courts put man to dominate and to rule
[53:29] the earth man wasn't supposed to be
[53:31] dominated by man was supposed to be the
[53:34] dominate all man was supposed to be in
[53:38] charge man was supposed to be under God
[53:41] having access to the power and authority
[53:43] of God and we see fallen man in His
[53:47] image for all man is a condition
[53:49] dominating with cars technology science
[53:51] and whatever it is they had still
[53:53] dominating because we were built for

[54:35] could decide to walk on water and
[54:38] everybody said that can't be done but
[54:39] Jesus did it I never think Jesus a
[54:41] longer do it Peter did it to further the

[54:54] that you could live better than that you
[54:56] could be inspired more than that what

[1:01:36] to God everything have a cost that goes
[1:01:38] with it
[1:01:38] the revival have a cost ago that revival
[1:01:41] doesn't just happen it really is for
[1:01:44] revival there's a cross of prayer and
[1:01:46] agonizing and groaning and travailing
[1:01:47] and fasting and praying and believing
[1:01:50] unexpected and creating the atmosphere
[1:01:51] people recommend us jumping revival

[1:02:05] for revival glory to God Church on
[1:02:07] laid-back right now they are separate
[1:02:09] they are building of a condition of
[1:02:11] elders there are passes and they could
[1:02:12] they're good they're good but that's not
[1:02:14] what we want we don't want good church
[1:02:17] we want a revised people because you
[1:02:20] have to get the fire in your soul to
[1:02:23] correctly please God

[1:02:37] just some medicine with the amount
[1:02:39] because Joshua don't know the mind of
[1:02:41] God he don't know what pleases God only
[1:02:44] as bullet could redeem as well so when
[1:02:46] you're in the world you have a
[1:02:48] consciousness of the will of God so when
[1:02:50] you're in the world you could live the
[1:02:52] world you could speak the word because
[1:02:53] it's written where it shall a young man
[1:02:56] cleanse this way by taking he to the
[1:02:58] word the word is God so when you're in
[1:03:03] the world the devil has to get
[1:03:04] permission to a proto man that covered
[1:03:07] with that word because the word is a
[1:03:09] protection the word is there sealed but
[1:03:19] the DeMars a liar because it be able
[1:03:20] does make you feel they would not
[1:03:22] powerful read the Bible read their Bible
[1:03:24] for every day but I'm said to get closer

[1:05:34] be he had faith because faith makes you
[1:05:36] praise faith makes you bush'
[1:05:39] faith as a revelation it is the
[1:05:42] substance of what you're hoping for it
[1:05:44] is the power before you get the power
[1:05:46] [Applause]
[1:05:51] hallelujah my god
[1:05:55] all right so this heat have to do with
[1:06:01] the pre for less to have less I know
[1:06:05] where's your word of what your mother
[1:06:06] saying and Farah say you know a brother
[1:06:08] husband and wife it doesn't carry the
[1:06:10] weight of the word of what Jesus said so
[1:06:13] his word is above everything else
[1:06:15] isn't that right so he give examples in
[1:06:18] the street how you could have the
[1:06:20] commitment or a task that's what he did
[1:06:23] by saying which man gonna build wouldn't
[1:06:26] we it out first consider the task that's
[1:06:31] ahead of us so you don't ball and
[1:06:33] straight oh god pressure bank and Jesus
[1:06:36] one time here's those diapers accepting
[1:06:37] my word I need my flesh y'all do life on
[1:06:39] what that under-17 and busted one day
[1:06:41] you say nothing that I go on service
[1:06:47] over for me and Jesus didn't back down
[1:06:50] you say well you go also you could go
[1:06:53] with them you know I'm Peter said Lord
[1:06:55] to whom shall we go now alone has the
[1:06:59] words of it I do I don't understand all
[1:07:01] what you're teaching and preaching but I
[1:07:04] know that the father sent you and I know
[1:07:07] that your words are true it will reveal
[1:07:10] myself are gonna for yourself consider
[1:07:13] the cost of following through to
[1:07:16] completion whatever it is
[1:07:19] what is home whether it's business
[1:07:21] whether it's marriage whatever it is you
[1:07:23] want to see it to completion
[1:07:26] isn't that right and I will close with
[1:07:28] this but around give a story of a man
[1:07:30] who was gonna build a bridge one day
[1:07:33] want to build a bridge in in Australia
[1:07:35] and all the architects come and dig up
[1:07:39] this all and tested it and said it
[1:07:40] cannot be done the whole B is full of
[1:07:42] quicksand and the soil will not hold
[1:07:45] together enough it will shift from place
[1:07:47] to place
[1:07:47] therefore if the bridge would be built
[1:07:48] it would be dangerous try to pass over
[1:07:51] it and finally there was a man who was a
[1:07:54] man of vision a bridge building England
[1:07:57] came over and looked at the Sun he
[1:08:00] surveyed it he tested the soil he
[1:08:01] sounded the water
[1:08:02] he looked over all this and I look over
[1:08:04] all fist and geez amber I'm sleeping
[1:08:07] descriptively red a man buying a ground
[1:08:10] going to meet an army first he set the
[1:08:12] lock on the course now I like the
[1:08:13] reference you have 10,000 in mine come
[1:08:16] on 20,000 no if your fellows Reds
[1:08:19] killing if you like a hundred twenty
[1:08:20] thousand fine if the driver skill is
[1:08:24] better than the buy JCPS cuz you don't
[1:08:28] want to be embarrassed you don't want to
[1:08:31] be ashamed you don't want to be defeated
[1:08:34] so in other words is it adjust your
[1:08:37] position this upon the situation come
[1:08:40] because if you know you can go out and
[1:08:42] fight there don't do it because you
[1:08:45] don't get right out nobody has a good to
[1:08:53] know better don't go and you say anyone
[1:08:54] work for the Lord and because ever taken
[1:08:56] your Alti home in the back make sure
[1:09:00] things are in order they have no place
[1:09:04] that even strip you see your things in
[1:09:08] position isn't alright so what if every
[1:09:11] one of you here the altar this morning
[1:09:13] would sit there in your seats before you
[1:09:17] come to be anointed and would count what
[1:09:21] it means it wouldn't just be going to a
[1:09:23] prayer Mr hazard Lee if we be going with
[1:09:26] a film confidence that God had promised
[1:09:28] it and God was able to keep his word
[1:09:30] this man tested the soils he tested each
[1:09:33] bed in there well dr. quicks done and
[1:09:36] finally he went through official said I
[1:09:37] will build a bridge and it will be safe
[1:09:39] the bridge builders from America
[1:09:42] different parts of the world laughed and
[1:09:43] said this man is mentally ill no man
[1:09:46] could put a bridge across that even for
[1:09:48] chicken will walk on the bridge it would
[1:09:49] be built it would sink the bridge kind
[1:09:51] of standard the vibration of the even
[1:09:52] the dog running across the bridge will
[1:09:54] vibrate the bridge said it will shake
[1:09:56] the silence the bridge will go down it
[1:09:58] could not be done but this man was a man
[1:10:00] of vision he knew what he was talking
[1:10:02] about for something dong in him told him
[1:10:05] he could do it God give us men in the
[1:10:07] church like that
[1:10:10] not observers there some people just
[1:10:13] observe they're doing nothing
[1:10:15] they waitin for you to go down or up if
[1:10:19] they go up they say we do it if we go
[1:10:23] down they on their own
[1:10:27] so in other words you want people that
[1:10:29] believe it could be done we could have a
[1:10:31] revival yeah we could have a church
[1:10:34] where Jesus is walking in it and the
[1:10:37] shot of the king is in the account that
[1:10:39] is what you want do you want that
[1:10:41] let the she'll be in your house first
[1:10:43] let your soul be in your heart first let
[1:10:46] your soul be in your prayer rooms us
[1:10:47] bring him here let's have a big show

[1:14:12] believe they went to trials they had the
[1:14:15] experience I love that listen how he
[1:14:17] placed these words because they were
[1:14:20] tested they believe one they went to
[1:14:22] trials to they had the experience you
[1:14:25] can't just be a believing Christian
[1:14:26] without no experience it has to bring
[1:14:29] you to experience
[1:14:35] bye-bye young people some time because I
[1:14:37] have to Pisa education to a degree

[1:14:44] have to push them into arrogance and
[1:14:45] somebody who don't have quarter of that
[1:14:47] knowledge but have the experience they
[1:14:50] have something that the young people
[1:14:51] don't have they have been through the
[1:14:53] fire down into certain experiences and
[1:14:56] that's why if you're homeless effing

[1:24:13] goes amen
[1:24:21] it's a real blessing and privilege for
[1:24:23] me to be here and I feel like how could
[1:24:27] I say it like one of those lepers that
[1:24:30] got healed and come back to say Tanis I
[1:24:33] want to thank you for who you are and
[1:24:39] how you're part that you played in
[1:24:44] having burelu how he is because not a
[1:24:48] one-way street you would help help sheep
[1:24:51] whole years we've been friends I think
[1:24:54] since 1981 and we have been friends ever
[1:24:56] since and it's truly like if we have the
[1:25:00] same mother he is my brother
[1:25:06] [Applause]
[1:25:10] I feel welcome we feel welcome we feel
[1:25:14] at home we feel part of you and I was
[1:25:20] thinking something else even shared
[1:25:22] something with him I said well you don't
[1:25:23] know what it is to be on the outside
[1:25:25] looking in and it was a blessing to be
[1:25:28] there in that weddin and to see the
[1:25:31] culture of the family connections and so
[1:25:33] on we don't have it like that we don't
[1:25:36] know it like that so it's quite
[1:25:38] enlightening and I was telling him that
[1:25:40] if it had more of that I think that
[1:25:43] there would be so much more support for
[1:25:46] marriages and West and maybe it might
[1:25:49] have had less broken homes unless absent
[1:25:52] fathers I'm so like that but I was
[1:25:57] thinking something even further that we
[1:25:59] as sons of God you know you know like I
[1:26:03] somebody asked me what do I speak I said
[1:26:05] English losting language long time ago
[1:26:14] from before fathers but the thing of it
[1:26:16] is we also lost our language from the
[1:26:20] Garden of Eden so that's why God's for
[1:26:23] mrs. Newton's that we could speak we
[1:26:27] lost our authority we lost our
[1:26:29] inheritance and we are fighting or we
[1:26:32] back home and Abraham he said he was
[1:26:38] seeking a city whose maker and builder
[1:26:40] is going
[1:26:42] so when you get into travelin mode and
[1:26:46] home mode you want to get back to where
[1:26:49] you were before because the sons of God
[1:26:54] had their culture and that culture was
[1:26:56] to have dominion over every creeping
[1:26:59] thing that creepeth upon the face of the
[1:27:02] earth we had our own environment which
[1:27:06] was even a place a garden that God put
[1:27:10] aside especially for the sons of God and
[1:27:13] the enemy of course was kicked out of
[1:27:16] heaven and he came to introduce himself
[1:27:18] to Eve but we are promised another Eve a
[1:27:23] second is that will not be deceived
[1:27:26] we are also promised to go back to the
[1:27:28] very even that our forefathers got
[1:27:31] kicked out of so Adam got put out the
[1:27:33] garden and God is trying to get us back
[1:27:35] to the garden and we are going back
[1:27:38] swings of God on what you feel you are
[1:27:45] doing
[1:27:50] the condition you're gonna straighten up
[1:27:52] your people aim and shoulders gonna
[1:27:55] straight back up you are prince you are
[1:27:59] king you are please you ain't got to try
[1:28:07] [Applause]
[1:28:09] be seated and many a times people talk
[1:28:14] about Israel and they forget that this
[1:28:17] twelve sons Jacob had and those twelve
[1:28:20] sons represented twelve tribes with
[1:28:22] their banners and the culture and
[1:28:24] everything else twelve sons
[1:28:25] praise God hopes of Levi house of Joseph
[1:28:29] holy men house of Ephraim hopes of Judah
[1:28:34] everybody belong to but they belong to
[1:28:36] God and even when the God go back to the
[1:28:39] Jews is a hundred and forty four
[1:28:41] thousand to be caught out out of every
[1:28:43] tribe and we send Gosselaar Eagle
[1:28:45] prophet to call you and I know that we
[1:28:49] can be fitted because we were always in
[1:28:51] the Lamb's Book of Life could never be
[1:28:54] received could never die because you are
[1:28:58] part of him or get a lot of shower what
[1:29:02] put your name on that book

[1:29:24] new season I believe we are ready for
[1:29:28] that dynamics to the mechanic so praise
[1:29:31] God amen you may be seated

[1:33:39] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:33:41] the churches
[1:33:42] our last scripta from relationship to 4
[1:33:44] verse 1 after this I looked and behold a
[1:33:49] door was opened in heaven and the first
[1:33:51] voice which I heard were as it were a
[1:33:53] trumpet talking with me saying come up
[1:33:56] hither I will shew thee things which
[1:33:58] must be Hereafter
[1:33:59] that's one more prayer father God I pray
[1:34:01] that you'll come into your word it's
[1:34:03] like a strange message but Lord this is
[1:34:05] what upon my heart this morning I pray
[1:34:07] you're blessed circumcise our hearts law
[1:34:09] to hear and to receive and speak your
[1:34:11] word in GSM we ask it
[1:34:13] amen amen you may be seated praise God
[1:34:16] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:34:20] hallelujah thank you lord please be the
[1:34:25] Jesus this morning
[1:34:29] behold I have set before thee an open
[1:34:32] door that's my title this morning the
[1:34:35] who have set before thee an open door
[1:34:38] another routine the open book the open
[1:34:42] vision and the open door oh praise be to
[1:34:46] Jesus the open book the open vision and
[1:34:50] the open door oh praise be to Jesus so
[1:34:55] praise God brother Branham talked about
[1:34:57] true worship is in wine and oil that's
[1:34:59] how we have true worship when we have
[1:35:01] the wine and oil together and this is
[1:35:04] what brings on Revelation chapter 5 oil
[1:35:06] and revé oil and wine worship worship
[1:35:10] and and that is the creative atmosphere
[1:35:12] for your point of the Holy Spirit so
[1:35:15] butter brown and this is so strange that
[1:35:18] I got this this church age to identify
[1:35:21] this open door this is where he
[1:35:22] identified and as a resident age each of
[1:35:25] brotherly love please God and the
[1:35:28] Prophet he came
[1:35:31] in the back of the book on the back of
[1:35:38] the silence is supposed to be
[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:48] [Music]
[1:36:55] the loose ends these fellas be back and
[1:36:58] the mysteries come back from God as the
[1:37:00] Word of God and revealed the entire
[1:37:02] revelation of God isn't that right so he
[1:37:06] put Ephesians bridge for us to cross
[1:37:08] over
[1:37:09] isn't that right and now he said we are
[1:37:12] living by the evidence of the new land
[1:37:13] the son of man so what a Branham was the
[1:37:16] evidence to us that this land is real
[1:37:18] this promise is real
[1:37:21] but the vision is for an appointed tank
[1:37:23] so even though we have a revelation of
[1:37:26] what is promised we have to wait until
[1:37:29] that appointed time or glory to God
[1:37:32] hallelujah praise God that's why you are
[1:37:34] we the patients that you wait for this
[1:37:37] to be fulfilled but you wouldn't take
[1:37:39] something that God did not send but you
[1:37:41] were way on the promise because God
[1:37:43] promise will be fulfilled or glory to
[1:37:46] God what you're talking about God
[1:37:48] promised the manifestation of the sons
[1:37:50] of God not just sitting on in church but
[1:37:53] real manifestation of the sons of God
[1:37:56] God promised it oh praise God we believe
[1:38:00] that hallelujah mighty he-man praise the
[1:38:04] name of the Lord glory to God so brother
[1:38:08] Branham he took the seven voices of the
[1:38:12] tundish on the backside and placed it
[1:38:15] under the seven seal on the inside or
[1:38:18] glory to God only the intelligence of
[1:38:21] God could do that God please you in the
[1:38:24] blood section of the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:38:26] so that no nothing could take out your
[1:38:29] name no devil could take out your name
[1:38:31] no minister no Bishop no past I can take
[1:38:34] out your name and whenever God opened
[1:38:36] the door for you no man nobody could
[1:38:41] shut that door I'm going to put the door
[1:38:44] to you the door to your healing the
[1:38:48] total revival the total of Richard the
[1:38:51] total deliverance a door is going to
[1:38:54] open up to you
[1:38:56] [Applause]
[1:38:58] the tour of your dreams that over to
[1:39:02] hoping for but to longing for hallelujah
[1:39:09] praise God glory know God you may be
[1:39:12] seated
[1:39:12] cigar send a prophet to reveal the whole
[1:39:15] mystery of God for the rapture of the
[1:39:17] church he's in a prophet to open the
[1:39:20] book to open the world so the mighty
[1:39:23] angel came down with the book open the
[1:39:26] book is no longer closed so if the book
[1:39:28] is open we could go to any part of the
[1:39:31] book come on now I'm on Church if the
[1:39:35] book is here but this is to bring a
[1:39:56] prophetic vision to you because the
[1:39:58] Prophet body eyes
[1:40:00] he's the seer you will be seated so he
[1:40:02] saw for the entire what took him in 1965
[1:40:06] but the vision he had wasn't a 1965
[1:40:09] vision Desai please the bride is called
[1:40:12] I see a seal to the kingdom of God he
[1:40:15] prophesied are we gonna be here he
[1:40:18] prophesied are we gonna be here do you
[1:40:20] hear what I'm saying seven thunders
[1:40:22] gather the bride together this is what
[1:40:26] we are on the right now seven thunders
[1:40:29] exclusive bride promise or glory to God
[1:40:32] hallelujah praise God you may be seated
[1:40:36] so watch but a Branham was the I age he
[1:40:39] said next is the intelligence
[1:40:41] oh my hallelujah praise God do you
[1:40:44] believe that this is brother Branham the
[1:40:47] message called Christ is revealed
[1:40:48] loanword you say for Jesus himself is
[1:40:52] the interpretation of the Bible when he
[1:40:56] is made manifest in the age that a part
[1:41:00] of the body being made manifest
[1:41:02] so people that argue and fuss and caught
[1:41:05] but when Jesus has been manifest
[1:41:08] that is the interpretation so nobody
[1:41:11] ought to explain this I'm explain that
[1:41:14] and fight with courts but Jesus himself
[1:41:17] made manifest is the interpretation but
[1:41:21] a Branham says it then it come true
[1:41:23] defeat looter
[1:41:24] Wesley then to Pentecostal the tongues
[1:41:27] and the lips no it is the eyes prophetic
[1:41:30] Malachi for there is nothing else left
[1:41:34] for it to come but he himself to step
[1:41:37] into that the next is the intelligence
[1:41:40] and we have no intelligence of our own
[1:41:43] oh praise God in excess what the
[1:41:46] intelligence or the mind of Christ to
[1:41:50] know what he wants done with the world
[1:41:53] because the vision is always for an
[1:41:56] appointed time do it Tara Whitsitt it
[1:41:59] will surely come

[1:42:24] mystery of the architect of how this

[1:50:56] us stand like Joshua and Caleb Caleb
[1:50:58] represent the true believer stay with
[1:50:59] Joshua and he said the watch they said
[1:51:01] just lost the Commission you're washed
[1:51:03] up why not doing something today you
[1:51:04] used to do this and notice is the Lord
[1:51:06] but this wise God sent prophet knew the
[1:51:10] promise of God but also new to wait for
[1:51:14] that promise and this is the problem
[1:51:16] that the people don't want to wait so
[1:51:18] they're interested in keeping it to
[1:51:20] themselves teachers having itching ears
[1:51:23] they finally promised a long of
[1:51:26] transformation on our dynamics so they
[1:51:29] want to hear revelations that I've never
[1:51:31] seen so Oh is true never was a taught
[1:51:37] another thought and another taught and
[1:51:40] never taught but they are coming up
[1:51:42] distorts the word has to remain Mary's
[1:51:45] us
[1:51:48] forty years of war timer revelations but
[1:51:52] there's going to be a brand that gotta
[1:51:54] take this same world and bring it to
[1:51:56] life all glory to God so you know it
[1:52:00] away to the promise yeah what mom says
[1:52:02] because see and when the time come God
[1:52:05] give it to Joshua who stayed with him by
[1:52:08] the word he could not trust others he
[1:52:10] could trust him
[1:52:12] so will it repeat it may be seated
[1:52:15] discovery read Hebrews six and so after
[1:52:17] he patiently endured he obtained the
[1:52:21] promise another Scott veronik patience
[1:52:24] this is perfection written on God and we
[1:52:26] can for God patience is what brings our
[1:52:29] character in us if God give us in
[1:52:31] something like that I hope we have a
[1:52:33] long time there was something else a sin
[1:52:36] a love letter that we letter like let us
[1:52:38] take the thing and lick the stamp and
[1:52:40] put the stamp and hope this letter
[1:52:42] vistacal and then hope she reaches any
[1:52:45] other wait but I took three three weeks
[1:52:47] four weeks to get back this letter to
[1:52:49] say I love you I'm twisted and you
[1:52:50] answer like that it was no I just sent a
[1:52:57] what's up Orson attacks or SMS oh how
[1:53:01] you doing so so so God doesn't have that
[1:53:07] kind of thing to bring character he has
[1:53:10] this drawn out we tweet everyone love a
[1:53:13] son for 25 years no board didn't tell

[1:57:23] father's let me see the praise God
[1:57:29] oh my
[1:57:31] you wait till God begins unknowing this
[1:57:34] bride but the power of God and the
[1:57:37] pillar fire resting on your shoulder
[1:57:49] [Music]
[1:57:51] because because you know who you are you
[1:57:58] know I come from the book is open to you
[1:58:02] I know concept all I set before you an
[1:58:06] open door
[1:58:09] [Applause]
[1:58:19] maybe season let's get a few thoughts or
[1:58:24] glory nigari may be seated
[1:58:25] this age was the age of John Wesley
[1:58:29] Yusei was a brilliant scholar he was at
[1:58:32] Oxford he was a child he and Charles
[1:58:34] became part of the group that were
[1:58:38] spiritually exercised the worship
[1:58:41] listened on the basis of experimentally
[1:58:44] living the truth rather than making
[1:58:48] doctrine their standard so they were
[1:58:51] more interested in living truth than
[1:58:54] discussing truth that's why they come
[1:58:56] the word Methodist mean a method or a
[1:58:58] way it was a way of life that's what the
[1:59:02] Western holiness and the Methodists
[1:59:04] that's where that come from
[1:59:05] there was experimentally living the
[1:59:08] truth as opposed to talking about
[1:59:10] doctrine so when people say we can't
[1:59:12] fellowship because we are living a
[1:59:13] Dutchman you know that is foolishness
[1:59:15] that came in past Wesley's death because
[1:59:19] I don't care what doctrine you have as
[1:59:21] long as have the right spirit and we all
[1:59:23] under the blood of Jesus the blood of
[1:59:25] Jesus cleanses us from all sin and we
[1:59:28] are selling one with another that has
[1:59:31] nothing to do with doctrine that's a lie
[1:59:34] of the devil that is satanic doctor on
[1:59:38] the similar or Satan
[1:59:42] [Applause]
[1:59:45] let me see that they drew up a spiritual
[1:59:49] guide of works such as giving to the
[1:59:51] poor visiting the sick imprisoned during
[1:59:55] his lifetime he could have acquired vast
[1:59:56] wealth but he did not his favorite scene
[2:00:00] on the subject of money was are you
[2:00:02] ready
[2:00:03] get all you can perceive a man it's just
[2:00:09] the same of whiskey get all you can see
[2:00:12] it all you can and keep all you can come
[2:00:15] we get a lot some praises get save and
[2:00:23] give so it it should also be mentioned
[2:00:27] that Wesley never the desire to build a
[2:00:29] work upon the nominal sectarian business
[2:00:31] and so on
[2:00:32] oh my Don was a daddy is of 88 having
[2:00:36] Steve got a few men but they even to
[2:00:37] think you may be seated
[2:00:39] I want to just share something with you
[2:00:41] a man of that age or even today I'm
[2:00:43] making the same mistake as the Jews took
[2:00:46] refuge in a synagogue for worship so in
[2:00:49] Philadelphia age they were taken refuge
[2:00:51] in the church it is not joining a church
[2:00:54] that counts the life is not in the
[2:00:58] church the life is in Christ this is the
[2:01:02] record gonna give us eternal life and
[2:01:04] this life is in his son Jesse but urbana
[2:01:07] I'm backing up his teachings with the
[2:01:09] scriptures isn't that right
[2:01:11] he said he that had the key of David
[2:01:13] beautiful prayers and he's a Christ the
[2:01:17] perfect realization contrasted with
[2:01:20] passion realization just wanna go
[2:01:22] further
[2:01:23] Isaiah 20 to 22 and the key of the house
[2:01:26] of David with a layup on his shoulder so
[2:01:28] he shall open a nunchuck shut and he
[2:01:31] shall shut anon shall open the spirit
[2:01:34] uses his Old Testament reference
[2:01:36] concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his
[2:01:39] ministry in the church what the key of
[2:01:42] David signify at that time is a mere
[2:01:45] shadow which is not fulfilling Jesus tan
[2:01:48] in the mists of the lampstands it has to
[2:01:50] do with our Lord after his resurrection
[2:01:53] the pilgrimage but what does this key
[2:01:55] signify the answer lies in the position
[2:01:59] of the key it is not in his hand
[2:02:02] it is not worn around his neck it is not
[2:02:04] placed in the hands of other men though
[2:02:07] the verses could not be seeing that here
[2:02:09] on yahoo has the use of that key for he
[2:02:13] alone opens and shuts and no man has the
[2:02:16] right budgies himself isn't that right
[2:02:18] but where is the key it is on his
[2:02:21] shoulder but what does the shoulder have
[2:02:25] to do with it Isaiah 9:6 and the
[2:02:28] government shall be upon his shoulder
[2:02:31] the answer this phrase garment upon his
[2:02:34] shoulder come from the wedding ceremony
[2:02:36] of the east when the bride has been
[2:02:40] committed to the groom
[2:02:41] she takes off her veil and places it
[2:02:45] over the groom's shoulder signifying
[2:02:48] that not only is she under his Dominion
[2:02:51] but she has transferred her rights to
[2:02:54] him that he is the head and also that he
[2:02:59] bears the responsibility and the care
[2:03:02] that he and he alone no one else nor a
[2:03:07] man nor the power had any right and
[2:03:09] responsibility and that beloved is the
[2:03:12] key of David God being sovereign he
[2:03:15] foreknew by divine decree exactly who
[2:03:18] would be in the bride he chose her she
[2:03:22] did not choose him he called her she did
[2:03:26] not come on her own
[2:03:27] he died for her he washed her in his own
[2:03:31] blood he paid a price for her she
[2:03:34] belongs to him to him alone she is
[2:03:36] wholly committed to him and he accepts
[2:03:40] the obligation he is her head for Christ
[2:03:44] as the head of the church a serie called
[2:03:46] Abraham Lord
[2:03:47] even so the bride is happy that he is a
[2:03:49] lord he speaks and she obeys but that is
[2:03:52] her delight but men have but has been
[2:03:56] heeded his truth for their esteem his
[2:03:58] body who alone has a sovereignty over
[2:04:01] the church I said no here we go for in
[2:04:05] every church
[2:04:07] the church has been gone like a
[2:04:08] hierarchy a priesthood apostolic
[2:04:12] succession closing the door of mercy and
[2:04:14] grace Dillman will and instead of
[2:04:16] assuming the love and the responsibility
[2:04:19] of the church it has been mercenary lust
[2:04:21] preyed upon her and destroyed her I want
[2:04:25] to salute Pastor Hulu Oh as I'm here
[2:04:29] custom we we were Nigerian name Oh
[2:04:33] hallelujah because I see the love we
[2:04:37] have for his people
[2:04:38] I see the care here for his people and I
[2:04:41] admire that
[2:04:42] that's why I look for real Shepherds
[2:04:44] take care of the sheep okay the Lord a
[2:04:47] shout God thank you Jesus hallelujah
[2:04:54] hallelujah you may be seated
[2:04:57] so listen to this so after the Wednesday
[2:04:59] age I come to Methodist age have been
[2:05:01] established to take roots one of the
[2:05:03] greatest among the Protestant churches
[2:05:05] something took place Jesus said an open
[2:05:07] door yeah we could be for the church
[2:05:09] before they entered into loud is an age
[2:05:13] so in this Philadelphia age he's I set
[2:05:15] before thee an open door he opened the
[2:05:18] door before loud easier and this open
[2:05:21] door have to do with no messenger it was
[2:05:23] God Himself the Holy Ghost now he went
[2:05:27] on to say that Philadelphia now Asia
[2:05:30] this door is just between the
[2:05:32] Philadelphian and the loudest and age is
[2:05:35] a lap over now right now the Lord said
[2:05:37] in the end of that age I am the door to
[2:05:40] the sheepfold
[2:05:41] now the door was open between two ages
[2:05:44] 1906 when the Methodist Church & Dwight
[2:05:47] Moody and and faded from the scene there
[2:05:49] come a break thought of those people
[2:05:51] receiving the Holy Ghost so when God
[2:05:54] opened the door to break out the
[2:05:56] Pentecostal ear there was no man
[2:05:58] messenger
[2:05:59] there was no man releasing the Holy
[2:06:01] Spirit there was no man given the Holy
[2:06:03] Ghost God just open the door and see
[2:06:06] more and all them Pentecostal people
[2:06:08] they move inside of it because they saw
[2:06:10] what promise stones and speaking in
[2:06:13] tongues and signs and wonders and they
[2:06:15] were in a basement in a prayer meetin
[2:06:17] and they got in an atmosphere
[2:06:19] because they saw that God promised that
[2:06:21] gives to be restored and they cut in the
[2:06:24] atmosphere create an atmosphere for
[2:06:26] these gifts to come down the open door
[2:06:29] was there and they step into it and
[2:06:31] don't come the Holy Ghost or glory to
[2:06:34] God God haven't changed the open door
[2:06:37] God have that shift of the open door the
[2:06:39] open door still remains that's why the
[2:06:46] spirit follows the blood from the book
[2:06:49] of redemption
[2:06:50] whenever the blood is at this very gonna
[2:06:53] be there oh you are Oh glory may be
[2:07:03] seasoned you are under the blood right
[2:07:05] now you don't see your phones and your
[2:07:07] feelings and the mystics and your
[2:07:09] failings because you're under the blood
[2:07:10] here and your prayer prayer coming true
[2:07:12] the blood or glory to God in the under
[2:07:15] the blood you are perfect
[2:07:16] Oh holla you hear what I said shoot that
[2:07:19] blood you are perfect that's nothing
[2:07:21] against you I don't get what the devil
[2:07:23] bang in your mind it's what God said oh
[2:07:25] how long guess nothing against you
[2:07:28] he said it Oh hallelujah glory to God
[2:07:33] that's why the word justification is so
[2:07:36] powerful justification is the me to
[2:07:39] never did it God says hit and what it
[2:07:41] was he record where's the record where's
[2:07:44] the evidence he take all your service
[2:07:46] chocodiles sea of forgetfulness here
[2:07:51] don't forget it God can bring it back up
[2:07:56] do you understand we are going back into
[2:07:59] an atomic condition
[2:08:01] [Music]
[2:08:02] [Applause]
[2:08:04] do you understand that when brother
[2:08:06] branham said son come on and sign for it
[2:08:08] is rollback the storm that was Adam
[2:08:12] again on you it a man just like you and
[2:08:17] I born in sin skip iniquity running from
[2:08:22] the storm and go tell him go back up to
[2:08:24] the song
[2:08:25] speak to the storm and he spoke to the
[2:08:28] storm and the storm had to obey him
[2:08:31] [Applause]
[2:08:33] [Music]
[2:08:34] listen the storm the storm had no choice
[2:08:38] [Applause]
[2:08:43] my my my you may be seated
[2:08:46] Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[2:08:50] you you understand how these brothers
[2:08:52] are moving you understand will be like I
[2:08:54] could take his mantle and they strike
[2:08:55] the river and River open up he not even
[2:08:59] talking to the river
[2:09:02] he said River you know what I want to do
[2:09:06] I want to walk I am want a bill no boat
[2:09:08] its water walking
[2:09:12] [Applause]
[2:09:17] well Jesus didn't even have to open up
[2:09:19] river he just walked on the water
[2:09:21] [Applause]
[2:09:31] [Applause]
[2:09:42] [Music]
[2:09:51] so you may be seated
[2:09:53] so therefore in between these two ages
[2:09:55] was an open door it was a revelation of
[2:09:58] the deity of Jesus Christ but he is God
[2:10:01] it was a restoration of the name of
[2:10:03] Jesus Christ because I named was lost
[2:10:05] and fast and holy goes under lucha but
[2:10:07] here it was restored back I know Wesley
[2:10:08] I once the name was restored the spirit
[2:10:11] was yet to back it up isn't that right
[2:10:13] Oh glory to God so I said before an open
[2:10:16] door if you want to see the revelation
[2:10:18] here it is where you would village
[2:10:19] church I'm the only way that he could
[2:10:21] take his churches back to the revelation
[2:10:23] of what he is not what if I fall is not
[2:10:30] what the Prophet is what what he is
[2:10:33] because he William Branham is the
[2:10:36] messenger he came to bring a message
[2:10:41] that Jesus wife
[2:10:44] [Music]
[2:10:45] [Applause]
[2:10:48] do you get it now William Brennan was
[2:10:51] the messenger he had a message to give
[2:10:55] the wife of the Lamb
[2:10:57] so the message was the open book and the
[2:11:01] open book supposed to give you a
[2:11:02] prophetic vision to see the open door
[2:11:05] and to hallelujah praise God there are
[2:11:11] two sets of people foolish virgins wise
[2:11:15] virgins Oh hallelujah
[2:11:17] who is gonna be a wise wizard they kept
[2:11:20] the episode Oh hallelujah
[2:11:23] Oh praising the Lord for a banner from
[2:11:27] the guy at the finishing of the seventh
[2:11:29] seal the mystery of God should be
[2:11:31] finished don't know who God is what he
[2:11:34] is how he lives his nature his being
[2:11:38] he's supposed to be all the way up there
[2:11:40] by that time to bring us into the full
[2:11:42] touch of the son or daughter of God the
[2:11:44] finishing of the seventh seal we
[2:11:47] supposed to be way up there that a who
[2:11:49] God is his nature how he lives
[2:11:52] glory to God and we said sometime the
[2:11:55] reason that God tell Joshua marries it
[2:11:58] Anna would be a knight because we don't
[2:12:00] know God torts and you kind of go by
[2:12:04] your feelings to interpret God's will
[2:12:06] God's will is his word so in your
[2:12:08] marriages on the way you get an
[2:12:10] understanding of course thinking on the
[2:12:13] matter and how God feel about the issue
[2:12:15] so when cortisol kill all a momma rights
[2:12:24] I'm so so I'll tell Samuel I have done
[2:12:29] the will of the Lord and Samuel say but
[2:12:31] what is bleaching I am here in there
[2:12:34] I keep somebody best sheep to offer unto
[2:12:37] the Lord she said well when I was open
[2:12:40] he said obedience you want to do that
[2:12:42] when go today to kill everything plus
[2:12:44] yeah a guard behind a hidin God want
[2:12:49] obedient I told the church back home or
[2:12:52] B there's another option
[2:12:54] it's a requirement the be seated praise
[2:13:00] God hallelujah praise God
[2:13:03] so no man can come to me I have set a
[2:13:06] door I have the keys I am the only one
[2:13:09] that can open it but I'm say Christ
[2:13:11] alone is the revealer of the divine
[2:13:14] revelation of Jesus Christ no other man
[2:13:16] could do it we could preach shall be
[2:13:18] blue in the face it will take the spirit
[2:13:20] to reveal to you so while we are
[2:13:22] preaching as we're revealing things on
[2:13:23] foolin things that is a lord givin you
[2:13:26] revelation
[2:13:27] no man can stop that it's the operation
[2:13:30] of God
[2:13:30] it's the spirit here speaking the world
[2:13:33] and the spirit down there reveal in the
[2:13:35] world
[2:13:36] it must be divine revelation is upon
[2:13:38] this rock I will build my church and the
[2:13:40] key that I would never reveal again said
[2:13:42] so quad give the kiss of Hell a space a
[2:13:44] time maybe about half an hour to fight
[2:13:47] up with this thing
[2:13:48] let the key for him fight to protect but
[2:13:50] one day the silence will be broken and
[2:13:53] [Applause]
[2:13:54] all what God filled in that silence will
[2:13:58] be unveiled all blue and if William

[2:14:04] the mighty God it will be a bride that
[2:14:07] will say the same thing she go to unveil
[2:14:10] God you cannot unveil what you have not

[2:28:45] right so we noticed you me see said I
[2:28:47] wanna get something here now we notice
[2:28:49] this problem of the fourth true or false
[2:28:52] believers are already in the existence
[2:28:54] of the second age these who falsely call
[2:28:57] themselves Jews appear right after the
[2:28:59] first four point of the first age that
[2:29:01] is hardly an accident indeed it is not
[2:29:02] an accident it is a principle of Sita
[2:29:06] the principle is to organize and claim
[2:29:09] originality and therefore be entitled to
[2:29:13] special rights and privileges let me
[2:29:16] show you back there is minor age these
[2:29:19] people lied and said they were actually
[2:29:20] Jews or believers and they were not I
[2:29:23] remember a pastor tell me see beloved
[2:29:25] somebody's brothers because we in
[2:29:27] Congress some characters are not right
[2:29:28] here but receive some innocence have
[2:29:34] they ever met Jesus when you consider
[2:29:37] some of the behaviors and attitudes
[2:29:38] do they know Christ or they just believe
[2:29:42] a message see but some point in time you
[2:29:45] have the me Christ I need to meet Christ
[2:29:48] is only one effect when you meet Christ
[2:29:50] it humbles your heart and spirit no man
[2:29:57] ever come in the presence of God and
[2:29:59] raise up arrogant no man not even John
[2:30:03] John say I fell as one dead Daniel fell
[2:30:07] as one dead as I as the worries me when
[2:30:10] they break into the supernatural but a
[2:30:12] Brannon found himself on the corner
[2:30:14] knocked out and that was the vision that
[2:30:18] was not even the seven angels coming
[2:30:19] here SS division
[2:30:26] but rather they were sit-ins organized
[2:30:30] crowd as it wasn't that age we saw the
[2:30:33] start of men in the ministry
[2:30:36] I already taken an unwarranted
[2:30:40] leadership over the minister and
[2:30:43] brethren that is the beginning of Bishop
[2:30:50] three my ministry bigger than your
[2:30:53] ministry now you see my ministry so you
[2:30:56] have a tiny ministry I'm gonna come in
[2:30:58] to take over
[2:30:59] I really is that I taught one is a
[2:31:03] finger and one is a foot and one is an
[2:31:05] eye and one of them knows I thought all
[2:31:07] belong to the same buddy you're needed
[2:31:08] knows I need a mount you need her ears
[2:31:11] near the right ears and either fingers
[2:31:17] when a young man creamed up all if I
[2:31:20] fall you know in trouble one but in
[2:31:24] India ask me are we gonna have an
[2:31:25] international pasta i said and then i
[2:31:27] said we then we have an international
[2:31:28] poop typically trained to bring it like
[2:31:36] we need this man this city
[2:31:39] yeah we need a man but in mine Christ
[2:31:41] Jesus
[2:31:45] if a man have that man we'd be happy for
[2:31:47] that manner if you fail in that man that
[2:31:50] is mean but he can't pedal a man you
[2:31:52] can't push a man this is my let me say
[2:31:57] it again
[2:31:57] they were sit-ins or a nice crowd for it
[2:32:00] wasn't that age we saw the start of men
[2:32:03] in the ministry taking an unwarranted
[2:32:08] leadership over their minister and
[2:32:11] brethren bishops set up in districts
