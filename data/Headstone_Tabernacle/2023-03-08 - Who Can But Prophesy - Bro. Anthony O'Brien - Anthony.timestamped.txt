[32:07] we want to go to the Book of Amos and
[32:08] the Old Testament and two scriptures in
[32:11] the New Testament would be second Peter
[32:13] 1 and Revelation 10 I want to read from
[32:16] tonight just to get our contacts for a
[32:18] little message here praise God you see
[32:21] what the Lord will speak to us amen
[32:24] Amos chapter 3
[32:27] and you want to read from verse one amen
[32:39] praise God
[32:41] Amos chapter 3
[32:44] from verse 1 says Hear this word that
[32:46] the Lord had spoken against you o
[32:49] children of Israel
[32:50] against the whole family
[32:53] which I brought up from the land of
[32:55] Egypt saying you only have I known
[32:58] of all the families of the earth
[32:59] therefore I'll punish you for all your
[33:01] iniquities
[33:03] can two walk together
[33:04] except they be agreed
[33:06] will a lion roar in the forest when he
[33:09] hath no prey
[33:11] will a young lion cry out of his den
[33:15] if he had taken nothing
[33:17] can a bird fall in a snare upon the
[33:20] Earth
[33:22] is for him
[33:24] shall one take up a snare from the earth
[33:26] and have taken nothing at all
[33:28] shall a trumpet be blown in the city and
[33:31] the people not be afraid
[33:33] shall there be evil in a city and the
[33:36] Lord had not done it
[33:37] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[33:40] but he revealeth his secret unto his
[33:42] servants the prophets
[33:44] the lion hath Ron who will not fear
[33:48] the Lord God had spoken who can but
[33:51] prophesy
[33:53] amen a second scripture we take from
[33:55] second
[33:57] Peter chapter one and skipping on to
[34:00] verse 19
[34:04] it says we have also
[34:07] a more sure word of Prophecy
[34:10] where unto ye do well that you take heed
[34:14] as unto a light that shineeth in a dark
[34:16] place until the day Dawn and the day
[34:19] star arise in your hearts
[34:21] knowing this first that no Prophecy of
[34:25] the scripture is of any private
[34:28] interpretation
[34:29] for the prophecy came not in all time by
[34:32] the will of man
[34:34] but holy men of God
[34:36] speak as they were moved by the Holy
[34:40] Ghost
[34:40] amen amen
[34:42] last scripture you want to read now from
[34:44] Revelation 10 and we know this
[34:48] praise God but we wanna
[34:51] amen look at it again and I saw another
[34:53] Mighty Angel come down from heaven close
[34:55] to the clown a rainbow appalls upon his
[34:57] head and his face was as with the sun
[35:00] and his feet as pillars of Fire
[35:02] and he had his hand a little book open
[35:03] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[35:06] and his left foot on the earth and cried
[35:09] with a loud voices when a lion roared
[35:10] when he had cried seven Thunders uttered
[35:14] their voices and when the seven Thunders
[35:16] had uttered their voices I was about to
[35:18] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[35:19] saying unto me seal up those things
[35:21] which is seven Thunders uttered and
[35:23] write them not and the angel which I saw
[35:25] stand upon the scene upon the Earth
[35:27] lifted up his hand to heaven
[35:29] and swear by him not live it forever and
[35:31] ever who created heaven and the things
[35:32] that they're in all on the earth and the
[35:34] things that they're in on the sea and
[35:36] the things which are therein that there
[35:38] should be time no longer but in the days
[35:40] of the voice of the seven Angel when he
[35:43] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[35:45] should be finished as he had declared to
[35:48] his servant to the prophets The Voice
[35:50] which I heard from Heaven speak unto me
[35:51] again and said go
[35:53] and take the little book which is open
[35:55] in the hand of the Angel which standed
[35:57] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[35:58] went unto the angel and said unto him
[36:00] give me the little book and he said unto
[36:03] me take it and eat it up and it shall
[36:05] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[36:07] thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[36:10] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[36:12] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[36:14] as honey and as soon as I had eaten it
[36:16] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[36:19] thou must prophesy again before many
[36:22] peoples Nations and tongues and Kings
[36:25] may God have blessing to the reading of
[36:27] his word delicious bow heads and praise

[39:04] have is actually in four parts here amen
[39:07] um
[39:08] uh four parts of this thought right and
[39:11] I'm just going to kind of give a quick
[39:12] breakdown because I feel I may not get
[39:14] to it if I get to ahead of myself even
[39:17] praise God but uh amen praise God bless
[39:20] bless God Amen you know the prophet
[39:22] talked about prophecy isn't that right
[39:24] and he said to prophesy means to tell of
[39:27] an experience or to foretell something
[39:30] that's fixing to take place amen isn't
[39:33] that right prophecy is from the very
[39:35] mouth of God himself praise God and
[39:38] whatever is spoken is of words of God
[39:41] from the very thoughts of God in other
[39:43] words he was thinking it in his mind
[39:45] before it was spoken he was thinking it
[39:47] in his mind before it was said but it's
[39:50] not good for just for it to remain in
[39:52] his head or for it to remain it is mine
[39:54] he had to express his thoughts he had to
[39:58] express what was going to happen or what
[40:01] was going to take place and that
[40:03] expression is what come from thought to
[40:05] word so when we have the word of God as
[40:08] we have tonight what we have is the very
[40:11] thoughts of God Express oh isn't that
[40:14] right and the word of God concerning you
[40:16] is the thoughts of God expressed
[40:19] concerned in your life concerning who
[40:22] you are concerning what you are to do
[40:24] who you are to be or everything in your
[40:28] life or everything is ordained of God
[40:30] the footsteps of the righteous are
[40:33] ordered of the Lord there's nothing that
[40:35] happens that God doesn't know about
[40:37] there's nothing that happens that God
[40:40] has not foreseen there's nothing new
[40:42] Under the Sun God never has an aha
[40:45] moment God never has a oops I made a
[40:48] mistake that's not how God operates he
[40:50] lives in an infinite World he is an
[40:53] infinite Corps oh isn't that right we
[40:57] are just finite beings isn't that right
[40:59] that's why we need Revelation because
[41:02] Revelation is when God reveals to us
[41:05] something that was hid in his mind she
[41:08] from before the beginning God had in his
[41:11] mind
[41:12] Eternal thoughts concerning you in his
[41:15] mind he saw you heal in his mind he saw
[41:18] you delivered in his mind he saw you
[41:20] restored in his mind he saw you
[41:22] receiving the Holy Ghost in his mind he
[41:24] saw the devil defeated in his mind he
[41:27] saw you defeating the devils in his mind
[41:29] he saw you running out the squatters in
[41:31] his mind he saw you as a warrior you
[41:34] were
[41:34] conquer us to him that loved us unto him
[41:38] that called us from the beginning for
[41:40] who he found you he called and who he
[41:42] called it Justified and who he justified
[41:45] tonight he has already glorified
[41:49] somebody say Amen tonight oh there's a
[41:52] prophecy concerning your life that
[41:55] prophecy cannot fall to the ground my
[41:58] words shall not return unto me void but
[42:02] it shall accomplish the purpose that I
[42:04] shed forth for it to be accomplished the
[42:08] word of God has already been spoken and
[42:10] when I'm nippled and speaks the
[42:12] miraculous must take place oh
[42:16] oh is anybody hearing me tonight oh
[42:19] there is a word concerning you tonight I
[42:22] don't care how many tea rooms there are
[42:23] I don't care how many temples they are
[42:25] in the universe they cannot stop the
[42:28] purpose of God it cannot stop the
[42:31] prophecy of God in that prophecy you're
[42:34] gonna be perfected in that prophecy go
[42:37] to a church the prophets or church
[42:39] Martin and Seb Marching In humility only
[42:43] without a blemish without a spot walking
[42:46] in righteousness walking in Holiness
[42:49] walking in Purity only five lives that's
[42:52] who you are tonight oh I am who God says
[42:56] I am somebody say amen I am who God said
[43:01] I am not what the devil says you are
[43:03] forget about the devil forget about his
[43:06] mind forget about his thoughts God has
[43:09] thoughts towards you tonight
[43:11] oh
[43:13] oh you don't hear me tonight
[43:15] oh man
[43:21] four parts
[43:22] of this first part I have is revelation
[43:26] so
[43:27] prophecy
[43:29] now this is the Eternal mind of God
[43:32] his thoughts concerning you from that he
[43:35] could prophesy
[43:36] but you and your finite mind can't catch
[43:39] up with that
[43:40] you can never understand that
[43:42] praise God because his daughter infinite
[43:45] man's taught in the morning if it
[43:48] blossomed by the evening time it
[43:50] perishes
[43:51] that is
[43:53] that is not God's thoughts God's
[43:56] daughter from eternity to Eternity there
[43:59] is no end to it Hallelujah when he
[44:02] thought about you he loved you when he
[44:04] thought about you he wrote your name in
[44:05] blood whatever could stop that whatever
[44:09] could break that whatever could break
[44:11] that contract that Covenant that God has
[44:14] with you oh God always keeps his word
[44:18] he always keeps his appointments he
[44:21] always keeps his agreements because he
[44:23] is called and he gets the ability to
[44:26] keep his agreement
[44:28] be promised to deliver you then he's
[44:31] going to deliver you if he promised to
[44:33] restore you that he's going to restore
[44:34] you then not enough devils in hell that
[44:37] could stop that God the devil is already
[44:39] defeated once God opens his mouth oh
[44:43] oh the devil is already defeated what
[44:46] God opens his mouth oh you don't hear me
[44:49] tonight
[44:50] [Applause]
[44:54] you know you have a you don't even have
[44:55] to do nothing
[44:57] all you have to do is speak
[45:00] a word
[45:01] the Bible says the worlds were framed by
[45:04] the word of God so that things will
[45:07] challenge you out that appear in front
[45:09] of us were made by things that you
[45:11] cannot see there's a higher there's a
[45:14] bigger place on this more real than this
[45:17] and the world was framed by the word of
[45:20] God therefore anything you need to match
[45:23] anything you desire if you have faith to
[45:27] reach up and believe that there is a God
[45:30] out there somewhere who put this whole
[45:33] thing together
[45:34] has the ability to speak into your life
[45:37] oh to heal you to deliver you to restore
[45:42] you to set the captain free he could
[45:45] create a new kidney he could create
[45:47] spleen liver he's a creator of all
[45:49] things oh hallelujah hallelujah
[45:53] hallelujah
[45:55] oh man
[45:58] [Applause]
[46:00] do you believe that tonight
[46:02] so revelation
[46:04] Revelation is prevailing power
[46:07] isn't that right
[46:08] the Gates of Hell will come against it
[46:11] but the promises they will not prevail
[46:14] oh they may shake it they may scream at
[46:17] it they may Pelt bombs at it but not no
[46:21] weapon formed against it can prosper
[46:23] because they cannot Prevail oh
[46:26] Hallelujah cancer kicked against
[46:27] revelation
[46:28] hey man's not right Hallelujah
[46:32] Deuteronomy 29 29. the secret things
[46:36] belonging to the Lord oh God but those
[46:39] things which are revealed belong to us
[46:42] those things that are revealed belong to
[46:45] you don't let the devil steal your joy
[46:48] if God reveal you your joy just Joy no
[46:52] man give you my joy no man take from you
[46:56] the devil's a liar tonight you were
[46:59] supposed to have joy you are you
[47:01] supposed to be able to smile in the
[47:04] midst of your trial that he and his
[47:06] wisdom send your way to test your
[47:10] spirits to see if you really come from
[47:13] God to prove to the devil who you are in
[47:17] this evil age that could send a pride on
[47:20] the earth to stand every trial stand
[47:23] every test stand every circumstance
[47:25] though the flood come this way though
[47:28] the fire come that way God put something
[47:31] in our hearts tonight that's the reason
[47:33] I came here that's reason I made it
[47:36] because God put us faith in us the
[47:39] standard tests somebody say Amen
[47:45] Hallelujah
[47:47] glory to God hallelujah oh I need a
[47:51] pride to answer answer the call tonight
[47:59] who cannot promise her all right
[48:04] after
[48:06] I have to build into this yeah all right
[48:08] but those things are revealed belong to
[48:09] us and talk children forever and ever
[48:11] that we may do all the words of this law
[48:13] so how could you even do the words if it
[48:15] isn't revealed to you how can you even
[48:17] know what to do if you had the trumpet
[48:19] turn on a certain sound how are you
[48:21] gonna prepare yourself for that battle
[48:23] isn't matter ash you gotta know what it
[48:25] is therefore Revelation has got to come
[48:28] to you to open your mind up as to what
[48:31] God's desire is and so what God's
[48:34] requirement is so that you can even
[48:36] fulfill it
[48:42] so even to come into that prophecy
[48:44] it takes a revelation
[48:46] Hallelujah isn't that right
[48:49] Revelation what God reveals to us in his
[48:51] word
[48:52] It's New to You
[48:54] but it's not new to God
[48:56] he always noticed it always was he just
[49:01] peel it back a little bit to show you
[49:03] what it was and now that you see what it
[49:06] was it gives you Faith to stand it gives
[49:09] you Faith to speak it gives you Faith
[49:12] because Revelation opened up something
[49:14] to you Flesh and Blood didn't reveal it
[49:17] to you but it was caught and reveal it
[49:20] to you Flesh and Blood can't reveal this
[49:22] word they have the word and books and
[49:24] tips but they're not Revelation that's
[49:27] why there's so many divisions among us
[49:28] because the teachers like the Revelation
[49:31] to rightly uh uh speak the word isn't
[49:35] that right and teach it praise God isn't
[49:37] that right so because misrepresented
[49:39] some people say this and say that but
[49:42] the word Still Remains true praise God
[49:44] with the right Revelation with the right
[49:46] interpretation praise God you could have
[49:49] whatever God has promised for you you
[49:53] could step right into the prophecy with
[49:56] the right revelation
[50:00] oh I'm gonna get to it praise God
[50:02] hopefully you get it tonight amen all
[50:04] right
[50:07] Revelation so it's four parts it's
[50:10] Revelation I have faith
[50:13] then vision
[50:15] and then prophecy
[50:17] isn't that
[50:18] so we start a revelation
[50:20] that's our first part here right nothing
[50:22] new Under the Sun it's not right
[50:25] and Thy Word of Lord has settled Heaven
[50:27] forever
[50:28] that's what David said isn't that right
[50:29] in the Psalms it's not it is God showing
[50:33] us revealing to us something that always
[50:35] was in his mind
[50:37] and then Revelation is what gives you
[50:39] faith but Revelation is Faith isn't that
[50:42] right a previously hidden truth now they
[50:45] finally revealed to you who you are who
[50:48] God is and who the devil is oh
[50:51] hallelujah hallelujah so you're not
[50:53] standing on your own thoughts not
[50:54] standing on your own ideas that's not
[50:56] what brought us all this long way when
[50:59] we look back 50 plus years in this
[51:01] message after the prophet left many came
[51:03] and many left but you are still here
[51:06] that's something that God put inside of
[51:08] you you couldn't do that yourself some
[51:11] seeds fell by the wayside some seeds
[51:13] fell upon thorny but some of those seeds
[51:16] fell upon good ground God knows who the
[51:19] good Crown is so he sold the seed
[51:22] confidently knowing that you had a heart
[51:24] you had the right attitude to receive
[51:27] the word of God for your day oh and now
[51:30] that you've received it what is the
[51:32] secrets the word is in the bride now

[52:57] so see it's God showing to us somebody
[52:59] always was in his mind
[53:01] another Revelation gives you feet it's
[53:04] not right and what is Faith Hebrews 11
[53:07] the evidence of Things Not Seen holders
[53:10] to the prophecy come a lot of the times
[53:12] they come at a time when you can't see
[53:14] it but it's still true a lot of the
[53:17] times a prophecy come and you cannot
[53:19] receive it because if you judge with
[53:21] your eyes you'll get very discouraged if
[53:24] you use your hands your Victory
[53:26] discouraged because it goes past the
[53:28] five senses it have nothing to do with
[53:30] what you could feel what you could smell
[53:33] what you could touch God told Abraham

[54:03] don't care what you're facing what
[54:04] you're going through God has spoken a
[54:08] word over here and everything has got to
[54:11] line up with the spoken word of God oh
[54:15] Hallelujah because that's how the world
[54:17] was created oh it's not right there was
[54:21] Darkness everywhere there was confusion
[54:23] everywhere but God didn't stop to have a
[54:25] conversation with the darkness God
[54:27] invited with the darkness he didn't
[54:29] quarrel in the darkness he just speak

[56:48] [Music]
[56:56] one of the big secrets to this is that
[56:59] it has to be spoke
[57:01] it has to be spoken it has to be
[57:04] expressed God loved you but he loved you
[57:08] so much that it was bubbling over in his
[57:10] heart when he thought about you so he
[57:13] had to speak it he had to say something
[57:15] he had to do something about his love he
[57:18] had to do something about the thoughts
[57:20] that was in his mind so he spoke a word
[57:23] and that word and it's time and in its
[57:26] season it's gonna come into a
[57:29] manifestation and you are gonna be the
[57:32] expression of the thought that was in
[57:34] his mind all along
[57:36] oh Hallelujah I'm not what I ought to be
[57:39] but I'm not what I used to be I'm coming
[57:42] on to something coming under something
[57:44] we Bypass or theophany we prolonged into
[57:47] sin tested tried God allowed all of that
[57:50] but the prophecy kind of come to pass

[58:30] glory is of Faith a revelation of his
[58:33] word fate always speaks to a future
[58:35] state
[58:36] which is prophecy it's not it connects
[58:40] with prophecy but you need it in order
[58:42] to connect a prophecy otherwise you'll
[58:44] be living in the flesh
[58:45] and he'd walk after the flesh walk after
[58:47] his own lust and so forth but he'd walk
[58:49] in this after the spirit they are the
[58:51] sons of God am as many as are led by the
[58:54] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[58:57] they speak my inspiration they become
[59:00] channels of communication for God to
[59:02] flow through them because they begin to
[59:04] think like God and act like God begin to
[59:07] line up with the things of God because
[59:09] there's a prophecy concerning them oh
[59:11] Hallelujah there was a prophecy
[59:14] concerning Mary isn't that right Mary is
[59:16] just carrying water Mary is just doing
[59:18] her part mayor's getting ready to be a
[59:20] sponsor Joseph she was getting on looked
[59:23] like life was getting better for her
[59:24] raise a pay and whatnot all of a sudden
[59:27] an angel come down from heaven to
[59:30] interrupt the flow to interrupt the
[59:32] program of things to bring up prophecy
[59:35] to bring our prophecy to shake up our
[59:38] world everything that happened after
[59:40] that angel came was turned on his head
[59:43] Hallelujah because prophecy here come to
[59:46] interrupt the program and prophecy it
[59:49] God sent unto us Elijah the prophets
[59:53] what for to turn our hearts back to the
[59:56] faith of Horrors prophecy therefore when
[59:59] that prophecy was released oh it had to
[1:00:02] find you it had to find me it had to
[1:00:05] find us it came and it interrupted our
[1:00:07] program interrupted Our Lives higher it
[1:00:10] found you on the streets it found you on
[1:00:12] the sidewalk it found you wherever it
[1:00:14] found you some of us in the Baptist

[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:00:32] not a devil could watch

[1:00:50] oh my okay
[1:00:52] state it is evidence of what you cannot
[1:00:56] see that is fake so I'm trying to
[1:00:58] connect it to the prophecy praise God
[1:01:01] because it's not just like

[1:08:40] Eagle Peak and hook it into Mama Bird's
[1:08:43] promises oh God it's obligated to meet

[1:08:52] promises he promises he promises it he
[1:08:55] promises he promises he promises he
[1:08:59] promised to fill you he promises he
[1:09:02] promised to heal you he promises he
[1:09:05] promised he'd give you victory over the
[1:09:07] devil he promises he promised that every
[1:09:10] seed shall bring forth after its own
[1:09:13] kind he promised a passage shall possess
[1:09:17] the gates of the enemy that's a prophecy
[1:09:20] hanging over every seat Abraham hanging
[1:09:23] over every one of you inside of here
[1:09:25] possess the kids of the enemy
[1:09:28] Hallelujah
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:37] oh my
[1:09:39] Hallelujah
[1:09:40] Hallelujah
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:46] Hallelujah
[1:09:51] it's a prophecy
[1:09:52] gotta be connecting with
[1:09:54] hallelujah we're not venturing out
[1:09:56] on our own assumptions hallelujah praise
[1:09:59] God on anything
[1:10:01] but we're holding on to his word
[1:10:03] because he promised he promised he would
[1:10:06] do it oh and God is
[1:10:09] guilty
[1:10:11] until he brings his promise to pass
[1:10:14] he is guilty of speaking a word and not
[1:10:16] fulfilling it if he don't bring it to
[1:10:19] pass
[1:10:20] so if God promised to heal you then hold
[1:10:23] to God's promise if God promises heal
[1:10:26] you then hold to that promise hold on
[1:10:30] like Jacob hold on hold on like Mary
[1:10:34] hold on hold on and wrestle hold on and
[1:10:38] stay there stay there all night long if
[1:10:42] you have to stay till the breaking of
[1:10:44] the day but I need somebody to cry how
[1:10:47] to admit I need somebody to press their
[1:10:50] oil with me if you know that God
[1:10:53] promised to do something for your family
[1:10:56] catch a person
[1:11:01] Let It Rock You In The Nights let it
[1:11:04] wake you up let it not catch you rest
[1:11:07] until God fulfill his promise Lord of
[1:11:10] Sanctified Lord I've done all I can but
[1:11:14] oh God I need the fire all things are
[1:11:17] ready let the fire pour
[1:11:25] oh my my
[1:11:28] [Music]
[1:11:29] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:32] who Glory
[1:11:34] Glory
[1:11:36] huh
[1:11:37] [Applause]
[1:11:39] my
[1:11:43] okay
[1:11:45] oh my time is running
[1:11:47] so prophecy
[1:11:50] isn't that right
[1:11:52] oh
[1:11:55] there's a prophecy over here
[1:11:58] you didn't know it all the time but it
[1:12:00] was over you then it's still over you
[1:12:02] now
[1:12:03] but what got you here won't get you
[1:12:05] there you need a little more faith to
[1:12:07] reach up and grab a hole and I promise
[1:12:10] so God speak a word to you and let you
[1:12:13] know the Time of the Season somebody's
[1:12:15] fixing to take place now your faith has
[1:12:17] something to hold on to the prophecy was
[1:12:19] always there but now it's revealed to
[1:12:22] you now it's made known to you like I
[1:12:24] was made known to Mary like I was made
[1:12:26] known to Simeon oh you shall not see
[1:12:29] that until you see the Lord's Christ
[1:12:31] save us made known to him now he had
[1:12:34] something to hold on to he never was
[1:12:37] going to see death but that prophecy was
[1:12:39] spoken over him and that anointed is
[1:12:41] fake to believe the god of the
[1:12:43] impossible would make his vision
[1:12:45] possible would make his Prophecy from
[1:12:48] the past so he went to the temple every
[1:12:50] day looking for his prophecy and tonight
[1:12:54] we come into the temple we come in on a
[1:12:56] Wednesday night this is where what you
[1:12:59] doing on a Wednesday people at home
[1:13:01] kicking back relaxing what you hear no
[1:13:03] ends there because you see your
[1:13:05] Birthright you gotta hold us something
[1:13:08] and
[1:13:09] something I got to get what I came for
[1:13:12] I'm thirsty I'm hungry I'm desperate I
[1:13:18] need something a little more than what I
[1:13:20] got in order to make it in this prophecy
[1:13:24] hallelujah thank you Jesus Oh Glory
[1:13:30] thank you
[1:13:33] oh you are blessed tonight you are
[1:13:36] highly favored to see what you see and
[1:13:39] to hear what you hear because feet come
[1:13:41] by here and here in the word of God
[1:13:43] you've got faith tonight the little
[1:13:46] remnants you know that there's a spirit
[1:13:48] out there waiting to catch you away that
[1:13:52] little bride she's waiting for her
[1:13:54] spirit her life to come to her brother
[1:13:57] Branham said no other life can work in
[1:14:01] this bride we need this life second one
[1:14:05] Peter Paul one through one four two
[1:14:07] seven that life has got to come into you
[1:14:10] that's the only life that we want to
[1:14:13] work with not a man's interpretation not
[1:14:15] a man's idea not a man's opinion but
[1:14:19] what the prophet revealed what was
[1:14:21] locked up in the mind of God is what is
[1:14:24] spoken over you tonight and by faith we
[1:14:27] are present towards it tonight
[1:14:33] we're pressing towards it
[1:14:35] we believe it
[1:14:37] with all our hearts
[1:14:40] amen
[1:14:42] okay
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:46] so this is prophecy now Amos 38.
[1:14:50] amen God do nothing unless he Reveals
[1:14:52] His servants the prophets it's not right
[1:14:55] so it had to come spoken amen that's
[1:14:58] right
[1:14:58] through a prophet
[1:15:00] to reveal what it is
[1:15:03] that our faith had to connect to
[1:15:05] in order to bring it to pass
[1:15:07] amen it's not right I think it was in
[1:15:09] the prayer meeting but over talk about
[1:15:11] I'm wrong it's not like praying there
[1:15:14] seeking the Lord knowing that it was a
[1:15:16] promise that God promised their fathers
[1:15:19] he would send a deliverer and all of a
[1:15:21] sudden here come the vision here come
[1:15:24] the prophecy you're gonna bring forth a
[1:15:26] son and that that that Vision slid right
[1:15:29] into the prophecy praise God concerning
[1:15:32] the Redemption of the children of Israel
[1:15:33] unto their own land isn't that right oh
[1:15:37] man praise God hallelujah
[1:15:40] so that's another part to it now isn't
[1:15:42] that right we've got to cry out
[1:15:46] because the Bible said he heard the
[1:15:48] cries of his people
[1:15:50] now when Moses already born and he was
[1:15:51] 40 years in the wilderness isn't that
[1:15:53] right and he was sojourning there it
[1:15:55] seemed as though the prophecy would not
[1:15:57] come to pass because this deliverer That
[1:16:00] was supposed to come and save the people
[1:16:01] was out there lost and undone without
[1:16:03] God and his son
[1:16:05] isn't that he's kind of wandering to and
[1:16:07] fro praise God but when God looked at
[1:16:10] his watch he recognized that time had
[1:16:13] come for the deliverance and the cries
[1:16:16] of the children of Israel went up to the
[1:16:18] Heirs of God and he remembered the
[1:16:21] promise that he made to their father
[1:16:24] Abraham
[1:16:25] same with Almighty hand I'm gonna bring
[1:16:28] my people out into their own land a land
[1:16:32] flowing with milk and honey
[1:16:34] they're gonna possess the gates
[1:16:36] so when he saw that the time was ready
[1:16:39] Town come a burning bush God's Gonna
[1:16:42] interrupt the program interrupt the
[1:16:44] season interrupt what's taken place
[1:16:47] because the time of Deliverance has come
[1:16:49] and when your time of Deliverance has
[1:16:51] come God's Gonna Move doors he will open
[1:16:54] doors he will shut doors he will bring
[1:16:57] down kingdoms he will raise up Kings for
[1:17:00] his name's sake for the election
[1:17:03] shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about
[1:17:07] to do seeing that he is heir of the
[1:17:10] earth and tonight how can God hide from
[1:17:13] his elect what he's about to do seeing
[1:17:16] that you are going to Reign on the earth
[1:17:19] just like John said all in heaven heard
[1:17:23] our John praise God when he saw the
[1:17:25] things I will reveal in the book oh
[1:17:29] Hallelujah he jumped and he shouted you
[1:17:31] better jump and Shout tonight oh
[1:17:33] Hallelujah because it's coming
[1:17:36] oh Hallelujah
[1:17:44] all right
[1:17:47] we already read this now but I'm
[1:17:49] connecting I want to connect the
[1:17:51] prophecy now
[1:17:53] to this
[1:17:54] right okay so here it goes okay yeah so
[1:17:57] momentary consideration and show changes
[1:17:59] will prove how accurate this thought is
[1:18:00] right
[1:18:01] now Genesis 1 11 let every seat bring
[1:18:03] forth after its own kind isn't that
[1:18:05] right the seed was in the earth before
[1:18:06] the word came
[1:18:08] do you believe that because he speaks
[1:18:10] let every seat bring fought after his
[1:18:12] kind he's speaking to the seed therefore
[1:18:14] the seed was already there therefore
[1:18:15] when you command the Earth you have
[1:18:17] something in you praise God that he just
[1:18:19] had to speak over because the seed was
[1:18:22] already landed in you the seed
[1:18:24] Hallelujah in YouTube you are not a
[1:18:26] Believer but the word in you is a
[1:18:28] Believer pray the word that he puts in
[1:18:30] you from before the foundation of the
[1:18:32] world that's what he is connecting with
[1:18:34] when he speaks over you oh Hallelujah
[1:18:38] the potential to bring forth the word in
[1:18:41] your season
[1:18:42] to do what God says you're supposed to
[1:18:44] do and to manifest what God said you're
[1:18:46] supposed to manifest isn't that right oh
[1:18:49] my Hallelujah okay so so that's you so
[1:18:52] you got that right the seed is already
[1:18:53] in here it was already laying there and
[1:18:55] before God sent a message he had to have
[1:18:56] a people in the land to receive that
[1:18:59] message
[1:19:00] praise God and tonight there's another
[1:19:01] people in the land who under the
[1:19:03] messenger are gonna be the final voice
[1:19:05] to the final age praise God they'll have
[1:19:09] the voice of God in them praise God as a
[1:19:11] prophecy concerning you more prophecies
[1:19:14] praise or we're just going to keep
[1:19:16] prophesying tonight praise God
[1:19:18] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:21] oh man
[1:19:23] praise God so right so come after that
[1:19:25] quote now right now decent Church
[1:19:27] momentary consideration uh consideration
[1:19:29] of the church history will prove how
[1:19:31] accurate this thought is and in the Dark
[1:19:33] Ages the world is almost entirely lost
[1:19:35] to the people but God sent Luther with
[1:19:37] the word the Lutheran spoke for God at
[1:19:39] that time but they organized and again
[1:19:41] the pure word was lost
[1:19:43] for organization tends towards doctors
[1:19:45] and Creeds and not simple word oh so
[1:19:47] that's why God don't like this man-made
[1:19:49] thing
[1:19:50] oh fake leaves praise God that's what I
[1:19:53] keep doing and holy spirit kept moving
[1:19:55] out and trying to find somebody else
[1:19:57] that will surrender to his word that he
[1:19:58] can speak through because he has
[1:20:00] something to say and he can't have
[1:20:02] anything blocking or hindering the flow
[1:20:04] of God no man-made interpretation no
[1:20:07] man's ideas no man's opinions okay so
[1:20:09] you have to find channels that he could
[1:20:11] speak through
[1:20:12] and that's what he got in every age and
[1:20:14] in this age he's gonna find you pray
[1:20:17] somebody say Amen or unhindered you're
[1:20:20] gonna be a channel out of your belly
[1:20:23] shall flow rivers of Living Waters even
[1:20:28] more work Sundays shall you do because I
[1:20:30] go unto my father
[1:20:37] they could no longer speak for God
[1:20:41] so then God said Wesley and he was a
[1:20:43] voice of the word in his day and so on
[1:20:45] and they keep happening right when the
[1:20:46] Methodist feel God raise up others and
[1:20:48] so on to go through all the years until
[1:20:49] this last day there is again another
[1:20:52] people in the land who under their
[1:20:54] Messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:20:56] final age that's a quote there now
[1:20:58] prophecy is always two things there's no
[1:21:00] the prophet and his prophecy what he
[1:21:03] actually says isn't that right the one
[1:21:06] who spoke it and the prophecy itself
[1:21:08] so therefore the word has to be spoken
[1:21:11] in order for it to be accomplished
[1:21:13] isn't that right Prophet said why are we
[1:21:16] not a nomination now then the
[1:21:18] circumcision of the Old Testament is in
[1:21:19] the flesh but in this new testament Joel
[1:21:21] said I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[1:21:24] Flesh and your sons and daughters shall
[1:21:26] prophesy he said another word prophecy
[1:21:28] doesn't mean to teach the prophecy means
[1:21:31] either to tell an experience on
[1:21:32] inspiration or foretell something that's
[1:21:34] fixing to take place amen and we have a
[1:21:37] prophet tonight who is God's mouthpiece
[1:21:40] malachite for William Brown of is
[1:21:41] Narayan and the prophecy which will be
[1:21:44] the word of God fulfills when it is
[1:21:46] fulfilled it's not right praise God so
[1:21:50] there's got to be a people that's gonna
[1:21:52] rise up under that messenger who will be
[1:21:55] the Fulfillment of the prophecy that was
[1:21:57] spoken that's why you are here tonight
[1:21:59] that's why you came through all that
[1:22:02] Darkness came through all those trials
[1:22:04] came through all those tests all those
[1:22:07] persecutions why so that you can fulfill
[1:22:10] prophecy oh somebody's got to do it some
[1:22:13] he's got to pray somebody's got to call
[1:22:16] upon God if not you then who if not here
[1:22:20] then where if not now then when oh come
[1:22:23] on brother I didn't come all this way
[1:22:25] just so occupy a church bench no no no
[1:22:28] no no no no I'm gonna press my will
[1:22:31] towards what God said because he
[1:22:34] promised it and he spoke it and the
[1:22:37] devil is already defeated he's a liar
[1:22:39] tonight everything I want God already
[1:22:42] has for me I just have to reach up and
[1:22:45] grab it
[1:22:46] and catch a hold of my promise
[1:22:49] for my day Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[1:22:54] so Elijah prophecy isn't that right it's
[1:22:57] what shut the heavens it's not right
[1:22:59] Elijah the Tish bite was of the
[1:23:01] inhabitants of Gilead reading the
[1:23:02] scripture here said unto Ahab as the
[1:23:04] Lord God of Israel live it before whom I
[1:23:07] stand there shall not be due or rain
[1:23:09] these years but according to my word oh
[1:23:14] isn't that rhyme so the heavens will
[1:23:16] shut up
[1:23:17] until that prophecy could come to pass
[1:23:19] until the word had to come from Elijah
[1:23:22] Prophet to unlock that same Heavens that
[1:23:25] he shot there by prophecy isn't that
[1:23:28] right so until the word of the Lord come
[1:23:30] to that same Prophet nothing could move
[1:23:32] it's not it was a dried up there was
[1:23:35] famine in the land
[1:23:36] now today there's a famine in the land
[1:23:39] oh Hallelujah but that's coming for the
[1:23:42] abundance of rain but it has to come by
[1:23:44] the prophecy
[1:23:46] oh
[1:23:48] oh Hallelujah gotta come by that Prophet
[1:23:50] oh honey it's got to come through a
[1:23:53] prophecy you've got to take a key and
[1:23:56] unlock the door and the key tonight is
[1:23:59] Page to unlock the promises of God
[1:24:02] because behind that door is the Dynamics
[1:24:05] that you are looking for the Revival
[1:24:07] that you are looking for is right behind
[1:24:09] that door but you've got to have feet
[1:24:12] tonight to turn here and unlock the
[1:24:15] promises of God to your life
[1:24:20] and that key
[1:24:21] come true a prophet
[1:24:23] Malachi foreign
[1:24:32] but it takes fate take a revelation to
[1:24:35] see it to see your promise for your day
[1:24:37] in your season and to speak it by
[1:24:39] Revelation and to sow the seeds oh
[1:24:42] Hallelujah isn't that right so all these
[1:24:45] years since the prophet left oh
[1:24:47] Hallelujah we've seen something in the
[1:24:49] world seven Thunders seven voices seven
[1:24:52] Church ages that teach us what seeds the
[1:24:56] soul because we couldn't have our seven
[1:24:58] tunder Revival until we saw seeds for it

[1:25:44] rock upon which I stand and God will
[1:25:47] build his church not upon the
[1:25:50] nominations but upon a rock or the
[1:25:53] revelation of Jesus Christ I'll build my
[1:25:56] church and the Gate of Hell cannot
[1:25:59] Prevail against it

[1:29:49] sensation but until they be a dude with
[1:29:53] power from on high that's what we are
[1:29:55] waiting on that's what we're looking for
[1:29:58] that would be an expectation for I don't
[1:30:01] care about no interpretation I don't
[1:30:03] care what no no man has to say I want to
[1:30:06] see the Lord God omnipotent come down
[1:30:09] with his fire and baptize All Souls and
[1:30:13] seal us into that portal cap
[1:30:15] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:30:18] Fire that's what I'm looking for tonight
[1:30:20] somebody say Amen somebody praise

[1:30:34] okay almost there
[1:30:37] amen just about five more minutes just

[1:30:43] until the prophecy come to pass into the
[1:30:45] word of the Lord come to that prophet
[1:30:48] and on the third seal the brides the
[1:30:49] prophet said the bride hasn't had a
[1:30:51] Revival yet
[1:30:54] it's been no Revival there
[1:30:57] so shut up the whole thing is shut down
[1:30:59] try no manifestation of God to say the
[1:31:01] bride yet see that's the condition we
[1:31:03] see now
[1:31:04] but he said we're looking for it now
[1:31:07] because we know that it's out there
[1:31:09] somewhere God is not a liar his prophecy
[1:31:13] is true the time may be long but don't
[1:31:16] Atari wait for it
[1:31:18] Revelation give us Vision to wait for
[1:31:21] his vision his prophecy to come to pass
[1:31:24] we're connecting with the tonight we're
[1:31:26] connecting with it this evening
[1:31:27] hallelujah oh my
[1:31:31] [Music]
[1:31:33] God see the world was framed by the word
[1:31:34] of God which means the word itself is a
[1:31:36] framework through which the mind of
[1:31:39] Christ the intelligence could come
[1:31:40] through and interpret his thoughts
[1:31:43] so the word comes the interpretation of
[1:31:45] his thoughts that we could catch and
[1:31:48] understand and believe unto his prophecy
[1:31:51] because a word is a mental state a word
[1:31:53] one day it's gonna become seed it's
[1:31:56] going to come manifestation in your life
[1:31:59] do you believe that Isaiah 55 says as a
[1:32:02] word praise God torture my worthy but
[1:32:04] come down praise God it shall not return
[1:32:06] void but it shall accomplish a purpose
[1:32:09] that I set forth for it to accomplish
[1:32:12] isn't that right therefore it means a
[1:32:14] word is not supposed to remain word but
[1:32:16] the word have one mission to accomplish
[1:32:19] a purpose to accomplish a purpose
[1:32:21] therefore what is a purpose what is the
[1:32:24] purpose called sending a bride on the
[1:32:26] edge it was a try her it was approved to
[1:32:29] the devil that she is not like Eve that
