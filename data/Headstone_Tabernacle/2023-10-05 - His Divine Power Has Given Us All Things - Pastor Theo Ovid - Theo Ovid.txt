upon you may you bless your oncoming Services coming Sunday father May there be an explosion of your Holy Spirit May the shout of the king be in the camp then Jesus we ask it amen may God bless you thanks again for coming out tonight if of your Bibles I'd like to tune the three portion of scripture tonight Romans 8 we're going to read from verse 20 to 32 second Corinthians 6 we want to read from three to ten and II Peter 1 verse 3 and verse 4. reading from Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also Justified and will be justified then we also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us and this is the verse I want to get to tonight he that speared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things and second Corinthians 6. the universe 3 from second Corinthians 6. given no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed but in all things are proven ourselves as the Ministers of God in much patience in afflictions and Necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in two months in labors in Watkins in fastens by pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love on faith by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand on the left by Honor and this Honor by every report and good report as deceivers as yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed a sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possess him all things our last scripture reading from second Peter chapter one verse 3 and 4. according as his divine power had given to us all things that pertained the life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having us keep the corruption that's in the world true love let's pray one more time father we thank you for your word and Lord I just thank you for your word tonight in a special way may you bring Revelation and inspiration to your people in Jesus amen you may be seated o praise God it's great to be here tonight good to see all of you out amen understand there's some bad weather coming a couple of hours tomorrow but we're good to be here tonight and enjoy the Lord enjoy his word amen okay so tonight I have a title and this title is his divine power has given unto us all things now the scripture you read in second uh in in um in second Peter they said according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain under life and godliness through the knowledge of him so it's true the knowledge of him not just and there's two kind of knowledge there is the knowledge which is like the intellectual part and the knowledge of knowing part so you can read all about buddhi over it and say I know him he's from Trinidad so on social because people read that but if you haven't met the man you're ready how much do you know the man so there's two parts to this knowledge and there's knowing amen praise be to Jesus you love him tonight all right have a context scripture which is a Romans eat for as many years are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear so as we get closer as we get more of God fear leaves users questions leave us don't leave us and he said we have not really spread a bunch of fear but we are received the spirit of adoption not adoption the spirit itself we had witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs once you say you are child you are Heir if children then ears you cannot separate children from Air you can't be a child not a Heir once you are a child you are heir of what the father has could you say Amen somebody if children then is that's the whole message myself eight children then ears ears of God and joint is with Christ so if we start if we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God all right let's look at that and be Amplified for all who are led by the spirit of God are sons of God for the spirit which you have not received is not a spirit of slavery to put you once more in bondage to fear but you'll receive the spirit of adoption the spirit producing sonship the Bliss of which we cry Abba Father the spirit himself testified together with our spirit assuring us that we are children of God and if we are his children then we are heirs also kind of separated if you are his if we are his children we are heirs also amen what we preached last week Wednesday night going back to returning back to your inheritance going back to where amen what God ordained for you you have to get back somewhere God will just call us to drift into salvation and just drift out to the nomination God call us out to put us in so if we are getting yet we still have to get in because the purpose of God in Redemption is in two parts bringing us out of and going into so you've got to go into what God promised I don't care if you're old 90 and nine praise God or you're just born you still have to win the god promise praise God where Joshua Caleb or a whole bunch of people crossing over you still have to go to the promise God promised them the promised land Oh Glory to God a bunch of old heads couldn't make it but they had Next Generation made it and if we don't make it there's another generation that go to make it because God can't lie if it's one thing about God he could can't lie he don't have innated alive whatever he said is truth whatever is he said must come to pass he even said my word shall not return on me void but then shall accomplish your purpose to accomplish one thing about God he never tell a liar he will tell the truth all the time the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die welcome the Lord some Praises but the devil is a liar how do we know every time you open his mouth he's lying so if we are his children then we are heirs elves also Heirs of God and fellows with Christ what which is sharing his inheritance with him only we must share his suffering if we are to share his glory but what what I for I consider the suffering of this present time this present life are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us and in us and for us and conflict on us Oh Glory to God our glory to revealed in to by you and get the Lord some Praises for the whole creation all nature with expectantly and Longs earnestly for God's Sons to be made known wait for the revealing or the disclosing of their sonship so God have to identify our sonship that we are sons of God not sons of the Earth not sons of Tijuana not sons of the Earth but sons of God and sons of God Walk Like God talk like God live like God act like God manifest God or give the Lord a shout in the house praise God praise God Ephesians 4 11 says and he gives some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the early father of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God you have to come into that knowledge of the Son of God onto a perfect man unto the stature of the fullness of Christ Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God oh that's the calling now that you're coming to the knowledge of the Son of God oh glory to God somebody could know about uh the country but they never registered before they could go near encyclopedia they could say on Google they could Google Trinidad and know the GDP I know who's the Prime Minister and who is this person but they have never been to Trinidad so they know Trinidad by that reading and writing but they have known Trinidad by coming to Trinidad they experience Trinidad where people could know the Bible and don't know God Oh Glory to God they have a knowledge of the word but they do have a knowledge of God oh glory to God and to know him is life or give the Lord some Praises but the Bible is God and print form so people that have the knowledge of God without knowing god okay the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God through the knowledge of him who is him who what knowledge the knowledge of Christ it's not right praise God praise God praise God so then Peter we didn't finish really rest exceeding great precious promises and besides this virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness and so on he said if these things be in you you shall neither be Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he has lack of these things as blind one can't see a file two and forgotten that he was put from his own sins Oh Glory to God because that is not established in the prison system like somebody shared with me she see somebody talking about you squeeze the orange what you get oven juice why because the orange and he squeezes again harder way good more orange juice because the orange so when you squeeze people and you see malice come out and hatred come out and evil come out wait wait he's done with this other day you can't you can't squeeze and get all what not inside of there is what's inside of there and if you put Christ inside of there what does squeeze and they come on okay the Lord some Praises so Christ Under Pressure will still produce Christ okay the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah so the pressure comes to show and expose what's inside of us all of us isn't that right o praise the name of the Lord praise God wait for the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure but if you do these things you shall never fall praise God and but abandon preacher message called possessing all things he said we are poor yet possess all things he called Abraham he called him to separate himself from everything come out you know people you might think here but Brandon I sometimes I'm tempted to steal or sometimes I'm tempted to smoke or sometimes the woman think I'm tempted to dress like the people of the world you know anymore clothes I'm tempted young ladies you think that's tempting what about over here where you've got to watch every little move to watch in the ministry what a great thing it is and we have more to answer for because you have to answer for your own Souls but we have to answer for everybody we speak to so Satan just constantly where you say isn't that a pretty little dress it's all wrong to wear isn't it beautiful it'll fit me just right where is it and you know that's wrong but in the ministers you've got to go to this meeting and it's so great on the congregation I have to wait to hear from God not a mama to watch too so don't think that we have it easy and the states have any uh the people have it easy they must have been easy no we have to fight the Devils you fighting and more than that too because the devil want the children the minister every time because Smite the shepherd the Sheep scatter so if you could wreck the top then the whole thing fall down that's why fatherhood and parenting and whatnot that that's why families are broken because that there's a devil's job to wreck God's people before there was a church there was a family in the gardener Eden Adam and Eve God and fellowship and atmosphere and then the Satan saw an opportunity to step into the serpent because the serpent was so close to man stepped into that and he wasn't herself a snake was talking and he's taking an opportunity to step to communicate the eve and the first thing he asked what did God say because God didn't talk to him he didn't have the word he didn't have the seed he had no information upon what God had said Oh Glory to God and when he finished with you so she was finished and then Adam eat and then they died and that's why we are here tonight green and getting old praise God and everybody think they could be young all the time and they could be strong all the time but even things I said I said Sunday if things going good right now it will always go good because everything have a season and time if they're going smooth it will never go smooth because every season everything has a time for everything under heaven and if things going bad right now it wouldn't always be that way Oh Glory to God you believe that the Abraham had to watch himself and we're going to go down and a great story on the road back he met the possessive him on Earth which is the king of Jerusalem king of Salem I watched he had no father no mother he never did begin he never will end nothing else but the almighty and he met him on the road from the slaughter of the king he met the possessor the one who owned all things met him on the road back what a glorious thing you want to get to know I like this Abraham was heir to All by the promise so he could lay claim to everything that was in the lamb the lamb itself Abraham had been given the promise we understand that Abraham was the poorest man in all the country because they live out in the desert he lived in peace with God and lot Rich live in the city become the governor of the city he sat in the gate he was a judge judging the city all the riches and Abraham was in a desert perhaps the poorest man in the land and yet a claim to possess all or tonight we may not be rich in world's Goods but we possess all things the church itself possesses all things but there's a statement there's a factor whether you see it or not understand it or not that is still soil God not taken back that you know that God not a God's emotional the church itself possesses all things whether you're blind whether you're ignorant whether you don't know it's still possess all things Oh Glory to God you will wake up tonight hallelujah praise God yet poor yet Rich possess all things and today the True Believer is constant among the people called fanatic holy ruler some kind of insulting name but blessed are the meek but they shall inherit the earth you talk about push out in the cabin somewhere hardly enough money to pay a rent yet you owe it all have to work on tall and straight for a few dollars at the honest living to put shoes in a children's feet to Feed The Hungry Monk and yet or after everything there is the meek shall inherit the earth they possess it they are possesses of the earth what is the believer the believer has that title The Believer has an abstract deal do we are believers here tonight I am talking about you the Believers have a title they believe I have an abstract deed that by right by Jesus Christ oh give the Lord some praises and Abraham could possess that to him what was on it God give it to him and lot was part of that land so even though Allah was a sucker God Abraham knew that man was his own and luck was part of that man so he could go after that sucker and I was wondering what adoption is about we'll give the Lord a shout you know people talk about adoption but they're kindly but they leave out the part about going after the loss adoption that second in church and having my church and having a glorious time Dynamic adoption Oh Glory to God adoption is going after your Fallen brother the backseating brother not your Eternal lost no the lost brother in the message that's what adoption is about okay the Lord a a praise in the house Oh Glory to God abduction not you sitting in church it had people dying fall off the map fall into the crack somebody gonna go after them because their name is on the book and they we can't go until they come or give the Lord some Praises you hear what I said we can't go until they come and God will make that a living reality to wake you up inside of here or give the Lord some Praises oh blessed be the name of the Lord says no you made me a promise that was this this land and all in mind you made me a promise no my King's man has been taken and all he got is gone in other words so he's switching off from that natural type to what we will see today in other words if I apply today as a church could say Lord God here's my brother he's linear strict with cancer get the answer Gideon we're talking about coming in the car here he's talking about the cancer he's tricking with tuberculosis he's got so and so I lay a whole of the promise it's my possession you told me so there you are then you can go after an enemy that devil this person have a stroke this person have a cancer this person have been crippled this person whatever it is it wasn't blind and you can say Lord I claim it and I'm going after them they may not have the faith but I come to unite my faith with them to get them out of that condition you're not coming to God to bless them you know you're coming for God to deliver them all to the condition to break the pans of wickedness to break the the pants of evil or glory to God you anointed and commissioned Oh Glory to God you are part of this Mark 16 last year church or glory

time Holy Ghost Pentecostal blessing That Rocks the devil and kick and fly him a good as Believers intellectual knowledge and you believe this and you believe this and you've seen it so and from that angle and that angle keep your angles give me signs one of the Miracles keep your angles Give Me Jesus Christ keep your angers and your Mysteries and give me the Lord himself when everywhere with them confirming the word which signs following okay the Lord some praises praise God praise God praise God glory to God I don't think the people have caught their rights yet they're still in church there's people of safety and what what does trouble me is the spirit of entitlement they feel the entitled to the Rapture and God blessings tale and dead like a cospan church go to one of their Church I'd rather hot or cold we fight in deadlines for years I will always blast deadness I was always blast formality it's a demon it's a devil it's a no praise demon and no worship demon Oh Glory to God we have to fight it we'll give the Lord some Praises because we want to create an atmosphere for him to come down Among Us Oh Glory to God he said there will be a church with Jesus walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp how could Jesus walk in a church and the church dead Liars Jesus not in the church they have cheers in the church we're going to be worshiping him we're going to be praising him we're going to be honoring him oh glory to God will be a confirmation and a Vindication that Christ is in the church and I'm prophesying from the prophecy that there will be a church but Jesus walking in it not some evangelist not some Pastor teacher or Prophet but Jesus walking in it oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God can you take some more tonight yet Abraham had a right to the promise and the promise was his yet he had to fight to possess it there you are the believer today we are heir to all things we are here to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the bible promises you have to have to fight every inch of it that's the way God God is set up now I read his word I will just go to hundreds of time over the years a a tired with this

that's the way God got it set up that's the way what is set up no no no no the middle still get it set up that way no God guys it'll always been that way you have to fight to possess what you know is your own so the revelation of the word comes to reveal to you what is yours oh this is good tonight this is the message when it comes to you that this is yours you cannot make claims if it's not yours the devil will not respect you if you make a claim that is not yours because only when it is yours you have the strength of Faith to make a legal claim if the land is not mine I can run it I can run and squatters out I looking for Big Stone and looking for a Healer would they come and take me you want to know you're not even sure it's yours when it's better chance where's the deed where's the evidence approaches where's the evidence your father leave this land for you on your grandfather great grandfather say well either one final when you go and find it then come back because I live in here for 15 years and you can't put me out unless you have the title unless you have crypto Authority because the devil is moving with wishes I wish you leave then nothing but wish him away could you have covered coffee and we'll discuss it and have a compromise and you will leave gently the Bible says they have to run the mountain they have to make them free you know it's a roughing kind of Kingdom of gods of a violence the violent take it by force so you can't just say what the devil is we're living together no you know I mean no no no no okay you don't know that you're alone because if you know your children are your land your property your land whatever God gives your land then you could fight you guys are not accepting that maybe you accepted it all the while it come like when you you're in slavery and you're accepting this is the punishment your Lost Property your lost money I know your whole family into slavery and and nobody want to redeem You Average Uncle is arrested he mean like the devil even opened me wanted to pay for nothing it have them with them your way when the Jubilee trumpet come it enforces God's law that they return back to what the inheritance and you know nobody can stop you because it's God's law so when you're walking out no no no no no no no I'm Pharaoh no no no ma'am slave master could pull you back you have a right to walk out you have a right to go back you have a right to say this is mine this is God's law this is the word now you have to give up oh could you imagine you come to your Jubilee time your Jubilee here your sickness have to leave [Applause] maybe that year might start for you today maybe it might start for you tonight and you want to get freedom in your own mind you have to get it like how Hannah got it when Hannah moved from that praying trying to get back Vengeance against the other woman who was carrying on with the foolishness went with joy because she said Lord if you give me your man child I'll give him back to you she change a prayer and it changed her whole life it changed the continents it changed her operation and as soon as you get it right your whole continent is going to change you'll recognize wait a minute I don't have to live this way no you could be free and who does Solomon set free it's free indeed oh glory to God give the Lord some Praises when Israel was beginning to leave Egypt the devil still taught Pharaoh still taught he they belong to him he think they must run away slaves and that time they were loosed from the hand of the enemy okay the Lord I shout so when you're walking away from bondage the devil always believed you are his one he want to take you back but tell the devil you belong to him you belong to God tonight don't give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah let's go the promise is yours but if you ever get it if you ever get it so you see a man with a promise manifested you know what happened know every son that commit to God must be try I'm tested because you have to be considered Worthy full Glory that God will give me these promises so the promise is yours but if you ever get it you Ingo to get it easy I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan Satan captures your health you have a right to go to sleep and say give it back hand it over I come in the name of the Lord the possessor of heavens and it I am his Heir give it back you took my child you gotta mix up with the wrong boy you took my boy you're gonna mix up with the wrong girl I claim them that's right I claim my children do you pray that I claim my brother I claim my sister yes Satan you took them from God's house cooks them out there but I'm coming after them I claim them how do you know but I'm a heir of all things Oh Glory to God I am an heir of all things it's given to me I am an heir I can claim everything that God promised me it is mine how do you get it something you don't know sir it's the unmerited gift that God gave us it is ours it belongs to us and Satan cannot hold it if you go to him in the scriptural authoritative word number all right scriptural authoritative word with faith to say it is mine he said lay it down you say amen glory I like that Satan you laid down you took it from me you give it back because I am serving notice on you I've got the notice written here on the word Heaven Earth will pass away but there's nothing shall not I come with this notice of serve on you that Jesus Christ said whatsoever I ask a father in my name all these promises are rocking you know he will give it to me and I say to this mountain don't talk to my heart he shall come to pass I lay it down I come with script till about 30. I am a believer could you say that I am a believer Oh Glory to God there are certain things that have access to Believers unbelievers is a different thing but I am a believer Oh Glory lay it down I am a believer Oh Glory to God when a sinner here we go when a sinner can see you don't have to say a lot of people say they sin because they have to sin that's a pitiful ship when you can see you have to say but when you realize that you don't have to sin anymore there's people that stand up and curse and laugh in your face and call you an idiot they are willful Sinners there's no hope for them but that man who does something constantly they don't want to do it he steals he don't want to he lies he don't want to he does things he doesn't want to do he don't want to be a sinner There's Hope for him if you can let him see the truth come up to God's promise and lay your faith on that and walk out there to the enemy so God looks at somebody heart and intent sometimes and that's why the Bible talk about enough some have compassion making a difference between a weak believer and from a brute peace because some people don't care there are some people weak in the flesh and they'll be tempted by this and they're being moved by this and influenced by this and the Bible says and have some have compassion make a difference of these kind of people in the church or give the Lord some praises don't tell my wife there's some people only like talk here you want somebody that they could just talk talk talk they don't want to take word they don't want to take counsel they don't want to apply what's being spoken to them they're just like long talk the longer they talk the better The View foreign because you see you want to know that after you spoke to someone they could act upon what they're being told because that's the solution there it's not right no we are Heirs of all things we are Heirs of all things the Bible says we're ears of all things we don't possess it yet no no no don't miss it he's saying it very plain we don't possess it yet but it is ours come on it belongs to the people the Believers the bride of Christ own every Speck of it Russia fighting for it United States fighting for that this one fighting over here and they call us crazy and all is going to fall heir to it let them fuss and blow up one another we are the one that gets it [Applause] Give the Lord some praises glory to God so when you come to be prayed for if you want salvation if you want Divine Healing no matter if you are a Believer you are heir of every promise so lay your faith upon the promise and match towards it and give it back give it back it's mine don't let him Bluff you stand right down the line he will give it back he stayed on that foundation of the promised world and you know he was the heir watch I like this part he wasn't it the one Abraham right after the promise had been vitigated to him he had fellowship with the promiser I like that after God made the promise and see Abraham here we go back hungry had never had a test before of that kind he knowed it all belonged to him that was a promise but he never had to fight the army so you know Ariana says everything is his lot and everything else but he didn't shout out to tea if there's 30 if there's 25 he never fight before the same this this thing Rusty but I'm dramatized the four crossed the Cutlass Rusty there was no army people and yet Abraham going down fight Shield they're gonna fight what Abraham had never had a test of that kind so he knowed it all belonged to him that was a promise yet he never had to fight an army he didn't know nothing he wasn't trained man to fight Abraham wasn't a fighter he was a farmer Abraham could do nothing because he was not a soldier his man wasn't soldiers they were farmers so the only he could do was to take God's promise put his faith upon the promise and move out move out with what you got with your fork with your speed with your whole with whatever you have with a branch a statement you have Oh Glory to God where are you going you're going to fight I'm gonna bring back luck and guess what at the equal sign they brought back lord forget

Syndicate and give him his word and keep his word oh give the Lord of praises Hallelujah let's go we find out after the promise was Vindicated Abraham had fellowship with Melchizedek he come to bless

I'm on my March so praise God and now God take my sins and put it in the sea of his forgetfulness you marry remember but when God put it in his sea of forgetfulness not even God himself could remember it not even God himself could bring it back up that is why you could be justified as if you never did it only God could justify and then we read the Scripture it is God that justify it oh give the Lord a shout oh man I justifying you they want to find fault with you oh with a god foreign them all them laugh I wasn't laughing I was dead serious because it ought not to be that way if a brother foreign people be careful because you could be backslide also you have to restore with wisdom restored understanding restore with humility restore with the understanding that even was in the grace of God you also would fall so you are being held in God's hands by God's grace and any man could slip and slide and backslide but who's going to pick him up who's going to raise him up who's going to go after him there's got to be adoption there's got to be genuine adopted Sons you see adopted Sons is Christ Ministry in men going after Fallen Brothers many want to do that because they want to raise a flag that they're so right and they want to see by outing your light their light shine brighter there's a light they will tell them that that's an older person like this and God put a week straight on an oil and they believe so yeah the fuel any fire do you feel the Revival they're fuelingly anointed getting a greater Faith now that people shut them out of the critics let them criticize okay the Lord some Praises criticism be shocked Oh Glory to God hallelujah amen do you believe that all right hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh my oh my God praise be to Jesus so he's speaking just all day about two kind of knowledge and and this is something that I look at something called genesco maybe they're pronouncing the word right is g-i-n-o-s-q-o another word called oider o-i-d-e do a Greek words one of them this word genesco this word generally refers to knowledge again to personal experience or perception it implies that deeper experiential understanding of something or someone it conveys the idea of knowing through an intimate relationship or direct example for example Matthew 7 23 when Jesus said I will declare them I never knew you depart from me what he's also saying is not that he doesn't know them he doesn't know them in relationship they never had a relationship with him I never knew you depart from me you workers of iniquity okay I never knew you no order this word generally refers to knowledge that is intuitive or acquired through mental perception it signifies knowing something without necessarily having experienced it full sun it can imply a more intellectual or cognitive understanding for example in John 21 17 Jesus asked Peter three times do you love me and Peter receives response Lord you know he's saying Lord you know oider all things you know either that I loved you you hear no is translated from either indicating a knowledge that comes from Jesus divine understands God you know praise God it is important to note that these words are sometimes used in decisionably and something like that but I just want to bring it to you tonight that there's two knowing no both are important because you have to have the knowledge of the word which is God in print and you have to have a knowledge of God by knowing by relationship do you get that so so so knowledge of God so it both works together it's not that we're trying to hit intellect in that way but to show that the knowing that we expect that there's a Bible talk about uh uh you shall know as you are known all glory to God that's a deeper knowledge and the prophet call it perfect realization that's that's going to be unintellectual understanding that you getting in his own Oh Glory they've got to realize how God realizes the sense how God sends to feel how God feel to catch the intelligence or the mind of God oh glory to God hallelujah enter into the position not knowing just what God done but why he has done it Oh Glory to God has the intimacy of the relationship with God or give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah do you love him tonight oh do you get it now Oh Glory to God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord praise God praise God praise God so do I speak with tongues of men and angels First Corinthians 13. speakers have no charity and become a strong Embrace something December don't have the gift of Prophecy understand all Mysteries and all knowledge though I have all Faith so I can move mountains I'm not charity I am nothing so this is identify the knowledge could be so powerful knowing all Mysteries and still not connected to the source which is the charity the Capstone of divine love Hallelujah have all knowledge preaching to ministers preaching to churches have Mighty Ministries but not tapped into charity charity has not been expressed all glory Charities that mean men manifest Charities suffered law and is kind that not for amen does not provoke it buried all things believe in all things enjoyed all things charging never failing so when you squeeze charity oh God it must come out man love must come out virtue must come out oh glory to God hallelujah you squeezing look at my charity and knowledge coming out information coming out Mysteries coming out Revelations coming out but the love divine is not coming out okay the Lord some Praises who is Thy Neighbor [Applause] Oh Glory this one have this ministry and that one in the apostolic realm and this one in the prophetic realm and that one in the pastor Raymond everybody passing them straight an old publican pick up that man put them inside the hotel and so on and pay and see when I come back off if there's anything more and she said who is your neighbor who's the neighbor how much you ever listens there whole Revolution compared to the life how we're connecting to the voice is something to check the devil Oh Glory to God do I know all Mysteries have all knowledge have no charity so glory to God Chapel charity suffered long in His Kind when I was a child I speak like a child on a like a child I told her the child but when I became a man I put away childish things but now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part that's what knew in part but then shall I know even also I am known nor by that faith hope and charity these three the greatest theater charity oh my glory to God how almost done music on please Ephesians 4 we want to look at it and Amplified same 11 to 13. and his gifts were varied he give him himself appointed and give up men to us some to be Apostles special Messengers some prophets inspired preachers and exponents some evangelists preachers of the Gospel travel the missionaries some pastors Shepherds of the flock and teachers his intention was the perfecting and the full equipping of the Saints his consecrated people that they should do the work of ministering towards building up Christ's body the church I want to get to now that it might develop until we attain Oneness in faith and in comprehension of the full accurate knowledge of the Son of God that we might arrive purpose of that knowledge that we might arrive at really mature manhood the completeness of the personality which is nothing less that the standard height of Christ's own Perfection the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and the completions from him children that their sins are forgiven and we're showing how certain knowledge apply to certain stages of growth so you cannot put adoption to a child because the child portion is the appreciation of the Forgiveness of sins I write unto the young men because they are strong you overcome the wicked one so as you grow in God the knowledge unveils to that level of growth but the object is to get you I write you fathers that you know him from the beginning oh Gloria that's a deeper knowledge as you grow in God a deeper knowledge you know him from the beginning oh praise God let's see if you could wrap up here now oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God so faith is designed to see what God wills and wants there's no knowledge can do that faith alone is designed and give the human race to find out what the will of God is and you take your faith your God you don't focus with the word then leave it alone you got the wrong feet when your god-given faith Focus you with the word of God you are directly enlightened zeroed God help us in this hour faith is designed to see what God wants you to see through the camera of his word his promise this is the full revelation of Jesus Christ and when your faith that is in you focus you to this word you are focused away from all the Innovation and Creeds you are focused straight on the word of God you are zeroed in it all needs a little touch off and that prayer flies straight in the presence of God nothing can stop it glory to God his word is always the truth always the truth his belief in children belief for it and cry for it until his word is Vindicated you hear that they don't just want the word you know they want the word Vindicated and his word is always his will if you want to know what the will of God is find it in the Bible it is God's word any contrary that is perverted o praise God so you see now you're talking about the Pentecostal tongues and the next is the eyes prophetic Malachi for the next is the intelligence so after seeing Prophet next intelligence we have no intelligence of our own we have no sight of our own and so forth and he governs the body all the way through the intelligence which is the mind of Christ to know what to do with the word the thing that matters with the message today those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened you can pick up the message and let the sun dig all the greenness out of you making matured Christians see what I mean God is coming to receive his search and we must have that type of Christian for him to receive the wheat has to get ripe oh praise God Amen glory to God hallelujah do you get it now all right let's sit down here now coming into Christ is like coming into a big Variety Store we have joy we have peace we have long suffering we have even healing we are speaking in tongues we have interpreting of tongues we have prophecy we have everything it's a big Variety Store but one Spirit we are baptized into this big Variety Store isn't that right have everything and maybe something a little high for a rich God got a stepladder over here just get on it I like to look around to see what I

possession of Every redempted Blessing we're not born with this Revelation we're not born with this knowledge we're not born with this information this is what God has to come to us for us to know what we have to possess now when you look at this you want to know what are my Redemptive rights begin to make it clean by one Spirit we are baptized into this big arcade mine and there's a shelf justification by fate of goodness and the stepladder and so on but I want to get to something here we'll close Hallelujah okay yeah Let It Go we're gonna play something personal it's just like a big
