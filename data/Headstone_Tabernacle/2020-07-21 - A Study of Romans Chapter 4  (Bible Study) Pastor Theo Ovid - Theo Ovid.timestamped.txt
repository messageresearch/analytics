[6:32] been a sealed book
[6:33] for all these years and we know you told
[6:35] daniel the book will be unsealed in this
[6:37] last day father
[6:38] and seeing the vision and prophecy to us
[6:40] and if we conceal
[6:42] a word for us whatever word you have for
[6:44] us may you unseal it
[6:46] unveil it tonight that it will have such
[6:48] an effect upon our lives
[6:50] that will be changed granted lord in
[6:52] jesus might ask it
[6:53] amen god bless you and before i
[6:57] read the scriptures tonight i want to
[6:59] share
[7:00] a testimony that we got today and this
[7:03] is from south africa
[7:05] may god bless you pastor ovid we are
[7:07] messaging you all the way from south
[7:09] africa
[7:10] our hearts are blazing with fire and
[7:11] gratitude for the virtual convention
[7:14] you will never know how much each and
[7:17] every meeting
[7:18] meant to us uh
[7:21] it was and it still has given us power
[7:23] to keep pushing on
[7:24] the conventions timing was heaven sent
[7:27] my wife and i
[7:28] were diagnosed with covet 19 the tuesday
[7:32] before the convention
[7:33] we went through the darkest storm of our
[7:35] life the conventional meetings gave us
[7:37] so much needed faith
[7:39] to believe for our healing and during
[7:42] each service
[7:42] satan was fighting our bodies but we
[7:45] kept on
[7:46] pushing through the pain and sang
[7:49] and rejoice in the lord we are now
[7:51] recovering
[7:52] the convention was our lifeline i still
[7:54] believe that god spoke to us
[7:56] through every single service we pray
[7:58] that god blesses you and your support
[8:00] system richly and continue to lead you
[8:03] the foods of the kingdom of heaven god
[8:05] bless you richly
[8:06] and brother luke and sister sarah van
[8:07] greed uh they come from africa and they
[8:10] send a little testimony
[8:11] so we thank god for that that nothing
[8:14] that we do
[8:14] for the kingdom is in vain it has an
[8:17] effect
[8:18] on the bright body whatever that is
[8:21] so tonight i want to i want you to turn
[8:24] the bible so romans chapter four
[8:27] we want to take a scripture from the
[8:28] roman chapter four and we want to go
[8:30] into
[8:31] um a study of romans chapter four
[8:36] and i have a sort of on the line team
[8:38] launch out
[8:40] anything would have in his wood fighting
[8:41] for put
[8:44] your feet into action
[8:47] you know um it is one thing to believe
[8:51] and go to church and you know you have a
[8:54] testimony and so on like that
[8:56] with another thing really when you begin
[8:59] to put your
[9:00] feet in action and put your feet
[9:03] on the line and to me this is what god
[9:06] wants from
[9:08] so let's read from chapter one of verse
[9:10] one of chapter four
[9:12] romans chapter four what shall we say
[9:14] then that abraham or
[9:16] father as participants of the flesh had
[9:18] found or if abraham would justify by
[9:20] works
[9:21] he had way off to glory but not before
[9:23] god for what saith the scripture
[9:26] abraham believed god and it was counted
[9:29] unto him for righteousness
[9:30] out of him that worketh is a reward not
[9:32] reckon of grace but of death
[9:34] but to him that get not but believe it
[9:36] on him that justified then godly
[9:38] his fate is counted for righteousness
[9:42] even as david also described it the
[9:44] blessedness of the man
[9:46] unto whom god imputed righteousness
[9:48] without works saying blessed are they
[9:50] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[9:52] sins are covered
[9:54] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[9:56] not impute
[9:58] sin commit this blessedness then unto
[10:01] the circumcision only
[10:02] or upon the uncircumcision also for we
[10:05] say that
[10:06] faith was reckoned to abraham for
[10:07] righteousness or was it then reckon
[10:10] when he was in circumcision or in
[10:12] uncircumcision
[10:13] not in circumcision but in
[10:15] uncircumcision
[10:17] and he received a sign of circumcision a
[10:19] seal
[10:20] of the righteousness of defeat which he
[10:24] had
[10:24] yet been uncircumcised but that he might
[10:28] be the father of all them that believe
[10:30] do they be not circumcised that
[10:33] righteousness
[10:34] might be imputed unto them also let's
[10:37] bow our heads
[10:37] one more time i'm going to stop you for
[10:39] now we're going to continue
[10:41] after father i thank you for your word
[10:42] lord and as we read it
[10:44] you it our hearts and jesus might ask it
[10:47] email
[10:47] me holy bible in that spot there because
[10:50] we're gonna continue
[10:51] okay so um
[10:55] let's talk a little bit about
[10:56] justification because when
[10:58] somebody receive christ and accept the
[11:01] lord and walk in by faith
[11:02] and they are justified that gives a
[11:05] different title and give us a different
[11:07] position altogether
[11:08] in terms of accessing god remember
[11:12] when man fell he fell from number six
[11:14] his sixth sense of faith
[11:16] and he was just in these five senses
[11:18] fighting up there wasn't
[11:20] no real lying connection to god so the
[11:23] first thing that had to be restored
[11:25] was faith feet that sixth tenth is the
[11:28] first thing because
[11:30] the truth is that is the only
[11:33] tool or the only way we could connect to
[11:36] god
[11:37] is true faith it's not true or flesh
[11:40] it's not true or five senses
[11:41] it's not you know feelings and or
[11:43] emotions
[11:44] what relates to god or communicates to
[11:47] god
[11:48] is this thing called faith feat it's a
[11:51] sixth sense it's a powerful thing
[11:54] it's almost okay describing like an
[11:56] instinct something that you can't
[11:57] explain you just know
[11:59] you know like you know you want to
[12:00] succeed your exam you know you're going
[12:02] to pass this test
[12:03] you know you're going to get through
[12:04] here you can't explain it all the pieces
[12:06] not there together
[12:07] but there was something deep within you
[12:09] know and without knowing now
[12:11] you push yourself in areas you didn't
[12:14] think you was going to push yourself
[12:15] before
[12:15] because it's a sense of faith that is
[12:17] pushing there so god
[12:19] called abraham and god bless abraham
[12:22] and abraham believed god and his fate
[12:25] was counted for righteousness now i know
[12:29] and we all know what the lord uh what
[12:32] was taught to us
[12:33] concerning what james wrote okay so
[12:36] james
[12:38] uh james said it's a little different he
[12:39] said now even so fate
[12:41] if it had not works is dead being alone
[12:43] this is james 2 16.
[12:45] and he was talking here about if a
[12:47] brother is destitute
[12:48] or naked or destitute dairy and if one
[12:51] of you say
[12:52] the path in peace and be warm and be
[12:54] filled notwithstanding you
[12:56] give them those things which are needful
[12:58] for the body what are they profit
[13:00] become like using an excuse instead of
[13:03] doing
[13:03] what is practical or doing what could be
[13:06] applied
[13:06] you only talk and they talk and say be
[13:09] warm be fair
[13:10] go your way and so on like that so he
[13:13] said even so
[13:14] fate if it had not works is dead being
[13:16] alone
[13:17] ye a man may say thou has faith and i
[13:20] have works show me thy faith without my
[13:22] thy works
[13:23] and i will i will show thee my faith by
[13:25] my works don't believe us that there is
[13:28] one god
[13:28] don't do us well the devils also believe
[13:31] and tremble
[13:31] but will thou know ovine man that fate
[13:35] without works is dead was not abraham
[13:38] our father justified by works
[13:40] are we fine the scripture we read in
[13:42] romans 4
[13:43] he said he was justified by faith and
[13:46] james is saying here
[13:48] in verse 21 was not abraham our father
[13:51] justified by works
[13:52] when he had offered isaac his son upon
[13:55] the altar
[13:56] seeing dull how fate wrought with works
[13:59] and how
[14:00] by works was faith made perfect
[14:03] and brother branham he taught us and he
[14:06] shared with us
[14:07] that it wasn't a conflict of scriptures
[14:09] it was not disagreement
[14:11] it was works expresses the faith that we
[14:14] came to have
[14:16] so in other words you can't really have
[14:18] faith and there's no evidence
[14:19] there is no life witnessing evidence of
[14:23] the
[14:23] faith that you're claimed to have if you
[14:26] have fear where is defeat
[14:27] if you have fear you will talk your
[14:29] fears he will speak your fears
[14:31] if you have doubt she will talk your dog
[14:32] she will speak your doubts because
[14:34] faith have an operation that goes with
[14:36] it and this is what god wants from us
[14:39] abraham believed god he himself
[14:42] became the father of fate so let's read
[14:44] this part again verse 22
[14:46] of james two seeing dull how fate
[14:50] wrote with his works and by works
[14:54] was faith made perfect and the scripture
[14:56] was fulfilled which said abraham
[14:58] believed god
[15:00] and was imputed unto him for
[15:01] righteousness or he was called
[15:04] the friend of god you see then how that
[15:07] by works a man is justified and not by
[15:10] faith only
[15:11] likewise also was not rehabbed the
[15:13] harlot justified by works
[15:15] when she had received the messengers and
[15:17] had sent them out another way
[15:19] for as the body without their spirit is
[15:22] dead
[15:22] so fate without works is dead also
[15:26] so let's come back here now and verse 11
[15:29] of the scripture
[15:31] that we read and he received the sign
[15:34] of circumcision a seal of the
[15:37] righteousness of defeat
[15:39] which he had yet being uncircumcised
[15:42] so this faith that abraham had he didn't
[15:45] he was not circumcised yet
[15:48] but he believed god so this fate he had
[15:51] was before he got the confirmation of
[15:54] the fate which is circumcision
[15:56] this faith that he had was a fate that
[15:58] but inside of him
[15:59] a faith from god a fate of god a faith
[16:02] that abraham had written in
[16:04] so he said and he received the sign of
[16:06] circumcision a
[16:07] seal of the righteousness of defeat
[16:10] which he had yet been uncircumcised that
[16:13] he might be
[16:14] the father of all them that believe
[16:18] so that scripture here that this part
[16:20] here the father of all them that believe
[16:22] that is jew and gentile that's for us as
[16:25] all of us
[16:26] all them that believe though they be not
[16:29] circumcised
[16:30] that that righteousness might be imputed
[16:33] unto them
[16:33] also and the father of circumcision to
[16:36] them
[16:36] who are not of the circumcision only but
[16:39] who also walk
[16:40] in the steps of that fate of our father
[16:43] abraham
[16:43] which he had yet being uncircumcised
[16:46] let's continue for the promise that he
[16:49] should be the heir of the world
[16:51] was not to abram or to his seed through
[16:54] the law
[16:55] but through the righteousness of faith
[16:58] for if they which are of the lord be
[17:00] ears faith is made
[17:02] void and the promise made of non-effect
[17:06] so god is saying all these promises that
[17:09] have been
[17:10] pushed out is for those with
[17:13] that faith is not those of the law
[17:16] but it's those of the faith but the
[17:19] promise that he should be here of the
[17:20] world
[17:21] was not the abraham or to receive to the
[17:23] law but to the righteousness of faith
[17:25] but if they that of the law this is
[17:27] verse 14
[17:28] faith is made void he is faith is made
[17:30] void and the promise made of non-effect
[17:32] because the law will get right for where
[17:35] no law
[17:36] is there is no transgression therefore
[17:39] it is a
[17:39] faith that it might be by grace oh this
[17:43] is good
[17:43] this is good verse 16 therefore
[17:46] it is a fate that it might be by grace
[17:49] to the
[17:49] end the promise might be sure to all the
[17:52] seed
[17:53] not only to that which of the law but to
[17:55] that also which is of the fate of
[17:57] abraham
[17:58] who is the father of us or so friends
[18:02] tonight that fate is being conquered as
[18:04] righteousness
[18:05] just think about it and then you can
[18:07] understand why god sees us through the
[18:09] blood
[18:10] why god sees us as sons why we have
[18:13] access and while the enemy
[18:15] dies his job is to bring you those
[18:18] questions about your access to god your
[18:21] access to the blessings
[18:23] your access to inheritance let's
[18:25] continue as it is written
[18:26] i have made thee a father of many
[18:27] nations before him whom he believe
[18:30] even god who quickeneth
[18:33] the dead and call it those things which
[18:36] be not
[18:36] as though they were who against hope
[18:39] believe in hope
[18:40] that he might become the father of many
[18:41] nations according to that which was
[18:43] spoken so shall i see be
[18:45] and be not weak and fate he considered
[18:47] his own body now death
[18:49] when he was about 100 years old nearly
[18:51] at the business of serious womb
[18:53] he staggered not at the promise of god
[18:56] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[18:59] giving glory to god you could pause here
[19:02] on that verse 20
[19:03] wherever again he staggered not at the
[19:05] promise of god
[19:06] true unbelief but was strong in faith
[19:09] giving glory to
[19:10] god and being fully persuaded that what
[19:12] he promised
[19:14] he was able to perform and therefore it
[19:16] was imputed to him for righteousness
[19:18] now it is not written it was not written
[19:21] for his sake alone
[19:22] that it was imprisoned him but for us
[19:25] also to whom
[19:26] it shall be impuged if we believe on him
[19:29] that raised up jesus
[19:30] our lord from the dead who was delivered
[19:33] for offenses
[19:34] and was raised up again for our
[19:36] justification
[19:38] all right so this is the chapter
[19:41] romans chapter four we read the whole
[19:43] thing last verse
[19:45] who was delivered for our offenses and
[19:47] was raised up again
[19:49] for our justification and justification
[19:51] means as if you never sinned in the
[19:52] first place
[19:53] that's what justification means the
[19:55] blood speaking
[19:57] on your behalf all pray is gone so this
[20:00] is really great
[20:02] and god put election in abraham
[20:05] and god calls a man by election and that
[20:08] is why iban could be justified
[20:10] and and and his faith conquered as
[20:13] righteousness because of god's election
[20:16] hallelujah just think about that now
[20:19] because you are elected
[20:20] god could come and justify you not
[20:23] because of your feeling
[20:24] you did this you did that that has not
[20:26] do with it is because you are elected
[20:29] his blood come and atone for you and his
[20:32] resurrection
[20:33] the the tools to bring a justification
[20:36] for you as if you
[20:37] never said so that's supposed to give
[20:39] you that liberty
[20:40] that freedom to praise to worship the
[20:43] acknowledged god
[20:44] the love him and the civil with all your
[20:46] heart that is what that does that gives
[20:48] you a liberty
[20:49] and and that is just a beginning because
[20:51] we bible talk about the glorious
[20:53] liberty of the sons of god so he said i
[20:55] am so happy to know this one thing
[20:57] friend
[20:57] that christianity has no negative
[21:00] nothing to it oh this is
[21:02] there's nothing they can shout tonight
[21:04] christianity has nothing
[21:06] negative for it it is everything
[21:08] absolutely positive
[21:10] a man that becomes a child of god has a
[21:13] positive hold on calvary and calvary has
[21:16] a positive hold on him
[21:17] with the assurance by almighty god and
[21:20] ought
[21:20] to himself that he will raise him up in
[21:23] the last day and take him to glory
[21:25] oh this is wonderful tonight that that
[21:27] is positive
[21:28] it is very very positive especially in
[21:30] the times like this
[21:31] it is very very positive that jesus died
[21:34] to redeem us jesus died
[21:35] to justify us and our justification from
[21:38] by the faith
[21:39] hallelujah the faith is conquered for
[21:42] righteousness
[21:42] is that something tonight isn't that
[21:44] beautiful tonight that your faith in the
[21:46] promised world
[21:47] is counted as righteousness just think
[21:50] about that tonight
[21:51] not your feelings not your failures
[21:53] because you see
[21:54] abraham the bible said he staggered not
[21:57] at the promise of god
[21:58] through unbelief so abraham that what i
[22:01] want to talk about
[22:02] that being his commentary is commentary
[22:04] when god wants to make a commentary
[22:06] about abraham he'd never talk about his
[22:08] weakness he never talked about his lying
[22:10] he's never talked about his backsliding
[22:11] it never talked about that it talked
[22:13] about
[22:13] abraham this is signed by god
[22:16] this is written him this is this is not
[22:19] this is not
[22:20] this is not abraham writing his own
[22:21] story this is
[22:23] god wanting the story to be known
[22:26] like it he said abraham this is the
[22:28] commentary about ibrahim
[22:30] he said i want mine to be like that not
[22:32] your failures not your shortcomings not
[22:34] your sins
[22:35] not your mystery not your past no but
[22:38] abraham
[22:38] staggered not at the promise of god
[22:41] through unbelief what was strong in
[22:42] faith giving glory to god
[22:44] we we we believe these promises these
[22:46] these precious promises
[22:48] that the poor will suck the church
[22:49] there'll be a bright revival you'll be
[22:51] filled with the holy ghost you'll be
[22:52] delivered
[22:53] you'll be on fire for god you what on
[22:55] there the devil will be under your feet
[22:57] all these things you will possess the
[22:59] gates of the enemy all these are
[23:00] promises
[23:01] you are heir of heaven your healthy
[23:03] earth you are heir of peace you are air
[23:05] of joy you are all these things you're
[23:07] not an air frustration depression
[23:09] upset knowledgeable kind of things all
[23:11] these incomes are captured and throw
[23:12] your own balance
[23:13] you're not air of those things abraham
[23:15] was seeking a city whose machine
[23:17] builders god what a kind of man
[23:19] in other words that man is so liberated
[23:21] he's so free
[23:22] i am down because he's like a drifter
[23:25] he's seeking a city nothing can hold him
[23:26] down you pick up isaac you pick up a
[23:28] tent you pick up a desk but he's moving
[23:30] on he know there's got to be a place
[23:32] somewhere
[23:32] are you like that when you see this
[23:35] corona virus
[23:36] and this is serious people dying of
[23:38] virgin being attacked and
[23:40] virgin coming down where the people are
[23:41] dying it's just that we are grateful to
[23:44] god and it's humbling our hearts
[23:45] but that we don't have it to run into
[23:47] our country and we are grateful to vote
[23:49] for that
[23:50] uh we bless god for that because you see
[23:52] you think about it
[23:53] a lot of mighty men so-called mighty men
[23:56] and men who
[23:56] think they have all this great power and
[23:59] and men who
[24:00] make people up make people to believe
[24:02] that they have a lot of power
[24:04] a lot of stuff when these situations
[24:06] come they realize
[24:08] it's just like dust they're like just
[24:09] ordinary men they have no power to do
[24:11] nothing
[24:12] that is why we could call for power that
[24:14] is why it will take the fate
[24:16] a call for this power are we talking
[24:17] about not imagination
[24:19] not your emotion it will take a faith
[24:22] and that is why it goes in a profit in
[24:24] its last day to turn
[24:26] our hearts back to the faith of the
[24:29] fathers
[24:30] you cannot go in a rapture without faith
[24:32] you can't go rapture because you have a
[24:34] nice
[24:35] clue that much rapture on it you can't
[24:36] paint rapture on you and go in the
[24:38] rapture it's not working like that
[24:40] you have to have rapturing faith
[24:43] faith will be changed in a moment a
[24:45] twinkling of an eye
[24:47] this is it it's real it come like if
[24:50] you have to go away like sometimes i
[24:52] have to go away you have to get the
[24:53] yellow fifa inoculation you have to get
[24:54] this i get the alpha tablets
[24:56] alleviate tablets yellow fever
[24:58] inoculation you you have
[25:00] it when you get to the border they ask
[25:02] you for these things
[25:03] if you don't have it it's a problem you
[25:05] have to have these things
[25:06] but okay to go to the rapture you have
[25:09] to have these things
[25:10] it's not a matter that you're going to
[25:12] this church this are things you have to
[25:13] have
[25:14] if if you're driving the car and the
[25:16] licensing officer stop you or they
[25:18] probably stop you they say driver's
[25:19] permit please
[25:20] okay you'll forget it you're not
[25:23] supposed to forget it
[25:25] they will charge you you see you have to
[25:27] have
[25:28] these things you get greasy raptor
[25:30] express and they
[25:31] the ticket conductor say where is the
[25:33] feet you see well um
[25:35] um there's no arm the board that raptor
[25:38] expressed
[25:38] you have to have defeat and that is what
[25:41] bhararan came
[25:42] to bring us to we can't fall short of it
[25:46] we must have it we will have it
[25:49] it would have released for us to have it
[25:52] that is why we shared
[25:54] a sunday that the word out of his mouth
[25:56] cannot return for it
[25:57] he already prophesied a bride he already
[26:00] saw a bright seal
[26:02] he saw a bride with the power with the
[26:03] anointing he saw
[26:05] the unity of the fate there's a prophecy
[26:07] that is going to be
[26:08] a unity of defeat not a unity of
[26:11] churches
[26:12] not a unity of groups a unity of the
[26:14] faith
[26:15] so it all comes down to this fear that
[26:18] we're talking about
[26:19] now remember when israel came out
[26:22] all of them heard the prophet moses all
[26:24] of them heard the books and the tapes
[26:26] but it's very few had the faith
[26:30] the others didn't mix what they were
[26:32] hearing with that
[26:34] thief so what abraham had
[26:37] is still original what abraham had is
[26:40] still
[26:41] important because the promised seed
[26:43] wasn't seeds
[26:45] as badazar preached it was seed which is
[26:47] christ
[26:48] so abraham's royal seed was his fate
[26:51] seed
[26:52] wasn't nicer the real royal seed of
[26:55] abraham
[26:56] was defeat and that's why jesus come
[26:59] back
[27:00] and all those guys came part of the
[27:01] generation of jesus christ
[27:04] because he was the end game of this fate
[27:07] that ibrahimovic
[27:08] he was what was prophesied to deal with
[27:11] his supern's head
[27:13] bruce that's the prophecy
[27:16] he was was that promising that god
[27:18] promised isn't that right
[27:20] oh praise the name of the lord so
[27:22] abraham
[27:24] the longer it went
[27:27] 20 years 25 years and so on
[27:31] and years the more stronger abram got
[27:35] that is a paradox there's a paradox
[27:38] some of us started off when we were very
[27:40] young and our hair was jet black
[27:43] no we have too much brothers
[27:50] because time just runs so fast that the
[27:52] black one grey
[27:54] and the gray almost want to go white so
[27:56] so so so you think about it
[27:58] we have to be stronger now than where we
[28:00] first started
[28:01] to make it to the finish line you can't
[28:04] afford to pull back now
[28:05] you can't afford to give up and the
[28:07] photo let go now you have to continue
[28:10] pressing on but the longer it went the
[28:13] more of a miracle it was going to be
[28:16] oh my elongated work just think about it
[28:18] lock down
[28:19] and the church coming back out stronger
[28:22] they're coming out strong you have to
[28:23] come back
[28:25] just like we said sunday peter was going
[28:26] to lock them in the upper room but they
[28:28] come under that struggle
[28:29] you know what happened to them power
[28:31] struck me
[28:32] and power want to strike that bride he
[28:34] said this way is this the mystery
[28:36] of the thunders that would bring back a
[28:39] power to the church
[28:41] the mystery of it is the mystery
[28:44] fate is the mystery to pull along the
[28:46] power
[28:47] something will not break in we have to
[28:49] see it
[28:50] because he says when the bright get to
[28:52] know who she is
[28:53] that she can do the greater works
[28:58] and she could discern the two spirits
[29:00] and withstand the false spirit
[29:02] then she gonna be an invincible army so
[29:04] it comes down to what
[29:06] you have to be conscious of what you can
[29:09] do
[29:10] what defeat in your soul revealed to you
[29:12] that you can do
[29:14] oh praise the lord so but i made a
[29:16] tremendous statement about launching out
[29:19] and that is why i have that as an
[29:20] underlying team of laundry now
[29:23] there are people that i know have never
[29:25] i don't think they've ever launched
[29:28] launch out uh it reflects in all areas
[29:32] in business in work in
[29:35] what if you want to get a scholarship if
[29:37] you want to make progress in your life
[29:40] in all areas to get from where you
[29:43] are to where you want to be there are
[29:44] steps that has to be changed
[29:47] nobody gets success by chance it doesn't
[29:49] just happen
[29:50] success is not an accident achievement
[29:53] is never accidents
[29:54] somebody who at the top of the game is
[29:56] not an accident in sports
[29:58] a runner a bicycle person a boxer
[30:02] whoever it is they don't be at the top
[30:04] of the game
[30:05] by chance it's by work it's by
[30:09] labor it's by striving it's by believing
[30:12] it's by
[30:12] exercising themselves it's by taking a
[30:16] race after race after race or in
[30:17] criminal boxing
[30:18] uh match after match after match and
[30:20] conquering this one and that
[30:22] one and they they have harder trials
[30:24] it's like whether his body building is
[30:26] is more weights have to go up and so on
[30:28] like that so so
[30:29] nobody at the top of the craft or game
[30:32] or top of this uh business or whatever
[30:35] it is they achieve it by yes
[30:37] people work out like how uh the
[30:40] president in america says um
[30:41] devour man but just go you know i mean
[30:44] he's hoping he's burying his head in the
[30:45] sand
[30:46] just hoping it will just disappear and
[30:49] he don't want to listen to
[30:50] the instructions and the guidance as to
[30:52] how we could
[30:53] mitigate and how we could try to get it
[30:56] down and
[30:57] the curve and so on that is not his
[30:58] burden and concern
[31:00] so so we don't want to be like that
[31:02] you're hoping you're making the rapture
[31:04] you hope you're a christian you hope
[31:05] you're a believer
[31:07] you know you're open you come true no
[31:09] not the bible doesn't say abraham
[31:11] hoped abraham believed god and he
[31:14] he staggered not that he wasn't hoping
[31:16] you know he really had faith
[31:18] and this is where we are challenged
[31:20] tonight amidst your circumstance and i
[31:22] want you to put it
[31:24] real around you right now whether your
[31:26] husband cuckoo your wife cuckoo your
[31:27] children cuckoo
[31:28] whether the job cuckoo whether
[31:30] everything else nuts around
[31:32] you you have to see your situation
[31:35] what kind of faith you have to have in
[31:37] your situation
[31:38] every one of us is in a situation repeat
[31:41] that
[31:42] it's not that the pastor doesn't have a
[31:43] situation or the elder didn't know
[31:46] that everyone has to have a situation
[31:50] that faith could be effected let me
[31:53] repeat that again
[31:54] everybody has a situation right now
[31:58] it could be a goliath it could be a soul
[32:02] it could be a a whole body like abraham
[32:05] like whatever it is it could be cancer
[32:07] tumor sickness
[32:08] disease knee problem back problem foot
[32:11] problem white problem husband problem
[32:12] cheering problem job problem
[32:14] money problem emotional problem
[32:19] temper problem anger problem
[32:23] hostility problem whatever problem with
[32:26] the body reflection in mind
[32:27] in whatever loss problem whatever
[32:29] problem
[32:30] but amidst whatever challenges and
[32:33] situations
[32:34] you are called to have faith
[32:38] now when jesus was looking through
[32:41] this drama that was unfolding before he
[32:44] was crucified
[32:45] and he saw in the realm of the spirit
[32:48] the plotting
[32:49] of demonic activity and demons to
[32:51] destroy pete
[32:54] he gave peter a warning he said peter
[32:57] the devil won the safety like
[32:58] wheat but i prayed for you
[33:02] in the realm of the spirit the evil
[33:05] forces
[33:06] they will do every single thing that
[33:09] they have to
[33:10] do to destroy you
[33:13] to destroy you therefore
[33:17] every one of you here in this room is a
[33:19] target
[33:20] i want you to understand tonight i want
[33:22] to change your pictures tonight
[33:23] don't think you like a bystander you
[33:25] might get a little wound
[33:26] like a little attack the object is to
[33:29] destroy
[33:30] i want you to think this the devil don't
[33:33] know who's the bride
[33:36] we ourselves don't know who's the brand
[33:39] we claim to be bright by faith
[33:41] but what what we can't say with concrete
[33:44] this is bright this is brightest bride
[33:46] no no we can't really see that we
[33:48] believe by faith i mean i have to
[33:50] believe it by faith
[33:51] now the bride they are the one that will
[33:53] be missing
[33:55] because like isaac said but as a
[33:57] preaching are you talking about every
[33:58] time you never make a move the chord is
[34:00] coming crush it
[34:02] so when he thought he had everything
[34:03] locked down enoch slipped out
[34:06] and the devil cannot find enoch the
[34:08] realm and he mentioned that enoch
[34:10] vibrate out and go into he can't go
[34:13] there
[34:14] enoch was not found and god put enoch
[34:18] in the age of the pyramid as a sign for
[34:21] the bride in the last days
[34:22] that there's a pyramid bride that will
[34:24] not be found
[34:27] so the devil knows something about to
[34:29] make a move now when
[34:31] when the bride goes up satan becomes
[34:33] incarnate
[34:36] satan becomes flesh satan take up his
[34:39] throne
[34:40] in the purple that they have in rome
[34:43] that is when the devil becomes active
[34:46] the spirit of god that covers the earth
[34:48] now will be withdrawn
[34:51] before the bride leaves the bride will
[34:54] have this let me see if i could use the
[34:55] words this way
[34:56] harvest the spirit the spirit will be
[34:58] only in the bride
[35:00] and the bride will have the authority to
[35:02] give mercy and life
[35:05] the blood will be represented by the
[35:08] bride and the earth
[35:09] when the bride is taken out is as if the
[35:11] blood is taken out there is no more
[35:13] salvation
[35:14] it's judgment that is the reality
[35:18] god doing the final mopping up work
[35:22] we are not the bride in total
[35:26] the majority of the bride members are
[35:29] under the it
[35:30] right now we are the capstone bride
[35:34] that is why we have to have the
[35:36] abrahamic fate to prolong this cap
[35:40] somebody going to do it somebody going
[35:42] to connect to the headstone
[35:44] but abraham that by the banner the holy
[35:47] spirit told him
[35:48] right told him that as the bride
[35:52] nears the headstone she'll be in his
[35:55] very image and likeness
[35:56] yeah we should get jetta as you're
[35:57] nearing it because the spirit
[35:59] had come along from the headstone
[36:01] connecting to the spirit of the bride
[36:03] and as you're near the capstone
[36:06] power flowing glory flowing
[36:09] she kind of flowing the witness of the
[36:12] spirit flowing
[36:13] it has to be here because the people
[36:17] for the brighter preach of eternal loss
[36:19] there has to be a manifestation
[36:22] to declare who is the bride as a witness
[36:25] to preach to eternal loss
[36:26] it can't be all this talk we talking
[36:28] talking talking it cannot be that
[36:30] because the ark the accident for seven
[36:33] days
[36:34] rainfall
[36:37] noah sealed in rain is falling
[36:41] and the people cannot get in because god
[36:43] shut the door
[36:44] so the ark stood as a witness it's a
[36:47] horrible thing to think
[36:48] that people will be flying into the
[36:50] church someday seeing power
[36:53] seeing miracles seeing all kinds of
[36:55] things taking place
[36:56] and they cannot access it
[37:00] now is the time to access his grace
[37:03] and mercy by the revelation of jesus
[37:06] christ no but obama was saying this here
[37:09] and i want to get this here to you here
[37:11] he said i'd like to speak for a little
[37:12] while about launch out and that is what
[37:14] the trouble with the people's feet
[37:16] tonight you're afraid
[37:17] to turn it loose there is many of you
[37:21] got
[37:21] feet but you are free to let it loose
[37:24] now don't worry take it lightly you know
[37:26] what i'm seeing here tonight
[37:27] i think this is very very important
[37:31] very very important because if we could
[37:33] get this right
[37:35] this church has some time like will be
[37:37] one of the most
[37:38] powerful churches that ever existed if
[37:41] we could get this fit right
[37:43] let me see it again if we could get this
[37:45] right
[37:47] this church will be more than the most
[37:49] powerful churches
[37:50] existed because you are not limited by
[37:53] an elder by a pastor by the church
[37:55] itself
[37:56] you are you are you you have no
[37:58] limitations
[38:00] because you are dealing with what god
[38:02] has promised
[38:04] you don't have a pastor that kept in you
[38:06] you don't have the ministry or the
[38:07] teaching
[38:08] that limits you to anything we are
[38:11] saying
[38:12] abraham believe god and whatever god
[38:15] leads your soul to believe you can have
[38:17] it you can have your healing tonight
[38:20] you can have your deliverance complete
[38:22] tonight
[38:23] you can have a revival tonight you can
[38:25] have restoration tonight
[38:27] all the chains around your life could
[38:28] break off tonight not tomorrow
[38:30] tonight yes right no features
[38:34] the beauty about faith you don't have to
[38:35] push both feet
[38:37] no faith is so here we hear this
[38:41] if there's many of you god's fate but
[38:43] your friends didn't lose
[38:44] your faith with all works is dead
[38:48] just as your body without the spirit is
[38:50] dead
[38:51] and if you got faith show me your faith
[38:53] by your works you see
[38:54] paul was justifying abraham by faith
[38:58] jeans justified him by works and paul
[39:01] said abraham was justified romans 4 by
[39:03] fate
[39:04] and so james comes over and say that he
[39:06] was justified by works now both of them
[39:08] one confirmed the other now paul was
[39:12] speaking
[39:12] what god saw his fate james was speaking
[39:16] what man saw his works and if you say i
[39:18] got fit in god
[39:20] and afraid to put your faith to work
[39:22] then it won't do you no good
[39:24] you have got to launch out a wreck where
[39:27] you are see
[39:28] launch out say it again launch out
[39:33] one more time launch out say
[39:36] i have got to launch out make the whole
[39:39] statement i have got to launch
[39:41] out wherever you are whatever you're
[39:45] doing
[39:45] there is always something further ahead
[39:49] you have to launch out i have the
[39:51] launcher
[39:54] i have the launcher let's continue
[39:57] that's what the matter the people stay
[39:59] there in this world
[40:01] many of them has faith but they are free
[40:04] to launch out with it
[40:05] you're just afraid to venture a little
[40:08] bit just to see where i can
[40:10] i can do all things well i can i can do
[40:13] all things with christ who strengthens
[40:16] me
[40:16] look at him launch out into the deep and
[40:19] let down for the draw
[40:20] o praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[40:23] we'll give the lord some praises right
[40:24] now father we praise you
[40:26] father we bless you we thank you for
[40:27] your word we thank you for your presence
[40:29] lord
[40:29] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen
[40:32] so abram received the promise number one
[40:35] before he was circumcised
[40:37] god watch your ordinary man drop a
[40:39] promising look at us
[40:41] go call us all different walk on life
[40:43] and drop
[40:44] all kind of bright promises from us and
[40:46] before he could get
[40:47] and we were fortunate because we got
[40:49] locked in ulya croc
[40:50] to the channel of the bridal promises so
[40:54] therefore he wasn't into the topical
[40:56] preaching
[40:57] topical interests what i call filler
[40:59] material
[41:00] and sometime i talk about that brahm
[41:03] says when you see the message
[41:05] your rest is filler material you know
[41:07] like when you get a box a gift
[41:09] somebody don't hand you something and
[41:11] they look like a gift they put in a box
[41:12] to wrap it they put things around it
[41:14] people and whatnot when they get the
[41:16] gift you tickle the string here
[41:18] you unfold 40 bucks and you get a gift
[41:20] right you see when you see the message
[41:22] that you think inside the rest is what
[41:24] they call filler material
[41:26] like like like uh soup and seed whatever
[41:29] i will do with that
[41:31] nice information on what took place back
[41:32] there so we have knowledge of things
[41:34] that we don't know why this was done
[41:36] but if i come and tell a freak don't
[41:38] concede on the supernatural scene and
[41:39] it's up and i see doesn't receive
[41:40] that you're not going to get certainly
[41:41] raptured that's your knowledge and
[41:44] information
[41:44] and revelation saying what happened back
[41:46] here there's a lot of stuff like that
[41:48] pope israel los angeles other things i'm
[41:52] not doing it right
[41:54] has nothing to do with the bride being
[41:56] changed and transformed
[41:57] and what we want to get to is for the
[41:59] main thing to be the main thing
[42:01] that you do waste the time somebody tell
[42:03] me i don't waste your time i don't want
[42:04] to waste my time let's get down to the
[42:06] main thing and we talk the main thing we
[42:07] get done to the main thing that's
[42:08] because
[42:09] the main thing you have no they call
[42:11] long mobi
[42:13] you have some sugar you catch it long
[42:15] because you want to make it long we
[42:16] don't have to do all of that
[42:17] it comes at the point that will focus
[42:19] you get it tight and you hit bullseye
[42:21] that is what you want to get he said if
[42:23] i could get a man woman
[42:25] at their soul right the
[42:28] the most powerful get this thing because
[42:31] every person
[42:32] in that church becomes a powerhouse by
[42:34] divine revelation
[42:36] there's nobody trying to pump you nobody
[42:37] popping praise god wishing god
[42:40] no nobody's telling you no you calm your
[42:41] hands at me here you know atmosphere
[42:43] inside your
[42:44] house you fall down you break your foot
[42:45] whatever it is hallelujah glory glory
[42:47] glory because it's the brown thing
[42:48] you're talking about
[42:50] you're feeling pain of course you're
[42:52] feeling pain you're feeling pressure
[42:55] i'm not allowed abraham i i
[43:10] encourage your body to move
[43:14] and sometimes i tell already i said i
[43:16] didn't even really see me though
[43:18] you know i mean okay yeah holding your
[43:21] hand you're holding your foot
[43:22] trying to get your body on and moving
[43:25] but this is life
[43:27] but there's a faith that is real a fit
[43:29] to believe god
[43:30] so let's continue now abraham
[43:34] received the promise before he was
[43:37] circumcised
[43:38] he received the promise before he was
[43:40] circumcised and then he was given the
[43:42] circumcision
[43:43] as a seal of his obedience of faith
[43:47] and brown was saying you are not
[43:49] converted until you are changed
[43:52] when you think about that change
[43:55] change in spirit change in mind changing
[43:58] desires changing objective
[44:01] you know you come to the lord get
[44:02] baptized in jesus name there's no change
[44:03] really yet you
[44:04] what changed your status in god change
[44:07] because you know
[44:08] a redeemed person you know like a
[44:11] justified person you
[44:12] you like he you pick you up like a dirty
[44:15] glass you pick you up
[44:16] your status has changed you know when
[44:17] the hands of god you're dirty still
[44:20] in god's hands now you're once partying
[44:23] smoking drinking
[44:24] he picks you up that's a change that's a
[44:27] change immediate change he pick you up
[44:29] you say lord forgive my sins have mercy
[44:31] upon me this mercy come down to you
[44:33] mercy dripping at the cross your change
[44:35] your status change
[44:36] where you are and then you come and hear
[44:39] the word the word come a clean process
[44:41] like a washing machine
[44:42] look like he closed washington and you
[44:44] know you know just truly close the
[44:46] washing machine and pull it back out
[44:47] it's a wash
[44:48] it has to has to go through some time to
[44:50] choke on it
[44:51] and that that rocking motion lies the
[44:53] word the washing of the water by the
[44:55] wood and you're inside a deer
[44:57] like a tub spinning around inside of you
[44:59] okay and every day
[45:00] you go out you you get dirty you get
[45:04] different torch you get different things
[45:06] and now they come back and service
[45:08] they get they get all washed and
[45:09] different every services are
[45:11] washing urging cleaning not cleansing
[45:15] and then the object of that washing to
[45:18] prepare to fill you
[45:19] because god's objective is not for you
[45:22] to be
[45:22] a church member justified and sanctified
[45:26] and separated and you're not adaptation
[45:28] as a mathematician as a catholic that's
[45:29] not god objective what you're not
[45:31] what what objective is what you are to
[45:33] be so it's not a matter i
[45:34] am not i am not like that man i am not
[45:38] i don't do like them i i don't cut my
[45:40] hair i wear long dress
[45:44] you know it's not what you're not is
[45:47] what you're supposed to be
[45:48] so so that's why he said redemption is
[45:50] in two parts coming out of and going
[45:52] into it's not what you come out of
[45:53] you can what about this but have we gone
[45:55] in
[45:56] so it's more than coming up it's glowing
[45:59] halloween hello
[46:00] food hero i escape fail that's exciting
[46:04] but then escaping pharaoh is not the
[46:06] goal the goal is to hit the promised
[46:09] land
[46:10] because that is yours wilderness is not
[46:12] yours escaping pharaoh you're still
[46:14] journeying to the promised land
[46:16] so therefore the experiences and the
[46:18] liberty and the joy of escaping
[46:20] hallelujah you can sing specials for 40
[46:22] 40 days
[46:23] 40 nights you're singing specials
[46:25] everybody can sing a spectrum and write
[46:26] this
[46:27] a new song too but that is not the
[46:29] promised land that is just
[46:31] inspiration in the wilderness
[46:34] you see but then when come to jordan now
[46:38] because you see when you come to jordan
[46:40] you are hearing a revelation of
[46:43] kitten kepler's ammo right and
[46:46] all the heights so now you know now this
[46:48] is not pharaoh again now this is not
[46:50] fair you're behind your back now
[46:52] this is what are you going to do
[46:57] because every place you put your foot is
[46:59] yours
[47:01] tonight there is nobody hindering you
[47:05] tonight you are your own hindrance
[47:10] i can tell you tonight as your pastor
[47:13] there's no church hillary in us
[47:15] there's no church affecting me there's
[47:18] nobody having
[47:19] rent free space in my head i had to take
[47:21] on this pastor or this church
[47:22] nobody bothers me me bothers me
[47:27] because i know if i could get rid of
[47:29] this guy called to you if i could
[47:30] push him out of the way man forget it
[47:34] i will launch the moon make a spin
[47:36] around when i come back
[47:38] let's just tell you just break out with
[47:41] but
[47:41] unlimited you know when you see people
[47:43] do it in natural you see people doing a
[47:45] business
[47:45] they watch an idea they built an idea
[47:48] they see it grow
[47:49] they see the expand they see it explode
[47:53] and you said wow i remember
[47:57] when the guys had created skype
[48:00] and you hear how you could talk over the
[48:02] internet and they started that
[48:04] and then they send skype for two billion
[48:06] dollars and i think microsoft had bought
[48:08] it and then
[48:09] afterwards that's the effect all them
[48:11] telecommunication thing
[48:12] that they run all the wire against them
[48:14] pull and then they call overseas
[48:17] and then they get what's up and they're
[48:18] talking every part of the world and you
[48:20] watch how
[48:20] technology make a lot of and a lot of
[48:24] stuff
[48:25] transform immediately
[48:28] like you ever studied the person who
[48:29] made a calculator
[48:31] or even it was right what going on if
[48:33] that was zona yeah
[48:34] you you know anybody has backed up right
[48:36] now
[48:38] the phone doing the calculator the the
[48:41] phone have of lightness you know
[48:43] things have changed even with this kona
[48:46] virus
[48:47] the operation of churches have changed
[48:50] have you changed are you changing
[48:54] are you adjusting i'm not talking about
[48:57] being here in this meeting now
[48:59] there's just part because see you being
[49:02] here just like if you're in church
[49:05] but change means your spirit your mind
[49:08] your thinking that has to change
[49:12] they came out to egypt but egypt didn't
[49:13] come with them could somebody say amen
[49:17] could somebody come up say amen they
[49:20] came
[49:20] out but what was in them didn't come out
[49:24] so when they came up to the promised
[49:25] land which was the line to say glory
[49:28] hallelujah let's take it
[49:32] i don't need joshua and caleb cross
[49:35] because
[49:36] the other different spirit the the word
[49:38] that they heard was mixed with faith
[49:40] don't let this word not be mixed with
[49:43] feet tonight
[49:46] wow so convert means
[49:49] to change and jesus
[49:52] told peter and after you are converted
[49:56] strengthen the battery so he was
[49:59] specifically telling peter
[50:02] you have a change
[50:05] to go through and when you receive this
[50:08] change
[50:10] you could become effective to help your
[50:12] fellow brethren
[50:14] but that change is coming this is peter
[50:18] who passed all devils this is peter who
[50:21] was working along with jesus jesus peter
[50:23] was anointed and preaching and
[50:24] everything else
[50:25] jesus said they want to sit here as we i
[50:27] know you're going to come true
[50:29] um so jesus by vision but i've seen
[50:32] peter deny him
[50:33] that's why jesus could tell him you'll
[50:34] not be treated peter don't
[50:36] maybe at that time believe that but
[50:38] jesus saw it
[50:40] but after you are converted straight to
[50:42] the breach i know what you're gonna do
[50:45] i know where you're gonna fall i know
[50:48] where you're gonna fail
[50:49] but i could also say you will come true
[50:54] could we give the lord a shout on that
[50:55] one because i believe that you will come
[50:58] true
[50:59] so your struggles and your challenges
[51:03] doesn't disturb god because what he
[51:06] knows is what's inside
[51:08] of you and the faster you come to the
[51:11] realization
[51:13] of who you are it makes things a bit
[51:16] easier because
[51:17] moses got messed up when he fled egypt
[51:20] he taught
[51:21] nice that his ministry is over he had to
[51:23] chill and
[51:24] relax himself and whatnot he thought but
[51:27] but what was in him
[51:28] he couldn't change god put that inside
[51:30] of him
[51:31] god equipped him for the job so even
[51:33] though he was out of sync
[51:35] with his purpose because god equipped
[51:38] him for the job
[51:38] that's the only man got to pick up with
[51:40] so when the time come
[51:42] what reached out and said time up now i
[51:44] want to pick up moses
[51:46] activate him by the spirit the dynamics
[51:50] activated by pillar of fire set among
[51:52] the egypt as an activated sun
[51:55] before he was a son but not an activated
[51:57] son
[51:58] he was a son but not a spirit endued
[52:01] powered son
[52:02] he was a son but he wasn't inspired the
[52:05] way god wanted it before his intellect
[52:08] was inspired
[52:10] but not the heart when moses was
[52:14] activated
[52:14] he was a direct channel of god
[52:17] and with a direct channel dear is my
[52:20] spirit flowing freely
[52:21] the devil and iranian because you cannot
[52:25] defeat a man
[52:26] in his position in his jurisdiction
[52:33] because the earth is over jurisdiction
[52:35] that is why adam had the
[52:37] dominion like exactly and the devil
[52:39] couldn't bother with that
[52:41] because he was in adam domain the only
[52:44] reason the earth is under satan control
[52:46] the prince of the power of the air
[52:48] is because adam lost it he lost the
[52:52] inheritance
[52:53] so the devil assumed squatter power
[52:55] because adam had none after that
[52:57] and his quarter power gave him the right
[52:59] to reign and rule on the ut
[53:01] until fire come and fire were burned as
[53:03] an exception together
[53:05] to clean up all the heavens to clean up
[53:08] all the demons activity
[53:11] hallelujah and fire come to us to clean
[53:13] us up too
[53:14] look what we baptise my fire to change
[53:16] this mortal and put it into immortality
[53:18] so i hope you're enjoying and what we're
[53:20] sharing tonight
[53:22] but this conversion after a converted
[53:24] strength the brethren says he was
[53:26] sanctified
[53:28] and but he said you think he put that
[53:31] spirit in a vessel that wasn't fit
[53:33] he went out cast all devils come back
[53:35] shouting they returned shouting and
[53:37] praising god
[53:38] i said the devil subjected us he said do
[53:40] rejoice they rejected the name in heaven
[53:42] and he said but when i come to pentecost
[53:44] judas was there shouting too and
[53:46] rejoicing
[53:46] he said when it comes to pentecost to
[53:48] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[53:50] today people don't want to talk about
[53:51] pentecost they don't want to talk what
[53:53] baptise
[53:55] they don't want to talk about these
[53:56] things power and different things uh
[53:58] somebody called me a power preacher
[53:59] you know anytime you get you or a child
[54:03] when it comes to pentecost to receive
[54:04] the batman when he goes they refused it
[54:06] and betrayed jesus that was the
[54:08] antichrist
[54:09] and that spirit will come right down and
[54:11] teach justification by faith and
[54:13] everything else
[54:14] and move right on down to the baptism
[54:16] holy ghost and then it will show its
[54:18] color
[54:19] so you see you don't want to claim
[54:21] something you don't really have
[54:23] you don't want to think you have the oil
[54:25] you don't even have the oil and you're
[54:27] including you have the extra oil when
[54:28] you look now
[54:29] anybody will come it looks recognized
[54:31] the tank you have is really empty
[54:34] you know people have sometimes people
[54:35] have two tons of gas in the house
[54:38] and when one gas run out they have every
[54:41] chance in the world to replace that they
[54:42] replace them
[54:44] and when these second gas tank run out
[54:46] they recognize they have two tanks to
[54:48] replace them
[54:49] so now when you go to get it replaced
[54:51] also we expect to have the all finished
[54:54] advice of looking for gas in a desperate
[54:56] way all you got to do is when one tank
[54:58] finish
[54:59] and replace it you always have backups
[55:03] you keep the peace in your head and
[55:04] peace in your mind but you see is that
[55:06] discipline to do that
[55:08] anyhow there's a next show by itself but
[55:10] listen
[55:11] let's continue every promise is true to
[55:13] the belief that god will take out his
[55:16] word
[55:16] take god's word and call those things
[55:18] like abraham the bible said
[55:20] abraham called those things which are
[55:22] not as though they were he's tagged not
[55:24] at the promise of god true and belief
[55:25] he never considered his own body his own
[55:28] body now dead but he was persuaded
[55:30] what about you tonight who call yourself
[55:32] abraham's season are ears of the same
[55:34] promise
[55:34] if you have faith that abraham had if
[55:36] you are abraham's seed
[55:38] then you've got the same fate or you
[55:40] couldn't be abraham's seed
[55:42] okay if you have your bibles just turn
[55:43] to galatians 3. let's look at this
[55:44] scripture
[55:45] reading from 16 gallatian 3 16.
[55:51] and we want to read galatians 3 16 and
[55:54] then go down to verse 23
[55:56] and it reads now to abram and his seed
[55:58] were the promise made
[56:00] he said not and deceits as of many but
[56:03] as of one
[56:04] so paul in galatians was making it
[56:07] crystal clear of what this seed was
[56:11] about
[56:11] so let's read it again verse 16. go to
[56:13] abraham and his seed were the promises
[56:16] made he see it not
[56:17] unto seeds as of many but as of one
[56:21] and the thy seed which is christ let's
[56:24] go to verse 23
[56:26] but before faith came we were kept
[56:29] under the law shut up unto the fate
[56:31] which should afterwards
[56:33] be revealed wherefore
[56:37] the law was our school master
[56:40] to bring us into christ that we might be
[56:43] justified by faith and after that faith
[56:47] is
[56:47] come we are no longer under a school
[56:51] master
[56:52] for year all the children of god by
[56:54] faith in christ jesus
[56:56] here we go for as many of you
[57:00] has been baptized into christ
[57:03] have put on christ there is neither jew
[57:06] nor greek
[57:07] there is neither born or free there is
[57:10] neither
[57:11] male nor female for you're all
[57:14] one in christ jesus and
[57:18] if you are christ then you are
[57:21] abraham's seed and this is the part here
[57:24] our ears according to the promise
[57:27] give the lord a shout on that oh give
[57:29] the lord hallelujah on that
[57:31] you are abraham's seed and
[57:34] is apparently promised and let's turn
[57:36] over
[57:37] to romans nine we want to read from
[57:39] seven to thirteen
[57:40] i'll be along with you again romans nine
[57:43] uh seven to thirteen
[57:46] find it praise the lord romans nine
[57:49] seven three thirteen
[57:50] and reads verse seven romans nine
[57:52] neither because they are
[57:54] the seed of abraham are the old children
[57:57] but in isaac shall i see it be called
[58:00] that
[58:01] is the which are the children of the
[58:04] flesh
[58:06] these are not the children of god
[58:09] but the children of the promised
[58:11] accounted for the seed oh hallelujah
[58:14] oh glory to god the church of what the
[58:16] children
[58:17] of the promised accounted for the seed
[58:20] but this is the word of promise at this
[58:23] time will i come
[58:24] and say i shall have a son not only this
[58:27] rebecca had conceived by one even by
[58:30] father isaac for the children not being
[58:32] yet born
[58:33] neither haven't done good or evil that
[58:35] the purpose of god
[58:36] according to election might stand none
[58:39] of works
[58:40] but of him that call it it's said unto
[58:42] her the elder
[58:43] shall save the younger as it is written
[58:46] jacob have i love
[58:48] but esau have i hidden
[58:52] so god gave a word and that word cannot
[58:55] return void
[58:57] the elder shall save the younger
[59:00] because god knew that seed was in jacob
[59:04] the same way god know that caesar's an
[59:06] eu
[59:07] and the flesh and the scardogary and the
[59:10] tricks around jacob
[59:13] didn't stop deceive in jacob from
[59:16] becoming manifest
[59:18] and jacob burdened what was his burden
[59:22] to get the boot right which was the holy
[59:25] ghost
[59:26] oh give the lord some praises on that
[59:28] hallelujah
[59:29] jacob burden was considering the spirit
[59:34] jacob burden was concerned the bit right
[59:38] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[59:44] he says now galatians 3 29 if he be in
[59:47] christ then i.e abraham's seed and is
[59:49] according to promise upon romans 4 16 we
[59:51] find that god has given us a short
[59:54] promise to all
[59:55] abraham seed and paul puts himself
[59:58] an all believers under that designation
[1:00:01] because he says
[1:00:02] abraham who is the father of us all
[1:00:06] then he goes on not only to narrow his
[1:00:08] definition
[1:00:09] but rather to finalize it in galatian
[1:00:11] street which we just read
[1:00:13] he as the churn of promise and promise
[1:00:16] as having to do with election or the
[1:00:19] truth of god
[1:00:21] so think about it now you are a child of
[1:00:24] promise
[1:00:25] and because your child a promise god
[1:00:27] call you out
[1:00:28] and push elijah message unto you
[1:00:33] you were ordained to receive it you
[1:00:36] couldn't miss it for
[1:00:37] nothing now this message it has to
[1:00:40] become
[1:00:41] flesh in you and i that you become the
[1:00:43] living word hope you see is him
[1:00:46] this is not a message just to be
[1:00:47] discussed and shared and talked
[1:00:49] what the reality is this bride will
[1:00:52] become
[1:00:52] the manifested reality of godly this
[1:00:56] bride will become god's hand of
[1:00:58] vengeance in the earth
[1:01:00] this bride will become voice god's voice
[1:01:03] or eyes on the earth
[1:01:04] let me just finish off here now then he
[1:01:07] goes on to say
[1:01:08] not only narrowed on this definition but
[1:01:10] rather to finalize it in galatians 3 he
[1:01:13] identified his seed
[1:01:14] single with jesus and counted the seed
[1:01:17] children as children of promise
[1:01:20] and promised as having to do with
[1:01:22] election or the chosen of god
[1:01:25] that is exactly what we have been saying
[1:01:27] these who are the royal seed
[1:01:29] are the elect of god are the
[1:01:31] predestinated
[1:01:33] for known of god we're in the mind of
[1:01:35] god and in his
[1:01:37] in very plain language the true bride of
[1:01:40] christ
[1:01:41] was in the mind of god eternally though
[1:01:43] not expressed
[1:01:44] until each came forth in the designated
[1:01:46] decree season
[1:01:48] as each member came forth and become
[1:01:50] expressed and took his place in the body
[1:01:52] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[1:01:55] word seed bright
[1:01:56] and though she is feminine in
[1:01:58] designation she is also called the body
[1:02:00] of christ
[1:02:01] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[1:02:04] called that
[1:02:05] for she was predecimated in him came
[1:02:08] from the same source
[1:02:09] was eternal with him and is now
[1:02:11] manifesting god
[1:02:12] in a many-membered body whereas once god
[1:02:16] is manifested in one member in our lord
[1:02:18] jesus christ
[1:02:19] so now then here we come to our
[1:02:22] conclusion
[1:02:23] as the eternal logos to god was
[1:02:26] manifested in the sun
[1:02:28] and in jesus blood all the god fullness
[1:02:30] of the goded bodily
[1:02:32] and the eternal one was the father
[1:02:34] manifested in flesh
[1:02:35] and therefore again the title of son
[1:02:37] loved that even so
[1:02:39] we eternal on his torch and our turn
[1:02:43] became the many members spoken seed
[1:02:46] manifest in the flesh and those eternal
[1:02:49] thoughts now manifest in flesh
[1:02:51] are the sons of god even as we are so
[1:02:54] called
[1:02:55] there we go we did not become seed by
[1:02:58] the reboot
[1:02:59] we were seed therefore were reborn
[1:03:03] for only the elect can be reborn in this
[1:03:07] this is not a shout out understand this
[1:03:11] abraham had faith before he was
[1:03:13] circumcised
[1:03:14] the circumcision was a confirmation of
[1:03:16] the faith that he
[1:03:17] had so the elect the elect was in god's
[1:03:21] stinking
[1:03:22] they rebirth don't make them seed
[1:03:24] because they are seed
[1:03:26] they can't be reborn because we were
[1:03:29] seed
[1:03:29] is the reason we could be quickened in
[1:03:32] non-seed
[1:03:33] there is nothing to quit let me wrap up
[1:03:36] here
[1:03:36] we're going to close when god make a
[1:03:40] promise
[1:03:41] he is duty-bound to take care of that
[1:03:43] promise so god can't say
[1:03:45] the bride hasn't had a revival yet it
[1:03:47] will take them seven thunders he will
[1:03:48] suddenly promise him
[1:03:49] he can't take care of it you have to
[1:03:50] take care of it when god say
[1:03:53] when the poor of this church rises it
[1:03:54] will bring the budget he is beautiful to
[1:03:56] take care of
[1:03:58] if then god said if you stay with the
[1:03:59] gospel stay right one of these days god
[1:04:01] will pull you aside
[1:04:02] and give you something to shake the
[1:04:04] world with and show that glory
[1:04:06] he could take care he is god
[1:04:10] abraham never received the promise when
[1:04:13] he was circumcised
[1:04:14] to show that circumcision was just a
[1:04:16] type he received the promise
[1:04:18] before he was circumcised so therefore
[1:04:22] you have to see receive the word seed
[1:04:24] because
[1:04:25] before you become a manifested seed you
[1:04:27] have to receive father
[1:04:28] they receive your word thy word before
[1:04:30] they went in the upper room
[1:04:32] to be manifested seed sons they had once
[1:04:34] you receive your word from christ
[1:04:36] and you open your understanding you open
[1:04:38] your wood to them god came down to open
[1:04:40] these seals
[1:04:41] okay to bring the seed because any time
[1:04:44] you get son of man you have to look for
[1:04:46] your soul
[1:04:46] son of man is his soul and that may have
[1:04:49] son of man
[1:04:50] solomon will be revealed he brings seed
[1:04:52] so you're not looking for a son of god
[1:04:53] yet
[1:04:54] you're looking for son of man son of
[1:04:55] mine bringing seed after son of man
[1:04:57] you're seeing son of god
[1:04:59] so son of man was christ and then
[1:05:02] his son of god came back in the upper
[1:05:03] room so after son of man ministry
[1:05:05] is son of god ministry so god sent back
[1:05:08] a son
[1:05:08] again in the person of a son he sends
[1:05:12] solomon ministry which is
[1:05:13] seed ministry so that's why they have
[1:05:15] four marine lottery
[1:05:17] but it have to have the rain for the
[1:05:18] seas you can't tell me you have all
[1:05:20] these precious seeds and there's no rain
[1:05:22] for it
[1:05:22] you need the rain for the seeds you need
[1:05:25] the harvest rain to produce the crop
[1:05:28] so therefore all these years we hold in
[1:05:30] this seed you see you held that seed
[1:05:32] long enough sarah you're waiting for
[1:05:34] lottery the manifestation
[1:05:36] oh praise the lord hallelujah
[1:05:39] grieve not the holy spirit whereby you
[1:05:41] are stealing to their redemption
[1:05:44] he said no that is what the holy ghost
[1:05:45] is it's the seal of god
[1:05:47] he formed you found grace in his sight
[1:05:48] he loves you he believes you
[1:05:50] he put his seals upon you and what i see
[1:05:53] designates a finished work
[1:05:54] what is the holy ghost a sign notice
[1:05:56] that the holy ghost is a sign
[1:05:58] the holy ghost is a seal he says now and
[1:06:00] to reject it is to be cut off under
[1:06:02] people
[1:06:03] who receive it is to have finished with
[1:06:04] the world all the things of the world
[1:06:07] he said no we say i went on a railroad
[1:06:09] here and they would roll up a car
[1:06:11] when a car is loaded they go to the car
[1:06:13] the inspector
[1:06:14] if you find anything loose it will fall
[1:06:16] and break
[1:06:17] anything will be destroyed so you'll not
[1:06:19] see the car until the car is so
[1:06:20] completely packed
[1:06:22] until it's so packed and so in order
[1:06:24] that the shaking of the ride
[1:06:26] won't bother the product that's on the
[1:06:28] inside what if it is all these years god
[1:06:30] just back in that world on us
[1:06:32] and when the shaking time comes to our
[1:06:33] destination that everything is fine
[1:06:36] with us that if it's not packed right
[1:06:38] then go shake off and fall off
[1:06:39] so god making sure word on top of wood
[1:06:41] on top of wood everything is packed
[1:06:43] he said that's what the matter we don't
[1:06:44] get sealed so much we are too
[1:06:46] loose about things when the inspector
[1:06:48] comes through they inspect your life
[1:06:51] if you are not little loose about things
[1:06:53] little loose about your prayer life
[1:06:55] wow that's a big one a little loose
[1:06:57] about
[1:06:59] your prayer life little loose about that
[1:07:01] temper
[1:07:02] little loose about that tongue to talk
[1:07:04] about others he will never
[1:07:06] seal the car some duty habits some vile
[1:07:09] things
[1:07:10] some vulgarity of mine can't seal
[1:07:13] the car but when he found everything in
[1:07:15] his place the inspector when he seals it
[1:07:17] dare anybody to open that seal until
[1:07:20] that car reaches destination
[1:07:22] that is what the holy spirit is it's
[1:07:24] your assurance it's your protections
[1:07:26] it's your witness it's your seal it's
[1:07:28] your sign
[1:07:29] i'm heaven bond don't care what the
[1:07:30] devil says i'm heaven born
[1:07:32] you seal me i am glory oh the spirit of
[1:07:35] god the holy ghost what is all egos it's
[1:07:37] the spirit of christ
[1:07:38] in you oh my i'm finished
[1:07:43] so may it be that when god writes your
[1:07:46] commentary
[1:07:47] that he could say you wouldn't talk
[1:07:49] about your feelings you showed comments
[1:07:51] your mistakes
[1:07:52] your sins but he could say like he made
[1:07:54] a comment with abram
[1:07:55] staggered not at the promise of god
[1:07:57] through unbelief but was strong and
[1:07:59] faith giving glory to god i trust
[1:08:01] tonight
[1:08:01] that this would have helped you and this
[1:08:04] would strengthen you
[1:08:05] that you would launch your feet out and
[1:08:08] you could see
[1:08:09] by how we operate and the convention
[1:08:12] that just
[1:08:13] passed is evidence of that that you know
[1:08:16] when a seed break inside your soul on
[1:08:18] your heart and you could
[1:08:19] conceive something you could step out
[1:08:21] and get it done
[1:08:22] get it accomplished and uh this is our
[1:08:26] life
[1:08:27] this is our testimony a life of faith

[1:09:00] and recognize that you have called them
[1:09:02] you have elected them you have chosen
[1:09:03] them

[1:09:35] out after the father
[1:09:36] and paul talk about pressing towards the
[1:09:39] mark of the high calling father me
[1:09:41] the believers realize if they don't
[1:09:43] press

[1:09:47] they'll be like stagnant waters they'll
[1:09:49] be failing and floundering lord they
[1:09:50] have to press
[1:09:51] in order to go to higher grounds lord
[1:09:54] this world

[1:10:01] something together
[1:10:03] something to offer every day some job is
[1:10:06] being
[1:10:06] made redundant every day some businesses

[1:10:10] has arrived
[1:10:11] this is what is all about lord father we
[1:10:14] come into a great climax oh lord
[1:10:16] where it will take rapture and feet and
[1:10:19] and the extra oil to break through

[1:10:39] around this bible study may be a
[1:10:41] strengthened for them and encouragement
[1:10:43] for them like abraham
[1:10:44] a man like passion a man with feelings
[1:10:46] and shortcomings just like us
[1:10:48] he could believe god and his fate and
[1:10:50] his faith could be counted as
[1:10:51] righteousness but
[1:10:53] expressed by that fate we saw his works
[1:10:55] we saw his life he saw his
[1:10:57] his villain uh a booty and creating
[1:11:00] booty and billing crib and
[1:11:02] open up isaac all that was expressing
[1:11:04] the faith he had because he believed
[1:11:06] that even if isaac died you could raise
[1:11:08] him from the dead
[1:11:09] and that was the level of fear that
[1:11:11] abraham had and father

[1:12:10] out of the convention and this time of
[1:12:12] life to see
[1:12:14] lord how we could still glean
[1:12:16] inspiration from
[1:12:17] abraham's testimony and how he lived and
[1:12:20] what he endured and
[1:12:22] through his own lord experience of
[1:12:26] staggering not
[1:12:28] uh at the promise he held on to a
[1:12:30] promise and
[1:12:31] the promise sustained him the promise
[1:12:33] kept him in his down days in his dark
[1:12:36] days
[1:12:37] it would not have been a bed of roses
[1:12:40] he would have endured what any man would
[1:12:42] endure but he staggered not at the
[1:12:44] promise so we
[1:12:45] thank you for the precious promises that
[1:12:48] your word has brought to us and
[1:12:50] law that tonight we could separate
[1:12:52] ourselves from the hustle and bustle of

[1:12:58] agreement come to a unity
