eternity God when the breaker zone Alton is king called time and bring us into eternity Oh My isn't it wonderful we want to welcome each and every one of you here to our harvest convention 2019 and this was one of the things that we put out from secondhand room where rom says and God has never left himself on earth without a witness but as always somewhere someplace had a person he could put his hands on that would stand for witness so he has did that don't you Genesis the beginning surely God has a man that he can lays on no for he he has more than one man that he can lay his hands on because we are coming down to the gathering time the harvest time so it's not one man he has more men that he could lay his hands on and over these few days you're gonna see some men that God has placed his hands on because it's harvest time we don't need less men we need more men because the harvest is right but the lever is a few so we tango for these liberals liberals in God's opinion oh praise the name of the Lord so I just want to welcome praise God from South Africa by Raymond Thompson but every month tops leakages but ideally from Nigeria but after to be his family there from Nigeria from Ivory Coast but Apollo nunchaku pray Paul didn't release the opinion what is the my French hallelujah reported by the etching in his back his translation but Etienne you appreciate him

song in his presence praise vomit invite but a Sigma to greet you from Germany and amen well Sigma we have known each other for so many many years and he has been arel how should I say it like a lamp light on the journey and the path that God has take me and I'll never forget when he watched me and he said take care your family I was young about 23 24 years old Isaac would have been about 1 year or 2 years old and I want to know why did he tell me that but I felt like it was the angel speaking to me and I received that at all my heart and I took it not as a man telling me to kill your family but as if God is saying taken and by the grace of God has been such a source of inspiration encouragement over the years in love we appreciated me nor me everybody's home fellowshiping helped me see his life and testimony but a sigma3 to come forward and greet the people in Jesus name we're so happy to have you and your wife to suddenly strife here among us this morning oh praise the Lord God

the vision of love it thank you for your vision and allow us and that you have allowed us to enter in this vision and be a part of it is very precious for me and a very precious atmosphere in the in the room and special song leader i appreciate you so he helped us in germany and the convention in 2016 we had a mighty time with brother from south africa brother Thompson was there and many others well such a glorious time process and this is something special for me to be with believers because there is not too many in this end time will be a few and to be together with you and fellowship with you and as the precious Word of God means a lot for me brother brand him I just want to take only this one quote from a letter from brother Branham and it means also much for me to encourage us in the time we are living to make to make it to make it real in our heart to anoint ourselves and he is writing in a letter of 58 - it was a voice of healing and he's saying I now purpose to be away for a rest for a few months waiting on God and gaining new strings I'm confident that I will return to the field prepared for the fresh and greater anointing and I believe now this is a point please please watch it now I believe brother Branham said sets a vision of the coming glory will be fulfilled and he by his grades are a part of this coming lorry make use in these meetings to get closer to him and speak to him personally it's not it's not so much our face the Prophet said God cannot can only have confidence in you when you fellowship with him and this is what we are coming here to fellowship with him during this time and this attitude of believing and prophets spoke of a true witness and to be a witness and we had one true witness but the Branham said I am living since more than 30 years in heavenly places he said I never came out isn't that the challenge and he said this coming glory he prophesied and this is here so we come into a place where we never come out and he said he said I have the confidence and I will never go out and this is our place his coming glory we are living right in the midst of it as there as many misunderstanding but that doesn't matter we are living right in the midst of his coming glory it's raining outside it's raining inside the Lord is with us jesus said it's at a you don't know that I'm in the Father that's great brothers and sisters and he said I am in you and you and me and we are together with him in the father's glory god bless you richly make use for your soul in these meetings and I'm so happy to be here and may God bless all the anointed

thank you Jesus god is good all the time trace it all I want to go into a message tonight today this morning I mean which I believe will tie and shall we remain standing for the reading of the word I've given him a little mem stick there if the brothers can go across to the first page and I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the inspiration pastor the harvest time it is so broad so wide you could take several there's many facets to to this Dunant of the harvest time it's not ruthless time it's not Wiz least I'm not the Pentecostal time but this is harvest time may a few words that I will speak be a great inspiration to you is my prayer the scriptures I want to look at today in the what shall I do I'll just raise my hand I guess to go on to the next slide I want to go just in these four scriptures so I'm 27 verse 1 the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear him and the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid amen Psalms one two six six goes on to say he that goeth forth and weepeth Amen Bharath precious seed shall doubtless come your shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him man charity can't fail Isaiah 59 19 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall raise lift up a standard against him hallelujah man finally Galatians 6:8 for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting praise be to God let's go to be the picture slide brothers and then we will pray now gracious God I'm very if you were honored not only to be behind the sacred desk today but also to be seeing my beloved brethren the ministry here Oh God if I were to express my the depths of my appreciation to each one without exception dear God it would take nearly over time but dear God may they collectively receive my very deep appreciation Lord and love for them for the better we are fighting together for the their arms we are joining together to fight this common enemy Lord this terrible opposition that we are fighting all of us Lord may you bless each Minister present their God those are to minister during this weekend and may we be uplifted enriched blessed and most of all edified and that we may leave here stronger saying it was good for us to be here we ask it and give you thanks in Jesus name Amen amen you can be seated since God bless you richly praise be to God and I wanted to bring a little thought today which ties in obviously with the harvest time inspiration and I'm calling it seed in the son it sounds good it sounds happy but let's talk about it amen because it is the seed that's in the Sun and brothers you could just go to the next slide pretty much when I turn my papers you can just start over here the harvest time and I wanted to talk about this great great subject as Noah and Moses and David reflected the coming of this perfect bridegroom so has Luther Pentecost and wisly and Pentecost reflected the coming of a perfect bride isn't that real clear a man as those reflectors reflected jeepers he was a masterpiece so is the bride and identified masterpiece hallelujah and it came on like that and God is depending on you to be cut by the hammer by the chisel he's depending on you to stand there and say Lord cut me Lord shake me Lord take away everything that's not me hallelujah he's depending on you to stand there say Lord I'm ready to be cut hallelujah somebody once said we love the surgeon but we don't like the knife we love the surgeon which is the Lord Jesus Christ but we don't like the knife the knife hurts but we give God glory he's chipping chipping chipping chipping everything away that we can become a masterpiece in this end time praise be to God that's why I put the picture of the masterpiece up there let's go let's go next to the next picture brothers and here's something I think is gonna be a blessing to you but now at the end time look at this shucks here notice in the wheat the complete mystery of the life is suit up inside that shock we see it in Luther coming up we see it in tassel coming up we see it in the stalk coming up coming over here now it's in the in a shuck form almost like at the Pentecostal age but the real mystery is hidden inside hallelujah that's where you'll find it inside there you can't just rejoice with the shock the shock is just doing a job hallelujah but inside is the mystery that is sealed up I guess that seal has to be broken Amen for this this mystery to be revealed and now that all these are kind of platform quotations and the next one can play brothers he says oh brother sister are you catching it we can go cross brothers to the to the next life thanks and he says don't you see it's been failed all these ages according to what God said it will be opened in the last day those seven seals would be broke and the full thing would come into view of the people all right you God for the pool thing the seals have been broken we can see the fool thing we know who we are we know where we come from we know where we're going hallelujah we know our pedigree we know who our Father is we know our history hallelujah the full thing is revealed to the people and we we know the full thing will come into view of the people what took place all along you can be seated hallelujah let's go to something more deep and even just always a great teaching here brother band said this is a great teaching I didn't even touch the edge of it but if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the Bible it's seven months after count off those months count them off January February March April May June July he said it'll be several months which represents seven Church ages the full seven church ages now some minister might pick that up I love this doesn't matter who some Minister might pick that up are you ready and then you will have it hallelujah and we have got it hallelujah hey May we've got it praise the Lord who can shout hallelujah oh brother glory be to God I'm glad I've got it and it's by grace brother Anthony is by grace I've got it glory to God hallelujah amen amen amen hallelujah amen April amen it starts to get warm me starts to get hotter June starts to get real hot then July it gets real hot let's talk about it Thank You brothers he says as we platform this we cannot live in yesterday's like no more the same although it's been the same Sun same Sun is the same Sun but each day brings forth strength a little stronger a little stronger amen even these meetings are a little stronger than last year hey man I can feel it with all of it it's a little stronger hallelujah something a little stronger a man in your heart aiming hey my faith and glory to glory instead ripen the grain for the harvest he says each day comes true a little stronger to ripen the grain for the harvest the Sun comes today gets a little stronger see it is a Rising Sun this Sun even though it's the same time but it is a Rising Sun hey man it is the rising of the Sun something's getting stronger from glory to glory he says he says each day it will get stronger little stronger - finally a man that's laying there it'll go - taking life hallelujah it'll go - taking a life it won't just be a green seeds anymore it won't just be a it'll start taking life hallelujah I am the way I am the truth I am the life says the Lord zowie eternal life hallelujah that's what it is because the life is in the blood hallelujah it lives in the blood hallelujah each day says the life that's laying there it'll go to taking life amen and so it's not gonna just stay as it was is a man that can turn on the light the proverb goes on to say here he says after a while the life will come up the things you used to do you do them no more the things that used to interest you they don't interest you anymore you have grown you're taking life you're bolder than you used to be you pray with more power now you are taking a life life is coming in something's changing it's not bad Mike it's not my power but by my spirit saith the Lord hallelujah glory to God oh I feel so good hallelujah the life is coming in not just another teaching not just another this or that reality life is coming in hallelujah praise be to God glory to God glory to God something changes you life is coming in see he said the grain are you ready the grain should be a little more matured to receive the sunlight it's got to be more matured the grains got to be more ripened when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I ripen when I became a man brother I put away childish things not even interested just give me the Word of God give me the word monster I don't care how strong preach the word hallelujah hey man glory to God amen amen he says it's gonna be what's it more more matured to receive the sunlight a man when when the seed is green the cattle don't want it nobody you it's useless it's just like got a milk inside it's no use to anybody and even they they the combine won't recognize it because the combine is designed for a mature grain the rapture is designed for a mature Christian hallelujah and for a perfect man is designed for a ripened Christian hallelujah a Pentecostal baby won't go in the combine it will just Jam inside there hallelujah we see it momentarily while we move on praise be to God hallelujah so we're moving on now oh I love this quote Lucis manner was the message of justification Grizzly's message was the restoration of the gifts sorry what was sanctification Pentecostal was the restoration of the gifts but this time a shout this is this is the introducing the headstone the last day the bride tree which is contrary to all of it but it's the same light for the mature we've got a mature we can't be into petty politics and and and envy and comparing and childishness we've got to ripen we've got to mature hallelujah we can't stay down there we've got to come up hither Amen hallelujah glory to God he said the same sunshine today amen we'll be rifling the grain for the harvest in July you see what I mean but the light today won't do good any back back there in July amen who else now is stronger the real July heat would would kill the plant the plant needed time to mature to ripen you can't give it full strength hey man it would kill it July Sun could kill you it could kill you you have to be ripened to receive it you have to be maturing to receive the sunshine because it's very strong praise me regard is stronger see you've got to be ready to take it I said like the same Sun ripening the grain for the harvest here I mean but the light today won't work it's stronger the wheat is more advanced how many of you is more advanced we are more advanced hallelujah we got no more TV evangelism and all this stuff we now want the world we don't want milk we want meat now hallelujah we want the real thing advanced Shula hey man glory hallelujah amen praise be to God says friends listen we've got to lay in the presence of the the Sun it is presence that's where I belong it is presence that's where I am strong hallelujah oh my God thank you Jesus amen friend we've got to lay in the presence of the Sun we've got to be ripened our faith isn't ripe my brother people can be in the message is that the church is beginning to hear the message in 1965 beginning to hear the message but the water is the faith isn't ripe intellectually we're hearing the message that God gave us but we've got to get ripened we've got a mature we've got to do it we've got to ripen it's not an option you have to be mature ray hallelujah for this day let's go to the next one brothers and this is one of my favorites here he says lay out in the presence of the of God with our hearts not just our hands but with our hearts amen did you notice I changed from the Sun to the burning bush because that's the presence that's the real presence we're in front of that's his presence that's what's gonna ripen us it ripened Moses and he took off his shoes amen hallelujah until he is he says no other hand so much but our hearts before God until he has seasoned us true and true like that with the Rays of his glory hallelujah thank God for those rays of his glory rays of a feel the Rays of glory tonight hallelujah rays of his glory glory to God amen and and he has baked into us baked into us His goodness and ripened that which we have got into reality not just I mean the message but he says that we can show others that Jesus lives we can show others hallelujah silver and gold I have none but such as I have I give unto thee you can show others hallelujah that Jesus lives praise be to the name of the Lord amen amen Moses knew it Moses knew everything but he needed the burning bush he needed the word to speak back to him then he saw the reality this is not just like a Sunday School it's a reality this message is Jesus Christ hallelujah hey my brother it is Jesus Christ hallelujah this cross over let's let's talk about something now he says now there's the situation here it says notice how more like it's gotta be like the real thing Mary was but like the shock it hugs the see see it's in the way it's hugging the sea it's hugging the seed energy in itself the shock it just wraps around the seed and it protects it Kamisha protects it protects it and it nurtures it until happening and or if
