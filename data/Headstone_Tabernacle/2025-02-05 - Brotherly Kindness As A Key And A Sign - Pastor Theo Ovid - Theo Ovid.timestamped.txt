[23:06] thank you for the word for the atonement

[23:11] of this prophetic Vision that was
[23:13] released by this end time messenger

[23:16] your word with your spirit with your
[23:18] presence and power With Your Love
[23:20] granted God in Jesus name I ask it amen
[23:22] God bless you it's good to be back I was
[23:26] out of the country special
[23:29] but we are back so tonight I like to
[23:32] turn to Psalms 103 we want to read from
[23:35] 8 to4 Matthew 6
[23:38] 9-15 and Ephesians
[23:41] 429 to 32 reading from Psalms
[23:49] 1038 the Lord is merciful and
[23:52] gracious slow to anger and plenteous in
[23:57] Mercy he will not always tride neither
[24:00] will he keep his anger forever he ha not
[24:03] dealt with us after our sins nor
[24:06] rewarded us according to our
[24:09] iniquities but as the heaven is high
[24:12] above the Earth so great is his Mercy
[24:15] towards them that fear Him and as far as
[24:18] the East is from the West so far had he
[24:20] removed our transgression from us like
[24:25] as a father peted his children so the
[24:29] P them that fear Him for he knoweth our
[24:32] frame he remember but be on Dust Matthew
[24:41] chapter I'm going to read from
[24:46] verse Jesus speaks after this manner
[24:49] therefore pray ye Our Father which art
[24:52] in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy
[24:56] kingdom come thy will be done Earth
[24:59] as it is in heaven give us this day our
[25:02] daily bread and forgive us our debts as
[25:06] we forgive our
[25:07] debtors and lead us not into temptation
[25:10] but Deliver Us from Evil for that is the
[25:14] Kingdom power and the glory forever amen
[25:18] for if ye forgive men their
[25:22] trespasses your heavenly father will
[25:24] also forgive you but if you forgive not
[25:27] men TR es neither will your father
[25:31] forgive your trespasses our last scri is
[25:33] from
[25:34] Ephesians from 4 read verse 29 it
[25:39] reads let no corrupt communication
[25:43] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[25:45] is good to the use of
[25:48] edify that it may Minister Grace unto
[25:51] the heers and grieve not the holy spirit
[25:56] of God whereby
[25:59] the day of redemption let all bitterness
[26:02] and wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[26:06] speaking be put away from you with all
[26:10] malice and be kind one to another
[26:14] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[26:17] as God for Christ's sake had forgiven
[26:20] you may God bless his word you may be
[26:22] seated praise the name of the
[26:25] Lord so tonight I have a a special
[26:28] Something in My Heart I'd like to share
[26:30] with you and the title I have tonight is
[26:32] brotherly kindness as a key and a
[26:38] sign brotherly kindness as a key and a
[26:41] sign the ti have tonight a sign of
[26:44] maturity and a key that open UPS a
[26:48] channel to pull down charity or to pull
[26:52] down the love of God or to pull down the
[26:54] Holy Spirit you see where brotherly
[26:56] kindness is located just to the top the
[27:00] pyramid is wide at the bottom it is
[27:02] challenges as it get to the top because
[27:04] it get to the top it narrows it Narrows
[27:07] down to the blood of the age it Narrows
[27:10] down to the spirit of forgiveness it
[27:12] Narrows down to challenge all of us to
[27:15] make sure there's no ODS grudges
[27:17] bitterness or issues in our hearts now
[27:21] Jesus when he read this
[27:23] scripture how to pray in the Amplified I
[27:28] I want to read it and forgive us our
[27:30] debts as we also have
[27:34] forgiven left remitted let go of the
[27:39] debts and give them up resentment
[27:42] against our debtors and lead us bring us
[27:46] not in temptation but Deliver Us from
[27:47] all evil for yours is the kingdom the
[27:50] power and the glory but if you forgive
[27:52] people their trespasses their Reckless
[27:56] and willful sins leaving them letting
[28:00] them go giving up resentment your
[28:03] heavenly father will also forgive
[28:06] you but if you do not forgive others
[28:09] their trespasses this is amplifying now
[28:11] their Reckless and willful sins leaving
[28:15] them letting them go giving up
[28:18] resentment that resentment is resentment
[28:20] in you not only must you let it go but
[28:23] you have to give up this word called
[28:25] resentment so I want to drill down a bit
[28:27] to tonight these are things I never did
[28:29] before but I feel led to do this now
[28:32] resentment is the feeling of angry
[28:36] displeasure at something regarded as
[28:39] wrong insult or
[28:42] injury in a relationship a mixture of
[28:46] anger frustration and bitterness that
[28:48] builds up over time you get a husband
[28:51] resenting a wife a wife resenting a
[28:53] husband somebody resenting is something
[28:56] that just builds up over time there is
[28:58] no one specific cause of resentment but
[29:01] we know it is the enemy but this merging
[29:03] of disgust disappointment disapproval
[29:06] bitterness anger towards someone can
[29:09] creep in and take a hold of you
[29:12] resentment is when you hold on to the
[29:15] anger at not being treated as well as
[29:19] you think you
[29:20] deserve do you get that let me read it
[29:23] again resentment is when you hold on to
[29:26] the anger I forgive him you know but
[29:28] you're
[29:28] Vex you said have resentment in your
[29:32] heart you know forgive you know drop it
[29:35] but there's something there you have a
[29:36] feeling towards that person you can't
[29:39] even relate to that person because there
[29:41] was something there it's a feeling that
[29:42] is there so how can you come out of
[29:45] resentment you can come out of
[29:46] resentment forgive for Christ's
[29:48] sake when you think he has forgiven you
[29:52] then you should be free to forgive
[29:53] others and Let It Go
[29:58] W so this
[30:01] night it's an important night it's
[30:03] important word this should share with us
[30:06] a key to fate a key to
[30:08] Healing question why would God show
[30:11] brother Bram his
[30:14] forgiveness after he was saved and
[30:16] filled with the Holy
[30:19] Ghost did you get that but AB Bram had
[30:23] to go through actual experience for God
[30:25] to show him about forgiveness this is
[30:28] after he is saved after he have the Holy
[30:30] Ghost you have to take him to a
[30:33] restaurant and show him a woman and he
[30:35] say God my daughter go raised in this
[30:37] kind of condition why don't burn on the
[30:39] place and whatnot go tap him on the
[30:41] shoulder give him a vision of him as a
[30:43] little child all his sins comeing to God
[30:45] and His sins being bumped off and a
[30:48] bookmark forgiven and God put his sins
[30:50] in the sea of forgetfulness he said I
[30:51] forgive you and you could never
[30:53] her do you get this this is a prophet
[30:58] saved Sanctified filled with the Holy
[31:00] Ghost but still need Clarity and a
[31:03] revelation and experience of God's
[31:05] forgiveness that's how important it
[31:11] is because you know what was coming up a
[31:14] test so I have this here why would God
[31:17] show B branam his forgiveness after he
[31:20] was saved and filled with the Holy Ghost
[31:22] is this key connected to the third
[31:26] person this key key of
[31:29] forgiveness how God want us to forgive
[31:32] one another
[31:34] unforgiveness what it does let's go
[31:39] forgiveness forgiveness is the release
[31:42] on the part of the Creditor or the
[31:43] offended party of any expectation that a
[31:48] debt will be repaid in the Old Testament
[31:51] this thing about debt was con connected
[31:53] to finance and that's why when a family
[31:56] is owing they were sold into slavery and
[31:58] bondage and that's why you would hear
[32:00] the Year of Jubilee and so on because
[32:02] this was a critical thing in those times
[32:04] you fall into debt then you have to sell
[32:07] your whole children your whole family
[32:08] and then be a slave to that whatever it
[32:11] is and so on until here the year Jubilee
[32:13] or until somebody pay off that debt so
[32:16] the Bible that why Jesus pray the pray
[32:18] forgive us our debt as we forgive our
[32:21] debts that was the condition that was
[32:24] the idea that was the thought that was
[32:27] waited at that time so therefore watch
[32:31] so forgiveness the release on the part
[32:33] of the Creditor or offended party of any
[32:36] expectation that a debt will be
[32:39] repaid or that the offender will receive
[32:42] punishment for an offense So when you
[32:44] say reap s um let God judge him and you
[32:48] have forgive nothing you're in
[32:52] wickedness do you get that now I will
[32:55] see what happened to him and you're
[32:56] looking to see when he go fall or when
[32:58] you going to
[32:58] crash because he do this he do that she
[33:03] do this she do that and you're looking
[33:04] for things to mash
[33:10] up the removal of this debt or this
[33:15] expectation of being paid back does not
[33:17] condone the behavior it doesn't agree
[33:21] with the behavior of the person but it
[33:23] releases them you don't have nothing you
[33:25] don't owe me nothing you are free
[33:28] because that is what God did to us we
[33:30] were born in sin shap and in and Jesus
[33:33] come and drop our charges and say you
[33:35] don't owe me anything you are free as if
[33:38] you never did it oh give the Lord a
[33:40] shout tonight as if you never did Sin as
[33:42] if you never did fall as if you never
[33:44] they failed oh give the Lord some
[33:46] Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah so
[33:49] in the Old Testament this word forgive
[33:51] this the word called zaka an offense
[33:54] against someone the result is a kind of
[33:57] forget fulness concerning the debt so in
[33:59] the Old Testament when you forgive you
[34:01] forget you let it go you oh God you
[34:04] ready Bor for me ready owe me you know
[34:06] and you're o and you and you're writing
[34:08] your mind you're talking to this one
[34:09] about it you're telling this one about
[34:11] that let's go the result of a kind of
[34:15] forgetfulness concerning the deth of
[34:17] offense it also Carri the word to atone
[34:21] cleaning repairing in the New Testament
[34:25] the term that it gives I wouldn't call
[34:27] all the Greek term and whatnot and
[34:28] Hebrew and whatnot it's it's not
[34:30] reconing an offense against someone in
[34:34] other words you know they did it but
[34:35] you're not hold it against
[34:38] them am I preaching to Believers
[34:42] tonight it's a release from an
[34:45] obligation or a removal of a burden
[34:48] within this context oh this forgiveness
[34:51] may be portray but may be portrayed as a
[34:53] release from an obligation
[34:58] shimi begged David to forgive him in 2
[35:01] Samuel 19:19 and he said unto the king
[35:04] let not my Lord impute iniquity unto me
[35:07] neither do do thou remember that which
[35:10] thy servant did perversely the day that
[35:12] my Lord the king went of Jerusalem that
[35:15] the king should take it to heart this is
[35:17] the man begging oh God don't hold it
[35:19] against me oh God don't hold it against
[35:21] me I was acting perversely I was acting
[35:23] contrary but to hold it on me again
[35:28] in Ezekiel 13:14 this is God speaks God
[35:32] speaking when I say unto the wicked Thou
[35:35] shalt surely die if he turn from his sin
[35:39] and do that which is lawful and right if
[35:41] the wicked restore the pledge give again
[35:43] that what he had robbed walk in the
[35:45] statutes of life without committing
[35:47] iniquity he shall surely live he shall
[35:50] not die none of his sins that he had
[35:53] committed shall be mentioned unto him
[35:56] this is God talking that that Hallelujah
[36:00] a wicked man repent a wicked man make
[36:04] things right a wicked man Hallelujah
[36:07] come back in line God said none of his
[36:10] sins hey that he had committed shall be
[36:14] mentioned unto him he had done that
[36:17] which is lawful and right he shall
[36:19] surely live could we hear a shout in the
[36:22] house tonight oh give the Lord some
[36:24] Praises oh this is called a jubilee in
[36:27] your soul tonight
[36:31] Hallelujah such
[36:34] forgetfulness focus on the magnanimous
[36:37] action of the one who is granting that
[36:41] forgiveness hallelujah hallelujah
[36:43] forgiveness has not taken account of
[36:46] wrong in the sense it treats an offense
[36:49] as a debt that would no longer be
[36:51] counted against somebody account so when
[36:54] you have the book there you owe me you
[36:55] owe me owe me when you forgive you drop
[36:57] it no longer in any books you take it
[36:59] out the books it is cancelled Jesus drop

[37:30] Glory metaphorically they said this is
[37:33] like a blemish that must be covered a
[37:35] stain that must be cleansed a disease or
[37:38] fracture that must be healed forgiveness
[37:40] can be expressed as any of these actions
[37:44] oh glory to God God in Psalms 32:1 says

[37:50] Forgiven whose sin is covered Oh Glory

[45:31] ordinary restaurant and and a young lady
[45:34] about 18 years old and so on and nice
[45:38] and so on and when I look to my right I
[45:40] heard someone making a big groan and
[45:42] there was an age woman maybe 60 years
[45:45] she had on Old vulgar clothes big makeup
[45:49] across the table sat two men drunk one
[45:51] of them a old army and so on I stood
[45:55] there I said God why don't you destroy
[45:57] the whole thing why don't you just sink
[45:58] it beneath the Earth is my little Sarah
[46:00] and Rebecca going to have to grow up
[46:01] under such stuff like that how can you
[46:03] God in your great Holiness ever stand

[46:19] recording bur them destroy them because
[46:22] I can't stand
[46:24] it is man talking watch
[46:27] this as I was standing there condemning
[46:31] the woman as I was I stepped back behind
[46:34] the door I felt the spirit of God come
[46:36] to me I seen something whing in a vision
[46:41] it was the world went wrong and wrong I
[46:44] noticed around the world a Scarlet
[46:46] streak around the world I seen myself as
[46:49] a little boy doing things I ought not to
[46:52] do and every time I did anything a great
[46:56] black shadow go towards heaven which God
[46:58] could have killed me at that minute then
[47:00] I seen standing between me and God a
[47:04] perfect sacrifice I see him standing
[47:06] there with torns on his side spit
[47:08] hanging on his face and every time my
[47:10] sin would start towards God he'd reach
[47:12] it and catch it like a bumper everything
[47:15] coming up and he catching
[47:17] it he's catching it before it which God
[47:20] he's like
[47:21] pumper he was protecting me from death
[47:25] and every time I do anything wrong God
[47:27] would have killed me his Holiness
[47:29] requires it his Law requires it every
[47:33] time I do anything or you do anything

[55:54] of God say father here's my
[55:56] brother he he he is justly he deserves
[56:00] punishment because he has done me evil I
[56:03] don't see why he did
[56:05] it then let go God go talking to you and
[56:09] you will see maybe what that man has
[56:12] been
[56:13] true the devil has Twisted him up
[56:16] somewhere and caused him to do that
[56:19] though he is absolutely
[56:22] wrong before you leave the Throne of God
[56:25] you'll feel sorry for that man you'll be
[56:28] sympathizing with that brother and when
[56:30] you get back to where Earth again you
[56:32] will go over to that brother and shake
[56:34] his hand cuz you know what he's been
[56:37] through you can't stand with a mortal in
[56:42] the presence of God and condemn
[56:45] anybody did you get that that is why
[56:49] when Isaiah got into God's presence he
[56:51] said whoo is me what presence these
[56:54] ministers are in when they talking the
[56:56] crap behind the pulpit and sewing seed
[56:58] of lies and evil and wickedness causing
[57:01] the people to become so bitter something
[57:03] is wrong the message is divided and
[57:05] broken up because of those men but their
[57:08] time is coming their time is going to be
[57:11] up because the honey look like it won't
[57:13] stick but it's going to stick he said we
[57:16] have to get into the unity of the spirit
[57:19] until we get to the unity of the faith
[57:22] oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah and
[57:25] the unity of the SP Spirit has nothing
[57:27] to do with Doctrine I ain't seen it so I
[57:29] a see it
[57:32] so who need Thunders who nothing
[57:34] Thunders people who talking Thunders
[57:35] talk for years and they have no life
[57:37] shut your mouth and sit down you have no
[57:39] life keep quiet Thunders is the mystery
[57:42] tell another the mystery tell the virtue
[57:44] tell the virtue so what where is the
[57:46] life where is the thunder that shakes
[57:49] the devil the devil Ain taking no talk
[57:52] the devil wants something that is active
[57:54] that is alive that him hard that s him
[57:57] running oh give the Lord some
[58:14] Praises what about a brother has made a
[58:17] mistake do I say he's wrong sometime
[58:20] he's accused wrong when he's not wrong
[58:23] but if he is wrong well if if we will
[58:26] take him to the throne of God start
[58:28] there shoulders over the brother knowing
[58:30] he's a mortal maybe his destination this
[58:32] is big hear this bomb
[58:36] maybe his destination rest upon our
[58:40] attitude towards
[58:42] him his
[58:44] destination I don't know if I'll get to
[58:46] read it but I'm talking about brotherly
[58:48] kindness putting your foot in your
[58:52] brother's shoes on the matter not
[58:55] sitting long judging why you do that why
[58:56] you say that you wearing his shoes
[58:58] suppose his shoes has some tax in it
[59:01] that's sticking him you not wearing that
[59:03] shoes your shoes don't have those hurts
[59:06] he has those hurts in his shoes put on
[59:08] his shoes and you'd walk like him put on
[59:10] his shoes you would fall like him put on
[59:12] his shoes you would fail like him put on
[59:15] his shoes Give the Lord some Praises
[59:17] tonight
[59:26] knowing he's mortal maybe he's this
[59:27] destination rest upon our attitude
[59:28] towards him when we come back from the
[59:31] Throne of God we realize that we are
[59:34] everyone guilty and we all need help one
[59:36] from another and the best way to do is
[59:39] to pray recently I had a breakfast with
[59:42] a bunch of ministers and I say this with
[59:44] respect Brethren I would rather have a
[59:46] breakfast with a bunch of wish doctors
[59:49] now know that's so horrible to say these
[59:51] men I would had a better reception I had
[59:54] a more agreeing spirit with a bunch of
[59:56] wish
[59:57] doctors that's how terrible them Spirits
[59:59] was but I'm saying better with wi
[1:00:01] doctors because wi doctors in the spirit
[1:00:03] them have devil Spirit upon abundantly
[1:00:05] Spirit these guys are dry intellectuals
[1:00:07] let me read
[1:00:09] down I had been more a green spirit with
[1:00:12] a bunch of wi doctors many times than I
[1:00:13] would with a bunch of ministers such a
[1:00:15] horrible thing God Deliver Us from such
[1:00:18] Deliver Us from Evil I just say
[1:00:22] that we are so
[1:00:24] intellectual every is moved away from
[1:00:27] the spirit it's the word it's the word
[1:00:29] it's the word I'm
[1:00:31] reading I'm reading it's the Mysteries
[1:00:33] is the Mysteries is the histories and
[1:00:35] the Mysteries I'm reading we are so
[1:00:39] intellectual everything is mov away from
[1:00:41] the spirit it's the word it's the word
[1:00:43] is the word I believe in the word but if
[1:00:45] the spirit don't agree with the word
[1:00:46] then you got something mixed up
[1:00:48] somewhere that's why you say the word is
[1:00:50] truth but the word is a person if the
[1:00:52] word is not connected to the spirit of
[1:00:53] Truth what it is Satan must quoting the
[1:00:56] word it wasn't the spirit truth quoting
[1:00:57] that it was the Devil Himself quoting
[1:00:59] Bible hallelujah hallelujah you shall
[1:01:02] know the truth and the truth shall set
[1:01:04] you free oh praise God let's
[1:01:10] go one day bam came
[1:01:13] home and he was talking about the
[1:01:15] children and his
[1:01:16] wife and his wife ask her bill give him

[1:01:31] and I thought that's all right PA little
[1:01:32] fellow didn't mean that he said
[1:01:35] that she didn't mean that I went out to
[1:01:39] wash my car and when I got out there the
[1:01:43] Holy Spirit didn't like
[1:01:45] it now we talking about human now and
[1:01:49] you're talking about supernatural now
[1:01:51] this is his wife she asked him to put
[1:01:54] some licks on the child
[1:01:56] he say he just couldn't deal with it she
[1:01:58] walked in she slammed the door normal he
[1:02:01] said she mean Holy Spirit talking to him
[1:02:05] now you don't like
[1:02:07] it go tell
[1:02:10] her second chronicles 22nd chapter I
[1:02:14] thought at first I imagined that I kept
[1:02:16] on watching he said go tell her to read
[1:02:19] this I went in got the Bible and read it
[1:02:24] of Miriam the prophet made fun of her
[1:02:26] brother Moses for marrying an Ethiopian
[1:02:31] girl and God didn't like that God
[1:02:35] rebuked them and said this man does I
[1:02:36] talking lip the air to that man you
[1:02:38] questioning the wife Mar you like she
[1:02:41] Mar Ethiopian
[1:02:44] girl so Miriam broke up with Leprosy all
[1:02:47] over and Aaron come and told his sister
[1:02:50] his brother she's dying with Leprosy and
[1:02:52] Moses run to intercede for her at the
[1:02:54] altar and when he did the pillar of fire
[1:02:57] came down and God said go call her and
[1:02:59] Aon and bring them here Aaron was in it
[1:03:03] too he said call them and come here he
[1:03:06] said if there be one among you that is
[1:03:09] spiritual or a prophet I the Lord will
[1:03:12] make myself known to him I will speak to
[1:03:14] him in visions and reveal myself to him
[1:03:16] by dreams he said but my servant Moses
[1:03:20] there is no one in the land like him I
[1:03:22] speak with him lip to air don't you fear
[1:03:25] God
[1:03:26] God didn't like
[1:03:28] it but then I seen that I run in she was
[1:03:31] in another room I knocked on the door
[1:03:33] she had shut herself up I told her I
[1:03:35] wanted to speak to her I went in there
[1:03:37] talked to her tried to tell her what it
[1:03:39] was I said sweetheart you know how I
[1:03:41] love you but God didn't like that you
[1:03:44] oughtn't to have said that immediately
[1:03:47] after that she took a trouble in her
[1:03:49] side we took her to the doctor in
[1:03:51] Louisville and he found a tumor on her
[1:03:53] left ovary 15 six year before tum left

[1:04:10] but it was testing our faith we
[1:04:11] constantly prayed the more we prayed the
[1:04:13] bigger the tumor growed till it got to a
[1:04:15] place till it was sticking out on our

[1:10:08] have 14 pages and know the end of 10 so
[1:10:11] we're going good scripture Mark
[1:10:14] 11 Jesus answered said unto them have
[1:10:17] faith in God for very Li un to
[1:10:20] you I will ask a question is this key
[1:10:23] connected to the
[1:10:26] it it is here Jesus giv it third P
[1:10:31] first that whosoever shall say to his
[1:10:33] Mountain be
[1:10:34] moved and be cast into the sea and shall
[1:10:38] not doubt in his heart but shall believe
[1:10:40] that those things which he sayth shall
[1:10:41] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:10:44] sayth therefore I say unto you what
[1:10:47] things soever you desire When you pray
[1:10:50] believe you receive them and he shall
[1:10:52] have them are he second then come to the
[1:10:55] first B here but when you stand

[1:10:59] forgive if you have ought against
[1:11:02] any that your father which also in
[1:11:04] heaven May forgive you of your
[1:11:06] trespasses but if you do not forgive
[1:11:09] neither will your father in Heaven
