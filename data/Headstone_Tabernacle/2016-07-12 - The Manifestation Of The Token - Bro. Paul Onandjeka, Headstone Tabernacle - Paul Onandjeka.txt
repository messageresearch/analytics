22 he say this he say well the same child who was born in the family can be adopted in that same family or place in the same family otherwise a position was given to him in the family where he was born the work of the Holy SP today in the church trying to place in the position Apostle for some teachers prophets and others and we have the many false alarms and all that happened amongst the people show that the true andine is Drawing Near I believe it is only God who can do the placing in the church it is the business of God not the business of a man it is not a man business a man cannot adopt himself a man cannot say you will be adopted a man cannot say you are a fivefold minister this is only God's business let the redeem say amen hallelujah hallelujah glory amen amen amen amen now God God will place in his church Cor in a COR cor way Apostles the prophet Prophets The Doctor teachers evangelist evangelists not people that are coming from seminaries or from but God will place them in the church there will not be men toss through and fr theologians people God will place in the church according to his own purpose I love that I love that I love that according to God's own choice ACC that God the Holy Spirit instructed the church and it up and God will adopt and give them their position and give his son their position they are already Sons but he's about to see if they are wor of their position that that he has that he has in store for them the position that he has chosen for them and this is God's business a man can choose a deacon a man can choose a user but to choose a fivefold minister this is God himself this is not a man bus this is not somebody this is only God [Applause] it do you believe it this is God's Own Business it is only God himself who called Moses it was God who called Jeremiah it was God who himself men called of God not a man called by a man not a man called by a man but God called man and when God called a man he will he will he will trust this [Applause] man oh hallelujah oh hallelujah amen amen amen amen amen called you am you must account to this man you must please this man but if it is God who called you you will do everything to please and he will give you a work to do am am amen amen and we are in this meeting because we believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's not dead he's on the earth he's on Earth he's alive he's real he can heal you he can change your life he can deliver you he can anoint you he can do something and I'm here to be F I am here to be in this to see to see
