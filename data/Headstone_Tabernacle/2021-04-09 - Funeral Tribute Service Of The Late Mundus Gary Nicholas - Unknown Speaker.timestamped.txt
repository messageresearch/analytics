[45:48] thanks thanks for coming and um
[45:52] you know i
[45:54] some funerals
[45:55] when you hear
[45:56] words spoken about the person in the box
[45:58] sometimes the ones if in the right
[46:00] funeral
[46:01] because how they live and what the
[46:03] person is saying about them is two
[46:05] different things but this is not so
[46:07] what you hear is what was there
[46:10] he lived his testimony
[46:12] he spoke a word and he lived that word
[46:14] so today i want to welcome
[46:16] i want to invite brother lantern uh
[46:18] baramundus he was his pastor for many
[46:20] many years i want to ask but a lantern
[46:23] pastor antony if he could come forward
[46:24] and say a few words i sure he would have
[46:27] something that he could share
[46:29] [Applause]
[46:45] god bless everyone
[46:48] it was a privilege for me to be here i
[46:50] specifically asked to be part of this
[46:53] small group
[46:55] because brother one does meant
[46:57] quite a lot to me
[47:00] and there are two things that are
[47:01] outstanding i won't be long there are
[47:03] two things that are outstanding
[47:05] about brother mundus
[47:07] one is on the spiritual side as the
[47:10] eulogy said and many people would
[47:13] testify he loved the lord and he loved
[47:16] the word
[47:17] and i remember
[47:19] in the early days when he just came into
[47:20] the message
[47:22] his great enthusiasm and his great
[47:24] desire
[47:25] was for everybody in the world
[47:29] especially
[47:30] the churches he came out from and so on
[47:33] he wanted them to
[47:34] just ignore this
[47:36] message and i remember that's very much
[47:39] about him
[47:40] but
[47:41] on the natural side
[47:43] his sense of humor
[47:46] was
[47:47] out of this world
[47:49] totally delightful
[47:53] and
[47:55] i remember an incident
[47:57] in which he was
[47:58] because he
[47:59] he was a painter and he was um
[48:02] he was working on our house
[48:05] doing some painting with some other
[48:07] brothers
[48:09] and he was on a ladder that led to the
[48:12] upstairs of our bedroom
[48:14] so he was just outside there
[48:17] and he needed i think a paintbrush i
[48:18] can't remember what it was but he needed
[48:20] something
[48:22] so we attempted to open the window
[48:25] to give him what it was
[48:28] and brother mundus you know normally
[48:30] somebody would say no no no don't open
[48:32] the window because it could affect him
[48:35] but amanda's in a most matter-of-fact
[48:39] voice
[48:41] said nah
[48:44] do from the window
[48:46] otherwise i gotta take it downstairs
[48:50] [Applause]
[48:56] [Applause]
[48:58] and that was
[49:02] so
[49:03] and i just want the family to know in
[49:05] closing
[49:07] that our prayers are genuinely with them
[49:10] a man especially his wife they were like
[49:12] two quads
[49:14] and um
[49:15] certainly we'd be praying for y'all god
[49:17] bless you richie
[49:19] [Music]
[49:22] [Applause]
[49:35] okay so
[49:37] i would like to jesus stand i'll read
[49:39] one scripture and i'll read some two
[49:41] more scriptures that's one verse one
[49:42] scripture from romans 6 chapter 23
[49:51] it says for the wages of sin is death
[49:54] but the gift of god is eternal life
[49:56] through jesus christ our lord you may be
[49:58] seated
[49:59] and this other scripture from 1st
[50:01] thessalonians 4 it reads 5 would not
[50:03] have you to be ignorant brethren
[50:05] considering them which are asleep
[50:07] that you sorrow not
[50:09] even as others which have no hope for if
[50:11] we believe that jesus died and rules
[50:13] again even so them also will sleep in
[50:15] jesus will god bring with him
[50:17] for this we see unto you
[50:19] by the word of the lord that we which
[50:21] are alive and remain unto the coming of
[50:22] the lord shall not prevent them which
[50:24] are asleep for the lord himself
[50:27] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[50:29] with the voice of the archangel are with
[50:31] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[50:33] shall rise first
[50:34] then we which are alive and remain shall
[50:37] be caught up together with them in the
[50:38] clouds to meet the lord in the ear
[50:41] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[50:43] therefore comfort one another with these
[50:45] words
[50:46] last scripture readiness from revelation
[50:48] 20
[50:49] verse 12 to 15 i saw the dead
[50:51] listen carefully
[50:53] i saw the dead
[50:55] small and great stand before god
[50:58] all the dead
[51:01] and the books were open
[51:03] and another book was open which is the
[51:05] book of life
[51:06] and the dead were judged out of those
[51:09] things which were written in the books
[51:11] according to their works
[51:13] and the sea give up the dead which were
[51:16] in it
[51:16] and debt and hell
[51:18] delivered up the dead which were in them
[51:21] and they were judged every man
[51:23] according to their works
[51:25] and debt and hell
[51:26] were cast into the lake of fire this is
[51:29] the second debt
[51:31] i know you don't hear much about that
[51:33] what you see in here is the first death
[51:36] there is something called a second dead
[51:38] that does not affect the christians
[51:40] but there is something called
[51:43] the second death
[51:45] this one is easy
[51:47] the other one is different
[51:49] and death and hell were cast in the lake
[51:51] of fire this is the second death and
[51:54] whosoever was not found written in the
[51:55] book of life
[51:56] was cast into the lake of fire let's
[51:59] pray heavenly father i thank you for
[52:00] your word and i thank you for your
[52:02] people guided here and i pray a release
[52:04] comfort this is among us
[52:06] the children the family may you
[52:09] who stick it closer than a brother
[52:11] comfort them by your spirit by your love
[52:14] by the presence by the anointing reach
[52:16] out to them and blanket them with the
[52:18] token of life granted lord and jesus in
[52:20] my ask it email
[52:23] i have a taught to share with you we
[52:24] just have a few more minutes and
[52:27] when time runs out
[52:30] when time
[52:32] runs out
[52:34] iklassi's tree says to everything
[52:36] there's a season
[52:38] a time to every purpose
[52:41] a time to be born
[52:44] a time to die a time to plant
[52:47] time to pluck up that which is planted a
[52:49] time to kill
[52:50] heal break down build up weep
[52:54] laugh mourn a time to dance
[52:57] time to cast away stones
[52:59] time to gather stones together time to
[53:01] embrace time to refrain from embracing
[53:04] our time to get time to lose
[53:06] time to keep a time to cast away
[53:08] time to run the time to sow time to keep
[53:11] silence and a time to speak a time to
[53:14] love and a time
[53:16] to hate
[53:17] time of war
[53:18] on a time of peace
[53:21] it is an illusion to operate and speak
[53:23] as if you're here permanently
[53:26] we are in time
[53:28] and time is at the beginning
[53:31] and time comes to an end
[53:33] version 10 5 and the angel which i saw
[53:36] stand upon the scene upon the earth
[53:38] lifted up his hand to heaven
[53:40] and swore and said there should be time
[53:43] no longer
[53:44] time itself
[53:46] runs out
[53:48] and all what we have to do in life is
[53:51] within time
[53:53] and if time run out the purpose that
[53:55] your reason for will not be accomplished
[53:58] you know become like school
[54:00] go to primary school form one to form
[54:02] five
[54:04] within those five years
[54:06] the student the child is supposed to
[54:07] learn
[54:08] i'm supposed to graduate
[54:10] sometimes times run out and they don't
[54:12] didn't learn what they're supposed to
[54:13] learn
[54:14] and they find yourself behind
[54:17] don't be caught there where time runs
[54:19] out on you
[54:22] this angel with this book this little
[54:24] book
[54:26] the devil they see all except whose
[54:28] names are written on this book
[54:31] but among us as i know him
[54:33] was a i called the bible talk about the
[54:35] last days men shall be lovers of
[54:37] pleasures more than lovers of god
[54:40] i call him a lover of god
[54:43] genuinely lover of god
[54:46] many time after service he just watched
[54:47] me and smile he say i don't know what to
[54:48] say his whole and he doesn't smile with
[54:51] his lips you know his old face was
[54:52] smiling
[54:53] his whole face was smiling he just loved
[54:56] god
[54:57] he loved the word
[54:59] there are very few people like that
[55:02] i call him an authentic
[55:04] person he was no copy
[55:07] he was original
[55:09] and that's what carried the value and
[55:11] weight of what he was
[55:13] and that that word authentic means true
[55:17] true to one's personality spirit a
[55:19] character it means
[55:21] exactly and actually what is claimed
[55:24] authentic being fully trustworthy
[55:26] according to fact genuine not fake or
[55:30] counterfeit the opposite of that is
[55:31] counterfeit fake false falsifies
[55:34] unauthorized ungenuine unreal
[55:37] but he was an authentic individual
[55:40] god help us to be authentic you know
[55:42] everybody if they were not black
[55:44] everyone in black hat now anybody where
[55:45] now white jersey everyone white jersey
[55:47] where he won this every you know the
[55:49] same thing he was original he was
[55:51] authentic and that is why we're here to
[55:53] give that respect
[55:55] to a real christian a genuine son of god
[55:59] we are here because the wages of sin is
[56:02] still dead
[56:04] we are here because man fell
[56:06] we wasn't supposed to get old
[56:08] he wasn't supposed to get gray
[56:10] he was supposed to be young
[56:12] right now he is young
[56:14] he is in the region of the bliss
[56:16] he with the saints who going on before
[56:19] he is waiting right now for people to
[56:21] come to perfection
[56:23] to make a resurrection call
[56:25] he is waiting for the voice of the
[56:27] archangel to come by and through a bride
[56:30] and that's why we are here
[56:31] as a people to come to perfection
[56:33] because he is waiting on us
[56:35] and the bible said day without us are
[56:37] not made perfect
[56:38] we have something better to do something
[56:40] we have something better to achieve so a
[56:43] life here is for purpose
[56:45] but it's all have to do with in time
[56:47] some miss that time
[56:49] it's not when you're born
[56:51] is that when you're finished is what
[56:52] happened in between
[56:54] it's not the name you're born into
[56:56] nicholas is that the name you're given
[56:58] mundus it's the third name
[57:00] the name you make for yourself
[57:02] it's the most important name
[57:04] and you make that name by how you live
[57:07] by how you act by what you do the name
[57:09] you make for yourself oh blessed be the
[57:13] name of the lord
[57:14] so when man fell
[57:16] god had to keep his word
[57:17] god is not a trinidad and he's the word
[57:19] he said the day you eat thereof that day
[57:21] you die
[57:22] and he didn't back down
[57:24] adam died and he was driven off of the
[57:27] garden of eden
[57:28] not escorted out
[57:30] driven out
[57:31] angels with swords
[57:33] was guarding the tree of life
[57:35] god surely didn't want to allow man
[57:37] to be in that sinful condition and
[57:40] partaking of this eternal life
[57:42] so he run them out
[57:44] but in this hour them same angels that
[57:47] driving them out trying to get man back
[57:49] to the tree of life
[57:51] mundus found his way back
[57:53] oh hallelujah
[57:55] and i hope
[57:56] that you could find your way back
[57:58] because time is running out
[58:01] hallelujah
[58:02] glory to god time is running out
[58:05] so despite all the making of money
[58:07] houses land
[58:09] degrees
[58:10] doctorate professorship
[58:12] ceo
[58:14] in charge of chairman beside all of that
[58:16] the wages of sin
[58:18] is still dead
[58:19] time will run out on your beauty on your
[58:22] looks you're always you're standing from
[58:23] the mirror on your strength as a youth
[58:26] time around that
[58:28] and it's such a deception that people
[58:30] don't see 40 years from now
[58:32] they see where they are now and they
[58:33] look day to day but the other 40 years
[58:35] if gotarius come in or 60
[58:38] where would you be
[58:39] time runs out
[58:41] so therefore
[58:43] all your achievement comes to nothing
[58:45] without christ
[58:47] let me say it again
[58:49] you get a piece of land because you're
[58:50] never talking about the land you have
[58:51] now
[58:52] nothing
[58:53] without christ
[58:55] hallelujah
[58:57] you can't make a way for yourself
[59:00] because you can't make your own
[59:01] sacrifice
[59:03] when man fell man can say you know what
[59:06] i feel i'll go take it this way and i'll
[59:07] go back soon i'll go back soon no no no
[59:09] there has to be a way back
[59:11] and only god himself could provide that
[59:13] way
[59:14] and god provided a way by letting the
[59:16] lamb died
[59:17] letting sacrifices died it was debt for
[59:20] death
[59:21] death for death
[59:23] so lambs and goats and bullocks was
[59:26] dying year and year old for as a cost
[59:29] as a price to know that it takes a price
[59:31] to pay to get back
[59:33] when jesus came he was god's perfect
[59:35] lamb
[59:36] and this easter
[59:38] on calvary when that lamb died he made a
[59:41] blood way
[59:42] that we could get back
[59:44] regardless of what you have done
[59:46] how far you have gone how deep you have
[59:49] sinned he has made our way back
[59:52] by his blood
[59:53] that's the only thing he could accept
[59:55] he can't accept you're too early mary
[59:56] entry or father he can't accept your
[59:58] burner can't land but turn up benefit
[1:00:00] upside down or whatever it is you can't
[1:00:02] accept what you think because there's a
[1:00:04] way to seem right unto a man
[1:00:05] and the end thereof is dead
[1:00:08] there's a way back
[1:00:09] you have to find that way back and god
[1:00:11] is the word and he has made a way for
[1:00:14] you to get back and i trust you children
[1:00:16] here today if you're not right with god
[1:00:18] that you will get right with god
[1:00:20] if you're not where is supposed to be
[1:00:21] you will get back to where you're
[1:00:22] supposed to be because time is running
[1:00:24] out
[1:00:25] if you have to meet him you have to go
[1:00:27] through the same way he went he went by
[1:00:29] the way of the word
[1:00:30] he went by the way of god
[1:00:32] we have our own way we have our own way
[1:00:33] thinking but whatever is doing we are
[1:00:35] thinking
[1:00:35] you see the child in israel they didn't
[1:00:37] know that god
[1:00:38] for 400 years there was in bandage oh
[1:00:40] god deliver me oh god deliver me oh god
[1:00:41] deliver me isn't that some people know
[1:00:43] oh god deliver me god deliver me god
[1:00:45] sent moses as his deliverer
[1:00:48] moses was smack enough to ask god who
[1:00:50] shall i say send me quack yeah say i
[1:00:52] bring myself i said myself i'm also
[1:00:54] gonna zone into petition god says tell
[1:00:56] them i am sent to you
[1:00:58] moses went down there and preached to
[1:00:59] two million people
[1:01:00] bring them out
[1:01:02] you know what
[1:01:03] they perished
[1:01:05] two million people called out perished
[1:01:08] and only two million
[1:01:10] and when they told jesus our father eat
[1:01:12] man in the wilderness jesus said and
[1:01:14] they're everyone dead
[1:01:16] he wasn't talking about first dating
[1:01:19] he was talking about people that cannot
[1:01:21] go back into the light of god hallelujah
[1:01:25] the second that is something to fear
[1:01:28] and to think about
[1:01:30] oh hallelujah
[1:01:32] the everyone dead
[1:01:34] you cannot make your own way back to god
[1:01:37] you have to come god's provided way
[1:01:40] and jesus is god's provided way
[1:01:43] not catholic not baptist not methodist
[1:01:44] not what you think and your mother and
[1:01:46] your father you have to find out what is
[1:01:47] the provided way
[1:01:49] that is what brother mundus discovered
[1:01:52] it lit up his soul
[1:01:54] let me say that it lit up his soul not
[1:01:56] his head his soul
[1:01:58] so he was committed not the church but
[1:02:00] the god
[1:02:01] and to god's people
[1:02:03] there is always something to do that was
[1:02:06] his mantra all around the church
[1:02:07] building i remember when he was
[1:02:09] plastering as we said before the plastic
[1:02:11] could even finish dry he was painting
[1:02:13] washington
[1:02:14] as you're plastering the paintbrush
[1:02:16] coming behind you
[1:02:17] there was always something to do a
[1:02:20] passion for god
[1:02:21] a passion for the house of god a passion
[1:02:24] for the people of god and i trust that
[1:02:26] something light you up today
[1:02:28] to want to be like that
[1:02:30] everybody doing their own thing you know
[1:02:32] but the christians have to do their own
[1:02:33] thing too for god
[1:02:35] i trust that you become god's billboard
[1:02:37] and shine you don't light a candle and
[1:02:39] hide it your light i cannot put it on
[1:02:41] top that it could give out light to the
[1:02:43] world
[1:02:44] this world is going to the darkness
[1:02:46] gross darkness cover the earth gross
[1:02:48] darkness cover the people but there's no
[1:02:50] people gonna have light
[1:02:52] and they've got people who have shine
[1:02:53] they're gonna shine his death must not
[1:02:55] be in vain you were here because of him
[1:02:58] god sent you here there are words that
[1:03:00] god gave that you must hear
[1:03:02] before time runs out
[1:03:05] hallelujah
[1:03:06] oh glory to god
[1:03:09] the time allotted on earth to do his
[1:03:11] will
[1:03:13] everything is written time
[1:03:15] time
[1:03:16] that is what people don't cater for
[1:03:19] so you see somebody strong and healthy
[1:03:20] and they're cussing on the arrogant and
[1:03:22] they don't care and after time you see
[1:03:24] them walking
[1:03:25] and they can't say nothing
[1:03:28] all the aragon's gone because time
[1:03:30] bring a whole different change around
[1:03:32] their life
[1:03:34] you can't change what is happening
[1:03:35] around you
[1:03:36] but you can change what's happening with
[1:03:37] you
[1:03:39] you can change your circumstances
[1:03:40] sometimes the winds blow contrary
[1:03:42] who expected this nobody looking for
[1:03:45] this
[1:03:45] when we get married and we stand at the
[1:03:47] altar till death do us part
[1:03:49] we will part but let that do it
[1:03:53] this is how it's supposed to be
[1:03:56] he has gone on hallelujah oh praise the
[1:04:00] lord
[1:04:01] the unfolding of time
[1:04:03] what time reveals and what time unfolds
[1:04:05] you don't own time i could do this next
[1:04:08] week i was here i would get this i'll
[1:04:10] deal with you
[1:04:12] and before you deal with that person god
[1:04:13] deal with you
[1:04:15] you don't own time
[1:04:17] the clock is ticking
[1:04:19] seconds turn to hours hours turns to
[1:04:21] days
[1:04:22] days turns to weeks weeks
[1:04:25] the months month into years the clock is
[1:04:26] ticking
[1:04:28] i have a scripted read from psalms 90
[1:04:31] is a scripture that moves me for we are
[1:04:34] consumed by their anger
[1:04:36] and by thy wrath are we troubled our set
[1:04:38] of iniquities before thee our secret
[1:04:41] sins in the light of thy countenance
[1:04:44] for all our days are passed away in iraq
[1:04:47] we spend our years as a tale
[1:04:50] that is told the days of our years
[1:04:52] are 3 score and ten and if by reason of
[1:04:54] strength
[1:04:55] there'll be four score years yes it's
[1:04:56] their strength labor and sorrow it is
[1:04:58] soon cut off
[1:05:00] we fly away
[1:05:01] who know at the power of nine anger even
[1:05:03] according to thy fear so is that iraq so
[1:05:06] teach us to number our days that we
[1:05:08] might apply
[1:05:10] our hearts onto wisdom
[1:05:13] when times runs out to repent
[1:05:17] time runs out to make things right
[1:05:20] if you had something to tell him
[1:05:23] time run out you can't tell him now
[1:05:26] the people around you that you should
[1:05:28] love and cherish cherish them
[1:05:31] love them
[1:05:33] if you wanted to tell them daddy i love
[1:05:34] you you can't do that now you should
[1:05:36] have done that when he was alive
[1:05:39] if your thing said make right with him
[1:05:40] you couldn't can't do it now
[1:05:43] you have to done that done when he's
[1:05:44] alive
[1:05:46] the people are wrong you that's why
[1:05:47] jesus said if you can't love people who
[1:05:49] you see oh you could love god you can't
[1:05:51] see
[1:05:52] that's why jesus said
[1:05:54] by this shall all men know that you're
[1:05:55] my disciples not when you could talk
[1:05:58] would
[1:05:58] but when you could have love and express
[1:06:00] it and show it one to one another
[1:06:04] when time runs out to make decisions
[1:06:07] time runs out
[1:06:08] to give up stuff to change your attitude
[1:06:12] my god time runs out
[1:06:14] we spend our life
[1:06:16] our years is a tale that is told
[1:06:21] but a monday's book is now closed
[1:06:24] when this book first opened
[1:06:26] like a child is born
[1:06:28] and as the days go by
[1:06:30] the pages keep turning
[1:06:32] some of you in the beginning of your
[1:06:34] book
[1:06:35] some of you in the middle of the book
[1:06:38] some of you past middle
[1:06:40] but the pages
[1:06:42] are turning
[1:06:43] we spend all years the teal that is told
[1:06:47] some of us get anxious we want to get to
[1:06:49] the destination
[1:06:51] but pause a little bit and enjoy the
[1:06:52] journey
[1:06:53] there's time
[1:06:55] unfolds character and life
[1:06:57] every day
[1:06:59] whether it costs you smoke your drink
[1:07:00] the pages
[1:07:02] are turning
[1:07:03] every day you have a time to repent to
[1:07:05] say lord i want to serve you i want to
[1:07:06] change my life i want to change my ways
[1:07:08] because your purpose i know it is not to
[1:07:10] have cars and house and money and land
[1:07:12] and water your personally just with god
[1:07:15] because money and land god give you just
[1:07:16] even better
[1:07:18] not not to save him
[1:07:19] to save him better
[1:07:21] hallelujah
[1:07:22] whether you serve him or not your page
[1:07:24] is turning
[1:07:25] whether you love him or not your
[1:07:26] servant's speech is turning whether the
[1:07:28] treasure or not the page is still
[1:07:29] turning
[1:07:30] and one day
[1:07:31] comes the very end
[1:07:33] you don't know when that day could be
[1:07:34] because you said bong juice you cannot
[1:07:35] pass

[1:07:54] he was only seeing the money he wasn't
[1:07:55] seeing the box he said didn't think
[1:07:56] about that sir
[1:07:59] it's what you want to look at
[1:08:00] devil give her
[1:08:02] a illusion when you get this you'll be
[1:08:04] happy when you get that you'll be happy
[1:08:06] when i get a wife then you want to get
[1:08:08] rid of the wife you got to get a husband

[1:08:17] you find a better house and never keep
[1:08:19] shifting the posts of happiness because
[1:08:21] happiness doesn't consist of what a man
[1:08:23] possess
[1:08:24] happiness have to be inside of you
[1:08:27] that's what mundus had
[1:08:28] something on the inside
[1:08:30] do you have that in the inside if you
[1:08:32] don't have it any inside wouldn't be
[1:08:33] satisfied as i'm talking time is running
[1:08:35] out
[1:08:36] time run out on me
[1:08:38] to give this sermon
[1:08:40] time is running on you
[1:08:42] to be here
[1:08:44] time is one day the last page is going
[1:08:46] to be close
[1:08:48] book is close
[1:08:50] work is done purpose is finished and
[1:08:53] accomplished
[1:08:55] when time runs out
[1:08:58] hallelujah
[1:08:59] god was very patient with israel
[1:09:02] he knew they
[1:09:03] they only know egypt
[1:09:04] they know the culture of egypt they
[1:09:06] don't know god
[1:09:07] he told moses bring them to this
[1:09:08] mountain
[1:09:09] that i could reveal to them my laws my
[1:09:11] words my truth
[1:09:13] they came out in the wilderness and the
[1:09:14] bible said there was a shorter way but
[1:09:16] god said unto the wildernesses to hope
[1:09:19] that egypt would fall off at him
[1:09:21] because he could take man out of the
[1:09:22] water but is there the water inside of
[1:09:24] him
[1:09:25] so in other words
[1:09:26] they came out but egypt was still in
[1:09:28] them
[1:09:31] that's the problem today
[1:09:33] people coming out but they haven't gone
[1:09:34] in
[1:09:35] it's too past not only must you come out
[1:09:38] but you have to go in
[1:09:40] we are not we're talking about our life
[1:09:42] being changed
[1:09:43] our life being transformed
[1:09:46] my
[1:09:47] hallelujah
[1:09:49] want to read this again and i saw the
[1:09:50] dead small and great
[1:09:52] so when you're dead he had done yet yet
[1:09:56] there's another level that's coming
[1:09:59] all them who escape the police
[1:10:01] all them people who kill and what that
[1:10:02] and nobody catches them and they're
[1:10:03] going down them coming up to him
[1:10:06] every man coming back evil men wicked
[1:10:09] men everybody gonna rise
[1:10:11] and be judged
[1:10:13] therefore you have an opportunity now to
[1:10:15] change your thinking
[1:10:17] to change your ways
[1:10:18] to change your very life
[1:10:21] friends i want to invite you
[1:10:23] for this change
[1:10:25] for this transformation
[1:10:27] this is the way of all flesh
[1:10:29] when man fell god kept his word
[1:10:31] he escaped he keeps his word of
[1:10:32] blessings and he keeps his words of kiss
[1:10:35] also
[1:10:36] the day you eat that day you die that is
[1:10:38] why we have this today
[1:10:39] the wages of sin
[1:10:41] is still there
[1:10:42] so this time i want to
