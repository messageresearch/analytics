very living word itself father be among us in the second homage said every captive free middle minds become clear the understanding opened the hearts open to receive Christ the one living word granted father in GSM we ask it amen anima before you have your seats we want to go into the scriptures praise name of the Lord one a recent John one was one on 14 second Corinthians tree one two six and second Peter one two two seven god bless you and welcome greetings in Jesus precious name greetings all those connected us in the Internet god bless you and welcome sin John 1:1 and verse 14 second Corinthians 3:1 to 6 and second Peter 1:2 to 7 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god for his 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of his only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth second Corinthians this one do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we are some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of combination from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the Spirit of the Living God not in the tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart and trust that we have true Christ to God what not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who had made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit and give it life I read in second Peter reading from for his to grace and peace be multiplied unto you should a knowledge of our Lord of God and our Jesus our Lord according as his divine power I'd give mine to us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby give them unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by D's amaravati cos of the divine nature having escaped the corruption thus is in the world through lust and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity may God bless his word you may be seated praise the Lord Amen god bless you once again and I want to tongue by the Isaac umber Antony for minister in the last couple of services we certainly appreciate that and last Sunday was a tremendous blessing to may be partakers of the divine nature His divine nature you invited to be a partaker of his divine nature that was nothing but the word but Isaac that was the absolute Word of God when I first come to this message I always believed that anybody could crack the pyramid that's gonna be it the secret was told to get inside idea it was always a secret because the pyramid is was bible there are three Bibles you know that right one under stars do react and the second was what the pyramid and the third was this violet we have but a pyramid as a mystery inside a deer isn't that right anyhow we want to get into the word I trust the Lord blesses us bless the wood today and a lickin forgot to confirm his word their hearts and in your lies you love him this morning it's always a privilege to comment to the hosts of y'all don't take it for granted take it as a privilege you will always have this privilege so the title I have this morning is the Living Word the Word made flesh the Living Word the Word made flesh I love the songs this morning lord I want to be a Christian in my heart more love more power isn't that right we have to get there it will take love to enter inside idea let's go this week President Putin made another major announcement to his Parliament or whatever it is and he claims that Russia now has an invincible nuclear weapon that can strike any part of the world that cannot be intercepted and he gave an animation on it on the screen of a video showing Russian warheads speeding towards Florida and missiles outmaneuvering obstacles in the southern Atlantic Russia has a new class of weapons President Putin said on Thursday that could make America defenses obsolete listen to what this prophet said in the uncertain song we live in a day of uncertainty we live in the day when there's everything almost that we can put our hands on natural is unseated there's so much uncertainty til the nations are quaking there is uncertainty in our national security there is no nation safe anymore we could either be the victims to Russia by midnight tonight or either be in bits it depends upon what Russia wants to do about it we are talking about our scientists they are men that they can put 200 miles in the air in a little machine that come right over and sitting right on top of this nation I send a message down and said either surrender we pull the lever that's all of it they don't have to wait till tomorrow to do it they can do it right now so put it this way the things are set I think they call this bomb that they have Seaton - I don't know if you know the first one that they had that can reach America and so on Collette's it and one so this is season two they have right now and it's it's fixed the prophecies are dear and that's why the Prophet said we are striving to enter into the kingdom of God before the plague strike a lot of foolishness would disappear as the pressure comes on as the Bible speaks of a time of trouble such as never was since there was a beginning of times but they're gonna be here isn't that right so we want to make sure that we put our best into the service of the Lord to receive what he has from us because when in one place that can strike and that's the word only one place that cannot strike and that's the Word of God there is no hidin place hallelujah can't say gone to this nation or this country there is no item please but yeah yes Christ is that vehicle to take you out of here amen so are you ready for the word this morning amen but a man a man Jubilee a say for this world as we see this morning has to be fulfilled it is God's thoughts made manifest by His Word and brought to a reality now in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word was the beginning but before it was a word the word is a thought made manifest before you speak your thing is not right so God had to think it before he could make it a word and when he spoke it the word it materialized so you go from thought to word to material Isaiah 51 55 11 so my world that God father of my mouth it shall not return to me void but it shall accomplish that which I please it shall prosper in the things that I sent it so God would can't feel we know that once God said it it has to come to pass because it comes from his thinking his thoughts and if God spoke about your deliverance your breakthrough whatever it is that can feel he himself can't even cancel it or glory to God because it's mouse pocket it can't come back empty your deliverance cannot come back empty your healing can come back and your freedom your victory can come back because it come out the mouth of God not the mark of man mother man will fail but once the motive God speaks it or glory to God hallelujah not man's word he said my word shall return to me void Oh hallelujah so called after sin is word in this hour to call out the people his name's Jacob Ryan isn't that right so in the beginning was the word the Word was with God or because in the beginning was L o him under waters me that him isn't that right and it's the same thing just unfolding like the attribute is your thought and Gordon the beginni Turner he wasn't even God he was eternal he wasn't even God because he was eternal he was Elohim the self existent one isn't that right and then he was worshiped and then he became God after creates any Angels he wasn't even that he was LM eternal but in him was thoughts here we go that he wanted to become material he wanted to become sail out material Oh glory to God he had sons locked up in him he had parts locked up in him and he wanted to become material and the Bible said and the word became flesh and dwelt among us so the thought comes from thought the word then the word become flesh and when the word become flesh its material so Jesus wasn't just flesh he was the word made flesh that's what you want to be Oh glory to God you are gonna be the living world the word itself made flesh Oh glory to God until all this was a message riding me for a while and I will tie right into what but Isaac spoke last service in particles of this vinager so let's go he was even that he was Elohim be Turner but her name was thoughts he wanted to become material and what did he do he spoke a word and the word was materialized dönitz here we go that's the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation it's nothing wrong it is Elohim materializing so he can be touched so he can be felt so foodcourt was above us in the Fatherhood God was with us in the son Jesus Christ and God promised to come into you he always wanted a dwelling man he always wanted you to be his house to be a soccer and he's one of our people that he gonna live in Oh glory to God are you are you ready this morning oh this is how good men you this morning now this is a full seven-course menu this is that soup it's a little more than that this morning hallelujah praise God praise God are you ready and then then he said in the Millennium there will be LM sitting on the throne that's right with all his subjects i wronged him that he predestinated before the function of the world from things that up ought to be your bullet here was pre-planned shot on that one don't tell me or what the ones that bought you and you're coming if I didn't want you and your mother than want you and it was a mistake forget that yeah what you're good here was pre-planned when that sperm hit that egg listen is a million and ton load as firms and that's one egg and you as among all of them some felts or some corn so some missile some jump over so but court pre-plan your birth on this earth he won't mistake he will not here by chance you not even a little service by chance get the Lord a shout in the hope your birth was pre-planned missus it every one of you knows that our borders we plan did you know that your being here never originated as a myth or thought everything was or pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you would be here the inside night God knows and to be infinite you know every free will be on the earth you know much time in the batter's eye that's infinite our phantom mind our our finite minds cannot fathom it and if we know the Word of God we know where we are living we know the are we live in and we know what lays ahead we see what we have past the book of God is the revelation of Jesus Christ his work through the ages that was up to the book of Revelation then his promises that is to come so all of his promises are true give the Lord a shelter not all of his promises are true and God cannot speak anywhere without a being confirmed every word that he says has to come to pass and the Bible said all that pollinate shall worship the Beast except those whose names written before the foundation of the world so you have to know this morning that God put your name in the blood section Lamb's Book of Life before the phone tip that's why if the shop this morning that's why not because your bills not because the roof came in not because you can't break down but because your name is on the book jesus calling disciples don't rejoice because the devil is subject to you but rejoice because your name is written glory go-gurt give the Lord a shock you have no husband rejoice you have no wife rejoice you have no children rejoice Prince plug it on that job you have to rejoice they don't wanna give me your pistol rejoice the only choice is a hole and come money don't forget that Lauri the godly choice because your name is written you're not my boyfriend rejoice then other children rejoice in the Lord some shows giving some praises he is really glory of God hallelujah [Applause] let me see that let this Tabernacle be filled with praises the Bible said in praising the Rahsaan the rejoicing isn't a time lock of the righteous you're coming with like none of you have a witness and then longer stay here and here no you got to be participating this is your service this is your worship this is your God be talking about Oh glory to god this is your expectation this is your revival you are bringing it you as per in it although you are wanting adds you after he has any atmosphere that the Holy Ones can come down you are doing there maybe season so here the predestinated planet playing view just as other seed the Word of God is a seed must have good grown prepared beforehand if you saw a seed enjoyed all day on the ground we're doing a good the bush will pick it up you chew it among tissues and torture but choking or pretty soon and Jesus parable said so how are you here we go so the ground has to be made ready first are you ready so God in sovereign grace prepares the heart first and he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him and this age he foreknew you and buyers for knowledge and or Dean you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you I was prepared for Zee battle since before the foundation of the world that's why I'm fightin heat of thought Wesley for and you not gonna sit there and stare you want to fight for the kingdom of God suffer violence and the violent take it by force the kingdom is preached and every man every or you push him back to me this morning or give the Lord a praise offering gory glory no decision [Applause] God saw every one of your sins every one of your failures every one of the shortcomings have you one of the character flaws and he still predestinate you and put your name on the book you know what you're gonna do next week no other next year you know all what already done but he still put your name justifier come on now I feel like I feel that run who got justified no man could condemn or give the Lord a shout in the home [Applause] Oh [Music] dueling a church man you don't know pastor ban you don't know bishop but don't let a man die on you you are free pull the son of man set free free indeed oh you know God this is fire on the word this is your notion of the word we are saying what the tapes say we are preaching the revelation of the Son of Man you may be seated who you think was villain that prophet what were stated income of this amount if you know in other words what Spirit spoken words that's what we can't just bring our own thoughts and ideas it has to be in spirit spoken words because I know that's why I know if I stay with this world don't know bless me I want God blessed no man could curse victory up on the donkeys could bread but they can take the blessing that what has new stuff upon your life the sea stay with the world or glory to God let the dogs back but this time I'm moving on let the dogs back but we're moving on never a rapture to go to yellow red and suffer to attend the Millennium we have a wedding supper or killer louisvil rapture come on now Oh hallelujah we have something to be excited about oh you know God by Jesus let's continue from spirit of truth I might not call her the names that books is too much that's like one tip I'll give it respect is the plate tip and we to be pleased players up tips like if like if God or Dena's to be T players not me I'm safer preacher you're positive about the priests who want to play by the bottom delicious that's fine we played - but that's not it : no this is what we have to do I would like to tell you how much books I have to cover to get what I'm prettier today right now I bought about how about six already alright let's continue one of the great problems for God don't chew the years as the history of the church goes is to find somebody that he can completely get in his control everybody wanna be somebody but not somebody for God because God somebody is mash up men broke men quad Mendes mistreat and what does break them you know you have to break them to make them because gonna leave them they were act just like mangas with the greed and the selfishness and the politics that is man as in a chairman you remove one crop his next one is that of cookies alone end up crooked because that doesn't mean the heart of money is desperately wicked spider who can know it but God so that's why God said give me I'll give you a new heart you need a new one let's let's take a chance for give me your old one give you a new heart I'll give you our new spirit and I'll put my spirit into your spirit cause you connect with my word okay the Lord has showed in the house so the issue has always been a man surrendered to God Jesse people want supernatural and signs and wonders and clarifying lights and so on they want God to come down and so on to say I am right and all others is wrong and God is not on that God not I'm trying to vindicate a church or a man he's here about vindicating his word if I die in the morning the word is still true if I die in the morning the promise is correct this word will be confirmed oh give the Lord a Shh all right he know what he needs one man he always used one man at a time we started a few nights another group you just want one that's all he needs cause two men have two different ideas he just takes one man and what he just makes one man he represent himself true that one person never did he do it otherwise and he's got one person today and that person is the one we just read after the Holy Spirit that will send me a man here one person that is the Holy Spirit he is the person that God has sent forth the spirit of Jesus Christ into the earth the Spirit of God the manifest and declare Christ to his church just to continue his life to the church he Christ was the Living Word of God yes why because he was expressing God to himself he was soul completely surrendered to the word till he and the world was the same and that's exactly what the church ought to be today that the Word of God is the same what is he saying we have to become the very Living Word of God itself isn't that right so therefore you have a choice today to receive the word inwardly and willingly as opposed to be ultimately informally you have a choice to receive the word as from God or if it was a man trying a little thing was a man trying something well he trying something but if it's a word of God you have to receive it in early and willingly because they receive the word you become the word itself so butter Branham was brain father beat angry that I would I would his truth we tangley for the Holy Spirit who is the Living Word here tonight to manifest any divine blessings that God Almighty has promised and now Lord Jesus to see that you were conceived here and is lit by the Holy Spirit and he wrapped himself in a blood cell broke the cell open Calvary no man takes his life he lead on his life freely and the blood cell was broken here we go because the Spirit could be made free from the blood coming into the body again come into the blood it was given and his body came water blood and spirit just like a natural bird water blood and spirit and I pray tonight if there's someone here who has never come into the body of Christ watch now to become a full believer sealed unrecognized by the Father God that distributor right night that they will receive it granted Lord to thy mercy we ask oh praise God so the true call of God is the broken blood cell of Christ that released the Spirit of God to pull you into the body and by one Spirit we are baptized into that body not into a church in a church a fellowship but that spirit pulls you into the body of Christ where you are placed into the body of Christ so he Christ was deity himself made flesh on earth the manifest is love to the people under take away sin of the earth he came here in order that he could anchor depth in his own body because that was the curse the day you eat there after day you die so death was the curse upon the earth so he came to anchor death like a stinger he came to pull debt and unlatch it in his body that I posit that where is your sting grave Reza victory because Jesus come on Britney curse of death that we'd have to fear death no more but we could free that's why I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly Oh give the Lord some praise as people listen listen he came here in order to anchor death in his own body you can anchor sickness in his own body or glory to God the curse that ought to have been on you he took it upon himself I like to die like a man in order to redeem you back in the full fellowship with the father full fellowship Oh glory to God that's the power of love that's the power of redemption for God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life what praising him on the Lord my god what a marvelous thing our hearts can't conceive what a thing that was

thing the scripture is fulfilled in my life a little glory the gone that's why as always is always great to pray about the service I'm pre incoming the service and pray and have an expectation that you could have an expectation and come into church Simeon had a expectation because it does reveal to him he wouldn't see debt until he lost Christ man old man Simeon every death angel every depth that be homie death buzzing wrong and he's all I got buzz what I want unify my Messiah or like a bee sting a decade buzz he say oh like a touched me a little watch me hallelujah one is I'm that injured coming for dinner dangling dangling tsun tsun tsun tsun tsun he's not not not yet other city crisis hallelujah the by him give a rocking chair to stay home he said thank you rocking chair but

your revolution every Silver City on this year because you know one day Messiah have to come to that temple or glory they got every time they have Sabbat hundreds and hundreds little baby is coming

lead you wrong the spirit I'll lead you where's grace I'll keep you hope give the Lord a shout the spirit kind of lead you wrong Oh glory to God amen Oh glory the gun so the word have to come into your flesh on your feet and then it becomes life and then you become a living example then you are a pistol of God read by all men Oh glory to God using them disciples and the early days our Bibles the bad was even written yet the New Testament was written yet and then Old Testament was big long screws so they can't walk along with a coat I'm big screws wrong and rule in prophecy no they were the living wood itself when the speak was the word it was the Word made flesh Oh hallelujah Oh glory to God you believe that Thank You Laura so the mind in Christ you take the word just like he did because he was the word and the man of Christ in you you are the world you are the gods live in word representatives of him here on the earth continuing to work the church should be that way so the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of the disciples they had no scripture what they were preaching what Scripture because they were the Living Word and we'll come back to that you know after court knowledge yes they'll come on all we do after question or we will be decodes be caught made flesh or chlorine a continuation of the Living Word or glory Christ veiled in Tabernacles walking on two feet in Trinidad you may see that yet but it was happened or glory the god holy well recognize Christ you're gonna walk like him you're gonna talk like him they're gonna live like him you're gonna love like him you're gonna forgive like him they're gonna he like him you're gonna act like him that's how you know Christ oh no I'm not all that good samanya no it happened here - I'm not talking more than miss Teresa my hello so he was Hitler and find like a blast in ministries no it's not a blast in this region is the emphasis and mysteries with other life that is that is a challenge to me because if it is mysteries then the most mysterious be sure he has the habit it's just that Paul already handled that by say do you know all mysteries and have all knowledge and don't have charity you're still back to square one you just like a man you a token of mysteries say talking Greek a cocking lactating you're talking what kinda thing and people head just drizzle all the know the nutrition and as a you know as a mighty man because he could talk mighty and you had to in staff that was what we're getting service I was I was blessed you click you see what we shot last week you put a pig in a cage you putting on a legalism you lock him up you take much TP be be quiet he lock up in the cage and here on a truck going to the slaughter they pick just didn't make any noise now but loosen it first mud poorly season it he said this is mines this is what I'm claiming because he's a pig he do have a lamb nature the pig goes back to the matted because he's bound by legalism and that is why some people love legalistic preachers because keep them in a kid's left turn and they love that commanders the on yourself to domina that's why people like communism they control yourself so they want a man to control them you see the God's law is internal man's law is external that's right now jail and prison for people can behave yourself lock up arrest two in jail judge thanks for the people that cabbie deserve but really and truly God wanted law to be internal but you know how to behave yourself that's what the cost become to bring about behavior because your behavior is what set you to adoption it's not just son is the right kind of a son so we never got much Sun nor was the right kind and I'm all kind of son Rascals son ropes son Rennie good son but what one day right pain they're all kind of ministers men that not called halfway called when I'm talking to my name cut it off but they're doing this stuff on a hot in fact they reckon Hyundai destroy it Paul in Paul is port of call seven enemies of the cross he said but one thing I rejoiced is a crisis preached it says the enemies is there are contrary people the enemies of the cross is about his consolation that Christ is preached at least at least something about Christ but them as well practice dogs and already call them real characters but this is the gospel and we have the same thing no so watch there we go I already so Christ the Bible is manifested again like an Aries of Christ cause are you ready you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was you know heard what we said before your heart is prepared you're built has been pre-planned and not you are here that you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was and when the rain falls under seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit falls so forget about her in the rain coming there is another issue is if you have the seed because the life will produce itself when the rain falls or give the Lord a shout so the most important thing is for you to receive see them on top of word on top of word what seed promises by these promises you become a partaker of God's divine nature by what by promises supported random came to introduce us to precious promises I promise you this I promise you that I promise you the Holy Ghost I promise I promise I promise I promise that's what you're receiving you under promise your child of the kingdom your child a promise just think those guys in Egypt okay God made a promise to bring them out into our landfill Millican honey it's not right praise God I'll and fluid milk and honey nice actually a son with me really powerful why milk and honey milk come from a cow honey come from birds and birds and from from bees and birds and bees need flowers and everything else so he was actually saying that land would be prosperous with vegetation with animals with flux on everything every prosperous milk and honey gonna be dear no listen didn't acts for the promise honor God keep the promise come on now they didn't ask so the promise God released the promise I'm gonna bring you bless you milk and honey Oh glory to God amen this struggle to the wilderness the struggle the struggle the struggle the struggle until the kinder knish mania he tell the ministers listen thick 12 mins spies and spy on a line and come back and bring a report to the people that they will know I am true I am faithful I am honest I'm genuine about my promises ten men come back to lead to other brothers say about behind just one killer 10 men come as early and Ibaka Evo report what was the evil report listen the land is a good land but we can't take it because we saw giants somebody after the giant sea you know they didn't see us but we sure saw them and they bigger than you think and that brought our dread over the whole camp and stunt their faith in God Caleb and Joshua came back late I went to meet the camp and depression no praise and worship everybody mumbling and grumbling and shoo-shoo on his side and everybody went dark lose like in the morning I'm Caleb and Joshua them in the spirit now with grape juice or and all the clothes working wet and soup down with grape juice from the land up was flew in with all them star and by Ramsey kill about the shortest man and who'll camp he got on a box and said we are well able night love hawk waters do this stuff you know they talk about giants and he showed this man come and salmon a bokken say we well over let us go up up wants to take this life and I could imagine I can imagine it can boil but look at shorty I can imagine it come same of who we think he is he has Giants I can say let's go up at once wherever they take the doctors feet you think he didn't see Giants through caleb sorry chance to but he was hearing from the Giants he was hearing what God said and when you hear what God said Giants don't intimidate you for every Goliath there is a stone or get the Lord a shell or a are you here with me for every goal I there is a stone and when you understand what God said that coordinate of man that would lie you not gonna be intimidated by any child hallelujah so you are predestinated seed just like Christ was say after me I am a predestinated seed say it again I am a predestinated seed that's who you are Oh glory to God a predestinated seat that's right the delicateness of you while you were drinking smoking running around you still had to come because Jesus at all that the father had given me he'll come or give the Lord a show get the Lord up praise stop condemning yourself stop condemning yourself God told you the devil is a liar but glory to God every seat at the comfort [Music] you are predestinated seed just like Christ was and when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit falls what did Jesus tell them in acts 1:8 you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you power for what but what to pray for us to live a holy life power to overcome power to forgive power to repent power to pass the battle hallelujah praise God did token what power after the Holy Ghost what you supposed to be looking for the Holy Ghost that's your promise so when I fell on those seeds that he chose when before the foundation of the world they were predestined I see Peter who denied him three times we told us he was predestinated I wanted to bring it real to you Peter who denied I don't know him I don't know I don't even know simple yeah you ain't Church no no no not not me wrong man when he's not a closer deny him maybe not he because Kristen Lucas then Peter wept I am saying to you he was a predestinated see this is the part I wanna get to this emotional seed here disciples 120 this Harlem says opening up room these seeds the word and the word was laying on dear without life in it when there were any upper room they were the word without life waiting for the Holy Ghost waiting for dynamics waiting for the power but they were the word because Luke 24 Jesus opening understanding to the scripture and open the word to them they knew who they were oh they were predestinated seeds there was sons of God original seeds ship you taught of God let's continue let's continue and the world was laying there without life in it and all of a sudden they came from a song from heaven as the waters began to gush down and it actually fell all the house where they were sitting and the seeds begin to grow to begin to manifest itself the Word of God being made manifest in other words join to was an effect what the joy says shall come to pass that I poured my spirit upon all flesh young men shall see visions all men shall dream dreams that was a prophecy from joy or glory to God Isaiah 28 with stammering lips and other tongues that speak to these people so Jesus seasoned on with these promises so when the spirit fall it was fallen in connection to the prophecy of joy as I believe that's right Peter came and said this is that that the Prophet Joel because before I become materialized it has to be spoken or glory of God and before it is spoken it's got to be the thoughts of God or give the Lord a show so the thoughts of God drop down prophesy angel prophesy my sire and there goes the Upper Room [Applause] what about you and I this morning halleluyah halleluyah my my my it began to manifest itself the would have got being manifested you see there's no profit you see now why I have been so jealous of the kind of seed that I planted for the body what what did we sew back on now what if we sow confusion what we if we show again some other judgments about you that is in other words we can gain stolen dropping on this one that doesn't give us adoption Lord revealed to me years ago a crashing somebody doesn't put you up so i beat up this one and be that one that doesn't put you up bless people honor people oh yes inspire people save them it love them isn't that right watch you see why I've been so zealous of the kind of seed I planned for the body the rain is going to fall pretty soon now I mean the real rain and it's got to have C to fall on he's I hope I live to see it well God didn't allow him to live to see it but we gonna see it when the real rain fall on DC's here fallen faith and virtue and knowledge on temperance all these laying inside of you right now right now a pyramid has been built inside of you it's the word inside of your pyramid is already inside of you or glory to God and seed form or glory arena have to fall on that green have to fall on that green have to fall on that Jesus was God's seed and he had to wait for the rain and he was going down to John to be baptized and when he birthed baptized the dove the ring the power the dynamics in the fullness come upon Jesus and he become the anointed son this is my beloved son this is Jesus no carpenter's son as it was doing carpentry this is Jesus it hears a silence from age 12 to 30 this the same Jesus everybody seen making door and making cupboard and make whatever it is the capital isn't that right with this carpenter walking down to the Jordan River John the baptizing and got jumped was told the one who you see the Deaf come down and remain so if somebody'd of hit and fly off you know like anyone because maybe somehow they don't get them and fight off but this one the dog have to remain that's the one so when Jesus came even who he was but when he saw that does he know that's the Messiah he said you should baptize me she said that might be so but we have to fulfill all righteousness wash this land brother or glory the club because Islam is about to be crucified Oh glory to God and John baptized him and Jesus let by the spirit let by the spirit into the wilderness to overcome the lust of the eyes to overcome the lust of the flesh to overcome the pride of life to overcome the attacks of the devil and all he did was to say this written what was he saying that for for you for me it is written because it has to be spoken for it to be written and once it is written that word cannot be defeated the world will defeat the devil anywhere anytime anyplace under any condition that's the word or give the Lord a shout Jesus defeated the devil not by powerful by the way [Applause] unknown we could tell the devil it is written I'm gonna be fill it as written I'm a predestinated see that is written I'm an attribute thought of what it is written my mouth was pre-planned it is written my half have been repaired pre-prepared to receive this word it is Ricky Oh glory to God I be healed I strike I was healed I'm already here I'm walking into my healing i walking into my deliverance that's why I'm gonna praise on Bush of him this morning Oh glory to God hallelujah Oh glory so Jesus he was the Living Word why he was cause word main manifests Leavenworth not spoken word only but Living Word the Bible said and the word became flesh it became a Living Word he was a living wood he was God's wood we manifest oh how I like to get into that cords wood made manifest in other words meat noon gourds wood made known in other words he was the one that God lived in to make his wood known Christ express here we go what the word talked you see a lot of Ministers let us talk about house manifest his sons makin the word known make him God known and they're making it known as if it's more revelations more mysteries but listen with the professor here he said what Christ expressed what the word talked [Music] [Applause] Christ after overcoming the devil returned here we go in the power of the Spirit when to the temple found the place where this written because it must be spoken for us right so you found Isaiah 61 and he's read the scriptures the Spirit of God is upon me for he has anointed me what to open the eyes of the mind the heal the brokenhearted and to do this until the death and appreci acceptable that was the prophecy but then when that word become flesh he stepped out when they rejected him I'm a who are you then he won this day description fulfilled and I was this is no longer book talk this is no longer a coat it is no made fresh or give the Lord a shout I'm not caught in you just a coat this is made real so this is Scripture no this is that is true the Sun is that let me tapping the boy under Troy mode and then is that huge second reason then I can so there was in other words is it good I become a reject this stone and they become manifest what the prophecy said but the bride will do the same right now be bearing a reproach for the word a reproach of barrenness because we can produce all what what said yet because we written on the real rain but in the meantime a quantization 1080 11 we have the authority to take the book eat the book and prophesy or give the Lord a shout in the house do you hear what I'm saying this day this scripture is being fulfilled in your ears Oh glory to God we take the book from the angel and we eat it and we prophesy from it so we under the spirit of prophecy which happen to be the testimony of Jesus oh man feel like dancing right now I feel like singing right now I feel like shouting right now so we are under the testimony of Jesus by being anointed with the Premila prophesy and people saying we had a wait for we don't wait for nothin we are it no oh yes go on on your parade wait no yeah I am nothing now Putin have weapons that can be shiny pass it no he is somebody he have things for real he do have a imaginary nuclear bomb you nobody's in mind you know I could do this no he have a for real but am I'm

was shed children was kill everything else the prophecies can't fail God can't lie the world is true put God first let's continue so Christ was the expression of the word that was rude so we talking now beyond the letter now we're talking about beyond I am in a message I have books I have tapes we talking about beyond I play tips beyond that now you talk about you becoming the would manifested you so surrender that God could use you we not mother preacher now he's a different thing all he added take this too but you everyone become the very word manifested oh my hallelujah praise the name of the Lord tonight he said we are getting into there's reason up amongst the groups kind of comparison somebody trying to act like it and live a different life can't drink and smoke a woman can live anybody want to steal watch television and the things of the world and still columns and Pentecostals they are trying to impersonate gen a genuine it's never been revealed to them yet when it's revealed is glorious and something takes a whole out of you when you walk all the way you can't imprison it impersonation was dead Moses vo he was the Living Word to the people and today the people that are feel are the same thing they are written epistles read of all men not a new epistle but the Epistle that's been written made manifest it's doles who believe the world and the promise of this day that God is pouring out his spirit upon all flesh and that is written epistles I when a person tries to kindly impersonate that it backfires because their life shows what you are so what is the word a word is a manifestation of a thought it's an expression of a thought right before you see anything subconsciously you think it before you speak it he taught and he spoke a word and the word has made manifest and every word in the Bible is got parts lead in seed form and that's just the law he put it that's why Gordon come to another man he's a virgin shall conceive which is the seed the woman isn't that right though he's not right he come at her see Jesus isn't right so every word in the Bible is God taught Sladen seed form if receive into human being spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible it brings a thing to pass how powerful could the church be the Bible says let his mind I was in Christ being you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he know your thoughts if they become expression okay oh he's got knowledge - you know me like God said let there be a world before it could be a word try to be a thought so God in the creation created the world by his thought and then spoke it then he expressed it then I become material oh my and if that same spirit I said let there be light and there was light said let there be trees and there was trees and if that seemed mine that was in Christ being you and you say let there be no cancer then it would be gone let the blind eyes be open then it would be so it's your tort or glory to God so what we're looking for now is the main of God to drop down that the thoughts of God could come down however you speak is not our word it's God's thought expressed which is his word that can fail okay the Lord has showed do you see it now we're not talking about a suggestion we're talking about God stinking comment dong into your heart when you speak you're speaking the thoughts of God which is the Word of God half feet and God isn't that right now you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God you see it before it happens and you express it in Word form and that will takes a whole and becomes material thought Express and hope God if your heart and your mind is so in filled with God's Spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts when your mind and your leaden and your guidance becomes a direct place a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving in your motor being what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so empowered so embodied that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but God's but the Holy Spirit have you so built until your thoughts and your beam is God's Spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church should we be this is just you should want this is how you should want us to be minister everybody expressing God man dying out hollowed out Oh God you know Oh glory to God and the Spirit of God could express himself to the flesh of that man would mean flesh the Living Word what kind of people would be this morning if this Branum Tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why you wouldn't even use your own mind didn't even use your own thoughts it has no alternative of your own just to be led back the spirit they that are sons of God are led by the Spirit of God and when the human element moves out Oh glory to God and the Spirit of God since that vacancy one goes out and something comes in the human any man goes out and the Spirit of God fills that they can see when you empty yourself out then will be judged to have its power in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts then your thoughts will become words and words will become material oh no wonder the purpose said oh we lay hands upon the set now but then we'll be speaking the word or chlorine of God no more laying on hands just the power of God the heel blind see lame walk Oh glory to God after church is coming for that's the super church is coming for Oh glory no God listen watch they refused the things of the world what the torch is just to safeguard their thoughts move on they refuse the sins of the world they move in the spirit live in the spirit walk in the spirit and so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forward power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings how oh by the Holy Spirit bringing to the past the thought of their mind I want to read a quote again because deity will be revealed in human beings not by mystery mystery mystery and teach and teach incision and world world world and mechanic mechanic we had a four years deity will reveal human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind the fish was dead for half an hour and the purpose a little fishy I give you back your life in the name of Jesus Christ and the fishes flip over I'm gonna sway before the doctors hand touches my wife the tumor will go down and he wasn't even in the country that would pass through time barrier distance hallelujah and go right between the doctors knife under two months put it right down Oh hallelujah whoo speaking God speaking Oh hallelujah he's speaking for his wife and his God speaking because he tapped into the torch of God and we have a word from the Lord let this mind I was in Christ be in you so that's all that is part of your redemptive rites come on now come on now yeah you know some fathers that half fight with his sons and some mothers have fight with the daughters and they all kind of all kind of petty shipping us all right God doesn't have that when when God's sons begin to manifest sin he is feel proud he's feel good about it we're gonna fight you activator just like him you talk about Adam was supposed to be a god of the earth come on G isn't that right he had dominion over the earth he could control the earth because that is what we were pleased here for and Jesus demonstrated that power and control when he said peace be still when he could take water isn't that right until it's in the wine and bypass all the processes he piped all the grapes all he personally Orlick fermentation if I pass all that act and he could convert it into wine because He is God he can handle the processes and bring it true and he can handle your processes and bring you true so the prostitute all the filthy woman whatever it is he could handle them and bring them true and convert them and change them into the ladies or glory of God that's why they could be genuine Christians you can take the drunkards and a drug addicts and bring them straight through there's nothing is too hard for the Lord he demonstrates because they are all woman like Sarah and transformed as a brief word Isaac nothing is right for the Lord or glory to God a little supper boy like David he can anoint him to be king and they were they ready yet nothing is too hard for the Lord doesn't happen up you don't have to be ready you don't have to be ready as long as the promises yours you don't have to be ready say Amen at the promise you don't have to be ready you don't have to be ready but you will be ready you may be seated all these precious promises you were slamming into these disciples they couldn't handle it yet give them a taste of power watch you can empower on the come upon the comment if they feel subjected us require quite fill us with joy because it your name in the book next next time sabes comments it's Lord we see somebody pushing your name but not with us shall we stop him Baram said was in jealous began a fight because them brothers are with him these sabers gonna fight Jesse you know what she's savvy once they shall be called on fire like Eliezer you know you know what's pretty of them contrary let me have the Holy

wanna LM say other servers give effects because I'm fellas know their mother I miss mommy boys actually won them pushed right next to Christ you see I know I'm a better copy they could drink it let him drink that cup you all right side and left side you see I am NOT in charge of who would and right side and left side there are all kind of issues among them but when they went in the upper room under the promise of the Holy Ghost all our sons go glory to God ha all our sons reaching for the promise of the Father he said behold I send the promise of my father upon you carry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high friends you come in the church come on the expectation for power from on high I didn't promise did God can't lie to you you're gonna have it Oh glory to God amen let's continue oh praise the name of the Lord so this Gospel breeze but the promise is to every surgeon unless on the road if you left home tonight a sinner I'll walk over to the prime time I could god-given opportunity tonight there was one thing lays between you in the promised land what is the promised land the Holy Ghost what lay between Josh on a promise on Jordan oh praise God so watch the promise watch all down to the the promise is the baptism of the Spirit which is promised through the old testament and new to behold I send the promise of my father upon you Peter said under the Pentecost that is the promise the promised land here we go is to live in this land of Holy Spirit that is God's promise for the church is to live in the power of the Spirit it's another world it's another land you have to come out of the conditions you have been in the comet and live in the promised land to receive the promise remember the promise you shall receive power from on high after this the Holy Ghost come upon you nobody here have any excuse to come for anything else you ain't come to see this one on that one ya come to see somebody's clothes you come to get the promise from on high are you with me do you see what you come for what would I do in the upper room they were praising and blessing God continually because the Holy Ghost come and dry the Holy Ghost I come down on deadness it has to have an atmosphere and the apples they have worship and praise that is what the Holy Ones come down into isn't that right but I banham you believe this to be the Bible God's Word okay ibaka this is some as I wasn't Moses I'll be with thee just know bill first this is a take a look at the 11th of September 1960 remember here we go I want you get this you can only be saved by your personal feet you can only be healed by your personal feet you believe this to be the Bible God's Word you believe your parcel to be a man of God whatever torch you go to if you don't you should leave it that's what the Prophet said don't believe the man is a man of God shouldn't leave it watch get to a man that is a man of God then if you believe him believe he's telling you the truth then accepted your own personal faith and Christ saves you no matter how good your pastor is how godly saintly your mother is how real the Word of God is how much you cry how much you pray it's your feet that saves you your personal faith and that is why I have the community you what you see what you believe what you act on him and your worship now the same thing applies no matter God's word that we said in the last days to straight sermons no I brought natural Israel and spiritual Israel together we are looking for the Joshua of this name here we go which is the holy spirit do you get it so just run as our minds somewhere I will give her Josh for the code name Joshua Joshua is the holy spirit to lead us to the land he has to speak to somebody because he's a spirit I've told you what he told me no you believe and be healed this is beautiful because called what God was veiled in brother Branham speaking this he's I told you he said no you believe and be healed did you notice that the Moses the great miracle performer brought Israel down to the land brought him up to the promised land but did not place the inheritance to them he did not give them inheritance he let him up to the land but Joshua devises and land to the people is that right and Christ here we go brought the church up to a place where the position was made possession was made to them was given to them just Jordan the cross but the Holy Spirit is the one who sets the church in order the Joshua of the day puts the church in order given to each one gives places position and he's the voice of God speaking in the inner man that Christ has saved the holy spirit and then he talked about Joshua and Caleb they heard a movement the people or it can't be done it can be done and Caleb run out in the midst of the people and quiet them yes it can be just what stood by him certainly it can be God given to us amen what was it he had the secret behind Caleb and Joshua they were positionally born in Christ they had a knowledge of the word and the word became manifested remember every one of those Israelites had the would preach to them but it only took effect upon Caleb and Joshua to realize what it was all about so that is the revelation Joshua and Caleb even though they were part of the whole bunch they were clearly had a position in Christ and they had revolution was all about and when your revision was about nobody could show you off nobody could set you back Oh glory to God because clear to you what your inheritance is isn't that right so if the emphasis here sets us like just for positionally if from here manases there and God here Benjamin dear so no Minister could place the church or place me or place somebody I can place you God has to please you as his sons and daughters do you believe that how God set some in the church through their labor pains they kept tremendous sometimes when a church here we go church are you ready oh don't tell me no we only homestretch I know we just call it extra time but I'm not notice I'm not getting tired right could this have our function to bring this thing today praise God amen watch when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world and that's gonna come push the Christian gonna come I never see a whole different thing in this message yes believe in our Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was the Penta curse how they groan and cry under labor pains but when they are born one and positionally born to into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some passes some evangelists there's a faithful ministry not before I want to say it again this is a wood from the Prophet this is the seer the Lord God has two pawn and positionally born didn't bought sets in the church not a man say he's a pastor and therefore he that makes him a faithful minister no or somebody says the pasta no no no goroh the set and what God said no man can unzip you see God always was set in sports all to be Paul God was always in his thinkin that man called Saul was always to be a prophet of the Gentiles no as a natural born man he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees killing and hunting Christians but in God's thinkin he's an apostle to the Gentiles now gonna take the neck with his behavior he huntin down Christians and God said time up

am Jesus whom you persecute him after that persecution done he's finished with that no he's a member of the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost he's anointed he is commissioned he gone entire area spent three years on the backside of the desert no consultation with Nord apostle [Music] when he come back I Paul a prisoner of jesus guys have you mess with that man you touch that man what law is if any man think himself to be spiritual or a prophet let him acknowledge what I say this is the Word of God if we be inert let him be ignorant who speaking poor speaker or glory Paul straight not Peter rebuked Peter my god he had apostolic authority to do that because Peter behavior was off and even though he was our posture favored the Holy Ghost pull out a corrective and straighten out or give the Lord a shout or glory the Lord you have to have the right behavior I don't care the Apostle it was right under Jesus it doesn't matter Oh glorious gives a lot of show Oh hallelujah praise God so man

believer hallelujah there's only one place that that kind of strike that's the word that can strike the word because is the Living Word of God then the bride is always part of the bridegroom so the bride will not be a denomination it will have to be the word manifested to be the bride of Christ so all the people trying to say this choice have it this choice have it Duchess of it nice foolishness it will not be a church it has to be the word manifested so you are written epistles and Baram says they were ignorant and unlearned but they were written epistles read that they have been with Jesus called Jesus was manifested instead of true them here we go Christ filled in their flesh manifested made alive like he was in Moses oh praise the name of the Lord Oh glory to God do you see that so go to heaven that guacho ends in the Christ and I'll go John golden to the bride so when announcing the fire came lion they were judged because God had a neutron in the heart of Peter isn't that right no everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice hallelujah if they can't preach the people are sermon you're still a preacher if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of God that will bring a reproach then we reject it they will say if there's any amount of God it's that man a woman live your sermons those how to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you'll get mixed up and messed up your tongue to people up to and ruin them and yourself live your sermons the preachers call the preaches and to live it if you can live it then stop preaching it but you're supposed to live a Simmons Denver Imam said voices how we need intestines of ill thousands of lived voices hallelujah praise God the thunder of God turning out and sweetness and holiness and purity undefiled eyes walking around the earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the Tunde against the enemy the devil don't care how old you holla the devil care how much it jump up and down what hurts the devil is to see sanctified holy life consecrated to God see anything to him call him anything just as sweet as can be we write on that chose him away that's the Tunder that shakes the devil some say well if he could preach like Billy Graham or about somebody a great inventor speaker who sometimes the devil just laughter that he don't pay no attention and nothing you can hold it till you want all the seminary trained and devastate back laughs I mean Holi Diwali laughing laughing at geology but when he sees that life he can laugh at that because you know what I'd like did back there right look at all these houses back there that mean that child but the Epilepsy saying come out of him they're welcome and ever and ever sit in this and now aren't you making a podium of yourselves they were talking to them now you see what you're doing Jesus told you he commissioned you to cast me on another one you can do it but brother when they see him come one come walking quietly he didn't have to see nothing the devil was already scared right there he knowed he had to leave cause he had come a life not a sermon but a life not mysteries a life not more revelations a life he said come out of him that done it quietly he knew what he was talking about oh praise the name of the Lord please God God is know my simplicity and a revelation of Jesus Christ in the most illiterate person or praise isn't that right Northern Rock accepted your life is gone and he has the preeminence east and you show the Prime Minister the people and they see the very life and works inside so in other words you say it has to come to a manifestation we put too much emphasis on the mechanics it has to come to dynamics by lack of this revelation is why are so many different divisions and so much mockery so much divisions because the people lack the revelation the teachers lack the revelation so who can really boost and say I have it who can claim money that's why I asked years ago which Minister knee which church which man have the Ministry of Jesus Christ none so all the
