[11:24] scriptures and the program today in your
[11:26] name we pray amen and amen
[11:30] amen
[11:31] hallelujah amen we want to we want to
[11:33] Dive Right In
[11:36] so we want to read from the Old
[11:39] Testament from 2 Kings chapter
[11:57] 4 now they cried a certain woman of the
[12:01] wives of the sons of the prophets unto
[12:04] unto Elisha saying thy servant my
[12:07] husband is dead and thou knowest that
[12:11] thy servant did fear the lord and the
[12:14] Creditor is come to take unto him my two
[12:18] sons to be bor
[12:19] men and Elisha said unto her what shall
[12:23] I do for thee tell me what hast thou in
[12:27] the house and she said thine handmaid
[12:31] had not anything in the house save a pot
[12:34] of
[12:35] oil then he said go borrow thee vessels
[12:39] abroad of all thy neighbors even empty
[12:43] vessels borrow not a few and when thou
[12:47] art come in Thou shalt shut the door
[12:50] upon thee and upon thy sons and shall
[12:53] pour out into all those vessels and thou
[12:57] shalt set aside that which is full so
[13:00] she went from him and shut the door upon
[13:04] her and upon her sons who brought the
[13:06] vessels to her and she poured
[13:09] out and it came to pass when the vessels
[13:13] were full that she said unto her son
[13:16] bring me yet a vessel and he said unto
[13:20] her there is not a vessel more and the
[13:24] oil
[13:25] stayed then she came and told the man of
[13:28] God
[13:29] and he said go sell the oil and pay thy
[13:34] debt and live thou and thy Children of
[13:37] the
[13:38] rest amen may the Lord add a blessing to
[13:41] the reading of his word you may have
[13:42] your
[13:46] seats so we're going to Dive Right In
[13:49] and just just to lay a a little
[13:53] background this story is All About a
[13:56] financial turnaround
[14:02] and the Widow would have been distressed
[14:06] and financially decapitated because of
[14:10] the debt of her loved one her
[14:13] husband and in this particular story we
[14:18] see where it is that she may have lacked
[14:20] like the economic value value in the
[14:24] household and she would have borrowed
[14:26] accumulated debt
[14:30] and she would have borrowed for
[14:31] liabilities and accumulated debt and
[14:34] would have ended up in a financial
[14:36] situation a financial
[14:41] circumstance
[14:44] now this story and there was there
[14:47] wasn't a name that was said of this
[14:51] particular woman of this particular
[14:53] Widow neither of the
[14:55] prophet and I believe that there's a lot
[14:58] of lessons that that we could learn from
[14:59] the story because it's not necessarily
[15:03] about the name or or specifically who it
[15:07] was but I believe that there's Great
[15:10] Value in the story because from society
[15:13] today they paint some pictures and they
[15:17] focus on certain things
[15:21] which in the same case could cause us to
[15:24] be under
[15:26] distress Financial decapit reputation
[15:30] they focus so much on security and
[15:34] having a job in today's society that one
[15:37] little mishap could spiral a
[15:41] downturn so we want to just tune in and
[15:45] Dive Right In to a couple things that
[15:48] would enable us to see what the prophet
[15:50] the man of
[15:52] God who dealt with her would have been
[15:54] able to instruct her
[15:57] on right so so just by the way there's
[16:00] one there's a formula for poverty which
[16:03] we can note from this particular
[16:06] story and the formula for for poverty in
[16:10] this particular story is borrow to buy
[16:15] liabilities and how do we know that she
[16:17] would have bought um like liabilities or
[16:20] the family had bought
[16:22] liabilities because when Elisha ask her
[16:26] tell me what has th in the house she
[16:29] didn't have anything that was remaining
[16:32] from what the funds were used
[16:35] for so it's a lesson to learn that if
[16:39] there's something that's priced here but
[16:42] we borrow to buy it but it no longer has
[16:46] value and that is something that you
[16:48] keep on doing then there'll be an
[16:50] increasing gap between what you owe and
[16:53] what it is that you
[16:54] have right so and just also for
[17:00] context we would see that the poverty
[17:04] that is stated in this particular
[17:07] passage is also someone who is dependent
[17:12] on the graciousness of someone else
[17:15] somebody who is dependent on the system
[17:18] or dependent on the generosity of
[17:20] someone else right
[17:23] so now in this passage here there's a
[17:26] seven-point plan that the Prophet would
[17:29] have given her to be able to turn around
[17:32] her debt right but just before that I
[17:35] want
[17:36] to
[17:38] just talk
[17:40] about don't sell your
[17:43] sons right and it's something that is in
[17:46] this passage here and just in case that
[17:49] you didn't know there was a law back
[17:52] then where if it is that you could not
[17:54] have paid debt that your family was in
[17:59] the fine print so your family paid a
[18:02] price where it is that they were taken
[18:05] to be Bond men to be slaves until what
[18:08] that debt was was actually repaid right
[18:11] or until the year of um like Jubilee
[18:13] when everything else was returned to its
[18:16] owner right so and when I'm talking
[18:20] about don't sell your sons we have to
[18:22] acknowledge also that in this particular
[18:25] passage when she said that the Creditor
[18:28] has come to take unto him my two sons to
[18:30] be born men that actually meant that the
[18:33] debt would have been settled if it is
[18:35] that she would have allow that to happen
[18:37] so the debt would have been cancelled in
[18:39] that case right
[18:43] so in this particular passage it spoke
[18:48] about your literal Sons but I want to
[18:51] talk about your metaphoric Sons as well
[18:54] right so we normally talk about your
[18:56] children are your future but we we are
[19:00] talking about your future so don't sell
[19:02] your sons means don't sell your future
[19:04] don't sell your destiny don't sell your
[19:06] dreams don't sell your legacy because
[19:09] all those are things that actually
[19:11] impact you in the future and sometimes
[19:14] we may not we may not go too deep into
[19:17] it but there's tradeoffs that actually
[19:20] happen on the financial level so for
[19:23] example you may buy a shoes a phone
[19:26] sneakers and you don't know know exactly
[19:29] what it is is the is the cost that is
[19:32] being given up in the future now I'm not
[19:35] saying don't get me wrong I'm not saying
[19:37] that we don't need these things and you
[19:39] don't need a shoes and a phone and so on
[19:42] but I'm saying that these things are
[19:44] supposed to be measured within where the
[19:48] budget is and not
[19:51] necessarily have a impact in your future
[19:54] and the reason that I'm saying this is
[19:57] because
[19:59] the
[20:00] devil is not coming unless he's coming
[20:03] to steal to kill and
[20:05] destroy and what it is that he could
[20:07] steal and kill and destroy and what he
[20:09] wants to steal and kill and destroy is
[20:12] your future is your dreams is your
[20:14] destiny it's your legacy because if it
[20:17] is that and I know that you all see it
[20:19] in today's world if you feel like your
[20:23] destiny has been crippled then you feel
[20:26] like you don't have that much to live
[20:28] for and we see that that is pervasive of
[20:32] the culture that we're in today and what
[20:35] the devil wants you to think is that
[20:38] it's all doom and gloom and there's
[20:40] nothing for you to to feel cheerful
[20:42] about and for you to feel bright about
[20:44] and for you to feel positive about and
[20:48] when we read the Bible it's for us to to
[20:52] to remind us that we are here for a
[20:56] purpose that our
[20:59] our purpose on this Earth is also
[21:02] intentional it's strategic it's
[21:04] meaningful it's for a season and we
[21:07] don't want to give the devil the power
[21:10] to be able to impact our future and
[21:12] impact our dreams so we need to be able
[21:15] to protect it so hence the reason that I
[21:17] say don't sell your sons meaning we need
[21:20] to be conscious of the transactions we
[21:23] doing now that will actually impact us
[21:26] in the future amen
[21:29] right
[21:32] so I also want to talk
[21:35] about I want to talk about the
[21:37] difference between the hand out versus a
[21:40] hand
[21:41] up right so just in case that you missed
[21:44] it
[21:46] when the Widow would have
[21:48] said would have given that passage thy
[21:52] servant my husband is dead and thou
[21:54] knowest that thy servant did fear the
[21:57] lord and the Creditor is come to take
[21:59] unto him my two sons to be Bond
[22:02] men what she was looking for was a
[22:05] handout at that point in time she was
[22:07] looking for
[22:09] assistance right and Elisha said unto
[22:12] her what shall I do for thee tell me
[22:15] what hast thou in the house and the
[22:18] reason that it's phrased like that what
[22:19] shall I do for thee tell me what hast
[22:22] thou in the house it means you are
[22:24] looking outward when you should be
[22:27] looking inward
[22:29] amen so I'm just going to talk a little
[22:32] bit about the difference between the
[22:34] hand out versus a hand up and also we we
[22:38] saw it where Peter and John was coming
[22:42] out of the temple at um I believe is at
[22:44] the gate called beautiful and there was
[22:46] the beggar on the road and he was also
[22:48] looking for a
[22:50] handout right and instead Peter was in
[22:52] the position to say Silver and Gold Have
[22:54] I None but such as I have I give it unto
[22:57] thee rise up and walk and he grab him
[23:00] and pull him up right so we want to be
[23:04] able to know what's the difference
[23:06] between a hand out and a hand up because
[23:08] the prophet in this particular story was
[23:11] not willing to give a hand out because a
[23:15] hand out sometimes could be help that
[23:18] actually hurt somebody because it's it
[23:21] it may not solve the problem it's not
[23:23] going to solve the problem so he was
[23:25] there and about to give a hand up so
[23:29] a handout might feed you for a day but a
[23:32] hand up it feeds you for life a handout
[23:36] means instant I'm like gratification to
[23:38] deal with the instant need but a handout
[23:41] positions you to be able to grow to get
[23:44] Knowledge and Skills and insight and
[23:46] wisdom a handout enables you to be able
[23:49] to purchase liabilities and spend in the
[23:53] present but a handup enables you to be
[23:55] able to invest and plan for the future
[23:59] amen I mean we also saw it in the
[24:03] children of God that was coming out of
[24:06] Egypt right in the wilderness they got
[24:08] Mana which was a hand out but God had
[24:13] already positioned them to enter into
[24:15] the promised land the land of flowing
[24:17] with milk and honey which would have
[24:19] been a hand up now of course they would
[24:21] have had to use their resources and work
[24:25] and apply themselves but that was a hand
[24:27] out a hand up sorry that would position
[24:31] them and give them to be able to build
[24:33] and have a legacy
[24:34] amen so God's plan is always going to be
[24:39] a plan to empower you to be stronger to
[24:43] be better to be wiser it's always going
[24:47] to be to give you a hand up and not a
[24:50] hand out God wants you to be sustainable
[24:54] and not
[24:55] dependent and some people keep praying
[24:58] for handouts instead of hand
[25:01] ups and what may start as a prayer God
[25:05] wants to be able to give you a plan
[25:12] amen
[25:14] so we want to look at this seven-point
[25:19] plan which the prophet of God would have
[25:22] given to the Widow and it starts with
[25:26] first of all he said
[25:28] what shall I do for thee right tell me
[25:31] what hast thou in the house so step one
[25:34] is to look
[25:36] within so you need to be able to take a
[25:39] personal audit of where it is that you
[25:42] are at take a personal audit of your
[25:45] skills of your resources of what it is
[25:47] that you have and there's so much
[25:50] persons and I see it like this sometimes
[25:54] you may have a pond you may have the
[25:56] fishing rod but somebody's walking with
[25:59] a fish in their hand and it looks
[26:02] appealing but you have the resources
[26:05] that you need to get you to way it is
[26:06] that you need to go right so conduct a
[26:09] personal assessment on what you possess
[26:12] don't get distracted by what others have
[26:16] and reason being is that we're all
[26:18] fearfully and wonderfully made and what
[26:21] that means is that everybody has their
[26:24] own unique purpose there is nobody else
[26:28] in the history of the world who will
[26:31] ever be like you and and possess what it
[26:34] is that you
[26:35] possess right and something you already
[26:39] have from God is the key to everything
[26:41] else that God has promised you because
[26:46] again he has given you the seeds that
[26:49] you need as Jehovah Gyra as your
[26:52] provider he has not left you without
[26:55] anything right so he has given you the
[26:58] seeds for your Redemption for your
[27:01] economic like Redemption so that first
[27:04] step is why are you looking outwards
[27:07] when you have something
[27:10] inside now we're going to move on to
[27:12] step
[27:13] two step two is to recognize the seed
[27:17] potential of what you possess and it's
[27:21] also calling some business cases the
[27:24] principle of
[27:26] recognition now this is where she said
[27:30] thine handmaid had not anything in the
[27:32] house save a pot of oil now everything
[27:36] else would have abandoned her at that
[27:39] point in time but the oil was faithful
[27:42] so the oil could have looked left could
[27:45] have looked right and say listen now
[27:47] there's nothing here standing with me
[27:49] but I'm
[27:50] here and you start your you're saying by
[27:53] saying thine handmade had not anything
[27:55] in the house but I stand here big and B
[27:59] right the oil so sometimes we take for
[28:05] granted and we undermine the things that
[28:08] we are very familiar with so she may
[28:11] have been familiar with the oil that was
[28:13] there so in her mind listen is is
[28:16] nothing in the house and that is a
[28:20] natural law that we see so for example
[28:23] there might be people who live by the
[28:26] beach they don't they don't have the
[28:29] type of reverence for the beach like the
[28:31] people who not by the beach anytime
[28:33] somebody who not accustom being by the
[28:35] beach City the beach woo look the water
[28:38] look how the sun look this thing they
[28:41] want to touch your water so on and so
[28:42] the people who Liv in next to the beach
[28:45] same old you
[28:46] know similarly there's people who have
[28:49] you have a fancy fruit in your yard you
[28:51] have a nice mango or whatever that it is
[28:53] but because you accustomed with
[28:56] it it no longer
[28:58] feels like it's
[29:00] special right somebody might see it and
[29:04] be like you have that in your yard all
[29:06] this
[29:07] time like you play
[29:10] in so so much
[29:13] time the
[29:15] oil and whatever that we have that we
[29:18] might be familiar with it becomes
[29:20] overlooked it becomes unappreciated it
[29:23] becomes unutilized it becomes taken for
[29:26] granted it becomes
[29:29] undervalued and in this particular
[29:32] passage what we're being shown here is
[29:35] what we might take for granted someone
[29:38] else will find
[29:40] valuable
[29:42] amen
[29:44] so you have
[29:47] something and just like in Matthew
[29:52] 25 he that ha much will be given and
[29:56] from he who doesn't have what little
[29:58] that he have will be taken away the
[30:01] principle is if you call your something
[30:07] nothing if you call your something
[30:09] nothing then it becomes
[30:12] nothing but if you call your nothing
[30:15] something it could become
[30:17] something amen and don't allow the
[30:21] perceive value of others to influence
[30:24] your lack of recognition of the seed
[30:26] potential so for examp example somebody
[30:29] who is not
[30:31] gifted equally as you or may not
[30:34] reverence the skill that you have they
[30:37] may not have a value for what it is that
[30:40] you
[30:41] have
[30:43] but move past that right don't allow
[30:48] somebody else to Benchmark the value of
[30:51] what it is that you have right so
[30:55] somebody might say hey well
[30:58] I could do this I could do this but you
[31:00] could only make
[31:02] bake right or I could I could I could
[31:05] make a nice burger sandwich and whatnot
[31:07] and stuff but you could only make juice
[31:10] don't let anybody make your something
[31:13] feel like nothing that you put that
[31:15] image of nothing on it right and by
[31:19] recognizing the seed what you need to to
[31:22] understand most importantly is that a
[31:24] seed is a harvest that is compressed yes
[31:28] so in the seed there is Harvest and
[31:32] there's multiple Harvest right so
[31:35] understand that there's seed potential
[31:38] and recognize that so that you could
[31:40] call what might be perceived as nothing
[31:43] you could call it something and then you
[31:45] could make something out of it and it's
[31:47] all about the the perspective of it
[31:50] right amen so on to step
[31:54] three step
[31:56] three is is borrow
[32:00] vessels right and there's a lot that we
[32:02] could get from that borrow vessels even
[32:05] empty
[32:06] vessels so borrow and there's a lot to
[32:10] be able to learn here borrow speaks to
[32:13] the relational type of currency that she
[32:17] would have had because what that meant
[32:21] is that she needed to go and interact
[32:23] with her neighbors in fact if I read it
[32:27] it's said borrow vessels of all thy
[32:31] neighbors and it speaks
[32:34] to we need to be able to live such a
[32:37] Christian Life that we have relational
[32:42] value with everybody that we interact
[32:45] with right some may be more valuable
[32:48] than some but it still needs to be
[32:49] relational value so for example your
[32:52] neighbor supposed to be able to watch
[32:54] you and be able to tell that you're a
[32:56] Christian
[32:58] right so some persons if it is that we
[33:00] know the situation we say hey well go
[33:02] and borrow from your neighbor well what
[33:04] did happen was about 5 years ago the dog
[33:08] had come through the hole and because of
[33:10] that I end up picking up a stone I Pelt
[33:12] it over there I miss the dog but it
[33:14] break the window since then we never
[33:17] talk right but in this particular
[33:20] situation here it she still had
[33:25] relational value and she would have
[33:28] operated in such a way that she would
[33:29] have been able to maintain
[33:31] relationships right and she would not
[33:34] have have operated like a beggar right
[33:37] so persons would have been able to
[33:39] relate with her situation and say hey
[33:42] she's a Christian she's probably just
[33:44] having a a tough time
[33:47] but it's a neighbor it's a family amen
[33:51] so in Proverbs
[33:54] 19:7 it says all the Brethren of the
[33:57] poor do hate him how much more do his
[33:59] friends go far from him and it means
[34:02] that if you operate in such a way in a
[34:05] certain way there's a way that would
[34:08] actually run friends away from you and
[34:11] it meant that she didn't operate like
[34:14] that and it's also a lesson for us that
[34:17] even if we are down to nothing we still
[34:20] want to maintain as much relational
[34:23] value as we could so not because you are
[34:26] going through a rough and a tough time
[34:27] time mean that you can't tell your
[34:29] neighbor good morning you can't say God
[34:30] bless you you can't say hey I hope that
[34:32] I really have a good day I really
[34:35] looking forward for you to be blessed
[34:36] and so on those kind words and
[34:40] sometimes you even get that I even get
[34:43] that from people who not in church they
[34:45] don't go to church but hey thanks so
[34:47] much for checking up on me I hope you
[34:48] and the family good and so on and so on
[34:50] and so on and those little things become
[34:53] so valuable because I say but wait now I
[34:55] don't get up so so so but so just just
[35:01] to show you as
[35:02] well there's Proverbs 112 So I actually
[35:07] went into this because yes it's borrow
[35:09] vessels and most times we talk about the
[35:11] principles of borrowing but we didn't
[35:13] talk about the principle of that
[35:14] relational value so Proverbs 11:12 says
[35:18] he that is void of wisdom despiseth his
[35:22] neighbor but a man of understanding
[35:25] holdeth his peace so somebody who's void
[35:30] of wisdom somebody who doesn't
[35:32] understand and might be very very
[35:33] foolish will quarrel and have that that
[35:38] hatred there right but somebody who who
[35:42] basically understands he's going to see
[35:45] how it is that he could quell any any
[35:48] dispute because that my neighbor I
[35:50] living I living next to him I don't want
[35:52] bottles to be pelt in over and so on and
[35:55] stuff like that so there's a principle
[35:57] to be learned here which is always grow
[35:59] your network of friends and it's really
[36:02] hard for you to live a Christian Life if
[36:04] it is that you are unable to display a
[36:06] Christian
[36:07] testimony
[36:09] amen so there's another one here
[36:12] Proverbs 18:24 it says a man that had
[36:15] friends must show himself friendly and
[36:19] there is a friend that sticked closer
[36:21] than a
[36:23] brother so what that means is that if
[36:26] you have friends you need to be friendly
[36:28] to continue having friends and then
[36:32] there's friends who would even who would
[36:34] even come closer than your family Circle
[36:37] could ever
[36:40] bring so so some people who might say
[36:43] hey well that is my family and that my
[36:45] family and D my family and they limit
[36:47] themselves to the small circle they're
[36:49] missing out on other relational value
[36:51] because there are friends who will
[36:54] present themselves closer than a
[36:58] brother and it was here in the Bible I
[37:02] didn't put it in so build your
[37:05] relational
[37:06] currency right so now we want to talk
[37:09] about the vessels right vessels are
[37:12] containers right so vessels are
[37:15] containers and we could go really deep
[37:17] into this and when it says borrow
[37:20] vessels even empty vessels we talking
[37:24] about multiple different containers
[37:28] different shapes different sizes
[37:30] uniquely designed because a family of
[37:33] five or six may need a differ size
[37:36] vessel than a family of two or three
[37:39] right and empty vessels sometimes
[37:43] seemingly lacking in value but holds
[37:46] infinite
[37:48] potential right empty vessels seemingly
[37:50] lacking value but holds infinite
[37:53] potential and basically to every coin
[37:56] there's two signs
[37:59] and you never eat a one-sided piece of
[38:02] bread yet
[38:03] right every Everything has two sides to
[38:07] it so somebody might say well it's empty
[38:11] so it's worthless but the other end of
[38:14] it is that it's empty so it can be
[38:16] filled up full of potential right so it
[38:19] could be filled up with purpose it could
[38:21] be filled up with Solutions it can be
[38:23] filled up with value amen so we talk
[38:28] about it could be the same contents but
[38:31] in different containers so for
[38:34] example sometimes someone may write a
[38:37] book and then they take the book they
[38:40] turn it into a movie they take the movie
[38:42] they turn it into a play they take the
[38:45] play they turn it into a series they
[38:46] take the series they turn it into into a
[38:49] kids version book book series and what
[38:52] they do is the same story they able to
[38:55] package it and repackage it and
[38:56] repackage it and and repackage it into
[38:59] different containers into different
[39:01] vessels right so the concept is one the
[39:05] relational value we understand what
[39:07] borrowing means and we talking about the
[39:11] actual vessels the containers now we're
[39:14] going to move on to step four which is
[39:16] not a few right and I basically I love
[39:20] this
[39:22] because I believe that everybody's
[39:25] limited by how they could open their
[39:28] mind and expose their mind right so you
[39:31] are limited
[39:33] by your
[39:35] mindset right so not a few instructing
[39:40] her not a few is basically you want to
[39:44] be able to get past that mindset of
[39:48] dealing with the present dealing with
[39:49] the now because if you give anybody a
[39:52] chance to deal with their situation they
[39:54] will deal with today they will say
[39:56] listen I really need to dos now to buy a
[39:58] loaf of bread and this and that and this
[40:00] they not thinking about tomorrow they're
[40:01] not thinking about next week they're not
[40:02] thinking about next month they're not
[40:04] thinking about next year they're not
[40:05] thinking about about Beyond themselves
[40:09] they're not thinking about the brother
[40:10] the sister the family the uncle the
[40:12] whoever and so on they're not thinking
[40:13] about the children they're not thinking
[40:15] about the children's children they're
[40:16] not thinking about the Legacy
[40:18] because they may have a limited
[40:20] perspective so the not a
[40:23] few means that you would be limited by
[40:27] home how much that you are able to
[40:29] borrow you are a you are limited by the
[40:32] number of containers imagine imagine
[40:35] that you could real make juice and you
[40:38] make a big bucket of juice but you only
[40:41] have two
[40:42] cups so you could only sell two cups or
[40:45] you only have two bottles so you could
[40:46] only sell two bottles well you didn't
[40:49] plan and you didn't think big enough
[40:51] because when you start to add sugar and
[40:53] fruits and so on you should have
[40:54] realized wait now I should always over
[40:57] prepare
[40:58] right and the point is prepare for the
[41:01] abundance and have the faith and the
[41:03] expectation so not a few means that God
[41:06] is willing to do more for you than you
[41:09] think than you could perceive so you
[41:12] need to continually expand your capacity
[41:16] continually expand your thinking there's
[41:19] so borrowing too few vessels means that
[41:23] you are limiting God to what it is that
[41:26] you think that he could provide
[41:29] amen and you need to be able to to quell
[41:33] small thinking because what it limits is
[41:36] the big outcomes and the big um like
[41:39] Miracles that God has in store for
[41:43] you so we going
[41:48] good so step
[41:53] five step five is shut the door and
[41:59] po shut the door and
[42:02] po so
[42:05] one shut the door and Pa and I want to
[42:09] deal with shut the door first it speaks
[42:11] about Focus right so you're not able to
[42:14] focus unless you're able to shut
[42:16] out outside voices negativity and so on
[42:19] and stuff like that it speaks about purp
[42:22] um focus but two it also talks about
[42:26] something
[42:27] in business which is that business
[42:30] always has a secret part of it a secret
[42:34] I'm like component of it right so for
[42:37] example if it is a look at KFC they will
[42:40] say the secret is the 21 herbs and
[42:42] spices or I think is I'm like 11 herbs
[42:45] and and and spices now they may front
[42:48] that as their secret that may not be the
[42:50] only secret they may have supply chain
[42:53] Secrets different things in terms of
[42:55] structure and franchising secrets and so
[42:57] on and stuff like that but just think
[42:59] about it like this if I was to sell
[43:02] pineapple on the road and I'm saying and
[43:04] I come out every morning and I say $30 a
[43:07] pineapple everybody find that it's a
[43:09] good deal and then I come to tell
[43:11] everybody well how I does really do it
[43:14] for that great price is that 6:00 in the
[43:17] evening the day before a guy does pass
[43:20] right here selling it for
[43:24] $10 so is only a matter of days before I
[43:28] out of business because everybody will
[43:29] go and collect it for
[43:31] $10 you understand so there's always a
[43:33] secret part of the business and this is
[43:37] also true of processes right so most
[43:40] persons they always see the finish line
[43:42] and the glitz and the Glamour and so on
[43:44] they see the Sportsman who successful
[43:47] and so on they don't see the process
[43:49] right and seeds grow grow beneath the
[43:53] soil seeds grow beneath the soil so you
[43:56] can't see
[43:57] how the seed is developing and when it
[44:00] bursts out and when it is that it starts
[44:02] to be able to grow you begin to see when
[44:05] it is that you see it flowering and you
[44:06] see the fruits and so on and stuff like
[44:08] that so it speaks to protecting the
[44:11] process because no one could could have
[44:14] known that it was Miracle
[44:17] Oil because if it kept flowing and
[44:20] flowing and the door is open and
[44:21] somebody saying wa is a is a oil rig
[44:25] inside of there you just pumping oil
[44:27] Ting Ting and then you turn around and
[44:28] you say all right well I'm going and put
[44:30] them up for sale just now $150 a
[44:33] container you're going to be like but
[44:36] why does they going charge me for
[44:37] something that flowing like that you
[44:40] understand so shut the door and PAW so
[44:43] the poor speaks to the action and like
[44:45] The Obedience and your faith grows
[44:48] through the action and pouring res also
[44:53] reflects that word pour in reflects
[44:56] blessings right so being able to
[44:58] practice that that
[45:00] process and basically with this shut the
[45:04] door and Pa on the action it also meant
[45:08] that the Miracle Oil that didn't run out
[45:11] had the potential to fill every vessel
[45:15] in the world but it was limited to the
[45:18] vessels that she
[45:19] had
[45:21] right
[45:25] so we on step five
[45:27] live and we're going to because we
[45:30] talking about shut the da and po I just
[45:33] want to pause to just talk about the oil
[45:35] a little bit right about the mystery of
[45:37] the oil and of course we're
[45:39] talking metaphorically we
[45:42] talking um about the passage and the
[45:46] parable and so on
[45:49] so what represents the oil because the
[45:52] oil stayed and the oil did not leave and
[45:57] one of the lessons that we could learn
[45:59] from it is that material things may come
[46:01] and go but there's other things that
[46:04] would not leave you right so so your
[46:08] expertise and your
[46:10] skills I'm like the experience that you
[46:13] have in your job environment your
[46:15] passion for something like your
[46:16] enthusiasm your um like your empathy how
[46:19] you could relate with certain situations
[46:21] because you may have had the situations
[46:23] your insights your personal Proverbs
[46:25] your knowledge your life lessons these
[46:29] are things that are unique to you that
[46:32] stay with you and they can be a Lifeline
[46:36] onto
[46:38] others so for example if it is that you
[46:40] know how to make juice that skill not
[46:43] going to leave you that is oil right now
[46:47] somebody now needs to convince you that
[46:51] other persons who can't make juice will
[46:53] find your juice
[46:54] valuable right so your network your
[46:59] contacts all those things are also
[47:04] oil metaphoric oil right and if it's
[47:08] poured into the right containers so if
[47:10] knowledge is poured into books and
[47:13] courses and events and the presentations
[47:15] and so on these could become different
[47:19] containers that they're
[47:22] in
[47:24] and it could be taken for granted
[47:26] planted but it is oil that could be
[47:29] valuable to others and there's something
[47:32] that I always say about about the Grain
[47:34] and the corn I'm like in
[47:36] Egypt and some people would think that
[47:39] Joseph Joseph could have gave and so on
[47:43] but then it moves I'm like we're moving
[47:45] on to step six and step six is to sell
[47:48] the
[47:50] oil so step six is to sell the oil so
[47:53] she came and she told the man of God
[47:57] and he said go sell the
[48:00] oil so imagine this you went through the
[48:04] process and you obeyed so you obeyed you
[48:08] went in you shut the door with you and
[48:11] your sons you poured the
[48:14] oil
[48:15] so on the table is oil on the gr is oil
[48:19] on the bed is oil in the porches oil all
[48:22] over is
[48:24] oil and and the prophet is saying to go
[48:28] and sell the oil so what this means is
[48:32] that unless you learn how to uncover the
[48:35] value of your oil which is to Market and
[48:39] to sell the oil you could have oil and
[48:42] still be
[48:48] broke so your testimony can't
[48:52] [Music]
[48:54] help it can't help somebody who doesn't
[48:57] see right it can't help somebody who
[49:00] doesn't who isn't able to see the value
[49:03] of it right and selling the oil means
[49:08] also that blessings are distributed as
[49:11] well through relationships as well as
[49:15] interactions so it means that you can't
[49:18] sell the oil in a bubble and you not
[49:21] talking to anybody and the and some and
[49:23] people just going to show up and pass
[49:25] money for the oil it meant that you
[49:27] needed to go and uncover the value of
[49:30] this is it could be used for cooking it
[49:32] could be used in this it could be used
[49:34] for fuel it could be used for this and
[49:36] so on and stuff like that so imagine
[49:40] imagine she may have borrowed containers
[49:42] from the neighbors and some of those
[49:44] same persons she would have been able to
[49:47] go back to and say hey and the person
[49:48] say well that look like my container
[49:51] know but she could say well it was empty
[49:54] but now it full so I'll give you a
[49:57] discount just because it's your is your
[49:58] container but it's valuable stuff inside
[50:01] of
[50:01] here so some of these same persons that
[50:04] she may have borrowed from she would
[50:06] have been able to go and sell because
[50:09] they would have been able to find that a
[50:11] full vessel with oil is way more
[50:13] valuable than an empty vessel right
[50:16] amen
[50:18] so you have the ability to help a
[50:22] business
[50:23] grow to help people become fit and
[50:26] healthy
[50:27] to help families to stay together to
[50:30] Mentor somebody to train somebody to be
[50:33] able to impact somebody um somebody's
[50:35] mental health to be able to impact
[50:38] somebody's lifestyle and that blessing
[50:42] that you'll get from being able to do
[50:44] that from being able to serve others is
[50:47] is what you will be able to get as notes
[50:50] of thanks because what what the finances
[50:54] really is based on and they don't teach
[50:57] you anything about this in school they
[50:59] just brush everything over but
[51:04] but money is normally paid for Value
[51:07] created in others it's not for Value
[51:10] created for yourself it's value that is
[51:13] created for others so the reason that a
[51:16] business would pay you is because you
[51:19] create a certain amount of value for the
[51:21] business for them and your salary is a
[51:25] reflection of that
[51:28] so so most most persons just feel it it
[51:31] it just falls from the sky they don't
[51:33] understand the value that is being
[51:36] created right so the oil one sold could
[51:40] meet the needs of
[51:43] others
[51:45] and there's this um there's this
[51:48] scripture that I Al always quote from
[51:51] Proverbs he that withh holdeth the cor
[51:53] the people shall curse him but bless sin
[51:56] shall be upon the head of him that sth
[51:59] it him that sth what the corn the corn
[52:02] that could sustain somebody so what
[52:04] happen is that if something is not sold
[52:07] there's no value that is that is
[52:09] communicated for
[52:10] it
[52:12] so just like how they say where where
[52:16] your treasure is there your heart will
[52:18] be I'm like also and beauty is in the
[52:20] eye of the beholder well
[52:24] unless there is value that is is
[52:27] communicated for the corn or for the oil
[52:30] or whatever that you have no one will be
[52:33] able to know the significance of it
[52:35] unless there's a price for it and and
[52:39] that is exactly why um there was a
[52:43] message a while back where it is that we
[52:45] were reading that David paid for the
[52:48] stuff that was offered to him free
[52:50] because he he didn't want to
[52:53] give sacrifice something that cost him
[52:55] nothing
[52:57] because something that costs you nothing
[53:00] becomes not valuable and I always
[53:03] reference to persons that that for
[53:05] example you work hard and you're going
[53:07] on you do this you're going on you
[53:09] purchase X it holds a significant you go
[53:13] and you buy something for $10,000 it
[53:15] holds a significant amount of value for
[53:17] you because you would have been able to
[53:19] validate the price tag behind it right
[53:22] you would have worked and you would have
[53:23] been able to pay for it but the person
[53:25] who comes along snatched that and gone
[53:28] with it they didn't pay the price the
[53:32] cost and so on so that is why in crime
[53:36] you have somebody could take a $10,000
[53:39] thing and they will they will run around
[53:42] the corner and say hey if I get 500 for
[53:45] this now I
[53:46] good because there's no price that was
[53:49] paid for it so for example um and I
[53:53] don't mean to go here but there's people
[53:58] who believe that the best things in life
[54:03] are
[54:05] free and that that is the furthest thing
[54:09] from the truth right the best thing in
[54:11] life that's free is salvation and God's
[54:16] word and and he paid a price for
[54:18] it right
[54:21] so everything has a price and a cost and
[54:25] sometimes you may not see it sometimes
[54:27] you may not notice it because it might
[54:29] appear free to you but it actually cost
[54:32] somebody else and one thing that we have
[54:34] to be conscious of is that that we're
[54:37] only going to be able to open our eyes
[54:39] and our lens a certain way so for
[54:41] example the person who is wired to see
[54:45] free and to see hand out they miss
[54:48] seeing the hand
[54:50] up they miss seeing that I can develop
[54:54] the skills and the knowledge and and
[54:56] apply it unto myself and be self-
[54:59] sustained and not just provide for meing
[55:01] now but provide for myself in the
[55:05] future
[55:07] so we move on to step seven so step
[55:13] seven is pay your debt and live on the
[55:18] rest pay your debt and live under rest
[55:22] so step seven speaks to financial
[55:24] discipline
[55:26] now it may have been in the past that
[55:29] the distress and and like the
[55:32] devastation in that household would have
[55:34] been from Financial indiscipline but the
[55:37] prophet is saying this is how to be able
[55:40] to structure it don't go and say
[55:42] listener I could not have afforded it
[55:45] before but I really needed to have a
[55:47] vacation and I was thinking about a
[55:49] cruise and now with all this new found
[55:51] money this this is word in due season
[55:54] and now get my breakthrough here I need
[55:56] to take my cruise I will deal with that
[55:58] after the thing is
[56:02] that you need to address the issues as
[56:05] soon as you can so Financial discipline
[56:09] in this case speaks to Breaking the
[56:11] cycle and the curse of negative
[56:14] debt and and the devastation and the
[56:16] impact that it would have had right so
[56:20] don't go buy a car don't go on a
[56:22] vacation don't go and buy a cell phone
[56:24] deal with the debt first
[56:26] then live on the rest it says you and
[56:30] your sons live on the rest meaning that
[56:34] within your means live on the rest
[56:37] meaning that it could provide her with a
[56:39] lifetime of Revenue once they are able
[56:42] to live within their means so it means
[56:46] that from now on instead of being being
[56:49] indiscipline we need to focus on
[56:53] financial Intelligence being
[56:55] commercially sophis tigated living
[56:57] within your means and being able to have
[57:00] the financial disciplines to address the
[57:03] critical issues and you need to be able
[57:06] to to write and list and say all right
[57:09] this is this is number one to be able to
[57:11] deal with number two number three and
[57:13] the issue is when the funds come don't
[57:17] go and rearrange that and go and put
[57:19] something above and so on and say listen
[57:21] I really needed this rest I need to make
[57:23] a I need to make a um like a Tobago trip
[57:26] I really needed a a shopping spree right
[57:29] because that will not address the need
[57:33] the issue that put you there still needs
[57:36] to be solved and we don't want you to be
[57:38] five months down the road you're looking
[57:40] for a handout when it is that we already
[57:43] gave you a hand up
[57:45] amen so you feeling fine so
[57:49] far right so you need to balance your
[57:53] priorities and debt symbol izes bondage
[57:57] and repayment represents Liberation and
[58:01] freedom so you want to be able to
[58:03] position that now yes she would have
[58:08] borrowed from vessels from her neighbors
[58:11] and so on but in this case it was
[58:15] borrowed to be able to package the oil
[58:19] the assets that would have been able to
[58:21] be sold right so it's a life lesson for
[58:24] us to be able to understand understand
[58:26] that we don't want to be in the poverty
[58:28] cycle of borrowing for liabilities we
[58:32] want to be able to borrow for something
[58:33] that will that will enable us to be able
[58:36] to to accelerate and
[58:40] leverage blessings that could come out
[58:43] of being able to sell and grow our
[58:46] business
[58:48] amen
[58:52] so this whole Passage
[58:56] has so much nuggets to learn from it and
[59:00] it's all about that Financial turnaround
[59:05] and understanding that there's so much
[59:07] more value so much more value to what it
[59:11] is that you are um that you do to how
[59:14] God would have made you and that you are
[59:16] unique that you are blessed and that you
[59:19] need to be able to focus and not all the
[59:22] time that you're looking for hey well
[59:24] what if it is at our own only had the
[59:28] help it would have solved
[59:31] XYZ right well in this
[59:35] case it was what shall I do for thee
[59:37] tell me what hast thou in the house
[59:40] which means that in you and in us are
[59:44] all the seeds that we need to be able to
[59:47] to do everything that God has promised
[59:50] unto us to be able for us to be able to
[59:53] access all our promises right right and
[59:57] I just I really trust that I was able to
[1:00:02] bring out this story in a financial
[1:00:05] capacity that you all are able to see
[1:00:08] how quickly that you all may may be able
[1:00:11] to assess and look out for that handup
[1:00:15] and begin to see things in a different
[1:00:19] lens right that we could we could have
[1:00:22] that mindset that we don't just want
[1:00:26] enough but we are in a position to
[1:00:29] validate that God is God and he could
[1:00:32] perform a miracle that is beyond our our
[1:00:36] dreams that is beyond the expectations
[1:00:38] so he doesn't want us programmed to just
[1:00:41] be living today for today when it is
[1:00:45] that he is more than able to be able to
[1:00:47] supply your weeks need your month's need
[1:00:49] your year needs your legacy your
[1:00:51] children's children and that's why it
[1:00:54] says a good man
[1:00:56] leaves an inheritance for his children's
[1:00:59] children so there's there's a there's a
[1:01:01] inherent nobility and and righteousness
[1:01:05] to thinking
[1:01:08] ahead and I know that I would have
[1:01:10] quoted the scripture in one of the
[1:01:12] sessions before that the the wise man
[1:01:15] foresee it
[1:01:19] evil and avoids
[1:01:21] it right so we need to be able to
[1:01:24] position ourselves in a place where it
[1:01:26] is that we can live such Christian lives
[1:01:29] that we could we could maintain
[1:01:30] relational values that we are able to be
[1:01:34] able to turn things around and not when
[1:01:38] things collapse and this is something
[1:01:40] that I see all right sometimes yes
[1:01:43] things might be a little shaky certain
[1:01:45] places of your life but that is not a
[1:01:48] reason for you to close the door on
[1:01:50] everybody else that mean that don't mean
[1:01:52] that you don't have oil that could be
[1:01:55] valuable to some somebody
[1:01:58] else but some people they close the door
[1:02:01] and they say listen I don't want anybody
[1:02:03] to know that I having a hard time so
[1:02:07] instead of saying good morning and hello
[1:02:10] and how are you and hey I hope that I
[1:02:11] having a good day they're walking
[1:02:13] straight because because they because
[1:02:16] they don't want somebody to ask them
[1:02:17] well how I'm like well how it is are you
[1:02:19] going well in this story here we see how
[1:02:21] valuable that it is for you to grow a
[1:02:23] network of friends for you to have a
[1:02:26] testimony that persons would maintain
[1:02:28] relational value with you to be able to
[1:02:31] be kind to be able to be a good
[1:02:33] neighbor
[1:02:34] and and so on Amen so thank you and I
[1:02:40] hope that this was a great session for
[1:02:43] you all as the last session for this
[1:02:45] year of things pertaining to life and to
[1:02:47] Godliness I trust that that some of the
[1:02:51] things from this session that you will
[1:02:53] share it like with others and that it
[1:02:55] might be able to impact their life and
[1:02:57] leave them in a positive light right
[1:02:59] let's stand and sing a song and give God
[1:03:03] some glory
[1:03:10] amen amen let's put our hands together
[1:03:13] this evening praise God you appreciate
[1:03:16] about Andrew over in praise God
[1:03:19] hallelujah thank you
[1:03:21] Jesus amen and amen
[1:03:25] You Are God Alone from Before Time began
[1:03:28] amen what a session this evening amen
[1:03:30] you feel like you've been
[1:03:32] edified you know one of my favorite
[1:03:34] Parts I think was um shut the door shut
[1:03:36] the door and po yeah I like that part a
[1:03:39] lot and um you know there's a process to
[1:03:42] things to getting things done you know
[1:03:45] and God wants to give you the secrets to
[1:03:47] to be able to get Victory and to
[1:03:50] maintain your Victory and to get more
[1:03:52] Victory you know and it comes out of a
[1:03:54] process you know and sometimes we don't
[1:03:57] value that enough you know you know um
[1:04:00] things are so easy to get now you know
[1:04:03] and um everything we wear right now
[1:04:05] everything we have around us went
[1:04:07] through a process to get it you know the
[1:04:09] clothes you wear and the shoes you have
[1:04:10] on your feet someone put that together
[1:04:12] someone stitched it glued it stuck it
[1:04:15] made it it went through a a conveyor
[1:04:17] belt a process to get it to your front
[1:04:21] front door um you know but we live in
[1:04:23] such a world where we don't really uh
[1:04:26] appreciate this these things everything
[1:04:28] is a dime a dozen but there once was a
[1:04:30] time ago when things weren't so easily
[1:04:32] acquired you know and um the process to
[1:04:35] get to things um was a bit more
[1:04:37] appreciated because it took a lot of
[1:04:39] effort and time now things are
[1:04:42] mass-produced uh but even the cell phone
[1:04:44] you use went through a testing phase
[1:04:47] before it came into your hand they
[1:04:48] couldn't just give you a cell phone you
[1:04:49] had to make sure it work somebody had to
[1:04:51] run it make sure the hard drive work
[1:04:52] make sure the processor work so the
[1:04:54] thing is we have to be tested also and
[1:04:56] tried we have to be proven to be the
[1:04:59] right kind of people and God will give
[1:05:01] us pass us through processes to
[1:05:03] strengthen us and give us that oil and
[1:05:06] we all have to discover what our oil is
[1:05:08] and so I just pray this evening that it
[1:05:10] was really a blessing we certainly thank
[1:05:11] you so much again brother
[1:05:13] andreid amen and I just pray that the
[1:05:17] holy spirit will continue to deal with
[1:05:18] us and help us to grow to show us what
[1:05:21] our oil is and what our value is and
[1:05:24] what we could give what we could do
[1:05:26] for for others and for the Lord that we
[1:05:28] could be a blessing wherever we go amen
[1:05:31] let's just praise God as we lift our
[1:05:32] hands and sing Oh You Are God
