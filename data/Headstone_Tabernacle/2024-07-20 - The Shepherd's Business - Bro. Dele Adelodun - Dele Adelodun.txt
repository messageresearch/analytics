Shem Ali and brother Ruland Sam is here God bless you and welcome so tonight we have Brother D going to speak speaking tonight and I know that you're going to be blessed and before he comes brother Andrew Fong we're going to come and and greet you uh before but com but before that scripture I like to read from Romans 1014 and 15 how then shall They Call On Him whom they have not believed how how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but Bram Jesus said he that receives them that I send receives me and now them that he send and them that receives me receive him that sent me I wish I had time to Ling on that you can only serve God as you do and believe the servants that God sends you can only serve God on Earth as God's servants that is sent on Earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you amen you believe that amen so it's good to see see it this way if God put a little peace in this brother put a little piece in that other brother little pieces and when the brothers come together the Pieces come together and presents a vision or a picture then you would truly realize we need one another and you can't discard the pieces regardless of what you think if this one is a dollar and that's one is a penny a penny can still could get changed might be a silver dollar but a penny could still get changed so then we ought not to discard this one right of this one God is good and let's sing that song God is so good as brother Fon come to us God is so good God is so good let's sing it God let all s but Andrew God they so [Music] good God is so [Music] good I love him so [Music] I could we lift our hands love [Music] so I love him so he so good to he set me free he set me [Music] free said set be free he set be free he so good to [Music] me hallelujah praise the Lord amen it's good to be free tonight amen if there's anybody that is free is the believer amen amen God bless you just to read a portion of God's word taken from 2 Corinthians chapter 5 for we know for we know if this if that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle would disolve we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heaven am for in this we grown earnestly desire ing to be clothed upon with our house with my house your house which is from Heaven may God bless your hearts you may be seated it falls my portion to just precede brother Deli but brother bad Deli at the at the LA he needs no introduction to trinad anymore so my job is very easy Vero is just a let them know he's coming to speak and I'm just to say a few words amen not to make up time but to just encourage our hearts you know yesterday there was a major glitch in the internet system around the world it shut down thousands of flights around the world banking systems were shut down and a whole lot of financial institutions were affected because a man-made system Fall Apart but we have a system that we have been introduced to amen that is foolproof no virus can affect it no Cyber attack could come against it amen because I believe that we have had the greatest scientist Of All Times amen even greater than Albert Einstein has come in our day yes sir amen amen because he was connected brother Stefan us talk about a realm this realm down here we contacted a lot of us uh if we want information we go Google anything you want go Google they have the answer but we have a guide called the Holy Spirit Hallelujah it is better than the best GPS system Hallelujah it never misdirects you amen amen some people live on Facebook but we've got a message amen lot of people follow Hollywood you see they in a realm that they're connected to amen but we've got a Bible some people depend on WhatsApp to communicate we've got a prayer line the connection cannot be broken the system don't fall down it itj it's not B mobile or whatever system you operating that Wonder there's no break in transmission there's transmission and receiving station all over God bless us amen you know the prophet said he preached a message from a cigarette pack entitled a thinking man's filter amen so you could filter out everything in this realm so you are bombarded all the time amen but you are connected to another realm a greater realm than the realm that is around us amen and that realm is go is God it's his word in the message who is this m said you have heard from your theophany amen so you are connected to our theophany and there's information your word body is communicating with you may God help us Amen in the in 1956 in the message Revelation the book of symbols but here's what brother brah said he said Angelic being associate together he say I hope you get that that just jop drop down free Angelic beings we are in association here this afternoon you are Angelic beings associating amen amen amen and if if you have got the holy spirit in you then you are a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural if a candidate mean you were nominated you were selected and you are qualified for that position so you are qualified to contact the supernatural the Unseen World we have to be so connected amen that the supernatural becomes natural that the Unseen World becomes visible you know there's a story brother Braham tells of a woman from Memphis and she had a son she grew him out to the best of her ability and then he took a turn in life and he went wrong and he was sick and he was DED the doctor said he said mom don't call me back your son is died right don't call me back he's going to die and she down in prayer amen she had a connection to another realm amen and in with that connection it was so powerful that she said Lord she went to the word amen and she saw where she was in the word she said I am like that shunamite woman amen and if I am that woman then where is your Elijah she was so connected to that realm amen that death had to stand by the door and wait for two days amen that she defi that Dimension that lower Realm could not come and touch her am I love that kind of connection amen that's a powerful connection amen you can't defeat a connection like that hallelujah amen so that had to wait and here was God's Prophet he's traveling in a plane and he's passing over where she lived and this woman created a [Music] storm that grounded his plane in Memphis now our Prophet was also connected he was able to stop a storm but this storm that she started he couldn't stop that one amen and it brought the prophet to our home amen she knew he was coming she was so connected that she knew he was coming but he didn't know where he was going I believe that tonight we've got to know where we going we already have a message we have already have the Direction all the instruction all the information that is required to keep us connected and there is not going to be a glitch in the system Satan it is tamper proof and it is secure and it is determined to take us to that Dimension where my body is waiting and where your body is waiting my encouragement to you this afternoon is stay connected to that real may God bless your heart [Music] oh Hallelujah give him glory tonight oh

and uh we'll greet each other the way we should and uh we will go into the word uh we welcome ourselves into the house of the Lord tonight in the name of Jesus Christ John chapter 10 uh I'm sorry I have a long reading uh I want to read 30 verses if you don't mind amen by the time we finish reading Jesus our lord preaching to us we can close on it yeah but if you permit we'll say some few words on it and uh we'll trust that the Lord will help us but let's enjoy the sermon from the Lord himself John chapter 10 from verse 1 verily verily I say unto you he that enter not by the door into the sheep fold but clth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber a thief and a robber Jesus said so but it that entereth in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep to him the porter open it and the sheep hear his voice and he colth his own Sheep by name and leaded them out and when he puted forth his own sheep he goth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice so the proof of the sheep being the Sheep of this Shepherd is that they know his voice amen amen and a stranger will they not follow but we flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers this Parable spake Jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them then said Jesus unto them we want to try and understand it tonight if he will help us then said Jesus unto them verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers so it may not be one but as many as they are they are thieves and they are robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man enter him he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly I am the Good Shepherd I like that word Christ introduced himself he even qualified himself I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd give his life for the Sheep but he that is an harling and not the shepherd whose own the Sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the Wolf catched them and Scattered the Sheep the hiring fleeth because he is anhing and care not for the Sheep I am the Good Shepherd affirmatively and know my sheep and I'm known of mine as the father knoweth me even so know I the father and I lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd now that is the scripture that applies to you and I because his visible audience here was the Jewish Brethren are you following but he made it clear to them that other sheep I have they don't belong to the Jewish or the Samaritan food amen and I must bring them in also I'm glad he has those in mind and we have our appointed time an appointed season amen uh the Jews being preached to First did not give them a better Advantage he called the Jews his Brethren the Samaritans he called his friends but they gentiy call his bride among these three people who has the closest intimacy with a man come on friends so we have our appointed time we have our appointed season and in that season we must come in the seventh trumpet will bring in the Jew the seven seal will bring in the Gentile bride to the same atonement all right all right all right all right we just want to tell a story okay let's go on verse 17 therefore th my father love me because because I lay down my life that I might take it again no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again this commandment have I received of my father there was a division therefore again among the Jews for these Saints and many of them said he had the devil and is mad why hear him others said these are not the words of him that ha a devil can the devil Open the Eyes of the blind so it is their word against them and it was at Jerusalem the Feast of the dedication and it was Winter and Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch then came the Jews round about him and said unto him how long does thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly Jesus answered them you know they were saying tell us plainly as if they will believe Jesus answered them I told you and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me our voice is connected to followership here all right please take not not and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man plug them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to plug them out of my father's hand I and that my father are one may the Lord add His blessings to the read of his holy word God bless you you may please be seated we want to thank the Lord very much again uh tonight uh and this time thank you musicians God bless you s amen uh tonight and this season for the privilege the Lord give unto us to gather in his presence again amen and uh we want to specially thank our dear pastor uh Theo ID and his associate brother Isaac oid brother Tony ministers and all the rest the board of the church the entire Saints uh for their accommodation their invitation to us uh to come and rejoice at the feet of Christ one more time at this time uh a lot of things and a lot of spending sacrifices in time energy resources go in to this amen uh but I know uh the things that God honor most are things that go with one sacrifice of the other I want them to know which I know they know but I'm affirming it assuredly that God will never forget your Libor of love all that you are doing for the kingdom uh they are investments and God will repay you back in several fold in the name of Jesus Christ like the prophet we say they have done their part and it is for we that come to really take advantage of this opportunity uh to EMB better our lives and I believe through the preaching of the word and fellowship one with one another uh we will go home better than we came greetings thank you greetings to everyone who had come from everywhere uh you're coming both in the Highland and outside the country uh it's a blessing and it's an encouragement to any servant of God who stands behind the sacred desk I say it everywhere that uh the gospel is not meant for cheers of our benches it is meant for human beings so it is always a privilege when the Lord give us people to speak to and we will never take that for granted we will do our best uh in the grace that God give unto us uh to be a blessing or at least to be of service to the people of God thank you for coming you encourag me tonight ton amen I bring the greetings of the Saints back in Nigeria a good portion of them is represented here and many others many more others who couldn't come uh told us to pass their greetings both the Servants of God and our congregations and all the loved ones they told us to give their greetings to the convention some said I should mention their name but you see if I mention them I don't know in fact one or two of them stress it I forgotten their name right now so just uh just take it that uh the names that I didn't the names I couldn't mention send greetings so if anybody says did you if you meet anyone and he says did he pass our greeting just help me put it together he passed their greetings so and the Lord will bless you as you give me a cover God bless you uh we want to thank the Lord for all the Servants of God uh that have gone before uh before me I was telling uh this great men of God before after they finish praying with me and they come into the audience uh I said uh the men of God the preachers have preached uh what we are to do we 2x4 is just to do a buffer to encourage the people then Pastor L was saying if you are talking like that how about me I said I said you are father preacher so there not so so we we trust with the Lord that he will help us one more time so if God will be our help which I trust he will tonight and um I just want to speak just to encourage you on a subject I called The Shepherd's business amen the shepherd's business the business of the shepherd amen the sheep has his own business the shepherd has his own business and it's nice for us not to confuse the two activity so if we stay in our lane and the shepherd stay in his Lane life will be a lot easier so that's what I trust that he will help us in the time we have before us our Lord is preaching here and he said verily verily I say unto you he that entered North by the door into the ship fold but climed of some other way the same is a thief and a robber now this particular verse is not referring to the Sheep who straight into the ship fold this particular verse is referring to a Shepherd uh who tries to impersonate the real Shepherd all right so it's not a scripture for the Sheep it's a scripture for the shepherd Jesus Christ want you to know very affirmatively that he is the only Shepherd onefold one Shepherd amen now then you will turn to this side I'm glad they are sitting here thank you they love me so well they haven't sat here before now but they realize how weak I am and they choose to back me up God bless you s thank you I appreciate that now then you may look here or you look into the audience and say but what about our pastors you call them the right name they our pastors amen Pastor has a pastoral service the Pastoral service is for them to feed the sheep on behalf of the owner of the sheep the owner of the sheep is the shepherd but pastors are those engaged to Fe the sheep on behalf of the shepherd so it is not their business to look for the food for the Sheep it is the shepherd's business he must furnish the food then they will feed the sheep so I'm not attacking their position they are pastors but I'm talking of the shepherd all right so he said there if a Shepherd is laying claim to a Sheepfold a Sheepfold is an environment the collection of sheep and he did not lay claim to itat by the right form of purchase he is a thief and a robber because something must qualify you to be The Shepherd of the sheep are you with me now what qualifies in this case is that there must be a purchase and the purchased price in this case is the price of death that releases the blood I want us to follow me you will just follow the story that releases the priz of the blood now I know today there are people who are willing to die for the cause that they believe in so dying today is not a big deal we've seen politicians we've seen activists we've seen great people and we've seen people with dear that as I can die over this matter and they will die but in this particular case your death will be a waste of time because you must not only be able to Die the price you are offering by your death must have the capacity to be accepted [Applause] if your price is not acceptable you cannot lay claim to this sheep so death is fine but the price that comes from your death is what we are looking at are you following and uh uh brother Stephan said we on a campaign ground yeah I love that and there's a campaign to T night between a stranger and a Good Shepherd I want you to know the side I belong to quickly I'm on the side of the Good Shepherd so I'm going to campaign for him and I'm going to demaret the [Applause] stranger I will demaret him I will make him unattractive for you so that if you have been follow him you throw him away so you know this stranger there's just one impostor because there's only one guy who wanted to lay claim to the Sheep just as the Lord so when Christ is talking here he knew who he was referring to amen for now I will call him the stranger all right this stranger in the Book of Ruth was offered an opportunity to purchase amen because boas was not the first person who has the right to redeem Ruth do you realize that why because in Genesis 3 somebody brought about Genesis 3 somebody occasions the fall amen and the person who occasions the fall introduce a nature that makes us children of Wrath so by being children of Wrath he became qualified to have a f chance at you and high amen I told you last year that that is why everybody who died including the Saints he wants to lay claim to their body amen until Christ uh you know Archangel Michael had to dispute the body of Moses because he's got a future work with him are you following all right so this men was offered Redemption but this stranger love to take possession possession without willing to pay the price of possession so when he was offered he was exited then boa said if you will redeem this you must be ready to do this then the stranger said no I cannot do it and attempt to do it with M my inheritance he said boys go ahead so this stranger was not willing to pay the price yet he wanted possession let me tell you Satan is not ready to pay your price but he wanted your possession let me tell you your value is too high to be taken by the devil cheaply this is why Jesus Christ said he's an impostor he's a thief and a robber he's a thief and a robber that wants to enjoy something without willing to pay for him he wants to steal it when it was not given so that's what that's what this verse is referring to and the Lord said be very very weary of him be very very wey of him let's continue let's continue and he said he that enter him by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep so Satan The Stranger does not want to enter by the door he doesn't want to meet the price he couldn't stand the Pains of gsim many he couldn't stand the Pains of Calvary and yet he wanted a lordship in your life it's not possible your Redemption wasn't a cheap thing so you cannot cheapen your life your worth and your value is too great amen don't throw away your virtue for pennies don't throw it away for iPhones Hallelujah you have a greater value than that your Redemption wasn't cheap it ca God his own life and you have more worth to God than his own blood that was why he was willing to give up his blood so that he can help you Mr stranger you are in trouble tonight because I will demaret you so [Applause] bad he that entereth in by the door that is a real Shepherd there was only one who entered him by the door he first gets him many and he has to battle over his own will as 100% man or the will of father as 100% God and I can hear Jesus said not my will let thy will be done and he went to the cross of Calvary and he paid the price and he declared it is finished the Bible said the one that entered in by the door is the one to whom the porter opens to when the price is accepted the poters have no option they've got to open the door that was why when Jesus said it is finished Hallelujah three things happen in three different dimensions on Earth in heaven and in hell oh Hallelujah on Earth the veil of the temple rented the port has opened [Applause] the cherubims who were guarding the part of the tree of life they had to their short they have to step aside for the man who is qualified to come inside The Potters of God open underneath the Earth the Bible said his body was placed in the grave but his soul continued his work he he treaded through the wine press of the RO of God brother Brown said I can see him traveling in Dimensions he went into the realm of demons he said you are too small for me you don't have what I want step aside then he got to the of the Devil Himself and he says Satan give me the key why should I give you the key my price is up there I offer the priz it has been accepted even your agents on Earth erod are inclusive and the pilot inclusive they declared they find no fault in me so I am a worthy sacrifice no wonder the elders in Revelation 5 said Worthy is the Lamb that was slain Glory Hallelujah Worthy is a lamb that was slain Glory Hallelujah so I meet the price I meet the qualification my price has been accepted you ain't got no right to hold the key brother Braham said I can see Satan resulting into sterile recrimination is a stal one because it doesn't matter he said when I killed Isaiah I thought I heard you when I killed Ezekiel I thank God those Brethren they lived so much until their life became the identity of Christ and Satan was confused hey that is for another day but take that home that you can live so well and Satan won't know the difference between you and Jesus that is what the message of the hour is to achieve in our lives amen he said when I killed this I thought I have you he said but now I have you Jesus said you will have you may have enough time later for this your weak testimony but right now what I need is the key and me the key why will he take the key because some people must be unlocked Porters must open Abraham is under lock Sarah is under lock all those great Saints are under lock and they must be released because they died in the hope of the promise of the coming Messiah and brother Brown said I can see him give him a terrible kick and before the devil could wake up from his kicking Slumber God took Christ took the key and went straight to the right places he first went to the region of the Lost The Fifth Dimension he knocked at their door and when they open to say you know what I was the one Noah preached because the Bible says since the long suffering of the days of Noah I was the I was the H that Noah preached which you rejected oh you have come we want you now he said it is too late Souls that are in prison now it is too late I just come here to witness to you you that Noah was right and you were wrong Ezekiel was right and you were wrong Isaiah was right but you were wrong Jeremiah was right but you are wrong Enoch was right but you are wrong and from there he moved to the sixth Dimension and he began to knock at the door and the door the pter has to open you know why he's qualified he's the great Shepherd and I can hear Abraham say yes who is knocking he said I am the one that when he spoke it was a familiar voice he said Sarah come come come do you remember that one that appeared to us in the plane of mamory that said I will visit you according to the time of life he right there at the door and how they came Hallelujah when he kned at Isaiah when Isaiah heard the voice he said I know he will come because I told my generation I told them that a virgin shall conceive unto us a son is a TI is born unto us a son is given he's right at the door Ezekiel saw him as the middle in the wheel in the middle of the way all of them wants to be having a good time Jesus said you know what you will have enough time because I have an appointment 72 hours must not expire before I get out so that my work is not broken he said come right along and they came on the head with him the porters opened all doors until tonight's they will open relative to this age oh my before I come to this age hold on hold on hold on when the port has open it brought all the saints because the Bible said when he said it is finished the graves no matter how tight they were sealed they became hoping Preparatory for what Resurrection because the pters must open and on Earth for about 30 to 40 days he had a post-resurrection Ministry after which he decided to go up and the Bible said he ascended in his Rapture with thousand times thousands of the Saints and they got to the gate of glory and the Saints behind him began to sing lift your Gat ye po has open and they said who is open to the King of Kings said who is the king he said the Lord Mighty in battle oh he still the Lord Mighty in batt and the pters of Heaven also opened and in these last days we were loged in the house of hell and there was nobody who could open us it has to be somebody who brings to us the ministry of the shepherd reincarnated uhhuh because the ministry of the shepherd you see that is why he said I have other people I have other Sheep amen now these other sheep are to be brought in by the exact Ministry of Christ in Luke 17:30 he said his person will not be here but his ministry will be here so it is of necessity that a son of man must come to reveal the son of man that was why in these last days when we were locked in the house of Hell the only person we were calling onto was brother Braham did you remember that Vision do you remember that dream he said brother Brown help us help us help us help us and what do they want they want to be unlocked they want the gates to open they want the pters to open and brother Brown became qualified because he carried the voice of God in the ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated underline that in your heart he wasn't a person of Christ but oh in the message Souls that are imprisoner he said if you call me the person of Christ you make me an antichrist but if you said the ministry exact Ministry that cried out has been reincarnated today he said that is what the Brethren believe I believe with them Hallelujah so he carried that Ministry to do what to bring in the other sheep who were outside the fold when he was preaching in John chapter 10 and they were saying Help Us brother brah and that is was say only you can help us and by the voice of the grace she he said House of Hell House of Hell House of hell give way to the name of the Lord and the poters open again and the ships were coming out the ships were coming out that is why you are here tonight because you were represented in that Vision to him the portal open [Applause] [Applause] it Hallelujah he has a sheep for friend and he said when he puted forth his own sheep he go before them oh man it doesn't send them on an erand that he is not responsible for he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him we're coming to something now for they know his voice are you here the followership of this Shepherd is by his voice look let me tell you to follow the shepherd today you must know his [Applause] voice I'm talking to spiritual people to follow the shepherd today you will soon see who the real sheep are H to follow the shepherd today you must know his voice and Jesus was saying it confidently because he knew that the ship is programmed Hallelujah to listen to no other person the womb of their mind is sealed to any other thing than the voice of the shepherd hey hey hey you saw him you can hear him repeatedly saying it that this sheep know my voice and a stranger so the stranger also has his voice but they will never follow the voice of a stranger because there's an imbu spiritual mechanism Beyond five senses to decode every hero when the stranger came to St Martin when the stranger came to St Martin in the seven Church ages you know what happened because he's an impostor he dressed perfectly he used the Bible to dress himself so his appearance was very scriptural if you look at him you look at the Bible the same that is how deadly that is how dangerous this stranger can be the stranger we are talking about is not outside the message the the ones outside the message can't do much amen you can challenge them what do you know in the Bible but the stranger I'm talking about is the one that has step up the game he will carry the Bible with a spoken [Applause] word Satan is too deadly brother Braham said he studies you by your weapon he knows the way your mind runs and he attacks You by that [Applause] strangers in Malachi 4 that was why when he appeared to St Martin I'm repeating again its appearance from head to toe my brother very scriptural underline it in your mind so here is Martin looking at the Creator and looking at his bible and they seem to be the same so the power are not to be deceived is beyond your five senses there must be a programmed Divine mechanism that is why Christ knew what he has put in you that was why he said if it were possible he said the time will be so tough Matthew 24:24 that if it were possible these two spirits being so close the elect will be deceived but I thank God it is not possible it will not be possible never ever ever because you know why you know why Christ already had a Thanksgiving over you he said father I thank you for all you gave me I lose none he cannot withdraw his Thanksgiving he lost none means he lost none H Allelujah so all right so as M was looking at the scripture looking at him that guy was pleading worship me worship me that is the craving of the devil worship worship worship he was pressuring him worship me but something was checking M even though he looks but Waits does that wait upon the Lord as he was waiting as he was waiting the grace of God came down and what did the grace do he show to him from the same scripture in the message Christ is revealed in his own word brother Braham said no matter how true something looks it must go through three things there must be no mislocation misinterpretation and misrepresentation he said this guy you are looking at he has crossed two holders but there's a mislocation because the crown on his head the same Bible he read said that it is you it is you it is I it is you that will crown him King of Kings Lord of lords this one is already crowned ask him how he got his crown the word the word of God God will defeat the Devil anytime anywhere under any circumstance Hallelujah by the time M ask him how did you get your crown The Stranger knew he was exposed he ran away hallelujah hallelujah this is how deadly The Stranger will be but this sheep I'm repeating because the Good Shepherd says so he said they know my [Applause] voice so it is important for us to find out his voice when we are following the Voice automatically we are the Sheep of his Sheepfold Hallelujah let me give you a type so that you will begin to understand it I don't know much but I can explain by type all right in the first Exodus when the shepherd was ready to lead The Exodus people out he called them into a contract he said this road you are going I'm going to be the leader so he came down as the pillar of Fire EX CH 23 God walked the consciousness of those people he said behold I send my angel that angel was the pillar of fire I sent my angel before thee to lead you in the way he said Beware of him don't argue with [Applause] him for my name is in him whatever he says do no matter how strongly opinionated you are you must have no thought coming just accept what he says no matter how hard how illogical how unreasonable lean not to your own understanding but there's a problem there's a problem this pillow of fire is not visible and yet is to lead the journey so how can we follow a leader we are not seeing are you catching that are you catching that this leader we don't see him and we are not to and we are to follow him if we will enter into the promise are we not in problem God say you are not in problem I know what I'm doing then he brought a messenger they call called him Moses what was Moses to do to humanize the leadership of the pillar of fire because Moses by Design he was designed with the capacity to see the pillar of fire Paul the same William Braham the same Paul was second Exodus William Bram is Third Exodus these men were designed to see the pillar of fire that was why when people come to the prayer line the only thing they experience is feeling brother Braham said we say are you feeling very good and nice they will say yes he said you see that angel of the Lord that Pillar of Fire I talk about is just 2T away from you that is why you are feeling that way he is seeing him but the people feeling it were not seeing him so somebody's eyes must be programmed to see the pillar of fire in the first Exodus it was Moses so it follows that Moses will hear from the pillar of fire and whatever he hears he will declare to the people so it became the voice of God to the people my sheep hear mine [Music] voice so the voice was Moses but the content of the voice was God you must not miss that you must not miss that the voice they were hearing was Moses but what Moses was saying wasn't Moses it was God if you take it as the words of Moses you will finish your journey in the wilderness if you want to go all the way through you must take the content of the voice as the word of God Paul warned his own people he said that which I receive from the Lord the same I deliver without addition or suppression in these last days will Abraham said I was not the one that appeared at Ohio River I was only the person that was near did he say so he said a man is word will fail you are not feeding on me but you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man somebody said that in these last days somebody said I am God's voice to you did he say so he said the first time I said it under inspiration and I can see people resenting it he said let me say it again I am God's voice unto you he said when I was growing up because my parents were drunker than unbelievers many people have no use for me when they see me on one side of the street they will cross to the other side he said but today by Amazing Grace Hallelujah I will have to run away from my house from people who were willing to see me he said because God has given me the charge to direct the Bride of this day so God's bride director God's voice for today is the prophet of the hour so for you to be a true sheep to follow this Shepherd you must know that voice that voice is a person it's a messenger [Applause] do you know why this is important friends let me tell you why this is important you say I should tell you it is the voice that can keep you in the Rage of atonement you will see what it means now you see when they left Egypt let's start from there again do you know there are many roads that led to Canaan did you realize that spiritual people are responding they said that's right they know their Bible amen I have traveled from Israel to Egypt traveling by the borders of red SE SE and I never crossed the Red Sea and I entered Egypt the Bible said there is a shorter distance to Canaan which is the highway of the Philistines is it in your Bible like that when Joseph and his Brethren went to bury Jacob their father after he died in Egypt they didn't have to cross the Red Sea what does that tell you my brother my sister there may be many routes but that does not mean each route is an option for the believer your Shepherd selected the part you must stret my Bible told me that God chose to lead them by the way of the Red [Applause] Sea do you know as long as they follow God's Divine Direction by his voice they will be under the atonement hey before the journey started God dedicated that Journey with an atonement that is why brother Braham said the blood of the Passover lamp was applied at the lint and the door post the prophet said they were making the sign of the cross the cross has been with us right from the beginning because the Redemption plan was not an accidental plan it was a plan conceived in eternity and God has put his people under Shadow blood and the real blood through time and ages because it's got to be the blood cover when Abraham was to start his journey with him he brought him first under the atonement right you didn't catch that Genesis chter 15 he told him when Abraham wanted a deal with God where we shall I know that you are going to keep your promise so that this walk between me and you can be seamless we know where we are going God said no problem kill your Bullock exactly divide it into two exactly but after you have done that had for me T do and pigeon brother brah said t do and pigeons represent atonement and healing you you know why God knew that along the journey it is Abraham that will not be able to keep his part God is faithful he will never fail but man will fail and God knew that but God wanted a situation that no matter the failure of man he will still keep his promise did you hear what I'm saying this is why brother Brown said the Covenant gave to Adam was conditional but when he came to Abraham unconditional he said it is not what you do it is what I have done if you can accept what I have done it ends the matter if you can stay under the atonement it ends the matter and to every child of God in our walk with him it is atonment that comes first before our work because God knows we will do things that will make him that will make it impossible for him to keep his promise but he is determined to keep his promise Hallelujah whether you fail or not and you can cut me anywhere he is determined to keep his promise is a Abraham put it it's all there for me you know why Abraham knew that God knew that Abraham will lie he knew that he will make a poor excuse of a husband he will deny his wife and instead of calling him wife he will call him sister he knew Abraham will backslide and go to Egypt he knew he would do those things but you see oh my by the atonment everything Adam will do Abraham will do it's already taken care of are you with me by the atonement that was why when his obituary was written later the Bible says Abraham St up nuts at the promise of God because of unbelief how many read it in their Bible but I can can show you from that same Bible where Abraham staggered in Genesis chapter 17 when God was talking about the promise son you say Sarah smiled within herself but Abraham did the worse one he laughed to the face of God it must have been God what are you talking what do you mean let is Man live before you and go that was enough to block the promise but God was determined when Sarah argued with God and told God I did not smile that was enough to block the promise but I told me stand in the second Exodus God knew what Peter will do do you realize he said Peter with all this your sh again you b s you did all this he said before the co cre you will deny me three times Peter said me me Peter The Rock maybe if you are talking of somebody like brother Thomas maybe that is possible but not somebody like me God said Jesus say okay we will see how it goes but said you know what I don't mind your shenan what I have done is I have prayed for you he offered him Advan atonement but do you know do you know he also knew that Judas will betrayed him and he never offered him anything why did he offer Peter why did he pray for Peter and he did not pray for Judas my sheep know my if you don't if you don't belong to to him he is not obligated to you thank God I belong to him I'm so glad I belong to Jesus I'm so glad I belong to Jesus when was the lamb slain brother Isaac when was the lamb SL SL when was the lamb slain before the foundation of the before the foundation of the w why did why did he have to slay the lamb in his mind before before you came to make it necessary for the lamb to die God knowing what you will do he offered you an advance atonement that was why that was why when they wanted to start that Exodus Journey he said give me the blood of the Passover and they offered it and they said you know what you do for me apply the blood on the lint and on the door post brother Braham said that was a sign of the cross even before Calvary so this Exodus people carried the cross with them oh and because they were carrying the atonement what will keep them enjoying the blessings of atonement is the voice that will keep them in lineah so minding the Shepherd by his voice is critical to your Survivor when he L them by way of the Red Sea amen by of the Red Sea means by way of the Red Sea and that's why when they got to Red Sea no more way it was a dead end but these were people hallelujah under atonement they didn't get there by themselves they were following the voice before you attack a man find out how you go to where he is brother brah said challenges of Life do not come only because we have we done wrong did you hear me our wrongs can bring us into problem but it is not every problem that is caused by a wrong you might be following God's leadership and yet find yourself at a dead end see in the front Pharaoh behind Hills and Valleys on either side following the pillar of Fire by his voice hallah whether you like it or not that is the range of atonement then that is why God took responsibility for their safety if you want God to take responsibility if you want atonement to Avail for you to meet your needs to save your soul to heal your body to change your situation you must follow the voice [Applause] you must follow the [Applause] voice hallu brother BR said of this age you know we have the Feast of the trumpet and brother Braham said six trumpets sounded under the six seal he said but the seventh one is to be sended by Moses and Elijah in order to call Israel after we go into the Rapture into the atonement he said but that is exactly what the seven seal did to [Applause] us he called us to the genuine atonement to the blood of the Lamb who was shed at Calvary it was the opening of the seals that brought the blessings of Calvary to you that was why the day brother Brown was preaching the bridge between the seven Church ages and the opening of the seals he said the lamb is about ready tonight to take the book and make Redemption claims because for 2,000 years he has been interceding for the ignorance of his people that is why Luther will make it despite his teaching that is why Wesley will make it despite his teaching and all those reformers will make it despite their teaching because the lamp was interceding for 2,000 years for their ignorance but the moment he got up ignorance was perfectly interceded for because the lamp opened the book in order to do what make Redemption claims to call your own name supernaturally he said the shepherd called them by their names you may not hear Zoe but you didn't hear Zoe but you are here tonight something called you something called you something called you something called you something called you you heard your name supernaturally what is he calling you to he's calling you to the genuine atonement we where you can be under the blood cover of Jesus Christ for your safety for your provision for your life's journey for your shielding against every attack you can only get that under the voice that open the seals no other messenger no other messenger open the seals they attempted but they failed can they take in said have you ever seen somebody who went into the Book of Revelation and come out alive but thank God we saw somebody William Brown entered he came out alive and he brought us inside because is the voice of God the voice of the shepherd to us in this [Applause] [Music] day if you want God to be personally obligated to you if you want the shepherd to meet your needs follow his voice you know this our GPS that you have and you put in your radio and your cars do you don't see the S the woman or the man okay let me use the man because some brothers will feel offended by that they said I can't allow a woman to be leading me so they will change the voice of the GPS from that of a woman to a man suit yourself anyone you want it is okay but you realize you don't see the fellow that's right you are only following the voice did you realize it and if you follow the voice diligently nine or eight out of 10 times they land you safely the margin of error is because it is human's achievement amen amen but in God's economy there's no margin of error so you may not see the shepherd but if you can follow his voice you will arrive safely just the same my sheep know my voice have you known his voice do you know his voice then you are a sheep only one thing left follow that voice diligent G ly Faithfully to bring you under the atonement bring your family under the atonement by following what the message says the message plays you sister it plays you brother even in your family it arrang it very well your position in the home is position in the home when you both follow it Faithfully you have brought your family under the [Applause] atonement in the house of God the word of the Lord told us how to be in the house of the Lord amen if we follow it Faithfully we have come under the atonement let me say this whether you pray or you do not pray I'm not supporting on prayer don't misunderstand me Hallelujah As Long as You Follow what he says you are automatically under the blood there are benefits in following the shepherd I will come to it let me tap it for you again going back to the Old Testament for you to see the importance of following what the voice of the shepherd says even when it doesn't look like it makes sense in the Bible God told Israel as they were journeying he said any time you get to a place where you want to relax before the next challenge before the next myone he said you must speach according to my instruction if you go in your Bible you will see how God emphasizing ping he said the Tabernacle you know they carry that Ark he said you must put it in the center there is a group then he divided Israel into three amen into three groups into three you know three three to make four groups is that right so three in each group and each group has a tribal Edge is that right and he said one must be in the north the other in the East the other in the west and the other in the South he said whenever you want to move if it is Southward you are going you must move according to that picture meaning the people of the South will lead the journey and all of us will be following like that if it is not it is the same thing it might not make sense to the people you understand but let me show you how it made sense when they came to Moab can you bring us the pictures I want to show you something Hallelujah you can see the picturing for those who can see you can see the one in the north you can see the one in the south you can see the one in the west you can see the one in the East is that right look at it for a while now the figures you were seeing there were the figures in the Bible these were the numbers after all some certain judgments and decimations at this time Koran and Abram many of them have been destroyed yes sir but they are ready now to enter Moab so God did numbering and he said the people that will be in the south will be led by reuben reuben Simeon and God they were 15 1,450 in the west you have ephra manasi and Benjamin 108,000 in the in the west I mean in the north you have Dan Asha and Nali 157,00 in the East you have Judah isak and Zebulon 186,000 and they said the Tabernacle of the congregation put it in the middle yes sir this was the way Israel moved throughout their Journey does this make sense it's not making sense yet it doesn't make sense okay let's let's move on give us the next one you will see where it makes sense now you will see what balam saw that made it impossible for him to curse the people of Israel because when balac was carrying him amen I like the way he did it he carried him to the Pinacle and he said if you view them from here you'll be able to see their back Parts their front parts and every part and it will make curing easy now these folks might think that they were just following the routine but God's wisdom is greater than mine God knew what he was doing no matter which direction they cause them from you read in your Bible Numbers 22 numbers 23 it became impossible for balam to cause these people let's see okay move on you are seeing the counting you can go to your Bible I'm waiting you up time go to your Bible and do the numbering it is there amen go on keep joining with us move on all right you see the number amen okay move on okay this is the NS now give us the last that's the Tabernacle show us the last let's see what it forms what are you seeing there what are you seeing you can see that the North and the South they are similar in amount 151 157 then the West Was 108 then the East was the Plenty 186 the longer length of the Cross this was what balam saw just by Israel following instruction take your position like this so if God tells you as a husband this is your position if he tells you a wife this is your position if he tells you children this is your position you don't know the structure you are forming don't argue it just accept it now when balam saw this give us Numbers chapter 22 or chapter 23 this was what bam saw give us the Book of Numbers following the shepherd the voice of the shepherd is important Numbers Chapter 23 okay is that verse one give us 24 we'll come back to this 23 is that verse one give no no no I mean Numbers chapter 24 I want whichever is the chapter I want you to start from verse one is that 24 and when balam saw that he pleased the lord to bless Israel he went not as at other times you will see what said before this now to seek for enchantment uhhuh go on but he set his face towards the Wilderness and and balam lifted up his eyes and he saw Israel abiding in his tent according to their what so they pached according to their grouping just as the Lord said and the spirit of God Came Upon him uhhuh and he took up his Parable and said balam the son of be had said and the man whose eyes are open had said uhhuh he had said which had the words of of God which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open hallelujah how goodly are thy tense oh Jacob and thy Tabernacles oh Israel as the valleys are there spread forth as Gardens by the Riverside as the Trees of line allows which the Lord had planted Hallelujah and as seear trees beside the waters uh-huh he shall pour the water out of his b ET and his seed shall be in many Waters and his King shall be higher than aak and his kingdom shall be exalted amen amen continue brother God brought him forth out of Egypt he had as it we the strength of a unicor he shall eat up all he shall eat up the Nations his enemies and shall break their bones and Pierce them through with his sword now go back to 23 when he saw this whichever side he turn he was seeing the cross he was seeing the people under the atonement because God told them you see it looks like something ordinary he said Pitch this one in the NS pitch this one in the East pitch this one in the West Pitch this one in the in the South and anytime they are going if their direction is South the southern people will lead it so as to keep that arrangement if they coming read your Bible what I'm saying is in your Bible if they are going east the hastan people will lead it so as to keep the arrangement what was God doing by following in obedience to his instruction they were kept under that [Applause] atonment God who told them to pitch like that knew they were dangerous along the way this life battle you can't fight it by yourself oh man Numbers Chapter 23 okay maybe go to verse 13 because Bal balac became frustrated let's see if it's FAS and balac said unto him come I pray thee with me unto another place from when thou mayest see them thou shall see but the utmost part of them whether whether it is the utmost Part North is the utmost part South is the utmost part or west is the utmost part the vision is the same you will see the cross from every angle bring back the scripture we're still reading don't worry and shall not see them all and cause them cause me them from then ah and they brought him to the field of pisar to the p uh to the field of zofim to the top of pisar and built seven altars and offered a bulock and a ram on every Altar uhhuh and he said unto balang stand here by thy burnt offering while I meet the Lord Yonder and the Lord met Abraham and put word in his mouth and said go again unto balac and say th MH and when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of Moab with him and balac said unto him what had the Lord spoken and he took up his Parable and said rise up balac and here aing unto me thou Son of zipo God is not a man that is you lie neither the son of man that is you repent at he said and shall he not do it uhhuh or at he spoken and shall he not make it good uh-huh behold I have received commandment to bless you cannot C somebody who is under atonement your Cur is a waste of time I have received commandment to bless and he had blessed and I cannot it's irreversible your blessing because you know the voice of the Shepherd that places you under atonement you accepted the revealed World your blessing is irreversible when somebody is saying I will show you and you are shaken it's because you don't know who you are I'm giving you weapon now I'm weaponizing you go back to them tell them you will see nothing but the glory of God you are under the atonement and nothing can happen because you are under the voice of the shepherd let's continue let's continue he have not beheld iniquity in Jacob neither at his seen perverseness in Israel do you know why he couldn't see don't take this scripture away just leave it do you know why did it because they were under the Blood Brother Brown said red true red becomes white in the message on the wings of a snow white do he said do you know a true seed of God does not have sin imputed at all he said he is in the sinless one he is under the blood of the atonment how can you impute in on him these people were under the cross don't forget balam could see it well because it was taken so high amen he had not beheld iniquity him neither had his perverseness in Israel the Lord is God is with him and the shout of a king is among them hallah God brought them out of Egypt he had as it we the strength of a Unicon huh surely there is no enchantment do your enchantments amen against Jacob neither is there any divination they said they take your name to a coven and you are you are shaken you don't know who you are let me tell you I sleep easy you Africans glorify witches and wizard here is your deliverance if you are under the voice of the shepher there is no enchantment there is no divination you see how important it is to follow the voice of the shepherd it brings you under genuine atonement you are the crossbearer you Carri the cross all about and you don't know what your power is Israel positions thems to reflect Calvary and that was why when balam saw them despite the o to ca God said HH these ones are my people of Interest the shepherd must protect his sheep he is not an highing amen he an highing that will see danger and run from the Sheep this one will give his life when he closes the sheep for he lies in front he tells anything before you can get them cross me if you can cross me you will get my sheep but if I'm uncrossable you are wasting your time neither is there any divination against Israel according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel what had God WR your son will be see what the Lord has behold the people shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young lion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prayer Hallelujah that is your promise that was Israel promise because they abide by the voice of their Shepherd position yourself like this position yourself like this and unknown to them they were carrying the cross everywhere and they brought a man to look from high high and when he looked down what he saw was the cross I know it was the blood FRS exactly amenu so your business the shepherd will take care of you any time and look if he can give his life he can give anything he wants to take your responsibility more than you are ready to offer him are you with me Brethren this was a revelation David had when he said the Lord is my shepherd Brother s thank you for that bring it back again Psalm [Music] 23 Psalm 23 not number he said the Lord is my and David could say that you know why because he was God's model Shepherd Hallelujah God used many characters in The Bible to reflect one nature of himself or the other in terms of shepherd He used David and that was why abata became a blessed person when Saul became mad and he was killing all the priests the only place abata could run to was to David and David told him the man who is looking for your life he's also looking for mine he said but abide here with me with me you shall be in safety when The Lion and the bear came David never gave up he rised his life to save the Sheep even when Goliath came David became The Shepherd of Israel so he understood the concept of shepherd He said the Lord is my shepherd because the Lord is his shepherd He shall not want you live in want because you don't recognize your Shepherd amen it is the Shepherd that fishes the foot for his own Sheep amen the Sheep is an heless creator that was made to depend or depend on your Shepherd this is why your Shepherd said take no thought for what you will eat for what you will drink for what you'll be clothed by did he say so or not he said take no thought he said your heavenly father knows that you need these things and no good thing will live with told from his own that is how much the shepherd is willing to take your responsibility is see why he has to do it he said he make me to lie down in where he knows where the pasture is Green Oh my he leaded me beside the steel he knows where the water is [Applause] quiet it's all about him unless of you all he needs from you is a surrender then he will take care of your need you are serving the shepherd who is more willing to bless you to fight your battles than you are even ready oh how many we rely on him tonight He restored my soul he leaded me you will see why he's doing all this he leaded me in the path of righteousness for what is the one that his reputation is at stake if anything happen to me did you realize brother brah said it does not just see to it that you are saved he sees to e that you remain safe for his name the shepherd has a name to protect and it is a reproach for any Shepherd to lose a sheep that was why he left 9 and9 and was looking for the lost one everything is got to do for you is to protect his own reputation let me give you an example let me give you an example if you have a car my brother come here my brother amen sorry are you seeing how neat and nice this brother is dressing very well comparted groomed amen now if he's driving a car and that car is dirty who do the people abuse is it the car or the honer they will say this man is so dirty look at his car so whatever whichever way the car looks is blamed on there but the man is not dirty see him but his car is dirty so if you are dirty it is Christ that takes the blame that is what I'm telling you that is why for his name sake to protect his name his Integrity he must take care of you he said cast all your cares oh what peace you often forfeit oh what needless pain you bear hey don't take the matter into your hand hand it over to the shepherd take your burden to the Lord and leave it there [Music] let me tell you it pays to serve Jesus it pays to obey his instruction when you follow what he says it will fight your battle it will meet your need it's a matter of time the Lord will come through for you don't take it upon yourself to do anything contrary stand still and you will see the salvation of the Lord the shepherd is mindful of your situation and he will never abandon you because he has his name to protect for your SES give us the [Applause] scripture give us the scripture give us the scripture quickly hallah yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death because he is my shepherd I shall fear know you we are not show man Hallelujah in the message holy go series brother Braham said this world is full of snares and he said we walk on line Minds that we don't even know he said but we've got an advocate who intercede for us before the father that is why sometimes they would say and that nearly caught him it wasn't a coincidence or a Lu that he didn't catch you it was your Shepherd that took the bullet for you even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of there I shall fear no for thou art thy rod and thy star they don't do me any bad they give me Divine Direction They comfort me uh-huh thou preparest a table before me God does not bless you and hide it he doesn't care who is watching because the shepherd will take care of every enemy he will take you of every Power he said thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine and they can't do anything about it Hallelujah thou anointed my head and my cup is [Applause] EV are you prepared for over running because realization will bring Victory you might not know you you have these blessings with the shepherd but I'm sent to remind you and to tell you that your blessings are so much you haven't tapped into it Hallelujah then surely tell it to your neighbor surely surely goodness and mercy shall follow you shall follow me all the days all the days not from from one week to the other not from one conversion to the other not from one Revival to the other all the days of your life because he is your [Music] Shepherd this is your scripture this is your scripture you know why because you have recognized The Voice of the shepherd and recognizing and following it places you under atonment that automatically activate these blessings in your life whether you pray for food or you don't pray for it God is under [Applause] obligation he knows when you are hungry my brother he knows what you need have he said do not be anxious it is the work of the heathens if your faith can rise to that level anxiety belong to the heathens anxiety belong to the unbelievers but for the Believers they don't need to be anxious because the shepherd knows what you need and he will supply let your faith rise to that level okay okay I think we are striking some climax let me be coming down a bit that is the shepherd's business but you got a job let me read your job to you in the message the tell Exodus I don't know if I gave them this one but okay I can read it from here the prophet said notice paragraph 213 in the Third Exodus notice the king I thank God what I'm reading tonight that new king that raised up that didn't know Joseph I want you to get something here what was his first king to destroy the power of Israel was with their children that's correct amen Satan let me tell you Church go ahead and this is for my young colleagues relative to the gospel I'm under 20 you know why you know why I'm 20 below it is always 20 belows that serve God they are the one that believe the message of Joshua and Cale read your Bible amen when the when the 10 Elders came to pre this is just for you now when the 10 Elders came to preach the message of I cannot make it that was the topic of that message do you agree with me they preach it with such a FY anointing until they converted the entire church in one sermon it's in your Bible numbers 13 numbers 13 all the hard dos who think they understood and they have some experience and knowledge they said that makes sense we mustn't gamble with our lives too much RK it's too much risk but you know what the Bible told me go ahead brother it's 20 below they were not impressed with that seron they didn't say Amen they didn't rise up to it this is why I'm 20 below Hallelujah but when Joshua and Caleb got on their own topic is we are more than able even God himself testifies that he saw H20 below saying preach on am my brother and all those saying keep quiet what do you know said bring out your hand brother bring out your hand 1 2 3 4 5 is that not your finger have you seen a giant before a giant has a minimum of six fingers and each finger with the Palm is longer than the letter of your hand if he use it to slap you you will go into coma you are there Joshua and Caleb they are deceiving you say bring out your foot count your toe one 2 3 4 5 is in a giant has an average I'm not saying exact average of minimum six toes the length of each toe is longer than your foot combined with your lower leg if they use it to kick you no coma death you are there shouting and God was watching he's watching you tonight that was why when God came down he said all those of you who say you cannot make it you have used your mouth to determine your faith you will not make it because Christ is the high priest of your confession whatever you give is what he offers what do you give tonight I can I will I do believe I can I will I do believe let the weak say and let me tell you Joshua and Caleb said look those Giants are bread we shall eat them chew them swallow digest nothing will happen did it happen or not when David came later that was the scripture he read to confront Goliath Gentile Warriors are you here when David killed one golad all his Warriors who are with him they said I must celebrate my own giant read your Bible golad asked Four Brothers each of David's Warrior kill them one by one even the one with lionlike face Hallelujah you will celebrate your own giant you will kill them you will eat them you will chew them you will swallow them you will digest them and nothing will happen it is the the blessing of Gentile Warriors to kill Giants Hallelujah so the devil knew this that is why he wanted to destroy the children Hallelujah see you can see why the pleasure is so much on our children the prophet said before the things start he likes to kill it in infancy just as we must kill sin in his infancy are you seeing it the prophet said the wisdom of God is not in how close you get to sin without committing sin but how fast you sh its appearance that is wisdom so Satan also understood the principle that was why it came through Pharaoh Moses you guys want to go and worship right who are the people that we go what is his business we didn't say I and my wife go want to go and worship I said me and myus we he said okay you adults can go leave the children and at another time he went on rapage killing the children his desire was to truncate the Revival before it starts this is a pressure that is coming upon young people but let me give you a blessing you know there's a quotation that says that they have more to deal with in their day than you Papas and Mama have more to deal with it's a quote but don't sympathize wrongly with that quotation and take it as a license to be succumbing to the devil that was not what the prophet is saying the prophet is only waking you to the consciousness of the battle that surrounds you but let me give you this blessing while we CAU that which is true we must also tell the children that you have much more Grace today than your parents heart because where sin abounds Grace much more when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit of the Lord will raise his in the days of these old people spoken word books was scar we have our own Liberian nationally here amen you get you get it in Bat I remember when I was growing and I'm still under under 20 when I was growing we have people who will borrow us books and they will make us write our name and the day we are going to return it two three days and the brother looks like a champion he counting this for you and he reminding you you need to be honest as a Christian brother so what we try to do because we don't have it we have to quickly read take extra I have my friends who will drop the entire book because they can't read it fast they want to settle down and digest it those were the days we lived in and by the grace of God the little we had kept us it kept us above Temptation it kept us above immorality it kept us above sinful habit even sometimes one page is just enough it will do a lot because this voice of the shephers is so potent it's so powerful to change lives but today my brother today my sister you have it all around you just in your small phone the entire message of the hour is in there Grace much more abound what we don't have you have so you have a greater weapon than we had at that time Hallelujah may God help you to use your weapon to fight this battle of Life Hallelujah he tried to destroy their children now listen close the same devil in different form of a kingship tried to destroy God's only son get rid of the children first before they get his touch that was why when God told them to get to Canaan he said utterly destroy everything brother Brown said I can see an Hebrew mother saying I'm a mother I can't kill this little baby he doesn't even have teach and Joshua will say hand him here if you can't deal with him we will deal with with it he said you know why when that little child grow up he going to behave like his daddy the people they refuse to wipe out go and read your Bible they said we shall make them Fetchers of water shiners of our shoe those people eventually became their teachers to teach them corruption and they are priests to teach them idolatry the wisdom of God is greater than the intellect of man no matter how hard it seems whatever God says do do [Applause] Hallelujah and he said the devil is really smart shrew bird he knows how to eat the thing before it gets started he knows it and the only thing you can ever do now we have talked about the shepherd's business he is your own business as the Sheep the only thing you can ever do to beat him is rely on Christen and humble yourself and let him lead you you will never do it any other way your intellectual Powers will never do it you've got to believe it just rely on him he is the shepherd now listen it ain't the Sheep's business to Keep the Wolves Away it is the shepherd's [Applause] business you know why sheep is usually attractive to wolves you didn't get that Foles and wolves they like sheep that is why those Wayward boys they prefer a girl of the church you are attractive to wolves listen to me when they have finished their life brother Brown said out there it is dog each dog you understand they knew the life of these girls they are finished they know they are not wife material so when they are looking for a wife they want a decent church girl who will not cheat on them who will be a mother who will not live his life on social media to the detriment of our family all those guys in the world they know things that are good know so you will always be attractive to wolves but you follow the voice of the shepherd under no circumstance the shepherd said must you as a Believer marry an unbeliever don't begin to worship the admiration there's no compliment they want to give you that your parents have not giving you if they tell you you are such a beautiful girl tell them your Daddy has told you that say another thing MH don't sit still for that because the chemistry of a woman is designed to respond to what she hears the chemistry of a man is designed to respond to what he sees you must be careful sheeps are usually attractive to wolves the same thing to Brothers if it sounds unpopular I can't say forgive me because I'm telling you the truth swallow it for your good amen he said it ends the Sheep's business to keep the wolf away it's the shepherd's business but the Sheep must stay with the Shepherd in order to stay safe that's my safety zone it's in Christ and Christ is the word and the word comes from the voice of the shepherd you stay by that voice you will stay safe whatever comes whatever go the Lord will defend you the Lord will fight your batt it wasn't modi's problem I'll give two more slingshots and we're going to close it wasn't modi's problem to take care of the plot of Ammon did you realize that that was a wolf coming for the life of a Sheep amen and if you look at amen very well he typified Satan 100% his problem against modai was simply on worship you are still going to have that problem friends because the Antichrist will demand it Revelation 13 said so he said all the people of the earth will worship him except those whose names are in the Lambs have I shown you your name in the Lamb's Book of Life you are the one that have recognized the voice among all the people of the earth and you are following the voice you have come under the blood of the atonement all your needs will be [Applause] Mex are you with me Brethren Amon was getting worship from everybody except mod all the people of the earth will worship him except those whose names so why should he be bothered when he already has worship everywhere because yours is the premium until he get it from you he w't be satisfied unfortunately he will die unsatisfied because he won't get it from you that's what the Bible say according to the scripture it's impossible so he plotted you know you can imagine somebody came mody a man came and said God has blessed me with everything but I have one problem and his only problem is the problem of an undocumented immigrant will know about that because in their country I'm an American you undocumented immigrant Hallelujah modai was a captive he's got no record that was why he couldn't get a decent job no social security he was doing Gat Man daily wage how can how can ordinary modai became a problem of a prince did you catch that but it became his problem anyhow and his friends told him if that's the only problem you have in life life eliminate it so you can enjoy the moment they mention Modi in their Gathering the Bible said they shall surely gather God became interested while Modi was sleeping at home God wasn't sleeping the keeper of Israel neither sleep [Music] nor you you are people of Interest wherever your name is mentioned Jesus must appear to say what is going on so sleep easy and sleep well you ain't got no problem the shepherd is at work I'm telling you save yourself worry save yourself Panic you've got a real Goda you can't be frustrated [Applause] they plotted against Moda they plan to see the king tomorrow God finished the business tonight Hallelujah he never is late he never is gone count on his presence do you know how the story ended the king couldn't sleep and God said I didn't keep you awake to be thinking go pick the book of remembrance keep doing all you can for God there'll be one day of remembrance and the only chapter God made the king to read was Mod's good work and he has what has been done to him they say he's an undocumented immigrant he's got no connection nobody to carry his fire but the Lord who can carry all fires you need something somewhere the Lord will carry your fire is your Advocate is your intercessor he will do it for you he's your Shepherd and while they finish what they were doing the king and his people the day broke and him man came Co who is in the court general Prince amen he said welcome do you know God never allowed Amen to declare his mission that mission to kill a modai died with him the king said what shall be done to the men whom the king the lights to Hon he went greedy who else will the king the light if not me if not me then see his mind let the king us be brought the king's Ring The King's garment the king's crown the king this the king that are you seeing Lucifer that became Satan come on through types and shadows God has told the story of redemption he said and let it be add done to that man and let the most noble Prince do an escort Rider before him in the presidential Convoy the king looked at him is a good talk but this is powerful you know this is powerful the only thing a man didn't ask for was the king's Queen he asked for everything then the king said no problem what you said is really demanding but it's going to be now since you are the one who had the idea no better person to execute it than you so as I'm standing here by the king's decree go and do it for more day that is the Good Shepherd at work that is your Shepherd at work there are many battles he has fought for you that you are not even conscious of so if he shows you a little give him thanks don't be afraid the shepherd can never fail whether whether hmon liked it or not he did it and all his conspirators they left him they said if modai is of the seed of Israel whom you have Begin to Fall before you will not Prevail because they know their Bible they know if Moda is the Seed of Abraham he must possess the Gate of his enemy don't be my enemy don't make yourself my enemy I will possess your Gates the Bible told me that Mori and Esther was given the entire house of Amen thus say the Lord can never fail it is not your business to take care of wolves your business is to stay by the Shepherds if you stay by the shepherd the shepherd will fight for you come to the shepherd tonight if you have strayed away from this Shepherd come back to the shepherd to get back to the shepherd you need to hear his voice his voice is the message of the hour it doesn't get better outside the message many of you have wandered here and there you yourself know you are not satisfied because this is the climax of it climax of Revelation climax of believing this is the voice of your Shepherd Sons and Daughters come back home tonight accept the shepherd and your life

reconciliation one time a Shepherd broke the leg of his sheep he said not for wickedness he was going astray and if I let him lose he will fall into the hand of aus lions and they will destroy him but
