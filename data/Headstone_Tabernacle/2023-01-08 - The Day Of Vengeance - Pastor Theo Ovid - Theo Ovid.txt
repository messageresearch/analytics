all that poor School but it's something that has a lot of meaning and power behind it and if ever we need a hard gospel is not you know knowledge shall increase and people have received things so intellectual it has got away from this this hot gospel this gospel that God operates on the Heart and souls of man you know he told them in the scriptures that he told them that that um he tried them to prove them to see what's in their heart well no you know the enemy have to fight after some kind of technical thing some kind of internet thing that is the age we're in right now she had to forgive us we just have to go with the flu but thank God we're back on track amen praise the Lord so I was kind of waiting for them to sort it out it's glad I did so this morning I have a special who wants a message but something up on my heart I know that in myself I I can't really preach this it will take the Holy Spirit to help me with this but we would see what the Lord will do and let's bow his as we understand and approach the word almighty God we stand under the shadow of your mercy and we ask for Mercy that you forgive us our sins and our failures and our shortcomings and the past Lord and we'll break into this new year as new Lord children booted by your spirit booted into fresh Vision Lord that you will become our vision and at the end of it all you send a prophet to introduce to us Jesus Christ not just teachings and doctrines and Mysteries and Revelations but to introduce to us the Messiah father God may you come into your word and come on your people as you promise you will that you will be amongst them and then your Prophet prophesied that we worship in the living Christ him moving in love Among Us father we invite you to come among us today in a special way come Among Us in your word and Enlighten Us in Jesus I ask it amen and amen see if I have your Bibles I'd like to turn to three portions of scripture Isaiah 34 Verse 8. Isaiah 61 1-2 Romans 12 we want to read 19 to 21. So reading from Isaiah 34 8. for it is the day of the Lord's vengeance and the year of recompensers for the controversy of Zion Isaiah 61. the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord had anointed me to preach good Titans unto the meek he had sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are born to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the dear Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn and our last scripture days from Romans 12 and we want to read from verse 19 I'm going to read two verses before that verse 17. going to 90. recompense to no man even for evil provided things honest in the sight of all men if it would be possible as much as light in you live peaceably with all men here we go 19. daily dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give please unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repeat see it the Lord therefore if that enemy hunger feed him if he tears give him drink for in so doing Thou shalt Heap cause a fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good may God bless his word you may be seated our title this morning and the title is the day of vengeance and I have an inspiration the ministry of Jesus Christ the Bible says vengeance is mine I will repeat see it the Lord the dear vengeance is like a destination we're heading down there now I want to go over Romans 12 19 in the Amplified and it says beloved never avenge yourselves but leave the way open for God's Wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay or requite see as the Lord and that scripture is from Deuteronomy chapter 32 35 that is where uh Paul pull it out from now Deuteronomy 32 35 says to me belong at vengeance and recompense their foot shall slide in due time for the day of the Calamity is at hand and the things that shall come upon them make hist the Amplified of that same scripture is the vengeance is mine and recompense in their time when their foot shall slide for the day of their disaster is at hand and the Doom comes speedily so regardless of what people do to you how would it hurt you abuse you maybe rape you whatever you go through vengeance belongs to God you and I are not authorized by the word to take up Vengeance in our own selves or to trigger um righteous indignation and you're going and do something and hit back or to get even amen praise the name of the Lord the dictionary meaning of Vengeance punishment inflicted in retaliation for an injury or offense not a word retribution now God's vengeance is not Revenge God's vengeance is his determined Justice his righteousness his holy anger towards sin to what's wrong doing that is God's Vengeance it is not God taken Revenge it is God paying back you see I will repay it's not something so let me just go over the scripture again deadly beloved avenge which is to punish or retaliate or execute judgment not yourselves but rather give Place unto Wrath so when you commit wrongdoings or evil I mean see this is important now because you will see the power of forgiveness and broadly kindness that is needed to go to the next level that is what you're going to see and you're going to see what people have in your heart and how it'll be so wrong that they're keeping all these grudges and thoughts in the heart looking to get even and they're in church and you will see how they cannot get blessed no way having that in their heart and in their system so let's go down a little deeper a metal teaching a little scripture reading but it is important and I believe God pushes upon me to share this with you today beloved avenge which is to punish or retaliate or to execute Justice not yourselves but rather give please under wrath for it is written vengeance is mine he owns that he will deal with that he will handle that he will manage that regards a whole lie who cheat who teeth who do whatever it is God will deal with that he's invented his mind you don't own that you don't have the right to that let God deal with that let God deal with them okay the Lord some Praises I don't care what your wife do what your husband do what your children do what the neighbor do what whoever do it doesn't matter let Vengeance belong to God or give the Lord some praises Hallelujah glory to God that scripture in the Amplified that verse 19 says beloved never avenge yourself but leave the way open so when you go and run to do your own thing and hit back and cuss back and argue back and fight back you're not leaving no room for God to do anything you doing your own thing and God takes his hands off and let you play yourself out but the scriptures say don't avenge yourself because vengeance is mine okay the Lord some praises Hallelujah I will repay says the Lord the wrath of God is inescapable his judgment is terrible it is also righteous so then it went on to say how to behave when evil is done to you how to behave when you are wronged how to behave when people treat you evil and so on if you therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he tells give him drink Oh Glory to God no custom don't say yes I'll go put my neck on him because he only ground now he is in a weakness now a good for him you do wicked he didn't say that okay the Lord some Praises this is the word now this will make you bust out of your human Spirit the human element and get in the real Spirit of forgiveness to drop everything today it has to drop because fire is about to fall because we are coming unto the day of Vengeance of our God hallelujah it's not your day it's his day okay the Lord has shout is not I saying this I change that he said the day of Vengeance of our God okay the Lord I shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah verse 21 be an overcome of evil but overcome evil with good glory to God so God is fear God is just and God knows exactly what is in people's heart hallelujah praise God praise God so to even speaking to gossiping whatever come towards you your acts of kindness and goodness will bring guilt and condemnation and torment to the mind of your Tormentor when they expected to hit back you're not hitting back when you're expecting the cost back you're not cussing back when you're expecting to fight back you're not fighting back because right glory to God vengeance is mine Hallelujah I will repay Hallelujah glory to God do you get it today [Applause] so this is not eye for eye anger for anger but you bless them instead Hallelujah therefore if that enemy hunger feed him if he does give him to drink this verse shows your enemy at their weakest point they are in a position where you can exact revenge or even get even they're hungry they are thirsty they have a Calamity but what is your response the Bible said don't let them die feed them give them to drink help them okay the Lord I shout you could exact Revenge you could get back even like I said this is what you deserve [Applause] this is what I want happen to you I want to hit back I want to get back because I feel so happy on the inside I want to see him mash up I want to see her destroyed it I wonder so you lose your house lose your job I want to see you lose all your money I want to see you lose out because of what you do to me [Music] [Applause] if you were in a position to help them your enemy commit the rest into the hands of God for Glory can we go a little further proverbs 24. verse 17. Rejoice not when thy enemy falleth and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbled least the Lord see it and it displeased him and he turn away his right from him somebody do your evil somebody do you wrong but hear what the word say don't rejoice when the enemy fall good for him because so it means God watching your heart forget the enemy that's not the issue here you know God watching you sorry I don't want to point at anybody else I don't want to feel the fingers sorry sorry sorry I do that I don't see him and say appointed her no I'll keep me forgive myself don't anybody say they see my finger pointed and I pointed at them unappointed at anybody sorry God watches our heart disappointing on us to see if we are rejoicing when things happen to people that have wronged you or done your evil or lion you or mistreat you or whatever it is and when you're sick Calamity hit them so and you're smiling in the recorder and God said is that right I don't like that you know what I do I cancel my rap to watch them so when they're supposed to get repayment your behavior fingers they're pointing at George sorry your attitude could make God his rack payment or discipline to your enemy because God see it and he displeased with it oh praise the name of the Lord let me read that and he Amplified Rejoice not when your enemy Falls and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles or is overthrown leaves the Lord see it and it be evil in his eyes and this please him and he turn away his wrath from him to extend extend it upon you the woes offender so God is looking at your heart that the sea the attitude you have to an enemy that stumbles or is overthrown oh Hallelujah this is coming to real Christianity by the gangly this is the real thing we come into re this is similarly amongst Africa they know they don't mystery coming here and you're scratching their head to find the thing out with mystery there's the real thing here now this is Christ The Mystery of God being revealed by the word this is the word becoming flesh and people could taste it see it live it this is what we're talking about here now Luke chapter 9 verse 51. and it came to pass when the time must come that he should be received up talking about Jesus he steadfast he said his face to go to Jerusalem sent Messengers before his face and they went entered into the village of the Samaritans to make ready for him listen to this part and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem so they didn't receive the messengers that come to forerun Jesus Come into that place verse 54. and when his disciples James and John saw this they said Lord will build out that we command fire to come from heaven and consume them even as Elias did they have a scripture they say their receiver good could we call Fire could we say burn them one time could it be called judgments on them as Elias did listen to Jesus response but he turned and rebuked them this is Jesus response the Vex they upset that he's not received and and this is the attitude he said like reborn them all on fire she has rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit you have the people not involved in that you know the people do the rejection the people have the behavior this is Jesus and his only disciples getting a scriptural basis to make an action of judgment that they don't have the spirit to deal with and can't handle because judgment vengeance is mine but listen to the next verse that that Jesus said here still Jesus speaking for the son of man is not come to destroy men's lives but to save them and they went to another Village so when you are wrong wronged two things is at play God's reward to your enemy or God reward to you or God's reward to the one that roamed you or God's reward to you based on your attitude towards your brother and sister if you rejoice over the fall of your brother or sister God cancels his rap towards them that's why Jesus said bless them that kiss you your blessing goes up their curves go up it bunks and the blessing falls back on you they could fall back on them if you cast them that costume will explain because I spent because falling both sides them that kills you it's not right so I want to say do you see the importance of the spirit of forgiveness even of Brotherly kindness do you see how the blood of the age has to be displayed not talked exhorted made a sermon made a card and put in a bookmark inside your Bible I'm not talking about that kind of bodily kindness I'm talking about the real deal when you stand praying forgive you stand praying for what in 2023 for Dynamics for the Holy Ghost for the power of God for your adoption for your refilling when you stand praying you're still have to forgive [Music] thank you because when you do that the blessings of God will fall upon you and then you can see the power of Psalms 23 5 don't prepare us a table for me in the presence of my enemies thou anoint is my head with oil my cup run it over so when the enemy you feed him you you help him and God bless you because you're not cursing them you're because they drop your order God make a table in the presence of your enemies all what they don't want you to have God multiplying God adding when they expect God to divide and touch it all okay the Lord I shout all the evil all the jealousy all the Envy God prepare a table in the presence of your enemies he said no anoint is my heaven oil my cup run it over oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so don't worry about all them looking they don't fall only looking for The Stumbling for don't worry about them obey what God Said there are those who want your hood there are those who want you to be in pain they want no blessing for you or your family Hallelujah Proverbs 25 21 and 22. says If thy enemy may be hungry so therefore this is where the scripture comes from in Romans this is Proverbs now If thy enemy be hungry give him bread to eat if we be thirsty give him water to drink for those shall he calls a fire upon his head and the Lord shall reward thee hey do you see it now so Proverbs gaps it and show with the right Behavior but the spirit of forgiveness putting yourself in your brother's place on the matter the Lord gonna reward you when you treat them according to the scriptures oh give the Lord some Praises people glory to God and people can't even understand how you're so blessed how you cut run it over how surely goodness and mercy shall follow me on the days of my life and I will dwell in the hopes of the Lord forever they can't explain it they expect this to happen they're looking for the anointing to dry up they're looking for the drop down dead but you are alive today to give God Praises walk help me Jesus Oh Hallelujah that's why David said I've never seen the righteous forsaken or a seed baked bread give that the righteous give him Praises inside of here this morning for Glory to God hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Glory Chloe [Applause] for my Proverbs nearly down if your enemy hungry feed him if he doesn't give him drink Oh Glory the corner shall he'd cause a fire in his head and the Lord shall reward thee to forget about them take your reward or get the Lord I shout take your reward [Music] Victory wood oh there are so many people like to blame I can't accept responsibility for nothing it's not me it's not me I think remember that they learn nothing always somebody do them and the reason that they behave so because somebody do somebody say you're a lion you do it because you want to do it everybody have a choice everybody have a decision you do it not because somebody do you because you want to do it you want to get even you want Revenge Revenge has caused bitterness bitterness has caused cancer and cancer does kill you okay the Lord I shout in the house but forgiveness does bring healing or get along get me started this morning oh glory to God if you want to come out of your plane Drop it if you wanna come over here condition drop it let it go let it go Hallelujah I saw something written even somebody have a whole loaf of bread and they jealous your slice they can't help it and they're still not satisfied with the whole loaf but the facts and they upset with the slice that God gave you rejoice you're not responsible for people's attitude towards you and your behavior you live the life of Christ tell yourself I come the Jesus said that you might have life and have it more abundantly I am making no excuse for my blessing I am making no excuse for drug why can't run it over or give the Lord some Praises come on come on give the Lord amen by the black man Hallelujah don't make no excuse nobody could stop it your husband can't stop it your wife can't stop it let me give you some good news that even the enemy can stop it because he prepared that table for me in the presence of my name is okay the Lord I shout fear that this is our year this is our time oh glory to God hallelujah glory to caught him and give me season as I wrap up this spot let me get this part here let's talk a little bit about job and job as a tested man not because he did something wrong or evil but because God tell the devil there's not like him on the earth actually God sent for the devil I said all about the place to and through he just said train and I'll make a spinner went back somewhere else and so on so he devil all over he marching all over anointing people inspiring people breaking up homes picking up marriages that's the devil job he said listen I want to show you a man you say look at that man it's like touched a man because I have a heads around that man he said not that he said he's a devastating my crack at him that's why there was actually a permission to take a crack at you Hallelujah remember the woman who the man came home with his friends and he she was letting things the man was bringing his friends and things falling in the ground and she cleared up singing some nice Christian song all can I think the vomiting all kinds of Tony Brown and a man see a sea you see her tell her she's a Christian you could imagine somebody do that

his servants oh give the Lord praise him praise God I ain't telling you nothing I ain't saying nothing God will speak for himself God will deal with that all who feel the right and they can think and they can say and and you know people like to lose them out all they do is say a thing upon your heart upon your heart but keep them all to have a little in your mouth get more a bad luck for your mouth and say the wrong thing Oh Glory to God judgment struck in the Old Testament what it was an ass they say don't touch them people think they're gonna hide Babylon government like he had making an investment he gonna hide something on any camp and afterwards next day people decided to lose men or whatever something wrong that is not what God said he said no man shall be able to stand before these are my life Victory after Victory and everything has no Victory blows licks Try by tribe family by family Man by man then he could confessed I have a Babylon government whole family gets done you know good judgment you know that was the Old Testament in the New Testament they say they're selling they're bringing money to the church and everything else and that's very welcome and I asked come he dropped down there to meet you because he said please see a lifetime you know I mean if you buy on yourself you make 30 and you're coming to three dollars you know but you see he was always a liar but this is a liar being judged because judgment begins up the house of God and this is not change and that liar who was lying all the time didn't understand his physical change is coming normal normal drop down dead the one I have issue with is the wife because the wife living with him he knows he's a liar she's sleeping with him she reckon with him she having breakfast with him she know the man she didn't remarried and she backing that up you back up the word you stay with the wood brother I don't care who you are stay with the word [Applause] there's no family thing you know as a family our family businesses you know it's the wit is this all Yes it packs you out too afterwards no man joined to them you know people who want an extension on their life they stay in far because judgments start to strike the church God's right God's payment God's righteous Justice was being melted out and the prophets say it will repeat that means God will come again in vengeance in rat in righteous Justice to deal with the issues that has been untouched for years because God Wrath is not in many years people think it canceled not so fast Hallelujah he said vengeance is mine I will repay in time and due time oh my praise God he said for the better shorter than a man can shut himself on it a narrower covering narrow down they could wrap himself in it for the Lord shall rise up as in monk purism he shall be wrought as in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring the passage active stranger now therefore be not Marcus at least your bands be made strong if I have heard from the Lord God I hosts a consumption even determined on the whole it that last verse here says now therefore do not discovered least the bands which bind you be made strong for a decree of Destruction have I heard from The Lord of hosts upon the whole Land of the Dead o praise God now help me Jesus look for verse 16 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up as his customers he went in the synagogue on the Sabbath day to read and there was delivered unto him the book of The Prophet his eyes and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written and that's where he read from this morning Isaiah 61. this is Jesus now in verse 18 of Luke chapter 4 says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach the Deliverance of the captives to recovering of the sight of the blind to say that Liberty them that approves to preach the acceptably of the Lord then he closed the book so Jesus didn't continue on to read what we read to declare the dear Vengeance of our God he stopped right at the acceptable year because that was the Year of Jubilee they have released this was the ministry of Jesus Christ being identified by the scripture to fulfill that portion here at that time so then he closed the book he give it again to the minister sat down on the eyes of all them that were in a single synagogue were fasten on him and he began to say unto them this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears no let's go this is from the identified Masterpiece the fifth of December 1964. he is making a bride yes sir he is chewing the chips now chopping off the world Church joining increase on the nomination and dogmas all has to be cut away from the church their formal ideas their indifference their Doctrine and things come back let the master pick up the ball let the master pick up you in his hands and strike the word and say Jesus Christ the same yesterday to them forever say Amen Lord Make Me Mourn Me Make Me Lord what I should be then if I deliver from the earth I'll draw all men unto me he is cutting you out now cutting you down to his word only cutting all the trees and dogmas and everything away from you trying to get back a bride for the son another masterpiece part of the word so all your feelings how they get cut off all your church Spirits okay they're cut off religious Spirits cut off hypocrisy cut off what damages have to get cut off you have to be cut down to the word now where you just love the word you love what God Said you want to meet God's requirement let's continue Butter Brown Jesus couldn't take the place you remember when he they read the that day in the book he read just part of the prophecy left the rest of it is for the last day we are supposed to take that part what part the day of vengeance the bride is to take that part so you see he has he wants to cut the church out just like he did the Sun out like he did the bride and the groom to be his bride you must be part of him not part of a Creed not part of the church not part of the nomination but the part of him hewed out of any other kind of a form it won't work you got to be hewed from the word the world cut off of you and just leave the world only live in you the great scatter is counting on you willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirement and his word requires in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy Christ is I the identified Masterpiece of the word made flesh you are asked to identify yourself in him by the same word to be a masterpiece for the bride so who went into the temple Jesus Christ who from the scripture Jesus Christ who read the word Jesus Christ who stopped in the middle of a scripture Jesus Christ because he knew that last part was for no for a bride to pick up the day of Vengeance of our God Hallelujah now I know some brothers fight they fight me when I share that the faithful Ministry is not man's Ministry the faithful Ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ and by God this this proves it in a big big way because vengeance is mine no man can pick up Vengeance no man could pick up that scripture human it has to be Jesus Christ back again in our faithful Ministry to pick up that part of the scripture to declare that the offensions of God our God hallelujah because God already says vengeance is mine so no man in a position to take a God's right to display God's Wrath I hear ministers I hear so-called prophets pronounce this and pronounce judgment and speaking this and this one Barren and cursing this one person I want to give them up what they have is witchcraft away you know they haven't said that other powers other powers you know they're not God talking to them you know they do have power to do that God give them their authority to do that he said vengeance is mine praise God Hallelujah on this one and calling this one to happen that one this one girl flood and this one get this praise God I have no such power I I've been accused of being very powerful accuse me of but I've been accused of being a powerful man you know powerful Realm yeah portio all right so watch out let's go notice the Luton age what what did we live justification way down here at the bottom watch flattened the foundation Stones Luther Wesley we believe in sanification to come to the minority Pentecost still the baptismal he was up to the minority what the church goes right out to the end right out to the end that the church is going to have to be so perfectly like the ministry of Jesus Christ not by the office Ministry of a Ministry in China know that is our thing we're doing our thing when the ministry of Jesus guy come that's different that will be my Ministry my Ministry going on right now but you have that gift yeah all the way preaching the world and what that that's me have a gift to get out of the way that God could Inspire and speak to your heart but when the ministry of Christ come that is different that is not I doing my thing that is christ-directed service do you get that when Peter when Jesus died and rose from the dead Peter going fishing and hold a bunch of them going fishing fishing all night caught nothing Christ come and said children have you any meat he has a little wickediest three

any meat he's official night and caught nothing he said cash it not to the right side the good thing somebody could hear the voice of God when they cast directly like nothing he's avoided casting net to the right side when the castle to the right side you see much of it you say help so much of his help they say the Lord but Peter died because you know Peter have dressed or whatever it's just bitter he said Lord I'm a sinful man yes you need to come into presence he recognizes God back on the road I am telling you we have to see the same living reality not come here and hear thoughts and their ideas but come into a reality have you any need prayer praise God hallelujah they want a healing they want to break through they want the Deliverance they want a victory they want Deliverance to a family you could get that this morning have faith in God he is Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever have faith in God don't use your eyes let your heart let God take a hole upon your heart

yesterday today and forever you'll make me dance up here he's the same yesterday today and forever he can't change his ways can't change his power can't change his Mercy can't change his love can't change his blood can't change Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God glory Hallelujah there we go listen to this prayer whatever I'm praying Heavenly Father we are grateful to know that we are living in this last day just before the coming of that just one that wonderful glorious loving son of yours our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who we love and we know the Bible speaks of an appearing before the coming on there's great difference and it would appearing and coming no father we realize so write in that prayer that he's differentiating appearing and coming he has to pierce and then come appear among who among the saints who pass to somebody some foreign visitor no Christ he has to appear among the people it will be the appearing of the Lord okay now watch no father will realize that the church has come to the stage of justification come to the stage of sanification come to the states of receiving the Holy Spirit now the stones are being honed down for the fitting of the ministry of Jesus Christ they will have ministers don't understand they think because they're preaching long 30 40 years they had him in Jesus Christ I tell them big fat no they got it together hear the prophet saying here no we come through justification sanitation the Holy Ghost spirit now the stones have been honed what is horn chisot and Edge that's some finer thing to get done come on now to be more sincere the hard part all of that have to come down now again you known to the word okay the Lord some Praises that is being honed cut shaped to be fitted watch let me say it again the stones have been honed down for the fitting of the ministry of Jesus Christ to blend right in to take the church we thank thee for this father oh so glad we can put our trust in you what your word say is true it can never fail because you are the word and you said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never fail I pray father tonight the opening of this revival I've been lengthy speaking nice group of people to talk to but we are looking for a Revival people not looking for Revival not saying looking for a Revival we are looking for these little short few nights we got here for you to send fire off the altar Oh Glory to God I like you appreciated Oh Glory to God he said we're looking for fire off the altar Oh Glory the God yes if another man come with some Mega message some mystery man he said we're looking for fire is that the fire of your town to get a revival going oh give the Lord a shout in the house these people father great many of them are believers receive the Holy Ghost surely the Holy Spirit would know the word and I pray heavenly father that you will confirm it again tonight let it be known that thou art God and the time is joined for we access in Jesus name oh my hallelujah oh glory to God where many in homes just now Hallelujah but abandonment is such a perfect man he said let's turn to Ephesians 4 I begin to read and give some Apostles some prophets remember last night don't try to take the other man's office some evangelists some pastors some teachers for the Perfection of God does it read like that no the Perfection of what sins who are the Saints the sanctify ones the one that started from down there Perfection of the Saints for the working of the ministry then he bought the ministry of Jesus Christ so that's working of the ministry is that we run up and the only place doing this and doing that the real work of the ministry is whose Ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ so the faithful Ministry really is the ministry of Jesus Christ in the form of a pastor in the form of evangelist in the form of a prophet in the form of a teacher in the form of an apostle forgive the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah so the ministry of Jesus Christ can't preach foolishness let me search Jesus Christ can't preach false Doctrine the administer Jesus Christ God be a liar glory to God who will just kind of bring forth prophecy or give the Lord some Praises what our ministry is for till we all come to the units of the faith the knowledge of the Son of God unto the measure the statue of perfect man oh my God so when Jesus died he means she wasn't over how many knows that he went on to preach the soul that was in prison when the preacher's Souls that could not be saved and he said I will repeat again people that cannot be saved have to listen and hear this message preaching his power Oh Glory to God hallelujah people that sat under the anointed Oh Glory to God isn't that right he said Jesus after he had finished his ministry preached those Souls that were unsavable that could never ever be saved now the Bible said he went and preached the souls that were imprisoned that repented not when mercy was given to them the spurred Mercy now their Witten judgment what a time that must have been and Jesus said himself as the father sent me so send that you and as the father sent him to preach to the living to those who had hope and then present the same message to those who had no hope it seems to fit in at this time that will have to be done because the spirit of Christ Living in US does not change the nature of him it does not change God's system he must be the same in every generation as my father sent me so send that you the Ministries must be the same he ain't so much in John 14 12 he that believeth on me the work that I do shall do also see The Works preaching to the Lost Healing The Sick identity impossibility ever be saved the work went on just the same may I put it like this this is Brother Branham no this is not me may I put it like this the ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated in his church in this last day same Jesus same healer same baptizer same person coming to a gentile bride Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God let's go now the debtings of yesterday the message of Luther the message of Wesley the message of Pentecost if it can only go through the process of God's holy spirit and the word of a Vindication it will bring forth the reflection of Jesus Christ bring forth Jesus Christ watch it's got to be molded into something so watch the words now Luther has got to be molded into Wesley Wesley has got to be molded into Pentecost and the Pentecost has got to be molded into Christ and that's where the Pentecostal Mission because the only stuff that gives because Christ after coming by the word and the word comes that Prophet they reject the prophet they reject the word they reject the word there is at the image so the Pentecostal never got into the image of Jesus Christ but the promise for us is the our hearts must be turned back to the faith of the fathers so we're going right back to what they had in their Pentecost nothing less nothing different no new Holy Ghost [Applause] no moral mystery conquering that it's the same Holy Spirit [Applause] people don't want to go near it but it's good enough for me it is part of the all-time religion is that the old-time Holy Spirit people stop jumping in this message people Hallelujah in this message they're sitting on hearing hearing hearing they're recognizing nothing therefore they can act upon what they're hearing what can the Lord I shout but if you recognize this message yes you hear it and recognize it you can act upon it National Force put Israel in the Homeland National Force will put the people in the world come to the churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride and that's what we come to church for to connect with the power of God no man to question the pride but the power could put you in that Pride or give the Lord some praises oh we love him this morning hallelujah hallelujah Glory look according in thank you Lord so watch Pentecost has gotten more into Christ it goes to a possess so as the gospel going to a process it is processing Lucid age justification we believe that Wesley's signification we believe that Pentecost of wrestling gifts for the Holy Ghost we believe that but it molded all together what do you come out with Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God Amen so when are you a preachers preaching I have a Jesus meter I don't see how much time

like brass watch the contrast of the image here look what this is what does brass speak of brass speaks of judgment Divine judgment it shows his full purpose is coming here on the earth as God to be made flesh he died for us took the judgments of God the Divine judgment and has received a kingdom that's brass and solid it cannot be moved nothing harder than brass never found nothing that could be tempered judgment brass speaks of divine judgment okay I'll just continue here now bro speak up the venomen his eyes flame of fire and then out of his mouth goes are sharp to its sword what did he do the right of God was upon us being Sinners is that right no one could see themselves so understand this the Judgment that was for us went on Jesus so God actually judge him because he actually paid a price it wasn't free it cost him a country he said watch watch and and all the wrath of almighty God was poured upon him the word your Lamb of God for you were slain taking the sins of the will upon him and he bore was sin and God poured out the fear sins of the Rat upon him and he was wonderful transgression boost for iniquity this is the assessment of our peace was upon him with his stripes we are healed someday here we go those brass feet of Justice when he comes as a judge he will tread the Antichrist all of his enemies Hallelujah we he'll walk through the Earth with a rod of iron in his hand oh repentance in a friend while you have a chance to repent try put it off think it's just a little story won't happen it will happen it just couldn't happen to me it will happen to you feet of brass tread down his enemies because he suffered and thread out the winepress of the faces of God to pay for our sins then we guilty poor miserable wounds as we are stick up our little nose and read some kind of idiotic book I try to think there is no God there's nothing like this judgment and come he will take those brass feet and Crush out his enemy he will wait over the Antichrist he will take those apostate churches and sling them into eternity under some winter consuming fire where she'll become human going away head white as well he is a function of experience and wisdom now I want you to ask you something I'm speaking to you lukewarm Church ten virgins better to meet the Lord the Bible said the books are open Daniel 79 the books would open that's the book of The Sinner another book was open who came with him the church from the Rapture tens of thousands times thousands times thousands of thousands came with him to minister to him his wife judgment was set the books were open another book was open which was a sleeping vision and every man was judged thus from the book you'll be asked to give a reason why you didn't and when and what then you know better now you know better now you might not have known it before but you do know where is this righteous kiss will be saved where will the Sinner and the uncouth voice of many Waters what does Waters represent thickness and multitude what a horrible thing for a drifting Soul on the sea of life no pilot to guide him loose floating with the tides to hear the Roar of the great cataracts The Falls what a horrible thing it is are so drifting voice of many Waters what is his voice is the Judgment the voice of the ministers through the Holy Spirit that's cried out the people in every age standing there the voice of many Waters crying out Texas and multitude the voice of those seven stars in his hand that every church is preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Christ praise God come in Divine judgment the voice of many Waters musician could come up please hallelujah what it will be to know that you set in the meetings heard that you should get right with God and receive the Holy Ghost I receive in the Holy Ghost makes you come out of church membership so don't stay actors remember without the Holy Ghost press and say God fill me with your Holy Spirit amen and a drifting Soul he had a voice of God speak out in that meeting and you set in through the Judgment of God preach and refused it the great fall is just below you the great cataracts that take you to your utility voice of many Waters voice of many Waters how are you going to do it when it's recorded in glory when The Voice tonight is recorded your voice is recorded here we go your thoughts are recorded as a man thinking in his heart so is he your voice is louder in heaven I mean your thoughts are louder in heaven than your voices on Earth certainly God knows the thoughts and intents of the heart he said to the Pharisee you Hypocrites how can you speak good things and out of the abundance of your heart speak at the mouth calling me master good so he sorry good Master but they were Hypocrites Hallelujah pray don't be a hypocrite what will it be on that day when the voice Thunders out of many Waters many churches forming out Hallelujah let me take a wrap up here now wow London in 1933 coach spoke to him this is the woman's Nation it's a number 13. it appears in the 13th chapter of Revelation 13 stars 13 stripes everything is 13 everything is a woman remember thus he at the Lord there will be a woman rule before the end time she'll either be president vice president or it will be the Catholic Church as a woman I have seen her did not guess saw it therefore you could speak it a great woman the nation bowed to her it will be one of the end time thus say the Lord write it down find out you young people see if it happens if it isn't I'm a false prophet Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah 1962 this is the 4th of February was a community service communion actually he talked about the stars that was getting fights as a line and he said was that's gsus Greece and so like that God if ever God sends his power to the church it will be his grace I'm almost finishing It Won't Be The Obedience of the people so God come in in time and season to fulfill his promised word but that connects to what God told the prophet because then right he said he at that time acted at that time to fulfill his word is that right if God ever sent his power to the church it'll be his grace it wouldn't be Obedience of the people and Isaiah said in the 40th chapter to cry to Jerusalem that a Warfare is over yet she was guilty of adultery but it was God's grace that was sending it if God here we go Church sends anything to us it will be his grace not our merits Oh Glory to God hallelujah Revelation 6 12. and I be held when he had opened the six seal low there was a great earthquake and the sun became black a sakota's

Thunders and lightens and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the Earth so mighty and earthquake and so great and the great city that was divided into three parts and the cities of the Nations fell and great Babylon came and remembered before God to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fiestas of Israel so called vengeance comes with intensity comes with purpose comes with anger that is called vengeance Hallelujah watch on every island fled away and the monkeys were not found and they fell upon men a Great Hero to Heaven every stone about a weight about

Wednesday here at the Tabernacle Friday we have our Zoom prayer meeting at 8pm and we're back here this coming Sunday day at 10 A.M maintenance team group two please meet your brother Joel Streaker after the service this evening and next week group one is scheduled for maintenance we certainly appreciate all of these maintenance groups can we put our hands together it's a sacrifice it's an effort it's not easy but it's a deposit into eternity can the church say Amen we're going to salute all the group leaders who want to salute better Stephen for coordinating behind the scenes and certainly we solicit your support and help if you're not part of a group we encourage you to speak to brother Stephen or one of the deacons and they will help you get into a part of one of these groups um so Jess uh heads up as well we're gonna formalize the dates but we do want to have a special youth activity you could pencil the date in on the 28th of January which is the last Saturday of this month we would have a special youth activity here at the Tabernacle and also you can also pencil in on the 21st of January which is next week Saturday we want to have our power our time of prayer downstairs here at the Tabernacle as well and just an announcement about Sunday School uh Sunday school will resume at a date to be announced later in January so stay tuned for that parents and in the meantime we really encourage the parents to have conversations with your children a pause with it this again a little bit we live in a world where people don't have the right conversations in the homes enough we live it up to school teachers and friends and videos and games and the internet so we want to encourage you to be active in telling them the right thing telling them about the law telling them about the right thing because the influence is out there and it's 24 7. it's a constant bombarding of this and this and this you're known as having a conversation with my wife about being young in primary school and I get nothing back at how peer pressure worked and and all these little things and and how hard it is now compared to that time you know so we want to encourage you parents to keep talking to your children encourage them to serve God and also put some boundaries with social media and technology and these things you cannot walk blind as if you don't know it what is in your house wasn't in your house 20 30 40 years ago you know when they say shoot the TV no TV on your phone and we unfortunately we can't shoot the phone so you have to use now the new methods of shooting and protecting and defending because he never will do everything he could do so be an active participant parents in having this conversation with your children is really an encouragement to this and to keep praying uh in your homes establish your own prayer altar don't wait just for Zoom prayer meeting or service cover time in your home for family prayer if you're in your house by yourself you cover time and set a timetable if you're there with your family come together set a timetable make it a time of prayer I much rather you do five minutes again as a family than to do nothing at all but put it as a priority put it on your calendar put it on your schedule that's the discipline that sees your results it it all adds up you know that's why you could pour the vial of your prayer because you're putting something in it all the time can the Church Say Amen and a reminder just lastly we live in a technological world but certainly when you come into this building coming to the sanctuary coming to the house of God remember to either switch off your mobile devices or put them on silent so there's no interruption in the sanctuary so may the Lord Richard bless you have a wonderful week stay on the firing line and I find myself saying this more and more maintain your testimony maintain your testimony situations come to for you to lose your testimony but think it through how do I maintain my testimony will this response maintain my testimony will this conversation maintain my testimony and that maintain your testimony is based on an assumption that you have a testimony so if you don't have a testimony then get one and then maintain it so may the Lord richly bless you with Anthony [Music] amen praise God Amen appreciate the Lord amen amen dismiss you out praise God Hallelujah hold me close Let Your Love surround [Music] Ed draw me to your side [Music] ways I'll rise up like this [Music] Spirit lead by the power of Your Love oh be close Let Your Love
