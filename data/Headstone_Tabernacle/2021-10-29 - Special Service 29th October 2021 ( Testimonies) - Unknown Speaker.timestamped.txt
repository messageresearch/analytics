[10:39] of you may have known her she came in
[10:41] just during the pandemic and everybody's
[10:44] wearing masks and everything else
[10:46] and um you know it has been
[10:48] quite an experience with this pandemic
[10:51] and to see how god could do that work
[10:55] and and bring her through we certainly
[10:58] appreciate her coming forward and
[11:01] willing to give a testimony by the grace
[11:03] of god
[11:04] so we want to invite her
[11:06] praise the lord
[11:08] blessed be the name of the lord we want
[11:10] to invite her to
[11:11] this one minute
[11:20] i am here
[11:21] okay
[11:24] god bless you sings
[11:26] i'm a little bit nervous so bear with me
[11:29] um and i had to make some notes because
[11:32] i'm not a freehand speaker
[11:35] i just want to give honor and glory and
[11:37] thanks and praise to god for his love
[11:40] his mercy and his faithfulness
[11:43] it's because of his mercy that's the
[11:45] only reason why i'm still here alive and
[11:48] restored today
[11:50] and i also thank god for good
[11:53] praying parents they are no longer here
[11:55] with us but um i'm i know when they were
[11:58] they prayed a lot for myself and my
[12:00] siblings and i thank god for restoration
[12:03] just to give you a little background
[12:05] information on myself um i was brought
[12:08] up in the message ministry
[12:11] however due to certain things that
[12:13] happened at the time
[12:15] um when i became of age and an adult
[12:18] i couldn't wait to bolt
[12:22] and i did right into the world
[12:25] at that time i didn't even want to hear
[12:27] anything about church or message or
[12:30] anything associated with church
[12:33] um during this time while out there in
[12:35] the world
[12:36] i recalled um
[12:39] having a recurring dream you know um i
[12:42] don't believe in dreams and stuff too
[12:44] much but
[12:45] my this dream was exactly the same each
[12:48] time i probably had it about three or
[12:50] four times over the years you know and
[12:52] it was exactly the same it was um it was
[12:55] judgment day
[12:56] and i was standing before god to give an
[13:00] account of my life
[13:02] and each time in the dream i would
[13:04] bargain with god to let it be a dream
[13:07] and if it was a dream when i awoke i
[13:09] promised to change
[13:12] and each time i would a week you know
[13:15] and um in cold sweat you know i know i'm
[13:18] just because it seems so real
[13:21] however when the effects of the dream
[13:23] were off i would return to life as usual
[13:26] doing my own thing
[13:28] um i fast forward to the year of 2006
[13:31] between 2006 and 2008 there about it was
[13:35] a period in my life where i think my
[13:37] life two in a corner somewhat
[13:40] i lost about six persons who were very
[13:42] dear to me
[13:44] one of them um the last one the last
[13:47] death in 2007 there about late 2007
[13:51] was a very dear friend of mine who um
[13:54] who worked with me she was only 26 years
[13:57] old and she literally just dropped dead
[14:00] and at that time i just felt like god
[14:02] was speaking to me you know june it's
[14:04] time to return
[14:07] um
[14:08] her death had a very profound
[14:11] effect on my life
[14:13] and at that time i say god i give up
[14:16] um and just like that you know all the
[14:19] desires of the things of the world i
[14:21] mean i loved carnival for someone who
[14:23] didn't grow up in it you know i just
[14:26] loved it
[14:27] and partying and just doing my own thing
[14:30] and just like that i just started losing
[14:32] the desire for it
[14:34] um i couldn't explain it but it must
[14:36] have been god working on me
[14:38] and around
[14:40] 2008 early 2008 i just started looking
[14:44] for church to fellowship
[14:46] and for some reason i just could not go
[14:49] back to a message church so um i went to
[14:52] a couple pentecostal churches and it
[14:54] just wasn't sitting right with me
[14:56] and um eventually i've i've visited a
[14:59] ministry that's liv that's close to me i
[15:01] live in diigo martin and this ministry
[15:03] is in pity valley about 10 minutes away
[15:05] from my home
[15:07] and there was something about the way
[15:08] they worshipped that um it kind of drew
[15:10] me and you know and i stayed there for
[15:13] um for quite a while until last year
[15:16] um fast forward again to 2018
[15:20] i had an experience of god's
[15:22] supernatural healing in my life and just
[15:25] like that one day i began experiencing
[15:28] severe pain in my left thigh
[15:30] and the pain got progressively worse at
[15:33] one point i was consuming like about 18
[15:36] pillars a day
[15:37] and the pain had gotten so intense i was
[15:40] experiencing problems walking
[15:42] and needed um a cane to walk i would go
[15:45] to work and not be able to sit for very
[15:48] long so my doctor had recommended that i
[15:51] go on complete bed rest until she found
[15:53] like what was going on because my side
[15:55] was in addition to pain in me it was
[15:58] extremely swollen
[16:00] so she had sent me forearm on mri and
[16:03] the result came back on that i had edema
[16:06] which is like um
[16:08] i think it's like inflammation in your
[16:10] joint
[16:11] and
[16:13] i i almost felt like i was um
[16:16] becoming a um a triple
[16:18] because of how i felt it was like a tear
[16:20] and pain you know
[16:22] and at that time you know i would be
[16:24] home sometimes and the pain would be so
[16:26] severe i would get because all the
[16:28] painkillers that my doctor gave me
[16:30] nothing was working
[16:32] i would stand up you know walk up and
[16:34] down the corridor of my house you know
[16:36] and just be calling on the name of jesus
[16:39] and
[16:39] to me
[16:40] when i called on his name the more i
[16:42] called on his name the pain eased
[16:45] and um
[16:46] and one time um i started taking
[16:49] i stopped taking all the prescribed
[16:51] medication that she um that she gave to
[16:53] me and i say you know what i'm gonna
[16:54] consecrate myself and pray
[16:57] and it was then i found on my youtube
[17:00] channel with um
[17:02] messages from brother branham and i just
[17:04] began listening to the messages
[17:07] and i recall listening to our message on
[17:09] faith ones where the prophet referred to
[17:12] faith as the sixth sense
[17:15] you know um he called it the sixth sense
[17:18] or the supersense and i just held on to
[17:20] that and just kept dwelling on that
[17:23] and
[17:24] eventually you know i just had a claim
[17:26] in my healing he had um some of his
[17:29] services online were um healing services
[17:32] at the end you know and i just started
[17:34] putting myself in that situation and
[17:36] claiming my healing and just like that
[17:38] the pain disappeared from having severe
[17:40] pain and couldn't walk and stuff you
[17:42] know i the pain just went
[17:45] and fast forward to 2020.
[17:48] i'm just trying to make this as
[17:50] condensed as possible um
[17:53] then came covered in 2020.
[17:56] i was out of the country because i do a
[17:58] lot of travel for my job and i was out
[18:01] of the country when um trinidad
[18:03] announced his first private case
[18:06] i barely made it back into the country
[18:08] many days before the lockdown
[18:12] and i had so of course i had to go into
[18:14] quarantine
[18:16] um which was not too much of a terrible
[18:18] time because i didn't think you know
[18:20] that i had contracted covert
[18:22] um
[18:23] however
[18:24] the first period of lockdown came along
[18:27] and then the second period came around
[18:30] and i had to continue going to work
[18:32] because um i work
[18:34] for a u.s foreign minister the u.s
[18:36] embassy
[18:38] and their service is considered um
[18:40] essential so and i work as a customer
[18:43] support in the it department so i had to
[18:46] go to work
[18:47] and one day one of um my colleagues came
[18:51] in we have like three buildings
[18:53] um that we work with around the savannah
[18:56] and down the cipriani boulevard
[18:59] and she worked in one of the other
[19:01] buildings so it was a surprise to me
[19:03] that she came to this building i work in
[19:05] the main building which is where people
[19:06] go for visas and stuff
[19:08] and um she asked me for support and i
[19:11] went to her i was wearing a mask
[19:14] and um
[19:15] she was not but i noticed that she was
[19:18] coughing myself and another girl were
[19:19] there with her
[19:21] and i asked her i said why are you here
[19:23] if you why you puffed why are you here
[19:25] in coffee like that she said oh i just
[19:28] started coughing the night before but um
[19:31] this is not anything to do with prove it
[19:32] so you don't have to worry
[19:34] but so i stayed with her about 30
[19:36] minutes and it was a friday never forgot
[19:38] that
[19:39] and um on the sunday
[19:43] sunday night i got a call from my
[19:44] management officer
[19:46] and it was one of the toughest calls
[19:48] i've ever experienced he told me that um
[19:50] i was a primary contact of someone who
[19:55] who was um
[19:56] who had to be tested for covert and they
[19:59] would call me back if the person is
[20:00] positive but from that day i had to stay
[20:03] in quarantine
[20:05] and this was myself and a few of my
[20:07] other colleagues and um
[20:09] [Music]
[20:10] so we connected with each other and
[20:13] you know kind of was each other's
[20:15] support and even we convinced ourselves
[20:16] that this person was not going to be
[20:18] covered positive
[20:19] but anyway on the wednesday we got the
[20:22] call that the person was indeed
[20:24] positive
[20:25] and
[20:26] satan is such a
[20:28] busy man
[20:30] all kinds of i mean we all started
[20:32] experiencing symptoms immediately
[20:34] phantom symptoms you know and um through
[20:37] the soul you know i um
[20:40] it started really playing on my mind and
[20:42] i had i think i started having a lot of
[20:44] anxieties you know and
[20:47] again i started immersing myself in in
[20:50] um in the profit messages
[20:54] and then one day
[20:55] i was speaking to a sister who was in
[20:58] the church where i grew up sister leah
[21:01] and she fellowshipped her brother rata
[21:02] and george's ministry
[21:05] and um i you know i was telling her what
[21:07] i was going through and stuff and um
[21:10] she said you and i will sign up a prayer
[21:11] for you um and i started tuning in to
[21:13] brother rotten george's um tuesday night
[21:16] services which was on i think he has
[21:18] prayer services on a tuesday
[21:20] and
[21:21] he prayed with me
[21:23] and i felt a little bit better but the
[21:25] anxiety was still there you know
[21:27] and um
[21:29] during that time headstone tabernacle
[21:32] kept popping up on my feet and that's
[21:34] how i started listening to her because i
[21:36] knew nothing about brotherhood and stuff
[21:38] my cousin timothy just to back up a
[21:41] little bit who's in grenada i know he
[21:43] was connected with the church here but i
[21:45] didn't know the details of it you know
[21:47] he would come here we would um he would
[21:49] stay at my brothers and we would talk
[21:51] and stuff and i know he would go off the
[21:52] santa grande at the church
[21:54] anyway um
[21:57] during that time of the
[21:59] the um the lockdown with me the
[22:02] commenting
[22:03] um coming to the end of the
[22:06] quarantine
[22:08] um it seems like all the anxiety that i
[22:10] was feeling just caught up with me
[22:13] and i had um one day i just decided to
[22:16] test my
[22:17] my pressure because i wasn't feeling too
[22:19] well
[22:20] and my pressure was um had gone to
[22:23] i mean this is from someone who usually
[22:25] has a pressure of 114 over 73 you know
[22:29] at its worst
[22:31] i usually have like they tell me
[22:33] teenager pressure
[22:35] um my pressure was 173 over 115.
[22:39] so i knew something was wrong and i i
[22:41] called upon
[22:43] my brother no who lives in the states
[22:45] he's a doctor
[22:47] i called him up and i sat down his name
[22:49] is jairus i said jairus um
[22:51] i don't know what's going on but i'm
[22:53] reading this pressure machine and you
[22:54] know i took it a couple of times and
[22:56] it's reading
[22:58] and i told him what it was
[22:59] and he's a very calm person you know and
[23:02] he said um he said june
[23:04] um do you have any aspirin at home so i
[23:06] said um yeah she said go take an aspirin
[23:08] right now
[23:09] and he said um
[23:11] just get yourself an emergency room
[23:13] immediately because you're in danger you
[23:15] said a number that's the bottom number
[23:18] which is 115 you were in danger of
[23:20] experiencing a stroke right now
[23:23] so um i took the aspirin and i went to
[23:26] um west shore medical the a
[23:29] um
[23:31] admittance
[23:32] and they um they admitted me but before
[23:35] they did so i was sitting in the arm in
[23:37] the waiting room
[23:39] and i didn't know that one of their
[23:40] protocols was to do a cover test so i
[23:43] was there waiting and the next thing i
[23:45] saw someone come a doctor and took me
[23:48] into a room and she said um
[23:50] you know i have to do a prover test but
[23:52] that's all i needed to hear
[23:54] my pressure just tuned up to over 200
[23:58] and uh she took the ramp up test and um
[24:01] there i was waiting on the results in 15
[24:03] minutes they got the result and i was
[24:05] negative you know i know
[24:07] but the anxiety and everything you know
[24:09] the pressure don't just come down
[24:11] you know i know to make a long story
[24:13] short i um
[24:15] i went through a process where my doctor
[24:17] had to i had to see my family doctor
[24:20] and she went through putting me on a
[24:22] monitor because my pressure was just
[24:24] high and she put me on medication it
[24:26] would fluctuate and just go up high and
[24:29] um she told me this is the worst kind of
[24:31] pressure to deal with you know um
[24:33] pressure
[24:34] from stress
[24:36] and
[24:37] she eventually um put me on a monitor to
[24:40] see what was really going on with me and
[24:42] through that time you know i was just
[24:44] praying and saying god just deliver me
[24:47] and of course
[24:48] listening to the messages all the time
[24:50] and tuning in to the services i started
[24:52] tuning into headstudent tabernacle
[24:55] sunday services after the tcc services
[24:58] that i was attending and
[25:01] when she got back the results from the
[25:03] monitor she said jim you don't have a
[25:05] problem i'm taking you off all your meds
[25:08] you know and um after that just like
[25:10] that everything just normalized you know
[25:13] um
[25:15] and
[25:17] i promised god i said you know god when
[25:19] this lockdown is over i'm going to
[25:22] visit a church i didn't say that i was
[25:24] going to stay i said i was going to
[25:25] visit either brother george's church or
[25:28] headstone tabernacle as i was listening
[25:30] to the mastery services online
[25:33] and um it so happened when things
[25:35] reopened brother george i think had like
[25:37] a rusted service you know so i didn't
[25:39] want to infringe and um i was speaking
[25:41] to my cousin and grenada tim and i said
[25:44] you know tim tell me my brother um we're
[25:46] headstone tabernacle services in ghani
[25:49] um he said you and hold on i'll contact
[25:52] somebody and they'll call you back and i
[25:54] guess he contacted brother ovid and who
[25:56] contracted with a black one
[25:58] only to realize brother blackman is
[25:59] practically my neighbor and he said um
[26:02] you can ride with me to go you know um
[26:05] and i said okay good because i really
[26:07] don't like driving long distances so i
[26:09] had no intentions of staying at
[26:11] headstone tamilnadu i just found it was
[26:13] just too far away from me
[26:15] and um
[26:17] and to cut a long story short here i am
[26:19] still you know um
[26:22] and i give glory and thanks to god i
[26:24] just like thank you for your welcoming
[26:26] and
[26:27] and i i really enjoy the services and i
[26:30] think this is where god wants me to be
[26:32] because my i remember timothy telling me
[26:35] um said you and that's a good place to
[26:36] go and you should go there and i said
[26:38] timothy i'm just leaving it in the hands
[26:39] of god he will lead me
[26:41] and i believe that he led me here
[26:44] and just to give you a quick um one
[26:46] quick um testimony i hope i'm not
[26:49] overstaying my time
[26:52] um a couple just about a couple months
[26:54] or so ago i um i had the opportunity to
[26:57] apply for a promotion at my place of
[27:00] work
[27:01] and the promotion was advertised and i
[27:03] went ahead and applied for it um we have
[27:06] an online system to apply
[27:08] and
[27:09] i wasn't aware that the online system
[27:12] requires that you fulfill all the
[27:14] prerequisites or else it can reject your
[27:17] um your
[27:18] application anyway i submitted on my
[27:22] application but before i did i remember
[27:24] someone that brother isaac preached
[27:26] anyone he talked about um
[27:29] whenever you are going to
[27:32] you know
[27:33] in certain circumstances you should
[27:35] always like calm but god say god i
[27:38] acknowledge you and whatever i am going
[27:40] to do you know and i started putting
[27:41] that into practice even before this
[27:43] situation so before submitting the
[27:46] application i said god i acknowledge you
[27:48] and submitted this application
[27:51] and i will tell you after what i
[27:53] submitted the application a day before
[27:55] the deadline and as soon as i submitted
[27:57] it um about an hour later the hr manager
[28:01] called me
[28:02] now the hr manager and i were not
[28:04] friends um
[28:06] we were not enemies but we were not
[28:08] friends i didn't think that she would
[28:10] look out for me um
[28:12] and
[28:13] it's so strange back up a little bit
[28:15] before that you know i was just like
[28:16] trying to i was praying that god would
[28:19] cleanse my heart from having anything
[28:21] against anyone you know give me a spirit
[28:23] of forgiveness and i was mentioning her
[28:26] name in it you know and
[28:27] other colleagues in the office you know
[28:29] who i felt i had things in my heart
[28:31] again what i don't know but i still
[28:33] prayed about it and this is the person
[28:36] who called me she said um she said june
[28:40] you know there's an up there's uh
[28:42] an opening in your section you know um
[28:44] are you planning to apply for it and i
[28:46] know she called me saying this knowing
[28:48] that she had already seen that i had
[28:50] submitted my application
[28:52] and i said well yes i am
[28:54] as a matter of fact i just showed you a
[28:57] few about an hour ago submitted my
[29:00] application
[29:01] and she said oh you did i said yeah she
[29:04] said okay hold on let me check it
[29:06] and she checked it and she came out she
[29:08] said june june you have something wrong
[29:09] in it you have something wrong you know
[29:11] this is someone rejected so i said i did
[29:14] she said um yes she said pull it back
[29:16] and fix it so i said well i didn't know
[29:18] i could pull it back but i said what
[29:20] furthermore what am i gonna say so i
[29:21] said as far as i knew i submitted what i
[29:24] needed to submit i said there was one of
[29:26] the prerequisites which was a certain
[29:28] degree and i know i did not have it so i
[29:31] um but i put all the other
[29:33] qualifications that i have she said well
[29:35] i can't really tell you because um
[29:38] that will be given you an unfair
[29:39] advantage but then she relented and she
[29:42] said but june you do have a degree i
[29:44] said i do
[29:45] now we usually go to the um to virginia
[29:48] there's a campus in virginia to do it
[29:50] training and stuff she said all that
[29:52] training that you've done over the years
[29:54] is equivalent to um
[29:56] to a degree she said just go and pull
[29:59] back the application check that you have
[30:01] a degree and submit your transcript from
[30:03] the tom campus
[30:05] so i did that and um she said on when
[30:08] you do that just call me back tell me
[30:10] that you submitted it and i'll check and
[30:11] tell you if everything is okay
[30:14] so i did that and submitted the
[30:16] application again and called on tool now
[30:18] that i did and um she called me back and
[30:20] she said good june you did you did good
[30:23] the application is perfect now
[30:25] and um by the next
[30:27] by the monday because the friday was the
[30:29] deadline the monday she pulled and she
[30:31] said you were selected for an interview
[30:34] so i went into the interview and
[30:36] again i acknowledged god in the
[30:38] interview
[30:39] and um came out and by the next day i
[30:42] got a call saying that i got the
[30:44] position
[30:45] so again i just want to give glory and
[30:48] honor to god i mean it may seem small
[30:50] but um
[30:51] to me i know it was a big deal and and i
[30:54] see god's hand in it because as brother
[30:57] i was telling brother blackmon about the
[30:59] testimony after it happened and he told
[31:01] me he said you know june
[31:04] god cares about the things that you care
[31:06] about you know and um
[31:08] and i thank you by the black man for
[31:10] that
[31:11] and
[31:13] and i think that is
[31:15] i give glory and honor thank you brother
[31:17] ovid for another isaac for giving me
[31:20] this opportunity and i hope this
[31:22] testimony has served to encourage
[31:24] someone
[31:25] thank you
[31:35] praise the lord gideon
[31:55] okay i trust that you could hear me at
[31:58] this point
[31:59] i was just a slight technical glitch
[32:03] sister june i i think we want to say god
[32:06] richly bless you on behalf of everyone
[32:08] here all the listeners both present
[32:11] tense and those who see it afterwards i
[32:13] think it truly was a blessing i think it
[32:15] underscored as well the fact that jesus
[32:17] christ is seen yesterday today and
[32:19] forever you heard you heard for yourself
[32:22] present tense
[32:24] testimony is here and she really honed
[32:28] into a whole host of things like faith
[32:31] how she held onto certain things
[32:34] listening to the
[32:35] messages as well practicing something
[32:37] she would have heard as well so i think
[32:39] it really really was insights insightful
[32:42] and i i think we feel like we know you a
[32:44] whole lot better now we also know that
[32:47] brother tim is your cousin now
[32:48] alright so great to have you here and
[32:50] great to have heard the testimony that
[32:53] you shared
[32:54] i know she also mentioned brother
[32:56] blackmon
[32:58] um and his rule in her coming up to
[33:01] grant to granny and fellowshipping with
[33:03] him and stuff and it is it was a
[33:06] coincidental it's interesting
[33:08] that the next person that we would like
[33:10] to ask to share a testimony is brother
[33:14] michael blackman himself he's a man who
[33:16] needs no real introduction he operates
[33:19] at such a professional level in so many
[33:21] varied capacities as it relates to the
[33:24] international convention we would lose
[33:26] um as a musician as well and and a
[33:29] coordinator and facilitator i know he
[33:31] does a whole host of other things so
[33:34] without much ado let me invite brother
[33:36] blackburn to share with us
[33:44] hi goodnight
[33:45] hi am i on
[33:47] yes
[33:48] okay
[33:50] so i just want to share a couple
[33:52] testimonies with you any given time
[33:55] um
[33:56] first i just want to give a little
[33:58] background
[33:59] in terms of
[34:00] of my
[34:02] my own background and that that is
[34:03] because i think the testimony that i
[34:06] share
[34:07] i wanted to understand the background
[34:08] that i came from
[34:10] when i came to the lord just prior to
[34:12] that
[34:13] i was an atheist i didn't believe in the
[34:15] existence of god i was marxist
[34:19] and i was a leader in a marxist
[34:21] underground movement in those days some
[34:23] of you all might be too young to know
[34:25] but it was against the laws of the
[34:27] country to to be to be marxists we were
[34:29] communists we were the first communist
[34:31] party in trinidad so everything had to
[34:33] be organized underground
[34:35] and i was the cell leader you could be
[34:37] arrested for just having marxist
[34:39] literature
[34:41] um so i didn't believe in god at all
[34:43] and i worked with military and we were
[34:46] saying the same things and he would
[34:47] quote from the bible and i would take it
[34:49] from a moral and ethical standpoint so
[34:51] then i came to the law
[34:54] but that's just a background so i just
[34:56] wanted to keep that in mind when i talk
[34:58] about some of the things that god has
[35:00] done let me say just up front
[35:03] that everything that has happened to me
[35:05] that has been good god did it it's a
[35:08] song that i listen to almost every day
[35:10] now
[35:11] um
[35:12] so you know just recently we were in the
[35:15] in the bible study you were the last one
[35:18] we were dealing with deeply
[35:19] and the next day and i went back into it
[35:21] and i was i was reading ahead and back
[35:23] on you know all over
[35:25] um those those scriptures that we were
[35:27] studying
[35:28] and i looked again at david fighting the
[35:31] beer
[35:32] and the lion
[35:34] and you know just recently i was looking
[35:36] at something called one of the animal
[35:38] suggestions animal planet and people
[35:40] were given survivors people who survived
[35:42] animal attacks
[35:44] and one lady spoke about being attacked
[35:46] back there
[35:47] and when she spoke about the ferocity of
[35:49] that bill
[35:51] hearing her bones and her head cracking
[35:53] under the grip of that bill the bear
[35:55] ripping away her face
[35:57] seeing things on the ground and
[35:58] realizing that it was her joy
[36:00] and seeing
[36:01] a river of blood running something
[36:03] running on the ground and realizing that
[36:05] she was bleeding out when i thought of
[36:07] the ferocity of appeal and having seen
[36:09] some of these shows on lions and stuff
[36:12] the first thought that went through my
[36:14] mind when i was sitting in my group home
[36:16] early in the morning reading that
[36:18] scripture
[36:19] was that
[36:20] this is almost impossible
[36:22] for this little boy
[36:24] to actually you know slay this bill
[36:26] lastly this life
[36:28] so at that point you know something came
[36:30] back to me when my mother-in-law had
[36:32] said to me you know michael you know a
[36:34] lot of these stories in the bible
[36:36] they're just parables they're just
[36:37] allegories they're just stories that
[36:39] amount you know to give us other
[36:41] paragraphs you know like he subscribes
[36:44] and as that thought came
[36:46] another thought came right after
[36:49] he is the god of the impossible
[36:52] so i was saying you know but this is
[36:53] impossible it's always impossible for
[36:55] this young boy to slay up here and a
[36:57] liar
[36:59] and right away they told him he is god
[37:02] of the impossible
[37:04] and you know just prior to that
[37:05] brotherhood had asked if i wanted to
[37:08] give a testimony i said yes
[37:10] i know so many different things that
[37:12] have happened in my life that i'm not
[37:13] trying to figure out which one right or
[37:14] what god said to me that is what you
[37:16] will testify you will testify of the god
[37:19] of the impossible and you will testify
[37:22] of the things that he has done in your
[37:23] life where it seemed impossible
[37:26] so i kind of put them in chronological
[37:28] roles when i just come to the road my
[37:30] son jabari had a severe case of taunts
[37:32] tons it's called adenoids and
[37:35] really bad he would get it i would have
[37:37] to go to my cousin and always was a
[37:39] pediatrician she would give him
[37:41] antibiotics
[37:42] and it would be good for a while and
[37:43] then it would happen so after that
[37:45] happened for several years she came one
[37:47] day when i went to she said this this is
[37:49] chronic it has to come out and she gave
[37:51] me a letter to go to a doctor and not
[37:53] circular root call doctor
[37:55] was a specialist
[37:56] when i went to dr akan he just opened
[37:59] her body ah
[38:00] shauna torchlight
[38:02] and he said it has to come out
[38:05] um so
[38:06] we i had to go and carry to barry to be
[38:08] weird and stuff
[38:09] but in my heart i just felt like i
[38:12] didn't want him to be operated up
[38:15] i prayed about it
[38:17] and i asked the church to pray about it
[38:20] and um
[38:21] i didn't i didn't go on with him
[38:23] and he was good because he took me
[38:24] antibiotic
[38:26] but as some while later
[38:29] maybe a year or so later he got a really
[38:31] severe attack again
[38:34] and um this time you know antibiotics
[38:36] nothing you know he was just fever and
[38:38] pain and stuff
[38:40] and i said to the lord you know during
[38:42] that time i had gotten a word from the
[38:43] lord through a muslim person guy who's a
[38:46] mecca you know and there's one of the
[38:48] things that i want to say to the god can
[38:50] use anybody to speak to you once you
[38:53] have your ears spiritually open your
[38:54] heart
[38:56] and this guy from this this muslim
[38:58] doctor who lives in the street lived in
[39:00] my street um
[39:02] he just
[39:03] said something about asked me about
[39:05] jabari and i said that you know he has
[39:07] this and he said
[39:09] um don't worry about it
[39:11] he growled a bit and i took that as a
[39:13] load
[39:14] so that when this other attack came a
[39:16] year or so later i put her fleece before
[39:19] they go i said listen
[39:21] the first time that barney had this
[39:22] attack i was a young christian i was
[39:24] very fanatical i threw away his meds
[39:28] i said this time of fever should not go
[39:30] more than three days if on the third day
[39:32] the fever doesn't go i am going to carry
[39:35] when they're going to take out his
[39:36] tonsils
[39:37] on the third day we had a sleepless
[39:40] you having we had church was in a bakery
[39:43] on de la rule
[39:45] and i told you about i said i will put
[39:46] in a prayer request for your syllabus or
[39:49] you can go and he said he would go seven
[39:51] years old six or seven years old i said
[39:54] well you know
[39:55] you don't have to go if you're not
[39:56] because i knew he wasn't well he was hiv
[39:58] it was just the partner
[40:00] but he insisted that he wanted to go
[40:02] with us
[40:03] and we went to this service and we and
[40:04] you know joanna carried into the crying
[40:06] room
[40:07] and there was such an anointing on his
[40:09] syllabus from the song so this is the
[40:11] end you know they prayed for him and so
[40:13] on that we forgot about him actually but
[40:15] normally if anything had happened our
[40:17] sister would come across so the other
[40:18] service i said to the drugs you know
[40:20] we haven't checked the barrier at all
[40:22] so joann went into the crying room and
[40:24] jabari was as cool as a cucumber
[40:27] and that was the last time jabari has
[40:29] had a problem with his sponsors the last
[40:32] time so you see one one doctor said then
[40:36] i asked when can't you do anything said
[40:38] no it's not possible dr khan said
[40:40] because that was the first thing i
[40:41] wanted
[40:43] is it he said no there's no way he can
[40:45] keep it it has to come over but god
[40:48] proved that he is god of the
[40:50] impossible i'm going to give you another
[40:53] testimony
[40:55] just a little forex problem i don't know
[40:56] i'm doing anything chronological order
[40:58] one night
[41:00] we went by my mother to watch some
[41:01] clothes our machine was down
[41:03] and when we came out i had just bought a
[41:06] mark too
[41:07] a car second car and when we came out
[41:09] the car was nowhere to be fought rain
[41:11] was falling before we fell asleep there
[41:13] by her there's two kids there's our two
[41:14] children
[41:16] and um
[41:17] there was no car to be fought
[41:19] so i asked joanna probably she had moved
[41:21] the car and i would do so though
[41:23] so the car was gone stolen
[41:26] the very next year when i went into
[41:27] school where i was working
[41:30] um there's a muslim guy
[41:32] who you know i will talk with and so on
[41:34] and i said to him sammy
[41:36] call the guy that i was i said samuel
[41:38] somebody stole my car last night and he
[41:41] said to me so how are you looking so
[41:42] happy and joyful
[41:44] i said well
[41:45] so he watched me i said yeah he knew my
[41:48] testimony right you know he was a
[41:50] christian right he said what the lord
[41:52] will bring it back here now i say
[41:54] correct
[41:55] he said so why did nothing tell you when
[41:56] it was spent it was being stolen i said
[41:58] because the lord didn't tell job
[42:00] anything either it
[42:02] that was my answer to him i said he
[42:03] wouldn't tell joke anything either
[42:06] do you know that i got back my card the
[42:08] first the next day now before that
[42:10] happened
[42:12] samuel did everything to tell me it
[42:13] would be impossible for me to get that
[42:15] my car his wife voted an insurance
[42:18] company at the time it was home
[42:19] insurance and someone sat down there
[42:22] and told me about the number of people
[42:24] who had lost their cars and that they
[42:26] would carry in those days they would
[42:27] carry a kind to the k they would strip
[42:29] it and then they would burn the chassis
[42:31] so that you couldn't find the chassis
[42:32] number and once you couldn't get the
[42:34] chassis number the insurance could not
[42:36] cover your plate so you basically told
[42:38] me forget it you will not be getting
[42:41] back your car the very next day i had my
[42:44] car and as i drove into the school the
[42:47] first person i saw was something
[42:49] his eyes were as wide as a saucer
[42:52] so you know
[42:53] i that was my testimony to him so he
[42:56] shook his head and he said boy are you
[42:57] real lucky i said ready you call it luck
[43:01] sometime after that he challenged again
[43:03] and i said that i had to get a place
[43:05] and i had to i could only pay five
[43:07] hundred dollars he told me here you'll
[43:08] get a place but without talks because in
[43:10] those days i stood studio apartment cost
[43:12] eight hundred dollars
[43:14] sister boys had just rented one for her
[43:16] for her mother eight hundred dollars in
[43:18] belmont
[43:19] long story short i got one for the same
[43:22] price i said five hundred dollars when
[43:23] the man handed me you're a very lucky
[43:26] man because the the woman who owned the
[43:28] house her son wanted it for his
[43:30] girlfriend he didn't know why he was
[43:31] giving it to me call him look i just
[43:33] smiled on myself because i knew it
[43:34] wasn't up and of course i didn't have
[43:36] one talks i had two bedrooms and not
[43:38] only that i had a water tank and a bell
[43:40] and then it was actually renovated for
[43:42] the same price so again samuel said it
[43:45] was impossible for me to get anything
[43:48] around tomorrow i told him i had to be a
[43:49] wrong talk because i was living santa
[43:51] cruz and i couldn't have been traveling
[43:52] he said it was impossible
[43:54] and god showed he was going to be
[43:56] possible of the impossible
[43:59] gonna go forward again there came a time
[44:01] when we needed our own place we needed
[44:02] together please
[44:04] so we went and we started to rent this
[44:06] place and within two days a guy showed
[44:08] up from the bank and said
[44:09] that the place that we were in was
[44:11] belong to the bank and we would we will
[44:13] rent him from our man with a banker full
[44:15] closer
[44:17] it started us on a whole trek i remember
[44:19] going back to church it was very you
[44:21] know kind of full on because you know we
[44:23] have been all over the place
[44:25] and i said to sister griffin as an older
[44:27] sister what's called sister voices mom
[44:29] i said to her
[44:31] you know the place that we went into we
[44:33] have to move and she said no brother
[44:35] blackman you put your foot down wherever
[44:37] you put solely on foot is yours you
[44:38] claim that
[44:39] and that all sainted sister really fired
[44:42] me up so i accepted that my faith rose
[44:46] but
[44:47] i still had this situation on my hands
[44:50] long story short i had to go to fcb
[44:53] because fcb were the people who were
[44:55] foreclosed on it was i think it was ncb
[44:57] at the time
[44:59] i was able to talk to the manager the
[45:00] manager the director of ncp the ceo
[45:04] a guy called arnold piggott he became a
[45:06] government minister afterwards his words
[45:08] to meanwhile
[45:10] it is not possible so i asked him i said
[45:12] what is the situation with these units
[45:14] because there were six stone houses
[45:16] our things weren't even on practice yet
[45:20] he said but the first thing again we are
[45:21] not renting those thumb houses we are
[45:23] selling them and the one you're in is
[45:25] sold so it's impossible so there's
[45:27] nothing you can do for me he said no
[45:29] it's impossible for you to get one
[45:31] they're all taken that one is sold and i
[45:34] advise you to put on your jet skis and
[45:36] get up as fast as you can or your family
[45:40] will be on the road for christmas what's
[45:41] this words besides even speaking frankly
[45:44] he said your family will be on the road
[45:47] by christmas if you don't put on your
[45:49] jets he's a ghetto
[45:50] so of course you know that that was my
[45:52] last hope so i'm thinking you know yes
[45:54] this thing is what i will call because
[45:55] you know i've accepted my faith and then
[45:57] i went and i got this this brick wall
[46:00] and one day you know with all these
[46:02] different things went to my mind as we
[46:03] still got the house
[46:05] i am walking
[46:06] waiting for a taxi and i'm speaking to
[46:08] myself audibly
[46:10] and i said wow you know this was exactly
[46:12] what i prayed for i prayed for certain
[46:13] things you know definitely i wanted a
[46:15] certain number of bedrooms because i had
[46:17] one daughter she needed an old space i
[46:19] prayed about the size of a yard i prayed
[46:21] about the place where the hall should be
[46:23] everything was exactly what i prayed for
[46:26] and i said imagine i pray for all these
[46:28] things and then this thing comes exactly
[46:30] how it is supposed to be all of a sudden
[46:32] there are giants in the land and as i
[46:34] said that were giants in the land
[46:37] right away
[46:39] something just went through boom
[46:41] and i said oh my god
[46:43] here it is that we read about it and
[46:46] here i am doing the very thing that god
[46:48] got so annoyed with them for
[46:50] i had seen god's hand with the mark
[46:52] twice he got down with jabari
[46:56] the apartment
[46:57] why was i adulting god at this point and
[47:00] the word giants is what brought it home
[47:02] to me because it was really chance in
[47:03] iraq i said no i understand why god was
[47:06] so
[47:07] you know so so angered them because i
[47:10] was doing the same thing and i i used to
[47:12] sit on watching and the prophet always
[47:13] spoke about we look at the bible we will
[47:16] see when we are actually living it all
[47:18] so here i was saying how could these
[47:20] people actually be dismayed by giants in
[47:23] the land and here i was in my time in my
[47:26] trial in my time going into the promised
[47:28] land just what i had prayed for god had
[47:31] given it to me and i saw giants and i
[47:33] was you know
[47:35] and i went back home
[47:36] i turned around in the street and i
[47:38] remember when i said to my wife i said
[47:39] let me tell you something
[47:41] god just spoke to me
[47:43] we will either have this unit or one of
[47:46] these six in here but we will not be
[47:48] moving from here
[47:49] where my testimony is that very unit
[47:52] that they said that i couldn't get and
[47:53] was impossible for me to buy
[47:56] is mine still is mine
[47:58] and not only that
[47:59] we bought it without any money we had no
[48:02] money we prayed we walked into the today
[48:05] to the agent the real estate agent
[48:08] she never saw us in her life and she
[48:10] picked up her phone and opponent manager
[48:12] and said i have two very good friends
[48:13] here a bank manager you know about that
[48:15] i didn't have money in
[48:17] we often said because workers
[48:19] and she said to him i have two very good
[48:21] friends here and they need fifteen
[48:23] thousand dollars to pay them on the unit
[48:25] i'm sorry but that happened and then i
[48:27] didn't have any money
[48:29] to close the deal or do anything and god
[48:31] kept that place as is for 10 years the
[48:35] lawyers kept asking themselves they kept
[48:37] saying to me we don't understand why we
[48:39] cannot finish this thing and you pay
[48:41] your money and close this deal it was
[48:43] because i had no money it stayed as it
[48:46] was until i had changed jobs and had
[48:48] enough money to close the deal and to
[48:51] pay for the unit properly so again he
[48:53] showed that he is god of the impossible
[48:56] because i bought that place without the
[48:58] stent in my hand
[49:00] there was another thing that happened
[49:03] with my son my last son gile
[49:06] one day he was running in the house he
[49:07] was two years old three years old and he
[49:09] hit her chair and his lips split in two
[49:12] and at that point
[49:14] i just told my wife only together and i
[49:16] got some
[49:17] uh salt butter and some an ice and i put
[49:21] it on it and i told up all day together
[49:22] and i went upstairs to the chain of
[49:24] clothes
[49:25] while i was changing my clothes a very
[49:26] short prayer i said a very short
[49:28] descriptor i said lord you know
[49:30] i don't want this child all stitched up
[49:34] and i would really want you to heal this
[49:36] quickly and that was all i said just
[49:38] hear this
[49:39] and i put on my clothes i called
[49:42] sinclair medical and i told them that i
[49:44] was bringing a child in and i wanted
[49:46] them i didn't want any stitching i
[49:47] wanted them to use a particular type of
[49:49] plaster that would hold it together i
[49:52] asked them how much it would cost they
[49:53] said 200.
[49:54] in those days you know money was in
[49:56] short supply in my life
[49:58] so i had to
[50:00] go to the bank make sure i just had
[50:02] about two hundred dollars took it all
[50:04] and all i was telling my wife is keep
[50:06] squeezing that lip i didn't know why i
[50:07] was saying that just keep spinning don't
[50:09] let it cook
[50:10] and she had him in her arms and he went
[50:13] to sync america they took him in
[50:16] about 10 minutes later the doctor came
[50:18] out he said um i said so what's the
[50:20] situation i said using the plaster
[50:23] he said there's
[50:24] nothing nothing to i can't do anything i
[50:26] said what do you mean you can't do
[50:27] anything and he said the words again
[50:29] well there's nothing i can possibly do
[50:31] it's not possible
[50:33] so i heard the words again not possible
[50:36] and in my mind i said it means that this
[50:38] child will have to stay with us and let
[50:40] the split in two for the rest of his
[50:41] life
[50:43] and i said what do you mean so i'll come
[50:45] and see so i'm i'm walking expected to
[50:47] see the lip split in two because he said
[50:49] it's not possible for him to do anything
[50:51] and when he what he did was showed me is
[50:53] i did a public level he showed me that
[50:55] it was actually healed already so there
[50:57] was nothing for him to do that's why
[50:59] they said it's not possible for me to do
[51:00] anything
[51:01] was completely healed he told me to use
[51:03] a little glycerine on it which i never
[51:05] really did and um after this day
[51:08] he doesn't even have a scar in that
[51:10] place so that was healing half an hour
[51:13] between home and the hospital
[51:15] and then the last thing i want to leave
[51:17] with you
[51:18] is we know about you know we be good
[51:20] about when the prophet had to do
[51:22] something on that plane of the city
[51:24] i had an experience where i was supposed
[51:26] to go to a conference in martinique and
[51:29] i wasn't the most senior officer so you
[51:30] know it was favorite a lot of people
[51:32] would see next to me were very upset
[51:34] that i was chosen
[51:37] and i had a country i heard a car and
[51:39] there was a guy who said driving the car
[51:40] was supposed to pick me up to come to
[51:42] the airport
[51:44] the flight of the fight it was ten
[51:45] o'clock
[51:46] i knew that they would close all flights
[51:48] maybe on that one before so he was
[51:49] supposed to pick memphis eight o'clock
[51:51] came nine o'clock came quarter to turn
[51:53] him and then the skies got very dark and
[51:56] there was a like a whole
[51:58] storm that was going on in tom where he
[52:00] was supposed to pick me up he picked me
[52:02] up at maybe five to ten that flight was
[52:04] supposed to be about 10. so when he came
[52:05] to pick me up
[52:07] i was so destroyed i said what sense
[52:09] does it make no so he kept insisting no
[52:12] let's go let's not say i said dave the
[52:14] flight leaves at ten o'clock it is five
[52:16] to ten that flight is closed so there's
[52:18] no way i said look at this sweater and
[52:21] he picked up my suitcase and he put it
[52:23] in the car so i followed him so we're
[52:25] driving up the road
[52:27] flood water all over the road we had to
[52:28] actually swim through some of the water
[52:30] with a car even the banks had overflowed
[52:33] by the golden growth prison because we
[52:35] came off the bus and came through there
[52:38] and i'm saying by what sense does this
[52:40] make but for some reason he was
[52:42] insisting and i was good
[52:43] so we're walking
[52:45] the only airport and he takes it to this
[52:48] and he goes ahead and i'm following him
[52:51] in my mind what i'm saying is what am i
[52:53] going to tell my boss about why i did
[52:55] not get on that flight to my conference
[52:58] that everybody else felt i shouldn't go
[53:00] to when i was
[53:01] so you could you know how dumb i was
[53:03] feeling
[53:04] and as he was walking to the count i
[53:06] looked at the content i saw two of the
[53:09] people who would book you and they were
[53:10] still on the counter which was strange
[53:12] so i walked to the compton and i said
[53:15] i am supposed to be on the flight
[53:16] tomorrow you're gonna say okay do you
[53:18] have your passport in the ticket and i
[53:19] said the flight is still here
[53:21] and the lady said yes the flight has
[53:23] been delayed
[53:29] nobody could nobody could could um
[53:34] believe you know or or experience what i
[53:37] went through at that point in time i
[53:38] mean it was like impossible that flight
[53:40] was still there so i said
[53:43] how come i mean i was actually talking
[53:44] about i said how could they fly
[53:46] she said well there was some problem and
[53:48] there was a delay and so
[53:50] let me tell you something that's why it
[53:51] was indeed i got on the flight when we
[53:53] got on the flight
[53:55] there was some little issue and there
[53:56] was some spoke coming from something
[53:58] i was not dismayed at all because i knew
[54:00] the same god who kept that fight for me
[54:03] would keep me all the way to my
[54:06] so i just wanted to read with you
[54:08] that
[54:09] all the black skies that i had and the
[54:11] flood water that i had to get to that
[54:13] airport all this disappointment
[54:16] all the different negatives that you
[54:18] know is not possible this can't happen
[54:21] god is god of the impossible
[54:24] god is still god
[54:26] and no matter what
[54:29] they see
[54:30] his word is what he is faithful to and
[54:34] we must remember who we are and the
[54:37] privileges and the authority we have
[54:40] and the promises we have and all we have
[54:43] to do is claim them because even when
[54:44] our faith is no god is still working on
[54:46] the other side so god bless you states i
[54:48] hope this encourages somebody it might
[54:50] be in a situation that you think it's
[54:51] impossible
[54:53] but remember he is god of the impossible

[55:51] uh with a black man i'm another
[55:54] miracle of impossibility standing in
[55:56] front of you today
[55:58] my wife and i live in the northern part
[56:00] of the state of indiana
[56:02] my wife's side of she's in the other
[56:04] room listening
[56:05] and um
[56:07] i am here because i really want to let
[56:11] everyone know
[56:13] that this gospel is real
[56:17] i didn't know it
[56:18] last year
[56:20] although i've been in the message for
[56:21] more than 30 years
[56:24] but it's real
[56:26] so
[56:27] um it's kind of hard to go back but
[56:31] maybe i'll just give you a little bit of
[56:32] my background
[56:33] in the long journey i feel that moses
[56:36] it took the lord 40 years almost to beat
[56:38] it out
[56:39] beat me to a certain place where he
[56:41] could
[56:42] get me where he wanted me
[56:44] so um
[56:46] just as
[56:47] a background um
[56:49] my family as a little boy we were in the
[56:51] southern states i was born down there
[56:54] and they were church of christ
[56:57] which was funny to me now because that
[56:59] was brother branham said that was his
[57:01] argent arkan arc enemy was the church of
[57:04] christ but that's what my family was
[57:07] but um i had a good bible upbringing
[57:09] with my mother
[57:11] making sure we knew the word especially
[57:13] could
[57:14] um
[57:16] there was a point where things happen in
[57:18] our family as often does and
[57:20] my family split and we moved up north
[57:23] when i was about nine up here in indiana
[57:26] and um
[57:27] went out like everyone
[57:29] born in sin and shape and iniquity i
[57:31] come into this world speaking lies
[57:34] and in the world like any other kid
[57:38] i was a musician i played
[57:42] rock guitar i went out with the guys i
[57:45] did about everything that you can think
[57:47] of that a
[57:49] teenager would do
[57:51] got into a lot of things that i
[57:53] regret today even
[57:55] but
[57:56] in the midst of all that there was
[57:58] always somewhere no hunger for god
[58:01] behind all that sin
[58:04] so one day i was about 17.
[58:08] and uh
[58:09] i was with a friend who's older me about
[58:11] five or six years older
[58:13] uh in his apartment and we were talking
[58:15] and turns out he was a backslidden
[58:16] christian
[58:17] and he told me about a church he had
[58:19] attended now the church of christ where
[58:21] we had come out of we were no longer
[58:23] attending the
[58:24] church of christ they believe in
[58:26] regeneration or a new birth by baptism
[58:30] so basically i had in my head well i'm
[58:32] going to live the way i want to live
[58:34] until a certain point and then i'll get
[58:35] baptized a little fire insurance you
[58:38] know i'm gonna make it
[58:40] and that's the way you believed and it
[58:41] was just thing that you you know you
[58:43] lived a good life you got baptized and
[58:45] you were saved
[58:46] and um
[58:48] i've it's it was really
[58:51] pretty easy compared to even the
[58:52] catholics just get baptized here done
[58:55] so i thought
[58:57] uh he was telling me though this friend
[58:59] about this church he was in
[59:01] and for me it's like you get baptized
[59:04] you live a good life and you go to
[59:05] heaven
[59:07] and in this church he had backslid from
[59:10] he told me about how the presence of god
[59:14] would come down in that church
[59:16] and the anointing and
[59:18] so many different supernatural things
[59:20] that happen
[59:21] and uh
[59:23] you know at the time we were drinking
[59:24] wine and he's telling me about god
[59:28] and so but something struck me and i was
[59:32] like you mean you can know god while
[59:35] you're still on the earth
[59:37] and it struck me
[59:38] really hit me hard
[59:40] and of course i went back out in the
[59:42] world but that stuck with me that
[59:44] there was a way to know god while i'm
[59:46] still here on the earth
[59:49] it was totally new
[59:51] so
[59:52] um back in the world then somewhere in
[59:54] december 1983 i found he was going to a
[59:57] church and locally here so we started
[59:59] going to church together
[1:00:01] and at that time there were a lot of
[1:00:03] charismatic
[1:00:05] groups charismatic catholics charismatic
[1:00:07] mennonites suddenly the
[1:00:09] tongues and speaking in tongues and all
[1:00:11] that was a big thing
[1:00:13] and so
[1:00:14] i was really really hungry
[1:00:17] because um
[1:00:19] i was in church and i thought you were
[1:00:21] supposed to be able to just stop all the
[1:00:23] stuff you were doing
[1:00:25] that you had been doing in the world
[1:00:27] and just suddenly you're good and you go
[1:00:29] to church because that was what we were
[1:00:32] raised you'd be good you go to church
[1:00:33] you go to heaven
[1:00:36] i could not stop
[1:00:38] i could not stop
[1:00:40] the unclean habits
[1:00:42] the unholy
[1:00:43] desires i could not stop it and i'm a
[1:00:46] young man
[1:00:47] you know
[1:00:48] 21 22 years old
[1:00:51] and
[1:00:52] you know suddenly i'm in the light of
[1:00:54] god's word and i'm finding myself a
[1:00:57] sinner
[1:00:59] and
[1:01:00] so
[1:01:02] you know there was no
[1:01:04] no one to tell a young man what to do
[1:01:07] you know
[1:01:09] so but i was still hungry so kept going
[1:01:12] um
[1:01:13] i found out there was a church a remnant
[1:01:15] of the church you told me about meeting
[1:01:17] down near fort wayne indiana which is
[1:01:19] about hours south of here
[1:01:21] and i started going down there and
[1:01:25] still hungering for god i had some
[1:01:27] supernatural experiences and things i
[1:01:29] had some dreams i had
[1:01:31] but none of that changed me
[1:01:34] and i was still struggling with my past
[1:01:38] so
[1:01:41] that that group that was down there fort
[1:01:43] wayne decided that they were going to
[1:01:44] look for a place to baptize now they
[1:01:46] baptized
[1:01:47] three times forward father son holy
[1:01:49] ghost that was the way they baptized
[1:01:52] so they wanted a place to baptize so
[1:01:54] they went
[1:01:55] to a place halfway between here in fort
[1:01:57] wayne called kendeville to a man's house
[1:02:00] he lived on a small lake he had a house
[1:02:02] on the lake and they were looking around
[1:02:04] there
[1:02:05] and his name was brother maurice mark
[1:02:07] court
[1:02:09] and so they talking to him somehow they
[1:02:12] decided to have a bible study on tuesday
[1:02:14] nights which
[1:02:16] here we are having bible studies on
[1:02:18] tuesday nights
[1:02:19] but we had bible studies on tuesday
[1:02:21] nights and it was halfway for me and
[1:02:22] halfway for the little house it was a
[1:02:24] little house church
[1:02:26] and
[1:02:27] brother marcourt
[1:02:30] they
[1:02:31] met at his house
[1:02:33] and
[1:02:35] the pastor the little church house group
[1:02:38] that we had began the bible study and he
[1:02:40] asked brother mark court a question
[1:02:43] and we were studying the book of daniel
[1:02:45] and brother mark court
[1:02:47] took the statue of nebuchadnezzar in his
[1:02:50] dream
[1:02:51] and went all the way from never
[1:02:52] connected his time all the way down to
[1:02:54] our time
[1:02:55] and explained the whole saying and you
[1:02:58] know
[1:02:59] uh spoke about daniel it was
[1:03:02] such
[1:03:03] an experience
[1:03:04] i've never heard anything like in my
[1:03:06] life
[1:03:08] uh obviously as you guessed he was
[1:03:09] quoting the prophet but i didn't know
[1:03:12] and um
[1:03:14] i literally felt like falling on my face
[1:03:16] on his living room floor it was so
[1:03:19] incredible
[1:03:20] i drove home that night and in the dark
[1:03:23] stunned
[1:03:25] and i said what is this i've never heard
[1:03:27] anything like this before so we started
[1:03:30] meeting his house every week for about a
[1:03:33] year
[1:03:34] and
[1:03:34] they
[1:03:36] the people i was with the pastor would
[1:03:38] say something and turn it over to
[1:03:39] brother marquardt they just wanted him
[1:03:40] to talk
[1:03:42] and he would expound on the message
[1:03:44] talking about brother branham and it
[1:03:45] turns out
[1:03:47] he
[1:03:49] he was not in the message
[1:03:51] per se
[1:03:52] he was in this a retired assembly of god
[1:03:55] preacher he'd been one for 30 years
[1:03:59] but he had as when he was first saved
[1:04:02] he and his wife sister mary helen
[1:04:05] had an opportunity to be in brother
[1:04:06] branno's meetings in
[1:04:08] probably the early 50s
[1:04:10] in fort wayne indiana
[1:04:13] and brother mark court and sister mary
[1:04:14] helen were there when the little boy
[1:04:15] jumped out of brother branham's arms
[1:04:18] you know the crippled boy uh the ladies
[1:04:20] i believe it was a midnight lady threw
[1:04:21] her hands up in the air and the piano
[1:04:23] kept playing and
[1:04:24] you know they were there
[1:04:27] and
[1:04:28] uh they um saw some of those things
[1:04:31] sister mary helen told me that there was
[1:04:33] a time he was casting a devil out of an
[1:04:35] epileptic boy and he asked everyone to
[1:04:38] bow their heads and she said a lady did
[1:04:41] not in the audience
[1:04:43] and that devil went from the boy to that
[1:04:46] woman in the audience
[1:04:48] and sister mary helen told me she said
[1:04:50] that woman went down between the seats
[1:04:52] screaming
[1:04:53] as he said we went out to pray for her
[1:04:55] but there was nothing we could do
[1:04:57] so they had seen all these things
[1:04:59] and the lord even told brother mark
[1:05:01] court
[1:05:02] you know and this obviously this is
[1:05:04] before they were in the ministry they
[1:05:06] were just young christians
[1:05:09] and the lord and brother mark went and
[1:05:10] prayed way back he had a place in the
[1:05:13] warehouse he worked out where he prayed
[1:05:14] and he said lord what is this
[1:05:16] and so anyway he told me is malachi 4 5
[1:05:20] 6.
[1:05:21] but strangely enough brother marcourt
[1:05:23] though he was in further meetings
[1:05:26] didn't really have an understanding
[1:05:28] it wasn't until the 1980s after he was
[1:05:30] retired
[1:05:31] he was in the pentecostal church
[1:05:34] a trinitarian church with a revelation
[1:05:36] of the deity of jesus christ baptizing
[1:05:39] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:05:41] so he was an unusual man
[1:05:44] so anyway
[1:05:46] he
[1:05:47] began in our bible studies then to talk
[1:05:50] about the baptism in the name of the
[1:05:51] lord jesus christ
[1:05:53] and uh i saw the truth of it
[1:05:56] and more than that i wanted the baptism
[1:05:58] of the holy ghost really bad and that's
[1:06:01] the first time i've been with the
[1:06:02] charismatic groups and all that
[1:06:04] and you know i spoke in tongues i had i
[1:06:07] had a real experience with
[1:06:08] interpretations
[1:06:09] it did not change me
[1:06:12] and so here i saw a promise
[1:06:15] if i repent and be baptized in the name
[1:06:17] of jesus christ i would receive the holy
[1:06:19] ghost
[1:06:20] and i tell you i dove in there quick
[1:06:24] so
[1:06:25] fast forward so
[1:06:27] after i was baptized then the bible
[1:06:29] study just
[1:06:31] although the people used to still come
[1:06:33] out with all his testimonies still come
[1:06:35] out to his house and baptize a
[1:06:36] trinitarian
[1:06:39] um
[1:06:40] so anyway i was looking for a church
[1:06:42] then after that because
[1:06:44] obviously i couldn't go back to where
[1:06:45] they were at i had
[1:06:47] with brother branham i just was
[1:06:49] it was totally different
[1:06:51] i did struggle some about whether or not
[1:06:54] this was true
[1:06:55] because they had little books you know
[1:06:57] the little messages and my stepfather
[1:06:59] was jehovah's witness well they had
[1:07:01] little books too like the watchtower and
[1:07:03] the weight magazine so i was like what
[1:07:05] are these little books they have
[1:07:07] so i was struggling a little bit but
[1:07:09] he gave me church ages seven seals
[1:07:13] and footsteps you know uh
[1:07:16] in in the
[1:07:18] in the sands of time
[1:07:19] and um i read that and i read in there
[1:07:22] where brother brown was 14 and he got
[1:07:23] shot through the legs
[1:07:25] by a friend was in the hospital dying
[1:07:28] and bleeding
[1:07:29] and had a vision that he had went down
[1:07:31] to the regions of the dam
[1:07:33] damned and he was falling down down down
[1:07:37] and he was saying
[1:07:38] i was reaching out and i was calling for
[1:07:40] my dad and he was not there and i was
[1:07:42] trying to catch myself and i was
[1:07:44] tumbling and tumbling and he was talking
[1:07:46] like this
[1:07:47] and i read this in there
[1:07:50] and i went home at that time i had moved
[1:07:52] back in with my parents because i was
[1:07:54] kind of going through a rough time
[1:07:57] and
[1:07:58] turned on the abc
[1:08:00] the evening news there was a young man
[1:08:02] at the last story they had in boston
[1:08:05] a young man there with his father he had
[1:08:07] aids
[1:08:08] and the young man said i keep having
[1:08:10] this dream that i'm falling and i'm
[1:08:12] falling and falling and i'm calling for
[1:08:15] my father and he's not there word for
[1:08:17] word but brother banham said
[1:08:20] and so you know
[1:08:22] again it was a major
[1:08:25] it was amazing
[1:08:27] so anyway the other
[1:08:29] i left the other church and i asked
[1:08:31] brother mark where i should go he said
[1:08:32] well there's a church in fort wayne
[1:08:35] so he went down i went to the church and
[1:08:38] that was
[1:08:39] um there was brother tommy dillard
[1:08:41] brought over
[1:08:42] and
[1:08:43] walked into there
[1:08:45] and you know i felt like brother
[1:08:46] clarence you know last week
[1:08:49] when we had the first testimony he said
[1:08:50] these people are like angels
[1:08:53] and i
[1:08:54] you know i was like whoa
[1:08:56] you know
[1:08:57] and so ah you know everybody's talking
[1:08:59] about the lord and and you know there
[1:09:01] had that was 1987 in the fall uh in the
[1:09:04] summer i think it started and um
[1:09:07] there had been
[1:09:08] uh an outpouring in 1983 and there was
[1:09:11] still a lot of talk about it
[1:09:13] and i was like wow this is for me
[1:09:15] because you know this is what i was
[1:09:17] wanting you know
[1:09:18] and um
[1:09:22] time went on and i was i was eating the
[1:09:24] messages up
[1:09:25] i'll try to hurry here
[1:09:27] they um
[1:09:30] um well went through a lot of things
[1:09:32] there there was a lot of things i was
[1:09:34] asking people about how did you receive
[1:09:36] the holy ghost did you receive the holy
[1:09:38] ghost
[1:09:39] and uh i said it were you sealed and
[1:09:41] then one brother is like well
[1:09:43] somebody gave me a tape for brother
[1:09:45] branham's
[1:09:46] life story and when he cried i cried
[1:09:48] and that was his
[1:09:51] you know i got all kinds of stories like
[1:09:52] that about the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:54] you know my brother said he fell asleep
[1:09:56] he woke up and he was different i don't
[1:09:57] know
[1:09:58] so i'm still looking and searching
[1:10:01] um
[1:10:03] my wife and i that i met her
[1:10:05] through that church
[1:10:07] and we were married in 1991.
[1:10:11] so
[1:10:12] my friends i had a lot of spiritual
[1:10:15] experiences i had
[1:10:18] been to the conventions i saw brother
[1:10:19] ovid there the first time
[1:10:21] there were times when we had worship and
[1:10:23] worship services and
[1:10:25] you felt like you were on cloud nine and
[1:10:27] i felt thought sometimes i never knew
[1:10:29] heaven could be so great down here on
[1:10:31] earth
[1:10:32] and then
[1:10:33] walk out
[1:10:35] go back home
[1:10:36] in a couple of days
[1:10:38] i'm myself again
[1:10:40] the same problems the same
[1:10:43] issues the same
[1:10:45] chains
[1:10:46] i had chains on me
[1:10:49] so
[1:10:51] going quickly forward then we came we um
[1:10:55] went to some different churches and
[1:10:57] whatnot um all within the seven thunders
[1:11:02] and in the end um
[1:11:04] the church in fort wayne dissolved so we
[1:11:06] hooked into new york city in 2002 i
[1:11:09] think 2003 somewhere in there
[1:11:13] and so
[1:11:15] um
[1:11:16] you all know that there were some rough
[1:11:18] times in there during those last 10
[1:11:20] years
[1:11:21] and so that that last bit
[1:11:24] when as brother overcalled it the jw
[1:11:26] virus was there
[1:11:28] and the writing on the wall
[1:11:30] and uh it was
[1:11:31] and i was still
[1:11:33] there with so much condemnation coming
[1:11:35] out at that point
[1:11:36] i you could almost cut it with a knife
[1:11:38] it was so thick and so heavy and i was
[1:11:41] already feeling
[1:11:42] like i'm never worthy
[1:11:45] and then all that came and it just beat
[1:11:47] me down real bad
[1:11:49] but i didn't know where to go because
[1:11:50] you know we were just
[1:11:52] kind of like those people knew what they
[1:11:54] were talking about all those years and i
[1:11:57] looking back i as soon as i walked into
[1:11:59] fort wayne church way back
[1:12:01] looking back now i started following men
[1:12:05] that was when i walked into fort wayne
[1:12:06] church that was where i started
[1:12:08] following men
[1:12:09] and that was the big mistake
[1:12:12] so i followed them right off the cliff
[1:12:16] and
[1:12:17] and
[1:12:18] that whole thing at the end of the new
[1:12:20] york church before it dissolved into
[1:12:22] pieces
[1:12:24] killed my family
[1:12:26] my youngest two really were really hurt
[1:12:29] my young son
[1:12:31] was furious at me he was a teenager
[1:12:34] why did you not stop
[1:12:36] going
[1:12:38] and so we really had a rough time
[1:12:40] about that time brother overcame and
[1:12:43] preached at new york after brother
[1:12:45] coleman passed
[1:12:46] and he was saying something about
[1:12:49] i think you'd open a radiator or
[1:12:51] something and got burned and you were
[1:12:53] saying you know that wasn't satan it was
[1:12:56] me i messed up
[1:12:58] and
[1:12:59] it inspired me
[1:13:01] i said wow that's really humble he said
[1:13:04] him i never heard a minister say he
[1:13:06] messed up
[1:13:10] so i
[1:13:11] i excuse me
[1:13:14] i gotta
[1:13:15] my timer went off
[1:13:17] uh-oh
[1:13:19] all right
[1:13:20] so i'm out of time but either way
[1:13:22] i took that
[1:13:23] and um
[1:13:25] i took those words from brother over and
[1:13:27] i went and spoke to my son and he asked
[1:13:29] he was mad and he said why did you stay
[1:13:31] in that church
[1:13:33] and i said i'm messed up
[1:13:36] i messed up bad
[1:13:37] and those words saved my relationship
[1:13:40] with my son
[1:13:41] so fast forward again brother over came
[1:13:44] in 2014 to pennsylvania
[1:13:47] and
[1:13:48] i was destroyed
[1:13:50] by then
[1:13:52] i pretty much quit
[1:13:54] i had failed as a christian
[1:13:56] i had failed my family i'd failed
[1:13:59] everything
[1:14:00] and he came in 2014
[1:14:03] and i don't remember a whole lot i'm
[1:14:04] sorry but i do remember your piece the
[1:14:07] plumb line you know holding it to the
[1:14:09] plummet
[1:14:10] and that was like the anchor that set
[1:14:12] something in the ground that i could
[1:14:14] hold on to because i was like yeah
[1:14:16] that's right that's right
[1:14:18] it never the lord never changes ever
[1:14:21] i can hold on to that
[1:14:23] so then we saw you again in 2016 in
[1:14:25] kentucky
[1:14:28] we uh
[1:14:30] began watching services on 2013
[1:14:34] and uh to be honest i had no desire to
[1:14:38] watch anything but sunday
[1:14:40] i didn't worship i didn't read my bible
[1:14:43] i didn't pray i was a mess
[1:14:45] and my dear wife was praying
[1:14:48] she prayed a lot
[1:14:50] bless her heart
[1:14:52] and um
[1:14:54] and those
[1:14:56] same things i struggled with that 14 17
[1:14:59] 19
[1:15:01] unholy thoughts unholy
[1:15:03] all kinds of things they were still
[1:15:05] there after all these years after
[1:15:07] anointings after everything
[1:15:11] so
[1:15:12] i think if i'll i'll cut it off here and
[1:15:15] if i maybe just read brother over the
[1:15:17] testimony that i wrote to you
[1:15:20] and basically i explained to brother of
[1:15:22] it that
[1:15:23] uh it's
[1:15:25] that um
[1:15:26] he called us
[1:15:28] and invited us to a bible study on
[1:15:30] september 7th of last year
[1:15:34] so anyway
[1:15:36] i had told him i said i'd like to know
[1:15:38] for the last 10 years starting with the
[1:15:40] events that eventually led to the
[1:15:41] dissolution in new york church
[1:15:43] i've been very low
[1:15:46] much due to the devastating effects
[1:15:47] those events had on myself and my family
[1:15:50] and i explained to him how bad it was
[1:15:53] and i said i could not worship i
[1:15:55] couldn't hardly utter a prayer other
[1:15:56] than a wild cry not to die that way
[1:16:00] so when you called us this past
[1:16:01] september 7th we were on our way back
[1:16:03] from my sister my daughter lily's house
[1:16:06] in ohio
[1:16:07] and brother ovin
[1:16:09] rang my phone invited us to a bible
[1:16:11] study september 7th
[1:16:13] never forget her brother
[1:16:14] never
[1:16:16] and i he said he invited us to a bible
[1:16:18] study the next night and i was literally
[1:16:21] sitting there going why is that you hear
[1:16:23] and die
[1:16:24] and i accepted his invitation a very
[1:16:27] gracious invitation so the first bible
[1:16:29] study the next night was why is that
[1:16:31] here why said you hear and die brother
[1:16:34] isaac
[1:16:36] and of course i knew the lord enough
[1:16:38] despite i never
[1:16:40] i always believed the lord never changed
[1:16:42] it was me i never could blame him for
[1:16:44] anything to happen it was all me so i
[1:16:47] knew that was the lord
[1:16:49] he had for me
[1:16:50] so i wrote there um
[1:16:55] that something at that point from that
[1:16:57] first
[1:16:58] bible study began to turn around
[1:17:00] with each prayer meeting and bible study
[1:17:02] i began to gain strength
[1:17:05] the glimpse we were given into god's
[1:17:06] nature as a prophetic being
[1:17:09] calling those things that are not as so
[1:17:11] they were begin to open something up
[1:17:13] and i began to see how it applied to me
[1:17:16] and the promises god gave to us to live
[1:17:18] in this age because i knew all the
[1:17:19] promises you know that's one good thing
[1:17:21] i had a lot of words
[1:17:24] so at one time brother ovid was
[1:17:27] exhorting us and he said
[1:17:29] that
[1:17:30] god is mysterious he said he didn't just
[1:17:33] decide to become mysterious he is
[1:17:35] mysterious
[1:17:36] and at that point something struck me
[1:17:39] that the lord meant what he said i
[1:17:42] always thought
[1:17:44] different
[1:17:45] but he meant
[1:17:46] what he said when he said it was in
[1:17:48] mysterious and something turned and said
[1:17:50] well then that means he meant everything
[1:17:52] else he said
[1:17:55] so um
[1:17:58] anyway
[1:18:02] so anyway something broken me at that
[1:18:04] point i began to read the whole bible
[1:18:06] and message differently
[1:18:08] for the first time after more than three
[1:18:11] decades decades of trying to walk as a
[1:18:13] christian with a white knuckle grip
[1:18:15] trying to hang on trying to do right and
[1:18:17] still struggling
[1:18:19] i began to truly understand the gospel
[1:18:22] and to catch a vision of christ's blood
[1:18:23] shed for me so that could have bold and
[1:18:25] direct access to the throne of grace
[1:18:28] the effect of finally letting go of all
[1:18:30] my own efforts to be a christian
[1:18:33] and simply accepting god's provided
[1:18:35] sacrifice brought about results that i
[1:18:37] was not
[1:18:38] expecting albeit without any sensation
[1:18:42] or am i being aware of it at the time
[1:18:46] things that had me bound in chains all
[1:18:48] my life simply dropped away
[1:18:51] i don't even know when it happened
[1:18:54] they just left
[1:18:56] it's so completely gone
[1:18:58] that it's almost as if it never happened
[1:19:01] it's an odd feeling nor have i ever had
[1:19:03] an experience like that in my life
[1:19:05] so
[1:19:07] it was
[1:19:09] the preaching of the of the blood that
[1:19:11] did it brother ovid and if i may quickly
[1:19:14] it was the word made flesh was the
[1:19:17] message that really nailed it home for
[1:19:19] me you had said a number of things
[1:19:20] before that i was catching revelations
[1:19:22] about the blood
[1:19:24] and if i may humbly say friends it's i'm
[1:19:28] talking about ovid but it was the
[1:19:30] ministry of reconciliation the lord
[1:19:32] jesus himself talking to me
[1:19:34] through a ministry and
[1:19:36] i
[1:19:38] i'm
[1:19:39] that's what i feel for real
[1:19:42] so
[1:19:43] in the word made flesh he was talking
[1:19:45] about leaving the human humanistic realm
[1:19:46] he was quoting brother branham and
[1:19:48] beloved said that's when you're willing
[1:19:50] to let go of your past
[1:19:53] and to let go of your fears
[1:19:56] let go of your failures
[1:19:59] you just let go
[1:20:01] and let the spirit move in
[1:20:06] and that that hit
[1:20:08] heart
[1:20:09] i saw it
[1:20:10] i said i can do that
[1:20:13] and then the ending prayer
[1:20:16] he said father god i thank you this
[1:20:17] morning
[1:20:18] what you have given to me i have given
[1:20:20] to them
[1:20:22] father god may the word become flesh
[1:20:24] lord may thee invisibly become visible
[1:20:26] among them
[1:20:28] visit them with your revelation divine
[1:20:30] revelation
[1:20:31] bring them out of the humanistic lord
[1:20:34] may they not see their past
[1:20:36] their failures
[1:20:38] their shortcomings your blood has atoned
[1:20:41] for it all
[1:20:42] lord you have forgiven them you have
[1:20:44] cleansed them you have looked beyond
[1:20:46] their faults and saw what they had need
[1:20:48] of
[1:20:49] and father you come down the word may
[1:20:51] flesh to rescue us lord and deliver
[1:20:53] deliver us and redeem us
[1:20:55] father may be with them a special way
[1:20:57] and he closed out the prayer and so i
[1:21:00] took those words i went back to the tape
[1:21:03] wrote them all down
[1:21:05] and i took that and the one scripture
[1:21:07] was on my mind if we confess our sins
[1:21:10] first john 1 9 he is faithful and just
[1:21:12] to forgive our sins and to cleanse us
[1:21:14] from all unrighteousness
[1:21:16] and i just wanted to be forgiven
[1:21:19] i just wanted to be able to pick up the
[1:21:20] pieces and walk forward
[1:21:22] i had no idea that the lord had brought
[1:21:25] me to a place where he fulfilled that
[1:21:27] last part
[1:21:29] cleanses from all unrighteousness
[1:21:31] i didn't know that that was real
[1:21:34] and
[1:21:35] things that used to bother me if i may
[1:21:38] say
[1:21:39] going into a store during the summer
[1:21:41] time people are dressed a certain way
[1:21:43] those things bothered me horribly
[1:21:47] i really struggled
[1:21:49] after what happened to me at the end of
[1:21:52] last year is when this happened
[1:21:54] no problem
[1:21:55] those devils have no breach
[1:21:58] i feel
[1:21:59] sincerely like i'm walking
[1:22:02] encapsulated in bulletproof glass
[1:22:05] i feel them
[1:22:06] think on the glass but they cannot reach
[1:22:08] me anymore
[1:22:10] and the whole
[1:22:12] everything has changed
[1:22:15] um everything has changed
[1:22:17] the message the bible everything is
[1:22:20] brand new for me
[1:22:22] so
[1:22:22] i really didn't know what happened but i
[1:22:24] did know i was thinking one day i don't
[1:22:27] know what this is
[1:22:28] i don't know what happened but i do know
[1:22:30] that i had the evidence of any things
[1:22:33] unseen
[1:22:35] something real has happened so anyway
[1:22:39] god bless you all i am on my way to
[1:22:42] glory
[1:22:45] i have
[1:22:47] i am totally changed totally changed it
[1:22:50] took an awful long time but i am so glad
[1:22:53] and every day
[1:22:54] i i just look in astonishment at where
[1:22:58] i'm at now where i only dream to be for
[1:23:01] all those years i don't dream to be a
[1:23:03] christian i dream to be able to testify
[1:23:06] like this
[1:23:07] so
[1:23:08] god bless you thank you for being
[1:23:09] patient
[1:23:11] and uh i'm i want to encourage all that
[1:23:15] this
[1:23:16] it truly is real i never knew it was i
[1:23:19] heard the gospels years and years but it
[1:23:21] became real to me and it manifested
[1:23:23] itself in my life god bless you and
[1:23:25] thank you
[1:23:32] amen
[1:23:33] god bless you thank you so much uh
[1:23:35] brother kelly
[1:23:36] uh god bless you
[1:23:38] and um
[1:23:39] how many are blessed tonight you
[1:23:41] appreciate the service tonight
[1:23:44] uh what a time in the presence of the
[1:23:46] lord tonight i really want to thank
[1:23:50] brother kelly south
[1:23:52] brother michael blackman sister june
[1:23:53] redhead for sharing
[1:23:56] uh
[1:23:57] so much about what the lord has
[1:23:59] not only done for you
[1:24:01] and through you
[1:24:03] but also sharing of yourselves
[1:24:05] you know we are we are family you know
[1:24:08] and it's it's such a touching moment
[1:24:11] to see that
[1:24:13] the the reality of god working through
[1:24:16] situations to prove himself
[1:24:19] that we could truly learn to trust him
[1:24:22] and it's a process of learning the same
[1:24:24] way jesus had to learn obedience
[1:24:27] through the things that he suffered
[1:24:29] so
[1:24:30] hearing and seeing the feet
[1:24:32] you know i was saying to my wife as the
[1:24:34] service is progressing this is so
[1:24:36] faith-building
[1:24:38] because it is is it's it's it's each one
[1:24:40] encouraging one another you know so my
[1:24:43] heart is blessed and there's such an
[1:24:45] anointing
[1:24:46] that i feel coming off of this service
[1:24:49] because this is what god loves he loves
[1:24:51] when we talk about him he loves when we
[1:24:53] fellowship around him and god loves when
[1:24:57] we become his advertisement board that's
[1:24:59] that's a phrase with a branham used
[1:25:02] that through each of us
[1:25:04] we have a testimony we have valleys we
[1:25:06] have mountains
[1:25:08] but as with the blackburn said
[1:25:10] everything he has achieved everything
[1:25:12] that has happened in his life every
[1:25:13] positive thing can look at he could see
[1:25:15] that it's god
[1:25:16] and it's the same thing but the kelly is
[1:25:18] saying it's the same things it's a
[1:25:20] junior saying it's the same thing that
[1:25:22] was said in the last meeting that we had
[1:25:25] uh when brother clarence spoke and when
[1:25:28] sister donna spoke and brother andy
[1:25:29] spoke and and each of us can look at
[1:25:32] moments in our lives even sometimes when
[1:25:34] we don't realize it and you and you're
[1:25:36] hearing each one saying
[1:25:37] at the time i didn't even realize that
[1:25:39] it was god at the time i didn't realize
[1:25:41] what i was learning at the time i didn't
[1:25:43] realize what god was taking me to but
[1:25:44] when i look back i realized he was
[1:25:46] holding me
[1:25:48] you know that that when i thought i was
[1:25:50] one set of footprints it was really god
[1:25:52] carrying me so i'm really blessed
[1:25:54] tonight and i trust that this is such an
[1:25:56] encouragement to us
[1:25:58] to keep holding on
[1:26:00] to keep pressing forward your change
[1:26:02] is going to come your blessing is going
[1:26:05] to come the promise and the promises
[1:26:07] that we have been holding on for all of
[1:26:09] these years
[1:26:11] is going to come to pass because god is
[1:26:13] going to confirm his word i really want
[1:26:15] to pray now
[1:26:17] not and before we pray to close that i
[1:26:19] want to pray for those who are on this
[1:26:21] call tonight
[1:26:24] there are so many different situations
[1:26:26] in in in this room
[1:26:28] and there's so much about so many
[1:26:31] of us that that we may never know unless
[1:26:33] somebody shares it
[1:26:34] you know so i know i'm encouraged and i
[1:26:38] know that given the opportunity there'll
[1:26:40] be something that that you would say
[1:26:41] that would encourage someone
[1:26:43] but i want to just encourage you in
[1:26:45] prayer tonight before we close out so
[1:26:47] can we bow our heads for word of prayer
[1:26:51] our gracious heavenly father we thank

[1:27:13] so precious to me because i believe
[1:27:15] in a god of a reality that we have to be
[1:27:18] able to have a practical application of
[1:27:21] this thing that you are as interested in
[1:27:24] our everyday life as you are interested

[1:28:28] is anybody else going through what i'm
[1:28:30] going through but lord through these
[1:28:31] testimonies you're showing us that the
[1:28:33] struggle is real but the promise is even
[1:28:35] more real so father may you comfort your
