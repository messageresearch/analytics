[1:13:40] Thanksgiving in our hearts with a praise
[1:13:41] and our lips with worship from our very
[1:13:44] inner being may you bless the reading of
[1:13:46] the word open our understanding we pray
[1:13:49] a special blessing this morning on our
[1:13:50] pastor that he would touch it from the
[1:13:52] crown of his head to the soul of his
[1:13:54] feet touch him in his body even now if
[1:13:57] there's anyone else in our midst this
[1:13:59] morning who might not be feeling well
[1:14:01] may the angel of the Lord move to them
[1:14:03] and even as the word is ministered Lord
[1:14:05] may they get a charge from their to offy
[1:14:08] this morning Lord we know this is
[1:14:10] there's no better place to be this
[1:14:11] morning than in your house this morning
[1:14:13] there's no place I'd rather be than in
[1:14:15] your house this morning so Lord may you
[1:14:18] speak to us from your word and anoint
[1:14:19] your people anoint me touch my vocal
[1:14:22] cords and Lord let nothing be said that
[1:14:24] you don't want say
[1:14:25] and may what you once said be said with
[1:14:27] boldness Lord with the Precision Lord to
[1:14:30] cut through situations and to bring
[1:14:31] Deliverance to your people Lord you said
[1:14:34] that they that are well have no need of
[1:14:35] a physician so we are here this morning
[1:14:38] looking for the great physician to
[1:14:39] minister to the a of Salvation may you
[1:14:42] take complete control in the precious
[1:14:43] name of Jesus Christ and the church says
[1:14:46] and the church says amen so before you
[1:14:49] take your seats if you would turn with
[1:14:51] me to three portions of scripture I
[1:14:53] greet you this morning in the precious
[1:14:55] name of our Lord Jesus Christ it's
[1:14:57] certainly a great privilege to be here
[1:14:59] in the house of the Lord one more time
[1:15:01] it's not something we could ever take
[1:15:03] for granted and we are looking to take
[1:15:06] full opportunity and advantage of what
[1:15:09] God has for us today the word teaches us
[1:15:12] that you get what you expect so I trust
[1:15:14] you have great expectation this morning
[1:15:17] and we are looking for God to bless in a
[1:15:18] might way so reading uh from The Book of
[1:15:22] Psalms we're going to read Psalms 85
[1:15:25] Psalms 138 and 2 Kings 3 uh for our
[1:15:30] scripture reading this morning before we
[1:15:32] take our
[1:15:34] seats Psalms 85 and verse 6 will thou
[1:15:38] not revive us
[1:15:40] again anybody looking for a Revival
[1:15:43] anybody looking for something to move
[1:15:44] upon you that your walk is different
[1:15:47] your talk is different will thou not
[1:15:48] revive us again that thy people may
[1:15:50] rejoice in thee so there's a rejoicing
[1:15:53] that is connected to Revival there's a
[1:15:55] joy that's connected to Revival and I
[1:15:57] believe that we're in a season of
[1:15:59] entering into a bride's revival can the
[1:16:01] church say
[1:16:02] Amen Psalms
[1:16:04] 1387 though I walk in the midst of
[1:16:07] trouble thou wil revive me Hallelujah
[1:16:11] Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand
[1:16:13] against the wrath of mine enemies and
[1:16:14] thy right hand shall save me and reading
[1:16:17] 2 Kings 3 and reading verse 16 and he
[1:16:21] said thus sayeth the Lord make this
[1:16:24] Valley full of ditches for thus sayeth
[1:16:27] the Lord ye shall not see wind neither
[1:16:30] shall ye see rain yet that Valley shall
[1:16:33] be filled with water that ye may drink
[1:16:36] both ye and your cattle and your beast
[1:16:39] and this is but a light thing in the
[1:16:42] sight of the Lord he will deliver the
[1:16:44] moabites also into your hand and he
[1:16:47] shall Smite every fence City this is not
[1:16:50] the Open Cities now but the fence the
[1:16:52] protected oh my and every Choice City
[1:16:56] and shall F every good tree and stop all
[1:16:58] Wells of water and Mar every good piece
[1:17:01] of land with stones may the Lord had a
[1:17:03] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:17:06] may be seated this morning in the
[1:17:07] presence of the Lord certainly a great
[1:17:09] privilege to be here to fight the good
[1:17:12] fight of Fate amen and so I do want to
[1:17:16] take this opportunity to extend a happy
[1:17:20] anniversary to the pastor and his wife
[1:17:22] this morning 45 years
[1:17:28] amen I'm I I I I I am a direct
[1:17:31] beneficiary of that
[1:17:32] blessing and many of
[1:17:35] us direct beneficiaries of that blessing
[1:17:38] and we pray that the Lord would continue
[1:17:40] to bless them and strengthen them in
[1:17:42] this season as they set an example for
[1:17:45] us because that's what God allows us to
[1:17:47] see examples and these examples have an
[1:17:49] impact on those that have you know come
[1:17:51] on and on and on so that we too in this
[1:17:54] time of Darkness Darkness could shine
[1:17:56] and arise and shine for thy light is
[1:17:57] come we live in a time when families are
[1:17:59] under attack homes are under attack
[1:18:01] churches are under attack people are
[1:18:03] under attack and if you are not under
[1:18:05] attack you should be very
[1:18:07] worried because being under attack shows
[1:18:09] that there's a Target on you that the
[1:18:11] devil wants to destroy there's something
[1:18:12] about you that the devil is after so if
[1:18:14] you are not under some kind of pressure
[1:18:16] this morning you should be very worried
[1:18:18] so count yourself privileged if the the
[1:18:20] the hounds of hell are against you count
[1:18:22] yourself blessed if this week was an
[1:18:25] upside down week and every turn you make
[1:18:27] there was something to try to stop you
[1:18:28] because the devil knows there's
[1:18:30] something in you that he's trying to
[1:18:31] derail trying to throw off trying to
[1:18:34] upset can the church say Amen so we in
[1:18:37] everything we give him thanks in the
[1:18:38] good times in the bad times and it's
[1:18:41] easy to thank him in the good times you
[1:18:42] know but how do you thank him in the bad
[1:18:45] times you ever stop to think about it
[1:18:47] some of these songs we sing We Sing it
[1:18:49] because it's the words of the song but
[1:18:51] in the good times praise His name in The
[1:18:53] Bad Times do the same meaning the same
[1:18:56] kind of praise and worship and thanks
[1:18:58] you give when it's good you don't do do
[1:19:01] a a a a lower level thanks and praise
[1:19:03] when things go bad you maintain the same
[1:19:05] level of praise and thanksgiving in the
[1:19:08] bad times when when things not working
[1:19:10] out you say Lord I Thank
[1:19:12] You Lord I praise you I Praise You In
[1:19:15] The Storm oh
[1:19:18] hallelujah oh my blessed be the name of
[1:19:21] the lord it's it's not easy to praise
[1:19:24] and in the storm it's not easy to be
[1:19:26] grateful in the storm in everything give
[1:19:30] thanks thanking him for the storm that
[1:19:32] you don't understand why this storm has
[1:19:34] your name on it but you're thanking him
[1:19:36] anyway even when you don't understand
[1:19:38] you thank him even when you don't feel
[1:19:40] like it you thank him Hallelujah and
[1:19:43] that's why worship is such an important
[1:19:45] thing and and the few words we had
[1:19:47] yesterday and how many were blessed by
[1:19:48] the evening
[1:19:52] yesterday I hope your batteries were
[1:19:54] recharged
[1:19:57] and you got some rest so you could put
[1:19:58] some fire in your service this morning
[1:20:00] it can be I'm the only one here with
[1:20:02] some
[1:20:04] fire
[1:20:06] Hallelujah Glory making sure the
[1:20:08] temperature is right brother George
[1:20:11] looking for God to do something special
[1:20:12] for us looking for God's people to
[1:20:15] create a Revival because the minister
[1:20:17] can never bring a Revival but it takes
[1:20:19] the people to bring a Revival to create
[1:20:20] a Revival and how you do it you do it in
[1:20:22] your home you do it in your prayer
[1:20:23] closet you do it in a taxi you do it
[1:20:25] when you're in school you do it when
[1:20:27] you're washing the dishes you do it in
[1:20:28] the taxi everywhere you go you're under
[1:20:30] expectation and you creating an
[1:20:32] atmosphere you know you could create the
[1:20:34] atmosphere around you Hallelujah I'm
[1:20:37] just encouraging you here this morning
[1:20:39] so I have a title this morning let us
[1:20:41] dig let us dig a valley full of ditches
[1:20:44] let us do something this is something
[1:20:46] that we have to do God is not coming and
[1:20:48] dig your
[1:20:49] Valley brother over can of dig your
[1:20:51] Valley full of ditches we all have to
[1:20:53] dig a valley for our blessing if you
[1:20:56] believe God is about to bless you
[1:20:57] there's got to be some kind of
[1:20:58] preparation made for you to receive your
[1:21:00] blessing so this is not the kind of
[1:21:03] service to look for the brother next to
[1:21:04] you to dig for you I want to know how
[1:21:06] much blessing you want because how much
[1:21:08] ditches you dig defines your
[1:21:11] expectation Hallelujah if you expect a
[1:21:14] little bit think a small ditch but if
[1:21:16] you're looking for healing then you take
[1:21:17] you have to take a ditch that could fit
[1:21:19] healing oh come on now somebody preach
[1:21:21] back to me if you looking for your
[1:21:22] family to be delivered you got to dig
[1:21:24] ditch that's big enough for the blessing
[1:21:26] of your family being
[1:21:28] delivered if you're looking for adoption
[1:21:30] you're going to have a ditch that could
[1:21:31] fit adoption come on now because in this
[1:21:34] rain this Harvest rain this this this
[1:21:36] this latter rain come on now it's about
[1:21:38] to fall it's fixing to fall we have not
[1:21:41] believed in vain all these years that we
[1:21:43] have come to church has not been in vain
[1:21:45] all these years of believing looking for
[1:21:47] something has not been there un vain
[1:21:50] Hallelujah so TI the letters d a valley

[1:22:39] changed faith for our body change faith
[1:22:42] for this gray hair to come back black oh
[1:22:46] Hallelujah and an inspiration restoring
[1:22:49] the Divine connection for your Revival
[1:22:52] because you can't have a Revival without
[1:22:54] a connection a personal connection a
[1:22:57] personal experience you must know God
[1:23:00] and God must know you Hallelujah this is
[1:23:02] nothing to do with church this is not
[1:23:04] what church you go to this is you and
[1:23:05] God and God and you in a secret closet
[1:23:08] having a connection having a
[1:23:09] relationship having Fellowship having
[1:23:12] communion every day should be communion
[1:23:14] every day should be Fellowship every day
[1:23:16] you rise above your situation every day
[1:23:19] you rise above your frustration you
[1:23:21] become bulletproof you become sin proof
[1:23:24] you become backside proof you become
[1:23:26] giving up proof you become allergic to
[1:23:29] giving up you become allergic to
[1:23:31] depression you become allergic to
[1:23:33] frustration not that situations wouldn't
[1:23:35] come to throw you off but something in
[1:23:37] you is greater than the
[1:23:42] situation can the church say
[1:23:45] Amen so looking for God to do something
[1:23:48] so you have to be under expectation
[1:23:51] listen God is not the risk taker
[1:23:57] God is not a
[1:23:58] restrictor Hallelujah everything God
[1:24:01] does with a pop well he does it knowing
[1:24:02] what's going to happen he he not taking
[1:24:05] a chance this morning on
[1:24:07] you can I say that one more time he
[1:24:10] eliminat
[1:24:13] risk anybody with me this morning so to
[1:24:16] guarantee that you make it he put names
[1:24:18] in the book because he not taking
[1:24:20] chances to guarantee that you're going
[1:24:22] to make it he sent his son to die for
[1:24:24] you so that there's blood so even when
[1:24:26] you make a mistake he wants to cancel
[1:24:29] risk so that the blood could speak for
[1:24:31] you when you can't speak for yourself oh
[1:24:33] you don't hear me this morning God is
[1:24:35] not taking a risk this morning on
[1:24:37] Redemption on salvation on adoption even
[1:24:40] on your family can the church say Amen
[1:24:42] oh
[1:24:45] hallelujah thank God for his Mercy thank
[1:24:48] God for his grace and thank God for
[1:24:50] making a
[1:24:52] way because God is not a taker Lazarus
[1:24:55] couldn't stay
[1:24:56] Dead come on now because God is a risk
[1:24:58] taker no son can end up in that
[1:25:01] situation and God can't take him out of
[1:25:03] every situation you end up in God knew
[1:25:05] the risk
[1:25:07] involved and he put a provision in there
[1:25:10] Daniel in the lion D was never at risk
[1:25:12] oh come
[1:25:14] on Hallelujah but Anthony preaching next
[1:25:17] to me say Danel had an insurance policy
[1:25:20] the insurance policy is you know you
[1:25:22] take insurance to deal with risk
[1:25:25] Daniel was never at risk when Moses was
[1:25:28] going down there on the Nile he was
[1:25:31] never at risk because God don't take
[1:25:35] risk God don't have to take a risk
[1:25:37] because he knows the end from the
[1:25:39] beginning if you know the end from
[1:25:41] before the beginning you don't take any
[1:25:43] risk and your end God knows your end he
[1:25:47] sees you in the Rapture he sees you
[1:25:51] adopted that's enough to make a back
[1:25:54] shout enough to make a Methodist convert
[1:25:57] enough to make a c come and run to the
[1:25:59] altar to know that God is not trying to
[1:26:02] hope you make it he put everything in
[1:26:05] place to make it Hallelujah you didn't
[1:26:07] even find the message the message found
[1:26:09] you he said the message would find
[1:26:11] itself in the hands of the
[1:26:14] predestinated you couldn't miss this
[1:26:16] church if you wanted to you couldn't
[1:26:18] miss the prophet if you wanted
[1:26:23] to H hallelujah hallelujah you may be
[1:26:27] seated am remember the mark God chose
[1:26:30] your family God chose your country God
[1:26:33] chose your village God chose the school
[1:26:35] you go to he chose a university he chose
[1:26:38] who to send to University and who he
[1:26:40] couldn't handle in University all of it
[1:26:42] coming together to ensure that you find
[1:26:44] yourself in where you're supposed to be
[1:26:46] to be able to be a reflection of his
[1:26:48] goodness that's why we ought to be so
[1:26:50] thankful this morning because he's a way
[1:26:52] maker and the way he made for you is
[1:26:55] different than the way he made for me
[1:26:56] but he is a way
[1:27:01] maker can the church say
[1:27:07] amen I want you to think about in
[1:27:09] friends God is not a risk taker if you
[1:27:12] give you a son he give you a daughter he
[1:27:14] give you a family there's no risk
[1:27:16] there he will put things in place to
[1:27:19] deliver Hallelujah the children of
[1:27:21] Israel were there in bondage in Egypt
[1:27:23] and they were they were not at risk
[1:27:25] there was oppression there was a
[1:27:27] Taskmaster but it were not at risk it
[1:27:29] was just a matter of time until the word
[1:27:31] of God came to the right season and when
[1:27:34] the word formed the right season then
[1:27:36] they were there was a right man who was
[1:27:38] born on Moses he was started as a baby
[1:27:40] and that baby was not at risk in fact
[1:27:42] God made sure but a punch that he had
[1:27:44] the best food in
[1:27:45] Egypt talk about God not taking risk
[1:27:48] make sure that the best trainers in
[1:27:50] Egypt could train Moses because he want
[1:27:52] to make sure Moses could handle
[1:27:53] everything can the church say Amen oh be
[1:27:56] thankful this morning lift your head up
[1:27:59] there's more for you than against you
[1:28:01] there's more blessing over you than you
[1:28:03] realize count your blessings name them
[1:28:05] one by
[1:28:15] one so this morning we are under
[1:28:19] expectation for a seventh under the
[1:28:21] Revival we are under expectation not for
[1:28:23] a pente costal Revival we are under
[1:28:26] expectation for a bride's Revival this
[1:28:28] is just for the bride not just for
[1:28:30] message Believers not just and listen I
[1:28:32] want to make a distinction
[1:28:36] here the Bible says that the devil
[1:28:41] believes so if an an
[1:28:46] trembles there were a lot of preachers
[1:28:48] here this
[1:28:50] morning devil believes answerable but
[1:28:52] the say he frightened
[1:28:54] but the distinction I want to make here
[1:28:56] is if it was just down to
[1:28:59] belief then the devil make
[1:29:03] it so this is so there's a separation
[1:29:06] between just having a belief or
[1:29:07] believing because the devil believes
[1:29:09] that more than some message
[1:29:12] Believers he has had enough experience
[1:29:14] to believe he know it by experience that
[1:29:18] when God say you going to do something
[1:29:19] you going to do
[1:29:21] something some of us still have to come
[1:29:23] to that understanding that what God said
[1:29:26] he's going to do he's going to do but
[1:29:27] the devil has seen it time and time
[1:29:29] again so the devil believes and trembles
[1:29:31] because he know God is a god of his
[1:29:36] word so if it's just belief then the
[1:29:39] devil will be qualified but there are
[1:29:41] some things the devil cannot
[1:29:44] access but the brandom said that the
[1:29:46] devil cannot get under the
[1:29:48] blood because if he can get under the
[1:29:50] blood he'll be your brother so the blood
[1:29:52] is exclusive for a group of people who
[1:29:55] could access under
[1:29:57] there anybody with me this morning and
[1:30:00] there's something else that's powerful
[1:30:02] that's the key to unlocking your
[1:30:04] blessing that the devil cannot
[1:30:07] do the devil cannot
[1:30:13] worship so if you really want to
[1:30:15] separate yourself from just the regular
[1:30:18] Believers you just have to worship
[1:30:21] because the devil resists he can't
[1:30:23] worship Hall you don't hear me this
[1:30:25] morning that's what he fought for he
[1:30:27] wanted worship it's not in him to
[1:30:29] worship so you begin to break out of his
[1:30:32] gra you say thank you Jesus thank you
[1:30:35] Lord Jesus Hallelujah blessing and honor
[1:30:38] might and power you are doing what the
[1:30:41] devil can never
[1:30:43] do and when the Praises go up the glory
[1:30:47] comes down can the Church Say Amen
[1:30:56] and time and time again we see in
[1:30:58] scripture I'm just encouraging you this
[1:31:00] morning just talking to you a little
[1:31:04] bit sometime it's good just have a
[1:31:06] little conversation around the word but
[1:31:09] the man said when you talk about him he
[1:31:10] draws near he loves for us to talk about
[1:31:12] him you know Hallelujah people spend
[1:31:15] time with Teran talking about politics
[1:31:17] and this and that and it has its place
[1:31:19] modern events made clear by prophecy we
[1:31:21] can spend time there too but there's
[1:31:22] nothing like talking about
[1:31:24] Jesus he's the center of my joy he's the
[1:31:28] center of my peace he's my way maker my
[1:31:30] provider when you can't talk to nobody
[1:31:32] else he can talk to him and he's always
[1:31:34] available to talk to you you don't ever
[1:31:37] get a busy tone when you call him he is
[1:31:40] always available all the time you can
[1:31:42] call him at 9:00 a.m. you can call him
[1:31:43] at 9:00 p.m. you call him at 1:00 p.m.
[1:31:45] or 1:00 a.m. 5:00 a.m. or 5: p.m. Jesus
[1:31:49] is on the main line he don't have a
[1:31:51] hotline with angels responding he
[1:31:53] himself is on Main Line you could tell
[1:31:55] them what you want this morning oh I
[1:31:57] feel religious this morning oh I feel
[1:31:59] religious I feel like the old fashion
[1:32:02] sin killing sky blue kind of Holy Ghost
[1:32:05] Revival
[1:32:08] service that's what young people need in
[1:32:10] know it's good to have programs and
[1:32:12] these things but give them an experience
[1:32:14] with the old fashioned sin killing sky
[1:32:16] blue Holy Ghost Revival but it's a
[1:32:18] change of the inside and see your
[1:32:19] appetite begin to change the things that
[1:32:21] used to attract your attention no more
[1:32:22] start to look all
[1:32:24] how that used to attract my attention
[1:32:26] but when your appetite change oh
[1:32:28] my can the church say
[1:32:31] Amen you may be
[1:32:41] seated so we ought to be under
[1:32:44] expectation and expectation puts us into
[1:32:48] a state of
[1:32:49] preparation and preparation is very
[1:32:51] interesting because we at that time of
[1:32:53] the year today December the 15th we were
[1:32:55] around 10 days away from
[1:32:57] Christmas and I always remember precious
[1:32:59] brother John
[1:33:01] Phillip one Christmas you say I'm not
[1:33:04] painting I'm not
[1:33:06] painting I'm not painting catch they I'm
[1:33:09] not
[1:33:09] painting not this year they're not
[1:33:11] taking my money this year not painting
[1:33:14] where was Christmas
[1:33:17] Eve when he spirited him
[1:33:20] so he went and by paid he paid all night
[1:33:22] long
[1:33:27] because there's a pressure to be
[1:33:29] prepared and you have to be not just
[1:33:31] aware of preparation but there's a
[1:33:33] spirit that comes with
[1:33:35] preparation you know and and if and and
[1:33:37] and and this is the challenge of it
[1:33:39] people really not in the spirit of the
[1:33:41] coming of your
[1:33:42] Lord because when you're in the spirit
[1:33:45] of the coming of your lord it puts you
[1:33:46] in a state to have to make preparations
[1:33:48] to leave
[1:33:49] here brother mam taught us plan as he
[1:33:52] coming in 20 years but live if you com
[1:33:54] in tomorrow because they put you in a
[1:33:55] state of Readiness am I ready to go
[1:33:59] spiritually
[1:34:01] ready some of us we have so much plans
[1:34:03] and things we let this distort us and we
[1:34:05] we're not sensitive to the fact that
[1:34:06] time is really
[1:34:07] short we out of time in them can the
[1:34:10] church say Amen but before we leave here
[1:34:13] there has to be a Revival there has to
[1:34:15] be an outpouring there has to be a
[1:34:16] Deliverance I cannot believe that so
[1:34:19] many who have passed through not just
[1:34:20] this church but this message who Fall
[1:34:22] Away God is going to leave them there we
[1:34:25] have to be the ones who stand in the Gap
[1:34:27] to get into position to speak for them
[1:34:30] to pray for them to car for them he said
[1:34:33] unto you and to your children and as
[1:34:34] many as are far off many as the Lord God
[1:34:37] shall call there are many who are
[1:34:39] walking around predestinated and they
[1:34:41] don't know it or predestinated and
[1:34:43] forgotten it who are they waiting on not
[1:34:45] God they waiting on you and I to dig a
[1:34:47] valy full of ditches to make preparation
[1:34:49] for the blessing to make room for the
[1:34:51] Deliverance can the Church Say Amen
[1:34:55] oh
[1:34:56] Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory making
[1:34:59] preparations for seven T the Revival
[1:35:03] digging a valley full of ditches
[1:35:05] restoring Your Divine connection
[1:35:07] restoring your prayer
[1:35:08] closet restoring an atmosphere around
[1:35:11] you that the devil can't break past can
[1:35:13] the church say Amen oh in the message
[1:35:16] expectation talking about Noah he was
[1:35:18] expecting it to rain so he made
[1:35:20] preparations for the rain oh I like that
[1:35:22] the prophet said oh make preparation as
[1:35:24] long as you hear God's word then make
[1:35:27] preparations for it to happen and wait
[1:35:28] under expectation oh that makes me start
[1:35:31] feeling religious to begin with to think
[1:35:33] that God said so and be expecting it so
[1:35:36] I want to encourage you this morning
[1:35:38] don't just be expecting the new year and
[1:35:40] expecting the season and all that but
[1:35:42] let's be under expectation for a holy
[1:35:44] ghost Revival let's be under expectation
[1:35:47] for an UNP pouring of the spirit in the
[1:35:49] message that same message but everybody
[1:35:50] said now if God has promised a Revival
[1:35:53] here we're going to have it let's make
[1:35:56] ready for it if God promised to heal
[1:35:59] let's make ready for it if Jesus said

[1:37:32] ditches but abam said and the only way
[1:37:35] you ever going to see your way

[1:37:46] Revival HS the place then you begin to
[1:37:48] see things then God will begin to reveal

[1:40:39] going to be delivered by Stripes I'm
[1:40:41] Healed by Stripes I'm Healed nothing
[1:40:43] going to change that can the church say
[1:40:48] Amen oh
[1:40:49] hallelujah hallelujah but said Revival
[1:40:53] does five things you remember these five
[1:40:56] things he said it brings souls to Christ
[1:40:58] that's the Great Commission Hallelujah
[1:41:00] you have to have a burden to see your
[1:41:02] loved ones your family your co-workers
[1:41:04] come to Christ it can't be business as
[1:41:06] usual you looking for God to do
[1:41:08] something judgment is over the Earth if
[1:41:10] you are true son true daughter there's a
[1:41:12] burden in Your Heart Lord may they see
[1:41:14] the truth may they come to know you may
[1:41:16] they come to Know You by Revelation and
[1:41:18] experience but a Revival puts a burden
[1:41:21] in you to bring souls to Christ
[1:41:26] when laugh has has you have you told
[1:41:28] somebody about the
[1:41:31] Lord say testify you know what brother
[1:41:34] said if you don't testify when they find
[1:41:37] back that's the rec when you don't
[1:41:42] testify andless is not you in your house
[1:41:44] talking to those in your house that's
[1:41:45] fine but if it it can't be a
[1:41:48] secret and I tell you go and rain down
[1:41:51] fire and brimstone in your office you
[1:41:52] know
[1:41:55] but
[1:41:57] testify God is good do you know the
[1:42:02] Lord have you met the Lord you you see
[1:42:05] me why I'm happy and and listen BR Punch
[1:42:07] If you can't be happy you can't attract
[1:42:09] nobody
[1:42:12] you if you are looking like something
[1:42:14] going on
[1:42:16] good they say in sales if you are
[1:42:19] believe in your product you can't sell
[1:42:22] your product them
[1:42:24] well I have a kind of watch here it's a
[1:42:27] kind of I don't already have one myself
[1:42:29] but you all buy it would you would you
[1:42:32] buy
[1:42:35] that that's I say when you want to go
[1:42:37] and eat good food go to a restaurant
[1:42:39] when you see the chef eating his own
[1:42:43] food this is this is serious
[1:42:49] thing one time I went to a restaurant I
[1:42:51] saw the chef come on and take a plate I
[1:42:52] say I want whoever he
[1:42:56] eaten because if the chef who cook the
[1:42:58] food sit don't eating that give me that
[1:43:02] because he beli in his own
[1:43:05] product can you CH say Amen so you have
[1:43:08] to believe in your product you have to
[1:43:10] believe that God is a good god you have
[1:43:12] to believe that God Is A Healer and your
[1:43:14] testimony and your experience to become
[1:43:16] so positive that especially when you're
[1:43:18] down that's the best time to sell
[1:43:21] it because but that is the time when
[1:43:24] people will believe you the most because
[1:43:26] when things looking good and everything
[1:43:28] is fine then is it's a normal thing but
[1:43:30] it's when you go against the O and
[1:43:32] you're swimming upstream and they you
[1:43:33] come to work and you know something
[1:43:35] happen and they say but how you so happy
[1:43:37] that is when they could
[1:43:39] testify can the church say Amen when you
[1:43:42] feel like giving up that's when you
[1:43:43] testify and you'll find that when you
[1:43:45] testify in those low moments you get
[1:43:49] encouraged you remember the time bov was
[1:43:52] testifying how somebody came to him and
[1:43:53] tell him they want to backslide he said
[1:43:55] by time he say how you could do that and
[1:43:57] by time and he himself was going through
[1:43:58] his own experience by time he done he he
[1:44:01] preach himself you
[1:44:03] know but that's the problem with many of
[1:44:06] us I was sharing with somebody recently
[1:44:08] in I remember in a Rema church for those
[1:44:09] who were when we were in AR Rema what it
[1:44:11] was you say a lot throw the acts
[1:44:15] first so when you get to your job your
[1:44:17] school let them know I'm a Christian
[1:44:19] don't hide it but when you declare it
[1:44:22] and say I'm a Christian I'm believer
[1:44:24] they actually help you live it because
[1:44:26] they'll say but I thought you say you're
[1:44:27] a
[1:44:28] Christian I thought you were say a man
[1:44:30] of f i remember in school doing that and
[1:44:32] people saying Isaac move from here you
[1:44:33] can't hear
[1:44:35] this they they say this is not for you
[1:44:38] because you say you're a
[1:44:40] Christian and it creates an environment
[1:44:42] around you it creates something around
[1:44:44] you that it kep it keeps you on track
[1:44:47] because you want to make it you don't
[1:44:48] want to come all these years and he make
[1:44:50] it you know what is to come to church
[1:44:52] all these years and not and not make
[1:44:56] it so whatever you got to do to put in
[1:44:59] place to make sure you make it you do
[1:45:00] that so I want to encourage you as we
[1:45:03] wind down 2024 and look to 2025 you have
[1:45:07] to practice the Bible say he who winth a
[1:45:09] soul is
[1:45:13] wise what is your testimony of sharing
[1:45:17] this gospel with
[1:45:19] people now we bringing it
[1:45:21] personal what is your testimony of
[1:45:24] telling someone around the Lord about
[1:45:26] the
[1:45:27] Lord because if you try once and twice
[1:45:29] and it didn't happen you just going to
[1:45:31] give
[1:45:32] up so I want to encourage you as you
[1:45:34] approach this new season all this is
[1:45:37] part of your training because you have
[1:45:39] to be able to have a testimony and there
[1:45:41] are some people because of how they live
[1:45:43] in school in the neighborhood on the
[1:45:44] street they can't even
[1:45:47] testify if your neighbor cannot accept
[1:45:50] an invitation to come to church you have
[1:45:51] to check yourself
[1:45:54] we talking this morning but Brother Andy
[1:45:57] preaching part if you're coworker you
[1:46:00] can't invite them to
[1:46:02] church because of how you living on the
[1:46:05] job you have to check yourself in
[1:46:08] because your life supposed to be such a
[1:46:09] bul that when you invite them they they
[1:46:12] I can't wait to
[1:46:13] come because seeing something about your
[1:46:15] life that is attractive to me that I
[1:46:17] want to come to wherever you're going I
[1:46:18] want to hear what you're feeding on
[1:46:20] because I can't believe you could be so
[1:46:22] different from the rest of us but many
[1:46:25] of us we hideing we don't want anybody
[1:46:26] to know we a Christian you're in the
[1:46:28] lunchroom and you're there you do the
[1:46:30] fastest prayer for your
[1:46:32] lunch maybe this is not everybody but
[1:46:35] but a cple maybe one person inside
[1:46:38] here people they want to pray for their
[1:46:41] lunch in the lunch room and say Lord
[1:46:43] bless
[1:46:44] it you don't want anybody to know
[1:46:49] that and the Bible say my people shall
[1:46:51] never be ashamed
[1:46:54] young people I want you to take note of
[1:46:55] this know because it's the key to God
[1:46:58] blessing you you not being ashamed of
[1:47:01] this gospel so Revival is to do five
[1:47:03] things bring souls to Christ bring the
[1:47:05] church back to the spiritual condition
[1:47:07] it should be in like the alpha Church
[1:47:09] bring close communion with God not close
[1:47:12] communion with movies not close
[1:47:14] communion with your friends not no but
[1:47:15] close communion with God it brings
[1:47:17] Fellowship among the churches and it
[1:47:19] brings an atmosphere to pray for these
[1:47:20] sicks pray for the sick that's what we
[1:47:23] need tonight is a good oldfashioned
[1:47:25] backward sin killing sky blue religion
[1:47:28] bleach under the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:30] that's still in the message making a
[1:47:31] valley full of ditches familiar quote
[1:47:34] the third seal now that's what's the
[1:47:36] reason today the Revival that we are
[1:47:38] supposed to have we have denominational
[1:47:40] revivals we haven't had a real stirring

[1:51:42] praise before Give the Lord a oh come on
[1:51:48] now
[1:51:50] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:51:53] Hallelujah I mentioned it yesterday that
[1:51:56] woman whose daughter was vexed with the
[1:51:58] Devil the Canaanite woman she came to
[1:52:01] Jesus it was not that she didn't ever
[1:52:03] need she came with a real situation she
[1:52:05] called Jesus she explained her situation
[1:52:08] and God didn't pay her no attention
[1:52:10] hallelujah hallelujah because there's
[1:52:12] two things God looking for and she
[1:52:14] didn't show those two things yet God
[1:52:16] can't respond unless it he sees those
[1:52:18] two
[1:52:20] things Hallelujah and Jesus is walking
[1:52:23] this morning Hallelujah he's looking for
[1:52:25] those two things if anybody presents
[1:52:27] those two things something is going to
[1:52:29] happen you don't hear me this morning
[1:52:32] two things he's looking for Hallelujah
[1:52:34] and once those two things are present
[1:52:36] he's got to do
[1:52:40] something Hallelujah and that woman she
[1:52:43] had
[1:52:45] desperation she had stick tutiven you
[1:52:48] ever found that word in the dictionary
[1:52:50] stick to ATIV didn't come to give up she
[1:52:54] say I'm not going back home so when
[1:52:56] Jesus didn't pay attention to her she
[1:52:57] went to the disciples and she say
[1:52:59] brother brother Peter brother Peter
[1:53:01] brother Peter until Peter said Jesus
[1:53:03] just deal
[1:53:04] this because Peter wasn't converted yet
[1:53:07] Peter was running out of patience he
[1:53:08] said I handle his pressure Jesus said my
[1:53:11] food my purpose my desire being here is
[1:53:14] for the house of
[1:53:15] Israel well who tell him say that oh my
[1:53:18] that woman she heard that and she said
[1:53:20] to worship and when Jesus told that
[1:53:22] worship it caught his attention
[1:53:25] condition one was met because once you
[1:53:27] worship God he's now on speaking terms
[1:53:29] with
[1:53:31] you
[1:53:32] Hallelujah condition two was not met yet
[1:53:36] but when Jesus see now how bad you
[1:53:38] really want
[1:53:40] this how bad you really want it because
[1:53:43] there are some people here this morning
[1:53:44] they don't want to change you
[1:53:47] know brother Andy there are people who
[1:53:49] in church for years with no change they
[1:53:51] already W change change and the moment
[1:53:53] you correct them or straighten them out
[1:53:54] or say something to them they they they
[1:53:56] act
[1:53:59] up so Jesus want to test the spirit
[1:54:01] because he wants to activate the second
[1:54:03] part of the thing the second condition
[1:54:05] he say it's not fit to take the
[1:54:07] children's bread and cast it to
[1:54:09] dogs that's a that's a statement to
[1:54:11] separate to see to the separate from the
[1:54:13] men from the
[1:54:14] boys and what did the sister do she
[1:54:16] opened her phone and went straight to
[1:54:19] Facebook she called the express and say
[1:54:22] you know I went to this
[1:54:25] church and this man tell me I'm a
[1:54:28] dog she make a
[1:54:30] video Hallelujah here I am this is me
[1:54:34] right outside the
[1:54:37] church you can see right there look
[1:54:39] petza
[1:54:42] look a live stream in here I fed
[1:54:48] up but but over preach it she didn't
[1:54:51] look because your pain your problem your
[1:54:54] need has to be bigger than what people
[1:54:56] say to you the Usher I shake my hand the
[1:54:59] Deacon I shake my hand that the wrong
[1:55:01] seat how long I in church I get to GRE
[1:55:03] the pastor did all kind of issues she
[1:55:06] wasn't focused on the issues you know
[1:55:07] she was on her KNE she said but wait a
[1:55:08] minute if I really want this thing what
[1:55:10] the what what what what do the dogs see
[1:55:12] but but even the dogs get crumbs from
[1:55:15] the master table well when she said that
[1:55:17] second condition meant he said woman you
[1:55:19] see that fate you're moving with because
[1:55:22] when you have worship and Faith together
[1:55:24] God has to move oh come on now somebody
[1:55:26] help me this morning when worship meets
[1:55:29] Faith or When Faith meets worship oh
[1:55:31] come on
[1:55:32] now you could get healing today you
[1:55:36] listen not just get you could take it
[1:55:38] you could take your healing it on the
[1:55:40] shelf and you can pick it up and walk
[1:55:42] out with it you don't need to ask
[1:55:44] permission to be healed you could take
[1:55:45] up healing and it's like a grocery
[1:55:48] whatever you put in the C you can walk
[1:55:49] out this grocery because it already paid
[1:55:52] for
[1:55:52] it don't need no credit card it don't
[1:55:54] need no bank statement whatever you put
[1:55:56] in there you can walk out with it this
[1:55:58] morning can the church say
[1:56:10] amenl and you can only worship if you
[1:56:12] know God if you understand who God is
[1:56:15] his nature his being his attributes
[1:56:17] because only then you can not worship in
[1:56:18] spirit and in truth you see it all ties
[1:56:21] together but if you don't have faith
[1:56:22] because people are worshiping without
[1:56:28] faith and faith is the currency is the
[1:56:31] only currency you know it's not talk

[1:58:06] answer that you
[1:58:10] know so I know to practice even if you
[1:58:14] thought come I don't want to verbalize
[1:58:15] it
[1:58:17] but but I feeling
[1:58:21] so he I want to finish that
[1:58:26] statement and when you set up because
[1:58:28] your body listen to your words your
[1:58:30] thoughts is one thing your thoughts are
[1:58:32] powerful but you see when you put it
[1:58:34] into words it brings a reality to it
[1:58:36] because spoken word is the attribute of
[1:58:39] creation you know is the spoken word
[1:58:41] everything is here by the word Let There
[1:58:43] Be Let There Be So when you say and
[1:58:45] verbalize certain things all of a sudden
[1:58:47] things that line up a certain way that's
[1:58:49] why the Bible say let the weak say it
[1:58:51] they saying you're not weak but say
[1:58:52] you're strong because you create your
[1:58:56] world and I've preached it before that
[1:58:58] in the natural they have positive
[1:59:01] affirmations that's tapping into a
[1:59:03] spiritual principle today is going to be
[1:59:05] a great day and what what kind of thing
[1:59:08] they have said before you leave your
[1:59:09] house I'm I'm positive I am happy I am
[1:59:12] satisfied I'm happy and I'm like that's
[1:59:14] a Biblical principle and people in
[1:59:16] natural walking in that I'm happy it's a
[1:59:18] nice day it's going to be a great day
[1:59:20] I'm going to sell I'm going to be and
[1:59:22] and they're living in that
[1:59:24] environment and Believers have all the
[1:59:26] books have all the tapes by tired but if
[1:59:28] you know the enemy just beating me up
[1:59:30] beating me
[1:59:33] up remember years ago I met a brother I
[1:59:35] was young and at the time it troubled me
[1:59:37] he see the devil just coughing me and
[1:59:39] kicking me and I looking up at him like
[1:59:42] I was
[1:59:44] shocked but by verbalizing these things
[1:59:48] you digging a deeper hole you're diing
[1:59:49] no deeper ditch we talking about you
[1:59:51] just dig yourself in a
[1:59:53] hole but you have to speak positive so I
[1:59:55] want to encourage you as you end this
[1:59:57] year and going into New Year speak
[1:59:59] positive and watch situation in your
[2:00:01] life change watch your environment
[2:00:04] change watch your circumstance change
[2:00:06] cut out the negative just speak positive
[2:00:08] and brother BR I think ready but where
[2:00:11] somebody asked the prophet if he was
[2:00:12] lying he said no it was my
[2:00:14] confession you can't tell me about my
[2:00:17] confession can the church say Amen
[2:00:20] blessed be the name of the Lord you you
[2:00:22] love the Lord this morning could you
[2:00:24] take some
[2:00:29] more I just having a conversation with
[2:00:32] the
[2:00:32] church and I feeling I feeling
[2:00:36] strong but I'm not feeling
[2:00:41] tired and today is the Lord's day so we
[2:00:44] here to just enjoy the presence of the
[2:00:45] Lord and spend time reset and reboot
[2:00:52] you know when somebody is under the
[2:00:53] influence of drugs they have to put them
[2:00:55] in a place of
[2:00:57] detox cut away certain things so that
[2:01:00] they could reset and recalibrate they
[2:01:01] take them away from the environments
[2:01:03] that might enable them and they put them
[2:01:04] somewhere separate so they could spend
[2:01:06] some time away from certain
[2:01:09] things and when it come to church is
[2:01:11] ready at time to detox because the
[2:01:13] reality is friends is a small portion of
[2:01:15] your time per week you spend in church
[2:01:19] in you spend a set of hours in work you
[2:01:22] hours walk and the few hours you have in
[2:01:25] church people want to know well how long
[2:01:28] how long again how
[2:01:36] long say the message of the hour keep
[2:01:38] you service with an
[2:01:44] hour but when it come to the house of
[2:01:46] the Lord you want something to be said
[2:01:48] to touch your heart to encourage you to
[2:01:52] help you see that there's ways to
[2:01:53] improve to
[2:01:57] change if you are the same person now as
[2:02:01] you were at the beginning of this year
[2:02:03] you have two weeks to
[2:02:06] change could I say that one more time
[2:02:09] you have people who happy to say I'm the
[2:02:11] same person nobody could change me where
[2:02:13] you see is where you
[2:02:16] get my mother make me so all kind of
[2:02:18] people that not for the messenger
[2:02:22] that is not bright talk because we want
[2:02:24] to be changed from glory to glory to
[2:02:25] glory we want to be shaped and horned to
[2:02:29] be a reflection of the image not of the
[2:02:31] church or of the pastor but of God you
[2:02:33] when when people see you they see but
[2:02:35] that is the Life of Christ that is the
[2:02:37] virtue of Christ the Faith of Christ the
[2:02:39] knowledge of Christ The Temperance of
[2:02:41] Christ the patience godliness the
[2:02:42] brotherly kindness the
[2:02:45] forgiveness and as brother said
[2:02:47] yesterday after sister Karen gave a
[2:02:49] testimony that the character form in
[2:02:52] part of this thing is not through the
[2:02:54] good times because we always opt in for
[2:02:57] the good time but is the is the tough
[2:02:59] moments is what a shape the
[2:03:02] character and the thing about it is
[2:03:04] brother Mikey nobody chooses the the the
[2:03:08] trial you know if you give somebody a
[2:03:10] sheet and say but Joo um pick the trial
[2:03:12] you
[2:03:15] want people will default to the easiest
[2:03:17] one I remember years ago there was a
[2:03:20] publication where a man say well Lord I
[2:03:23] want to pick a a a smaller cross to bear
[2:03:26] I don't ever saw that and say well go in
[2:03:29] the room and choose one and when he look
[2:03:32] around the room you see look what the
[2:03:33] smallest
[2:03:35] cross when he pick it up he say that
[2:03:37] same one you coming here
[2:03:42] wa I give you what you could handle you
[2:03:44] think you watch all the big
[2:03:47] CR taking the smallest one you said that
[2:03:49] the one they coming
[2:03:50] with because I giving you more than you
[2:03:53] could
[2:03:54] bear and he promised in he word to never
[2:03:56] give you more than you could
[2:03:57] bear it requires us to reframe our
[2:04:02] perspective that's the biggest thing you
[2:04:04] know when you could reframe your
[2:04:07] perspective you look at your home
[2:04:09] different you look at your life
[2:04:11] different you look at your situation
[2:04:14] different there was a study done of some
[2:04:16] of the most successful people on the
[2:04:18] Earth and they said the one common thing
[2:04:20] they found was in the midst of
[2:04:22] situations these people all believed
[2:04:25] there was a way they could get out of
[2:04:27] it it was not even about financial
[2:04:29] thinking it was nothing it was just the
[2:04:31] belief that there's a way out of the
[2:04:33] situation and if you look at your life
[2:04:36] your home your marriage your business
[2:04:38] there's a way out of this and we know
[2:04:40] the way God is the way if you have that
[2:04:43] brute Faith to say I don't care how
[2:04:45] Bleak it looks it's going to work out
[2:04:47] your whole outlook begins to change can
[2:04:50] I say that again
[2:04:52] you're not wondering oh gosh if it going
[2:04:54] to work out no it's going to work out
[2:04:56] the how is not even up to you God will
[2:04:58] give you the how you just have to
[2:05:00] believe my situation will
[2:05:05] change and when you said to walk like
[2:05:08] that you start to see Things fall into
[2:05:09] place and you never know how it go fall
[2:05:11] into
[2:05:12] place it is not up to you to figure out
[2:05:14] you how that's what God
[2:05:16] is he said cast your cares bring your
[2:05:19] thing to the altar cast all your burdens
[2:05:22] unto Jesus I said people come there cast
[2:05:24] their burden and then when God touch it
[2:05:26] fast enough they going and take it back
[2:05:27] up and carry it with
[2:05:30] them you bring your burd you leave it
[2:05:32] there you walk with faith you could fix
[2:05:35] your children give them to the Lord say
[2:05:37] Lord I give them to you you're not going
[2:05:40] to love any less you're not going to do
[2:05:42] any less but Lord is your problem to fix
[2:05:44] now you know because I can't fix it but
[2:05:47] I know you can so I'm trusting you to
[2:05:50] fix it put your right right words put me
[2:05:52] in right situation let them but I giving
[2:05:54] it to you to fix it because once the
[2:05:56] part the age of accountability now it's
[2:05:59] yours can the church say
[2:06:01] Amen so we're looking for our personal
[2:06:04] Revival where nobody have to crank us up
[2:06:07] you know when your car G in trouble you
[2:06:08] have to get a
[2:06:10] Kickstart some to bring a battery and
[2:06:12] they put it on the thing and thing and
[2:06:14] and Kickstart your vehicle some people
[2:06:15] every Sunday have to Kickstart
[2:06:20] them but when break into your own
[2:06:22] personal Revival you don't you don't
[2:06:23] need a kickart you started normal normal
[2:06:26] all the time on a Monday you're starting
[2:06:28] on a Tuesday you're starting on a
[2:06:29] Wednesday you're starting you can't
[2:06:30] leave your house without talking to God
[2:06:32] you can't leave your you can't enter a
[2:06:34] room without acknowledging him you say
[2:06:35] acknowledge Him in all your ways and he
[2:06:37] will direct your part it becomes a part
[2:06:39] of your DNA it becomes a part of your
[2:06:44] operation could you take some more we
[2:06:47] just have a few more services this year
[2:06:48] you know so we we want to get as much
[2:06:50] out of it the I'm not going to be too
[2:06:52] long with you from the message influence
[2:06:54] what we have seen happen should put
[2:06:55] every soul into action it should make a
[2:06:57] church that would make a Revival here in
[2:06:59] Phoenix and we see here in Trinidad that
[2:07:01] people would fly in from Europe to see
[2:07:02] what taking place they'd say there's a
[2:07:04] place in Arizona called the Maricopa
[2:07:05] Valley a city called Phoenix there's
[2:07:07] something broke out here until the seven
[2:07:10] tunders of Revelation 10 that's not even
[2:07:12] written in the Bible is being manifested
[2:07:14] Hallelujah it is the rising of the sun
[2:07:16] there's been churches churches bries
[2:07:17] Brides churches Brides brides but there
[2:07:19] has got to come one Hallelujah there has
[2:07:22] to come a real bride there must come one
[2:07:24] that's not only got the mechanics but
[2:07:26] the Dynamics of it makes the church live
[2:07:29] move in the power of his
[2:07:31] resurrection Hallelujah in the fourth
[2:07:33] seal page 304 God's word sharp two-edged
[2:07:37] sword slays him puts him right down
[2:07:39] under wait till them seven Thunders
[2:07:41] utter their voices to that group who can
[2:07:43] really take the word of God and hand it
[2:07:46] there there's two sides take the word of
[2:07:48] God and put it into action hand it there
[2:07:50] it'll slide and cut and they can close
[2:07:53] the heavens they can shut this or do
[2:07:55] that whatever they want to glory to God
[2:07:57] can the church say Amen you believe
[2:08:00] these promises you are expectation for
[2:08:03] God to use you as a vessel of Honor in
[2:08:06] this season and on in this
[2:08:08] [Music]
[2:08:10] time
[2:08:12] Hallelujah let's go a revivalist to
[2:08:14] revive the seeds as planted in you so
[2:08:16] seeds had to be planted that's why all
[2:08:19] these services and these meetings we
[2:08:20] have is to make sure seed is there
[2:08:22] because when the Revival come which is
[2:08:23] the rain comes it has it could only
[2:08:25] bring up the seed in you if the seed in
[2:08:27] you is foolishness it'll bring up
[2:08:28] foolishness but if the seed in you is
[2:08:30] the word itself it'll bring forth the
[2:08:32] life itself Hallelujah and the devil
[2:08:34] knows this so his only move has been to
[2:08:37] plan seeds of
[2:08:39] error Hallelujah seeds of Discord a seed
[2:08:42] of discrepancy seeds that can't bring
[2:08:44] forth the Life of Christ but the bride
[2:08:46] cannot be deceived Hallelujah I believe
[2:08:49] that we are sitting on a Ministry of
[2:08:51] prophetic Ministry a Ministry in this
[2:08:53] church where the right seeds are planted
[2:08:55] a seed that points to Perfection a seed
[2:08:57] that point to adoption a seed that says
[2:09:00] listen don't be comfortable there's more
[2:09:01] land to be taken there's more room at
[2:09:03] the cross there's more you have to do
[2:09:06] and the church sayen so God had to wait
[2:09:09] all these years and here we are at the
[2:09:11] end of
[2:09:12] 2024 I remember being in secondary
[2:09:15] school around the time of white and all
[2:09:17] these say I don't even think we'll make
[2:09:19] it past the year 2000
[2:09:22] BR punch it's 2025 me here I said to
[2:09:25] somebody they used to say well there'll
[2:09:27] be some young ones to sweep it on to the
[2:09:29] coming of the Lord but T ter saying soon
[2:09:32] might be even able to say I'm
[2:09:35] that there's some younger ones coming to
[2:09:37] look at them younger ones now to Super
[2:09:39] because we getting older but there's a
[2:09:41] promise over us and God is operating a
[2:09:43] way that will make every man's word a
[2:09:45] lie and only his word stand up true
[2:09:47] people say all kind of stuff but God's
[2:09:49] word is the truth he he knows who
[2:09:52] exactly he wants in the Rapture he knows
[2:09:54] exactly who have to go that the the the
[2:09:57] when the bride comes into the Perfection
[2:09:58] they can bring on the resurrection
[2:10:00] listen nobody want to volunteer to be
[2:10:02] part of the Resurrection part had to
[2:10:03] come up
[2:10:07] in give somebody the choice they say no
[2:10:09] no no I want to be here you Rapture and
[2:10:11] God say well we need somebody to raise
[2:10:13] him so some SE had to go into the ground
[2:10:16] nobody want to be sick but everybody
[2:10:17] want go to be a
[2:10:19] Healer any volunteers nobody want to
[2:10:21] volunteer to be sick nobody want to
[2:10:23] volunteer to be dead to be part of the
[2:10:25] Resurrection but God had to choose in
[2:10:27] his Sovereign Grace how this whole plan
[2:10:29] unfolds but rest assured if God call for
[2:10:32] the Rapture there's no devil in hell
[2:10:33] going to stop you if God said you're
[2:10:35] going to be healed there's no devil in
[2:10:36] hell going to stop you if he said your
[2:10:38] family going to be delivered the Devil
[2:10:40] Himself cannot stop it can the church
[2:10:42] say Amen you can leave this service
[2:10:44] today shout him in joy and praise and
[2:10:46] worship knowing that he who started the
[2:10:48] work in you is more than able to
[2:10:50] complete it and if it started last year
[2:10:53] or 40 years ago he is still the same
[2:10:55] yesterday today and forever and he is
[2:10:57] still a way making God he's still a god
[2:11:00] of his word he is still a god of his
[2:11:09] promises Hallelujah so God have to wait
[2:11:12] all these years many people came into
[2:11:13] the message and they shouted and they
[2:11:16] jumped and they believed and they had
[2:11:17] quotes and they had testimonies and some
[2:11:19] of them they can't even see them
[2:11:22] in condemnation my representation but
[2:11:23] the B said no wonder God can't send a
[2:11:25] Revival he's got nothing to build it on
[2:11:27] then he take individuals because the the
[2:11:30] the thought was is a church is that
[2:11:32] church Ral there the angel is there this
[2:11:34] power is there but brother Bram saying
[2:11:36] here he's got nothing to build it on
[2:11:39] he'll take individuals and build it on
[2:11:41] them individuals and declare them not
[2:11:44] churches before the world who stay with
[2:11:46] that
[2:11:47] word Lord let me be one of those
[2:11:49] individuals who stay with the word
[2:11:51] that's what I want can I stay with the
[2:11:54] word can I live in this word can I be in
[2:11:55] the presence of God in this word so
[2:11:57] situations have to come to see if there
[2:12:00] would be individuals who would stay with
[2:12:03] the
[2:12:04] word
[2:12:06] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if you
[2:12:09] are not making plans with a Rapture what
[2:12:11] are you making plans
[2:12:15] for
[2:12:18] Hallelujah and I have it here in the
[2:12:20] notes but but Terence I say you need to
[2:12:22] have a plan to survive the tribulation
[2:12:23] please have
[2:12:24] it if you're not making preparation for
[2:12:27] the Rapture you have to have a
[2:12:28] tribulation survival
[2:12:30] plan but I can't believe God bring me to
[2:12:33] this message to be thinking about the
[2:12:35] tribulation we got to be prepared to do
[2:12:37] whatever it takes as for me and my house
[2:12:41] we will serve the Lord I'm prepared to
[2:12:43] pray to fast to seek to burn to clean to
[2:12:46] do whatever it takes because I want to
[2:12:47] make it in this process there will be
[2:12:50] different situation come up but we want
[2:12:52] to make it your children may not be
[2:12:54] happy but you say this is this house is
[2:12:55] a house of prayer this house is a house
[2:12:57] of God you want to do foolishness you
[2:12:59] could go somewhere else but this house
[2:13:01] we want to welcome the Holy Ghost in
[2:13:02] This House certain things have to happen
[2:13:04] certain things can't operate this way
[2:13:06] because this house is with the presence
[2:13:07] of
[2:13:08] God can the church say Amen could you
[2:13:10] take some more you can't have a ball
[2:13:13] game unless you get in the spirit of the
[2:13:14] ball game you've got to get in the
[2:13:16] spirit of it and we can never have a
[2:13:18] Revival in treport or anywhere else
[2:13:20] until the the church gets in the spirit
[2:13:22] of Revival God can come and perform
[2:13:25] Miracles he can show wonders he can
[2:13:27] stretch forth his hand to heal the sick
[2:13:28] and Afflicted the preacher can preach
[2:13:30] the gospel as hard as he can but
[2:13:32] there'll never be a Revival until the
[2:13:34] church gets in the spirit of revival can
[2:13:36] I can I read that code one more
[2:13:39] time that's in making a value full of
[2:13:41] ditches you can't have a ball game
[2:13:43] unless you get in the spirit of the ball
[2:13:45] game we preach this many times you know
[2:13:46] how terrible it is to be in a game and
[2:13:48] nobody
[2:13:50] responding it's a bat it's a goal it's a
[2:13:52] dunk whoever anybody there
[2:13:54] watching the player and all the want to
[2:13:56] play because when he play he shout he
[2:13:58] get
[2:13:59] anointed when they get out that scream
[2:14:01] you you want to do more because you're
[2:14:03] in the spirit of the
[2:14:04] game you get inspired you know people
[2:14:07] with you you know your team supporting
[2:14:09] you score a goal and and you're ready
[2:14:11] for the next one you're ready how we
[2:14:13] doing it you is a short window a time a
[2:14:15] game don't last forever is a 90minut
[2:14:18] game or whatever lat time and you're in
[2:14:19] the spirit you can't have a ball game
[2:14:21] unless you get in the spirit of the ball
[2:14:22] game you've got to get in the spirit of
[2:14:24] it we can never have Revival in stport
[2:14:27] or headstone Tabernacle until the church
[2:14:29] gets in the spirit of Revival he said
[2:14:32] God can come and perform Miracles he can
[2:14:34] show wonders he can stretch forth his
[2:14:36] hand to heal the sick and Afflicted the
[2:14:38] preacher can preach the gospel as hard
[2:14:40] as he can but there'll never be a
[2:14:42] Revival until the church gets in the
[2:14:43] spirit of Revival so come on Church

[2:25:34] Hallelujah you may be seated and you'll
[2:25:37] find out church if God is not in his
[2:25:39] place you'll find yourself in the
[2:25:43] desert a dry
[2:25:47] place can I say that one more time if
[2:25:50] God is not the object of your worship
[2:25:52] you'll find yourself in a dry place
[2:25:55] you'll find yourself wanting and empty
[2:25:57] unsatisfied and discouraged depressed
[2:25:59] and Forsaken and you look to the left
[2:26:01] and to the right and find no peace
[2:26:03] because God is not in his place you can
[2:26:05] make progress spiritually but if God is
[2:26:08] not the complete object of your worship
[2:26:10] you'll find yourself in a
[2:26:13] desert find yourself in a dry
[2:26:16] place without sustenance without water
[2:26:19] you know you can go for a a long time
[2:26:20] without food but water is only a few
[2:26:22] days without water you don't want to
[2:26:24] find yourself in the desert you don't
[2:26:26] want to find yourself cut off from God
[2:26:28] you are part of his family but you're
[2:26:30] cut off from God let me say that one
[2:26:31] more time you could be part of the
[2:26:33] family of God and cut off from God
[2:26:35] because you have lost your focus about
[2:26:37] putting God first may this be the last
[2:26:40] season where you have made that mistake
[2:26:43] of putting something else before him he
[2:26:45] said Thou shalt have no other gods
[2:26:47] before me but the brandom taught us your
[2:26:49] job could be a god
[2:26:50] your family could be your God money
[2:26:52] could be your God how whatever you could
[2:26:55] make anything of
[2:27:00] God the year is around 850
[2:27:03] BC we are living in the time of the
[2:27:05] descendants of the King by this time the
[2:27:08] kingdom had been rent into
[2:27:11] two what King David left was destroyed
[2:27:14] as sing Solomon took over and his son
[2:27:16] after him implemented taxes we have
[2:27:18] taught this many times and the tax was
[2:27:21] seemed to burdensome so there was a
[2:27:22] division in the
[2:27:25] land the children of
[2:27:27] Israel and the kingdom of
[2:27:30] Judah and the Believers from The Tribe
[2:27:32] of Benjamin the Levites had separated
[2:27:35] themselves some with Israel and some
[2:27:37] with
[2:27:38] Judah the Prophet Elijah had already
[2:27:41] been taken up King Ahab and Jezebel was
[2:27:46] already off the scene and in 2 Kings
[2:27:48] 3:16 3 verse one rather now jehoram the
[2:27:52] son of Ahab and we all know how terrible
[2:27:55] Ahab
[2:27:57] was now jehoram the son of Ahab began to
[2:28:00] Reign Over Israel now we know the
[2:28:03] capital of Israel is
[2:28:06] Samaria Reign Over Israel and Samaria
[2:28:08] the 18th
[2:28:11] year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah so the
[2:28:14] divided Kingdom has two kingdoms two
[2:28:18] kings we have jehoram the son of Ahab
[2:28:21] over Israel and we have Jehoshaphat the
[2:28:23] king of Judah and Reign 12
[2:28:27] years and King joham we read in verse
[2:28:30] two he wrote evil in the sight of the
[2:28:32] Lord but not like his father and like
[2:28:35] his mother so not like Ahab and Jezebel
[2:28:39] for he put away the image of ba that his
[2:28:41] father had made so this is the point I
[2:28:43] want to make even though he made
[2:28:46] progress in cleaning up the image of Bal
[2:28:49] God still saying he wrought evil and
[2:28:52] there are many of us we have put away
[2:28:54] some things but we have not put away all
[2:28:57] things you remember when we did the
[2:28:59] study of jeffa just the chapter before
[2:29:02] they rep they call upon the Lord to
[2:29:04] deliver and God said go to the gods you
[2:29:07] serve because he didn't see true
[2:29:09] repentance they say Lord forgive us help
[2:29:11] us save us he say I'm not doing
[2:29:13] it go to the god you servant because I
[2:29:16] keep delivering you and you keep doing
[2:29:17] foolish just go to them gods and then
[2:29:19] they the Bible says they put away the
[2:29:21] strange gods and it's only when he they
[2:29:24] put so in other words the first
[2:29:25] repentance was with strange
[2:29:27] gods they were repenting and they had
[2:29:30] strange Gods what are strange Gods
[2:29:33] strange clothes strange friends strange
[2:29:37] conversations Strange Music strange
[2:29:40] desires because anything taking it time
[2:29:42] is a form of worship are you with
[2:29:46] me what happened with when they lost the
[2:29:50] battle after Jericho he said don't touch
[2:29:52] their stuff and Aon take some
[2:29:55] clothes and a piece of
[2:29:58] gold showing the desire of man for money
[2:30:02] and the things associated with money and
[2:30:04] fashion and clothes and these things I
[2:30:06] say that was an accursed thing and
[2:30:09] because one man took
[2:30:11] it it affect the whole
[2:30:15] Army and what should have been a victory
[2:30:18] became a loss
[2:30:20] and men
[2:30:21] died because of not just Disobedience
[2:30:25] but the lust or desire in aon's heart
[2:30:28] push him to take something that God said
[2:30:30] is
[2:30:32] unclean so I want us to understand
[2:30:34] friends when we are looking for God to
[2:30:36] bless
[2:30:37] us we may be in a desert and not even
[2:30:41] realizing we're in a desert because
[2:30:42] there are cursed things with us because
[2:30:45] we have maintain and brother Anthony
[2:30:48] preached on it a few weeks ago this
[2:30:50] strange things a strange God brings
[2:30:51] strange
[2:30:53] incense so God is looking at it so I
[2:30:56] could imagine jehoram thought he's
[2:30:59] making
[2:31:00] progress because he put away Bal and
[2:31:03] some of us we put away what might be the
[2:31:05] surface level things we put away H going
[2:31:07] and drink and smoke and all these things
[2:31:09] but behind the scene there's still evil
[2:31:11] not and it may not be just music and
[2:31:13] clothes and all these things but even in
[2:31:15] our hearts lust and envy and animosity
[2:31:17] and gossip and hatred so there's the
[2:31:20] external there's also the internal which
[2:31:22] many times is even worse because nobody
[2:31:23] knows it's
[2:31:25] there backbiting and animosity all these
[2:31:28] and and we worship it you remember the
[2:31:29] man the the man who came into the church
[2:31:32] and the and the ministers ran off the
[2:31:34] platform and he came to the prophet and
[2:31:36] his the but BR said he'll fall over his
[2:31:38] feet and when they came the authorities
[2:31:40] asked him what what happened could he
[2:31:42] get help he said that man was worshiping
[2:31:44] the spirit that was upon
[2:31:47] him so the people who worship the god of
[2:31:49] their ideas the god of their imagination
[2:31:51] they are so caught up in their world and
[2:31:54] how they think things should be their
[2:31:55] whole world is wrapped up so here it is
[2:31:58] you have jehoram the Bible said he
[2:31:59] wrought evil in the sight of the Lord
[2:32:01] but not like his father and like his
[2:32:03] mother for he put away the image of B
[2:32:04] fathers and me as great nevertheless he
[2:32:07] cleaved unto the sins of Jobo the son of
[2:32:10] nebat which made Israel to sin he
[2:32:12] departed not there
[2:32:17] from Brother bam speaking on this
[2:32:20] trying to find a place to land he said
[2:32:22] when they went to select them they got
[2:32:23] jerob his son and her son you couldn't
[2:32:26] expect very much to come out of a
[2:32:27] marriage like that so when we find out
[2:32:30] when Jan had ascended to the throne he
[2:32:32] was a borderline believer just a halfway
[2:32:35] lukew believer so many of them in the
[2:32:37] world tonight jehoram would set his sail
[2:32:39] and any way the wind was blowing that's
[2:32:41] the way jeam would go and that's the
[2:32:44] matter with the church tonight they set
[2:32:46] their sa to every form of Doctrine toss
[2:32:48] about from Pillar To Post not knowing
[2:32:50] where to stand or what to do and when
[2:32:52] the little Trials come up the little
[2:32:53] afflictions away they go this
[2:32:56] way their Methodist today Baptist
[2:32:58] tomorrow Pentecostal next day a Lutheran
[2:33:00] the next day 7 Day Adventist Jehovah
[2:33:02] witht they don't know where they stand
[2:33:03] tossed about borderline packing your
[2:33:05] church letter from one place to another
[2:33:07] what good does it do anyhow that's how
[2:33:08] bam described this
[2:33:10] King could you take some more are you
[2:33:12] with
[2:33:14] me verse four and Misha king of Moab was
[2:33:17] a sheep master and rendered unto the
[2:33:19] king of Israel 100,000 lambs and 100,000
[2:33:22] Rams with W taxation right but it came
[2:33:25] to pass when Ahab was dead that the king
[2:33:27] of Moab rebelled against the king of
[2:33:29] Israel and King jehoram went out of
[2:33:32] Samaria at the same time and numbered
[2:33:34] all Israel in other words he preparing
[2:33:36] for war you see how much men we have
[2:33:37] count them because now there's a
[2:33:39] rebellion in the
[2:33:43] camp and understanding
[2:33:46] this political unrest thank you brother
[2:33:48] Anthony he knows when he numbered them
[2:33:50] he clearly didn't have enough men to
[2:33:51] fight
[2:33:53] Moab so verse seven says and he went and
[2:33:55] sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah
[2:33:58] saying the king of Moab had rebelled
[2:34:00] against me will thou go with me against
[2:34:03] Moab to battle in other words I need
[2:34:04] support and you have to realize friends
[2:34:07] there are some things in life you could
[2:34:08] never do
[2:34:09] alone you have to get some kind of
[2:34:12] support is not
[2:34:15] right and brother Olu in the message
[2:34:18] last week was speaking about it wasn't
[2:34:19] good for man to be alone that God wants
[2:34:21] us to be part of a community part of a
[2:34:23] family part of a body because that is
[2:34:25] part of The Human Experience there are
[2:34:28] some things you are able to achieve no
[2:34:30] company is a one there's no one man big
[2:34:32] company it doesn't exist a company made
[2:34:35] up of teams and departments and managers
[2:34:37] and all these things because to do
[2:34:38] anything great there has to be a
[2:34:39] community around it so King jehoram is
[2:34:42] sharp enough to know this Rebellion I
[2:34:45] cannot deal with it on my own but I have
[2:34:48] to get some support so he went and sent
[2:34:50] to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah saying
[2:34:52] the king of Moab have rebelled against
[2:34:53] me will thou go with me against Moab to
[2:34:56] battle and he said this is Jehosaphat
[2:34:58] responded I will go up I am as Thou Art
[2:35:01] in other words I see you as my brother
[2:35:04] my people as thy people and my horses
[2:35:06] are thy horses so whatever supporting in
[2:35:09] other words I have your
[2:35:12] back brother Bram said though that in
[2:35:16] looking at this situation he said
[2:35:18] Jehosaphat was a righteous man
[2:35:20] but he said I want you to notice how
[2:35:22] easy it is sometimes on a little
[2:35:23] persuasion for a Christian to get in the
[2:35:25] wrong company trying to be a Pity in
[2:35:28] other words brother the BR is saying
[2:35:29] that Jehoshaphat in supporting jehoram
[2:35:32] wasn't even doing the right
[2:35:34] thing because God already had judgment
[2:35:38] over
[2:35:39] Israel so Jehosaphat trying to be a good
[2:35:42] brother was actually out of line because
[2:35:45] judgment was already over Israel Over
[2:35:47] the way they were living are you with me
[2:35:49] that's why but say compassion is not
[2:35:50] feeling sorry for people it's doing the
[2:35:52] will of
[2:35:55] God anybody with me I want to kind of
[2:35:58] skip
[2:35:59] through verse eight and he said which
[2:36:01] way shall we go up and he answered the
[2:36:03] way through the Wilderness of
[2:36:05] Edom so the king of Israel went jehoram
[2:36:09] and the king of Judah Jehoshaphat and
[2:36:11] the king of Edom went I don't even know
[2:36:12] how Edom going make this
[2:36:15] thing because there in now gone from uh
[2:36:19] true believer in the type of Jehoshaphat
[2:36:21] to a make believer in the type of
[2:36:23] jehoram to the king of Edom who is a
[2:36:25] rank
[2:36:27] unbeliever but it's three of them in
[2:36:30] this war like a church in every church
[2:36:32] are three kind of Believers here we have
[2:36:34] a type of Jehoshaphat jehoram and the
[2:36:36] king of Edom I don't even think they
[2:36:37] name
[2:36:39] him but in every church have three kinds
[2:36:41] of
[2:36:42] Believers and in this Alliance which is
[2:36:44] important to have alliances you have two
[2:36:46] kind of Believers you have Jehoshaphat
[2:36:48] you have jehoram and the king of of Edom
[2:36:50] who we have no name for him but we just
[2:36:52] know he
[2:36:53] there so the king of Israel went and the
[2:36:55] king of Judah and the king of Edom and
[2:36:57] they fetch a compass of seven days
[2:36:59] journey and there was no water for the
[2:37:02] host and for the cattle that followed
[2:37:04] them and I want to pick up a point
[2:37:07] here this Alliance didn't even have a
[2:37:10] real plan because if you going into war
[2:37:13] brother George you need to count a
[2:37:15] scripture which man going to war when
[2:37:17] count he call before he go to war and
[2:37:18] see the army fight all these things how
[2:37:20] we can go into war with no
[2:37:23] water seven days journey and there was
[2:37:25] no water for the host and the C so they
[2:37:27] left without even a plan for the
[2:37:31] water so in other words whatever they
[2:37:34] were caught up in and saying let we go
[2:37:35] and fight them fellas even think the
[2:37:37] thing through and many times we approach
[2:37:39] situation in life without a plan and I
[2:37:41] said before God is not a rester he's a
[2:37:44] planner there are many quotes where say
[2:37:46] God is not halfhazard God not saying
[2:37:48] oops I make a I forget to give you
[2:37:50] something and I forget to do something
[2:37:52] he said I will give you everything you
[2:37:53] need to
[2:37:54] go and wherever you go Elijah there's a
[2:37:57] woman there she will feed you when it's
[2:38:00] time he send Ravens to feed him there's
[2:38:03] provision when in part of God there's no
[2:38:05] wonder about provision can I he will
[2:38:08] take care of you can I say that one more
[2:38:10] time when you're along the path that God
[2:38:12] wants you to walk there will be
[2:38:14] provision
[2:38:25] I'll skip through some history but Edom
[2:38:28] really come out of Esau
[2:38:30] line you know Esau was a whole project
[2:38:32] by itself so we we kind of skripture
[2:38:35] that I have all the scriptures here for
[2:38:36] that but I want to kind of reach a point
[2:38:41] here so when they realized water
[2:38:45] literally more than flour in this case
[2:38:46] they have no water the king of Israel
[2:38:49] said alas that the Lord had called these
[2:38:51] these three kings together to deliver
[2:38:53] them into the hand of Moab now this here
[2:38:54] is a real interesting statement because
[2:38:57] here it is the king of Israel who is
[2:39:00] backsliding is saying alas is the Lord
[2:39:02] had called us together the Lord had
[2:39:05] nothing would call them
[2:39:07] together so you have people like to say
[2:39:09] but is the Lord brought me to this the
[2:39:11] Lord did not bring you
[2:39:14] there but yeah people like to talk this
[2:39:17] way but the Lord told me how you end up
[2:39:19] in problem the Lord did not take you
[2:39:21] there that's why there's a distinction
[2:39:23] between the trials you put yourself in
[2:39:25] and the Lord leading You Into the
[2:39:29] Wilderness this was not the Lord leading
[2:39:32] this was you in your emotion and your
[2:39:34] feelings and all these things end up in
[2:39:36] and say well is the Lord you know is the
[2:39:38] Lord who took us here and
[2:39:39] and and you have to be very careful with
[2:39:41] people who talk that way so the king of
[2:39:44] Israel said alas that the Lord had
[2:39:46] called these treat this this is them
[2:39:47] trying to comfort themselves three kings
[2:39:50] to deliver them into the hand of Moab
[2:39:52] but thank God for brother Jehoshaphat
[2:39:54] the One True Believer among them he said
[2:39:56] is there not here a prophet of the
[2:39:59] Lord because Joseph had realized listen
[2:40:02] this thing are going nowhere no man have
[2:40:04] a word from the Lord but if there is a
[2:40:06] man who has a word from the Lord because
[2:40:08] the prophet is the mouthpiece of God he
[2:40:10] said is there not here a prophet of the
[2:40:12] Lord that we may inquire of the Lord in
[2:40:15] other words Jehoshaphat take this man
[2:40:17] word for it he said there has to be I
[2:40:18] want to talk to the prophet it because
[2:40:20] this plan already
[2:40:22] fa you have to know where the plan fa
[2:40:24] and you need to get better help than
[2:40:26] what you had so far this is 2024 into
[2:40:29] 2025 looking at where you're at and
[2:40:31] realizing something needs to change he
[2:40:33] say is there not a prophet in here that
[2:40:35] we may inquire of the Lord because I
[2:40:38] want us to note up until this point
[2:40:40] there was no mention of prayer fasting
[2:40:42] seeking the will brother Anthony sang
[2:40:45] the song with Zig David said Lord they
[2:40:48] took my family he say shall I pursue in
[2:40:50] other words one thing that made David a
[2:40:53] man after God's Own Heart is he never
[2:40:55] move without first talking to the Lord
[2:40:57] he said Lord if you tell me to pursue
[2:40:58] I'm ready to go if it tell me to stay
[2:41:00] here I'm staying right here but not
[2:41:02] flying off the hand and doing what I
[2:41:03] want to do are you with me so what we
[2:41:06] see is a picture of three men
[2:41:08] Jehoshaphat with his nice good heart
[2:41:10] come to support his brother who contrary
[2:41:12] to begin with nobody pray about the
[2:41:15] matter nobody sought the Lord to see
[2:41:18] Lord is this what want us to do now
[2:41:20] after the fact is a you know in the pr
[2:41:22] world is a whole cleanup campaign is
[2:41:24] there is there not a prophet who we
[2:41:25] could talk to who could help fix this
[2:41:28] situation because here we are now
[2:41:29] Stranded the situation is dire they have
[2:41:32] no water if they don't get water in
[2:41:34] three days water but be men dead or
[2:41:39] no one of the king of Israel's servants
[2:41:42] answered and said here is
[2:41:45] Elisha the son of shaffat which poured
[2:41:49] water water on the hands of Elijah what
[2:41:51] about Spirit of Elijah is something else
[2:41:54] Elijah Elisha John the Baptist brother
[2:41:56] brandom Elijah to come this the spirit
[2:41:58] of Elijah is tiing this whole narrative
[2:42:00] here and Jehoshaphat said the word of
[2:42:02] the Lord is with him so the king of
[2:42:05] Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of
[2:42:07] Edom the unbeliever went down to
[2:42:10] him and Elisha said unto the king of
[2:42:14] Israel and this is to show you how God
[2:42:16] operates and how his servants operate
[2:42:18] because there is a prophet he say what I
[2:42:19] have to do with
[2:42:21] thee in other words you already reached
[2:42:24] here you already make it now you want to
[2:42:25] come to make it my problem what have I
[2:42:27] to do with the you're living with the
[2:42:30] desires of your own heart and now you're
[2:42:32] coming to me I want us to understand as
[2:42:35] we venture into 2025 it is important for
[2:42:38] you to seek the Lord before you make any
[2:42:40] moves can we hold to that
[2:42:45] truth and Elisha said unto the king of
[2:42:47] Israel what have I to do with the get
[2:42:49] thee to the prophets of thy father this
[2:42:51] song in just like it did in the Book of
[2:42:53] Judges go to the gods you serve go to
[2:42:55] the prophets you serve go to all them
[2:42:57] things you been feeding on because only
[2:42:59] when it look as if your life falling
[2:43:01] apart you want to run to
[2:43:03] church anybody with me we almost done I
[2:43:06] just want to make sure we close this
[2:43:07] point here what have I to do with thee
[2:43:09] get thee to the prophets of thy father
[2:43:11] and to the prophets of thy mother in
[2:43:13] other words the prophets of Ahab and
[2:43:14] Jezebel you
[2:43:16] know because many of us we see God God
[2:43:19] and church and as a thing of
[2:43:22] convenience we come to church because
[2:43:24] it's convenient it's it's something to
[2:43:26] do it's a it's really a religious
[2:43:30] spirit and here it is Elijah is
[2:43:33] identifying the religious spirit on
[2:43:35] jehoram saying go to the prophets who
[2:43:38] you have been serving what have I to do
[2:43:40] with
[2:43:40] thee and the king of Israel sent him n
[2:43:43] for the Lord you see again the king is
[2:43:46] speaking on behalf of the Lord without
[2:43:48] permission
[2:43:49] the Lord had called these three kings
[2:43:51] together to deliver them into the hand
[2:43:52] of
[2:43:53] Moab and Elisha rebota say as the Lord
[2:43:57] of host liveth before whom I stand
[2:43:58] surely were it not that I regard the
[2:44:02] presence of Jehoshaphat the king of
[2:44:04] Judah I would not look toward thee nor
[2:44:06] see thee in other words it's not the
[2:44:07] Lord have you here because if it wasn't
[2:44:10] for Jehoshaphat being in this room I
[2:44:12] walking out of here because God is not
[2:44:14] with
[2:44:16] this are we there this morning
[2:44:21] and I love how this ties here and this
[2:44:23] is the right time the musician could get
[2:44:24] ready now but in Scripture it says now
[2:44:27] bring me a
[2:44:30] Minstrel so elishah knew that in order
[2:44:33] to shift the atmosphere of what was
[2:44:36] wrong they had to get in the spirit of
[2:44:37] worship he said let's change that bring
[2:44:40] a
[2:44:40] Minstrel and it came to pass that when
[2:44:43] the minstrel played then the hand of the
[2:44:46] Lord came upon him in other words it
[2:44:48] took a period of worship and and
[2:44:50] anointing and because elishah at this
[2:44:52] point he had to he himself but the
[2:44:54] George had to get in the spirit to know
[2:44:56] because you bring him out from where he
[2:44:58] was at into a situation that God never
[2:45:00] sent him there officially so he said
[2:45:02] let's get in the
[2:45:06] atmosphere verse 16 and he said thus say
[2:45:09] the Lord make this Valley full of
[2:45:11] ditches for thus sayeth the Lord ye
[2:45:13] shall not see wind in other words it
[2:45:15] will not be something that's
[2:45:17] visible neither shall you see rain in
[2:45:20] other words I want you to know that is
[2:45:21] the Lord doing this and he is doing it
[2:45:24] yet that Valley shall be filled with
[2:45:26] water that you may drink both ye and
[2:45:28] your cattle and your beast and this is
[2:45:30] but a light thing in the sight of the
[2:45:32] Lord he will deliver the moabites also
[2:45:34] into your hand and he shall Smite every
[2:45:36] Fen City and every choice City and shall
[2:45:39] fell every good tree and stop all Wells
[2:45:42] of water and Mar every good piece of
[2:45:44] land with stones can the church say amen
[2:45:48] and we know that they had the victory so
[2:45:50] friends this is the closing part of this
[2:45:52] message here you got to dig a valley
[2:45:56] full of ditches because the rain is
