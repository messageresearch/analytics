[6:54] solitary way

[6:58] and thirsty
[7:00] their soul fainted when in them

[7:05] trouble and he delivered them out of

[18:00] thank you for coming this evening i just
[18:03] want to make you welcome
[18:04] and i want to
[18:06] introduce brother owen he really doesn't
[18:08] need an introduction we all know him in
[18:10] his life his ministry has been a
[18:12] blessing to us appreciate each one that
[18:15] has come out
[18:16] i did have a little um
[18:19] little quote here from brother coleman
[18:22] uh
[18:23] actually it's
[18:25] part of brother brown's
[18:27] quote here i'd like to read
[18:29] it's talking about the gift
[18:31] of a minister
[18:34] and
[18:35] where would we be
[18:37] unless we would have
[18:39] a true minister of the gospel speaking
[18:42] the truth before us you know
[18:45] brother coleman our brother brown here
[18:47] and i perceive you to be a prophet
[18:49] connorsville 53
[18:51] now
[18:52] to bring up this faith in christ there's
[18:55] ministers
[18:56] that's the most important thing of the
[18:58] day
[18:59] is a good god-sent creature
[19:02] i admire them and their gift is far
[19:05] beyond as far beyond anything could be
[19:08] done and anything else is a preacher a
[19:11] man who knows how to rightly divide the
[19:14] word of god
[19:15] it's the most wonderful gift in the
[19:17] world is to be a minister
[19:19] which is which was a new testament
[19:22] modern
[19:23] a preacher
[19:25] prophecy means to foretell or tell
[19:27] something
[19:28] some personal thing
[19:30] in other words if you read the bible and
[19:32] start telling
[19:34] then that's a teacher
[19:37] but see but a prophecy is to testify or
[19:41] foretell and the spirit of christ is
[19:44] prophecy
[19:46] and
[19:47] i believe brother uh
[19:50] you know he's i've had our pastors
[19:52] faithful to the prophet's message a gift
[19:56] of wisdom of revelation to put the word
[19:58] of god together to prophesy to testify
[20:02] to foretell something by inspiration to
[20:05] be moved by the holy ghost
[20:07] to hold a straight course
[20:09] even
[20:10] to teach the truth directly
[20:13] and correctly
[20:15] never misinterpreting never mishandling
[20:18] never disallocating the word of god
[20:21] but always saying what the prophet said
[20:24] amen
[20:25] say what god says it is written amen
[20:29] and you know
[20:31] i've always
[20:32] i'm just a
[20:33] simple country boy
[20:35] abroad you know up here i i don't really
[20:37] belong here
[20:38] but you know
[20:40] god knows what he's doing he brought me
[20:42] in here from the corn fields of northern
[20:44] indiana this little cowboy
[20:46] you know and
[20:48] i believe in seedtime harvest
[20:52] you want a cornfield
[20:54] you gotta plant corn
[20:56] you can't plant corn expect
[20:58] wheat
[21:00] it don't change in the middle of the
[21:01] course
[21:03] and if you want to harvest
[21:04] the holy spirit
[21:06] you've got to sow the seeds that's why
[21:08] the prophet brought it and the ministers
[21:10] have brought it forth
[21:12] and i just appreciate
[21:15] the seed that has been placed in my soul
[21:21] amen
[21:26] you don't change halfway when you see a
[21:28] good fruit it started from the beginning
[21:31] as a good seed
[21:32] amen
[21:35] when you plant corn you can't
[21:37] expect anything else
[21:39] the lord knows each one of our hearts
[21:42] and it's and we're predestinated us to
[21:44] stand here today
[21:46] how
[21:47] before our weddings
[21:49] we didn't do it ourselves
[21:51] we have nothing to do with
[21:53] god's grace that we can stand here
[21:56] amen
[21:57] and he we stand here
[21:59] and we can gather together
[22:01] but unless the holy spirit comes
[22:04] and a supernatural element drops into
[22:06] this place lord we're just wasting our
[22:08] time
[22:09] sure we enjoy the fellowship
[22:11] many of you come miles around we we have
[22:14] a good time but unless the holy spirit
[22:16] drops here
[22:18] what good is it amen
[22:23] the prophet says the natural the
[22:25] supernatural element of any group of
[22:28] people is a lifeblood of that church
[22:31] amen
[22:32] it could be two or three gathered
[22:34] together wherever you are in whatever
[22:36] corner of the world
[22:37] he'd meet you there
[22:39] he has
[22:40] i'm a witness
[22:41] amen thank you thank you lord
[22:53] his brother uh brother
[22:55] would prepare to come forward
[22:57] and bring us the word this evening
[22:59] let's just sing a song
[23:02] um let's just sing that again
[23:06] just to be close to you
[23:09] trust
[23:20] so just to me close to you
[23:25] is my
[23:26] desire
[23:31] just to be close to you
[23:46] is my desire
[24:25] um
[24:35] just
[25:07] is
[25:34] is
[25:53] and also
[26:08] so as long
[26:22] experience
[27:29] if there is a purpose if there is a
[27:30] predestination if there
[27:33] that is defined for your life
[27:35] there is no way you could miss it
[27:38] all things truly work
[27:47] uh together reason that i try to push as
[27:49] much as i can
[27:51] years ago
[27:52] something to me that i think uh one of
[27:54] the pastors
[27:56] do all that you can finish it now right
[27:59] because
[28:15] children employees
[28:17] um
[28:19] that do not stop because of the
[28:21] religious beliefs and iraq itself how
[28:23] can nineteen years only fifteen years
[28:25] old want to leave america leave england
[28:27] and grow and join isis
[28:29] and be so committed to his high eyes and
[28:31] so on they
[28:32] see
[28:33] how you are with western
[28:35] uh dressing and clothing and materials
[28:38] and you you bloat your mind to think of
[28:40] christians training with
[28:42] those
[29:10] alone
[29:24] and heavy but we're gonna win amen are
[29:27] we gonna make it
[29:28] many groups start many people start is
[29:30] not distracted
[29:32] that's
[29:39] group right or a church overcoming a
[29:41] noble individual
[29:43] the bible itself said to him that
[29:45] overcome it
[29:48] belongs to the individual
[29:50] a pastor can overcome for you you have
[29:52] to overcome for himself
[29:55] for himself that life could flow through
[29:58] him to you
[29:59] but you have to overcome
[30:01] and it has been speaking and overcome
[30:04] you must not believe it
[30:10] and you are not alone in your struggle
[30:12] amen everybody have a struggle
[30:14] if you don't have a struggle something
[30:16] is wrong with you you've got to have a
[30:19] struggle
[30:20] that is what shows
[30:35] along with satan to choose your mind as
[30:38] a backup
[30:39] so you have nothing to do with that
[30:41] that's right the battle must just rage
[30:43] in your mind but you know who gonna win
[30:48] but the
[31:17] with written history and travel you can
[31:18] see something different but the reality
[31:20] is
[31:21] i did not meet but
[31:23] that's right
[31:25] i remember
[31:27] i ended up the opportunity to go to the
[31:29] paradigm
[31:40] [Applause]
[31:45] and asked that god will send men that
[31:48] would take the message and make more
[31:50] sense
[31:52] with his limited education
[31:54] that need to be unfolded not only that
[31:56] he was removing time
[32:54] you've got to run
[33:08] know get a kind of sign that i have to
[33:11] repeat to
[33:12] get messages and pick up again and write
[33:14] down the spot that's right so that's
[33:16] what i've been doing some pages here i
[33:17] know you can get some stuff but
[33:19] sometimes they get something right on
[33:20] the spot so in india i preach
[33:22] messages i've never done that before i
[33:25] chose only six services
[33:27] i told the version to take the first one
[33:29] and i will do the next five
[33:31] so i preached five on the table for the
[33:33] health and strength of the game
[33:34] the first message was the prophetic
[33:36] vision the second message of the world
[33:37] bride the tip of the land spoke
[33:40] the fourth was the
[33:41] inheritance divided and the last one of
[33:44] the final votes
[33:46] the prophetic vision was an overview
[33:50] of this whole inspiration and vision
[33:52] brown broad
[33:54] and just went on like that with the word
[33:56] with the blood and the inheritance the
[33:59] spirit may define it
[34:01] because as much as we love the moses
[34:04] inspiration moses is a prophet
[34:08] but then god told joshua moses
[34:12] take this people over
[34:15] and there was no physical joshua as we
[34:17] know
[34:18] the holy
[34:41] reading from revelation chapter 21.
[34:49] [Music]
[35:09] and they came unto me one of the seven
[35:10] angels
[35:12] which had the seven vials
[35:14] full of the months please
[35:17] and talk with me say come heather
[35:19] i wish you lead the bride
[35:22] the man's wife
[35:29] [Music]
[35:41] his wife has made himself
[35:46] 14.
[36:00] i press towards the mark
[36:03] of the prize
[36:04] of the high calling of god in christ
[36:07] jesus
[36:12] bless the believers we love you you
[36:15] don't worship you and jesus
[36:29] tonight i want to
[36:49] another subject
[36:51] the bride's
[37:25] that there is an absence of a passion
[37:29] and a desire for our reality in god
[37:33] and it almost appears as if it is up to
[37:36] god
[37:37] so just sit
[37:39] and wait
[37:40] sit and die
[37:42] sit and get home sit and kill him
[37:46] but i want to bring something a little
[37:48] different tonight from paul
[37:51] and paul
[37:52] said
[37:53] i press
[37:55] to watch the mark
[37:57] for the prize
[37:59] of the high calling of god
[38:01] because
[38:03] i want you to notice two things here
[38:06] one is
[38:08] i'll press towards the mark and that
[38:10] mark is the goal
[38:13] to obtain the price and the price is a
[38:16] reward says two things
[38:18] there is a goal
[38:20] and there is a reward right the goal is
[38:23] what you can accomplish right the goal
[38:26] is what you can achieve
[38:28] the reward that's given to you
[38:30] based upon
[38:41] [Music]
[38:45] you could fix and so forth but let me
[38:47] just give you a definition of what comes
[38:49] out as a goal i want you to bring that
[38:52] the goal is the end result or
[38:55] achievement
[38:56] in which effort is directed is a goal
[39:01] the end result or achievement in which
[39:04] effort
[39:06] is
[39:07] directed that's the goal all right
[39:10] i'm just going to read this is something
[39:12] the difference between a dream and a
[39:14] goal is that a dream is fantasy
[39:16] something you dream and never actually
[39:19] pursue
[39:20] but a goal on the other hand is a
[39:23] concrete thing in which you set into
[39:25] motion the steps
[39:35] therefore it's also the results of
[39:37] achievement towards the effort that's
[39:38] directed so our goal is a target a
[39:41] purpose
[39:42] our objective
[39:44] an intention
[39:46] all of that
[39:47] a goal is something that we want enough
[39:50] that we make an effort to reach it
[39:54] we must want it enough
[39:56] to make an effort to reach it
[39:59] our goal is not the same as i want amen
[40:02] hallelujah a person may want a nicer car
[40:05] they might want a nicer house not what
[40:06] you want but it's not strong enough to
[40:08] be a goal that you can say you're going
[40:10] to put aside money to get this side of
[40:12] the car okay this nicer house because
[40:14] there's a goal that's different now you
[40:16] make sacrifices
[40:18] you make an effort come on now because
[40:20] you want to achieve this goal it's not
[40:22] right blessed be the name of the lord so
[40:25] unless we want that car enough to work
[40:28] at getting in it is a fantasy right it's
[40:30] a dream it's not a goal but when we want
[40:33] to make that dream a reality
[40:36] then it's a goal when you put the effort
[40:39] behind it isn't that right do you love
[40:41] him tonight
[40:42] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[40:44] now a reward on the other hand is
[40:47] something given or received in
[40:49] recompense for worthy behavior or in
[40:52] retribution for evil acts that is what
[40:55] the definitional reward is are repeated
[40:57] a reward is something given or received
[41:01] in recompense for worthy behavior or in
[41:04] retribution for evil acts a reward is a
[41:06] thing given in recognition of one's
[41:09] service effort or achievement right
[41:12] isn't that right
[41:14] isn't that right yeah so therefore i
[41:17] think given recognition for one service
[41:19] achievement something give them an
[41:20] exchange for good behavior or good work
[41:23] something good that happens that you
[41:25] receive because of something you have
[41:27] done
[41:28] jesus said behold i come quickly and my
[41:30] reward is with me to give every man
[41:33] according as his work shall be
[41:36] so reward is coming according to works
[41:39] before without works faith is stone dead
[41:43] so people can say what they want about
[41:44] fate but this we're gonna get into that
[41:47] that faith will produce action is not
[41:50] right
[41:52] so jacob grace drew perfection with a
[41:54] prophetic vision for the bride amen
[41:57] isn't that right a vision that tells us
[41:59] that we are going to be perfect
[42:09] but we are saying jacob grace but he's a
[42:11] target that's right
[42:29] you can't just hope it's going to happen
[42:31] you've got to know it's got to happen
[42:35] you've got to want it to happen and have
[42:37] a purpose to see it happen it's a man
[42:40] right
[42:40] so therefore this vision this prophetic
[42:43] vision was sealed god told daniel go
[42:46] right away the book was sealed by
[42:48] revelation 10 to the seven angel the
[42:51] prophetic vision was unsealed but
[42:53] without a vision the people perish
[42:56] without a vision the ministers will be
[42:58] speaking on different topics and
[43:00] different issues but the dynamics has
[43:03] been here as the spirit of prophecy
[43:05] average is the testimony of jesus
[43:08] because as long as the word of
[43:09] fulfillment is not activated to be
[43:12] fulfilled in the only prophecy yeah
[43:14] prophecy in other words god spoke to
[43:16] abraham he could have anxiety as long as
[43:18] isaac did not get born abram could only
[43:21] speak by prophecy
[43:53] you are going to be delivered you are
[43:55] going to be set free and god put that
[43:57] over your life
[43:59] oh hallelujah
[44:01] glory to glory man
[44:03] glory all right
[44:05] so therefore the vision of the world
[44:08] was restored by william branner right he
[44:10] tied up the loose ends he tied up all
[44:13] outstanding issues so that you can know
[44:16] your husband even your mate
[44:19] so therefore your husband your husband
[44:21] was scattered throughout seven ages your
[44:23] husband was divided into the second past
[44:26] your husband his word was lost to the
[44:28] ages so god sent elias
[44:31] to restore back of your husband because
[44:34] the husband have
[44:55] a jonah for flesh and blood i'd never
[44:57] reveal this unto you but my father which
[44:59] is in heaven i'll reveal it to you upon
[45:02] this rock i'll build my church
[45:04] the true
[45:06] revelation of the word that's what the
[45:07] prophet said amen
[45:09] is the truth of vine again what is faith
[45:12] faith is something that is revealed to
[45:14] you that is not yet but you believe it
[45:19] will be
[45:20] faith is something that's revealed to
[45:22] you
[45:23] that is not yet but you believe it will
[45:26] be
[45:27] faith is a revelation of the will of
[45:30] god and when god revealed to you his
[45:34] will for your life no man can take that
[45:36] off
[45:37] in our words faith is never a group
[45:39] thing that's right hey it's not a group
[45:42] thing that's right god of the wreck
[45:52] that individuals could get divine
[45:56] revelations
[46:08] we all feel safe among friends yeah

[46:13] family very nice family beautiful family

[48:31] mystery mystery mystery
[49:01] this is the way i challenge you you
[49:03] can't sit there
[49:04] just believe in anymore
[49:06] you've got to possess
[49:10] that reason right now when i think about
[49:11] it
[49:13] it's scary yeah it's scary yeah just
[49:16] like ebola is scary people are dying
[49:18] with something just some people wouldn't
[49:20] even want to travel
[49:21] why because they know that's dead that's
[49:24] death don't touch it it is death i mean
[49:26] real death
[49:28] but
[49:37] there's got to be something on the
[49:39] outside that's right that the devil
[49:42] recognizes off rule hands off
[49:46] get your hands over hallelujah
[49:49] oh glory hallelujah
[49:50] [Applause]
[49:52] ezekiel 9.
[49:54] ezekiel 9 god said send us
[50:10] who
[51:00] somebody
[51:14] i am god
[51:16] you are the holy spirit
[51:49] of this reveal aged the time of the
[51:52] revelation of these things and being
[51:53] known
[51:54] the fullness of the revelation bringing
[51:57] to a close of japanese
[51:59] age of cancer
[52:01] number 11
[52:02] before the judgment of the underlying
[52:05] number 12.
[52:07] on the number 11 the 11th hour gentile
[52:09] guidance called out by a word message to
[52:12] receive the same penny
[52:14] the same holy ghost that they had in
[52:16] pentecost
[52:56] cannot bypass the holy ghost you cannot
[52:58] bypass these things we have got to
[53:00] receive it yeah i know it's wrong but i
[53:03] don't promise
[53:15] [Applause]
[53:27] that would take the message on he'd be
[53:28] an odd person but he writes after this
[53:31] and take the message on you listen to it
[53:33] as long as it's scripture right
[53:37] you see nothing is just open-ended god
[53:39] doesn't operate like that that's why
[53:41] paul said follow me he didn't say follow
[53:43] me no as i follow christ so you've got
[53:46] to know christ in order to effectively
[53:48] follow or give the lord some praise
[53:52] amen
[53:53] so jesus he said how be it that when the
[53:56] spirit is come he will guide you into
[53:59] all truth isn't that right so therefore
[54:01] what he hears he will speak he will show
[54:03] you things to come
[54:04] therefore the spirit of truth that was
[54:07] promised to come after the prophet can
[54:09] only speak according to the vision
[54:12] i want to say it again this prayer of
[54:14] truth that was promised to come after
[54:16] the spirit of prophecy
[54:18] after the prophet king can only speak
[54:20] according to the vision because the
[54:22] vision is from a point in time
[54:25] even the time of life
[54:26] for its fulfillment and manifestation
[54:30] all hell will be against this prophetic
[54:32] vision i will try to overthrow it but
[54:34] hell will fail because jesus and the
[54:37] gates of hell will not prevail against
[54:39] this rock revelation
[54:41] revealed by luke 17 30 the son of man
[54:44] working in and through that mighty
[54:45] prophet elijah
[54:47] isn't that right so what about him said
[54:49] love is an age the messenger of malachi
[54:52] 4 and religion 10 7 is going to do two
[54:54] things according to malachi 4 he will
[54:56] turn the hearts of the children to the
[54:58] fathers two he revealed the mysteries of
[55:01] the seven thunders in revelation 10
[55:03] which are the revolutions contained in
[55:05] the seven scenes here we go it will be
[55:07] these divinely revealed
[55:10] mystery truths not understood by mystery
[55:13] truths
[55:16] amen
[55:17] truth a man cannot give you divine
[55:20] revelation that's right you could hear
[55:22] what man speaks but revelation comes
[55:24] from god
[55:25] and the holy ghost alone is the reveal
[55:29] of the revelation of god so even though
[55:32] i'm speaking the spirit can come upon
[55:34] you and reveal his word to you that has
[55:38] nothing to do with anybody else
[55:40] it is your father
[55:42] it is your husband it is elohim
[56:01] three the faith had to be ripened for
[56:05] the faith had to be manifested let's go
[56:07] again number one but obama had to
[56:08] restore the faith two the faith had to
[56:11] be revealed three the faith had to be
[56:13] ripened because you're faithful
[56:41] glory to god
[56:48] stop looking for gifts look for him the
[56:51] word your husband
[56:53] come on now
[56:55] hallelujah
[56:56] because his
[57:02] hallelujah
[57:13] [Applause]
[57:38] you are the wife
[57:52] you have got to come into a divine
[57:55] revelation
[57:56] who you are in god
[57:58] remember the story of whatever
[58:00] by the man looking for a wife went to
[58:02] this party and so on and everybody
[58:04] carrying on and put on the dress and so
[58:05] on and he was fed up with
[58:35] from listening those words those words
[58:36] got washed and cleaned
[58:38] man she was bleeding
[58:43] and she came over there she's smiling
[58:45] she's in an atmosphere she just got a
[58:47] promise
[59:00] that's right
[59:30] revolution does that so she was in that
[59:33] revelation spirit right that's the oh
[59:34] you're smiling like that you're always
[59:37] watching girl um
[59:57] he told me i'm gonna get his name all
[1:00:00] right i'm gonna get a new name
[1:00:02] you gotta be kidding me
[1:00:04] she said you're gonna get married
[1:00:07] that was the joke of the night
[1:00:09] they went late night laughing
[1:00:11] they laughed they couldn't
[1:00:36] that's right
[1:01:08] maybe
[1:01:23] what's your goal what's the bride goes
[1:01:25] she's one thing you need ready she got
[1:01:27] the clothes she got the dress
[1:01:29] oh my god those cousins say she in
[1:01:31] fantasyland it's fantastic man and i'm
[1:01:34] showing that dress i have no fantasy man
[1:01:46] not everybody gonna be ready
[1:02:04] he says now watch you see the devil
[1:02:06] power is the debt
[1:02:08] he has no power beyond death dead ends
[1:02:11] his power that's right so therefore the
[1:02:13] devil will bring you down to death and
[1:02:15] then
[1:02:15] his job finished but faith here we go
[1:02:19] faith sees the resurrection amen amen
[1:02:24] of the resurrection that's the power to
[1:02:26] believe so when you have faith to see
[1:02:29] resurrection power
[1:02:31] is finished in your life
[1:02:46] falling doesn't mean finish that's right
[1:02:48] vote stuck with f yeah hallelujah
[1:02:52] pouring doesn't mean you're finished
[1:02:54] because it's falling down god jesus said
[1:02:56] destroy this body and i'll look at that
[1:02:58] myself
[1:03:00] oh
[1:03:14] i knew
[1:03:28] mechanics
[1:03:51] [Applause]
[1:03:56] hallelujah
[1:04:08] bring back the church to the word what
[1:04:11] is this messenger of malachi 4 to do
[1:04:13] restore back the original fate the
[1:04:15] resurrection faith that they see in
[1:04:17] jesus
[1:04:18] after he had raised from the dead
[1:04:20] see him working among them
[1:04:23] so what must you see you must see jesus
[1:04:26] back among us since the prophet left
[1:04:29] so the prophetic vision that shows what
[1:04:32] the field is and what it is for it is
[1:04:35] resurrection faith to bring down
[1:04:37] dynamics for birth and refilling amen
[1:04:40] that is what the vision is it is to
[1:04:42] produce not just faith because peter had
[1:04:45] that but they went in with the mode
[1:04:49] and under a crying move but when jesus
[1:04:51] appeared unto them and gave a private
[1:04:54] ministry to this elected bond
[1:04:57] then their faith was sealed so upon that
[1:04:59] resurrection faith in them he said
[1:05:02] receive it holy amen he knew now they
[1:05:05] were ready for divine promise
[1:05:20] don't walk
[1:05:33] oh
[1:05:42] what we see happen
[1:05:44] should put every soul in action
[1:05:47] it should make a church that would make
[1:05:50] a revival that's a goal
[1:05:52] that's not a reward
[1:05:54] that's a goal that is the church
[1:05:56] understanding by revelation
[1:05:58] that the minister don't make a revival
[1:06:01] it's the people that bring a revival
[1:06:11] oh
[1:06:24] it should make a church that would make
[1:06:25] a revival here in phoenix that people
[1:06:28] will be flying from europe to see what's
[1:06:30] taken
[1:06:44] we're not talking about that
[1:06:46] no no no
[1:06:47] with it i like how you say it
[1:06:50] no no no that we don't want to connect
[1:06:51] ourselves we want people to come and see
[1:06:54] that's right because the only way
[1:06:55] invisible to become
[1:07:05] do you hear what i'm saying tonight the
[1:07:07] only way invisible could become visible
[1:07:10] is for the world to become flesh
[1:07:21] [Applause]
[1:07:26] we're not playing with words this is not
[1:07:28] a word game
[1:07:30] no this is reality
[1:07:32] this is life and death this is the angel
[1:07:34] on the earth
[1:07:36] but the plagues but the viles
[1:07:39] oh hallelujah
[1:07:50] arizona
[1:07:51] maricopa valley a city called phoenix
[1:07:53] there was something broke out dear until
[1:07:56] the seven thunders of revelation 10
[1:07:58] that's not even a road is being
[1:08:00] manifested aha so now we talk about
[1:08:04] thunders being manifested
[1:08:07] no not talked
[1:08:16] hearing more teachings and hearing more
[1:08:18] teachers you cannot tell me we have 40
[1:08:20] more years of mother teaching
[1:08:22] people
[1:08:51] you know i like how those brothers used
[1:08:52] to pray they don't usually say uh i say
[1:08:56] to the lord god i'm gonna say the god of
[1:08:57] hebrews
[1:09:17] hallelujah
[1:09:26] hallelujah
[1:09:37] remember
[1:09:38] this whole prophetic vision
[1:09:40] was to set us up for the intelligence
[1:09:42] the dynamics even the voice of the
[1:09:44] archangel
[1:09:46] which is the second form
[1:09:49] the voice appearing the trump the coming
[1:09:51] of the lord so jesus filled himself with
[1:09:54] him
[1:09:55] to identify the shout out jesus is going
[1:09:58] to feel himself
[1:10:02] jesus will feel himself in that bride
[1:10:04] amen is not right so christ
[1:10:07] seven living voices must come into the
[1:10:10] bride
[1:10:11] to manifest the voice of the archangels
[1:10:17] this sign of this voice shall face
[1:10:19] appear in ephesians 4
[1:10:22] the word a fightful ministry amen and
[1:10:25] the fight for ministry will it become
[1:10:27] the world itself
[1:10:42] that's right
[1:10:54] uh in these offices we have to seek
[1:10:56] christ
[1:10:58] let the men see christ
[1:11:00] and if we're not seeing christ that's
[1:11:01] not hypothesis
[1:11:03] that's a fall but not part of the fight
[1:11:08] you have to see christ
[1:11:24] europe africa south america west indies
[1:11:27] america
[1:11:29] there is nobody has that ministry
[1:11:32] presently
[1:11:33] so we have nothing to follow anybody
[1:11:35] that's right they could scream
[1:11:53] a demonstration that you said
[1:11:56] may have rest in the power
[1:11:59] of the power of god
[1:12:01] oh hallelujah
[1:12:03] that is the gospel
[1:12:05] that is the good news
[1:12:07] that that man is energized
[1:12:10] are you with me
[1:12:12] so therefore the fightful ministry will
[1:12:14] become the very word
[1:12:16] and the word is a conductor of the
[1:12:17] spirit
[1:12:18] are you with me
[1:12:20] so i told them
[1:12:35] it was cut up so the current couldn't
[1:12:37] flow so first he had to restore the
[1:12:39] broken path he had to restore the loose
[1:12:42] ends you have to store all the truths
[1:12:44] that need to be cleared up
[1:12:46] and when he restored it there was
[1:12:47] current in the lane
[1:12:58] hallelujah
[1:13:07] [Music]
[1:13:30] but there's a will of god that he was
[1:13:32] totally connected with even outside that
[1:13:35] will there was problems
[1:13:36] there was always men trying to pull him
[1:13:38] here and pulling me and convinced here
[1:13:39] almost like if he could manufacture the
[1:13:41] vision the vision came from god that's
[1:13:43] right
[1:13:44] can't
[1:14:13] this is what we have got to hear
[1:14:17] you know what could it be
[1:14:22] could it be soon
[1:14:24] practically so i think i would like to
[1:14:27] see it so yeah you could like it you
[1:14:28] could like it unlike it i have nothing
[1:14:31] to do with what god we want to share the
[1:14:32] lord
[1:14:34] hallelujah
[1:14:42] the lord amen
[1:14:43] so therefore the fightful ministry will
[1:14:45] become
[1:14:47] the conductor of the spirit
[1:14:49] in which the truth will be spoken
[1:14:52] and the spirit gonna flow freely and you
[1:14:54] will see it emanating out of them even
[1:14:57] the spirit of christ
[1:14:59] this ephesians 4 ministry will bring the
[1:15:02] bride to perfection because the bride
[1:15:04] must come to perfection the virtue is
[1:15:06] going to be poured into the bride and it
[1:15:08] cannot be ported
[1:15:22] he said such as i have i could release
[1:15:25] i could give
[1:15:26] hallelujah
[1:15:28] notice the man did not ask peter to be
[1:15:30] healed
[1:15:31] he doesn't rise up
[1:15:48] [Applause]
[1:15:59] praise the lord
[1:16:18] oh
[1:16:47] see yes i see the eyes
[1:17:11] oh my gosh
[1:17:40] [Applause]
[1:17:42] she had something the virgins did not
[1:17:45] hurt
[1:17:46] [Applause]
[1:17:47] yeah yeah they had a testimony they
[1:17:49] never fooled her wrong they never did
[1:17:51] this but she had a testimony
[1:18:24] young
[1:19:06] is
[1:19:13] that's what life is like
[1:19:15] you've got to accomplish things
[1:19:29] is
[1:20:52] is
[1:21:13] as we get narrower to home ground it's
[1:21:16] supposed to be clearer
[1:21:17] and clearer
[1:21:18] not confused
[1:21:20] and confused
[1:21:22] no it must be no questions
[1:21:25] one time they kept asking jesus why are
[1:21:28] you speaking in parables
[1:21:32] and afterwards
[1:21:34] don't speak us plainly
[1:21:36] he was bringing in my plane
[1:21:37] and playing unto them
[1:21:39] in resurrection you open the
[1:21:41] understanding and he opened the
[1:21:42] scriptures
[1:21:43] why he wanted to get clarity of purpose
[1:21:46] and vision you see because our goal is
[1:21:49] that uh i want to go to school or i want
[1:21:51] to get a subject or i want to get a car
[1:21:53] no a goal means i
[1:22:22] that's my goal and the few people have
[1:22:24] really achieved the few people who could
[1:22:26] write right where they want to go
[1:22:29] that's why god root
[1:22:33] we haven't got down to god's goal yet
[1:22:35] you know we're just talking about your
[1:22:36] own answers
[1:22:52] listen it was so rough in his mind he
[1:22:54] had to put your name in blood and splash
[1:22:56] some blood on him because the devil is
[1:22:57] going to see all except those whose
[1:22:59] names are written in the last book of
[1:23:00] life so in the vision of writing your
[1:23:02] name you put your name and put blood on
[1:23:03] it the devil's
[1:23:05] [Applause]
[1:23:14] so when you come to church you come to
[1:23:15] see if your name is there
[1:23:18] you come to hear if your name is being
[1:23:20] called
[1:23:21] and when the world is preached your name
[1:23:23] is foolish
[1:23:28] you've got to hear your name
[1:23:31] and if you hear your name you'll be him
[1:23:32] like job
[1:23:38] [Applause]
[1:23:39] what do you mean preacher i mean you're
[1:23:41] one in a million
[1:23:44] more than a million
[1:23:49] my god if i have to die in the morning

[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:14] to the overcomers
[1:24:16] as the ministry of the morning
[1:24:18] to announce the coming sun
[1:24:21] notice gods and wise men
[1:24:24] to give testimony witness that christ
[1:24:26] was born
[1:24:27] wise men
[1:24:41] and these men traveled for two years as
[1:24:43] a rebuke to the blindness
[1:24:46] of the present tense manifestation of
[1:24:48] gods
[1:25:07] they want a quote
[1:25:08] they want something because they
[1:25:09] recognize
[1:25:21] is
[1:26:05] that's yours
[1:26:16] is
[1:26:32] it's a vision of perfection that does
[1:26:34] not cater for the humanistic realm
[1:26:37] it is only for divine revelation
[1:26:39] and vision the humanistic realm is where
[1:26:41] the intellectual faith is at the mind
[1:26:43] games the church politics 201
[1:27:17] new name is a reward
[1:27:23] you can't achieve you mean
[1:27:25] women can be a goal that's right three
[1:27:27] or four is a reward
[1:27:29] i promise rather than
[1:27:36] [Music]
[1:27:44] qualified to be his wife amen but there
[1:27:46] are goals that you can achieve
[1:27:48] always goes to be on fire i try go and
[1:27:50] suppress the battle lord god that you
[1:27:52] could pray every day
[1:27:54] you could bring your bible
[1:27:56] that you could stop being so normal
[1:28:07] hallelujah
[1:28:26] because god said don't cut that you'll
[1:28:28] be fine all right so he's doing other
[1:28:29] stuff
[1:28:30] not out of the program of god but the
[1:28:33] power is still there because the
[1:28:34] covenant is with the gear that's right
[1:28:36] just that seven rocks as long as it's
[1:28:37] not cut you'll find assassin's creed to
[1:28:40] the edge
[1:28:53] [Music]
[1:28:55] down here and he shake himself one more
[1:28:57] time recognize samson
[1:29:00] you're just like another man
[1:29:02] somebody said this is normal yeah
[1:29:05] you mean all of what i had was a
[1:29:09] got power because woman was obeying god
[1:29:11] that's what i'm saying people take
[1:29:12] siblings of god for granted that if god
[1:29:15] is with them i have a quote but says god
[1:29:17] will bless a man stand up very good
[1:29:19] either for other men and what takes him
[1:29:21] out of pastor
[1:29:36] we have not
[1:29:51] [Music]
[1:30:04] saw a man
[1:30:06] standing looking at him he's just saying
[1:30:08] when you borrow his i want to pray for
[1:30:10] you
[1:30:11] you might have to keep watching the
[1:30:12] ground
[1:30:13] but until the child is saying lord god
[1:30:15] don't let that man attitude stop this
[1:30:18] from moving that
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:30] he's a good man
[1:30:31] he's a nice man
[1:30:33] he doesn't take birth
[1:30:55] is
[1:31:14] oh
[1:31:20] in my heart
[1:31:21] i am trusting that god
[1:31:42] they know you're convinced of that
[1:31:44] because you're convinced of that you
[1:31:46] cannot put any man words
[1:31:50] hallelujah
[1:31:51] because
[1:31:53] is the final arbitrator why because the
[1:31:55] word comes to a prophet
[1:32:08] [Applause]
[1:32:11] that was echoed in new york city that's
[1:32:13] right that's the message that brother
[1:32:16] coleman preached that's right he didn't
[1:32:18] preach a different message he preached
[1:32:20] brother branham's message
[1:32:27] [Applause]
[1:32:52] about himself that's right his family
[1:32:55] and his church is not the same that's
[1:32:58] why if you put it all together you'll
[1:32:59] get a lot of problems right
[1:33:02] divide it you'll have no problems
[1:33:04] with every man have a right to his own
[1:33:06] inspiration and he said when i'm here
[1:33:08] i'll do this i'll do that that is his
[1:33:10] own inspiration
[1:33:14] i predict that he will come by 1977
[1:33:16] that's one of my own inspiration he said
[1:33:18] that's not just the world every one of
[1:33:20] us have a right to have our own
[1:33:22] inspiration about things it's not safe
[1:33:24] and it's not the terrible it's just your
[1:33:26] own inspiration about something yes yeah
[1:33:29] it may come to pass it will come to pass
[1:33:31] but he echoed
[1:33:32] his message
[1:33:34] he echoed it with clarity
[1:33:36] with vision
[1:33:38] and that is what why i am here tonight
[1:33:41] because of that echo i'll try if he
[1:33:44] didn't care about the fightful ministry
[1:33:47] i was going to be fooled also
[1:33:50] but he said that the fightful ministry
[1:33:53] must come through those seven books
[1:33:54] that's right
[1:33:55] and they must be tested and proven and
[1:33:57] tried
[1:33:59] dynamics have to come and adopt them
[1:34:01] and place positionally in the ephesians
[1:34:03] ministries
[1:34:07] hallelujah
[1:34:08] that is what was good
[1:34:10] [Applause]
[1:34:11] this is no
[1:34:12] oh my god
[1:34:14] amen in other words but a cold man as
[1:34:17] well
[1:34:18] there is no vacancy
[1:34:19] to replace him
[1:34:23] so anybody apply
[1:34:25] to replace a possibility
[1:34:28] application form
[1:34:42] that purpose is over now god wants to do
[1:34:44] something else because the land has to
[1:34:46] be divided
[1:34:48] and it cannot be divided as a bunch of
[1:34:50] groups
[1:34:56] here
[1:34:57] this one do this here
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:12] glory to god in other words you're not
[1:35:14] going with the tide you're not going
[1:35:15] with the flow you're not going with
[1:35:17] everybody going that way one time 400
[1:35:20] prophets were saying the same thing yeah
[1:35:40] listen to this the echo ministry can
[1:35:42] only echo by having a revelation of the
[1:35:44] son of man the new man
[1:35:45] your personal ministry placed my new god
[1:35:47] by god in new york fulfilled his
[1:35:50] commission to hear out
[1:35:52] and cut the blind promises
[1:35:55] and make more sense to what the prophet
[1:35:57] spoke
[1:35:58] this was done
[1:35:59] by bringing all the promise into a
[1:36:02] prophetic vision of perfection through
[1:36:04] seventh under buildings
[1:36:06] wow in the place of time
[1:36:08] into seasonal production into proving
[1:36:11] these virtues and us would you fill in
[1:36:14] the power being released vindicated to
[1:36:16] the ministry of christ
[1:36:18] in other words
[1:36:19] it is impossible for anybody to claim
[1:36:22] having a ministry of jesus christ and
[1:36:24] all power through him now
[1:36:26] that's right
[1:36:28] when the woman touched jesus he said he
[1:36:30] said the power left me that's right
[1:36:32] that's christ that's right that's christ
[1:36:34] that's right
[1:36:35] not a mystery about my mouth
[1:36:50] dynamics is
[1:37:18] that's different
[1:37:50] [Applause]
[1:38:01] 1974 put it all together as a vision the
[1:38:04] bride's
[1:38:05] only goal right but i'm saying one quote
[1:38:08] he says the church is so powerless the
[1:38:10] only weapon they have is arguments
[1:38:12] it's terrible
[1:38:14] and you come down
[1:38:19] the spirit of truth directs us to the
[1:38:22] word that explains why all the misses
[1:38:24] have been known to the ages because the
[1:38:26] siege was not yet open
[1:38:28] so whatever
[1:38:38] and everything else is
[1:38:41] settled again he winds up the loose ends
[1:38:46] that these fellow proved acts
[1:38:48] and the mysteries come down from god as
[1:38:51] the will of god
[1:38:53] and reveals the entire
[1:38:55] revelation of god then the godhead and
[1:38:59] everything else is settled right so the
[1:39:01] godhead was settled
[1:39:03] so i don't understand how anyone become
[1:39:06] an unsettling godhead
[1:39:08] that's the only way
[1:39:10] i can say it
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:24] being spoken
[1:39:25] about
[1:39:26] the godhead let us make mind that the
[1:39:28] god will complete
[1:39:30] we always taught that is god a deal and
[1:39:33] we are man down here but we are going to
[1:39:35] find out that man is
[1:39:53] is the bride you are the holy spirit
[1:39:57] i am not talking to your human spirit no
[1:40:00] that will be destroyed now that you know
[1:40:03] that you are the holy spirit
[1:40:05] you say the name
[1:40:35] i want to let you know that this teacher
[1:40:37] that is not right now is false
[1:40:40] is controlled and annoys it it is
[1:40:42] contrary to what but one
[1:40:45] brought amen in this message
[1:40:48] is
[1:41:03] up when you're going to thinking about
[1:41:04] it and make three different individuals
[1:41:06] some make it one day but wrong noted
[1:41:08] this is not three gods so therefore it
[1:41:11] is not
[1:41:12] you cannot have a person without a
[1:41:13] personality right the black cat would be
[1:41:15] taking a trinity without having a
[1:41:17] personality isn't that right but obama
[1:41:19] said it is tree manifestation of the
[1:41:22] same god it's the attributes of god god
[1:41:25] the father that was in the wilderness
[1:41:26] and fulfill the fire and in that same
[1:41:28] god express himself in his son which was
[1:41:32] the same god not three gods three
[1:41:34] manifestations of the same god so many
[1:41:37] of you came down the holy ghost and see
[1:41:39] the second person of the trinity but
[1:41:40] it's not even mentioned in the bible
[1:41:42] there was no such a thing the word
[1:41:43] trinity is not even with the lids of the
[1:41:45] bible and when you look at jesus you
[1:41:47] regard him as the truth no the second
[1:41:49] opportunity that
[1:41:50] and that's the reason you get nowhere oh
[1:41:53] praising it now people act
[1:41:56] that god is obligated to meet them on
[1:41:58] the basis of their theology now people
[1:42:00] act like that they won't associate even
[1:42:03] with each other the trinity or pentecost
[1:42:05] not associated with oneness and so on
[1:42:07] there is no fellowship at all and they
[1:42:09] wind the people's minds around so bad
[1:42:11] that they're even against one another
[1:42:14] that's right and numbers 23 19 says god
[1:42:18] is not a man that he
[1:42:20] will deny
[1:42:21] oh do you love him tonight
[1:42:25] blessed be the name of the lord harlem
[1:42:28] we are praised god
[1:42:30] and brother and the bible says isaiah 44
[1:42:33] 6 does say the lord the king of israel
[1:42:34] and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am
[1:42:36] the first and the last beside me there
[1:42:38] is no god amen isaiah 45 i am lord there
[1:42:41] is no earth there is no god beside me i
[1:42:43] greedy
[1:42:44] has not known me that they may know from
[1:42:46] the rising of the sun from the west that
[1:42:48] there is none beside me i am the lord
[1:42:50] and there is none else
[1:42:52] now there is something called the new
[1:42:53] age movement
[1:42:55] and a woman named shirley mclean wrote a
[1:42:57] book all out in the limb in which he
[1:42:59] says all power and knowledge and truth
[1:43:02] are within us and waiting to be unlocked
[1:43:05] we are gods and might as well get good
[1:43:07] at it i am god
[1:43:09] shirley mclean
[1:43:11] and the few aspects of the new age have
[1:43:13] shocked traditional religious people
[1:43:15] with her iron god uh exclamations but
[1:43:18] this what i'm hearing now belongs to the
[1:43:21] new age movement he's got a new
[1:43:23] revelation or a new mystery this is
[1:43:25] actually a new age i am god contain a
[1:43:28] whole metaphysics in a nutshell it's a
[1:43:30] whole it contains all the parts okay
[1:43:34] now i am god belief is directly derived
[1:43:37] from a man called something jean knight
[1:43:40] ramta ramta
[1:43:42] is convinced his audience that each one
[1:43:43] of them is gone i think this is a hindu
[1:43:46] guy
[1:43:47] see what it is about hindu guy could you
[1:43:49] just wait one second please place
[1:44:00] hallelujah
[1:44:08] he said if you want to see what god
[1:44:10] looks like go look in a reflector you're
[1:44:13] looking god straight in the face
[1:44:15] watch
[1:44:17] um
[1:44:18] age is often a film that all is god
[1:44:21] hence all is good
[1:44:22] evil is usually tied to ignorance and a
[1:44:25] lack of enlightenment
[1:44:27] so um from a new age perspective you
[1:44:30] begin to have an illusion that you are
[1:44:31] limited
[1:44:32] you begin
[1:44:36] that you have an illusion that you are
[1:44:38] limited and finite
[1:44:39] a new angel will tell you that you are
[1:44:42] separated from god only in your
[1:44:44] consciousness
[1:44:45] you need to be enlightened
[1:44:48] you have forgotten your true identity
[1:44:51] you are a victim of a false sense of a
[1:44:53] separate identity which blinds you from
[1:44:56] your essential unity
[1:44:59] with god
[1:45:01] and this is the cause of all the
[1:45:03] problems
[1:45:05] so therefore you are god
[1:45:06] that is the same lie
[1:45:08] that satan told me oh yeah if you eat up
[1:45:11] this tree
[1:45:18] isn't that right so then in a book she
[1:45:21] said i am god i am god i know that i
[1:45:25] exist therefore i am
[1:45:27] and since i am part part of the force
[1:45:30] then i am that i am
[1:45:32] wow
[1:45:35] that i am this is new image
[1:45:38] isn't that right
[1:45:39] now in the new old in the old testament
[1:45:42] it was blasphemy to say that you were
[1:45:43] gone
[1:45:45] that is why they took stone to stone
[1:45:46] jesus because if you are god that's
[1:45:49] right
[1:45:50] if you can prove it
[1:45:53] but as long as you can prove it stones
[1:45:56] yes
[1:45:57] so he said he said he is the son of god
[1:46:00] and to say you are the son that means
[1:46:01] you were god this serious blasphemy and
[1:46:04] it was
[1:46:05] but jesus was god
[1:46:09] so it was not
[1:46:10] blasphemy oh hallelujah oh praise the
[1:46:14] name of the lord are you with me
[1:46:15] praise god
[1:46:17] so this uh ladies her name is william
[1:46:20] benzenzano
[1:46:22] she said shelby mcqueen was right i am
[1:46:24] god this is the article
[1:46:27] for 25 years she was struggling with
[1:46:28] that book
[1:46:30] and i'm going to summarize it
[1:46:32] this woman she went 1987 to a christian
[1:46:34] retreat
[1:46:35] and the pastor was preaching i was
[1:46:37] telling them don't read that book
[1:46:40] but she wanted to read the book
[1:46:43] when she read the book she get connected
[1:46:45] with it and so on so listen to this part
[1:46:48] he said so so mclean work has inspired
[1:46:51] me
[1:46:52] and i've got over the conflict
[1:46:55] with my church membership i have grown
[1:46:58] beyond a message for over the years and
[1:47:00] um i know a lot of
[1:47:02] our spiritual adventures now i believe
[1:47:03] that i will help prepare people to
[1:47:05] accept a more advanced message i bring
[1:47:07] into a higher purpose to help them bring
[1:47:09] them to the part of life
[1:47:12] so let's just say
[1:47:13] now this is the path that is
[1:47:15] that is really
[1:47:16] nerve-racking to me
[1:47:18] these statements are
[1:47:20] best perhaps only be understood from a
[1:47:24] mystical viewpoint part of my mission is
[1:47:25] to help them understand take me
[1:47:27] literally i am god seems blasphemous i
[1:47:29] remember misled perhaps i am one with
[1:47:31] god might be more acceptable but mystics
[1:47:33] and philosophers uh to the current ken
[1:47:36] wilber
[1:47:37] confirm their view of the stronger
[1:47:39] statement
[1:47:40] they confirm in
[1:47:42] one confirming man
[1:47:43] that they are god yeah
[1:47:45] so okay
[1:47:48] so i'm gonna skip
[1:47:56] just giving us
[1:48:05] oh
[1:48:07] glory glory hallelujah
[1:48:27] she said it will compare to the
[1:48:28] christian experience of being forgiven
[1:48:30] of
[1:49:02] and i mean that with all my heart
[1:49:05] oh glory hallelujah you see i believe it
[1:49:08] but the comment had lived on long enough
[1:49:10] he was going to correct a lot of stuff
[1:49:12] that
[1:49:23] i wouldn't go any further with that but
[1:49:24] that is what i have to see considering
[1:49:26] that by the grace of god blessed be the
[1:49:28] name of the lord
[1:49:29] oh hallelujah
[1:49:31] o glory to god
[1:49:33] amen praise god so listen even though
[1:49:37] god promised after 400 years he would
[1:49:39] bring his people out with a mighty hand
[1:49:52] after promise after promise but god had
[1:49:54] to wait
[1:50:06] if we have to get dynamics to be a
[1:50:08] people
[1:50:16] so faith not as a description of a
[1:50:18] belief this is my feet that is my feet
[1:50:22] because
[1:50:49] what is that
[1:50:51] are you a christian
[1:50:53] it means do you have a life that's right
[1:50:55] do you have something that god could
[1:50:57] recognize
[1:50:59] to be of him amen oh glory i want to be
[1:51:02] a christian
[1:51:09] if i have to sit down and start
[1:51:11] preaching i will still be a christian i
[1:51:13] don't need to be behind this pulpit to
[1:51:15] be a christian
[1:51:17] i christian because i love the lord and
[1:51:19] i know you love the lord
[1:51:21] i love him
[1:51:24] and i still love him
[1:51:25] and with the preacher i still love him
[1:51:27] and if i don't have to preach i will
[1:51:28] still love him
[1:51:46] hallelujah
[1:51:54] abraham left this country so faith is
[1:51:57] active faith is an action created by the
[1:52:00] confession of a belief taking another
[1:52:01] paper testimony i believe this make it
[1:52:04] on paper that's not faith save had
[1:52:06] action with it abraham left this country
[1:52:08] noah built an act isn't that right there
[1:52:11] is an action not an understanding of
[1:52:14] revelation only but faith is a channel
[1:52:16] that produces action perfect by faith
[1:52:20] is not the destination
[1:52:22] oh hallelujah
[1:52:24] hate is the seed and jesus is the
[1:52:26] conversation he's coming for the fruits
[1:52:35] [Applause]
[1:52:40] all this mystery mystery comes down as
[1:52:43] the word and the word is the seed but
[1:52:45] jesus has not called for seed
[1:52:48] he's coming for fruit
[1:52:54] what does that mean i mean the seed goes
[1:52:57] through processes in your life i begin
[1:53:00] to conclude
[1:53:01] that the sea is what you have received
[1:53:03] all these years but he got come back to
[1:53:05] hear what you have read
[1:53:07] did you hear this book did you read this
[1:53:09] book did you get this mystery did you
[1:53:11] get this mystery no
[1:53:12] it has to be christ in you
[1:53:20] man
[1:53:21] who is christ christ is the mission of
[1:53:23] god
[1:53:24] revealed i'm not even talking about a
[1:53:26] book i'm talking about that man with the
[1:53:28] beard that man that walked in jerusalem
[1:53:30] that man was god expressed
[1:53:32] that man was god revealed that was the
[1:53:35] word
[1:53:38] but that same word is what the son of
[1:53:40] man revealed
[1:53:41] oh hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:53:46] so therefore the fruit is the
[1:53:47] destination
[1:53:49] the harvest yeah even the rest even
[1:53:52] charity a labor to enter into the rest
[1:53:55] it is descriptive correctly description
[1:53:58] to the uh as to the action necessary in
[1:54:01] order to achieve the coming to the rest
[1:54:03] ah leave at the end to israel amen
[1:54:05] that's a beautiful description always
[1:54:07] describe the wars in the land but the
[1:54:10] land is the land where you'll get rest
[1:54:11] you'll leave up and enter into the rest
[1:54:13] that's right if not right so malakai
[1:54:15] they do two things turn our
[1:54:17] hearts back to the children and turn our
[1:54:19] hearts back to the feet of the father
[1:54:20] isn't that right isn't that right
[1:54:23] oh glory now when the context of this
[1:54:25] destination is back to the faith and
[1:54:28] there is only one lord
[1:54:30] one faith one baptism another ephesians
[1:54:33] defeat
[1:54:35] god's fate even christ in you the hope
[1:54:37] of glory all right so when christ is
[1:54:39] formed the new hope of glory that's the
[1:54:40] fate that's right that's the thing that
[1:54:42] says pick up your blood and walk that's
[1:54:44] the faith and say go and sin no more
[1:54:46] that's the faith says amen before the
[1:54:48] doctrine touches my wife the jewel will
[1:54:50] go down that's the fate that was christ
[1:54:52] in the prophet that will be christ
[1:54:54] inside of you just a little more amen
[1:54:56] praise god hallelujah because you must
[1:54:59] be the word manifested to be the bride
[1:55:02] preach your message 21st of
[1:55:04] september and i didn't even get to read
[1:55:06] a quote but i want to read it here
[1:55:07] praise the lord but obama invisible
[1:55:10] bride he said and the bride is always
[1:55:12] part of the bridegroom so the bride will
[1:55:14] not be a denomination it would have to
[1:55:16] be the word manifested to be the bride
[1:55:20] of christ
[1:55:21] right now there is no word manifested
[1:55:23] yet
[1:55:24] people only talk in word the bride will
[1:55:27] have to be the word manifested behold i
[1:55:30] show you the
[1:55:42] will not be manhandled
[1:55:44] so god
[1:55:58] do you understand the lord himself the
[1:56:00] same with a shout to get this right out
[1:56:04] that shout but around you labored to
[1:56:06] bring a shock message look how long he
[1:56:08] died in 1965
[1:56:10] wasn't even born yet but god brought
[1:56:39] [Music]
[1:57:26] me personally i reject my intervention
[1:57:29] trying to help god
[1:57:30] from that standpoint that's right
[1:57:32] if we could get started go and do the
[1:57:34] rest as it gets started getting the
[1:57:36] mechanics right getting your hearts
[1:57:37] right you could do that no business that
[1:57:40] could work for you you could do that
[1:57:42] love your husband save your children
[1:57:44] amen love your wife and so on do what is
[1:57:46] right do what is christian
[1:57:49] do what is in order you do that and god
[1:57:52] will bless you
[1:57:53] oh hallelujah
[1:57:57] and don't be afraid of mystics
[1:58:00] you have never been here before
[1:58:15] my god
[1:58:30] is
[1:59:07] yes
[1:59:29] joshua send me spice and when they got a
[1:59:31] report they see them people training
[1:59:32] behind that wall the walls
[1:59:55] people wanted
[2:00:10] because
[2:00:15] hallelujah so the manifestation of the
[2:00:17] holy spirit is the seed of the kingdom
[2:00:20] so the bride will now be handled my hand
[2:00:21] is that right so the bride will not come
[2:00:24] on the number six man or man's spirit
[2:00:27] will not be able to control manipulate
[2:00:30] or incorrectly influence the land's life
[2:00:33] right when brother branham said people
[2:00:35] are right he said no one can make them
[2:00:37] do
[2:00:39] no otherwise can make them do otherwise
[2:00:41] they have dusted the lord or they keep
[2:00:43] still
[2:00:44] notice they don't have an interpretation
[2:00:46] they don't have some man's idea they
[2:00:48] have just said the law now the bride is
[2:00:50] not a prophet
[2:00:52] so therefore the pride is seeing what
[2:00:54] the prophet brought
[2:00:55] because the spirit the brain and the
[2:00:57] prophet says the same thing that's right
[2:00:58] so the bride will have thus shared the
[2:01:00] lord and what she speaks will have
[2:01:02] already been spoken in the world that's
[2:01:04] right she's not speaking new revelations
[2:01:06] it's the same revelation with faith and
[2:01:08] power behind it
[2:01:10] hallelujah hallelujah the prophetess who
[2:01:13] brought the lord
[2:01:15] william branham was the most vindicated
[2:01:16] prophet ever he had the same lord his
[2:01:19] name and he put it on books and tapes
[2:01:21] has revealed the promises of the land
[2:01:23] the new land isn't that right lord jesus
[2:01:27] i promise you build us
[2:01:29] let's just hear you know
[2:01:31] jesus come in three names
[2:01:33] something son of man son of god son of
[2:01:37] david son of david is in the millennium
[2:01:40] you leave that name out okay now son of
[2:01:43] man is jesus flesh
[2:01:45] producing seed
[2:01:47] so he said son of man is the sower of
[2:01:49] the seed
[2:01:51] now watch son of god is spirit
[2:01:54] but i said god changing his mask
[2:01:57] in other words seven manifestation of
[2:01:59] the holy spirit is the spirit
[2:02:01] is the son
[2:02:02] isn't that right but when you're a son
[2:02:04] of man he's coming with seed
[2:02:06] which is word which is logos isn't that
[2:02:09] right now when every age once the enemy
[2:02:12] releases a power
[2:02:14] god releases another power to combat the
[2:02:16] enemy
[2:02:17] a man a eagle a lion every age once the
[2:02:21] enemy comes forth with something there's
[2:02:23] all the power raise up to challenge what
[2:02:25] the enemy pollutes
[2:02:27] isn't that right whether it's false
[2:02:29] teaching force manifestation or
[2:02:31] interpretation god reason of power he's
[2:02:32] not right when the enemy coming like a
[2:02:34] flood the supreme standard here's where
[2:02:36] i want to go number one son of man word
[2:02:39] seed
[2:02:40] son of god through the seven ages so son
[2:02:42] of god follows son of man
[2:02:57] seven church ages son of god with the
[2:02:59] problem
[2:03:04] so he come back with food again what's
[2:03:06] the following
[2:03:08] son of god
[2:03:12] oh give us the praise
[2:03:14] hallelujah
[2:03:15] hallelujah all right so the question is
[2:03:18] tonight
[2:03:19] what is the fallout son of man
[2:03:22] messes the promises i see tonight is the
[2:03:25] son of god spirit dynamics come to the
