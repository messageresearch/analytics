With thanksgiving, I'll be a living sanctuary for you. He has no hands but your hands. No mouth but your mouth. You have the youth. Amen. God bless you. If have your Bibles, I like you to turn to Psalms 63. You want to read 1:3 and Matthew 5 1 verse verse 6. Psalms 63. Read it from verse one. Oh God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee. My soul thirsteth for thee. My flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy glory. So as I have seen thee in the sanctuary, because thy loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee. Matthew 5:6 reads, "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled." May God bless his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have a title, a message, thirsting for life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the title. Thirsting &gt;&gt; for life. &gt;&gt; I know you know that God put a thirst in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. a thirst &gt;&gt; and they know the devil job is to try to cover that thirst with channel it in other areas &gt;&gt; but there's a genuine thirst that God put in his heart &gt;&gt; in his people &gt;&gt; listen to these words God created a man to have a thirst &gt;&gt; your makeup you were made to thirst &gt;&gt; God made you that way you cannot help it because you thirst God made you do it but God made you to thirst after him &gt;&gt; so This thirst is built in. &gt;&gt; This thirst is inside of you. &gt;&gt; Some challenge it in football, in sports, some challenge with sex, sometimes with woman, with money, with drink, but is a thirst. &gt;&gt; But that thirst that deep inside of you, looking for fulfillment, &gt;&gt; looking for completion, looking for, amen, a better life. &gt;&gt; If God put that inside of you, &gt;&gt; but the Bible said thy loving kindness &gt;&gt; is better than life. That means it have more than what we interpret as life. &gt;&gt; Some people interpret life as a house, a car, a land, a husband, a wife, children, family, whatever it is. They interpret life in all different kind of ways. But there is a real life. &gt;&gt; The Bible said in the beginning was the word. &gt;&gt; The word was with God and the word was God and the word became flesh. In him was life &gt;&gt; and the life was the light of men. So God put the life in the word and put the word as a seed and put the seed inside of you. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Did you get that now? &gt;&gt; Praise God. So God put the word life inside the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He put the word as a seed &gt;&gt; and put that seed inside of you &gt;&gt; and put a thirst inside of you. &gt;&gt; That from the seed inside of you, &gt;&gt; you are thirsting for life. And for us who have received a seventh thunder revelation but give us faith &gt;&gt; that faith in us is testing &gt;&gt; for the life &gt;&gt; of second Peter 1 4-7. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not a life that you seen on a board faith and virtue knowledge but the actual life itself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandon talk about the tress of spirit &gt;&gt; the fountain of love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. blue and all these colors, perfect colors. The color of redemption, it was perfect and it has come under the earth it get perverted the colors. But on your beginning or before the beginning, these were the original. &gt;&gt; This is where you come from. &gt;&gt; This is where your dream come from. This is where your thought come from. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. This is where he wrote the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; and put you in that book &gt;&gt; as a name. Hallelujah. as a gene, as a germ, as a seed in the lamb's book of life. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. And you bypass your theophony. You bypass your work body to come on the earth to be tempted and tested. But there is something in you thirsting to get back where you were before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In him was life and the life was the light. So God found a prophet. Oh, glory to God. By which he could walk through. His name is William Brham. And through that prophet, he released the light in the form of the word, even the evening light. And in that light is what we walking in tonight. Give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So Jesus said this, this was such something for me to say it. Jesus said, "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness." There's not some pastor say that. There's not an evangelist that say that. This is Jesus said that. Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled. &gt;&gt; That's my inspiration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For they shall be filled. &gt;&gt; What he means by that I receive the word and the word the word in me. Thy filling &gt;&gt; they shall be what? &gt;&gt; Shout out filled. &gt;&gt; Filled with something. &gt;&gt; You could be filled with foolishness. You could be filled with unbelief. You can be filled with intellectualism. You could be filled with your own thoughts and ideas or you could be filled with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you shall be filled. &gt;&gt; If you do what? Hunger and thirst after righteousness. &gt;&gt; That's a separating thing all together. &gt;&gt; It people live their life dead and gone. They have money and what not. They sick and they're dead and gone. &gt;&gt; And that's it. They go to hell too. &gt;&gt; That's not what God calling you for. &gt;&gt; Some people blow their brains out. They can't stand life no more. They commit suicide. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Say there is something more than this life &gt;&gt; because this life is not what you think it to be. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a perverted life. &gt;&gt; Brother, he said now watch. Jesus said, "Blessed are they that hung and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled." &gt;&gt; It's a blessing to even thirst. &gt;&gt; So if you're thirsting tonight, you are blessed already. &gt;&gt; You could just thank God and shout. You could praise God. &gt;&gt; No wonder why your people quiet in the message. &gt;&gt; They're not blessed to be thirsting. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Blessed if you thirst. Blessed are you that hunger just to just to be hungering tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I come here hungry, you know. Praise God. I almost for announcement, you know. Come with your cup empty. Come on expectation. Come for your filling. Come for your refilling. Come for your miracle. Hallelujah. Come for your healing. Oh, glory to God. Maybe I should have put it out, but it's already out already. When you come, you're coming for the healing. You're coming for your breakthrough. You're coming for victory. You're coming for deliverance. You're coming to go back home. Give the Lord a shout and be the same way. You're coming to be changed and transformed by the renewing of your mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Reframe your mind &gt;&gt; and everything changes around you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; My my my brother Brandham says, watch. It's a blessing to even thirst. But the devil has tried to make you think of something else. But the thirst was given to you by God. &gt;&gt; Listen, how dare you take that blessed holy thirst that God give you to thirst after him and try to satisfy it with the things of the world, with television programs, with drinking, with big sprees. The devil has perverted instrument of his own and taking that thirst that God gave you to thirst for him and making you thirst after the sins of the world. And every thirst that you had should be for him. I'm thirsting for God. God bless you with this. You're still thirsting. God bless you with that. You're still thirsting. You can get money, house, car, land, husband, wife, children. God bless you, but you're still thirsting. David a king David bless. Oh God, he said my heart thirst longing. Another scripture David says as the heart panted after the water broke, so my th soul thirst after living God. Why don't you hear people thirsting anymore? Because they are satisfied. Get tight loud this year. Rich and have need of nothing, but you need God tonight. You need life tonight. You need the anointing tonight. You need that covering. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, we have we got a time tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I didn't care if there's two people inside tonight. I was coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Numbers don't bother me or intimidate me. We were two three people in Kaiwa. Praise God. be we over be overloaded tonight. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. It's it's it's breaking out in multitudes tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have a bump for you. Let me let me get it here. &gt;&gt; Every one of you, my Catholic friends in here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, we call them rebuke Roman. See, my Catholic friends, &gt;&gt; every one of my Protestant friends, &gt;&gt; I just love every one of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we Could we Could we have this boy? &gt;&gt; You hear this man talking? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love every one of you. &gt;&gt; God knows whether that's true or not. &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm not playing words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not playing this verbal gymnastics. I'm not playing this intellectual wordify game, this message game. I'm not playing that. &gt;&gt; God knows whether that's true or not. Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch the prayer line. When the blind and lame, it doesn't say Catholic. &gt;&gt; Here sets some man on the platform, a Catholic dying with cancer, eat up. He come to my house and the Holy Spirit come upon him and heal him of that cancer. &gt;&gt; Amen. He never told him whether he was Catholic or not. &gt;&gt; I never said a word to him. He come over and was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And received the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There sets the man right there. &gt;&gt; A businessman in Louisville. He goes down further. He don't ask whether you are Catholic or not. &gt;&gt; It is whether your heart is hungering after God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see how far the message world is &gt;&gt; from the principles that the prophet brought. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let it go. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled. Is that right? &gt;&gt; The man is a Catholic and a man get healed. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost come upon him. &gt;&gt; Not a man bunny ears with mysteries &gt;&gt; or bunny ears with some spokewood book or or I had to bring revelation. &gt;&gt; None of that. The Holy Ghost came upon that man &gt;&gt; and heal him. You need a message my brother fellowship. Oh up they falseus. &gt;&gt; You see the foolishness how far from God this thing is &gt;&gt; just religious &gt;&gt; enticing spirit deceiving people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; David said my soul thirst after thee. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; My soul thirsteth. &gt;&gt; Watch. My flesh longeth for thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In a dry and thirsty land where no water is listening &gt;&gt; I know I feeling take a drink you know water I sure I want to drink no not that you know he said the place dry &gt;&gt; that the level of thirsty talking about &gt;&gt; I real thirsty &gt;&gt; if everybody come to church &gt;&gt; this coming Sunday &gt;&gt; real thirsty &gt;&gt; something have to explode &gt;&gt; but people follow their thoughts &gt;&gt; follow their dreams full of the ideas, full of their own understanding. I'm here to not I'm not here to confirm your revelation. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to confirm your dream. I'm not here to confirm what you think it's supposed to be. I'm here to minister the word of God. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is receive it. &gt;&gt; If we off run for your life, but if it's the word, receive it. &gt;&gt; Believe it. &gt;&gt; Act upon it. And God to heal you, seal you, deliver you, refill you, baptize you, re restore you, redeem you. Whatever you have need of, he going to do it for you. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Bam. Say the word life has a compound meaning. It mean more than one thing. Life itself means an existence. So then if thy loving kindness is better than life, then that would what what would be any any better? Because God alone has eternal life. God alone has eternal life. He said now everything that has a beginning has an end. &gt;&gt; He had no beginning of days, no ending of years. Therefore, we have to become part of God by birth to live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And have external existence. Like we read a quote says the reason Mary had us to go into the upper room because she was born a human. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she had to be born again &gt;&gt; by the spirit &gt;&gt; in order to go to heaven. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She can't claim I'm Mary, mother of Jesus. that couldn't work. She can't pass the pie gates with that. So, she had to hit the upper room because she was born a human. So, her testimony of giving birth to the Messiah can't qualify her to enter into glory. &gt;&gt; Could you Could you could you could you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, she had to hold herself up in the upper room. Virgin Mary with Mary Magdalene, prostitute Mary. &gt;&gt; All of them had to hit it up there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For the spirit to fall upon them. &gt;&gt; You don't hear that much in the message because they don't want the spirit to fall. They want the Baptist doctrine. The message has become Baptist. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; When I believe, I have it. &gt;&gt; Well, continue to believe in the devil believe and trembling. And here I have it. &gt;&gt; So, you better go to more than believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to go to receiving. &gt;&gt; You have to go to hungering &gt;&gt; and thirsting after what? After righteousness. &gt;&gt; This take you beyond the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The church not controlling your hungering and thirsting. This this go beyond who's your pastor, what you believe, what is the teaching that goes beyond that. God know if you're hung hungering, if you're washing your wares, if you're washing your car, if you're eating, if you're drinking I know what hunger look like. I know hungering feel like are you hungering? What you hungering for? To gossip, to lie, to cheat, to whatever. What you hungering for? &gt;&gt; Keep hungry for more money. We get more money. You know what happen more money? More spend. True. &gt;&gt; The more money they get, the more money they spend. &gt;&gt; They hung up a car &gt;&gt; and have to get the car. You can't see them in service. Nobody can't take them astray. Friends, car give up friends. No sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And all these things is like the devil wearing mask, friend mask, family mask, all kind of mask. The devil behind natural because it killing your thirst. Amen. &gt;&gt; And anything that killing your thirst, that is why it's anti- good for people to not seek the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Because anytime you don't want to press into the spirit, man go catch you. The devil go catch you. He'll catch you in your mind because our intellect can defeat no devil. The intellect couldn't work. Oh, glory to God. He not have other men for the lust after. He didn't have another booze place and all kind of boos house in the garden of Eden. It was just God's word. The day you eat, that day you die, &gt;&gt; we have to come back to the word &gt;&gt; and believe just what God said. No compromise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. &gt;&gt; Sin and suffering and everything must come to a place where it has no existence. &gt;&gt; Because it had a beginning. So gray hair, old age, pain, suffering has to come to an end. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because that had a beginning. &gt;&gt; And if that have a beginning, that have an ending, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? There was a time when there was no sickness, no sin, no sorrow, no death. And then it come by perversion. So if all the perversion must end back back, it has to go a beginning, has to end, then eternal life can ever exist. Do you see what I mean? That's the reason, here we go. It is totally impossible for any person to be ever saved outside of the new birth because men are born again of the spirit of God and become part of God. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And their existence is eternal as God is eternal. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? A man could stop smoking, stop drinking, stop running a woman, stop all his bad behavior and still go to hell. &gt;&gt; Do you understand something supernatural have to take place in that man life in your life? something that your father can't give you, your mother can't give you, your husband can't give you, money can't give you, your wife can't give you, your children can't give you. It's only God could give you. Give the Lord a shout. Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; This is good. When you come to church now, you focus not on a man, not on teachings, &gt;&gt; but you focus on Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was preaching to Miami over the weekend. I was telling them that brother Brandham came to introduce Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; People seem to forget that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He came to introduce that message quarrels, church battles, church wars. That is foolishness. That is Lucifer again in behind the pulpits. &gt;&gt; He came to introduce Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God. As John the Baptist was sent, so God sent that man, &gt;&gt; William Reynold &gt;&gt; and Jesus Christ came down in Revelation 10, &gt;&gt; a mighty angel &gt;&gt; and seven thunders throw their voices out &gt;&gt; to God as a bride together &gt;&gt; to give the bright faith &gt;&gt; to show how to prepare. Seven thunders throw their voices out. He came to introduce the thunders. &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord I shout in your house. My God, this is good tonight. This going down nice. &gt;&gt; This eating good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. William Brham came to introduce the seven thunders &gt;&gt; which is Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. The eighth messenger. &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Those disciples them Greeks come over Jesus. I know disciples. Ah come here. I have a book to show you. You know you know who preaching this. You know &gt;&gt; I know the Bible say that you know they say sir we receive Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And they brought them straight to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Straight to who? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Straight to who? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Not straight as some church &gt;&gt; to the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that person tell them except a corner weight &gt;&gt; fall into the ground and die. That person glad to meet you. I am Jesus. No. He said go and die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get out your train that spirit. &gt;&gt; Get out your human spirit. Get your feeling and your feeling all your emotions you can't judge right because you're caught up in your own feelings. Cut that feeling crap out &gt;&gt; and get to understand God have a feeling too. He said my thoughts are not your thoughts. My ways are not your ways. Get my thoughts. You will kill your feelings and begin to speak the way God speaks and think the way God thinks. He have a way he thinks. &gt;&gt; So as a human being you feel this way and you feel that way. But how does God feel about the thing? All right, let's go on. How we going? You going good? &gt;&gt; All right, so watch. I give unto them eternal life. And it comes from the work the Greek word z o e zoe. Zoe is God. God's own life. &gt;&gt; That is why I'm talking about you got to have humanistic fate, humanistic patience. You see, that's not the patience of Jesus Christ. He's not talking about your human patience and your human temperance. So, you might look at your long patience, some people have it longer than others, and look at a brother with his short fuse. We call him short fuse. And you think you better than he &gt;&gt; But you are no better than he because you human with your long human patience and he human with his short one. And you say, "God, he's blood his skin." Yeah, he blood his skin. He need the temperance of &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And then he blood come back inside because the blood of Jesus blood of Jesus Christ not close to your skin. The blood of Jesus Christ is a little deeper than that. You know &gt;&gt; the blood of Jesus Christ a little deeper than that. Your blood close to your skin. You can't stand this one. You can't take on this one and whatn not. That not the blood of Jesus Christ. The blood of Jesus Christ completely different. He he just go to the unlovable. He just go to the lost. He just go to those that are far off. He just go Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People you don't expect. He is going after them &gt;&gt; and restore them and bring them back. Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight. &gt;&gt; So this word Zoe is eternal life. He said we exist eternally like God exists. &gt;&gt; Notice now watch there's a real true spirit of love. Spirit of &gt;&gt; love. There's a real true spirit of loyalty. Let me put this inside of here. And there's a real true spirit of brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the text. Not the talk of it, but the real spirit of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a real true spirit of honesty. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And remember sometime I was telling you and this how I I visualize it. This how I see it is like the spirit of honesty like a color. So somebody's honest the color is pure that in the spirit realm you could see that is an honest person. When that person is not honest the color is not the same. So out of you will be going out colorless then in the spirit realm. So when that guy came on the platform and brother Brandham saw him he said you're not sick. You're a preacher. You want a revival. How many want a revival here? And brother say how many want a revival. What is happening there? He's discerning the man's spirit. The man is not sick. The man is thirsting. &gt;&gt; The man is hungering. The man wants something more than the physical. He want an inside revival. You want an inside job. You want something to awaken your spirit because that is what a revival does. It renews your love for God. It renews your faith in God. It renews your prayer to God. It renews your study of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cry to get in the spirit. A passion to know the word and a fervent desire to please God. That is what revival does. Don't give the Lord a shout in the house. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to realize I don't take Wednesday lightly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't &gt;&gt; watch &gt;&gt; this great fountain of all eternity was the spirit of love, &gt;&gt; joy, the spirit of honesty. That spirit of truth in this perfection. &gt;&gt; Yes. And then out of the existence of the father went the logos which was the son which was the theophony which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a celestial body that's the logos. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word spoke out of them great fountains of life and went forth and there was the theophony which was God made into the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this invisible supernatural Elohim being &gt;&gt; conformed himself into this celestial body &gt;&gt; called the theophony &gt;&gt; called the logos &gt;&gt; called the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that is what was in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Then that the offering here we go was made flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the person Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then all the fullness of the trinity dwelt in him. Both father, son, and holy spirit all in that. And that very way we go plumb back to the original beginning of God. There we are born again. Not of flesh, &gt;&gt; born again, not of the blood, but born again by the spirit. &gt;&gt; And in that eternal spirit of love and honesty comes down to make it place in us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And then when we die from this life, we go into a body. &gt;&gt; If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have a theophony to go into a body celestial. Then at the coming of the Lord Jesus, this body is picked up from the earth again and made into a glorified state to live in his presence forever. Then all the perversion, all the things that was in the perversion goes out of existence. &gt;&gt; Flesh goes to its punishment. Hell opens up a mouth and swallows up the evil and the perversion. and God and his beloved church, his bride take their stand for the eternities to roll on. That's the great hope of the Christian church. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Another way he phrased it, the ray of light went forth. It was a ray of love. That's the main one, red. The next color follows which was blue. Blue, the tress. Next followed was another color. And through the seven perfect colors, which is the seven spirits of God that went forth from that great fountain, &gt;&gt; that great diamond that Jesus spoke of, that great diamond was jicked to reflect these colors. God was made flesh, dwell among us that he might reflect his goodness and mercy among us by gifts and signs and wonders. Reflect his gifts, his mercy. Oh, glory to God among us by signs and wonders. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. That whole big rainbow had become into a theophony and made in the image like a man. Yet he wasn't a man. He didn't have flesh. Yet he was a theophony. He was no one mezzed. Hallelujah. And Jesus made a priest after the order of Melzdc. Had no mother, no father. Oh, glory to God. Get me excited tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He had no mother, no father. Mechzedc. Oh, give the Lord some praises. We are going back to that word. We are going back to that theophony. We are going back to the expression where we came from. Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; My Lord, Moses said, I see I I would like to see you. And God hid him on a rock. And when he passed by, Moses said it looked like the backpack of a man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "But Brandham, we find him out here meeting Abraham." before that in the order of MelchzDC a body of flesh which was God. Sure it was. He was God in flesh. You said then brother Brandham why would he have to come back and be born. He wasn't born then. He was created a body that he dwelt in Melchazedc the king of Salem which is the king of Jerusalem which is the king of peace which had neither father nor mother nor beginning of days or end of life. But Jesus had both mother and father and a beginning of days and end of life. He was made after the order of Melzdc which had no beginning of days or end and of life. Mechzedc was God himself. Melzedc was Jehovah God. The same one that met Abraham years later in front of his tent. Isn't that right? But Jesus Oh, glory to God. Give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Jesus was that word made flesh. Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; David cried out, "Thy loving kindness is better than life." The word life have a perverted aspect to it because that even life itself has a perverted aspect. And many times people like to refer to life having a big time drinking, riing, going out. They said this is life. How mistaken they are. That's death. It's not life, it's death. This what he said. Now watch devils are worshiping. Every knee shall bow. but to know him in the pardoning of your sins and the renewing of your life by his spirit. That great fountain of all the resource of the goodness dwelling in you. God making you bring the fruits of love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, meekness, gentleness, patience, faith, all these great attributes which come from God alone. That's the only way to have life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this gospel come for you to have a better natural life. You get a better home, you get a better car, you get better house, get better this and what and you get you get better holding that do &gt;&gt; there's not the gospel in &gt;&gt; this come that you could become a reflection &gt;&gt; of that perfection &gt;&gt; because the reflection is the perfection &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; and you become what you behold &gt;&gt; that's why if you watch a bandit long enough you become a bandit too a thief long enough you become a thief too you you reflect what you Amen. You kind of reflect what you're looking at. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Let's go. So the word life has been misinterpreted to us. We call life. Somebody get a new car. We go down the road just whiz, have a drink. The arm around a girl. A young fellow said, "This is life." Young lady with a choice boyfriend, she got a drink or two, she said, "This is life." Or maybe the man who always wanted lots of money all of a sudden he falls air to a great amount of money. He will build a great home. He will get the finest of car. He will scream this is life. The poor little wash with her babies. She get a trip to Hollywood. She come a queen for a day or some program. She said this is life. But how perverted is that's death. Those will perish who have it. &gt;&gt; Now this thing that you call life become so miserable. Many times people take their life. So it could not be the life that God was speaking of because you cannot take God's life. Neither can you give God's life that lays by sovereign grace in the hands of God alone. But this mortal perverted thing you have life called life. You can take what you so desire. But to show you that life how miserable it becomes. This what we call life now is only a shadow or a negative. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about that. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We all like to rejoice. We all we can rejoice over the right thing, but this part is deep. So I want to take my time with this. Thank you for coming out again tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can rejoice over the right thing that shows that we are hooked up to the real thing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When we rejoice over the right thing, &gt;&gt; but when we rejoice over the wrong thing, here we go. It shows we are hooked up with the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the part I want to get to. So our life can tell right now what we are &gt;&gt; which way our emotions are running. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I've never seen this before. This is this is deep. There's another quote. He say we are here what we are &gt;&gt; somewhere else. &gt;&gt; Somewhere else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's deep. If we are rejoicing over the world and the evil things our minds and our souls are inspired by below. &gt;&gt; Come on. If we rejoice in the spirit &gt;&gt; that we have eternal life, &gt;&gt; we raise our emotions to God &gt;&gt; and praise him, then we have joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see the message world that deemphasize worship and figure is a kind of lecture thing people sit down and stare and stick their hands so and do so and write notes and no praise and worship. That guy's foolishness in God's sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is saying here you connect to the right thing. You would raise your emotions to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And praise him. &gt;&gt; There must be praises going up. &gt;&gt; If any lamb took the book, John say all in heaven, all under the earth heard, I praise God. And people talk about they see the name of the book and they sit down dead in church. That can work in here. That ain't no scripture for that. Okay. The Lord I shout we are not Pentecostals. We are not Baptist. We are not Catholics. Glory. We claim to be the elect lady, Mrs. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Jesus told the woman of the well, the hour come is we're the true worshippers. He make sure he say what time. Not just worshippers. The true worshippers, but worship the father. Come on, write with me. In spirit and in truth. For the father seek such. He seek such. He look for them. When you start to praise God, the anointing is going to come over you. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. You can get healed tonight. You can get delivered tonight. You can get sealed tonight. Oh, God. Those online, you can get healed tonight. You can get delivered tonight. Oh, God. Right in your house. Those are in your house. Praise God. Create an apple right inside your house. You may be &gt;&gt; seated. &gt;&gt; Let's go a little deeper. &gt;&gt; The reason Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "Whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart." &gt;&gt; See, it is where your emotion is set is where your thoughts is. &gt;&gt; So the Bible said we set our affections on the things above. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a choice &gt;&gt; that is intentional. &gt;&gt; You have to want to do that. &gt;&gt; Why something people have to want to learn? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said knowledge shall shall increase. Even with AI right now, you can access any information you want. how to cook Italian food, how to make chairs, how to fix this. I remember one time a mechanic came to check my car and he couldn't he get stuck. I just I said, "Look, look, you had you had to move this here. &gt;&gt; It just doesn't just I ain't no mechanic." &gt;&gt; But the information is right here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So knowledge shall increase for you to be a fool, to be ignorant. You have to choose ignorance as opposed to knowledge which is information to manage the challenges that's in front of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't be foolish. &gt;&gt; You got to be wise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are not changing, change will be changing all around you. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So you stay as you are &gt;&gt; and change will change around you and then you'll get squeezed. &gt;&gt; God sets it up this way. You know &gt;&gt; the age we're living in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember years ago cell phone was a privileged thing. There's only certain people before cell phone had this pager thing inside your privilege have a pager beep beep send a message you come with pag pager nobody a paging you know long time student have to come with with with with a calculator and and a compass or what all that in your phone now &gt;&gt; you make calculator by itself try to sell calculators that finish with cell phone now you're a target because they can I knew. &gt;&gt; Do you realize your cell phone is like a beeper? I am here. &gt;&gt; This is my cell. Yeah. Like you that by find all all the names looking all all miss rapture. They go to the cell phone. Only people lock your cell phone. How about go I didn't know they put outside. They could find you. &gt;&gt; There's no privacy any cell phone is a big beeper. I am here. Beep beep beep beep beep. Amen. Listen to this one. Well, tonight this is some message I have to bring and I have to finish. So, private don't do don't don't close your eyes on me. &gt;&gt; This day I am this day to see a young lady who went to a psychiatrist. She's 35 years old. Never smoked. Never drank in all her life. Very fine girl. Her people are Christians. Her father is a doctor. She give life. She he she gave her life to Christ at an early age. And what does she do? She goes out. She gets to a place the college where she was teaching and the psychiatrist there he sat down to talk to her. He said, "You mean you never have been kissed by a boy?" She said, "No, not one time in all my life. You mean you never even had a little drink, been to a party? Never." Said, "Girl, you don't know what you're missing." Now, him being a psychiatrist, he swung. Listen, he swung the girl's mind until now she has become so evil and so bad she don't even want to hear the name of Jesus spoke to her in her presence. &gt;&gt; And even her father and mother can't even see her no more. She lost her mind. And this next week we'll go to the institution for shock treatment. It's because that she turned her thoughts from Christ onto what the psychiatrist was moving moving her mind. And that is what we are here for this morning is to move your mind. &gt;&gt; Your thinking from the things of the world onto the things of God which is eternal. &gt;&gt; And that is what his preaching is for. is to pervert the thinking to a higher better and to a place where Christ is &gt;&gt; until you become converted. &gt;&gt; When your mind reaches for those things which are above. &gt;&gt; So you're not coming to church to be grounded and pulled down in the flesh. You're coming to church to be boosted and push up to the heavenly spot. &gt;&gt; This year is to strengthen you. It's to pull you up. The girl, they're thinking she might take poison out anytime. Life becomes so miserable until they kill themselves and take poison everything else. David said, "My soul thirsted for thee." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As in a dry land &gt;&gt; where there was no water. &gt;&gt; God made a man with a thirst &gt;&gt; that is part of the human being. It's this thirst. But God made the thirst in man to thirst for God. And the devil has perverted it and make it a thirst for his kingdom, for the world. Do you get it? &gt;&gt; Yes. A thirsting man is godly for God made man to thirst for God. &gt;&gt; Take that blessed Holy Spirit that God placed a thirst in your soul to call for &gt;&gt; and you satisfied with nightclub somewhere. No wonder you got a headache the next morning. Case of beer, go to your house, sit down, drink it, trying to satisfy that godly thirst that God put in your soul to thirst after him. That's the devil's slump. &gt;&gt; But David surrendered himself. That's a choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a choice. &gt;&gt; Like when I preach about um Amen. the message in in in Lagos talking about uh uh uh uh the secret place of the most high. &gt;&gt; I shall dwell under the shadows of the almighty. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I would see of the Lord. He's my rock. He's my refuge. It's a choice. &gt;&gt; What you say, what you want. &gt;&gt; The women out there, they don't care. Look how they dressing and wearing. But the men, the brothers have a choice to look or don't look &gt;&gt; because they don't care. You know, it's a spirit on them. &gt;&gt; They want to display their flesh. They want to act or they act. That's their choice. But we have a choice also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My soul is thirsting like a in a dry land where no water is. I thirst for thee, oh God. And that's what makes things different is the thirst that God give you. If you satisfied with the water, come to me all you are thirsty. Come and drink of the fountains of life freely without money, without price. You say, "I am not satisfied, brother." No wonder it's God dealing with you. God trying to bring you to something. That's why it takes God to convict somebody of their past life. Convict somebody of how they have lived. You have regrets and God want to convict you. You know why? You don't want to go back that way. You don't want to walk that way. You wish you had made different decisions. But you have an opportunity tonight to make better decisions. Hallelujah. that God will approve your step. He orders my step. He can order your step from tonight. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do not be deceived. Oh my. The devil has another way. We just have a moment left for this. The devil have another way to pervert. Now, this one is tricky. You say, "I don't drink, brother. I don't smoke. I don't gamble. I wouldn't run out of my husband or my wife. I live a good life. But the devil has perverted that. This is it. Now, this is message talking about he lets you think to satisfy your guilty conscience that you go join a church and you're all right. &gt;&gt; You're in this fellowship now in this tabernacle now &gt;&gt; and you're you're fine. And what I've been preaching for the longest while the message world is flood of entitlement people &gt;&gt; them figure because they have some book on tape and they believe brother Brandon they going to rapture which rapture that the rapture down in Port Spain &gt;&gt; it's a local rapture that not the Bible rapture you talking about here because the Bible rapture have a condition for it &gt;&gt; it talk about oil &gt;&gt; it talk about rapture in faith it talk about this being when it's completed is a servant of God in the church of God that going to rapture it say this being standing by the pulpit for 50 is with no life and character. &gt;&gt; It said this being &gt;&gt; completed &gt;&gt; which is the perfect man when it's completed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not halfway. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not halfway. When &gt;&gt; completed, &gt;&gt; it's completed is the servant of God in the church of God. &gt;&gt; This is the word. &gt;&gt; Well, I here for 30 years. What was what was complete? What? People just getting old. &gt;&gt; No change, no transformation. To grow is to change. Amen. &gt;&gt; To grow is to learn. &gt;&gt; We don't want to just age away. &gt;&gt; We want to grow. We want to be transformed. &gt;&gt; So here what the devil does, they don't smoke. They don't drink. They running coke. They run a woman. They whatnot and like that. Not taking drugs, but they in church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They are soldier. &gt;&gt; Not not me army Lord. &gt;&gt; Church soldier. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They love church more than God. Brother, &gt;&gt; you can't get satisfaction by joining a church. &gt;&gt; Get the bomb now. &gt;&gt; You only become mental. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's an intellectual affair. &gt;&gt; And these characters so perverted they want to blast an extra. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Them absole making noise. &gt;&gt; We have a low noise level. So does the Catholic church. You can't get satisfaction by joining a church. You can only become mental. It's an intellectual affair. You will never be satisfied until you know him. &gt;&gt; This is big tonight. &gt;&gt; Not know the mysteries, not know trumpets and vials and what is between the sixth and the seventh trumpet and the sixth and the seventh vial and the sixth and the seventh plague and all of that. You know all between &gt;&gt; you never be satisfied until you know him &gt;&gt; as the forgiveness of your sins &gt;&gt; where the sin question is settled &gt;&gt; this thing but the woman caught in the act of adultery. Let me just go fast down now. When Jesus said neither do I condemn thee &gt;&gt; go and sin no more and free her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is incredible. that nobody was there. &gt;&gt; What is she supposed to do? Black hat. Jesus, forgive me. Jesus, forgive me. Just forgive me. &gt;&gt; No, she had that revelation. &gt;&gt; She had that personalized experience. You have to get that. &gt;&gt; Everybody will watch you, point finger at you, want to go back in your past, want to go back in your sin. Even the devil is the accuser. He can't. He only watching accusing. That's his old job. What you do? Accuse, accuse, accuse, accuse, accuse. Jesus stand and say, "I drop your charges. I dismissed their case. I died for them. I paid the price. &gt;&gt; So don't play devil inside of here and accuse. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Joining church won't do it. That's only perverting the real cause. &gt;&gt; You see, if the people are not pointing to the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; you have to point them to the church. &gt;&gt; The minister and some solid four-hour mysteries. Got to hit them hard with some solid things that will that gray matter day there and head day will hit them solid &gt;&gt; mental stuff. I call it verbal gymnastic. You flip flipping here do a somersault here and whatnot. And you're taking 20 hours to do them somersaults on verbal gymnastics. At the end of the day they need the Holy Ghost. They need God. They need a breaking up. They need to get out the human spirit. They need to get out the humanistic realm and get into the spirit of the living God. When David saw the ark coming down, David, they just walk off normal. He said to dance and when he start to dance on white problems &gt;&gt; and them non dancers in the message go get problems when we start to dance. We start to dance yet. We only getting we warming up. We start to dance yet. Dancing coming, you know, shouting coming, you know. Oh, glory to God. This place right now, it too small for me this morning. It too small for me tonight. Just know I can run, put on the microphone, run, make a run, and come back. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Because the lamb is worthy to take this book. To loose the seals, to put my name on that book, to free me from men. Free from the Catholic Church. Free from bishops and message. Oh, glory to God. Free tonight. I could fly. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, Somebody say they thought T was dead. They thought we were dead. will be alive and picking &gt;&gt; that come when he snake bite spoil they looking so some people looking for die you know &gt;&gt; true &gt;&gt; could this happen that happen they're looking they're looking they can't wait and Paul just shake it off &gt;&gt; still alive and kicking &gt;&gt; but the Bible says joining church won't do it that's only perverting the real cause if the devil can't get you out of those things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. If the devil won't get you out of those things, he will take you to a this other. But don't settle here we go for nothing less than a oldfashioned experience of the new birth to be born again of the spirit of the eternal God. When your soul and God locks together and you become one, &gt;&gt; that is what God wants you &gt;&gt; to connect with him. The ministry is supposed to be a channel to connect you to God. &gt;&gt; Not a channel to come to the ministry. A channel to connect you to God. &gt;&gt; We are servants of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Like the disciple, true disciple, they brought them Greek straight to Jesus. And Jesus told them you had to die to Trinidad spirit. &gt;&gt; Die to the human spirit. &gt;&gt; Your human spirit had to break up. &gt;&gt; That go in the presence of God. God break that out. Whether CC CXCGC the degree doctor degree whatever you think you are who you think you are all that breaking up &gt;&gt; and your soul come up to the God presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My as the heart ped for water book but ram dramatized about the sheep the heart and the he got wounded and he talk about the dogs trying to bite and bite piece of the flesh and the hungs of hell is after every one of you. He only wants to get you away from the shepherd once and they grab them and they drink a handful out of them and a mouthful and David as the heart is sping after the water broke. So, but Brandon must have seen a vision to describe it that way &gt;&gt; that the heart is wounded &gt;&gt; because the dog grabbed piece of his flesh and if only water could give him a fresh charge. &gt;&gt; Only water could give him a revival. &gt;&gt; If water could give him the spurt to fully escape the dog. So, he is hungry. He is thirsty. He is going after water as the heart planted after the water broke. So my soul, that's how because the house of hell is after you. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Let's finish here now. &gt;&gt; The little deer knows. Let me see where I'm at. Page 8 of 11. I'm going on page nine. But Gideon, get ready. Stephen, get ready. David said as the hard puke, he has to go and find water brook or perish. Lord, let that be our soul today. wounded. If I can't find the waterbrook, the hungs will get me pretty soon. &gt;&gt; If I could only find that that waterbrook, &gt;&gt; the little deer knows it's either death or the waterbrook. &gt;&gt; They said, "Just as the deer know it's dead or the waterbrook, that's the way my soul is thirsting after day." &gt;&gt; I got to find you or perish. &gt;&gt; If you could only find that kind of a life. &gt;&gt; Then he said, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May that be the motives of this church this morning. May your affections be tuned from the things of the world, the cares of the world, whether it's your house being cleaned, whether it's your farm being weed, whatever it is, may it be turned to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I love in kindness is better to me than my own life. &gt;&gt; My soul thirst after thee like a dry land and like the heart for the water books, my soul must find thee or perish. When the Brham tabernacle &gt;&gt; gets to that place, &gt;&gt; the little isms will drop out the doors. The differences will all be settled out and Christians will be Christians and there will be a spot that will be talked of around the world when any congregation of people will thirst for God in that manner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Come on, Headstone Tabernacle. He said if any congregation thirst for God in that manner, &gt;&gt; thy loving kindness &gt;&gt; is less than life. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this &gt;&gt; with a brand. &gt;&gt; God help me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask you, I'm just reading that hasn't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you would like to receive the Holy Ghost. I want you to listen carefully. I'm closing how brother Brandham approached this. He is ministering in the realm of the spirit. This is the spirit ministry here. He's ministering to people at the end of the service. This is a message called the reaction to an action. I'm going to ask you that hasn't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you like to receive the Holy Ghost, here's the time to start it. You are here in campgrounds. You're here at a time to receive it. You know that no one will be in the rapture without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There'll be a sleeping virgin the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years. That's it. Move right out this way, my friend. That's it. All of you, young fellow, push the boy here in the chair and he's speaking now. You that want the baptism of the Holy Ghost, would you come up also? Come right over here. Stand up on your feet and say, "I'm in business, but I'm in business with God. I've got a little word in my heart tonight. A little bit of spirit that tells me if I mix this promise of God with the spirit that's telling me I can receive the Holy Ghost tonight. I'm coming to receive it." Is there enough spirit in you to tell you that God will do it for you tonight? If there is, raise up your hand. If you believe you got enough courage in you, there's enough Holy Ghost conviction spirit telling you that tonight you can receive the baptism. Is there? Come up here. Let's have a word of prayer and go over here so we can now lay hands on you and pray. Don't you come if you really want to come. That's right. Blessed are they that do hung on to have righteousness for they shall be filled. The Bible said so. God can't favor his words. What are you doing now? You are making preparations. How long have you sought the Holy Ghost? A long time. Long time you have sought the Holy Ghost. Now he's here tonight. What happened? Maybe you was down and just about ready to give up, but that's what happened. I want some of the cooperating ministers, if they will, go over with these people here to instruct them how to pray and give thanks to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some ministers here that knows God. Any of you brothers here that knows God, come over here. Four or five of you over here, come. Some of you stand right here along here. We're going to pray for them. How many of you gospel ministers in the building? Raise your hands. Gospel ministers, we're not questioning your your denomination. We want you here. Come here. All of you ministers, we need you here. Here's the time. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe the Holy Ghost is for you today? What did Peter say on the day of Pentecost? He said, "Men and brethren, what can we do? Repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus for remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promises unto you and to your children, to them that are far off." that we're going to pray for these people. &gt;&gt; All you ministers stand by and pray. Then we're going to take them over to the altar and they're going to receive the Holy Ghost. Every one of them. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are six nights of this service. Don't you come from your knees till the Holy Ghost has baptized you and then there'll be a revival break out. Then he said here now let's bow our heads. All you Christians pray father here are already confessed Christians. They read in the Bible that just those who have oil in the lambs went into the wedding supper. They're coming tonight to receive the oil. They seen a few minutes ago by having a meal already in the barrel. There's a mixing around here. They come for self-sacrifice to feel the hot burning fires of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that will light up the cross of Christ in their hearts and fill them with power and glory. And the baptism of Holy Ghost granted God. Anointed ministers are standing by them. We are here Lord to pray the prayer of faith. We want to see a great revival brick into this community. Now each one of you seeking the Holy Ghost go right this way. Ministers are going with you over there and stay there till the Holy Ghost comes. I want to deal with the rest of the congregation. He went on to pray. How many personal workers are in the building? Bless you, Sister Rosella. Would you come? Is there someone else a good personal worker that would like to be standing presence when the Holy Ghost fills someone? Would you like to do it? Any of you women? Any of you man, you woman go to woman. You men go besides men. Stand there. Be sincere. Drive at that devil. Defeat him. He's a defeated person. Do you believe that? He's just a big bluff. He has no legal rights over us. We are free children born of the spirit. We have a right to this God's heritage. We believe it. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. Fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord.
