[29:47] name I ask it amen amen God bless you
[29:50] one scripture Matthew 9 we want to read
[29:53] verse 16 and 17 of Matthew chapter
[29:55] 9 Jesus speaks
[29:58] welcome
[29:59] tonight no man putteth a piece of new
[30:02] cloth onto an old garment for that which
[30:05] is put in to fill it up take it from the
[30:09] Garment and the rent is made worse
[30:12] neither do men put new wine into Old
[30:15] bottles else the bottles break and the
[30:18] wine run it out and the bottles perish
[30:21] but they put new wine into new bottles
[30:25] and B A preserve may God bless his word
[30:26] you may be seated
[30:28] praise
[30:29] God well Sunday message but Anthony blow
[30:34] my
[30:35] mind it was one of the greatest message
[30:37] that was
[30:39] delivered and I want to
[30:44] believe not that it is odd but you know
[30:48] those who watch the weather wouldn't
[30:49] plan you know scripture concerning that
[30:52] and amidst all your tests and trials a
[30:55] message come for you to worship and to
[30:58] praise God and and this this is drawing
[31:01] to add put a Le on top of that but it's
[31:04] one of the greatest mess I've heard for
[31:05] a long time praise God presented
[31:08] here and to some it may look light talk
[31:12] about worship and praising God but it
[31:13] have a lot of depth to it more than you
[31:17] might imagine because for things to take
[31:19] place the atmosphere have to be created
[31:22] and you were built to be a
[31:25] Creator praise God that all we have here
[31:28] was always here since in Genesis all the
[31:31] planes the cars everything was here
[31:32] already you know it's just it wasn't
[31:34] discovered then it is discovered now but
[31:37] it was there for man to put the hand to
[31:39] it and make something out of it and it's
[31:41] so too we like standing here tonight as
[31:44] God's spiritual stist could mix things
[31:47] together and create something that that
[31:50] that different all together so it was so
[31:52] great it was wonderful I was really
[31:54] blessed with it so I have a title to to
[31:57] tonight you put new wine into new
[32:01] bottles inspiration Revelation then
[32:06] manifestation there must be a revelation
[32:09] first and that's what Jesus did he said
[32:11] who do men say I am and then Peter
[32:13] stepped forward and said thou are the
[32:14] Christ and then he said Flesh and Blood
[32:16] have not reveal it to you but my father
[32:18] and people don't catch how much they
[32:20] need Revelation and how Revelation come
[32:23] by the spirit now if you're not in the
[32:25] spirit no Revelation could break through
[32:27] because you are have you have a shield
[32:28] over you a shield of your own mind a Sho
[32:31] of your own weakness and faults and
[32:33] failures and sins and fears or whatever
[32:35] it is a shield over you but when you
[32:36] come to church and you begin to worship
[32:39] when there is no reason to worship or
[32:42] there is no reason that you feel to
[32:43] worship you're not going by your
[32:45] feelings you leave your feelings out and
[32:47] you worship anyhow when you could
[32:50] worship the devil is confused because
[32:52] you're supposed to be frustrated you're
[32:53] supposed to be depressed you're supposed
[32:55] to be giving up you're supposed to be
[32:56] letting go you're supp supposed to be
[32:58] almost committing suicide but yet you
[32:59] come and praise God at midnight Paul
[33:02] begin to sing at midnight Paul begin to
[33:05] worship Hallelujah there is a bad time
[33:07] to worship but that that's that's a
[33:10] human mind but to Paul that's the time
[33:12] to worship when things are tough when
[33:14] things are rough when you can't pay your
[33:16] bills when the When when when when when
[33:18] when when your creditors is coming in on
[33:20] you praise God when the devil gave it
[33:22] this trial and this thing happened and
[33:23] that thing happen and this test and that
[33:25] test and they say hallelujah anyhow

[36:11] connected together in worship once you
[36:13] have oil you have to have wine next to
[36:15] the oil oh give the Lord some Praises
[36:17] tonight oh we here to give God shout
[36:19] tonight you know Hallelujah brother
[36:22] brandom let's go so the Bible has told
[36:25] us you can't put new wine in Old bottles
[36:27] that one stumbled me I couldn't
[36:29] understand a bottle as I know we in
[36:31] America Glass of feir but in the orient
[36:34] I learned a bottle in the Bible was not
[36:36] a glass bottle it was a bottle made of
[36:38] animal skin I know you know it you hear
[36:40] it but may God reveal it and they take
[36:46] because if it's and dry
[36:49] you just dry and die might blow up you
[36:52] know all right so we talking to you
[36:54] tonight
[36:58] so the the bottle was animal skin they
[37:01] taking the skin from the animal tanned
[37:03] it as long as the oil from the animal
[37:05] skin was in the skin is flexible so when
[37:07] the skin gets old and set and dry it
[37:11] isn't flexible anymore that's like
[37:13] somebody in a message they're so long in
[37:15] it they old they're set and they're
[37:19] dry so watch this skin becomes dry and
[37:22] set and it won't give anymore so to put
[37:24] new here we go unfermented wine that's
[37:28] got life in it into a skin like that
[37:31] wouldn't be wisdom when the wine begins
[37:34] to ferment and to stretch the skin
[37:37] bursts and you lose both bottle and wine
[37:40] so there's a revelation inside of De you
[37:43] cannot put new wine into Old bottles you
[37:46] have to have oil in them bottles you
[37:47] have to be able to stretch to praise to
[37:50] worship to stand up to sit down if
[37:53] people call this the exercise in church
[37:54] that is the business we have nothing to
[37:56] do with that we will Cate our hands we
[37:58] put it down you might even lose weight
[37:59] with this thing oh give the Lord some
[38:01] Praises you might get in shape with this
[38:03] kind of thing but we here to worship
[38:05] because we go to Revelation 5 and see
[38:07] when the lamb took the book what
[38:09] happened to them oh give the Lord some

[49:20] reflect on the outside isn't that right
[49:22] praise the name of the Lord praise God
[49:25] so you don't care what kind of what

[58:01] don't need nuclear weapon we have what
[58:03] it takes Give the Lord a shout we have
[58:06] what it takes glory to God God released
[58:10] what we need to have thank you Lord
[58:13] [Applause]
[58:15] jesuso
[58:16] [Applause]
[58:17] Glory what did we read the last time I
[58:20] preach he say never give his mystery
[58:22] Secret in full he is waiting for it to
[58:25] be made known in the last days as he
[58:27] promised waiting for it to be fully
[58:30] comprehended before he could express it
[58:34] now the coming of the Lord is a mystery
[58:35] we don't know when he's coming how he's
[58:37] coming but we know he's coming after he
[58:41] already after he's already been
[58:43] completed then he reveals and shows what
[58:45] he's
[58:47] done never give his mystery in full then
[58:50] he say like comparing the Seven Seals
[58:52] when God used Martin Luther for the
[58:54] coming of that first St age he was used
[58:57] John Wesley he gradually brought him out
[58:59] and was revealing in them that church
[59:02] age so they were living out something
[59:04] unknown to them so it took a prophet
[59:07] after it's completed Here Comes brother
[59:10] Branham he standing at the end and
[59:12] looking back and said this happened here
[59:14] first age second age third age fourth
[59:17] age why it's already completed so he's
[59:20] showing you what what already has been
[59:22] done Oh Glory to God and then he come
[59:25] out to all this scattered word to tie
[59:28] back into the word to bring down the
[59:30] Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost was
[59:31] trapped or bound at river Euphrates by
[59:34] Creeds and dogmas because once you have
[59:36] Creeds and dogmas Holy Ghost can't move
[59:38] once you have interpretation Holy Ghost
[59:40] can't move when you have the Mystery Men
[59:42] preaching all kind of mysteries that God
[59:44] even sent Holy Ghost cannot move it has
[59:46] to be done unadulterated word that's the
[59:50] conduit of power oh give the Lord a
[59:52] shout the spirit could only move through
[59:55] the word
[59:57] Hallelujah an adoption oh my God is
[1:00:00] there is my spirit flowing
[1:00:03] freely no hindrance no self no parade of
[1:00:08] the beef no a man biging up himself or
[1:00:10] biging up his ministry that fishes that
[1:00:13] dead dead
[1:00:15] dead there is my spirit I find a empty
[1:00:19] vessel I find a Channel of communication
[1:00:22] that inspiration could flow through I
[1:00:24] find a man that I could use I could put
[1:00:26] hand on him I could find him I could
[1:00:27] take him I could break
[1:00:33] himall you see what what what did
[1:00:35] Brother Bram when he listened to the
[1:00:37] Pentecost and he didn't want to do what
[1:00:39] God tell him to do and he work hard he
[1:00:42] saving people he lost his wife he lost
[1:00:44] his child God has breaking
[1:00:47] him when he start to preach adoption he
[1:00:50] said he could turn your wife against you
[1:00:52] he could take a child he could do this
[1:00:53] he could do that to see what you will do
[1:00:56] the test is not them it's you so stop
[1:00:58] making excuse well well well stop
[1:01:00] pointing fingers and be a man and stand
[1:01:04] your ground stand like a man face
[1:01:10] it some people have no wife some people
[1:01:12] have no husband some people have no
[1:01:13] children some people have this and that
[1:01:15] and all kind of some people in
[1:01:15] wheelchair some people some
[1:01:17] people in hospital tonight where's your
[1:01:19] complaint like the man complaining he no
[1:01:21] shoes until he stop some no feet you
[1:01:23] still have foot shoes is still possible
[1:01:25] with you
[1:01:28] stop complaining too much come
[1:01:32] on question what does see thou hurt not
[1:01:36] the oil and wine mean in Revelation 66
[1:01:39] it's the Holy Spirit we just got through
[1:01:41] that hurt not the oil and the wine now
[1:01:44] what does oil and wine mean the oil we
[1:01:46] took it symbol means holy spirit now
[1:01:48] wine and oil is connected together in
[1:01:50] Bible in worship am so they that worship
[1:01:54] Him must worship him in spirit and in
[1:01:57] truth it looked like we only had
[1:02:00] truth because if any church is not
[1:02:02] worshiping what they
[1:02:05] have and D message we could have a
[1:02:08] picture of a
[1:02:09] cloud and have a picture brother Brown
[1:02:13] see see I do have that
[1:02:16] here any man could just sck a picture
[1:02:18] and stick a picture
[1:02:21] message oh is that right the CL make
[1:02:24] message
[1:02:26] or picture you I'm saying in other words
[1:02:30] we have to ask God for divine what that
[1:02:33] word divine revelation Revelation that
[1:02:36] comes from Heaven not an understanding
[1:02:40] but Revelation Revelation is when he
[1:02:42] reveal it to
[1:02:44] you and that is why you have to fight to
[1:02:47] be in the
[1:02:48] spirit that's why you have to fight to
[1:02:50] worship but if the devil keep you away
[1:02:53] from the true worship you can't get in
[1:02:54] the spirit then there's no Revelation
[1:02:56] coming you're only hearing and it hit in
[1:02:58] your head you're only hearing and
[1:02:59] sometime you're roting in church you're
[1:03:01] hearing just
[1:03:04] word but when Revelation strike you it
[1:03:06] it make you jump off your seat it make
[1:03:09] you act you were getting just now what
[1:03:11] it does and we could examine churches
[1:03:14] you could you could look for yourself to
[1:03:16] see if that is happening if Revelation
[1:03:18] really striking or if the man bringing
[1:03:19] Mysteries and look at oo he's my man
[1:03:23] he's our man he's the main man in TR a
[1:03:25] clone
[1:03:29] Entertainer watch this wine
[1:03:34] stimulates wine is the antitype of its
[1:03:38] natural form stimulation is revelation
[1:03:42] just think what stimulates the church
[1:03:44] Revelation so wine new wine oil and wine
[1:03:48] went together in sacrifice went together
[1:03:50] in church worship notice they're
[1:03:51] connected together you got a concordance
[1:03:53] you look at up the whole string where wi
[1:03:55] and all is met together in worship so
[1:03:57] wine brings what stimulation shout out
[1:04:00] stimulation you know what stimulation
[1:04:03] is is get you back out of your
[1:04:06] Blues you're tired you
[1:04:09] low make a cup of coffee
[1:04:12] for sometimes you want make um this
[1:04:14] thing
[1:04:16] sour sour is good tea put to sleep but
[1:04:20] when you want to be on the
[1:04:23] Move coffee it's two different kind of
[1:04:26] stimulants so will send you straight to
[1:04:29] bed but
[1:04:31] coffee I I
[1:04:34] demon whatever coffeee it have something
[1:04:37] inside of that so she why why I going
[1:04:46] there I hope this no
[1:04:51] problems do you get it know so wine
[1:04:54] which is revelation bring
[1:04:56] stimulation was somebody in the Bible
[1:04:58] the prophet was out of the spirit he
[1:05:00] said bring me a
[1:05:03] Minal bring me somebody that could sing
[1:05:06] bring me somebody could change the
[1:05:08] atmosphere amen because in this
[1:05:10] atmosphere I can't hear from God I can't
[1:05:13] draw the anointing I can't get a
[1:05:15] breakthrough with this atmosphere it's
[1:05:18] negative take this serious tonight you
[1:05:20] know you can't encourage and have a
[1:05:22] negative atmosphere and expect God to
[1:05:23] break through that go and coming through
[1:05:25] that
[1:05:26] bring me a Minal what for to get in the
[1:05:28] spirit and when the man get in the
[1:05:30] spirit he said dig some ditches not a
[1:05:33] few whatever praise God give a word
[1:05:35] because a man get in the spirit when
[1:05:37] that demon fall upon Soul where they get
[1:05:39] they say find somebody could play good
[1:05:41] music where they get
[1:05:44] David in the Old Testament never cast on
[1:05:46] a devil but they could sue that Spirit a
[1:05:48] play that have so that Spirit take a
[1:05:49] leave the
[1:05:51] atmosphere the
[1:05:53] atmosphere Oh Glory to God just as the
[1:05:57] spirit atmosphere playing the H could
[1:05:58] run that demon it have music that could
[1:06:00] bring
[1:06:02] demons do you understand that now just
[1:06:05] as music could send music could bring to
[1:06:08] the kind of music that people playing
[1:06:09] because the people playing music that
[1:06:11] Inspire from Hell the devil giving them
[1:06:14] inspiration words and all cting to sing
[1:06:16] a set of stuff with the music behind it
[1:06:19] and that hits in the charts getting
[1:06:21] people in the atmosphere but I say we
[1:06:23] had to get in the atmosphere of the
[1:06:24] coming of the Lord
[1:06:26] oh my and before before the disciples
[1:06:28] get the Breakthrough they came into an
[1:06:30] atmosphere of worship that's what
[1:06:32] brother an was preaching he said he came
[1:06:33] and identify his objective from the very
[1:06:35] start he said my objective only God
[1:06:37] could give him that my objective this
[1:06:39] morning is for us to get a create
[1:06:41] atmosphere so that could just tell me
[1:06:43] what is coming next because once the
[1:06:45] atmosphere begin create a Dynamics about
[1:06:47] it Dynamics is on its way and Oh Glory
[1:06:51] to God you see America right now is in
[1:06:53] an atmosphere of dictatorship because
[1:06:55] America have to become not the land of
[1:06:57] the free and the brave that used to be
[1:06:59] it have to become the land of the dragon
[1:07:00] and the
[1:07:03] Beast so what you're seeing here is
[1:07:05] prophecy
[1:07:06] unfolding Hallelujah is unfolding right
[1:07:09] before your very eyes just now America
[1:07:12] be unrecognizable people don't want to
[1:07:14] go
[1:07:15] America people war in the country about
[1:07:17] going to America sure getting back out
[1:07:20] normal you understand what going on
[1:07:22] there that country was the land of the
[1:07:24] free and the brave
[1:07:29] brother Bram he said now if you put in
[1:07:32] Leviticus 8 12 time gr boy wow you talk
[1:07:36] about the oil Matthew 14 fullish version
[1:07:39] now oil this on the third SE oil tipify
[1:07:42] spirit and wine symbolizes stimulation
[1:07:46] of
[1:07:47] Revelation boy I like to run all over
[1:07:49] the place people are
[1:07:52] running they sitting down in church and
[1:07:55] they say
[1:07:57] Revelation a non-stimulant
[1:08:01] revelation many many wrong
[1:08:04] Club listen it's a wonder I didn't wake
[1:08:06] up the whole neighborhood when the Lord
[1:08:07] showed me that stimulation of Revelation
[1:08:11] oil and wine in the Bible is associated
[1:08:14] together always then he said this when
[1:08:16] the truth of a promised word of God has
[1:08:20] been truly revealed to his saints that
[1:08:22] is filled with oil they get stimulated
[1:08:26] wine is stimulation he say Glory I feel
[1:08:28] it right now stimulated with joy and
[1:08:33] shouts do you get it now when the truth
[1:08:37] is being revealed the Saints with oil
[1:08:40] begin to shout they begin to get happy
[1:08:42] and joy they're not studying their
[1:08:44] problems and their issues in life out
[1:08:46] there you know they are connecting with
[1:08:48] the truth that has been
[1:08:51] revealed hallelujah
[1:08:53] hallelujah let's go
[1:08:56] huh they get all stimulated wine is
[1:08:59] stimulation he said Glory I feel it

[1:09:29] don't know but the point is this the
[1:09:32] same effect natural wine have upon man

[1:17:16] there until Joel's prophecy come to pass
[1:17:19] Isaiah prophecy Vindicated for which Tam
[1:17:21] lips another tongue somebody watching
[1:17:23] Jesus I see Jesus
[1:17:25] I see Jesus stagger and I Tak my queue
[1:17:28] from Jesus you stay there don't stagger
[1:17:31] don't speak in tongues don't wait for
[1:17:34] power just keep watching Jesus I see
[1:17:37] brother this AB that my promise watch
[1:17:39] brother know I have no scripture to
[1:17:42] watch but know I have scripture to watch
[1:17:44] the prophecy because he came to prophesy
[1:17:47] to a bride so you of what he do how he
[1:17:49] live that has nothing to do with me is
[1:17:52] the words that came out his mouth that
[1:17:54] word will not return void oh give the
[1:17:57] Lord some Praises so Peter scripturally
[1:18:00] thought taught because he had his
[1:18:03] understanding is open he had his mind
[1:18:04] open the scripture open to him he said
[1:18:06] Brothers wait Isaiah prophecy had
[1:18:07] fulfilled yet you Stam your lips no we
[1:18:10] sit down and shut
[1:18:14] up what is wine in the Bible refreshment
[1:18:17] this is the refreshment that come from
[1:18:19] the presence of the Lord it's got to be
[1:18:20] scriptural now you see the wine
[1:18:23] represents stimulation of Revelation so
[1:18:25] when the Holy Ghost fell they seen the
[1:18:27] fire of God fall upon them that begin to
[1:18:29] stimulate them and the first thing you
[1:18:32] know they got so stimulated till the
[1:18:34] people actually thought they were drunk
[1:18:36] but they were stimulated by Revelation
[1:18:39] the Revelation had them acting like
[1:18:41] drunk men oh God it's too much it's too
[1:18:43] much for me like I go for L tonight oh
[1:18:45] glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:18:48] to God that what we talking about the
[1:18:50] stimulation upon them take all the blues
[1:18:52] out of you tell all the negatives
[1:18:55] you know so so all that so that go you
[1:18:59] you become empowered just remember
[1:19:01] friends they were in the upper room with
[1:19:02] the door shut they have have open house
[1:19:05] and all the windows open they shut the
[1:19:07] door because they were afraid they shut
[1:19:09] the door because they were
[1:19:12] afraid Jesus was taken up you know they
[1:19:15] see him go up you know it have no jail
[1:19:17] protection you know that insurance
[1:19:19] coverage he had was no more
[1:19:23] in so they had to follow in obedience
[1:19:25] wait until the promise of the father
[1:19:28] Hallelujah got to wait for that now note
[1:19:31] when it strike them there was no CS no
[1:19:33] more you know they bust the door open
[1:19:35] but the but the Sab open the door and
[1:19:38] step forward Hallelujah so stimulated
[1:19:41] because the hour that they came out the
[1:19:43] the bars wasn't even open yet so that's
[1:19:46] why people had a problem with how how
[1:19:47] you be staggering so early what kind of
[1:19:50] liquor you have what booze you taking oh
[1:19:53] give the Lord some shouts
[1:19:56] Hallelujah too early to be looking so
[1:19:58] tight to be looking so high like a
[1:20:00] smoking some kind of gja or something so
[1:20:02] but they had something the L the valley
[1:20:04] they had a different kind of smokes Al
[1:20:06] together go give the Lord some Praises
[1:20:08] they had a different kind of head
[1:20:10] hallelujah hallelujah and this bride
[1:20:12] will PR be coming un stimulated you
[1:20:15] think we leaving here sad we leaving
[1:20:17] here shouting we even here praising God

[1:20:27] this thing working out now but the
[1:20:31] people thought they were actually drunk
[1:20:32] but they were stimulated by the
[1:20:33] Revelation God's Vindicated Revelation
[1:20:37] made plain to them they were happy about
[1:20:40] it God promised it here it was revealed
[1:20:43] to them and Vindicated to them here was
[1:20:45] a man standing there saying this is that
[1:20:48] this is it and there it was being
[1:20:50] Vindicated there is the stimulation of
[1:20:52] Revelation and it really had them and
[1:20:54] that's the reason Peter could go out
[1:20:56] there and said you men of Judea you the
[1:20:58] DW listen to me all you doctors of
[1:21:00] divinity listen to what I'm going to
[1:21:02] tell you how wonderful revealed they
[1:21:04] become so stimulated that they seen it
[1:21:07] Vindicated that it always does what it
[1:21:09] does let's continue when I see God
[1:21:11] promised to do a certain thing in this
[1:21:12] day when he promised to break off those
[1:21:14] seals in this last day and you don't
[1:21:16] know the joy the glory when I seen him
[1:21:18] reveal this and stand there and watch it
[1:21:20] happen and know that I will take any
[1:21:22] personal charge he never did say W thing
[1:21:25] that what that what happened that way
[1:21:27] and when we see the joy that's in my
[1:21:29] heart when I see his promise for this
[1:21:31] day as he promised to do it and see
[1:21:32] Vindicated you hear me say I feel
[1:21:34] religious that is what the matter it
[1:21:36] stimulation is so bad so when the
[1:21:38] stimulation hit he I feel
[1:21:40] religious he stimulated he said I feel
[1:21:43] religious there something fine inside
[1:21:45] him Hallelujah glory to God it's
[1:21:47] stimulation from Revelation they became
[1:21:50] so stimulated over the Revelation they
[1:21:52] Vindicated the promise they broke out
[1:21:55] with joy of stimulation till the people
[1:21:57] said they are drunk with new wine when
[1:22:00] God revealed this promise to them not
[1:22:02] only did he reveal it but he proved it
[1:22:05] as I always said a man can say anything
[1:22:07] and that's say every pastor and minister
[1:22:09] in Trinidad they can say anything praise
[1:22:12] God but when God comes around and
[1:22:13] vindicate that that's a different thing
[1:22:15] Al together oh give the Lord a shout
[1:22:18] that man said this is that that the
[1:22:19] prophet will BR I'm siake of I'm not
[1:22:21] about no dream a dream last night and
[1:22:23] meet some Angel and some and some
[1:22:24] feather and some kind of foolishness I'm
[1:22:26] not talking about that I'm talking about
[1:22:28] a promise that God made that God come
[1:22:30] around and vindicate that that you can
[1:22:31] say this is that that the prophet
[1:22:33] William brandham oh give the Lord some
[1:22:36] Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:39] glory to God so Revelation 5 1-7 is
[1:22:44] revelation the book and everything else
[1:22:47] and after that Revelation 8 to 14 is the
[1:22:51] worship the atmosphere isn't that right
[1:22:54] where I'm call it King lamb worship
[1:22:56] praise God Revelation first
[1:22:58] manifestation after it has always been
[1:23:01] that way Revelation first manifestation
[1:23:03] after isn't that right glory to God he
[1:23:06] call it that we are in the time of the
[1:23:07] revelation of these things being made
[1:23:09] known Hallelujah but they have to switch
[1:23:11] over some point in time to the
[1:23:13] manifestation of what has been revealed
[1:23:15] Oh Glory to God we have been living for
[1:23:17] 50 plus years in the time of the
[1:23:19] revelation of these things being made
[1:23:20] known because God wanted to reveal
[1:23:22] himself that was one of the object of
[1:23:25] God how to reveal himself clearly and
[1:23:27] his word was lost Through the Ages so
[1:23:29] the current couldn't flow down so like a
[1:23:31] plumber like a electrician he had the
[1:23:34] wire to connect from Paul irenius
[1:23:36] Columba he connect all the wires he tie
[1:23:40] up all the Loose Ends and he get a
[1:23:42] straight line and when he lights it up
[1:23:44] so it bring a charge oh give the Lord a
[1:23:47] shout how all them voices lined up oh
[1:23:50] glory to God would the bride have the
[1:23:52] voice of the archangel Oh Glory to God
[1:23:56] hallelujah when Jesus said Lazarus come
[1:23:59] forth Lazarus can say I ain't coming I
[1:24:01] ain't feeling head Lazarus had no answer
[1:24:04] to that you know he had to come forth
[1:24:05] and when that voice come in that bride
[1:24:07] whatever you say whatever you speak it
[1:24:09] will materialize just like that you talk
[1:24:12] about anointing coming in the church
[1:24:13] come on bride we have a lot to look
[1:24:15] forward for we have have we have to have
[1:24:17] great expectation glory to God Amen let
[1:24:21] me finish here hallu hallelujah
[1:24:24] M come up
[1:24:28] please the holy spirit always speaks the
[1:24:30] word he something to guide I've got many
[1:24:33] things to tell you you cannot understand
[1:24:35] it now but when he comes note Jesus with
[1:24:41] them word made flesh coaching them
[1:24:43] speaking to them giving them promises
[1:24:45] and yet in it he's prophesying about
[1:24:47] Holy Ghost he's talking about the spirit
[1:24:50] of Truth he's talking about the guide
[1:24:52] and when he comes I'm limited what I
[1:24:55] could tell you but he's
[1:24:56] coming then he said this yeah he will
[1:24:59] guide you to it that's the reason the
[1:25:03] coming of the seals here we go at the
[1:25:06] finishing of the seventh seal the
[1:25:09] mystery of God should be finished to
[1:25:11] know who God
[1:25:13] is what he is how he lives his nature
[1:25:18] his being you are supposed to be all the
[1:25:21] way up there which is up to brotherly
[1:25:22] kindness by that time into the full
[1:25:25] statue of Sons and Daughters of God
[1:25:27] because in the morning he preach a
[1:25:29] statue of perfect man this was a night
[1:25:31] service he preached the
[1:25:34] guide not at the beginning of the
[1:25:36] seventh
[1:25:37] seal at the finish of the seventh seal
[1:25:40] question where are we at beginning
[1:25:43] middling or
[1:25:44] finishing if we are to to get to the
[1:25:47] finishing we we should be way up there
[1:25:50] oh praise the name of the Lord praise
[1:25:52] God brother said this here each seal
[1:25:54] broken the word of God revealed to the
[1:25:56] man of the age I skip
[1:25:59] down he said it the eight to the 14th
[1:26:03] verse of the fifth
[1:26:05] chapter I'm reading reveals the time for
[1:26:09] the lamb to be
[1:26:10] worshiped both in Heaven and Earth yes
[1:26:14] the seven seal book The worthy lamb the
[1:26:17] Kinsman redemer from the eth verse so he
[1:26:20] separated it from the 8th verse to the
[1:26:23] 14th Angels worship Him Elders worship
[1:26:27] Him living creatures worship Him John
[1:26:30] worship him so much till he said every
[1:26:32] creat in heaven and in Earth under the
[1:26:34] Earth heard me saying blessing Glory
[1:26:36] power wisdom unto the lamb the worship
[1:26:38] time of the king lamb and worship comes
[1:26:41] before the Holy Ghost pours out oh glory
[1:26:44] to God praise God praise God as Daniel
[1:26:48] heard the seven tunders Ephesians CH and
[1:26:50] forbidden and John heard the voices and
[1:26:53] this book was sealed the mystery of God
[1:26:55] will be finished in other words God will
[1:26:57] be known to his church not in three
[1:26:59] persons but as one person the mystery of
[1:27:02] God would be revealed watch that would
[1:27:04] reveal now and when that was completely
[1:27:08] revealed then the seven Mysteries would
[1:27:10] open to the church talking about seven
[1:27:12] Thunders are you with me now are you
[1:27:14] with me because
[1:27:16] India the church will be living under
[1:27:20] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him
[1:27:24] moving in and out and showing his signs
[1:27:26] of being alive among us living among us
[1:27:29] then we are worshiping the living Christ
[1:27:32] that is Among Us that's a promise that's
[1:27:36] a promise seven tunders seven voices the
[1:27:41] church to be living under the
[1:27:43] inspiration of the Holy Spirit him
[1:27:45] moving in and out not no man moving out
[1:27:48] not no man presenting himself as some
[1:27:50] great teacher or orator or mystery
[1:27:53] revealer not that foolishness and I call
[1:27:55] it foolishness because we come to see
[1:27:56] Jesus not a man not a Trinidad man oh
[1:27:59] give the Lord a shout not an American
[1:28:01] man not a European man or South American
[1:28:03] man or African man no man at all we have
[1:28:06] to see Jesus come back Among Us that is
[1:28:09] resurrection Faith same
[1:28:11] signs same
[1:28:13] wonders I'm
[1:28:17] closing Jesus was
[1:28:19] manifested he said to the Hebrew bride
[1:28:21] because you hold your Traditions you
[1:28:23] make the word of God nonone effect it
[1:28:25] can't be effective that's why today the
[1:28:28] Revival we had is theom denominational
[1:28:32] revivals no real stirring the bride
[1:28:35] prophecy hasn't had a Revival
[1:28:38] yet let a minister challenge that let
[1:28:41] them just identify where the bride had a
[1:28:43] Revival and where the people who was in
[1:28:45] that Revival where they
[1:28:47] going the bride has not a Revival yet
[1:28:50] there has been no Revival there no what
[1:28:53] no
[1:28:54] manifestation of God note not
