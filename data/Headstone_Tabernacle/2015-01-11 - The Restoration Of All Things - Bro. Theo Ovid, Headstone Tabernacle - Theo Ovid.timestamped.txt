[17:31] ID greetings in Jesus name I want to
[17:33] thank you so much for your labors of
[17:35] love for God's people I'm enjoying and
[17:37] hearing the good news the Lord has
[17:40] blessed you in such a time that the
[17:42] devil is on a rampage to destroy all the
[17:44] hard work that has been done by the
[17:47] prophet and the Apostle thank you for
[17:49] yielding to the Holy Ghost I want to
[17:53] kindly ask a question but forgive me if
[17:56] it's not in order as I'm not trying to
[18:00] interfere in your local church
[18:03] decisions but the enemy is looking to do
[18:05] damage where he can in the message
[18:08] follow me but the kman Blasted drums as
[18:12] Voodoo instruments and I see little
[18:14] drums used in your church and most
[18:17] churches in the message especially the
[18:18] seventh and inspiration don't use them I
[18:22] don't know much but the critics could
[18:25] use that in a negative way please help
[18:28] me here so I know what to say people ask
[18:31] me this is my humble question not trying
[18:35] to be critical please understand I love
[18:37] your ministry to death God bless and a
[18:40] brother put his name I wouldn't put his
[18:41] name and I want to thank that brother uh
[18:44] for his respects and humility in sending
[18:47] the question and I love the question I
[18:50] um intend to deal I say with every
[18:53] elephant in the room we're not going to
[18:55] back down we're not going to run out we
[18:58] we will deal with issues as the common
[19:00] questions and I welcome criticisms I
[19:04] welcome uh questions we welcome whatever
[19:07] it is that will improve what we do and
[19:10] how we do we welcome it I want to say we
[19:14] welcome it we not tinin to get fight
[19:17] because there's a complaint we want to
[19:19] hear the complaints we want to hear the
[19:22] issues that troubling and and affecting
[19:24] you that we could deal with it because
[19:27] where we fail we want to succeed where
[19:30] we have to throw things out we will boot
[19:32] it out where we will correct things we
[19:34] will correct things we have nothing to
[19:36] defend we have nothing to pretend we
[19:38] just want to stand for what is right and
[19:40] we want to stand for Jesus Christ we
[19:42] love him and that's why we're here we
[19:44] here to serve him you're not here
[19:46] because of me you're here because God
[19:47] called you isn't that I remember when I
[19:50] was invited I was 16 years of age when I
[19:52] was invited to hear a tape the message
[19:54] was why Christ speak I sat down in the
[19:56] room deceased by the prince and you know
[19:58] when I think back about my life it's so
[19:59] much deceased now and deceased brother
[20:02] the prince he was obliquely opposite my
[20:03] house down in San Fernando and he
[20:05] invited me to hear tape was right CHR
[20:07] speak sat down there listen to the whole
[20:08] message and he at the end of the tape he
[20:10] asked me an astonishing question do you
[20:12] believe this to be a prophet and I give
[20:15] an answer I say
[20:17] yes because something in me bought
[20:20] record what I heard there was no Prophet
[20:24] there Apostle there Pastor there teacher
[20:27] there evangelist there there was just a
[20:29] brother a humble brother who wasn't even
[20:31] so educated just played a tape and I
[20:34] listened to the tape receive the message
[20:37] and never turn back or look back since
[20:39] that
[20:40] time there was nobody else no man no
[20:44] Elder no Deacon nobody saying anything
[20:47] that was God speaking to a
[20:49] son calling him by the eagle it was a
[20:52] eagle to the eagle call so when God
[20:55] called you there was no man in between
[20:58] there is no human being in between
[21:01] there's the spirit of the Living God
[21:03] calling you so let me deal with this
[21:06] this morning I want to deal with this
[21:07] and then I'll go and
[21:09] preach in October 28 2012 I spoke a
[21:13] message in New
[21:15] York the dispensation of another
[21:18] Ephesians in it the Holy Spirit guided
[21:22] me to make a clear
[21:24] distinction between what was echoed
[21:27] there
[21:29] and brother colan own personal
[21:32] inspiration that he had and I said
[21:35] Brother Joseph colan echoed the message
[21:37] of Malachi 4 I also said he did not have
[21:41] his own message if he had his own
[21:43] message it would be not complimentary to
[21:45] what he labed for all these years his
[21:48] testimony has always been to be an echo
[21:50] of what brother Bram
[21:52] said as you might be aware very few
[21:55] ministers quote brother Bram
[21:59] majority of preachers for all the years
[22:01] I've known don't even quote William
[22:03] Brown they preach what they want to
[22:05] preach and when they're ready they
[22:07] flavor it like if you're sprinkling some
[22:09] salt in it with whatever they want to
[22:11] think on the message but Joseph one of
[22:14] the few men and I was what 17 1975 when
[22:18] he came quoting the promises for the
[22:20] bride that's right that's the seven
[22:22] Thunders was never a New York promise it
[22:24] was always B branham's message amen it
[22:28] so happened nobody else choose to quote
[22:30] it and he did so it became aligned with
[22:32] him and New York but it had was to come
[22:36] that way because brother said there was
[22:37] something about New York so it was lined
[22:40] up with the prophet's prophecy that it
[22:43] will come that way which is the echo not
[22:45] a new message not another message but
[22:48] echoing the promises that brother
[22:49] Brandon brought so I said that Brother
[22:51] Joseph Coleman echoed the message of
[22:53] Malachi 4 and he had his own inspiration
[22:57] for his church Church his ministry and
[23:01] his family and I believe that
[23:04] distinction and division must be made
[23:08] because if it's not made you'll be
[23:10] confused I am not confused I never was
[23:14] Hallelujah I am not confused I never was
[23:18] because God sent one messag one
[23:21] messenger and that messenger is Malachi
[23:23] 4 from that one man message other men
[23:27] came for
[23:28] to make bring sense and life to the very
[23:31] message that the prophet brought he
[23:34] himself said May these men make it come
[23:37] to life I am only laying the seeds so
[23:40] all we could preach over the years was
[23:42] the seed because you cannot bring it
[23:44] forth until rain
[23:46] come as long as there is no rain all you
[23:48] could preach is seed all you could do is
[23:51] prophecy and give I give a testimony of
[23:54] the the spirit of Prophecy which is the
[23:56] testimony of Jesus so so all we could
[23:58] really do over the years was to take the
[24:00] message and Echo the promises God said
[24:02] it it's going to come to pass God said
[24:04] so there's going to deliverer that's
[24:06] what 400 years was God going to send a
[24:09] Moses we don't know when he is coming
[24:11] but we know he is coming that's all it
[24:13] was all these years Hallelujah Ministry
[24:16] of the word prophecy amen amen okay sa
[24:21] said
[24:22] that um I want to say that this itself
[24:27] this question and this statement clearly
[24:31] shows the importance of the sovereignity
[24:34] of the local church this is very
[24:37] important because the Bible said God
[24:40] have a people out of different Nation
[24:43] tongues people and so forth when I went
[24:46] to India they had the drums they had all
[24:48] the instrument instrument that you don't
[24:50] use we don't use they use across the as
[24:52] musical instruments and they playing
[24:54] that and they're doing that normal
[24:55] normal normal uh brother came to sing a
[24:58] special and he was barefoot normal
[24:59] normal normal no that ain't going to
[25:01] work in America but Barefoot that is
[25:04] normal I on the platform and that is
[25:06] normal that's fine because every country
[25:08] have its culture its environment its
[25:11] language its tongue its people it's food
[25:15] it's taste but God said out of different
[25:18] nations tongues people he's going to
[25:22] call a people for his name's sake so God
[25:24] is Not measuring one people with another
[25:26] people come on now say amen somebody God
[25:28] is Not than one people but how this one
[25:30] do it and how that one do it God allows
[25:34] the operation within the local that is
[25:36] why God must have local Elders local
[25:38] ministers and that's why it's a horrible
[25:40] thing when a nicolan spirit and
[25:42] political spirit and spirit trying to
[25:44] conquer the lady to come on to tell
[25:47] preachers and churches what they're
[25:48] supposed to do and how they're supposed
[25:50] to do it amen that's that's that's where
[25:52] the problem lies amen so therefore he BR
[25:55] woman blasted drums in the church and I
[25:57] know it
[25:58] but I couldn't do that because I have to
[26:03] go by what the word Say by what the
[26:07] prophet said I cannot go by his personal
[26:11] inspiration or what he sees for his
[26:12] church and follow it because he did it
[26:15] because if it's not a revelation to me
[26:18] I'll be following here we go without
[26:23] Revelation and I remember preaching in
[26:25] pen Harris about I think was president
[26:26] rean
[26:28] he had some guests at his table in the
[26:29] White House when he was president and
[26:33] everybody had the cup and had milk and
[26:35] the and he pour his milk into a plate
[26:38] and everybody watched the milk and pour
[26:40] it into the plate too and then the
[26:42] president take it and put it on for his
[26:45] cat and then everybody got
[26:47] caught because they were following here
[26:49] we go without
[26:51] Revelation they were watching the
[26:54] President they're not watching what
[26:55] inside of there what they're supposed to
[26:57] do and that's
[26:59] [Applause]
[27:01] me Hallelujah I don't copy I don't just
[27:06] do because others do if it's revealed to
[27:09] me you can't lock me and stop me from it
[27:12] glory to God I will stand regardless if
[27:15] everybody don't stand with it I will
[27:17] still stand with it hallelujah praise
[27:20] God now watch just as okay go ahead now
[27:25] watch so I never found or see where
[27:28] brother brandham refer to Drums as
[27:29] Voodoo
[27:31] instruments now if brother K get that
[27:33] inspiration for his church that's fine
[27:35] nothing against that he could say he
[27:36] don't want drums he don't want piano
[27:38] that's fine any Minister can say what
[27:39] they want and what they don't want and
[27:40] that's supposed to be respected some
[27:42] Churches have sisters on one side
[27:44] Brothers on one side I can't go and
[27:45] blast that that is what they have they
[27:47] have brothers in front sisters behind
[27:49] that's fine every church is Sovereign
[27:52] what we come for is the word and in
[27:55] addition and I was thinking it over from
[27:57] the of spirit but I'm say you do not
[27:59] judge somebody by Inner rain outer R you
[28:01] don't judge somebody by what church they
[28:02] go to who they associate with you judge
[28:05] them how by what
[28:07] spirit is in them John the Baptist
[28:10] didn't mix with anybody and they
[28:12] criticized John Jesus mix with everybody
[28:15] this he he too much M bibbers and
[28:18] Drinkers and so on why is he you see so
[28:21] you can't judge Jesus he liing with
[28:23] drunkers he's a drunk too that's wrong
[28:25] check the man Spirit out H check the man
[28:29] motive and objective out Hallelujah even
[28:33] if he looking uh tricky like Jacob you
[28:37] got to watch it you got to watch it
[28:39] because that is God's son all right we
[28:41] going to go there all right so I never
[28:44] found or see where brother bham refer to
[28:46] Drums as Voodoo and I guess we could
[28:48] call the electric a rock music
[28:51] instrument but it depends upon how it is
[28:54] used that's right so I want to share a
[28:57] few quotes of what brother manam said
[28:59] concering drums I check out voodo drums
[29:00] I check out whatever I I checked it out
[29:02] I have to go by the word so this is what
[29:05] we have here but brandham from Mees
[29:07] called pardon 963 28th of October what
[29:10] we need today is a prophet to rise on
[29:11] the scene with dust he the Lord and
[29:13] strip those things to the bottom and say
[29:16] that they have become a
[29:17] stink our denomination has
[29:20] growned our churches are big they are
[29:23] finer than they ever was we'll be a lot
[29:26] better off with a pan standing on the
[29:29] Alley again with a guitar out there
[29:30] beating a drum or something with real
[29:33] Pentecostal fire burning our souls than
[29:37] to set in great pews that we setting
[29:38] today
[29:40] dying with the world dying under our
[29:43] feet next quot just once more Lord 1
[29:47] December 63 and the very thing that God
[29:49] raised a Pentecost to do that has them
[29:51] bound stripped of Fellowship stripped of
[29:55] power fussing St
[29:58] luk on members find great things they
[30:01] are better off having a old Salvation
[30:03] Army drum or little old guter down on
[30:05] the corner somewhere I'd rather have
[30:06] that than have Cathedrals costing
[30:08] millions of dollars just about two
[30:11] more voice of the sign 21st of March
[30:15] 1964 right then the church is worth a
[30:18] lot of money milon million dollars in
[30:20] buildings there'll be better off father
[30:23] I believe back standing in the corner
[30:24] beating a tambourine with a hat in their
[30:26] hand old drummer and the corn like
[30:28] Salvation Army then it would be to sit
[30:30] in these great mars tonight trying to
[30:32] pattern after the world having a form of
[30:34] godliness but denying the power thereof
[30:37] last quote and this is from God's
[30:39] provided way and he said if I didn't
[30:43] respect the presence of
[30:44] Jehoshaphat I wouldn't even look at you
[30:47] now he got all chewed up he said play me
[30:49] some music so they got to play in the
[30:51] music the tamarine now listen if you
[30:53] can't be a prophet you can be one of the
[30:56] instruments
[30:57] that plays the music to bring the spirit
[31:00] down on the prophet you know what I mean
[31:02] so they begin to play the tambourine and
[31:04] beat the drums and play the instruments
[31:07] and all of them begin to beat and play
[31:09] and had a great big old song Maybe
[31:11] playing going to be a meeting in the air
[31:13] in the Sweet By and By and then the
[31:15] prophet begin to get in the spirit and
[31:17] the first thing you know get in the
[31:18] spirit things begin to
[31:20] happen oh blessed be the name of the
[31:23] Lord so that is what the prophet say
[31:26] about drum so even though I was aware of
[31:28] those things spoken I ignored it because
[31:31] that was not a revelation to me you see
[31:34] I cannot do what other churches do just
[31:36] because they do
[31:38] it uh I as the pastor of this church
[31:40] have to operate by
[31:42] Revelation so even though I know what
[31:44] was spoken I had to ignore it because it
[31:46] was not revealed to me not knocking that
[31:50] inspiration that Boman has because
[31:52] sometimes men are different and even in
[31:55] counseling uh some some pastors approach
[31:58] things a certain way different from how
[31:59] I would approach things and that's fine
[32:01] I don't question that because God have a
[32:03] way of using men differently amen so I
[32:05] can't question I may have a different
[32:06] approach so therefore I can't judge
[32:08] another man's approach I can't do that
[32:10] I'm not in a position to do that but I
[32:12] want to say this though when I sign up
[32:14] for the
[32:15] message I sign up for the word
[32:18] hallelujah hallelujah I didn't sign up
[32:22] for church
[32:24] politics Hall therefore
[32:28] I didn't sign up for a minister fighting
[32:30] another Minister I never bought any
[32:32] Minister's fight everybody who know me
[32:33] knows that I didn't buy any man's fight
[32:36] whatsoever if a man have a problem with
[32:38] a brother because this is what happens
[32:40] this is what church politics does I'll
[32:42] give you explanation and I people give
[32:44] me back testimony if this pastor have
[32:46] issue with another Pastor the whole
[32:47] church against that church because the
[32:50] pastor put that issue upon the people
[32:52] and screw the people up mess the people
[32:54] up and the people don't even know why
[32:56] they hate presentent and can't take that
[32:58] other church or that other Pastor I have
[33:00] never been in that there is no Pastor
[33:03] could accuse me of that I've never done
[33:05] that I'm free as a bird you're free to
[33:07] come welcome you're free to go or
[33:10] bye-bye praise God no attachment I don't
[33:14] run the church like a family I don't run
[33:16] the church like a club I don't do that
[33:18] you are God's people and I see God's
[33:21] people as not belonging to any man
[33:23] Hallelujah you don't belong to me you
[33:26] belong to him
[33:27] you're here to serve God I'm here to
[33:30] preach the word of God I'm here to
[33:32] inspire you to get closer to Christ yeah
[33:36] yeah yeah I may not be the smooth type
[33:38] of preacher I may not come with the
[33:40] psychology that others come with to play
[33:42] mind games I don't play Mind Games I
[33:44] tell you like it is can somebody say
[33:47] Amen oh
[33:50] Hallelujah
[33:52] Glory so what I'm fighting for is the
[33:54] kingdom of God remember years ago I told
[33:56] a brother I said listen if you fighting
[33:57] for your family in your church and you
[33:58] want to build your own church and Old
[34:00] Kingdom that's up to you I say I will
[34:02] support and back any man who is for the
[34:05] kingdom of God there are some people
[34:08] stop right at the family right there
[34:10] right there everything is right there
[34:12] like if that is the kingdom we can't
[34:13] afford to do that we can't afford Jesus
[34:16] called people from their family Peter
[34:18] come Andrew come come come come come
[34:20] come follow me not stay in your family
[34:22] business follow me I'll make you fishes
[34:24] of men that's the commission that's
[34:27] with your family your family will mess
[34:29] you up because they have thoughts but
[34:31] you're looking for the thoughts of God
[34:33] to drop down upon your soul to infect
[34:36] your life
[34:39] Hallelujah so this is what I want to
[34:41] show us trust that the brother get
[34:42] blessed uh with what we share here
[34:45] before we go into the word play Jesus's
[34:47] sweetest name I know just play a bit um
[34:50] praise God so I tell my wife and say
[34:51] know I love progress I love to see
[34:55] people achieve
[34:57] I love people to to want to change I
[35:01] hate people who don't like challenges
[35:05] there are some people praying praying
[35:06] praying pray oh God God God and they
[35:08] can't follow instructions when they come
[35:10] out to the prayer and God bring a word
[35:12] for them they can't follow that but they
[35:13] oh Jesus help me help me help me Jesus
[35:15] say I'm coming to help you I'm sending a
[35:16] word for you and when the word come for
[35:18] you I can't do that I don't want to do
[35:20] that you you're wasting your prayers he
[35:23] say your own prayers locking up your
[35:24] blessing because all you got to do is to
[35:26] obey and follow what God want to give
[35:29] you that's all you got to do Hallelujah
[35:32] you could ball you could scream you get
[35:34] nothing if after you come out of that
[35:36] you cannot follow simple instructions
[35:39] because the word come to give
[35:40] instructions and guidance and many times
[35:42] it's contrary to what you think what you
[35:45] feel how you feel is going to be like
[35:47] God love to raise the
[35:50] pressure man we can say some things here

[45:00] have no problems singing specials with
[45:03] recording with drums in it with trap set
[45:06] with drums and music they'll put on a a
[45:11] soundtrack I'd have drums in it and they
[45:12] could sing normal normal that's not a
[45:14] problem
[45:16] but what we have that's a problem but
[45:19] you know what the disaster that struck
[45:21] the church up in America they they had
[45:23] no drums in it and disaster struck
[45:27] things still fall apart things doesn't
[45:29] fall apart by
[45:30] drums things doesn't fall apart by you
[45:33] don't wear chain or you're dress long to
[45:36] the ground things don't fall apart by
[45:37] that you're message you look at messages
[45:40] cuz you're wearing your hairstyle one
[45:41] way things don't fall apart because of
[45:43] that Things Fall Apart when things go
[45:45] off of the word amen that's why Things
[45:47] Fall Apart and when we come back to the
[45:50] word things get restored so at this time

[53:20] inside I I love oh forgot to give the
[53:24] title is restoration of all things
[53:26] that's my title this morning restoration
[53:29] of all things and my inspiration is back
[53:31] to the Bible back to the word and I'm
[53:35] dead serious on that one because you
[53:36] have to go back to the Bible you have to
[53:38] read the scriptures you have to get back
[53:40] in the Bible you see this book is sealed
[53:43] and what the prophet came to do was to
[53:44] unseal it that we can know what is
[53:46] it a lot of people could say what bam
[53:48] said but they don't know what the Bible
[53:49] say so they can't tie back into the
[53:51] Bible but we have to be able to take the
[53:53] scriptures and tie back into what God
[53:55] Said here then it becomes alive then it
[53:58] becomes Quicken then it becomes
[54:00] scripture I think brother George tell me
[54:02] that brother bam said Jesus believe a
[54:04] drunk man it was that brother
[54:07] George but Jesus believe a boid preacher
[54:10] who he's talking about
[54:12] David David said I shall not see my
[54:15] suffer my Holy One to see corruption or
[54:18] see leave a soul in Hell David said that
[54:20] and call a back preacher and Jesus
[54:23] believed that word because that was God
[54:26] forget that back preacher forget that
[54:30] but when that man mov in the spirit and
[54:32] spoke by the spirit that was not the man
[54:36] come on give the Lord out come on now
[54:39] come on now when the spirit of God Came
[54:41] Upon that man you cannot touch what's
[54:44] coming out of here when that voice of
[54:47] God Rose
[54:52] out
[54:53] Hallelujah okay
[54:56] praise
[54:57] God praise God but bam said no doubt Mar
[55:00] of the Lamb your lovely Pastor has
[55:03] approached the subject many times and I
[55:05] know that there's going to be a bride
[55:07] and that there's going to be a wedding
[55:08] supper served in the sky just to show us
[55:11] God is because it's his word hallah and
[55:13] we know that those that are going to
[55:14] make up the bride is going to be his
[55:15] church and they're going to appear
[55:17] before him without spot or wrinkle and
[55:20] they're going to have listen watch H
[55:22] here we go are you ready and they have
[55:24] the material on earth now to make
[55:26] themselves
[55:27] [Applause]
[55:31] ready that amen s going
[55:33] light it have the material here on Earth
[55:36] now to make themselves ready because the
[55:39] Bible said his wife had made herself
[55:41] ready here we go notice it is said she
[55:44] has made ready Hallelujah so many says
[55:48] if the Lord will take this evil spirit
[55:50] from me from drinking from gambling from
[55:55] lying or stealing I'll serve him but
[55:59] that's up to
[56:02] you you have got something too they that
[56:06] overcome shall inherit all things they
[56:08] that overcome
[56:10] you have power to do it but you must be
[56:16] willing to lay it down she has made
[56:19] herself ready I like that word you see
[56:22] God here we go could not push us through
[56:25] a little pipe and pull us out on the
[56:28] other side and then say blessed is he
[56:30] that overcome
[56:32] it God cannot push you through the pipe
[56:35] and then come around and pull you out
[56:38] and say blessed is he that overcome it
[56:41] no his Blessing is he that pull
[56:43] it that is not overcome it now watch you
[56:47] had nothing to overcome he just pull you
[56:49] through but you have got to make
[56:52] decisions for yourself
[56:56] listen brother Bram I had to make a
[56:59] decision for myself and in doing that we
[57:03] show our faith and respects to God
[57:07] Amen when it dropped down what did Dev
[57:10] voice said because thou has chosen you
[57:13] have walked in your own choosing you
[57:16] have picked the precise and correct
[57:17] decision it is my way it is the harder
[57:21] way it is the narrow way oh glory to God
[57:24] because of this DEC ision a huge portion
[57:26] of Heaven awaits thee what a wonderful
[57:29] glorious decision thou has made this in
[57:32] itself is what will make and come to
[57:35] pass the tremendous victory in the love
[57:37] divine Hallelujah at the end of staying
[57:40] with the word God will show you a
[57:42] continuation of the word and God will
[57:45] confirm the word to your
[57:50] life Oh Glory are you with me but the
[57:54] Bram saw
[57:55] recognizing his message the seven Angel
[57:57] message is to open the mystery of the
[57:59] seals calling the 11 our Gentile to
[58:02] receive the same pay that the first hour
[58:04] workers got and Jesus taught it he said
[58:07] there were some people went into the
[58:08] Harvest they were hired and when they
[58:09] did early morning receive a penny for
[58:11] the day noon time came and work and then
[58:14] at the 11th hour last hour of the day
[58:16] someone come in and receive the same
[58:17] kind of pay that they did at the first
[58:19] hour of the day so it's perfectly the
[58:21] first hour Messengers with the word with
[58:23] the gospel the truth they came in the
[58:25] day of Pentecost there was a Dark Age
[58:27] block them out then at the middle of the
[58:28] day Luther Wesley then there's to be an
[58:31] evening time message to receive the same
[58:33] thing they did at the beginning yes sir
[58:35] this is very important not a new thing
[58:39] but the same thing here we go the
[58:42] evening time message is to restore back
[58:44] again to bring back that same thing am
[58:50] notice the scripture you read the
[58:52] Disciples of John came to Jesus and said
[58:54] why why say the scrib the disciples came
[58:57] and Disciples of Jesus why say the
[59:00] scribes Elias must first come the answer
[59:04] Jesus say Elias must first Truly Come
[59:07] and restore all things he's talking
[59:09] about Malachi 4 but Elias has already
[59:12] come and did what he's supposed to do
[59:14] he's talking about John the Baptist Same
[59:16] Spirit of Elijah but the first thing he
[59:19] said Elias shall F come first come and
[59:21] restore all things that means we have to
[59:24] see
[59:25] a restoration of the Holy Ghost back in
[59:27] the church a restoration of signs
[59:30] wonders back into the church I'm not
[59:32] talking about William brandham now he
[59:34] had that because he was restored back to
[59:37] Adam before the
[59:39] fall pray
[59:41] Hallelujah but Bram was a full
[59:46] demonstration of a son before the
[59:50] fall that's why he could say before the
[59:53] doctor son touches my wife the true will
[59:54] go down the tumor goes down little fishy
[59:57] I give you back your life he was
[59:59] demonstrating Apostolic Authority an
[1:00:02] Apostolic power and he said what you see
[1:00:05] going to have more of
[1:00:06] it when the stress of the press come

[1:00:35] family test but no the test of the word

[1:00:40] to be tested alone he bring his elders

[1:18:41] front man to say these people are not
[1:18:45] drunk as you supposed but this is that
[1:18:48] that the prophet you see we have to go
[1:18:51] back to the word hallelujah we have to
[1:18:53] identify the manifestation back into the
[1:18:57] scripture Jesus I was to find the place
[1:19:01] where it is written to say the spirit is
[1:19:03] upon me we have to go back to the
[1:19:05] scripture and the bride have to find her
[1:19:09] scriptures could somebody say Amen your
[1:19:12] scripture is not church
[1:19:15] member hallelujah hallelujah sit down
[1:19:18] sit a minute you see people want to
[1:19:20] believe this message and don't go to the
[1:19:21] word is that possible yes you could
[1:19:25] believe the message as a Doctrine as a
[1:19:27] teaching as a belief that is right but
[1:19:30] for you to go to the word means that you
[1:19:33] are applying the word to your
[1:19:38] life and wherever the sword Falls it
[1:19:41] falls hallu in other words you are not
[1:19:45] doing something because somebody else is
[1:19:47] doing it you ask what does the word
[1:19:51] say
[1:19:56] well this pastor allowing this or this
[1:19:59] pastor doing that and we should do it
[1:20:01] too no what does the word say so your
[1:20:04] measurement is not another church your
[1:20:06] measurement is not another group we have
[1:20:08] no Mecca the Muslim have Mecca Mecca is
[1:20:10] where they journey to that is the they
[1:20:13] say holy Place amen
[1:20:16] amen we have a
[1:20:21] me
[1:20:23] Hallelujah we have a headquarters
[1:20:27] to where where you going at BIR you I'll
[1:20:30] tell you but
[1:20:32] Bram he says we cannot all come into one
[1:20:35] organization we cannot do that can do
[1:20:38] these little organization I think God
[1:20:40] been in it the whole thing but we are
[1:20:43] different each man sees different each
[1:20:46] person is different no two minds is
[1:20:49] exactly the same no two people is the
[1:20:51] same no two noses no two Thum prints we
[1:20:54] made different and that way we should
[1:20:57] have different
[1:20:59] groups I want to hear a Bigg amen than
[1:21:02] that amen so we can't figh for one
[1:21:06] group little
[1:21:08] group the
[1:21:10] group it doesn't have that amen that's
[1:21:13] right watch God always works with an
[1:21:16] individual he don't save you because
[1:21:18] you're Methodist he doesn't save you
[1:21:20] because you're Baptist he doesn't save
[1:21:22] you because your Pentecostal he saves
[1:21:24] you because he has dealt personally with
[1:21:26] you and you are saved on that basis that
[1:21:30] you have accepted it so therefore God
[1:21:32] could deal with you he doesn't deal with
[1:21:35] you in the order of his church he deals
[1:21:37] with you as an
[1:21:40] individual therefore when God sent forth
[1:21:43] His prophets his messengers of The
[1:21:45] Testament he spoke to one man and that
[1:21:49] man had to bring the message others went
[1:21:52] from him everywhere bringing the same
[1:21:54] messag amen or supposed to bring the
[1:21:56] same message but there had to be one
[1:22:01] headquarters God has always had it I'm
[1:22:05] thankful he's got it tonight that's the
[1:22:08] Holy
[1:22:10] Ghost not some group but the holy spirit
[1:22:13] is God's headquarters that is God's
[1:22:16] messenger of

[1:22:21] have a headquarter this morning
[1:22:23] and we are connected to
[1:22:32] it so any group any church anyway want
[1:22:35] to be mecca for the

[1:31:14] First Kings chapter 18 reading from
[1:31:17] verse 17 we read and it came to pass
[1:31:21] when Ahab saw elah that Ahab said unto
[1:31:25] him art thou he that troubleth
[1:31:30] Israel are you the troubl
[1:31:33] man and he answered I have not troubled
[1:31:37] Israel but thou and thy father's house
[1:31:40] in that ye have forsaken the
[1:31:42] Commandments of the Lord and thou has
[1:31:44] followed bam now therefore send and
[1:31:48] gather to me all Israel on onto Mount
[1:31:52] carel and the prophets of Beal
[1:31:56] 450 and the prophets of the Grove 400 so
[1:32:01] that is 850 prophets all together which
[1:32:04] eats at Jezebel table Hallelujah you see
[1:32:06] where them prophets eaten from so Ahab
[1:32:09] sent unto all the children of Israel
[1:32:11] gathered the prophets together unto
[1:32:13] Mount carel and Elijah came unto all the
[1:32:15] people and said how long shall you halt
[1:32:18] between two opinions if the Lord be God
[1:32:22] follow him and if baale then follow him
[1:32:25] Hallelujah and the people answered him
[1:32:26] not a word there was
[1:32:29] silence then said Elijah unto the people
[1:32:32] I even I only remain a prophet of the
[1:32:34] Lord but be prophets of
[1:32:38] 450
[1:32:40] men that's a huge comparison there let
[1:32:44] them therefore give us two Bullocks let
[1:32:47] them choose one bulock for themselves
[1:32:49] cut it in pieces lay lay it on wood put
[1:32:53] no fire under and I will dress the other
[1:32:56] block lay it on wood and put no fire
[1:32:59] under Hallelujah and call the on the
[1:33:01] name of your gods and I will call on the
[1:33:04] name of the Lord and the god that answer
[1:33:07] it by fire let him be God hallelujah
[1:33:11] then the people tongue get loose and all
[1:33:13] the people answered it is well
[1:33:17] spoken and Elijah said unto the prophets
[1:33:20] of Beal choose you one Bullock for
[1:33:22] yourselves and dress it first for ye are
[1:33:25] many and call in the name of your Gods
[1:33:28] but put no fire under and they took the
[1:33:30] bulock which was given him they dressed
[1:33:33] it calling the name of Baal from morning
[1:33:35] even until noon saying oh Baal hear us
[1:33:38] but there was no voice no any that
[1:33:41] answered and they leaped upon the altar
[1:33:43] which was made it came to pass at noon
[1:33:46] Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud
[1:33:49] for he is a God either he's just talking
[1:33:51] or or he is pursuing or he is on a
[1:33:53] journey or per Adventure he sleep at and
[1:33:56] must be waking and they cried aloud cut
[1:33:59] themselves after the manner with knives
[1:34:02] landet till blood gush out among them
[1:34:05] and it came to pass when midday was
[1:34:07] passed they prophesied until the time of
[1:34:10] the offering of the evening sacrifice
[1:34:12] that there was neither voice nor any to
[1:34:14] answer not any that regarded and Elijah
[1:34:18] said unto the people come near unto me
[1:34:21] and all the people came near unto him
[1:34:23] here we go this the part I want to get
[1:34:25] to Hallelujah and he
[1:34:27] repaired the altar of the
[1:34:30] Lord that was broken down keep your
[1:34:32] pages right there we not finish the
[1:34:34] first thing Elijah did was to repair the
[1:34:39] altar repair it in your home amen repair
[1:34:43] it in your house repair it in your life

[1:34:49] you pray husband and wife the place

[1:35:02] altar of God back into the home back

[1:35:10] up unto God incense going up unto God
[1:35:13] are you with
[1:35:15] me and Elijah took 12 Stones according
[1:35:18] to the number of the tribes of the sons
[1:35:20] of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord
[1:35:22] came saying Israel shall be thy name and
[1:35:25] with the stones he built an altar in the
[1:35:28] name of the Lord and he made a trench
[1:35:30] about the altar as great as could
[1:35:33] contain two measures of seed he put here
[1:35:36] we go the wood in order he didn't just
[1:35:39] throw the word on the altar he put it in
[1:35:42] order and that's why the church must be
[1:35:44] set in order that's right that's why
[1:35:45] your life have to come into order there
[1:35:47] must be an order isn't that right he cut
[1:35:50] the Bullock in pieces laid him on the
[1:35:52] wood and said fill four barrels with
[1:35:55] water pour it on the bird sacrifice and
[1:35:58] on the wood he said do it the second
[1:36:00] time they did it the second time he said
[1:36:02] do it the third time and they did it the
[1:36:04] third time and the water ran about the
[1:36:07] altar he filled the trench also with
[1:36:10] water and it came to pass at the time of
[1:36:13] the offering of the evening sacrifice
[1:36:15] Elijah the prophet came near and said
[1:36:17] listen to this prayer Lord God of
[1:36:20] Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known
[1:36:23] this day that thou art God in Israel
[1:36:27] that I am thy servant and that listen I
[1:36:30] have done all these things at Thy word
[1:36:34] hear me oh Lord hear me that this people
[1:36:37] may know that thou art the Lord God here
[1:36:40] we go and that thou has turned their
[1:36:42] heart back again amen keep your fingers
[1:36:47] right there the Elijah's spirit is to
[1:36:50] restore
[1:36:52] and turn the hearts back to God and this
[1:36:56] is what he is praying here now watch
[1:36:58] then the fire of the Lord fell and
[1:37:01] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:37:03] wood and the stones and the dust lick up
[1:37:07] the water that was in the trench and
[1:37:09] when all the people saw it they fell on
[1:37:11] their faces and they said the Lord he is
[1:37:13] the god the Lord he is the god and
[1:37:16] Elijah said unto them take the prophets
[1:37:18] of Baal let not one of them escape and
[1:37:21] they took them and Elijah brought them
[1:37:23] down to the brook Keon and slew them
[1:37:25] there may God bless the reading of his
[1:37:29] word before the fire
[1:37:34] fell before the fire fell the altar had
[1:37:38] was to be repaired the altar had was to
[1:37:40] be restored prayer had to be offered for
[1:37:44] the god that answer by fire Hallelujah
[1:37:46] let him be God and before the fire of
[1:37:49] Dynamics Falls got to be a restoration
[1:37:53] of all things a restoration of the
[1:37:56] prayer altar back in the church a
[1:37:58] restoration of s and crying and
[1:38:01] travailing and groaning for the Holy
[1:38:04] Ghost there's got to be a restoration
[1:38:07] because the opening of the word is
[1:38:09] supposed to bring us back to the
[1:38:12] Bible praise God the opening of the
[1:38:15] Mysteries thank you Lord is supposed to
[1:38:18] bring the people back Hallelujah to the
[1:38:20] word amen amen but Bram said this Moses
[1:38:24] was the word in that day because the
[1:38:25] word was given to him for that day am Mo
[1:38:28] Joseph was the word in that day
[1:38:29] portraying Christ each one of them was
[1:38:32] the word here we go are you ready but
[1:38:34] when Jesus came he was the word in its
[1:38:38] fullness because the whole Plan of
[1:38:41] Redemption laid in him the whole Plan of
[1:38:43] Redemption didn't lay in Moses didn't
[1:38:46] lay in Joseph didn't lay in Elijah they
[1:38:48] were part of the word pointing to where
[1:38:51] Hallelujah notice keep your thought here
[1:38:53] it comes as I see it the whole plan
[1:38:56] wasn't in them they were pointing to it
[1:38:58] am therefore after him the fullness here
[1:39:02] we go we cannot point to something else
[1:39:06] amen it points back to him the word so
[1:39:09] when the fullness come we can't point to
[1:39:11] some man we can't point to some group we
[1:39:14] have got to point to The Headstone
[1:39:17] himself the Capstone of divine love even
[1:39:21] Jesus
[1:39:22] [Applause]
[1:39:25] Christ so anybody point to a man or
[1:39:27] group is false it's off the word it has
[1:39:31] to be back to Christ the fullness
[1:39:34] because you have to be brought into the
[1:39:35] measure of the fullness of the stature
[1:39:38] of Christ which means you get your
[1:39:41] measure of this stature this is the
[1:39:45] fullness but you get a measure of that
[1:39:47] fullness in your
[1:39:50] life
[1:39:52] hallelujah oh
[1:39:55] Hallelujah glory to God so therefore the
[1:39:58] five4 ministry amen will take the bride
[1:40:01] amen back to the word amen back to the
[1:40:03] Bible Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:40:05] because the Bible brings on the fullness
[1:40:07] of the atonement that's what came to
[1:40:09] bring the fullness of the blood
[1:40:11] understand this the altar is where
[1:40:13] judgment strikes and because the altar
[1:40:15] has blood on it it becomes a mercy seat
[1:40:17] he said the altar was there in the
[1:40:19] Garden of Eden that's where k able come
[1:40:21] to worship he said the way back to Eden
[1:40:23] Is by The Altar and through the altar we
[1:40:25] have to come back to the altar the altar
[1:40:27] is where the sacrifices approved where
[1:40:29] your life has come on the altar stripped
[1:40:31] of ambition stripped of will stripped of
[1:40:34] Pride stripped of who you think you are
[1:40:37] and you say God consume the
[1:40:40] [Applause]
[1:40:45] sacrifice remember we talk about three
[1:40:47] things last Sunday amen hallelujah three
[1:40:49] things to make fire yeah and we talk
[1:40:51] about the word we talk about worship and
[1:40:53] we talk about sanctification it must
[1:40:55] have those three ingredients must be a
[1:40:57] Sanctified Bunch some part of this Earth
[1:41:01] God going to bring a Sanctified Bunch
[1:41:03] through you have to be Sanctified by the
[1:41:05] word God have to clean you up wash them
[1:41:08] by the washing of the Water by the word
[1:41:11] and with that you come worshiping
[1:41:13] praising God oh
[1:41:17] Hallelujah I I don't want to be quoting
[1:41:19] quoting quoting he said the Mysteries is
[1:41:21] to bring you to a spot where you have to
[1:41:23] where you could behave yourself amen
[1:41:25] that's what it's for amen not for you to
[1:41:26] go and say you have Mysteries you have
[1:41:28] knowledge because Paul handled that do I
[1:41:30] know all Mysteries do I have all
[1:41:32] knowledge and I do have the love of God
[1:41:34] I am not Z nothing zero
[1:41:38] n Paul hand that already do I have faith
[1:41:41] to move mountains nothing
[1:41:45] [Applause]
[1:41:47] still the Miracles Jesus they didn't do
[1:41:49] it no it was the cross that did it the
[1:41:52] powers in the cross that's why he went
[1:41:55] down to hell that's right that he
[1:41:57] brought the resurrection he raised the
[1:41:59] dead you think they say thank you for
[1:42:00] raising the dead come for come to us
[1:42:01] Jesus no look how live brother brah Live
[1:42:04] the Life of Christ manifest Christ do so
[1:42:06] much of Miracles and the Pentecost still
[1:42:07] hated him and rejected him they still
[1:42:09] push him aside they was impressed with
[1:42:11] the Miracles but that that St As It Go
[1:42:13] but guess what he said the message going
[1:42:16] to get in the hearts of the
[1:42:17] predestinated amen some of us wasn't
[1:42:19] even born yet some of us wasn't wrong
[1:42:22] but he knew by Vision this word can't
[1:42:25] return void God circle the Earth with
[1:42:28] this message and God had to find you in
[1:42:30] TR look where you come from look how far

[1:48:44] back to the word we have to go back to
[1:48:48] the Bible isn't that right
[1:48:50] blessed be the name of the Lord Brother
[1:48:53] Bram said to the Lutheran age they Jud
[1:48:56] by faith the outer Court Along Came the
[1:48:58] Methodist age sanctification age they
[1:49:00] call it the second definite work of
[1:49:02] Grace which come in that age watch and
[1:49:05] now there's that's the alter age I like
[1:49:08] that that's the gring that's the Train
[1:49:11] That's the travailing you see
[1:49:12] sanctification is what you do God has
[1:49:14] not come to come and clean up your house
[1:49:16] no angel coming to sweep no broom in
[1:49:18] your house you will clean up your house
[1:49:21] you will cut the grass around your yard
[1:49:23] you will cut the grass in your
[1:49:27] heart and you will clean up your life
[1:49:30] you will do it say after me I will do it
[1:49:33] I will do it say I've got to do it do it
[1:49:36] I will do it I will do it say I've got
[1:49:39] to do it do it give the Lord a
[1:49:45] shout so the alter age is a
[1:49:48] signification age is a traviling age
[1:49:51] once we waiting in the spirit we waiting
[1:49:53] on the
[1:49:55] sanctification
[1:49:56] hallah because Dynamic is coming yes sir
[1:49:59] Hallelujah now I can say Dynamic is here
[1:50:02] and it is here it is here in the form of
[1:50:04] Promise sir but brandham had that promis
[1:50:07] Amen brother K identify his Dynamics as
[1:50:10] the spirit of Prophecy because Dynamics
[1:50:12] is Spirit but if the spirit is not here
[1:50:15] for power and demonstration it can only
[1:50:17] be here as prophecy which is taken the
[1:50:20] word and prophesying it that's what we
[1:50:22] have to do from version 10:8 to11 we
[1:50:25] have us to take from the prophet and
[1:50:26] prophesy back to the people because we
[1:50:29] don't have our own message that's why I
[1:50:31] bring the quotes that you will know I'm
[1:50:33] saying what the tape
[1:50:36] say and I'm inspired saying it and God
[1:50:39] is anointing it so there is no mistake
[1:50:42] I'm trying to say this I'm trying to say
[1:50:45] that I'm not trying to say anything but
[1:50:47] what the tape
[1:50:48] say come on get the Lord some praise His
[1:50:51] People oh Hallelujah you see I know God
[1:50:56] only confirm his word not an
[1:50:58] interpretation of it I understand that
[1:51:01] years ago that is why I start to stay
[1:51:04] and say even if I'm preaching free and
[1:51:06] know I'm preaching what the prophet said
[1:51:07] am a brother ni come and tell me I said
[1:51:09] something and he was searching to find
[1:51:11] it I was happy he did that afterward he
[1:51:13] found it because you never heard it
[1:51:14] before so even though you see I'm
[1:51:16] preaching free I'm not preaching my own
[1:51:17] thoughts you could find it back in the
[1:51:19] prophecy word years ago I purposed to do
[1:51:22] that when not preaching if I'm not
[1:51:24] quoting I'm still saying what the
[1:51:26] prophet said oh Hallelujah but I'm
[1:51:28] saying it free I'm saying what the tape
[1:51:31] say I purpose that I do that not trying
[1:51:33] to interpret it means so it means so the
[1:51:35] 10 vision and this and that and twist
[1:51:38] here and twist here and try to figure it
[1:51:39] out I'm not trying to figure out
[1:51:40] anything if God said it it have to come
[1:51:41] to pass God said there's going to be
[1:51:43] Revival it got to come to pass God said
[1:51:45] you will be formed to the word image
[1:51:46] it's got to come to pass you have to be
[1:51:48] formed in the word image before you're
[1:51:50] going to Rapture you are not in the word
[1:51:52] image right now because your trials is
[1:51:54] what going to do that and some of you a
[1:51:56] ready for that yet some of you just got
[1:51:58] a little test and you want the ball and
[1:51:59] give up Hallelujah you have to go

[1:52:06] Wilderness hallu you hear that only 10%

[1:52:16] to Danel know but God send me long way
[1:52:18] to hoping hoping that the had give up on
[1:52:22] Egypt notice when the trial come let us
