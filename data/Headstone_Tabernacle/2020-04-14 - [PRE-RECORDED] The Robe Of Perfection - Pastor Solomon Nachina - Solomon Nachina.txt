not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there was a man which had not the wedding garment and he said unto Him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then said the King to his servants bind him hand and foot take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few chosen and our second Bible read in his second Peter 1 verse 4 read from verse 1 to 4 when our pick from this for tonight he said Wepa are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that bidc might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in

there this morning a lot of memories came along the way and to see me sitting here in here umbrella Chandler speak is a blessing hallelujah but they started preaching one way still in primary school amen I remember that Ovid came along amen with a message titled another officience is here for the final great kill those years ago but we are still standing with that and I remember brother Chandler blessed are the eyes that see and the ears that hear a way and we are standing the Robledo I remember those days I must decrease and he must increase so young people there is something in seven the Lord hallelujah we are fruits of their ministry and we are standing declaring the testimony that he's the same yesterday today and forever there's nothing in the world Satan lost me a long time ago I'm still standing with the same message of Malachi 4 to tell you that there is life in the world there's nothing in the world Oh blessed be his mighty name and our precious brother although I remember whose knees you mean he's still standing he hasn't given up and we are so standing to by the grace of Almighty God you appreciate this man or fake so for a short title tonight the Rope of perfection are you ready tonight now we are going to pick together now because it's not a lecture hall this is sons of God feasting on the world so you preach to me I pick back to you then we kick the devil out hallelujah because we're we wear the sons of God weak Satan is not welcome this is the this is hallelujah a feast of eagles the Buddha's are welcome the vultures are not welcome it is fresh manna from the Father straw hallelujah he has pleaded to come to the wedding supper are you ready to feast tonight welcome to the robe of affection oh you may be seated tonight hallelujah amen I've never been this way but brother we are going to make it by the grace of God now he is the vine and we are the branches and the life in the vine is in the branches now the branch only proves what is in the vine there are fruits that the branches bear proves what life is in the tree so you cannot get mango tree from a vine of oranges a mango vine will bring four mango fruits hallelujah a seven thunders seed will bring for a seventh on the bride hallelujah a Papa Eagle will bring for a baby eagle the manifestation will prefer the interpretation and we are here today we've been total out to our faith thank you so there's got to be something in you to odd what is nothing to add there's going to be a cornerstone the cornerstone has been laid no other foundation can any man lead and that which has been laid and that cornerstone is price and price is the word in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the word is God now where is made flesh louia but this word converges comfort it has to be in the prophecy so as I said a very shall conceive it had to be in the prophecy hallelujah Mary stepped on the scene a manifestation of the prophecy she had a revelation that God has spoken it the prophet has declared it and nothing will stop tower property is going to come alive through hallelujah and when Mary went to Elizabeth she went with a revelation of the inspiration hallelujah and give a testimony this something in here there's something in here is of the Holy Spirit and John had a revival John her to bear witness of the prophecy that that prophecy cannot fail Oh hallelujah and here was Jesus Christ manifested what was it Emmanuel God with us so that we can all say the word it must live out it must express itself it must come alive it can all say the word is a spirit or must come upon the word to bring it forth and the prophets that is gonna be a bride the bride is gonna be spotless top right is gonna be sinless that bride is going to be the virtuous bride of Jesus Christ or I'm looking at you today I'm looking at a brighter day I fell down yesterday but as I promised there's a promise that there's gonna be a bride without spot without wrinkle Oh hallelujah don't care what a devil will tell you that is the prophecy there's got to be a manifestation of the prophecy hallelujah Oh blessed be his mighty name today yeah so we are here to bed a fruit of the vine amen and we are not afraid to produce the life of Jesus Christ because it is written of us in the scripture which is the prophecy then the web must find you to bring for the life of the prophecy there's got to come for the manifestation of the prophecy hallelujah and so the vine cannot just stay the vine it must bring four branches and any brain that does not bear fruit hallelujah must be pruned off hallelujah so a 7-ton divine will bring for a seventh on the sea you believe that our seventh on the vine will bring forth a seventh under C Northcote in seven plan de nous le vois when is fit all the way to charity but the same cornerstone was rejected but brother we have come all the way through seven church ages to the headstone again where it must bear witness with your spirit hallelujah that the voice where is following the sea all the way from poor to Iranian to Martin to Columba to looter to Wesley and now it's another time it's another season what for the full manifestation that is a bride in the making another masterpiece on display and the devil cannot stop it no church system comes topic Dorji nomination can stop it but it is the prophecy hallelujah oh you love him tonight glory be to the name of the Lord may you may be seated [Music] every promise in the book is coming alive there's gonna be a dynamics to the mechanics this bright my shoe and displayed our rope of perfection hallelujah nothing will stop me intellectuals will not stop it unbelievable lost topic where are you believe it you don't believe it it doesn't stop car once it is spooky it cannot return but boy is got to comfort hallelujah he made hallelujah you know the prophecy amen where she precedes the Holy Spirit we are not gathered in Trinidad to just have to see one another we are here for business we are here to stump the devil out out of our lives out of our homes out of our churches hallelujah and the only way you sure that you are live is there when something moves you got their head controls the body the intelligence has to control the body when the head sees their hands move their hand has got to move hallelujah for the bronze like the head cannot be flesh and the body concrete no is gonna be flesh another body intelligence to send information down to the body hallelujah so we are here to destroy the ways of Satan we are here to cast off every doubt yet to cast out every unbelief here to cast out every mind battle and to pull down that wedding comment which is the talking when I see the Blood I will pass over you God is here to pass over you so you must display the blood you must display the talking what is the talking is the power of God is the quickening power in your soul to prove to the devil are you of escaped the corruption hallelujah can I get an amen I you have escaped the corruption so we say Amen tonight we say lorry to God why because we are not bound we are free whoops whatever the son of man are set free is free indeed is free indeed there's got to get an expression is the holy ghost without sensation but if the holy ghost with emotion hallelujah you've got to do something it is well cup season you may be seated hallelujah it is well cup season amen now when a goal is good brother that is jumping there is shouting there's hallelujah there is victory there is joy in the camp how much more this morning we scored a goal against the devil but now we are still too belated and this is another month we are scoring more goals against the devil we should be shouting we should be praising we should be lifting up the name of a lot of Jesus Christ because we are escaped Oh glory be to the Living God many many men you may be seated tonight hallelujah so we know that amen the Bible said Jesus said I can behold I come in the volume of the book so Genesis to Revelation is Christ and Christ is the word and Christ is the cups to Christ is the cornerstone Christ is the headstone that must unite with the body and without you Christ is not complete hallelujah so we've got to put on this group of righteousness what is this group of righteousness it is a perfection that was built on the day of Pentecost from the masterpiece with Abraham said he said he started on the day of Pentecost to build another masterpiece the original seed word he started in the first church so this masterpiece started somewhere is got to finish somewhere hallelujah they started with Paul the first church the seed the word the word manifested the that had been given Joelle said it shall come to pass in the last days saith god I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy the old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions what he would do in this last day even in this last two thousand years what is it it is Christ coming back again hallelujah what is it it is Christ coming back again how is he coming back he made promises now notice it started out as the original and Jesus says this word of God is his see that and so was in a sewer sold and he was the sower the seed was the word and any see that is that abides alone does nothing is got to fall into the ground to bring forth to touching a king hallelujah so Paul went to the ground but it remained there it had to bring for another see veggie weariness came on the scene it couldn't stay there to bring for another see and the prophet said he went on down up to LA Asia brotherly kindness hallelujah but out of that God had to call him right now amen because all of them went into the nomination but this bride has no denomination that will come around her there's no men ideas that will come out of here she's the sinless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ she's a word seat now and no seed is contaminated once it comes from the original see you believe that tonight there's no contamination in that original see [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so the headstone the capstone comes upon that bride not loud Asia because out of loud Asia comes the bride to get our wedding garment now that wedding garment is not for anybody it is for the bride of Jesus Christ that has been called out and positionally pleased to receive it hallelujah hallelujah the wedding coming is not for church member it's not for make believer in stock for denomination is exclusive bright promise it's exclusive bride comment be the name of the Lord we made and the Prophet said Amen is got to fall into the ground to bring forth is production again and this see that perfect church fell to the ground admission room when she become a denomination but she's not to remain there but it is the original seed nothing can keep it down they try to keep it in a roman tomb it couldn't hold it on the third day he broke forth hallelujah they try to bind it a bay fit them to lions but they couldn't kill it they tried to fry it out of John but the Korean fry the Holy goes out of him so this wedding commando man can take it away from you brother you have been designed to fit into that wedding comment of the word that is why you escape the phone's Christ you escape force anointed do man's idea can tie you down hallelujah because you are here to take the headstone my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow hallelujah that is why they see the wedding garment is is you but it doesn't sound right I am NOT the wedding Cummings I've got to receive the wedding coming that is the prophecy his wife has made herself ready how by the wedding coming so you are not the wedding comment you receive the wedding coming to be dressed up for the wedding oh I with me tonight and amen glory be to the Living God the Prophet said in any debt any trash injections it will break but heavens and L will pass away but the way will never break you remember in cutting off a diamond that you have to have a perfect tool to do it with hallelujah so it brings up to the honing of the bride because that's what there we've been corner of law deja to fit in to a particular place for the head to sit right smack together for the head and the body to be one so there's got to be specifications for warning that bride to fit that wedding garment you just cannot come with any comment you cannot come with interpretation it will fit into the garment you can't come with men's ideas it will fit into the garment the token will not come on anything it has to come on that wedding coming and it must fit right smack together we may capsule of the dynamos amen there's got to be a perfect tool to do it with not just any piece will do I've seen tons of big grinders crushed right through it and move them big toes over pass it is that past that diamond right true and move them big toes over right on true no you don't break the diamond it has be cut hallelujah so this wedding garment amen or with a headstone is coming to identify way it will not crash it has to fit amen but before it does it must cut according to the pattern umbrella Braham brought us the pattern when you have added to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge temperance well you've got seven things when you are ready hallelujah then we are ready for what for the wedding coming to come upon oh you believe that tonight amen amen email hallelujah he made glory be to the Living God he made but the branding goes on in the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen is that then what is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the same Spirit of God dwell in the people that's the wedding garment now that's a hedge too now God dwelling way in the people say yet a little while the world will not see me but you will see me because I will be with you I'm not satisfied with leaving with me but I will be if you now when you walk the world will see Christ walking walking living manifesting hallelujah Oh what is the Holy Spirit what is the wedding coming what is the talking the Holy Spirit is the same spirit of God dwelling in the people whom he has died for so Christ didn't die for anybody he died for the bride he died for the sea he died for those that have been given the wedding comment [Applause] hey man are you one of them Oh glory to God amen he died a man that the Holy Spirit is the same Spirit of God dwelling in the people whom he has died for and put their names on the Lamb's Book of Life which when they were one with him in the beginning so we just didn't come here to pick up the wedding comment we're part of him hallelujah before you were formed in your mother's womb he knew you he predestinated you he elected you he ordained you he already cut out to a wedding comment hallelujah according to the specification and he put some in Trinidad put some in Ghana put some in Nigeria but one spirit are we all baptized into the body hallelujah so there is no - no Gentile we are the bride of Jesus Christ there's no truly Didion there is no gonna end we are the bride of Jesus Christ the body of Christ that must have the same spirit because alive in the famous reflect in the branches Oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated amen he said which is the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation is that which we were one with him in the beginning the Jesus not tell them that they were with him before the foundation of the world is that your minds are blacken and tack and we all are to those things but we are just not some little crystals happening here we are sons and daughters of God the killing of the creation of God and has been dropped down here for a witness [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah we have been dropped in Trinidad for a witness so your life is not your own you have no right to live any harm whether you are being dropped here for a witness to reflect the character of Christ to reflect faith all the way to charity you are being dropped and Trinidad for the witness you have been dropped in and Judah for your witness Christ must be reflected because the wet cannot remain where the spirit must come upon the way to live out the life of Jesus Christ hallelujah we are here for a witness what is it we are disciples of Jesus Christ we're disciples of Jesus Christ a reflection of the same spirit if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead drop you what will he do it will quicken your mortal body and will quicken you from the praise it will give you a shout it will give you a victory it will give you a phrase it will give you overcoming power before he conquered you shall conquer he overcame you shall overcome he defeated seen you will defeat sin because the very spirit is living in you giving you power give you authority in my name they shall cast out devils we are casting out Devils though praise the mountain hold me down because I overcome that spirit hallelujah now are we the sons of God that is why no can suck a whole your body down in my name you shall cast out diseases you shall pick up deadly things and they shall no hurt you why the same spirit is in you doing the same whether he did the same yesterday the same today the same forever o blessed be the name of the Living God so you are here for a witness now we are the sons of God in the beginning amen in the beginning of the creation of God and has been dropped down here for witness to witness the grace of God that He shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit Alleluia and we have an eternal spirit so this wedding comment is not a seasonal thing in today out tomorrow hallelujah he said when I see the Blood I will pass over so your life is not your own you may be seen it and when word when they were to to apply the token in the Old Testament young people now the lamb was to be killed he meant and applied now when that thing you saw the blood you will pass over it will pass over now if you were a firstborn and you decide to walk out of the house go your way and do what you wanted that dip and you look back you away you are to stay in the ackee you are to stay under the blood you are to stay continually under the black that is where you escape but when you step out of the blood God is not responsible you are to stay as a witness that the blood has been applied that their token has been displayed then the tip in your compass huva then nothing shall come near you nothing shall hurt you but I'll soon as you walk out of that blood God is not responsible you'll lose your wedding comment oh are you with me tonight are you with me tonight hallelujah you go we must get this wedding coming and we must have this wedding coming with us all the time all the time not some time not on sun or not just on Sunday but on a Monday at the Westside they must bear witness that you are being with Christ Alleluia Oh glory to God when the pasta is not there they must bear witness that you have the wedding coming on Oh glory be to the Living God when your friends are with you they must bear witness that the wedding comment is on Oh hallelujah hallelujah well because we have an eternal spirit it is not a human spirit it is an eternal spirit that looks back to the prophecy everything must look back to the prophecy that is what a revelation that doesn't tie back with the prophecy threw it away hallelujah is that how you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe God does a promise I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh that is in the prophecy when I breathe in what shall we do repent hallelujah and be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive hallelujah the gift of the Holy Ghost for this promise is unto you and to your children and to your children's children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call that is in the prophecy hallelujah anything outside the prophecy forget about it they're waiting come and cannot come on that anything outside the prophecy the histone cannot come on that Oh hallelujah so when you get to a revelation it must tie with the prophecy amen in the prophecy invasion will conceive Mary conceived that was a manifestation of the revelation to tie with the prophecy there's going to be a bride without spot or wrinkle is in the prophecy so we've got to look for our bride without spot without wrinkle oh but I fell yesterday there's going to be a bride I'm tell today there's gonna be a bride or you did this yesterday there's gonna be a bride why it is tied up in the prophecy hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen behold I send you elijah the prophet is in the prophecy but what is he to do hallelujah this prophecy is complete it's not a half prophecy hallelujah there's a part a and a Part B hallelujah there's the body and there's the head it's not just the body so the body behold I will send you Elijah the prophet but what do you see to do to turn the house of the children back in the house of the father the children back to the heart of the fathers hallelujah and then he said he is to do two things 10 the house of the children back and reveal the mysteries contained in the seven seals which are the seven thunders that is what he used to do so with now the seven thunders the wedding coming cannot come Peter told us at your feet all the way to charity and the profit that that is how he cups off his individual one of added these virtues when they are in you and a life and living with me tonight we go glory be to God we have an eternal spirit he meant no one no one there is no way to stop it I here is only when charity identifies with your testimony that's when you receive that eternal spirit well he's the same one the cornerstone has become the
