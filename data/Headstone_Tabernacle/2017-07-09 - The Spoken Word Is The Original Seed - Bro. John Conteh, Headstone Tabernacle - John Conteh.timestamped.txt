[50:21] anything can happen tonight just get
[50:24] some faith glory to God hallelujah this
[50:30] convention is really special right from
[50:34] the very possibly is fire fire fire and
[50:38] that's how I know is the holy convention
[50:42] because every sacrifice must be made by
[50:46] fire and brother God has to provide the
[50:50] fire you bring your sacrifice but God
[50:54] provides the fire so we're thankful for
[50:56] all the meetings God has been so good to

[51:06] every disease sorry consume tonight
[51:09] you've got to believe that hallelujah if
[51:12] you hit now in answer MA
[51:14] there is he
[51:16] [Music]
[51:18] I tell people sometimes you have issues
[51:24] you can handle the only way out is by
[51:28] faith so faith is not a suggestion is
[51:35] the most you can come to these meetings
[51:41] without issues only you and you are
[51:44] asking can I believe will I be healed
[51:47] will I be delivered will I receive the
[51:50] Holy Ghost is no suggestion you have to
[51:56] believe the result things are possible
[52:02] to them to believe if how comes believe
[52:07] as many times people don't know how to
[52:10] believe and that's why when you receive
[52:13] the Holy Ghost gonna to to sort of
[52:15] believe to believe text willingness say
[52:34] man God is moving
[52:47] in the days of Jesus if you go to the
[52:50] Gospels that's blind bartimaeus like
[52:55] butter by the Peters first opening
[52:57] message Jesus methodology knew they will
[53:02] seek denied even but it will always wait
[53:06] for them to cry he will wait until faith
[53:13] is expressed because they have to be
[53:16] willing to be healed so willingness is
[53:20] when you will leave your face and go
[53:23] will see to what extent are you willing
[53:25] to what extent can you push so you can
[53:37] come to these meetings and just relax
[53:39] you think well it will happen but where
[53:41] is your faith I came two nights already
[53:46] unknown take the Holy Ghost is upon me
[53:50] tonight if you are just willing you can
[53:55] go back with your diseases you can go
[53:58] back in your same stage we are going
[54:00] back home change because God is more
[54:05] than willing to deliver you to set you
[54:09] free to have ties you with the Holy
[54:11] Ghost this is God's program this is
[54:14] God's idea this is God's Way
[54:17] [Applause]

[54:32] be seated
[54:34] we woman cable the issue bloody is
[54:37] bleeding doctors and physicians are
[54:41] exhausted all that she had she had only
[54:44] one off the Messiah would the son of man
[54:49] as you came in faith she spoke from
[54:53] within ourselves and inside revelation
[54:59] if I can only push to him of his coming
[55:01] I saw him at all a pastor did not tell
[55:05] her that a bishop did not tell her that
[55:08] for so this pocket inside a cedar

[57:14] revelation nobody bright comes to the
[57:16] thought fries were Halstead our servant
[57:19] of faith must pick up healing and
[57:22] forgiveness and that's how I committed

[1:10:14] it's to help these most of the world the
[1:10:18] world by which God created all things is
[1:10:24] it that's where our there must be an
[1:10:25] amateur God on the earth because it was
[1:10:29] given a commission be fruitful and
[1:10:33] multiply but it was only a seed of the
[1:10:38] world
[1:10:41] consumerism analyser and I would also
[1:10:44] this morning it was given a seven the
[1:10:45] rest but whoever all lot my wall is one
[1:10:50] now come he moves for let's labor to
[1:10:55] enter into the race that miss Adam had
[1:10:59] to let off can somebody's Hermes nachos
[1:11:06] because you can bring fruit without his
[1:11:09] original scene it was only a seed of the
[1:11:11] world but the one itself in its entirety
[1:11:15] by which God grated all the things was
[1:11:19] the logos the fullness of Christ Christ
[1:11:25] is before all things and by him all
[1:11:28] things consist
[1:11:29] and if you had said all things by myself
[1:11:31] Alleluia praise God so that was the
[1:11:34] original seed by we've got Twitter all
[1:11:38] the things the look of seen Jesus Christ
[1:11:42] fullness let me see this and God took
[1:11:50] that seed
[1:11:51] he kept virtually the service here a
[1:11:57] seed by which when that see Sphynx in
[1:12:02] you it can come back boy
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:06] hallelujah praise God it was like that
[1:12:10] scene that the Sun was created the moon
[1:12:12] wherever we have and the last image the
[1:12:18] stepped out of the seed was a man and
[1:12:21] the image likeness of God hallelujah
[1:12:25] where is God Oh somebody help me show
[1:12:27] tonight some heavy so tonight hallelujah
[1:12:31] praise God we have come into that's easy
[1:12:34] now when God shall give the trust back
[1:12:38] apostolic Authority when we shall speak
[1:12:41] our words will go forth like lightning
[1:12:46] but you must understand how to come to
[1:12:49] that is it it but a three-album little
[1:12:55] preachy I miss you
[1:12:58] [Applause]
[1:13:01] I'm an Amazon the earth I'm here under
[1:13:05] the story hidden story Adam was placed
[1:13:09] in Eden's God's paradise she was not
[1:13:14] just an earthly creatures it was an
[1:13:17] identity creatures could be neither that
[1:13:20] was the headquarters of the earth and it
[1:13:23] was given a commission be fruitful
[1:13:25] multiply we produce your kind because
[1:13:30] you see it's by the world that God
[1:13:34] created the monkey the baboon all the
[1:13:37] screens you see but why are they all
[1:13:40] different in the appearances because you
[1:13:43] must know the seed by the kind
[1:13:46] because the seed is got to be inferred
[1:13:48] after it so it is a kind that if I have
[1:13:53] seen so you must know your kind
[1:13:56] to understand your fear is your disease
[1:14:00] might look alike but a kind that's what
[1:14:06] I'm so concerned about my kind not just
[1:14:10] obviously through similar for the kind
[1:14:13] because a kind if I have seen the kind
[1:14:17] defines both bubbles there was a Nazira
[1:14:22] now suppose you have never seen a mango
[1:14:25] tree all you ever see know is a mango
[1:14:27] seed what what resemblances between the
[1:14:30] seed and the tree never the remote OMSI
[1:14:36] Sarah see the thought I have towards you
[1:14:38] the intentions the potholes you can see
[1:14:45] those thoughts they attribute maybe a
[1:14:48] syncope to proceed so when the pork
[1:14:53] doesn't transform to see God's powers
[1:14:57] God's intention that was in that she
[1:14:59] shows up
[1:15:02] so when you see a mango tree that big
[1:15:06] tree came out of a small seed and the
[1:15:10] scene itself doesn't even look like the
[1:15:12] tree when I was the seed bringing forth
[1:15:17] after its kind and even among mangoes
[1:15:20] there are different species of mangoes
[1:15:25] so what I'm saying that is we all
[1:15:27] Christians by our kind our species
[1:15:31] different who are not just a regular
[1:15:36] Christian can somebody show panel or
[1:15:39] honor no no no you are not a regular
[1:15:42] believer break your tiny difference you
[1:15:45] are God came passing a God can believer
[1:15:48] a God can question Oh somebody shots are
[1:15:51] a lawyer
[1:15:52] somebody shout hallelujah
[1:15:54] [Applause]
[1:16:00] so not just the same what is PC
[1:16:06] machining father we recommend you see
[1:16:12] time and when we hit G time you must be
[1:16:16] a real cedar with a real client to be
[1:16:20] part of this pride our somebody shout
[1:16:22] hallelujah I am so happy praise God we
[1:16:26] are part to see time we're about to kind
[1:16:28] of time but our real time is either see
[1:16:33] God by the word did every creation a
[1:16:37] scene he created it gave me to see then
[1:16:48] he said let every scene out to eat
[1:16:54] now what if you don't know the kind that
[1:17:00] you can take any kind of a seed ah but
[1:17:05] if you're the kind does in that seed so
[1:17:08] so what kind is you see because if you
[1:17:16] don't know you're kind of a see how do
[1:17:20] you know really who you are simply get
[1:17:31] it if you don't know what kind is a seed
[1:17:37] how do you know we knew you are so now
[1:17:40] listen close everything good cricket is
[1:17:44] the Word of God
[1:17:46] call it the punch or the demolish that
[1:17:49] is all the word so they're all like
[1:17:52] seeds because God's Word is a sieve but
[1:17:57] then it came down to where God created
[1:17:59] man in his own image after is unlikely
[1:18:03] it was God's image and go likeness
[1:18:09] that makes him fully complete God if we
[1:18:13] a cute everything that makes God God was

[1:29:13] worship and the angel told the ad Daniel
[1:29:18] with it the beacon as how the how this
[1:29:20] will be like four kingdoms but it shows
[1:29:24] a human government the human spirit the

[1:29:32] brought it way up to 70 43 having a form
[1:29:37] of godliness for a still human that's no
[1:29:44] God their concern is ever
[1:29:47] but what Daniels former typically thus
[1:29:50] was gone come from heaven and smashed
[1:29:54] that image because that was not God's

[1:40:12] God character can handle good and evil
[1:40:17] what God knows doesn't change him we
[1:40:22] don't have that ability is anomic I fell
[1:40:26] for Sookie what if God gives me a gift
[1:40:30] to come behind his puppet in suitable
[1:40:32] scenes to see who is in charge right now
[1:40:36] who just committed on some stuff can I
[1:40:40] handle F or will I go and call the
[1:40:45] pastor's in the pew come you know what
[1:40:47] role I just committed adultery it many
[1:40:58] of us do that we are friends because
[1:41:01] everything goes good and well what if
[1:41:03] something goes wrong can we undo that
[1:41:07] gambit with the friendship in the midst
[1:41:11] of what went wrong you see that text
[1:41:14] corrected
[1:41:18] that is gospel Eto'o somebody shout
[1:41:22] hallelujah that is acting by nature that
[1:41:25] would all said go save the rain or the
[1:41:28] trust and you're just we just had our
[1:41:33] one minute I see wiping out under the
[1:41:35] minister that's a quarter problem so it
[1:41:42] shows where God country was killed to
[1:41:45] see into people's lives what the plan
[1:41:49] will not do that he had such a great to
[1:41:53] see it so people's bad life but the
[1:41:56] angel what him was there confess don't
[1:41:59] say tau run say sometimes you Hawk
[1:42:03] friends wrong people that the Holy Ghost
[1:42:05] told us tells you this mother you're
[1:42:07] jogging has just stopped you behind your
[1:42:09] back but you have to argue with me
[1:42:13] difference from so I can't even tell the
[1:42:17] difference between my friends and my
[1:42:19] enemies that's character
[1:42:26] odd I haven't seen it was a quarter
[1:42:29] character there knows good and evil
[1:42:34] because in this is a catchy we deliver
[1:42:37] you if I don't know what so weak spots
[1:42:40] are what can I handle and God let me see
[1:42:48] you come you spirit on you can I feel
[1:42:51] handily and pray for you I will cut you
[1:42:54] off and said you have a raw spirit
[1:42:58] that one has a raw spirit that part two
[1:43:01] has a rock to it
[1:43:05] [Music]
[1:43:06] that's a colorful issue I wish it never
[1:43:11] seen it never see can we handle it it
[1:43:26] will also see who knows what what's your
[1:43:28] weak spots are you came here tonight
[1:43:29] with such weak spot you intimate eyes
[1:43:31] but can you handle them with all that
[1:43:36] can you see same a child of God God has
[1:43:40] a purpose for me the righteous man
[1:43:43] bullets several times but you rise it up
[1:43:46] again thank you Jesus hallelujah
[1:43:53] hallelujah how do we handle that and
[1:43:58] that is really a claim to rock here from
[1:44:00] forgiveness because God has a proper to
[1:44:04] justify the seed when he said you've
[1:44:08] been to to the first place he wasn't
[1:44:10] talking to your human spirit
[1:44:12] that's the messed up section but you
[1:44:16] have another section another life and
[1:44:20] God is going to transfer you to a
[1:44:23] transfer your mentality but one for your
[1:44:26] ideology from this section to this
[1:44:28] intersection
[1:44:30] [Applause]
[1:44:32] the seed him you have been justified
[1:44:35] that's it cannot seen that scene never
[1:44:39] seen before
[1:44:40] there is nothing against that scene
[1:44:43] [Applause]
[1:44:45] forgiveness has a beginning and it has
[1:44:49] an end when God brings an end to see me
[1:44:53] brings an angel forgiveness so this
[1:44:59] convocation it's not to call you to stay
[1:45:02] and forgiveness does Church but we are
[1:45:06] causing all that to a justify state by a
[1:45:11] sea not just something you imagine by a
[1:45:16] scene now inside my soul and the Holy
[1:45:22] Ghost comes tonight to look for that sea
[1:45:28] so I am NOT in this message to have my
[1:45:30] human spirit mainly cleaned up but I'm
[1:45:36] here to become a new man the new man is
[1:45:43] in the scriptures Paul talks of you all
[1:45:46] man and it talks of a new me you can
[1:45:51] deny that there is an old man who is
[1:45:54] corrupt after his own sinful deeds well
[1:45:57] as a new man that is created in holiness
[1:46:00] and righteousness and that new man comes
[1:46:04] out of your scene that new man cannot

[1:47:41] that's not Church you can't live in that
[1:47:48] city with human spirit you live there
[1:47:49] with your valleys we have been taught
[1:47:56] this through the message you have to
[1:47:59] believe them
[1:48:02] and not fables the accuses of all hi to
[1:48:06] God the bumps is just a change of our
[1:48:13] bodies now let's say you you know what I
[1:48:16] mean when I say that I don't mean to be
[1:48:17] sacrilegious I don't mean to sit hours I
[1:48:20] don't mean to say this church
[1:48:21] I'm a to see every believer Abraham II
[1:48:24] was looking for a promise to son that
[1:48:26] was promised him did I write and the
[1:48:29] church is looking for promise on the
[1:48:31] bride is the bride is looking for the
[1:48:33] promise on before the promised son can
[1:48:35] come to Sarah and Abraham their bodies
[1:48:37] had to be changed if they're like she
[1:48:39] was too old to have a baby
[1:48:41] she had no big veins in a breast a
[1:48:43] breast was dried out her womb was
[1:48:46] entitled was sterile
[1:48:47] she could not have the baby her hat was
[1:48:49] too old Suzanne labor so what happened
[1:48:52] God changed her back to a young woman
[1:48:54] and it did Abraham the same thing cuz
[1:48:57] the said his body was as good as dead
[1:48:59] and he had to change their body in order
[1:49:01] to receive the promised son we cannot
[1:49:03] receive the promise on that promise us
[1:49:05] today in these bodies that we live in
[1:49:07] these bodies are seen the first
[1:49:10] conscience controls this body which see
[1:49:12] it is feel smell here is just goddess or
[1:49:15] scope Allah be wheezing and everything
[1:49:17] else but that new body that comes from
[1:49:20] this born again not this first
[1:49:22] conscience it will pass away is that
[1:49:24] inside something at least able to
[1:49:30] understand that same n it's not this
[1:49:33] coughs I'd cities from smelling here
[1:49:35] it is it it's subject to death and we
[1:49:38] die but the inside part of you down in
[1:49:41] here inside that is the person that
[1:49:43] cannot die is another person that the
[1:49:46] new life strong from this new valve
[1:49:49] listen and it deals and not a person in
[1:49:53] the image of this person you are around
[1:49:56] that life the mystery that means if you
[1:50:03] ever see that because you can be born
[1:50:05] again without the scene
[1:50:07] because you see you can be reborn after
[1:50:11] you're born again you have a life but
[1:50:14] around that life will come another
[1:50:18] posing in the image that means you look
[1:50:23] like you but it would really be you I am
[1:50:32] NOT a person in the image you have to
[1:50:42] believe there man
[1:50:43] so it is the person that goes the
[1:50:46] rupture that is where we preach the

[1:58:44] room of our image we must come back to
[1:58:48] the Holy Spirit slot she the only
[1:58:50] convocations we have bump since the 8th
[1:58:55] is the first when you don't get to the
[1:58:58] eighth without going through 7 so force
[1:59:01] most are 7 days of sacrifice made by
[1:59:04] fire so you come to the siege in the
[1:59:08] Holy Spirit force somebody falls on you
[1:59:12] now we had remaining sacrifices of God
[1:59:14] we do our giving we do our worship but I
[1:59:17] saw fire do it ah all this bloody cans
[1:59:21] forgiveness no fire because if there was
[1:59:24] fire on it the fire takes away the
[1:59:27] brooch let me give you a testimony
[1:59:29] whatever I was it what I did something
[1:59:31] for me that was just back I was so
[1:59:34] empowers my spirit was wounded because I
[1:59:37] was embarrassed in front of my wife well
[1:59:41] I did no more thing when they bagans
[1:59:43] okay I forgot him just to put one into
[1:59:46] action but it with what I was in Paris
[1:59:48] yeah my spirit was wounded I was
[1:59:50] crouched because I felt embarrassed but
[1:59:53] distal to me in front of my wife however
[1:59:58] one so you know I lived with it for
[2:00:01] years I try to do the normal thing as a
[2:00:06] Christian because say fine board

[2:00:14] to home after they anoint here I just
[2:00:18] felt something left me see so I went to
[2:00:21] him I said bro all the schools have been
[2:00:22] doing same coming back to say this is OK
[2:00:24] the truth was I will just will be a
[2:00:26] Christian but in my heart
[2:00:29] because there can be food without
[2:00:32] difference because if a giveness must go
[2:00:37] with fire all this sacrifice is a
[2:00:40] sacrifice to forgive somebody was
[2:00:43] watching is a sacrifice but it must go
[2:00:45] in fire when fire goes we bake the pie

[2:11:37] blessed group to be in these meetings
[2:11:41] to understand about your culture

[2:12:00] you see we have looked at the spoon the
[2:12:03] emotions of faith gets you forgive they
[2:12:05] would understanding so we are deceived
[2:12:08] to think we are forgiven when the
[2:12:11] realest is now there look I don't care
[2:12:16] if you say I forgive you if you still
[2:12:19] feel the heart it has no left you have
[2:12:24] not been forgiven yet and that is why
[2:12:31] our behaviors we say I forgive for
[2:12:33] nothing any changes we still have the
[2:12:37] broader with you say wrong things
[2:12:38] because the truth is we still feel the
[2:12:41] heart it's not gone yet if you dare what
[2:12:50] when we forgiveness comes it takes that
[2:12:55] emotion away I forgive you and then
[2:13:00] principle on the hell of you a cheap
[2:13:03] wine it flows out or somebody shout
[2:13:08] hallelujah and you see in that state
[2:13:12] you're not even asking for repentance
[2:13:14] you're not asking for a payback not
[2:13:19] somebody will be saying well I'll
[2:13:21] forgive him but exactly repent you can
[2:13:25] control their repentance itself is a
[2:13:30] date
[2:13:31] God must give that
[2:13:34] you're on what is for these and not on
[2:13:37] some strings
[2:13:38] I can only forgive him if he comes and
[2:13:41] says sorry you talk like that because
[2:13:45] you still hot
[2:13:46] [Music]
[2:13:50] can somebody say mr. jobs but when that
[2:13:54] feeling comes only my brother
[2:13:56] you don't even clear instead you are
[2:13:57] playing you are seeking how to have that
[2:14:00] brother love comes in your heart it
[2:14:04] becomes a reality you find ways or to
[2:14:07] pull him out and not setting standards
[2:14:11] that can't be made except a those bees
[2:14:15] except she does that suppose it cannot
[2:14:17] do that but how can you go to help him
[2:14:23] to bring him out but I love you
[2:14:28] - I child of God you cannot do that my
[2:14:33] pretense but it elect with something
[2:14:42] can somebody shout hallelujah so I
[2:14:46] understand when these virtues are all
[2:14:48] mental
[2:14:49] they are mental we don't know how to
[2:14:54] feel like and then you first take the
[2:14:58] mental to think that what it is like our
[2:15:04] super espresso powerful messages that I
[2:15:07] can't even leave it's all up here it's
[2:15:13] all mental a mental conception a mental
[2:15:17] idea with no experience so we have to
[2:15:24] switch over before you leave this
[2:15:28] thing's consumer research hallelujah God
[2:15:32] can be to give you spiritual free spirit
[2:15:36] ETSU spiritual knowledge and experience
[2:15:43] [Applause]
[2:15:51] [Applause]
[2:15:52] this is what we call intellectual faith
[2:15:56] that's a human spirit that reasons it
[2:16:01] imagines it and that man has got to die
[2:16:05] and it takes fire to kill the man it
[2:16:10] actually goes to kill their man maybe
[2:16:15] see this so what happened to me in ho
[2:16:25] but Allah kindness was bad into me for
[2:16:28] that situation maybe more tests are
[2:16:32] coming but God let me know about that me
[2:16:34] for that situation that the vaquita
[2:16:39] brother Cheney only I have to be
[2:16:42] realistic
[2:16:45] obviously I have to be honest to say for
[2:16:47] all this while I will say I forgive you
[2:16:49] but in my heart I was still hot I many
[2:16:54] of us don't go past that level we just
[2:16:58] stay on the pretenses whatever give you
[2:17:00] does okay because in your mind your mind
[2:17:06] tells should Apple forgiveness and the
[2:17:11] heart resides
[2:17:13] when bondage
[2:17:17] thank you Jesus Christ what God has put
[2:17:20] it to a holy convocation an appointment
[2:17:25] with God
[2:17:27] these young people know you have it you
[2:17:29] believe this message but it is what wish
[2:17:31] dusty what of the world lordy speaker
[2:17:37] it's a mental thing like metastatic that
[2:17:40] matter Christ was mental they cannot see
[2:17:44] faith what 52 thank you the strength
[2:17:54] everybody feels his plane when strength
[2:17:59] comes only you know he comes only he had
[2:18:05] to go to the upper room on that
[2:18:08] confession that was a true confession
[2:18:10] they will only spoke this morning that
[2:18:13] Christ is the high priest of our
[2:18:14] confession and God give us a true
[2:18:18] confession on the d70 true confession
[2:18:23] for the seven series of who you are
[2:18:28] you're not a chicken you are not a
[2:18:33] sinner
[2:18:33] right side of God why scared of God you
[2:18:39] are not a slave to fear or to bondage
[2:18:43] thank you Jesus that becomes a
[2:18:47] confession where am I going this way
[2:18:52] that God can accompany your faith and
[2:18:57] experience
[2:19:00] this thing should believe becomes
[2:19:02] reality when a man gets the Holy Ghost
[2:19:06] baptism II you want after water made
[2:19:10] manifest
[2:19:11] but you enter into the reality of it the
[2:19:15] war becomes real you feel it because
[2:19:21] there are feelings our reality I don't
[2:19:24] care what you say we are made that way
[2:19:28] you are the fruit of the Spirit is love
[2:19:31] is all with peace but they are all
[2:19:33] emotional but these are the emotions of
[2:19:37] the Holy Spirit and that was out the old
[2:19:40] prophets we are led
[2:19:42] when do we let matters do it comes it
[2:19:47] just one north from God they will know
[2:19:49] they must that the feelings of the
[2:19:52] spirit and somebody shout hallelujah
[2:19:57] somebody shout hallelujah the feelings
[2:20:02] of the Spirit not the Holy Ghost and the
[2:20:08] only go stop with all your evil nature
[2:20:11] because I delphos back on anger is a
[2:20:16] spirit but how do you know anger and
[2:20:19] oscillate you you know how anger feels
[2:20:26] how joy is a spirit but it has a later
[2:20:30] you know how joy feels fornication is a
[2:20:37] speed but it has a major because you
[2:20:40] know how it feels when the feeling comes
[2:20:44] on you it confused the nature of the
[2:20:47] Spirit but is what drives you to the
[2:20:53] action
[2:21:00] versus motions of scenes with their will
[2:21:03] emotions and many of us we understand by
[2:21:10] emotions what we understand the Holy
[2:21:12] Spirit we allow our emotions to tell us
[2:21:19] this little people Joe because don't you
[2:21:22] feel bad about me so I am a bad person
[2:21:28] because your emotions I've give you a
[2:21:31] feeling or what you call bad labra the
[2:21:39] Madam's I said then then you make me a
[2:21:42] pulled out of your feelings of your
[2:21:44] opinions but that's not wholly goes
[2:21:48] these are feelings messed up with good
[2:21:51] and evil so how do you even trust those
[2:21:54] feelings but if the Holy Ghost is there
[2:22:02] when Brown meets Krishna so the prayer
[2:22:04] line branches I think a welcome spirit
[2:22:07] that's how we lose very Christian once
[2:22:12] amix you the Holy Ghost Ellison he feels
[2:22:17] welcome this is very crystal with the
[2:22:20] Holy Ghost man says yes I feel it can
[2:22:27] somebody say Messner and these are
[2:22:29] people you meet for the first time thank
[2:22:33] you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you
[2:22:37] Jesus
[2:22:40] so when these are feelings we are so
[2:22:43] messed up food is good at a blue pail
[2:22:45] and we are cess people by how we feel
[2:22:49] about them
[2:22:51] that's human spirit
[2:22:55] so go toward you love your enemy
[2:23:00] anywhere you feel bad to pray for him
[2:23:04] because when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[2:23:07] you the might be a disabled that's
[2:23:14] what I love the land of the Holy Spirit
[2:23:17] or somebody shout hallelujah somebody
[2:23:21] shout hallelujah thank you Jesus
[2:23:24] the land of the Spirit and that has to
[2:23:33] die I've met plenty of people they don't
[2:23:37] even know who I am
[2:23:39] their feelings tell them Who I am
[2:23:42] and down the road you realize that we
[2:23:45] are just victims of lies from the human
[2:23:48] spirit because sure humans which does
[2:23:53] not know me because I was way back
[2:23:57] before the world began and in that stage
[2:24:00] your human spirit was not there
[2:24:06] can somebody say Amen all these
[2:24:10] revelations are put into you your human
[2:24:12] spirit and they're just to get a
[2:24:13] reasoning you do yourself more harm
[2:24:19] there is another spirit in you that
[2:24:24] Allah seed that was where back there
[2:24:28] and the spirit is a believer now listen
[2:24:34] listen I am in East Wing listen when the
[2:24:38] Holy Ghost comes you start to pray you
[2:24:42] will know tonight if God is going to
[2:24:45] heal you woman said she felt within
[2:24:50] ourselves you might come to me tisha
[2:24:59] might be maybe in this meeting it will
[2:25:00] not happen if I happen to a because many
[2:25:02] many places but faith is like the Holy
[2:25:08] Ghost when you go back to the Holy Ghost
[2:25:09] you know it something comes on you you
[2:25:15] know this has never happened to me have
[2:25:16] a feel of settlement a feeling of

[2:25:40] your heart a feel of settlement a feel
[2:25:43] of satisfaction and we all know where we
[2:25:46] feel satisfied

[3:43:22] so we really thank the Lord for making
[3:43:23] it possible
[3:43:24] when against all odds the enemy fought
[3:43:28] at every hand but this meeting as were
[3:43:31] the context at tonight was a divine
[3:43:32] appointment
[3:43:33] there is no accident in God there is no
[3:43:36] mistake in guarding everything is in
[3:43:39] perfect order and harmony because he has
[3:43:41] been Roberto said there are no books
[3:43:43] there are no surprises who was at this
[3:43:47] meeting God wanted at this meeting and
[3:43:50] whenever God comes down and his people
[3:43:54] come together something has to happen
[3:43:56] and as many of the ministers spoken it
[3:43:59] has been echoed many times we will leave
[3:44:01] this meeting and you will not leave
[3:44:03] empty this word will follow you this
[3:44:06] word and the anointing of the Holy
[3:44:08] Spirit will follow the seed in your soul
[3:44:10] because you didn't put the seed there
[3:44:12] the devil didn't put it there it ever
[3:44:14] can touch it you can't even touch it
[3:44:16] that sea is your identity from before
[3:44:18] there was a moon and before there was a
[3:44:20] star and a couple weeks ago I told the
[3:44:24] church you know we acknowledge God is
[3:44:26] omnipotent we acknowledge he's
[3:44:27] all-powerful but they are certain
[3:44:29] limitations to God they certain things
[3:44:32] that God cannot do he cannot lie he
[3:44:36] cannot make a mistake
[3:44:38] and when he speaks the work and sing us
[3:44:40] it as glut has come to pass and I
[3:44:43] believe in my heart every word that was
[3:44:44] spoken in this meeting is going to come
[3:44:48] to pass the arrow has already left the
[3:44:51] bowl it's on its way your family coming
[3:44:55] back is on its way the Holy Ghost that
[3:44:58] you have been desperate for is on its
[3:45:01] way your healing is on its way your
