[37:47] don't need to tell you to praise because
[37:49] that's why we here we here to beat the
[37:52] devil wherever he is any time any place

[37:59] keep him on his toes we keep him on the
[38:01] Run that's why we here we here to praise
[38:04] and worship but we got a job to do

[38:22] be suffering a little bit tonight from
[38:24] spiritual Amnesia you may have forgotten
[38:27] where you was before tonight you may
[38:29] have forgotten where you came from you
[38:31] may have forgotten who your father was
[38:33] you may have forgotten before the
[38:35] foundation of the Earth was laid when
[38:38] job was asked where were you answer for
[38:41] yourself answer like a man give an
[38:43] account of where you were and he was
[38:46] there he was worshiping like John said
[38:49] he was praising you weren't sad you
[38:51] didn't have bills you didn't have pain
[38:54] you didn't have trials you were giving
[38:56] him worship you were giving him glory
[38:59] you are lifting him up you are causing
[39:01] something to happen back there and
[39:03] that's what you called to do right now
[39:06] you're called to create an atmosphere
[39:08] for the Holy Spirit to dwell so it
[39:10] doesn't matter tonight how you felt
[39:12] walking up the stairs it doesn't matter
[39:15] if somebody brought you or somebody
[39:17] invited you he has something special in
[39:20] store for you tonight that's
[39:21] predestinated for his children that
[39:24] you're predestinated to hear right now
[39:26] at this time you couldn't hear it last
[39:29] week or last month you probably wasn't
[39:31] ready for it but you're going to hear it
[39:33] tonight and he's testing to see how
[39:35] you're going to respond how you're going
[39:37] to act upon his word because you're the
[39:39] believer physically you might be tired
[39:42] it doesn't matter he's speaking to the
[39:45] real you the real you isn't tired the
[39:48] real you says Amen to his word the real
[39:51] you believes every promise line upon
[39:54] line precept upon precept
[39:57] whatever he sets up for you that's the
[40:00] real you saying amen that's the truth so
[40:03] be it unto me like Mary it didn't matter
[40:07] it was hard to explain it may have been
[40:10] hard to believe but that's why we have
[40:12] faith to believe every promise once God
[40:16] said it that settles it I believe it I
[40:19] want to say Amen to his word no doubt we
[40:23] want to be in one mind one Accord not
[40:26] not distress raed not strain with every
[40:29] thought and idea and every new doctrine

[40:34] stay with that oldfashioned sin killing
[40:37] devil chasing oldtime Holy Spirit the S

[40:52] may seem like the boat is rocking it may
[40:55] be it may seem like it's a little
[40:56] uncertain

[41:00] they say he's kept his best souers for
[41:02] this age they say he's got kept his best
[41:06] solders for this time so you could put
[41:08] on the full armor of God and understand
[41:11] the devices of the devil and keep him on
[41:14] his toes we want to stand on his neck

[41:22] all the days of your life like Joshua
[41:25] nothing should stand before you you you

[41:41] devil there is no way he going to drive
[41:43] you into frustration or depression or

[41:49] no no no no no no he didn't give us a
[41:51] spirit of fear but love and power his
[41:56] power is here to back up the devil amen
[42:00] amen amen you all don't get me started
[42:03] tonight you all don't get me started
[42:06] tonight something's going to happen
[42:09] tonight this is not a regular Wednesday
[42:11] night service you may have come
[42:15] expecting things to be routine and
[42:18] normal but the season is changing things
[42:22] are changing from this night forth and
[42:25] forever more he the same yesterday today

[42:48] can be restored tonight nothing could
[42:51] stop it what he has for you will come to
[42:56] pass
[42:59] [Music]
[43:02] amen amen amen amen thank you Jesus you
[43:05] may have your seats but sometimes we get
[43:08] so caught up in what people say about us
[43:11] what the boss has to say what the
[43:14] neighbor say what family thinks how
[43:17] people feel but your role is to worship
[43:20] Him Your Role is to praise him praise
[43:24] him thank him bless him him exalt him
[43:29] lift him up you're here because he is
[43:33] you breathe because he is worrying
[43:36] wouldn't help Waring will not change
[43:39] your
[43:41] circumstance it wouldn't change your
[43:45] [Applause]
[43:49] circumstance let me tell you something
[43:51] I'm not an attorney but in court I could
[43:54] only imagine there are cases that may be
[43:57] called 5 years later or 10 years later
[44:01] you know how the Jud the judicial system
[44:03] works sometime 20 years later and is
[44:06] human to forget so a trained attorney
[44:10] will use triggers or stimuli to cause
[44:13] you to remember and
[44:16] God God is the attorney of
[44:20] attorneys he is the the the Lord of
[44:23] lords and the King of Kings he knows
[44:25] just what to do to bring you back in
[44:28] line so an attorney for example you may
[44:31] have your seat an attorney might say Mr
[44:34] Brown where were you on January 2nd in
[44:37] the evening time and you may say I don't
[44:40] remember but you swear to tell the truth
[44:42] the whole truth nothing but the truth so
[44:44] you don't remember we call that
[44:46] forgetting right it might be human to
[44:48] forget but a trained attorney will say
[44:49] okay you don't remember but Mr Smith was
[44:53] walking down the street with a red
[44:55] jersey on it means nothing to you and
[44:58] then he asks you you know Mr Smith right
[45:01] and you say yes and the rain was falling
[45:04] and he paint a picture for you and all
[45:06] of a sudden you remember oh yes I was
[45:09] there oh yes I was there because he
[45:12] trigger your memory so that's what God
[45:15] wants to do with you tonight he wants to
[45:17] trigger your memory because before you
[45:20] were in sin before you had pain before
[45:23] you had trials and troubles and a
[45:26] headache and worry about your children
[45:28] and your family you were worshiping him
[45:31] you were praising him you are exalting
[45:34] him before you had your mortgage and
[45:36] your bills to pay before you were
[45:39] focused and and and and distracted with
[45:41] the cares of this life you were there
[45:45] before he laid the foundation of the
[45:47] earth you were there because he said who
[45:50] he for knew so he knew you before before
[45:53] you knew yourself before your mother
[45:56] knew you he knew you he had a job for
[45:59] you for such a time as this so the same
[46:02] way a trained attorney will cause you to
[46:05] remember that's the way God works he
[46:08] wants you to
[46:10] remember every promise that he left for
[46:12] you he wants you to remember who you are
[46:15] because from time to time we forget life
[46:18] causes us to forget circumstance causes
[46:21] us to forget situations cause us to
[46:24] forget but he don't want us to forget
[46:26] tonight he want us to remember he want
[46:30] us to move beyond our circumstance and
[46:32] remember his love he said think about
[46:35] his love think about him think about his
[46:39] goodness his faithfulness his Mercy Lord
[46:43] oh my
[46:46] God amen amen
[46:49] amen in a message in a message spiritual
[46:53] Amnesia paragraph 37 the prophet says
[46:56] now this amnesia
[46:57] just when you forget real told is a it
[47:00] caus you to to be in a place where you
[47:03] can't identify yourself remember my
[47:05] title tonight the real
[47:08] you not the facade not the mask not the
[47:12] pretense not what you show the world the
[47:15] real you it causes you to be in a place
[47:19] where you can't identify yourself now
[47:22] it's it's an unusual thing he said it
[47:24] don't happen too often but the cause
[47:27] is from
[47:29] shock it's sometimes you don't even know
[47:31] who they are you find it from Wars
[47:34] sometimes solders get it sometimes
[47:37] people get it another thing causes it is
[47:40] worry worry will cause it worry has no
[47:43] virtue to it at all yeah just just skip
[47:46] worry and accept Faith that's what the
[47:49] prophet said skip worry accept Faith
[47:53] someone said well now what if you're
[47:55] you're going to be shot in the morning
[47:57] wouldn't you worry I said no don't think
[48:01] so
[48:02] why said worry couldn't do nothing but
[48:05] make it
[48:06] worse woo well what good is it going to
[48:10] do to have faith that's the question
[48:13] because you believe you'll be shot in
[48:14] the morning you believe you'll be fired
[48:17] tomorrow you believe you'll be put out
[48:19] tomorrow you believe they'll cut your
[48:21] lights tomorrow here's what he says he
[48:23] said worry couldn't do nothing but make
[48:26] it worse amen and he asked so what faith
[48:29] going to do he said it might deliver me
[48:33] and that's right see so worry has no
[48:36] virtue to it at all but faith has only
[48:39] virtue believe now worry sometime causes
[48:43] it referring to Amnesia paragraph 223 he
[48:47] said you that won the Holy Spirit you
[48:50] that won that experience not an
[48:52] emotional excitement you wanton the Holy
[48:55] Ghost the Life The Germ of Life inside
[48:59] you and you want to get rid of that
[49:01] Amnesia that's making you you can't
[49:04] identify yourself you don't know where
[49:06] to stand you don't know what you are
[49:09] let's get rid of it right now there is a
[49:12] new birth here for you a real genuine
[49:15] New Birth amen how many of you won that
[49:18] new birth tonight won that new birth get
[49:22] rid of that Amnesia so you know where I
[49:25] come from you know no way you're going
[49:28] nobody could fool you nobody could trick
[49:30] you amen amen amen
[49:34] amen thank you Jesus thank you Lamb of
[49:38] God now I quickly want to move through I
[49:41] don't want to keep you too long but in a
[49:43] message Paradox the prophet talks about
[49:47] sincerity right he was speaking about
[49:49] the vision with the the mama the
[49:53] snake and I will just just gloss over it
[49:56] all right and in in paragraph 63 it says
[49:59] and then he's talking different snakes
[50:01] before and he says and then then comes a
[50:03] mber he's death just when he's so fast
[50:07] you can't see him he goes over over the
[50:09] top of weeds and propels himself with
[50:13] with the back of his tail just whoosh
[50:15] and he's gone hits you in the face
[50:17] usually stands up high and Strikes hard
[50:20] and when he hits you you got just a few
[50:22] breaths till you're finished that's what
[50:25] the devil wants to do he wants to hit
[50:27] you so hard he want to sift you like
[50:28] wheat he want to knock you down he want
[50:30] to steal kill destroy he want to to
[50:33] devour you tonight like the Mamba he say
[50:36] and when he hits you you got a few
[50:38] breaths till you finish turn real it it
[50:40] don't only paralyze getting the
[50:42] bloodstream it gets nerves everything
[50:44] you just die in a few
[50:47] seconds them native boys and track boys
[50:49] you can say m and they'll put their
[50:52] heads together scream cuz it's death
[50:54] just in a few seconds just the word m
[50:58] will elicit so much fear that they will
[51:01] run it's that serious and he goes on to
[51:04] talk about in this this Vision the M was
[51:07] crossing the road coming towards him and
[51:09] then it stopped it couldn't get at him
[51:12] but then it turned to his
[51:14] friend in paragraph 65 he said he turned
[51:16] and looks at my friend and away he went
[51:18] after my friend and I seen my friend
[51:21] just jumping way in the air and over him
[51:23] and over him and over him trying the
[51:25] thing was striking at him keep in mind
[51:27] this is death if it strikes you in
[51:29] seconds and I'm going to go down in in
[51:32] in he said if that serpent ever strikes
[51:35] it'll kill
[51:36] him and just then the serpent turned on
[51:39] me speaking about the prophet when I
[51:42] said that he looked at me again so he
[51:44] changed direction from his friend to
[51:47] readjust to him he say he looks at me
[51:50] and a voice came from above me and said
[51:52] you have been given the power to bind
[51:55] him amen the words or any I said well
[51:58] God what must I do he said there is one
[52:01] thing you must do you must be more
[52:03] sincere see you must be more sincere now
[52:06] this is the prophet now this is not you
[52:08] and I this is the prophet and God said
[52:11] through a voice he said you must be more
[52:13] sincere if you want to bind the mber cuz
[52:16] this is death itself death in seconds am
[52:18] amen he said well God forgive me for my
[52:21] uninc and let me have sincerity and when
[52:25] I raise up my hands to him there was
[52:27] something great come over me just lifted
[52:29] me up seems like my whole body was
[52:32] charged with something I looked at the
[52:34] serpent and then he started towards me
[52:37] now getting more sincerity didn't bind
[52:39] him am but it give him the power to bind
[52:42] it at that point he said I looked at the
[52:45] serpent he start towards me and he
[52:47] couldn't do it yet and I said Satan in
[52:51] the name of the Lord Jesus I bind you
[52:53] and the serpent of blue smoke flew out
[52:55] of him and he Cur and made a sign like a
[52:58] s capital S made backwards like a an
[53:02] sign and it means buy this one or or
[53:06] anything below him cuz he was the worst
[53:08] blue smoke fell out of him and his tail
[53:11] choked his own self to death and he went
[53:14] on and and going over to to par to to
[53:17] paragraph 71 he
[53:19] said he he caused the mber to be raised
[53:23] and died again in the vision and he says
[53:26] a voice came again and said you can
[53:27] unbind him right so he said then Satan
[53:32] that I might know that this is the real
[53:34] power of God I unbind you and of course
[53:37] the Mamba came back to life and with
[53:39] that same power he caused the Mamba to
[53:41] be bounded again and he said when he was
[53:44] bounded again just running through he
[53:47] says the snake choked himself right back
[53:49] again and turned to
[53:50] Crystal but then when he did that that
[53:53] voice said now you must be more sincere
[53:57] than what you are to do
[53:59] this then he left me and I was standing
[54:02] in the room so in this Vision he saw
[54:06] himself through
[54:08] sincerity using the power of God to bind
[54:11] and loose amen amen given the power over
[54:16] what was death itself sure that in
[54:17] seconds amen amen and God was showing if
[54:22] he had to do that that power could only
[54:24] be expressed through
[54:27] sincerity so it calls for us to be more
[54:31] sincere we can't afford to operate the
[54:34] same way we operate yesterday am and the
[54:37] day before we have to be more vulnerable
[54:41] more open more honest more surrendered
[54:44] to God with such a contrite and broken
[54:47] Spirit a contrite heart that we can lay
[54:50] it all on the feet of Jesus so we could
[54:53] be more sincere so we can have power to
[54:56] bind and to loose
[54:59] amen it goes on in a message
[55:03] thirst and said it doesn't matter who
[55:05] you are whether you're a deacon a Usher
[55:08] a pastor a elder god is no respector of
[55:11] persons amen and in that message she
[55:13] spoke and it's a familiar story about
[55:16] the Sunday school
[55:18] teacher and it says she taught Sunday
[55:20] school paragraph 227 she taught Sunday
[55:23] school and all her of her little Sunday
[55:26] school group came in they wanted to see
[55:28] her when she went off to Heaven because
[55:30] she was sick she had a social disease
[55:32] and she was in hospital awaiting her
[55:34] death sentence awaiting to die certain
[55:36] death the doctors already declared her
[55:38] dead knowing that was sure so her Sunday
[55:42] school children came to the hospital you
[55:44] know to see her off because she was all
[55:46] right you heard who she was the teacher
[55:48] in Sunday school she had a post and a
[55:51] position she was faithful in church
[55:53] every Sunday all the time she came on a
[55:55] Wednesday night she had a Pew almost
[55:58] designated because of who she was but
[56:01] look at what happened in the story amen
[56:04] hallelujah you say the children wanted
[56:07] to see when she went off to Heaven they
[56:10] wanted to see the Angels come and pack
[56:11] her away because she was a nice Sunday
[56:14] school
[56:15] teacher her pastor outside smoking a
[56:18] cigarette walking up and down the hall
[56:20] in the hospital there a Pentecost Ali
[56:23] leader of a big church fancy pews all
[56:27] the the bells and whistles amen and they
[56:29] was all going to sing when she was going
[56:32] to die you know they know she had to Die
[56:34] the doctor said she was dying so they
[56:37] was all going to see the Angels come
[56:39] pack her way and all at once when she
[56:42] face the reality we talk about the real
[56:45] you so this wasn't the Sunday school hat
[56:48] on this was the real yes sir when she
[56:52] face her
[56:55] reality
[56:57] she was a loyal church member amen she
[57:00] was a Sunday school teacher amen loyal
[57:03] church member of a big fine

[59:06] something considered illegal and you
[59:08] were to say you know I really didn't
[59:10] know that I was not supposed to be on
[59:12] the bus route you know what they tell
[59:14] you they say ignorance is no excuse sir
[59:17] am because you don't know it doesn't

[59:28] your place of aboard you could change
[59:30] your location you could change your name

[59:39] you can change jobs you can change
[59:41] relationships you could change titles it
[59:44] doesn't change who you are so there was
[59:46] a man one time in a message have not I
[59:49] sent thee his name was Gideon paragraph
[59:52] 54 it says now Gideon when he was out
[59:55] there trash in his this week no doubt
[59:57] but that prophet's message was going
[59:58] through his heart what that Prophet said
[1:00:01] I'm the god of Abraham Isaac Jacob I'm
[1:00:04] the one that brought you out of Egypt
[1:00:06] I'm the one that give you what you've
[1:00:08] got turn to me there he and his father
[1:00:11] are there trashing this wheat and an
[1:00:13] angel came to him or he thought it was
[1:00:15] an angel it happened to turn out it
[1:00:17] wasn't an angel it was God himself CU
[1:00:21] it's capital l r d you see and when he
[1:00:24] spoke to Gideon Gideon was a little
[1:00:26] surprised and we know the story he said
[1:00:28] now Mighty Man of Valor he didn't know
[1:00:31] he was he was living in denial he didn't
[1:00:34] recognize who he was he didn't realize
[1:00:37] who the real Gideon was he thought he
[1:00:40] was just doing normal living he thought
[1:00:44] he was just going through the motions he
[1:00:46] was doing what he was taught he didn't
[1:00:48] know reality was he was a mighty man of
[1:00:51] Valor when he looked in the mirror of
[1:00:53] the word it said Mighty Man of Valor it
[1:00:57] wasn't what his brothers Tau it wasn't
[1:00:59] what the the the other tribes thought
[1:01:01] about his family it wasn't important
[1:01:04] what he was told what was important was
[1:01:07] what God had assigned to him God said
[1:01:10] thou Mighty Man of Valor he didn't know
[1:01:12] who he was and the prophet said maybe
[1:01:15] you don't know who you are you might be
[1:01:18] many of those Mighty Men tonight and I
[1:01:21] say right here tonight you might be
[1:01:24] Mighty Men of Valor it's a night setting
[1:01:27] here you're saying the little church
[1:01:29] small group like we gathered here
[1:01:31] tonight oh my there was only two there
[1:01:34] him and his daddy there only has to be
[1:01:37] two you and Christ that's all it takes
[1:01:41] to be a mighty man of Valor that's right
[1:01:44] now the first thing you know what
[1:01:45] happened as soon as he spoke to Gideon
[1:01:48] thou Mighty Man of Valor call him what
[1:01:51] he could do he said n Lord n Lord living
[1:01:54] in denial but you you know what it
[1:01:56] didn't change his reality his denial
[1:02:00] didn't change the reality of who he was
[1:02:04] the reality was he was a mighty man of
[1:02:08] [Applause]
[1:02:10] Valor but you know there are times when
[1:02:14] your circumstance causes you to forget I
[1:02:17] remember
[1:02:18] Jacob Jacob as we know he fooled his
[1:02:22] father to get the birth right we will
[1:02:25] say he out smart at his brother to get
[1:02:27] the birth right he say Jacob I love Esau
[1:02:31] I Jacob I love you love a smart man amen
[1:02:36] oh God so a smart man Hallelujah but you
[1:02:39] see after time sometimes you forget you
[1:02:43] forget what you did you forget what you
[1:02:45] went through the children of Israel did
[1:02:48] that all the time after a while the
[1:02:50] living was so good they forgot God they
[1:02:53] forgot what happened how he brought them
[1:02:55] up out how with a mighty hand he he he
[1:02:59] heard he you know he put his hands
[1:03:01] around them and and brought them out of
[1:03:03] the the bondage of the enemy sometimes
[1:03:06] they forget so Jacob was like that he
[1:03:08] had increase in his flux he had his
[1:03:11] family he had his his men around him he
[1:03:14] had such wealth and you know he he moved
[1:03:17] a particular way I could only imagine
[1:03:19] the way he operated he probably forgot
[1:03:22] he outsmarted somebody he probably
[1:03:24] forgot that he fooled his father
[1:03:26] he probably forgot what had transpired
[1:03:28] before but you know what there came a
[1:03:31] time and and in the message I'll get
[1:03:33] into the second it says as I thought on
[1:03:35] my ways yes when you think on your ways
[1:03:37] you kind of remember God sometimes
[1:03:40] triggers he he sends a stimuli to
[1:03:44] solicit or elicit a response from you
[1:03:47] amen so when he thought about it he
[1:03:49] realize wait a minute my brother
[1:03:52] Esau have great rich too he have family
[1:03:58] he have flock he have soldiers he have
[1:03:59] men he have servants he have things just
[1:04:01] like me and I have to meet him I can't
[1:04:04] avoid him I have to meet him so you know
[1:04:07] what I have to face
[1:04:10] reality I can't live in denial
[1:04:13] Hallelujah I can't operate like it
[1:04:14] didn't
[1:04:15] happen I need something more I need to
[1:04:19] be more sincere Hallelujah I need to be
[1:04:21] more open more vulnerable I need to be
[1:04:23] more aware I need to have such such a
[1:04:25] relationship with God that I have no
[1:04:28] fear that I could walk unbothered you
[1:04:30] know some people they walk with their
[1:04:31] head down all the time they walk because
[1:04:33] they realize guilt and shame and and
[1:04:35] embarrassment and things weigh on them
[1:04:38] but you want to be free you want to be
[1:04:39] loose if if you want to be loose tonight
[1:04:42] just lift your hands right now do
[1:04:44] something different because God is here
[1:04:47] to free you from bondage free you from
[1:04:50] guilt and shame and Circumstance and and
[1:04:53] things that that were told to you as a
[1:04:55] child things that that warp your mind
[1:04:57] things that have you
[1:04:59] confused and in paragraph 39 of that
[1:05:02] that message as I thought on my ways it
[1:05:06] says there might be many in here
[1:05:08] tonight is thinking about going home old
[1:05:12] age is catching up on you sickness has
[1:05:14] got you in a grip better think on your
[1:05:16] ways before you get
[1:05:19] there and as Jacob on his way with his
[1:05:21] wife and children he heard a message
[1:05:23] coming that Esau with a great answer was
[1:05:26] coming to meet him and he began to think
[1:05:28] on his ways the way he' done
[1:05:31] Esau cheated him and it drove him to
[1:05:34] prayer all night
[1:05:37] am you
[1:05:38] know if love doesn't do it conditions
[1:05:41] will so it drove him to prayer sure he
[1:05:44] might have prayed before but this kind
[1:05:47] of prayer was that kind of earnest
[1:05:49] prayer where you're driven to prayer
[1:05:51] it's not your choice you don't have a
[1:05:53] say in the matter you have to do it
[1:05:55] because his circumstance seems so dire
[1:05:58] you have to do
[1:06:01] it he wrestled with the angel of the
[1:06:04] Lord I trust tonight that men and women
[1:06:06] boys and girls who has neglected the
[1:06:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't know
[1:06:11] how near you are to home and that
[1:06:14] applies to anybody I trust that you'll
[1:06:17] put purpose in your heart that you'll
[1:06:19] wrestle with the angel of the Lord and
[1:06:21] not let him go until you're blessed when
[1:06:23] the angel of the Lord touch Jacob he
[1:06:26] walked different from then on he was a
[1:06:29] big fine running coward on one side but
[1:06:33] a limping Prince on the other side of
[1:06:36] the brook you walk different you think
[1:06:39] different he wasn't afraid to meet Esau
[1:06:43] then because he had wrestled with the
[1:06:45] angel think on your
[1:06:49] ways
[1:06:52] amen I know I said it before don't want
[1:06:55] to song done done but in
[1:06:58] influence I think it says your
[1:07:00] circumstance doesn't Define you you know
[1:07:03] there are lots of people they they they
[1:07:05] make excuses based on where they are
[1:07:06] where they came from so they'll tell you
[1:07:08] I grew up in a hot spot I didn't know
[1:07:10] how my father was I don't know what love
[1:07:13] was I never had things as a child I had
[1:07:16] it tough I had I had a struggle all my
[1:07:18] life I had to fight for everything I
[1:07:20] have and sometimes they make excuses but
[1:07:23] get this once again I Don't Preach for
[1:07:25] my own thoughts I I I don't speak my own
[1:07:28] ideas and my opinions this is God's word
[1:07:31] amen so you know this already so I want
[1:07:34] you to say Amen because you know it
[1:07:36] already many years ago paragraph 62 in
[1:07:39] the message influence when they used to
[1:07:41] have slavery in the South you know where
[1:07:43] I'm going they down Kentucky and Alabama
[1:07:46] and down where I come from they used to
[1:07:48] take the color and auction them off at
[1:07:51] the auction block just like if you had
[1:07:53] used cars or something I believe no man
[1:07:56] is to be a slave God made man and man
[1:07:59] made slave and they used to come by and
[1:08:01] buy them just like you'll buy a used
[1:08:04] car get the bill of sale and so forth
[1:08:07] that was a terrible thing so there one
[1:08:10] day there was a buyer come by he came by
[1:08:13] a broker by a old plantation that had
[1:08:16] many slaves and said how many
[1:08:19] slaves yeah he said how many
[1:08:23] slaves you got
[1:08:26] he said oh around 150 out there I guess
[1:08:30] said could I go out and look over them
[1:08:32] he said sure help yourself so he went
[1:08:34] out and look over the slaves and when he
[1:08:37] looked around he noticed them fellows
[1:08:39] always they were sad now slavery wasn't
[1:08:41] a nice thing can you imagine working on
[1:08:43] the duress every day every day this
[1:08:47] wasn't a than God is Friday weekend
[1:08:49] thing every single day as the the night
[1:08:52] follows the day you were a slave you
[1:08:55] were forced to work and do things that
[1:08:57] otherwise you would not have done
[1:08:59] sometimes under the task Master's rule
[1:09:02] sometimes under real abhorent conditions
[1:09:05] somehow in the cold in the heat whatever
[1:09:09] the temperature was whatever the the
[1:09:11] climate the circumstance was you didn't
[1:09:13] have a choice in the matter because you
[1:09:14] was a
[1:09:15] slave and in this case when he went to
[1:09:18] look at them he noticed them fellows
[1:09:20] were always
[1:09:22] sad they the boys brought them over from
[1:09:25] Africa and unloaded them in Cuba out
[1:09:27] there and send them out here to the
[1:09:28] South and sold them for slaves and they
[1:09:30] knowed they'd never go back home you
[1:09:32] know what that's like to know that no
[1:09:34] matter what you will never see home
[1:09:37] again you will never go back home this
[1:09:40] was their reality this was their
[1:09:43] circumstance and they know they'd never
[1:09:46] go back
[1:09:47] home they know they'd never see their
[1:09:49] father and mother no more their children
[1:09:52] husband wives and so on they were a
[1:09:55] victim of circumstance that they didn't
[1:09:57] make themselves and here they was away
[1:09:59] from home and sad and sometimes they'd
[1:10:02] have to take whips and whip them just
[1:10:03] like they do a beast cattle and ox and
[1:10:05] horses and things and they to make them
[1:10:08] work they make them work and this they
[1:10:12] notice this young broker noticed there
[1:10:14] was one of those slaves they didn't have
[1:10:17] to whip him they didn't have to do it my
[1:10:21] he had his chin
[1:10:24] up his shoulders
[1:10:27] back he was really right on the mark all
[1:10:30] the time up to standard all the time he
[1:10:34] didn't pretend you know you know my
[1:10:36] father has a saying you always say he
[1:10:38] used to say across the board you are who
[1:10:40] you are across the board if you're late
[1:10:43] you're late if you're messy you're messy
[1:10:45] but this slave was different he made and
[1:10:49] met the mark all the time he had one
[1:10:52] standard one operation
[1:10:56] Hallelujah he said they didn't have to
[1:10:58] to be doing anything to him Hallelujah
[1:11:01] he had the job done so the owner of the
[1:11:04] slave said the broker said to this owner
[1:11:06] I'd like to buy that
[1:11:08] slave he said oh no said he's not for
[1:11:12] sale he said well why he ain't for sale
[1:11:15] said what you said what you do to make
[1:11:19] him that
[1:11:20] way why
[1:11:22] despite the fact that he came from
[1:11:25] circumstances that he wasn't in control
[1:11:27] of Hallelujah could any good thing come
[1:11:30] out of
[1:11:30] Nazareth could any good thing come out
[1:11:32] of lavant tail or cot or beat or Maloney
[1:11:36] or wherever from from some well-known
[1:11:39] hot spot right where they say you are
[1:11:42] prone to criminal activity no no no no
[1:11:45] no this person this slave despite his
[1:11:48] circumstance operated differently that's
[1:11:52] the way we are called we are in this
[1:11:54] world but not off this this
[1:11:56] world he came down listen God knew us he
[1:12:00] knew our faults our bad our our failes
[1:12:03] our shortcomings he came down in the
[1:12:05] dirt and in the mud to pick us up and
[1:12:08] still love us still send his son to shed
[1:12:11] his blood to redeem us to pay a price to
[1:12:14] set us free so we could have access to
[1:12:18] Redemption so we can be perfect so we
[1:12:21] can be adopted he went past all that and
[1:12:24] this show that despite the circumstance
[1:12:27] they asked listen do you feed them
[1:12:29] different than the rest of them he said
[1:12:32] no they all ate out in the galley they
[1:12:35] all were together he's just a slave he
[1:12:38] said what makes him act different than
[1:12:40] the rest of them he said and you know it

[1:34:51] say this when he had wasted all his
[1:34:54] living we know the story The Father's
[1:34:56] living with writers living and when he

[1:35:04] come to himself you know what that means
[1:35:07] he recognized who he was he understood
[1:35:11] that he wasn't defined by where he was

[1:35:17] eating pig food that didn't make him a
[1:35:19] pig amen as it say you standing in a
[1:35:23] garage doesn't make you a car amen so he

[1:35:34] matter where he went where he was he was
[1:35:38] always a son and when he come unto
