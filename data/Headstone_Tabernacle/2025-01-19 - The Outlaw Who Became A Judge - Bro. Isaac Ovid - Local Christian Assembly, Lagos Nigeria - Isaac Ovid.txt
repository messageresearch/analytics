morning may you bless every brother bless every sister Lord may you bless the pastor of this church brother hu and his wife and family Lord the ministry the deacons the helps and the governments may you anoint this church may you anoint every brother every sister Lord every visitor in our gates anyone that may be connected father May the Holy Ghost speak to your people in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen and amen before you take your seats if we could just turn to two portions of scripture then I'll do the greetings so let's read from Jeremiah 1 I'm reading Verses 4 and five and we also be going to the book of Hebrews Hebrews 11 very familiar scriptures Jeremiah 1 and reading verse 4 then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee Hallelujah and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctify thee thee and I ordain thee a prophet unto the Nations reading Hebrews 11 from verse 1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God among excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speak it by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him let's go down to verse 3030 by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith the har of Rahab perished not with them that believe not when she had received the spies with peace and what shall I more say for time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of jeffa of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness of obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raise to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings ye moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were toned they were sown aunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat sins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy that's a powerful statement in other words the world was not worthy to contain these men the world was not worthy to contain them so they were living in the world but the world was not worthy of them because they were from another place and I believe this morning we are speaking to Sons and Daughters of God of whom this world is not even worthy you what trials have you find you has not even be this world is not worthy for you can the church say Amen of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received n the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated hallu so I bring greetings to you this morning in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it is certainly a great privilege and an honor to be here in Lagos once again I feel at home I have been a part of this church for a very long time so it's good to be home it's good to be in the house of the Lord and I bring greetings from Trinidad and Tobago from The Headstone Tabernacle from Brother ID sister ID the ministry at headstone t tacle we love you very much we appreciate you very much I want to thank brother Olu for the opportunity to stand before the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ and we certainly salute him and appreciate him for his stand uh in such a time as this I really appreciate the specials the Sunday school special that was really really a blessing and Sister Mary I think it's the first time I'm hearing Sister Mary sing Sister Mary God bless you thank you for the special and the choir truly a blessing amen we are happy to be here in the house of God in such a time as this you know the prophet told us that one day the last song Will Be Sung one day we'll have the last service and there's coming a time when we I believe we are close to having the last service because the whole objective of this great gospel was not to for us to build churches or have church Gatherings it's to bring us to Perfection it's bring us to a manifestation of the sons of God and I believe as we are nearing The Headstone we are coming to see a super Church a super race a church on fire a church on the power of God and a church where there are individuals who could stand alone when nobody else is around them because there's a seed in their soul that speaks that speaks for them that comes from God and goes back to God can the church say Amen so I'm excited for what God is doing what God has done and what God is about to do and I believe that we are so privileged to be called in such a time as this to be seeing what we see and to be hearing what we hear and yes there are trials and yes there are problems and and it seems sometimes that there are more trials and more problems than we ever expected to encounter but these are the trials and the testings and the problems that are preparing us to leave here God has got to give us a reason to call more for him God has got to give us a reason to depend on him some more a reason to trust in him some more can the church say Amen blessed be the name of the Lord so I have a title this morning the outlaw who became a judge and an inspiration the Divine mystery of your spiritual identity Hallelujah the outlaw who became a judge and an inspiration the Divine mystery of your spiritual identity and you know one of the thing I love about God is God loves to take broken people my God hallelujah and use broken people amen for some reason God doesn't like to look at the people who look like they're okay he likes to find the people who are looking like they're in a real struggle and take them to show the devil he could take anybody and use them to do anything he wants to do Hallelujah I preached some years ago when you look at the genealogy of God in Matthew 1 he could have chosen anybody but he choose the Harlot Rahab to pass through can the church say amen he could have choose Sister Sarah or sister Mary but he went to find a prostitute to show that he could include anybody he wants into the economy of God it doesn't matter their history it doesn't matter their lineage it doesn't matter their DNA it doesn't matter who their grandfather was who their father was whether they had money or no money if God wants to use you he doesn't need anybody's permission the sovereignty of God allows him to choose who he wants to use and use them the way he wants to use them isn't God good he could take somebody who's tall somebody who is short somebody from the east of Nigeria or the west of Nigeria he can take somebody from America or he can take them from Brazil God doesn't have to ask permission to give you the Holy Ghost he doesn't have to ask permission to fill you he doesn't have to ask permission to deliver you he doesn't have to ask per Mission because he's Sovereign and that's the mystery of your spiritual identity we read the scripture in Jeremiah before you even born there was a purpose over your life uh your purpose didn't start when you were born your purpose sat before you were even here your purpose was already written you are walking in the story of your purpose glory to God and because of your purpose God put you in a family Hallelujah and he listen God designed your family for your purpose he design your trial for your purpose he designed everything you go through to make sure that you are here this morning you couldn't miss this service if you wanted to you couldn't miss this message if you wanted to you couldn't miss this call if you wanted to whatever you tried to do had to bring you to this spot bring you to this experience can the church say [Applause] Amen in the message Christ is a Myster of God revealed and M laying background we're going to have a bit of a Sunday school if that's okay is this is is that all right a little bible study in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Bram said now God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living in that you will understand very clearly I believe what is being done can the church say amen and I've said it many times God is a mystery the world is a mystery and this mystery of God was so big that God had to unfold this mystery over multiple Generations uh he couldn't just give it in one because he was too big he was too powerful this Bible oh my only contains part of who he is he said those things which are revealed they belong to us but the secret things belong unto God they are aspects of God that we are only coming to now realize but reality is this God is a mystery and he existed alone we know this he wanted to express himself uh because he is omnipotent he is omnicient he is all powerful he is bigger than our problems he's bigger than our situations uh he's Jehovah Gyra Jehovah nii Jehovah shama Jehovah situ he is El Shai he is the breasted one he's a everpresent helping time of trouble he is I am that I am he is Alpha and Omega he's the beginning and the end he's the first and the last he's the fairest of 10,000 he's a lily of the valley he's a bright and Morning Star there's no one like him there was no one before him like him there'll be no one after him like him he is God all by himself he doesn't need help to be God he is just God and he is the object of our worship Our Praise doesn't make him God he is [Applause] God he could do what he wants he is Sovereign he could heal you while this service is happening he could deliver your son while you are here your presence here can change what's happening in your home but God never wanted to remain a mystery this mystery is so great I'm just laying a foundation to get to my text he didn't want to be complicated you don't need a degree to understand him you don't need to be an engineer to understand him you don't need to be a doctor to understand them he's a uncomplicated God he wanted anybody to talk to him and you could reach him at any time you don't need a good Network to reach him you don't need electricity to reach him you don't need money in your bank to reach him you don't need to line up to reach him you don't need to ask permission to reach him you could reach him at any time Jesus on the main line you could tell him what you want if you need a holy ghost you could tell him what you want can the church say Amen I'm just testing the temperature I'm just making sure brother Jesse I'm just making sure I'm in church because the pist David I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord hallelujah you got to realize when you come into the house of God you leave everything on the outside listen what is to happen in the world is going to happen you know but we in the bride we are are the ones to determine the course of history determine the next steps can the church say [Applause] Amen you may be seated when David was living when Moses was living when when Abraham was living they did not even understand exactly what they were living out it is only years later we could look back and we could understand what part of the mystery they were actually unfolding and what piece of the puzzle they actually fit into it is impossible many times when Joseph was in prison he wasn't thinking that this is the best place to be but only when we look back we can see the type of prison to power can the church say amen when Jonah was in the belly of the fish he wasn't happy to be there but when Jesus come he could tie himself to as Jonah was in that situation so shall can the church say Amen so you got to realize your trial your family situation it's by design it is God's purpose uh that you get the Holy Ghost that you come to adoption that you come to Perfection that seven Living Voices will come from inside of your life that's the Thunder thank you that shakes the devil you may be seated I haven't sat I want to get to but I just want to just kind of lay a foundation so when Joshua walked the Earth he was explain the attribute of the warrior in God when Elijah walked the Earth he was explain the attribute as a prophet when Paul that was an apostle but every single piece was coming together for this great mystery of God and that mystery is tied to your identity because it's very easy when we get into trouble when we get into a situation we are not in the presence of church and we are in our jobs or we're in the neighborhood or we are in the taxi or whatever that looks like that we sometimes forget who we are and that is tied to your spiritual identity and understanding your spiritual identity you may be seated what is your identity by definition identity is the fact of being who or what a person or thing is it is the distinguishing character or personality of an individual there are some people when they shout a certain way without you having to look back you know who's shouting that's right Hallelujah and I I I I don't think but the cosos is here but but the cosmos has a way that he says yeah yeah yeah yeah and and when you hear that you don't need to look around to know he's in the building because that's part of his identity can I anybody in the house this [Applause] morning your identity who you are your characteristics your ability your nature your potential your real izations your achievements your failures your victories your ups and downs is all tied to your identity they are skills that you possess that nobody on the earth possesses and it's part of your identity what God put in you he didn't put in a person next to you because he wanted that to be a part of your [Applause] identity you identity is the real you your identity is beyond your physical appearance if you were to go tomorrow and do plastic surgery if brother Cosmos forgive me I use me example were to go and change his face when he comes back to church and you hear the you say that's still him can the church say Amen so you could try to change your face you could try to change your school you could try to change your home but who you are is still who you are can the church say Amen your bank account is not your identity your job is not an [Applause] identity can the church say Amen before you are an accountant you are a priest before you are an engineer you are a priest before you are a doctor you are a priest before you go to work you are priest first everything else after you are royal priest that's your identity that's why we worship that's why we pray that's why we come to church because we are part of a royal [Applause] priesthood can the church say amen that's why we have faith that's why we shout and because it's who we are you can't help your identity can the church say Amen am you may be seated amen I've used the example in the UK the royal family Prince Harry Prince William whatever they are when they are born they don't know who they are but the moment they are born there's security assigned to them there's property and title there's an inheritance assigned to them before they could even speak they have an inheritance you don't hear me this morning before they could even creep there's a car with their name on [Music] it before they can feed them themselves they have restaurants that they can eat for free for the rest of their lives it's tied to their identity and you got to know your identity I don't care what you have now your identity is bigger than what you have now your identity is bigger than your problem can the church say Amen Give the Lord a shout of praise [Applause] Hallelujah brother the chick boo we about 95% there just testing the temperature brother brandham said in the deity of Jesus Christ that's right men and woman it's time that we found out who you are the devil is trying to hide you back so if the devil could keep you trapped in the economy trapped in the problems listen we can spend a lot of time talking about the problems but I prefer to ask questions about how does God's economy work because they are principles to his economy I don't have money for the doctor but the great physician how do I get to the Great physician I don't have money for surgery but the great physician is able to perform surgery even so much he said missing limbs will be restored I don't know any doctor in a America Nigeria or Europe who could put a missing limb back but a great [Applause] physician he is more than able to open the blind eyes the prophet said before the doctor hand touches my wife in other words before they even do surgery before the doctor's hand touches my wife that tomb has got to go down can the church say amen and that same Jesus that same angel that same Holy Ghost is here this [Applause] morning that's right men and women it's time that be found out who you are the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that you're some little cow down something you're not you're Sons and Daughters of God listen to The Prophet the deity is not in heaven it's in you that's a big one he said the deity is done in heaven it's in you greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world greater is he that's in you than he that's in your job greater is he that's in you than what's in the doctor's report greater is he that's in you than what's happening with your son this morning greater is he that's in you that's bigger than the problem with your daughter this morning we serve notice every back seting young person is going to be restored we speak it we declare it we claim it so shall it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] be brother brand in this same quote he said the deity is not in heaven it's in you Hallelujah he said I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God lives in you immortal life my life I gave Zoe the life of God is in the human being can the church say Amen so your purpose is connected to who you are your destiny is connected to who you are you may be seated your ability is connected to who you are you may be seated so many young people say well I've worked so hard for what I have achieved all right but all the work you do if God didn't wake you up in the morning and give you the intellectual ability to read a book what did you really achieve no one can claim credit for what they achieved because it's the grace of God that allows us to do anything God doesn't want to sh his Glory with anybody he wants to get all the glory he wants to get all the praise can the church say Amen you may be seated it your ability to survive is because of who you are don't forget who you are do not forget your identity can of church say Amen you may be seated so I want to have a little Bible study with you and we read the scripture in Hebrews we didn't read all of it but it speaks to by Faith by Faith by faith very familiar scripture we should all be familiar with it by faith Enoch by faith Noah by faith Abraham It Goes On by faith Moses and all these different ones and the Bible says here in verse 32 and what shall I say more for time would fail me in other words he said if I had more time this verse this chapter would never end because it's only because of time that I have to kind of pray see or shorten what is written here in other words if there was more time Hebrews 11 would have been a longer chapter and I would like to believe brother Moses that if he had time and he could seem to day our names will be here also by faith brother Moses by faith brother Branham can the church say [Applause] Amen but what is amazing about Hebrews 11 is outside of Enoch that who we knew had a testimony that pleased God every single name in Hebrews 11 has a issue so Hebrews 11 is also a book of what we call the Heroes of Faith but every one of them had a issue who fail God here Samson name is there we know the story of Samson but by the time God looked through time and look through Samson mistakes and look through Samson failures nobody could remove Samson name from the Moses missed the promised land because of the way he dealt with the people with the water on the Rock but by faith Moses Moses is and there so I want to encourage you your mistakes your failures where you have fallen will not stop you from make it into your Hebrews 11 can the church Preach back to [Applause] me friends if God was not interested in covering your mistakes there'd be no need for blood if God wanted to hold your mistakes against you he would need a SE of forgetfulness but God made provision for your mistakes by having blood and a sea of forgetfulness so that when God looks through the blood he sees you perfect and when you try to bring up your sin to even him he say I can't remember it I can't remember because it's already under the blood it's in the sea of forgetfulness what you're talking about what you did last year I don't even know what you're talking about it's already in the sea of forgetfulness [Applause] [Music] listen it's only in church people remember but I thank God he's not judging us by our brother he's not judging us by our sister when God looks at us through the blood see your forgetfulness there is nothing against you you are going to be perfect you are going to be filled you are going to be adopted [Applause] you may be seated imagine almighty God forget what you did 10 years ago and some self-righteous brother want to hold that over your head as if they forgot that the same God that had mercy on you have mercy on them oh God help me this morning that's why I love Jesus that's why I love the Lord he is merciful he is gracious his mercy endureth forever can the church Give the Lord a shout of Praise You may be seated so this Hebrews 11 is a story of people who who have mistakes challenges failures but they live by fit the Bible says that without fit it is impossible to please God and fear looks at the Unseen or looks at the situation and makes declarations that many times go against what the eye can see so we are here in church and we have a lot of problems but by faith we know it's going to work out by faith we're going to be healed by faith our sons and daughters will be delivered by faith this sickness is going to be by faith this high blood pressure has got to become normal by faith this heart condition has got to be healed by by faith I'm going to receive the Holy Ghost by faith I'm going to possess this inheritance by faith I'm going to have a Revival by faith I'm going to get a better job by faith doors that have been closed will open up by faith we worship by faith we Shout by faith we talk to God by faith he said without faith it is impossible to please God can the church say [Applause] Amen so this verse in verse 32 that says and what shall I more see for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and we have preached many messages about Gideon and of Barack some people know about Barack and of Samson most know about Samson and of jeffa and one day I was read like who is this jeffa because Samson is kind of obvious but I I said look who is jeffon because every scripture is for encouragement and every story is for inspiration so I said to look into who who who is jeffa because when I looked I say when Samson was you remember when at the time when Samson had to come the angel of the Lord went to his family and say you're going to have a child and and these things and and even Gideon an angel came to gide and many of us we say but no angel never came to me no angel went to my parents so I love when I find something in Scripture that I could connect to so when I start to look at Jeff I say there's something in this that I could relate to can the church say amen amen so let's go to judges 10 and we're going to start from verse 6 a little bible study this morning if that's all right today Sunday is the Lord's day we we here for the day right judges 10 and verse 6 and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord now judges as we know is the bridge between the Patriarchs which ended with Joshua as the tail end of it and the kings came after so judges is this period where the Bible said people did what was in their heart and God used a number of Judges starting with oel and Samson and Gideon and they're all in there but this is a particular point now the children of Israel did Evil again the operative word being again this is after Gideon Deliverance with the midianites because through the Book of Judges we see this cycle of going into idolatry going back into the world God helping to deliver them and for some reason people getting back into the world getting back into idolatry very much like what we see happening today people come and shout and jump in church they come to conventions and after a few weeks or a few months they get caught up in what's happening in the job and and the family and before you know it a cycle and AED evil again in the sight of the Lord and served and I want you to watch that word served because many time we we we talk about worship but serving is really worship and people don't realize that we really have only two main things to serve God with yes we could talk about our hands and our feet and all these things but you really serve god with your time and you serve god with your resources so here we see the children of Israel served bam it meant their time their resources their energy this is after having been delivered from Egypt this is after having seen Miracles this is after a repeated cycle of seeing God working for them they once again submitted themselves or yielded or serve the gods of their environment are you with me did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and serve balum and ASAT and the gods of Syria and the gods of sidon and the gods of Moab and the gods of the children of Ammon and the gods of the Philistines and forsook the Lord and served not him so it's not one not two not three this is the god of movies this is the god of Netflix this is anybody in the house [Music] it's as if they were looking to find another deity so they find a God here they find a thing here I can't make it to church I can't connect to the youth service I can't do this because all kind of different anybody with me in the [Applause] house and they forsook the Lord and served not him and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines and to the hands of the children of Ammon in other words whatever God they served became their oppressors I want to say to you Church whatever you serve will rule you you serve God he will take that's why Paul could say I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ he was happy to be a prisoner of the Lord but whatever you serve will rule you whatever you serve will control you can the church say amen and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he saw them into the hands of the the Philistines and at the hands of the children of Ammon and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel 18 years now when I read this as like 18 years you mean after year one they were not upset with it after year two of Oppression you wouldn't say well Lord are coming home after 5 years Lord are ready to come back to church you know but for 18 years they were under oppression it took 18 years for him to say enough is enough and I say back home Sometimes some of us haven't had enough pain to bring us back to God in other words they were serving false god and they did it for one year 2 years 3 years 4 years 5 years they are not happy they are under pressure they are under oppression but the pain doesn't seem to be enough to say Lord I want to come back to the altar could somebody pray for me it took 18 years to say enough is enough I don't want to do this anymore I want to encourage you Church don't wait so long to Get Your Heart Right with God don't wait until your arm broken and your life in a disarray to say I want to serve the Lord can the church say Amen a simple bible study this morning Hallelujah 18 years all of the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the amorites which is in Gilead moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim so that Israel was sore distressed so they're under pressure can the church say amen and I want to I want you to look at this here now verse 10 and the children of the Lord Cried unto the Lord saying we have sinned against thee both because we have forsaken Our God and also served BM and that on a s Lord we realize that we messed up I realize and many times people come to the altar saying well Lord I'm sorry Lord I recognize I'm messed up listen to the Lord's response and the Lord said unto the children of Israel did I not deliver you from the Egyptians and from the amorites and from the children of Ammon and from the Philistines and the sidonians also and the amalekites and the maronites and did oppress you and he cried to me and I delivered you out of their hand yet you have forsaken me and served other gods wherefore I will deliver you no more he goes on go and cry unto the gods which you have [Applause] chosen let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation because I've always delivered you I've always protected you I've always shown you Mercy I took you out and you have still walked away now you come and crying to me not because you really want to repent you know you're crying to me because you're in trouble what God saw was people coming to the altar wanting help but without repentance I hope this this touches you having remorse for what you have done is not repentance having regret for what you did is not repentance and when God looked at their cry they were crying and he say I'm hearing your cries I'm hearing these cries but they are not honest cries you are crying because of distress go and cry to the other gods who you have been serving hallu can the church say Amen go and cry to the gods which you have chosen let them deliver you in the time of your tribul ation people say well I prayed and God didn't deliver and God didn't help and the children of Israel said unto the Lord we have sinned so now they are changing the conversation because the first approach did not work God rejected their first cry oh I hope this hits home this morning this is serious stuff right here right amen I want to go back to verse 10 again to see the cry God rejected and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord saying we have sinned against thee both because we have forsaken Our God and also served bam and God said that is not good enough go and cry to the other gods now he comes in verse 15 they come now differently and the children of Israel said unto the Lord we have sinned do thou unto us whatsoever seeth good unto thee Deliver Us only we pray thee this day and vers 16 is where it changes and they put away the strange gods in other words the first time they cried the strange gods were still there oh you don't hear me this morning there are many people in church crying and they still have kept the strange gods they come to prayer meetings and they still have strange gods and God saw them crying and sighing and he is rejecting the cry because they're still living with strange Gods if you are here this morning and you have not put away the strange Gods today is the day that the Egyptians you see today we will see them no more forever we will put away every unclean every filthy Spirit every unclean thing can the church say [Applause] amen and they put away the strange Gods from among them and serve the Lord and when they put away the strange Gods the strange movies The Strange books the strange environments the strange things the things that you serve the things you spend time with the things you spend money on that has nothing to do with God that's a strange God God can't recognize it we can't even recognize it I can't recognize it's strange because it's not supposed to be it was not so from the beginning but the moment the strange gods are put away it opens up a door anybody with me this morning this is not the kind of shout and jump out of the service because we got to double check is there any strange God in my phone is there a strange God in my closet do I have clothes that serve a strange God do I have music that serves a strange godall [Applause] verse 16 and they put away the strange Gods from among them and serve the Lord and now look at God now and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel when he saw the strange Gods because he told him you shall have no other gods before me the moment he see the strange God's God the moment he see all the strange Gods disappear now we can say my soul feel for the pain of the people can the church say amen and the children of Ammon were gathered together and encamped in Gilead and the children of Israel assembled themselves together and encamped in mispah and the people and princes of Gilead said one to another what man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon he shall be head over all of the inhabitants of Gilead so now that their conversation changes brother Moses from we are in trouble and we are distressed because they know the strange gods have been moved away they know there's nothing stopping the power of God from moving through the camp and if the power of God can move through the camp then God is looking for somebody who is not afraid of the enemy he's looking for somebody who's not afraid to take the fight to the enemy's Camp can the church say Amen can we give the Lord a shout of [Applause] Praise You may be seated are you with me this morning now we go to Judges chapter 11 now jeffa the gileadite was a mighty man of H I love that kind of testimony when somebody could look and say that's that brother is a mighty man of Allah but there was a challenge and he was the son of an halot questionable her Heritage Shady circumstances when he come to church he feel a little uncomfortable they look at him a certain way he feels a certain way but he's a mighty man of Valor you can't change the fact that there's something about his stature that you can't just spin down can the church say Amen his upbringing wasn't right his his his his lineage was a problem but he's a mighty man of Valor can the Church Say Amen and Gilead's wife bear him sons and his wife Sons grew up and they thrust out jeffa and said unto him Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house so in other words they pushed him out because of the inheritance in other words they say because you are an outlaw that's why I got because you are outside of the law because back there in the Old Testament if you were a bastard you couldn't get title so they say jeffa we we like how you fighting you're strong and everything but we don't want you to come when time is right to ask for inheritance even though you're a mighty man of Valor you don't belong to the family can the church say Amen so jeffa is rejected and many times brother Jonathan people go through experience because of rejection people don't belong they don't fit in and many times people end up in situations because things didn't work out a certain way can the church say amen amen let's go Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house for thou art the son of a strange woman so here is a mighty man of Valor with no title with no inheritance he could not even go into the temple normal way with them because he was not of the lineage brother Moses can the church say Amen so then jeffa in verse three he fled he didn't walk away he didn't run fled is is a bit more some could walk away and say well okay because you can imagine there's only so much rejection people could take so the Bible said he fled he said okay that's it I've had enough I'm running away from this thing and as much of a mighty man of Valor he was he fled is there anybody fleeing this morning he fled from his Brethren and I like how the Bible still calls them his Brethren even though they rejected him the scripture calls them Brethren and he dwelt in the land of tub and and they were gathered vain men and the amplifi they call worthless men so he's with some bad boys to jeffa and went out with him so jeffa went from a mighty man of Valor to like a gang leader who was once brother JEA in church although he was rejected in church is now gangster JEA he takes his particular set of skills and takes them to the land of tub and around This Man Called jeffa Mighty Man of Allah he is now running a criminal Empire a band of worthless men they have rejected me you could imagine how you could feel when you grow up in a certain thing and and then and now you're there on your own and you're trying to make an meet and there he is finds himself in a strange place in a strange situation anybody with me chapter uh verse four and it came to pass in the process of time that the children of Ammon made war against Israel so the heat is intensifying right with me and it was so that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel the Elders of Gilead not the deacons not the ushers not the Believers the elders went to fetch jeffa out of the land of to I've always said when God wanted to write the New Testament and the Pauline Epistles he got a academic called Paul who studied at the feet of gel so when things come and is war you need to get you have to get the baddest man that you know so these Elders put on their suits brother gouki and they left Gilead to cross into the land of Tob I want you to picture these Elders taking their time going into gangster territory and it's one thing to go into a gangster territory to look for a gangster it's another thing to look with the leader of the [Applause] gangsters you may be SE it I said to the church back home there are some parts of my country I don't really go to and and and there was a friend of mine who went to a certain area they stop his car you say you sure you know where you're going because if you keep going down here you you really need to know somebody there cuz if you go down there is a whole different thing so it's one thing to go to the land of TOA and I'm looking to rent a gangster this was not it we looking for jeffa andbody say JEA jeffa jeffa JEA you sure you want to see JEA do you know who jeffa is he's the Kingpin in the tent you know could you imagine the elders slowly saying yes we have come to see jeffa and they came and H uh and they said unto jeffa so I could imagine because when you build a reputation brother the Jonathan as a bad man as a gangster I don't know what word he use here what the word he use bad guy gangster I'm not sure Jonathan is a bad guy because I don't I don't think bad guy is quite qualified but but when you build a reputation you cannot appear to seem vulnerable so I can imagine when Jeff because he knows the elders say look but chick boo TOS look maybe Jeff said let them meet me in private because he can't afford for these gangsters to know he grew up in church he can't afford for these gangsters to know he was going to Convention he can't afford for these gangsters to know that he knows the word he has built up a reputation that he's a bad man you can imagine gu say who are these who are these Elders coming anybody with me this you see in the picture right okay wonderful and they said unto jeffa come and the man and and this is amazing the man who was rejected who fled look at the brothers now come and be our captain that we may fight with the children of am and this is why I said jeffa had to say this quietly because he couldn't afford for the other gangsters to hear him and jeffa said unto the elders did you not hate me and expel me out of my father's house and why are you come unto me now when ye are in distress and the Elders of Gilead said unto Jeff therefore we turned again to thee now that thou mayest go with us and fight against the children of Ammon and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead could you imagine last yesterday day before he there doing all kind of stuff and now this this is I call this the greatest head hunting the HR world has ever seen jeffa didn't apply for this job he was head hunted he was recruited to be the top General yesterday he's hunting down all kind of whatever you could do with his gangsters and today he has a job offer come be our captain come be our head you'll be head of all them brothers who rejected you all them brothers who despised you all them brothers who rejected you can the Church Say Amen Hall therefore we turn to again to the know I'm and in verse eight that thou mayest go with us and fight against the children of Ammon and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead and jeffa said unto the Elders of Gilead if you bring me home now I like his use of the word home he was outside of the fellowship brother the gie but he still saw it as home and there are people who spend time on the church whatever reason but there's no place like Hallelujah for all of the time he is there in tub living outside of the Covenant as it were he knows where home is and he said to them if you bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon and the Lord deliver them before me shall I be your head in other words he's trying to confirm are you telling me that if I come and fight I'll be in charge and the Elders of Gilead said unto jeffa the Lord be witness between us if we do not so according to thy words in other words this is confirmed then jeffa went with the Ellers of gilled I don't know who jeffa left in charge of the bad boys but I could just imagine jeffa walking out jeffa throw up the gangster outfit jeffa put on his suit that he used to wear at a convention and jeffa is Walking with the ERS back to Gilead yesterday he's a gangster today he's a leader of the people of Gilead yesterday he's in trouble but today he's in the house of God yesterday he doing one thing but today he's in position it is the Divine mystery of his spiritual identity he had no idea what he was born to do can the church say Amen I'm not going to be too much longer this is just encourage you a little bit Church hallu then jeffa went with the Elders of Gilead and the people made him head and Captain two things hallu this isn't God good that's why it's the sovereignty of God or know you can imagine Brothers say but all this time I'm here in church all this time I here in the Army and is Jeff they bring to not just be Captain but head and Captain he is President and General in commanding Chief of the Armed Forces wow head and Captain over them and Jeff jeffa uttered all his words before the Lord in misper and jeffa and this is where you could be you could maybe see and I love this because the thought would be brother uzo that if you bring a gangster to deal with a war situation that the first response would be who ready to fight you have your weapons you strapped let's let's go let's go one time I've I've arrived but look at jeffa in verse 12 and jeffa sent Messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon so jeffa was more than just a gangsta brother gie jeffa started with arbitration and mediation jeffa sent messagers unto the king of the children of Ammon saying what hast thou to do with me he already claim ownership now that thou had come against me to fight in my land so he understands what is his he understands who he is the previous rejection of his family line is not even considered in this conversation who his mother was is irrelevant how he grew up is irrelevant he said this is my land oh come on now what has thou to do with me that thou had come against me to fight in my land and the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messages Jeff a even reach yet he sending representative he sent his lawyers and the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of DEA because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt from Anon even unto Jabbok and unto Jordan now therefore restore those lands again peaceably and that's a good legal argument it's a conversation then jeffa sent Messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon and he said unto him and I love this thus say JEA talk about understanding who you are talk about understanding where you come from talk about understanding how God is going to use [Music] you he said thus sayth jeffa Hallelujah h Israel took not away the land of Moab now I love this because this is the reformed gangster who clearly is way more than a gangster this gangster understands history he understands genealogy he understand the spiritual Dimension he understands the Anchor Point of his faith he understands the court because the secret is the word is in the bride and he was clearly part of this economy because God took him from a gangster into Hebrews 11 oh come come on [Applause] [Music] now thus say jeffa Israel took not away the land of Moab nor the land of the children of Ammon but let me rewind the tape to show you what really happened when Israel came up from Egypt this is jeffa speaking this is not the priest this not the Scribe he said when Israel now this is a son of a halot who had no land no title No deed he grew up as an outsider but clearly he was in church because he was hearing the word to be able to repeal come on now somebody that's why this message will find itself into the hands of the predestinated can the church say Amen so Jeff to say let me school you this morning when Israel came out of Egypt and walked through the Wilderness unto the Red Sea and came to Kadesh and then Israel sent Messengers unto the king of Edom saying let me I pray thee pass through thy land but the king of Edom would not hearken ther too so we tried that and in like manner Des sent unto the king of Moab but he would not consent and Israel aboe in Gades then they went along through the Wilderness and compassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab and came by the east side of the land of Moab and pitch on the other side of Anan but came not within the border of Moab for Anan was the border of Moab up and Israel sent messages unto seon King of the amorites the king of heshbon and Israel s to him let us pass we pray thee through the land into my place but seon trusted not Israel to pass through his Coast but seon this is where the problem started gathered up all his people together and pitched in Jes and fought against Israel so let me make it clear to you how this thing started and the Lord God of Israel delivered on and all his people into the hand of Israel and they smoted them so Israel possessed all the land of the amorites the inhabitants of that country and they possess all the cour of the amorites from Anon even onto Jabbok and from the Wilderness even un Jordan so now the Lord God of Israel hath dispossessed do you know what God has dispossessed in your favor do you know what God has listen God has dispossessed things in your favor you got to know what is your own somebody give God a shout of [Applause] Praise so Jeff is saying don't hold us accountable is the Lord my my my my my the Lord God of Israel had dispossessed the amorites from before his people Israel and shouldest thou possess it in other words after God has told me the land is my land after God has told me healing is mine after he told me my family is mine after he told me the Holy Ghost is mine after he told me good health and strength is mine after he told me victory is mine after he told me joy is mine and peace is mine you want to tell me I shouldn't possess it you mean to tell me after God has done that for me I will let you take what God has given me you get out of here I know who I am I know what belongs to me I know where I come from I know where I'm going can the church say [Applause] Amen you may be seen it Jeff to so inspired he says Thou should as thou possess it in other words I've got to be crazy after we've been through all this stuff to let you take what God has given me and if I know what God has given me and it's mine there's no way I'm giving it to you it's mine healing is mine victory is mine peace of mine sickness is not my portion depression is not my portion frustration is not my [Applause] por brother gie Jeff's lawyers are so good that after that argument they say will thou not possess will thou will not thou possess that which CH much thy God give thee to possess you catch that he said in other words if the God I serve give me something it is my right to live in the realm of what God gave me if your idol give you something then you should fight for that but don't fight for what God give me if you're chamers God give you something well go and find whatever that is and you take that but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord can the church say Amen everybody feeling fine can we get some more time you know we we we we have to finish it we can't leave this this is better than watching a movie this is better than Netflix this is better than Amazon Prime this is [Applause] this is Blockbuster Oscar winning Grammy Award winning to God we serve give us everything pertaining to life and godliness to encourage us on this journey can the church say amen hallelujah so so Jeff bear in mind JEA hasn't left his tent yet it's just his lawyers he send brother GOI and the brothers later he just said his lawers will thou not possess that which Cham must thy God giveth thee to possess so and and and this is my declaration this morning so whomever the Lord Our God shall drive out from before us them will we possess in other words if the Lord is clearing a path for me to blessing I am possessing It All Holy Ghost Dynamics adoption my family my children whatever it is if the Lord goes before me I am more than able to possess every inch of ground Hallelujah I'm not asking for forgiveness if God drove a away for me to go I'm going right there every place my foot go that's what I'm going to take can the church say [Applause] [Applause] amen so after and these brothers are finishing their legal argument brother Goki is so solid after they deal with the history they switch to the spiritual Dimension now they see and now having said all of this and now add th anything better than baac the son of zapor King of the Moab did he ever strive against Israel or did he ever fight against them while Israel dwelt in heshbon and her towns and in AO and her towns and all the cities that be along by the coast of anon 300 years why therefore did ye not recover them within that time that's what we call in law statute of limitations the matter was statute bad if the devil had to get you he should have done it a long time ago it's too late [Applause] now in other words Jeff's men said your legal argument your whole case should have been tried 300 years ago statute of limitation run out can't even stand up in court it's too late now it's already our land go God already give it to us and if you wanted to fight us for it you should have done it at Calvary but it's already finished all the way back [Applause] there give the Lord a shout of Praise too late devil too late devil too late devil I've come too far to turn back now what God has done for me oh I tell you I can't but tell it all brother oil I'm trying to find a place to [Music] land so verse 27 wherefore I have not sinned against thee but thou do with me wrong to war against me the Lord the judge here is a judge my title is the outlaw who became a judge here is a judge that's acknowledging the judge he said the Lord the judge be judged this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon verse 28 how be it the king of the children of Ammon hearken not unto the words of jeffa which he sent him and you know to to for the young people all them movies they're trying to make this is such a powerful story because if if the head of Ammon did just comply the story wouldn't get better so the fact that he say I hear and all of that now jeffa gets to beat JEA he said I try the Diplomatic way I try to talk to you I send my lawyers to negotiate with you if it's War you want then it's War you're going to [Applause] get how be it the king of the children of Ammon Harker not unto the words of JEA which you send them and this is verse 29 and I made reference very early that an angel came to Gideon an angel went to Samson's family we know this but jeffa had no spiritual encounter in that sense but verse 29 then the spirit of the Lord Came Upon jeffa so all that jeffa was doing before brother GOI was under inspiration but now the spirit of the Lord Came Upon jeffa there something happens when the spirit of the Lord comes upon you woo Glory [Applause] so if jeffa was inspired before now he's Anointed The Spirit of the Lord is upon him he is moved by the spirit Hallelujah then the spirit of the Lord Came Upon jeffa and he passed over Gilead and manisa and passed over misp of Gilead and from m of Gilead he passed over unto the TR of Ammon and verse 30 now this is where the story shifts now and I want to tie something to as we begin to land this message and jeffa vowed a vow unto the Lord and said if Thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon shall surely be the Lords and I will offer it up for a burnt offering so jeffa passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them and the Lord delivered them into his hands and he smed them from aror even till th come to minute even t 20 cities hallu he went from Cross River to anra from anra is it Delta to to enugu an Inu 20 cities and under the plain of The Vineyards with a very great Slaughter thus the children of Ammon was subdued before the children of Israel now this is where it gets serious now and jeffa came to misper unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him I have let me finish the verse first and jeffa came to misper onto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter I said to the church when I read this I have one daughter I have tried my best to speak with her every day that I've been out the country and I know the excitement she will have when I get home and I'm picturing this gangster turned the judge this man who has had to overcome so many challenges in life makes a statement and brother Branham speaks about it and we'll get to a short quote that maybe he didn't think it all the way through because by the brandham calls it a rash vow and me going to land talking about vows and commitments but here it is now he is confronted with the words that he said unto God [Music] amen verse 35 man it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said alas my daughter thou has brought me very low and thou art one of them that trouble me for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord hallu and I cannot I cannot go [Music] back do you understand the Power of Words and the critical importance that stringing sentences together stringing words together and uttering something carries consequences that you may not even realize maybe the experiences that jeffa went through because I don't think gangsters sign agreements no no one has a let me see your lawyer and your lawyer meet my lawyer and we'll discuss this no you will deliver it if you don't deliver it you're dead it's very simple before lawyers were a thing men live by their word their word was their bond now we can't remember where's the agreement oh so I really did promise it and assign it okay well now I but the world was framed by the word of God life and death is in the power of the tongue the spoken word is the Original Seed our words have power and Jeff is saying I said some words unto the Lord I didn't say it to the pastor I didn't say it to my parents I didn't say to the Elder to the Deacon but I said some words unto the Lord and I cannot take it back how does that elevate the words when we take a vow from marriage because when you stand before the sacred desk you are taken a vow before the God hallelujah hallelujah now it gets real Hallelujah prise the daughter's response in verse 36 blew me away because it speaks to the fact that she was a daughter of training and she said unto him my father if thou Hast opened thy mouth unto the Lord do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth for as much as the Lord ha taken Vengeance for thee for thine enemies even of the children of Ammon now I want to touch on two scriptures to help you Psalms Psalm 15 verse one Lord who shall abide in thy Tabernacle who shall dwell in thy Holy Hill he that walth uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbor nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor in whose eyes a vile person is condemned but he honored them that fear the lord and listen to this verse he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not in the Amplified this says he keeps his word even to his own disadvantage and does not change it for his own benefit so this elevates to us as Believers how do we really keep our word to God we started this study with judges where they were repenting with their lips you may be see it where they were repenting with their lips and God said you're still keeping strange gods and not hearing your words but if you're making a vow before me many times people say well it was a mistake I said a mistake but but your words are important and here it is the psalmist David is saying you you said something even if it's to your own hurt you have to live with it is this is this hidden home let's read one more scripture the musician will begin to get ready Ecclesiastes 5 verse one keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be Hasty to utter anything before God for God is in heaven and and thou upon Earth therefore let thy Words Be Few for a dream cometh through the multitude of business and a Fool's voice is known by multitude of words when thou vest a vow unto God defer not to pay it for he hath no pleasure in fools pay that which thou Hast vowed better is it that thou shouldest not vow than thou shouldest vow and not suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say before the angel that it was an error I'm reading scripture wherefore should God be angry at thy voice and destroy the work of thy hands so this is the gravity so when jeffa realize maybe I said something unto God that maybe I didn't think this thing true but oh God I I got to keep my word and his daughter say well Dad if you said something unto the Lord you have to keep it I want to read that in the Amplified you can begin to play something softly guard your steps and focus on what you are doing as you go to the house of God and draw near to listen rather than to offer the careless or irreverent sacrifice of fools for they are too ignorant to know that they are doing evil do not be Hasty with your mouth speaking careless words of ours or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter before God for God is in heaven and you are on the earth therefore let your Words Be Few for the dream comes through much effort and the voice of fools through many words when you make a vow or a pledge to God do not put off paying it for God takes no pleasure in fools who thoughtlessly mock him pay what you vow it is better that you should not vow then you should vow and not pay do not allow your speech to cause you to sin and do not say before the messenger or priest of God that it was a mistake so jeffa made it to Hebrews 11 not just because he was a brother Jonathan but because because because he was a man who understood the power of a vow and a commitment to the Lord so when you young people say Lord I want to serve you I'm making a vow to serve you how prepared are you to do whatever it takes as a young sister you take a vow to preserve your virtue your Chastity are you prepared to do whatever it takes to keep that vow as a husband you stood before the Altar and this word Angel says priest it's Pastor it's the same context so you stand before God and man to take the vow this changes this is not just don't fornicate don't commit adultery this is a vow before God he said it's better to not vow than to vow and and waste it but if you are making a declaration to God Lord I'm going to serve you I take thee as my wife For Better or For Worse for richer for poorer for sickness and health until death do us part for love and to cherish For Better or For Worse that's a vow before God hallelujah this is higher than don't commit adultery this is I made a vow before God to serve him I vow to serve him whether I maintain my family let me maintain Christ is this hitting home for [Music] anyone maybe you have made vows at you have not kept maybe you have said things that many time people come to the Altar and Lord I'm I'm going to change I'm going to do this and and you find yourself pulled into all kind of situations I want you to relook at that and if you are choosing today to make a decision a choice a vow a commitment to serve God that you really mean it and you back that word up with whatever action is required because it's not a vow to me it's not a it's not a man it's not to the Past P it's to God verse 36 back to judges and she said unto him no I I I I wonder if she was not the way she was as a daughter because there's one thing for a father to make a vow that that impacts his family and it's a whole another experience if she had said oh God daddy don't do it but she was a special girl my father if thou has opened thy mouth unto the Lord do to me according to that which proceeded out of thy mouth for as much as the Lord had taken Vengeance for thee of thine enemies even of the children of Ammon and she said unto her father let me let this thing be done for me let me alone two months that I may go up and down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity I and my fellows and he said go and he sent her away for two months and she went with her Companions and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains and it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned unto her father who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed and she knew no man and it was a custom in Israel that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jeffar the gileadite four days in a year theologians have debated how the story ends but it says that she knew not a man and the words that were used in the original text would suggest that she became like a temple maid dedicating her life completely to God so jeffa potentially lost the lineage his family because this girl would have given her life to serve in the temple never getting married never having children mourned her virginity for two months because of her vow a sacrifice because of a vow maybe jeffa saw himself walking his daughter up the aisle one day and his vow shut that picture down she had to mourn with her friends because her friends may have thought themselves brid Maids at some point but the vow not The Vow that she made but the vow that her father made had an impact on her own destiny That's The Power of vows I want to shake you this morning that through this short bible study and encouragement about the outlaw who became a judge he was a judge of Israel but he was a judge who in his own home had to live something that had such an impact upon him and his daughter and his life that it was something as a Trad conditioned they could remember the sacrifice that she had to make because of his vow may we as we leave this service today and maybe you want to relook at the vows you made to the Lord maybe you have made vows to the Lord that you realize Lord I have not been even keeping it don't hold it against me Lord but today I'm ready to reconnect to The Vow amen many of us we still Lord if you take this situation away from me or deliver me from this I'm going to serve you differently I'm going to do this for you and do this for you and and you let the cares of Life swamp you and all the things you promis to do for God you and God is saying but you promis you promised me you made a vow to me where is it this is not for for God to punish you or put you into oppression but your words mean something to God your existence is by the word so I want to encourage you Church encourage you fathers mothers be very careful what you say to your children be very careful what you say about them speak positive am Speak Life speak hope speak Joy speak truth there's power in your words be careful what you say about yourself be very careful go back in your own study and look back at these scriptures that we read from Eccles Ecclesiastes 5 and from Psalms 15 and make it your study during the course of this week Lord help me to measure my words measure my statements it changes even how you do business because it says there if you make a promise to your own hurt be a man of your word be a woman of your word be a daughter you could imagine if God doesn't keep his own word this thing we love about God because he is his word and he has to keep his word and God wants us to grow up to be Sons and Daughters who keep the word every head bowed every eye closed Lord we stand here in this service this bible study this realization of our spiritual identity in you and Lord this man jeffa who came from strange Beginnings but you use him to transform history defeating the ammonites and in lord your Prophet said he made a rash vow but he stood by his word as an encouragement to us that despite the sacrifice maybe we need to lose friends maybe we need to change who we call on our phones maybe we need to change where we spend time to preserve the vow and the commitment we make to you but Lord help us to keep our vows give us the strength to stand behind our vs give us the grace to hold our vs Lord if there anyone here this morning morning Lord as the message has gone forth and they've realized that they have made vows maybe here in the church maybe in their prayer closet maybe in ascon maybe in a convention maybe in a meeting they say Lord if you deliver me Lord I will I will be in church and I'll be on fire lord I'll read the word or whatever it is Lord all these unbroken vows Lord there are too many of them in the house Lord all of us are guilty of making promises to you that we struggle to keep but Lord this morning we want to reconnect and make new vows measured vows to serve you in spirit and in truth to forsake the world to forsake the cares of the world to be desperate for the Holy Ghost to live a life worthy of the Gospel to forsake all whether I maintain my family whether I maintain whatever it is I want to maintain Christ help us to make the right kind of house Lord if there's anyone Lord who is backsliding this morning jeffa found himself in a strange place with strange people but it didn't change the purpose of God upon his life Lord may you remind your people that they are called for a purpose may you remind your people that they are called for Spiritual inheritance may you move through the camp this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ is there anyone want to renew their vow to the Lord this morning all over the building talk to him right now say Lord I renew my vow I renew my

one time and Prophet made a vow that he was not going to hunt any more animals or something like that I think I don't know if you recall that but God tested him on it and dare come right up to him and he promised he said I wouldn't shoot you I told God I made a promise that I I wouldn't do it they came right up to his face and he said I told God I wouldn't do it he said go on now go on you know I won't do you no no harm and God came down and said because you kept your promise I'm going to keep mine praise God Amen when you keep your promises God keeps his promises amen that's true and so we
