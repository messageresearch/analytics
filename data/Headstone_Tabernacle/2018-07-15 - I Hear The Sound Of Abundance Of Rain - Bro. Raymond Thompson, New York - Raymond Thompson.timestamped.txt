[39:49] special way Lord from the crown of his
[39:51] head to the soles of his feet lordy
[39:54] enemy would try to attack father because

[40:03] stop what you have already started

[40:07] finisher father me you visit your
[40:09] manservant right now
[40:11] Lord he couldn't be in the house of God
[40:13] that's a rare thing for him not to be in
[40:15] the house of God so we pray right now as

[40:19] visit your manservant but over right now
[40:22] I'm a diesel of the Lord walk into his
[40:24] house may you touch him may you give him
[40:27] a fresh challenge may you bring that
[40:30] blood pressure to normal in the name of

[40:55] touch her Lord all those who are tired
[40:57] and weary Lord and the virus and the flu
[41:00] and whatever it is we bring it under
[41:03] subjection under the blood we bring it
[41:06] under the token we bind the works of
[41:09] sickness we find the word subtractors
[41:12] and we declare victory this morning

[42:07] heard it over the weekend you could
[42:08] bring your family under the token when
[42:11] you bring them under the token it's
[42:13] gonna work itself out because the devil
[42:16] cannot come under the token under the
[42:18] token the devil can reach last that
[42:21] bloodline past that blood barrier and he
[42:24] was started to work in us is more than
[42:27] able to bring it to pass oh I'm excited
[42:30] because we have turned a corner the
[42:33] angel of the Lord Himself he has turned
[42:35] a corner and we want to move with a
[42:38] cloud the cloud of glory is moving
[42:42] hallelujah amen hallelujah so special

[42:59] mark your calendars we are on the
[43:02] offensive we are on the offenses we're

[43:14] rainbow who said it they took everything
[43:16] with them when they left Egypt they took
[43:20] everything

[43:27] pencil will be left behind but our plan
[43:30] will be left behind
[43:31] not an animal left behind not your son
[43:34] left behind not your daughter left

[43:39] your husband left behind we are all
[43:41] going to the rapture we are all going to

[43:49] time up in heaven we are gonna have a
[43:51] singing shouting time up in heaven and
[43:54] those that are over there are waiting to
[43:56] hear your testimony of how you made it
[43:59] over how you overcame every attack every
[44:04] temptation the lust of the eyes the lust
[44:07] of the flesh the pride of life and you
[44:10] will have a testimony what will it be
[44:12] there's a scene there's a light in the
[44:16] heart compartment there's a scene
[44:19] there's a genetic hold that the devil
[44:22] cannot touch
[44:23] he cannot impact he cannot influence he
[44:27] cannot change that structure and every
[44:30] scene will bring forth after its kind Oh
[44:35] hallelujah
[44:37] no wonder the Prophet could see you are
[44:40] not even the believer but the words seed
[44:43] in you is saying amen to the word when
[44:46] your body doesn't see him and that seed
[44:48] is saying amen to the word when your
[44:51] mind I will say Amen that seed is saying
[44:55] amen to the word of God Oh hallelujah oh
[45:00] what a blessing and we are gonna have to
[45:03] there was so much that was said over the
[45:06] convention it was impossible to have
[45:08] gotten at all so we're gonna have to
[45:11] take some time to go back and refresh
[45:13] and reflect and bask in man amen

[45:21] service this morning and before we get
[45:26] to it I just want to read one quote from
[45:28] the prophet in the message speak to this
[45:29] mountain he said I believe that the
[45:32] Church of the Living God is moving into
[45:35] a sphere now that's going to shake the
[45:37] whole world that's the first time it's
[45:41] been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth
[45:43] to a human being ask anything that you
[45:47] will and it shall be given unto you
[45:49] anything you desire don't you see the
[45:52] words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled
[45:54] oh it's gonna come to pass pretty soon
[45:58] I'm looking for it to happen in this
[45:59] meeting I'm wanting it to happen now and
[46:02] that anointing will strike the whole
[46:05] Church of the Living God and she rise to
[46:07] her feet like a mighty marching army and
[46:10] here is your promise the sick will be
[46:12] healed by a word the blind will see the
[46:16] Deaf will hear the Dead will be raised
[46:18] up and the power of God will shake the
[46:22] world with the Church of the Living God
[46:24] we are in the process of it now where
[46:29] the Brennan said we are in the process
[46:30] of it now and a process has a beginning
[46:33] a process has an ending a process has a
[46:36] wait unfold so the process has already
[46:38] started we already in the process it's
[46:44] got to happen it's gonna happen but the
[46:47] random said I believe it's soon coming
[46:48] to pass I believe it will be just
[46:51] exactly that way I believe it's gonna
[46:53] strike the Church of God soon and it's
[46:55] gonna start a revival that'll shake the
[46:58] world I believe it
[46:59] can we get a lot of shorter praise amen
[47:03] so this morning but the Raymond Thompson
[47:07] is preaching at the Omega Christian
[47:11] Assembly in New York by brother palomo

[49:49] musicians I want to read a scripture
[49:51] Philippians 3:12 2:14
[50:06] Philippians 3:12 2:14 not as though I
[50:15] had already attained either were already
[50:19] perfect but I follow after if that I may
[50:24] apprehend that for which also I am
[50:28] apprehended of Christ Jesus brethren I
[50:32] count out myself to have apprehended but
[50:36] this one thing I do forgetting those
[50:39] things which are behind and reaching
[50:42] forth unto those things which are before
[50:45] us I press toward the mark for the prize
[50:49] of the high calling of God in Christ
[50:53] Jesus
[50:54] may the Lord a blessing to the reading
[50:57] of his word you may be seated I guess if
[51:02] I would give a title to these
[51:05] introduction airy comments this morning
[51:07] is reaching forth to the things before
[51:10] us
[51:12] well good morning church and good
[51:17] morning to all our brothers and sisters
[51:19] in Christ gathered with us and on the
[51:22] hook-up this morning for this special
[51:25] service that the Lord placed upon our
[51:28] hearts to have today it is my spiritual
[51:32] birthday today July 15th 1983 when I was
[51:38] baptized with the Holy Ghost amen
[51:47] mine came after brother Robledo his was
[51:51] June the 8th and I was right there when
[51:54] he was baptized with the Holy Ghost amen
[51:57] so you just had your birthday
[52:00] well the Coleman that day I went to his
[52:03] office he was dealing with someone and
[52:06] I'll never forget it he laid hands on me
[52:08] and he said I perceive you want the Holy
[52:12] Ghost and I had been crying out within
[52:15] and he laid hands on me next thing I
[52:17] know I'm on the floor the white light is
[52:20] flooding into my soul and since that
[52:23] time I've been adding rotting dying that
[52:28] Christ might live in me and that is the
[52:32] desire of everyone gathered in here to
[52:35] manifest the token to manifest Jesus
[52:38] Christ I believe the Scriptures Psalm
[52:42] 133 is perfect for this day behold how
[52:47] good and how pleasant it is for brethren
[52:50] to dwell together in unity it is like
[52:53] the precious ointment upon the head that
[52:56] ran down upon the beard even Aaron's
[52:59] beard that went down to the skirts of
[53:02] his garments so it is beautiful in the
[53:06] sight of God to see brothers and sisters
[53:08] gather together in expectation in unity
[53:13] around the word that is about to be
[53:15] delivered by God's servant brother
[53:17] Raymond Thompson first I want to thank
[53:21] my very special brothers in Christ with
[53:24] a fury and brother Robledo and their
[53:28] wives for their sacrifice to be able to
[53:31] be here today thank you
[53:34] both of you
[53:52] may be seated forgive me if I get a
[54:00] little emotional but thank you for being
[54:03] here today
[54:04] for accepting the invitation and being
[54:06] part of this little I call it mini
[54:08] convention this time years ago we'd be
[54:12] in Penn Harris or just coming home well
[54:14] thank you brothers each one of my
[54:16] brothers are the fury and brother
[54:18] Robledo have contributed so much to the
[54:21] bride of Jesus Christ dedicating their
[54:25] lives for his purpose and together under
[54:28] the ministry of our pastor brother
[54:30] Joseph Coleman we served as young men we
[54:34] obviously older now and we were trained
[54:37] for service for such a time as this
[54:42] brother Fury once preached a message was
[54:45] back in the 70s and it was and the
[54:50] people said amen
[54:52] and how it brought down a special
[54:55] anointing of worship and it showed the
[54:59] people what God expected from them as
[55:02] the reveal word came forth from God's
[55:06] servants and I will never forget it when
[55:09] he read the scripture and say well the
[55:11] people said Amen and you better believe
[55:13] the anointing resounded in the house of
[55:16] God that day the people said Amen and
[55:19] then brother ableto preached a powerful
[55:22] message I believe is back in 2005 I'll
[55:26] never forget it charity anointed faith
[55:30] releases the hidden power on the third
[55:33] face and he was quoting the Holy Spirit
[55:37] gotta hold him so much it was amazing
[55:39] quoting from Christ is the mystery of
[55:42] God reveal he said Christ is the
[55:45] principal theme of a Bible through seven
[55:49] church ages through his seven phone
[55:51] natures to be anointed by charity
[55:54] to release the hidden power the hidden
[55:56] manna underneath the Seventh Seal I will
[55:59] never forget the way he brought that
[56:01] message god bless you brother Fury god
[56:04] bless you brother robe leader true
[56:07] servants of the Living God may be seated
[56:17] how brother Fury and brother Robledo
[56:20] blessed God's people and God's servant
[56:23] with their ministries and they continue
[56:26] to do so in their churches on the field

[59:07] I appreciate brother Thompson for his
[59:10] phone calls over these past few years
[59:12] in particular always reaching out with
[59:15] concern encouragement and a few years
[59:18] ago when he was passing through he and I
[59:21] went out to brother Coleman's gravesite
[59:23] there we had a very special time
[59:26] together as we both expressed what
[59:29] brother Coleman's ministry meant in our
[59:31] lives in our ministries and how I
[59:34] appreciated his understanding of what
[59:36] God placed on my heart for the little
[59:39] flock out here in Hicksville on Long
[59:41] Island so we the Holy Spirit was there I
[59:44] will never forget the little fellowship
[59:46] that we had maybe less at an hour an
[59:48] hour and a half and I said when you pass
[59:50] through again in the future perhaps you
[59:52] could speak for us and here we are a few
[59:55] years later it's God's time and it's
[59:58] God's season for brother Raymond to
[1:00:01] bless us with the preaching of the word
[1:00:03] this morning and speaking to him last
[1:00:07] week this weekend something that brother
[1:00:14] Branham spoke of and all of the
[1:00:16] ministers quote from God's prophet
[1:00:18] Malachi 4 that God keeps his word and it
[1:00:23] cannot fail that charity never faileth
[1:00:27] and brother Branham on that message for
[1:00:31] 750
[1:00:49] we're just over the
[1:00:56] I've
[1:01:01] okay
[1:01:03] and yet I believe it's coming to a time
[1:01:07] when God's church it's gonna be so cold
[1:01:10] out like that where all the saints will
[1:01:12] just set together and the Holy Spirit
[1:01:15] will just come in like it was on the day
[1:01:18] of Pentecost heal the people raise up
[1:01:22] the people and great things I begin to
[1:01:25] see it happen well that's the way I feel
[1:01:28] I'm expecting something to happen that
[1:01:33] is the desire of every servant of God
[1:01:35] who followed the message of Malachi 4
[1:01:38] for that divine love to drop down then
[1:01:42] came Jesus amen you may be seated
[1:01:47] and after that brother branham said then
[1:01:49] came Jesus 1957 and after this morning
[1:01:53] the Holy Spirit is so beautifully coming
[1:01:56] down and bathing us in His great beauty
[1:01:58] it was just inspired to speak them words
[1:02:02] and say that some glorious day that all
[1:02:05] the gifts that's in the church will be
[1:02:08] just set aside on the mantle as it was
[1:02:11] and the Holy Spirit Himself will just
[1:02:15] take the church in such control of
[1:02:17] divine love until the sick will be
[1:02:20] healed
[1:02:21] glory to God until the blind will see
[1:02:25] until the lame bow war until the Deaf
[1:02:29] will hear sister Virginia without hands
[1:02:31] being laid on them it'll be one great
[1:02:34] beauty I believe we are in that season
[1:02:38] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:02:43] amen amen glory to God blade god bless
[1:02:46] you sister Jessica Luda god bless you
[1:02:49] good to see you sister God has got

[1:03:18] that is my desire that is in my heart
[1:03:22] and everyone gathered here this morning
[1:03:25] on the hook-up and I believe we are in
[1:03:28] that season now that is the time we are
[1:03:31] in where charity never fails what is the
[1:03:36] Holy Ghost given for well brother
[1:03:38] Branham said he ties it in right here on
[1:03:40] that message well that's what the Holy
[1:03:42] Ghost is given for it gives - gets to
[1:03:45] give unction to the preacher this
[1:03:47] morning it's to give holiness to the
[1:03:50] group it's to set the church in order
[1:03:53] it's to bring a unity of the spirit it's
[1:03:56] to unite us together with power his
[1:03:59] power will unite us together it's to
[1:04:02] unite us together with love brotherly
[1:04:05] love I don't care if you're Methodist I
[1:04:07] don't care if you're Baptist I don't
[1:04:10] care if you're Presbyterian Lutheran
[1:04:12] whatever you are if we open by one Holy
[1:04:15] Spirit baptized into one body members of
[1:04:19] the body of Jesus Christ if that is so
[1:04:22] there is nothing present there is
[1:04:24] nothing future there is nothing in the
[1:04:26] past hunger starvation nothing can
[1:04:30] separate us from the love of God from
[1:04:33] the love of Christ the love of God
[1:04:35] that's in Christ because you are born of
[1:04:37] the Holy Spirit you are washed in the
[1:04:40] blood you have a full blood atonement
[1:04:42] that's what the Holy Spirit is given for
[1:04:45] that's what it's for
[1:04:47] let it be the name of the Lord you may
[1:04:50] be seated
[1:04:50] [Applause]
[1:04:55] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[1:05:01] brother branham he said it would be ever
[1:05:04] so humble and that charity will be the
[1:05:07] main thing humble thyself I was thinking
[1:05:12] here brother branham said of one little
[1:05:13] illustration to back up what he said now
[1:05:16] we're looking at the watch to find out
[1:05:19] what time it is
[1:05:20] unless that every instrument in that
[1:05:22] watch is watches coordinating with one
[1:05:25] another we'll never know the correct
[1:05:27] time and that takes all of us together
[1:05:30] if we want to see the third pull do
[1:05:33] something for God and do something for
[1:05:35] God
[1:05:36] it's coordination with every one of us
[1:05:39] together and the devil thinks he had the
[1:05:42] bride in a corner somewhere this bride
[1:05:44] is coming out this bride is getting
[1:05:47] together in the unity of the faith
[1:05:49] amen to humble ourselves brother Branham
[1:05:52] seen before God confess out wrong and
[1:05:56] pray and believe God for these things we
[1:05:59] want to keep it running smoothly sweetly
[1:06:02] in the order of the Lord just think if
[1:06:05] gifts is so great what we call pow1 Paul
[1:06:08] said though I have faith that I could
[1:06:11] move a mountain and have not charity I
[1:06:13] am nothing think of that and though we
[1:06:16] say well I understand though I
[1:06:18] understand all the mysteries of God and
[1:06:21] still though I could do it and have not
[1:06:23] charity I am nothing see I ain't got
[1:06:26] nowhere yet I love the way brother Brian
[1:06:29] brings it I ain't got no way a main
[1:06:32] thing he said his love the love of God
[1:06:35] humble yourself with that love and when
[1:06:39] it is in one's heart this love it will
[1:06:43] bring to pass the tremendous victory in
[1:06:46] the love this vine till this morning I
[1:06:49] pray that God use his servant in a
[1:06:54] mighty way that we draw closer together
[1:06:56] we're brothers and sisters we draw
[1:06:59] closer a new and fresh anointing
[1:07:07] and in this last quote begin to play
[1:07:11] more than before I need you the end time

[1:07:33] where we could come for a season of
[1:07:35] services get with this fine pastor and
[1:07:38] others and get a meeting set up four or
[1:07:41] five nights where we could sufficiently
[1:07:43] advertise and get all the churches
[1:07:45] together because you know not we need

[1:34:46] that God is a plan in all things the
[1:34:51] footsteps of the righteous are guided of
[1:34:53] the Lord and I wrote here but the common
[1:35:00] ancestor common ran their race very well

[1:40:01] verse 41 any lightest it onto a get the
[1:40:05] up and eat and drink for there is a
[1:40:07] sound of abundance of rain so a abou end
[1:40:11] up in a eat and to drink and he lied to
[1:40:14] win up to the top of Carmel and he cast
[1:40:16] himself down upon the earth and he put
[1:40:19] his face between his knees and he said
[1:40:21] to his servant go up now look towards
[1:40:23] the sea and he went up and looked and
[1:40:25] said there is nothing and he said go
[1:40:28] again seven times and he came to pass at
[1:40:31] the seven time that he said the whole
[1:40:33] day arises a little cloud out of the sea
[1:40:37] like a man's hand and he said go up and
[1:40:40] say unto area prepare the chariot get
[1:40:44] thee down and and that the range-topping
[1:40:46] not in others that urgent it's more
[1:40:50] urgent than what you realize and it came
[1:40:53] to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven
[1:40:55] was black with clouds and wind and there
[1:40:58] was a great rain and they abroad and
[1:41:00] went to Jezreel any air and the hand of
[1:41:03] the Lord was on Elijah and he covered up
[1:41:06] his loins in the rain before a yet to
[1:41:09] the entrance of Jezreel Ezekiel 34 just
[1:41:14] one scripture day verse 26 and I will
[1:41:21] make them and the place is round about
[1:41:23] my you oppressing and I will cause the
[1:41:27] shower to come down in the season in
[1:41:30] there shall be showers of blessing not
[1:41:35] maybe they shall be showers of blessing
[1:41:40] just one more day in Zechariah teen the
[1:41:45] first one it's an ASCII of the Lord rain
[1:41:48] in the time of the letter e so the Lord
[1:41:53] shall make bright clouds and give them
[1:41:55] showers of rain to everyone grass in the
[1:41:59] field not to some grass to everyone
[1:42:03] so everyone this morning you cannot
[1:42:05] receive a blessing make order the
[1:42:08] blessing the reading of this word you
[1:42:09] may be seated
[1:42:18] so this morning possible almost said so
[1:42:25] much so I don't need to deal with that
[1:42:28] subject the sister Joann and sister
[1:42:32] Becky sang so much about the same
[1:42:34] subject so I don't have to deal with it
[1:42:37] all you and I have to do is get into
[1:42:41] action upon that subject I mean I have a
[1:42:46] title I hear the sound of abundance of
[1:42:48] rain amen
[1:42:50] then my subject ask for rain in the time
[1:42:54] of the latter rain so there's a season
[1:42:55] for this to happen and when the season
[1:42:58] is on you ever write to ask and my
[1:43:01] inspiration they shall be showers of
[1:43:02] blessing and I believe this morning we
[1:43:05] already felt some showers of blessing so
[1:43:09] I'm gonna float on the quotes for a bit
[1:43:10] says he and Genesis 111 let every seed
[1:43:14] bring forth of its kind so every seed
[1:43:16] according to the Word of God must brief
[1:43:18] off of its kind if it's a pumpkin
[1:43:21] it will bring forth pumpkin if it's an
[1:43:24] orange it will bring forth oranges
[1:43:26] this is young gods power to transform
[1:43:29] when he put the seed in the earth the
[1:43:31] sea can only come forth with the power
[1:43:33] of life within it if you transform it
[1:43:37] from a seed to a plant or whatever it
[1:43:40] was he is transforming power now God put
[1:43:44] the seed in there with potentials that
[1:43:47] it would be what he said it would be my
[1:43:52] so so so let's see there will be a
[1:43:55] pumpkin will be an orange a peach tree
[1:43:58] has the potentials in it and I'm
[1:44:01] speaking just of the seed now as the
[1:44:03] potentials in it to transform itself
[1:44:06] into a tree so I give you the seed and
[1:44:11] you say but I see nothing but when you
[1:44:14] you put it in the ground and it goes
[1:44:16] through the process then every leaf and
[1:44:19] every branch and every fruit is already
[1:44:22] in that seed because it has the power to
[1:44:26] transform itself into the species now so
[1:44:33] everything is there so for time sake
[1:44:37] now promises we made up of body spirit
[1:44:41] soul and then he was just dealing with
[1:44:43] it before that Christ will in his own
[1:44:45] word he says but down on the inside now
[1:44:47] is speaking of the soul the next velum
[1:44:49] the third realm is the soul and that's
[1:44:54] pretty stated by God Oh hallelujah that
[1:44:59] now watch his neck stood face with real
[1:45:02] sea germ lays it lays in the soul now
[1:45:07] the devil might get you messed up in the
[1:45:09] flesh but he can't touch your soul he
[1:45:12] might make you fall and get my make
[1:45:14] mistakes but he cannot touch the seed
[1:45:16] German your soul because that's where
[1:45:19] the real CDs and that sieve is planted
[1:45:22] by God and in their lives every promise
[1:45:26] like it is in the natural so it is in
[1:45:29] the spiritual you may be seated and in
[1:45:31] their lays every promise in you right
[1:45:34] now is adoption he say me problem yes
[1:45:38] because the see German the soul has the
[1:45:41] potential to be adopted to in his
[1:45:46] perfection in their lives and other
[1:45:49] Ephesians in the laser resurrection
[1:45:53] hallelujah in
[1:45:55] the rapture it's already in you my in
[1:45:59] there is a seventh under revival oh I
[1:46:03] love their brother Raymond I don't see
[1:46:06] just you wait the wild brother
[1:46:08] hallelujah
[1:46:10] there's a tank coming and I believe it's
[1:46:12] for now that we're gonna see is
[1:46:14] something happened like we never saw
[1:46:17] before brother hallelujah and when the
[1:46:20] rain falls on the seed it can only
[1:46:23] manifest what's on the inside I see a
[1:46:27] car like a man's and we don't never come
[1:46:31] like a man's end but we have a cloud of
[1:46:34] seven angels hallelujah you better chuck
[1:46:38] away your raincoats take away your
[1:46:41] umbrellas because it's going to rain
[1:46:51] mark you may be seated
[1:46:54] so the seat can only manifest the life
[1:46:56] that's on each side of the seed he says
[1:46:59] here now he says so I put it there's
[1:47:04] been three seats on a nice piece of old
[1:47:06] Roberts Polygram and then he couldn't
[1:47:10] say William premises and the word has
[1:47:12] been sewn on Robert suit seat for the
[1:47:15] Pentecostals pulley cream for the
[1:47:17] denominations but in turns around he
[1:47:19] says and the word has been sold
[1:47:22] now now then who was the one who saw the
[1:47:25] word and he says every city's got to
[1:47:28] bring fourth of its kind
[1:47:29] he says the Pentecostals will get more
[1:47:31] Pentecostals the denominations bully
[1:47:34] cream will get more denominations but
[1:47:37] you know what it says but the word is
[1:47:39] gonna produce sons and daughters of God
[1:47:43] hallelujah praise God if they got more
[1:47:47] Pentecostals if they got more
[1:47:49] denominations well then this is coming -
[1:47:52] there's gonna be sons and daughters of
[1:47:55] God upon the face of the earth that is
[1:47:58] coming - Amen hallelujah he says look at
[1:48:05] the great letter rain
[1:48:06] what is it supposed to do and how they
[1:48:09] would run and leap over walls and how
[1:48:11] they'd be in once an army coming he says
[1:48:15] you just wait a minute aha the kind of
[1:48:17] crop you get is a kind of seed you put
[1:48:19] in the field now he says they'll run in
[1:48:24] leap over walls he says is this the sign
[1:48:28] of the answer what if it is something to
[1:48:31] let us know how to enter into the
[1:48:33] rapture in faith now what I'm preaching
[1:48:35] is not that you don't know this has been
[1:48:37] preached over and over which is
[1:48:39] anointing it again we just taken it
[1:48:42] again in chocolate in the enemy's face
[1:48:44] to let them know there's gonna be a
[1:48:46] rapture to let him know there's gonna be
[1:48:48] a revival and nothing would stop it
[1:48:51] brother
[1:48:52] what if it is - something to let us know
[1:48:55] how but the chance to enter into rapture
[1:48:58] in faith easy when we run in leap over
[1:49:01] walls
[1:49:02] is there something fixing to happen that
[1:49:04] is all marvel bodies are gonna be
[1:49:07] changed can I love to see it all or is
[1:49:10] it so close that our seat is thus the
[1:49:13] generation sirs by prison what time is
[1:49:16] it we are yet so brother branham 962
[1:49:20] felt already that this is about to
[1:49:23] happen he says the Lord is he so close I
[1:49:26] can feel it is it gonna happen in my day
[1:49:28] but they didn't happen in his name but
[1:49:31] there's another people in the land Oh
[1:49:33] hallelujah
[1:49:34] and I believe you the part of their
[1:49:36] people there's another people in the
[1:49:38] land who under the messenger will be the
[1:49:42] final voice to the final age she will
[1:49:47] become the mouthpiece of God hallelujah
[1:49:50] should speak for God Oh hallelujah
[1:49:54] it's also my subject here you must watch
[1:49:58] the latter Lane is the point I'm
[1:50:00] bringing now what's the matter now she's
[1:50:02] now waiting for the latter rain that's
[1:50:05] when she produces the fruits hallelujah
[1:50:10] so when that rain falls brother it will
[1:50:13] produce the fruits and when the fruits
[1:50:18] begins to come
[1:50:19] it means it's harvest time then you mean
[1:50:24] it means the sowing season is over so
[1:50:29] lord help us together token now we need
[1:50:34] to have it now we have to apply it now
[1:50:37] because they come a time when it has to
[1:50:39] go on display and when it's displaying
[1:50:41] time you can't apply mine so he said
[1:50:47] yeah every seed will bring forth of its
[1:50:51] kind now I like this one in masterpiece
[1:50:54] brother Bello
[1:50:55] it says at the harvest time the series
[1:50:57] back to the original condition in other
[1:51:00] words it went through all the stages
[1:51:01] it says young and must have all the word
[1:51:05] in order to be the see now what is next
[1:51:11] word it says now you can't ever alpha
[1:51:13] seed it won't grow it's got to be the
[1:51:19] whole seed
[1:51:22] man come on now you can't ever half a
[1:51:26] seed in other words you can't take part
[1:51:30] of the message you can't say no I
[1:51:32] believe only this and I only take that
[1:51:35] no you've gotta take the whole seed and
[1:51:37] the whole seed will bring forth a
[1:51:40] harvest
[1:51:40] you cannot plant our four seed it won't
[1:51:43] grow hallelujah
[1:51:48] good to see you so so so we got a
[1:51:51] plan to every promise I can't just
[1:51:54] haven't believe this and I believe in
[1:51:56] the snow I gotta take the whole thing
[1:51:57] and that will bring our mamas to the to
[1:52:01] the season I've planted my know you may
[1:52:05] be seated
[1:52:06] now I normally don't say this but I I
[1:52:08] want to get through this now now I told
[1:52:12] in Minister one time I said a brother
[1:52:15] you can't so I did it and then and
[1:52:18] expect to reap love you want to say what
[1:52:24] I'm saying so so we when you sow the
[1:52:27] seed then is what you're gonna reap and
[1:52:31] though you saw it where people might not
[1:52:35] see it but you see when the harvest
[1:52:37] comes when the rain falls then we see no
[1:52:42] no no matter what you said here if
[1:52:44] you're not sewing from here in the time
[1:52:50] of the harvest you're gonna be ashamed
[1:52:53] you're gonna stay in the shame you gonna
[1:52:55] know what to do so brother I talked
[1:52:58] about the broom we spoke I said you know
[1:53:01] it's time we go into action we can't say
[1:53:06] that all the time love one another
[1:53:07] forgive one another I mean we seen it
[1:53:10] but I'm told we must put it into action
[1:53:14] so know what the send me something
[1:53:19] process you know the biggest enemy has
[1:53:21] seized is himself and we make enemies of
[1:53:25] other people but the biggest enemy is
[1:53:27] yourself and he says you know a dead man
[1:53:29] you can kick him ills oh my the bodies
[1:53:33] will just
[1:53:34] you can curse him and that body will
[1:53:37] just list off you can swim you can stomp
[1:53:41] on him it is a dead man
[1:53:43] but you see they stone to many of us
[1:53:46] that's alive
[1:53:47] oh you rub someone the wrong way brother
[1:53:50] and you'll see what comes out but this
[1:53:53] morning I believe is a cloud this rain
[1:53:56] there's a power this design that occurs
[1:53:59] here
[1:54:00] through Europe seeing the Undertaker's
[1:54:03] here brother - let us die die to
[1:54:06] ourselves mine I feel not knowing on
[1:54:17] there but the fury
[1:54:18] so you see you maybe see we are
[1:54:20] challenged by that you know suddenly
[1:54:25] someone comes along my name we don't get
[1:54:27] along so good and all of a sudden we'd
[1:54:29] we make a u-turn or we go the opposite
[1:54:33] direction you see what God is gonna keep
[1:54:37] that person there until you die you can
[1:54:43] run from this church to another Church
[1:54:45] there's gonna be another person there
[1:54:47] just like that person oh my god is smart
[1:54:52] man he knows how to kill us all this
[1:54:55] happens so that we must die
[1:55:01] and I this thing for the person is to
[1:55:04] die because we want to be right we want
[1:55:07] our way we want to I'm gonna get back at
[1:55:10] him I'm waiting my chance
[1:55:12] and for years I walk with that thing now
[1:55:15] just waiting for one loop oh brother
[1:55:17] Branham says three kinds of believers he
[1:55:20] says you have the unbeliever you have
[1:55:23] the make-believe and you have the
[1:55:24] believer the believer believer he says
[1:55:28] but the West guys is a make believer he
[1:55:30] says he'll wait all his life just to get
[1:55:34] you and find the loophole and brother he
[1:55:39] says that the most dangerous guy but I
[1:55:42] believe I'm speaking to believers this
[1:55:44] morning so again four times that you may
[1:55:55] be seated he says in original seed he
[1:55:58] says there of the word Moriah which
[1:56:01] means the teaching brain and this is the
[1:56:05] teaching rain and then you have a
[1:56:07] harvest rain and some of the small and
[1:56:10] when we woke up it was raining another
[1:56:13] my I'm preaching this morning I hear the
[1:56:15] sound of abundance of rain and all week
[1:56:18] it was good weather but when I got up I
[1:56:20] said man Lord it's raining made rain in
[1:56:23] here man
[1:56:24] my flirtini earth must flat out here oh
[1:56:29] so he says there's a full rein this is
[1:56:31] the foreman right now I'll just cut it
[1:56:33] short he says is you're teaching rain it
[1:56:36] says then the the latter rain let your
[1:56:40] harvest rain and that brings this is
[1:56:43] where he said it brings that starts your
[1:56:46] crop growing then just before it matures
[1:56:49] there comes another rain a purposes
[1:56:52] that's what they call the harvest rain I
[1:56:54] mean I went with these spring rains
[1:56:56] right about June it makes your crop now
[1:56:59] the rain we find out was the Spirit
[1:57:04] so the rain is the Holy Spirit and so
[1:57:07] teaching rain former rain and then you
[1:57:09] have your harvest rain which is the
[1:57:11] letter rain that makes your crop
[1:57:13] oh that's very important because you can
[1:57:17] have the seed but you don't have the
[1:57:18] rain there's nothing to cook in the seed
[1:57:22] so we need the rain friends we need
[1:57:26] every blessing we walk in that door we
[1:57:28] must come in here so hungry so thirsty
[1:57:31] so anointed so played up so hungry that
[1:57:36] that that God sees that and that he
[1:57:39] fills us out that when we leave our our
[1:57:43] lives are changed the same is quickened
[1:57:45] and and the pastor don't have to come in
[1:57:48] no you already anointed you came with
[1:57:51] your fire you can't prayed up you
[1:57:55] dropped your odds there's no more
[1:57:58] grudges you don't feel funny when you
[1:58:00] see someone you know what I'm saying
[1:58:03] because your love is grown in sister
[1:58:07] Peggy so if I have no charity if I
[1:58:10] didn't grow it shows I'm still immature
[1:58:17] but brother when you meet mature people
[1:58:20] oh my goodness Oh there'll be a revival
[1:58:25] in this place I tell you New York will
[1:58:28] be shaking like never Bishop before Oh
[1:58:30] hallelujah he said yes original city and
[1:58:35] speaking of the disciples he says they
[1:58:37] hold themselves to the upper room now
[1:58:39] listen to this this these were the seeds
[1:58:42] the seeds was a word and the word was
[1:58:44] lain in they without life on it
[1:58:47] now they walked with Jesus for three and
[1:58:49] a half years and they had the seed in
[1:58:52] them but no life yet that's why Peter
[1:58:55] could deny the Lord he even had a
[1:58:58] revelation and it's that what he said so
[1:59:01] you can't even go in on your revelation
[1:59:05] mainly said well I have a revelation
[1:59:07] that's good but you see it takes
[1:59:10] revelation and manifestation when the
[1:59:13] two gets together then that's the
[1:59:16] interpretation so you can tell me all of
[1:59:30] your revelation but brother the
[1:59:33] manifestation speak for itself
[1:59:35] and all of a sudden they came a song
[1:59:37] from evidence the waters begin to gush
[1:59:39] down and actually felt all those where
[1:59:41] they were sitting and the seeds what sir
[1:59:44] now begin to grow but Jim right so it
[1:59:47] says and they begin to manifest itself
[1:59:50] and the Word of God was being made
[1:59:52] manifest so watch it then they went to
[1:59:55] the up room they had the seats there but
[1:59:58] there was no life on it and then they
[2:00:01] were waiting for the promise and all of
[2:00:03] a sudden suddenly the Bible says
[2:00:05] here come the waters and begin to cast
[2:00:08] down where did it go brother it never
[2:00:10] went to Caiaphas it never went to the
[2:00:12] temple it went to and the seed was
[2:00:15] that's why it's so important to have the
[2:00:18] seed in you
[2:00:19] [Applause]
[2:00:22] hallelujah it's important we have the
[2:00:25] right seed it's important to have the
[2:00:27] seed sowed in your heart because I'm
[2:00:30] telling you the rain is coming I hear
[2:00:34] the sound of the bundles of rain
[2:00:36] I hear the promises I hear there's gonna
[2:00:38] be a revival
[2:00:40] I hear this who's gonna be changed and
[2:00:43] continued my brother our children is
[2:00:46] coming man I don't care how backslidden
[2:00:48] they are are they coming I hear the
[2:00:53] sound of abundance of rain you made me
[2:01:01] see that promises they were even cowards
[2:01:06] the disciples who come words but they
[2:01:08] hold themselves with a broom the seeds
[2:01:11] planted by the son of man for three and
[2:01:13] a half years the season had no life in
[2:01:15] him and then all of a sudden the waters
[2:01:17] begin to gush down and begin to grow and
[2:01:19] manifest himself Jesus says he planted
[2:01:22] the seeds the Holy Ghost reign
[2:01:24] manifested the sea and out they went the
[2:01:26] disciples then they watch now the seeds
[2:01:30] went to life a few days before they they
[2:01:33] had nothing what you see it turns
[2:01:37] overnight yummy today Saints it turns
[2:01:44] overnight suddenly suddenly changes and
[2:01:49] all of a sudden Leah come the water and
[2:01:52] God and thrown himself on Peters heart
[2:01:54] and all of a sudden Peter became the
[2:01:57] spokesperson the very one that denied
[2:01:59] him the very one that everyone looked
[2:02:01] down upon God raised him up maybe in the
[2:02:05] spokesperson sit on his heart
[2:02:11] hallelujah set upon his heart and all of
[2:02:14] a sudden what happened there was a
[2:02:16] change and everyone thought this is the
[2:02:19] same old Peter brother no it wasn't it
[2:02:22] was a different Peter why the Holy
[2:02:24] Spirit came upon the seed quicker needed
[2:02:27] to life and brother there was a
[2:02:29] different man now
[2:02:30] now I send himself upon the floor and
[2:02:35] you remember Ananias and Sapphira they
[2:02:38] tried to like speed no brother
[2:02:41] there was a change I wanna tell you
[2:02:44] there's a change coming God is coming
[2:02:46] upon your heart you keep pressing you
[2:02:49] keep going no matter it might look like
[2:02:52] you're a coward but you keep going
[2:02:54] brother but be sure you in a broom Judas
[2:02:59] walked out to remember he walked away
[2:03:01] but Judas walked out but Jesus about
[2:03:07] Peter walked in hallelujah better be at
[2:03:10] the right place we metanoid did strikes

[2:03:31] had happened you may be seated
[2:03:33] such as I have rise up and the Lord went
[2:03:36] to that LHS confirming the word with
[2:03:38] signs wonders and the Bible says they
[2:03:41] were ignorant in unload but they take
[2:03:42] heat they took heed they were with Jesus

[2:03:48] one spoken over the original seat and
[2:03:50] what they trying to do they trying to
[2:03:52] manufacture a letter rain not it's my

[2:12:45] thing is real man hallelujah he says and
[2:12:58] I'm see sign but the Word of God has
[2:12:59] been sowed also and when the Spirit of
[2:13:01] God begins to fall the Word of God will
[2:13:03] love in the people the false bride has
[2:13:06] committed adultery when brought herself
[2:13:08] into crease and sold out the price will
[2:13:11] reward a confederation of church that's
[2:13:13] to be bound and burned like the phones
[2:13:16] and vessels but where the word has been
[2:13:18] sold into the people's heart it will
[2:13:21] reap a bride for Christ as certain as
[2:13:25] I'm standing here so as as a word has
[2:13:29] been sowed into your hearts he says that
[2:13:32] will rip a bride for Christ oh you you
[2:13:35] should appreciate your minister he's
[2:13:37] preaching the Word of God brother that's
[2:13:40] gonna produce a bride for Christ it will
[2:13:43] be prideful price hallelujah the false
[2:13:48] bride will Reaper will Council of
[2:13:50] Churches but the word that's been sold
[2:13:52] will reap a prideful Christ brother
[2:13:55] there's nothing gonna stop it but the
[2:13:57] chance the more I think of it man
[2:13:59] nothing can stop that we think things go
[2:14:02] wrong but with garbage going right
[2:14:07] I don't know if I must say this I said
[2:14:13] it before remember Jonah he was supposed
[2:14:19] to go down to none other but the man
[2:14:21] goes down to Tasha's disobedient and
[2:14:24] what he does goes through the bottom of
[2:14:27] the ship and goes in sleep on the job
[2:14:32] and while he's laying there all of a
[2:14:34] sudden she's in trouble the shop they
[2:14:38] chucked over the cargo and everything
[2:14:40] and it's still in trouble
[2:14:41] eventually they finally maybe says oh
[2:14:43] you know the story and he thought well
[2:14:46] if I if I can commit suicide get rid of
[2:14:49] me it would be okay chuck me over and
[2:14:52] then they charted he told him sorry I'm
[2:14:55] the problem Chuck me over me they only
[2:14:58] talked him over what did God do had a
[2:15:02] mess of fish they repaired fish
[2:15:04] swallowed him Francis went to the bottom
[2:15:07] of the ceased there's two day for three
[2:15:09] nights a late day third day thing shakes
[2:15:13] up swims all the way Shh yeah through
[2:15:16] the waters where is it going to none of
[2:15:22] her brother misses it none of her
[2:15:25] worship the fish God and he comes right
[2:15:28] up to the banks opens his mouth Aeneid
[2:15:31] Jonah comes walking out this is when he
[2:15:34] preached all sincere repentance now when
[2:15:38] we looked at it we know Jonah was back
[2:15:40] slidden something went wrong the man was
[2:15:42] out of the world the man made the
[2:15:44] biggest mistake Jesus comes around in
[2:15:47] Matthew he says as Jonah was in the
[2:15:50] belly of the whale three days in three
[2:15:53] nights so must the Son of Man
[2:15:57] belly of the earth for three days and
[2:15:59] nights so the man wasn't best little man
[2:16:02] we think it went wrong no we twins right
[2:16:05] oh yes fire year man you may be seated
[2:16:21] so you see when we we as human beings we
[2:16:24] think things go wrong it doesn't not
[2:16:27] with God and if it looks wrong it works
[2:16:32] to these wool hey hey
[2:16:37] God is smarter and if you don't add I'll
[2:16:40] actually you gonna you in for problems
[2:16:42] you better die as quick as you can
[2:16:46] because you're gonna be faced with
[2:16:48] challenges I'd rather face it now give
[2:16:51] me Lord kill me kill me take Lord I want
[2:16:54] to die to myself wow the let rain will
[2:16:59] speed the world there was nothing much
[2:17:01] there they won't be able to shut them up
[2:17:03] because they're gonna take them up so
[2:17:06] the harbor's rain now watch what this is
[2:17:09] Kenya in the church ages God isn't gonna
[2:17:11] plant a new church but it's gonna bring
[2:17:14] east or regional planting back to
[2:17:15] original seed he's doing it as stated in
[2:17:18] verse 23 the Chhotu by the teaching rain
[2:17:21] of the former rain next yeah what it
[2:17:25] says next we'll come to harvest rain
[2:17:29] well theory or rapture in faith oh I
[2:17:36] hope you caught that he says we had the
[2:17:40] former name but next will come the
[2:17:44] harvest rain actually faith know what
[2:17:48] these are actually free you mean the
[2:17:50] latter rain barrel Raymond that we're
[2:17:51] waiting on that will bring the rapture
[2:17:53] afraid yes you see a power like you
[2:17:57] never seen before pepper green rapturing
[2:18:00] face that would be the thunders we made
[2:18:02] man
[2:18:03] it will be the bride's revival for show
[2:18:06] how to go that let the rain is fixin to
[2:18:08] fall wait to them seven thunders at
[2:18:12] nights after that group hallelujah it
[2:18:18] was slicing Cardinals shop heavens
[2:18:22] so the leper a brother he says is as
[2:18:25] leper in harvest rain or rapture in
[2:18:28] faith you choose what you want to call
[2:18:30] it but rather I like it you're actually
[2:18:33] faith and there's only one thing that
[2:18:35] gives you Reb to be faith that's at
[2:18:37] seven thunders brother believe me from
[2:18:40] being underneath that seventh seal to
[2:18:42] keep the pride ratcheting faith and
[2:18:44] while the word has been preached you get
[2:18:46] him straight in there brother you don't
[2:18:48] know God is heading all the time and
[2:18:51] you've been pulled up we thank God for
[2:18:53] what they did and what is gonna do but
[2:18:55] right now you know what is he doing he's
[2:18:57] giving you faith forward brother Raymond
[2:19:03] for the rapture my you maybe see this he
[2:19:18] says here the seven thunders will give
[2:19:19] the bride reps in faith show how to go
[2:19:22] prepare for correct translation faith
[2:19:24] they change them of the body that's all
[2:19:26] I like Jesus keeps all his appointments
[2:19:29] I says that's the way God is brought his
[2:19:32] church from justification sanctification
[2:19:35] peps of the Holy Ghost and now the
[2:19:39] Ministry of the Spirit which is what
[2:19:42] quickens the word that ministry in the
[2:19:45] church will have to be just exactly like
[2:19:48] his so all the years we had the teaching
[2:19:52] brain for moraine we had the word with
[2:19:54] her with the word but in this hour
[2:19:57] now comes the latter name and he says
[2:20:01] it's the Ministry of the Spirit so the
[2:20:04] Spirit comes down now and minister to
[2:20:07] the word that's already in you and that
[2:20:10] would be exactly like the minister he
[2:20:12] head
[2:20:13] okay can I preach now okay he says now
[2:20:18] spoken originals he see now why I've
[2:20:21] been so zealous of the kind of seed that
[2:20:24] i planted for the body he says the rain
[2:20:28] is gonna fall pretty soon I mean the
[2:20:30] real rain and it's good to have seen two
[2:20:33] fallen I hope I live to see it
[2:20:36] do you understand our congregation says
[2:20:39] Amen it will be the Living Word as it
[2:20:42] was in the beginning the spoken word of
[2:20:44] God heavys power
[2:20:46] what sees him in his own body working
[2:20:49] his way but the joy I went to look up
[2:20:54] brother Branham didn't use the word soul
[2:20:58] he says I be zealous of the seed that I
[2:21:01] planted oh you better stay with me ya
[2:21:08] know there's a difference between sowing
[2:21:11] and planting you know what I said what
[2:21:16] goes out that's what it does but when
[2:21:21] you plant something brother you dig a
[2:21:24] hole you you make sure that's always
[2:21:27] deeply enough man old what's gonna be
[2:21:30] planted then you make a whole day in
[2:21:31] there and then you put the seed in there
[2:21:34] there's a difference between sowing and
[2:21:37] planting so brother ben says I've been
[2:21:40] very zealous of the seed that I planted
[2:21:43] for for the body so we not talking of
[2:21:49] denominations and Pentecostals and
[2:21:51] Catholics now I'm worried what did he
[2:21:53] plan for the body I want to know what
[2:21:56] did he plan for me for you oh and I'm
[2:22:00] yet to stop you gotta find out what's
[2:22:03] been planted not sold because if you
[2:22:06] read Matthew I happy there he says the
[2:22:08] sower went out to sow some Feldman's
[2:22:11] rocks and he says there was no earth so
[2:22:14] they didn't grow deep enough when the
[2:22:15] Sun came up its scourge them and what
[2:22:18] happened they fell away some were sown
[2:22:23] among stones
[2:22:24] and when they came up the phones begin
[2:22:27] to tow them and they were there the way
[2:22:29] oh my goodness hallelujah and there's no
[2:22:41] tip and that some fell among phones and
[2:22:44] other ones he said some fell amongst
[2:22:46] only groans only places no depth he says
[2:22:49] others was just laying on the ground you
[2:22:51] may be seated
[2:22:52] watching out suing the others was just
[2:22:55] laying on the ground and this is the
[2:22:57] fault of the a just came in took it in
[2:22:59] other words you hardly out of the
[2:23:01] service and the phone's already come and
[2:23:06] they take that seed I challenge the
[2:23:10] church back home I said you know if I
[2:23:12] must ask you what scripture was irate
[2:23:14] immediately after the meeting many
[2:23:17] people will be ashamed you know what I'm
[2:23:21] saying so we can't play Church anymore
[2:23:25] we too far off the road you can't be on
[2:23:29] the fence even you gotta take a stain
[2:23:33] and say yeah I stay let the whole world
[2:23:36] know doesn't matter it doesn't matter oh
[2:23:39] come on go yeah I stained mother says he
[2:23:44] like someone that Spain's for something
[2:23:46] right Oh mom what is staining but when
[2:23:48] you get a guy that's on the fence you
[2:23:50] never know he's either gonna fall that
[2:23:52] way or that way brother
[2:23:55] take someone that knows way stainless as
[2:23:57] a revelation it is not the word has been
[2:24:00] so many soul brother there's nothing
[2:24:03] using this has come that has come but
[2:24:07] the main sense pain how are you still
[2:24:09] standing it's not me something is only
[2:24:11] needs not myself but something holding
[2:24:14] me I mean no matter what happens
[2:24:19] something holds you
[2:24:21] [Applause]
[2:24:28] so he said I've been zealous and I
[2:24:30] looked up that word zealous oh my
[2:24:32] there's so many meanings fervent ardent
[2:24:36] it says you're passionate devout devoted
[2:24:42] committed dedicated enthusiastic eager
[2:24:46] key my she the toes have been zealous
[2:24:52] all that fancy day so you think he just
[2:24:55] now all that has been preached but he
[2:24:59] planted seeds for the body so you can
[2:25:02] have a whole teaching on Rome and what
[2:25:04] the book it's not helping me I'm not
[2:25:08] gonna be I went over there you're not
[2:25:11] gonna be here but tell me what any plan
[2:25:15] for the body so when you pull out that
[2:25:17] and bridge that to me that excites me
[2:25:21] brother that makes me feel I wanna come
[2:25:24] back to church I don't want to come into
[2:25:26] a holding in adventure no I want
[2:25:29] something with this life something that
[2:25:32] quickens our word in my soul and it
[2:25:34] brings me to life brother that's why
[2:25:36] people you find out they only wanna go
[2:25:39] to church because the church is paid but
[2:25:42] if the church is alive hey brother I
[2:25:44] tell you they can't wait for the doors
[2:25:46] to open why because the word is gonna
[2:25:49] come home quicken their souls and bring
[2:25:52] the word that's in them to life Amina I
[2:25:58] feel the Noize in your mind I feel the
[2:26:02] freedom of speaking like this I feel I
[2:26:04] mean freedom or say the Holy Spirit say
[2:26:08] say brother Paloma speak the world over
[2:26:11] the people
[2:26:15] [Applause]
[2:26:25] my so he planted special a brother
[2:26:30] Robledo exclusive pride promises so this
[2:26:36] that we preach you maybe see that is for
[2:26:37] the bride that's why we preach it the
[2:26:40] way we do you say vibranium I had it a
[2:26:42] thousand times I don't give you thirty
[2:26:44] ten thousand times one day it's gonna
[2:26:49] take life amen
[2:26:52] Peter said though you know it but I'm
[2:26:54] only putting you in remembrance your

[2:27:39] seat of the scornful but his delight is
[2:27:41] in the law of the Lord and in his law
[2:27:44] doth he meditate day and night watch he
[2:27:47] shall be like a tree planted where

[2:30:58] word when it was sold and she'll be
[2:31:02] right there when it sticks he says he
[2:31:04] planted not just stuck down he actually
[2:31:06] planted so this is what made me realize
[2:31:09] that promises planted there's a big
[2:31:13] difference brother so once you plant it
[2:31:17] it's not by chance that's my sister's
[2:31:21] boning I don't believe you here my
[2:31:22] chance then he turns around he says
[2:31:30] there's a lot of difference between
[2:31:32] sticking a stick in a ground then
[2:31:33] planting something it's different the
[2:31:36] seed was planted and it found its roots
[2:31:38] homes when the water begin to come in
[2:31:41] and pray forth in life the spirit oh
[2:31:45] yeah he's the SS what the restoration

[2:31:59] not wither no no no no matter what they
[2:32:02] do they'll never kill that tree they
[2:32:05] tried for 2,000 years to kill the tree
[2:32:08] it's what they will never kill the tree
[2:32:10] they tried how many years
[2:32:13] they start couldn't kill the tree the
[2:32:15] tree keeps growing hallelujah
[2:32:20] [Applause]
[2:32:22] he says here why it's where it's planted
[2:32:26] that's what does it
[2:32:28] it sways planted he's planted by the
[2:32:30] rivers of water now notice they will
[2:32:32] save his roots will die what if a man is
[2:32:35] planted in such a thing by the river
[2:32:37] with the springs he says nine different
[2:32:39] Springs feeding into him what an
[2:32:43] establishment he is and a man thus
[2:32:46] planted by the river the spirit of water
[2:32:49] rivers of water oh one water one spirit
[2:32:52] they are gifts of healing spirit of
[2:32:54] prophecy spirit of this but many gifts

[2:38:30] many concrete blocks the enemy puts on
[2:38:32] you you are coming through brother
[2:38:34] you're gonna crack it you're gonna break
[2:38:36] it
[2:38:38] you're gonna come out of there you
[2:38:40] coming out of that slammer I don't care
[2:38:43] what the devil put on you you coming
[2:38:45] through that brother and you know I seen
[2:38:47] brother Robledo
[2:38:48] if he doesn't connect the block it will

[2:38:58] don't know a way he's gonna do it I
[2:39:00] don't know how he's gonna do it but one
[2:39:02] thing I know he's gonna do it keep
[2:39:05] pressing keep pressing keep pressing my
[2:39:14] brother burner you maybe see that you
[2:39:16] came from beyond the curtain a time and
[2:39:18] the angel told him keep pressing yumemi
[2:39:21] ask him as i go back to that old carcass
[2:39:23] he says and then the boy said when you
[2:39:26] woke up keep pressing there's a work for
[2:39:29] you stuff to do this work for us to do
[2:39:32] why do you think God is on this planet
[2:39:34] oh there's a work for you to do man
[2:39:37] don't shirk your responsibilities
[2:39:41] hallelujah my so the now I like this
[2:39:47] honor the prophets world at this moment
[2:39:49] is hanging over Rome and what they
[2:39:51] supposed to do it's hanging over the
[2:39:54] Antichrist and what he's supposed to do
[2:39:56] with prophets what is hanging right over
[2:39:57] the world countable churches and what
[2:39:59] they supposed to do the prophets word is
[2:40:02] hanging over all the branches sodomites
[2:40:04] and what they supposed to do but the
[2:40:09] prophets word is also hanging over the
[2:40:12] prize my I say over every person here
[2:40:15] this morning that 7th Underwood hanging
[2:40:18] over you with a promise Joseph scoot
[2:40:22] hanging over you brother so much so that
[2:40:25] he cannot even see your mistakes because
[2:40:28] when he looks down he sees the blood he
[2:40:31] sees the rainbow color coat so we can't
[2:40:33] even see your mistakes so don't let the
[2:40:37] devil condemn you because you made a
[2:40:40] mistake
[2:40:40] and I feel you can't come back to God
[2:40:43] promises been the quickest thing to do
[2:40:45] repent then come back he says and God
[2:40:48] says in his word he's faithful and just
[2:40:50] to forgive you
[2:40:52] so you walk around you run away you do
[2:40:55] everything but all this is just confess
[2:40:57] your sin and I'm faithful and just to
[2:40:59] forgive you so easy and it puts you back

[2:41:17] until this is the message of the former
[2:41:19] rain then you rejected another regional
[2:41:23] branch to bring forth so okay now watch
[2:41:27] out like this on Matthew 15:30 and we
[2:41:29] said every plant which my Heavenly
[2:41:31] Father has not planted shall be rooted
[2:41:33] up so you see everything that's in your
[2:41:38] life that's not planted by God God is
[2:41:40] gonna uproot it you see brother a man

[2:44:39] from the roots so okay Elijah we read
[2:44:43] the scripture and the Bible says he told
[2:44:45] His Messenger all of a sudden now
[2:44:47] remember there was a drought for for
[2:44:49] three and a half years and he told am
[2:44:51] not even do Rhema for unless it come by
[2:44:54] my word so there was a drought and then
[2:44:58] they begin to look for Elijah and when
[2:45:00] they found him the AFC's years who won
[2:45:02] the trouble of Easter I said ah you got
[2:45:05] it wrong you blaming the wrong man you
[2:45:07] the one that caused the trouble he was
[2:45:09] the one that's brought the problems so
[2:45:11] don't blame me he says but listen you
[2:45:14] better go eat and drink because I hear
[2:45:17] the sound of abundance of rain listen
[2:45:20] you better go have you last time go have
[2:45:22] your Joel in the world go do it for the
[2:45:24] law but is for me I hear the sound of
[2:45:27] abundance of rain brother listen it was
[2:45:31] really a true child of God he would have
[2:45:33] stayed with Elijah but the Bible says he
[2:45:36] went to go eat and drink you know what
[2:45:40] I'm saying he's the wind in the face of
[2:45:42] that but brother Elijah I had a
[2:45:45] revelation he spoke it before he saw it
[2:45:48] oh I hope you caught that he spoke his
[2:45:52] revelation before he saw it he said I in
[2:45:55] the sole abundance of rain and the Bible
[2:45:58] says him in old and I'm gonna have his
[2:46:01] party but then he went to the
[2:46:03] Mountaineer brother and some Brown says
[2:46:05] he climbed the mountain to the top and
[2:46:06] they set with his head between his head
[2:46:09] and he said Ghazi come here go and look
[2:46:11] through these and see what you said he
[2:46:13] came and he came running back as his
[2:46:15] master I see nothing he says go back
[2:46:17] seven times
[2:46:19] man and the Bible says on the seventh
[2:46:22] time when he climbed those seven steps
[2:46:24] all the way from faith all the way to
[2:46:27] charity and then when he looked there
[2:46:29] was a different on the seventh time
[2:46:34] hallelujah and when he looked and there
[2:46:36] was a cloud the size of a man's means
[2:46:39] the baby says you know what that was he
[2:46:42] ran back down the mountain he said
[2:46:44] bright I saw a cloud like a man's and
[2:46:46] brother it says Elisha saw Jesus when he
[2:46:53] had that in you that's Jesus man then he
[2:46:57] said listen you better run to Jezreel
[2:46:59] tell him to song the rain barrels
[2:47:02] because I hear the sound of abundance of
[2:47:05] rain he says you better go before the
