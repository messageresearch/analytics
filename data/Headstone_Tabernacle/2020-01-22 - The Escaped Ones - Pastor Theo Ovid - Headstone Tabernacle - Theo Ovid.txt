wanna read verse 1 to 10 Ezekiel chapter 24 verse 24 thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign according to all that he had done shall he do when this commit he shall know that I am the Lord God also no son of man shall it not be in the day when I took from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of the eyes and that whereupon they set their minds their sons and the daughters that he that escaped it in that day shall come unto thee to cause thee to hear it with thine ears in that day shall thy might be open to him which is escaped and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb and all shall be a sign unto them and they shall know that I am the Lord 2nd Peter 1 we have a voice 1 Simon Peter servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to them that are obtained like precious feet with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you to the knowledge of God and our Jesus our Lord according as his divine power had given to us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that call us to glory and virtue whereby a given to us exceeding great and precious promises that by deeds he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this given all diligence up to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity and if these things be in you and abound they shall make you leti shall neither be barren on full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he had lack of these things is blind cannot see a foul had forgotten that he was putting resolved since wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your call and election sure for if we do these things he shall never fall may God bless his word you may be seated our title tonight the escaped ones let's that have that the escape one the escaped ones and you know America started off as a lamb and the Bible speaks that he would speak like a dragon and what we have seen unfold in being fought be if we are not writing for the eyes is the dismantling of democracy that's what you see in the dismantling of democracy it has to happen because the lamb have to speak like a dragon and things have to happen to turn a lamb in the dragon and the Prophet said there were raised up a pharaoh that knew not Joseph and Joseph represent freedom of religion see so therefore it will be a force system and take away the freedom from the people freedom of religion and I want to just go back to Revelation chapter 13 and read something from the earth to his tree said I saw one of his heads talking about the beasts it was wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast and they will ship the Dragon which gave power unto the beasts so the beasts have to be empowered let's continue let's go and they worshipped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to walk with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months and he open his mouth and blasphemy against God the blasphemous name his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given on him over all Kindred's and tongues and Nations this is not skim milk this is the word we're eating you know and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world not some all therefore all those who will escape that's you know the bride gonna be the ones that are gonna be not gonna escape on everybody else going to worship the beasts and the B system watch if any man an a let him hear he that liveth leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints and I beheld another beast coming out of the earth he had two horns like a lamb and he speaks as a dragon and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed where she Noah's Pig and Rome turn to Papa room let's continue and he do a great wonders so he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and did he see that them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast seen unto them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beasts which had the wound by a sword and did live hallelujah make what image unto the Beast and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast so the image to our power in itself the image has to be given power hallelujah hallelujah and he had power to give life under the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here his wisdom let him that had understanding Kong the number of the beast for it is a number of a man is number six hundred threescore and six 666 it's not something tonight all glory to God to the Bible identify the image and to the beasts or praise God you know and the thing of it is in the beginning in Genesis God said let us make man in our image and likeness hallelujah and God put an image with first created image isn't that right once the flesh man yet and God put this flesh man in the body isn't that right that man couldn't feel that man could not fall that was the original man isn't that right and got completed creation with a man that was in power a man that was in Dominion because the man himself as a son had a reflect God and to reflect God you have to influence his attributes so he said let us make man let her have dominion over over over over everything that creepeth upon the earth so man wasn't was supposed to be a conqueror overcomer a Dominator is that right hallelujah man was supposed to be in control of in charge of ruling over that was man and God's original intent but you a by-product because Eve was a by-product of the man hallelujah she was not in the original she pulled out of e a man and that became the woman isn't it right Satan didn't approach the man he approached the woman we know the story and man fell but God promised to restore brains got your gets caught in that God promised to restore because court had a plan to bring right man right back [Applause] and I've got news for you tonight you live in in the verge of the manifestation of the fulfillment of the plan that God had since man fell God always was going to bring back man back to his original condition back to his first created image so just as a piece of an image we have an image that images faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity is men right and the mystery of God come down from God as the word of God and the world is being preached and the world come as a seed and that image coming to you in seed form by the word of promises and Peter said by these promises not by these explanation by these promises you have become a potato of His divine nature but power total power power after commentator image and we are promised dynamics we are promised charity we are promised the price absolute isn't that right power down Oh hallelujah hallelujah two images going to be empowered you may be seated praise God the ears of the beasts versus the image of God isn't that something let's continue know anyone who can explain anything you don't have to accept it anymore by feet if these things that we cannot explain that we have to accept my feet we cannot explain God no man can explain God he is sovereign he is great and mighty we just accept it because we know he is there and then I our faith and accepting it he brings the response back to us the baptism of the holy spirit so the baptism the Holy Spirit comes in response to your acceptance by fate cordis and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness because in this last is it wouldn't be two churches or two groups there be two Macs are they I get the Mac of God or look at the Mac of the beasts let me see it good tonight there were just two max is got six is the twenty it's just blue Oh glory of God and you come to church tonight to get mocked by God because in Ezekiel 9 Oh glory of God the slaughtering angels was meant to kill utterly young an old nails female little children but come not near any man let that man and course and a prophet to bring a revelation of the mouth of God or the seal of God every mystery is to bring a seal in your life there's only seven seals or to the Lord a shout Oh glory to God you'll be sealed by the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost go with God they be seated but a Branham dear brother and sister if you haven't got the popular Holy Ghost this morning we run into the kingdom of God as quick as you can the sealing time is on when the enemy come like a flood his reason a standard against said he prophesied that there will come a sealing time when the church will be sealed I mean uniting time on sign he said I believe the writers chord I believe she is sealed into the kingdom of God and when God put you in the kingdom no man could take you out your trial or testing nor generation nothing present nothing to come could bring you [Applause] my god you are blessed tonight to be one of the escaped ones or glory no God you escaped hallelujah you escaped the piece gasket force anointed the escape room let's get the Pope you escaped the systems well glory to God do I escape once are you gonna ask him the corruption that is in the world she lost or did the Lord a shout in the house glory hallelujah listen you had just come to the message you know you escaped you escaped you didn't know myself friend you know myself family you escape the boss who receive you escaped the Prime Minister's who receive your swap the bishop the Pope yes give all of them and you are yet because you'll see a name on that book or glow that's why I could rejoice and shout they'll have nothing to do with what condition it was in home bass didn't what's in your come true that have nothing to do with it all that barrier shall worship the Beast and if they're not worshiping the Beast have to be worshipping God you may be seated the Holy Spirit always speaks the world I've got meetings that tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he will guide you to it so after the prophet was taken off the scene God released the Spirit of Truth two spirits was unfold on the earth the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error but the Spirit of Truth was sent to guide us to the truth so listen this part now that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the Seventh Seal the mystery of God to be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up there by that time in other words you're supposed to be on top of brotherly kindness by that time you're supposed to have it based on forgiveness by that time by that time the Ottoman Lords no grudge no jealousy no malice no foolishness by that time it's just a faith to pull down the cap or blow it up God give the Lord a shout listen to this listen listen a the strong that Daniel saw no money cut that oak no manner cut that so now that's only coming the coming of the headstone ready or not it's coming or glory though God you better get ready bright Oh hallelujah I'm a sinner again the finishing of this seventh seal not the beginning this is 54 years since the Prophet left this is commonality and no we finish it we're supposed to be up here this pyramid is the Bible the zodiac is the Bible and we have a Bible a written either all three is the Bible York a preacher zodiac you can preach the word and when the world coming to you is a pyramid so that's why when the rapture come and the magnet come it only can magnetize and pull up those that have that in them because that have the magnet is not the Holy Ghost Jesus listen Jesus could see destroyed his body in three days I will raise it up because jesus knew the quickened power was resident in him all glory to God hallelujah praise God that light was already in him you're putting long and Haley still coming up you cast Davison I met my bed in hell he is there alcohol yeah this world Cavalia never Kolya trial conditions cannot holier you are higher than that the Bible the Bible call it listen the glorious liberty of the sons of God does not you think you're free you know that's not you think every you know that is free on the inside free free the glorious Liberty the whole creation say come on you can make it come on come on come on you can make it we waited on you we waited for our masters we waited for our rulers may be seated let's continue watch he set the seed of God the Word of God Jesus said in a certain place the wood is a seed and every cedar bring water after its came now if the Christian the children of God the churn of the kingdom has become the seed of God then there must be the Word of God the Word of God manifested in the East at the Lebanon you so we place it the children is the seed then there must be the word with manifested don't get tired not talking with no word manifested hallelujah so where is it occurring at a seed in the turn of the word quit manifested so what want a life from you going

of Christ every situation there's an intelligence behind everything if we could tap into the intelligence its mover or give the Lord a show praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God every situation in your life and i wronged you there's an intelligence behind it nothing is by chance hallelujah glory to God when Esther was in the king and she didn't know where she was acting and who she

you're not supposed to go unless you are called did you hear that you're not supposed to go until you a call but this woman she saw the need she saw D hour she saw what was going to happen and she didn't make a move and if you don't make a move but there's a rapture Gloria Borger is a wedding supper I don't want to miss it this being when it's completed is the servant of God in the church of god that's going in a rapture not this being when we talk about it that is not something on a backboard to stand up blackboard and say faith and virtual knowledge and succor be the ones that have to be a living [Applause] maybe season I want to see if God could bring it I'm inspired real to you those virtues have to come alive it has to be living and the only way if you're not alive is when it's tested and I know you might wanna say Amen because I said tested because people have a problem with using certain words but I will say that II how the only way I can know that alive is when is tested the only way I can know yet brotherly kindness is when somebody really do you in and you have no you have to forgive them [Applause] and there are situations where you are right and they are wrong and you forgiving them you've given up your rights to be right and letting it go even if you are right and let us kill you because you know you're right but you're taking wrong or give the Lord a show hallelujah praise God you're pressing for peace because you want to keep the atmosphere right never want to shake you on the atmosphere oh my Oh glory to God when the Prophet was behind the pulpit you may be seated and that maniac Malcolm competing uh preaches he thought it was another one of them what he come up with you see you snake in the grass he said yeah you know you're hypocrite I could beat you I know why I checked in the Prophet mat nice words you know it's not just what he speak in spirit if you only like that see the inside of you you frighten you run to 400 men how much many had a prophet role of the platform and they leave he alone 5 foot short man standing there and the Prophet just under the anointing he keeping the atmosphere yeah breaking at the devil in that man talking his talk he said because you have challenged the Spirit of God you will fall over my feet you will fall over my feet so you have a come come on the platform somebody said call the police you said no call the police be another flesh and blood I fail no blue blue lights and in December this thing hallelujah drop blue blue uniform coming to interfere with this thing visit they will come in celle here and this is caught on top I hear this is God versus the devil or glory naquadah the Devlin that man is caught in me devil upon that man is caught up on me oh he shall fall on my feet the man come on a platform spin around you said come on I'm fittin to and fall right over the prophets feet or glory that girl you can defeat the Spirit of God show me once wherever the spirit all defeated in Genesis darkness cover it and God said let there be light under Spirit of God began to move upon the water and in every confusion in every darkness and every chaos wants to Spirit began to move what we need is the spirit to begin to move you can explain that you can't talk that Hollow you can't teach that that is something to be manifested or give the Lord a shout the one teachers having itching ears they are he enough still want to hear more Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God amen oh if the trend is the Train of God's children the kingdom I become the seat of God there must be the Word of God the Word of God manifested in the eight that they're living in for the promises of that age that is why I watch watch we have lived two looters age Wesley age Pentecostal age and the Pentecostal age each age is given a promise of the world and the people of that age that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age I'm gonna do who the pastor's the people that manifest the promise of that age so God put brotherly kindness on top and on top of that have the Holy Spirit slot because the ki aapke come down on top of Oerlikons that they be called out so the call out is the escape one be called out as those who escape loud easier which is heady highminded lukewarm God spew them out amount them as church members that is not wise version those foolish virgins be called out as who see the oil who see the Holy Spirit's shot that is da after get into so that is what he said does if that be so then the seven thunders CAPTA Purnell then he was not anything that understood ranges and that way he was showing the thunders in the Holy Spirit slot the cap your pyramid the pyramid of your life or glory of God therefore the seven thunders true in two parts mechanics and dynamics hallelujah literally turn Hospital cheering back to the phaser far as these mysteries that's that's a mechanic part but the dynamic part what really should make a church that will make a revival that people would find them everywhere saying them seven thunders is being manifested the devil is see nothing yet all he's in his church and groups and pulpit and nice talk and nice messages a nice titles the devil I see nothing yet or give the Lord a shout when the way knee up Aroon they were shouting and dancing up a room that can move shape up but when Peter says vandal halenann such as I have I give it unto you never close up he took North Iraq never gonna take the north and no message he's not impressed [Music] but Connelly receive another press we have nice messages nice sermon and Lucy Lucy Neven dress not impressed when this become manifest oh yeah he said no no no no this can't work this just can't work but it going to work because God promised to release the sons of God when born sons fill sons speak and their word is backed up there would begin to materialize or glory does God using all these years the training was just to be talking talking yapping yapping yapping no they said the Lord Himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs following doing it a glory of God a to fill this tabernacle do you know that you added tabernacle do you know if you have to be filled with the glory of God do you know when Solomon had everything in place and shall remain in the pray the glory of God filled the tabernacle that the minister couldn't even stand to Minister do you know when what is finished with you word on top a word on top a we're on top our word and that glory coming up on you they will fill your tabernacle you shall be filled that is your promise or get a lot some praise and worship [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God what's this what's this year and the people of their age that manifests that promise word is the seed of that is going to Jesus right here they are the children of the kingdom not only message and Aviva prophet not that this is children of the kingdom the manifestation the detail in it now this is a fine line the manifestation of the Holy Spirit upon written through his children is the seed of the kingdom at that age so God never rests until the Holy Spirit began to operate in you in me until the coming to your position until the getti inheritance he gives some apostles he gives some pastors he gives some teachers he gives some evangelists he gives some prophets isn't that right and after that he gives tips of Palms interpretation of tongues prophecy give of healing give of wisdom give of knowledge different reputation every gift have to be underfloor every difference needed God only God only alamode what a nice true what happens to God a football or get the Lord and show your body is not just a MOBOT or get the Lord a show [Applause] what do you say matter of it I'm saying every member it's just as important as the preacher I know I know I know the preachers might not talk that I'm preacher but I will say to you every member is just as important as the man behind the pulpit because everybody will be baptized into the body there are outward pass a body and they're inside mafia buddy you like your hand you're like a head like it is take what you have to see well let somebody come and take off your two kidneys and see what happened to your body your nice body it'll pass you can see but they are necessary in a classic you'll see but they are needed and I'll pass working behind the scenes you can see but you'll need to have them because all of them is what make up this glorious body that you have they will give the Lord a shout there is one set there is one buddy there is one baptism not to hit one hit and he's never prophet to turn our hearts back to detail okay the Lord I show I know what his bunch of group sing but I know about the faith once delivered to the Saints how am I going back to that or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I read it for you sometime back about Ezekiel he talked Ezekiel to the valley of dry bones he's Academies won't live talk to me talk to me back he's eager to talk to me Ezekiel said oh yes he said prophesy the bones tell the bones they will live I will call Brett to come in to you it's all in the end game the end product the finish work that life will come back into that but before the bone stir to the breath there's something done for bone have to come the bone flesh after

predestinated us unto inheritance watch if I am if I'm a right inheritance of something if God is knocking at my heart and said see William Branham I called you a long time before the fortune world to preach a gospel I have an inheritance of eternal life God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me we ourselves had an inheritance we were sinners we had returns all of a sudden we find out we have a deed we have a book of a seal oh good and somebody say your name and a no let me see let me see when he said up or receives off you see if me and what my name connected by inheritance what what

something I take you from one space to another phase one step to another step you see we all want to get there right away but gone half steps sheltered steps right order my steps oh god go half steps and he make her go to these steps and tester of every step that you're qualified to go to the next step or glory the quarries are trying to pressurize you he's trying to qualify you to go to the next level you know like I don't blue between the video game the game business well to go to next level at the pacifism level if you do pass a level you're never in a memory code there are people on keep

last days they will get the devil some good unders doable shake up hell shake you know listen this place will be so shaken degree of the noble Sheikh open there will be a resurrection because the children under perfection by manifestation till the Lord a shell all this fivefold ministry for the perfect innocence men flesh man ordinary man human beings think that they doing that man kappa man sinful man too perfect man they don't understand is five for ministry as prophesied by the prophet of william branham and he's to be five for ministry is the Ministry of Jesus Christ it's not this man ministry and that you have a great ministry that technology those guys the message I saw me before all together you have to be given that you have to comment to that God after we put you put that upon you there is that a man trying a king and my church and I just better illustrate a foolishness like humans business that nothing mister Jesus Christ there was one cap there was one head there was one head you must recognize the headship of Jesus Christ Oh glory to God I am NOT a head of the church he is the head of the body called the church in that body of fivefold ministry in that body of believers but gifts with places in that body but on top that body Christ alone is the head the bigger the Lord a shout or do you see well I'm saying in all glory to God so the early part of our ministry he said I said I represent the faith by way of a divine gift it's a powerful statement I represent the faith by way of a divine gift D fate didn't come into him yet he had a gift of healing and that was so powerful they taken for Jesus Christ but he at was the growth of first full second pole purple into the Ministry of Jesus Christ where God Himself was filled in him that's why you can say come to the unveiling of the mighty God Oh glory to God and when God was veiling him God spoke himself out on books and tapes in the form of promises hallelujah and we catch the promises or the preacher sketch explanation interpretation or kind of crazy revelation but what we see is promises so when you come to church all you want to hear is what your promise you want to hear what your heritance is you want to hear what you call on truth you want hear what they're here for what you must anoint what you must clean what you must pull down you know he has a bacchanal and confusion and talking other people business you know here for that I am NOT here for that we have to speak as the Oracles of God Oh glory to God when we speak you have to speak for God to the escaped ones we'll give the Lord a shout that's the promise you know hallelujah yes prophetic utterance we'll go out to the escaped ones hallelujah you wouldn't want to miss a service because they don't know what God want to say you don't know what call wonders speak because Corps gonna sleep by direct inspiration it's not just the course we are caught in here is the Spirit of God coming and speaking to you because once more the world will get direct from God or glory God direct from God God speaking directly to you when you leave a your no God talk to you or glory they're gonna get that directly from the Lord oh my my my my my hallelujah so we said I call you a long time ago before the fog in the world and God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do but inherited there's nothing I can do but in the fullness of time God sent his own the time Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that I met Gautam inheritance to be walked whatever it is the sonship to be a son of God not just remember but that's for me a little bit right Moses people children in Israel God's people pillar of fire they come out on its own right so go get them prophets they have the word they have the law from Malachi to Matthew hundreds of years no prophet here comes John the Baptist repent by that time 100 years pass then fellows are tall hats long dongs nice little Indians nice Tabernacles and temples and so on nice traditions and so on people respect them on what not here come a man that's Zachariah his name is Johnny yeah come on man with camel skin blossom bring forth fruit me to repentance and blessing them the Pharisees knew something happening because that behavior is out of sync with what their custom with they say are you him are you the Messiah should we look for another see me I'm not me there's one standing among you the whole harlot are whose shoes I'm not worthy sunroofs you're gonna baptize you with the Holy Ghost somebody fire or glory to God you under know who it is yet she caught giving my sign upon whom you see the stuff coming on resting and remaining that's the Messiah Jesus he is watching what's happening he had to wait for his time he came out of all a mess I'm Jesus until hey buddy I'm Jesus he can't introduce himself John have to introduce him and we have to be made for the Messiah so jeez had a whiff of John to start to preach and John the timing has to be just right and then all of a sudden Holy Spirit tells Jesus move now he's standing in line to be baptizing anybody else I'm John baptized I'm baptized I'm Jesus he said I said you should map ties me he said that might be so but it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness I'm John baptized and he said behold the lamb of God then the elect among John disciples stopped following John and instead the follow Jesus because the neutron was introduced Jesus John Scylla disciples but this guy is following Jesus no because the new Nazi Messiah or glory that God but Jesus find a lot of priests so qualified fooling them is also called custodians of the wood in those days they have the books that they tipped up the scrolls your fallen same with the caretakers they work ethic in the Moodle schools after John got Papa Jesus got baptized Holy Spirit again not man Holy Spirit led him into the wilderness yeah but Lord is that you I've seen realism front is that you I thought I was going I wouldn't on a platform and people welcomed me I thought I get enough love people shake my hands but is that real yeah that's really you the Holy Spirit led him into the wilderness to overcome Lucifer one-on-one private trial to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life to overcome himself a lot of people that they don't have the internal power self discipline self order conquering of self denies by the mode fly loosely get empathic carry on because they don't have the internal stuff so when Jesus had that discipline look at this stone could turn into bread and say it is written it's written is also written he overcame know the spirit come back upon him so here is he baptized spirit on him when he hit the wilderness spread off of him now yeah the physicists alone no help of it it has written it as written he's doing that for you and me you don't need power to beat that devil you just need to know your word hallelujah it's written is written burns they did that for you he did that for me that you could tell sit and it is written it is written if you do it is written that's why you have to be in the word to know it is written or give the Lord a shout you have to know it is written you have to know it's in the word after study the word so when he come true and he come back over then he speak come back upon in the Bible call it the power of the Spirit so now you have a super anointing upon him he goes to the temple they save somebody wanted some want somebody to read just put up his hands I really first I me when I read hallelujah and then he had a finding school of Isaiah Isaiah ok can you like sir then he's calling don't know and fine Isaiah and going down to the part where he mark the Spirit of the Lord is upon me so they taught he read in scripture the scripture this is the manifestation right now they thought he has written a text they thought he cotton and he quoted he just caught him but his himself is coated the Spirit of the Lord upon me because they learn a meter how many finished finish me that is it this day the scripture is fulfilled in your air and he sat dog closed the book dominoes action no start hallelujah victorious vibrations from heaven Oh glory to God he is nominated define the scripture he is no Commission he is ready to go out and heal the sick and raise the dead and give them scribes and Pharisees and run for the money or give the Lord a shout what you think that brag gonna do anointed and Commission finest picture it is upon me Oh glory to God hallelujah you are gonna be in here you belong to them escape once you escape punch let me see the wrap up here I'm gonna keep you long hallelujah praise God this may choke you to death but they didn't have men that are sons of God how much of God's or this is beautiful men that are sons of God are mature gods he didn't say meander the god of preachers and teachers and explainers he's showing you that the inheritance is your sonship to be a son of God and the son of God rightly not Church son civil and pure son of God rightly is a mature God watch watch how many ever knowed how many know Jesus said so did not they lost it at your God's watch impotence is - because they had full don't mean the mean of the world he couldn't Dominion of all things he lost his quad ship he lost his sonship he lost his to mean Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time and then now he wanted equality side the fullness of time as when the pyramid gets to the top so he showed it can happen before time it has to come at the fullness of time when when the pyramid comes to the top watch watch watch watch when the previous to the top when the full sons of God who will be manifested so this have a Titan in it do I am and this have a time in it when the pyramid gets to the top when the when the full sons of God will be manifested let's picture a little bit full sons when the power of God will work out evil Alleluia and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him that's right that's why Jesus said usually about wars and rumors of wars and Kingdom rise against Kingdom and earthquakes in diverse places he said the end is not yet but then he's qualified with this gospel must be preached not taught this is not taught now this is after all the teachings this gospel must preached and then shall the end come nobody is coming to end us without us preaching the gospel did not end in us we have that we have to close this story or give the Lord a shout let me say it again we have to close this story no manacles in this story the bride the escaped ones we have to close this story then the end shall come my God my god I remember that angle we have to close the story then the end shall come this gospel shall be preached it's a breach of repressed common all
