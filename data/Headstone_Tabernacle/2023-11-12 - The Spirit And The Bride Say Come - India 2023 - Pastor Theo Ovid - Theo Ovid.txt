whatever you want to do Lord we come to cast our cares upon you this morning we come to lay our lives at your feet this morning Lord we stand in faith knowing that all things are possible to them that believe and Lord you said you can only prove your word through Believers so may you take complete control today and may you bless the service everything that would be said and done may you bless our pastor who is speaking this morning Father Lord in the US father May the Holy Ghost drop down upon him and speak lip to ear to your people may you get glory and honor to your holy name in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen just before you take your seats just one portion of scripture Malachi 3: six for I am the Lord and I change not I am the Lord and I change not may the Lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord it's certainly a great privilege to be be here and brother over asked me to just greet the church before we go into the message this morning uh he wanted us to hear that message uh from uh India and have you been blessed with the India meetings thus far amen what a time in the presence of the Lord so this morning we'll be going back to India for I believe it's a final service that he's playing for the church so we on the great expectation uh for that and I spoke with him yesterday he preached on Friday night and he'll go going to be speaking this morning again uh two different churches so we pray that the Lord would strengthen him and minister to him for such a time as this and just before we go to the tape just for a few minutes I am the Lord and I change not you know when you look at what's happening around the world the governments change policies change procedures change Medical Practice change the technology is changing but in the background of all of that God is saying I am the Lord and I change not God is not changing his standard of Holiness he's not changing his standard of righteousness he's not changing his standard of what it takes to be a Christian in such a time as this and you might change jobs you might change careers you might change a lot of things but God is saying I am the unchanging God and sin is still sin and Holiness is still Holiness and right rightousness is righteousness the bar could be lowered in some places and what may and and you know it growing up years ago there were things that were unacceptable and things that have become acceptable and in the midst of this God is saying I don't care what people accept I don't care what they push on the television I don't care what they normalize on the news and what they normalize in the media I am God and I change not man could change but God will not change and can the church say amen and and the reality is that's how the devil is the devil has tried to change his tactics to get to you and try to to to make it easy and to tell you it's all right you could do that and you could get away with it but God said I am God and I change not no flesh could glory in my presence the way you want to live can glory in my presence your interpretation of it can glory in my presence I want a holy walk I want a holy life I want a Sanctified walk I want a Sanctified life I want you to be 100% or no percent he said I rather you hot or I rather you cold I am God and I change not I didn't change for Moses I didn't change for Abraham I didn't change for Noah I didn't change for Elijah I didn't change for Peter I didn't change for John I didn't change for William brandham and I'm not changing for this bride I will reward those that stand I will fill those that are hungry and thirsty after righteousness the policy is still the same blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled I am the Lord and I change not I will judge sin and I will bless those that are [Applause] thirsty so I don't care what they do in your job I don't care what they changing your school and okay what they say it's okay to do with now not with God even if people in the church drop their standard God is not dropping his standard I am the Lord and I change not and the Bible I read says God is no respector of persons he doesn't respect me he doesn't respect you he respects his word he honors his word uh he stands with his word uh he protects his word and the spirit is obligated to follow his word so we want to be a word CH Church a word bride a word people can the Church Say Amen I'm almost done 6 more minutes in the message convinced and then concerned brother Bram said God gave the promises and when God gave the promise to Abraham he said he would possess the Gate of his enemies and so Shamar believe that in other words Shamar could have rested on the Word of Promise that was given to Abraham because he understood that God was not a changing God and this morning we could rest on every promise that was placed in every scripture that was given to every Prophet that was given to every judge that was given to every man of God we could stand this morning because he is God and he changed [Applause] not brother Bram said God only needs one man just let him get one man in his hand the world will think he's crazy but he will drive home the gospel listen to when when he's thoroughly convinced that Jesus Christ Remains the Same yesterday to today and forever under anything else he will stand true and go on because he is Thoroughly convinced that God is God and I have one more quote in the message future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride he said if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the same conditions is met because he's the same God in other words God is a scientist he's a great astronaut he is looking for a certain formula when you make certain chemicals it doesn't matter The Chemicals React a certain way he said once a conditions and meant the reactions got to take place once the word and spirit comes together something has to take place when God people gather together on one Min or one Accord something have to take place when you confess your fault one to another something has to take place when you drop your arts and your grudges something has to take place when you forgive your brother your sister your wife your children something has got to take take place when you pray in the morning something has got to take place when you lift your hands in worship something has got to take place oh come on somebody help me this morning when you come to church on fire something has got to take place when you come under great expectation something has got to take place when you ask for the Holy Ghost and there's faith in your soul something has got to take place because I am the Lord and I change not may the Lord richly bless you let's stand to our feet and let's go to India may the Lord richly bless you this morning stay on fire stay in the spirit God richly bless [Music] [Music] youu

praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah I have a title the spirit and the bride say come that's that's Jesus having a bride the spirit and the bride would speak it means that the bride will become the word and the spirit would come upon the bride and give the bride a voice the voice of God would be in the bride the world will hear direct from God through the bride the world heard direct from God to a 20th century Prophet brother William Bram but now the world will hear direct from God to a bride this bride will be Mrs Jesus Christ this bride is the wife of the Lamb the Bible said let us rejoice and be glad for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife not the brid his wife not the wife cousins his wife have made herself ready something going to happen some word going to be spoken to get

today because the animals don't have a soul they have a spirit but not a soul the soul give you the Consciousness right and wrong even without a Bible you don't even need a Bible to convict you your own conscience your own heart tells you this is right this is wrong don't do this do this your own conscience brother give a story of a woman you go to church and then she divorced her husband she went with this one and that one she playing piano in church she don't want to listen to her husband she don't want to fall in line she want to look like the world and act like the world one day some sickness took her like cancer and she was dying and a preacher came to her bed and asked her are you ready to meet the Lord I am fine I am fine I didn't ask you to come to see me I don't want to hear you now watch this all where you have doctor lawyer all the pride of being driving some fancy car GC CX all where you have all those subjects and you are proud of your family all of that is in the human Spirit now when you die your spirit begins to break up so the blood begins to leave and your human Spirit begins to break up when you think you're special and you have some money in the bank and you have children who is Doctor and lawyer and you're feeling proud all of that is in the humanistic Realm of the human spirit and that human spirit is what breaks up so when the woman thought she was saved as she was dying and her spirit begin to break up a pastor came to look for her and then all of a sudden start to say I am lost I am lost because when your spirit breaks up your soul comes up is the condition of your soul is what will go in the presence of God your condition of your soul so you can't take any chances you're right with God because one of these days you're going to meet him ready or not there's going to be a resurrection a first resurrection and a second resurrection and in the second Resurrection murderers haters Killers all of them going to raise from the sea from the earth they get crated they have to come and give an account that is why you should thank God opportunity to hear words of eternal life listen there's a time to be born and there's a time to die everything is within time you go to school if you don't study work exam time is coming and the exam time to identify where you have learned your work all of us have time the same time same 24 hours you could use it or you could abuse it you could use it wisely could use it foolishly use it on social media or you can use it to feed your soul hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory time time and time is running out when that Mighty Angel the one with the sweat back Wings the one with the seven seal the one with the cloud in Revelation 10 he swore time shall be no longer in other words time have a beginning time have an end everything beginning have an end I didn't drop down big I was once young but now I'm getting old why because of time you can't change time you can't stop time you can't tell time wait is not waiting time is running out you better move with the cloud you better move with the spirit don't have so much time Jesus said If any man tast let him come unto me and drink your father could be a multimillionaire he can't stop time nobody can stop time but time is a little break into eternity time is a little a break into eternity the time that changes now you may be seated

mine and doth them I would liken him unto a wise man that his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the flux came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that hear these says of mine and do it them not shall be liken to a foolish man that built his house upon a sand and the rain descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when Jesus had ended his saying the people were astonished at his Doctrine for he taught them as one having Authority as the Scribe let's go here a little bit the person that built a house upon the sand beautiful house it may be better than the house that the man built upon the rock but the rains have come yet the floods hasn't arrived as yet you could painted blue pink yellow green you could have first floor second floor third floor everybody in the village admir the house they taking pictures of the house but that house was built upon a sand what is Jesus saying he is saying judgment is coming a storm is coming a flood is coming a rain is coming ready or not it's still coming and when it comes according to what you have as a foundation stand or your house will fall glory to God and this come to every family every home every marriage happened that you didn't expect it doesn't you know the Bible talk about Jesus in a boat and the Bible said the winds were contrary it's not because somebody sin in the boat is not somebody living a contrary life cancer might take you kidney problem sickness you didn't ask for that you might find yourself in a wheelchair you get in an accident winds blowing contrary there are things you can't [Music] explain but you have confidence God will make it work for your good what I'm telling you in there a storm is coming where have you you build it when Peter told Jesus toward the Christ Jesus said Upon This Rock not sand Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it now the word prevail is to wrestle and overcome it means the Gates of Hell will challenge it will attack it but it cannot defeat it this Army that God has raising up will not be defeated this pride in India going to stand on the word he says nothing going to stop this Pride not even [Music] [Applause] death even death there going to be a Rapture shall be changed we shall be changed there is going to be a Rapture praise the name of the Lord you will be seated glory to God when Jesus received the Holy Ghost without measure he was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness Into the Wilderness to to be tempted of the devil and Jesus had to overcome the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life that was a personal battle between Jesus and the devil no Pastor involved no church involved involved Prophet involved this is Jesus and Lucifer Lucifer and Lucifer Lucifer didn't know who he was so he told Jesus if th be the Son of God turn these stones into bread now the Bible said he hungered he was hungry and Jesus had the power to turn the stone into bread but Jesus Ro back on the word he said man live by by every word proceed out of the mouth of God Jesus overcame the Devil by the way because he knew you were coming and you have to overcome the Devil by the word he never us his power nothing to Satan so then the devil took him to a high temp temple and begin to tell him the scriptures he said if you jump down from there Bible said the Angel going to hold you up he's trying to tempt Jesus to make a show he try to Temp Jesus Jesus kep behind me Satan he rebuked him the final picture from the devil he showed Jesus curv screen he said all these kingdoms are mine United States America Europe Europe India India Trinidad Trinidad South America South America Africa Africa all of these is mine I will give them to you if you bow down glory of God and Jesus said get behind me Satan Hallelujah thou sh serve the Lord thy God Satan was shocked he still didn't know who Jesus was overcome the Devil by the word what did Jesus do afterwards he went into the temple and he found the book of Isaiah Isaiah 61 all the years he was sitting in church saying nothing hearing all the interpretation but this day call for somebody to read the scriptures and here come brother Jesus brother Jesus pick up the cles and begin to find the prophet Isaiah he found the prophet Isaiah remember in those days it wasn't a book like this it was actual Scrolls so you have to find the Scrolls and open the scroll find Isaiah 61 he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord anointed me good Tiding the meek had sent me to bind up the broken heart claim Liberty the captives and the opening of the prison them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable ear of the Lord and he stopped but then Isaiah there's a come there to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God you may be seated so Jesus deliberately stopped in the middle of a sentence because he knew this day of vengeance is for our time and the scripture we read Isaiah said the day of vengeance is in my heart and the year of my [Music] redeemed is come in the midst of judgment God bringing forth Redemption isn't that something else oh glory to God and you know when you start to talk about judgment people get nervous and frightened because in the early church it had anas and saf they sold their goods and so on and brother anas came and Peter stood there and said is this all he said yeah say but but that's not true you light of the Holy Ghost they didn't understand that the snake that was in Peter's heart got firebombed God blow out the snake out of Peter heart put a throne there and God was sitting on it outside was the same brother Peter but inside was God himself Oh Glory to God the same Peter was that Deni Jesus the Same Peter that did what he did he was carrying God now the wife came and the wife they ask her but you know now this is where is this really [Music] something we have to be honest we have to be truthful that wife she knew her husband was a rascal she didn't have to support his lies but she do the same thing and she fell dead they packed her out the Bible said no man joined them God added to the church as would be saved now listen to this carefully it's not that God want to judge them in that way you know God was trying to protect the Bride of that day do you understand that they were bringing poison into the [Music] church and God love the church so much yet us to get out get it out and prophesy in this last day it would repeat Oh Glory to God hallelujah glory to God let's go so actually this wasn't the original message I wanted to preach but in the hotel room I felt let in my heart felt Holy Spirit told me to bring this to you today so I I'll say it this way this is frh FR off the [Music] press Hallelujah this is fresh off the press listen to this prophet he said brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year all theologians fail to do in 2000 years prophecy now you wait you up till the anointing of the church strikes home listen after the doors of the Gentiles is closed God will anoint a church then he who is filthy is filthy still he is righteous is righteous still he is Holy is Holy still and God will anoint the church the power of God and things will be taken place so in other words The Prophecy from the [Music] scripture one of these days when the door shut it's like a camera taking a snapshot whatever condition you are caught by that camera that's it C your filthy if it catch you righteous righteous still if it catches you holy holy be careful because these days it's going to be set and then you can't change can't change the picture it from the Bible Oh Glory to God see not the SS of the prophecy the time is at hand the time of judgment is at hand to God thank you Jesus and perfect my perfect weakness he said get weak so you can get strong it will conquer every devil it will put the Lear to shame it will bring men and women who God has called and that only get empty friends deny your own ability wherever these tapes [Music] go empty yourselves out pour yourselves out on God's altar God don't want toar how much money you have or who you are and what your name is and what your family is God don't want to hear that want you say you are nothing when Isaiah was leaning on kah God take away kah you leaning on remove it to lean on him let me say that again you have to be leaning on him Isaiah was LE King Uzziah God took him off the seah ran into the temple and he saw the Lord high and lifted up and he saw the seraphim Angels flying saying holy holy Lord God Almighty and the presence was so powerful that Isaiah said who is me for I am undone I'm a man of unclean lips and he was a prophet and he confessed his lips was unclean words in other words I am nothing Lord I am nobody I need you I need your presence I need your power soam said pour yourselves out upon God's altar let the angel come with a coil of fire and then he prayed his prayer listen to every word this the last service tonight he said come Lord Jesus catch away your church and if it Be Your Will Lord just before that church is raptured May their arise power build these vessels shake this world once more listen listen we know it's a be time there'll be no more repentance they'll be too far for [Music] them but show your power Lord and shake this world like it never never been shook take your church then leave the world in a chaos how she set so God they [Music] struggle now remember this when Noah preached for 120 years the message was to come to the ACT Noah believe God and while he was preaching he was building the so Noah's word expressed his fath people can laugh at him but Noah you have no water to float that you building a boat and there's no sea for that but God told no to build it Noah finished God tell him bringing the animals two by two and you know what is interesting this story about no and the Ark it is in every religion every in South America all over they have the same story when Noah finished with the animals God told Noah bring your family in when he's brought his family in the Bible say and God shut the door and whatever door shut is shut and whatever God door open is open when God shut the door somebody coming with a revelation Noah I see it I want to come in now Noah didn't close the door couldn't open the door stopped preaching and the AR was preaching now people have to see it they can't go in it did you hear that church they were seeing the shut the door is sealed on the inside he is safe his family is safe and judgment was about to strike when the door was shut the first day no rain the second day no rain even his children want to know Daddy are you sure the fourth day no rain the sixth day no rain seven day the CLS to get everybody get worried never saw this dark before then the rain began to fall 40 days 40 nights 40 days 40 night let me get this to you now the same rain that was judging the people raising Noah's and the same Holy Ghost the same damic we are looking for the entire world of our god oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah you be seated so that doesn't change your [Music] character just only change your location if you here you'll be a daughter over there so you're not going to be over there because over there so Believers not doubters so now is the time to get a character change and that's why Peter said given all diligence virtue knowledge temper all these things here it's it's a life it's a change but call it blood transfusion take your blood out and put the blood of Jesus in and it brings the faith of Jesus not your [Music] faith not your faith the faith of Jesus the virtue of Jesus the temperance the patience of Jesus praise the name of the Lord but Bram when atomic bombs and people are scared and signs of flying sorces yeah he's prophesying let the people let that little FL that little Remnant God will give that Elijah let that little remn go to calling out on God Watch What Happens there will be a national Showdown prophecy now there will be a power that they have never seen before the trouble of it is this time is going to be too late for them the doors will be closed do you see where we are going identifying to you what is about to happen the Bible call it the times of the Gentiles the Bible call until the fullness of the Gentiles come in when the Jews told Jesus on the cross may your blood be upon us and our children God scatter them the Judgment of God scattered the Jews all over the world but in the 60s they started get a desire to go back home and God used Hitler Hitler he killed 6 million Jews and the prophet said it was the gentle hand of Jehovah guiding them back to the promised land and Stalin evil men were used drive them back to the promised land that they could be a nation because Jesus like Joseph have to appear to his Brethren but before God goes to the Jews has to close off the Gentile age now the Jews was cut off that we could be grafted in so we have to be grateful to God the Bible said he came onto his own his own receive him not and many has receed him to them he give power to become the sons so when the Jews rejected Jesus the gospel turned to the Gentiles and now out of the Gentiles Jesus gets a bride that's you here this morning can you get it now so Noah was a sign of Deliverance to his people and a sign of judgment to the Lost World the unbeliever listen to this the very Waters that choke the world and drunk the world was the only means of saving Noah the only thing that could save him was the judgment and the only thing that could save the church today is the Judgment the Judgment yes huh Hallelujah [Applause] so Noah's message was the mechanics the rain that fall was the Dynamics and the AR floated isn't that right praise God let me get home here now on the token he said the blood was a token or identification the blood identif the worship had slain the lamb and he was not ashamed he wanted everybody to see it so the blood on the door post was evidence that the lamb had died God told them not if you're a Jew I'm going to pass over you not if you m say I'm going to pass over you he said when I see the blood not when the pastor see anything have nothing to do with the pastor no when I see the blood Moses told them take the blood and put it on the door post anybody passing they can see blood Oh Glory to God some people think they don't want they want to be a Christian [Music] secretly you can't be a secret Christian a Christian is a public [Music] life he said the blood the token must be applied or the Covenant is not an effect no you have to apply the token before [Music] judgment you have to apply the token before the wrath of God pass through the land before it happens I'm still reading for there is coming a time when you will not be able to apply the blood so when you have time to apply the blood you apply it you apply it to your home you apply it to your family and the Ten Commandments when the death angel was moving from a distance you hear people screaming and the noise getting closer and closer and closer and the little children asking their parents are you sure that angel not going to strike us and the father would say yes son yes daughter look out there you see that blood there Moses told us to take the blood apply the blood and the blood has been applied the toen God's Pride safe at last glory to God listen friends judgment is next brother this is the time that the tokens to be applied and what does he say to the Token get the out of your [Music] life get the old magazine get all the movies get anything that Hindi when you get it out apply the blood to your children to your home to your family to your [Music] wife don't take nothing for granted pray for your children pray for your grandchildren pray for your husband when he goes out to work have Devils on the job pray for him you don't know what he's going through on the job as his wife you pray for him the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord listen to what said we see the Wrath is about to pass through the land and everything from under that token will perish they offer lamb but the lamb have no soul so the lamb Spirit couldn't come back on them because animal has no soul but Jesus his soul is the spirit so when you identify with Christ [Music] Spirit comes back upon you and you are not an ordinary Indian you're not an ordinary Indian from India you are IND from [Applause] Heaven because the spirit that comes upon you comes from above that and come from that come from heaven give the Lord some Praises Spirit come from above and make you a new creature blessed be the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord in that time the blood was the chemistry it was the literal blood of an animal but he what he says here now that there's a difference between the blood and the life the token to for the believer today is the Holy Ghost God is not send sending you to kill no lamb now the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost not the blood but the spirit of God God must see this token we must see it in every one of us every one of us every one of us every one of us every one of us we got to see this token praise God praise God listen to this therefore the Wrath is ready to be poured out of high upon ungodly [Music] Nations ungodly unbelievers and here this one upon the professors without a possession remember the other night we were preaching and I was telling from a profession to a [Music] possession we can't just talk this we have to possess this God told Joshua you're landar from here to there to there you have the whole map he have the but God told him every place you put your foot that is yours you got to put your foot on your land put your foot Give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory so you can't just be a profession want you with a possession look at look at Peter everybody passing by the temple giving the man some coins the man put his hand in his pocket and he had no money a poor Apostle have you ever seen that Apostle with no money P want to give him something and when he put his hand not even one rupee in his pocket then Peter said silver and gold I don't have what I have give it unto you oh give the Lord some pra Peter had a possession profession a possession want to give you possession something on the inside glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah hallel Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory receive the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost [Music] [Applause] receive hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh Glory thank you Jesus glory god is requiring a token that you yourself have received this token the Holy Ghost it is the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass because it is the literal life of Jesus Christ return back upon the believer it will be Jesus in you Jesus put it on your dress Jesus put it on your sh Jesus putting on your it will be Christ in you of Glory Blessed Be name of the Lord Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah yes Lord yes hallelu hallelujah praise God listen to this

false shepherds in the last [Music] days compromise and not feed the people the word of God I understand in the last days people come up famine the church will be so [Music] organized in the last days there will come a not for bread and water but for hearing of the true word of God have to books thees not hearing the true word of God but in are hearing the true word of God this is the message is the message of get the token listen to this part now I understand he will send Elijah before the day of the end time he'll have a message that will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers I understand that will take place listen just before the spirit leaves the Gentile Church return to the Jews what are you saying just now the oil will run out the spirit is prophesied to leave the Gentile Church to the Jews when the spirit leaves a gentile Church how you getting the oil [Applause] do you get it how are you going to get the oil when the oil going to lead the Gentiles go over to the Jews and when that happens not one more person could be saved no more blood for the Gentiles today we have blood here so we can say the spirit and the say Come Oh Glory God because there is blood here today oh glory to God amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God I'm going to skip I'm going to close off here now but listen this Hallelujah my I wish I could spend some more time with

listen to this watch this Gentile age until the Stone come out of the [Music] mountain that wasn't cut up with hands they never put a Capstone on the pyramid it wasn't cut by man's hands God's hands that cut the stone what happened at that time the coming of the stone up went the church into Glory at the Rapture listen listen listen because it ended the Gentile dispensation God ended it up with the coming of that stone let's put it together now here it is we are waiting for Dynamics we are waiting for the power W adoption which is the Capstone coming to cap the Pyramid of Our Lives when that comes God shut down the Gentile it's finished the same rain that float Noah judge the world don't hear this bum as I close the stone that was cut out of of the mountain is ready to come at any time and when it comes what does it do it does away with the Gentile age it is all over God completely quits dealing with them let him that is filthy be filthy still let him that is Holy be holy still you see what he does then he takes his church the Holy Ghost filled now hear this part the I'm speaking he said what's the fil that's the sleeping virgin and them that come up for judgment so at the
