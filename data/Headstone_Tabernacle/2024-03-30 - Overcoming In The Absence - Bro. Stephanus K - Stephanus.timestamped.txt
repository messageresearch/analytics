[25:27] again
[25:29] God can do it again and again and again
[25:35] there's no reason to doubt God can do it
[25:40] again yesterday and the day before he is
[25:46] always the same there's no reason to
[25:50] doubt God can do it again oh God can do
[25:56] it again you believe that and again
[25:59] and again there's no reason to doubt God
[26:03] can do it again yesterday and the day
[26:08] before he is always the same there's no
[26:13] reason
[26:18] to God
[26:20] [Music]

[26:34] [Music]
[26:41] can do it

[26:48] Hallelujah we believe that this
[26:51] afteron God can do it again and again
[26:55] and again Hallelujah why should be done
[26:58] he's the same yesterday today and
[27:00] forever Hallelujah we may just have our
[27:02] seats just a moment we greet you all
[27:04] this afternoon in the wonderful name of
[27:06] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it's a
[27:09] privilege to be with you all uh in this
[27:13] impromptu way but we believe that God
[27:16] has uh you know all planned out before
[27:18] the foundation of the world you know he
[27:21] is on schedule he's always on time and
[27:25] uh you know we are the ones that ear
[27:27] this Journey on the walk and we seeing
[27:30] things coming to pass but it is already
[27:32] part of his plan and you know the sons
[27:34] of God are led by the spirit of God so
[27:38] you know uh a few days ago brother Isaac
[27:41] called me and he told me that brother
[27:43] stephanus would be coming and he just
[27:46] would like to let me know he would like
[27:49] to see me so I this was the only
[27:52] opportunity that we have and I just
[27:55] thought it fitting to put off all that I
[27:57] had to do and just make it up here this
[27:59] afternoon
[28:01] to see
[28:04] him
[28:06] amen it's good to know Brethren of like
[28:09] Precious faith and I believe that we
[28:12] were there before the foundation of the
[28:14] world attributes in his mind and here
[28:17] manifested on the earth and it's one God
[28:19] we serve we all have one father one Lord
[28:22] and we believe we all going to one place
[28:25] and we all going to be changed at one
[28:28] one
[28:29] time so I know brother when the power of
[28:32] this church Rises brother you're going
[28:34] to call the others brother but if
[28:36] Germany get it before us we all had to
[28:38] be changed in that
[28:40] moment
[28:42] Hallelujah so we will be changed at the
[28:45] same time by God's grace and just for a
[28:47] little scripture reading you know if we
[28:49] turn into our Bibles 1 Corinthians
[28:51] chapter 13
[28:53] um we could just stand just a moment
[28:56] well I'll just read one verse for you
[28:58] you charity verse 8 never fail it but
[29:01] whether there be prophecies they shall
[29:03] fail whether be the tongues they shall
[29:04] cease whether there be knowledge it
[29:07] shall vanish away we know in part and
[29:10] prophesy in part but when that which is
[29:13] perfect is come then that which is in
[29:16] part shall be done
[29:19] away
[29:21] Hallelujah glory be to God in the
[29:24] highest we may have our seats this
[29:25] afternoon as the Lord had his blessings
[29:27] and you know Paul here speaking to the
[29:31] Corinthian Church you know that is so uh
[29:34] lovely to see that in the midst of all
[29:37] the correction he could address love
[29:39] because we know Corinthian was a church
[29:41] of correction he had to correct you know
[29:43] things uh monetary things among them he
[29:46] had to correct things uh immoral living
[29:48] among them he you know and some of they
[29:51] were a bit puffed up who baptized who
[29:53] and he had to correct a certain
[29:55] popularity Spirit among them uh so Paul
[29:58] corrected a lot of things among the
[29:59] Corinthians and at the end you know he
[30:01] came here and he's showing us the bond
[30:04] the above all that we need and all the
[30:08] tongues and some things not correctly
[30:10] placed in the church but above all at
[30:13] the top hallu is
[30:17] Charity all these other gifts May cease
[30:20] but where there is Charity that never
[30:23] fails and Paul is connecting now that
[30:26] charity with perfect man yes sir not a
[30:29] child but an adult
[30:33] Hallelujah not just an adult but a man
[30:36] and this word that they use for a man is
[30:38] a speaking man Hallelujah so it's not
[30:40] just a man without knowledge because as
[30:44] as although we are Sons we differ
[30:46] nothing from a servant don't we be Lord
[30:48] of all things all right but we must come
[30:50] up to a certain level before the father
[30:53] could place a certain
[30:54] Authority in our hands so Paul Paul here
[30:58] is speaking to them he said we know in
[31:02] part and we prophesy in part and many
[31:04] times things would come forward but all
[31:06] these things are just partial in
[31:09] comparison with the reality that is to
[31:12] come so the Old Testament is a shadow of
[31:14] the new and when you look in the Old
[31:16] Testament there are a lot of partiality
[31:19] in the Old Testament a lot of types A
[31:21] lot of Shadows but as you start to move
[31:24] forward and the shadow becomes more to
[31:27] the reality ity it shows that the image
[31:29] is coming closer to the light
[31:32] Hallelujah as the image come closer to
[31:34] the light the shadow disappears and we
[31:37] come into the presence of the reality so
[31:40] Paul is showing us here uh we see darkly
[31:43] now through a glass but we moving from
[31:47] Darkly through a glass to where we come
[31:49] now face to
[31:50] face Hallelujah face to face brother
[31:54] that is bright age that is for our age
[31:57] Hallelujah
[31:58] we saw the face here hallelujah Moses on
[32:02] a man that God would speak lip to air
[32:04] face to face so we come now where God
[32:07] has chosen a prophet in this hour and we
[32:10] had face Toof face connection brother
[32:12] this scripture relates to our age
[32:14] because our age is the age for perfect
[32:18] realization all that was typed in the
[32:21] Old Testament so in the Old Testament
[32:23] you saw Moses with the bread of life but
[32:25] the bread of life if you try to not the
[32:28] bread of life but the Mana which the Old
[32:31] Testament the Saints eat if they try to
[32:32] keep it for the next day what happened
[32:34] it spoil so that man could only last a
[32:37] certain time but just that was a type of
[32:40] who he would
[32:42] be amen amen but when the true Bread of
[32:45] Heaven came
[32:46] Hallelujah glory be to God in the
[32:49] highest brother a man eat from that
[32:51] bread he never hunger
[32:55] again
[32:56] Hallelujah
[32:58] isn't that right that bread except you
[33:02] eat this bread except you eat my flesh
[33:04] except you drink my blood you have no
[33:06] life in you that was the perfect bread
[33:08] standing there it was no longer partial
[33:11] that bread could never run and watch
[33:13] Hallelujah that bread is the bread that
[33:15] they put behind the veil where the
[33:17] glories never
[33:19] fail and the priest alone had the
[33:21] ability to go in there and pull out some
[33:23] mana and eat so partial became perfect
[33:27] in the man in Christ
[33:29] Jesus but the reality that Christ came
[33:32] back in our day Hallelujah through a
[33:35] Vindicated prophet and we had true
[33:38] interpretation of the word by Divine
[33:44] Vindication Hallelujah because God is
[33:47] his own interpreter of his
[33:49] word we had true
[33:51] bread amen man shall not live by bread
[33:54] alone but by every word that proceeded
[33:57] out the mou so partial mana mana was
[34:01] typing quite back there the opening of
[34:03] the full word seven seals for us over in
[34:05] this day where a people could Feast on
[34:08] this and that Mana will never
[34:10] die Hallelujah they had partial water in
[34:14] the Old Testament they drank from that
[34:17] water but they T again but when the real
[34:21] water came Hallelujah the real water to
[34:24] met a woman by the well Hallelujah and
[34:28] he say you drink from this water you
[34:29] never thirst again Hallelujah that is
[34:33] perfect water he start on the last year
[34:36] the feast If any man tunger any man
[34:38] thirst let him come unto me out of his
[34:41] bellies from his innermost beings shall
[34:44] flow rivers of Living Water Hallelujah
[34:48] the paral became perfect in the man
[34:50] Christ Jesus
[34:53] Hallelujah so this is the age now where
[34:57] all those types have become a reality we
[35:01] going to see face to face now this is
[35:03] the junction that we are and moving from
[35:06] anti type to type it moving from Brother
[35:09] h a shadow that we had in there to a
[35:11] reality in this day and it moving now
[35:15] from where you know the concept that man
[35:17] had of Jesus being you know like uh the
[35:23] son all that the father had Hallelujah
[35:27] he poured into Christ but Christ as a
[35:31] son he referred to Jesus as the
[35:34] father but that son brother became the
[35:38] father he actually was the father but as
[35:41] a son he didn't know certain
[35:43] things as a son the day and the hour he
[35:46] said only the Father Knows as a son he
[35:49] was limited as a son he could have died
[35:51] Hallelujah but that son moved from a
[35:54] son to where he ascended on high to the
[35:57] right hand
[35:58] and he said all power in Heaven and
[36:00] Earth is given unto me Hallelujah you
[36:03] know what the prophet said he said if
[36:05] there was another God in heaven he would
[36:06] have been
[36:08] powerless
[36:10] Hallelujah he got all power it move from
[36:14] my father's house to my house so Saints
[36:17] we moving from partial into perfect and
[36:21] perfect is face to face it's bringing us
[36:24] now to that moment in the twinkling of
[36:26] an eye perfect is on top of the the
[36:29] Capstone perfect is on top not down at
[36:32] the bottom now Perfection is for our age
[36:35] Paul planted this is where we come back
[36:36] to spoken word is the Original Seed and
[36:39] we saw a man in our age back as Adam was
[36:43] Hallelujah that is perfection we saw a
[36:46] man brother that could speak and animals
[36:48] will obey we saw a man that no sickness
[36:51] could have stand in front of
[36:53] him amen we saw a man with power brother
[36:56] over the elements
[36:58] brother we saw a man brother that Jesus
[37:01] said Greater Works than these shall you
[37:04] do but we didn't see Jesus create but we
[37:07] saw Jesus in a Kentuckian flesh brother
[37:10] speaking and creating
[37:16] Hallelujah when that which is perfect is
[37:20] come sir it's perfect realization as we
[37:24] near the Capstone she will be a super
[37:27] Church is is his coming bringing us is
[37:30] he magnet magnetizing us we remember the
[37:33] magnet that pass over the the the
[37:36] machinery shop to take up all the
[37:38] shavings is the magnet pull the shavings
[37:41] up when that which is perfect he is the
[37:45] perfect one and it's perfect word coming
[37:48] to a bride
[37:50] hallelujah what SS the perfect word when
[37:54] I was a child I speak as a child but
[37:56] notice at child have the same DNA the
[38:00] father at that age he said father
[38:04] Hallelujah but in moving from Spirit of
[38:07] adoption to adoption itself when that
[38:10] same son will become a speaking son
[38:12] watch the quickening Power don't make
[38:13] you a
[38:14] son the Dynamics in coming to now make
[38:17] you a son because you are Sons we could
[38:20] be reborn Hallelujah and that power
[38:23] coming upon you to change us from
[38:28] children we pass a little adolescence
[38:31] age Hallelujah we pass adul and we
[38:34] coming now to where we can speak on
[38:36] behalf of the
[38:38] Father the Perfection is drawing us Sons
[38:42] into that reality that is where we are
[38:45] by God's grace every day this word comes
[38:47] it draws us up into the fullness of the
[38:50] reality of who he is you know what the
[38:51] prophet say hallelujah when you
[38:53] recognize this word to be Eagle food you
[38:56] have heard from your te then hallelujah
[38:59] we come to a stage where Christ
[39:01] impersonated in his word made flesh
[39:03] amongst us the lamb is on seen breaking
[39:05] the word that is the Perfection that
[39:08] drawing us up all over all the
[39:11] denominations over all the things of
[39:13] this world into the reality of the

[54:16] sometimes the the the struggles get too
[54:18] big praise the Lord and I've gone

[54:31] because time has a beginning and time
[54:33] has an end praise the Lord an absent has
[54:36] a beginning and an absent has an end
[54:39] praise the Lord because God is eternal

[55:14] ones some older ones praise the Lord and
[55:17] many times we speak about Moses and
[55:19] Moses was 80 at a burning bush
[55:21] Hallelujah and we speak about Joshua
[55:24] this old Fighters praise the Lord of the
[55:26] facei but there were also some young
[55:28] ones some Gideons praise the Lord some
[55:31] Davids Hallelujah some young people that
[55:33] took up the struggle they took up the
[55:36] fight they took up the water hallelujah
[55:39] praise the Lord amen praise the Lord now
[55:42] what is very amazing I was searching I
[55:44] was searching in the internet praise the
[55:47] Lord about a question and sometimes we
[55:49] have questions in our life and I was
[55:51] questioning how old was the
[55:53] disciples praise the Lord and it's a
[55:55] good question and there's not really a
[55:57] Bible scripture to it but many scholars
[56:00] and many people that are studying the
[56:02] scripture they went into it and they
[56:04] wanted to find out about what age were
[56:07] the
[56:08] disciples and I want to leave that with
[56:10] you because this is quite something for
[56:12] the young people I never went in there
[56:14] today it's the first time but the
[56:16] scholars you go into it and they take
[56:18] different hints to say how old have the
[56:21] young people been how old have the have
[56:23] the disciples been and we will find out
[56:25] that if was some young people in that
[56:28] generation is that right praise the Lord
[56:32] now to to understand that what the
[56:34] scholars did and I think we can follow
[56:36] the pattern he said they go in a Jewish
[56:38] custom in a in a in a in a in a custo in
[56:41] a customary of the Jews about a child
[56:45] and it says a child is trained about
[56:47] that age of five years and a child gets
[56:50] a training about the Torah about about
[56:53] the Old Testament and it starts to get
[56:55] trained from 5 years on so after 5 years
[56:59] the teaching starts about the Torah so
[57:02] then they have a time and a season of
[57:05] teaching and he said after about some
[57:08] say about 12 which we know is the age of
[57:11] accountability some say 13 and some say
[57:14] up to 15 years praise the Lord they have
[57:17] been taught by a teacher am but he said
[57:20] after 15 years they're going out and if
[57:23] they're interested and if they have the
[57:26] ability but they must be interested they
[57:29] must be interested in the Torah they
[57:31] must be interested in the law of God
[57:33] they must be interested in the
[57:35] Commandment of God he says then they're
[57:37] going out to find a tutor they're going
[57:40] out to find a rabie and that starts at
[57:43] the age of 13 or 15 praise the lord
[57:46] they're looking for a rabbie they're
[57:48] looking for a rabbie where they can
[57:50] follow and the scholar say where they
[57:52] can follow and pattern his life so
[57:55] they're looking for a very good tutor
[57:57] they were looking for a very good rabbie
[58:00] praise the Lord and they had a desire
[58:02] every one person that say looking for
[58:04] rabbie he wants to have the best rabbie
[58:07] praise the lord and there are some
[58:08] they're trying to look with an
[58:10] intelligence to find the most
[58:11] intelligent rabbie praise the Lord but
[58:14] there are some they have the right heart
[58:16] the seed of God praise the lord they're
[58:18] looking for a rabbie with the right
[58:20] heart praise the Lord and it starts at a
[58:22] very young age praise the Lord so this
[58:25] was so we know so so so the disciples
[58:28] have been in an age praise the Lord
[58:31] where they were looking for an Rabbi
[58:33] praise the Lord so they were at a young
[58:35] age so it could been 15 it could be 13
[58:38] it could be 16 17 18 praise the Lord
[58:41] very young age so the scholars come from
[58:44] the other side and they come from the
[58:45] end of the disciples and they were
[58:47] counting back and say how old have they
[58:50] been so and um first of all first of all
[58:54] before we go into old they said they
[58:57] said if they were no more children with
[58:59] 13 because they were already experienced
[59:02] they were fishermen they had their own
[59:04] boat they were going out the whole day
[59:07] working already so they had the ability
[59:10] actually to work the whole day and to
[59:11] earn some money so it was not perhaps at
[59:14] the age of 13 but maybe age of 16 or 17
[59:18] or 18 I don't know I we don't know but
[59:21] another striking thing is he said
[59:23] normally he said at the age of 20
[59:26] the people are married in Israel as it
[59:29] was custody so the only one that was
[59:31] married was Peter and Peter was the
[59:33] oldest and the others were not married
[59:37] okay and Jesus loved to have fellowship
[59:39] with the young people praise the Lord he
[59:42] Lov to be among the young people and
[59:44] it's very striking because Lazarus and
[59:47] Maria and Mara were not married so it
[59:50] must have been the only thing what I F
[59:52] what they found out if you don't marry
[59:54] was because of leprosy in the family
[59:56] that was a reason not to marry not to
[59:58] continue that so somehow if three of
[1:00:01] them were not married it must have been
[1:00:03] some young people praise the Lord and
[1:00:05] Jesus loved to be among young people
[1:00:08] praise the Lord and young people were
[1:00:10] looking for the right rubie is that
[1:00:13] right praise the Lord so don't take it
[1:00:16] as a law but take it as an approach to
[1:00:19] say Jesus loved the young people and he
[1:00:21] wanted to be around them and he knew
[1:00:24] they needed a rabie he knew they needed
[1:00:27] a guide he knew they needed a comforter
[1:00:30] they he knew they still have to
[1:00:32] learn praise the Lord this were young
[1:00:36] how do you say young wine tubes they
[1:00:40] were flexible they were ready to learn
[1:00:42] they want to approach something in life
[1:00:45] they were not settled they were not
[1:00:47] satisfied with the things they heard but
[1:00:48] they wanted some more praise the Lord
[1:00:52] hallelujah and they wanted somebody to
[1:00:54] follow and to follow follow his patter
[1:00:57] after the rabie until age
[1:01:00] 30 so once they reach age 30 they should
[1:01:04] be mature enough to be become an own
[1:01:06] rabbie and to get disciples to
[1:01:08] themselves so they have been under 30
[1:01:11] years about and if you look about Peter
[1:01:14] himself he counted him an old man 60
[1:01:17] years 30 years after Jesus pass it made
[1:01:21] him about 30 years old praise the Lord
[1:01:24] maybe younger maybe 20 we don't know the
[1:01:27] gospel of Matthew was written 30 or 40
[1:01:30] years after Jesus resurrecting
[1:01:33] indicating Matthew was perhaps in his
[1:01:36] 20s okay so this are just like something
[1:01:39] we we would like to approach that
[1:01:41] because many days and that's what all
[1:01:43] the scholars what they writing is many
[1:01:45] times they they they they you see the
[1:01:48] pictures they are drawn and you see old
[1:01:50] man sitting together with Jesus but I
[1:01:54] want to change the picture tonight
[1:01:56] because it was young people looking for
[1:02:02] rabum and John according to church
[1:02:05] history lived the Longs 60 years after
[1:02:08] Walking With Jesus he was 90 years
[1:02:10] old so he was 30 years but probably 20
[1:02:15] he said old enough to take care for
[1:02:17] Jesus mother that's what we know he was
[1:02:20] old enough to take care but he was some
[1:02:22] young people praise the Lord so this
[1:02:25] said this
[1:02:26] praise the Lord amen a little approach
[1:02:29] to say that the disciples have been a
[1:02:30] young young people they needed a
[1:02:34] rbie they were not ready yet to lead
[1:02:38] themselves and they said heart they saw
[1:02:41] something in Jesus he said I see that
[1:02:45] what he
[1:02:46] says where was
[1:02:48] thou where was th you were there under
[1:02:52] that
[1:02:53] tree how do you know H you must be the
[1:02:59] Messiah they recognize Jesus as a
[1:03:03] messiah we have found him come and see
[1:03:08] he's the rabie he's the high priest he's
[1:03:11] the highest rabie praise the Lord I give
[1:03:14] up all everything and follow
[1:03:17] Jesus that makes it easy to follow Jesus
[1:03:20] if you recognize who Jesus is praise the
[1:03:24] Lord and say we need a rabbi we need
[1:03:27] somebody to
[1:03:28] follow praise the Lord and brother they
[1:03:32] were growing in the face they were
[1:03:34] coming to Perfection praise the Lord
[1:03:37] raise up from children praise the Lord
[1:03:39] but coming to be mature and Al
[1:03:42] enough praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:03:46] amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:03:50] hallelujah just give him praise andall
[1:03:52] Hallelujah say thank you Jesus you have
[1:03:55] chosen me I not chosen you but he has
[1:03:58] chosen you praise the Lord and Satan can
[1:04:01] do nothing against it he has chosen you
[1:04:04] praise the Lord he was just looking to
[1:04:07] pass your way he just looking to a
[1:04:09] crossroad where he can wait on you
[1:04:12] praise the Lord where you were coming
[1:04:13] along praise the Lord he was looking for
[1:04:15] that place in
[1:04:17] 2024 where he can meet you praise the
[1:04:20] Lord and say here I am I'm the big
[1:04:22] Shepherd come unto me praise the Lord
[1:04:25] follow me and he said my sheep hear my
[1:04:29] voice and they follow me and a stranger
[1:04:34] they don't know praise the
[1:04:37] Lord and his disciples who have been
[1:04:39] with Jesus he was a he was in his 30 he
[1:04:43] was ready a rabbi he was trained from
[1:04:46] childhood we know when he was 12 years
[1:04:49] he left his parents and went into the
[1:04:52] temple praise the Lord he was mature was
[1:04:56] looking is there a rabbie praise the
[1:04:58] Lord but he had a rabbie a rabbie in
[1:05:00] heaven and he told Mary I need to be
[1:05:03] with at my father's business he had his
[1:05:06] rabbie praise the Lord and he was
[1:05:08] talking with the rabbie on Earth but he
[1:05:10] was 12 years identifying it that 12
[1:05:13] years was an age to move out praise the
[1:05:16] Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah and
[1:05:19] 12 years he was ready he was prepared he
[1:05:23] was ready to get some disciples amen
[1:05:26] according to the Jewish tradition praise
[1:05:29] the Lord so God had all a program and he
[1:05:31] worked it out surely he did praise the
[1:05:33] Lord so praise the Lord here some young
[1:05:36] people are go going along with Jesus
[1:05:39] praise the Lord and Jesus wants to train
[1:05:42] them Jesus wants to train them to stand
[1:05:45] alone in the darkest hour to stand
[1:05:49] praise the Lord in 2024 to
[1:05:52] stand praise the Lord Jesus is training
[1:05:55] you to to stand when there's no light to
[1:05:58] stand David was strained to stand David
[1:06:02] said if I make my bed in hell he's still
[1:06:06] with me David was a trained young man he
[1:06:09] knew how to stand he knew that the
[1:06:12] presence of God is with him always and
[1:06:15] he knew how to activate the secret he
[1:06:18] knew how to activate the presence of God
[1:06:21] praise the Lord read Psalm 23 doesn't it
[1:06:24] activate the presence of of
[1:06:26] God praise the Lord surely surely
[1:06:31] goodness and mercy is following me all
[1:06:35] the days of my life maybe maybe that was
[1:06:38] something David said when he was 30 he
[1:06:41] was trained praise the Lord he said the
[1:06:43] Lord never leave me he went through his
[1:06:46] battles praise the Lord and He knews the
[1:06:48] Lord never left him praise the Lord and
[1:06:52] he knew how to call down the presence of
[1:06:54] the Lord
[1:06:56] praise the Lord let us stand and read
[1:06:57] the scripture hallelujah praise the
[1:07:01] [Music]
[1:07:05] Lord let's go to John
[1:07:08] 14 praise the Lord and I want to speak
[1:07:12] tonight about overcoming in the
[1:07:16] absence praise the Lord because in the
[1:07:19] absence of his presence there is where
[1:07:21] you have to overcome young people and
[1:07:24] you are more than than Overcomers let me
[1:07:27] put that first you're more than
[1:07:30] Overcomers because the seed is in you
[1:07:33] praise the Lord Satan didn't put a seed
[1:07:36] in you but God before the foundation of
[1:07:38] the world put a seed in you and there's
[1:07:41] a promise to that seed said this seed
[1:07:43] shall inherit the gates of the enemy it
[1:07:47] shall Prevail in the darkest hour in the
[1:07:50] absence and 2,000 years ago Jesus was in
[1:07:55] the Tomb
[1:07:56] the tomb was closed and it was an
[1:07:59] absence and the disciples were in an
[1:08:01] absent
[1:08:02] [Music]
[1:08:06] situation and I want to take the
[1:08:09] scripture for the time of absence in
[1:08:11] your
[1:08:13] life let not your heart be
[1:08:17] troubled praise the Lord let it not be
[1:08:21] troubled if Jesus says that it finish it

[1:08:49] troubled believe in God and believe also
[1:08:54] in me the rabbi is speaking in my
[1:08:57] father's house there are many
[1:09:00] Mansion if it were not so I would have
[1:09:02] not told you he's giving them a
[1:09:05] promise I go and I prepare a place for
[1:09:08] you Jesus says I go there will be some
[1:09:12] time of absence I will go there's a time
[1:09:16] of absence but he said don't let your
[1:09:18] heart be
[1:09:19] troubled he said praise the Lord I'm
[1:09:22] going for a
[1:09:24] reason I'm going in my absence I have a
[1:09:27] reason to go I'm preparing a place and
[1:09:31] that place is not for myself that place
[1:09:33] is for

[1:09:38] troubled and if I go and prepare a place
[1:09:42] for you yes sir he said I will come
[1:09:45] again the absence will have a finish in
[1:09:49] your life absence has a finish praise
[1:09:53] the Lord the time of her absence of his
[1:09:56] presence will have a finish because he

[1:10:18] Hallelujah in his meetings to receive
[1:10:22] you unto myself there's a purpose of the
[1:10:24] word
[1:10:25] there's a purpose of the spirit he says
[1:10:28] I want to receive you to myself that
[1:10:31] where I am there you may be
[1:10:35] also Heavenly Father we have read your
[1:10:38] word Lord Jesus we thank you for your
[1:10:41] presence Lord Jesus Lord may you open up
[1:10:45] father Lord this beautiful scripture
[1:10:48] Lord father this beautiful Promises of
[1:10:51] your word Lord Jesus that we can go out
[1:10:53] father Victorious father from every
[1:10:56] absence in our life tonight father Lord
[1:10:59] Jesus we pray it in Jesus name father
[1:11:02] amen and amen amen you may be
[1:11:07] seated
[1:11:10] hallelujah amen for the
[1:11:14] technician you can put up this this
[1:11:16] first slide with Jesus on the sea praise
[1:11:20] the Lord and when I speak with to the
[1:11:22] young people sometimes I just take one
[1:11:25] or two or three slides and I want to use
[1:11:27] it tonight too for an encouragement for
[1:11:30] you and to get a bit better picture
[1:11:33] praise a lot about a situation of an
[1:11:35] absence and that's the first situation I
[1:11:38] want to speak about an absence and now
[1:11:40] we heard and we know that the disciples
[1:11:42] were on a training field and Jesus the
[1:11:45] rabbie was training them for life
[1:11:47] because he knew there would come a time
[1:11:49] they would have to stand alone praise
[1:11:52] the Lord and Jesus is look not looking
[1:11:54] on the failures
[1:11:55] praise the Lord Jesus was not looking on
[1:11:58] the failures of Peter because he said
[1:12:00] Peter I have prayed for you praise the
[1:12:04] Lord if you fall in absence I have
[1:12:06] prayed for you that your face will not
[1:12:08] cease praise the Lord so here we see
[1:12:12] Jesus walking on the water praise the
[1:12:15] Lord now let me tell you now this is the
[1:12:18] scripture we're taking from Mark 6
[1:12:21] praise the Lord and Mark 6 says that
[1:12:23] Jesus was on the mountain he went to the
[1:12:25] mountain to pray praise the Lord and he
[1:12:28] sent his disciples away and praise the
[1:12:31] Lord and when Jesus sends
[1:12:33] you you can be sure no devil can come
[1:12:36] against
[1:12:37] you except unbelief sets in Praise the
[1:12:41] Lord so Jesus sent him to go on the
[1:12:44] other side Jesus told him that in his
[1:12:46] Destiny is the other side of the sea
[1:12:49] praise the Lord but somehow in the
[1:12:52] middle of the sea a storm rages up
[1:12:56] praise the Lord and Jesus was not
[1:12:58] present he was absent in the middle of
[1:13:02] the sea and something happened to them
[1:13:06] and they didn't follow their heart but
[1:13:09] somehow reasoning set in imagination
[1:13:12] setting in if this boat will drown we're
[1:13:15] in the middle of the sea at the false
[1:13:18] watch of the night we in the middle of
[1:13:20] the sea and the reasoning started
[1:13:22] running the imagining started going
[1:13:25] praise the Lord and and they were
[1:13:27] troubled praise the Lord much trouble
[1:13:30] when Jesus is not there praise the Lord
[1:13:33] but Jesus gave them the word and said go
[1:13:36] on the other side there was a
[1:13:39] commission praise the Lord one time
[1:13:42] Jesus said go two by two lay their hands
[1:13:45] on them and the sick shall be
[1:13:47] healed now then there were a little bit
[1:13:49] more advanced and they went and they
[1:13:52] healed the sick the sick got healed two
[1:13:56] by two they went praise the Lord and
[1:13:58] they came back rejoicing and they
[1:14:00] rejoiced that the demons were obeying
[1:14:02] them and Jesus said don't Rejoice that
[1:14:05] but Rejoice that your name is written in
[1:14:08] heaven praise the
[1:14:11] Lord praise the Lord because he said
[1:14:13] your destiny is in heaven praise the
[1:14:16] Lord Rejoice about it praise the Lord
[1:14:19] amen but here a short while Jesus says
[1:14:22] go on the other side now Jesus
[1:14:25] in intention to go also on the other
[1:14:28] side let us go in the scripture Mark
[1:14:34] 6:47 and when even was
[1:14:38] come when Eve Ean the Eve was come the
[1:14:42] ship was in the midst of the sea and he
[1:14:45] alone on the
[1:14:47] land and he saw them toiling
[1:14:52] rowing now if Jesus saw his disciples
[1:14:55] rolling trolling rolling
[1:14:58] whatever he's looking down tonight and
[1:15:01] he sees if there's anybody in here if
[1:15:04] there's anybody listening that is
[1:15:06] trolling the boats the ship the Troubles
[1:15:10] of life has started a boat to troll and
[1:15:14] to roll in a hard sea but Jesus is
[1:15:18] looking down and he sees
[1:15:21] that but he said go on the other side
[1:15:24] you have commission go on the other
[1:15:27] side and he was alone and and he saw
[1:15:30] them toiling not rolling toiling in
[1:15:33] rowing for the wind was contrary to them
[1:15:37] and about the Fourth Watch of the night
[1:15:40] he cometh unto them walking upon the sea
[1:15:43] and would have passed by
[1:15:46] them now have this
[1:15:49] picture Jesus is sending them he said go
[1:15:52] on the other side and he
[1:15:55] speaks and he says I want to meet you on
[1:15:58] the other
[1:15:59] side and he sends them the wind comes
[1:16:02] the storm comes he sees them and Jesus
[1:16:05] says I have to make myself I have to go
[1:16:07] on the other side too because I have an
[1:16:09] appointment on the other side and he
[1:16:12] made them as he would pass
[1:16:17] by it says and he would have passed by
[1:16:23] them that that means jesus' purpose was
[1:16:26] to pass by he would have passed by them
[1:16:31] praise the Lord he had a purpose he had
[1:16:34] a meeting point on the other side praise
[1:16:36] the Lord and he wanted to meet his
[1:16:39] disciples on the other
[1:16:41] side that was the
[1:16:49] situation because Jesus he had a big
[1:16:53] healing campaign on the other side amen
[1:16:56] he was focused he said there going to be
[1:16:58] some demons driven out on the other side
[1:17:02] some lame will be walking some blind
[1:17:04] will be seeing on the other side praise
[1:17:07] the Lord and he was making to pass
[1:17:10] by verse
[1:17:13] 54 and they were and when they were come
[1:17:17] out of the ship straight away they knew
[1:17:21] him let let us go before
[1:17:26] praise the Lord because his Destiny was
[1:17:30] on the other side on the other
[1:17:33] side what
[1:17:35] happened we come shortly verse
[1:17:39] 48 and he would have passed by them and
[1:17:43] when they saw him walking upon the sea
[1:17:47] they supposed it had been a spirit
[1:17:51] praise the Lord they didn't recognize
[1:17:54] the presence of the Lord they were not
[1:17:57] trained yet well praise the Lord but
[1:18:00] Jesus was the rabbi and he says I'm
[1:18:02] going to train them praise the Lord so
[1:18:05] he's passing them by he's walking them
[1:18:08] and he wants to know how is their
[1:18:10] reaction do they recognize
[1:18:13] me and the disciples young in age they
[1:18:17] looking and they say they said is a
[1:18:20] ghost they didn't recognize Jesus
[1:18:24] sometimes we didn't recognize his
[1:18:27] presence we think it's a ghost it's a
[1:18:30] strange but a great rbie is
[1:18:33] there now the now the Bible says and
[1:18:37] take verse 49 and verse 15 together
[1:18:41] because it's a double dot here they
[1:18:44] supposed it had been a
[1:18:48] spirit and
[1:18:49] then they cried out double point for
[1:18:54] they all saw
[1:18:58] him they saw his a
[1:19:01] spirit and then they saw
[1:19:04] him double thought and they cried out
[1:19:09] because they saw
[1:19:11] him they recognize it's not a
[1:19:15] ghost somehow they recognize it's a
[1:19:19] rabbie walking on the
[1:19:21] water Brothers can you put up the
[1:19:24] picture again
[1:19:28] why I love this
[1:19:31] picture because this picture
[1:19:35] somehow they created it a big storm and
[1:19:39] you see how the waves going left and
[1:19:43] going right now you said it all the
[1:19:46] fullness dwelt in Jesus
[1:19:51] Christ 20,000 years before amen the same
[1:19:56] Jesus in the form of the pillar of
[1:20:00] fire was coming on the water and a ways
[1:20:04] moved left and right left and right for
[1:20:09] a people of Israel to walk through on
[1:20:12] dry
[1:20:15] feet the presence of God was already on
[1:20:18] the
[1:20:19] water and what it did it put the water
[1:20:22] to the left and the right you can keep
[1:20:25] the picture
[1:20:26] up thank you
[1:20:29] Brothers now
[1:20:31] Jesus the fullness of God dwelt in
[1:20:35] him and he started to walk on the
[1:20:38] water praise the Lord and the water
[1:20:42] Stood
[1:20:43] Still praise the Lord it couldn't move
[1:20:47] when the presence of God was there
[1:20:50] hallelujah praise the Lord where Jesus
[1:20:52] was everything has to set still praise
[1:20:56] the Lord and Jesus was walking on dry
[1:20:59] feet praise the Lord there was no
[1:21:01] drowning because here comes the master
[1:21:05] praise the Lord 4,000 years ago the same
[1:21:09] spirit of God was bruising over the
[1:21:12] water and the water recognized the same
[1:21:15] Jesus is walking on me
[1:21:18] now he's going to do another
[1:21:21] miracle the same Jesus walking on
[1:21:25] [Applause]
[1:21:28] water the water recognized it but the
[1:21:32] disciples did
[1:21:33] not why was it that the water recognized
[1:21:37] it that it was Jesus it was strong it
[1:21:40] holded it the elements got
[1:21:43] fixed the elements normally is a very
[1:21:46] solid if you take water and you run it
[1:21:49] through your through your fingers it
[1:21:51] just run through but when the master was
[1:21:54] coming
[1:21:55] these elements got straightened out they
[1:21:58] got their mind
[1:21:59] fixed nature got their mind
[1:22:02] fixed when Jesus was
[1:22:05] coming praise the Lord and was carrying
[1:22:07] Jesus
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:10] Christ but the
[1:22:12] disciples had too much
[1:22:15] reasoning the water has no
[1:22:17] reasoning the water is just running the
[1:22:21] way God told the water to run
[1:22:25] it says you're a liquid element and you
[1:22:28] run down everywhere you find
[1:22:32] space and you Marvel on that one if you
[1:22:36] have a hole in the
[1:22:38] roof somewhere the water will come down
[1:22:42] praise the Lord the leak will be here
[1:22:46] but the water will go down there because
[1:22:49] the water will find a way to go down if
[1:22:52] there's any leak the water will find it
[1:22:55] praise the Lord so that's the law of
[1:22:58] water it was given by the
[1:23:01] Creator and it has no
[1:23:04] reasoning the problem was the disciples
[1:23:07] had
[1:23:10] reasoning praise the
[1:23:12] Lord praise the Lord but one day was
[1:23:18] coming when the word says greater is he
[1:23:21] that is in
[1:23:23] you
[1:23:25] when those disciples got
[1:23:29] adult greater is he that is in you and
[1:23:33] the elements started to obey elements of
[1:23:37] sickness had to change their
[1:23:42] law because their element of law was
[1:23:46] timely sickness is
[1:23:49] timely but his presence is
[1:23:52] eternal and his presence
[1:23:58] prevails so they were in their
[1:24:00] imagination in their reasoning and it
[1:24:03] got them in trouble praise the Lord but
[1:24:06] the master was training them praise the
[1:24:09] Lord
[1:24:11] hallelujah praise the Lord and
[1:24:15] Jesus praise the Lord and immediately he
[1:24:18] says immediately he talked with them
[1:24:22] when they recognized him and he says
[1:24:25] unto them be of good cheer it is I be
[1:24:28] not be afraid praise the Lord he come
[1:24:32] with a comfort the comforter has come to
[1:24:35] them praise the Lord now brother
[1:24:37] brandham in the message the healing of
[1:24:39] y's daughter he says so we see him
[1:24:42] tonight going up on the mountain and
[1:24:45] disciples trust out in the sea and pick
[1:24:48] up their ores and their little ship sale
[1:24:50] went up and away they started oring
[1:24:53] across the other side where Jesus was to
[1:24:55] meet them on the other side then going
[1:24:58] in the absence of the Holy Spirit praise
[1:25:01] the Lord oh Christ then in the visible
[1:25:04] form on the road over trouble sets in
[1:25:08] Praise the Lord outside of the presence
[1:25:09] of the Holy Spirit brother BR says
[1:25:11] trouble sets in and usually if you start
[1:25:15] anywhere without Christ troubles on the
[1:25:18] road praise the Lord that's why an
[1:25:21] absence comes in our life praise the
[1:25:23] Lord just just as soon as the Devils
[1:25:26] sees you out of fellowship with Christ
[1:25:29] praise the Lord so God Is Watching and
[1:25:31] the devil is watching you too and
[1:25:33] brother B says as soon as you get out of
[1:25:35] his presence then he is a way to tackle
[1:25:39] then he is a way to come in Praise the
[1:25:42] Lord right then he will set out for you
[1:25:45] as hard as he can just as soon as he
[1:25:48] sees you away from prayer and away from
[1:25:51] consecration Satan will catch you right
[1:25:54] then if he possibly
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:26:00] can and I believe we know these times in
[1:26:03] our
[1:26:05] lives when we have let down the barns of
[1:26:09] our prayer
[1:26:11] life and our consecration to
[1:26:14] him and give him
[1:26:17] room give him room in our lives and we
[1:26:20] all have fallen short of that
[1:26:24] but the rabbi was training
[1:26:27] us he was teaching
[1:26:31] you he showed them the elements have
[1:26:38] respect when I'm
[1:26:40] there praise the Lord my title tonight
[1:26:44] overcoming in the
[1:26:46] absence praise the Lord when you're
[1:26:49] alone when nobody is around when you're
[1:26:53] feeling down
[1:26:54] when you're feeling sick when you feel
[1:26:58] that all hope is
[1:26:59] gone praise the Lord he's training you
[1:27:04] to
[1:27:07] [Applause]
[1:27:15] [Applause]
[1:27:18] overcome let me move on time is
[1:27:23] precious brothers please put on the next
[1:27:28] slide you see a
[1:27:30] tomb and you see a stone before the
[1:27:34] tomb when the stone was
[1:27:38] closed it speaks about another
[1:27:41] absence of the
[1:27:44] rabbie and
[1:27:46] again
[1:27:48] again again the disciples were called in
[1:27:52] a situation where the rabie was
[1:27:56] absence and they saw death has put an
[1:28:00] absence praise the
[1:28:02] Lord praise the
[1:28:05] Lord why was the absence Jesus said and
[1:28:09] he answered that in John 219 he said
[1:28:12] destroy this Temple and in three days I
[1:28:15] will raise it up
[1:28:17] again Jesus told his disciples and Jesus
[1:28:21] told the world he had three days I'm
[1:28:24] going to be
[1:28:26] absent he said my absence has a
[1:28:29] beginning and my absence will have an
[1:28:33] end and in between was a
[1:28:37] Saturday that's why I preach about an
[1:28:40] absence on a
[1:28:41] Saturday praise the Lord but remember
[1:28:44] the absence had an end
[1:28:46] too because he had had a
[1:28:49] beginning praise the Lord and Jesus he
[1:28:52] died he laid in the Tomb
[1:28:54] his body laid in a tomb and he went down
[1:28:58] now Jesus in spirit he was not dead he
[1:29:01] was alive he had a commission to do but
[1:29:04] it was in The Invisible real he said
[1:29:06] here I have to do a chop and he went
[1:29:08] down to the souls in prison he went down
[1:29:12] to pick up the key from Satan on a
[1:29:16] Saturday praise the Lord SS in prisons
[1:29:20] there were some saints down
[1:29:22] there there were in the absence of the
[1:29:26] light Moses was in the absence of the
[1:29:29] pillar of fire job was in the absence of
[1:29:32] the Redeemer for some time Joseph was in
[1:29:35] the absence of perfection for some time
[1:29:39] praise the Lord but that absence at a
[1:29:41] beginning and that absence at an end it
[1:29:44] started with a
[1:29:46] death they put this the bones of Jo of
[1:29:50] of Joseph they put them in
[1:29:52] Egypt not in Egypt because but he said
[1:29:56] take my bones in the promised
[1:29:58] land not in Egypt he said take them out
[1:30:01] of Egypt because he know the time will
[1:30:04] come for when the absence has an end and
[1:30:08] there will be a
[1:30:10] resurrection in the land of promise so
[1:30:14] he said take my bones in the right place
[1:30:18] because my absence has a beginning and
[1:30:20] my absence has an
[1:30:22] end
[1:30:26] and when Jesus was going down on a
[1:30:31] Saturday praise the Lord and brother
[1:30:34] Brandon he's so beautifully he
[1:30:36] illustrates that he said praise the Lord
[1:30:39] he said he says all demons and all
[1:30:42] demons had a break Revival a great
[1:30:45] Revival because they thought now they
[1:30:48] had Jesus they said now they have
[1:30:50] silenced Jesus they have silenced the
[1:30:53] presence of God on the earth because
[1:30:56] they saw what Jesus was doing on the
[1:30:58] earth and they thought they silenced him
[1:31:01] but little did they know the silence was
[1:31:03] only lasting for three
[1:31:05] [Music]
[1:31:05] [Applause]
[1:31:07] days and they had a revival going on now
[1:31:11] we have him now he's gone now he's
[1:31:14] finished and B says suddenly a knock on
[1:31:18] the door of Hell a knock on the door of
[1:31:22] hell he says Sayan my absence for you
[1:31:26] has an
[1:31:27] end I'm here give me the Key of Life
[1:31:33] give me the key of hell and he took the
[1:31:36] key and he came walking and he came
[1:31:39] walking and Moses heard some steps he
[1:31:42] said this steps they sound a little
[1:31:45] different this steps sounds like a
[1:31:49] redeemer and chob heard the steps he
[1:31:52] said I know the steps
[1:31:54] I know my redeemer lives I hear the
[1:31:57] steps of my redeemer praise the Lord
[1:32:00] he's coming down a Dusty Road in Hell
[1:32:04] he's coming down to praise the Lord and
[1:32:08] suddenly they hear a key a key of life
[1:32:12] and Jesus opened the door and said come
[1:32:14] along your absence has an end your
[1:32:18] absence Moses has an end your absence
[1:32:21] Gideon has an end your absence Joshua
[1:32:25] has an end the Lord of host is back in
[1:32:29] the building I met you there in the
[1:32:32] battlefield Joshua but now the absence
[1:32:35] is over I'm back again I'm your lord of
[1:32:38] the host I come to redeem
[1:32:42] you praise the
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:52] Lord
[1:32:55] but in the visible realm you can put up
[1:32:59] the picture
[1:33:03] again people said there's
[1:33:10] nothing I could speak about a seven seal
[1:33:22] broken
[1:33:25] 61 years he came back as sea was broken
[1:33:32] again absence had an
[1:33:36] end for the
[1:33:41] bright he said I have some seats under
[1:33:44] the seventh
[1:33:47] seal they know my
[1:33:50] presence they know
[1:33:52] me and I call them it's time now for
[1:33:57] Redemption Redemption by Blood and
[1:34:00] Redemption by
[1:34:04] power at that time the disciples in
[1:34:08] invisible realm praise the Lord that's
[1:34:11] where God put them that's where God put
[1:34:14] them to train
[1:34:15] them the grave was closed amen they
[1:34:19] didn't know what was going on
[1:34:21] there they was shut am amen praise the
[1:34:29] Lord and some shut themselves in they
[1:34:34] went in
[1:34:35] Jerusalem in a in a
[1:34:39] house and they said Jesus is
[1:34:42] gone the rabbi is gone we follow it holy
[1:34:47] did we follow the lord we've been
[1:34:50] obedient in all his
[1:34:52] ways and now they have taken him
[1:34:56] away and fear sets him a fear Came Upon
[1:35:03] them but AA was speaking about the love
[1:35:06] of
[1:35:08] God and the love of God drives out all
[1:35:14] fear and when fear is it's a sign that
[1:35:18] love is
[1:35:21] missing remember that in your life
[1:35:24] when there's a fear in your life and we
[1:35:26] are coming in situation where there's
[1:35:28] fear
[1:35:29] in but when the love of God says in your
[1:35:34] life when you look to the cross and you
[1:35:37] say it was his love for
[1:35:41] me it drives out all
[1:35:46] [Applause]
[1:35:49] fear maybe in Simplicity tonight fear is
[1:35:53] driven
[1:35:56] out he said fear
[1:35:59] not I will with
[1:36:01] you peace be unto
[1:36:05] you as my father sent me so send I
[1:36:13] you the presence of Charity was
[1:36:16] missing so they en closed themselves in
[1:36:19] the
[1:36:22] house but one day Jesus was coming back
[1:36:29] again there were two
[1:36:31] disciples they were
[1:36:34] Disturbed they were
[1:36:36] confused and they said we must go out we
[1:36:40] must take a walk and sometimes we feel
[1:36:44] like we must go perhaps in nature I must
[1:36:47] take a
[1:36:49] walk and on the
[1:36:52] way
[1:36:54] Jesus is
[1:37:00] coming and
[1:37:02] Jesus is telling him don't you know the
[1:37:06] scripture
[1:37:08] am and in his presence a peace starts
[1:37:12] coming
[1:37:15] down Jehovah
[1:37:18] Shalom I'll be with you
[1:37:22] always
[1:37:25] but it took till the evening that they
[1:37:28] recognized him by the way he broke the
[1:37:36] bread now the stone was rolled away on a
[1:37:39] Sunday on the third day the stone was
[1:37:42] rolled away that's when he met the
[1:37:44] disciples and they didn't knew that
[1:37:45] Jesus was resurrected praise they still
[1:37:48] saw Jesus was
[1:37:50] absent and there was somebody else
[1:37:53] praise the Lord a disciple a strong
[1:37:56] one and in the absence of
[1:37:59] Christ he said I have my own
[1:38:03] will and if we have our own will Jesus
[1:38:05] let us
[1:38:06] go and he said I have my own will I
[1:38:11] said I have my will Jesus is not there I
[1:38:15] said I go
[1:38:16] fishing was
[1:38:18] Peter he was always Brave he said Jesus
[1:38:22] not there
[1:38:24] is that
[1:38:28] something he
[1:38:30] forgot that Jesus said in three days
[1:38:38] Peter and the Bible says they were
[1:38:43] fishing and the Bible says they were
[1:38:45] fishing all night and he was asking some
[1:38:48] other disciples don't you want to come
[1:38:49] with
[1:38:50] me and some other disciples says Jesus
[1:38:53] is not not there yes okay we go fishing
[1:38:56] too Jesus is not
[1:38:59] there they wanted to have a
[1:39:03] harvest but Jesus was not
[1:39:06] there they fished
[1:39:09] nothing nothing was
[1:39:14] finished now Peter was
[1:39:20] Brave by the hour came amen
[1:39:24] but his presence dropped
[1:39:28] down rbie was back in the
[1:39:34] house in his
[1:39:38] presence they recognized Jesus was
[1:39:42] standing on the
[1:39:48] shore and he cried out to
[1:39:52] him have you
[1:39:54] something they say we have fished the
[1:39:56] whole night and they said there's
[1:39:59] nothing
[1:40:01] Hallelujah now Jesus is revealing
[1:40:07] himself he said cast your
[1:40:10] net on the other
[1:40:13] side and brother PR said right there
[1:40:16] fishes were
[1:40:20] created in the presence of God
[1:40:23] [Applause]
[1:40:28] and when they saw
[1:40:31] that
[1:40:32] Peter he was
[1:40:35] naked he closed himself in the presence
[1:40:37] of God and he jumped in the
[1:40:51] water and we recognize Jesus was coming
[1:40:54] in the
[1:40:57] morning doesn't the song say he's coming
[1:40:59] back in the

[1:41:44] and they were able not to draw the

[1:43:11] wide final
[1:43:20] absence and you can put up the next
[1:43:22] picture
[1:43:26] there was another absence Jesus had to
[1:43:35] take and that's a scripture he said let
[1:43:39] not your heart be troubled believe in
[1:43:40] God I have to go and I will prepare a
[1:43:44] mansion He said I will be absent for
[1:43:48] you but there was a difference now in
[1:43:52] this absence
[1:43:53] for the
[1:43:55] disciples now in this absence the
[1:43:58] disciples were
[1:44:01] trained praise the Lord they knew the
[1:44:04] absence has a beginning and they knew
[1:44:06] the absence has an
[1:44:09] end they were not ignorant ignorant and
[1:44:13] unlearned praise the Lord they have
[1:44:15] become adults praise the
[1:44:18] Lord and Jesus said I go in prepared
[1:44:21] place and I come again and receive you
[1:44:23] unto myself where I go where I am that
[1:44:26] you may be also he said I go but I come
[1:44:31] again and the disciples knew when he go
[1:44:34] he will come again he will come in the
[1:44:37] form of the
[1:44:39] comforter he has to go that he can come
[1:44:42] again now this time when he comes again
[1:44:45] he comes in a different way he comes as
[1:44:48] the comforter he comes as the
[1:44:52] guideall he comes as the Holy Spirit he
[1:44:55] comes as the spirit of Truth and a time
[1:44:59] of absence has a beginning and it has an
[1:45:02] end and Jesus told him go to
[1:45:06] Jerusalem and
[1:45:08] Terry Terry for a time and the Terry has
[1:45:12] a beginning and an end but when the time
[1:45:15] of Terry has an end the comforter is
[1:45:19] back again he said I come back again
[1:45:23] the spirit of Truth is coming back again
[1:45:27] after a short time perhaps after a half
[1:45:30] an hour it says I come back again The
[1:45:33] Headstone charity is coming back
[1:45:38] again but the disciples were
[1:45:42] trained and with great
