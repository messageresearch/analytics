[1:26:24] spirit thank you for the atmosphere in
[1:26:26] the
[1:26:27] meetings amen I want to thank God for
[1:26:30] all the
[1:26:32] ministers I want to also thank brother
[1:26:36] Charles for hosting this
[1:26:39] meetings thank you for your burden of
[1:26:42] love for your little contribution to the
[1:26:45] kingdom of
[1:26:46] God may God bless you and your family
[1:26:49] and your
[1:26:50] church amen amen so greetings from back
[1:26:54] home the little church in freet
[1:26:57] toown we thank God for the grace of God
[1:27:01] and the church asked me to give the
[1:27:03] convention their
[1:27:05] greetings and on behalf of my wife
[1:27:07] sister s Sweet s
[1:27:10] s we're happy to be
[1:27:14] Ino we love
[1:27:16] you and we thank God for this time of
[1:27:20] Fellowship I'm trusting God that God
[1:27:22] make this moment an eternal moment with
[1:27:26] God so we can meet God face to
[1:27:30] face I I know the challenges many of us
[1:27:34] face We
[1:27:36] believe We
[1:27:38] Believe see have to preach
[1:27:42] adoption and the first part of adoption
[1:27:44] is to place the position the believer in
[1:27:49] position see because scripturally
[1:27:53] all things are supposed to be possible
[1:27:55] to them that
[1:27:59] believe so belief should make way for
[1:28:04] possibilities so that takes a
[1:28:07] positioning and so but Bram had to be
[1:28:10] given a
[1:28:12] voice and that voice was an
[1:28:15] angel a
[1:28:17] manifestation to make belief
[1:28:20] possible and that should be our
[1:28:24] position when you say I'm Healed you are
[1:28:27] healed because that's the only way
[1:28:29] belief
[1:28:32] grows if you keep believing and nothing
[1:28:34] is happening it kills your
[1:28:38] faith many people get the
[1:28:41] backslide because many are Christians
[1:28:43] for so
[1:28:45] long and they've never had a miracle
[1:28:48] from
[1:28:50] God they don't even will know what a
[1:28:52] miracle
[1:28:53] is and that makes it hard for your faith
[1:28:56] to
[1:29:00] grow this morning you cannot function
[1:29:02] properly as a
[1:29:05] Christian without the
[1:29:08] supernatural we've tried to underplay
[1:29:13] it but you can't underplay the
[1:29:17] supernatural because that's your real
[1:29:20] origin
[1:29:22] and what becomes spiritual Faith to your
[1:29:24] heart must must first be a mental
[1:29:29] Faith because perception is
[1:29:32] reality virtuality is
[1:29:36] reality so all your what you call
[1:29:38] virtual is really
[1:29:41] real because man is always a product of
[1:29:43] his
[1:29:45] imagination so what you conceive in your
[1:29:47] mind is what you
[1:29:49] become so if your mental faith is
[1:29:53] right it affect your physical as
[1:29:57] well so we thank you for all the
[1:30:00] preachers so I'm trusting God by the
[1:30:03] time this service is
[1:30:06] over you experience the greatest
[1:30:10] Miracle a change of
[1:30:13] being a change of
[1:30:15] life not just a struggling
[1:30:18] Christian but one that knows I met God
[1:30:21] face to face
[1:30:23] Jesus changed my life you can pinpoint
[1:30:26] your miracle and where it's coming
[1:30:29] from can somebody say Amen to that
[1:30:31] church and when you put your finger to
[1:30:33] your
[1:30:34] Miracle the devil cannot deny that
[1:30:37] because God is always there to back it
[1:30:39] up that is my bath that's where I'm
[1:30:42] coming from can somebody shout
[1:30:44] hallelujah somebody shout
[1:30:47] hallelujah praise God Amen so shall we
[1:30:50] stand to our feet
[1:30:52] I want to thank God for brother
[1:30:55] AK the convention was open with
[1:30:58] prophetic
[1:31:00] aons that this this meeting nothing will
[1:31:03] overshadow you than the Holy
[1:31:06] Ghost I believe God will honor that
[1:31:09] tonight I want also thank for all the
[1:31:10] ministers the things to
[1:31:13] preach I believe all the previous
[1:31:14] meetings was RA your faith
[1:31:17] up into the
[1:31:19] spirit because once you get into the
[1:31:23] spirit you begin to function
[1:31:26] normally then to be a Christian becomes
[1:31:31] normal you don't have to struggle
[1:31:34] anymore because you are back in position
[1:31:37] as a
[1:31:38] Believer can somebody say Amen to that
[1:31:40] church so therefore let's turn to the
[1:31:42] Bible
[1:31:43] tonight I have a little subject on a
[1:31:45] little thought I won't stay very
[1:31:47] long sons of God coming
[1:31:50] back but the the
[1:31:53] said manifested Sons most step out by
[1:31:58] faith so tonight we stepping out by
[1:32:01] faith but I have one inspiration from
[1:32:04] Exodus chapter
[1:32:06] 7 God told
[1:32:08] Moses he said
[1:32:10] see I've made the a god unto
[1:32:13] Pharaoh so tonight let's turn to first
[1:32:17] of all the book of um Romans chapter
[1:32:20] 8
[1:32:22] praise God
[1:32:24] hallelujah thank you brother Olu for
[1:32:26] this
[1:32:27] morning brother
[1:32:29] dly that was a newly discovered
[1:32:33] gift go God bless you
[1:32:35] brother appreciate your tast on the word
[1:32:38] of
[1:32:39] God
[1:32:41] Amen brother thank you very much
[1:32:44] bringing us back to the Covenant
[1:32:46] confirmation of the
[1:32:47] Covenant amen Romans chapter 8
[1:32:52] I'll read from verse
[1:32:57] 19 I would like to see if I would just
[1:32:59] continue on from where brother left this
[1:33:03] morning is is a is a good
[1:33:07] player he knows how to lay the ball
[1:33:09] right on your
[1:33:11] feet I think it's like Missy and
[1:33:13] somebody else you just know how to lay
[1:33:14] the ball on
[1:33:15] track so he has a way of he has a way of
[1:33:18] bringing the
[1:33:19] word and it just makes it easier to
[1:33:21] score
[1:33:23] goals so so tonight it makes it easier
[1:33:25] for me to score goals tonight and we're
[1:33:28] going to score some goals
[1:33:29] tonight can somebody say amen hallelujah
[1:33:34] Glory Romans chapter
[1:33:36] 8 it reads on his wise he said for the
[1:33:40] honest expectation of the creature
[1:33:42] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:33:44] sons of
[1:33:47] God for the creature was made subject to
[1:33:50] vanity not willingly
[1:33:52] but by reason of him who had subjected
[1:33:54] the same in
[1:33:58] Hope but because the creature itself
[1:34:00] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[1:34:02] of corruption into the Glorious Liberty
[1:34:04] of the chain of
[1:34:10] God for we know that the whole creation
[1:34:13] granth and travaileth in pain until
[1:34:20] now and not only they but ourselves also
[1:34:23] which have the first fruit of the spirit
[1:34:26] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:34:28] waiting for the adoption to wait the
[1:34:30] Redemption of our
[1:34:38] body hallelujah hallelujah I want to
[1:34:41] quickly give you a scripture let I
[1:34:42] forget from Psalms chapter 16:5 keep it
[1:34:45] in your mind Psalm 165 the Lord is the
[1:34:49] portion of my inheritance
[1:34:52] and of my
[1:34:54] C thou maintainers my
[1:34:58] Lord the Lord is the portion of mine
[1:35:05] inheritance and of my
[1:35:08] C and let's quickly turn to the book of
[1:35:11] um
[1:35:16] Exodus this was God calling Moses for a
[1:35:20] commission sending Mo giving Moses Comm
[1:35:23] to go
[1:35:24] to to
[1:35:27] Egypt Exodus chapter
[1:35:30] 7 hallelujah praise
[1:35:33] God I'm coming there
[1:35:36] tonight
[1:35:42] amen and the Lord said unto Moses see I
[1:35:46] have made thee a God to pharaoh and Aon
[1:35:49] thy brother shall be thy prophet
[1:35:52] Thou shalt speak all that I command thee
[1:35:55] and Aon thy brother shall speak unto
[1:35:57] Pharaoh that he send the children of
[1:35:59] Israel out of his land and I will harden
[1:36:03] Pharaoh's heart and multiply my signs
[1:36:07] and my wonders the land of Egypt so God
[1:36:10] was telling Pharaoh how he would do
[1:36:12] it but we understand when God Called
[1:36:15] Moses to send Moses
[1:36:17] forth Moses had a
[1:36:19] challenge his challeng
[1:36:22] was taking back this message is not a
[1:36:26] problem but how would they believe
[1:36:30] me how will they know you send
[1:36:33] me how will they believe
[1:36:36] me amen and so God had to give Moses two
[1:36:40] signs so the giving of the two
[1:36:43] signs was for the people to believe
[1:36:48] Moses because the principle of faith
[1:36:52] faith that the angel told
[1:36:55] theam if you can make the people to
[1:36:58] believe
[1:37:01] you that's a
[1:37:03] principle that's why you see say people
[1:37:06] go which doctors they they will be
[1:37:09] healed like in the days of the
[1:37:11] Beatles people on
[1:37:13] wheelchair stepping to their
[1:37:16] show and they walked out of those
[1:37:19] whe and they came the and ask you said
[1:37:23] only God
[1:37:24] heals how can people go to the be in
[1:37:27] their show and they walk out of their
[1:37:31] richs because it's the faith because
[1:37:34] Faith Works by a
[1:37:36] law and every law is only Guided by a
[1:37:40] principle so if the principle of faith
[1:37:43] is
[1:37:44] right God will always meet you on that
[1:37:48] principle can somebody say Amen to that
[1:37:51] somebody say Amen to that church praise
[1:37:53] God Amen so God told Moses of made the a
[1:37:56] go un to Pharaoh he said but Pharaoh
[1:37:58] shall not hacking unto
[1:38:00] you
[1:38:03] on sorry please
[1:38:06] okay okay so he said I will hacken
[1:38:09] Pharaoh's and will multiply my signs and
[1:38:11] my wonders in land of
[1:38:13] Egypt but Pharaoh shall not hacken unto
[1:38:15] you that I may lay my hand upon Egypt
[1:38:18] and bring forth my armies and my people
[1:38:20] the children of Israel out of the land
[1:38:22] of Egypt by great judgment and the
[1:38:26] Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord
[1:38:28] when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt
[1:38:31] and bring out the children of Israel
[1:38:33] from among them may God bless this word
[1:38:36] tonight may be
[1:38:37] seated amen so as I just said tonight I
[1:38:41] want to see if I can come up from where
[1:38:43] the left up the
[1:38:44] night and I pray God gives us Faith
[1:38:47] tonight to receive one from the
[1:38:50] Lord why do we like to go back to
[1:38:52] Genesis
[1:38:54] account because that's our
[1:38:57] origin we will never know our beginning
[1:39:00] our true
[1:39:02] beginning until we go back to
[1:39:04] Genesis and by the Bram took us even
[1:39:07] beyond
[1:39:08] that and took us back to before things
[1:39:11] actually
[1:39:14] began Before Time began before Angels
[1:39:18] were even
[1:39:20] created
[1:39:23] before the Earth was even created before
[1:39:25] there was a
[1:39:27] heaven said we
[1:39:30] existed and that gives our existence our
[1:39:33] Eternal past and eternal
[1:39:38] quality and until that is drilled back
[1:39:41] into your
[1:39:43] heart it will be hard for you to have
[1:39:47] faith because the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:39:49] make you a son
[1:39:52] the Holy Ghost only comes to confirm
[1:39:53] your
[1:39:56] sunship because your sunship or
[1:39:58] something go deep back in his
[1:40:02] mind it took a
[1:40:05] prophet to identify where we come
[1:40:08] from there were the seven SE books came
[1:40:10] with an
[1:40:12] abstract said the abstract actually
[1:40:14] means something that could search it way
[1:40:16] all back to the
[1:40:19] beginning so so so I our beginning in
[1:40:22] real in real
[1:40:23] sense before even God started saying let
[1:40:26] there be we already
[1:40:28] existed and brother Bram tried to give
[1:40:30] quality to to our thoughts in
[1:40:33] God because everything you see on the
[1:40:35] face of the Earth was actually a thought
[1:40:37] in God because because of God's only
[1:40:41] signs God knows everything brah says
[1:40:45] even how many times the fly will B it
[1:40:48] eye that's how complex God's mind is all
[1:40:52] these things going on in the Middle East
[1:40:54] all these Isis boys God knows about
[1:40:57] them but that thought did not make up an
[1:41:01] attribute Lucifer was also in God's mind
[1:41:04] all the angels that fell they were in
[1:41:06] God's mind but when a thought becomes an
[1:41:09] attribute that's different thought so
[1:41:13] connected our thinking in God as an
[1:41:15] attribute meaning that we are not just
[1:41:17] like thoughts that exist in God's mind
[1:41:19] but our thought was God's very
[1:41:22] nature that's really who we are that's
[1:41:24] my
[1:41:26] identity can somebody say Amen to that
[1:41:29] you have a choice to either believe that
[1:41:31] or don't believe that that is the
[1:41:34] Eternal section of the
[1:41:38] book brah opened the books of
[1:41:41] Life there is a regular section in this
[1:41:44] message I've had Pentecostal preach many
[1:41:47] preach but they are preaching from the
[1:41:50] regular section C just a regular life
[1:41:53] but in this same M there's an eternal
[1:41:55] section a section in God that did not
[1:41:58] begin the prophet connected you
[1:42:02] there that is your
[1:42:08] connection and only brother Bram could
[1:42:11] do
[1:42:16] [Music]
[1:42:18] that only the prophet now listen like
[1:42:22] brother de was bringing for
[1:42:24] justification justification says you
[1:42:27] never
[1:42:28] seen the scripture says we all have
[1:42:31] seen if you if you take that scripture
[1:42:34] from the
[1:42:36] humanistic your reasoning will tell you
[1:42:38] all the mistakes you've
[1:42:41] made how do you believe you didn't never
[1:42:43] really
[1:42:44] see but in the Holy
[1:42:47] Ghost because only God didn't s
[1:42:51] so he that is born of God cannot
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:43:19] sin
[1:44:20] love
[1:44:21] oh once
[1:44:24] lost but
[1:44:27] now I
[1:44:30] found was
[1:44:33] blind but
[1:44:37] now I see let me see
[1:44:43] that so our origin even goes beyond the
[1:44:46] Holy
[1:44:48] Ghost said the Holy Ghost is even
[1:44:51] a temporal
[1:44:53] gift he said the real gift is your
[1:44:57] soul that existed before there was a
[1:45:01] spirit and you see gave quality to our
[1:45:05] soul the all spoke this morning on
[1:45:09] Spirits we were not just
[1:45:11] Spirit but you see in our spirit Soul
[1:45:14] was this thing called
[1:45:17] theophany a theophany gives quality to
[1:45:20] your soul
[1:45:23] it frees that soul from deception and
[1:45:25] fals
[1:45:27] hold because a theophan knows all
[1:45:31] things and only God knows all
[1:45:34] things that is a
[1:45:36] catgory the angels that fell that was
[1:45:39] deceived in
[1:45:41] heaven they were spirit that came out
[1:45:44] from God but that Spirit the nature of
[1:45:47] that Spirit they didn't have a theophany
[1:45:51] if they had a theophany they would not
[1:45:53] have been deceived they would have known
[1:45:56] that Lucifer is not God so even though
[1:45:59] they were spirits but the quality of
[1:46:01] their nature the quality of your nature
[1:46:05] of your soul is the same as the nature
[1:46:07] so the quality of a man's
[1:46:10] spirit is what his soul
[1:46:13] knows can somebody say Amen to that can
[1:46:16] somebody say Amen to that soam said
[1:46:19] where we want
[1:46:22] lived in our
[1:46:24] souls we lived in this thing called
[1:46:29] theophany he said when God created man
[1:46:31] he created him a
[1:46:33] theophany that is why Adam could not be
[1:46:37] deceived says Adam Soul though it was a
[1:46:40] city form but it was a theophany you
[1:46:42] can't deceive a theophany you cannot
[1:46:44] light with theophany the theophany
[1:46:47] content in your soul is what frees your
[1:46:50] soul from falsehood and from deception
[1:46:52] can somebody say Amen to that church
[1:46:54] that is your
[1:46:57] [Music]
[1:46:59] class
[1:47:01] see
[1:47:06] see man God man had two
[1:47:10] Consciousness there's a lower
[1:47:13] self-consciousness that was Adam's 27
[1:47:17] man the humanistic consciousness
[1:47:21] but Adam had a higher
[1:47:25] self so Adam's ultimate was not
[1:47:30] justly what will he was went way back
[1:47:32] Beyond his Earthly
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:36] limitations because Adam had a self up
[1:47:38] in
[1:47:41] heaven which is what we call Genesis
[1:47:44] 126 that was his God
[1:47:48] self so when God put genesis6 came to
[1:47:52] show the
[1:47:53] connections because before Adam even
[1:47:55] became before God formed him from the
[1:47:58] earth Adam was already moving
[1:48:04] of even after God formed him from the
[1:48:08] Earth was already there it was leading
[1:48:11] the animals like the Holy Ghost leads
[1:48:12] the church
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:15] today but Adam was not still a conscious
[1:48:17] was not still he was not he didn't have
[1:48:19] consciousness of the higher
[1:48:21] self so God had to make the
[1:48:24] connection and when that connection came
[1:48:26] on
[1:48:27] Adam he became a living
[1:48:30] Soul then he had a higher
[1:48:34] self-consciousness then he knew he was
[1:48:35] not only a humanistic person even though
[1:48:39] in his body was made in the image of
[1:48:41] animals but there was something in him
[1:48:43] higher than his lower self and that was
[1:48:46] the god PA that was the God created path
[1:48:50] can somebody say
[1:48:52] hallelujah so you see when Adam
[1:48:55] fell when Adam fell Adam lost
[1:48:58] consciousness of this higher
[1:49:05] self and that's why you need the Holy
[1:49:09] Ghost because if the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:49:11] come you can only see yourself relative
[1:49:13] to the
[1:49:15] humanistic that's your height that who
[1:49:17] you
[1:49:18] are but there's not the self of
[1:49:22] you that is in the
[1:49:25] spirit can somebody say hallelujah these
[1:49:28] things is speaking
[1:49:31] about this God Parts you are a part of
[1:49:33] God you are a gene of
[1:49:36] God you need to experience that other
[1:49:40] part that part that relate you to
[1:49:44] God if that part is not there there's no
[1:49:48] connection you are still human
[1:49:50] say you can only live in humanistic
[1:49:53] real can somebody say Amen to that
[1:49:55] church and that's why the Holy Ghost is
[1:49:57] so important but the ho gave a Cod this
[1:49:58] morning when the Holy Ghost come to your
[1:50:00] hand you become a twofold
[1:50:02] being any man that receive the Holy
[1:50:04] Ghost knows a being stepping to
[1:50:07] you another man stepping to you
[1:50:10] hallelujah praise God it was not just a
[1:50:13] spirit when I receed the Holy Ghost a
[1:50:15] being is Ste into me I knew a being came
[1:50:17] by me and that being has kept me life
[1:50:20] all this way no man can challenge that I
[1:50:23] am a holy ghost fill
[1:50:25] man that is my higher
[1:50:28] self that is my next self and when I get
[1:50:32] up into that way anything is possible
[1:50:35] can somebody say hallelujah that is why
[1:50:38] you need to have the Holy Ghost to
[1:50:39] function in that realm May me see that
[1:50:42] may me see that let me see
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:47] that now when as long as Adam had this
[1:50:50] higher self
[1:50:53] consciousness in the state of his higher
[1:50:57] self he he had unrestricted access to
[1:51:04] fellowship and that's why Jesus Christ
[1:51:06] came to show
[1:51:08] you the kind of Fellowship that Adam had
[1:51:10] with
[1:51:11] God Jesus in St John 59 could say the
[1:51:15] son can do nothing of
[1:51:18] himself but what is father
[1:51:20] do and the father loves the son and show
[1:51:25] the son all that he
[1:51:26] doeth so you can't have you can't your
[1:51:29] your faith can't be
[1:51:31] potent if you not if you don't have a
[1:51:34] relationship with God your fellowship
[1:51:37] with God you see because Jesus why his
[1:51:39] faith was
[1:51:40] potent God will tell Jesus what to do
[1:51:44] next what he should do the next second
[1:51:47] the next minute the next day the next
[1:51:49] week Hallelujah that was how Adam
[1:51:52] was he didn't just give those names to
[1:51:55] Those Animals by
[1:51:56] himself he was under divine order how to
[1:52:00] name this animal how to name this animal
[1:52:03] so his faith was active when he
[1:52:07] fell he can longer access
[1:52:10] Fellowship he now had to come through a
[1:52:14] mediator and that's how that's how we
[1:52:16] are opting now through a
[1:52:18] mediator but how can a TR
[1:52:20] son for you to talk to your father
[1:52:22] except you have a
[1:52:24] mediator that's why the blood age has to
[1:52:26] come to an end the age of mediation has
[1:52:29] to come to an end because when sons of
[1:52:31] God take back that book when the
[1:52:34] fullness of God comes in you hallelujah
[1:52:37] praise God the entire Holy Ghost comes
[1:52:39] into the church Hallelujah then what is
[1:52:42] now a Mery seat becomes a judgment seat
[1:52:45] because the entire life of God comes
[1:52:47] back into the church can somebody say
[1:52:49] Amen and that brings an end to the blood
[1:52:52] age then we wouldn't need any longer a
[1:52:54] mediator to mediate between we and God
[1:52:57] that access between you and God in terms
[1:52:59] of Fellowship is taken off so when Adam
[1:53:03] loed his higher Consciousness when he
[1:53:04] fell from this higher Consciousness he
[1:53:07] lost his access to
[1:53:09] Fellowship that was why he could not run
[1:53:12] from
[1:53:18] God and how can any Christian or
[1:53:20] Minister have faith when God is not
[1:53:22] talking to
[1:53:25] you you're only talking to yourself
[1:53:28] you're only praying to yourself you
[1:53:31] can't have faith because the voice the
[1:53:34] living world is what gives Faith you can
[1:53:36] go on your knees and pray and God speaks
[1:53:39] back to you and God tells you do this do
[1:53:42] this do this and you know you cannot
[1:53:43] fail
[1:53:45] Hallelujah can somebody shout
[1:53:47] hallelujah when Adam lost his fellowship
[1:53:50] with
[1:53:53] God his faith went
[1:53:55] down then his un limited or is is the
[1:53:59] free access he had to the tree of
[1:54:02] life was taken away from him because God
[1:54:05] put Jobim to
[1:54:08] B then his Dominion to the Earth was
[1:54:10] also
[1:54:12] lost he became an ordinary
[1:54:15] man he became a five sense
[1:54:18] man he he begin to live his life in
[1:54:21] partial
[1:54:23] realization he lost his perfect
[1:54:26] Consciousness he lost really who he was
[1:54:28] in the spirit he became a slave but God
[1:54:32] came to restore us back to that that is
[1:54:34] what our restoration is not complete
[1:54:36] until we go back to Eden where our
[1:54:39] fellowship with God is no longer rest at
[1:54:42] all you can access God at any time and
[1:54:44] God can speak to you you can speak back
[1:54:46] to God because that is
[1:54:48] sunship
[1:54:51] where a man can step on the pulit and
[1:54:53] say the Holy Ghost said and say God said
[1:54:57] these are the men we need for the hour
[1:54:59] and we are coming up to that church
[1:55:01] Hallelujah the fful ministry will be men
[1:55:04] that will have t of the Lord because the
[1:55:06] prophet of the Bride must have either
[1:55:07] dust the Lord or she keep still and this
[1:55:10] is our season that we can stay forward
[1:55:12] and say God said these are manifested
[1:55:15] Sons these are real sons of God let me
[1:55:18] see them
[1:55:21] let you
[1:55:22] [Applause]
[1:55:25] seated
[1:55:28] seated you see right now your portion of
[1:55:32] Holy
[1:55:34] Ghost because the Holy Ghost is our
[1:55:36] inheritance way back before the
[1:55:40] beginning God divided himself into one
[1:55:47] seeds those then are each portion of
[1:55:50] those world seed was God
[1:55:52] himself it's like Peter said who Christ
[1:55:56] said who do me say I of man I
[1:55:59] am Peter's Revelation was
[1:56:01] prophetic he said thou are the Christ
[1:56:05] the son of the Living
[1:56:07] God you can't have sons outside son of
[1:56:11] man so it was the same Jesus son of man
[1:56:15] that came back in act chapter 2 and
[1:56:18] divided himself
[1:56:20] and gave each man a portion of himself
[1:56:23] putting them back into the Holy Spirit
[1:56:25] bringing them back to their higher self
[1:56:28] their higher Consciousness their perfect
[1:56:30] realization because in that state you
[1:56:33] cannot see let somebody say
[1:56:36] hallelujah that is your true stch of
[1:56:38] justification because the Holy Ghost in
[1:56:40] you the seed in you has never seen you
[1:56:45] can't impute it to the Holy Ghost the
[1:56:47] Holy Ghost is your state of innoc
[1:56:50] the Holy Ghost your state of perfection
[1:56:52] and the Holy Ghost you are inging in the
[1:56:54] Holy Ghost you never SE Hallelujah when
[1:56:57] the Holy Ghost comes upon you sin
[1:56:59] Consciousness goes away hallelujah
[1:57:02] praise God then you don't have to walk
[1:57:04] fearing to fall to make a mistake no the
[1:57:07] Holy Ghost is there it leads your
[1:57:09] footsteps it guides your footsteps it
[1:57:12] gives you power it's a realm of
[1:57:16] [Music]
[1:57:18] consciousness
[1:57:24] let me see
[1:57:25] that people do many wrong things to me
[1:57:27] but I'm not just conscious of
[1:57:30] hurt that's the honest truth you can't
[1:57:33] really hurt
[1:57:36] [Music]
[1:57:39] me I don't understand this thing hurt
[1:57:44] me I might know you say something wrong
[1:57:47] but once I get in my spirit it I feel
[1:57:50] comfortable that is what the Holy Ghost
[1:57:52] does it will T your turnue it will give
[1:57:55] you selfcontrol you won't just talk
[1:57:57] anyhow because there's a Superman on top
[1:58:00] of you that controls you it controls
[1:58:02] your life it conrols your temperament
[1:58:05] you just don't talk anyhow you are under
[1:58:07] control can somebody shout hallelujah
[1:58:10] can somebody shout
[1:58:12] hallelujah you're not some barar any of
[1:58:14] us we just get loose well I will tell
[1:58:16] him off you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:58:18] yet
[1:58:20] if you have the Holy Ghost he won't just
[1:58:22] let you turn somebody off he will tell
[1:58:24] you keep quiet don't do it at a time
[1:58:26] like this you are a child of God because
[1:58:28] we have to measure up to the image of
[1:58:31] Christ that is our measure he's the stat
[1:58:34] praise God Amen so my measure is not a
[1:58:37] man it's not a minister it is Jesus
[1:58:40] Christ I must be like Jesus that is my
[1:58:43] measure that is my
[1:58:46] standard let me
[1:58:48] see
[1:58:51] before I got the Holy
[1:58:53] Ghost you know I Stam I was very hot
[1:58:57] tempered very hot
[1:59:00] temper that's how I knew when the change
[1:59:06] comes I was a very rough guy but when
[1:59:09] God filled my soul I realized all my
[1:59:12] attitude change so I know where I'm
[1:59:15] coming from I I don't care how low down
[1:59:18] you are when God comes to you he raises
[1:59:21] you up to a next level you are no longer
[1:59:24] ordinary Hallelujah you become a
[1:59:27] supernatural being let somebody shout
[1:59:29] amen that is your work with
[1:59:32] [Applause]
[1:59:38] God you don't react to issues on the
[1:59:41] humanistic
[1:59:43] level because you have a higher
[1:59:48] consciousness
[1:59:51] you assess things from the level of that
[1:59:54] [Music]
[2:00:01] Consciousness and
[2:00:04] tonight I prayed for you in my
[2:00:07] room that God Almighty will give you a
[2:00:11] genuine experience by the time you leave
[2:00:14] these meetings you will know that
[2:00:17] another being is working with you
[2:00:19] somebody else is working with you Jesus
[2:00:21] say I'll be with you always you need to
[2:00:23] experience that you need to know
[2:00:25] somebody is working with you he's
[2:00:27] talking with you he's leading you
[2:00:29] Hallelujah Jesus Christ did not leave
[2:00:32] you
[2:00:34] comfortless the comforter is here
[2:00:36] tonight the Holy Ghost is here tonight
[2:00:39] that is your higher level of
[2:00:40] Consciousness once you strike that you
[2:00:43] are connected back to
[2:00:45] [Applause]
[2:00:48] God you become a living
[2:00:53] Soul then God is vibrating in you you
[2:00:56] feel God in your body you feel God in
[2:00:59] your temperament you feel God in your
[2:01:04] nature hallelujah praise God and that is
[2:01:07] your desire the seed of God in you is
[2:01:10] crying out I want an experience
[2:01:14] experiential
[2:01:16] Faith let me see that
[2:01:22] [Applause]
[2:01:25] [Music]
[2:01:34] that is man's Divine
[2:01:43] real when the prophet came back to make
[2:01:45] the
[2:01:48] connection
[2:01:50] until we come to that
[2:01:59] spot the holy spirit is
[2:02:02] tonight receive
[2:02:09] [Applause]
[2:02:16] it when we measure
[2:02:20] ourselves in the light of our failures
[2:02:22] and
[2:02:25] mistakes we can get nowh are with
[2:02:33] God that means my stress tonight is this
[2:02:36] higher P
[2:02:38] Consciousness whether you are the holy
[2:02:40] ghost or not that's not the issue just
[2:02:42] get the Holy
[2:02:44] Ghost once you get it it will help you
[2:02:46] understand a lot of things
[2:02:49] we can't talk on these Divine things
[2:02:51] from the humanistic realm but the all
[2:02:54] pray this morning is that we are Angelic
[2:02:56] beings a man might come back and give
[2:02:58] you a quat Abraham said God did make us
[2:03:02] angels and we use that cat to re you of
[2:03:05] all your angelic
[2:03:09] substance that is his
[2:03:17] seed but it's like Paul said in Hebrews
[2:03:21] 1 which of the Angels said he at any
[2:03:24] time this is my
[2:03:27] son and that was
[2:03:29] Jesus so that was Paul calling Jesus an
[2:03:33] angel but in sunship he was
[2:03:37] higher because Paul said which of those
[2:03:39] angels that God could say they should
[2:03:41] worship
[2:03:42] him so even the Realms of angels sunship
[2:03:46] is
[2:03:47] different so in the light of your
[2:03:49] position in God we have the same body as
[2:03:53] Angels but in position because we are
[2:03:55] sons of God we are made to be just like
[2:03:59] God we have the attribut of God inside
[2:04:01] of us so positionally you are held and
[2:04:05] [Applause]
[2:04:07] Angels but we have the same body we have
[2:04:09] the same thing but in
[2:04:14] position that's why it is only you that
[2:04:17] can do the works that I do not angels
[2:04:20] and even greater Works than this shall
[2:04:22] you do that commission is not given to
[2:04:25] Angels it's given to sons of God to
[2:04:28] impact eternal life how somebody should
[2:04:30] SE Hallelujah tonight somebody should
[2:04:32] say hallelujah tonight that is who you
[2:04:36] [Applause]
[2:04:40] are imagine a Christian who has been
[2:04:44] ripped of his Angelic substance and
[2:04:47] connection
[2:04:52] how do you
[2:04:59] operate but BR
[2:05:01] said before the world
[2:05:04] began
[2:05:06] will you say God created my
[2:05:09] being my spirit I wasn't conscious of
[2:05:13] that but it was there before the
[2:05:15] beginning and all of you SE in there and
[2:05:18] he said those that have the
[2:05:20] spirit he said they are a part of those
[2:05:23] Angelic beings that rotated off of God
[2:05:28] that resisted the devil's lie that's the
[2:05:31] connection there you can't whip that
[2:05:34] connection at all so you are candidate
[2:05:36] of association with angels because God's
[2:05:39] Doan seed is inside of you wherever you
[2:05:42] are angels come to minister to
[2:05:45] you angels are your ministering spirits
[2:05:49] because you are in a higher order we are
[2:05:51] sons of God now tell yourself I'm a Son
[2:05:54] of God say I'm a Son of God if you
[2:05:58] believe like this tonight then the Holy
[2:06:01] Ghost can follow you because this
[2:06:03] message is the manner this is what
[2:06:05] Angels
[2:06:08] eat if you don't connect angels to the
[2:06:11] church they can't come to that
[2:06:15] [Applause]
[2:06:17] church
[2:06:22] if you don't connect Angels if you think
[2:06:25] the people in your church don't have any
[2:06:28] Angelic
[2:06:29] Association what is an angel coming to
[2:06:31] do
[2:06:33] [Music]
[2:06:36] there then your people are
[2:06:39] dead that is not a Living Church a
[2:06:43] Living Church must have signs wonders
[2:06:45] God come down there can somebody shout
[2:06:47] hallelujah that what I know tonight
[2:06:49] because you are here God's angels are
[2:06:52] here what are they here for to minister
[2:06:54] to you to support you to give you Faith
[2:06:57] to give you a church because you came
[2:06:59] from
[2:07:02] Elohim you came from
[2:07:06] Elohim let me see
[2:07:13] that they see that like when the child
[2:07:15] said things through my Ministry because
[2:07:18] of what I
[2:07:21] preach I believe in
[2:07:23] angels I believe where I I
[2:07:26] am an angel must visit
[2:07:29] there that's what I tell God because as
[2:07:32] I move along I know Angels follow me in
[2:07:35] the aircraft Angels follow me as I go to
[2:07:38] town Angels follow me can somebody say
[2:07:41] hallelujah as I'm preaching Angels
[2:07:43] follow me glory to God hallelujah and
[2:07:46] angels are here tonight you shall
[2:07:48] receive the Holy Ghost you shall be
[2:07:50] sealed you shall be baptized with fire
[2:07:52] you shall be healed because why you came
[2:07:55] from God we are God's
[2:07:57] attributes Angels were created to serve
[2:08:07] you so Jesus was not just an ordinary
[2:08:13] son even though in body in everything he
[2:08:16] has the form of
[2:08:17] angels but in
[2:08:20] status Angels bow down to him that is
[2:08:25] where you belong as I'm speaking tonight
[2:08:28] angels will take my word and pack it
[2:08:30] into your heart because that's why they
[2:08:32] are here take the message and back it to
[2:08:35] your heart they minished with Spirit to
