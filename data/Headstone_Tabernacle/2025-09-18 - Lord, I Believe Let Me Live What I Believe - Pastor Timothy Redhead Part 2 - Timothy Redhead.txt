========================================

shot. So in the law firms and in these big places have a lot of things going on. So this person collapsed no complaint they can't find out were wrong all the scans coming back nothing and so that person had to travel and then another person went to the car I think that you know them keys start car outside &gt;&gt; maybe start the car went on the other side to put their back and when they open the car I think the car start going on the own. So when they realize what I'm more than for, they call me and ask me what to do. I said, "Please let this be the last time you all call me for this because I don't want that's not what I'm for. I am for the people in the church. &gt;&gt; You ain't even save. &gt;&gt; But people are doing what they want to do and then getting in trouble &gt;&gt; and then calling for help. &gt;&gt; But we are obligated to you." &gt;&gt; And in these things, I find out little secrets. And that's why I'm telling you, I challenge you. Do you really believe? &gt;&gt; And that is why for all these years you in Trinidad, what you're doing the message, you have 22 churches in a Trinidad in this little place. Do you know why you have 22 churches with one message book? It's because everybody thinks they know and they believe, but only to find out if they believe they would stay. And now people are exchanging membership cards, word from this church to that church, and all kinds of stuff flying around because they're looking for faith &gt;&gt; that is not there. &gt;&gt; Cuz faith is in the word, not in your mind, &gt;&gt; not in your head, &gt;&gt; not in your ideas. It is in the word. &gt;&gt; They have turned from the word &gt;&gt; to their own way. &gt;&gt; And we find now we have trouble in the church. So a lot of churches that look solid actually is solid with unbelief. &gt;&gt; Solid unbelief. And the Bible says when I come &gt;&gt; shall I find &gt;&gt; faith. Now if God saying that you better check that &gt;&gt; because I know a man saying that and he asked a question. It's not like he don't know what going on because he said shall I find and then we go back to brother Brandham quote if I find 12 And then all of a sudden at that time when I just came in the message I could that couldn't tabulate 12. &gt;&gt; Now I'm down to five &gt;&gt; because a lot of things that you thought was solid, &gt;&gt; they're not solid, brother. &gt;&gt; And that is my worry as a minister because after preaching for all these years and you ask yourself, what do we have? &gt;&gt; Where is the church? You see the little church here? &gt;&gt; That might be the church. the little group &gt;&gt; that is stick to it &gt;&gt; and stays with it &gt;&gt; that speaks volume. But I still want you to be able to know God for yourself. &gt;&gt; You cannot survive on brother Isaac experience nor brother's experience. You have to have years for yourself. And the only way you could have an experience with God is to enter into the go the gates and into his sanctuary and into a relationship where you are talking to God and God is coming back and confirm the conversation. &gt;&gt; Otherwise you have nothing. No, you have no edge. &gt;&gt; You need an edge &gt;&gt; in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil in joking &gt;&gt; not for what I see going on. &gt;&gt; So let's go into it now. &gt;&gt; Lord, how much time am I? Lord, all you put them watch on on pause. Now here's what the prophet said. Now we all know that cancer, tumor, cataracts, tuberculosis, all those things are not natural things. They are supernatural and are demons. Scripture plainly vindicates this. But this is demons in the body with growths. It got life in it and that life is a demon in the physical form. However, there are demons in the spiritual form that's in the soul. Same as they are in the body and some of these demons we see with our eyes with growths and so on. Now, every disease is a fourth dimension disease. The beginning of it you have seven dimensions and briefly I'll tell you and you know light and the various let me see if I have it here. Now many people with good thoughts, good people who try many times to rest upon some little theology, something they were taught since a child and still find that dong in their being is that soul they still have something that's not right. And whenever Christians are gathered together, you find people who has these spirits in them and it's undesirable. They don't want it. They say, "If I could only quit lying, if I could only quit lusting, if I could only quit this." And let me tell you between you and me lying is not you don't even get the idea. People are lying so easy that they're thinking is the truth &gt;&gt; and easy like that they say oh yes and after they gone you say is that a yes or a no. Well is a is a was a no. But why don't you go and make it right? And they walk away because they have come to a place where they are comfortable with a little lie &gt;&gt; with a little devil cuz even big yet it's still small. &gt;&gt; And I almost I always say if you can get caught in one area, what else is there that you are being cut with? Because it grows, it develops, it's a growth. There's demons, devils. &gt;&gt; No, I ain't come to take you onto your faith, but I'm coming to challenge you so that you will get real &gt;&gt; and stop coming to church because you should come. &gt;&gt; But come to church because you need to come. &gt;&gt; You need to see God. You need to hear from God. You need to connect with God. And as you get older, it should be more real. &gt;&gt; You're not getting young. And I say you got to know God for yourself. And there's even times where you do all that you have to do and God didn't answer. What do you do then? &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm saying Lord I believe. Help me to live &gt;&gt; what I believe. &gt;&gt; Are you getting it now? Cuz we need to get down into the crux. That's why I love brother Brennham. He went and check things. &gt;&gt; You can't hear a message and just say wonderful message. stand up and clap and then you go it and then the next day you are doing the exact opposite of what you heard that you said amen to. &gt;&gt; God didn't call us here to be hypocrites. He called us here to live what we preach, what we hear, what is said. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I heard brother uh Them talking about prophet who anybody that does anything that a prophet and it's sick, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Something wrong with them? &gt;&gt; Because why would you do something that is going nowhere &gt;&gt; and it doesn't bring no benefit &gt;&gt; and there's nothing in it. Why would you do that? &gt;&gt; So, there has to be profit in your Christian walk. There has to be something that you could identify with. And if you didn't get it yet, aim to it &gt;&gt; because I'm saying to you, you can't just sit there and wala wala and die &gt;&gt; cuz you're going to die in your sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, so let's move on. So these people behave like that and they don't really want to lie. They don't want to lust. There's another big one. And you have a lot of big old men in the message are lusting. Now I am a different preacher to brother to you. I just tell you black is not white. I mean not that he wouldn't tell you that but I I just go a little lower in Grenada. That's how we go. Go a little lower in Trinidad. Had to be careful because everybody's so knowledgeable and you know refined. In Grenada we in refined. All right. Now the Bible speaks of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, visiting Ahab, king of Israel, and they buckle up together and made an alliance with each other to go fight at Ramagillion. But this they did without first praying. That's why you get to have you got to have to ask if a certain thing is wrong alone. &gt;&gt; You do it as long as you are questioning it, leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Don't do it at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you know you are right because all things ought to be considered prayerfully. Then all other things will be added. If men and women could only get into the position where their soul and their thinking and their attitude will be perfect in the sight of God that would unleash one of the most powerful church in this hour. &gt;&gt; Because as I just preached in Grenada, I believe we are in a period of manifestation. Listen, there's no new message to come. You've been in the message for what? 40 years. You can't plant for 40 years. &gt;&gt; There's a time for planting. &gt;&gt; There's a time for growing and there's a time for reaping. &gt;&gt; And I believe we're in the hour where it is reaping. And people are being identified. When you see certain qualities coming out, that is their manifestation time because you can't be planting all the time and the word is a seed &gt;&gt; and seed is to grow. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there comes a time and remember there were two planters. &gt;&gt; There was the one that planted in the white and then the one that came in the back. He was in the black. &gt;&gt; They both planted &gt;&gt; and they both were growing. And he said, "Should I rip them up?" He said, "No, you going to pick up good fellas, leave them, let it grow together. Then at the end, I will send &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving it to you. I will send the angels and they will separate first the tears first the tears then I'll put the wheat in the Ghana but what am I doing with the chairs I'm buckling them are binding them and put them together there's a lot of madness going on in the message in Grenada where people gone back home &gt;&gt; they're serving God home the people are not doing communion anymore they're not doing feet washing anymore and many people stop Pay tithes. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; I hope you don't do that. &gt;&gt; A lot of people, oh God, they're doing suzu with God. If I pay this month, I'll pay next month. Oh, you could do that. &gt;&gt; Now, you see how you get quiet? &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not living here, so I can afford to tell you that. &gt;&gt; But tithe is a critical part of your experience. &gt;&gt; And he says, bring the first portion. &gt;&gt; You don't pay God last, you pay him first. Similarly, communion and feet washing. He says, "Do it until I come." &gt;&gt; So, how so many people gone home then they I heard in another place they shut down the church. &gt;&gt; In Africa, a lot of churches are shutting down. What does that tell you? Wake up. Smell the coffee. It burning. &gt;&gt; What does that tell you? Look here. 20 years ago, the place will be full. &gt;&gt; There's a sign. You need to wake up. Something is going on. We are in the village. We are in a place where there's going to be a shower. Where there's going to have a manifestation and it will be for the bride. &gt;&gt; For the bride, &gt;&gt; for those inside. [Applause] &gt;&gt; All that message have to go somewhere. Has to produce something. It can't go. He said it will not return void, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose. And when God purpose, there has to be a people. Behind the purpose, not some trees, not some animals, people. [Music] There has to be a body. There has to be a place. So if you're sick now is for a purpose so that you can get well. But you can't get well. doubting [Music] [Applause] those conditions come to drive us to God, pull us to God. We too complacent, be too relaxed. So situations come to drive you. Israel was driven in the wilderness. They didn't walk. They were driven. God's people are always driven by the spirit. Jesus was driven by the spirit in the wilderness. The spirit is in charge. &gt;&gt; God is loving. God is kind. God wouldn't give me a disease. &gt;&gt; But the enemy will drop one &gt;&gt; so that guy could go to God and say, "Look what he did. &gt;&gt; I want it off. I want to get rid of it." So he left a word for us. &gt;&gt; If you say &gt;&gt; not only that, whatsoever &gt;&gt; you desire, &gt;&gt; those things are for purpose. Those written words are for purpose. And there's a time for it to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; All word must be fulfilled. All word must be fulfilled. And you and I are what you call waiting prophecies &gt;&gt; to fulfill what he said &gt;&gt; on whom the ends of the world are come. &gt;&gt; When I was here Sunday enjoying the word, &gt;&gt; you know, I think about people that go to church and they sit there doing jury duty. collecting information, watching here, watching there. No. Amen. No. Praise the Lord. They're there like like juries. &gt;&gt; Am I do I agree with what he's saying? Do I agree with what he's saying? Well, I can't remember that. Where is that quote? &gt;&gt; I can't st Where's the quote? Where's the quote? It in the Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; If it in the Bible, then the courts are somewhere &gt;&gt; cuz the Bible is first then the courts. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham never lead us to the courts without the word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; All right, let me see if I listen. I'm trying to jump in place because I'm thinking about the time. But let's go. &gt;&gt; All right, so they they got together and they didn't pray. Now he says he could unleash one of the most pullful churches. Now they have I like this one. Brother Bham said they have a lie detector which is used to detect lies and you could get in there and try your best to make a lie. Sound like the truth. It will register negative all the time because the human was not made to lie. &gt;&gt; Lying is deceitful. It's a hard thing. It's an evil thing. I would rather have hear the prophet. I would rather have a drunkard &gt;&gt; with me any day than a liar. &gt;&gt; And the father of lies is who? &gt;&gt; So why you lying? &gt;&gt; Why do we lie? &gt;&gt; Now I know you're feeling uncomfortable, but if you lie, you're not to worry. &gt;&gt; Only worry when it's when it's true. No matter how sinful you are, you are still a fallen son of God. God did not intend for you to be sinful. He wanted you to be a son of daughter of his. You were made in his own image. And yes, his spirit is in you. But sin calls you to do these things. And no matter how much you try to impersonate and make a lie seem right, the detector will prove it wrong. Even if you tell the lie with all the innocence you got, it will still register negative. Imagine you're telling a lie and you're innocent. &gt;&gt; It sound like a oxymoron or or one of those words that you have a double meaning, but the prophet says with all the innocence yet is a lie. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I have seen that happen where people make confession with the best words. They put it together and it sound right but it was a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And only God could pick that up. &gt;&gt; Now let's move on. So he says he said because God put in your subconscious down in the human being and it knows what is true. It's better than the lie detector machine. It does not need springs and wires all over your body. It's already wired by God to your heart. And while man may be able to fool a lie detector machine with a lot of practice, the subconscious dong in you set up by God cannot be fooled. It will detect a lie and register it up your subconscious. What am I getting at? When you tell God you believe &gt;&gt; and you really don't &gt;&gt; in pray &gt;&gt; if you didn't reach there yet said God I ain't reach yet help me to reach there like what the guy did. Lord I believe help me in my unbelief. &gt;&gt; So you can't pray a miss neither can you pray a lie. &gt;&gt; God know your heart. So if you're dumb right down, say, "Lord, I'm dumb right down." &gt;&gt; And that's why our prayers are not answered &gt;&gt; because we are not truthful. And God hates lies. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now remember, I tell you, I from Grenada, we different. We down in the ground. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. So where am I now? So he says, "Now just think if a man or woman could ever get their thoughts." Sorry. Yeah. And their confession and their lives so line up with God until the channel of the Holy Ghost will be perfectly one with God. Imagine all those things that look impossible. It now becomes possible to them that believe. Why it's so line up where the freedom from their heart and faith from the inner man connects and you have a what an explosion of miracles and signs and wonders. Oh, we want we want to do miracles and we want signs and wonders with what that you have to get the training &gt;&gt; in prayer where God realizes that you know you nothing. Do you know why a lot of men in this message are not what you call uh prophets and doing miracles? God entrust them. &gt;&gt; Big egos. &gt;&gt; Why you think we have so many churches? Egos. &gt;&gt; Everybody want to be high. When when when Joshua died, you know what was the problem in Israel? Who in charge next? &gt;&gt; I heard brother Tio saying we had to die. And that is not a game &gt;&gt; because you might be saying, "Amen." But when it come to your thing, leave the thing alone. &gt;&gt; But the Bible tell us live for others, &gt;&gt; not for ourselves. &gt;&gt; I heard brother Isaac say that and that was powerful. &gt;&gt; Some of you old and will die alone &gt;&gt; because we only studying ourselves. There comes a time when even the money can't help you &gt;&gt; cuz you're so, you know, you're so obnoxious and you're so funny and stuck in your ways that nobody me don't want nobody live with me. You see me I funny funny and you a Christian and you don't even want nobody to come man go in the home then you fall sick and who you calling for brother one of them brothers see if they could come and stay with me for the night or one of them sisters one of them young one &gt;&gt; now you want help &gt;&gt; if you was living Right. They come without you asking for it. And that's why I love what he said because too much nonsense going on and re really true. I you know I came I was fellowship my brother and I you know I'm an observer. I like to observe things. All right. And I observe a lot of times I I say not much but I'm observing. And when I hear some of the stories in this message and what going on I don't want to know the rest. I don't want to know the rest. I ain't bright at dun. And if I get to know the rest, you're going interfere with my faith and my prayer. I want to pray free. &gt;&gt; I like to be free in my prayer. All this thing and this one did that and my God and wife and husband married together and husband saying I love you honey and you have another girl outside too light. The light to her and the lighter that one. &gt;&gt; Two light by one man. And did honey saying, "Well, yes, darling, I love you." And she making eye in the office. &gt;&gt; That right, brother Brandham. Trust some of them sisters in the office. They can't take pressure. &gt;&gt; Soon as they get, you know, you're a really pretty girl, you're nice. Wow. And that just gone. &gt;&gt; Where where is your feet? Where is the word? Where is your connection with God? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? We need to go back. &gt;&gt; Husband and wife living like beasts &gt;&gt; home and like angels &gt;&gt; here. God bless. And you say, "Boy, them looking nice." And you now want to when I I want to be like them. &gt;&gt; You know what going on? You know what going on? Do you know razor bleeding cutting home is worse? And a lot of people you think in love, not in love, they in trouble. &gt;&gt; We need to get back to the word. Get back to our relationship with God. Get back to holiness. Get back to where it makes sense. &gt;&gt; Why? Why all that drama? You know, no profit in it. &gt;&gt; I mean, come on. You don't have a short life already. You're making it worse by having an enemy in your house and eating her food. You crazy. &gt;&gt; Now he's taking chances and the devil already telling them thing. &gt;&gt; You're taking that, you learned that pass. But I'm telling you and a lot of us, you know, we act like if all is well. Some of us ain't even sleeping. &gt;&gt; Anxious worries and you're saved. You and God have a connection. Paul says these things don't move me. &gt;&gt; Lying vanities. &gt;&gt; I heard brother Terry voice. Is he here? &gt;&gt; Man, I was behind him Sunday. I have a little time, but I had to say this. And I was enjoying myself. I didn't know the brother could have dance. That brother had me going. I don't I can't do it. But he was dancing for me. &gt;&gt; I love him. Praise God. God open that eye. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. Amen. This God I serve can do anything. &gt;&gt; It's just that we limit him by not being genuine. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, help me. I'm going. Let me keep going. Just think if a man or woman could get their thoughts and their confession. You hear it? Thoughts and confession line up &gt;&gt; with the word. You can't be saying one thing in your confession, saying another thing in your prayer and your thoughts &gt;&gt; another place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The world better than us. &gt;&gt; Because we supposed to be having more wisdom, &gt;&gt; but we letting the devil mess us up. &gt;&gt; Stop the double life. &gt;&gt; Live true. Live right. Live according to the word. And if you can't live it, say, "Brother Tio, I need help." &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's a deacon, trustee, or whatever um position you have in the church. Position have nothing to do with demons. &gt;&gt; And demons are very smart. They stay hide and they quiet and they don't make trouble until you're alone. &gt;&gt; You think a devil going to come and you come to church and wake up and make you behave on the way? No. die for when you get home. Die when you're home with him. &gt;&gt; You're only fooling yourself when you come to church and you're not in it. &gt;&gt; I hear them men preaching. Those brothers here preaching, you should be glad you have a man of God like that. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And don't you know, anyhow, let's move on. So many people come to the altar to be prayed for with intellectual faith and claim to have confessed their sins and they believe it in their mind. They believe it because they heard it. They believe it because they know it the best policy. But somehow they seem to miss the mark. And I'm saying to you, this is something I found out and I found it in my church where people are telling me one thing and living another. And it's not that they want to do that, they can't help it. &gt;&gt; And you say, breth, why? Because they were not fully surrendered. If you're not fully surrendered, God ain't come in and give you everything. &gt;&gt; You get what you give. &gt;&gt; You want a quart of God, you get it. &gt;&gt; He walk with you with what you give him. &gt;&gt; You remember the the message brother Brennon preached with the woman with the alabaster box of plate. You you you get what you give and then we just blame the message and blame this and I find I ain't seeing God and I ain't seeing God. How you going to see God when you're blind? You ever see a blind man see? &gt;&gt; Blind as a bat and you want to see God and you seeing this and you seen signs. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to see signs if you're on God and connected. &gt;&gt; If I didn't seen signs, you think I've been in the message? The message holds me. &gt;&gt; I don't hold it. God holds me. &gt;&gt; I don't hold him. &gt;&gt; Some people say, you know, they come to God and say, "Boy, I just hope and pray that all goes well." I ain't saying that. &gt;&gt; Hear what I saying. &gt;&gt; If the world is so attractive that the enemy trying to pull me back, I dead first &gt;&gt; by my feet. &gt;&gt; You can't say that. Just so you know cuz as you say death you start to trembling and you start to do all kind of thing. But I am so serious about my faith that I would die than go back. &gt;&gt; When you have an experience with God you think you will go back. &gt;&gt; That's what you need and it's real. If I could get it, if a nothing like me could get, what's stopping you? &gt;&gt; We need to come off our high horse. Come down that horse, get a donkey or something and and get you change ways. &gt;&gt; Remember, there's mental faith and supernatural faith. Both cometh by hearing. &gt;&gt; Both cometh by hearing. But the key is hearing who? Cuz remember Wild Brother preaching, the devil preaching to him. &gt;&gt; That is why a lot of people just be watching him so &gt;&gt; under their glasses, &gt;&gt; wondering what he mean by that. &gt;&gt; And I told him already his voice louder than mine. I love that. The devil can't take noise. He just get confused. &gt;&gt; So we're keep blasting it here. Don't ease up at all. cuz them devils and them in feeling sorry for you. &gt;&gt; Nobody, let me tell you, the harder I preach home is the closer them people get, the tighter they believe. If I go there, listen, if I come by you and I I giving you baby food, a big old 25y old man and I say, "Okay, try and take this here. Here is some conflicts." And I giving you conflicts with a spoon. There's a conflict. What you behave like? You won't be say you act like a child cuz I treat you like a child. &gt;&gt; But if I throw the conflicts and I say eat some cuckoo &gt;&gt; and dashing and fig and them thing that is hurt teeth, &gt;&gt; what you think got them teeth for? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So you that's why brother Brennham you ever hear brother Brennham preach a easy message &gt;&gt; you ever listen to him I don't stop my tape all during the night I have him playing when I wake up I hearing him when I go to sleep I hearing him &gt;&gt; that's my life &gt;&gt; and I talk it live it &gt;&gt; some of you as soon as church done you done &gt;&gt; anyhow let me keep going because you're pulling me off all your &gt;&gt; all you behave yourself In most cases outside in our head is a knowledge of God. But inside the heart is a demon &gt;&gt; doubting. &gt;&gt; Listen good. &gt;&gt; Listen good. &gt;&gt; You have a knowledge. Everybody have a knowledge. You have a Bible. You read it 15 times. What has it done for you? &gt;&gt; And in in Trinidad, everybody know the message. They've been in the message even when the message was still coming. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't have that that thing. I It's so much of us in Grenada. Maybe I were three or four. You used to be 60 going down to about two now. &gt;&gt; As the time going, people just in getting they just tired. And you'll see it here when people just get tired. Why? Their faith run out of gas. &gt;&gt; Their faith tired. &gt;&gt; How much of you struggling with coming to church and you're coming up say, "Oh god, the arthritis." What arthritis? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you had arthritis, you'll still be in bed. &gt;&gt; What arthritis? When you come into church, you want to hear about God. And if you know God, you running up the step. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; All right, let me keep going. So I believe divine healing is real, but it is not for me or how can I get it if the doctor says this or the doctor says that. So outside you admit it but inside your conscience quietly register. I know. Well, let me have some secret for you. If you sick bad and you need deliverance and you don't give God everything, you go dead. &gt;&gt; Try and get accustomed to us in Grenada die. Stop &gt;&gt; and you don't want to die. So you have no choice. Hear me. You have no choice but to live. Let me tell you a secret. People who say they committing suicide, you know how to find out if it's true? Bring them in the ocean and let them go. &gt;&gt; Throw them overboard. The mount of noise and the mount of balling and the mount of swimming. I thought you don't want to death. Not that they want a rope that you could just quit but to be swimming where you have to make an effort. I thought you don't want to dead. Try it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People just talk. &gt;&gt; But when reality come, &gt;&gt; it's a different story. Hear what God says. Love your enemies. &gt;&gt; You you you have enemies. &gt;&gt; And there are Christians say, "I have no enemies, but you talking to that one, you passing by them." And you make sure when you see them, you bounce. How many times you see a sister coming and you're just gone in a sto &gt;&gt; and as she gone you just back out and you're walking past &gt;&gt; you get the picture yet you will tell people you're not no enemy. Why? Because I the right thing to say &gt;&gt; in reality &gt;&gt; not true. &gt;&gt; Not true. &gt;&gt; And you see me I can't handle fake. &gt;&gt; I hate fake. I believe in reality &gt;&gt; and that's why if you have a problem you and wife you think and you all have a problem go and pray if too all you can't pray together because the tension so great come and say we in trouble &gt;&gt; and then many don't want to come to Braio because we don't want to know as if he know you think he will tell you everything &gt;&gt; you think God will have a pastor that don't know what going on with the people &gt;&gt; I mean I shouldn't tell you that because I pastor secrets but the holy The spirit doesn't reveal things. &gt;&gt; So the best way to do is don't hide. &gt;&gt; I hate hiding. &gt;&gt; Expose the devil. &gt;&gt; And what I'm telling you going all over you think you say in Trinidad your you have marriage doing fine. All marriage under pressure right now. &gt;&gt; Right now the most common thing is divorce. Divorce. Divorce. It's like a song. It's like a pandemic. &gt;&gt; Why? Satan has invaded. Satan know his time is up. So he's making a a quick short work. Why? Because he heard God is making a quick short work. And he's a full fashion. He's an imitator. Everything God does, he comes up with a plan for it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And God help you. If you have too much knowledge, &gt;&gt; he can't help you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And a lot of times people don't want to change. They so fix in their ways. &gt;&gt; Right now some of you switch off. I don't reach 60 already. Me can't change now. You might think hell nice. There we go. So hear this. Oh, if I can get it. The doctor says this or that. So outside you admit, but inside your conscience says no. Mark 11:20. So faith is a staggering thing to many people and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves to confess that we don't have faith in God. Brother Bren, I'm saying that not me. &gt;&gt; We don't have to. I prove that. &gt;&gt; Go when the hour come to prove it. We running. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We going somewhere else. I'm talking to you. Put your mind in there. &gt;&gt; Your mind somewhere else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, brother um the prophet says an experience. So, you have faith in God. Usually people with faith are people who have experience and experience only comes by a life &gt;&gt; and I say a life of prayer and communication between you and God. Experience bring faith. Hence Jesus said in John 3, except a man be born again. You know what born again means? &gt;&gt; All right. Don't do like Nicodemus. He cannot understand the kingdom of God. He what that means he cannot see. &gt;&gt; See what what the word says what the word means. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you know many time Jesus tell the disciples thing and they say they believe and then later on he had to pray them for their hardness of heart. It's not we the first one it happened. It happened ever since time memorial. His disciples did not believe he rose. &gt;&gt; So don't feel bad. What we had to do is break it. What we had to do is defeat it &gt;&gt; because you've been given the tools. [Applause] Don't come every day and get the tools and put it in your bag and pack it up. &gt;&gt; Use it. &gt;&gt; What is the problem with the church? Lack of faith, lack of experience, lack of prayer. Why? You do it for me. &gt;&gt; We like old Roman Catholics. &gt;&gt; We leave the church, but we didn't leave the doctrine. I can't do God for you. &gt;&gt; You ought to do God for yourself. &gt;&gt; Oh, I find time to pray, but you can't. My you ready yet? &gt;&gt; Hello. Is only one Mary. Haven't you gone? &gt;&gt; Let me move on. So the word says, see, it means to understand, not to look with your eyes. So being born again is connected to understanding what you hear. &gt;&gt; And the word of God says faith cometh by hearing. Let me tell you, if we really were taking all the word we receiving, the rapture gone already. Some of us have been doubting the rapture. Why you think God being merciful, not willing that any should perish, but giving you an opportunity, giving you another chance? Because he knows what is in man. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He knows what is in us. He know how we up and down. &gt;&gt; Up and down the deck. We only moving up and down. Stay. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Up and down the deck. We can't sit down and we can't settle. &gt;&gt; When you believe something, stay with it. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, don't come for prayer. &gt;&gt; If you believe God could heal you, stay with it. And let me tell you, healing is not miracles. &gt;&gt; Healing is something that takes a process. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God want you to get stronger when it is gone. &gt;&gt; Are you understanding that? So, there are things your body need. When he healed the girl, you say, "Give her some food or give her some water or give her something." Because why? That was connected to her going. &gt;&gt; So you lose nutrients, you lose things. So when you recover, so when you recovering, God is the person is the one that's bringing your recovery, that's bringing your healing. But you have to stay with it. &gt;&gt; Why do I stay with it, brother Tim? Because God said, "No, you &gt;&gt; you Why we don't believe?" Because we figure he's weak to do the work. You can't help God. &gt;&gt; You can't even know what going on in the next 15 minutes you could help God. &gt;&gt; So leave the healing to him. Leave the work to him. God said it. I believe it. That settles it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; So that's why he said, "He that have to hear, &gt;&gt; let him hear." Not all who have. He that have not this thy lobe &gt;&gt; the air is in the heart &gt;&gt; cuz the heart have ears to hear the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look all this exercise we've been having spiritually. What have we learned spiritually? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We still day in the in the world of touch, taste, smell, and feel. &gt;&gt; Trust God. &gt;&gt; The Lord say, "Love your enemies. do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you. Pray for them. Give them a gift. &gt;&gt; I was at work one time and the young lady who I working with and we were talking and then she talk about something. I said well I'm a Christian I to you and she get mad. I shouldn't tell her that. So she tell me get off her office. I say come and move me teasing her because me can't fight and she get mad and she and she say all kind of thing. I leave and I go in tongue and I buy a card and a cup about God's blessing and wonderfulness. We best friends now because I can't carry I can't carry grudge. You know how heavy that is. &gt;&gt; Do you know how heavy that is? That would just Why you think just bring up your pressure &gt;&gt; besides normal thing in the body? Hey, and that's something I had to talk about. You're taking pressure tablets and you suffer you go down. Where you going? So who fooling who? I mean I can't even trust the doctor. And you tell him I make sure I take it &gt;&gt; and God tell me whatsoever &gt;&gt; I desire. What desire means? Having a strong feeling. We only have strong feeling when we when something gets serious. &gt;&gt; But if you have a strong desire and you go and pray, &gt;&gt; you expect to get results. But where is the secret, brother Tim? Because I had to cut short. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you where the secret is. We go and pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Forgetting the ought that we had against our brother because he said when you stand praying, &gt;&gt; you got to connect the verses. &gt;&gt; When you stand praying, forgive. &gt;&gt; That is connected to when you have a desire. &gt;&gt; So when you have a desire and you forgive, then you could believe so that you can receive. So don't expect to get nothing from God and you and your brother ain't talking and you breaking word. &gt;&gt; You got to make it right. &gt;&gt; That is a secret. &gt;&gt; God is holy. &gt;&gt; God willing to heal you more than you want to get healed. But he cannot handle sin. &gt;&gt; And what is iniquity? &gt;&gt; What you know you shouldn't do and you're doing it. If you have ought means grievance, complaints, offense, issues, &gt;&gt; fix it. &gt;&gt; A lot of people are dying today because they have grievian. Yes. When I came to the Lord, I has to find everybody and fix it. &gt;&gt; I cannot knock about. I imagine my best friend. Oh, God. Confession is good. I had to go and tell him, "Boy, I was interfering the wife." And I don't want to tell him, &gt;&gt; "You think I could be preaching now if I fix that?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or you to make that look as if, well, you know, he's betraying me and God. That is a lie. &gt;&gt; So I didn't tell him I sorry cuz when I was out there, the devil was trying to destroy me. &gt;&gt; I didn't know that. &gt;&gt; I thought I was blue boy. Any I know you had to go to work, but I here to tell you this. If you fix the and you believe, what's the next thing? You will receive. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Bow your heads and pray. And if you have anything that you need to fix when the service is over, fix it. If you've been not doing your sacraments that the word says, then fix it. But may God help us so that we could rise from here. I heard your pastor saying, "We expecting great things." Great things don't come unless we fix small things. &gt;&gt; So, let's fix it. Let's make it right. &gt;&gt; Let's deal with God as a holy person, not something that God is a spirit &gt;&gt; and they that dealing with him must deal with him in spirit and in truth. If that is your desire, you stand to your feet and say, "Bim, I need prayer." That God will deliver me from doubts, from unbelief, and that God will help me going forward to be victorious. And if you mean it, you will receive it. &gt;&gt; Father God, I thank you for the little time we have. It flies so fast. But I pray that you will help the people as you have helped me and help them to see the significance of prayer, the significance of making things right, the significance of confession with truth and the significance of believing you. Then miracles will happen, things will take place cuz we overthrew for these moves of God. So we bring those things and we say Lord these things you said we will receive them. Give them mercy's journey as they go. And me too, Lord. And bless this tabernacle as you have been doing. And continue to anoint your brothers, the brothers here and sisters and the people and draw them closer to you. Bless the word and bring it. Let it bring forth fruit cuz it cannot return void is my prayer in Jesus name. God bless you. I love you. Until we meet again. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. Let's give him praise tonight.
