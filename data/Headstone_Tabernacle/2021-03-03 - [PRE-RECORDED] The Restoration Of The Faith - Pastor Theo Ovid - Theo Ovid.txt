greatest vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever seen what you dream about what you're taught about your family being delivered your loved ones being restored oh what you had in the heart your heart's desire god is about to fulfill it your cup gonna run over your cup's gonna run over you're gonna have joy you're gonna have peace you're gonna have a fire revival in your soul do you believe that tonight oh hallelujah oh praise the name of the lord i'm burning tonight let me see i'm burning hallelujah i'm burning tonight my soul is on fire my hands is on fire my feet is on fire there's fire in god i became the drink last night fire fire could burn the drinking desire out of you tonight i don't even do drugs yesterday fire fire cleansing fire holy fire purifying fire about god is a consuming fire oh he transforms he changes oh hallelujah oh glory to god oh glory to god hallelujah i don't believe in fixing anyone in concrete i don't believe in that sense of permanence that people have to stay as they are i always believe once there is hope once there is possibility and i'll tell you why there was a man in abraham you may be he was all man he couldn't have any children his wife was barren and the bible said against hope he believed in hope when there was no hope when the doctor would have turned his back on that man the bible said he believed god that's the difference when you come to the spot when everything seems to be failing along you and you choose to believe god for your deliverance to believe god for your healing to believe god for your breakthrough to believe god for your revival my god i see all people god get revived i see all eagles come back young again i will give a up i will give in a wheelchair tonight god is able to raise you up i'm here to declare tonight that he's the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] you might be seated what you what you've seen is the effect of inspiration rain [Applause] you hear what i said it have teaching rain and it have inspiration rain inspiration rain is when the ancient come to give the man of god the words to speak to the people of god you know who you are you are god's people you have to hear words from him tonight you didn't come to hear from man you come to see a dead man you come to see a man get out of the way and to see the holy ghost take a hold of a man make him walk where he didn't take he was going to walk make him say what he didn't think he will say that's when you could see god speaking to your life what you're about to witness the message we have not seen hallelujah i want to say it again what you about to witness the message world has not seen we are now about to break into our season now listen carefully you won't be seated before we before we read the scripture jesus from age 12 to 30 on the silence under the teaching of the word no manifestation under the ministry of the word learning the scriptures he came to the spot where he was led by the spirit into the temple that day and jesus said season change because the spirit is now upon me and when the spirit comes upon you that is to fulfill your scripture i'm not hearing you i am not hearing you i'm not hearing you after 40 plus years of the ministry of the word of all the teachings of all the scripture i am prophesying the spirit has to come upon you i want to hear a bigger shout than that do you believe that tonight don't even say it you're not worthy don't even say you did this or you did that i am not talking about what you have done i am talking about what the spirit is about to do and the spirit is about to come [Music] upon you [Music] you might be seated but some of you may be not getting it when the spirit came upon samson he took a little a jawbone and peter a thousand men with helmet when the spirit come you ever hear when the spirit of the lord come upon my heart i will dance like david pants you understand when the spirit come what the spirit does the spirit doesn't come to try to explain this explain that when the season has come it's time for manifestation it's time for vindication time for confirmation time for your prayer to be answered we're going to read the scripture in a few minutes you may be seated 400 years living under prophecy deliverer coming deliver coming they can open scripture and show the people god said so god said so but when the spirit came long and god came down and he said i come now to deliver it was no prophecy now it was he is here present tense to do what is promised to do what he said oh glory to god if you know what god said to you this should be the most exciting time of your life if that devil tell you a big boo before you came inside of here you're gonna leave here and tell him a bigger boo when you get out of here because god is about to confirm the word in your life let's all stand [Applause] we want to turn to malachi chapter 4 and joy chapter 2. oh malachi 4 5-6 says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadfully of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers these i come and smite the earth with a curse and from joel chapter 2 we want to read hallelujah glory uh fear not to land be glad and rejoice for the lord will do great things be not afraid the beast of the field for the passage of the wilderness through spring for the tree buried of fruit the fig tree and the vine to give their strength be glad then eat children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for you are given to you the four marine moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the flow shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and i'll restore to you the years the lucas had eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the palmer world my great army which i sent among you and you shall eaten plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that i death wonderly with you and my people shall never be ashamed and he shall know that i am in the midst of israel that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterwards that i will pour my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your own men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon my handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit and i will show wonders in the heavens and the earth blood and fire pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness the moon in the blood before the great and terrible day of the lord let us pray father we thank you that you have promises for the bride elect before the great and terrible day of the lord father may you come down tonight and begin to manifest your promises pour out your spirit upon your people we are needy and we are wait upon you in jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated praise god we'll have a title the restoration of defeat another inspiration the promise holy ghost baptism to the bride oh blessed be the name of the lord the promised holy ghost baptism to the bride nobody branham brought one message one inspiration and we are all in it it is an inspiration of seven seas and seven thunders to prepare the people to leave this earth to prepare people to get the extra oil to get ready to be as the wise virgins do you believe that now there can be no real faith without manifestation because works is faith expressed so when we speak about restoration of the faith it cannot be without manifestation because works is evidence of faith if you have faith you will have a manifestation to express the faith that you see that you have isn't that right and the prophet said there have been no manifestation of god to stir the bride so what he is saying is that fate has to come forward to produce a manifestation of god and that manifestation is what will awake stir excite inside the bride in our words it can't be revelation only teaching only it's got to be power and demonstration of the spirit so when we talk about the restoration of the faith we are speaking about the restoration of power with signs wonders and miracles that is what we are talking about could we give the lord a shout of praise and there have been an absence in this message of that power but joel said i am gonna restore i'm not telling you tonight all the years that it was absent all the years you didn't see it and taste it and experience it i am going to restore and my people shall be satisfied my people they're gonna praise me my people shall not be ashamed oh hallelujah are you with me tonight what is he saying you're redeemed from your sin from your past from your failures from your mistakes you'll be justified always feeling condemned god promised to apply blood upon your life god promised to look at you as if you never did it never did it god promised to justify you not just forgive you come on help me somebody help me somebody i'm getting excited now i'm not talking about forgiveness i am talking about justification as if you never did it you can't sit there and believe that you gotta shout you gotta rejoice my people my people he separated from other people he said my people my very own people the call by my name my people mrs jesus come on oh glory give the lord a shout my people you know who you are when you hear my people you better say hey man you better shout like how john shout i like how goddess talk i call you by name before your mother conceive you before your mother had you i ordain you to be a prophet into the nation before she even knows you're pregnant ordering the seed to come forth nothing will stop the mystery of who you are from unfolding so therefore what about him said there will be no manifestation of god to steal the bride it will take those seven thunders to produce it to produce what to produce a manifestation not revelation only but a manifestation of god to stir the bride because you are not really bright yet until you come into an experience with your mate your husband with charity with the holy ghost is only then you get connected with your husband his wife had made herself ready so god want to contact you god want to touch you god want to connect with you oh hallelujah oh glory do you believe that so you must have an experience with the person of the holy ghost isn't that right the person of christ so the calling out time which we have had for 50 plus years of teaching and revelation is about to change the season is going to change right before your eyes the time of the ministry of the spirit the supernatural and omnipotent speaking even sin being called out it will be changed right in front of your eye power is coming to block out the spirit of man you see when peter james and john saw jesus with that glory around him they said let us make three tabernacles and the power shut them up the power said shut up hear him don't come with the humanistic tort don't try to build no tabernacle to make no man no glory at the end of it christ only christ only jesus only not even fightful not pastor and and prophet no jesus only when they looked there was only jesus no moses no elijah no jesus only have to come back to jesus only got to come back to jesus only hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever it's a power i believe that the time has come for the power of god to follow the word the power is going to change you there's got to come a resurrection power among the bride isn't that right and the first thing that power going to lead you to is to the cross where you are crucified with christ or give the lord some praises oh hallelujah hallelujah not not power to show off not power to say i am right you are wrong no power to die oh glory to god because that is where jesus conquered jesus didn't conquer caste no devil he didn't conquer racism healing the sick that was the easy part the path that he conquered is when it looked like nothing happened when he's on the cross when he says finish [Applause] oh hallelujah it didn't look dramatic it was painful but it was there he conquered in suffering and crucifixion in price being paid friends this gospel has to become real if christ suffered so much we if he went through we got to go through also you you just have to bless god to escape the terrible day of the lord but before that terrible they come a day of darkness grooviness a day of blackness a day that you wouldn't even want to think about before that they come he promised to send elijah the prophet and he had a job to do he is going to turn not the head of the people back to the faith of the fathers no not not the head he gonna turn the heart somebody's in heart yes i want heart god wants heart turn your heart that's the real you your heart from the abundance of the heart the mother speak when your heart and back you can only speak where your heart is at oh you have some powerful things to say tonight i said i serve him to you the holy ghost cannot behave in one man and misbehave in another because god behavior is his person so when god says he turn your heart back to the faith that's just what he means your heart not not you had to go to some church your heart you see the devil is fighting watch the rock of revelation to the individual [Applause] so what the devil introduced the people to to church and group so the people end up with group inc [Applause] but once you catch that the father in heaven he alone is the revealer then that frees you from church group think group revelation group interpretation men's ideas then you would realize god will have young sons older sons and different kind of sons no it's his sons in other words a son of god serving god for the last 30 years is same as a son just came in five minutes ago somebody drunk just gave the heart to the lord three minutes ago they are just as much sun as somebody 40 years coming to church you see the problem is your humanistic realm where you see in whom spiritual who more holy whom are righteous but when god brings binoculars he said all have sinned [Applause] and if you are sin you're born in it in other words you're born in it you do it so stop playing righteous we will expose you tonight because there is none righteous no not one shake somebody on and tell them there has been righteous [Applause] oh you're gonna give the lord a shout no watch i was a catholic but my name was in the book i would leave my acolyte there's a little servant catholic but god called me the whole family stayed but god called me and i made a choice to give up my sins and repent and get baptized in jesus [Applause] name next year gonna be 40 years since i made that choice [Applause] and i'm feeling a feeling just as strong as when i first started out don't let the gray hair bother you because it's not bothering me i just so strong my soul on fire i'm on the expectation i am looking to dino are looking to start to live because jesus said i come that you might have life and have it more abundantly i want the abundant life i want god's joy amidst trying [Applause] circumstances so all of you [Applause] who want to express your dose of tiredness because you're waiting long cut it out because he come now according to first thessalonians 4 the lord himself already come down i have news for you shocking news oh shocking news yes you see brother branham says the seven angels come from eternity to gather up the scattered word to tie it back into the word to bring down the holy ghost so they brought down the holy ghost but we wasn't ready yet for the holy ghost in that measure so the holy ghost came down as the word because jesus said the words that i speak they are spirit and they are life so god take his spirit and hide it as the word which is the revelation of the son of man the sower of the seed so we adore us to live under the anointing of the ministry of the world to be seated on because the holy ghost have to fall in such a way upon planted word that it will restore god will be the restoration of the faith watch this how could the fair be restored and we can't do what peter did [Music] peter didn't have seven seals seven church ages all the mysteries but he had defeat you see the faith is christ the holy ghost in you the person not just the baptism but the added life so that is why peter could say silver and gold have lying on i have something and i could release it i have it i could give it he actually had the germ of god [Applause] resident in him and because the germ was in him he could speak for other sons [Applause] and bring them into manifestation what adam was supposed to do adam was to bring representatives like him but when man fell it went into the sex way instead of spoken word which was word and spirit so when jesus came his first message was you must be born again of word and spirit amen so it had to bring back word in order for you to get back to spirit but the word was lost so causing a prophet to restore the word that was lost so we could come back to word and spirit so before the appointed time comes he had was to have the call in all time which you're in right now so even though people want to cut people off and top people off god's still calling whosoever will come come quickly spirit in the right say come come come take the word come hold the ticket come on the ticket is the token the ticket is the word when you buy a bus ticket the doc the conductor don't want to see your money he want to see the ticket if you don't have a ticket he said go on by go and get some oil and then come back [Applause] the bus is ready to go everybody's in line have a ticket you have your money you can have a million dollars he is authorized only to take the ticket you said conduct a whole hundred dollar bill he said no ticket where do you get it you have to go to the county and buy it and why they went to buy the bus takeoff [Applause] don't be caught like that you want your ticket your ticket is evidence you pay a price [Music] i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you so when you see a man with the power of god you know that man paid a price [Applause] are you with me amen remember christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it that's prophecy what preacher are you going to be giving me the church yes that's where satan visit him he's not visiting the paniade and the al-qaeda tends no he fills in the church to defile it why because he understand that if we get things in order the power of god going to be here to destroy his works his imps and his demons so he want to affect and inflict and mess up the church to affect the power from flowing freely in other words nobody's supposed to walk in here sick and stay sick i want to declare that tonight i want to say a certain way tonight nobody should walk in this building sick and walk back out sick tonight we rejected that we are saying these signs shall follow damn god [Applause] believe you really expecting miracles tonight yes you expecting the supernatural tonight yes you're expecting the holy ghost fire to fall tonight yes why why because joel said it shall come to pass afterwards that i without asking the bishop permission i without consulting the minister's association i will pour out my spirit come on now come on now come on now [Applause] let me challenge your face a little bit when saul was messing up saul was king so it started off nice he's anointed he's inspired prophesying he's speaking as king and so he started to screw up and mess up god said enough of that go and anoint one of jesse's sounds king over israel that son called david he didn't ask for anointing he wasn't praying lord anoint me king lord i feel kingish lord could you make me a king david was only seen about sheep when god said anoint him that's god's business that's god's choice that i'm not if james was smoking tampi that i'm going to do with it [Music] do you understand what we're talking about god said anoint that man king [Applause] whether he is ready or not that i'm gonna do with it whether he's small then i'm gonna live with it whether he is short that hasn't been with it whether he is young that i'm not new with it it's the desire of god so when god is about to release your family you didn't hear me tonight when god is about to release you from the bondage of your sickness that is not your desire that's god's desire rejoice rejoice because god's desire is about to be revealed look let me see that look look look hannah baron hannah baron woman mocking her making mockery of her because she can't produce a child and she's in the temple grumbling groaning travailing she had a choice to be hateful she had a choice to be angry she had a choice to give them back good and make a good argument but she choose to bring a problem to god she chose to weep before god and god saw the groaning god saw the travailing and god said i'm not gonna just bless you i'm gonna bless you with a prophet i'm going to bless you with the man of god i've heard the groanings and the cries of my people you see god have to move up on your heart to break you out this shoe when you stick around the devil makes sure everybody have a toy to play with hallelujah a dolly a car time to fly games sports he know that man have different desires so he makes sure he have options galore to make sure you could pick and choose and imagine you could look around and say none of the above i choose god moses moses look away from all the glory of egypt he had opportunity to be pharaoh yeah opportunity to relieve them by his might of position but god go elgato glory for that seriously you know moses could come and say you know you know we'll release you i say until you go and don't have to go west but god will get no glory and god love and he deserves the glory that is why our sinners impress god and they set righteous he does embarrass them and humiliate them at one time jesus stand up there and watching people acting and behaving and so on and man come up and say lord you know i'll just do this i don't do that i'll do the other god i don't even make service i don't miss church and jesus is showing his disciples as a sample of what is going on in the human heart and next my name come close he says lord who merced upon me a sinner jesus righteous who you think got more impressed with the man who said i'm a sinner god love honesty god like a heart that can say lord that's my god jacob what's your name i am jacob i'm a trickster i'm a big scullery i'm a smart man ghost i like you now you tell somebody you're a smart man i don't want to do with you god say you you're so smart you got wonderful right you you you will do anything to get what is right and and that's the kind of man that i like a man that has passion you see a cold man he you know he's like neither here nor dear or you're going to poke a poke a man building a house and one nail today tomorrow what what what are you really building there's a bit of chair for you and he pointed wiki wiki forget and find him you want somebody with with zeal with passion with with fire that's the only way we could get things done you see fire have a certain point where there's breakout it has something called combustion to start the fire and i learned that if i have an ignition point a point is when they're gonna break out so when i see you smoke it's a fire yet it's only smoke you can smoke all the time you're smoky you're smoky we don't want smokey we need a wind to bring a breeze to blow to get you on fire we need you to be in oil one part in oil and the other part on fire [Applause] get that people out of your business hallelujah you're going one two one two one two and somebody going one two one two one two it can't be like that holy god one man on fire that's why you can't handle lukewarm is either hot or you're cold why god say that because if you're tall you're dead if you look if you're on fire you're on fire but lukewarm you need to call not dead that's a kind of sickening thing make yourself upset lukewarm god don't want to lukewarm praise it's better to praise god at all then we know you're dead then we can pray to raise the dead becoming the dead rays of the dead don't steer dead the dead have to move that the dead have to move the dead have to move you you can't be dead if you're not moving we know you're dead that's fine it have reason of the day too but when the dead raised you can't just stay like that no that creation of the dead get off your grave clothes you know be tied up with grave clothes get off your grave clothes all the old ways of the past when lazarus come forth lose him lose him lose him lose him and let him go loosen lose him i want the devil look at you and say pack up shot well empty mine says leave that woman alone lose him lose her loose you loose loose woman go out loose loose loose three three free free to praise god free to worship free to claim your healing free to be inspired lose them hallelujah you see the thing about it is this as humans we feel sorry assuming we want to extend ourselves and care in a certain way but god doesn't operate as a human does his eyes see it different and we have to go with the eyes of god that's why jesus always looking for the seeds looking for the sun look at his sons of zebedee with a fishing net and a business and he watch him always follow me how you will interpret that business knows at a boom you need your boys and this man with beard come and say follow me and the bible said they dropped their nets to follow a nomad a man who had no place no hotel no business no salary check the right door for them he said follow me and i will make you features of men and that's what the gospel is about fishing for men to understand that they are going to be sons so an ignorant man fisherman can't write his name can't read called by god to follow jesus jesus only mankind but jesus dropping promises upon him same works i do shall you do also if ye shall say to this monkey move on don't doubt you could have what you say jesus dropping promises by spoken word into their spirits into their soul and one time he released anointing upon them he said behold i give you power and my god is that a castle devil they come back rejoice and say lord that will have rejoiced rejoice our devils are subjecting ourselves to us he said don't rejoice for that rejoice because your names is written because he knew they don't have character yet he knew it's a taste of power to show them what is possible i want you to say a big evening on that because many preachers have a taste of power that god only show what is possible but he must have character and character is not a gift character is a victory you have to go through stuff you have to go through something so stop looking down i know because you failed and you're falling whatever forget that it's a good thing you fall you know how you fall and you don't have to fall again because god could empower you tonight the power of his word and upon that the power of his spirit don't tell me it can't happen because samson didn't have the holy ghost but the spirit came upon him i'm not hearing you and he did something when the spirit came upon him peter didn't have the holy ghost but he walked on water i'm not hearing you i'm not here with you i'm not hearing you even without the holy ghost he was in the supernatural jesus he said jesus if that is you beat me to come and jesus said come one word come [Music] what would make a normal man walk out a boat to walk like jesus i'm not hearing you jesus was walking on the water and jesus said if he says that you beat me to come just say come i ain't coming if you don't say come on if you say come are coming because i know you are the boss [Applause] that is when they could really trust god that's when they could really have faith in god and peter started to walk as he was watching jesus of course the devil gave fight because they've never seen potential and anytime the devastated potentially want to kill it so you whip up some waves and peter took his eyes off of jesus and looked on the waves and he began to sink in but you know what i love about him he say try to make backstroke confronts show that he's a small man and he wanted how he can look among the brethren he said lord i'm saying and i kind of like that no peter could swim he's a fisherman all fishermen could swim but peter wasn't taking no risk why take risks and jesus is there yeah yeah you could swim but jesus he could pull you up pull you out oh glory to god so we're talking about restoring the faith right one time she was in the boat he labored he preached and brown said rail or preaching services like two days hard labor jill was so tired he was in deep sleep storm rocking never seen opportunity sinking no you think the devil wouldn't sink you if you get a chance i'll give you something to shout about you know my angels fighting for you some of you some of you are stranded to say amen on that you know we're gonna need spirit round the angel out and camp around those that [Applause] you know what accidents the lord protect you from you know situations god breaks you from you have nothing to do with that hallelujah hallelujah understand this is forces from above and faster than below and you are in between and the god has to fight for you [Applause] when you think it's bad it could have been worse jesus in the boat he's tired devil kicked with a storm the boat is rocking after a while the disciples recognized they cannot handle it on their own let's wake jesus wake him he's sleeping he's not dead he's only sleeping he's only in the silence he's not dead he's only sleeping there with jesus jesus got up rebuke the storm and say oh ye of little fate what is he saying brother general if you

right here and the faith is inside of you you got to know who you are that you are a son just like me i am the first born among many brethren so i want you to know that you have the potential to do what i did so he could tell them oh ye of little faith and then you've got to know who kicking up that storm because the bible said the winds were contrary and when sometimes the winds in your life it broke contrary you didn't ask for the wind you didn't do something and that's why the wind come you didn't zoo sin and the wind come sometime the winds just blow contrary but he's the god of the

angel stopped coming you've got to understand the angel is on his way when you begin to pray the angel is on his way when you pray keep on praying your deliverance is on its way your prayer to his honest will we are not just speaking words we are speaking life [Applause] what branham said remember seated when the church know what she is what she stands for and then she's that she can do the greater works how are we moving to that time now where we have the confidence our sons and our heart don't condemn us and we believe that the allah has come that god could trust us with something more you see it's not a matter of the church it's a matter of god trusting you to give you something more because when god see the kind of man you are he could call you aside and give you something that the world will know god is with you that's what the prophet said this is the age where god calling man aside understand this we are out of the church ages [Applause] the church ages set up systems of church like what we have here this is leftovers notice after the pentecost peter going here is not the church coming together and saying you know i mean what are we doing today are we moving no peter

corners house i'm gonna do with them it's vision and god it has nothing to do with any other man it is the spirit know what the whole creation is groaning for sons not church the devil takes the church god gets the brain the devil has fivefold matthew 24 24 force anointed he have his people second timothy had the high-minded lovers of pleasures of god god have his fivefold ephesians 4 he have his singular spirit second peter 147. faith put your knowledge temperance it is christ spirit versus everything else do you understand that tonight it's the end time battle will be this spirit here christ singular spirit versus everything else it's not three forces it's just two everything on earth is connected to just two god's power or the devil's power oh hallelujah let me drop this bomb on

the mirror she can't get on from the mirror the mirror looks the best mirror in the world because her face isn't it taken plenty selfies and so on you get out of that because you recognize jesus the beauty of jesus no on a name like him there's none like him and your beauty is only temporary check yourself out 45 years from now let's continue look at the lord some praises people give the lord some praise there's people oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god so all you have is the time to do what god wants you to do that's all we have because there's gonna come a midnight cry go you all to meet him the fate has to be restored in manifestation and demonstration who's going to preach it i'm going to preach it until it materializes i'm going to stay here until their signs until there is wonders until there is miracles until the cripples start to walk and the blinds start to see that's my job that's your job in the church of the living god tonight lays the power all that was in god he poured into christ all i was in christ he pours into the church i am convinced the word is in me the word isn't you but we want water [Applause] we want the rim may be seated but we have a prophecies for you tonight god told joelle it shall come to pass i will pour out the rain the former rain and the latin rain in the first month oh my god and your fats shall be overflow with oil and wine oh glory to god the it's going to overflow we talking about our overflow our overflow of spirit our overflow of power overflow of the anointing it's going to overflow [Applause] my jesus my my my god my god damn it said my cup run it over overflow press down running over when god pour you want to press it down and they're going to pour down upon you are you going to run over david got the oil running down aaron got that running down you got to get the oil running down your enemy's going to see it because he can repair a table for you and the presence of your enemies your enemy have to see it god will bring them out just in time to see it they have to see it because you are the son of god you are the daughter of god they have to see it give them a chance to laugh you may be seated give them a chance to laugh at your crippled condition at your sick condition blind by team i see you know the story he was begging every day and that day nobody on the street he wonder what what's happening i'm getting nobody to support me and then somebody said jesus is on the next street lord have mercy upon me he began to cry out not sick out not depress out not sad out because jesus is not there near him he began to cry out hearts cry out watch that crying out was a symbolism of the faith inside of him because jesus couldn't hear his cry literally but that faith in his soul hit heaven and heaven touched jesus and jesus couldn't help it he has to walk wherever fate is wherever faith is power is coming and seven thunders give fate and fate would lead us to power and power will take us to the promise to manifest the promise and the bible is the road map of god's power and faith must lead [Music] how many consulting that one [Applause] say it again over but iran said that the road map you may be seated is the bible and faith leads you to power and power lead you to the promise you see we're born in sin shape iniquity so we're born defeated so we have nothing to boast about our portion is in the blood our boast is in the cross because jesus come to die to redeem us and the word to redeem is to bring us back so he didn't come to do a halfway job i come to redeem them but i can't make no because things hot boy things really pressure no he released the redemption by releasing the book it was a book of redemption like if the book is sealed you don't know for sure you're there because your name is sealed up but once that book is unsealed you have the opportunity to connect listen to who you really are you taught it was a sinner you thought you was a baptist a methodist jew witness catholic you taught that but when the book opened then you recognize that you are son and daughter of god not of your mother and father your mother only father only gave you physical characteristics but you are the physical manifestation of the attribute that you are in god so god put a german you in the dust in your dust the devil can't see that germ because you don't have discernment of them of god i understand the bible said the word alone is the designer of the thoughts are the intents of the heart so the heart is uh no trespasses please for the devil and no trespass sign over your heart so the devil can come and trespass what god have as a hidden mystery inside of you which is the germ now because it's inside of you jesus could plainly say all that the father had given me will come [Applause] jesus is not in pain tonight oh god you surely will come no no no he is not in that all the father not no given me a heart given me past tense do not know see [Applause] you're getting a revelation of the blood that brought you but god put your germ in the book and when we preach the word we are preaching your name that is why you could shout at the world that is why you can get excited because when you hear the word yes you have your struggle in your flesh yes you have battles in your mind you're supposed to have the battle if you have no back for something wrong [Applause] so god allow the loose and spirit spirit to guide up the loose ends the spirit people that loose in their life you see because the foolish virgins are really free tinkers you know some people don't like discipline right don't like correction they want to do their own thing if they talk to them and correct them they get vex they don't like you say you like how you say it you like what you say they don't like this freethinkers but god have a pattern a same stress work with a pattern i simply can't just watch you and say okay you're looking like size 18. give me the clothes give my scissors let me go [Applause] you know don't go back there that is trouble somebody said okay just give me the clothes okay no measurement no pattern no nothing that's dangerous she could give you a sack and you're the entire rope wrong so so so you just don't do that well god have a pattern there it is so when god scissors come out god can say oh ho you don't like it so how do you like it god himself can't do that because i will make him not god he said i am god and i change not my pattern change not his faith first virtue second knowledge gain temperance gain patience then you know coming to godliness then you have to have forgiveness because faith is based on [Applause] no watch the devil know fate is based upon forgiveness because that's what being preached so his job is to make sure it have some solid odds and some concrete grudge long standing for years family feud for years and the devil tell them go to church but do not forgive at all same and say amen hallelujah say glory glory glory raise your hand raise your weight wait wait wait but when you go home don't forgive me because if you only forgive me god will come down i can't afford that [Applause] so you have church wars this past against that pastor disbeliever against a believer husband fighting with wife why fighting with children dog fighting with cat everybody fighting no forgiveness because once forgiveness start to be effective you put yourself in a position to be like god because he smiles on the just and on the unjust and the rain just falls on the tomato tree and the marijuana tree righteous today i am falling on no marijuana no ganja crop only corn tomatoes and melon and watermelon what the farmers like i could move that way the rain don't talk that way the ruins just fall and every seed brings forth after its kind and if there is a son of god's seed sown in your heart and that rainfall it's got to bring forth after it's came a god king a godly king a kind of holy king a righteous kind every seed bring forth so let the devil do his do we got to do our do oh hallelujah i'm telling you maybe see that let me drop this on you it will come to a spot you can't help it you can't help manifest god you you can't help heal the sick you you can't help speak the word you can't have walk by the spirit you can't walk you can't help being led by the spirit that is just how you are that is just what you do that is just how you live you live by the spirit you talk by the spirit you walk by faith you talk by faith you preach by faith you testify by faith you live by that faith but abandoned walking the conventions already in five minutes the holy spirit started to move and people started to walk out the wheelchair he didn't have to preach he just walked and the angel walking with him are we going to return to that yes sir we call it the return to the days of the apostles oh god they're going to be apostles comfort power comfort man of god comfort like you have never seen before the pentecostal will be astonished oh hallelujah this world gonna be astonished when the power of god become activated in the sons of god right now god preparing the cell phone oh hallelujah the sim card is already in it's just waiting to be activated everything is order it's the latest version it's not the seventh age it's the bright age it's the latest operating system it's not fifth seal it is not six-seal it is the seventh seal the operating system under the seventh seal happened to be seven voices to utter to that group that could take the world and hand it dear we have the right operating system all glory to god we are just waiting to be activated that we can make a phone call to heaven and said send on the child of the power just now [Applause] let me let me shake a little bit god can't move except we have you to move through a big one that's a big one yes that's a big one in other words he looking for your hands because you want to move you're looking for your mouth you're looking for your eyes he's got to put on your shoes god needs a body to work him and the devil need a body to work through come on now come on now and if the devil could anoint these people to do what they do and live what they live how much more the holy ghost to come upon sons and daughters of god hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god how much more oh glory to god i'm gonna close oh glory to god it's almost midnight but listen to this god sent a prophet before the dreadful day of the lord what we are preaching is what is before the dreadful day of the lord elias has already come and he dropped the message and turned his back and went home knowing it will fall in the hands of the pre-destination you could miss it if you try i challenge you from today look away from your problems as problems and see your problem as opportunity for god to come down and display his glory [Music] god made the barren to bear fruitfully god made the desert to bloom and blossom in the wilderness god is god almighty he loves when there's a goliath to bring forth david the issue is not goliath the issue is where is david [Applause] hallelujah jordan is not the problem is if we are faith to put our feet in jordan and see jordan roll back notice elijah he never questioned he never prayed oh god look at jordan river he took his mantle and he struck the jordan river hello jordan i'm coming through
