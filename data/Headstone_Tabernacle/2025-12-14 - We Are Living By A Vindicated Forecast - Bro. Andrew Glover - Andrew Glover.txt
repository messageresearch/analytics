Let the redeem of the Lord say so, whom he had redeemed from the hand of the enemy, and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south. They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way, they found no city to dwell in. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses, and he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. Oh, that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wondrous works to the children of men, for he satisfied the longing soul, and he fillth [music] the hungry soul with goodness. Amen.

No, [music] I won't. Hallelujah. I will not be defeated. No, I won't. You [music] see the Lord is on my side. I will not be. [music] I will not be defeated. Let's give a lot of praise. [music] Let's bow here a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your presence, Lord. We are so grateful to be here this morning. We are humbled by your grace, by the extension of your mercy to our lives that you could give us access to your presence. [music] Bless your people this morning. Bless the ministers, the pastors and all the churches here. You build people, Father. God bless your service as you come to minister your word and we look forward Lord for you to speak to our hearts. We need to hear from you. We wait to hear from you father. &gt;&gt; Oh God we come under expectation Lord looking for the spirit to speak [music] expressly thus say the Lord. Grant it father in Jesus name I ask it. You have your seat. God bless you and welcome. &gt;&gt; [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; We can't take this for granted, you know. We can't take this presence for granted. &gt;&gt; It's a [music] powerful thing. But Ram said, he said one day the spirit will be leave the earth &gt;&gt; and the people would even miss it &gt;&gt; because they never know what it was. &gt;&gt; It's why if you it was death to go into presence in the Old Testament. Now it's the death to be outside of his presence. So that is where we belong in his presence. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So God bless you with him. So we want to bring greetings to brother Norris [music] and his wife and the whole Christian Assembly that's here this morning. God bless you brother Norris. [applause] Praise God. And brother Harry is also here. Uh brother Andrew Lu is he. Brother Andrew. Maybe he's not here as yet. But Andrew, Pastor Andrew. But we thank you all for being here. Any other minister we say God bless [music] you and welcome. Praise God. Amen. So, we certainly appreciated the service last night. &gt;&gt; It [applause] was awesome. &gt;&gt; Now, we know there's no moving faculty past the eye. &gt;&gt; But the brand was the seer. Next is the intelligence. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And that is what dropped down last night. &gt;&gt; The intelligence of God by the word of God. Speaking about the will of God. This is not talking about Ukraine and Russia and the Pope &gt;&gt; and who the islands surround you with American forces and so on. We're not talking about that. &gt;&gt; This is you and your life. &gt;&gt; This is you and your walk. &gt;&gt; This is you and your thoughts and your ideas. &gt;&gt; There is Okay. So, the will of God, not just knowing of it, the knowledge of it, but the doing of it. &gt;&gt; So, last night was thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; You should go back and listen to that message. You realize that if we include or embrace this seeking the will of God, it will change where you go, &gt;&gt; what you do, &gt;&gt; how you think, &gt;&gt; what you say, &gt;&gt; and how you react. &gt;&gt; Your friends will change immediately &gt;&gt; if you ask God, is this your will? &gt;&gt; Because sometimes the devil hide behind friendship and family and other things to try to get you off that path. Remember you have to stay focused. &gt;&gt; Remember you have to stay the course. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So this uh uh thing about uh the will of God have to be incorporated into our daily living, &gt;&gt; our daily walk with the Lord. So now we could understand why some people don't bring thing to the ministry. Why some people don't take advice or want counsel because they want God to bless their own thoughts &gt;&gt; because they're afraid if they come something different will be said to them. &gt;&gt; And not to prepare to give up, let go and abandon what they need to abandon. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So we're going to bring on the speaker now. I want to read a scripture. You sit down. Uh this one Samuel chapter 17:45-51. And then said David to the Philistines, "Thou comest to me with a sword, &gt;&gt; and with a spear, and with a shield, but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, &gt;&gt; the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied." &gt;&gt; So he was seeing a spirit that define the God of Israel. &gt;&gt; This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand, and I will smite thee, and take thy head from thee. I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistine this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth and all the earthmen know that there is a God in Israel. There's a God in this message, the God of Malachi 4th live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When anointing struck Elijah, Elisha, he said, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?" The anointing wasn't in the court. It was in that God that promised all these things. It came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and drew nine to meet David that David hasted and ran towards the army to meet the Philistine. He wasn't walking. He was running because he had a rock. He had a revelation. Isn't that right? And David put his hand in his back, took a dense stone, and slung it and smoked the Philistine in his forehead. And that stone sunk into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth. So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling with a stone and smoked the Philistine and slew him. And there was no sword in the hand of David. Therefore, David ran and took out upon the Philistine and took the sword, his sword, same message they have, same books and tapes they have, same word that they preaching with, same his sword, and take it. What? What David did with it? He said, and drew it out of the sheet thereof and slew him, cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw the champion was dead, they fled. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the That's the scripture I have for you this morning. &gt;&gt; But here what the prophet said now. Many meetings, many, many ministers come to me and confess that they believe that the name of Jesus is right to be baptized, but our organization would put us out. &gt;&gt; You poor excuse. &gt;&gt; Take Saul's armor off. &gt;&gt; That is what the matter today. God has got a lot of sheep that gone astray. &gt;&gt; The organization and things have stole them out and brought them into psychology. God. He had a prophecy. Give us David's &gt;&gt; with the word of God and the power of God to direct it when we go to meet these intellectual giants. &gt;&gt; Whatever it might be, give us the word of God and the power of the Holy Ghost. I tell you, we can slay every giant on the field. &gt;&gt; So, the giants is is is making their wrongs. The giants are making their wrongs and on the field. But God promised he going to have some anointed Davids that going to take that sling and sling it out there. Men who are not afraid. Men who have met the pillar of fire. Men who know their God. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh, there's a little more. He said we need, he said, we know we need a revival. We know we need a stirring amongst the people. It will not take a duct of divinity. It will take a weakling. that will take the word of God and the power of the resurrection of Christ and slay this thing. It will bring Christ to the country. It will let them see. He can still open the eyes of the blind. He can still heal the sick. He can still raise the dead. He's a conqueror. We need a David untrained in theological schools. We need a man who knows nothing about that. Some little plow boy somewhere, some little guy, some little stoers, not much to look at, will come walking down the road with the power of God that is from perfect strength by perfect weakness. Could we stand and give the Lord a shout of praise as the man of God come to the pulpit to preach [music] to you the unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's sing that song. In his presence, [music and singing] that's where I strong. In [music] this [singing] presence, oh Lord [singing] my God, [music] in this hallelujah presence &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; in your presence, [music and singing] oh God. It's in [music] your presence, oh [singing] God. Amen. How many believes we're in his presence [music] this morning? Amen. I'm thankful today to be alive and well and to know that we've not missed the presence of God. The presence of God has not gone unrecognized. But we have recognized his presence. [music] And you that listen to the prophet of God, you know, he said that when his presence is not recognized, [music] his power is not released. He said, "But when you recognize his presence, then you release his power." And I believe that's why the power of God is flowing here today is because someone has recognized that this is not a man. It's not just another [music] message, but it's the return of the presence of Jesus Christ vindicated by the Bible. Amen. We are in his presence today with a promise. Amen. We [music] want to say God bless you all this morning. How many is happy to be in the house of God today? Amen. Amen. We thank the Lord. Amen. For his divine mercy and grace. We want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We count it such an honor and a privilege to be uh here today with the bride of Jesus Christ in this part of the world. And we want to thank uh brother Theo, the pastor here for this invitation, the opportunity to be here, brother Isaac for inviting us and being here as well. And uh we just thank the Lord that he's given us an opportunity to declare the message of the hour. And amen. We want to bring you greetings again from our pastor, our church there at home, Grace Tabernacle in Black Rockck, Arkansas. Our pastor, brother Matt Moore, sends their greetings to you all. And so we want to be sure and do that this morning. And Amen. It is a real honor for me to be here in in Trinidad for the first time. I was sharing with brother um Isaac when we arrived that years ago when I I first started ministering. I gave my heart to the Lord when I was 9 years old and was baptized and filled with the Holy Spirit and began ministering when I was 13 years old. And when I began traveling around uh well, I started traveling some when I was 13. uh you know people taking us different places but when I was around 161 17 the Lord um just one day put Trinidad on my heart and I began to talk to a brother who had been here many years ago and he said yeah there's ministers and churches there and and uh I said well if it's the Lord's will he'll open the door one day and we'll go and that was several years ago and the Lord has opened the door for us to come here this weekend and we thank you brothers for that God richly bless you amen we pray that we can just be a small blessing to you here this weekend. And amen. I I know it's Sunday morning and it's a wonderful day to serve the Lord. And maybe before we open the Bible, we could just bow our hearts for a word of prayer today. And we'll just ask the Lord to come and speak to us today by his word. How many would just say, Lord, speak to me by your word today. Heavenly Father, Lord, we have gathered here this morning under great anticipation of your presence. Father, we've not gathered here to be seen or to be heard. But Father, we've gathered here for one thing, and that is to worship you. Lord, your word said, "If I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto myself." And Father, Lord, we've not come here today to lift ourselves up or to lift a church up. But Lord, we've come here to lift you up, Lord. Father, I pray that you would come among us today in a special way. Father, may your anointing fill this room, Lord. May you drive out every spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit. Father, Lord, may you bring a grace upon your people today as your word goes forth. Lord, I pray the power of the enemy would be bound and broken today. Father, I pray that revelation would come to hearts and lives here, oh God. Lord, I pray maybe there be one sick among us today as your word goes forth. Father, may healing move into that sick body, oh God. Lord, if there be one at home listening, unable to be here today, I pray you would send the angel of God by their home. Father, Lord, maybe one in a hospital room or Lord, one that has grown cold on you and lost their desire to serve you, Father. Lord, if if if some way they would hear this service, I pray, Lord, that a col of fire of revelation would come up off the altar, oh God. And Lord, may it strike their hearts, Father. I pray that you would restore the joy of salvation here today. I pray Lord you would restore peace and you would restore faith oh God. Lord may the power of the enemy be broken here today by the preaching of your word. Now Father forgive us of our failures Lord. Forgive us of our shortcomings Lord. We we acknowledge and we openly admit we have nothing Lord in ourselves oh God. Lord to offer this people but you have sent a message in this hour. And Lord, if we can get ourselves out of the way and say what your prophet has already said, then Lord, I believe you will come among us the same way today as you did then because you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. And Father, we commit this meeting today in thy faithful hands. Have thy way among us. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. And all the believers says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. God bless you this morning. If you have your Bibles while you're standing with us today, we want to go to the book of Job, the 19th chapter. The book of Job, the 19th chapter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Job chapter 19, also Proverbs 29 and 1 Peter. I have a few places I want to read this morning. In Job chapter 19 and verse 23, he says, "Oh, that my words were now written, now that they were printed in a book, that they were graven with an iron pen and led in the rock forever. For I know that my redeemer liveth and shall and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth." There is one translation of that I love. It says, "I know my redeemer or my vindicator liveth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh, this is not a hope so guess. Yet in my flesh shall I see God, &gt;&gt; whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold and not another, though my reigns be consumed within me." In the book of Proverbs the 29th chapter, it's a very very familiar scripture. Proverbs 29 and verse number 18. Proverbs 29 and verse number 18. Solomon here writing in the in the 29th chapter 18th verse. He says, "Now where there is no vision, no revelation of God and his word. Where there is no vision, the people perish, &gt;&gt; but he that keepeth the law, happy is he. &gt;&gt; And one other place I want to look is in the New Testament in 1 Peter chapter 1. First Peter chapter 1 and verse number eight. 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse number eight. Uh Peter here writing he says, "Whom have you not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing?" How many believes here today? &gt;&gt; Yet believing ye rejoice. So believing is your source for rejoicing. Yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. Of which salvation? Now watch this. of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you. Now how many knows the prophet of God said the bride is a prophetic class of people. &gt;&gt; He said the book of revelation is a prophetic book. Now here Peter says there is a grace that has been prophesied. So this is not any kind of grace but it's a prophetic grace to a prophetic class of people. the grace that prophesied. Look here searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into. Now look at verse 13. Now wherefore g up the loins of your mind, be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. We ask the Lord this morning to bless the reading of his word as you can have your seat here this morning. If the Lord would help me today, if I would take a title, I want to talk to you for a few moments on this. We are living by a vindicated forecast. We are living by a vindicated forecast. I I just want to share this with you. 1 Peter uh 1:13 from the Amplified Bible. It says, "So prepare your minds for action. Be completely sober in spirit, steadfast, self-disciplined, spiritually and morally alert." Now listen, fix your hope completely on the grace of God that is coming to you when Jesus Christ is revealed. So when Jesus Christ is revealed, there is a grace that is coming to the church. Amen. To receive the revelation that is being come into the church. Now I just want to maybe uh read a lengthy quote to you for a moment to lay a foundation in in the message. My redeemer liveth. Brother Re said, "I think of Job." He said he he was looking forward, amen, to this morning. Job was looking forward, amen, to this morning. When he was old, he was stricken in age. His flesh was simply falling from his body from sores. His heart was broken in grief. Amen. Now, watch this. Every mortal part of his being was withering away. Amen. He was at his wits end. Everything he had was gone. He said, "But then God in his mercy come down to Job." Listen. And he give him another sense. Amen. That he could open his eyes and see the day that he would re a body he would receive. Now, he knew that there was a coming one, a just one who would stand in his place, who would raise up the body of the dead. And so, he said, "I know that my redeemer liveth." Reverend said, "Oh, I like those positive words." Amen. Amen. I not a hope so, not I have a feeling there will be. Amen. But I know my redeemer liveth. Job had more. Amen. Than a hope so. Amen. He had more than a feeling. Amen. He knew it. There was no more negative. It was now all positive. Listen, I want to say this. Amen. How thankful we are today that we don't have the dead bodies, but we have, Amen. the resurrected spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. that he rose from the dead &gt;&gt; triumphant. It's not no more I guess so. You could look at a cross and guess. You could look at a body laying in the ground and say I guess so. I hope so. But when the vision that struck Job ever become a reality, amen, the resurrection of the Lord Jesus by the Holy Spirit in the heart. Amen. Then you God, I know my redeemer liveth. Now I want you to catch this. Amen. That Job, Amen, 4,000 years before the coming of the Son of God. Amen. Job saw by vision the resurrection. Listen, he was not there physically. Amen. But by vision, he saw the resurrection. Amen. And I love to say it to you like this. And by that vision, he received assurance that he was going to be there. Amen. Amen. So he was not only seeing it. Amen. But he received an assurance that he was going to be a part of what he was seeing. I like to say it like this. Job, Amen, received a forecast. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? Amen. Job received a forecast. Now, when you look there at that word forecast, if you can, if you can turn it up in my ear and leave it, I'll control it on my side. Amen. The word forecast, it actually means a prophecy. Amen. An estimate or a prediction of a future happening or condition. It is to predict or to estimate a future event. It is to indicate is likely to occur. Now I I love what the prophet of God said in modern events are made clear by prophecy. He said now we want to be posted to know what's to take place. Amen. For the age that we live in. How many wants to be posted? Amen. To know what is to take place. Amen. For the age that we live in. Another word. Amen. Therefore forecast is vision. Brother said a vision is the forecast of future events. It foretells the thing before it happens. That's the way God always vindicated whether it was a true prophet or not. He said see he was not a man hand laid on him and become a prophet. Amen. But before he was born. Amen. He was born a prophet. Listen the gift was in him. Amen. Before he was born. Now listen. A vision is what? It is the word or of God. Amen. It is something foretold. It is a forecast of an event. He said, "Now a vision that the prophets had or Jesus had or Paul had or all of them had." He said, "Now here we see the forecast is being made manifest and people don't even recognize it." Listen, we are living in the hour when the forecast is being manifested and people don't even recognize it. I think it's powerful when brother Brandham preached the seven church ages, he actually called those sermons a forecast. &gt;&gt; He said in Feast the trumpets, the preach of the seven church ages, which is the pattern, amen, or the forecast of all that God was going to do for the churches, amen, and through the churches and positionally setting them up. Now, in the Old Testament, we hear those words. Amen. Thus saith the Lord. You know that is recorded in the Bible more than 2,000 times. Amen. Now, when those words come, thus saith the Lord, you got to remember it's not the man talking. Amen. But it's God talking through the man. Amen. Amen. If if it was the man, then he would be a hypocrite. It would never come to pass. Amen. Now, listen what a prophet said. He said, "So the Bible is thus saith the Lord." Amen. By the prophets. You want to hear, "Thus saith the Lord." Open up your Bible. Amen. The Bible is thus saith the Lord by the prophets. He said, "What they done was they took Christ's spirit upon themselves and they begin to forecast, Amen, the events that was going to come to pass." He said, "You talk about forecast." Amen. Amen. They stood there. Amen. And the readers would read it and they would think that the prophets were speaking of themselves. Amen. But I want to say this morning, amen, many times they were speaking, amen, of events that would take place in future generations. [laughter] Amen. I don't have time to show them all to you, but I can show you one. Amen. All the way back in Corinthians and back in Thessalonians, Paul prophesied and said, "We shall not all sleep." Amen. But we shall be changed. Amen. and we shall be alive and remain. Do you realize there's not one Thessalonian alive today? Amen. There's not one Corinthian alive today. Amen. But there's a bride of Jesus Christ who has received the revelation of what Paul was saying. And by the receiving of the revelation, she is in position for her body to be changed. This is not a man. This is not a church. This is the prophecy of God coming to pass in the hour that we're living in. My, when I think of that prophecy, it didn't come in the old time by the will of man. But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Now, I love that word moved. [laughter] It means to be moved inwardly. It means to bring forward into speech. Amen. That word prophecy, amen, is foretelling future events which could only come by the divine mind. Now, I love what a prophet says. He said, "Prophecy, if it's true word of God, it cannot fail." Ain't that powerful? Amen. Put everything you got on that. If it's prophecy, it's true word of God and it cannot fail. Now, when I think of this here this morning, we are living by a vindicated forecast. How many How many knows that there's a natural forecast? Amen. Amen. I will say this, but there's also a spiritual forecast. Amen. When you when you hear the word forecast, Amen. What's the first thing you think of? The weather. [laughter] Amen. The first thing your mind thinks of when you hear the word forecast, amen, is the weather forecast. Now, I find it amazing that the Bible actually speaks, amen, of the weather forecast in Matthew 16 and Luke 12. It said this, "You can discern the face of the skies, but you cannot discern the signs of the time." Amen. Now, watch this. When the weather forecast is spoke of in the Bible, it is dealing with the ability, amen, to forecast the weather, but it is also speaking of the lack of spiritual discernment. So you can look at the clouds and say, "Today it's going to rain." [laughter] You can look at the face of the skies and you can discern the cloud, but you cannot discern the time that you're living in. Oh, let me let me sound a trumpet to you this morning. As the elected overcomers of the age that we are living in, we must have spiritual discernment. Come on, folks. Spiritual discernment is not an option. It is a must. Amen. I love what Paul said. He said, "The natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolish unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned." When you look at that word discerned, it means by the aid of the Holy Ghost. Listen, without the Holy Ghost, we're headed for a tribulation. Without the Holy Ghost, we don't know how to believe. We don't know who to follow. But thank God, the Holy Ghost has been bound by denominational rivers for 2,000 years. But it was to be loosed in the evening time. Come on, church. What was going to loose the Holy Ghost? It was the message of Zechariah the 14th chapter. In the evening time, it shall be light. My when I think of that, the Holy Ghost is not coming. The Holy Ghost is here. Hey, the Holy Ghost is not on his way. The Holy Ghost is already here. Amen. These things are spiritually discerned. Now, when you look at that word discern, it means to judge. It means to estimate. It means to determine the excellency or the defect of something. &gt;&gt; Now, I love what the prophet said. He said, "We have an order from God, right? It is for the discerning of the spirit." Amen. Try the spirit. I believe that's a very great lesson for the church today is to try the spirit of anything. Come on. How many knows the Bible says all Israel is not Israel? Can I tell you something? Everything that claims message is not message. Folks, I hate to say it, but everything that claims to be the message is not the message. This message is not the kingdom building of a man. It's not the following of a personality. This message is the revelation of Jesus Christ that has been brought in this age. My when I think of that, we are to discern by the spirit of God. Come on. We are to determine the excellency or the defect. Come on now. Amen. That's why we must live by the word in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Can I say that to you? We must live by the word in the spirit. Modern events made clear San Bernardina. He said, "Listen, make sure the spirit that's upon you is a word spirit according to the word." &gt;&gt; Now, John said it very beautiful. He said, "Believe not every spirit, &gt;&gt; but try the spirit whether they are of God." Listen, because many false prophets are gone out into the world. You know what Paul said to Timothy? He said they'll have a form of godliness but they will deny the power thereof. Brother said they will preach the Bible but will deny the revelation of it. Amen. Now what is the power of this bride? It is the revelation that she is believing is what's given her the power in the hour that she's living in. I love what a prophet said. He said Paul promised in the last days by the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that the church would fall away millions of them. There will come a falling away. That's a forecast, isn't it? There will come a falling away. Here's a forecast. Men will be heading. They will be high-minded. They will be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, truth breakers, false accusers, incontinent, and despisers of those that are good. Listen to what the prophet said. Not the [screaming] right discernment. He said, "Oh, you say that's communists." No, that's so-called Christians. He said, now watch the next verse. They will have a form of godliness but will deny the power thereof. He says no spiritual discernment. Amen. When you got spiritual discernment and the Holy Ghost is upon you, you have spiritual discernment and it says amen to every promise of God. If you got the Holy Ghost, come on church. We we put too many evidences of the Holy Ghost. Let's come back to what a prophet said. He said the only true evidence of the Holy Ghost is when a man can receive the word for the age that he's living in. My I think today we got a right to preach the promises of God. I think we got a right to stand on platforms around the world and declare this is not something in the future. This is not something that has been. This is a present tense revelation. [cheering] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what the prophet said. Everything that's been promised has got to come to pass. I think it's time to forget our man-made theology. I think it's time to cry out to God for spiritual power and for spiritual discernment. When I begin to think of the age we're living in, I think how God who is rich in mercy would send a prophet into this generation and he would begin to preach something like this. He would say, "There's three sons names, right?" He would say, "See, there's the son of man. There's the son of God. He said, "And there's the son of David." He said, "But now watch. In between the son of God and the son of David, there was a scripture which was Luke 17:30." And it said, "Listen, in the day when the son of man would be revealed." Now, I believe what a prophet said. Amen. that Jesus forecasted. Remember what Luke 17:30 said, "As it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the day when the Son of Man will be revealed." In other words, he prophesied or forecasted [laughter] that the conditions of Sodom and Gomorrah would return in the day the son of man would be revealed. Now, listen to what he said. He said, "The police and the homicides and all, it's just on the go all the time, breaking up boys living together." Now, folks, this is all the way back in the 50s. He said, "Husband and wife and and women living the same way." Amen. Pervert it. Their minds are filthy minds because they don't have spiritual discernment. All is a lust and a filth and they can't satisfy theelves with one another. He said they don't even marry. They just take up and go out until they're perverted. Now, listen it, brother Brandham. Jesus said that would be in the last days and here it is. &gt;&gt; Now, are you with me? He's not just reading the Bible and saying, "It's coming. It's coming." He says, "Now, here's what the Bible says." And here it is. He said, "When Jesus come, he was to be a prophet. And today, before Jesus comes again, the full manifestation of the person of Jesus Christ is to be manifested in flesh. As it was in the days of Sodom, so will it be in the coming of the Son of Man. When the Son of Man is being revealed, Amen. What is revealed? It's unfolded. It's made known. The secret has been brought forth. It's been revealed in the day the Son of Man will be revealed. The world will be in a Sodom condition. And a prophet said, "We've got it, haven't we?" How many believe that? It's a Sodom condition. Now, do you realize it took a prophet, amen, to get the revelation of the son of man? And it took a prophet to identify, amen, the time you're living in is the fulfillment of Luke 17:30. Come on, church. What other preacher could stand and read St. Luke 17:30 and then look across the congregation and say, "This day is this scripture fulfilled?" Hey, but we can stand here today with an authority in our hearts. We are living in the hour that the word has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; It took a prophet to get the revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his scriptural revelations except by a prophet. &gt;&gt; The word always came by prophet and always will. That is the law of God. It is evident by even a casual surge of scripture. &gt;&gt; Now, I love what he says. The unchanging God. How many believes he's unchanging? with unchanging ways, invariably sent his prophet in every age. When the people had strayed from divine order, with both the theologians &gt;&gt; and the people having departed from the word, God always sent his servant to the people, but apart from the theologians in order to correct the false teaching. &gt;&gt; Now, come on, folks. And lead the people back to God. Now, now somebody say, "Well, Amen. I don't think it really matters what we believe." I think it does. &gt;&gt; Come on. I don't think we ought to just believe everything that comes by. I think we ought to have an anchor to what we believe. I think we ought to have an absolute to what we believe. &gt;&gt; Now, the pro God said, "It's the whole word, all the word, and the word of the hour is what counts." Ain't that powerful? The whole word, all the word, the word of the hour, what counts. and it'll never do it until God anoints a prophet that can stand and tell it [laughter] and confirms him and proves that it's right. Now, I want to say this to you. When spiritual discernment has been given into your heart, Amen. Spiritual discernment is not guessing something is right &gt;&gt; or guessing that it's wrong, but spiritual discernment is knowing what is right and knowing what is wrong. Can I can I tell you this? Without spiritual discernment, you don't even know what truth is. It takes spiritual discernment to identify what truth is in the hour that you're living in. What did Jesus say? He said, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." [cheering] Well, Brother Brandham said, "If you can see God's word and still don't think it's the truth, then there's something wrong with your spiritual discernment. Any man can read a newspaper, if he's got any spiritual discernment about him at all, and can see we're at the end. The hour is here. There is nothing left for us but the coming of the Lord Jesus. He said, now some people go out and say, "Oh, that might be a thousand years from the day." I don't believe that. He says, "I believe this generation will see the coming of the Lord Jesus." And if this generation doesn't do it, he said, then I want to preach to the young people. &gt;&gt; I want to preach to the young people that they'll be looking for it in their generation. Amen. I love that, brother Isaac. I want to preach to the young people. I want to build a spiritual expectation. I want to give a spiritual forecast to the young people. I want to tell them the world has fallen apart. I want to tell them Sodom and Gomorrah has returned. I want to tell them perversion is at an all-time high. I want to tell them crime is still in the streets. I want to tell them the nation is breaking. But I want to tell them that's not what you're looking at. When you see these things happen, it ain't time to focus on what's happening around you. Look up. Your redemption is calling nigh. Hallelujah. Let me say it to you today. I'm not focused. Come on, church. I'm not focused on what's happening around me. I've already heard the forecast. [cheering] I've already heard the forecast. There will be a tribulation, but there will be a rapture. There will be a falling away, but there will be a gathering together unto himself. There will be an apostasy, but there will be a revelation strike the heart [laughter] of the bride of Jesus Christ. Oh, I love what Ephesians or what 1 Thessalonians 4 says. It says somebody's going to be alive. Woo. That makes me That makes me want to shout. Somebody's going to be alive and they're going to remain. You know what I love about that word alive, pastor? Amen. It means fresh. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That word alive means fresh. Somebody's going to be fresh when the Lord comes. Listen, I want to tell that devil, this is not a common message. We're not a bunch of stale, amen, indoctrinated Christians that ain't got no joy and ain't got no power. It's just not a man's idea. [cheering] Come on, church. I believe what the prophet said. He said, "There is a stimulation from revelation. I got a I got a friend. There's a stimulation of revelation." Right. Amen. I I got a friend of mine up in Saskatoon, an elder pastor, Brother Brother Men Freeze, and he he said something one time. I love it. He said, "I believe in stimulation and revelation." He said, "I don't believe in revelation from stimulation." I said, "I like that." Amen. I want what I've got, Amen, to be coming from what I believe. Come on, church. I Come on. I want what I've got to be coming from what I believe. And the Bible says that there'll be somebody who will be alive and they'll be fresh. Listen what a prophet said. If you fell asleep, he said that's okay. He said, "You will wake up if you fell asleep looking for the coming of the Lord." He said, "When you wake up, you'll be just as fresh as you were when you went down." Oh, church of the living God. Can I tell you this morning? Amen. Sleep don't change expectation. Sleep don't change anticipation. Are you with me? Amen. Amen. You mas daddies can preach with me on this point. Amen. Tell your babies the night before, "Tomorrow we're going to the theme park. Tomorrow we're going to the amusement park." And they go to sleep. Now, all you hope is when they wake up in the morning, they forgot what you told them. But when they wake up and their foot hits the floor, the first thing they say, they remind you what you promised. They reminded you that you said, "Today, we're going to go to the theme park. Oh, church of the living God. The seven thunders have uttered their voices. We have heard the revealed mystery truths and the ever remembering God has come on the scene in this generation. Listen, it's time to cry out the promises of God in the generation that we're living in. [cheering] We're not we're not pleading the ideas of a man. We're pleading the promises of God. Oh yes. God sent a prophet in this age to call these things present tense. Now I got Bible on that. He's the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, and forever. How many knows that brother Bannon wrote or he recorded an audio letter to Lee Vale &gt;&gt; on the church age book? Have you ever read the first part of that? You know what he says? He says, "Now look here, brother Veil." He says, "Unless God sends a prophet to interject this to make it present tense, &gt;&gt; then it's a historical affair." &gt;&gt; So, I love what the Bible said. Amen. I send an angel before thee &gt;&gt; to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Malachi 4, behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet. Forecast right &gt;&gt; before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Now, watch the forecast. He shall turn the heart &gt;&gt; of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with the curse. Now how many knows the prophet makes it very plain? He says the messenger Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things. One, he is going to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers. And two, amen, those seven thunders which are the divine revealed mystery truths which are contained in the seven ship. Listen today, folks. We don't have to go ask a man what the thunders are. We've got thus sayaeth the Lord by the vindicated prophet of the hour. He has already broke the revelation to the church. And that revelation [laughter] has lit a fire in the soul of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, come on. Let's not stop at Exodus 23. Let's not stop at Malachi 4. Let's go all the way under perfection. Let's go to Ephesians 4 where he gave something. He gave some prophets and he gave some pastors and he gave some apostles and evangelists and teachers. Amen. Now watch the forecast for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, [screaming] [cheering] till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Listen, that we henceforth be no more children. tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie wait to the scene but speaking the truth in love. &gt;&gt; Now come on folks if you really love somebody you'll tell them the truth. &gt;&gt; Come on. If you really love somebody, you won't sugarcoat it. You won't put a pair of gloves on to say it. You'll tell them the truth that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ. Now, amen. I just got to say when a prophet said, he said, "If a man comes and he has a great gift, &gt;&gt; don't matter if he belongs to our denomination or another denomination, don't you judge him by what denomination he comes from, how he dresses, but what you want to see is what he's trying to do with that gift. what purpose he has. If he's trying to take his influence and build himself a great name out of it, I would have discernment of spirit enough to know that's wrong. &gt;&gt; No matter how great a teacher he is, how powerful he is, how intellectual he is, how his gift operates, if he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of Christ, your own spiritual discernment would tell you that's wrong. No matter how accurate, no matter how perfect, how it is. Amen. It's wrong if it isn't used for the body of Jesus Christ. I say God forgive us for invading pullpits and building walls rather than building bridges into the presence of Jesus Christ. Amen. I flew all the way over here. I might as well preach. I'm here. Amen. I think it's time to come back to what the prophet said. I think it's time to lay aside tradition. I think it's time somebody put your foot on that old devil of organization, that old devil denomination. This is not a dividing message. It's a uniting time and a uniting sign. And my headship is not in Rome. So don't make it anywhere else. Come on. If I'm going to have a head, I might as well go get the one they all got wrong. Amen. My headship is not in Jeffersonville. My headship is not in Ohio. My My headship is not in Trinidad. My headship is not in Arizona. My headship is in heaven. I come from God. And I want to go back to God. I'm not following a man. I'm following a vindicated [music] forecast that has been revealed that has been unfolded by the son of man. I'm not following some man. I'm following Joshua. [cheering] I'm following Joshua. And Joshua is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? He said, Joshua, that new leader, he positionally placed [music] the tribes of Israel. &gt;&gt; And he divided the land of inheritance. Now, how did he do it? He did it by spiritual discernment. &gt;&gt; Do you see something? Joshua's personality didn't put him in their position. Joshua's ability to quote Moses did not put him in their position. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen. Joshua's relationship with Moses did not put him in their position. Spiritual discernment of the word of God went all the way back to when those mothers were birthing those sons and they were crying out in birth pains. And by spiritual discernment, Joshua, he be to position him in their place. I love what a prophet said. He said, "And there they remained." There they remained and became the cream of the crop. What are you saying, preacher? I'm saying I didn't come in by a man so a man can't take me out. [cheering] I didn't come in by some preacher's personality so some preacher's personality can't take me out. I came in by a direct revelation. My name was on the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world. [cheering] I'm not living by some church. I'm not living by some preacher. I'm living by the message of the hour. It's a vindicated forecast. It's spiritual discernment. It's spiritual revelation. It's Matthew 16. Come on. It's Matthew 16. Flesh and blood. Come on. This is not a flesh and blood affair. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Well, now now I know what they say. They say, "Well, I was with brother Brandham, so you got to follow me." I've got to follow what he said. &gt;&gt; I remember, Brother Theo, I may be getting too open. You can correct me, but I [laughter] I remember as a young I remember as a young preacher, there was an elder brother come to me one day and he sat me down and he said, "I'm going to tell you something right now." He said, "I was with brother Brandham and I was around brother Brandham and my family. He going on and he said, "I want to tell you something." He said, "Brother Bram called me friend." &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, he called me Brian." [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm no longer going to call you church. I'm going to call you bride. You're no longer the girlfriend of Jesus Christ. You are the wife of Jesus Christ who has received the unmmerited wedding band of grace upon your finger. [cheering] I didn't come in by a man so a man can't take me out. Now, now you got to you got to you got to see what a brother said. He said, "Flesh and blood didn't reveal this to you, &gt;&gt; but my father which is in heaven revealed it." Look what he said, "Upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." He said, "Now, what is the gates of hell against? It's not against denomination, saints. It's not against intellectualism. It's not against education." &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? He said, "It's not even against the government. The government recognizes it." He said, "Look, it's against spiritual revelation of Christ being here now, the same yesterday, today, and forever." Watch. That's where the church is missing it today. It's the spiritual discernment to see what God's are doing. And they look way over the top for something here that's going on right here. And it'll be passed before you know it. Now, now can I say something to you? Don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? Don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Look, somebody say, "Well, brother Andrew Glover is coming to Headstone Tabernacle. We're going to have some meetings. I saw the fire." Okay. Well, 3 weeks ago, you was looking for it. You was looking forward to it. But tomorrow, if you get up and say, "I'm looking for brother Andrew to come to." Amen. You've already missed it. &gt;&gt; You've already missed it. Now, come on, church. And I'll say this to you. Amen, brother. Said it. Beautiful. He said, "Don't you miss it, but study these tapes. Man now is like he's always been. He's praising God for what he's done. He's looking forward to what he's going to do and is ignoring what he has done and is doing. He praises God for what he has done. He looks forward to what he will do, but he ignores what God is doing." and there misses the whole thing. Now, do you know why men do that? Because if you recognize what's going on, then you recognize it's not them. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; If you recognize what's happening, [laughter] I I'm not here to fight. I'm here to preach. If if you recognize what's going on that that as long as a man says there's something coming or something coming, he can inject himself and say you've got to have me to get to what's coming. But if you can by spiritual discernment discern the word of God and the hour that you're living in, he said look it's a spiritual condition of the church today. They failed to see the hour they're living in. They're looking for some sensation or something way off in the future. Come on, Headstone Tabernacle. We're not a bunch of Catholics. We're sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Well, someday we'll reach perfection. Someday we'll become overcomers. Listen, the word is the perfection of the church. And any man, any woman who can receive the headship of the word will climb up into the presence of God. [cheering] Come on, church. I'm not a crazy man. I'm a son of God. I'm a child of God. And I know where I come from. I know where I'm going because I know what I'm following. [applause] I'm not following a man. I'm following the word. Reverend said, "May he and his power." There it is. May he and his power come to the audience of people and with his spiritual discernment show you he is the word. Now, can I say this to you today? And I want you to hear me. We are not looking for a vision. &gt;&gt; We are looking at &gt;&gt; we are looking at a vision. &gt;&gt; Can I say this to you? We have the vision. &gt;&gt; Listen, if you're looking for something, then you're not looking at it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. If you're looking Come on. I can take you to Luke 15. There's parables there. The woman lost the coin. &gt;&gt; Now, now everybody wants to rejoice and I believe in rejoicing. I I believe in shouting, but I don't think it's something we got to work up. &gt;&gt; I believe we've got a message. And if we'll preach the message, the message will bring a stimulation into the heart of every eagle. &gt;&gt; Come on. You like somebody. Oh, come on. Shout. Shout. Shout. Amen. Everybody shout. Shout. I'll shout if I want to preach the message. Is &gt;&gt; that okay? Amen. And if you'll begin to preach it and you'll give me something to look at when I find what I'm looking for, then I can begin to rejoice. When she was looking for the coin, there was no rejoicing. When he was looking for the sheep, there was no rejoicing. When the son was away from the father's house and he was looking for the son, there was no rejoicing. But when they found the go, when they found the sheep, when the prodical son come home, they all be to rejoice because that which was missing had been found. And for 2,000 years, for seven church ages, they were looking for God. They were looking for the manifestation of God. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the revelation will be made clear and somebody will say, "Praise God, I am [screaming] the bride's revival. I'm not looking for the bride's revival. I'm looking at I'm not looking for the seven seals. I'm looking at the revelation. I'm not looking for the third pull. I'm looking at the third pull. [cheering and applause] Will somebody rejoice? [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; See, you've got something to rejoice about. &gt;&gt; Where there is no vision, the people perish. &gt;&gt; Brother Brother Theo, I love that word vision. &gt;&gt; It means oracle. &gt;&gt; It means prophecy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or divine communication. &gt;&gt; Where there is no divine communication, &gt;&gt; the people perish. Now, &gt;&gt; I love what a prophet says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "What is the seer? What is a vision?" It's another dimension. &gt;&gt; See, it's outside the [screaming] five. It's a six sense. &gt;&gt; You know, somebody asked Brother Random. They said, "But Ran, when you say you have a vision, do you do you feel impressed to say something or do you actually see it?" &gt;&gt; I love what he said. He said, "No, sir. I see it." &gt;&gt; So, he's not speaking up on impressions. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now you got to you got to either realize this message is the truth or not. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "What's happening is he said, "My I'm getting into tonight's sermon." He said, "My body is here." He said, "But I'm over there." &gt;&gt; He said, "And I'm speaking over there what I'm seeing, but you're hearing it back here." &gt;&gt; He said, "A vision is God. It's by a word." Now, come on, church. A word of knowledge dropping to the person to foresee or foresee something. It tells something that has been or tells something that will be. Now I love what brother said in that quote we read at the beginning. He said when Job was at his wits end when every mortal part of his body was gone, he said God in his mercy gave Job another sense. &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? Now can I say this to you? Another sense is the six sense. &gt;&gt; It's the super sense. It's what Paul said. He said, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." I love what he says in Galatians 2:19. He said, "I through [screaming] the law am dead to the law." Listen, that I might live unto God. &gt;&gt; Now, can I can I read it to you? &gt;&gt; I am crucified with Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Isaac, I love this. Nevertheless, I live. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I'm [screaming] dead, yet I live." Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yet not I &gt;&gt; but Christ liveth in me &gt;&gt; and the life which I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me." Come on, church. Notice Paul didn't say, [screaming] "I live in the faith of the Son of God." He said, "I live by the faith of the Son of God. I love what Paul is saying. He is saying in one sense I am dead. &gt;&gt; In one sense I am dead but in another sense &gt;&gt; I am [screaming] alive. &gt;&gt; Oh church of the living God comes along and says this was a living faith. I live by the faith of the son of God. Paul did not say that he lived by faith in the son of God. Oh church, it was the faith of the son of God that had given him life and had kept him living in Christian victory. &gt;&gt; Oh, if you ever get that faith in your heart, you won't need a broken sister no more. If you ever get that faith in your heart, you won't be living from one convention to another. It'll be an artisian whale and it'll be springing up. It'll be bubbling up on the inside of you. [applause] Now, I want you to catch something here. In one sense, I'm dead. But in another sense, I'm alive. [screaming] I love that. In one sense, and another sense, it typically refers to the different ways that we perceive the world through our five senses. &gt;&gt; It is the sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Now, I study brother Brandham. Uh the best example I can give you of I in one sense in another sense is the proto God said this. He said tomorrow the mailman comes to your house and he offers you a box of rattlesnakes and says now all you got to do is sign for them. Your name is on the box. Now you say I don't want them. But the mailman says they're yours. You know what brother Bam said? He said in one sense they're yours. In one sense, they're yours, but in another sense, they're not yours until you sign for them. &gt;&gt; Now, come on, church. That's where spiritual discernment is going to come in. You've got to discern what you're signing for. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Come on, try the box of rattlesnakes. Amen. Try it. Listen, it's a box of rattlesnakes. It's not going to benefit your life. It's a defect that the devil's trying to get you to sign for. [applause] &gt;&gt; But spiritual discernment can discern the excellency or the defect of what's being presented to you. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Now some say, brother Brandham, could Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or something like that?" Well, in one sense of the word, that's exactly the truth. But in another sense of the word is an antichrist. That's the difference between right and wrong. &gt;&gt; Now folks, either he said the truth or he didn't. And I believe he did. &gt;&gt; To make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist. &gt;&gt; For that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the majesty on high and will come again in great power and glory. but for his life &gt;&gt; that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him. It's exactly the truth and you become Christ. &gt;&gt; Do you see spiritual discernment will discern the excellency and the defect? He said remember my message on messiah the word messiah means the anointed. Now you are, if you have the Holy Spirit, you become the anointed one. C, can I bring it on down? Jesus was a God man. He said, now see, he was a man in one sense, but he was God in another sense. He was man in flesh, but in spirit he was God. Now, come on. We got to bring it on down. We can't leave it way up there or way out there and you can never come to it. Let's bring it on down. For in a man, he is in one sense a miniature creator if he is a child of God. Because the spirit of God is in him who controls him, who operates him. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we are carnal. &gt;&gt; And that part [screaming] must perish. But then inside, we are a spirit man, a soul inside. Listen, are you with me now? &gt;&gt; He says that soul inside. He says that's faith in God's word. The soul [screaming] on the inside of the believer is faith in God's word. Listen. Then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith. &gt;&gt; Can I read the rest of it? Can I read the rest of it? By accepting what God said. [cheering] Glory to God. You want to bring your body under subjection to the word. Accept what God has said. [cheering] [applause] I'm feeling good now. Woo. I'm feeling good. Can I Can I just say it to you? There's three kinds of believers in every church. &gt;&gt; There's a make believer, &gt;&gt; there's an unbeliever, and there's a real believer. &gt;&gt; Can I bring it on down to you? There's three kinds of believers in every believer. &gt;&gt; Now you were shouting about every church. &gt;&gt; You say, "You can't prove that." I can. Do you realize what a prophet said? He said, "You are a triune being just like father, son, holy ghost." He said, "You got a body, you got a spirit, and you got a soul." &gt;&gt; Can I show you something? Your body is flesh, and your flesh is an unbeliever. It's your flesh that don't want to worship God. [cheering] &gt;&gt; It's your flesh that don't want to go to church. It's your flesh that don't want to pray. It's your flesh that don't want to forgive. It's your flesh that don't want to let things go. Because your flesh is a product of an adulterous affair between your between Eve and the serpent. Your flesh is an unbeliever. Can we bring it on down? &gt;&gt; Under that flesh, you got a spirit. &gt;&gt; Your spirit's [screaming] a make believer. [applause] &gt;&gt; You had a good service on Sunday. You get out of church and somebody calls you up &gt;&gt; and as my dear friend brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother Daryl Wetskow when he would answer the phone you'd say how you doing he'd say too blessed to be stressed &gt;&gt; too anointed to be disappointed &gt;&gt; too healed to be sick &gt;&gt; too saved to be lost &gt;&gt; now come on you'd have a good service and your spirit can go there but wake up on Monday morning and get a phone call from the doctor &gt;&gt; all right &gt;&gt; and Watch that spirit go from the high of high to the low of lows. Because your spirit is a make believer. When everything's going good, it's all high. When everything's going wrong, it's real low. But I want to go a little bit deeper. &gt;&gt; I want to go a little bit deeper. I got a question for you. But why [screaming] are you still here? Why are you still here? Why [screaming] are you still following this message? Why are you still believing and accepting what God said? Because underneath that flesh, underneath that spirit, there is a soul. And that soul is faith in God's word. And no matter how sick I am, I'm still saved. No matter how broke I am, I'm still a son of God. On my good days, I'm a child of God. On my bad days, I'm a child [music] of God. When I got money, I'm a child of God. When I'm broke, I'm a child of God. I am not saved from my flesh. I am not saved from my spirit. I am saved from my soul. It's from my soul. I believe God. It's from my soul. I believe this message. [applause] [cheering] Hallelujah. It's from my soul. [applause] I'm a son of God by my soul. [cheering and applause] and my soul is faith in God's word. [cheering] Well, somebody give him praise. Hallelujah. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whatever you yield that sense to is what'll dominate you. I got a 100 quotes on it. I don't have time to read them. The six sense is faith &gt;&gt; and it cannot lie. &gt;&gt; What is the super sense? It's the Holy Spirit. It's the faith of God that dwells in you. &gt;&gt; It makes you believe things you can't see. &gt;&gt; It makes you believe things you can't feel. [applause] &gt;&gt; It makes you believe things you can't reason. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; I got I got to I got to dedicate something to the devil. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Listen, devil. The devil can't get the devil can get into these five senses &gt;&gt; and lie to you, &gt;&gt; but he cannot touch &gt;&gt; that super sense. [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; It's far [screaming] beyond his reach. It comes from God. It's called faith. And faith is a great thing. &gt;&gt; It will deliver that word to you &gt;&gt; and make you walk contrary to anything there is but God's word. Now, &gt;&gt; I want to say something to you. &gt;&gt; The natural mind says and reads the word of God &gt;&gt; and says that is the word of God. Right? &gt;&gt; It's speaking the truth. &gt;&gt; But if it reads it and says it's not all the word of God &gt;&gt; or it was or it's something, it was one time but it isn't now. Then that six sense comes in. &gt;&gt; Do you see? That's why you can't trap a real believer inside man-made moves around this message. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. You can build the Cincinnati Zoo. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But a real eagle's going to get out of there. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Woo. [screaming] Glory. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. We We might as well preach. Amen. Amen. I heard [laughter] I think it was brother Tim Puit said it one time. He said, "I'm not going to no man-made concentration camps." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm sorry. I'm not working under some man-made man-made idea about this message. And you know what I say? I say, "And neither am I. I'm an eagle. I'm a son of God. I've got rights in the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, I know what they say. They say, "Well, if you don't follow me, and if you don't preach it the way I preach it, and you don't teach it the way I teach it, you don't say it the way I say it, then we'll cut you off." Cut me off. I got my own books and tapes. You'll never shut me up. I'll preach on a rock if I got to because I am a son of God and I've got a sick sense in my soul and it's declaring things that are to me. It's modern events made clear by the forecast. Am I doing okay on time? The sixth sense only feeds on the word of God. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Can I go on &gt;&gt; now? Now, now, now, do you realize your six sense works when nothing else will? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said this. He said there were two women come to the prayer line, right? He said one had a gorder on her neck &gt;&gt; and the other had a stomach trouble. &gt;&gt; He said now what happened was they sat in the meeting where the word was preached. &gt;&gt; And how do you how do you bring this flesh under subjection to the word? By accepting what God said. &gt;&gt; So as they were hearing the word, they were believing the word and they were becoming the word. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? See, their flesh was coming under subjection to the word that they was hearing. &gt;&gt; They come through the prayer line and the prophet said, "You're both healed." And they went off the platform and the gorder was still there &gt;&gt; and the stomach trouble was still there, but they left testifying, "I'm healed." In one sense, they were still sick. [applause and cheering] In one sense they were still sick but in another sense [cheering] and that other sense only belongs to a believer. It only belongs to a Christian. In one sense they were still sick but in another sense. In another sense they were already healed. I'm sorry. I feel so good. I got to say it. In one sense, I'm still in a tabernacle of humiliation, but in another sense, I've already heard from my theophony. In one sense, in one sense, I'm trapped in this old pest house, but in another sense, I've got a soul. And the soul that believeth on God has passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; I love what brother said. He said, "Try to rub that out if you can." [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Gorder still there. &gt;&gt; Stomach trouble still there. I'm healed. &gt;&gt; Two weeks. &gt;&gt; Two weeks go by, saints, &gt;&gt; and one morning. One more &gt;&gt; because faith &gt;&gt; which is the six sense which is unconscious [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; church. This message is too rich. &gt;&gt; She finished the orange juice &gt;&gt; without thinking. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because that flesh &gt;&gt; had already come subject to the word. &gt;&gt; So the flesh was no longer determined in her condition. &gt;&gt; She drank the juice and said it stayed down. She finished the toast. It stayed down. She said, "Now let's give it the acid test." She made a cup of coffee. &gt;&gt; I love coffee. She made a cup of coffee and she drank the coffee and it stayed down. Now come on folks and she started shouting. She was no longer [screaming] looking for her healing. She was looking at her healing. [cheering] And she ran up the street and she went to her friend's house and she was in there shaking the seats. She was in there shaking the sheets. They said, "What's wrong?" She said, "I got up this morning and I looked in the mirror and the gorder was completely gone." The gorder was completely gone. Oh, come on, saints. Are you hearing me? That's the way the rapture is going to be for you one of these mornings. [applause and cheering] You're going to wake up and you're going to go in the mirror and you're going to start combing your hair and brother Isaac, there's going to be a head full of hair. Oh, glory. You're going to look in the mirror and you're going to see your loved ones in one sense. [cheering] &gt;&gt; He said, "What was it?" The sixth sense was catching it. &gt;&gt; Have I got a few more minutes? Go ahead. Go ahead. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Do you see what happens to [laughter] a believer? &gt;&gt; The sixth sense, &gt;&gt; he says, "And the Holy Spirit stands side by side." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit was speaking &gt;&gt; and the six sense was a many. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; A [screaming] prophet made a forecast. When the word is preached, there will be somebody believe it. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know if it's possible, but but can you give me 2 Corinthians 4 and:e 7 on the on the screen? If it's possible, it's a very powerful scripture. I want I want to share something with you. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Paul says this 1 Corinthian or 2 Corinthians 4:7, "But we have &gt;&gt; not we shall." &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's read it together. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; But we have &gt;&gt; this treasure. What treasure? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Another sense. &gt;&gt; We have this treasure where &gt;&gt; in theophanes &gt;&gt; in glorified bodies. We've had this treasure in earth and vessels. Come on, folks. You're in an earthn vessel right now. &gt;&gt; But here it is. That the excellency, &gt;&gt; come on. I'm not a crazy man. What does spiritual discernment do? It gives you the ability to discern between the excellenc I just made up a word. And the defect of it. &gt;&gt; We have this treasure in earthn vessels. that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. &gt;&gt; Give me the next verse. [screaming] But we have this treasure &gt;&gt; in earthn vessels &gt;&gt; yet not distressed. &gt;&gt; We are perplexed but not in despair. Next verse. &gt;&gt; We are persecuted &gt;&gt; but not forsaken. We are cast down [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; but not destroyed. [screaming] I'm not talking about a sinless perfection. I'm talking about a word perfection by the power of God. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Next verse. &gt;&gt; Always bearing about in the body of the dy Lord Jesus that the life [screaming] also of Jesus &gt;&gt; might be made manifest in our body. Now, now go back to verse eight. &gt;&gt; Now I want to read it like this. Is this okay? In one sense we are troubled on every side, &gt;&gt; but in another sense we're not distressed. &gt;&gt; In one sense we are perplexed, &gt;&gt; but in another sense we're not in despair. &gt;&gt; Next verse. In one sense we are persecuted, but in another sense we are not forsaken. Woo. &gt;&gt; In one sense, we are cast down, but in another sense, we are [screaming] not destroyed. &gt;&gt; Well, I want to tell that devil this morning, come hell or high water, you will never destroy the bride [screaming] of Jesus Christ. She is living by a vindicated forecast. [cheering] What are we doing here this morning? We are partaking of the oracles of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to I want to bring this down to you. When this power has come into you, &gt;&gt; it will release an authority &gt;&gt; to call things present tense. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet's only looking off to see something he's talking about what he's looking at. He ain't thinking about here and what you look like now. He's looking at what it's going to be. And when he speaks that, if it's in the word of the Lord, &gt;&gt; it's already been spoke. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you ready for this? &gt;&gt; And there's nothing in the world can stop it. &gt;&gt; See, when the when the when God sends a message to the age, that message be that message becomes the leadership of the age. Then the elect of the age follows that leadership of the age. &gt;&gt; Reb said only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to the age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church. &gt;&gt; The message is then broadcast &gt;&gt; to all. &gt;&gt; Another word for forecast is broadcast. But though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message, &gt;&gt; that message is received individually &gt;&gt; by only a certain qualified group &gt;&gt; in a certain way. &gt;&gt; Each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger. Those who hear &gt;&gt; are not getting their own private revelation. &gt;&gt; Nor is a group getting their collective revelation. But each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I find it amazing that forecast, they're usually in paper form or in radio form. Right. &gt;&gt; Our spiritual forecast &gt;&gt; has come to us &gt;&gt; in book form. &gt;&gt; William Mary and Brandham's spoken word books. &gt;&gt; And tape form, &gt;&gt; audio and &gt;&gt; Oh, can I can I bring it on down? Look at this word broadcast. It means to transmit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It means to scatter seed. &gt;&gt; Look here. Parable of the sewer and the seed. A swer went forth to sow and the seed is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now come on brother since book spoke words original seed. He said the messenger of Malachi 4. He will plant the seed of the entire Bible plumbed from the serpent to the messenger in the former reign. He will then be rejected by the nomination as his forefather John and Elijah as was spoken by our Lord. Listen what he says here. I pray this is okay. I'm going somewhere. &gt;&gt; The events that we see taking place is absolutely showed in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, now come on folks. I believe that the message is in between the lines. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But make sure what you're getting between the lines is coming from what's on the lines. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We think we're all out of cater, but we're not. The Bible is a different book from any other sacred book. &gt;&gt; There's no book like the Bible because it's Bible. It's God in word form. And any seed will bring forth its kind if it's in the right condition in the right atmosphere. He said, "Now listen, this book of prophecy, it's foretelling future events." He said, "Now that's why I'm going everywhere I can going to this corner sewing seeds and over here sewing seeds and over here sew and sew a few seeds. I know the fowls of the air will gather many of them up and some of them choke and so forth, but there might be a few in there come up too, you know. So, let's just sew the seed is the main thing. &gt;&gt; Now, if we'll quit trying to separate and get back to preaching. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just sew the seed. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, how many knows the prophet God said, and I know I'm slowing down, but I'm doing this on purpose. He said, "There's been three seeds sown." &gt;&gt; There was a denominational seed. It was sown by Billy Graham. There was a Pentecostal seed. It was swed by Oral Roberts. He said, "But then there was a word seed." &gt;&gt; Now, come on, folks. The prophet of God [screaming] is not bringing you a reformation. He's bringing a message. And it's the calling out of the bride. It's the shout of First Thessalonians 4. Anybody tells you you got to hear them to go on the rapture, I'm not trying to be mean. They're a liar. [applause] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. Sometime or another, we're going to get some gumption about us and get a backbone and do like the Bible said. When they begin to say things that Paul said, and they knew Paul didn't say it, there were men that stood up and said, "That's not what Paul said." And I think we ought to get some Christians. It's got some courage about them. And when somebody begins to try to build a kingdom and a concentration camp to lead God's bride into, somebody ought to stand up and say, "That's [snorts] not what William Brandham taught." [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to show you something. Billy Graham, &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere. Okay. &gt;&gt; He swed a denominational seed. &gt;&gt; And I heard one of his sermons the other day and I and you know what he said? &gt;&gt; He said, "I feel &gt;&gt; God is moving &gt;&gt; all over the world." &gt;&gt; I I did time and did a study. &gt;&gt; He said, "I feel God is moving all over the world calling souls." &gt;&gt; I went listen to Oral Roberts &gt;&gt; and I watched him in a service. You know what he did? &gt;&gt; He got up and said, "Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I feel God &gt;&gt; is moving in this building somewhere." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But then I went listen to brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; You know what he didn't say? He didn't say, "I feel God is moving all over the world." He didn't just say, "I feel God is moving somewhere in this building." But he stood on a platform and said, "The God of this Bible is not three feet from where I'm standing from." Do you see? It was a dispensational change. It was going from saying there's something coming to saying this, here's my ministry to declare him, he is here. [cheering] that I don't need some man to come along and tell me where God is. I've already heard the shout of first Thessalonians 4. I've already heard, brother Gideon, I've already heard the voice of the seventh angel. He is here. [cheering] I tell you today, in the name of the Lord, he's here right now. The same God that was with William Brandon. The same God that was in Sabino Canyon is right here in Headstone Tabernacle this morning. He's here. My faith declares he's here. He's here to heal. He's here to save. He's here to deliver. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I'm not seeking signs. &gt;&gt; I've recognized the sign. I'm not looking for a move of God. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at a move of God. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; I'm not in a horse and buddy. &gt;&gt; I'm not in a car. &gt;&gt; I'm not in an airplane. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going I'm going to tie this up right here. &gt;&gt; I've seen the forecast. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, preacher, &gt;&gt; you've been preaching on the forecast for an hour nearly &gt;&gt; or over, &gt;&gt; and you ain't said nothing about blood moons and You ain't said nothing about Russia. &gt;&gt; And you ain't &gt;&gt; You a You ain't said nothing about Sodom laws. And you ain't said nothing about &gt;&gt; what's like I I I'm going to get in trouble. I was preaching in a meeting one time and I had the last service in the meeting and a brother come to me and he said this. He said, "I feel sorry for you." I said, "Why you feel sorry for me?" He said, "Well," he said, "you got to preach after all these preachers and in this meeting." I said, "Oh, I studied, Brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; I I Brother Bram's got something to say and I'll say what he said. Not trying to be arrogant. I'm just I'm an eagle." So, I'm I'm talking to this guy and he said, "Well, let me tell you something to preach." I said, "Okay." He said, "Why don't you?" He said, "The whole nobody's preached on hell." I said, "Yeah." He said, 'Why don't you preach on hell? I said, 'Well, brother, I normally I normally try to preach on what I'm studying by inspiration, and &gt;&gt; I ain't never really studied much on hell. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Why ain't you study on hell?" I said, "Cuz I ain't going there. [applause] Come on. Before I come to Trinidad, I begin to study on things about Trinidad. I wanted to know what the weather was like. I looked at the forecast. I want to know the I begin look because it's something pertaining to me. Come on, church. I'm not going to waste my time studying on hell. I didn't come from hell and I'm not going to hell. I'm going to study on the future hope. I'm going to study on the rapture. I'm going to study on the revelation that's going to release the Elohim revelation. It's going to change my body. Come on, church. I'm not looking at the world's forecast. It don't pertain to me. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I want to close by saying this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't have a message without a messenger. &gt;&gt; You can't have a prophet a prophecy without a prophet. &gt;&gt; And you can't have a forecast without a weatherman. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can I can I say something to you? &gt;&gt; I've got it in notes, but I'm just going to preach it to you. Our prophet stood there. And brother Theo, I'm I'm not making light of the things he revealed, right, &gt;&gt; concerning end time events. I I study those things. I'm not I'm just not That's how do I say it? It's not my food. &gt;&gt; I study those things, but it's not my food. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, let me say something to you here. &gt;&gt; He stood there and he said, "The world is falling apart." Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said Sodom and Gomorrah has returned. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; He said that there's a there's a there'll come a time that the spirit of perversion will be protected by Sodom law. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; He said, "There'll come a time that there'll be a persecution come upon the bride." And and I said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; He taught about the World Council of Churches. And I said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; He taught about the Ecumenical Council, and I said, "Amen." But see, this is not a negative vision for the bride. &gt;&gt; Our strength is not coming from persecution. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Our strength is coming from the revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Now, yes, I know persecution causes people to get stronger, but the bride strength &gt;&gt; is coming from the revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm studying along and he says there'll be darkness upon the earth. And then he says there'll be gross darkness on the people. &gt;&gt; And saints, I don't fit in there anywhere. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I don't fit in in there anywhere. &gt;&gt; I can't find my place in there. So, I keep on listening. And then I hear him say, "But arise and shine, [cheering] for thy light [screaming] has come and the glory of the Lord has arisen upon me." I said, "Oh, there it is. That's where I'm at." Amen. There's there's confusion upon me out of sin. The world has fallen apart. You want to talk about Russia? Let's talk about Russia. I heard a prophet say this. Before one bomb ever hits this land, I'll be seated. At the marriage supper of the lamb, I've already heard the forecast. It's not a negative forecast. It's not a doom and gloom &gt;&gt; forecast. &gt;&gt; There's a message. The modern events that are happening &gt;&gt; are made clear &gt;&gt; by the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Will you stand to your feet with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The opening of the word &gt;&gt; is the only thing &gt;&gt; that could cause us to see &gt;&gt; that it's happening. &gt;&gt; Will you say this with me? It's happening. &gt;&gt; It's happening. &gt;&gt; That felt good. &gt;&gt; It's happening. It's happening. [snorts] &gt;&gt; What the Pentecostal said was going to happen. &gt;&gt; A prophet by the word seed stood there and said, &gt;&gt; "It's happening &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord." &gt;&gt; The evening time message is here. &gt;&gt; Y'all like to study your Bibles? &gt;&gt; Isaiah 64 prophesied something. You know what it said, brother Gideon? It said that there were secret things of God &gt;&gt; that had not entered the heart of man. &gt;&gt; Paul come along in 2 Corinthians 2, I believe it is, and picked it up or 1 Corinthians 2 and begin to read it and he began to say, "Now the things that have not entered into the heart of man." &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; He says, "But are now." &gt;&gt; See what was happening? The prophecy of Isaiah was made was being made clear. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "God gives a revelation. He never changes it. He adds to it &gt;&gt; to make it more clear. Right? &gt;&gt; So Isaiah prophesied of it. Paul comes along and he says these words, beautiful. He says, "But it is now revealed by the spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The things which were hid have now entered in the heart of the believers by the revelation of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now folks, I can't stop there. I got to read all the forecast. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham comes along and says these words. He says, "God's great mystery, the eternal God had as a mystery, has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's given right down to his church. &gt;&gt; What was once in God's mind &gt;&gt; is now in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Church of the living God. Who else is to come? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; None other but our Lord &gt;&gt; himself. Isaiah prophesied of it. Paul wrote about it. The seventh angel stood on a platform and identified what was in God's mind &gt;&gt; is now in God's church. &gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question today? &gt;&gt; What will you do with this Jesus &gt;&gt; called Christ? &gt;&gt; What will you do with this revelation? &gt;&gt; Will you make it a bunch of buzzwords? Will you make it a bunch of high points? Or will you be a will you be a son of God that'll dig in there? Amen. &gt;&gt; And get an anchor &gt;&gt; and get a place to stand. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is our vision. I love this. I'm I've got a bunch of stuff and I'm out of time. Y'all are just a joy to preach to. &gt;&gt; You might not have felt it. &gt;&gt; I don't know about that. He says, "But it's here anyhow." &gt;&gt; Whether you feel it or not. Let's give God thanks for it. &gt;&gt; It's here anyhow. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; Brother Theo, I'll get some I'll get some Trinidadian currency. Can I Can I buy five minutes &gt;&gt; real quick? I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God don't want you living in Leosa &gt;&gt; blinded. He don't want you living wondering what's going to happen. Folks, we have been posted by the word of life. &gt;&gt; I tell you something beautiful. I was just studying this this morning. Brother said this. He said, "A woman come to me and she had dreamed a dream." He said, "The devil come to her in the dream making funny faces and screamed out these words, I got you now." And she said something just happened to me. I just jumped up out of the bed and I said, "Get out of here, devil, in the name of Jesus." &gt;&gt; And [snorts] I started running him. &gt;&gt; See, under Moses, they were on the defense. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The enemy chased them to the Red Sea. But under Joshua, they was on the offense. &gt;&gt; That's right. [applause] &gt;&gt; They went from the enemy chasing them. She said, "I run him out of the house and said, I don't understand." But then the Holy Spirit being present give the interpretation. And just little after that, her husband had a heart attack. And when she seen her husband fall, he was an aged man, heavy. His hands went back and his eyes said, "Death come to take him." But God wasn't through with him. &gt;&gt; And that [screaming] little woman's faith, &gt;&gt; I want to preach a sermon on that one day. That little woman's faith, it raised up and said, "I won't stand for it. I [screaming] call for his life in the name of Jesus Christ." He got well. [applause] [cheering] In one sense, she was a little woman, but in another sense, she was a daughter of Abraham with the faith of Abraham, authority over every devil. [applause] But then he said, "What happened?" He said, "In that crucial moment," he said that little six sense rose up and give her faith. &gt;&gt; He said, "God give the interpretation. The devil come to get your husband, but you, the power of God stopped him. She began screaming." That's what happened. Now I love what he says. He said, "Now see, now that goes into grace. &gt;&gt; Give her the dream, not even know it, not even knowing what it was. &gt;&gt; But God is thankful and loyal anyhow to keep his people posted. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; There's no devil." Brother, the devil hates this bride. &gt;&gt; She cannot be &gt;&gt; deceived. &gt;&gt; Listen, there is a prophetic grace that's come to you &gt;&gt; in the hour that Jesus Christ would be revealed. How many believe that revelations give you authority? &gt;&gt; How many raise your hands right now and say, "I surrender to the message." &gt;&gt; I surrender to the headship of the word. &gt;&gt; I surrender to the power that has been brought back into the church. Is this what'll bring the power of God back in the church? Yes, sir, brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; It's the opening of them seven seals. &gt;&gt; It's the revealing of them thunders. It's that opening of the word. &gt;&gt; It's the power of God in the bride standing today calling these things present tense. &gt;&gt; It's your flesh coming subject to the word. &gt;&gt; Will you bow your hearts with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Maybe we could just play that only belief softly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's your faith. &gt;&gt; Believing what God said and accepting what God said. &gt;&gt; Listen, you're not going to take the rapture by feelings. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you all something this morning. On the morning of the rapture, you might wake up and it might be the lowest you've ever felt in your entire life. You might feel the most unsaved, the most unqualified, the most unworthy. And in just a few moments, the power of God begin to change your body &gt;&gt; because you will not take this rapture by feelings. &gt;&gt; You will take it by the word. &gt;&gt; As you receive the word, you receive the word, you become the word. &gt;&gt; I wonder right now how many say, Lord, bring this flesh under subjection to the word of life. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want the treasure to be in this earthn vessel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want the power of God &gt;&gt; to manifest its life. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Through my body. Almighty God, &gt;&gt; we stand here upon this platform today speaking the word of truth [music] &gt;&gt; that has been revealed by the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Transmitted through the voice of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Father, not bringing confusion, but bringing clarity. &gt;&gt; Not bringing misunderstandings, but bringing revelation. &gt;&gt; Not bringing personality, but bringing the personal presence of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; among the church of the living God. Father, these are your children. These are your eagles. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Satan is doing everything he can to paralyze the faith of this generation. &gt;&gt; Men have invaded pullpits uncalled, unqualified. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Have not met the pillar of fire. Have not met the God of this message, have sat somewhere and met an intellectual spirit, which is a deceiving spirit. &gt;&gt; And has walked to a pullpit and has tried to deceive people right out of their inherited promises by the revelation of this word. But Father, I stand here today and I I declare war on every devil in hell. &gt;&gt; I declare war on every spirit of unbelief. &gt;&gt; I declare war on every man-made interpretation that would the faith of your children and would hinder them from walking in the promises of God in this hour. Satan, I adjure thee by the power of the Holy Spirit. We have been given a clear message with a clear understanding. We have been given the revelation recorded on books and tapes. We have been given the Bible and it's not a closed book. It's an open book. You have provided, Lord, a five-fold ministry that'll stay under what a prophet said. And Father, there's no room for man-made interpretation. There's no room for man's ideas. Lord, we rebuke every one of them today. Every tradition, Lord, every everything that has been carried over from one from one tradition to another, we rebuke it and turn loose of it today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, we have a vindicated forecast. And Lord, as you begin as a as a person begins to look at the forecast, that forecast begins to affect their actions. As I as I begin to come on this trip, I begin to pack my suitcase by the [music] forecast. I begin to think about things by the forecast. Oh God, the forecast [music] affects what we wear. It affects the places we go. It affects the things we say. It affects the things we do. Almighty God, may the forecast of the message of the hour, may it begin to affect every one of your children. If they're wearing things contrary to the forecast, may they change it to fit the forecast. If they're believing things contrary to the forecast, may they throw it away today. And may they get a hold of these searching, May they get a hold of these uncarchable riches. May they get a hold of these untapped resources. May they begin to tap into it. May they begin to search into it. May they begin to receive understanding and revelation. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray. Raise your hands all over the building and thank God for the forecast. Thank God you got something to live by. Thank God you got something to raise your babies by. Thank God you got something to face difficult times [music] by. Thank God he sent you a message to keep you posted in the hour that you're living in. Thank you. Thank you. [music] Thank you.
