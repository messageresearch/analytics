[39:23] shore. I'm living on the shore. I'm
[39:27] living on the shore.
[39:29] I'm living where the healing baters
[39:32] flow.
[39:36] Living on the shore.
[39:39] Living on the shore.
[39:42] I'm living where healing waters flow.
[39:46] I'm living on the shore. My Lord, I'm
[39:48] living on the shore. Oh, living on the
[39:52] shore.
[39:54] I'm living where healing waters flow.
[39:59] Well, we are living on the shore.
[40:04] Living on the shore. We are living well.
[40:09] Oh, glory to God. It's hunger tonight.
[40:11] Living on the shore. We are living on
[40:14] the shore, my Lord. Living on the shore.
[40:19] We are living when the healing waters
[40:22] flow.
[40:24] My Lord. My Lord. Living on the shore.
[40:29] Living on the shore.
[40:32] Living where healing waters flow.
[40:38] We want to turn our Bibles tonight to
[40:40] St. John chapter 6, reading verse 63,
[40:43] one verse there,
[40:46] and St. John chapter 4, reading verse
[40:49] 20- 24. So reading St. John chapter 6
[40:53] reading verse 63. It is spirit that
[40:55] quickenth the flesh profitth nothing.
[40:59] The words that I speak unto you they are
[41:02] spirit
[41:03] and they are life. It's in John 4.
[41:07] Reading from verse 20.
[41:13] This is Jesus speaking to the woman at
[41:15] the well and she say all fathers worship
[41:18] in this mountain and he say that
[41:20] Jerusalem
[41:22] is the place where men ought to worship.
[41:25] And Jesus says unto her woman may leave
[41:28] me the hour cometh when ye shall neither
[41:31] in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[41:34] worship the father. See he was killing
[41:36] this. You have to be in this place.
[41:39] You worship, you know not what we know
[41:42] what we worship for salvation of the is
[41:44] of the Jews. But the hour cometh and now
[41:47] is when the true worshippers,
[41:50] watch that word true now, shall worship
[41:53] the Father in spirit and in truth. For
[41:56] the Father seeketh such to worship him.
[41:59] God is a spirit and they that worship
[42:01] him must worship him in spirit and in
[42:04] truth. Let's bow our heads. Father God,
[42:06] we thank you for your word tonight and I
[42:08] pray you come and interpret the word to
[42:10] the hearts and lives of your children.
[42:12] Speak to us by your word and may be
[42:14] transformational tonight. We ask in
[42:15] Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated.
[42:18] Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[42:26] Right.
[42:28] Okay. So tonight have a title true
[42:31] worship by the mechanics and dynamics
[42:34] together.
[42:36] And I have an inspiration. You don't
[42:37] have to know the mechanics. Just know
[42:39] the dynamics. That's actually a quote
[42:42] from brother Baron. You don't have to
[42:43] know the mechanics. Just could you
[42:45] imagine after all these years coming
[42:48] down hearing the teaching of the word,
[42:49] the preaching of the word, the unfolding
[42:51] of the word only to discover now you
[42:52] don't have to know the mechanics. You
[42:54] have to know the dynamics. Amen. All
[42:57] right. So God is a spirit.
[43:01] God is a spirit. Amen. And they that
[43:03] worship him must worship him in spirit
[43:04] and in truth. Now God is the object of
[43:06] worship. So for him to be God, it must
[43:08] have worippers. People worshiping all
[43:11] kind of gods. Now all kind of deities,
[43:13] all kind of things they worshiping. But
[43:14] God is a spirit. Isn't that right? So
[43:18] brother Abraham said, "May I stop here a
[43:19] minute and say I believe that the people
[43:21] are in preparation for the last great
[43:24] destruction this world will ever know."
[43:26] I believe we at the end. You can speak
[43:29] to people. You could put Billy Graham in
[43:30] every city in United States. They will
[43:32] drink whiskey, smoke cigarettes, laugh
[43:34] at you. Everything else, they are in the
[43:36] spirit of the last days.
[43:40] And God
[43:42] cannot send destruction
[43:44] before the people are in the spirit for
[43:47] destruction. Amen. So this thing about
[43:50] rain, latter rain, this thing about
[43:53] dynamics affects everything. Amen.
[43:56] That's why the prophet said the the the
[43:58] United Nation is waiting for the
[44:00] dynamics to come to enforce the laws.
[44:04] So, so like the vision Abraham had of a
[44:07] man planting seeds and everybody crying
[44:08] for rain. The old seeds all kind of
[44:10] contrary seeds, they're waiting for rain
[44:12] to manifest. So, this dynamics or spirit
[44:15] will bring forth every seed after its
[44:18] kind.
[44:21] Do you get it now? So, dynamics is
[44:23] coming. It is guaranteed. Dynamics is
[44:27] not the issue. It's what seed is there.
[44:31] So don't worry about dynamics. I want to
[44:34] show you tonight that you should be
[44:35] convinced tonight. This thing really
[44:36] coming. No man could stop it. No
[44:39] preacher man, no bishop man, no church
[44:41] man, no intellectual man, no message
[44:44] man, no message pope man, nobody will
[44:47] stop the dynamics of the spirit that is
[44:50] prophesied to be over the bride and over
[44:53] you.
[44:56] You see what I did there? Not just over
[44:58] the bride, over you. We could see it for
[45:00] over the bride, but when you're talking
[45:01] about over you is a problem because you
[45:04] are to believe it had to come over you.
[45:07] Just as Jesus said it, the spirit of the
[45:08] Lord is upon me. Not everybody is upon
[45:11] me for he had anointed me to bring good
[45:14] tidings. Hallelujah. You have to see it
[45:17] for yourself. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[45:19] that the spirit of God will come upon
[45:20] you, not upon the pastor and brother
[45:23] Tio. No, no. Upon you.
[45:27] [Music]
[45:29] So catch this. The people themselves
[45:31] have to be in a certain spirit before
[45:32] they could be destroyed. He call it the
[45:35] spirit of destruction.
[45:36] [Music]
[45:38] God never destroy anything. Man always
[45:40] destroys himself. So with that spirit,
[45:42] it brings, attracts, it draws
[45:45] destruction.
[45:46] And what do you think draw the Holy
[45:48] Ghost?
[45:49] The lamb spirit. Amen. It brings, it
[45:52] draws, it attracts the Holy Ghost. There
[45:55] are something that attracts the Holy
[45:56] Ghost and there's something that doesn't
[45:57] attract the Holy Ghost.
[46:03] We have got to get in the spirit of the
[46:05] last days. When the last days are here,
[46:09] you go to a dance hall, you get into the
[46:11] spirit of dancing or you won't dance.
[46:13] You go to the church, you get in the
[46:15] spirit of worship before you can
[46:16] worship.
[46:18] So, it's a spirit. Somebody come grumpy.
[46:20] They come, they fed up, they can't make
[46:21] it no more. They have no place to go.
[46:22] And they come here, they sour. They call
[46:24] them sours like a lemon. They come to
[46:26] worship. They come to disturb the
[46:28] service. Best they stay home. When you
[46:30] come, you come to worship. You come to
[46:32] shift modes from the job, from the home,
[46:36] from what you see on the streets, from
[46:38] the maxi, the taxi, the bus, whatever.
[46:40] You shift modes all together. Family
[46:42] problems and you're feeling dong and
[46:44] you're feeling depressed and you're
[46:45] feeling upset. All of that. You shift
[46:47] that out. You have to be able to do
[46:48] that.
[46:51] When you walk out of your house,
[46:52] everything inside your house, it stay
[46:54] right there. You're going to pray.
[46:55] You're going to praise. You go into the
[46:57] house. You looking for fire to fall
[46:59] inside your house. When you out of your
[47:00] house, you was the part of the problem
[47:03] in your own house.
[47:06] Let me say it again. I don't know how
[47:08] that come. That come. You might be the
[47:09] problem yourself when you walk out the
[47:11] house different because you yourself is
[47:13] a problem. So it's good for you to be
[47:15] here tonight because you can get your
[47:17] problem solved and when you go back to
[47:19] the house something different I didn't
[47:21] know that come that just come out.
[47:24] Hallelujah. That was somebody inside.
[47:25] Yeah know you yourself is the problem in
[47:28] your own house. Oh God you're looking
[47:30] for the problem. Look at the problem.
[47:31] You are the problem. Solve you the
[47:33] problem solve. Oh Lord I shall solve you
[47:36] the problem solve. Solve you the quarrel
[47:38] solve. Didn't expect that. Don't know
[47:40] where it come from but it's coming along
[47:42] the pipe. Hallelujah. So let's let's go.
[47:46] The world has got to get in the spirit
[47:49] of the last days before the last days
[47:53] can come. And we are in the spirit of
[47:56] the last days. And God promised that
[47:59] these things would be here. And that is
[48:01] what we got. We're in the last days. And
[48:03] men and women are sitting asleep and
[48:05] don't realize it.
[48:08] If we don't get contact with the spirit,
[48:10] the last days we're in trouble. Here's
[48:12] why. Jesus said they eat, they drank,
[48:14] they bought, they sold, they given and
[48:15] married until
[48:17] that means normal living. Nothing. No
[48:20] drama. We seen drama. We seen Israel and
[48:23] Iran. We seen Iraq. Um um um Ukraine and
[48:25] Russia. We seen drama around
[48:27] earthquakes, floods. We seen drama
[48:29] around and people still natural eating
[48:32] drinking life that happen. Hey, go a
[48:34] prophet. You know what I mean?
[48:38] We need to see more of the spirit. We
[48:41] want to see the operation of the spirit.
[48:43] God give us the hungering for that.
[48:48] Got a hunger for that. You know, listen
[48:50] to brother Brana. You know, there's
[48:52] something about when we see Jesus do
[48:54] things and can know it's him. Now note,
[48:58] he's not talking about service, sermons,
[49:00] messages. He's talking about Jesus doing
[49:02] things. Watch this. Now, nothing else
[49:05] could do it but him. When we get
[49:07] together, everybody want to testify.
[49:09] Everybody wants to say something, they
[49:11] want to talk about it. You can have a
[49:13] revival at your church. The pastor can
[49:14] speak a marvelous message or evangelist
[49:16] or whoever it might be. You can see some
[49:18] certain things take place. But or you
[49:21] can see some certain things takes place.
[49:23] Something in the neighborhood. Someone
[49:24] was healed. The neighbors get together
[49:27] and talk about it. How marvelous was you
[49:30] there? You should have seen it. It was
[49:32] the most outstanding thing. There is
[49:34] something about the works of God that
[49:36] thrills my heart more than anything else
[49:38] that happened. Amen. So we could preach
[49:40] till we blew in the face. Preach till
[49:42] all the hair we have fall off. That is
[49:44] cannot be compared with when God begin
[49:46] to do and perform and act. You're
[49:51] talking about signs and wonders and
[49:53] miracles. The message don't want to talk
[49:55] about it, but I'm going to talk about
[49:56] it. It's a big difference from preaching
[49:59] and teaching and God doing and working
[50:02] and manifesting and declaring and
[50:04] confirming and vindicating.
[50:07] [Applause]
[50:07] [Music]
[50:10] Glory. God is a spirit. He has to walk
[50:14] through someone. You have to walk
[50:16] through somebody. You have to walk
[50:17] through some vessel. But God is a
[50:19] spirit. And the only way to see him is
[50:21] to see his works.
[50:23] After he reveal himself by his word, he
[50:25] has to come and show his works.
[50:29] Glory to God. Come on, write with me
[50:30] now. I have a scripture for you now. And
[50:32] the Lord himself, not some pastor, not
[50:35] some bishop. The Lord himself went
[50:38] everywhere with them confirming the word
[50:42] that they were teaching, preaching,
[50:44] evangelizing, confirming that word with
[50:47] signs, with wonders, with miracles, not
[50:51] with more mysteries, not with more
[50:53] unfolding and revealing and talking for
[50:56] four, five, 600 hours.
[50:59] The Lord himself, not pastor this and
[51:02] brother this and somebody from foreign.
[51:06] Can we start it tonight? You know, give
[51:08] the Lord some praises. The Lord himself.
[51:12] Hallelujah. Not another mighty angel,
[51:15] not some other angel. The Lord himself
[51:19] you Jehovah. Oh, give the Lord some
[51:22] shouts in the house. That God that was
[51:24] with Moses. That God that was with
[51:27] Joshua. That God was in the early
[51:29] church.
[51:39] [Applause]
[51:40] [Music]
[51:45] [Applause]
[51:47] My wife smary, she always tells me if
[51:52] the children don't hear it, they can't
[51:53] speak it.
[51:55] If they can't speak it, they can't write
[51:56] it. It's very interesting.
[51:59] And I I keep watching with my
[52:01] grandchildren watching the unfolding of
[52:03] speech.
[52:05] And I discover so late that speech
[52:08] starts before they talk because they're
[52:10] hearing they're processing the words not
[52:14] coming out of the mouth yet but they're
[52:15] processing things. They they adding up
[52:17] things they're not looking grammar and
[52:19] verb and mixing. No, when they start to
[52:21] talk they're talking
[52:23] sometime they talk before they walk.
[52:26] But they're human being that was born
[52:29] and raised up to walk and talk and live.
[52:33] Amen. And God sees us as sons and
[52:37] daughters of God.
[52:40] It doesn't appear what we shall be. But
[52:42] we know we have the potential to be like
[52:45] him, to walk like him, to talk like him,
[52:48] to act like him. God himself has his
[52:51] expectation of us. So don't sit here and
[52:54] just look at me like you don't know what
[52:56] I'm talking about. God himself have his
[52:59] expectation of us.
[53:04] Sometime I preach about God in his labor
[53:06] pains to bring us forth. He had labor
[53:08] pains. Hallelujah.
[53:13] So brother Baron says there is something
[53:15] about the works of God that thrills
[53:18] man's heart more than anything else that
[53:21] happens.
[53:22] It's just an unforgettable experience
[53:25] when we come in contact with the Lord
[53:27] Jesus and see the things he does so
[53:30] great and marvelous in his ways and we
[53:32] find out that they were rejoicing over
[53:35] the works that was done in the day of
[53:36] revival and perhaps I would like us
[53:38] tonight in the same manner. Now
[53:42] we just witnessed one of the greatest
[53:43] revivals I believe that the world has
[53:45] ever seen in the last 10 and 15 10 to 15
[53:48] years. It's been a revival.
[53:51] Uh it had the Welsh revival, Moody
[53:54] revival, Billy Sunny revival, but it's
[53:56] been a worldwide sweeping of fear across
[53:59] the world. Great healing services, great
[54:03] revival fires has burnt on practically
[54:06] every hill here in the world. Right now,
[54:09] way over in the lands of Africa, and
[54:10] China, what I'm talking about, this
[54:12] gospel being preached and people are
[54:14] being healed right this very minute
[54:16] around the world.
[54:19] But now let's go. In the last few years,
[54:23] it's quiet down.
[54:26] You don't notice the enthusiasm in the
[54:29] people that used to be. Amen. Amen. I
[54:33] remember of having the privilege by the
[54:34] Holy Spirit to spearhead that revival
[54:37] that started when that angel of the Lord
[54:40] appeared on the river and said about
[54:42] many years ago and see it happen and see
[54:46] it set minister house of fire everywhere
[54:48] revival broke out. And a man claiming to
[54:52] meet angel and all kind of thing and
[54:53] nothing happening.
[54:55] Who angel is that?
[54:57] You understand what he's saying here? He
[54:59] claimed brother man that he met an angel
[55:01] and he gave a testimony considered an
[55:03] angel and when he testify about it it
[55:06] light up men's heart.
[55:08] Remember is that he alone was in his
[55:10] healing and praying for the sick you
[55:11] know it had ministers all around the
[55:12] world being anointed because this is
[55:15] what fire does. It will light you up. It
[55:18] will light your brother up. It will
[55:20] light your neighbor up. It will light
[55:21] the community up. It is a light. It's a
[55:24] fire. It's a burning. It's an experience
[55:26] that is not a talk thing. It's a living
[55:29] thing. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the
[55:31] house. Do you get it tonight?
[55:38] That why the Isuza Street Pentecostal
[55:40] revival people came from around the
[55:42] world there and went back with firemen.
[55:45] They say the anointing was so much
[55:47] blocks away from the streets, you know,
[55:48] before he even reached the church, the
[55:50] little place. Yeah. Get them. People
[55:51] fall along in the streets from the
[55:53] anointing that was in the building.
[55:56] That is the Holy Ghost. You know, there
[55:58] is no man saying he's the Holy Ghost,
[55:59] you know. That is the Holy Ghost.
[56:01] Hallelujah. Holy Ghost have nothing with
[56:02] man. Holy Spirit is Holy Spirit. Oh,
[56:05] give the Lord a shout. Jesus never even
[56:08] claimed to be the father. He said, "When
[56:10] you see me, you see the father." Oh, get
[56:12] Oh, God. Get me started tonight. Go get
[56:14] me started tonight. Hallelujah. When you
[56:16] see me, you see the father because
[56:17] you're seeing the works that the father
[56:19] does. Oh, glory to God. What is he
[56:21] saying? He said, I'm the mechanics. My
[56:23] father is the dynamics. My father is in
[56:25] me. My father is working me. My father
[56:28] is using me. Mechanic and dynamic
[56:31] together. Or give the Lord a shout in
[56:32] the house.
[56:35] Do I hear a shout
[56:37] [Applause]
[56:39] [Music]
[56:42] Jesus mechanic
[56:45] son
[56:46] spirit dynamics the power. He said the
[56:50] works that I do. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[56:52] My father work and I work also. When you
[56:55] see me, you see the father because the
[56:57] father is pushing himself. Is throwing
[57:00] out himself through me. Give the Lord a
[57:03] shout. Now when the Lord told him pick
[57:05] up a pen and write, he said by and
[57:07] through the bride will be fulfilled all.
[57:10] That mean the bride will become the
[57:12] mechanic and the spirit will mon the
[57:14] bride. The spirit will charge the bride
[57:17] and through you and by you. Glory to
[57:20] God. The power of God going to be
[57:22] loosed. The power of God will come
[57:24] forth. The power of God will manifest
[57:26] it. Give the Lord a shout. When they
[57:30] take about they shall lay hands upon the
[57:32] sick. He's talking about your hands. He
[57:35] didn't say brother T hands. He said your
[57:36] hands. They shall lay hands. That day is
[57:39] you. Oh, the Lord a shout in the house.
[57:49] [Music]
[57:54] Hallelujah. Let me read on. When the
[57:57] angel of the Lord appeared in the river
[57:59] and said that about what many years ago
[58:03] and the seat happened and seed set
[58:06] ministers had a fire everywhere revival
[58:08] broke out. Why? You could simply walk
[58:11] into a building
[58:13] and the people would just get out of
[58:15] their cuts and stretchers and walk away
[58:18] here. You didn't even have to say one
[58:21] word.
[58:23] Just being there was all it taken.
[58:27] [Music]
[58:30] Hallelujah.
[58:31] In other words, you just have to show
[58:33] up. There's some people don't like to
[58:35] show up. You just have to show up like
[58:37] you show up tonight. You just have to
[58:39] show up. Just being there, it was all
[58:43] that it took.
[58:48] I don't know about you, but I feel a
[58:50] rumbling, you know.
[58:52] I don't know about you, but I feel a
[58:53] still ring, you know. Because the bride
[58:56] had not a revival yet. It's coming. It
[58:59] coming. It coming. It's coming. Oh, give
[59:01] the Lord a shout. We can name the
[59:03] revival. We just saying revival. It's a
[59:06] bride revival. It's a seven thunder
[59:08] revival. It have a name for it.
[59:19] Give the Lord a shout. That's what we're
[59:21] here for.
[59:23] You didn't even have to say one word.
[59:30] No long talk needed. No mystery
[59:32] revelation needed. No unfolding. and and
[59:35] and and the stars and the comet coming.
[59:46] Let's continue.
[59:48] I remember one night in Vanelia,
[59:51] Illinois.
[59:53] I walked into the meeting and had no
[59:56] more been in the meeting over five
[59:58] minutes and there wasn't a feeble person
[1:00:01] around the place anywhere.
[1:00:04] wheelchairs pushed out and piled up.
[1:00:07] Blind was seeing, deaf and dumb
[1:00:09] speaking. It was simply the spirit of
[1:00:12] the Lord was present.
[1:00:14] That is what we talking about. Not no
[1:00:17] man present. But God present. God is a
[1:00:21] spirit.
[1:00:26] Preach back to me. I am preaching and
[1:00:29] you are to preach through. You are
[1:00:31] preaching when you're saying amen. You
[1:00:33] are preaching when you raise your hands.
[1:00:34] You are preaching when you're saying
[1:00:35] hallelujah. You are preaching when you
[1:00:37] bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that
[1:00:40] is within me. And I am not crazy. And we
[1:00:43] are not crazy. And we are not fanatical.
[1:00:46] And we are not Pentecostal. This is
[1:00:48] Pentecost. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:00:52] Original Pentecost.
[1:01:01] Hallelujah.
[1:01:03] Maybe my start tonight. Maybe tonight is
[1:01:06] your night. Maybe the spirit could come
[1:01:08] down and be present. Jehovah Shama.
[1:01:14] [Applause]
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:28] [Music]
[1:01:30] He said about Moses
[1:01:33] five minutes in the present of the
[1:01:35] pillar of fire. do more for Moses than
[1:01:38] 40 years in text and book and the 78 n
[1:01:43] 10th book of Moses me know that
[1:01:48] all the lectures all the education all
[1:01:51] the information that is cancelled in the
[1:01:54] presence of pillar of fire five minutes
[1:01:57] and here the prophet said he walked in
[1:01:59] there in five minutes there wasn't a
[1:02:01] feeble person anywhere wheelchairs piled
[1:02:04] up pushed
[1:02:06] Brian was seeing defund them speaking.
[1:02:08] It was simply the spirit of the Lord
[1:02:10] present. He just healed the whole group
[1:02:12] of them. Now that is when you can do
[1:02:16] something
[1:02:18] when the revival is going. Yes, sir. But
[1:02:20] let that revival die down. You could
[1:02:23] hardly listen to these words now. The
[1:02:25] people are still Christians, but they
[1:02:27] are not revived into that spirit. That
[1:02:31] what the message come to you know.
[1:02:32] They're still Christians. That's why
[1:02:34] this thing hanging over. The bride has
[1:02:36] not a revival yet.
[1:02:39] Still Christians but no revival. Still
[1:02:42] Christians but no fire. Still Christians
[1:02:44] but no enthusiasm. Still Christians but
[1:02:47] not hungering and thirsting after
[1:02:49] righteousness. Because Jesus said,
[1:02:50] "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[1:02:52] after righteousness, they shall be
[1:02:55] filled."
[1:02:56] Oh, give the Lord a shout. And God can't
[1:02:59] lie. If he said they shall be filled,
[1:03:02] they shall be filled. Who is going to be
[1:03:04] filled? They that hunger. Are you
[1:03:06] hungering tonight? Or if you're full
[1:03:08] with all kind of crap in your system,
[1:03:10] what kind of a lot of shout all kind of
[1:03:12] theology, all kind of information, all
[1:03:14] kind of cuckoo revelation from the lower
[1:03:17] pits of hell.
[1:03:22] I mean every word that be preaching this
[1:03:24] night.
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:31] The people are still Christians. They
[1:03:32] need message. I believe. I believe. But
[1:03:35] they're not revived into that spirit.
[1:03:37] Hear what he's talking about. That great
[1:03:40] atmosphere that does something.
[1:03:43] Understand? Some clown saying now we
[1:03:45] don't even need the atmosphere. Some
[1:03:47] intellectual idiot.
[1:03:52] That great atmosphere that does
[1:03:55] something.
[1:03:57] The atmosphere make the difference. A
[1:04:00] could hatch under a dog, under a pup,
[1:04:02] under a goat, anything sitting is the
[1:04:04] atmosphere. But the hatch, it had to
[1:04:06] have one hand. Once it the atmosphere is
[1:04:09] right,
[1:04:11] it will hatch.
[1:04:13] [Music]
[1:04:15] The fight tonight is to get in the
[1:04:17] atmosphere.
[1:04:21] What you think sin does? Sin messes you
[1:04:23] up and create unbelief and all kind of
[1:04:26] thing inside your system and
[1:04:28] condemnation. So you don't have the
[1:04:30] atmosphere on the inside. You don't have
[1:04:32] the atmosphere. But when that is broken,
[1:04:35] you could get into an atmosphere when
[1:04:37] anything could happen. That's what Buram
[1:04:39] says. He says milky white here, anything
[1:04:41] could happen. He was talking about an
[1:04:43] atmosphere. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:04:46] Give the Lord a shout. I'm excited
[1:04:48] tonight. He said, "You know what I'm
[1:04:49] waiting on? I'm waiting on the angel of
[1:04:51] the Lord." And he's waiting. He is
[1:04:53] talking. All of a sudden, he is here.
[1:04:56] What is here? A atmosphere. Oh, can the
[1:04:59] Lord are shouting the house?
[1:05:08] You may be seated.
[1:05:10] And after brother Brandham
[1:05:12] connected Billy Paul with the angel of
[1:05:14] the Lord, Billy Paul testimony was he
[1:05:16] always knew When the angel walked in to
[1:05:20] the building always knew that it brought
[1:05:24] a presence. Another type of the angel of
[1:05:27] his presence. Who give the Lord some
[1:05:29] pres
[1:05:31] when he comes to bring a presence with
[1:05:33] him? Not the presence of the pulpit man
[1:05:36] or the triny man. Triny man.
[1:05:40] That's why he says,
[1:05:42] "And then we'll be worshiping the living
[1:05:45] Christ, him moving in and out among us."
[1:05:49] Talking about the seven thunders. Then
[1:05:51] you'll be worshiping the living Christ.
[1:05:53] Him moving. So there's a prophecy
[1:05:54] hanging over you that you will come into
[1:05:56] true worship. True worshippers in the
[1:05:59] last days. We couldn't have it because
[1:06:00] we didn't have all the truth. So God
[1:06:02] sent a prophet to bring all the truth.
[1:06:04] That we can worship in spirit and in
[1:06:06] truth. We have the truth, but where is
[1:06:07] the spirit? Oh, give the Lord some
[1:06:09] praises tonight. Help me preach tonight.
[1:06:11] Glory to God. I say brother going mad.
[1:06:14] We have truth. We have books and tapes.
[1:06:16] Seven seals. How seven church ages. All
[1:06:19] kind of messages that how much message
[1:06:21] the prophet have? We have the truth. But
[1:06:22] where's the spirit?
[1:06:26] I will get it. You know, he says I'm a
[1:06:28] spirit and no truth. And I'm a truth and
[1:06:31] no spirit.
[1:06:35] Did you get it? Yes, I'll read it for
[1:06:37] you just now. Some have spirit and no
[1:06:39] truth.
[1:06:41] Them shut down the whole church. Must
[1:06:43] have the whole church. And some have
[1:06:45] truth and no spirit. I think I think
[1:06:48] they have more they have more of them
[1:06:50] who have truth but no spirit. Yeah, they
[1:06:53] have a lot of letter letter.
[1:06:56] They could preach a letter as long as
[1:06:58] they could but the letter still killing.
[1:07:00] Paul say the letter killth him but the
[1:07:04] spirit giveth life. But we should know
[1:07:07] that because Jesus said, "The words that
[1:07:09] I speak unto you, they are spirit and
[1:07:12] they are life." So it wasn't just words
[1:07:14] Jesus talking. He knew he was talking
[1:07:17] spirit. Hallelujah. When Peter was
[1:07:20] preaching in Cornelius's house, it
[1:07:21] wasn't just words he was talking. He was
[1:07:23] talking spirit. So when while Peter
[1:07:26] spake these words, the spirit fell upon
[1:07:28] them that heard the word dynamics and
[1:07:30] mechanics together. Something have to
[1:07:33] shake. When dynamics and mechanics come
[1:07:36] together. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[1:07:38] tonight. What is that coming together
[1:07:40] for you tonight? What is that coming
[1:07:42] upon your life tonight? Dynamics and
[1:07:44] mechanics together. All the time and
[1:07:46] mechanics one way, spirit one way. But
[1:07:48] once we get it together, praise God,
[1:07:50] anything can happen.
[1:07:56] When when you say when brother Brown
[1:07:59] finish preach, he say he's waiting,
[1:08:01] right? And the angel come and the spirit
[1:08:04] is there. He said, "I take every spirit
[1:08:07] under my control." So he's speaking with
[1:08:10] authority because he know he have
[1:08:12] angelic backups for what he's about to
[1:08:14] do. He's about to challenge hell and
[1:08:16] Satan's kingdom in the form of
[1:08:18] sicknesses and disease that is sitting
[1:08:20] among a thousand people, 10,000 people,
[1:08:22] 20,000 people. Understand this. If it's
[1:08:24] 20,000 people there, you have about
[1:08:25] 20,000 n 19,000 devils down there. You
[1:08:28] know, maybe you never see it. People
[1:08:31] sitting down with all kind of these
[1:08:32] outrighters this that as devils and
[1:08:34] demons you know there sickness and
[1:08:35] diseases devils. So people sit down and
[1:08:38] say but devil saying no in your flesh in
[1:08:41] your body sometime in your spirit in
[1:08:44] your mind your soul devils laying there
[1:08:48] and with the authority of God he come to
[1:08:50] cast them out
[1:08:52] [Applause]
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:53] and as devils leave they claim the
[1:08:55] healing they claim the victory they get
[1:08:58] the breakthrough because devils are
[1:08:59] being cast out by the word itself
[1:09:02] slamming them
[1:09:03] [Applause]
[1:09:05] [Music]
[1:09:09] Hallelujah.
[1:09:13] So the people that kill Christians will
[1:09:15] not revive
[1:09:17] into that spirit.
[1:09:19] The that great atmosphere. So that
[1:09:22] spirit we identifying it here by what
[1:09:25] the prophet is that great atmosphere
[1:09:27] that does something. If the atmosphere
[1:09:30] is not there, the preacher to do
[1:09:31] something. Yes. Crack jokes.
[1:09:36] Re reveal mysteries that the prophet
[1:09:37] didn't reveal. Stimulate the gray matter
[1:09:40] in front or behind
[1:09:42] people. The Bible talk about not uh
[1:09:45] silly women laden with diverse lust ever
[1:09:50] learning never coming to you know the
[1:09:52] truth but they learning. They have books
[1:09:54] they have notebooks. They're writing
[1:09:56] everything else. They could talk back
[1:09:57] out what the preacher say but they
[1:09:59] answering back and root to their
[1:10:00] husband. There's no truth that say
[1:10:02] respect your husband.
[1:10:07] I don't expect much amen on that. But
[1:10:10] still the truth. Amen. All right.
[1:10:14] He said like a forge in a blacksmith
[1:10:15] shop. You got to get the iron hot before
[1:10:19] you pong on the anvil. You put piece of
[1:10:22] iron there. P it now. It go bounce and
[1:10:24] bust. You might b it might bounce and
[1:10:26] bust your head in. You understand what
[1:10:28] going on there? piece of metal go
[1:10:30] talking about. You put piece of metal
[1:10:31] and hit a bang, that thing will hit you
[1:10:32] straight in your head. But when you put
[1:10:35] it in the fire and it red hot and you
[1:10:38] hit it a lash, it bend, it could shape
[1:10:42] it because it hot. I rather you're hot
[1:10:45] or you're cold. I can't bend you when
[1:10:47] you're cold. I can't hit you when you're
[1:10:49] lukewarm. It's waste of time. It
[1:10:51] bouncing back.
[1:10:56] But when you're hurt, God could take his
[1:10:59] hammer and bend you and twist you and
[1:11:03] hone you and shape you and forge you.
[1:11:12] It's like a forge in the blacksmith
[1:11:13] shop. You got to get the iron hot before
[1:11:15] you go to pound it on the anvil. If you
[1:11:17] don't, it will never straighten out. So
[1:11:20] let's reverse it now. You bend up before
[1:11:22] God straighten out. He can hit that
[1:11:24] piece of bend. You know, he got to put
[1:11:25] it in fire. Amen. Say come here and give
[1:11:27] some worship and get some praise. Glory
[1:11:30] to God. That what the that the woman
[1:11:31] with the bloody street not bloody woman
[1:11:33] don't have devil come and do you know
[1:11:34] she come and worship. She come and
[1:11:36] praise God and whatn not. And he said no
[1:11:38] no no I'm not taking give to the dogs
[1:11:40] and she stand there. She hot boy. She
[1:11:43] moving like when you hot people have
[1:11:46] people have a different kind of hot now.
[1:11:48] They hot with anger and temper. They hot
[1:11:49] because they don't like what the
[1:11:50] preachers say. They hot because they
[1:11:52] somebody talk to them. They want to be
[1:11:53] spoken to. But that woman stood her
[1:11:54] ground. He call she a dog.
[1:11:58] He identify and labor and say wear that
[1:12:00] tag.
[1:12:04] Dog tag. Put on dog tag. I'm a dog. She
[1:12:08] said yes Lord. That's the truth. I go
[1:12:10] wear that tag. But even the dogs that
[1:12:12] get crumbs. He say I go wear a different
[1:12:14] tag now. I go free you and free your
[1:12:16] daughter. I I I sending freedom to you
[1:12:18] right now because you said the right
[1:12:20] thing. It came out of your mouth. That
[1:12:23] mean you can say the right thing. Come
[1:12:24] on. Come on. Come on. Church.
[1:12:27] People loosen them out on the wrong
[1:12:29] things. But
[1:12:32] that's what it takes to have a revival.
[1:12:34] Are you ready? Is everybody
[1:12:38] under the heat of the Holy Spirit. Yes,
[1:12:40] sir. That brought down the powers of God
[1:12:43] and a revival moving. Then is where
[1:12:46] prayer meetings going day and night,
[1:12:48] every minute, everywhere. Why the people
[1:12:50] wouldn't even leave the grounds?
[1:12:53] Everybody under the heat of the Holy
[1:12:56] Ghost.
[1:12:59] Amen. There's a difference between the
[1:13:01] mark of the beast and the sealing of
[1:13:03] God. God seals by his word. You believe
[1:13:07] that? Amen. Now you say, is that right,
[1:13:09] brother Brown? Yes, sir. Hear what he
[1:13:11] said? God seals by his word. You believe
[1:13:14] that, Bram? Yes, sir. Then he quote
[1:13:16] Ephesians 4:13. grieve not the Holy
[1:13:18] Spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:13:22] unto the day of redemption. So number
[1:13:25] one, he said you are sealed by the word.
[1:13:27] Then he show you Ephesians 4:3 which is
[1:13:29] the scriptures. Now you are sealed by
[1:13:30] the spirit. Then he said now the holy
[1:13:33] spirit is the word. Oh I love that.
[1:13:36] Hallelujah. You see the word is spirit
[1:13:38] and spirit is word. Do you get it now?
[1:13:41] God is not three. He's the same God in
[1:13:43] three dispensation. Three offices. God
[1:13:45] the father with the law. God the son in
[1:13:47] grace and God the holy ghost as you call
[1:13:48] it the same God in the Holy Ghost
[1:13:50] dispensation. God the father was the
[1:13:52] word. God the son was the word. God the
[1:13:55] holy ghost is the word. Is just three
[1:13:57] offices and the holy ghost seals you.
[1:14:00] Therefore you are sealed by the word.
[1:14:05] You say well I'm sealed by he said well
[1:14:07] then it identify itself. So the claim of
[1:14:10] being sealed means that it identify
[1:14:13] itself. It proves here we go. You can't
[1:14:16] belong to a system and be sealed with
[1:14:19] the system and the word.
[1:14:21] So that's why some people locked into
[1:14:23] their church and their church teachings.
[1:14:24] Well done by us. We don't see it. So we
[1:14:26] get so off the word. You know the pastor
[1:14:29] went and gave them blue glasses and all
[1:14:30] them went blue shades in the church. If
[1:14:32] you look in the spirit realm, everybody
[1:14:33] went blue shades.
[1:14:37] Why he making everybody see blue? So
[1:14:40] when they present the word, they can't
[1:14:42] see it. They say I see in blue. You know
[1:14:43] that's right. take off your shades. As I
[1:14:45] say that one time we went uh in the
[1:14:48] early years um I think not Disney World
[1:14:51] someplace and they were showing 3D
[1:14:53] something and a cinema had put you wear
[1:14:55] special glasses to see this treaty thing
[1:14:57] and they had some kind of a big
[1:15:00] um a big what they call it like a big
[1:15:04] lumber coming towards you. So like that.
[1:15:06] So when it when when when you have on
[1:15:07] the glasses now people ducking on thing
[1:15:09] you know and I just doing so
[1:15:13] because once you have the glasses on
[1:15:14] this thing coming for you know birds
[1:15:15] flying people do it so in the audience
[1:15:17] and doing so I just doing so
[1:15:21] when it come I just lift my glasses off
[1:15:23] because the glasses is making you see
[1:15:25] them things. So as long as I lift that
[1:15:28] up, me see nothing. It's on the screen
[1:15:30] right there. But put on the glasses. You
[1:15:32] seen think people ducking, people
[1:15:34] hitting and what kind of thing like
[1:15:35] that. People even see people screaming
[1:15:36] and thing like that. I just raise my
[1:15:38] glasses afterward my glasses. I see on
[1:15:40] the screen right there.
[1:15:43] One thing I never used to watch. I I
[1:15:44] never watch in horror thing. I say why
[1:15:47] should I sit down and fight myself?
[1:15:50] You can't get me sitting to watch a
[1:15:51] horror movie to sit down and fight my
[1:15:53] own self. I God
[1:15:56] why should I do that? Your heart
[1:15:57] palpitating long time had a thing called
[1:16:00] Dracula before the Lord two teeth and
[1:16:02] thing
[1:16:04] after night time sleep good because you
[1:16:06] thinking Dracula coming for you. Why
[1:16:07] should I want to be watching that for me
[1:16:10] to not to sleep good? No sir.
[1:16:14] So you see when they have these glasses
[1:16:16] that they put on people it causes them
[1:16:18] to see things a certain way. But the
[1:16:20] brother Brandon brought clarity.
[1:16:23] Amen. Write the vision. Make it plain.
[1:16:28] Make it clear that when you see it, you
[1:16:30] could run. Not walk. Run.
[1:16:35] Hallelujah.
[1:16:37] Then he said the minister cannot bring a
[1:16:39] revival. The revival has to come by the
[1:16:41] people. So somehow this vision have to
[1:16:43] come to you.
[1:16:45] Hallelujah.
[1:16:46] So they'll never to open your mouth and
[1:16:48] say brother is this and brother is that
[1:16:49] and the ministry here is this and that
[1:16:51] will not come out your mouth.
[1:16:53] Because what has to come is what you see
[1:16:56] as your promise. Every person under the
[1:16:59] fire and the heat of the Holy Ghost. Are
[1:17:02] you under the heat of the Holy Ghost?
[1:17:03] That is what must be your burden. That
[1:17:05] is what you must warn. I want to be
[1:17:07] under the heat of the Holy Ghost. I want
[1:17:09] to bring my portion to service next
[1:17:10] Sunday. I come with my fire. I am coming
[1:17:14] to get. I coming to give.
[1:17:18] Hallelujah. I am coming to beg. I commit
[1:17:20] to share what God has blessed me with.
[1:17:23] So you keep yourself, you preserve
[1:17:25] yourself, you create an atmosphere and
[1:17:27] you come to church with that. The song
[1:17:29] leader can hardly sing because the
[1:17:31] atmosphere is already there.
[1:17:35] [Applause]
[1:17:36] Now we find out
[1:17:38] a machine automobile got pistons,
[1:17:40] valves, carburetor and so forth. That's
[1:17:42] the mechanics. I'd like to say something
[1:17:44] to the church right now. Brings to my
[1:17:46] memory. I believe that we are so close
[1:17:49] to the end. I'm going to say something
[1:17:51] now.
[1:17:54] Let me see this. This is the 24th of
[1:17:56] November 1963 from what shall I call do
[1:18:00] Jesus Christ? What shall I do with Jesus
[1:18:02] call the Christ? I quoting this because
[1:18:03] there are some people like to say it was
[1:18:05] before the seals or after he seals
[1:18:08] is for them. They take what they want
[1:18:11] when they want you know just as the
[1:18:13] convenience line. So this is after the
[1:18:15] seals. So you see you want to say
[1:18:17] something here what he's saying there's
[1:18:18] not B you saying something here I'm
[1:18:21] going to say something now there are so
[1:18:23] many people
[1:18:25] trying to explain the mechanics when you
[1:18:29] don't know it
[1:18:37] what is somebody who said Noah I want
[1:18:40] you to explain the mechanics of how the
[1:18:42] ark float he couldn't do it you You
[1:18:46] don't have to know the mechanics. That's
[1:18:48] the inspiration. Just the dynamics of
[1:18:51] it. The dynamics is what you want to
[1:18:53] know.
[1:18:54] [Applause]
[1:18:56] But let me sting you a little bit. The
[1:18:58] dynamics is not just the dynamics is
[1:19:01] also a person.
[1:19:04] [Laughter]
[1:19:08] Oh, glory to God. The intellectual will
[1:19:11] take it right through to stick with
[1:19:14] letter and word and text. You have to
[1:19:17] know the mechanics. You have to know the
[1:19:19] dynamics. But the dynamics is a person.
[1:19:22] Amen, sister. That's right.
[1:19:26] Well, if somebody come to Israel and
[1:19:27] said, "S Moses, I want to understand how
[1:19:30] you could create animals with your own
[1:19:31] word." He said, "It ain't my word. It's
[1:19:34] God's word. He told me to do it. Tell
[1:19:36] me, explain to me how you made flies
[1:19:38] come upon the earth when there wasn't
[1:19:40] any flies on the earth. Moses couldn't
[1:19:42] explain it himself. You don't have to.
[1:19:45] How you make the east wind come and blow
[1:19:47] a hole across the Red Sea and we follow
[1:19:49] you on dry land. Explain the mechanics
[1:19:51] of that. What was the system you used?
[1:19:54] Moses, tell me the scientific research
[1:19:56] of of the atom you loose. He didn't know
[1:19:59] it. He didn't know the mechanic. He just
[1:20:01] know the dynamics. I can't tell you how
[1:20:04] I am living. I can't tell you how you
[1:20:06] are living, but you are living. I can't
[1:20:08] tell you how your heart and your food
[1:20:10] goes down and makes blood and take the
[1:20:12] strength of that food and goes in the
[1:20:14] third wall of the intestinalized tract
[1:20:16] and turns it back to blood and sends it
[1:20:18] back through you. I can't explain that.
[1:20:20] I can't explain. I don't know the
[1:20:22] mechanics. It's the dynamics.
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:26] Oh my. Now, Moses might have known the
[1:20:27] mechanics, but there was nobody else in
[1:20:29] place to understand it but Moses. They
[1:20:31] know it worked and that satisfied. Why
[1:20:35] can't the people be satisfied that way
[1:20:37] today? Amen. Why went to Tucson and he
[1:20:40] come back so and he went buy a new
[1:20:42] canyon so and he see so and he had a
[1:20:44] number six here and he gone through the
[1:20:46] day and he can't number was so
[1:20:49] what the hell me now
[1:20:54] somebody went to visit by the canyon and
[1:20:56] they get this by somebody I get a rock
[1:20:58] like a pyramid
[1:21:00] I get rock to and I went up there I
[1:21:03] never announced that what I suppose is
[1:21:05] that rock that rock is that represent
[1:21:06] Christ it's I get the capstone there.
[1:21:09] What kind of foolishness is that? If I
[1:21:10] come back here, you're not talking
[1:21:11] foolishness.
[1:21:13] It's a stone a pick up. It It means
[1:21:16] nothing. It's a stone from the mountain.
[1:21:20] It's a paper weight.
[1:21:25] It have nothing to do with anointing and
[1:21:26] capstone and revelation and we and
[1:21:28] there's a sign sign of what a sign of a
[1:21:31] stone that my grandson pick up thing and
[1:21:34] give me a special Samuel that is a
[1:21:36] normal stone.
[1:21:37] think that's some precious stone. I said
[1:21:39] listen that is a normal soul leave it
[1:21:40] alone. He digging for special suits
[1:21:43] special thing.
[1:21:46] Okay.
[1:21:50] All right. You don't know you don't have
[1:21:53] to know the mechanics. Just know the
[1:21:55] dynamics. Here we go. The thing that
[1:21:57] pulsates it that makes it true that see
[1:22:00] if it hits the target on the Bible every
[1:22:02] time. Now let's let's look at the woman
[1:22:05] with the blood issue. She was not a
[1:22:07] Christian. She was not a believer. She
[1:22:09] didn't belong to Jesus crowd or what a
[1:22:10] disciple. She was a sick woman. Spend
[1:22:12] all she money run out. Husband tell her
[1:22:15] dramatized husband tell her don't go
[1:22:16] back to that group that finical group.
[1:22:17] And she told herself one day in the
[1:22:18] mirror if I could just touch him. I made
[1:22:21] whole. She talked to herself tell
[1:22:23] herself give herself a promise. Tie
[1:22:24] herself up in all of that. And she said
[1:22:26] she going forward. When she went forward
[1:22:29] is crowded around Jesus. She had a
[1:22:30] choice. Say you know what God this this
[1:22:33] thing I asked for. Maybe it's another
[1:22:34] day. Not today. too much a crowd. I'm a
[1:22:36] private person.
[1:22:38] I don't want nobody to see me. I want to
[1:22:41] meet Jesus all by himself.
[1:22:44] Sitting on where? Sitting where? Where
[1:22:46] you meeting Jesus? Everywhere. Jesus go
[1:22:47] have a crowd around him. That woman had
[1:22:50] the guts, the gumption, the courage, the
[1:22:52] faith to go through and bust through all
[1:22:55] those men and push away. Listen, she
[1:22:57] couldn't just say, "Excuse me." She
[1:22:58] pushed.
[1:23:02] You could tell she had bad manners. You
[1:23:03] know, excuse me. And people moving
[1:23:05] moving big unbelief standing there. Big
[1:23:06] hard back men standing there with all
[1:23:07] the unbelief. You got to push through
[1:23:08] that tonight.
[1:23:13] But but Isaac tell me something. What
[1:23:17] brother Ulu said when when they leave
[1:23:18] Nigeria to go to Ghana Dr. Patru is Ben
[1:23:22] country to Ben to now I did one of them
[1:23:26] trips some time ago. It's not easy. You
[1:23:29] have to come out the bus pass through
[1:23:30] immigration. He's on land. So sometime
[1:23:33] they keep you long. They're looking for
[1:23:34] a little change and different things.
[1:23:35] Some no change for you. Might keep you
[1:23:37] at six hours, four hours and that's one
[1:23:39] like Togo and then you have to go to
[1:23:40] Benon and then they go to Ghana. So it's
[1:23:42] it's tribulation just to get to go to a
[1:23:44] convention in Ghana.
[1:23:47] But share with him that he he loves the
[1:23:50] borders. He switched the mind. He loves
[1:23:54] the borders because the border is
[1:23:55] resistance to your blessing. Once you
[1:23:57] bust through that, you see you see you
[1:24:00] make them think differently. So you stop
[1:24:02] seeing the six hour wait or what they're
[1:24:04] just resistance. You're going for a
[1:24:06] blessing. So you had to pass through the
[1:24:07] to resistance and you had to pass
[1:24:09] through the Ben resistance and you're
[1:24:10] going to the Ghana to get your blessing.
[1:24:13] Oh, give the Lord some praises. If we
[1:24:16] could only rephrase things, we stop
[1:24:18] seeing, oh gosh, why this so and stop
[1:24:20] that?
[1:24:23] No bombs are falling on you.
[1:24:26] I see no drone bringing something and
[1:24:27] delivering and busting your glass and
[1:24:29] whatnot. The other in Ukraine, the other
[1:24:30] in Russia and fire and Israel and all of
[1:24:33] no nothing hitting you.
[1:24:36] Two rain hit Trinidad and they didn't
[1:24:38] want to go umbrella like a land outside
[1:24:41] like rain at all.
[1:24:44] I want to go to work because rain falls
[1:24:48] rain. Some people really know with
[1:24:50] bombs.
[1:24:51] So friends, we had to get tougher. Amen.
[1:24:54] We have to stop complaining because
[1:24:56] complaining is weaken your faith. Stop
[1:24:58] complaining. I find myself complaining
[1:25:00] foot and pain and all kind of achie I
[1:25:03] have activity in my feet. Let me test it
[1:25:05] right now. I have activity in my limbs
[1:25:07] and that's good enough for me. I praise
[1:25:08] God for that.
[1:25:12] Other than that you cry you a river.
[1:25:15] with the Greeks the Greeks and what all
[1:25:18] right so the dynamics wrap up is
[1:25:22] something
[1:25:24] so therefore when the Greeks act so we
[1:25:26] will see Jesus but say not to have him
[1:25:28] explained today with great intellectual
[1:25:31] messages we can explain it till you can
[1:25:33] see the picture but that's not what we
[1:25:35] are looking for tonight so clearly we're
[1:25:38] not looking for more mysteries more
[1:25:39] revelations I know about Ukraine I know
[1:25:40] all this time to this and that I know
[1:25:42] about all of that I don't even want to
[1:25:43] know about all of I want to know how
[1:25:44] this thing working. How the sick I want
[1:25:46] to know the dynamics of the sick. They
[1:25:48] shall lay us upon the sick. Not prayer
[1:25:50] know because the quickening power was in
[1:25:52] their hands.
[1:25:56] I show you the mystery. The mystery to
[1:25:57] be unfolded that that what you talking
[1:26:00] about? You do you know the mystery
[1:26:01] behind that? Electricity passing through
[1:26:03] your hands. The anointing upon your
[1:26:05] hands. You're touching and the people
[1:26:07] getting healed because the anointing is
[1:26:09] all your hands.
[1:26:11] Peter knew what he had. He said, "Silver
[1:26:13] and gold have I none." He couldn't
[1:26:14] explain that. But such as I have, he
[1:26:16] knew he had it. He wasn't guessing,
[1:26:18] well, I will give confirmation and you
[1:26:20] know, I get dream. Not that talk.
[1:26:27] Some people still waiting for the dream
[1:26:29] and the word is there to tell you what
[1:26:30] you're supposed to do. You waiting for a
[1:26:33] dream to forgive, a dream to drop your
[1:26:36] keep on dreaming.
[1:26:40] Not to have him explained today with a
[1:26:43] great intellectual message. We can
[1:26:44] explain it till you can see the picture.
[1:26:46] But that's isn't what we are talk
[1:26:48] looking for tonight. We are not looking
[1:26:50] for the mechanics. Amen. We are looking
[1:26:54] for the dynamics of it. From this night
[1:26:57] forward in this church, we are looking
[1:27:00] for the dynamics.
[1:27:03] If anybody ask what we preaching, I tell
[1:27:05] them what we looking for. We're looking
[1:27:07] for the dynamics.
[1:27:09] Praise God.
[1:27:11] [Applause]
[1:27:12] Well, the pope going on and right. You
[1:27:14] preach about the pope. Leave me with a
[1:27:16] dynamic.
[1:27:20] [Applause]
[1:27:22] You preach about Israel. Some people all
[1:27:24] kind of Israel mystery right now going
[1:27:25] on in in the in Israel business.
[1:27:31] You realize I don't preach about Israel.
[1:27:36] All right. Paul explained about who the
[1:27:38] real Israel. So Abraham faith in him not
[1:27:42] Isaac is the faith in the real Jew that
[1:27:45] you talking about Holy Ghost fil
[1:27:47] Christians. All right they leave Israel
[1:27:50] alone because I'll get blows for that.
[1:27:51] All right we are not looking for the the
[1:27:54] mechanics we are looking for the
[1:27:56] dynamics of it. We've got mechanics of
[1:27:57] religions in the Bible so bottlized it
[1:27:59] look like a great 35 coach train sitting
[1:28:02] on a track but if you haven't got any
[1:28:03] steam it take dynamics to perform with
[1:28:06] the mechanics. What we need now is to
[1:28:09] see that and that's what we have been
[1:28:10] taught all these years. Is it the truth
[1:28:12] or is it not? It's been explained over
[1:28:14] and over and over through different
[1:28:16] seminaries and churches until we are
[1:28:19] looking to see and so forth. Until we
[1:28:20] are looking to see who this person is.
[1:28:22] Now you say, "But Ram, how would you do
[1:28:24] it?" Well, did you notice when they come
[1:28:25] to the sermon of Christ who had been
[1:28:27] trained not to say sit down and explain
[1:28:29] it to you? No, he brought them straight
[1:28:31] to him. We would see Jesus. We would
[1:28:35] like for you to explain to us and tell
[1:28:37] us it's what's all about. That wasn't
[1:28:38] the question. They wanted to see Jesus
[1:28:41] and they brought him. We want to see the
[1:28:43] person and the person is what? Faith,
[1:28:46] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:28:49] godliness, brotherly kindness and love.
[1:28:51] That's the person. That's why say I came
[1:28:53] to introduce people to the stature of a
[1:28:55] perfect man. I didn't come to build a
[1:28:56] new denomination. I didn't come to bring
[1:28:58] a new church. I came to introduce this
[1:29:00] person to you. add to your faith virtue
[1:29:03] and to virtue knowledge and temperance
[1:29:04] and patience, godliness, brotherly
[1:29:05] kindness and the love of God. That is
[1:29:07] the person of Christ.
[1:29:11] Give the Lord some praises.
[1:29:13] [Applause]
[1:29:20] We couldn't find him in fine lectures
[1:29:22] cuz we find people here we go. This is
[1:29:24] deep.
[1:29:26] We find people who can stand up and can
[1:29:30] explain the word in such a way. It is
[1:29:33] breathtaking.
[1:29:36] It is I know men who could really
[1:29:39] preach, you know, they could bring that
[1:29:41] word out real solid, you know,
[1:29:44] but not by not I looking for
[1:29:48] but when we find it, it's still just a
[1:29:50] lecture. You see a lecture, it's the
[1:29:54] mechanics and we find the entertainer
[1:29:57] can go through all the actions. So you
[1:29:59] have the lecturers, you have the
[1:30:00] entertainers. The entertainers, they
[1:30:02] will give a performance, but it's still
[1:30:04] a entertaining lecture and you have
[1:30:06] lecture lecture stiff staty and they
[1:30:09] give it the word shock but people
[1:30:11] snoring, sleeping out cold on that under
[1:30:14] the lecture thing, right? And then they
[1:30:16] have the entertainer now who may have
[1:30:17] some actions and things like that wake
[1:30:19] the people up a little bit but still
[1:30:21] mechanics.
[1:30:23] We find the entertainer. So baram
[1:30:25] nailing the spirits who can go through
[1:30:27] all the actions so forth but that still
[1:30:29] isn't it that isn't what we are looking
[1:30:32] for we find the religious type street
[1:30:35] types for with the robes on and so forth
[1:30:39] that the robe on the one who dress
[1:30:41] special but we are looking here we go
[1:30:43] for the person Jesus Christ could we say
[1:30:46] amen amen we home stretch now the Greeks
[1:30:49] wanted to see him the Greeks wanted to
[1:30:52] know Jesus and he give them the way to
[1:30:54] know him to know him not to know his
[1:30:56] creed not to know his word not to know
[1:30:58] his m but but not to know his miracles
[1:31:00] but to know him and the only way you
[1:31:02] could find that is at the cross
[1:31:06] not at the cradle but you can't even
[1:31:08] preach the cross now you preach the
[1:31:09] cross now they going to say you
[1:31:10] preaching the real cross the cross now
[1:31:12] is there they crucify him the word I can
[1:31:15] hang myself on that you know I can bow
[1:31:16] before that how you going before that
[1:31:19] cross in seaman tabernacle the real
[1:31:21] cross where Jesus died is a cross he
[1:31:23] died
[1:31:24] But now you have intellectual dare they
[1:31:26] crucify him that he murder the cross.
[1:31:27] Now why do you
[1:31:32] but he pointed them to the cross. So
[1:31:35] when you bring them to Christ pointed to
[1:31:36] the cross not to a creed Jesus told me
[1:31:40] to join so and so church. He never did
[1:31:41] do that. He wouldn't do it today. You
[1:31:44] will just see him. He will point you to
[1:31:45] the cross. Go there and die and then you
[1:31:49] will know him if you want to know him.
[1:31:52] So he called for death. He called it the
[1:31:54] death of a corner wheat. Is that right?
[1:31:57] Oh my, this is beautiful. Jesus had to
[1:32:00] die to produce eternal life. Now listen
[1:32:03] closely, Christian friends. Unless you
[1:32:05] die to yourself and your feelings and
[1:32:09] act on God's word, you will never have
[1:32:11] life.
[1:32:13] Forget your feelings. I'm still reading.
[1:32:15] Just take what God said. How much are
[1:32:18] you in love with your feelings? in love
[1:32:19] with your emotions and you're bold
[1:32:21] enough to say so
[1:32:24] I feel this I feel this and you feel
[1:32:25] this and you feel this
[1:32:29] people are saying amen to this one you
[1:32:31] know why you know I'll say it again and
[1:32:34] try and see
[1:32:38] like you're feeling the pain already
[1:32:40] there
[1:32:43] hill there calary street cal going so
[1:32:47] it's so to the
[1:32:49] Unless you die to yourself and your
[1:32:52] feelings. When Baram was sick and doctor
[1:32:56] tell him he can't get well and all kind
[1:32:57] of thing and he and he caught a
[1:32:59] revelation by strike I'm healed. He said
[1:33:00] he stuffy thing down it vomit. He stuff
[1:33:02] it down it vomit. He stuff it down it
[1:33:04] vomit. And he said by strip I'm healed.
[1:33:06] By he vomit. He said and people say he
[1:33:08] was lying. He said I wasn't lying. I was
[1:33:10] quoting God's promise. By sh I was
[1:33:12] healed. And after was no vomit. He was
[1:33:14] healed. Oh give the Lord some praises.
[1:33:17] I'm feeling sick. I'm feeling sick. And
[1:33:19] the devil's standing sitting right next
[1:33:20] to you. Yes, you're sick. Come on now.
[1:33:22] Tell him how you're feeling. And you're
[1:33:23] feeling sick. And the more you say it is
[1:33:25] the more you and get anointed with it.
[1:33:31] But God tell us to say how we feel. He
[1:33:33] said to confess by his stripe. I'm
[1:33:35] healed. I am healed. I'm healed. I'm
[1:33:37] healed. Look what God Look what did the
[1:33:39] man with blind pastor pray for the man.
[1:33:41] The man he say you're healed. Come back
[1:33:43] in the prayer line. He said I pray for
[1:33:44] you already. He say he don't you say
[1:33:47] then you recognize man Catholic he's
[1:33:49] fake hold to nothing you say by strip
[1:33:50] I'm healed say that say that say that
[1:33:51] say that all the man have that only the
[1:33:53] Bible man have by strip I'm healed by
[1:33:55] strip I'm healed they laughing at him
[1:33:56] they mock him go let days pass but the
[1:33:58] weeks pass all of a sudden one day crack
[1:34:00] open and he jump off the the barber shop
[1:34:03] he is healed his faith connect with the
[1:34:05] reality of what Jesus already did for
[1:34:08] him he wasn't now heal you know he was
[1:34:11] healed 200 years ago his faith connected
[1:34:14] with what God did for him 2,000 years.
[1:34:17] Oh God, help us tonight when our faith
[1:34:19] can connect with that president's
[1:34:20] reality. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:34:24] Hallelujah. Unless you die to yourself
[1:34:27] and your feelings and act on God's word,
[1:34:30] you will never have life. Forget your
[1:34:32] feelings. Just take what God said and
[1:34:34] plant that seed into that life of your
[1:34:37] own debt. Your own debt and life will
[1:34:38] produce out of you. Praise God. We find
[1:34:41] in every age when God said a certain
[1:34:43] thing, what happened? Here come a man
[1:34:45] along manifested that. That was William
[1:34:47] Brham. Here come their people along and
[1:34:49] lived that. That was God himself living
[1:34:52] in the people because it was an
[1:34:53] answering of his word. Isn't that like
[1:34:56] isn't that right? Now Jesus said in St.
[1:34:58] John 4, the time is coming. And now is
[1:35:01] when God being a spirit will be
[1:35:03] worshiped in spirit and in truth. Now
[1:35:06] some people have spirit, no truth.
[1:35:08] Others have truth and no spirit. So the
[1:35:11] prophet said that oh glory to God. So
[1:35:13] they can't explain away the dead
[1:35:15] churches. The church is dead because
[1:35:16] they have no spirit there.
[1:35:19] Let me say it again good because people
[1:35:20] might make the churches is dead because
[1:35:23] the spirit is not there. The people
[1:35:26] believe the message but the spirit is
[1:35:27] not there. The spirit is active.
[1:35:34] Hallelujah.
[1:35:37] You talk about the Cadillac and all the
[1:35:39] steering wheel and diamond studs, but it
[1:35:41] can't go nowhere. All of them had the
[1:35:43] right mechanics, but one of them has the
[1:35:45] dynamics. You you might know the
[1:35:47] mechanics, but it take the dynamics to
[1:35:49] start off the mechanics to make them
[1:35:50] work. And that's what the matter with
[1:35:52] the church today. We are full of
[1:35:53] theology without any dynamics in it. In
[1:35:56] other words, you've got to have spark to
[1:35:58] the gasoline or the gasoline is no more
[1:36:00] than good as water. No matter how well
[1:36:02] we are taught, here we go. how well we
[1:36:04] believe, how much of the Bible we say is
[1:36:06] true and we believe it to be true. It's
[1:36:08] got to be the dynamics has got to be
[1:36:10] there, the spark to set that word of
[1:36:12] fire and make it start rolling. It's got
[1:36:15] to have that. If you don't, the church
[1:36:17] sits still. The car sits still. You sit
[1:36:20] still. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the
[1:36:23] house. But no matter how much you say,
[1:36:25] "I sympathize. I believe the word."
[1:36:27] You've got to have something to spack
[1:36:28] that off and to make that 100 octane go
[1:36:31] to firing. Oh, praise the name of the
[1:36:33] Lord. I think that's what the matter
[1:36:34] today. We are lacking the dynamical
[1:36:36] power to press the word and make it live
[1:36:39] for this day. Oh, glory to hear. We said
[1:36:42] the dynamical power to press the word
[1:36:44] and make it live for this day. Martin
[1:36:46] Luther had mechanics and dynamics of his
[1:36:48] day. John Wesley had mechanics and
[1:36:50] dynamics of his day. The Pentecostal had
[1:36:52] them with their day. What about our day?
[1:36:54] Oh glor, we have got to have mechanics
[1:36:56] and dynamics. And I am prophesying
[1:36:58] tonight. We're going to have dynamics
[1:37:00] and mechanics together. Praise God.
[1:37:03] Hallelujah. To worship the Lord in
[1:37:05] spirit and in truth. Oh, glory to God.
[1:37:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What
[1:37:12] about our day? This is another time the
[1:37:15] church should be fully grown now, ready
[1:37:17] to go and meet Christ with the
[1:37:18] manifestation of every blessing he had
[1:37:20] promised in the Bible. We should come on
[1:37:22] please. Operating in that one great body
[1:37:24] where he promised he would meet the
[1:37:26] people and be worshiped in this great
[1:37:28] truth of his. All right. Where are we at
[1:37:32] here now?
[1:37:34] Oh, this have 10 pages tonight. I reach
[1:37:35] page six actually. All right. Got to get
[1:37:37] this here. When Balam asked God
[1:37:40] permission to go to curse Israel, right?
[1:37:43] God turned him down. My that's st. But
[1:37:47] Balac insisted promise him greater
[1:37:49] rewards and honor. So Balam went back to
[1:37:52] God. Now one answer from God should have
[1:37:55] been enough but not for self-will. Bam.
[1:37:58] When God saw his perversity, he told him
[1:38:01] get up and go.
[1:38:03] So he Bam come to God. He said God I
[1:38:05] want to thirst them. God said no.
[1:38:08] The man when he going back to the king
[1:38:10] said listen more money for you.
[1:38:13] He raised the offer. That's man going
[1:38:16] back to God. Say God I want to curse
[1:38:18] them. God said go
[1:38:20] quickly. He saddled the donkey. He went
[1:38:22] away. He should have realized this was
[1:38:24] simply God's permissive will. He
[1:38:26] wouldn't be able to curse them if he
[1:38:27] went 20 times and tried 20 times. Now
[1:38:30] like baam are people today they believe
[1:38:33] in three gods titles and so on. Watch.
[1:38:35] And God send the spirit upon them as is
[1:38:39] it upon Balam. And they will go on
[1:38:41] believing that they are exactly right.
[1:38:44] Teaching and preaching false doctrine in
[1:38:46] the message with the spirit upon them.
[1:38:48] Yes. Yes.
[1:38:51] They are perfect bummites. The doctrine
[1:38:54] of bum. Go ahead. Do it your way. They
[1:38:57] say, "Well, God has blessed us." And
[1:38:59] they have a history of God's blessing
[1:39:00] them. It must be all right. But Abraham,
[1:39:04] I know he has blessed you. I don't deny
[1:39:06] that. But it's the same organizational
[1:39:09] route that Balam took. It's a defiance
[1:39:12] to God's word. It's false teaching.
[1:39:16] Amen. So Balam went down, set up seven
[1:39:18] altars for the clean beast of sacrifice.
[1:39:20] He killed a ram signify to come Messiah.
[1:39:22] He knew what to do to approach God. He
[1:39:25] had the mechanics just right. Amen. But
[1:39:28] not the dynamics.
[1:39:29] Same as now. Can't you see it? One had
[1:39:33] God in their midst. form won't get you
[1:39:37] anywhere. It can't take the place of
[1:39:41] spirit manifestation.
[1:39:43] Give the Lord some praises. I don't care
[1:39:45] what people explain, what mystery they
[1:39:47] have, what capstone, revelation,
[1:39:49] interpretation, divignation, whatever
[1:39:50] they have, it cannot take the place of
[1:39:52] spirit manifestation
[1:39:55] in the upper room at Pentecost. Their
[1:39:58] bodies were so quickened to a new life.
[1:40:01] They were a bunch of cowards. I'm afraid
[1:40:03] to go out and make a claim. I'm afraid
[1:40:05] of them great bishops out there. But all
[1:40:07] of a sudden the dynamics come. What did
[1:40:12] it do? So I don't want no man explaining
[1:40:14] from dynamics here and this. No, no.
[1:40:16] Yeah. What did it do? It not only filled
[1:40:19] their spirit inside, it quickened their
[1:40:21] mechanics. Their bodies were quickened.
[1:40:24] So their hands was quickened. Their
[1:40:27] tongues was quickened. They couldn't
[1:40:28] speak the earthly language. They speak
[1:40:30] in other tongues. Their hands were so
[1:40:32] quickened that when they lay hands upon
[1:40:34] the sick, they recovered. Their bodies
[1:40:36] were quickened, they were no more
[1:40:38] cowards. They went one right out and
[1:40:40] said, "You men in Judea, where before
[1:40:42] the dynamics come, they were mechanics."
[1:40:45] But now, praise God, the dynamics come
[1:40:48] to the mechanics. They wasn't afraid it
[1:40:50] no more. Some of you people afraid a
[1:40:51] woman would laugh at you with long hair
[1:40:53] or quit wearing makeup or baptism and so
[1:40:55] on. It changed them. That's what
[1:40:57] dynamics will do. It will change you. It
[1:40:59] will change us. It changed them. It
[1:41:02] quickened them. It made them different.
[1:41:04] They would change people from then on.
[1:41:05] It quickened them from a old life of
[1:41:07] being a coward to like the lion or tribe
[1:41:09] of Judah. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:41:11] praises. That's what the Bible said. And
[1:41:13] their mortal bodies being quickened.
[1:41:15] Their language was quickened. Their
[1:41:17] thoughts was quickened. Their spirits
[1:41:19] was quickened. Their life was quickened.
[1:41:21] They were quickened all together. They
[1:41:23] tried to talk and they couldn't talk in
[1:41:24] the human language. They were so
[1:41:26] quickened up in the presence of God that
[1:41:28] they spoke with a new tongue. Amen. Oh,
[1:41:30] give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:41:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:41:36] Elisha, we almost done. We're on page
[1:41:38] nine already. I jump down. And when he
[1:41:40] was so tired, God sent a chariot down
[1:41:42] from heaven, horses of fire, and took
[1:41:44] him up. He was so full of that
[1:41:45] quickening power. Just think with the
[1:41:46] word of God in his heart, he become so
[1:41:49] full of that quickening power, it
[1:41:50] quickened him. Oh, it quickened it.
[1:41:53] Watch it. What does the word quick
[1:41:54] means? It means to be brought to life
[1:41:56] after death. That is the gate of
[1:41:58] worship. Amen. My God. Now if somebody
[1:42:01] tell you that Mark 16 is not true that
[1:42:04] that Pentecostal idea of the back of the
[1:42:06] Holy Ghost, that ain't the spirit of God
[1:42:07] in you. I don't care how well you are
[1:42:09] trained, that's not the spirit of God.
[1:42:11] My belong my mother belong to this and
[1:42:13] my father belong to that. No, he said he
[1:42:15] said Jesus Christ for this age and the
[1:42:16] promise that meant to the age. That's
[1:42:17] what you have to know. Notice we find
[1:42:20] out and I'm closing.
[1:42:22] This great quickening power struck
[1:42:23] Enoch. It quickened him and he went home
[1:42:26] without dying. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now you
[1:42:28] see the rapture revelation there. Now
[1:42:30] how are we going with that quickening
[1:42:31] power? We going with a book and tape. We
[1:42:35] can't work. So we going with
[1:42:36] explanation. We have four sermon and
[1:42:38] that no Enoch. Watch it there. He was so
[1:42:42] full of this quickening power. It
[1:42:43] quickened him and he went home with no
[1:42:46] dying. It struck Elijah and it quickened
[1:42:49] him and he went home without dying. Oh,
[1:42:52] give the Lord a shout. Praise God.
[1:42:54] Praise God. Praise God. begin to play
[1:42:56] something for Stephen. It is always
[1:42:58] there. And when you get that quickening
[1:43:00] power, being quickened up with him. Now
[1:43:02] remember, when Christ died behind the
[1:43:04] flesh, we are flesh of his flesh and
[1:43:06] bone of his bone. And when he was
[1:43:07] wounded, Christ at Calvary, he was
[1:43:09] wounded for you and me. We are flesh of
[1:43:11] his flesh, bone of his bone. And God,
[1:43:13] here we go. I'll leave you with this.
[1:43:15] God has already raised us up
[1:43:16] potentially. The quickening power has
[1:43:19] raised us from a life of sin and changed
[1:43:22] our being. It has potentially raised us
[1:43:25] up in Christ Jesus which the
[1:43:27] resurrection will bring us forth in full
[1:43:29] maturity. Oh glory to God. So right now
[1:43:32] we have a partial resurrection. We have
[1:43:34] a partial quickening that has changed us
[1:43:36] from Baptist Methodist to where we are
[1:43:37] right now. And we have a promise of that
[1:43:39] full crying power to bring us. Let's all
[1:43:41] praise God. Let's all stand and give God
[1:43:43] some worship. God bless you. Thanks
[1:43:45] again for coming. Glory to God. Father
[1:43:46] bless your people. Fill them with your
[1:43:48] Holy Spirit. Fill them with your
[1:43:49] breaking power. Fill them with your
[1:43:50] love. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen.
[1:43:52] Praise God.
[1:43:56] Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:43:59] Hallelujah.

[1:44:15] tonight. Oh, hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:44:18] Jesus. Oh, glory to God. You can raise
[1:44:21] the key up. Amen. One, turn around.
[1:44:22] Greet your brother, greet your sister.
[1:44:24] Oh, they were in an upper chamber. Oh,
[1:44:28] and they were all with one accord. Oh,
[1:44:32] and the Holy Ghost descended
[1:44:36] as was promised by our Lord. Oh, and oh
