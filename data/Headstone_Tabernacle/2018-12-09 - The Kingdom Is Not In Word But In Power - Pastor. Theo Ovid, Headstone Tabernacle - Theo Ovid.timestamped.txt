[41:17] me with one the one question scripture
[41:19] just to greet you this morning I'm not
[41:21] going to preach but it's gonna greet you
[41:24] Philippians 3 and verse 13
[41:41] Philippians 3 and verse 13 brethren I
[41:44] count not myself to have apprehended but
[41:48] this one thing I do forgetting those
[41:50] things which are behind and reaching
[41:52] forth unto those things which are before
[41:54] I press towards the mark for the prize
[41:57] of the high calling of God in Christ
[41:59] Jesus made a lord had a blessing to the
[42:02] reading of his word you may be seated
[42:05] this morning
[42:07] before I greet you we do have some notes
[42:11] of praise
[42:12] brother Joseph Williams giving thanks to
[42:15] God for my dad who swelling has gone
[42:17] down a man we can't go to that today
[42:21] amen and I'm just the christine i would
[42:25] like to turn the scenes for the prayer
[42:27] and give God all the glory for healing
[42:29] me on Sunday last after prayer was
[42:32] offered he may have we thank God for
[42:33] that
[42:34] [Applause]
[42:38] from sis from Marcia Nicholas Luther
[42:42] priest times given for healing from a
[42:44] terrible head cold and from coughing we
[42:48] do have a special visitor in our gates
[42:50] Cadell o Lonard way you acted alone
[42:52] welcome to head so Tabernacle invited by
[42:55] but it again for Francis we're so happy
[42:56] to have you here
[42:59] well certainly it's good to be in the
[43:01] house of God today said me happy to be
[43:04] in fellowship this morning and I bring
[43:07] greetings from by the Petersham law I
[43:10] ministered in London twice about three
[43:12] weeks ago Wednesday night and three
[43:15] Sundays ago and then I was in Argentina
[43:16] two Sundays ago and then last week the
[43:20] enemy tried to knock me out with some
[43:22] cool virus and I'm still kind of
[43:23] corporate from it but the devil is
[43:25] defeated random said you know you have
[43:30] to let the devil know whose side you're
[43:32] on
[43:32] you're not just gonna let God know whose
[43:34] side you have to let it devil know whose
[43:36] side you're on and when it seemed like
[43:38] you're on the roof and you bring us
[43:40] sacrifice of praise because the
[43:42] sacrifice of praise as well you don't
[43:44] maybe feel like praising or the
[43:46] situation doesn't allow you to do it the
[43:47] way you want to but you make a sacrifice
[43:49] you make a sacrifice because it costs a
[43:52] bit more to do it because the
[43:54] expectation is you don't do it but when
[43:57] the cost is greater because the
[43:59] situation is rough then the fragrance
[44:01] that comes up to God is sweeter so the
[44:05] trials and the testing and the problem
[44:07] in the situations that we go through are
[44:10] to make the fragrance of our worship
[44:11] more acceptable to God because it comes
[44:14] from a better place and it is not just a
[44:17] casual worship somebody help me this
[44:20] morning it is not just a casual worship
[44:23] but it comes from a place of of being
[44:25] and understanding and knowing that you
[44:27] went through something to be here this
[44:29] morning
[44:31] can the church a man so if you have been
[44:35] through something and when you say
[44:36] hallelujah
[44:37] and God says yes that's my son or when
[44:40] you've been through something and you
[44:41] say thank you Jesus
[44:42] he touched my daughter
[44:45] because the angels can't sing like we
[44:47] can see me angels don't know about
[44:49] amazing Graceland
[44:51] anybody knows about his amazing grace
[44:54] that took us through this year it's it's
[44:58] amazing greens nothing but the grace of
[45:00] God when you look back you may be seated
[45:03] on you when you look back in your soul
[45:05] you'll never make it true you'll never
[45:07] be that bill you'll never be able to
[45:09] accomplish this you'll never be able to
[45:11] make that breakthrough you'll never be
[45:12] able to to get back on your feet and the
[45:14] devil told you you wouldn't even last
[45:16] this year but here you are this morning
[45:19] it's not you holding yourself at least
[45:22] when I am trying knows what I'm talking
[45:24] about if it's one person in the house
[45:26] and I'm not gonna call it I don't know
[45:28] anybody else you've got it
[45:31] but when your testimony becomes if it
[45:34] hadn't been for the Lord who was on my
[45:36] side where would I meet
[45:40] [Music]
[45:46] and the Bible said the Lord had cheated
[45:48] me soul but he had not given me your
[45:51] unto death because he's taking me
[45:53] through a process III can't define the
[45:57] process but he knows what it'll take to
[45:59] bring me to perfection he knows just
[46:02] what it'll take to bring me to adoption
[46:05] he knows the process to take me through
[46:07] that when the future is taking notes and
[46:10] walking around behind you he say yes
[46:12] that's a that's a good son that's a good
[46:14] daughter you throw this at him and he
[46:17] still worship you did this to her and
[46:19] she's still the worship oh come on
[46:21] somebody freaks back to me
[46:24] [Music]
[46:26] and above all else as the Apostle Paul
[46:29] said forgetting the things that are past
[46:32] you have to let go what's behind you to
[46:35] step our you cannot press the gas and
[46:38] the brakes at the same time let today be
[46:41] the beginning of a new creation let
[46:44] today be a team where you say I don't
[46:45] want to hear but yesterday I don't want
[46:48] to hear what last month I don't want to
[46:49] hear what last year God is the only
[46:59] employer who doesn't look at your resume
[47:02] [Applause]
[47:04] because your resume speaks of your past
[47:08] what you did whether it's good or bad is
[47:12] irrelevant to God he does not look at
[47:14] your past he is only interested in your
[47:16] destination he is only he's the blood of
[47:19] your future yes he's the god of
[47:21] yesterday yes he's the god of today but
[47:24] he is also a coda tomorrow and truly
[47:26] Apostle Paul he said forget about the
[47:28] past
[47:29] don't let your sin wear you down let's
[47:33] don't let go
[47:36] [Music]
[47:42] and it's it's it's not Jess you know and
[47:47] when Paul is speaking he's speaking from
[47:49] a place of deep understanding so
[47:51] brethren I count not myself and I know
[47:55] what he's saying after all I've been
[47:56] through I don't consider myself to know
[47:59] a lot I don't consider myself to
[48:01] understand a lot there's a lot that I
[48:04] don't know but this one thing I do it is
[48:12] one thing I do forgetting those things
[48:16] which are behind and reaching forth of
[48:19] the boss things which are before I press
[48:23] towards the month but the prize of the
[48:26] high calling of God Almighty and the
[48:28] Bible tells me that since the days of
[48:31] John the kingdom of God is Prince and
[48:33] every man every man
[48:39] [Applause]
[48:40] [Music]
[48:45] I just wanna encourage you this morning
[48:51] because I believe that the devil has a
[48:54] job to do and he is very good
[48:58] don't underestimate how good is at doing
[49:02] his job but don't also underestimate how
[49:05] good god is doing his job and don't also
[49:11] underestimate how good you are because
[49:15] as a seed in you that has a job to do
[49:17] also that just needs the right
[49:19] environment and in the right environment
[49:22] that see that has no choice but to
[49:24] perform in the right environment and
[49:27] when you plant the seed the seeds are
[49:29] planted in sugar it's not planted in the
[49:32] floor it's not planted in a clean please
[49:35] expanded in the mess in the muck and the
[49:38] mire in the manure and the messed up the
[49:41] more messed up it is is the more
[49:43] nutrients because the Bible said his
[49:45] strength is made perfect in our weakness
[49:48] so you look at your situation and see
[49:51] it's so messed up and Collison I led you
[49:54] there so that I can make you prosper it
[49:57] would not be your ability it will not be
[49:59] your wisdom it'll not be your thinking
[50:01] it will not be your strategy it will not
[50:04] be you but it will be me living through
[50:06] you for that when people see you they
[50:09] will take not that it is Jesus on the
[50:12] inside working on the else
[50:15] oh what a change in my life somebody
[50:18] cement so we came to the house of God to
[50:32] worship we came to the house of God to
[50:35] get reminded that we are creatures of
[50:38] eternity that is trapped in time as a
[50:41] proving ground and once we have been
[50:44] proven and tried we get to do what
[50:47] Abraham wanted to do and what David
[50:49] wanted to do and what Joshua wanted to
[50:51] do which was give the devil the poolman
[50:53] out Nahor blue we are here this morning
[50:59] as a wave sheaf for our family we are
[51:03] here as a wave sheaf for our love words
[51:05] we are here as a wave sheaf to prove
[51:08] that others are coming this is just a
[51:10] 40th of a glory NAT supporter unfold
[51:13] what is supposed to do something great
[51:15] in this season we are the end of the end
[51:19] you know there are many people would
[51:20] never talk
