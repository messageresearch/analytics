[1:05:49] 2018 and facing a new year new season
[1:05:53] and new opportunities it's a reminder to
[1:05:56] us that there's there's a possibility
[1:05:57] there's no hope there's a chance that
[1:06:00] something could happen for us if we
[1:06:02] could have the faith to believe that he
[1:06:04] is still a miracle worker you still a
[1:06:06] healer he is still a Baptizer he is
[1:06:08] still a restorer
[1:06:09] how many appreciate the service last
[1:06:11] week where August message from South
[1:06:13] Africa what a tremendous blessing and I
[1:06:18] they're having a time in Ghana Berube
[1:06:21] the preach last night again but all who
[1:06:23] preach this morning and we're a daily
[1:06:24] and where the context flows another
[1:06:26] meaning in Ghana but Paul's book as well
[1:06:28] and what a mighty victory I listened
[1:06:30] about his message from last night and my
[1:06:32] what a mighty mighty mighty visitation
[1:06:35] of God and we are we are under something
[1:06:38] and the devil cannot stop it the devil
[1:06:41] cannot stop it so ever thought this
[1:06:44] morning that I want to share with you
[1:06:47] and I pray that will be a blessing to
[1:06:50] you and I was just tearing in fact I was
[1:06:54] helping out with some cleaning at home
[1:06:56] and my wife was in the room and I said a
[1:06:59] thought just came to me you said what I
[1:07:01] said the thought just came to me you
[1:07:04] know and I was you know just many didn't
[1:07:06] seen you know going into unknown
[1:07:08] territory you need leadership you know
[1:07:12] and the thought is beginning to open up
[1:07:14] to me about spiritual leadership or
[1:07:17] without a spiritual leader we don't know
[1:07:20] where we're going and by the Branum
[1:07:22] taught us who the spiritual leader is
[1:07:24] the spiritual leader is not a man the
[1:07:27] spiritual leader is not there's not a
[1:07:29] human being the spiritual leader is the
[1:07:31] Holy Ghost he is the leader the Holy
[1:07:34] Ghost is the leader the Holy Ghost is
[1:07:35] the headquarters so as we approach 2019
[1:07:39] you know my burden in my heart is for us
[1:07:42] to be led and for us to be able to
[1:07:45] follow it's one thing to have a leader
[1:07:48] but if you don't know how to follow the
[1:07:49] leader then you just as bad as if there
[1:07:52] is no leader because you don't follow
[1:07:54] and then as I was looking through the
[1:07:56] prophets message in December of 2000 60s
[1:08:00] December story of 1965 when the Prophet
[1:08:03] left us the the very last message he
[1:08:05] preached was the message communion and
[1:08:07] just before that message what message
[1:08:11] did he preach leadership so but a random
[1:08:14] was leaving us with a nugget about
[1:08:16] leadership just before he went on to be
[1:08:19] with the Lord and he said a lot of
[1:08:20] powerful thing in those things in that
[1:08:22] message so we're gonna touch what the
[1:08:25] Lord wants us to touch depending on him
[1:08:27] this morning thank you musicians you
[1:08:29] appreciate a song service this morning
[1:08:31] and you might want an anointing so let's
[1:08:35] get straight to the wood if you have
[1:08:37] your Bibles would you turn it me we just
[1:08:38] gonna want or ssin of scripture reading
[1:08:41] from Romans eat and reading from verse 1
[1:08:46] this morning
[1:08:48] Romans eat reading from first one when
[1:08:56] you have it you could see men
[1:09:09] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:09:12] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[1:09:16] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:09:20] spirit for the law of the spirit of life
[1:09:25] in Christ Jesus had made me free from
[1:09:27] the law of sin and death for what the
[1:09:32] law could not do in that it was weak
[1:09:35] through the flesh God sending his own
[1:09:38] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[1:09:40] for sin condemned sin in the flesh that
[1:09:43] the righteousness of the law might be
[1:09:46] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:09:49] flesh but after the spirit I want you to
[1:09:53] take note of this for they that are
[1:09:55] after the flesh do mind the things of
[1:09:58] the flesh but they that are after the
[1:10:01] spirit the things of the Spirit
[1:10:03] for to be carnally minded is death but
[1:10:08] to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:10:11] peace because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:10:15] against God for it is not subject to the
[1:10:19] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[1:10:23] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[1:10:26] God I want to say it again they that are
[1:10:29] in the flesh cannot please God but ye
[1:10:33] I'm not in the flesh but in the spirit
[1:10:35] if so be so he's giving further clarity
[1:10:40] yeah I'm not in the flesh but in the
[1:10:42] spirit if so be that the Spirit of God
[1:10:45] dwell in you now if any man have not the
[1:10:49] Spirit of Christ he is none of his
[1:10:51] so if you are here this morning and
[1:10:54] there's no spirit of Christ in you you
[1:10:57] ought to run quickly to get that spirit
[1:11:00] of Christ in you because according to
[1:11:02] Paul's very clear teaching he's not
[1:11:04] mincing words here he's not trying to
[1:11:07] make people feel okay he's bringing it
[1:11:09] Clare he's bringing it direct now if any
[1:11:12] man have not the Spirit of Christ he is
[1:11:14] none of his
[1:11:15] and if Christ be in you not with you but
[1:11:20] in you the body is dead because of
[1:11:23] simba the spirit of life this is but a
[1:11:26] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:11:27] and then he goes on but if the spirit of
[1:11:30] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:11:32] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[1:11:34] from the dead shall also quicken your
[1:11:37] mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[1:11:39] dwelleth in you and umberto this message
[1:11:42] he preached it gonna last you say one
[1:11:44] day you're gonna realize that a raptor
[1:11:45] is in you you're not looking for the
[1:11:48] rapture but it's already inside of you
[1:11:51] it's a rapture in you therefore brethren
[1:11:55] we are debtors not to the flesh to live
[1:11:57] after the flesh but if we live after the
[1:12:00] flesh he shall die but if he true the
[1:12:03] spirit do mortify the deeds of the body
[1:12:06] ye shall live for as many as I led by
[1:12:10] the Spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:12:13] God so there are many people who claim
[1:12:15] to be sons of God but the qualification
[1:12:18] of sons of God those are not led by the
[1:12:21] Spirit of God and the Spirit of God
[1:12:23] could only lead you into certain places
[1:12:25] spirits of God cannot lead you into
[1:12:28] fornication the Spirit of God cannot
[1:12:30] leave you with the last time and lying
[1:12:32] him and the Spirit of God can lead you
[1:12:34] to I don't feel like coming to church
[1:12:35] today that can't be the spirit talking
[1:12:37] to you if you don't feel like worship
[1:12:39] and you're feeling because a spirit of
[1:12:43] clock only lead you to himself the
[1:12:46] Spirit of God can only lead you to the
[1:12:48] word spread of clock only lead to
[1:12:50] worship the Spirit of God leads you to
[1:12:52] counter things that I'm not as though
[1:12:54] the world
[1:12:55] the Spirit of God lead you to look at
[1:12:57] your sickness and say these are lying
[1:12:59] symptoms that that everything is of the
[1:13:02] demon and this demon has got to go
[1:13:04] through as many as I led by the Spirit
[1:13:08] of God they are the sons of God but he
[1:13:10] have not received a spirit of bondage
[1:13:12] again to fear but he have received a
[1:13:15] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[1:13:18] Father the Spirit itself Piron witness
[1:13:21] with our spirit that we are children of
[1:13:24] God so it's not just we are saying we
[1:13:26] are cheering up God but the Spirit
[1:13:28] bearing witness with our spirit
[1:13:31] it's not me saying I know carpenters
[1:13:34] corpse say I know you the spirit man
[1:13:36] witness with our spirit that we are
[1:13:40] cheering of God and if children then is
[1:13:43] as mean you have an inheritance and
[1:13:46] means you have access heir me and you
[1:13:49] have rights then is heirs of God and
[1:13:52] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:13:55] suffer with him how many wanna suffer
[1:13:58] with him this morning how many wanna
[1:14:01] suffer with him this morning that we may
[1:14:03] be also glorified together I'm not sure
[1:14:06] everybody raise your hands with it turns
[1:14:08] on the suffering so I reckon that the
[1:14:11] sufferings of this present time I'm not
[1:14:14] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:14:16] which shall be revealed in us for the
[1:14:18] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:14:20] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:14:23] sons of God made a lot of a blessing to
[1:14:26] the reading of his word you may be
[1:14:27] seated this morning and you can give the
[1:14:29] Lord a hand clap or praise let's it be
[1:14:33] the name of the Lord
[1:14:35] I feel very inspired this morning I
[1:14:42] believe this is our season I believe
[1:14:45] this is our time I believe this is our
[1:14:48] hour I believe this is what we were born
[1:14:50] for this is what we were born to do this
[1:14:53] is why we are here we're not here to get
[1:14:56] degrees and have a job and to have a
[1:14:57] can't have a house those are those are
[1:14:59] things you pick up along the way but I
[1:15:00] start our purpose those are part of the
[1:15:03] journey but we have a destination and
[1:15:05] it's to shake this world it's a turn
[1:15:08] things upside down it's to be conquerors
[1:15:11] it's to be rulers it's to be leaders he
[1:15:13] said you are royal priesthood you are
[1:15:16] kings you are priests he's speaking to
[1:15:18] leaders not speaking to followers a king
[1:15:22] is a leader a priest is a leader God
[1:15:25] came to call leaders not followers
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:30] we're gonna say a few things then we
[1:15:32] gonna get into the word too many people
[1:15:35] follow him following all kind of
[1:15:37] suffering by the Brandon proto there
[1:15:38] that they're only two influences they're
[1:15:40] not five influences they're not sixteen
[1:15:42] in the only two you influence from above
[1:15:45] or your influence from below nothing
[1:15:49] happens in the world with our leadership
[1:15:50] but they're Brandon Prager that's a
[1:15:52] child so we need to lead you to learn to
[1:15:54] help y'all to walk he said usually it's
[1:15:56] your mom who helps you and then your
[1:15:57] father he say he may not even be smarter
[1:15:59] than your mom better bound brought all
[1:16:01] that out but the leader is the father in
[1:16:03] the house it has nothing to do with his
[1:16:05] knowledge or his intellectuals
[1:16:06] qualification that's just how God set it
[1:16:08] up deal with it go back to the script
[1:16:10] you have a problem with it
[1:16:11] that's cause order God established
[1:16:13] that week she said growing up somebody
[1:16:16] has to lead you to any way to school and
[1:16:19] your school teacher had the chops to
[1:16:20] leave you and to teach you how to add
[1:16:22] and how to write your name but all of
[1:16:25] these human leaders were were what
[1:16:27] temporary because you were being groomed
[1:16:30] for real leadership and groom to being
[1:16:33] taught by the great tutor who is to show
[1:16:36] you who you really are not in this
[1:16:38] humanistic natural perspective but who
[1:16:40] you are as a teen of God because who you
[1:16:43] I hear is only a reflection of where you
[1:16:46] come from somewhere else
[1:16:47] if there was no other existence there
[1:16:49] will be no existence for you here
[1:16:52] representation by predestination so your
[1:16:55] nature your being your attribute your
[1:16:57] appetite what you like what you deal
[1:16:59] with the only way you could be here this
[1:17:02] morning because somewhere else in a
[1:17:04] nother dimension in another place
[1:17:06] [Music]
[1:17:08] there's another being that's just like
[1:17:11] you
[1:17:12] there's an appeal that has your
[1:17:15] attribute there's another peer that is a
[1:17:18] representation of you in another place
[1:17:20] [Applause]
[1:17:22] that's rapid advances death doesn't
[1:17:24] change who you are it just change your
[1:17:26] dwelling place if there was no
[1:17:28] representation over there you could not
[1:17:30] be worshiping here no wonder culture
[1:17:33] doctor where was Darwin and lay the
[1:17:35] foundation of the earth
[1:17:36] morning stars sang together because you
[1:17:39] were there you should appreciate what
[1:17:41] you're going through hear and understand
[1:17:43] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:17:46] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:17:48] glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:17:52] there's a glory that's coming but that
[1:17:55] glorious tide of suffering that glorious
[1:17:58] title we are in the reproach of the word
[1:18:00] of that glorious tide to you letting go
[1:18:03] of certain things up and taking some
[1:18:05] kind of pressure
[1:18:08] 20:18 oh it's hard that's good the
[1:18:11] harder it is the more pressure is the
[1:18:13] most suffering it is the more beautiful
[1:18:15] the glory the more you squeeze the rose
[1:18:17] the more the fragrance of the Rose of
[1:18:20] Sharon to come out oh come on let's be
[1:18:22] mature this morning how is spiritual
[1:18:25] this morning leadership when we hear the
[1:18:36] word leadership a number of things come
[1:18:38] to mind there's political leadership
[1:18:42] there's military leadership any student
[1:18:46] of history there's certain names you
[1:18:48] don't even know them by lastly we just
[1:18:49] have one name Caesar one name Moses
[1:18:56] leaders left such a mark on the world
[1:18:59] you just need to hear one in money
[1:19:01] you're not confused because they were
[1:19:03] leaders they did something that was
[1:19:06] different that went against the green
[1:19:08] that maybe other people said could not
[1:19:10] be done when the Wright brothers decided
[1:19:13] to build a aeroplane they were leaders
[1:19:16] something was anointing them something
[1:19:19] was inspiring them to do what had not
[1:19:22] been done before if they had listened to
[1:19:25] the criticism and followed everybody
[1:19:26] else the plane would have never been
[1:19:28] built Somali preach to me
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:34] there were other Jewish people is other
[1:19:36] Israel people around the time of Daniel
[1:19:38] but Daniel was different
[1:19:40] because Santa was anointing him to do
[1:19:43] what others don't want to do you see
[1:19:46] leaders cut their own path Lina's are
[1:19:49] not afraid to deal with challenges
[1:19:52] leaders are not afraid to stand alone
[1:19:55] followers need to be part of something
[1:19:57] that's why the whole gang mentality is
[1:19:59] because of the bunch of followers and
[1:20:01] they just want to be part of something
[1:20:02] that whereever we don't know but we go
[1:20:06] in but a leader could go against the
[1:20:08] crowd where you're going I'm inspired
[1:20:10] I'm seeking a city whose builder and
[1:20:12] maker is caught up not sure exactly
[1:20:15] where I'll end up but I'm believe it my
[1:20:17] family because I'm being led oh come on
[1:20:20] somebody please back to me so with the
[1:20:23] fathers in the house it's impossible
[1:20:26] future truly need unless you are being
[1:20:27] led it's like we're the only bridge when
[1:20:30] God was in control of Adam Adam had
[1:20:33] control over the years
[1:20:34] so his controllers based on the
[1:20:36] controller quart or hat over him so one
[1:20:39] moment the control from God was lost to
[1:20:42] Adam because he broke the Covenant Adams
[1:20:45] control of the earth also lost but when
[1:20:48] a man is being led by God it becomes
[1:20:50] easier to lead us family because he is
[1:20:54] under leadership under Authority the
[1:20:57] Centurion said I am a man under
[1:20:59] authority when I see him - uncle he was
[1:21:02] part of something bigger there's a
[1:21:04] higher ranking a Centurion so he
[1:21:06] understood because I'm under the
[1:21:08] authority if these men step off the line
[1:21:10] I can go higher than my rank and bring
[1:21:13] more soldiers to deal with my ready kids
[1:21:15] because I understand I am under
[1:21:17] authority I could give an instruction
[1:21:20] and say to one go
[1:21:21] and he has to go and I recognize Jesus
[1:21:25] are you also a man under Authority you
[1:21:28] come from a different place you come
[1:21:30] from a different power what does Jesus
[1:21:33] say I am the father one I will are you
[1:21:35] with me this morning the Christ is what
[1:21:39] our young people is their friend
[1:21:42] step out they are afraid to be out balls
[1:21:45] they are afraid to dress right act right
[1:21:48] because they want to follow what other
[1:21:51] people are doing but God is looking for
[1:21:56] leaders because he is the great leader
[1:21:59] there's no leader like our leader people
[1:22:03] celebrate their country's leader there
[1:22:05] their company leader but our leader is
[1:22:07] different with our leader he makes no
[1:22:11] mistakes our leader has never lost a
[1:22:14] battle our leader said all that the
[1:22:17] father has given me my son did have a
[1:22:20] choice our leader
[1:22:22] even when Lazarus was dead was able to
[1:22:24] take a dead man and bring him back to
[1:22:26] worship our leader is the only one to
[1:22:29] say I can lay my life down I pick it up
[1:22:30] again find me another leader to follow
[1:22:33] I've been looking for a leader to follow
[1:22:35] my whole life find me one who can lay
[1:22:37] his life down and pick it up again
[1:22:43] somebody say many may be seated
[1:22:45] I heard someone say yesterday he said to
[1:22:49] all the different religions he had no
[1:22:51] problem with no religion at all you say
[1:22:53] if you live in my morals and values one
[1:22:55] thing but he said you know what he said
[1:22:57] if you ever write a check you
[1:22:58] acknowledge that Jesus was here because
[1:23:01] the deed system is ad and BC so whether
[1:23:06] you're this or that or this or that it
[1:23:09] don't matter the fact that a man could
[1:23:11] have lived on this earth for thirty
[1:23:13] three and a half years and for thousands
[1:23:16] and years and a hundred years we still
[1:23:17] recorded before he was here and after he
[1:23:20] was here that's a leader can I talk
[1:23:23] about my leader this morning you ever
[1:23:27] say I'm talking with a leader who took
[1:23:29] men who couldn't write their names and
[1:23:31] there's a book of Peter
[1:23:33] oh come on somebody somebody talk back
[1:23:35] to me this morning man with no education
[1:23:37] but when the Holy Ghost came upon these
[1:23:40] men
[1:23:42] you may be seated in business school
[1:23:45] they tell you leadership is about
[1:23:47] influence Jesus has never forced anybody
[1:23:50] to follow him he's a gentleman he I
[1:23:54] stand at the door and knock If any man
[1:23:57] hear my voice but his voice is so sweet
[1:23:59] he said my sheep know my voice
[1:24:02] the momma Dee snapped up is that your
[1:24:04] leader my sheep know my voice and a
[1:24:10] stranger's voice they will not follow
[1:24:12] that's why you are here this morning you
[1:24:15] didn't come to hear man you can take
[1:24:17] here I'll fly such a great Shepherd
[1:24:18] because you are sheep oh come on
[1:24:21] somebody bridge back to me you may
[1:24:25] receive it we having a conversation this
[1:24:27] morning because what do we work for 2019
[1:24:29] we want to be led more than the lead us
[1:24:32] to the right job but they lead us at the
[1:24:35] right time sometimes caught our laws and
[1:24:37] booty and stick you in traffic because
[1:24:39] down the road you don't know what's
[1:24:41] gonna happen at quarters the Angels top
[1:24:43] the light make sure no it's not time for
[1:24:45] you to go yet because there's something
[1:24:46] going on down there when that's over you
[1:24:49] record you did frustrated DAV said the
[1:24:53] Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he
[1:24:56] leadeth me beside the still waters he
[1:24:59] [Applause]
[1:25:02] you know I walk through the valley of
[1:25:05] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:25:07] why because I were leader a great leader
[1:25:10] he could see beyond what I could see he
[1:25:13] can feel the change coming he knows how
[1:25:16] to protect me he knows how to provide
[1:25:18] for me he knows what my family needs you
[1:25:20] know what my house means he knows what I
[1:25:22] need you may be seated
[1:25:30] [Music]
[1:25:31] in speaking about leadership and a
[1:25:34] random typed US which as the Bible as a
[1:25:36] sheep and sheep I'm meant to be led
[1:25:41] she paid when I say you know what I got
[1:25:44] she caste is no clue you know she got
[1:25:52] planned no Kuen sheep are meant to be
[1:25:58] led
[1:25:59] but God caused Bulls horses you ever see
[1:26:02] what's nice Treasuries and horses I'm
[1:26:04] buzzing in many Wild West Minotauro
[1:26:07] hunting and lasso and have dog sir and
[1:26:10] pull them in and to break the horse and
[1:26:12] brick thing I'm Khaleesi period and I
[1:26:14] wanna fight him I don't wanna be kids
[1:26:15] but sheep come come you'll come
[1:26:25] but the problem with cheap is because
[1:26:27] sheep are men to be led didn't to be
[1:26:30] cautious what voice they listen to her
[1:26:34] because she was so vulnerable Brandon
[1:26:36] brought her that when it's time for
[1:26:38] shifted dyeing they should do what you
[1:26:40] know what but the promises they put out
[1:26:42] good I mean she was such a good follower
[1:26:45] that is she polity good and he caught no
[1:26:49] Jess how to jump over the slaughter
[1:26:51] thing and any sheep still following and
[1:26:53] one by one because his sheep is meant to
[1:27:02] follow so cause leadership is different
[1:27:08] than the women's leadership is and
[1:27:10] that's why sitting young people and I
[1:27:11] want you to understand this God is not
[1:27:14] about rules and and lean on law he's
[1:27:20] about influence and love and as you as a
[1:27:25] sheep and as those that I in love with
[1:27:28] God the more we get to love God and
[1:27:30] understand his love for us then we want
[1:27:32] to please him it not only becomes this
[1:27:35] is what I do and this is because it
[1:27:37] passes singing because noise because I
[1:27:39] love him so much I don't want to hurt
[1:27:42] him I love him so much I can't wait to
[1:27:46] talk to him
[1:27:46] I love him so much I can't wait to come
[1:27:49] into the presence of the Lord
[1:27:50] kinda should say man for this thing of
[1:27:55] leadership God has always wanted to lead
[1:27:59] his church himself but the Branham said
[1:28:03] this he said God was eventually gonna
[1:28:05] humanize his leadership the record
[1:28:08] humanity leadership how true Christ
[1:28:11] so another leadership through the Old
[1:28:14] Testament the first thing that should
[1:28:16] have been put in place was supposed to
[1:28:18] be Jesus
[1:28:20] that's the prophets teaching and a
[1:28:23] Robert brought her to the scripture that
[1:28:25] up until the same of the prophet Samuel
[1:28:29] everybody with me this morning
[1:28:30] it had been prophets and spiritual
[1:28:33] leaders but Abraham call it God was
[1:28:36] father King father and King but the tune
[1:28:42] of Israel in the current cycle look
[1:28:43] around and say poet now the Philistines
[1:28:46] have a king why do I have a king - and
[1:28:54] it bothered Sammy well so much that the
[1:28:58] Lord Souls animal Samuel they have not
[1:29:00] rejected you they have rejected me and
[1:29:04] that is how King Saul came to be king
[1:29:08] and while Saul was hidden there's a
[1:29:11] little shepherd who was being trained
[1:29:14] and how to work with sheep that wild
[1:29:17] Saul was in office God is speaking as
[1:29:20] Samuel and say I've found a better man
[1:29:22] to do this thing this is know whatever I
[1:29:26] wanted but under the circumstances I've
[1:29:27] already found a better man a man after
[1:29:30] my own heart
[1:29:31] and that's how David became King then
[1:29:35] the church say Amen so leadership isn't
[1:29:38] about title this done about position is
[1:29:40] not about leadership is about influence
[1:29:44] and when Abram said to differentiate you
[1:29:47] said the Christian ought to be the most
[1:29:49] ambitious boost in the world you can't
[1:29:51] be ambition Delia follow Anna you have
[1:29:53] to be ambitious about the kingdom of God
[1:29:55] he said bring this glorious gospel of
[1:29:58] eternal life to a dying and perishing
[1:30:01] world but if I said when there is no
[1:30:04] real courtly leader then the people
[1:30:06] begin to get into a morals I think
[1:30:09] that's what the matter with us today in
[1:30:10] our nation and our children and things
[1:30:12] we need godly leaders somebody has set
[1:30:14] an example the decline in this world is
[1:30:18] because of these two influences so the
[1:30:20] politicians as much as they can have the
[1:30:21] best of intentions they have been
[1:30:23] influenced to change the laws to make
[1:30:27] things acceptable error and we're never
[1:30:29] acceptable before the change our
[1:30:31] environment to change our because there
[1:30:33] are leaders and they are leaving and
[1:30:35] there be
[1:30:35] as well man in Genesis was made in the
[1:30:39] image of God Adam was led by the spirit
[1:30:42] he walked by the spirit he moved by the
[1:30:45] spirit in the cool of the evening
[1:30:47] God's Spirit God would come and commune
[1:30:50] with Adam can the church see man and
[1:30:52] everything was in order there was there
[1:30:54] was nothing out of place there was
[1:30:55] perfect fellowship perfect communion God
[1:30:58] will come down as he Adam how was your
[1:31:00] day and Adam could see well I moved this
[1:31:01] mountain and and this this lion I like
[1:31:04] he was good over there but I totally
[1:31:05] better over here I told him lion move
[1:31:07] over there and he did that because Adam
[1:31:10] was a leader on it under the Great
[1:31:12] Father God King Eli can the church say
[1:31:15] man but a pranam used the word divine
[1:31:17] fellowship Adam had the vine from the
[1:31:20] Supreme Court and Court was pleased is
[1:31:22] anybody here this morning one divine
[1:31:24] fellowship with God not divine phallus
[1:31:28] about the church not to be a sorcerer
[1:31:29] with a church but a relationship with
[1:31:32] God and God was pleased but when sin
[1:31:35] came it brought a disconnect and that
[1:31:38] sin brought hiding that sin brought here
[1:31:41] that shouldn't brought shame and still
[1:31:43] to this data people hiding hiding in the
[1:31:46] church hiding in shame but God comes to
[1:31:50] restore Adam did not know initially that
[1:31:52] there was a way back Adam didn't
[1:31:55] understand that there was blood and a
[1:31:58] blood sacrifice that existed before even
[1:32:00] he was there that God foresaw all of
[1:32:03] this taking place and here it was Adam
[1:32:05] feeling his hood he feeling troubled and
[1:32:08] I didn't even know that it was power in
[1:32:10] the blood he had his own interpretation
[1:32:12] and the drive fig leaves to cover him
[1:32:16] because they knew they were naked
[1:32:17] but God are already a provided way for
[1:32:20] restoration it wasn't gonna be his
[1:32:23] interpretation to bring them back it
[1:32:25] wasn't gonna be your way of doing it on
[1:32:27] my way of doing it but God already had a
[1:32:30] provided way to bring this black to
[1:32:32] fellowship God as leader
[1:32:34] saw sheep I got a string and he didn't
[1:32:37] leave it upon the Sheep to find a way
[1:32:39] back God walk out and met to see where
[1:32:43] the world or somebody preached back to
[1:32:45] me
[1:32:47] so close I'm leaving it up to you to
[1:32:50] find your way back

[1:33:19] church they're poor had some revelation
[1:33:21] the poor had some understanding but
[1:33:24] email got a genuine revelation of this
[1:33:28] blood sacrifice thing and even on the
[1:33:31] inspiration he was looking for the most
[1:33:33] beautiful offering but he took a lamb
[1:33:36] and he slit the truth of the lamb and
[1:33:37] the blood to get just spewing Oh God's
[1:33:40] not good because he saw a type of the
[1:33:43] lamb that was slain for the sins of the
[1:33:45] world God feel good evil didn't reveal
[1:33:48] that to himself but the great leader

[1:34:50] Bible is a sealed book
[1:34:52] anybody can pick it up but when you read

[1:34:57] prophet
[1:34:58] send messengers to unlock the secrets of
[1:35:01] this great book so we can sign away
[1:35:03] black to even find our way back to
[1:35:05] fellowship letter sheep we could look in
[1:35:08] here and see who we are see the pathway
[1:35:10] because this whole book is about the
[1:35:13] great Shepherd but the Planum said if
[1:35:15] you read the Bible and don't see Jesus
[1:35:17] in every verse you to read it again this

[1:41:05] time come to go into this land that they
[1:41:07] are heard about it already stories
[1:41:10] passed on from father to son one day
[1:41:14] it's a promised land they had heard
[1:41:17] about it
[1:41:17] land florid milk honey is our land and
[1:41:23] when the time come to cross over define
[1:41:27] 12 men I want you to understand how
[1:41:35] excited it was to have been selected you
[1:41:40] must be 12 another 2 million people
[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:49] sumwa soffit kill em eagle Joshua party
[1:41:55] Korea Gauri
[1:41:56] Ailsa - nabhi and gear I know some of
[1:42:00] you didn't know their names but those
[1:42:03] are the 12 brothers the hell they had
[1:42:08] chosen as leaders for God's people these
[1:42:12] were not have been light men you know
[1:42:15] because out of two million if you said
[1:42:17] in many promise I'm gonna find it very
[1:42:19] best men yet forgiving anybody to go and
[1:42:22] spy all this land you want to get it
[1:42:24] very best man for tribe so as these men
[1:42:28] supported upon is already there whole
[1:42:31] tribe saying yes that's our man bring
[1:42:34] back the report of how good a man is and
[1:42:37] one by one and men walk all day with his
[1:42:40] swords walking into this land of promise
[1:42:43] all leaders all knew the promise and
[1:42:50] when they got there they started eating
[1:42:52] grapes when the God didn't started tasty
[1:42:55] milk and honey and when they cut day
[1:42:57] they all saw the Giants it is not that
[1:43:01] these men were not brave enough these
[1:43:03] men died they all came back so the
[1:43:07] mission was accomplished what they went
[1:43:10] for because they brought back the report
[1:43:14] they were successful spies and they
[1:43:18] delivered a report the content of the
[1:43:20] report was a problem everything was
[1:43:22] correct except the conclusion the land
[1:43:27] is as described it's beautiful the
[1:43:30] grapes
[1:43:31] better than described honey when I tell
[1:43:34] you there's no honey ladies honey
[1:43:35] I see the striping is little chest doing
[1:43:38] it is perfect that's where we need to be
[1:43:42] that is the Promised One is we didn't
[1:43:46] was really wrong we went to the correct
[1:43:47] land this is the Promised Land
[1:43:49] we
[1:43:50] somebody else please this is the place
[1:43:52] that was described to us conclusion
[1:43:55] regarding leadership is about facing the
[1:44:03] challenge and meeting the challenge and
[1:44:07] Wendy Sparrow pottery test they give up
[1:44:11] Caleb and Joshua came back later as we
[1:44:14] all know because they was in a Terry a
[1:44:17] little moment with the grapes
[1:44:19] I mean Lannon walking a little better
[1:44:21] and put their foot in it I feel
[1:44:23] comfortable that this was theirs when
[1:44:24] they cut back then thought I was gonna
[1:44:26] get back to see everybody with his heel
[1:44:28] and his sword and spear ready to go in
[1:44:30] the Bible see when the club party who'll
[1:44:33] come you know just when fight will crime
[1:44:35] is is being horrible song he was he had
[1:44:38] two million people right and Caleb and
[1:44:43] Joshua cut back there and see what is
[1:44:45] going on I'm Bill Rancic
[1:44:47] he left a load box instead we seen let
[1:44:49] us go up at once but he damaged I
[1:44:52] believe it was already done sheep had
[1:44:54] already gone and because of that this is
[1:45:00] so cool so good so good forty years
[1:45:06] until the time appointed so I can
[1:45:10] imagine now that when Joshua came back
[1:45:12] around and was now facing Jericho there
[1:45:15] was no fear he had been through things
[1:45:16] before but he needed something more than
[1:45:18] his own understanding he needed
[1:45:21] spiritual leadership and as he stood
[1:45:23] there there was a noise and Joshua not
[1:45:26] taking chances drew in short right away
[1:45:27] I say are you for us or are you against
[1:45:30] us and I say put down your sword I am
[1:45:34] the great leader
[1:45:38] I'm the angel of the Covenant I come to
[1:45:41] give you the instructions on how to take
[1:45:42] this land and you will take it on this
[1:45:45] ways I will leave you and how to take it
[1:45:48] I will give it the directives on how to
[1:45:49] take it that Jericho in your life I will
[1:45:52] tell exactly how the ticket I know I've
[1:45:55] been waiting for leadership on how to do
[1:45:57] it for the whole 28 you know you don't
[1:45:59] know how to confront the situation but I
[1:46:01] come to let you know exact know to do it
[1:46:03] and the first thing gonna walk around
[1:46:05] one time don't shout yet just walk
[1:46:07] around and then come back they wanna
[1:46:09] take it as exercising but that's alright
[1:46:11] just keep it motors humming because the
[1:46:13] activity is important because they do at
[1:46:15] least they will know you're not dead
[1:46:16] just keep on walking make one lap gonna
[1:46:18] come back out
[1:46:19] on the second day do the same thing only
[1:46:23] till they do the same thing only 42 the
[1:46:26] same thing only 50 do the same thing on
[1:46:29] this sexy do this only seven day after
[1:46:32] you do it in normal way and they get
[1:46:34] comfortable at senior doing it this way
[1:46:35] do it again and then do it again I wanna
[1:46:39] do it seven times I will show so they
[1:46:42] can never shot before listen anybody
[1:46:45] listening to these instructions wouldn't
[1:46:47] understand how this thing works but just
[1:46:49] show us under leadership and when you
[1:46:52] are under leadership in this after all
[1:46:54] peak and when you obey transfer see when
[1:46:57] I picture show shout and when they
[1:47:00] shouted rather the walls begin to
[1:47:02] crumble because a spiritual leader had
[1:47:06] showed him exactly what to do
[1:47:08] can the church say Amen
[1:47:11] Oh hallelujah but a random said God as
[1:47:19] always wanted to lead us you know he's
[1:47:21] any problem with us we like to lead
[1:47:23] ourselves I really let other people
[1:47:25] leaders you say we don't want to wait to
[1:47:32] hear how to do it so you want to do it
[1:47:36] ourselves we rusty promise we're us just
[1:47:39] because we don't want to wait but
[1:47:40] corners are right timing here's a right
[1:47:42] way to do things is a way he does things
[1:47:45] are you looking to do it the right way
[1:47:47] for 2019 look into approach things more
[1:47:51] prayerfully look at this alone I'm
[1:47:53] waiting you before I go this way I want
[1:47:55] to hear from you put quad challenge
[1:47:58] court
[1:47:58] Gideon say listen listen if you see you
[1:48:00] are who you are then I need a saying
[1:48:05] each island girl you say if I put this
[1:48:07] Frisian and I mean get with it and keep
[1:48:11] code Tillis never do it I'm gonna make
[1:48:15] sure that I'm a lady right way I don't
[1:48:19] want to do things in my own strength
[1:48:21] I wanted to think of my own ability
[1:48:23] because I want to be led can the church
[1:48:26] amen
[1:48:27] from the message expectation brother
[1:48:30] branham said the same reason you are
[1:48:31] here tonight you sick people the same
[1:48:34] holy goes out let's see me on the same
[1:48:36] hole equals Atlanta Anna has led you
[1:48:38] here for you to believe that has a
[1:48:40] function open somewhere for your healing
[1:48:42] it's God's moving among his people young
[1:48:47] sister young brother the Holy Spirit
[1:48:49] will not lead you to listen to worldly
[1:48:50] music the Holy Spirit will I leave you
[1:48:58] to no boy in the world or girl in the
[1:49:00] world and then we end up in trouble
[1:49:04] you're coming to God and say well god
[1:49:06] help me
[1:49:07] and see what I never let you there you
[1:49:10] never came and get my advice
[1:49:11] you never acts to my leadership no you
[1:49:14] may want a bailout package I wanted to
[1:49:22] sink in friends because actions have
[1:49:26] consequences and when you do your own
[1:49:30] thing there will be consequences to do
[1:49:31] any whole thing I wanted to sink in deep
[1:49:35] because this is what it is this is
[1:49:37] kindly minded depending on your own self
[1:49:39] and you're not conscious of the spirit
[1:49:42] around man you're operating in the Lord
[1:49:44] and you're operating in it's different
[1:49:46] than the laws of the world I'm talking
[1:49:48] to you this a plant in your heart that
[1:49:53] this new year the Lord spare life for
[1:49:55] you you were two things differently not
[1:49:57] just from this year but
[1:49:58] every year in the past because look back
[1:50:01] through your history whenever you did
[1:50:04] think you always end up in trouble
[1:50:07] there's only one right way and that's
[1:50:09] God's Way and the whole what do you know
[1:50:14] is God's Way
[1:50:15] it's lines up with the word but a
[1:50:19] brannamon preaching on these things said
[1:50:21] it's not it's not hard to know if he's
[1:50:23] certainly leading you you spilled
[1:50:25] already told you don't forsake the
[1:50:27] assembling of ourselves together
[1:50:29] he spirit already told you don't be
[1:50:31] unequally yoked this word already told
[1:50:34] you flee youthful lusts because the
[1:50:39] Bible is the written form of the spirit
[1:50:42] and the spirit anyone cannot contradict
[1:50:45] itself so I don't a--first go out
[1:50:48] telling me no because what happened and
[1:50:50] what had happened was the office was
[1:50:51] having something and the moment he
[1:50:55] stopped the story so it kind of end up
[1:50:59] right the moment you start with what had
[1:51:02] happened was because that is Eve
[1:51:06] explanation well it and everybody is he
[1:51:09] blame game it wasn't me it was the boss
[1:51:10] what happened I just got promoted now so
[1:51:13] I didn't want to just see no just
[1:51:16] director to find another way to see no
[1:51:19] because I know I'm not supposed to steer
[1:51:22] you know but I said I said I steer very
[1:51:24] sadly very tour are more outside than in
[1:51:26] I know deeper hours on that side yeah
[1:51:32] but as I said by here and then they tell
[1:51:34] me well why you have to explain yourself
[1:51:38] the Holy Spirit will not lead you with
[1:51:40] her she replays one thing let's honor
[1:51:44] there's nothing left or no other there's
[1:51:45] no one thing leading and see the whole
[1:51:47] is really leading you or it devil in you
[1:51:50] [Music]
[1:51:56] the Bible says listen the road to hell
[1:52:04] is people the best of intentions and
[1:52:06] nothing people don't start off but I
[1:52:08] said and I said people don't ever say I
[1:52:10] want to go on
[1:52:11] nobody says I want to end up a drug
[1:52:12] addict nobody says that but it starts
[1:52:18] with influence small influence take a
[1:52:22] pull dos building you too young for a
[1:52:26] critical pool okay good take that and
[1:52:33] before you do you realize it your foot
[1:52:36] on top your head you can't find back
[1:52:39] your balance flee youthful lusts
[1:52:46] we appreciate a couple resist the devil
[1:52:48] and he will flee from you Jack your
[1:52:53] leadership this morning and it's not
[1:53:01] just for young people see with all of
[1:53:04] the moment the moment I see when you
[1:53:06] really have to fix and adjust your
[1:53:08] clothes you feel a not justice he was
[1:53:12] not just in before about Julia Benny
[1:53:14] Konaseema is fix it a little better
[1:53:15] something wrong because I am NOT yo
[1:53:19] Lewis and he's even watching you all the
[1:53:21] time when I can't see you what led you
[1:53:25] to dress that way I was sharing with my
[1:53:31] web the other day people like to blame
[1:53:32] and I said if you really accept
[1:53:36] responsibility moment you are the age of
[1:53:37] accountability you are responsible at
[1:53:40] that point if playing game is over you
[1:53:43] can't blame your children well if you
[1:53:45] know what my son tell me dies why I
[1:53:47] brake the car that's why you bring me
[1:53:48] what because you get so vex perhaps
[1:53:52] they're foolish woman destroy house with
[1:53:54] her own hands

[1:54:00] what will lead you I see people get
[1:54:03] vexed wacky effects your husband and do

[1:54:18] anybody have to clean it up because then
[1:54:21] you realize the gravity of the
[1:54:23] foolishness
[1:54:25] the magnitude of it in a and was it a
[1:54:28] future him okay sorry sorry wouldn't let
[1:54:31] you because but AB random Christian I
[1:54:35] want to this is not to make it comical
[1:54:37] but it's the reality of it because as
[1:54:38] either we have been led to Christ away
[1:54:41] from Christ because the Holy Ghost is a
[1:54:43] gentleman and the Bible says grieve not
[1:54:46] the Holy Spirit you grieve the holy
[1:54:49] sweat by your behavior by your conduct
[1:54:53] because the Holy Ghost is a tough it is
[1:54:55] gentle it is waited for the right time
[1:55:00] when your spirit is sweeter
[1:55:02] perfume man and your wife sees only
[1:55:04] against you and it is my like pj go with

[1:55:31] who are twenty eighteen degree C in
[1:55:33] class over you temper class with the
[1:55:35] temper class we still in temper class
[1:55:38] every man right there is D tempered
[1:55:40] glass
[1:55:40] God send something to Tessy temper some
[1:55:46] of us that praying that we would have
[1:55:47] improved but you have to pass it s

[1:56:03] known as your father loved your mother
[1:56:04] you know but as Christ loved the church
[1:56:06] it's not really love supposed to be the
[1:56:09] split not your own understanding of it
[1:56:11] but we already have the understanding of
[1:56:13] it husband loved it whereas Christ loved
[1:56:15] the church is a way to do it I'm Cora

[1:57:03] had been with Jesus and he was such a
[1:57:06] great leader people couldn't believe it

[1:58:32] be max fix or come next time because
[1:58:33] you're gonna make it yes I gotta make it
[1:58:35] that's positive reinforcement this is
[1:58:37] deeper than that
[1:58:38] there's a seed in your soul that is
[1:58:40] getting ready to be redeemed this can be
[1:58:42] casual to you you are being led into a
[1:58:45] journey all of her problems lie she was

[2:00:30] fellas on your road and you know it in
[2:00:31] this day is just different

[2:00:34] blow the horn and I see if I blow this
[2:00:36] one here no I never said that a cop was
[2:00:40] very a testimony because I know it was
[2:00:44] the only good salad made a blue unit but
[2:00:48] as me my human self say more than four
[2:00:49] let's do it on you wrote it if I reach I
[2:00:51] tell Kevin well what happened the car
[2:00:52] get caught up in it back then ever last
[2:00:54] onika well doing when I blow you or
[2:00:56] because I was just impatient so who'll
[2:00:58] negative Lori on life is about choices
[2:01:03] and your choices have been influenced
[2:01:06] either from above or from below it's
[2:01:09] very simple and you have to know what's
[2:01:16] influencing you and gonna take us
[2:01:18] through enough experiences to force us
[2:01:21] to our knees to call upon God more than
[2:01:25] we did before to face the challenge of
[2:01:28] this our peer anything is a challenge
[2:01:32] working in this world is a challenge
[2:01:34] it's not supposed to be easy for you
[2:01:36] your prayer can be Lord make it easier
[2:01:39] that's not that's a wrong prayer lord
[2:01:42] give me the strength of son give me the
[2:01:45] strength our testimony because you need
[2:01:47] a job but he could have a testimony in
[2:01:51] your child you can have a testimony in
[2:01:53] your neighborhood you don't have a
[2:01:54] testimony in your family can the church
[2:01:59] cement
[2:02:00] I said in Tegel Martin some time ago if
[2:02:03] your neighbors but no your Cristian

[2:02:08] recommend I say that put is the next you
[2:02:11] represent Christian what Cristiano what

[2:02:17] mother does talk to the father and the
[2:02:18] father chocolate what is your testimony
[2:02:24] because no words you could ever see can
[2:02:27] influence people with your life
[2:02:30] that is the testimony doctor Honda that
[2:02:34] shakes the devil I'm better Pelham says
[2:02:37] it I pray I get to the court later today
[2:02:40] but a brand said my child I'm trying to
[2:02:42] get to your life because your behavior
[2:02:44] has to change and your behavior change
[2:02:48] is not by your own choosing
[2:02:49] but it's balance in the Holy Ghost take
[2:02:51] control of these 16 elements to wall it
[2:02:54] off take control of your tongue off your
[2:02:56] attitude off your behavior we are
[2:03:03] hauling about all blessings but I wanted
[2:03:06] to do things our way when I see it so I
[2:03:09] already see it so you and I it's not how
[2:03:11] I didn't know it and I saw oh how I did
[2:03:13] see it yeah really good court yet but I
[2:03:16] know how you see it what is leading you
[2:03:24] Church what is leaving you
[2:03:26] young people are you so focused on your
[2:03:29] career so focus on your academics so
[2:03:33] focus on making money that you miss your
[2:03:36] true calling
[2:03:38] it is finding the right balance you know
[2:03:40] but I random total you see a plan as if
[2:03:43] he's coming into an air but live as if
[2:03:45] he's coming tomorrow so let that be your
[2:03:47] thermometer let that be your check let
[2:03:50] that be your accountant balance if he
[2:03:52] calls me tomorrow
[2:03:53] am I ready because life is about
[2:03:57] sacrifice if you will make sacrifice of
[2:03:58] order one to sacrifice by remembering in
[2:04:10] secondary school we are choosing service
[2:04:13] I see I stayed home to study and when I
[2:04:17] checked myself I really do much study it
[2:04:20] how do I tell myself this thing here

[2:04:58] to give you grace it as if I am unless
[2:05:01] you have a horn and he said have any
[2:05:03] middle any campus preaching and unless
[2:05:10] God commissioned you for that ministry
[2:05:13] they will lick you up because it only
[2:05:17] only goes your natural ability your
[2:05:19] intellectual cafe that you want to be
[2:05:24] long thankfully I just I just never was
[2:05:26] no gangster or anything but I see young
[2:05:30] people going to university and in two
[2:05:31] weeks they walk change the loose
[2:05:34] coordination you know because that walk
[2:05:36] is not a coordinated walk you said your
[2:05:38] right hand supposed to go with your left
[2:05:39] foot and your left hand with your right
[2:05:42] foot this way suppose a walk whenever I
[2:05:44] said a walks or walk it's a different
[2:05:50] spirit man talk about it young lady went
[2:05:52] any by the spirit came upon her and she
[2:05:56] went back to testify to somebody but she
[2:05:57] had no holy goes to go in at the
[2:05:59] environment she wasn't allowed to go
[2:06:01] there cuz if she was left to go there
[2:06:03] Gordon of forty fighter to deal with
[2:06:04] that challenge but I ran out to cast out
[2:06:07] the devil from her because she was never
[2:06:09] left to go there but I bet even preach
[2:06:11] the whole message to enjoy the service
[2:06:13] of it being his will UK leaders say
[2:06:15] without feeling like ago and my cousin
[2:06:17] and them and no no you wait for God to
[2:06:20] leave you
[2:06:21] [Applause]
[2:06:25] but a Branham never preempted is amaway
[2:06:29] 10 on the angel of the Lord
[2:06:30] I'm a better man I'm preacher wedding
[2:06:32] Holy Ghost is given for he said nobody
[2:06:34] knew upper roof that I say well already
[2:06:35] now and Oh Peter said shut up until the
[2:06:38] sound came from heaven as of a rushing
[2:06:40] mighty wind what are we waiting on
[2:06:42] leadership of the Holy Ghost
[2:06:47] but if an Sivakasi something good do see
[2:06:50] nothing at all see a white getting upset
[2:06:53] you with evil leadership on how to get
[2:06:55] you right would help us the comet this
[2:07:00] is something nice because is either it's
[2:07:02] really - it's really - absolutely proper
[2:07:03] give you know don't see nothing or see
[2:07:06] something nice II think it was at
[2:07:08] eruption or somebody say man there's
[2:07:14] there's no tear up Solano brothers and
[2:07:16] sisters the same thing see something
[2:07:18] nice or does anything and if you
[2:07:22] actually why so quiet still does
[2:07:24] anything all these are women's listen
[2:07:32] this gospel I'm not preaching preaching
[2:07:35] that I'm ready is this the nae air
[2:07:36] service before or last night tomorrow
[2:07:38] night will preach tomorrow night but
[2:07:41] it's about life Jesus when he went here
[2:07:44] good he would just talk to the people
[2:07:46] because you want to see a change in
[2:07:48] behavior because if you come at the
[2:07:53] church all years and you still
[2:07:54] disrespect in your husband he's already
[2:07:57] look anymore you know but Iran I'm in
[2:08:00] the same message leadership you see a
[2:08:02] little boy never saw a mirror before and
[2:08:04] he came into the house and he looking in
[2:08:06] mirror but if I see 20 years and he
[2:08:08] recommends here start rock turkey face
[2:08:10] he sees mommy that's me so if the wood
[2:08:13] is going for and you see yourself
[2:08:15] recognize a name that's not me become a
[2:08:18] balance when you look into the wood is
[2:08:19] was a see Christ looking back at you if
[2:08:21] you see any you looking back at yourself
[2:08:22] with all your batteries you can look
[2:08:24] again until you see you were living out
[2:08:27] and waiting to lift you would can you
[2:08:30] see your children look at you different
[2:08:32] and you become a magnet because Jesus
[2:08:36] did not do big grand education trying to
[2:08:39] put poet intellectuals but his life was
[2:08:41] a magnet Peters life became a magnet
[2:08:45] Paul's life became a magnet just by the
[2:08:48] way they live can the truth say man I'm
[2:08:52] still stuck here and I stay here for as
[2:08:54] long as it takes because we want we want
[2:08:57] to be different going forward we have to
[2:09:00] decide you know when you get baptized I
[2:09:02] have decided to follow Jesus no turning
[2:09:05] back no turning back let that be your
[2:09:08] prayer today I have decided to follow
[2:09:10] Jesus I have this study tool of the Holy
[2:09:13] goes to lead me whether he leaves you in
[2:09:16] a trial that his tries to lead you into
[2:09:18] a trial because if he leaves you in that
[2:09:20] trial is a trial design to develop your
[2:09:22] character but don't put yourself in
[2:09:24] trouble because you were feeling that go
[2:09:26] into trouble and the church say Amen the
[2:09:35] Styles the fashion carnally minded is
[2:09:38] death
[2:09:38] what is kindly minded sometimes we may
[2:09:40] be assumption people know what what
[2:09:41] these things mean kinda means when
[2:09:44] you're when your flesh rule in your life
[2:09:47] its flesh could be your mind your flash
[2:09:51] your food anything if anything you just
[2:09:56] music your clothes your company your
[2:10:01] words let your words glorify God always
[2:10:07] let your dress glorify God let the
[2:10:11] people you spend time with who you
[2:10:13] spending time with because if you are
[2:10:17] not the influencer positively then you
[2:10:19] are being influenced and if you're not
[2:10:25] so never nobody because you this you are
[2:10:29] recluse you are hermit that is also of
[2:10:32] the early because if I said God and the
[2:10:35] only word I'm preaching gospel you
[2:10:37] supposed to be influencing
[2:10:39] you didn't see let's lock up in a room
[2:10:41] it's one thing if I just secret closet
[2:10:44] that's fine but who have you testify to
[2:10:47] but a Branham said if you don't testify
[2:10:48] every goodness you'll find self backed
[2:10:50] into one day I didn't realize when it
[2:10:52] happened yes backslidden you're still
[2:10:53] coming about back sittin listen
[2:10:55] friends when somebody stop coming to it
[2:10:57] it's not that that deal a dishonor
[2:10:58] before he did it decide it or not it's
[2:11:01] when they finally reach the point that
[2:11:02] they've brave enough to not come but it
[2:11:07] but slept months ago the joy SATA feed
[2:11:13] this sing any song Jessie mouth moving
[2:11:17] there's no real worship with your hands
[2:11:19] and lift your hands is it a response it
[2:11:22] is some leader but not a response it
[2:11:23] would kind of it's not hot but when it's
[2:11:29] hot you don't matter who next to you
[2:11:31] doesn't matter what beside you it
[2:11:33] doesn't matter if you have no money it
[2:11:35] doesn't matter if you're about job it
[2:11:36] doesn't matter because there's something
[2:11:38] else controlling you can the church is
[2:11:42] this happen anybody this morning could
[2:11:46] we keep on going in return and Jubilee
[2:11:50] but if I said the church is a
[2:11:52] born-agains bunch of believers that's in
[2:11:55] Christ by the Holy Ghost so that's a
[2:11:56] definition of the church it's not
[2:11:58] measured by attendance or knowledge or
[2:12:00] interpretation but the church is a
[2:12:02] born-again bunch of believers that's in
[2:12:05] Christ by the Holy Ghost led by the
[2:12:08] Spirit of God they are not of the world
[2:12:10] they are out of the world they are
[2:12:13] different from the world that's what
[2:12:15] make them what they are different from
[2:12:17] the world so if people can tell you are
[2:12:20] different than the world then you don't
[2:12:21] qualify for this coat come on somebody
[2:12:24] preach back to me there has to be
[2:12:28] something different about your walk
[2:12:29] there has to be a better way a more
[2:12:33] excellent way because you are a
[2:12:36] Christian because you are in the bride
[2:12:37] because you are in the body because you
[2:12:40] are called
[2:12:41] because you are separated because you
[2:12:43] are chosen people because you are
[2:12:44] peculiar people
[2:12:47] and the church see man they are
[2:12:50] different from the world maybe be
[2:12:52] different from the world maybe be happy
[2:12:54] to be different on the world may be
[2:12:57] happy hava testimony I don't drink I
[2:13:00] don't smoke I don't party I'm happy that
[2:13:02] was testimony because clogged up the
[2:13:05] whole of my life
[2:13:06] it's not my own choosing but his love

[2:16:03] ding ding ding I see has he been in
[2:16:05] church well sometimes he cannot believe
[2:16:07] and I said what did he prophets say I
[2:16:10] said he prophesied under no
[2:16:13] circumstances should I believe I'm Mario
[2:16:15] unbeliever there's no truth
[2:16:18] interpretation of that is either we in
[2:16:22] the prophet mentioned we not see any
[2:16:23] prophet message you say unknown know

[2:29:06] remember the Billy Paul was in trouble
[2:29:08] and he came to his father but about him
[2:29:11] said to him son you did the sinan you go
[2:29:15] to the praying there's no excuse for
[2:29:18] this you've got to do what you got to do
[2:29:21] you've got to get your house in order is
[2:29:24] either you accept your situation as
[2:29:26] permanent or you resolve to change it
[2:29:29] there are only two options it is either
[2:29:31] you accept that your son is in the world
[2:29:33] or your resolve today that is gonna
[2:29:34] change not by their own action but by
[2:29:37] you storm in heaven like that widowed
[2:29:39] woman who went to the door of the unjust
[2:29:41] judge who didn't regard God or man
[2:29:44] in other words you couldn't tell that
[2:29:46] man court sent you he has no regard for
[2:29:48] God have no regard for man but that
[2:29:50] woman knock on the door until the
[2:29:55] adjuster said enough is enough I can't
[2:29:57] take it no more what you want what you
[2:30:00] want what you want have you knocked on
[2:30:03] the door until God said what you want or
[2:30:08] not once and see well here and Sonia you
[2:30:11] are not you have you reached a point yet
[2:30:13] when enough is enough because when you
[2:30:16] reach your breaking point of desperation
[2:30:18] till you know I won the Holy Ghost more
[2:30:21] than life itself
[2:30:22] I want my son to have an experience more
[2:30:25] than anything else I want my daughter to
[2:30:26] have an experience I want my family I
[2:30:29] want to apply the blood on my house I
[2:30:31] know my son is in trouble I know my
[2:30:33] daughter-in-law is in trouble but lord I
[2:30:36] would have knocked on the door I'm gonna
[2:30:38] knock when nobody else is watching I'm
[2:30:39] gonna go and walk on the street and call
[2:30:41] upon your name
[2:30:42] no demon could touch you because you are
[2:30:44] protected by angels
[2:30:46] you can walk and say God I need you and
[2:30:48] call with the space angels
[2:31:02] I'm sorry for those who who measure
[2:31:05] service by time today is not that be I'm
[2:31:13] feeling just as strong as when I first
[2:31:14] as it out this is our thing I combine
[2:31:22] with youth I was young too young people
[2:31:28] feel that that what they go and show no
[2:31:29] we understand not as young as I used to
[2:31:33] be buzzy seemed devil different tactics
[2:31:38] different weapons different tools how
[2:31:46] the enemy is so deceitful but abarim
[2:31:48] stood and said shoot the TV because of
[2:31:50] what was coming through the movies now
[2:31:55] we have voice on TV because every cell
[2:31:57] phone is a supercharged weapon that he'd
[2:32:00] ever just sending all kinds of stuff in
[2:32:02] me say should be for now so may say if
[2:32:10] you want to know how many people home
[2:32:11] just switch off the Wi-Fi you wonder get
[2:32:17] a head count let's switch off the Wi-Fi
[2:32:20] see we'll come on the rooms didn't know
[2:32:22] existed people connected to the Internet
[2:32:29] connected to politics connected to
[2:32:32] economic is connected to celebrities and
[2:32:36] information and they're being slowly
[2:32:38] sippin on this juice of iniquity styles
[2:32:43] from whoever it is and they don't even
[2:32:49] understand this influence and hold the
[2:32:53] desire to behold he's disappearing the
[2:32:55] problem is God doesn't change so he says
[2:32:58] I am holy and I changed not
[2:33:00] so we changed but he does not change his
[2:33:03] requirement has the cheetah standard has
[2:33:05] not change his laws have not changed
[2:33:11] meanwhile what was never accepted years
[2:33:14] ago laws are being adjusted that forces
[2:33:18] the sodom and gomorrah situations and we
[2:33:20] have become softer because we ought to
[2:33:22] be tolerant iniquity but God will never
[2:33:26] tolerate energy you will never tolerate
[2:33:28] sin there's no exception to the rules of
[2:33:30] God and that's why but a parent city
[2:33:33] will have to shut down the churches
[2:33:36] that's why because the laws were change
[2:33:40] and it's either you bend to the laws or
[2:33:45] you stand up for what is right but the
[2:33:49] panel said the bride will be a hunted
[2:33:51] persecuted group let's see how many
[2:33:53] could see another anointing you don't
[2:33:58] have a testimony now when the press
[2:34:01] comes when the squeeze comes when the
[2:34:04] pressure comes and that's why all the
[2:34:05] foolishness and the massive awards and
[2:34:07] groups on division then I'm gonna ask
[2:34:09] you which interpretation of the message
[2:34:10] you have did you believe cause I'm a
[2:34:13] prophet did you believe that being gay
[2:34:15] and this and that arises is wrong they
[2:34:17] say well well is that is not how it
[2:34:19] where he was you really tried to see it
[2:34:26] right is right wrong is wrong
[2:34:29] a cabbie 99% courage and well we're just
[2:34:34] said now because it's 2019 so what
[2:34:37] worked in 65 ATP you know it's different
[2:34:38] the difference it's not a different time
[2:34:40] as a sim devil see him develop for
[2:34:42] Elijah that fourth Moses and for Joshua
[2:34:45] that was here at Malachi and was here
[2:34:47] when John James and Jeff 70 were all
[2:34:49] here is he seemed ever but the Bible
[2:34:52] tells we're not ignorant of Satan's
[2:34:54] devices there's nothing new he bring to
[2:34:56] us because the god we are fighting with
[2:34:59] who is fighting with us and the Angels
[2:35:01] have also been around longer than he
[2:35:04] wants oh god help us and took the keys
[2:35:22] that's why the devil is afraid of us
[2:35:24] because Isaiah I'm Joshua and Elijah
[2:35:28] they gave the devil trouble but when
[2:35:29] Jesus came and took the keys of death
[2:35:31] and hell on the grave a lot the devil
[2:35:34] now has nothing that's why the Prophet
[2:35:37] is said that there is a bluff he let's
[2:35:39] try to tell you you have problems you
[2:35:41] have no problems
[2:35:42] you only have blessings you only have
[2:35:46] blessings the pain in your bodies
[2:35:49] remaining your lives because if you tell
[2:35:54] you have him and he promised to take
[2:35:56] your pain away
[2:35:57] somebody please back to me
[2:35:58] [Applause]
[2:36:03] hallelujah glory to God
[2:36:07] brother I can wait one deep to put my
[2:36:10] foot on the devil the Bible says one day
[2:36:13] we'll ask the question is this the one
[2:36:15] who caused all this trouble because
[2:36:19] Brian to this bride will be fulfilled
[2:36:22] all that was promised Elijah is waitin
[2:36:25] on us moses waitin on us but a problem
[2:36:28] with animals but a jerem waited enough
[2:36:31] to bring on the resurrection we shall
[2:36:37] not all sleep but we shall be changed
[2:36:39] thank God for the Holy Ghost who is
[2:36:42] leading us into all truth so we can know
[2:36:45] how to prepare hallelujah give the Lord
[2:36:57] a sort of praise even if you don't
[2:37:00] understand give him a shout of praise
[2:37:02] your worship to him is not based on
[2:37:04] understanding is based on who he is
[2:37:07] He is God he is king of kings he is Lord
[2:37:10] of lords he is the great I am he is the
[2:37:12] great Shepherd he is our king he's our
[2:37:15] leader he's our master

[2:38:07] daughters of God
[2:38:09] you may be seated that's what a little
[2:38:19] this down so you know what to expect
[2:38:22] because listen ignorance is trouble in
[2:38:25] them when they don't know it's do Devils
[2:38:28] have you locked up in half of businesses
[2:38:35] be sin ignorant people go in right

[2:38:49] trouble but he still nice a credo we're
[2:38:52] gonna Nancy anything cheaper but because
[2:38:56] you don't know but that's why Paul said
[2:39:01] to Timothy study the shares have
[2:39:04] approved the problem in this message is
[2:39:06] people don't study that's the problem
[2:39:08] that's a real problem
[2:39:09] people don't pray people don't read
[2:39:11] their Bibles people do not study the
[2:39:13] message of Malachi form people watch
[2:39:15] movies people watch the news people read
[2:39:18] their papers I suffered somebody
[2:39:20] recently and they told me so much about
[2:39:21] American politics and they live in sure
[2:39:23] I couldn't believe it
[2:39:24] I didn't understand channel politics he

[2:39:42] prophet say this how do you piece this
[2:39:44] listen the Prophet never taught us to
[2:39:46] blindly follow any man never never ever
[2:39:52] ever doesn't exist
[2:39:54] but app random taught us he said Paul
[2:39:57] was the gold standard in other words
[2:39:59] that even measuring-rod if you want to
[2:40:02] know how a minister's was he measured go
[2:40:04] to Paul's ministry and Paul taught it
[2:40:07] like this he said follow me
[2:40:08] conditionally as I follow Christ so it
[2:40:11] means you're following a Paul had to be
[2:40:14] based on your revelation of who Christ
[2:40:15] is a piece on his word because I see
[2:40:18] only ways you can show in a poll could
[2:40:21] you explain that to me because of
[2:40:22] quality Scriptures and the condom what
[2:40:24] Christ taught that little off so poor

[2:41:18] played it over and over till God helped
[2:41:21] me to this dear target of my head not
[2:41:24] all plants and animals are eaten some
[2:41:26] die and fall back to the ground these
[2:41:28] dead organic substances are reduced
[2:41:31] simpler substances the process by which
[2:41:34] this is done is called the key the key
[2:41:36] is caused by small plants or bacteria
[2:41:38] called funky like other living organisms
[2:41:40] bacteria so you need food to live they
[2:41:43] cannot get your own food as the green
[2:41:45] plants too so they get your food by
[2:41:48] [Music]
[2:41:52] [Applause]
[2:41:53] form five eleven years old cannot get it
[2:41:57] out of my head
[2:41:59] know what happens with young people able
[2:42:02] to look at them and say resist the devil
[2:42:04] he was here do I walk to the valley
[2:42:07] shadow of death you think any devil
[2:42:09] català listen Jesus defeat the devil
[2:42:15] with the written word
[2:42:16] he had no Bible with him to pull I
[2:42:18] wonder what I will use the fight him he
[2:42:20] said it is written man shall not live by
[2:42:24] bread alone but by every word that
[2:42:27] proceedeth or not of God it just came
[2:42:29] out of him because it was locked up
[2:42:31] inside of him you may be seated the
[2:42:39] Bible told us out of the abundance of
[2:42:41] the heart emojis it is what you're
[2:42:44] feeding on that's what you live out see
[2:42:47] your feet on carnality and must live all
[2:42:49] tonality but if you're feeling
[2:42:51] unattended or spirit your muscle about
[2:42:53] the things of the Spirit
[2:42:54] [Applause]
[2:43:01] you may be seated
[2:43:03] the other day I was telling Oh Christmas
[2:43:07] I never plays PlayStation in my life
[2:43:09] tell my wife I wonder if I should get
[2:43:11] one because I'm trying to understand
[2:43:13] this thing people spending hours
[2:43:16] sleeping at night playing a game and
[2:43:22] then they say well they get in trouble
[2:43:25] to move up in the trouble guys if you
[2:43:28] put on the game and focus on your work
[2:43:30] trust me you will get promoted because
[2:43:34] it bears any harder with diligence
[2:43:36] mid-fight so whatever your focus your
[2:43:38] energy on that is what you will get
[2:43:40] blessed with it as it is with it natural
[2:43:43] it seemed really spiritual if your
[2:43:46] meditate it is there many tell you what
[2:43:48] day and night you will have good so
[2:43:54] listen anybody for 2019 tell me they're
[2:43:58] not successful you are actually telling
[2:44:00] us
[2:44:09] but upon together in this class this
[2:44:12] morning the measure of your success is
[2:44:18] directly mathematics it directly
[2:44:20] proportionate is my right breast even
[2:44:22] the measure of success is mathematically
[2:44:25] directly proportionate to the level of
[2:44:27] study you're doing any morning and
[2:44:29] evening so if you increase the morning
[2:44:32] and increase the evening with your
[2:44:35] meditation on the word so will your
[2:44:37] success increase live you want more
[2:44:39] success but a parent said he wished you
[2:44:41] a happy purpose accessible new year he's

[2:44:46] humanity turnover the modesty becomes
[2:44:48] your world listen is not his message is

[2:45:28] nobody go to work tomorrow we can steal
[2:45:31] from now until tomorrow night
[2:45:33] kanna-chan same
[2:45:35] [Music]
[2:45:40] port was preaching and the service went
[2:45:44] on until a - for long did they even
[2:45:46] close a bishop Rafi brief you in
[2:45:48] terrorism a quitter and went back would
[2:45:49] put when went back to preaching but you
[2:45:53] have to love this thing when you love
[2:45:58] God you love his people you love one
[2:46:02] another the back - you're supposed to be
[2:46:04] you're supposed to be happy when they
[2:46:06] come together like this because this is
[2:46:08] your family
[2:46:09] this is your family I'm not yes - also I
[2:46:15] in this physical good little buddy buddy
[2:46:17] of Christ that is your family you cannot
[2:46:20] see wars listen if Minister want to see
[2:46:22] what size demeanor but if people win
[2:46:24] that because he was she supposed to what
[2:46:30] he see sheep but there I have some birds
[2:46:33] and goats in the middle because boutique
[2:46:35] and fight Church fight anything but
[2:46:38] sheep all sheep scene and sheep when
[2:46:40] sheep see sheep is a fellowship whenever
[2:46:43] I said one day the rain will fall I many
[2:46:45] talk to them sheep together because
[2:46:47] there's no division over there there's
[2:46:49] no heater over there s none of that we
[2:46:51] need more love we need more of God we
[2:46:54] need to get man out of the way so at the
[2:46:57] Holy Spirit which is the leader of the
[2:46:59] church will take his place when man or
[2:47:02] do we
[2:47:02] listen God have Liberty to move I can't
[2:47:08] wait for isakova to disappear no
[2:47:10] whatever it says it he want to see to
[2:47:12] you over then because any Holy Spirit
[2:47:15] has t complete control guide you how to
[2:47:19] pray who to bring for Jesus was led he
[2:47:23] came there by the Pool of Bethesda he
[2:47:26] could have prayed for everybody but he
[2:47:30] was also led so a man who was there for
[2:47:32] 28 years
[2:47:34] critics in this message mercy Jesus edgy
[2:47:37] they said when I knew one man boy how he
[2:47:40] moved so that's the Liberty to not
[2:47:43] answer where angels are free to tread we
[2:47:46] criticize him I don't know why who
[2:47:47] preach who came to preach why you say
[2:47:49] that
[2:47:50] service is still going on and people
[2:47:51] have open anything to say and she says
[2:47:54] Kim came to a one month and say well
[2:47:57] don't be made who I mean man toward
[2:48:01] Jesus come to help in many water
[2:48:05] he didn't even know who was talking she
[2:48:09] took him on a mission to help that man
[2:48:11] because he's a God who goes after sheep
[2:48:13] always individuals so when we come to
[2:48:16] preach earnest church service is never
[2:48:18] to the group there's somebody in here
[2:48:20] this morning some sheep who was drifting
[2:48:23] away that the Holy Ghost arrested you
[2:48:25] and pulling you right back into the
[2:48:27] pasture where you could be protected by
[2:48:30] the great Shepherd and the church say
[2:48:33] Amen so I was gonna read a few course
[2:48:40] and then rewind on the musicians you
[2:48:42] could come we try to close out sums of
[2:48:47] gonna let by the Spirit of God not led
[2:48:50] by some other fanatics I'm reading from
[2:48:52] the prophet or some organization or
[2:48:54] something or another they're led by the
[2:48:56] Spirit of God the Holy Spirit was given
[2:48:59] to the church to be the overseer the
[2:49:02] tutor that was to raise the churn of God
[2:49:04] not our bishops and Cardinals and so
[2:49:07] forth but the Holy Ghost I'm expecting
[2:49:11] the Holy Ghost not denomination not a
[2:49:14] bishop not a Catholic priest not a
[2:49:16] Baptist preacher or Pentecostal preacher
[2:49:19] I'm expecting the Holy Ghost to come
[2:49:21] down and set in order a church that will
[2:49:25] go to meet him filled with the power and
[2:49:27] the resurrection of Christ I'm expecting
[2:49:30] that I believe that God promised tip
[2:49:32] that did be a church here without spot
[2:49:35] or wrinkle on it I'm expecting it
[2:49:37] because God said it was so can the
[2:49:40] church say Amen so we look you know
[2:49:44] special money but a number of it little
[2:49:45] bit pull it up big bazooka no message
[2:49:49] Pope no you know member of it the Holy
[2:49:54] Ghost
[2:49:55] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost from the
[2:49:59] mess of the Word made flesh if your
[2:50:01] heart and your mind is so and in filled
[2:50:03] with God's Spirit listen now to
[2:50:06] spiritual leadership or divine
[2:50:08] leadership in action until your thoughts
[2:50:11] become his thoughts amen there you are
[2:50:13] when your mind and your leading and your
[2:50:16] guy becomes a direct place or a direct
[2:50:19] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's
[2:50:21] moving your mortal being oh my what kind
[2:50:23] of people should we be if the very Holy
[2:50:27] Spirit has you so embodied or empowered
[2:50:29] that you don't use your own thoughts too
[2:50:32] many of us using our own thoughts you
[2:50:35] don't use your own mind that sounds
[2:50:37] hollow you know but I have an opinion I
[2:50:40] have a position I have and God's saying
[2:50:42] I want to shoot that mind out I don't
[2:50:45] want your opinion
[2:50:46] I don't want your idea you don't use
[2:50:50] your own mind you don't use your own
[2:50:52] opinion I'm reading from the prophet but
[2:50:54] the Holy Spirit has you so built until
[2:50:57] your thoughts and your being is God's
[2:50:59] Spirit expressing itself through you
[2:51:02] what kind of church would we be what
[2:51:06] kind of people would it be this morning
[2:51:08] if this Branum tabernacle and see if
[2:51:10] this excellent tabernacle this one was
[2:51:12] so filled with the presence of God why
[2:51:14] when you didn't even use your mind
[2:51:16] didn't even use your own thoughts then
[2:51:18] even have no alternative of your own but
[2:51:21] just be led by the spirit hallelujah
[2:51:25] just a few more quotes it's a meal now
[2:51:27] from the Prophet from the word manifests
[2:51:32] a message in your trip report 1954
[2:51:35] andthere at our sons of God I led by the
[2:51:37] Spirit of God then when the human
[2:51:40] element goes out somebody say Amen the
[2:51:43] Spirit of God fills that vacancy you see
[2:51:46] there has to be a vacancy there has to
[2:51:49] be a vacancy if you are sitting there
[2:51:50] then court cannot there's no vacancy but
[2:51:54] when the human element goes out and the
[2:51:57] Spirit of God fill that vacancy where
[2:52:00] you empty yourself then will be when the
[2:52:03] church in its power of the resurrection
[2:52:06] of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps
[2:52:08] in his
[2:52:09] in his thoughts in his being in his
[2:52:11] moving you see what I mean then your
[2:52:14] thoughts will become words and your
[2:52:15] words will become material that's when
[2:52:18] the church in its power I believe it's
[2:52:21] on the road that's when the chillest
[2:52:22] will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy
[2:52:25] Spirit mankind saw away from themselves
[2:52:27] you don't see themselves you don't know
[2:52:30] tots but to still of God no thought but
[2:52:33] to serve God and they're torts move on
[2:52:35] they refuse the things of the world like
[2:52:39] Moses Moses refused to be called the son
[2:52:42] of Pharaoh's daughter see that's not my
[2:52:44] name don't call me that that's not who I
[2:52:48] am that's not my identification
[2:52:49] don't call me of this world I don't
[2:52:52] belong to this world I belong to God
[2:52:53] don't call me son of Pharaoh's nothing
[2:52:56] don't call me I'm not I'm not from this
[2:52:58] place I'm not from this world this is
[2:53:00] not my home I come from another place
[2:53:02] I'm waiting for the new earth because
[2:53:04] when it's a new dirt and fire cleanses
[2:53:06] and puts down the red carpet for the
[2:53:08] youth of the earth then I will show who
[2:53:10] I really am that is when it belongs to
[2:53:12] me they refuse a thing of the world they
[2:53:15] just move in the spirit live in the
[2:53:17] spirit move in the spirit walk in the
[2:53:19] spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then
[2:53:22] the love of Christ in the human heart
[2:53:24] the love of Christ not your
[2:53:27] interpretation of love because our
[2:53:29] interpretation of love you will love who

[2:59:17] this morning amen let me just skip down
[2:59:21] to the end I'm on page 18 of 62 clothes
[2:59:30] over this animal is a prayer from the
[2:59:32] Prophet
[2:59:35] in preaching this message brother
[2:59:38] branham and leadership in December of 65
[2:59:41] II he really brought her the rich young
[2:59:42] ruler and he said that the rich young
[2:59:44] ruler would have come up to him and say
[2:59:46] good master and we know the story and he
[2:59:49] told him the young man asks what can I
[2:59:51] do to inherit eternal life and jesus
[2:59:55] replied obey the commandments and only a
[2:59:56] father and mother and the young man said
[2:59:58] but I've done all these things from my
[2:59:59] youth what what like I get and the Bible
[3:00:03] said Jesus loved him prophecy been the
[3:00:06] love of God was so powerful he reached
[3:00:08] out to him and he's in what is
[3:00:10] situational the love cut to the bone
[3:00:13] could true the marrow down to the soul
[3:00:15] and saw that he had great wealth and he
[3:00:18] was so attached to his wealth that is
[3:00:20] what was holding him back so Jesus not
[3:00:23] that he wanted him to be poor but he
[3:00:25] wanted to break the hole that went on
[3:00:27] him said go sell all that you have and
[3:00:29] give to the poor take up your cross and
[3:00:31] follow me
[3:00:32] and the Bible said a man walked away
[3:00:34] grieved and when the banham said no
[3:00:37] doubt this young rich ruler would have
[3:00:38] had good tutors good guidance good
[3:00:40] leadership for him to be so successful
[3:00:42] but the madam said me I've just come out
[3:00:44] of high school maybe he would have been
[3:00:46] about 18 years old when abandon brought
[3:00:47] all of this out and he put his whole
[3:00:49] time to bring him to the end about how
[3:00:52] this rich and ruler actually ended and
[3:00:55] then says it's really about leadership
[3:01:02] you could begin a place for me softly
[3:01:05] this rich man from the message
[3:01:06] leadership when he come down or young
[3:01:09] ruler we talked about all religious and
[3:01:10] belong to church and everything fine
[3:01:12] educated a fine businessman and
[3:01:13] everything when he comes to the end of
[3:01:15] the road he began to scream there's
[3:01:17] nowhere to sleep
[3:01:18] where's his leadership he has been led
[3:01:21] by his church which is dead he had been
[3:01:23] led by the dead world and there was
[3:01:25] nothing for him to step into but what
[3:01:28] the world had prepared for it hell but
[3:01:31] here comes Moses a faithful servant who
[3:01:33] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[3:01:35] treasures than all the riches of Egypt
[3:01:38] he come to the end of the road and all
[3:01:40] manner 120 years will walked up on the
[3:01:43] mountain and he know what dead laid
[3:01:44] before him he looked over into the
[3:01:46] promised land and he looked Lena by his
[3:01:48] side there was his leader the rock he
[3:01:50] stepped up on the rock and he answered
[3:01:52] of God packed him away into the glory
[3:01:54] the glory of God into the bosoms of God
[3:01:56] why eight hundred years later he was
[3:01:59] still being led by his leader we finally
[3:02:02] move on Mount Transfiguration standing
[3:02:04] there with Elijah talking to Jesus he
[3:02:07] went to the cross eight hundred years
[3:02:08] after that the one that he esteemed the
[3:02:11] report of his ministry the great
[3:02:12] treasures and all the popularity of the
[3:02:15] world and all the money of the world his
[3:02:17] leader was still leading him oh my he
[3:02:19] was led his leader he led to the death
[3:02:22] the shadows of death he was led to the
[3:02:24] grave hundreds of years later there he
[3:02:26] stood again because as his youth he had
[3:02:28] chosen the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[3:02:31] his name will be great when there is no
[3:02:33] more Egypt or treasures when the
[3:02:35] pyramids are dust and when Egypt is no
[3:02:37] more Moses will be immortal among men
[3:02:40] because he accepted the leadership of
[3:02:42] Christ instead of going the way his
[3:02:45] church went there's others that did the
[3:02:48] same thing look at Allah he walked with
[3:02:51] God for five hundred years and then he
[3:02:54] had a test so many that he pleased God
[3:02:55] God had verified it this is the Prophet
[3:02:58] and said there's no need of you dying
[3:03:00] just come on up home this afternoon he
[3:03:03] went up and Elisha after boiling out
[3:03:06] baba here a woman and everything as he
[3:03:08] did in his day Jezebel's with the paint
[3:03:10] on them
[3:03:11] he got so full of it and I don't all he
[3:03:13] could and all them priests making fun of
[3:03:15] him and everything else he walked down
[3:03:18] the river one day and Jess across the
[3:03:20] river was the horses hitched up butch
[3:03:22] over there a chariot of fire and horses
[3:03:25] of fire he stepped right on and through
[3:03:28] his robe off to the next prophet to
[3:03:30] follow him and went up into heaven he
[3:03:32] accepted the leadership of eternal life
[3:03:35] because it was Christ that was in Elijah
[3:03:37] oh yes sir
[3:03:38] what was it follow me we said at the
[3:03:41] beginning if there's a leader you have
[3:03:43] to follow follow me now you must choose
[3:03:46] your leader you've got to choose it
[3:03:48] friends look in God's looking-glass the
[3:03:51] Bible and see where you are at tonight
[3:03:54] what do you look like what are you
[3:03:56] following what have we done you must
[3:03:59] choose your leader choose today you
[3:04:01] choose life or death
[3:04:02] your choice will determine your eternal
[3:04:04] destination what you choose remember
[3:04:07] jesus said follow me and you invited a
[3:04:09] do so to follow him to eternal life you
[3:04:12] must come on his terms
[3:04:14] I'm closing that's right the wood not
[3:04:16] upon the creed not upon the public
[3:04:18] opinion not upon what anybody else
[3:04:20] thinks about it but on what God said
[3:04:23] about it you say well brother Branham I
[3:04:27] know a woman just as good as she can be
[3:04:29] she does this and one man that went
[3:04:31] through this
[3:04:31] I can't help what they've done God's
[3:04:34] will he said that every man's would be a
[3:04:36] lie and mind me the truth you have got
[3:04:38] to come on his terms
[3:04:39] come on his conditions the world you
[3:04:42] cannot come through creed you cannot
[3:04:44] come through your domination you cannot
[3:04:45] mix it like that there's only one thing
[3:04:48] you can do accept it on his term that
[3:04:50] you're willing to die to yourself and
[3:04:53] all your thoughts and follow him get rid
[3:04:56] of all the things of the world and
[3:04:57] follow me
[3:04:58] may this be your closing message in 2018
[3:05:02] I know that's a stone cutting message
[3:05:04] brother but I didn't come here to choose
[3:05:06] a message to the people just to try to
[3:05:08] make them sing shout holler and I
[3:05:11] mentioned this earlier I've been in
[3:05:13] heathen meetings where they've done the
[3:05:15] same thing I'm interested in your life
[3:05:17] I'm a servant of God that's got to
[3:05:20] answer to God Sunday and the ministry
[3:05:24] that the Lord has given me has
[3:05:26] vindicated itself thousands of time
[3:05:28] before you this is the prophets weekend
[3:05:30] remember Jesus said follow me follow me
[3:05:33] get rid of what you got and follow me
[3:05:36] that's the only way to have eternal life
[3:05:39] that's the only remedy he gave this man
[3:05:42] was the only remedy he gave this
[3:05:44] businessman it's the only remedy he
[3:05:47] gives anybody his choice he makes his
[3:05:49] decision is perfect every time and we
[3:05:52] must follow him is the only way to have
[3:05:53] eternal life so the leadership of God is
[3:05:56] to follow the vindicated word every hour
[3:05:58] by the Holy Ghost let us stand to our
[3:06:00] feet and I want to read this prayer this
[3:06:03] how bad a Branham closed-off this
[3:06:05] message leadership on December the 7th
[3:06:09] 1965 the second and last message that he
[3:06:12] preached can we bow our heads for a word
[3:06:14] of Prayer dear God as we stand here
[3:06:17] tonight a dying people our faces are
[3:06:20] turned towards the eat and dust we just
[3:06:25] you have given us this cutting sermon
[3:06:27] Lord we see the example of two men one
[3:06:29] of them being a religious man went to
[3:06:31] church but rejected the leadership to
[3:06:34] eternal life and the other rejected the
[3:06:37] worldly fame and turned to eternal life
[3:06:39] and we see both of their conditions
[3:06:41] tonight according to the Bible the rich
[3:06:44] man is in torment and Moses is in glory
[3:06:46] father we want to be like Moses we want
[3:06:49] to be led by your holy Son Jesus Christ
