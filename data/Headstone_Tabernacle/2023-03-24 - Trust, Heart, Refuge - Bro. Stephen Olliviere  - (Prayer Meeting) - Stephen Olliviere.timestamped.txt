[14:57] moved
[14:58] how long will you imagine Mischief
[15:00] against a man
[15:02] he shall be slain all of you as a bowing
[15:04] wall shall he be and as a torturing
[15:07] fence
[15:08] the only consult to cast him down from

[15:16] inwardly Sila
[15:18] my soul wait thou only upon God for my

[15:27] he is my defense I shall not be moved
[15:31] and God is my salvation and my glory
[15:34] the rock of my strength and my refuge is
[15:38] in God
[15:39] this is trust in him at all times he
[15:42] people
[15:43] pour out your heart before him God is
[15:46] our refuge for us Sila amen and I want
[15:49] to focus on this here tonight I trust in
[15:52] him at all times he people pour out your
[15:55] heart before him God is a refuge for us
[15:59] father father blessed with tonight we
[16:01] pray in Jesus name amen and amen thank
[16:04] you Lord
[16:06] praise God so tonight
[16:08] I just want to talk about three words
[16:13] Trust
[16:15] heart and refuge
[16:20] and what is Trust
[16:23] trust is assured reliance
[16:26] on the character the ability and
[16:28] strength
[16:30] or truth of someone or something
[16:36] it is a place confidence in someone
[16:39] or something
[16:41] it is to Hope or expect confidently
[16:47] so when you trust someone
[16:50] you have an expectation of that person
[16:54] you know that he or she will not fail
[16:56] you in a particular regard
[17:00] you trust in something
[17:03] because you know it will work for you
[17:06] you can't prove it
[17:08] but you just know it will work for you
[17:13] you expect it to work with a high degree
[17:16] of confidence amen
[17:21] and I remember as a young Christian
[17:24] now this scene
[17:25] also to come in my mind or probably
[17:28] around age 12 13 around there
[17:31] and it's it's like this you take a baby
[17:33] or toddler
[17:35] and you put him to stand on top of a
[17:38] building
[17:40] and you show him his daddy or Mommy way
[17:42] down below
[17:45] and if Daddy says come jump down to me
[17:49] that little boy will be ready to jump
[17:52] into Daddy's arms
[17:55] someone he knows that he will get him
[17:58] daddy will surely catch him
[18:04] therefore he focuses more on Daddy
[18:07] and ignores the dangers that are
[18:10] connected to such a high jump
[18:14] he trusts his father
[18:17] he does not see the danger
[18:20] he sees Daddy
[18:22] and he trusts Daddy
[18:26] maybe he's too young to know the
[18:28] magnitude of the danger and maybe that's
[18:30] a good thing
[18:31] but he trusts
[18:34] his father somebody said trust tonight
[18:36] praise to God
[18:39] and we call that shy like faith
[18:43] trust in like a child
[18:49] [Music]
[18:53] so we tonight
[18:56] we must become like a beautiful child
[18:59] in the way we trust God
[19:03] we must trust God Without Limits
[19:07] trust God regardless
[19:10] trust God in spite of Amen so can
[19:13] somebody say Amen to that praise God
[19:15] praise God Amen thank you Lord
[19:19] an older child may say Daddy it's too
[19:23] high
[19:25] I'm afraid to do it
[19:28] it's too dangerous I might fall and
[19:30] enjoy myself I might even die see
[19:34] so the older child and the older we get
[19:38] we use reasoning
[19:41] he will use his senses to protect
[19:43] himself
[19:45] he begins to make sense or assess the
[19:48] risks involved
[19:50] so he trust his dad partially
[19:54] somewhat
[19:56] but not fully
[19:58] because he's afraid
[20:00] amen
[20:03] so Fear Can Trust
[20:09] fear can reduce faith
[20:14] so don't allow fear to hinder your trust
[20:18] in God
[20:20] don't allow fear
[20:22] to hinder your faith in God can we say
[20:26] Amen to that thank you Jesus
[20:29] hallelujah praise God
[20:32] I want to trust you Lord but I'm afraid
[20:36] this situation is too bad
[20:40] I want to trust you
[20:42] but this might happen
[20:46] I want to trust you but only if this
[20:49] happens
[20:51] see
[20:53] though you must trust God regardless
[20:55] amen praise God so notice
[21:01] he's kept on the boat
[21:04] he was trusting in God
[21:07] but then the conditions and the storms
[21:10] of life and his reasoning and his fear
[21:13] begin to choke his faith
[21:17] he began to sink
[21:20] but tonight keep your eyes on Jesus can
[21:24] we say Amen keep your eyes on Jesus
[21:26] trust him to see you through amen trust
[21:30] him to see you through tonight
[21:31] Hallelujah say Lord I Trust You Lord I
[21:36] trust you no matter what I trust you
[21:38] tonight Hallelujah I trust you with my
[21:41] life
[21:42] I trust you with my health
[21:45] I trust you at my family
[21:48] I trust you with my finances
[21:51] Hallelujah I trust you to finish that
[21:55] work that you started in my life you you
[21:58] started at work with me and you go to
[22:00] finish it Lord you are the author and
[22:03] finish up my feet praise God and I trust
[22:06] you tonight
[22:07] don't give up on God because he won't
[22:10] give up on you trust him tonight can
[22:13] somebody trust him tonight amen praise
[22:15] God
[22:16] Glory
[22:19] trust them
[22:20] praise God praise God
[22:23] so so David says trust in the Lord at
[22:26] all times
[22:28] not sometimes
[22:30] not just in the good times
[22:33] but all times
[22:36] and then Prophet says when you are sick
[22:38] trust him
[22:41] when you are down in a valley
[22:43] trusted
[22:48] when you are so low and the rocks are on
[22:50] top of your head
[22:52] still trusting
[22:53] when you're in the belly of a wheel and
[22:56] there's wheel all around you my like
[22:58] Jonah
[23:00] still trust him amen glory to God
[23:03] maybe you lost your job can you still
[23:06] trust him
[23:08] maybe you lost a loved one or a family
[23:11] member
[23:12] still trust him hallelujah praise God
[23:15] Amen maybe nobody seems to care about
[23:18] you
[23:19] trust him still God cares for you he
[23:23] cares for you tonight amen can we say
[23:25] amen he cares for you praise God praise
[23:28] God Amen thank you Jesus
[23:31] Glory
[23:32] so tonight trust the Lord with all your
[23:34] heart amen
[23:36] and some time ago I was looking up at
[23:38] the
[23:39] on YouTube at the turkey earthquake the
[23:41] earthquake activity and the aftermath
[23:45] and the magnitude of the destruction
[23:49] but what held my attention was the
[23:52] rescue workers
[23:54] and how they tried so hard to save this
[23:56] up any survivors buried under the rubble
[24:01] and I saw one particular piece
[24:04] where they found a baby a very young
[24:07] baby
[24:08] alive after four days or so
[24:12] and I saw the The Rescuer he held the
[24:16] baby when he picked him up and he sat
[24:18] down when he just burst into tears when
[24:20] he saved the baby
[24:22] it was like a big miracle you know
[24:25] and you know I'm considering people
[24:28] trapped on the ground and so on and can
[24:31] you imagine being trapped under there
[24:33] and you are alive
[24:36] but you can't even move your finger
[24:39] you're just alive Frozen there hoping
[24:42] that somebody will find you because you
[24:45] can't help yourself then
[24:47] hoping that somebody will find you and
[24:49] Rescue
[24:50] as brother Peter talked about on
[24:51] Wednesday they without us on Wednesday
[24:53] night amen
[24:56] so somebody is depending on us
[25:01] somebody's depending on us amen
[25:04] you know so but many times conditions
[25:07] around us are so rough
[25:10] and they may seem like there's no way
[25:12] off
[25:13] nowhere else
[25:14] it's totally impossible
[25:18] but tonight I don't care if one million
[25:21] persons around you die
[25:23] you are one in a million today
[25:26] Hallelujah
[25:28] you will not die but you will live to
[25:31] declare the works of the Lord can
[25:32] somebody say Amen tonight
[25:34] hallelujah hallelujah
[25:37] somehow
[25:38] somehow
[25:39] you can trust in the Lord
[25:43] somehow you can look to him
[25:46] and believe that he's going to bring you
[25:50] through
[25:51] you don't know how
[25:53] but God tonight you can say do it for me
[25:57] do it for me praise God I know Lord you
[26:00] will bring me out oh God

[26:06] hundred praise today

[26:11] praise God Amen
[26:13] you don't know how it's going to work
[26:15] out but somehow
[26:18] trust God and he will work it out praise
[26:22] God David said in Psalms trust in the
[26:25] Lord at all times ye people
[26:28] all times amen
[26:30] praise God
[26:32] if you look at the three Hebrew boys
[26:35] they say oh great king
[26:38] I don't mean to be disrespectful
[26:41] it is not what I mean to be rude
[26:44] or just to be in different old great
[26:46] king
[26:48] but you see we only bow to the one true
[26:51] and living God

[33:18] we walk around us if we are pretty good
[33:21] we are the best and nicest people or
[33:24] maybe we are
[33:26] but in Revival
[33:28] you will begin to see how much stuff
[33:30] coming out of that Wicked heart
[33:34] in Revival
[33:36] you will see how much stuff will come
[33:38] out of that Wicked heart make your
[33:41] calling an election show
[33:43] yeah
[33:44] so yes we are nice people
[33:47] you're right but there are still things
[33:50] that are hard that need to stuff that
[33:52] needs to come out hiding somewhere in a
[33:54] corner
[33:55] oh God help us help us we need Revival
[34:00] because listen
[34:02] that's tough in there that's hiding
[34:04] won't make it on the other side
[34:08] the only thing that's going to make it
[34:11] on the other side in that heart is
[34:13] perfect love
[34:16] to all this other
[34:19] s you gotta get rid of it and that's
[34:20] what Revival is for Amen to put all that
[34:24] out and put the perfect love of God in
[34:26] there that will and then
[34:30] we will make it on the other side so

[34:55] be in the heart so we are not good until

[35:36] their Lord hallelujah
[35:39] wait in faith
[35:41] weighted love
[35:44] don't wait in vexation and
[35:45] disappointment

[35:54] wait patiently one piece broadensive
[35:57] patience is a holy ghost virtue
[36:00] amen I'll read it later wait patiently
[36:05] so my soul waited upon God and while I
[36:09] wait
