[1:21] he want to make it bloodless without the
[1:23] blood of Jesus he want to make it
[1:24] without the atmosphere and we are
[1:26] fighting for that we are fighting them
[1:28] demons we are fighting those
[1:36] Devils
[1:38] [Applause]
[1:39] [Music]
[1:42] [Applause]
[1:47] Hallelujah brother Braham he knew that
[1:51] his present backing condition would
[1:54] never meet the challenge of the
[1:56] hour yet he was just as much man as he
[1:59] was his muscles his frame was as big as
[2:03] it ever was he was just a big muscle
[2:07] that ever could raise up his arm at any
[2:09] time probably larger we got better
[2:12] churches better buildings where is our
[2:15] strength spiritually speaking he said
[2:18] I'm talking about the presence of God
[2:19] being recognized Among Us that is what
[2:23] we ought to live
[2:24] for not my group get bigger than your
[2:27] group and who are the biggest group the
[2:28] biggest group is it
[2:30] the deest
[2:35] group is not Si's group is if we could
[2:40] hold
[2:42] presence sometime
[2:46] ago Hallelujah God are cursing you you
[2:49] cursing
[2:50] Yourself by how you act God responding
[2:52] to
[2:56] it did you get that
[3:02] if you repent quickly God could minister
[3:03] to that because repentance is not the
[3:06] law of man repentance is the law of God
[3:10] I don't want anyone to perish but that
[3:12] all will come to repentance that is what
[3:15] God recognizes that you are sorry for
[3:16] your sin that you are sorry for your
[3:18] attitude you are sorry for your way and
[3:20] you want to get the way out you want him
[3:22] to make a way for you you glory to God
[3:24] you want God to stay the pestilence stay
[3:27] whatever is affecting and affecting home
[3:38] family he knew that his backd condition
[3:41] could not be the challenge of that
[3:45] hour all the time while they were all
[3:48] standing there and these thoughts was
[3:50] going through their mind I hope it sends
[3:52] through
[3:53] yours they never notice Samson his
[3:57] thoughts went through his mind
[4:00] this is somethings thinking brother
[4:01] saying there is a
[4:03] possibility that God will hear
[4:08] me this is a man who defeated
[4:10] Philistines this is a man that everybody
[4:12] was afraid of this is a man that people
[4:15] around respected no more respects now
[4:18] he's a mockery They're laughing at that
[4:21] man and Samson saw a
[4:24] possibility that God will hear me there
[4:27] is a possibility and while he thought
[4:30] the Philistine had not noticed him while
[4:33] this little boy had untied his hands and
[4:35] walked back he said lay my hands against
[4:37] the post CU Samson couldn't see so you
[4:40] had to trust the little boy will listen
[4:42] to
[4:43] him there's a possibility I wish the
[4:46] church could see that listen there's a
[4:49] possibility of a real
[4:52] Revival could I hear a bigger shout than
[4:55] that the prophet said I wish the church
[4:57] could see that there is a possibility of
[5:00] a real Revival let me say it good in
[5:07] Trinidad there is a possibility we got
[5:09] to re right
[5:11] here do you see that
[5:14] possibility then make
[5:17] way make yourself ready Revival is on
[5:20] its way are you willing to pay the
[5:23] price for Revival

[15:45] [Music]
[15:56] morning glory
[16:00] glory glory to
[16:03] [Applause]
[16:11] godall the reason we got so much
[16:13] different interational churches they
[16:15] know it's scripture we try to bypass it
[16:18] many of the Great Holiness churches is
[16:19] falling into the same rot trying to
[16:21] bypass it go up and Shake hand with the
[16:22] minister and say I believe Jes Christ to
[16:24] be the Son of God the devil does the
[16:25] same thing the reason to do that is to
[16:27] try to bypass the new
[16:30] birth how the purpose of that so they
[16:33] like certain pastors and so because the
[16:35] pastors don't hit them a certain way one
[16:37] time was preaching and say he blast
[16:40] everything he could have blast I said so
[16:42] wait from him outside he say brother you
[16:45] had touch me
[16:46] tonight the only thing he didn't talk
[16:48] about was gossiping and she was the
[16:50] Numero Uno gossiper of the church that's
[16:54] the only thing in touch and she's so
[16:56] proud she say you touch me
[17:02] that a bold

[17:32] you so you choose how you want to play
[17:35] it or give the Lord some
[17:37] Praises

[17:43] try to bypass the new birth any kind of
[17:46] bir is a mess if it's a birt is in a
[17:48] Bard a cal is a mess because you grow up

[22:50] thing but education will never
[22:52] substitute salvation or the New Birth it
[22:55] cannot do it God has a program we must
[22:58] measure up to that program we try to
[23:01] teach our ministers knowledge we ought
[23:03] to teach them the baptism of the Holy
[23:09] Spirit we ought to teach them Christ but
[23:12] we're trying to get a better class of
[23:14] people among us there's no better class
[23:16] of people than Born Again
[23:19] [Music]
[23:23] Christians that's why you can't watch a
[23:25] church member and said that represent
[23:27] the church
[23:28] suppose that way that person is a church
[23:30] member suppos they not born again and
[23:33] then you want to follow that person and
[23:35] I said well she just do that and he just
[23:36] do that and he who you following Paul
[23:39] say follow me as I follow
[23:43] Christ amen let's
[23:47] continue they are not willing to pay the
[23:49] price Samson prayed right what did he
[23:52] pray Lord let me die with the Enemy
[23:55] that's the trouble they don't want to
[23:58] pay pay the price of
[24:02] dying if you want to succeed in your
[24:04] exam you have to
[24:05] study all your friends ly in they
[24:08] laughing they carrying on and whatnot
[24:10] and they call you a bookor they call you
[24:11] a nerd they call you whatever they want
[24:13] but you making a sacrifice because you
[24:15] know school is not permanent after got
[24:17] the subject you people go ask about the
[24:19] subject you have your subjects and you
[24:20] go forward whether further exams or get
[24:22] a
[24:24] job but when you make your sacrifice and
[24:26] you study and you pass your ex s who
[24:29] could be against you for that you made a
[24:33] sacrifice you made a sacrifice a Le a
[24:35] skill well you learn to sew whe you
[24:37] learn to do cake or whatever it is food
[24:38] or whatever it is you learn but it costs
[24:41] something it cost you your time and
[24:45] there something else like I like to see
[24:46] people in
[24:47] Mastery a master tailor a Master
[24:50] Mechanic a master counselor Master when
[24:54] people in the Mastery they are in their
[24:56] element it's like what they were raised
[24:58] up for a master teacher there's some
[25:01] people teach just for the money they put
[25:03] in the board they don't care if the
[25:04] students learn learn anything you
[25:05] know one time I was in school move and a
[25:09] boy don't like teacher I said boy teach
[25:11] getting pay every month you
[25:12] know I said even if they don't like you
[25:15] learn from them then I think he kind of
[25:18] listen a bit but he
[25:21] upset when I was a student I didn't like
[25:23] the teacher at
[25:25] all wasn't Spanish she's Terri ter and
[25:29] that affect me from learning Spanish but
[25:31] you see nobody tell me get out of that
[25:34] attitude because if I was getting the
[25:36] right counseling I would have adjusted
[25:38] and I could learn Spanish I regretted
[25:40] that and there's a man now who came and
[25:43] taught lit and man he he make me get to
[25:46] love literature until I see literature
[25:48] should be
[25:49] compulsory but that is how life is one
[25:52] time I remember Isaac and him come home
[25:54] and talk about this man they going to
[25:55] lessons brother Steven and say this man
[25:57] he go so excited because them children
[25:59] get with mathematics and you know the
[26:00] man do he draw a
[26:02] TV on the board and do the match inside
[26:04] the
[26:05] TV and everybody
[26:08] excited just take a different approach
[26:10] he draw a TV with Nubs and like that and
[26:12] do the M TV and wo boy if you see
[26:16] that they're watching
[26:19] TV and he teaching
[26:22] M and all these things tell you the
[26:25] heart of a teacher is to get the
[26:27] teaching to the in other words when the
[26:29] children are successful the teachers
[26:31] feel great about
[26:33] it the teacher the teacher like I was
[26:36] doing Advanced Cam and the teacher used
[26:38] to be writing on the board like that and
[26:39] so you write first line you rub it off
[26:41] he writing like that rub it off and
[26:44] iidea totally
[26:47] lost but he I am not a university grad
[26:50] maybe they could write so fast and he
[26:53] and he rubbing it off and said afterward
[26:55] I Dr the
[26:56] glass I couldn't keep up
[26:58] the point about it is this God want to
[27:01] get his word to his people that's why he
[27:03] sent prophets Messengers ministers
[27:07] exalters singers because he want to get
[27:10] it to his people the object is not he
[27:12] just want to talk he wanted to respond
[27:15] he want you to apply he want you to act
[27:18] he want you to obey he want you to fall
[27:20] in line that's the burden of God my
[27:23] people my people my people if my people
[27:26] is called by my name shall humble
[27:28] themselves my people my people he's not
[27:30] talking about anybody
[27:34] else oh give the Lord some
[27:36] Praises Glory God is working for us God
[27:40] sent for you behold I sent you Elijah
[27:44] God get this message to look how God
[27:46] find you to give you this message now
[27:49] what are we going to do with it what did
[27:51] your God tell John take it and eat it
[27:54] and prophesy oh give the Lord a shout in
[27:56] the house not watch it eat it digest it
[28:00] let it have an effect upon you come on
[28:01] preach back to me
[28:02] [Applause]
[28:08] somebody you got to surrender
[28:13] yourself you got a price to
[28:16] pay
[28:17] continue you got a cleaning up to
[28:21] do and I tell you the whole church world
[28:24] needs a cleaning all the way from the
[28:26] pulpit to the jesis room
[28:29] they're not willing to
[28:32] pay you must be ready to die to the
[28:36] enemy that God his victory over you you
[28:39] must be willing to surrender your own
[28:41] ideas Samson but the was willing to pay
[28:44] the price to get the power of God
[28:48] again you see if people if if people
[28:52] feel they got it and they don't know
[28:54] they got it to get they will stay with
[28:56] what they have and they're not asking
[28:59] God for what
[29:00] promised they say they got it with no
[29:02] power no signs SK heer to take nothing
[29:05] but they got it whatever that it is but
[29:08] we see we got it to get because when
[29:12] they were in the upper room and the
[29:13] power hit them and start to speak in
[29:14] Tong and Stag and the demons went and
[29:17] tell Satan but dramatized it look
[29:19] they're having a good time up there
[29:20] Satan said don't worry about them they
[29:21] just getting excited in an
[29:23] atmosphere but when Peter saw the
[29:26] man and say Sil go Have I None
[29:28] such as I have I give rise up and walk
[29:31] in name of Jesus Christ he said the
[29:32] devil got up and say you see that that's
[29:34] a different thing that's a serious thing
[29:36] that saying they Clos down we have books
[29:38] and tapes believe around much Cults and
[29:40] Fanatics have all over the world I I
[29:43] could go 14 Jesus is people who say that
[29:46] the Messiah that Messiah here they just
[29:48] arrest
[29:49] one somewhere in the east in eastern
[29:51] thing there is a messiah all he sign for
[29:53] blocking for police and like that the
[29:55] man is a crook the man is all kind of
[29:57] thing they hold Jesus they hold they
[29:59] hold the Messiah that because they
[30:01] claiming to be Son of God they claiming
[30:02] all kind of thing so what I'm saying
[30:04] then nothing would happen until this
[30:07] word begin to be fulfilled among the
[30:10] bride he said by and true the bride will
[30:12] be fulfilled all oh give the Lord a
[30:15] shout not sitting down in church not
[30:18] coming for service but by and through
[30:20] the bride something has to happen right
[30:22] now God is raising the temperature on
[30:25] floods on earthquakes on Wars he's
[30:28] raising the temperature he's got to
[30:29] raise the temperature in the
[30:31] church something have to
[30:33] break you can't come here with the same
[30:36] mindset that's why we hit in mindset hit
[30:38] in Attitude oh give the Lord some
[30:46] Praises but
[30:48] Braham Samson he knew it was going to
[30:51] cost him
[30:53] something it's going to cost you
[30:56] something that why they love the pastor
[30:58] think too bad you know that my
[31:01] pastor what they really want is a
[31:04] priest that what they really want by
[31:06] George they want us to be priests
[31:08] Catholic priests just do a little things
[31:11] so and you're good to
[31:13] go so you can't blame yourself you blame
[31:17] the priest you got tell God I trust him
[31:20] that's why I say to or and Tre Mary I
[31:23] trust
[31:23] him because the priest say so but God
[31:27] cut that prood off
[31:28] and say look the word is here what you
[31:31] talking about you can't read well you
[31:33] could listen if you can't read you could

[32:40] Del lead me in
[32:43] unrighteousness I will choose where I go
[32:46] because the friends say let we go let us

[32:56] a determination I have to to make my
[32:58] actions I have to choose my actions Oh

[37:19] peace with God through our Lord Jesus
[37:21] Christ do you have peace are you tossed
[37:24] tormented and turned
[37:25] around in a city nearby me few years
[37:31] ago a old man lived down by the river
[37:34] they thought he was a bum he passed out
[37:37] religious tracks he lost his family life
[37:39] seemed very cruel to him he lost his
[37:42] little family and he was crossing the
[37:45] street and a teenager come and hit the
[37:48] old man knock him across the street
[37:50] broke his bones all up umblance pick him
[37:52] up they took him to the city hospital
[37:54] they examined the old fellow his arms
[37:56] was broke his rib was broke his leg was
[37:58] broke he was laying there with his mouth
[38:00] open seemingly all gone unconscious
[38:02] after the doctors had put him on the
[38:04] xtray and they said is it worth our time
[38:07] to patch up the old fellow up he's
[38:09] nothing but a
[38:10] bum doctors talking that talk it will
[38:14] take us hours it will take us all this
[38:16] when others are waiting and the old
[38:18] fellow old he was a bum he heard there
[38:22] be no money in it for us is not
[38:24] worthwhile he broke up too much to even
[38:26] take a chance with it
[38:28] they were holding the
[38:30] council the old man happened not to be
[38:32] dead as they thought he was and when
[38:35] they walk back and started to put the
[38:36] sheet over him and take him back again
[38:38] he said just a
[38:41] minute old man is talking I heard what
[38:45] you
[38:46] said he said I am not worth something I
[38:49] am worth something too I am worth as
[38:52] much that God sent his own son to die
[38:54] for
[38:54] me I am worth so much that God gave His
[38:57] only begotten son to die for
[39:00] me 50 years or more I accepted that
[39:03] blessed thing I entered into fellowship
[39:05] with him that's just as sweet as no as
[39:07] it is I am worth something I am worth
[39:11] enough that God give his son for me oh
[39:15] give the Lord some
[39:18] Praises oh if people could only realize
[39:22] what human life is
[39:24] worth and I want to read this what let's
[39:27] look what a cross and what a Coss it was
[39:31] in closing let me say this but let's
[39:34] take ourselves to Jerusalem 00 years ago
[39:37] and compared with the Garden of Eden I
[39:39] sat along this morning about 7:00 I hear
[39:41] the howling mob I go to the
[39:44] window I rais a sash and throw the
[39:46] shutters back what's the matter I see a
[39:48] figure dipped there pulling across of
[39:51] the street and they whipping him and the
[39:54] mockery spit of the soldiers is hanging
[39:56] on his face from drunk all night long
[39:59] stinking I see a crown of thorns pulled
[40:01] down across his brow Blood and Tears
[40:03] mixed I see a robe across his body
[40:05] without seam in it a great red dots all
[40:09] over the coat and Roman soldiers
[40:11] whipping him as he goes up the hill he
[40:13] drags along what a sight old cross
[40:16] rubbing the hide off his shoulders he
[40:18] goes up the streets and they're making
[40:20] fun hollering hail King of the Jews I
[40:23] notice those little red spots they begin
[40:25] to get bigger and bigger and bigger and
[40:26] after a while they run into one great
[40:28] big bloody garment as he goes to beating
[40:31] his legs as he moves up the hill he's
[40:33] going close now to the top of the hill I
[40:35] could see a bee a well-known bee among
[40:38] the human race that begins stinging in
[40:40] the Garden of Eden it's called The Bee
[40:41] of dead and here he come he buzzes
[40:44] around him three or four times his de
[40:46] with his big stinger out you know what I
[40:49] thought when I tempted him up there he
[40:50] overcome the Temptation he's nothing but
[40:52] a man couldn't be God that ain't God
[40:55] that come down the Garden of Eden he
[40:57] said say something so you know the devil
[40:59] never did believe he was divine he
[41:01] always thought he was a
[41:03] man he said but oh Lamb of God there he
[41:05] goes the devil sent his sting out there
[41:07] and he comes around buzzing I'll anchor
[41:09] My Sting in him and knock him away and
[41:12] finish him now tell us if you're a
[41:14] prophet and so on he said watch that
[41:16] devil tonight if this is Divine Healing
[41:18] and so on here come that be de the last
[41:20] great enemy of man humming around him I
[41:22] suck my Stinger in him and end it but
[41:24] brother when he suck his stinger in that
[41:26] flesh that was more than a man if a bee
[41:30] ever suck a stinger if any insect sticks
[41:32] his deep enough when he pulls away he
[41:34] hasn't got any more Stinger it take the
[41:37] stinger out and when that bee of death
[41:39] stocked into the Stinger into the Flesh
[41:41] of God at Calvary it pulled the stinger
[41:43] out of him no wonder Paul could stand
[41:46] and say oh de where is your sting when
[41:48] he was fixing to have his head cut off
[41:49] he said debt where is your stinger grave
[41:52] where is your Victory but thanks be to
[41:54] God who give us the victory to our Lord
[41:56] Jesus Christ Hallelujah he said I come
[41:59] to you not with words enchanting words
[42:01] of the wisdom of men but I come to you
[42:03] in the power and the demonstration of
[42:05] the Holy Spirit he can Buzz around a
[42:07] Christian he can make all kind of fun
[42:08] and say I got you now you got cancer you
[42:11] got tumor you got this you got that I
[42:13] got you now but let me tell you brother
[42:15] he hasn't got any Stinger he's got a
[42:18] buzz but he hasn't got any Stinger oh de
[42:20] wear is your sting oh grave there's a
[42:23] victory oh give the Lord some Praises I
[42:26] say this one thing and closing there's a
[42:28] great big black door set before every
[42:30] one of us it's called debt and every
[42:32] time our heart beats We Are One Beat
