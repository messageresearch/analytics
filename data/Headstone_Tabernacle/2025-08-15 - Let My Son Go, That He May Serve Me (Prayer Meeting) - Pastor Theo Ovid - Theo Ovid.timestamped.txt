[0:00] Amen.
[0:02] &gt;&gt; We want to start in a word of prayer
[0:04] tonight as we do and ask God's blessing

[13:52] to me. Oh, God.
[13:56] You're so good.
[13:59] He's so good. Oh, to me.
[14:05] God answers prayer and God
[14:09] answers prayer.
[14:13] Yes, God
[14:15] answers
[14:17] prayer.
[14:20] God
[14:21] answers prayer.
[14:25] He's so good
[14:28] to me.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, brother Anthony.
[14:32] God bless you. Let's just worship the
[14:34] Lord a minute. Father, we praise you. We
[14:36] bless your name. We thank you. You
[14:38] answer prayer. You are God tonight. God
[14:41] over sickness, God over disease, God
[14:43] over every condition, every situation.
[14:46] We thank you in advance for what you are
[14:48] about to do. We thank you in advance for
[14:51] what you're going to bless this prayer
[14:53] meeting. Have your own way. I pray in
[14:55] the name of Jesus. Father God, I pray
[14:57] come in a special way and minister to
[14:59] each heart. In Jesus name I ask it.
[15:02] Amen. And amen. God bless you and thank
[15:05] you for being here tonight. And if you
[15:08] have your Bibles, I'd like you to go to
[15:10] a scripture here tonight.
[15:12] I want to go to two portion of
[15:14] scripture. Uh, Exodus chapter 4, we want
[15:18] to read verse 20- 23 and Hosea 11 1
[15:22] verse verse 1.
[15:25] Exodus chapter 4
[15:27] on verse 20.
[15:30] And Moses took his wife and his sons,
[15:33] and set him upon an ass, and he returned
[15:35] to the land of Egypt.
[15:37] And Moses took the rod of God in his
[15:40] hand.
[15:41] And the Lord said unto Moses,
[15:44] "When thou goest to return into Egypt,
[15:48] see that thou do all those wonders
[15:51] before Pharaoh, which I have put in
[15:54] thine hand, and I but I will harden his
[15:57] heart, that he shall not let the people
[16:01] go, and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh,
[16:05] Thus sayeth the Lord, Israel is my son,
[16:10] even my firstborn.
[16:13] And I say unto thee, let my son go, that
[16:18] he may serve me. And if thou refuse to
[16:21] let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,
[16:27] even thy firstborn.
[16:29] Hosea 11:1
[16:33] reads, "When Israel was a child,
[16:37] then I loved him
[16:40] and I called my son out of Egypt." May
[16:43] God bless his word. Tonight, I want to
[16:46] share something with you. Let my son go
[16:50] that he may serve me. And I trust that
[16:53] this would be a word not just only of
[16:56] encouragement but of faith in your own
[16:58] heart how God sees things. Here it is.
[17:03] There's a people under bondage for 400
[17:05] years. And it was a kind of a a blow
[17:08] mind to me to see these scriptures. How
[17:11] God saw Israel as his son.
[17:15] Note how God saw Israel as a son. Note
[17:21] God is interested in family.
[17:25] Note the whole concept of adoption
[17:28] is connected to family. Elohim
[17:32] self-existing alone
[17:35] becoming Jehovah God, God with his
[17:39] family.
[17:40] Genesis was about
[17:44] God's family, not church, but
[17:46] individuals. Who is Adam?
[17:50] than Eve.
[17:51] People today are churched, churchified,
[17:54] if we're going to use that word, in the
[17:56] last days. Yet to us Gentiles,
[18:00] he's calling you and I as individuals.
[18:03] So I want to zero in tonight on this
[18:07] individual, this son.
[18:09] But Abraham says, he says, "My hope is
[18:12] built on nothing less than Jesus, blood,
[18:14] and righteousness. All other grounds,
[18:16] every church, every denomination is
[18:18] sinking sand. Whether it's mother or
[18:21] father, loved ones, whether it's friend,
[18:24] whatever it is, all other ground is
[18:26] sinking sand. On Christ alone I stand.
[18:30] It's an individual affair,
[18:32] not of groups of people, but it is to
[18:36] you as an individual that you yourself
[18:40] as a soul human being might notice,
[18:45] might forsake your own thoughts. As long
[18:47] as you have your own thoughts, your own
[18:50] ways, your own ways are contrary to
[18:52] God's ways. You cannot be right and
[18:54] think your own thoughts, for you have
[18:56] got to die through your own thoughts. Do
[18:59] you know that your thoughts as long as
[19:01] you look at it, you look at it
[19:03] materially, you say, "Well, that can't
[19:05] happen. It's not reasonable. It's not
[19:08] sensible even to think such a thing." As
[19:11] long as you do that, then you will stay
[19:14] in the same condition. You have got to
[19:17] get to a place where you cannot think
[19:19] your ways, but come into Christ and
[19:21] think his ways. Take his words. Then
[19:25] things begin to shape different. Now,
[19:28] it's one thing to see Israel as a
[19:30] people, Israel as a nation. And it's
[19:33] another thing to see God's viewpoint,
[19:35] note God's viewpoint, tell Pharaoh,
[19:41] let go my son. And I feel this is a word
[19:45] that we have to be interested in. The
[19:48] purpose of releasing from bondage is
[19:51] that he might serve me. Not just to free
[19:54] him, but free to serve. So what that
[19:57] tells us is that we cannot really serve
[19:59] God correctly
[20:01] or properly if we're in bondage.
[20:06] Bondage is a stream. Bondage is what is
[20:10] controlling you, what is affecting you,
[20:12] what is afflicting you. And you have to
[20:15] long for freedom from bondage. There
[20:19] must be no bondage with the people of
[20:21] God. And you'll see from what I'm going
[20:23] to share what Jes how Jesus saw his own
[20:25] commission. Brother Abraham says this.
[20:29] No matter what the Brandham tabernacle
[20:31] ever turns out to be.
[20:33] Listen.
[20:35] No matter
[20:37] what the Brandham tabernacle ever turns
[20:40] out to be, don't let it be you. So in
[20:45] other words, he is saying don't let the
[20:46] brand tabacle be the standard. Don't let
[20:49] the Brandham tackle whether it fall
[20:51] whether it stand. That is not what
[20:52] you're supposed to look at. It is not up
[20:55] to the Brandham tabernacle.
[20:58] Neither is it up to any other churches.
[21:01] It is up to you as an individual to be
[21:06] ready at the coming of the Lord. You
[21:08] must be ready. I must be ready. I sweep
[21:13] my own steps. It's up to you to sweep
[21:17] your steps. Leave mine alone. Me, leave
[21:21] yours alone. You've got to make your
[21:24] garment ready. So, I want to challenge
[21:27] you tonight. Stop making excuses.
[21:32] Confront yourself.
[21:34] Stop blaming others. Stop blaming your
[21:38] past. Stop blaming your condition and
[21:40] your situation and begin to own up. He
[21:43] said the Pentecostal church needs a
[21:45] cleansing all the way from the front to
[21:47] the back through the cellar basement
[21:49] upstairs. The Pentecostal church needs a
[21:51] revolutionary, a revolt against the
[21:54] things that is wrong and accept the
[21:56] things that are right. A fresh baptism
[21:59] of the Holy Ghost, a church to make
[22:01] herself ready.
[22:03] God calls you as an individual.
[22:08] Watch. He says it's you that's got to
[22:12] clean up because he is taking a people
[22:14] from the Gentiles for his name's sake
[22:17] his bride gentile Esther clean herself
[22:20] she clean her heart and that's what she
[22:23] clean that is what the church needs a
[22:26] heart cleaning how do you clean your
[22:28] heart brother Brandham wash by the water
[22:32] of the word through the blood of Jesus
[22:35] so again God don't deal with a person in
[22:39] a group.
[22:41] God don't deal with you in an
[22:43] organization. People love their church.
[22:46] People love their group. But the reality
[22:48] is this. He deals with you as an
[22:51] individual.
[22:52] An individual.
[22:54] Individually, we are baptized with the
[22:56] Holy Ghost. Collectively, we are
[22:59] baptized into the body. When we are
[23:01] baptized with the Holy Ghost
[23:03] individually,
[23:05] each one with the Holy Ghost, God is
[23:08] dealing with each one. That's his
[23:10] purpose. And here's Bob scatter them
[23:14] across the earth so he could deal
[23:18] individually with each of them. That's
[23:21] the purpose. God scatter people across
[23:25] the earth so he could deal with
[23:29] individuals. So there ought not to be
[23:31] any person between you and God. Let me
[23:35] say it again tonight. Nobody. No pastor,
[23:38] no elder, no deacon. It's supposed to be
[23:41] you and God. In this age of adoption or
[23:44] age of maturity, it's age of which sons
[23:48] have to come forth. And the scripture in
[23:51] Hosea said it's so beautiful. When
[23:53] Israel was a child, I loved him. And I
[23:56] call my son out of Egypt.
[24:00] God cannot leave us in Egypt. A call
[24:05] have to go out to get us out. Egypt is
[24:08] the world. Egypt of our flesh. Egypt is
[24:11] canality. Whatever of negativity of this
[24:14] earth, of this dust is like Egypt. And
[24:17] the call is to call and to come out
[24:20] clean out of Egypt. I call my son out of
[24:23] Egypt. What's the purpose he want that
[24:26] son come out for? That he might serve
[24:29] me. Not that he may be a better lived
[24:31] Egyptian or executive Egyptian or a more
[24:35] prosperous Egyptian. No. Come out called
[24:39] out that he might serve me. Okay, let's
[24:43] continue.
[24:44] He says, watch this.
[24:49] There's a time bullheaded amongst women.
[24:52] You wonder why I'm hollering about this.
[24:54] Now I'm going to lay a lot of
[24:56] scriptures. He said, "Now I'll show you
[24:58] why." And that's the reason. Here we go.
[25:01] I've got to stay true to this word. And
[25:04] every servant of God ought to stay true
[25:06] to the word. You must stay
[25:10] because there's got to be a voice
[25:13] somewhere
[25:16] but crying out against it. This part I
[25:19] want to get to. I don't care what the
[25:22] rest of them does.
[25:25] You are not responsible for them.
[25:28] You answer as an individual.
[25:32] You don't answer as a Methodist. We will
[25:35] say to this uh I belong to this
[25:37] tabernacle. You don't answer as a
[25:40] Methodist. You don't answer as a
[25:42] Baptist. I belong to this other
[25:44] tabernacle or a Pentecostal. You answer
[25:48] as an individual to God for your own
[25:51] life.
[25:53] Praise God. The church is looking for
[25:56] better letters. I have this written
[25:57] here.
[25:59] God is looking for better men channel
[26:02] that he could exert his power upon the
[26:06] world. What the church needs today is
[26:09] not more machinery, a new organization
[26:12] or better methods, but men whom the Holy
[26:16] Ghost can use. Men of prayer. Men mighty
[26:20] in prayer. The Holy Ghost does not flow
[26:25] through methods but through men. He does
[26:28] not come on machinery but on men. He
[26:31] does not anoint plans and thoughts and
[26:34] ideas in that way but men of prayer. So
[26:38] at the ending of the day God is seeking
[26:43] better men not so much better methods
[26:46] but better man. And that is what he said
[26:48] about David and comparing to Saul I find
[26:52] a better man. You know people look at
[26:54] gifts, ministerial gifts, pastor gift,
[26:56] apostle gift, prophet gift or whatever
[26:58] gift and they look at gift but this was
[27:02] the curse of the Pentecostal age. Gifted
[27:06] men without life and that is what he
[27:10] sent a prophet to bring the word that we
[27:12] could have life along with gifts. So the
[27:17] emphasis is not who is more gifted, who
[27:19] higher gifted, who are more revelation,
[27:21] who have more uh knowledge or more
[27:23] information, but coming into this
[27:26] stature of life which the prophets call
[27:29] the perfect man. Listen to this as we
[27:30] kind of wrap up here.
[27:34] We hear this cry on the radio, Lord,
[27:36] give us a revival in our time. It's
[27:38] uplifted to hear people cry for revival.
[27:41] And God made a promise. If my people
[27:44] that is called by my name shall assemble
[27:46] themselves together and pray, I'll hear
[27:48] from heaven. And tonight we want to
[27:50] think on that and remember in the midst
[27:53] of all this cry, God, here we go, cannot
[27:56] send a revival until he's got man in
[28:01] shape to take it. Now, we know the bride
[28:03] revival is promised. He spoke that seven
[28:05] thunders will be the bright revival.
[28:07] That is promised. He said we cannot have
[28:10] a revival until we got God called men.
[28:14] This is not books. This is not given out
[28:15] tapes. God trained men that is not
[28:18] trained up in a school of theology or
[28:20] education but rugged men of faith that
[28:23] God has brought through his school of
[28:25] rugged training. Men who are not afraid
[28:28] to face the fire. Men who has come into
[28:31] the presence of God and knows his power.
[28:34] Knows his omnipotence. knows his healing
[28:37] power. Some men train to know the living
[28:40] God. It's right to train them by the
[28:42] word, but the letter killth. The spirit
[28:45] giveth life. And before we can have this
[28:48] revival, God has to call out and train
[28:52] men. God trained men to carry this
[28:55] message.
[28:57] They don't care what the opposition is.
[29:00] They are willing to go to the fiery
[29:02] furnace and defeat or to the lion's den
[29:04] or wherever it may be. They are ready to
[29:06] go because they have been in the
[29:08] presence of God and know that he is
[29:10] whether he's a victory or defeat still
[29:12] stand the same. That's the kind of
[29:14] training God does to a man. The kind of
[29:18] training God does to a man. It's very
[29:20] strange to think that God would do that.
[29:22] God trains his men like that. But he
[29:25] does. You know, we have an old song. We
[29:27] sing some through the waters, some
[29:29] through the flood, some through deep
[29:31] trials, but all through the blood. God
[29:34] leads his people. So here it saints
[29:36] through great trials to purge them and
[29:41] sometime it take years to do it. This is
[29:46] not idle words. God
[29:50] leaves his people through great trials
[29:54] to purge them and sometime it take years
[29:59] to do it. As for myself tonight, I
[30:03] believe prophecy coming that right now
[30:06] God is training such men to meet the
[30:09] front line. Men who are going through
[30:13] and times shook from their feet.
[30:15] Sometimes it look like the whole thing
[30:17] is falling but yet in the midst of it
[30:20] they know that living God and keep their
[30:23] face forward, keep moving on. And many
[30:27] people praying for revival. I wonder if
[30:29] sometimes those that are praying, if
[30:32] their own prayers don't stop up the
[30:33] wells of blessing, they are cowardly,
[30:36] afraid to trust God, afraid to take him
[30:39] at his word, afraid to believe he still
[30:42] lives. The Bible says he's the same
[30:44] yesterday, today, and forever.
[30:47] Okay. Now said this here these virtues
[30:51] virtues has to be endear
[30:54] before the capstone will ever come on
[30:58] it. You might shout, you might sing, you
[31:01] might speak in tongues and dance. That
[31:03] has nothing to do with it. Until these
[31:05] things are scripturally proven and
[31:08] sealed into you, the Holy Spirit sees
[31:11] you as an individual, then you are son
[31:15] and daughter. Let my son go tonight that
[31:19] he may serve me. Jesus commission as we
[31:23] close according to Isaiah 51 was clear.
[31:28] Isaiah 51 said, "The spirit is upon me.
[31:31] This is like another Moses. This is like
[31:34] another deliverer coming forth. What
[31:35] for? It's upon me because the Lord has
[31:38] anointed me to preach, good tidings to
[31:42] the meek. He had sent me to do what? The
[31:46] ministry of Christ, to bind up the
[31:48] brokenhearted,
[31:50] to proclaim liberty, freedom to the
[31:52] captives, to the opening of prison to
[31:55] them that are bound. to proclaim the
[31:58] acceptability of the Lord which is
[32:00] Jubilee and the day of vengeance of our
[32:02] God to comfort all that more. Let my son
[32:08] go that he may serve me. I wonder how
[32:12] much parents
[32:14] actually bind their children
[32:16] by what they say, by how they act, by
[32:20] what they do. When God in his burden
[32:25] tell Moses to tell Pharaoh, Israel is my
[32:29] firstborn,
[32:31] let him go. If you don't let him go, I
[32:34] will take your firstborn.
[32:36] All right. So, as we close, this is the
[32:37] final quote I have here.
[32:40] What a brand his presence
[32:43] in the individual
[32:45] with personal vindication of himself
[32:49] expressing himself the living word
[32:52] that's promised for the day expressing
[32:54] itself through you a vindication of the
[32:58] great revelation of God. Look here we
[33:00] go. This is a bomb only in an
[33:03] individual.
[33:05] Never in a group. an individual
[33:10] not in a group. His identification is
[33:13] with an individual. You get that? Say
[33:16] amen. Not with Methodists,
[33:19] not with Baptist, not with Presbyterian,
[33:23] not the Lutheran, not the Pentecostal,
[33:26] but as an individual.
[33:28] I want you to see tonight that brother
[33:31] Brandon said the Holy Ghost is poured
[33:34] out on individuals. I want you to see
[33:37] tonight that the veil that was rent from
[33:40] top to the bottom and Jesus died give
[33:43] you an individual under the song of my
[33:46] voice tonight direct access to shikina
[33:50] glory or presence he went on to say this
[33:53] I'll take one I'll leave one I'll
[33:55] separate them they'll be a field I'll
[33:57] take one I'll leave one there between a
[33:58] bed I'll take one and leave one it's not
[34:00] a group it's a personal vindication of a
[34:05] pregnantated child of God filled with
[34:08] the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God
[34:11] that he don't care about anything else
[34:14] and the Holy Spirit living its life
[34:16] while Satan through him showing personal
[34:19] vindication of the word itself
[34:22] expressing itself to the people and to
[34:25] the world. You know today I was thinking
[34:26] about a prison and how prison limits you
[34:30] and how Paul say I'm a prisoner of Jesus
[34:32] Christ. In a prison, you can't feel to
[34:36] go and stroll. You can't feel to go by
[34:38] the beach. You can't feel gushed a
[34:40] feeling for pizza.
[34:42] It does not exist.
[34:45] You are in a bind.
[34:47] You are in a holding bay. I realize that
[34:52] if God is to take us truly as prisoners,
[34:56] we can't do our own thing.
[34:58] We have got away a lot with our own
[35:00] thoughts, our own way and our own ideas
[35:03] because as human beings we supposed to
[35:05] be God's small G and because of that he
[35:09] give us the power of choice and
[35:10] decisions to choose. He know what way we
[35:14] will go. Israel as I close didn't know
[35:18] the ways of God. So Moses the commission
[35:22] was to bring them to this mountain that
[35:24] I may reveal or unveil myself to these
[35:28] people
[35:30] because in a family if we don't relate
[35:33] communicate connect
[35:36] the family will be on a strain.
[35:40] Family needs connection. Whether it's
[35:42] father, son, mother, daughter, brother,
[35:46] sister, brother, brother, sister,
[35:48] sister. That's what family connection is
[35:50] all about. This whole team of adoption,
[35:54] which is what this age is about. And
[35:55] spiritual maturity is not you just by
[35:59] yourself.
[36:01] It's just is you as part of a family,
[36:03] the family of God. And that is why we
[36:05] are members one of another in this
[36:07] glorious body of Christ. So God wanted
[36:10] to truly place us in this body by his
[36:13] spirit by a mighty deliverance and
[36:15] breakthrough. The call out of Egypt
[36:18] wasn't just to be called out was to be
[36:21] called out that he might serve me.
[36:24] Let go my son. I want you to
[36:29] plug into that word that God gave Moses
[36:33] to tell Pharaoh and begin to speak and
[36:36] pray for your family, for your children,
[36:41] for your loved ones, for your
[36:43] connections that this word may go out
[36:45] tonight. Let go my son that he may come
[36:50] and serve me. Let's bow our heads.
[36:52] Heavenly Father, it was such a glorious
[36:55] thing to see how you view Israel as a
[36:59] son
[37:01] and son carries so much with it. As a
[37:06] child, we are no different from a
[37:08] servant, though he be heir of all
[37:10] things, but is under tutors and
[37:12] governors until the time appointed by
[37:14] the father. And here in Hosea, I say,
[37:16] "When Israel was a child,
[37:19] I called my son out of Egypt."
[37:22] God the Bible say when I was a child I
[37:24] speak like a child understood as a child
[37:26] but when I become a man so childhood
[37:30] childish is just a stage a stage in
[37:34] which we grow
[37:36] we get stronger we get responsible we
[37:39] take on responsibility to come into true
[37:41] maturity and that is how you want us
[37:43] tonight to be solid to be established to
[37:47] be rooted to be grounded in the love of
[37:49] God that even though we are trapped
[37:51] died. Even though we are tested, even
[37:53] though we have battles, even though we
[37:55] have storms, we could weather them. We
[37:57] could hold true, we could find faith as
[38:00] bad eyes preach in a time of storm, we
[38:02] could find you to be faithful. We could
[38:04] find you to be trustworthy because you
[38:06] promised never to leave, never to
[38:08] forsake us. And Father God, as the
[38:09] people go in prayer tonight, may the
[38:11] anointing be with them in a special way.
[38:13] The sick touch them, the elderly touch
[38:15] them. Oh God, the weak touch them. May
[38:17] each one be encouraged. May they see
[38:19] that Jesus was released on the earth to
[38:21] set captive free, to open up prison
[38:24] bars, to heal the brokenhearted. There
[38:26] are people with broken hearts, bad
[38:28] experiences, and only you could heal
[38:30] them. Father, words cannot do it. But
[38:32] your love, your presence, your touch can
[38:35] do it. Lord, heal marriages, heal hurts,
[38:37] heal fears, heal past, heal sicknesses,
[38:40] heal disease, sickness of the flesh,
[38:41] sicknesses of the spirit, sicknesses of
[38:43] the soul. whatever condition, wherever
[38:45] the conditions are at, that you can
[38:47] release them from guilt, from the past,
[38:49] from their fears and bring them into the
[38:51] glorious liberty which is promised in
[38:53] this last day to the sons and daughters
[38:55] of God. You see us as individuals. You
[38:57] see us striving. You see us pressing.
[38:59] You see us fighting. You see us battling
[39:01] because the battle of angels have now
[39:03] become the battle of men. Help us
[39:04] tonight as we grow in prayer. As we
[39:08] press in prayer, as we believe you, oh
[39:10] God, for all things, have your way among
[39:12] your people tonight in their homes,
[39:14] wherever they are, may you visit them in
[39:16] a special way tonight. In Jesus name I
[39:18] ask it. Amen. Tell Pharaoh, release my
[39:23] son. God bless you as we ask that you
[39:26] get on in prayer at this time. Praise
[39:28] the Lord.

[1:30:18] the Lord. Father, we praise you. Father,
[1:30:20] we bless you. Father, we thank you. We
[1:30:22] thank you for your presence. We thank
[1:30:23] you for answering prayer. We thank you
[1:30:25] for hearing the cries of your people. We
[1:30:27] thank you for hearing and answering
[1:30:29] prayer. We thank you for confirming your
[1:30:30] word. We thank you for who you are, the
[1:30:33] Lord the redeemer, redeeming us from
[1:30:34] sin, from unbelief, everything that's
[1:30:37] contrary to your will in your word.
[1:30:38] Thank you, Father. Blessed be the name
[1:30:40] of the Lord. Lord, bless your saints
[1:30:42] tonight.
[1:30:44] Just want to say with you that share
[1:30:46] with you that the rapture is not a group
[1:30:49] group thing. Rapture is specific.
[1:30:52] There'll be two in a bed, one taken, one
[1:30:54] left. We don't die in a group. One by
[1:30:58] one we get the portals there to dwell
[1:31:00] with the immortals. One by one we enter
[1:31:02] in. And as an individual we have to
[1:31:05] fight for what we know is our own. You
[1:31:08] have to fight. You have to take great
[1:31:10] courage. And don't say you don't like
[1:31:14] confrontation. You cannot defeat what
[1:31:16] you're not prepared to confront. We have
[1:31:18] to confront our own selves. See yourself
[1:31:21] as a son. See yourself as God telling
[1:31:24] the devil, "Let my son go that he might
[1:31:26] serve me." See yourself being released
[1:31:28] from everything that has bound that you
[1:31:31] are going to be released because this is
[1:31:33] how God want you. Want you want you to
[1:31:35] be a free son, a liberated son, a son
[1:31:38] that is free from all hindrances that
[1:31:40] you could effectively serve the Lord. So
[1:31:42] at this time I want to bow uh let us bow
[1:31:44] our heads as we close in prayer.
[1:31:46] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[1:31:48] word. Lord, to see from the scriptures
[1:31:50] what you told Moses, what it tell
[1:31:52] Pharaoh, how you saw the children of
[1:31:55] Israel as son, as family, family that is
[1:32:00] in trouble, family that is in bondage,
[1:32:03] family that is bruised, battered, family
[1:32:05] that is depressed, but family that is
[1:32:08] pushed to call upon you. your son in
[1:32:10] trouble, your daughter in trouble, your
[1:32:13] children in trouble, and yet they are
[1:32:15] your children, and you want them to be
[1:32:18] free. God, may the people get it in
[1:32:20] their hearts tonight that your desire,
[1:32:23] your aim is not for children or family
[1:32:26] to be bound, but they be set free. The
[1:32:29] enemy have them, Lord, but your word
[1:32:31] come to free them, to loose them. That's
[1:32:33] what the anointing was released for.
[1:32:35] That is what Jesus declared. The spirit
[1:32:38] is upon me because he had anointed me to
[1:32:41] do these things. Your prophet saw some
[1:32:43] young men Lord tied up. Lord, some got
[1:32:48] freed, some broke out and some couldn't
[1:32:50] get broke out broke couldn't break out
[1:32:53] and you said house of hell give way to
[1:32:55] the name of Jesus Christ. And father
[1:32:57] God, may the authority come down, Lord,
[1:32:59] to speak that word, house of hell give
[1:33:01] way to the name of Jesus Christ. I
[1:33:03] commit your children into your hands,
[1:33:05] your people into your hands that they
[1:33:06] may see your promises, liberty, freedom,
[1:33:10] deliverance granted God in Jesus I ask
[1:33:12] it. Amen. God bless you. Looking forward
[1:33:14] to see you on Sunday. Come under great
[1:33:16] expectation, great faith, looking to see
[1:33:18] what the Lord will do. God bless you. We
[1:33:21] are dismissed tonight.
