[27:25] blessed be the name of the lord are you
[27:27] happy to be in the house of the lord
[27:29] this morning
[27:36] if you have your bibles would you turn
[27:39] with me to two portions of scripture
[27:42] reading from matthew chapter 24.
[27:47] i read it from acts chapter 19.
[28:04] matthew 24 and verse 14.
[28:08] then shall two be in the field
[28:11] the one shall be taken and the other
[28:14] left
[28:16] two women shall be grinding at the mill
[28:19] the one shall be taken and the other
[28:22] left
[28:23] watch therefore for ye know not what
[28:25] hour
[28:26] your lord doth come but know this that
[28:30] if the goodman of the house
[28:32] had known in what watch the thief would
[28:35] come
[28:35] he would have watched and would not have
[28:38] suffered his house to be broken up
[28:41] therefore be also ready for in such an
[28:44] hour as you think not
[28:46] the son of man cometh and reading from
[28:49] acts chapter 19
[28:52] i'm reading from verse one
[29:04] and it came to pass that while apollos
[29:06] was at corinth paul
[29:08] having passed through the upper coast
[29:09] came to ephesus
[29:11] and finding certain disciples he said
[29:13] unto them have he
[29:15] received the holy ghost since he
[29:16] believes and they said unto him we have
[29:19] not so much has heard
[29:21] whether there be any holy ghost and he
[29:23] said unto them unto what then we
[29:25] baptized and they said unto john's
[29:27] baptism then said paul
[29:30] john verily baptized with the baptism of
[29:33] repentance saying unto the people
[29:35] that they should believe on him which
[29:37] should come after him that is on christ
[29:39] jesus
[29:40] when they heard this they were baptized
[29:42] in the name
[29:43] of the lord jesus and when paul had laid
[29:46] his hands upon them the holy ghost came
[29:48] on them
[29:49] and they speak with tongues and
[29:51] prophesied may the lord have a blessing
[29:53] to the reading of his word
[29:54] he may be seated so for a title this
[29:58] morning
[29:59] have you received the holy ghost
[30:02] since you believed and for a subject
[30:06] desperate to possess your individual
[30:10] inheritance and an inspiration
[30:13] another book of acts
[30:17] so this morning we want to really hone
[30:20] into individuals
[30:23] hone into your christian walk your
[30:25] christian journey
[30:27] and to what you have to be expecting
[30:30] and what you ought to be preparing
[30:33] for you know by the branham he gave an
[30:37] analogy he said
[30:38] i believe it was a turtle and he said he
[30:41] took a stick and
[30:43] tried to prod the turtle the turtle
[30:44] didn't move he threw something else in a
[30:46] turtle
[30:47] he didn't respond he said it's only when
[30:50] he
[30:50] took some fire and put it to the turtle
[30:53] the turtle legs flew out and he's had to
[30:55] move at his fastest speed because that
[30:59] is what fire does
[31:01] it gets you moving and
[31:04] it is the nature of human beings who try
[31:07] to get comfortable wherever they're at
[31:10] you moved to a different country you
[31:11] moved a different neighborhood you moved
[31:13] a different job
[31:14] in whatever position you are in it's
[31:16] your nature to get
[31:17] comfortable but within the context of
[31:20] your spiritual journey there is no such
[31:22] thing as
[31:23] as staying comfortable you have to stay
[31:26] moving
[31:27] because you have an enemy a real enemy
[31:29] and this war that we're fighting is not
[31:31] a war
[31:32] against flesh or blood isn't a war
[31:34] against your wife or your husband or
[31:35] your children or your boss so
[31:37] it has nothing to do with that it's a
[31:38] spiritual war because you are under a
[31:40] different covenant
[31:41] what happens out there in the world is
[31:43] different from what you will experience
[31:45] because you are under
[31:46] a different covenant you are here to be
[31:49] tested and
[31:49] for a proving ground that you are not
[31:52] going to be deceived and no matter what
[31:54] temptation or trial
[31:55] comes your way you will have a testimony
[31:57] that you will serve god
[31:59] you're not here to be a church member
[32:01] you're not here to be in the message you
[32:03] are here to have a testimony
[32:05] to show the world to show your family
[32:07] that you will serve the lord
[32:09] that he is your king that he is your
[32:11] majesty that he is your
[32:12] leader he is your guide he is your joy
[32:15] he is your peace you
[32:17] you look to him to keep you going you
[32:19] look to him to wake you up in the
[32:20] morning when the doctor
[32:22] runs out of ideas about what's wrong
[32:24] with you you know he knows
[32:26] because he made you he is your creator
[32:28] he is the great physician he is your
[32:30] guidance
[32:31] and that is what keeps you inspired it's
[32:33] all about him
[32:36] the moment your christian journey loses
[32:39] him
[32:39] as your focus there's something wrong
[32:41] there are many people
[32:42] church is a ritual amen it's it's i
[32:46] heard somebody say it's a casual it's a
[32:47] thing to do it's on your to-do list
[32:50] so there's search on sunday then i have
[32:51] to go and pay the bill on monday and
[32:52] then i have to deliver this report on
[32:54] tuesday it's a thing to do
[32:56] it has become casual to us instead of it
[32:59] being the very source of our existence
[33:03] that this kingdom that we come from is a
[33:05] different world it's a
[33:07] it's a different place it's a different
[33:08] life it's a different law
[33:10] and that kingdom is what we are fighting
[33:12] to press into
[33:13] and the kingdom suffered violence and
[33:16] the violence taken by force
[33:19] with all of our efforts somebody always
[33:22] spoke about it last week you could take
[33:23] a pig and put a bow tie on the pig put
[33:25] a three-piece suit on the pig put
[33:27] perfume on the pig you could
[33:29] put the pig in a limousine and drive it
[33:31] his destination the moment it comes out
[33:32] of the control environment
[33:35] it will go back to what it used to do
[33:37] because that's the nature of the pig
[33:40] and that's the nature of every man
[33:42] that's born in sin and shaped in
[33:44] iniquity and the bible said
[33:45] all have come short but until your
[33:48] nature is changed you'll go back to your
[33:52] old ways
[33:55] until there's something change in your
[33:57] heart
[33:58] you go back to your old ways
[34:02] and the preaching of the gospel is to
[34:04] prepare you for an encounter with the
[34:07] pillar of fire
[34:09] the disciples they walked with jesus
[34:11] they talked with jesus
[34:13] they saw miracles if it was any group of
[34:16] people
[34:17] who should have not backslid was the
[34:19] disciples think about it
[34:21] think about being with jesus by the
[34:22] sheen and you're there on the boat
[34:25] and the storm comes and jesus is
[34:27] sleeping and you are scared and jesus
[34:29] wakes him and says peace be still
[34:30] wouldn't you be persuaded of what this
[34:33] jesus is talking about
[34:35] you're hungry and he takes five loaves
[34:37] and two fishes and feeds
[34:39] thousands of people wouldn't that
[34:41] persuade you of this man's ministry
[34:45] when jesus stood outside of the grave of
[34:48] lazarus and say lazarus comfort
[34:51] how much more examples do you need
[34:53] before you will convince that this
[34:54] ministry is right
[34:57] but yet still when jesus died what did
[34:59] these disciples
[35:00] do they went back to fishing
[35:05] they went back to what they used to do
[35:07] they went back to their old ways
[35:09] for three and a half years as it were
[35:11] they had listened to
[35:13] the greatest preacher who would ever
[35:15] preach
[35:17] they listened to the greatest teacher
[35:19] who would ever teach
[35:21] they listened to god himself veil in 16
[35:23] elements
[35:24] and after his three and a half year
[35:26] ministry when jesus died these disciples
[35:30] went back fishing
[35:34] so don't be surprised when people stand
[35:36] in church for years
[35:39] and you can't understand how is it they
[35:42] somehow find themselves
[35:44] fishing they find themselves
[35:48] just there they find themselves no
[35:51] joy no zeal no enthusiasm they
[35:54] find themselves their chest in church or
[35:56] maybe not even in church or
[35:58] coming to church when they want to come
[35:59] to church or praying when they think
[36:01] they should pray or when is an emergency
[36:05] because this is how the disciples found
[36:06] themselves until jesus
[36:09] rose from the dead and breathed upon
[36:11] them receiving the holy ghost
[36:14] and in his resurrection ministry he
[36:16] opened their understanding to the
[36:18] scriptures
[36:19] and he placed them under a promise but
[36:22] even while they were under the promise
[36:24] the bible said they were afraid
[36:27] and they hid in the upper room but
[36:29] something happened in their lives when
[36:31] the holy ghost came
[36:33] one day the bible says there was a sound
[36:35] from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind
[36:37] and it
[36:37] filled the whole house where they were
[36:39] sitting in and cloven tongues of fire
[36:41] divided itself and
[36:43] came out upon each one and they walked
[36:45] out that room without fear
[36:47] and peter said this is that which was
[36:50] spoken by the prophet joel
[36:52] he said these men are not drunk as use
[36:54] of poles but this is
[36:55] that and when the holy ghost came upon
[36:57] peter all of his fear was gone
[37:00] all of his condition was gone all of his
[37:02] backsliding was gone
[37:04] what was it it was the holy ghost itself
[37:07] it was not a
[37:08] book it was not a thief it was not a
[37:09] message it was the holy ghost itself
[37:12] a portion of god had tabernacled himself
[37:15] inside of these men and that is what we
[37:18] need that's what
[37:19] we need in here this morning
[37:23] for the holy ghost itself to tabernacle
[37:26] in each one of us
[37:28] and that's my burden this morning
[37:31] because if you are
[37:32] if you don't know that's what you are
[37:34] supposed to expect or prepare for
[37:36] you will not make preparation for it but
[37:39] those disciples they went into the upper
[37:41] room under the promise
[37:43] received you the holy ghost so they were
[37:45] there getting ready
[37:48] they were there making preparations they
[37:50] were there and they had separating
[37:52] themselves from the world
[37:54] the situations that had now existed that
[37:56] forced them into that place
[37:59] where they couldn't go out where they
[38:02] couldn't worry about what out there
[38:04] because the romans were
[38:05] were looking for them but while they
[38:08] were there god met them
[38:10] and friends is that easy when you have
[38:12] to stand alone most of us we
[38:14] we want to be part of something but
[38:16] those disciples
[38:18] had to stand alone away from family away
[38:20] from friends and
[38:21] among others who had the same motivation
[38:25] others who had the same desire others
[38:27] who wanted to go to the same place
[38:30] and that's what has to happen to each of
[38:31] you you must be prepared to separate
[38:33] from everything
[38:34] that will take you away from your
[38:35] spiritual destination
[38:38] friends we have to get desperate
[38:41] to receive the holy ghost it's not just
[38:44] believing because
[38:46] when paul in acts 19 met some believers
[38:49] he asked them the question have you
[38:51] received the holy ghost
[38:52] since you believed the question is that
[38:55] if you are a believer
[38:57] the question is that if you have the
[38:58] books and if you have the tapes and if
[39:00] you know the message
[39:01] the question is have you received the
[39:03] holy ghost
[39:05] since you believed and if you have not
[39:08] received the holy ghost
[39:09] there ought to be a desperation in your
[39:11] soul
[39:12] day and night morning and evening
[39:15] day and night morning and evening lord i
[39:18] need this
[39:19] because the holy ghost is eternal life
[39:22] the holy ghost is
[39:23] power the holy ghost is your inheritance
[39:26] the holy ghost is the token
[39:28] that god wants to look at can the church
[39:31] say amen
[39:33] the holy ghost will burn the snake out
[39:36] of your heart
[39:37] the holy ghost will take those desires
[39:39] that you are struggling with
[39:41] because you could try to bring your body
[39:43] under subjection
[39:44] and there's a lot you could do as a
[39:46] human and a man you could try with your
[39:47] choices
[39:48] but it's a whole different thing when
[39:50] the holy ghost takes complete control
[39:52] and takes control of your elements takes
[39:55] control of your
[39:56] eyes takes control of your ears where
[39:58] you only go where he wants you to go
[40:00] it's no longer
[40:01] you choosing not to do but you have gone
[40:04] past that stage you have already chosen
[40:06] and has brought over peace last week
[40:07] because thou has done this thing
[40:10] then the holy ghost has the full
[40:12] authority to take his place in your
[40:14] heart
[40:15] and lead you to where you don't even
[40:16] want to go take you to where you don't
[40:18] even want to go
[40:19] because it's a holy ghost it's power
[40:23] the holy ghost will change the way you
[40:25] walk it'll change the way you talk
[40:27] it'll change the way you worship it'll
[40:30] change the way you pray
[40:31] it'll change the way you love it'll
[40:34] change what you eat
[40:35] it'll change where you go it'll make you
[40:37] a christian
[40:38] it'll make you testify it'll make you
[40:41] talk different
[40:42] it'll make you walk different it'll tie
[40:45] you
[40:45] he is your comforter that's what the
[40:47] holy ghost is he is your guide
[40:50] he will take you to your school he will
[40:52] take you to your
[40:53] job he will comfort you and nobody else
[40:55] can
[40:56] that's what the holy ghost gives you for
[40:58] it gives you power
[41:00] it gives you power to press up it gives
[41:02] you power to break free
[41:04] that's what we need
[41:06] [Applause]
[41:08] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[41:12] that's what we need the holy ghost it's
[41:14] power
[41:15] when the holy ghost comes upon you you
[41:17] no longer yourself
[41:19] when the holy ghost comes upon you they
[41:21] thought that it was peter
[41:23] that they were talking to but the holy
[41:25] ghost had tabernacled himself
[41:28] in the book of acts of on the throne of
[41:30] peter's heart
[41:31] peter was no longer in control peter
[41:34] couldn't stop the holy ghost
[41:36] when the holy ghost has the preeminence
[41:38] he does what he wants to do
[41:40] and that's god's strategy he wants
[41:42] individuals
[41:44] that he can place the holy ghost in and
[41:46] shape the world
[41:48] like he did on the day of pentecost come
[41:50] on young people
[41:51] is there anybody wants the holy ghost is
[41:53] anybody needs a holy ghost
[41:55] that's what this service is about this
[41:57] morning it's a holy ghost service

[42:05] that's your promise that's your promise
[42:08] don't you know your party is a temple of
[42:10] the holy ghost
[42:11] the reason you were born the reason you
[42:14] were born is to be a tabernacle
[42:16] that the holy ghost can step in the holy
[42:18] ghost doesn't want to fill this building
[42:20] he wants to fill this temple he doesn't
[42:22] want to be tied down
[42:24] to a physical location the holy ghost

[42:33] family's house how will he move he'll
[42:35] move inside of you

[42:48] i give up i'm no more myself i've tried

[43:24] not the measure
[43:25] of your walk with god how much you read
[43:28] is not the measure
[43:30] of your walk with god but the measure
[43:32] that you have crossed over
[43:34] is when the holy ghost comes upon you
[43:37] peter
[43:37] he graduated on the day of pentecost
[43:41] he didn't graduate when he walked
[43:43] underwater he graduated

[44:57] the bible says
[44:58] to put a mark upon those that sigh on
[45:01] crime

[45:04] comfortable
[45:05] the abomination doesn't bother us
[45:07] anymore the abomination doesn't affect
[45:09] us anymore
[45:10] we tolerate the foolishness but for the
[45:13] pranam said god cannot build his church

[47:18] [Applause]
[47:20] you may be seated
[47:24] we're going to make this place
[47:25] uncomfortable
[47:26] [Applause]
[47:28] uncomfortable for people who don't want
[47:30] to be christians
[47:32] there are other churches to go to this
[47:34] place would be uncomfortable
[47:36] to people who don't really want god but
[47:38] abraham said in every church
[47:39] there are three kinds of believers they
[47:41] are make believers
[47:43] they are unbelievers and they are true
[47:44] believers we can't kick out the make and
[47:48] the unbeliever because some of them they
[47:49] are good actors but what we can do is
[47:52] make the church so uncomfortable
[47:54] that the make believers feel like this
[47:56] is not for me anymore
[47:58] and the unbelievers say this is not for
[48:00] me anymore you're preaching too hard
[48:02] you're preaching too rough you're
[48:04] preaching too tough
[48:08] some of you are too lazy
[48:11] too lazy as christians
[48:14] how do you want god to bless you and you
[48:16] don't want to sacrifice
[48:18] when david said we bring a sacrifice of
[48:21] praise into the house of god what does
[48:24] that mean
[48:25] it's a sacrifice it's when you don't
[48:27] feel like praising
[48:28] when things are going wrong when you're
[48:31] tired in your body
[48:32] when you're sick all over but yet still
[48:36] you bring a sacrifice and you offer it
[48:39] to
[48:39] god and say lord i'm broken i'm
[48:42] tired i'm wary but i want to praise you
[48:51] hallelujah get out your flesh
[48:54] get out your laziness get out your
[48:57] canality
[48:58] if you know you need to repent repent
[49:00] make it right with god
[49:02] and get on fire for god he is still the
[49:05] same yesterday
[49:06] he has killed us entertained he has
[49:08] killed us him forever
[49:22] [Applause]
[49:24] [Music]
[49:27] [Applause]
[49:29] somebody's gonna break feet today
[49:31] somebody's gonna break free
[49:33] somebody's gonna break free today and
[49:35] light the fire
[49:37] not only here but when you go back to
[49:38] your home light of fire light a fire
[49:41] in your house like the fire in your car
[49:44] throw those music things out that's not
[49:46] supposed to be there
[49:47] throw it out just don't even wander and
[49:49] land just throw it out
[49:59] god your heart because the holy ghost
[50:02] wants to go there
[50:03] got it got it
[50:06] protect it the enemy wants to be there
[50:10] but we're not going to let him be there
[50:12] because there's a seed of predestination
[50:14] that was planted in your soul
[50:16] before there was a world you cannot fail
[50:19] you are not even the believer
[50:24] brother branham said you were not even
[50:26] the believer but the word in you
[50:30] you didn't even put it there he made it
[50:33] that you can't even miss this he
[50:36] made it that no matter what you did you
[50:39] couldn't miss this appointment
[50:42] the devil couldn't see when he did it
[50:44] but he dropped a seed
[50:46] a hidden seed inside of your soul
[50:49] and every seed has got to bring forth
[50:53] after its kind it just needs the right
[50:55] atmosphere
[50:56] so let's create the atmosphere oh
[50:59] because in the right atmosphere
[51:01] satan gets mad he's upset this morning
[51:04] he's upset you're in the house of god
[51:06] he wish you stayed on this morning but
[51:08] you made it to the house of god
[51:11] and because you are here he's in trouble
[51:13] he's in trouble
[51:15] he's in trouble you broke past the
[51:17] burial
[51:18] when you woke up this morning something
[51:20] got a hold of you
[51:23] oh somebody help me preach this morning
[51:25] somebody help me preach this morning
[51:27] you didn't even wake up yourself you
[51:30] might have struggled
[51:31] to get into the car you struggled to get
[51:33] your clothes
[51:34] you struggle up the road you weren't
[51:36] feeling all religious
[51:38] but the devil he knew something was
[51:40] going to happen
[51:41] that's why it was a struggle if it
[51:44] wasn't a struggle
[51:45] there's no blessing but if there was a
[51:47] struggle give the lord a shout of praise
[51:50] because the devil is finished you are
[51:52] pressed fast
[51:53] like the lily you press past and you are
[51:56] here
[51:57] and because you are here and god is here
[52:00] something has got to happen
[52:04] [Applause]
[52:06] holy ghost fire polling was power
[52:09] polygons fire holding us power give me
[52:12] the all-time religion
[52:14] give me the old-time preaching
[52:18] [Applause]
[52:38] [Music]
[52:43] the devil has no power no but everybody
[52:46] said the devil is a bluff
[52:47] that pain in your body it's a bluff
[52:50] [Applause]
[52:51] the condition of your children is a
[52:53] bluff
[52:54] [Applause]
[52:56] the problems in your marriage is a bluff
[53:00] your financial problems is a bluff the
[53:03] devil has no power
[53:07] [Applause]
[53:12] may your spiritual minds open up
[53:16] that you were represented
[53:19] when lucifer got his angels and tried to
[53:23] do a cool up there michael drew his
[53:26] sword
[53:28] and there were some angels some sons of
[53:31] god
[53:32] some morning stars who fought with
[53:34] michael
[53:36] [Applause]
[53:37] these angelic spirits they represented
[53:40] us
[53:42] these angelic beings represented us
[53:45] so fighting in the spiritual realm is
[53:48] not
[53:48] foreign to us it is what we do
[53:52] and that's why god could say whatever
[53:54] you blind on earth
[53:55] will be bound in heaven and whatever you
[53:57] loose on earth
[53:58] will be loosed in heaven because he
[54:00] knows you can handle it
[54:02] because you are attribute sons of the
[54:07] [Applause]
[54:08] spirit
[54:11] so this morning you may be seated
[54:14] we serve notice to every female
[54:17] condition

[54:46] those are demons and if it's our spirits
[54:49] and demons
[54:50] we are equipped to take them on because
[54:53] there's
[54:53] power in the church of the living god

[55:27] serving notice
[55:28] to let the devil know that we are
[55:30] counting down

[55:42] we are evacuating the devil this morning
[55:45] from this church
[55:47] we are serving and notice satan
[55:50] a different storm is coming this is our
[55:52] storm
[55:53] it's a spiritual storm
[55:59] [Applause]
[56:00] hallelujah your children are coming back
[56:04] yes yes yes
[56:07] your son is coming back yes your
[56:10] daughter
[56:10] is coming back yes your husband coming
[56:14] back
[56:14] yes your wife coming back yes your
[56:17] brother
[56:18] yes your sister yes say it claim it
[56:21] believe it rejoice about it it's got to
[56:24] happen
[56:25] thus saith the lord
[56:31] [Applause]
[56:42] hello
[56:44] [Applause]
[56:51] jesus said to peter
[56:55] the devil has desired to sift you like
[56:59] wheat
[57:04] in that day sifting of the wheat
[57:08] was not done through the strainers that
[57:10] we have now
[57:13] the sifting of the wheat but the anthony
[57:15] was they would have these
[57:17] almost four sticks as it were with
[57:19] almost like a cloth between a huge
[57:22] it wasn't like one person's job but they
[57:24] would
[57:25] throw it up and throw it up so when
[57:28] jesus telling this to peter peter
[57:31] noticeably he would be concerned
[57:33] because the devil wants to sift you like
[57:34] me throw your life up and down and
[57:37] side to side you don't know where your
[57:39] foot is you don't know where you are
[57:41] he said he said but i have prayed
[57:44] [Applause]
[57:45] that your feet still not
[57:54] listen he didn't say you wouldn't be
[57:57] sifted
[58:00] he said the devil desires to sift you
[58:02] like
[58:03] he didn't go into how and when and how
[58:06] long if just
[58:07] what happened but he said listen no
[58:08] matter what you go to i've prayed for
[58:10] you
[58:12] that through all of what you have to go
[58:14] through
[58:15] your feet would feel not
[58:19] because if you keep your feet
[58:22] that faith is what will keep you going
[58:25] if you hold on to this world and this
[58:27] promise
[58:28] no matter if you're up you're down your
[58:31] upside
[58:32] down just keep your feet
[58:37] can the church say man
[58:40] you may be seated i pray that today
[58:45] your spiritual eyes will open up and the
[58:48] amnesia that you have been suffering
[58:50] because some of you
[58:51] really have to have forgotten who you
[58:53] are to do some of the things that
[58:56] you want to do but as you
[58:59] come to a greater realization of who you
[59:02] are in god it should give you a
[59:04] confidence
[59:06] to tell the devil no
[59:12] it sounds very simple but it's in these
[59:15] day-to-day victories that we win the war
[59:21] [Applause]
[59:22] you are the sum total of every decision
[59:24] you make
[59:32] years ago we didn't have as much
[59:33] lifestyle diseases as we have now
[59:37] but we have evolved now we have young
[59:40] children addicted to soft drink and
[59:43] addicted to juice and processed sugars
[59:45] and different things
[59:47] and diseases like obesity and all these
[59:50] things
[59:51] these are going to happen overnight you
[59:54] don't drink one sort of drink and
[59:55] suddenly
[59:56] you obese it doesn't happen it's a
[59:58] process
[1:00:00] it is a process you drink a coke every
[1:00:03] single day
[1:00:03] there's an effect of that and then
[1:00:06] people want to
[1:00:08] lose it in five days
[1:00:11] and it took five years to reach there
[1:00:16] and then you have these phenomenal
[1:00:17] programs lose it in ten days lose it in
[1:00:19] five days
[1:00:20] intensities and mathematically
[1:00:23] it doesn't make sense because it was one
[1:00:26] plus one plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1
[1:00:29] plus 1 plus 1
[1:00:30] plus 1 plus 1 plus 2 plus 5 plus 3 soft
[1:00:33] drinks a day and
[1:00:39] and your spiritual maturity is worn by
[1:00:43] simple victories every single day
[1:00:49] the question was asked to the prophet
[1:00:51] how do you grow
[1:00:54] how do you grow as a christian
[1:00:58] and the answer has always been very
[1:01:00] simple read your bible
[1:01:02] and pray every day we just sing it in
[1:01:05] sunday school
[1:01:07] and that's why i said youth oriented
[1:01:09] service is not just for young people
[1:01:11] because we have caught on cold calebs
[1:01:15] who have stopped growing because they no
[1:01:18] longer read their bibles
[1:01:20] and pray every day
[1:01:23] they have they have graduated seemingly
[1:01:28] when god told joshua meditate on the
[1:01:31] word day and night
[1:01:33] so you will have good success
[1:01:36] and you want to know why you're
[1:01:37] struggling and why
[1:01:39] things not working out and why you can't
[1:01:42] get a financial breakthrough
[1:01:43] and why life is so high and why you're
[1:01:46] stronger than god is just saying i'm
[1:01:47] just waiting
[1:01:48] i'm just waiting because the word
[1:01:51] teaches god never leaves us
[1:01:53] we are the ones who leave him and but
[1:01:56] ibrahim said if you ever want to get
[1:01:57] back to god
[1:01:59] walk right back to the place where you
[1:02:00] left him he'll be standing right there
[1:02:03] because he it's not his nature to leave
[1:02:05] you
[1:02:09] it is nature to follow us this is why
[1:02:11] remember the branham spoke of when adam
[1:02:13] fell he said it wasn't adam went looking
[1:02:15] for god
[1:02:16] it was god went looking for adam adam
[1:02:18] adam i'm used to fellowshipping where
[1:02:20] are you
[1:02:21] where are you adam and adam was out of
[1:02:24] his position it's god's nature to come
[1:02:26] after us
[1:02:27] it is god's nature to reconcile with us
[1:02:30] and that's why brother branham said god
[1:02:32] wants to give you the holy ghost
[1:02:35] more than you even want to receive it
[1:02:39] god doesn't want to withhold the holy
[1:02:41] ghost from us he wants to give it to us
[1:02:43] the prophet said more than we even want
[1:02:45] to receive it
[1:02:47] but friends a holy god
[1:02:52] cannot come and live where there is
[1:02:54] darkness
[1:02:55] [Music]
[1:02:56] and but ibrahim said it like this he
[1:02:58] said before god could fill you
[1:03:00] you have to empty yourself
[1:03:03] and for some of us it's some of us are
[1:03:06] so spiritual we are full up of our own
[1:03:08] spiritual self
[1:03:10] so there are different things we need to
[1:03:11] empty out of today there are those who
[1:03:13] have to empty out sin
[1:03:15] and the world and that's why sometimes
[1:03:17] and that's why brother braham said there
[1:03:18] were people who would come to these
[1:03:19] meetings
[1:03:20] sinners prostitute on the street and get
[1:03:22] healed because they didn't have no
[1:03:24] preconception they were not
[1:03:27] fact-checking and they were not no they
[1:03:28] just came in humble sincere they
[1:03:30] believed and they were healed
[1:03:32] and people who sat in church for years
[1:03:34] they would fill up of themselves
[1:03:36] you know how many scriptures are you
[1:03:37] know how many books i've read
[1:03:40] how many old les pray meeting i've been
[1:03:42] in and they feel to realize
[1:03:44] that god is still a simple god who is
[1:03:47] looking for
[1:03:47] surrender and faith from individuals who
[1:03:51] are sold out
[1:03:54] so some of us we have to empty out of
[1:03:55] our pride
[1:03:57] lost whatever it is our own way our own
[1:04:00] eyes some of us
[1:04:00] empty out our good self i'm always in
[1:04:04] church
[1:04:06] never miss a service if you're not
[1:04:08] seeing me here by 90 day
[1:04:09] something wrong the road broke
[1:04:16] and the gap was so big i couldn't jump
[1:04:18] over because it was just a simple break
[1:04:19] i would have jumped over and still be
[1:04:20] here for nine today
[1:04:23] good self but god is not measuring
[1:04:27] people on
[1:04:28] works and on your effort
[1:04:32] lest that you boast that is you
[1:04:35] because he wants all the glory
[1:04:39] at the end of the day said the heston
[1:04:40] will come with shelton's crying grace
[1:04:43] grace grace grace because we are all
[1:04:46] fearless to begin with
[1:04:49] we all meet there's nobody here but i'm
[1:04:50] not better than anybody
[1:04:52] i'm the worst one i want to be worst
[1:04:54] place
[1:04:59] i don't want to be better than anybody
[1:05:00] else because i know is the grace of god
[1:05:03] to my life
[1:05:07] if he didn't pick me up until my life
[1:05:10] were wrong i don't know where i'd be
[1:05:13] i could get no credit for what you see
[1:05:16] here this morning
[1:05:17] it's the grace of god and that is what
[1:05:21] every testimony should be is the grace
[1:05:24] of almighty god i was
[1:05:26] lost i was a sinner i was no good
[1:05:30] but god rich in grace and mercy
[1:05:33] pick me up turn me around
[1:05:36] sent a prophet with a message that i
[1:05:39] wouldn't be a pentecostal or just
[1:05:40] religious but tell me there's a wave
[1:05:42] back
[1:05:42] our way back to eden our way back to we
[1:05:45] shall reign on the earth
[1:05:46] our way back to spoken word our way back
[1:05:49] to the original seed
[1:05:50] that's what this prophet's brought oh we
[1:05:52] ought to be rejoicing
[1:05:53] oh we ought to be so happy all we ought
[1:05:56] to be so grateful
[1:05:58] [Applause]
[1:06:01] and i'll say it again friends this is
[1:06:03] not about rules
[1:06:05] in that same message things that are to
[1:06:07] be our homework
[1:06:09] but the brandon was saying when he
[1:06:11] leaves his house to go on the field
[1:06:13] he doesn't turn his wife and say
[1:06:16] while i'm gone don't have any other
[1:06:18] husband
[1:06:20] anybody listen to anybody remember that
[1:06:22] part of red hair
[1:06:23] i said she doesn't say bill while you're
[1:06:25] gone don't have an inner wife
[1:06:28] i remember the brandon goes on to say
[1:06:29] but what if something happens in the
[1:06:31] field you say
[1:06:32] i'll come back and look at those
[1:06:33] wrinkles and those gray hair and say
[1:06:36] would you forgive me he said but as he
[1:06:38] looks at her
[1:06:39] he said it'll hurt him so much he'd
[1:06:41] rather die
[1:06:42] than have to even do that so because of
[1:06:45] his
[1:06:46] love for her he will never want to do
[1:06:49] anything to hurt her and that's what
[1:06:52] real love is
[1:06:53] listen it for yourself that's your
[1:06:54] homework things that ought to be that's
[1:06:56] your message
[1:06:58] and i say to young people all the time
[1:07:00] but these churches have real rules
[1:07:02] that's what they say a real rule you
[1:07:03] can't do this you can't do that you
[1:07:05] can't do that you can't do this you
[1:07:07] don't do this
[1:07:13] and i say it's not about rules it's
[1:07:14] about love
[1:07:19] because if you love god then it would be
[1:07:22] in your nature
[1:07:24] to only do things to please him
[1:07:28] then all of a sudden it's no longer
[1:07:30] rules
[1:07:31] it's he doesn't like this he likes this
[1:07:34] he doesn't like this he likes us
[1:07:36] and then all of a sudden your life
[1:07:37] becomes easy
[1:07:39] so as a christian sister he likes it and
[1:07:41] my hair is combed out
[1:07:43] why would i want to cut it he doesn't
[1:07:44] like it with his gut
[1:07:46] awesome
[1:07:50] he likes it when i dress modestly that's
[1:07:52] what i'm his queen
[1:07:56] it's love i said to the church some time
[1:07:59] ago
[1:08:02] my wife likes white's clothes in one
[1:08:04] side
[1:08:05] colors on the next side telly brothers
[1:08:09] real rules in my house now have to put
[1:08:11] the white clothes in one corner
[1:08:13] put the colors in the next corner but
[1:08:16] because i love her
[1:08:17] after finding a way to put the white
[1:08:18] clothes here and put the colors here
[1:08:21] because it's easier to wash but that's
[1:08:23] what love does
[1:08:25] your behavior you adjust your behavior
[1:08:27] when you're in love
[1:08:29] [Applause]
[1:08:33] i remember one time she made a sandwich
[1:08:36] and she toasted the bread and she
[1:08:37] thought
[1:08:38] that she was doing a good job of
[1:08:40] twisting the bread with tuna
[1:08:42] and i say listen i don't like the bread
[1:08:45] toasted with tuna
[1:08:48] leave the bread without toasting it now
[1:08:50] when she toasted that she thought it was
[1:08:53] the best thing to do you know she didn't
[1:08:54] toast it to get me upset
[1:08:56] but she thought i would have wanted but
[1:08:57] she didn't know
[1:09:00] so within this christian journey there
[1:09:01] are things that you may do that you
[1:09:02] don't know
[1:09:03] if it working just yet but that's what
[1:09:05] the word comes for
[1:09:06] i don't want that toasted i don't want
[1:09:08] to just adjust a little bit just just
[1:09:10] and the holy spirit is your guide he
[1:09:11] will guide you along this journey
[1:09:14] and as you get deeper and deeper in love
[1:09:17] you begin to become one so you see
[1:09:20] certain couples
[1:09:22] yes they move the eye they know what to
[1:09:23] do without words being said
[1:09:28] without words no communication but it's
[1:09:31] a connection
[1:09:33] and you read there were men a few words
[1:09:35] they only spoke when he wanted them to
[1:09:37] speak
[1:09:38] but it brought them with one nod
[1:09:41] they know what to do is this same thing
[1:09:43] we're preaching about that's that's the
[1:09:44] message
[1:09:45] with one nod you know what god saying to
[1:09:47] do because you are so connected
[1:09:49] you are the same wavelength his words
[1:09:52] your words his thoughts
[1:09:53] your thoughts his behavior your behavior
[1:09:55] his nature your nature his being your
[1:09:58] being his attributes you are
[1:10:00] what are you flesh of my flesh bone of
[1:10:03] my bone
[1:10:04] spirit of my spirit bride and groom
[1:10:07] husband and wife mrs jesus christ and
[1:10:09] the lord jesus christ
[1:10:11] bride of jesus christ can the church say
[1:10:14] amen
[1:10:18] but that type of relationship with god
[1:10:21] cannot be intellectual
[1:10:24] it has to be hard it has to be the same
[1:10:28] spirit
[1:10:29] it cannot be your spirit that's why the
[1:10:32] bible says
[1:10:32] i'll give you a new heart i'll give you
[1:10:35] a new spirit
[1:10:36] and then i'll put my spirit in there
[1:10:41] because when you have his spirit now you
[1:10:44] could communicate
[1:10:46] now you can relate now you can talk the
[1:10:48] same language don't you want to talk the
[1:10:50] same language with him
[1:10:52] don't you want to become a deeper
[1:10:53] christian with him
[1:10:57] how many love him this morning
[1:11:02] wonderful
[1:11:07] so i'm going to assume that if you love
[1:11:09] him
[1:11:10] you will want to do things to please him
[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:14] so how many people this morning want to
[1:11:16] do everything to please him
[1:11:28] because there are many people who say
[1:11:29] they love him you know i mean because
[1:11:30] the people
[1:11:31] watch them they're declaring it from the
[1:11:34] car
[1:11:35] i love jesus written on the windscreen
[1:11:39] but their behavior and their action and
[1:11:41] you know love is
[1:11:43] an action word so if you love
[1:11:46] god then your actions should indicate
[1:11:48] that you love god
[1:11:49] so if you love god then i shouldn't see
[1:11:53] you dressing in a way that would not
[1:11:55] please him
[1:11:56] i shouldn't see you having conversations
[1:11:58] about what wouldn't please him
[1:12:00] i shouldn't see you putting stuff on
[1:12:02] facebook in a way that
[1:12:04] if i could see it imagine him because
[1:12:05] he's seen we're doing in secret if i see
[1:12:07] what you're doing and they're wrong
[1:12:08] father's for him and he's here in secret
[1:12:12] and some of you say you love him and
[1:12:14] he's doing it in public
[1:12:18] how could you have a testimony that you
[1:12:21] love jesus
[1:12:22] and you will do stuff to hurt him
[1:12:25] when the bible says christians like
[1:12:27] grieve not the holy spirit
[1:12:30] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[1:12:32] your redemption greed means the hurt
[1:12:35] many of us heard the holy spirit with
[1:12:38] how we speak
[1:12:39] how we act we spoke about it many many
[1:12:42] times how the holy ghost like
[1:12:43] of comes to the lamb
[1:12:49] dove wouldn't come to the wolf and i
[1:12:52] heard a preacher's analogy very simple
[1:12:53] analogy to how
[1:12:54] sensitive the dove is he said think of a
[1:12:56] butterfly
[1:12:58] when a butterfly comes it will land and
[1:13:01] if you
[1:13:01] if you act irrationally or it will fly
[1:13:04] away
[1:13:05] but we have to attract the holy spirit
[1:13:08] to our lives
[1:13:09] i'm giving you guidelines and tips and
[1:13:12] encouragements
[1:13:14] for those of you who want to get the
[1:13:15] holy ghost those who really want to
[1:13:17] but ibraheem said when you want to get a
[1:13:18] hold of this what you do spend time with
[1:13:20] people
[1:13:22] who have the holy ghost who are your
[1:13:24] friends
[1:13:25] who is your advisors who are who who
[1:13:29] leading you why are you leading anybody
[1:13:30] or you're just there drifting around
[1:13:37] do you want to change or do you want
[1:13:42] i said it last sunday i said that island
[1:13:44] of baby it still troubles me
[1:13:46] because sometimes you know even though
[1:13:48] you know something going to happen i
[1:13:49] just think
[1:13:50] they said in 300 years it's the first
[1:13:52] time
[1:13:53] in 300 years that the island of barbuda
[1:13:57] is
[1:13:58] uninhabitable on there no humans
[1:14:01] in 300 years i said my wife we're in
[1:14:03] 2017
[1:14:04] that's 1917 18 17 17 17
[1:14:08] 300 years there are no humans there
[1:14:12] a month before that people were living
[1:14:15] life as
[1:14:15] normal had no idea
[1:14:18] that a month later their houses would be
[1:14:21] flat
[1:14:22] schooled flat airport flat
[1:14:25] no idea living life as it were in the
[1:14:28] days of nowhere they ate they drank they
[1:14:29] gave it to marriage
[1:14:31] until the day that noah went to the
[1:14:33] heart and god shut the door
[1:14:35] they had no idea and by the brandon
[1:14:38] preachers say one day the last song will

[1:15:32] supposed to be what the ultra wealthy
[1:15:34] believe they could go into in natural
[1:15:36] disasters

[1:15:48] something

[1:15:51] goes deep down into the earth so in case
[1:15:53] there's nuclear
[1:15:54] distress you could go down there only
[1:15:56] rich people and bright people whose was
[1:15:57] a continuous civilization
[1:15:59] they don't know where they want to
[1:16:00] continue civilization
[1:16:02] and i don't need a degree in
[1:16:04] aerodynamics or physics to continue
[1:16:06] it's just because i was born to continue
[1:16:07] i will be continuing because we shall
[1:16:09] reign on the earth i don't care how much

[1:16:21] three million five million us
[1:16:23] to go into this capsule to roll around
[1:16:29] when one of these days better punch
[1:16:31] these 16 elements will
[1:16:32] change brother branham said the rapture
[1:16:36] is a revelation it will go from outside
[1:16:37] it will go from inside to out
[1:16:40] one of these days what you have been
[1:16:41] hearing will come alive in your soul and
[1:16:44] all of us are transformational a switch
[1:16:46] will be hit
[1:16:47] and these 16 elements will begin to
[1:16:49] chain them in a quicken of an eye
[1:16:51] between
[1:16:51] six and nine we shall be going home
[1:16:54] [Applause]
[1:16:56] and when we leave here it's temporary
[1:17:00] because we gotta come back because we
[1:17:02] shall reign on the earth
[1:17:03] [Applause]
[1:17:06] the whole creation waiting for the
[1:17:08] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:13] and friends the rapture is not supposed
[1:17:15] to be you know the people that cow
[1:17:17] they can't wait for their after they
[1:17:18] just want to escape does not escape
[1:17:20] it's about we being taken away for god
[1:17:22] to bring judgment
[1:17:25] we're not trying to escape because we're
[1:17:26] scared no we're not scared
[1:17:28] the bible said for he isn't giving us
[1:17:30] the spirit of fear
[1:17:31] that's the bible what are you afraid of
[1:17:35] but he's given a spirit of adoption
[1:17:38] whereby we cry our father
[1:17:40] fear is not in our vocabulary in fact
[1:17:43] many times you just spoke his two words
[1:17:45] fear not
[1:17:46] i think about 66 or sometimes he said
[1:17:48] fear not
[1:17:49] be not afraid it is i fear not fear not
[1:17:52] fear not fear not stop being afraid
[1:17:56] you are just like him we are joint heirs
[1:17:59] with christ
[1:18:00] the trees know who you are that's why
[1:18:02] they are groaning and travailing
[1:18:04] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:18:06] when
[1:18:07] born sons filled sons will suddenly wake
[1:18:09] up and speak
[1:18:10] and what they say will be created
[1:18:12] somebody's saying man
[1:18:16] so who's ready to press past themselves
[1:18:20] this morning
[1:18:21] who's ready to claim their individual
[1:18:24] inheritance
[1:18:25] who's ready to say lord i want to serve
[1:18:28] you with everything
[1:18:29] my all my heart my life
[1:18:34] can we give the lord a hand of praise
[1:18:37] the musician can get ready i'm almost
[1:18:39] done
[1:18:39] [Music]
[1:18:43] but friends what we have this morning
[1:18:46] will not exist
[1:18:48] all the time one day there will be a
[1:18:52] last service
[1:18:53] only there will be a last meeting and
[1:18:56] while there's still
[1:18:56] blood and there's still grace every
[1:19:00] service is a burden in our heart to see
[1:19:02] you get closer to christ then closer to
[1:19:03] the church
[1:19:04] closer to christ to be like jesus that's
[1:19:07] our prayer to be like jesus
[1:19:10] to be like him to press past ourselves
[1:19:13] and to
[1:19:13] get that that eternal life
[1:19:17] in our souls you can begin to play
[1:19:20] something softly
[1:19:24] we read the scripture there'll be two
[1:19:27] in the field one taken one left i know
[1:19:30] you've heard it before
[1:19:33] but the issues of life sometimes makes
[1:19:36] us forget how serious this thing is
[1:19:38] there'll be two in a bed there'll be two
[1:19:39] in a field one taken one left
[1:19:42] it's not to the group it's the
[1:19:48] individuals
[1:19:53] i don't believe in my heart that there's
[1:19:54] anybody here today who wants to be left
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:20:02] i don't believe in my heart in the days
[1:20:03] of moses
[1:20:05] when he told him to put blood on the
[1:20:06] door that there were people who say i
[1:20:08] want to die
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:13] so the question is not if you want to go
[1:20:15] the question is how much you really want
[1:20:17] to go
[1:20:19] because we have a requirement to meet
[1:20:23] the preacher didn't make the requirement
[1:20:24] the passage major requirement god
[1:20:26] himself set the requirement
[1:20:28] he said when i see the blood i'll pass
[1:20:31] over you
[1:20:35] you have to be willing to give it all up
[1:20:38] [Music]
[1:20:39] and say lord i surrender
[1:20:42] you have to be willing to say lord i
[1:20:45] recognize i'm no good
[1:20:47] i'm no good
[1:20:48] [Music]
[1:20:52] lord i need deliverance lord i
[1:20:56] my prayer life is not what it's supposed
[1:20:57] to be i'm no good
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:04] lord i need the holy ghost i'm no good
[1:21:07] lord i need a touch i'm no good
[1:21:11] lord i need an experience i'm no good
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:15] lord my heart i need a new heart
[1:21:20] i need a new spirit i need your spirit
[1:21:24] i don't want to go on living this way
[1:21:28] i shared it on the communion service
[1:21:32] i said the rich young ruler he came with
[1:21:36] a desire
[1:21:40] he said master what can i do to
[1:21:43] inherit eternal life
[1:21:47] and brother branham said you could never
[1:21:49] come to the presence of the
[1:21:51] god and and leave the same he said you
[1:21:54] will either leave better
[1:21:56] or you will leave worse friends
[1:22:01] this man stood before jesus and jesus
[1:22:05] responded he said
[1:22:06] obey your commandments obey your mother
[1:22:09] and your father
[1:22:10] and all the commandments and this young
[1:22:12] man he responded and that
[1:22:14] i guess he would have felt good he said
[1:22:16] master
[1:22:17] i've done all of this from my youth
[1:22:20] [Music]
[1:22:21] what lack i get and jesus discerned his
[1:22:25] heart
[1:22:26] as his discerning hearts this morning
[1:22:28] through the word
[1:22:30] he told that young man he said go sell
[1:22:32] all that you have
[1:22:34] and give to the poor
[1:22:35] [Music]
[1:22:37] and the bible says when that boy heard
[1:22:39] that
[1:22:41] he turned away and he left sorrowful
[1:22:45] and that peened me
[1:22:47] [Music]
[1:22:49] why would you come to jesus and leave
[1:22:51] disappointed
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:22:54] why would you come to jesus and leave
[1:22:56] sorrowful
[1:22:58] when he could answer every prayer when
[1:23:01] he could meet
[1:23:02] every need but that young man was not
[1:23:04] willing to give up
[1:23:06] what he held dear to him and that's why
[1:23:10] he left sorrowful
[1:23:12] friends every one of us me included we
[1:23:14] have something to give up this morning
