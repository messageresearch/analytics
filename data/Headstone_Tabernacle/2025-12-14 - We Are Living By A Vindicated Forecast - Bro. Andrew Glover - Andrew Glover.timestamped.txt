[23:23] Let the redeem of the Lord say so, whom
[23:26] he had redeemed from the hand of the
[23:28] enemy, and gathered them out of the
[23:31] lands from the east and from the west,
[23:34] from the north and from the south. They
[23:37] wandered in the wilderness in a solitary
[23:39] way, they found no city to dwell in.
[23:42] Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted
[23:44] in them. Then they cried unto the Lord
[23:47] in their trouble, and he delivered them
[23:50] out of their distresses, and he led them
[23:53] forth by the right way, that they might
[23:56] go to a city of habitation. Oh, that men
[23:59] would praise the Lord for his goodness,
[24:03] and for his wondrous
[24:05] works to the children of men, for he
[24:08] satisfied the longing soul, and he
[24:11] fillth [music] the hungry soul with
[24:13] goodness. Amen. Not just words, but with

[44:11] [music]

[44:18] in my name.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; [music]
[44:22] &gt;&gt; There's no time left [singing] now for
[44:26] crying.

[45:17] &gt;&gt; You are equipped to [singing] fight the
[45:20] battle.
[45:22] Even [music] though it is the Lord.
[45:27] Praise the mighty weapon
[45:30] the weakest Christian
[45:32] [music and singing] can take on.
[45:36] Prayer makes the demons [music] tremble,
[45:38] [singing]
[45:39] but it put God in control.
[45:43] [music]
[45:46] And little by little, [singing]
[45:49] you'll gain the victory. [music]
[45:55] Little by little,
[45:57] you can win [music]
[46:00] every battle.
[46:02] Sing with me. [music]
[46:04] Little by [singing] little
[46:06] you can conquer
[46:08] every [music and singing]
[46:14] wondering

[46:19] sea to sea. [music and singing]
[46:21] Unless
[46:24] you gain [music and singing] the
[46:26] victory.
[46:28] I want to sing this. I don't want the
[46:30] last. You [music] are truly
[46:34] truly been commissioned

[46:53] [music and singing] even though it is
[46:56] the Lord's.
[46:58] Pray [singing] is a mighty weapon.
[47:01] [music]
[47:02] The weake as Christians [singing] can
[47:05] take hold.
[47:08] Pray makes the demons
[47:09] [singing and music] tremble.
[47:11] But it put God in control.
[47:16] [music]
[47:17] And little little
[47:20] we've gained the victory. [singing] Hear

[1:01:29] Let's give a lot of praise.
[1:01:32] [music]
[1:01:41] Let's bow here a word of prayer.
[1:01:44] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[1:01:45] presence, Lord. We are so grateful to be
[1:01:48] here this morning. We are humbled by
[1:01:50] your grace, by the extension of your
[1:01:53] mercy to our lives that you could give
[1:01:55] us access to your presence. [music]
[1:01:57] Bless your people this morning. Bless
[1:01:58] the ministers, the pastors and all the
[1:02:00] churches here. You build people, Father.
[1:02:03] God bless your service as you come to
[1:02:04] minister your word and we look forward
[1:02:06] Lord for you to speak to our hearts. We
[1:02:08] need to hear from you. We wait to hear
[1:02:12] from you father.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Oh God we come under expectation Lord
[1:02:15] looking for the spirit to speak [music]
[1:02:17] expressly
[1:02:19] thus say the Lord. Grant it father in
[1:02:21] Jesus name I ask it. You have your seat.
[1:02:28] God bless you and welcome.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:02:35] [applause]
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; We can't take this for granted, you
[1:02:39] know. We can't take this presence for
[1:02:41] granted.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; It's a [music] powerful thing. But Ram
[1:02:44] said, he said one day the spirit will be
[1:02:46] leave the earth
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; and the people would even miss it
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; because they never know what it was.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; It's why if you it was death to go into
[1:02:56] presence in the Old Testament. Now it's
[1:02:57] the death to be outside of his presence.
[1:03:00] So that is where we belong in his
[1:03:02] presence. [music]
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So God bless you
[1:03:05] with him. So we want to bring greetings
[1:03:08] to brother Norris [music] and his wife
[1:03:09] and the whole Christian Assembly that's
[1:03:10] here this morning. God bless you brother
[1:03:11] Norris. [applause] Praise God. And
[1:03:13] brother Harry is also here.
[1:03:16] Uh brother Andrew Lu is he. Brother
[1:03:19] Andrew. Maybe he's not here as yet. But
[1:03:21] Andrew, Pastor Andrew. But we thank you
[1:03:22] all for being here. Any other minister
[1:03:25] we say God bless [music] you and
[1:03:26] welcome. Praise God. Amen. So, we
[1:03:31] certainly appreciated the service last
[1:03:32] night.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; It [applause] was awesome.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Now, we know there's no moving faculty
[1:03:40] past the eye.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; But the brand was the seer. Next is the
[1:03:45] intelligence.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; And that is what dropped down last
[1:03:48] night.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; The intelligence of God by the word of
[1:03:52] God.
[1:03:54] Speaking about the will of God. This is
[1:03:56] not talking about Ukraine and Russia and
[1:03:57] the Pope
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; and who the islands surround you with
[1:04:00] American forces and so on. We're not
[1:04:02] talking about that.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; This is you and your life.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; This is you and your walk.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; This is you and your thoughts and your
[1:04:09] ideas.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; There is Okay. So, the will of God, not
[1:04:13] just knowing of it, the knowledge of it,
[1:04:15] but the doing of it.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; So, last night was thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; You should go back and listen to that
[1:04:22] message. You realize that if we include
[1:04:25] or embrace this seeking the will of God,
[1:04:28] it will change where you go,
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; what you do,
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; how you think,
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; what you say,
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; and how you react.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Your friends will change immediately
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; if you ask God, is this your will?
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes the devil hide behind
[1:04:46] friendship and family and other things
[1:04:49] to try to get you off that path.
[1:04:50] Remember you have to stay focused.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Remember you have to stay the course.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; So this uh uh thing about uh the will of
[1:05:02] God have to be incorporated into our
[1:05:04] daily living,
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; our daily walk with the Lord. So now we
[1:05:08] could understand why some people don't
[1:05:10] bring thing to the ministry. Why some
[1:05:11] people don't take advice or want counsel
[1:05:13] because they want God to bless their own
[1:05:15] thoughts
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; because they're afraid if they come
[1:05:19] something different will be said to
[1:05:20] them.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; And not to prepare to give up, let go
[1:05:23] and abandon what they need to abandon.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So we're going to bring on
[1:05:29] the speaker now. I want to read a
[1:05:31] scripture. You sit down. Uh this one
[1:05:33] Samuel chapter 17:45-51.
[1:05:35] And then said David to the Philistines,
[1:05:37] "Thou comest to me with a sword,
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; and with a spear, and with a shield, but
[1:05:43] I come to thee in the name of the Lord
[1:05:45] of hosts,
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; the God of the armies of Israel, whom
[1:05:49] thou hast defied."
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; So he was seeing a spirit that define
[1:05:53] the God of Israel.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; This day will the Lord deliver thee into
[1:05:56] mine hand, and I will smite thee, and
[1:05:59] take thy head from thee. I will give the
[1:06:02] carcasses of the host of the Philistine
[1:06:04] this day unto the fowls of the air and
[1:06:06] to the wild beasts of the earth and all
[1:06:08] the earthmen know that there is a God in
[1:06:10] Israel. There's a God in this message,
[1:06:13] the God of Malachi 4th live.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When anointing struck
[1:06:19] Elijah, Elisha, he said, "Where is the
[1:06:21] Lord God of Elijah?" The anointing
[1:06:24] wasn't in the court. It was in that God
[1:06:25] that promised all these things. It came
[1:06:28] to pass when the Philistine arose and
[1:06:29] came and drew nine to meet David that
[1:06:31] David hasted and ran towards the army to
[1:06:34] meet the Philistine. He wasn't walking.
[1:06:36] He was running because he had a rock. He
[1:06:38] had a revelation. Isn't that right? And
[1:06:40] David put his hand in his back, took a
[1:06:42] dense stone, and slung it and smoked the
[1:06:44] Philistine in his forehead. And that
[1:06:46] stone sunk into his forehead, and he
[1:06:48] fell upon his face to the earth. So
[1:06:50] David prevailed over the Philistine with
[1:06:52] a sling with a stone and smoked the
[1:06:54] Philistine and slew him. And there was
[1:06:56] no sword in the hand of David.
[1:06:58] Therefore, David ran and took out upon
[1:07:00] the Philistine and took the sword, his
[1:07:02] sword, same message they have, same
[1:07:04] books and tapes they have, same word
[1:07:06] that they preaching with, same his
[1:07:07] sword, and take it. What? What David did
[1:07:09] with it? He said, and drew it out of the
[1:07:11] sheet thereof and slew him, cut off his
[1:07:13] head therewith. And when the Philistines
[1:07:15] saw the champion was dead, they fled.
[1:07:19] Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; That's the That's the scripture I have
[1:07:22] for you this morning.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; But here what the prophet said now. Many
[1:07:25] meetings, many, many ministers come to
[1:07:27] me and confess that they believe that
[1:07:29] the name of Jesus is right to be
[1:07:30] baptized, but our organization would put
[1:07:33] us out.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; You poor excuse.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Take Saul's armor off.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; That is what the matter today. God has
[1:07:42] got a lot of sheep that gone astray.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; The organization and things have stole
[1:07:46] them out and brought them into
[1:07:47] psychology. God. He had a prophecy. Give
[1:07:50] us David's
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; with the word of God and the power of
[1:07:54] God to direct it when we go to meet
[1:07:57] these intellectual giants.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Whatever it might be, give us the word
[1:08:02] of God and the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:04] I tell you, we can slay every giant on
[1:08:07] the field.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; So, the giants is is is making their
[1:08:10] wrongs. The giants are making their
[1:08:12] wrongs and on the field. But God
[1:08:14] promised he going to have some anointed
[1:08:16] Davids that going to take that sling and
[1:08:19] sling it out there. Men who are not
[1:08:21] afraid. Men who have met the pillar of
[1:08:23] fire. Men who know their God.
[1:08:25] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[1:08:28] Lord. Oh, there's a little more. He said
[1:08:31] we need, he said, we know we need a
[1:08:33] revival. We know we need a stirring
[1:08:35] amongst the people. It will not take a
[1:08:37] duct of divinity. It will take a
[1:08:39] weakling. that will take the word of God
[1:08:41] and the power of the resurrection of
[1:08:43] Christ and slay this thing. It will
[1:08:46] bring Christ to the country. It will let
[1:08:48] them see. He can still open the eyes of
[1:08:49] the blind. He can still heal the sick.
[1:08:52] He can still raise the dead. He's a
[1:08:54] conqueror. We need a David untrained in
[1:08:57] theological schools. We need a man who
[1:09:00] knows nothing about that. Some little
[1:09:02] plow boy somewhere, some little guy,
[1:09:04] some little stoers, not much to look at,
[1:09:07] will come walking down the road with the
[1:09:08] power of God that is from perfect
[1:09:11] strength by perfect weakness. Could we
[1:09:12] stand and give the Lord a shout of
[1:09:14] praise as the man of God come to the
[1:09:16] pulpit to preach [music] to you the
[1:09:18] unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:20] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's sing that
[1:09:23] song. In his presence,
[1:09:27] [music and singing]
[1:09:29] that's where I strong.
[1:09:33] In [music]
[1:09:33] this [singing] presence,
[1:09:38] oh Lord [singing] my God, [music]
[1:09:41] in this hallelujah presence
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; in your presence, [music and singing]
[1:10:04] oh God.
[1:10:07] It's in [music] your presence,
[1:10:12] oh [singing] God.
[1:10:16] Amen. How many believes we're in his
[1:10:18] presence [music] this morning?
[1:10:20] Amen. I'm thankful today to be alive and
[1:10:23] well and to know that we've not missed
[1:10:26] the presence of God. The presence of God
[1:10:29] has not gone unrecognized.
[1:10:31] But we have recognized his presence.
[1:10:33] [music] And you that listen to the
[1:10:35] prophet of God, you know, he said that
[1:10:37] when his presence is not recognized,
[1:10:39] [music] his power is not released. He
[1:10:42] said, "But when you recognize his
[1:10:44] presence, then you release his power."
[1:10:46] And I believe that's why the power of
[1:10:48] God is flowing here today is because
[1:10:50] someone has recognized that this is not
[1:10:52] a man. It's not just another [music]
[1:10:54] message, but it's the return of the
[1:10:56] presence of Jesus Christ vindicated by
[1:10:58] the Bible. Amen. We are in his presence
[1:11:01] today with a promise. Amen. We [music]
[1:11:03] want to say God bless you all this
[1:11:05] morning. How many is happy to be in the
[1:11:07] house of God today? Amen. Amen. We thank
[1:11:11] the Lord. Amen. For his divine mercy and
[1:11:14] grace. We want to greet you all in the
[1:11:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We count
[1:11:18] it such an honor and a privilege to be
[1:11:20] uh here today with the bride of Jesus
[1:11:22] Christ in this part of the world. And we
[1:11:24] want to thank uh brother Theo, the
[1:11:26] pastor here for this invitation, the
[1:11:28] opportunity to be here, brother Isaac
[1:11:30] for inviting us and being here as well.
[1:11:32] And uh we just thank the Lord that he's
[1:11:34] given us an opportunity to declare the
[1:11:36] message of the hour. And amen. We want
[1:11:38] to bring you greetings again from our
[1:11:40] pastor, our church there at home, Grace
[1:11:42] Tabernacle in Black Rockck, Arkansas.
[1:11:43] Our pastor, brother Matt Moore, sends
[1:11:46] their greetings to you all. And so we
[1:11:47] want to be sure and do that this
[1:11:49] morning. And Amen. It is a real honor
[1:11:51] for me to be here in in Trinidad for the
[1:11:53] first time. I was sharing with brother
[1:11:55] um Isaac when we arrived that years ago
[1:11:58] when I I first started ministering. I
[1:12:00] gave my heart to the Lord when I was 9
[1:12:02] years old and was baptized and filled
[1:12:04] with the Holy Spirit and began
[1:12:05] ministering when I was 13 years old. And
[1:12:08] when I began traveling around uh well, I
[1:12:10] started traveling some when I was 13. uh
[1:12:13] you know people taking us different
[1:12:15] places but when I was around 161 17 the
[1:12:17] Lord um just one day put Trinidad on my
[1:12:20] heart and I began to talk to a brother
[1:12:22] who had been here many years ago and he
[1:12:24] said yeah there's ministers and churches
[1:12:27] there and and uh I said well if it's the
[1:12:29] Lord's will he'll open the door one day
[1:12:30] and we'll go and that was several years
[1:12:32] ago and the Lord has opened the door for
[1:12:34] us to come here this weekend and we
[1:12:36] thank you brothers for that God richly
[1:12:38] bless you amen we pray that we can just
[1:12:41] be a small blessing to you here this
[1:12:43] weekend. And amen. I I know it's Sunday
[1:12:45] morning and it's a wonderful day to
[1:12:47] serve the Lord. And maybe before we open
[1:12:49] the Bible, we could just bow our hearts
[1:12:50] for a word of prayer today. And we'll
[1:12:52] just ask the Lord to come and speak to
[1:12:55] us today by his word. How many would
[1:12:57] just say, Lord, speak to me by your word
[1:12:59] today. Heavenly Father, Lord, we have
[1:13:02] gathered here this morning under great
[1:13:04] anticipation of your presence. Father,
[1:13:06] we've not gathered here to be seen or to
[1:13:09] be heard. But Father, we've gathered
[1:13:11] here for one thing, and that is to
[1:13:13] worship you. Lord, your word said, "If I
[1:13:15] be lifted up, I will draw all men unto
[1:13:18] myself." And Father, Lord, we've not
[1:13:21] come here today to lift ourselves up or
[1:13:23] to lift a church up. But Lord, we've
[1:13:25] come here to lift you up, Lord. Father,
[1:13:28] I pray that you would come among us
[1:13:29] today in a special way. Father, may your
[1:13:32] anointing fill this room, Lord. May you
[1:13:35] drive out every spirit that's unlike the
[1:13:37] Holy Spirit. Father, Lord, may you bring
[1:13:40] a grace upon your people today as your
[1:13:42] word goes forth. Lord, I pray the power
[1:13:45] of the enemy would be bound and broken
[1:13:47] today. Father, I pray that revelation
[1:13:49] would come to hearts and lives here, oh
[1:13:51] God. Lord, I pray maybe there be one
[1:13:54] sick among us today as your word goes
[1:13:56] forth. Father, may healing move into
[1:13:58] that sick body, oh God. Lord, if there
[1:14:01] be one at home listening, unable to be
[1:14:03] here today, I pray you would send the
[1:14:05] angel of God by their home. Father,
[1:14:07] Lord, maybe one in a hospital room or
[1:14:09] Lord, one that has grown cold on you and
[1:14:12] lost their desire to serve you, Father.
[1:14:14] Lord, if if if some way they would hear
[1:14:16] this service, I pray, Lord, that a col
[1:14:18] of fire of revelation would come up off
[1:14:20] the altar, oh God. And Lord, may it
[1:14:23] strike their hearts, Father. I pray that
[1:14:25] you would restore the joy of salvation
[1:14:28] here today. I pray Lord you would
[1:14:30] restore peace and you would restore
[1:14:32] faith oh God. Lord may the power of the
[1:14:34] enemy be broken here today by the
[1:14:36] preaching of your word. Now Father
[1:14:38] forgive us of our failures Lord. Forgive
[1:14:40] us of our shortcomings Lord. We we
[1:14:43] acknowledge and we openly admit we have
[1:14:45] nothing Lord in ourselves oh God. Lord
[1:14:47] to offer this people but you have sent a
[1:14:50] message in this hour. And Lord, if we
[1:14:52] can get ourselves out of the way and say
[1:14:54] what your prophet has already said, then
[1:14:56] Lord, I believe you will come among us
[1:14:58] the same way today as you did then
[1:15:00] because you're the same yesterday,
[1:15:02] today, and forever. And Father, we
[1:15:04] commit this meeting today in thy
[1:15:06] faithful hands. Have thy way among us.
[1:15:08] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[1:15:10] pray. And all the believers says,
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. God bless you this
[1:15:16] morning. If you have your Bibles while
[1:15:18] you're standing with us today, we want
[1:15:20] to go to the book of Job, the 19th
[1:15:22] chapter. The book of Job, the 19th
[1:15:24] chapter.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Job chapter 19, also Proverbs 29 and 1
[1:15:37] Peter. I have a few places I want to
[1:15:39] read this morning. In Job chapter 19 and
[1:15:43] verse 23,
[1:15:46] he says, "Oh, that my words were now
[1:15:48] written, now that they were printed in a
[1:15:51] book, that they were graven with an iron
[1:15:53] pen and led in the rock forever.
[1:15:57] For I know that my redeemer liveth and
[1:16:01] shall and that he shall stand at the
[1:16:04] latter day upon the earth." There is one
[1:16:06] translation of that I love. It says, "I
[1:16:08] know my redeemer or my vindicator
[1:16:11] liveth. And though after my skin worms
[1:16:15] destroy this body, yet in my flesh, this
[1:16:19] is not a hope so guess. Yet in my flesh
[1:16:23] shall I see God,
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes
[1:16:28] shall behold and not another, though my
[1:16:31] reigns be consumed within me." In the
[1:16:35] book of Proverbs the 29th chapter, it's
[1:16:38] a very very familiar scripture. Proverbs
[1:16:40] 29
[1:16:42] and verse number 18. Proverbs 29 and
[1:16:45] verse number 18. Solomon here writing in
[1:16:48] the in the 29th chapter 18th verse. He
[1:16:51] says, "Now where there is no vision, no
[1:16:55] revelation of God and his word. Where
[1:16:58] there is no vision, the people perish,
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; but he that keepeth the law, happy is
[1:17:05] he.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; And one other place I want to look is in
[1:17:07] the New Testament in 1 Peter chapter 1.
[1:17:11] First Peter chapter 1 and verse number
[1:17:14] eight. 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse
[1:17:16] number eight. Uh Peter here writing he
[1:17:18] says, "Whom have you not seen ye love in
[1:17:23] whom though now ye see him not yet
[1:17:25] believing?" How many believes here
[1:17:27] today?
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yet believing ye rejoice. So believing
[1:17:31] is your source for rejoicing. Yet
[1:17:34] believing ye rejoice with joy
[1:17:36] unspeakable and full of glory. Receiving
[1:17:40] the end of your faith, even the
[1:17:43] salvation of your souls. Of which
[1:17:45] salvation? Now watch this. of which
[1:17:48] salvation the prophets have inquired and
[1:17:51] searched diligently who prophesied of
[1:17:54] the grace that should come unto you. Now
[1:17:56] how many knows the prophet of God said
[1:17:58] the bride is a prophetic class of
[1:18:00] people.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; He said the book of revelation is a
[1:18:03] prophetic book. Now here Peter says
[1:18:06] there is a grace that has been
[1:18:07] prophesied. So this is not any kind of
[1:18:10] grace but it's a prophetic grace to a
[1:18:13] prophetic class of people. the grace
[1:18:15] that prophesied. Look here searching
[1:18:17] what or what manner of time the spirit
[1:18:20] of Christ which was in them did signify
[1:18:24] when it testified beforehand the
[1:18:27] sufferings of Christ and the glory that
[1:18:30] should follow unto whom it was revealed
[1:18:34] that not unto themselves but unto us
[1:18:37] they did minister the things which are
[1:18:40] now reported unto you by them that have
[1:18:43] preached the gospel unto you with the
[1:18:46] Holy the Holy Ghost sent down from
[1:18:48] heaven which things the angels desire to
[1:18:52] look into. Now look at verse 13. Now
[1:18:55] wherefore g up the loins of your mind,
[1:18:58] be sober and hope to the end for the
[1:19:01] grace that is to be brought unto you at
[1:19:05] the revelation of Jesus Christ. We ask
[1:19:08] the Lord this morning to bless the
[1:19:10] reading of his word as you can have your
[1:19:12] seat here this morning. If the Lord
[1:19:14] would help me today, if I would take a
[1:19:16] title, I want to talk to you for a few
[1:19:18] moments on this. We are living by a
[1:19:21] vindicated forecast. We are living by a
[1:19:24] vindicated forecast. I I just want to
[1:19:27] share this with you. 1 Peter uh 1:13
[1:19:29] from the Amplified Bible. It says, "So
[1:19:32] prepare your minds for action. Be
[1:19:35] completely sober in spirit, steadfast,
[1:19:38] self-disciplined, spiritually and
[1:19:40] morally alert." Now listen, fix your
[1:19:43] hope completely on the grace of God that
[1:19:47] is coming to you when Jesus Christ is
[1:19:51] revealed. So when Jesus Christ is
[1:19:53] revealed, there is a grace that is
[1:19:56] coming to the church. Amen. To receive
[1:19:59] the revelation that is being come into
[1:20:02] the church. Now I just want to maybe uh
[1:20:04] read a lengthy quote to you for a moment
[1:20:06] to lay a foundation in in the message.
[1:20:08] My redeemer liveth. Brother Re said, "I
[1:20:10] think of Job." He said he he was looking
[1:20:13] forward, amen, to this morning. Job was
[1:20:16] looking forward, amen, to this morning.
[1:20:19] When he was old, he was stricken in age.
[1:20:21] His flesh was simply falling from his
[1:20:24] body from sores. His heart was broken in
[1:20:26] grief. Amen. Now, watch this. Every
[1:20:29] mortal part of his being was withering
[1:20:32] away. Amen. He was at his wits end.
[1:20:35] Everything he had was gone. He said,
[1:20:38] "But then God in his mercy come down to
[1:20:41] Job." Listen. And he give him another
[1:20:45] sense. Amen. That he could open his eyes
[1:20:48] and see the day that he would re a body
[1:20:51] he would receive. Now, he knew that
[1:20:53] there was a coming one, a just one who
[1:20:56] would stand in his place, who would
[1:20:57] raise up the body of the dead. And so,
[1:21:00] he said, "I know that my redeemer
[1:21:03] liveth." Reverend said, "Oh, I like
[1:21:05] those positive words." Amen. Amen. I not
[1:21:08] a hope so, not I have a feeling there
[1:21:10] will be. Amen. But I know my redeemer
[1:21:14] liveth. Job had more. Amen. Than a hope
[1:21:17] so. Amen. He had more than a feeling.
[1:21:19] Amen. He knew it. There was no more
[1:21:21] negative. It was now all positive.
[1:21:24] Listen, I want to say this. Amen. How
[1:21:26] thankful we are today that we don't have
[1:21:29] the dead bodies, but we have, Amen. the
[1:21:32] resurrected spirit of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:34] Christ. Amen. that he rose from the dead
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; triumphant. It's not no more I guess so.
[1:21:42] You could look at a cross and guess. You
[1:21:45] could look at a body laying in the
[1:21:46] ground and say I guess so. I hope so.
[1:21:49] But when the vision that struck Job ever
[1:21:52] become a reality, amen, the resurrection
[1:21:56] of the Lord Jesus by the Holy Spirit in
[1:21:59] the heart. Amen. Then you God, I know my
[1:22:02] redeemer liveth. Now I want you to catch
[1:22:04] this. Amen. That Job, Amen, 4,000 years
[1:22:09] before the coming of the Son of God.
[1:22:12] Amen. Job saw by vision the
[1:22:14] resurrection. Listen, he was not there
[1:22:17] physically. Amen. But by vision, he saw
[1:22:20] the resurrection. Amen. And I love to
[1:22:23] say it to you like this. And by that
[1:22:25] vision, he received assurance that he
[1:22:28] was going to be there. Amen. Amen. So he
[1:22:30] was not only seeing it. Amen. But he
[1:22:32] received an assurance that he was going
[1:22:35] to be a part of what he was seeing. I
[1:22:38] like to say it like this. Job, Amen,
[1:22:40] received a forecast.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Is that okay? Amen. Job received a
[1:22:46] forecast. Now, when you look there at
[1:22:48] that word forecast, if you can, if you
[1:22:49] can turn it up in my ear and leave it,
[1:22:51] I'll control it on my side. Amen. The
[1:22:53] word forecast, it actually means a
[1:22:55] prophecy. Amen. An estimate or a
[1:22:58] prediction of a future happening or
[1:23:00] condition. It is to predict or to
[1:23:03] estimate a future event. It is to
[1:23:06] indicate is likely to occur. Now I I
[1:23:09] love what the prophet of God said in
[1:23:11] modern events are made clear by
[1:23:12] prophecy. He said now we want to be
[1:23:15] posted to know what's to take place.
[1:23:18] Amen. For the age that we live in. How
[1:23:21] many wants to be posted? Amen. To know
[1:23:23] what is to take place. Amen. For the age
[1:23:26] that we live in. Another word. Amen.
[1:23:28] Therefore forecast is vision. Brother
[1:23:31] said a vision is the forecast of future
[1:23:34] events. It foretells the thing before it
[1:23:38] happens. That's the way God always
[1:23:40] vindicated whether it was a true prophet
[1:23:42] or not. He said see he was not a man
[1:23:44] hand laid on him and become a prophet.
[1:23:47] Amen. But before he was born. Amen. He
[1:23:50] was born a prophet. Listen the gift was
[1:23:53] in him. Amen. Before he was born. Now
[1:23:56] listen. A vision is what? It is the word
[1:23:59] or of God. Amen. It is something
[1:24:01] foretold. It is a forecast of an event.
[1:24:05] He said, "Now a vision that the prophets
[1:24:07] had or Jesus had or Paul had or all of
[1:24:10] them had." He said, "Now here we see the
[1:24:13] forecast is being made manifest and
[1:24:16] people don't even recognize it." Listen,
[1:24:19] we are living in the hour when the
[1:24:21] forecast is being manifested and people
[1:24:24] don't even recognize it. I think it's
[1:24:26] powerful when brother Brandham preached
[1:24:28] the seven church ages, he actually
[1:24:30] called those sermons a forecast.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; He said in Feast the trumpets, the
[1:24:35] preach of the seven church ages, which
[1:24:37] is the pattern, amen, or the forecast of
[1:24:40] all that God was going to do for the
[1:24:42] churches, amen, and through the churches
[1:24:45] and positionally setting them up. Now,
[1:24:48] in the Old Testament, we hear those
[1:24:50] words. Amen. Thus saith the Lord. You
[1:24:53] know that is recorded in the Bible more
[1:24:55] than 2,000 times. Amen. Now, when those
[1:24:58] words come, thus saith the Lord, you got
[1:25:01] to remember it's not the man talking.
[1:25:04] Amen. But it's God talking through the
[1:25:06] man. Amen. Amen. If if it was the man,
[1:25:09] then he would be a hypocrite. It would
[1:25:11] never come to pass. Amen. Now, listen
[1:25:13] what a prophet said. He said, "So the
[1:25:15] Bible is thus saith the Lord." Amen. By
[1:25:19] the prophets. You want to hear, "Thus
[1:25:22] saith the Lord." Open up your Bible.
[1:25:25] Amen. The Bible is thus saith the Lord
[1:25:28] by the prophets. He said, "What they
[1:25:30] done was they took Christ's spirit upon
[1:25:32] themselves and they begin to forecast,
[1:25:36] Amen, the events that was going to come
[1:25:38] to pass." He said, "You talk about
[1:25:40] forecast." Amen. Amen. They stood there.
[1:25:42] Amen. And the readers would read it and
[1:25:45] they would think that the prophets were
[1:25:47] speaking of themselves. Amen. But I want
[1:25:49] to say this morning, amen, many times
[1:25:52] they were speaking, amen, of events that
[1:25:54] would take place in future generations.
[1:25:57] [laughter] Amen. I don't have time to
[1:25:59] show them all to you, but I can show you
[1:26:00] one. Amen. All the way back in
[1:26:02] Corinthians and back in Thessalonians,
[1:26:05] Paul prophesied and said, "We shall not
[1:26:07] all sleep." Amen. But we shall be
[1:26:10] changed. Amen. and we shall be alive and
[1:26:13] remain. Do you realize there's not one
[1:26:15] Thessalonian alive today? Amen. There's
[1:26:18] not one Corinthian alive today. Amen.
[1:26:20] But there's a bride of Jesus Christ who
[1:26:24] has received the revelation of what Paul
[1:26:27] was saying. And by the receiving of the
[1:26:29] revelation, she is in position for her
[1:26:32] body to be changed. This is not a man.
[1:26:36] This is not a church. This is the
[1:26:38] prophecy of God coming to pass in the
[1:26:41] hour that we're living in. My, when I
[1:26:43] think of that prophecy, it didn't come
[1:26:45] in the old time by the will of man. But
[1:26:47] holy men of God spake as they were moved
[1:26:51] by the Holy Ghost. Now, I love that word
[1:26:53] moved. [laughter] It means to be moved
[1:26:55] inwardly. It means to bring forward into
[1:26:58] speech. Amen. That word prophecy, amen,
[1:27:02] is foretelling future events which could
[1:27:04] only come by the divine mind.
[1:27:08] Now, I love what a prophet says. He
[1:27:10] said, "Prophecy, if it's true word of
[1:27:13] God, it cannot fail." Ain't that
[1:27:16] powerful? Amen. Put everything you got
[1:27:18] on that. If it's prophecy, it's true
[1:27:22] word of God and it cannot fail. Now,
[1:27:25] when I think of this here this morning,
[1:27:27] we are living by a vindicated forecast.
[1:27:29] How many How many knows that there's a
[1:27:31] natural forecast? Amen. Amen. I will say
[1:27:34] this, but there's also a spiritual
[1:27:36] forecast. Amen. When you when you hear
[1:27:38] the word forecast, Amen. What's the
[1:27:40] first thing you think of? The weather.
[1:27:42] [laughter] Amen. The first thing your
[1:27:44] mind thinks of when you hear the word
[1:27:46] forecast, amen, is the weather forecast.
[1:27:48] Now, I find it amazing that the Bible
[1:27:51] actually speaks, amen, of the weather
[1:27:53] forecast in Matthew 16 and Luke 12. It
[1:27:56] said this, "You can discern the face of
[1:27:58] the skies, but you cannot discern the
[1:28:01] signs of the time." Amen. Now, watch
[1:28:03] this. When the weather forecast is spoke
[1:28:06] of in the Bible, it is dealing with the
[1:28:09] ability, amen, to forecast the weather,
[1:28:12] but it is also speaking of the lack of
[1:28:15] spiritual discernment. So you can look
[1:28:17] at the clouds and say, "Today it's going
[1:28:19] to rain." [laughter] You can look at the
[1:28:21] face of the skies and you can discern
[1:28:23] the cloud, but you cannot discern the
[1:28:26] time that you're living in. Oh, let me
[1:28:28] let me sound a trumpet to you this
[1:28:30] morning. As the elected overcomers of
[1:28:32] the age that we are living in, we must
[1:28:35] have spiritual discernment.
[1:28:38] Come on, folks. Spiritual discernment is
[1:28:40] not an option. It is a must. Amen. I
[1:28:43] love what Paul said. He said, "The
[1:28:45] natural man receiveth not the things of
[1:28:48] the spirit of God, for they are foolish
[1:28:50] unto him, neither can he know them,
[1:28:53] because they are spiritually discerned."
[1:28:56] When you look at that word discerned, it
[1:28:58] means by the aid of the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:01] Listen, without the Holy Ghost, we're
[1:29:03] headed for a tribulation. Without the
[1:29:05] Holy Ghost, we don't know how to
[1:29:07] believe. We don't know who to follow.
[1:29:09] But thank God, the Holy Ghost has been
[1:29:12] bound by denominational rivers for 2,000
[1:29:15] years. But it was to be loosed in the
[1:29:18] evening time. Come on, church. What was
[1:29:21] going to loose the Holy Ghost? It was
[1:29:23] the message of Zechariah the 14th
[1:29:26] chapter. In the evening time, it shall
[1:29:29] be light. My when I think of that,
[1:29:34] the Holy Ghost is not coming. The Holy
[1:29:37] Ghost is here. Hey, the Holy Ghost is
[1:29:40] not on his way. The Holy Ghost is
[1:29:42] already here.
[1:29:45] Amen. These things are spiritually
[1:29:47] discerned. Now, when you look at that
[1:29:49] word discern, it means to judge. It
[1:29:52] means to estimate. It means to determine
[1:29:55] the excellency or the defect of
[1:29:58] something.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Now, I love what the prophet said. He
[1:30:01] said, "We have an order from God, right?
[1:30:04] It is for the discerning of the spirit."
[1:30:08] Amen. Try the spirit. I believe that's a
[1:30:10] very great lesson for the church today
[1:30:13] is to try the spirit of anything. Come
[1:30:16] on. How many knows the Bible says all
[1:30:18] Israel is not Israel? Can I tell you
[1:30:20] something? Everything that claims
[1:30:22] message is not message. Folks,
[1:30:26] I hate to say it, but everything that
[1:30:28] claims to be the message is not the
[1:30:30] message. This message is not the kingdom
[1:30:33] building of a man. It's not the
[1:30:36] following of a personality. This message
[1:30:39] is the revelation of Jesus Christ that
[1:30:42] has been brought in this age.
[1:30:46] My when I think of that, we are to
[1:30:48] discern by the spirit of God. Come on.
[1:30:51] We are to determine the excellency or
[1:30:54] the defect.
[1:30:56] Come on now. Amen. That's why we must
[1:30:59] live by the word in the spirit.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Can I say that to you? We must live by
[1:31:05] the word in the spirit. Modern events
[1:31:08] made clear San Bernardina. He said,
[1:31:10] "Listen, make sure the spirit that's
[1:31:12] upon you is a word spirit according to
[1:31:15] the word."
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Now, John said it very beautiful. He
[1:31:19] said, "Believe not every spirit,
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; but try the spirit whether they are of
[1:31:25] God." Listen, because many false
[1:31:28] prophets are gone out into the world.
[1:31:30] You know what Paul said to Timothy? He
[1:31:32] said they'll have a form of godliness
[1:31:35] but they will deny the power thereof.
[1:31:38] Brother said they will preach the Bible
[1:31:40] but will deny the revelation of it.
[1:31:42] Amen. Now what is the power of this
[1:31:44] bride? It is the revelation that she is
[1:31:47] believing is what's given her the power
[1:31:50] in the hour that she's living in. I love
[1:31:52] what a prophet said. He said Paul
[1:31:54] promised in the last days by the Holy
[1:31:56] Spirit
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; that the church would fall away millions
[1:32:00] of them. There will come a falling away.
[1:32:03] That's a forecast, isn't it? There will
[1:32:06] come a falling away. Here's a forecast.
[1:32:08] Men will be heading. They will be
[1:32:10] high-minded. They will be lovers of
[1:32:12] pleasure more than lovers of God, truth
[1:32:14] breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
[1:32:17] and despisers of those that are good.
[1:32:20] Listen to what the prophet said. Not the
[1:32:22] [screaming] right discernment. He said,
[1:32:24] "Oh, you say that's communists." No,
[1:32:26] that's so-called Christians. He said,
[1:32:28] now watch the next verse. They will have
[1:32:31] a form of godliness but will deny the
[1:32:34] power thereof. He says no spiritual
[1:32:37] discernment. Amen. When you got
[1:32:39] spiritual discernment and the Holy Ghost
[1:32:42] is upon you, you have spiritual
[1:32:44] discernment and it says amen to every
[1:32:48] promise of God. If you got the Holy
[1:32:51] Ghost, come on church. We we put too
[1:32:54] many evidences of the Holy Ghost. Let's
[1:32:56] come back to what a prophet said. He
[1:32:59] said the only true evidence of the Holy
[1:33:02] Ghost is when a man can receive the word
[1:33:05] for the age that he's living in.
[1:33:08] My I think today we got a right to
[1:33:10] preach the promises of God. I think we
[1:33:12] got a right to stand on platforms around
[1:33:15] the world and declare this is not
[1:33:17] something in the future. This is not
[1:33:19] something that has been. This is a
[1:33:21] present tense revelation.
[1:33:24] [cheering]
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what the prophet said.
[1:33:27] Everything that's been promised has got
[1:33:29] to come to pass. I think it's time to
[1:33:31] forget our man-made theology. I think
[1:33:34] it's time to cry out to God for
[1:33:36] spiritual power and for spiritual
[1:33:38] discernment.
[1:33:40] When I begin to think of the age we're
[1:33:42] living in, I think how God who is rich
[1:33:44] in mercy would send a prophet into this
[1:33:47] generation and he would begin to preach
[1:33:49] something like this. He would say,
[1:33:51] "There's three sons names, right?" He
[1:33:53] would say, "See, there's the son of man.
[1:33:55] There's the son of God. He said, "And
[1:33:57] there's the son of David." He said, "But
[1:33:59] now watch. In between the son of God and
[1:34:02] the son of David, there was a scripture
[1:34:04] which was Luke 17:30." And it said,
[1:34:07] "Listen, in the day when the son of man
[1:34:10] would be revealed." Now, I believe what
[1:34:12] a prophet said. Amen. that Jesus
[1:34:14] forecasted. Remember what Luke 17:30
[1:34:17] said, "As it was in the days of Sodom
[1:34:20] and Gomorrah, as it was in the days of
[1:34:23] Noah, so shall it be in the day when the
[1:34:26] Son of Man will be revealed." In other
[1:34:29] words, he prophesied or forecasted
[1:34:31] [laughter] that the conditions of Sodom
[1:34:34] and Gomorrah would return in the day the
[1:34:36] son of man would be revealed. Now,
[1:34:38] listen to what he said. He said, "The
[1:34:40] police and the homicides and all, it's
[1:34:42] just on the go all the time, breaking up
[1:34:45] boys living together." Now, folks, this
[1:34:47] is all the way back in the 50s. He said,
[1:34:49] "Husband and wife and and women living
[1:34:51] the same way." Amen. Pervert it. Their
[1:34:54] minds are filthy minds because they
[1:34:57] don't have spiritual discernment. All is
[1:35:00] a lust and a filth and they can't
[1:35:01] satisfy theelves with one another. He
[1:35:04] said they don't even marry. They just
[1:35:05] take up and go out until they're
[1:35:07] perverted. Now, listen it, brother
[1:35:08] Brandham. Jesus said that would be in
[1:35:11] the last days and here it is.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Now, are you with me? He's not just
[1:35:16] reading the Bible and saying, "It's
[1:35:18] coming. It's coming." He says, "Now,
[1:35:21] here's what the Bible says." And here it
[1:35:23] is. He said, "When Jesus come, he was to
[1:35:26] be a prophet. And today, before Jesus
[1:35:28] comes again, the full manifestation of
[1:35:31] the person of Jesus Christ is to be
[1:35:34] manifested in flesh. As it was in the
[1:35:37] days of Sodom, so will it be in the
[1:35:39] coming of the Son of Man. When the Son
[1:35:41] of Man is being revealed, Amen. What is
[1:35:44] revealed? It's unfolded. It's made
[1:35:47] known. The secret has been brought
[1:35:49] forth. It's been revealed in the day the
[1:35:53] Son of Man will be revealed. The world
[1:35:55] will be in a Sodom condition. And a
[1:35:58] prophet said, "We've got it, haven't
[1:36:00] we?" How many believe that? It's a Sodom
[1:36:03] condition. Now, do you realize it took a
[1:36:05] prophet, amen, to get the revelation of
[1:36:08] the son of man? And it took a prophet to
[1:36:11] identify, amen, the time you're living
[1:36:13] in is the fulfillment of Luke 17:30.
[1:36:17] Come on, church. What other preacher
[1:36:19] could stand and read St. Luke 17:30 and
[1:36:22] then look across the congregation and
[1:36:24] say, "This day is this scripture
[1:36:26] fulfilled?" Hey, but we can stand here
[1:36:29] today with an authority in our hearts.
[1:36:32] We are living in the hour that the word
[1:36:34] has been fulfilled.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; It took a prophet to get the revelation
[1:36:39] because God has no other way of bringing
[1:36:42] out his scriptural revelations except by
[1:36:45] a prophet.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; The word always came by prophet and
[1:36:49] always will. That is the law of God. It
[1:36:53] is evident by even a casual surge of
[1:36:56] scripture.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Now, I love what he says. The unchanging
[1:36:59] God. How many believes he's unchanging?
[1:37:01] with unchanging ways, invariably sent
[1:37:04] his prophet in every age. When the
[1:37:07] people had strayed from divine order,
[1:37:10] with both the theologians
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; and the people having departed from the
[1:37:16] word, God always sent his servant to the
[1:37:18] people, but apart from the theologians
[1:37:22] in order to correct the false teaching.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, folks. And lead the people
[1:37:27] back to God. Now, now somebody say,
[1:37:30] "Well, Amen. I don't think it really
[1:37:31] matters what we believe." I think it
[1:37:33] does.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Come on. I don't think we ought to just
[1:37:36] believe everything that comes by. I
[1:37:38] think we ought to have an anchor to what
[1:37:39] we believe. I think we ought to have an
[1:37:41] absolute to what we believe.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Now, the pro God said, "It's the whole
[1:37:45] word, all the word, and the word of the
[1:37:48] hour is what counts." Ain't that
[1:37:50] powerful? The whole word, all the word,
[1:37:52] the word of the hour, what counts. and
[1:37:55] it'll never do it until God anoints a
[1:37:58] prophet that can stand and tell it
[1:38:00] [laughter] and confirms him and proves
[1:38:02] that it's right. Now, I want to say this
[1:38:04] to you. When spiritual discernment has
[1:38:07] been given into your heart, Amen.
[1:38:09] Spiritual discernment is not guessing
[1:38:11] something is right
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; or guessing that it's wrong, but
[1:38:15] spiritual discernment is knowing what is
[1:38:17] right and knowing what is wrong. Can I
[1:38:20] can I tell you this? Without spiritual
[1:38:22] discernment, you don't even know what
[1:38:24] truth is. It takes spiritual discernment
[1:38:27] to identify what truth is in the hour
[1:38:30] that you're living in. What did Jesus
[1:38:32] say? He said, "You shall know the truth,
[1:38:35] and the truth shall make you free."
[1:38:38] [cheering]
[1:38:39] Well, Brother Brandham said, "If you can
[1:38:41] see God's word and still don't think
[1:38:43] it's the truth, then there's something
[1:38:45] wrong with your spiritual discernment.
[1:38:47] Any man can read a newspaper, if he's
[1:38:50] got any spiritual discernment about him
[1:38:52] at all, and can see we're at the end.
[1:38:55] The hour is here. There is nothing left
[1:38:57] for us but the coming of the Lord Jesus.
[1:39:00] He said, now some people go out and say,
[1:39:02] "Oh, that might be a thousand years from
[1:39:04] the day." I don't believe that. He says,
[1:39:06] "I believe this generation will see the
[1:39:09] coming of the Lord Jesus." And if this
[1:39:12] generation doesn't do it, he said, then
[1:39:14] I want to preach to the young people.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; I want to preach to the young people
[1:39:20] that they'll be looking for it in their
[1:39:22] generation. Amen. I love that, brother
[1:39:24] Isaac. I want to preach to the young
[1:39:26] people. I want to build a spiritual
[1:39:29] expectation. I want to give a spiritual
[1:39:32] forecast to the young people. I want to
[1:39:34] tell them the world has fallen apart. I
[1:39:36] want to tell them Sodom and Gomorrah has
[1:39:38] returned. I want to tell them perversion
[1:39:41] is at an all-time high. I want to tell
[1:39:43] them crime is still in the streets. I
[1:39:45] want to tell them the nation is
[1:39:47] breaking. But I want to tell them that's
[1:39:48] not what you're looking at. When you see
[1:39:51] these things happen, it ain't time to
[1:39:53] focus on what's happening around you.
[1:39:55] Look up. Your redemption is calling
[1:39:58] nigh. Hallelujah. Let me say it to you
[1:40:01] today. I'm not focused. Come on, church.
[1:40:04] I'm not focused on what's happening
[1:40:06] around me. I've already heard the
[1:40:08] forecast. [cheering]
[1:40:11] I've already heard the forecast. There
[1:40:13] will be a tribulation, but there will be
[1:40:16] a rapture. There will be a falling away,
[1:40:19] but there will be a gathering together
[1:40:20] unto himself.
[1:40:23] There will be an apostasy, but there
[1:40:25] will be a revelation strike the heart
[1:40:27] [laughter] of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:31] Oh, I love what Ephesians or what 1
[1:40:33] Thessalonians 4 says. It says somebody's
[1:40:36] going to be alive. Woo. That makes me
[1:40:39] That makes me want to shout. Somebody's
[1:40:42] going to be alive and they're going to
[1:40:44] remain. You know what I love about that
[1:40:46] word alive, pastor? Amen. It means
[1:40:48] fresh.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That word alive means
[1:40:53] fresh. Somebody's going to be fresh when
[1:40:56] the Lord comes. Listen, I want to tell
[1:40:58] that devil, this is not a common
[1:41:00] message. We're not a bunch of stale,
[1:41:02] amen, indoctrinated Christians that
[1:41:04] ain't got no joy and ain't got no power.
[1:41:07] It's just not a man's idea. [cheering]
[1:41:11] Come on, church. I believe what the
[1:41:12] prophet said. He said, "There is a
[1:41:14] stimulation from revelation.
[1:41:17] I got a I got a friend.
[1:41:20] There's a stimulation of revelation."
[1:41:22] Right. Amen. I I got a friend of mine up
[1:41:25] in Saskatoon, an elder pastor, Brother
[1:41:27] Brother Men Freeze, and he he said
[1:41:29] something one time. I love it. He said,
[1:41:30] "I believe in stimulation and
[1:41:32] revelation." He said, "I don't believe
[1:41:33] in revelation from stimulation." I said,
[1:41:36] "I like that." Amen. I want what I've
[1:41:39] got, Amen, to be coming from what I
[1:41:41] believe. Come on, church. I Come on. I
[1:41:44] want what I've got to be coming from
[1:41:46] what I believe. And the Bible says that
[1:41:48] there'll be somebody who will be alive
[1:41:51] and they'll be fresh. Listen what a
[1:41:53] prophet said. If you fell asleep, he
[1:41:55] said that's okay. He said, "You will
[1:41:58] wake up if you fell asleep looking for
[1:42:01] the coming of the Lord." He said, "When
[1:42:02] you wake up, you'll be just as fresh as
[1:42:05] you were when you went down." Oh, church
[1:42:09] of the living God. Can I tell you this
[1:42:11] morning? Amen. Sleep don't change
[1:42:14] expectation.
[1:42:16] Sleep don't change anticipation.
[1:42:20] Are you with me? Amen. Amen. You mas
[1:42:23] daddies can preach with me on this
[1:42:25] point. Amen. Tell your babies the night
[1:42:27] before, "Tomorrow we're going to the
[1:42:28] theme park. Tomorrow we're going to the
[1:42:30] amusement park." And they go to sleep.
[1:42:33] Now, all you hope is when they wake up
[1:42:35] in the morning, they forgot what you
[1:42:37] told them. But when they wake up and
[1:42:39] their foot hits the floor, the first
[1:42:41] thing they say, they remind you what you
[1:42:44] promised. They reminded you that you
[1:42:46] said, "Today, we're going to go to the
[1:42:49] theme park. Oh, church of the living
[1:42:51] God. The seven thunders have uttered
[1:42:53] their voices. We have heard the revealed
[1:42:56] mystery truths and the ever remembering
[1:42:58] God has come on the scene in this
[1:43:01] generation. Listen, it's time to cry out
[1:43:03] the promises of God in the generation
[1:43:06] that we're living in. [cheering]
[1:43:08] We're not
[1:43:11] we're not pleading the ideas of a man.
[1:43:13] We're pleading the promises of God.
[1:43:17] Oh yes. God sent a prophet in this age
[1:43:21] to call these things present tense.
[1:43:26] Now I got Bible on that. He's the same
[1:43:29] yesterday,
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; today, and forever. How many knows that
[1:43:34] brother Bannon wrote or he recorded an
[1:43:36] audio letter to Lee Vale
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; on the church age book? Have you ever
[1:43:40] read the first part of that? You know
[1:43:41] what he says? He says, "Now look here,
[1:43:43] brother Veil." He says, "Unless God
[1:43:45] sends a prophet to interject this to
[1:43:48] make it present tense,
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; then it's a historical affair."
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; So, I love what the Bible said. Amen. I
[1:43:57] send an angel before thee
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; to keep thee in the way, and to bring
[1:44:01] thee into the place which I have
[1:44:04] prepared. Malachi 4, behold, I will send
[1:44:06] you Elijah the prophet. Forecast right
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; before the coming of the great and
[1:44:10] dreadful day of the Lord. Now, watch the
[1:44:12] forecast. He shall turn the heart
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; of the fathers to the children and the
[1:44:18] heart of the children to their fathers
[1:44:19] lest I come and smite the earth with the
[1:44:21] curse. Now how many knows the prophet
[1:44:22] makes it very plain? He says the
[1:44:24] messenger Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7
[1:44:27] is going to do two things. One, he is
[1:44:30] going to turn the hearts of the children
[1:44:32] back to the faith of the fathers. And
[1:44:34] two, amen, those seven thunders which
[1:44:37] are the divine revealed mystery truths
[1:44:39] which are contained in the seven ship.
[1:44:42] Listen today, folks. We don't have to go
[1:44:44] ask a man what the thunders are. We've
[1:44:46] got thus sayaeth the Lord by the
[1:44:48] vindicated prophet of the hour. He has
[1:44:50] already broke the revelation to the
[1:44:52] church. And that revelation [laughter]
[1:44:54] has lit a fire in the soul of the bride
[1:44:57] of Jesus Christ.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, come on. Let's not stop
[1:45:01] at Exodus 23. Let's not stop at Malachi
[1:45:04] 4. Let's go all the way under
[1:45:06] perfection. Let's go to Ephesians 4
[1:45:08] where he gave something. He gave some
[1:45:10] prophets and he gave some pastors and he
[1:45:13] gave some apostles and evangelists and
[1:45:14] teachers. Amen. Now watch the forecast
[1:45:17] for the perfecting of the saints, for
[1:45:19] the work of the ministry, for the
[1:45:21] edifying of the body of Christ,
[1:45:23] [screaming]
[1:45:24] [cheering]
[1:45:25] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:45:27] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[1:45:29] God, unto a perfect man, unto the
[1:45:32] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:45:34] of Christ. Listen, that we henceforth be
[1:45:37] no more children. tossed to and fro and
[1:45:40] carried about with every wind of
[1:45:42] doctrine by the slight of men and
[1:45:44] cunning craftiness whereby they lie wait
[1:45:46] to the scene but speaking the truth in
[1:45:49] love.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Now come on folks if you really love
[1:45:52] somebody you'll tell them the truth.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. If you really love somebody,
[1:45:57] you won't sugarcoat it. You won't put a
[1:45:59] pair of gloves on to say it. You'll tell
[1:46:01] them the truth that we may grow up into
[1:46:04] him in all things which is the head,
[1:46:07] even Christ. Now, amen. I just got to
[1:46:09] say when a prophet said, he said, "If a
[1:46:11] man comes and he has a great gift,
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; don't matter if he belongs to our
[1:46:15] denomination or another denomination,
[1:46:17] don't you judge him by what denomination
[1:46:20] he comes from, how he dresses, but what
[1:46:22] you want to see is what he's trying to
[1:46:25] do with that gift. what purpose he has.
[1:46:28] If he's trying to take his influence and
[1:46:31] build himself a great name out of it, I
[1:46:34] would have discernment of spirit enough
[1:46:36] to know that's wrong.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; No matter how great a teacher he is, how
[1:46:42] powerful he is, how intellectual he is,
[1:46:45] how his gift operates, if he isn't
[1:46:47] trying to achieve something for the
[1:46:49] benefit of the body of Christ, your own
[1:46:52] spiritual discernment would tell you
[1:46:54] that's wrong. No matter how accurate, no
[1:46:57] matter how perfect, how it is. Amen.
[1:47:00] It's wrong if it isn't used for the body
[1:47:02] of Jesus Christ. I say God forgive us
[1:47:05] for invading pullpits and building walls
[1:47:09] rather than building bridges into the
[1:47:10] presence of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:14] Amen. I flew all the way over here. I
[1:47:16] might as well preach. I'm here. Amen. I
[1:47:18] think it's time to come back to what the
[1:47:19] prophet said. I think it's time to lay
[1:47:21] aside tradition. I think it's time
[1:47:24] somebody put your foot on that old devil
[1:47:27] of organization, that old devil
[1:47:29] denomination.
[1:47:30] This is not a dividing message. It's a
[1:47:33] uniting time and a uniting sign.
[1:47:38] And my headship is not in Rome. So don't
[1:47:41] make it anywhere else.
[1:47:45] Come on. If I'm going to have a head, I
[1:47:47] might as well go get the one they all
[1:47:48] got wrong. Amen. My headship is not in
[1:47:51] Jeffersonville. My headship is not in
[1:47:53] Ohio. My My headship is not in Trinidad.
[1:47:57] My headship is not in Arizona. My
[1:48:00] headship is in heaven. I come from God.
[1:48:03] And I want to go back to God. I'm not
[1:48:06] following a man. I'm following a
[1:48:08] vindicated [music] forecast that has
[1:48:10] been revealed that has been unfolded by
[1:48:13] the son of man.
[1:48:17] I'm not following some man. I'm
[1:48:19] following Joshua. [cheering]
[1:48:21] I'm following Joshua. And Joshua is the
[1:48:24] Holy Ghost.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? He said,
[1:48:28] Joshua, that new leader, he positionally
[1:48:31] placed [music] the tribes of Israel.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; And he divided the land of inheritance.
[1:48:36] Now, how did he do it? He did it by
[1:48:38] spiritual discernment.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Do you see something? Joshua's
[1:48:46] personality didn't put him in their
[1:48:47] position.
[1:48:51] Joshua's ability to quote Moses did not
[1:48:54] put him in their position.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen. Joshua's
[1:48:58] relationship with Moses did not put him
[1:49:00] in their position. Spiritual discernment
[1:49:04] of the word of God went all the way back
[1:49:06] to when those mothers were birthing
[1:49:08] those sons and they were crying out in
[1:49:10] birth pains. And by spiritual
[1:49:12] discernment, Joshua, he be to position
[1:49:14] him in their place. I love what a
[1:49:16] prophet said. He said, "And there they
[1:49:19] remained."
[1:49:22] There they remained and became the cream
[1:49:26] of the crop. What are you saying,
[1:49:28] preacher? I'm saying I didn't come in by
[1:49:30] a man so a man can't take me out.
[1:49:34] [cheering]
[1:49:37] I didn't come in by some preacher's
[1:49:39] personality so some preacher's
[1:49:41] personality can't take me out. I came in
[1:49:44] by a direct revelation. My name was on
[1:49:47] the lamb's book of life from before the
[1:49:50] foundation of the world. [cheering]
[1:49:55] I'm not living by some church. I'm not
[1:49:57] living by some preacher. I'm living by
[1:49:59] the message of the hour. It's a
[1:50:02] vindicated forecast.
[1:50:04] It's spiritual discernment. It's
[1:50:07] spiritual revelation. It's Matthew 16.
[1:50:10] Come on. It's Matthew 16. Flesh and
[1:50:12] blood. Come on. This is not a flesh and
[1:50:14] blood affair.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Well, now now I know what they say. They
[1:50:22] say, "Well, I was with brother Brandham,
[1:50:23] so you got to follow me." I've got to
[1:50:25] follow what he said.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; I remember, Brother Theo, I may be
[1:50:31] getting too open. You can correct me,
[1:50:32] but I [laughter] I remember as a young I
[1:50:34] remember as a young preacher, there was
[1:50:35] an elder brother come to me one day and
[1:50:37] he sat me down and he said, "I'm going
[1:50:39] to tell you something right now." He
[1:50:40] said, "I was with brother Brandham and I
[1:50:41] was around brother Brandham and my
[1:50:42] family. He going on and he said, "I want
[1:50:45] to tell you something." He said,
[1:50:46] "Brother Bram called me friend."
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, he called me Brian."
[1:50:53] [cheering]
[1:50:54] [applause]
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm no longer going to call you
[1:51:00] church. I'm going to call you bride.
[1:51:02] You're no longer the girlfriend of Jesus
[1:51:05] Christ. You are the wife of Jesus Christ
[1:51:08] who has received the unmmerited wedding
[1:51:11] band of grace upon your finger.
[1:51:13] [cheering]
[1:51:16] I didn't come in by a man so a man can't
[1:51:18] take me out.
[1:51:21] Now, now you got to you got to you got
[1:51:22] to see what a brother said. He said,
[1:51:24] "Flesh and blood didn't reveal this to
[1:51:25] you,
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; but my father which is in heaven
[1:51:29] revealed it." Look what he said, "Upon
[1:51:31] this rock I will build my church, and
[1:51:33] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:51:35] against it." He said, "Now, what is the
[1:51:37] gates of hell against? It's not against
[1:51:39] denomination, saints. It's not against
[1:51:42] intellectualism. It's not against
[1:51:44] education."
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? He said,
[1:51:48] "It's not even against the government.
[1:51:49] The government recognizes it." He said,
[1:51:51] "Look, it's against spiritual revelation
[1:51:55] of Christ being here now, the same
[1:51:59] yesterday, today, and forever." Watch.
[1:52:03] That's where the church is missing it
[1:52:05] today. It's the spiritual discernment to
[1:52:09] see what God's are doing. And they look
[1:52:12] way over the top for something here
[1:52:15] that's going on right here. And it'll be
[1:52:17] passed before you know it. Now, now can
[1:52:21] I say something to you? Don't miss it.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Is that okay? Don't miss it.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Look, somebody say, "Well, brother
[1:52:30] Andrew Glover is coming to Headstone
[1:52:31] Tabernacle. We're going to have some
[1:52:32] meetings. I saw the fire." Okay. Well, 3
[1:52:35] weeks ago, you was looking for it. You
[1:52:38] was looking forward to it. But tomorrow,
[1:52:40] if you get up and say, "I'm looking for
[1:52:42] brother Andrew to come to." Amen. You've
[1:52:44] already missed it.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; You've already missed it. Now, come on,
[1:52:49] church. And I'll say this to you. Amen,
[1:52:52] brother. Said it. Beautiful. He said,
[1:52:54] "Don't you miss it, but study these
[1:52:55] tapes. Man now is like he's always been.
[1:52:58] He's praising God for what he's done.
[1:53:01] He's looking forward to what he's going
[1:53:02] to do and is ignoring what he has done
[1:53:06] and is doing. He praises God for what he
[1:53:10] has done. He looks forward to what he
[1:53:12] will do, but he ignores
[1:53:15] what God is doing." and there misses the
[1:53:18] whole thing. Now, do you know why men do
[1:53:20] that? Because if you recognize what's
[1:53:23] going on, then you recognize it's not
[1:53:25] them.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; If you recognize what's happening,
[1:53:36] [laughter] I I'm not here to fight. I'm
[1:53:37] here to preach. If if you recognize
[1:53:39] what's going on that that as long as a
[1:53:42] man says there's something coming or
[1:53:44] something coming, he can inject himself
[1:53:46] and say you've got to have me to get to
[1:53:48] what's coming. But if you can by
[1:53:50] spiritual discernment discern the word
[1:53:53] of God and the hour that you're living
[1:53:55] in, he said look it's a spiritual
[1:53:57] condition of the church today. They
[1:53:59] failed to see the hour they're living
[1:54:03] in. They're looking for some sensation
[1:54:05] or something way off in the future. Come
[1:54:08] on, Headstone Tabernacle. We're not a
[1:54:10] bunch of Catholics. We're sons and
[1:54:12] daughters of God.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Well, someday we'll reach perfection.
[1:54:16] Someday we'll become overcomers. Listen,
[1:54:19] the word is the perfection of the
[1:54:21] church. And any man, any woman who can
[1:54:23] receive the headship of the word will
[1:54:26] climb up into the presence of God.
[1:54:29] [cheering]
[1:54:32] Come on, church. I'm not a crazy man.
[1:54:34] I'm a son of God. I'm a child of God.
[1:54:37] And I know where I come from. I know
[1:54:39] where I'm going because I know what I'm
[1:54:42] following.
[1:54:44] [applause]
[1:54:45] I'm not following a man. I'm following
[1:54:47] the word.
[1:54:49] Reverend said, "May he and his power."
[1:54:50] There it is. May he and his power come
[1:54:53] to the audience of people and with his
[1:54:56] spiritual discernment show you he is the
[1:54:59] word. Now, can I say this to you today?
[1:55:01] And I want you to hear me. We are not
[1:55:04] looking for a vision.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; We are looking at
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; we are looking at a vision.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Can I say this to you? We have the
[1:55:17] vision.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, if you're looking for something,
[1:55:21] then you're not looking at it.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. If you're looking Come on. I
[1:55:27] can take you to Luke 15. There's
[1:55:29] parables there. The woman lost the coin.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Now, now everybody wants to rejoice and
[1:55:36] I believe in rejoicing. I I believe in
[1:55:38] shouting, but I don't think it's
[1:55:40] something we got to work up.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; I believe we've got a message. And if
[1:55:45] we'll preach the message, the message
[1:55:47] will bring a stimulation into the heart
[1:55:50] of every eagle.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Come on. You like somebody. Oh, come on.
[1:55:55] Shout. Shout. Shout. Amen. Everybody
[1:55:57] shout. Shout. I'll shout if I want to
[1:55:59] preach the message. Is
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; that okay? Amen. And if you'll begin to
[1:56:03] preach it and you'll give me something
[1:56:05] to look at when I find what I'm looking
[1:56:08] for, then I can begin to rejoice. When
[1:56:11] she was looking for the coin, there was
[1:56:13] no rejoicing. When he was looking for
[1:56:15] the sheep, there was no rejoicing. When
[1:56:17] the son was away from the father's house
[1:56:20] and he was looking for the son, there
[1:56:22] was no rejoicing. But when they found
[1:56:24] the go, when they found the sheep, when
[1:56:27] the prodical son come home, they all be
[1:56:30] to rejoice because that which was
[1:56:33] missing had been found. And for 2,000
[1:56:36] years, for seven church ages, they were
[1:56:39] looking for God. They were looking for
[1:56:40] the manifestation of God. But in the
[1:56:43] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:56:45] when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:56:47] revelation will be made clear and
[1:56:49] somebody will say, "Praise God, I am
[1:56:52] [screaming] the bride's revival.
[1:56:57] I'm not looking for the bride's revival.
[1:56:59] I'm looking at
[1:57:03] I'm not looking for the seven seals. I'm
[1:57:06] looking at the revelation. I'm not
[1:57:08] looking for the third pull. I'm looking
[1:57:10] at the third pull.
[1:57:14] [cheering and applause]
[1:57:17] Will somebody rejoice?
[1:57:20] [applause]
[1:57:23] [cheering]
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; See, you've got something to rejoice
[1:57:26] about.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Where there is no vision, the people
[1:57:31] perish.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Brother Theo, I love that word
[1:57:34] vision.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; It means oracle.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; It means prophecy. Amen.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Or divine communication.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Where there is no divine communication,
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; the people perish. Now,
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; I love what a prophet says.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "What is the seer? What is a
[1:57:53] vision?" It's another dimension.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; See, it's outside the [screaming] five.
[1:58:00] It's a six sense.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; You know, somebody asked Brother Random.
[1:58:03] They said, "But Ran, when you say you
[1:58:05] have a vision, do you do you feel
[1:58:07] impressed to say something or do you
[1:58:09] actually see it?"
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; I love what he said. He said, "No, sir.
[1:58:13] I see it."
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; So, he's not speaking up on impressions.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now you got to you got to
[1:58:20] either realize this message is the truth
[1:58:22] or not.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "What's happening
[1:58:25] is he said, "My I'm getting into
[1:58:27] tonight's sermon."
[1:58:29] He said, "My body is here." He said,
[1:58:32] "But I'm over there."
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I'm speaking over there
[1:58:37] what I'm seeing, but you're hearing it
[1:58:40] back here."
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "A vision is God. It's by a
[1:58:46] word." Now, come on, church. A word of
[1:58:49] knowledge dropping to the person to
[1:58:52] foresee or foresee something. It tells
[1:58:56] something that has been or tells
[1:58:59] something that will be. Now I love what
[1:59:01] brother said in that quote we read at
[1:59:03] the beginning. He said when Job was at
[1:59:05] his wits end when every mortal part of
[1:59:08] his body was gone, he said God in his
[1:59:11] mercy gave Job another sense.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? Now can I say this
[1:59:19] to you? Another sense is the six sense.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; It's the super sense. It's what Paul
[1:59:27] said. He said, "Now faith is the
[1:59:30] substance of things hoped for, the
[1:59:33] evidence of things not seen." I love
[1:59:35] what he says in Galatians 2:19. He said,
[1:59:38] "I through [screaming] the law am dead
[1:59:40] to the law." Listen, that I might live
[1:59:43] unto God.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Now, can I can I read it to you?
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; I am crucified with Christ.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Isaac, I love this.
[1:59:52] Nevertheless, I live.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I'm [screaming] dead, yet I
[1:59:56] live." Yeah.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yet not I
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; but Christ liveth in me
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; and the life which I now live, I live by
[2:00:07] the faith
[2:00:10] of the Son of God, who loved me and gave
[2:00:14] himself for me." Come on, church. Notice
[2:00:17] Paul didn't say, [screaming] "I live in
[2:00:19] the faith of the Son of God." He said,
[2:00:21] "I live by the faith of the Son of God.
[2:00:28] I love what Paul is saying. He is saying
[2:00:30] in one sense I am dead.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; In one sense I am dead but in another
[2:00:36] sense
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; I am [screaming] alive.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Oh church of the living God comes along
[2:00:44] and says this was a living faith. I live
[2:00:46] by the faith of the son of God. Paul did
[2:00:49] not say that he lived by faith in the
[2:00:51] son of God. Oh church, it was the faith
[2:00:55] of the son of God that had given him
[2:00:58] life and had kept him living in
[2:01:00] Christian victory.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you ever get that faith in your
[2:01:04] heart, you won't need a broken sister no
[2:01:07] more. If you ever get that faith in your
[2:01:09] heart, you won't be living from one
[2:01:11] convention to another. It'll be an
[2:01:13] artisian whale and it'll be springing
[2:01:16] up. It'll be bubbling up on the inside
[2:01:18] of you. [applause]
[2:01:21] Now, I want you to catch something here.
[2:01:23] In one sense, I'm dead. But in another
[2:01:27] sense, I'm alive. [screaming] I love
[2:01:29] that. In one sense, and another sense,
[2:01:31] it typically refers to the different
[2:01:34] ways that we perceive the world through
[2:01:37] our five senses.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; It is the sight, hearing, smell, taste,
[2:01:41] and touch. Now, I study brother
[2:01:44] Brandham. Uh the best example I can give
[2:01:46] you of I in one sense in another sense
[2:01:49] is the proto God said this. He said
[2:01:51] tomorrow the mailman comes to your house
[2:01:54] and he offers you a box of rattlesnakes
[2:01:56] and says now all you got to do is sign
[2:01:58] for them. Your name is on the box. Now
[2:02:01] you say I don't want them. But the
[2:02:03] mailman says they're yours. You know
[2:02:06] what brother Bam said? He said in one
[2:02:08] sense they're yours.
[2:02:12] In one sense, they're yours, but in
[2:02:15] another sense, they're not yours until
[2:02:18] you sign for them.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, church. That's where
[2:02:21] spiritual discernment is going to come
[2:02:22] in. You've got to discern what you're
[2:02:25] signing for.
[2:02:29] [applause]
[2:02:30] [cheering]
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Come on, try the box of rattlesnakes.
[2:02:34] Amen. Try it. Listen, it's a box of
[2:02:36] rattlesnakes. It's not going to benefit
[2:02:38] your life. It's a defect that the
[2:02:41] devil's trying to get you to sign for.
[2:02:45] [applause]
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; But spiritual discernment can discern
[2:02:50] the excellency or the defect of what's
[2:02:53] being presented to you.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Now some say, brother
[2:02:57] Brandham, could Jesus look like you or
[2:03:00] you be Jesus or something like that?"
[2:03:02] Well, in one sense of the word, that's
[2:03:04] exactly the truth. But in another sense
[2:03:07] of the word is an antichrist. That's the
[2:03:11] difference between right and wrong.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Now folks, either he said the truth or
[2:03:16] he didn't. And I believe he did.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; To make me the person of the Lord Jesus
[2:03:22] Christ would be an antichrist.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; For that person of the Lord Jesus is
[2:03:28] sitting at the right hand of the majesty
[2:03:30] on high and will come again in great
[2:03:33] power and glory. but for his life
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; that was in him being upon me and upon
[2:03:41] you who have him. It's exactly the truth
[2:03:45] and you become Christ.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Do you see spiritual discernment will
[2:03:51] discern the excellency and the defect?
[2:03:54] He said remember my message on messiah
[2:03:57] the word messiah means the anointed. Now
[2:03:59] you are, if you have the Holy Spirit,
[2:04:02] you become the anointed one. C, can I
[2:04:06] bring it on down? Jesus was a God man.
[2:04:09] He said, now see, he was a man in one
[2:04:12] sense, but he was God in another sense.
[2:04:16] He was man in flesh, but in spirit he
[2:04:19] was God. Now, come on. We got to bring
[2:04:21] it on down.
[2:04:25] We can't leave it way up there or way
[2:04:27] out there and you can never come to it.
[2:04:29] Let's bring it on down. For in a man, he
[2:04:32] is in one sense a miniature creator if
[2:04:35] he is a child of God. Because the spirit
[2:04:38] of God is in him who controls him, who
[2:04:42] operates him. Yeah,
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; we are carnal.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; And that part [screaming] must perish.
[2:04:53] But then inside, we are a spirit man, a
[2:04:57] soul inside. Listen, are you with me
[2:05:00] now?
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; He says that soul inside. He says that's
[2:05:05] faith in God's word.
[2:05:10] The soul [screaming]
[2:05:11] on the inside of the believer is faith
[2:05:14] in God's word. Listen. Then we bring our
[2:05:18] outside body under subjection to the
[2:05:21] word by faith.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Can I read the rest of it? Can I read
[2:05:27] the rest of it? By accepting what God
[2:05:30] said.
[2:05:33] [cheering]
[2:05:36] Glory to God. You want to bring your
[2:05:38] body under subjection to the word.
[2:05:40] Accept what God has said.
[2:05:44] [cheering]
[2:05:46] [applause]
[2:05:47] I'm feeling good now. Woo. I'm feeling
[2:05:50] good.
[2:05:51] Can I Can I just say it to you? There's
[2:05:54] three kinds of believers in every
[2:05:56] church.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; There's a make believer,
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; there's an unbeliever, and there's a
[2:06:00] real believer.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Can I bring it on down to you? There's
[2:06:05] three kinds of believers in every
[2:06:07] believer.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Now you were shouting about every
[2:06:13] church.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; You say, "You can't prove that." I can.
[2:06:17] Do you realize what a prophet said? He
[2:06:19] said, "You are a triune being just like
[2:06:22] father, son, holy ghost." He said, "You
[2:06:25] got a body, you got a spirit, and you
[2:06:27] got a soul."
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Can I show you something? Your body is
[2:06:31] flesh, and your flesh is an unbeliever.
[2:06:38] It's your flesh that don't want to
[2:06:40] worship God. [cheering]
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; It's your flesh that don't want to go to
[2:06:45] church. It's your flesh that don't want
[2:06:48] to pray. It's your flesh that don't want
[2:06:50] to forgive.
[2:06:53] It's your flesh that don't want to let
[2:06:56] things go. Because your flesh is a
[2:06:59] product of an adulterous affair between
[2:07:01] your
[2:07:03] between Eve and the serpent. Your flesh
[2:07:06] is an unbeliever. Can we bring it on
[2:07:08] down?
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Under that flesh, you got a spirit.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Your spirit's [screaming] a make
[2:07:13] believer.
[2:07:21] [applause]
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; You had a good service on Sunday.
[2:07:26] You get out of church and somebody calls
[2:07:28] you up
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; and as my dear friend brother brother
[2:07:30] brother brother brother brother brother
[2:07:30] brother brother brother brother brother
[2:07:30] brother brother brother brother brother
[2:07:30] brother brother brother brother brother
[2:07:31] brother brother brother brother brother
[2:07:31] brother brother brother brother brother
[2:07:31] brother brother brother brother brother
[2:07:31] brother brother brother brother Daryl
[2:07:31] Wetskow when he would answer the phone
[2:07:32] you'd say how you doing he'd say too
[2:07:35] blessed to be stressed
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; too anointed to be disappointed
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; too healed to be sick
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; too saved to be lost
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; now come on you'd have a good service
[2:07:46] and your spirit can go there but wake up
[2:07:49] on Monday morning and get a phone call
[2:07:50] from the doctor
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; all right
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; and Watch that spirit go from the high
[2:07:57] of high to the low of lows. Because your
[2:08:00] spirit is a make believer. When
[2:08:02] everything's going good, it's all high.
[2:08:04] When everything's going wrong, it's real
[2:08:06] low. But I want to go a little bit
[2:08:08] deeper.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; I want to go a little bit deeper. I got
[2:08:11] a question for you. But why [screaming]
[2:08:13] are you still here?
[2:08:16] Why are you still here? Why [screaming]
[2:08:19] are you still following this message?
[2:08:21] Why are you still believing and
[2:08:23] accepting what God said? Because
[2:08:25] underneath that flesh, underneath that
[2:08:27] spirit, there is a soul. And that soul
[2:08:31] is faith in God's word.
[2:08:34] And no matter how sick I am, I'm still
[2:08:37] saved. No matter how broke I am, I'm
[2:08:40] still a son of God. On my good days, I'm
[2:08:42] a child of God. On my bad days, I'm a
[2:08:45] child [music] of God. When I got money,
[2:08:47] I'm a child of God. When I'm broke, I'm
[2:08:49] a child of God. I am not saved from my
[2:08:52] flesh. I am not saved from my spirit. I
[2:08:55] am saved from my soul. It's from my
[2:08:57] soul. I believe God. It's from my soul.
[2:09:01] I believe this message.
[2:09:04] [applause]
[2:09:06] [cheering]
[2:09:07] Hallelujah. It's from my soul.
[2:09:10] [applause]
[2:09:12] I'm a son of God by my soul.
[2:09:16] [cheering and applause]
[2:09:19] and my soul is faith in God's word.
[2:09:25] [cheering]
[2:09:30] Well, somebody give him praise.
[2:09:32] Hallelujah.
[2:09:39] [applause and cheering]
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:09:53] [applause]
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:58] Whatever you yield that sense to is
[2:10:00] what'll dominate you. I got a 100 quotes
[2:10:02] on it. I don't have time to read them.
[2:10:03] The six sense is faith
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; and it cannot lie.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; What is the super sense? It's the Holy
[2:10:12] Spirit. It's the faith of God that
[2:10:14] dwells in you.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; It makes you believe things you can't
[2:10:21] see.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; It makes you believe things you can't
[2:10:28] feel.
[2:10:32] [applause]
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; It makes you believe things you can't
[2:10:35] reason.
[2:10:37] All
[2:10:38] right.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; I got I got to I got to dedicate
[2:10:43] something to the devil. Is that okay?
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, devil. The devil can't get the
[2:10:50] devil can get into these five senses
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; and lie to you,
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; but he cannot touch
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; that super sense. [applause]
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; It's far [screaming]
[2:11:07] beyond his reach. It comes from God.
[2:11:11] It's called faith. And faith is a great
[2:11:14] thing.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; It will deliver that word to you
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; and make you walk contrary to anything
[2:11:23] there is but God's word. Now,
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; I want to say something to you.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; The natural mind says and reads the word
[2:11:29] of God
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; and says that is the word of God. Right?
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; It's speaking the truth.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; But if it reads it and says it's not all
[2:11:39] the word of God
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; or it was or it's something, it was one
[2:11:45] time but it isn't now. Then that six
[2:11:48] sense comes in.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Do you see? That's why you can't trap a
[2:11:53] real believer inside man-made moves
[2:11:55] around this message.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:02] Come on. You can build the Cincinnati
[2:12:04] Zoo.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; But a real eagle's going to get out of
[2:12:08] there.
[2:12:12] [cheering]
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Woo. [screaming] Glory.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. We We might as well
[2:12:17] preach. Amen. Amen. I heard [laughter] I
[2:12:19] think it was brother Tim Puit said it
[2:12:21] one time. He said, "I'm not going to no
[2:12:23] man-made concentration camps."
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm sorry. I'm not working
[2:12:28] under some man-made man-made idea about
[2:12:30] this message. And you know what I say? I
[2:12:32] say, "And neither am I. I'm an eagle.
[2:12:35] I'm a son of God. I've got rights in the
[2:12:38] Holy Ghost."
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, I know what they say. They say,
[2:12:41] "Well, if you don't follow me, and if
[2:12:43] you don't preach it the way I preach it,
[2:12:44] and you don't teach it the way I teach
[2:12:46] it, you don't say it the way I say it,
[2:12:47] then we'll cut you off." Cut me off. I
[2:12:50] got my own books and tapes.
[2:12:53] You'll never shut me up. I'll preach on
[2:12:55] a rock if I got to because I am a son of
[2:12:59] God and I've got a sick sense in my soul
[2:13:02] and it's declaring things that are to
[2:13:04] me. It's modern events made clear
[2:13:08] by the forecast.
[2:13:17] Am I doing okay on time?
[2:13:20] The sixth sense only feeds on the word
[2:13:23] of God.
[2:13:27] [applause]
[2:13:32] [applause]
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Can I go on
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; now? Now, now, now, do you realize your
[2:13:38] six sense works when nothing else will?
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said this. He said there
[2:13:45] were two women come to the prayer line,
[2:13:47] right? He said one had a gorder on her
[2:13:50] neck
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; and the other had a stomach trouble.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; He said now what happened was they sat
[2:13:55] in the meeting where the word was
[2:13:57] preached.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; And how do you how do you bring this
[2:14:01] flesh under subjection to the word? By
[2:14:04] accepting what God said.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; So as they were hearing the word, they
[2:14:08] were believing the word and they were
[2:14:11] becoming the word.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Is that okay? See, their flesh was
[2:14:15] coming under subjection to the word that
[2:14:18] they was hearing.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; They come through the prayer line and
[2:14:24] the prophet said, "You're both healed."
[2:14:26] And they went off the platform and the
[2:14:28] gorder was still there
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; and the stomach trouble was still there,
[2:14:33] but they left testifying, "I'm healed."
[2:14:37] In one sense, they were still sick.
[2:14:41] [applause and cheering]
[2:14:43] In one sense they were still sick but in
[2:14:46] another sense
[2:14:50] [cheering]
[2:14:50] and that other sense only belongs to a
[2:14:53] believer. It only belongs to a
[2:14:55] Christian. In one sense they were still
[2:14:57] sick but in another sense.
[2:15:01] In another sense they were already
[2:15:04] healed.
[2:15:06] I'm sorry. I feel so good. I got to say
[2:15:08] it. In one sense, I'm still in a
[2:15:11] tabernacle of humiliation, but in
[2:15:14] another sense, I've already heard from
[2:15:17] my theophony.
[2:15:19] In one sense,
[2:15:23] in one sense, I'm trapped in this old
[2:15:26] pest house, but in another sense, I've
[2:15:29] got a soul.
[2:15:31] And the soul that believeth on God has
[2:15:34] passed from death unto life.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; I love what brother said. He said, "Try
[2:15:39] to rub that out if you can."
[2:15:43] [applause and cheering]
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; Gorder still there.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Stomach trouble still there. I'm healed.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Two weeks.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; Two weeks go by, saints,
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; and one morning. One more
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; because faith
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; which is the six sense which is
[2:16:10] unconscious
[2:16:12] [applause and cheering]
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; church. This message is too rich.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; She finished the orange juice
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; without thinking.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because that flesh
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; had already come subject to the word.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; So the flesh was no longer determined in
[2:16:39] her condition.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; She drank the juice and said it stayed
[2:16:46] down. She finished the toast. It stayed
[2:16:48] down. She said, "Now let's give it the
[2:16:50] acid test." She made a cup of coffee.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; I love coffee. She made a cup of coffee
[2:16:59] and she drank the coffee and it stayed
[2:17:01] down. Now come on folks and she started
[2:17:05] shouting.
[2:17:10] She was no longer [screaming] looking
[2:17:12] for her healing.
[2:17:14] She was looking at her healing.
[2:17:16] [cheering]
[2:17:17] And she ran up the street and she went
[2:17:20] to her friend's house and she was in
[2:17:22] there shaking the seats.
[2:17:26] She was in there shaking the sheets.
[2:17:28] They said, "What's wrong?" She said, "I
[2:17:30] got up this morning and I looked in the
[2:17:32] mirror and the gorder
[2:17:35] was completely gone."
[2:17:39] The gorder was completely gone. Oh, come
[2:17:43] on, saints.
[2:17:47] Are you hearing me? That's the way the
[2:17:49] rapture is going to be for you one of
[2:17:51] these mornings. [applause and cheering]
[2:17:55] You're going to wake up and you're going
[2:17:57] to go in the mirror and you're going to
[2:17:59] start combing your hair and brother
[2:18:00] Isaac, there's going to be a head full
[2:18:02] of hair. Oh, glory. You're going to look
[2:18:05] in the mirror and you're going to see
[2:18:07] your loved ones
[2:18:09] in one sense.
[2:18:13] [cheering]
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "What was it?" The sixth sense
[2:18:18] was catching it.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Have I got a few more minutes?
[2:18:24] Go ahead. Go ahead. [snorts]
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Do you see what happens to [laughter] a
[2:18:27] believer?
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; The sixth sense,
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; he says, "And the Holy Spirit stands
[2:18:34] side by side."
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit was speaking
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; and the six sense was a many.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; A [screaming] prophet made a forecast.
[2:18:57] When the word is preached, there will be
[2:19:00] somebody believe it.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know if it's possible, but
[2:19:05] but can you give me 2 Corinthians 4
[2:19:07] and:e 7 on the on the screen? If it's
[2:19:09] possible, it's a very powerful
[2:19:11] scripture. I want I want to share
[2:19:12] something with you.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:19:16] Paul says this 1 Corinthian or 2
[2:19:18] Corinthians 4:7, "But we have
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; not we shall."
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's read it together.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; But we have
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; this treasure. What treasure?
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Another sense.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; We have this treasure where
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; in theophanes
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; in glorified bodies.
[2:19:44] We've had this treasure in earth and
[2:19:46] vessels. Come on, folks. You're in an
[2:19:48] earthn vessel right now.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; But here it is. That the excellency,
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; come on. I'm not a crazy man. What does
[2:19:58] spiritual discernment do? It gives you
[2:20:00] the ability to discern between the
[2:20:02] excellenc
[2:20:04] I just made up a word. And the defect of
[2:20:06] it.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; We have this treasure in earthn vessels.
[2:20:11] that the excellency of the power may be
[2:20:14] of God and not of us.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Give me the next verse.
[2:20:26] [screaming]
[2:20:32] But we have this treasure
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; in earthn vessels
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; yet not distressed.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; We are perplexed
[2:20:41] but not in despair. Next verse.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; We are persecuted
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; but not forsaken. We are cast down
[2:20:54] [cheering and applause]
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; but not destroyed. [screaming]
[2:20:58] I'm not talking about a sinless
[2:21:00] perfection. I'm talking about a word
[2:21:02] perfection by the power of God.
[2:21:04] [screaming]
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Next verse.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Always bearing about in the body of the
[2:21:10] dy Lord Jesus that the life [screaming]
[2:21:12] also of Jesus
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; might be made manifest in our body. Now,
[2:21:18] now go back to verse eight.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Now I want to read it like this. Is this
[2:21:23] okay?
[2:21:25] In one sense we are troubled on every
[2:21:28] side,
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; but in another sense we're not
[2:21:33] distressed.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; In one sense we are perplexed,
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; but in another sense we're not in
[2:21:41] despair.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Next verse. In one sense we are
[2:21:45] persecuted, but in another sense we are
[2:21:48] not forsaken.
[2:21:50] Woo.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; In one sense, we are cast down, but in
[2:21:54] another sense, we are [screaming] not
[2:21:57] destroyed.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to tell that devil this
[2:22:01] morning, come hell or high water, you
[2:22:04] will never destroy the bride [screaming]
[2:22:07] of Jesus Christ. She is living by a
[2:22:10] vindicated forecast.
[2:22:14] [cheering]
[2:22:16] What are we doing here this morning? We
[2:22:18] are partaking of the oracles of God.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to bring this down to
[2:22:27] you. When this power has come into you,
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; it will release an authority
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; to call things present tense.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet's only looking off to
[2:22:40] see something he's talking about what
[2:22:42] he's looking at. He ain't thinking about
[2:22:44] here and what you look like now. He's
[2:22:47] looking at what it's going to be. And
[2:22:49] when he speaks that, if it's in the word
[2:22:51] of the Lord,
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; it's already been spoke. Amen.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for this?
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing in the world can
[2:23:01] stop it.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; See, when the when the when God sends a
[2:23:07] message to the age, that message be that
[2:23:10] message
[2:23:12] becomes the leadership of the age.
[2:23:16] Then the elect of the age follows that
[2:23:20] leadership of the age.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; Reb said only one messenger for each age
[2:23:24] receives what the spirit has to say to
[2:23:26] the age and that one messenger is the
[2:23:27] messenger to the true church.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; The message is then broadcast
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; to all.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Another word for forecast is broadcast.
[2:23:38] But though it is broadcast for all who
[2:23:40] come within range of the message,
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; that message is received individually
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; by only a certain qualified group
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; in a certain way.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Each individual of that group is one who
[2:23:58] has the ability to hear what the spirit
[2:24:01] is saying by way of the messenger. Those
[2:24:05] who hear
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; are not getting their own private
[2:24:09] revelation.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Nor is a group getting their collective
[2:24:15] revelation. But each person is hearing
[2:24:19] and receiving what the messenger has
[2:24:22] already received from God. Amen.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; Now, I find it amazing that forecast,
[2:24:29] they're usually in paper form or in
[2:24:32] radio form. Right.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Our spiritual forecast
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; has come to us
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; in book form.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; William Mary and Brandham's spoken word
[2:24:47] books.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; And tape form,
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; audio and
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, can I can I bring it on down? Look
[2:24:59] at this word broadcast. It means to
[2:25:01] transmit.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It means to scatter seed.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Look here. Parable of the sewer and the
[2:25:08] seed. A swer went forth to sow and the
[2:25:11] seed is the word of God.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Now come on brother since book spoke
[2:25:15] words original seed. He said the
[2:25:17] messenger of Malachi 4. He will plant
[2:25:20] the seed of the entire Bible plumbed
[2:25:24] from the serpent to the messenger in the
[2:25:27] former reign. He will then be rejected
[2:25:29] by the nomination as his forefather John
[2:25:31] and Elijah as was spoken by our Lord.
[2:25:33] Listen what he says here. I pray this is
[2:25:36] okay. I'm going somewhere.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; The events that we see taking place is
[2:25:41] absolutely showed in the Bible.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; Now, now come on folks. I believe that
[2:25:48] the message is in between the lines.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; But make sure what you're getting
[2:25:53] between the lines is coming from what's
[2:25:55] on the lines. Amen.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; We think we're all out of cater, but
[2:26:10] we're not. The Bible is a different book
[2:26:12] from any other sacred book.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; There's no book like the Bible because
[2:26:18] it's Bible. It's God in word form. And
[2:26:22] any seed will bring forth its kind if
[2:26:25] it's in the right condition in the right
[2:26:27] atmosphere. He said, "Now listen, this
[2:26:30] book of prophecy, it's foretelling
[2:26:32] future events." He said, "Now that's why
[2:26:34] I'm going everywhere I can going to this
[2:26:37] corner sewing seeds and over here sewing
[2:26:40] seeds and over here sew and sew a few
[2:26:42] seeds. I know the fowls of the air will
[2:26:45] gather many of them up and some of them
[2:26:47] choke and so forth, but there might be a
[2:26:50] few
[2:26:51] in there come up too, you know. So,
[2:26:54] let's just sew the seed is the main
[2:26:57] thing.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; Now, if we'll quit trying to separate
[2:27:02] and get back to preaching.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Just sew the seed.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, how many knows the
[2:27:16] prophet God said, and I know I'm slowing
[2:27:17] down, but I'm doing this on purpose. He
[2:27:19] said, "There's been three seeds sown."
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; There was a denominational seed. It was
[2:27:25] sown by Billy Graham. There was a
[2:27:27] Pentecostal seed. It was swed by Oral
[2:27:29] Roberts. He said, "But then there was a
[2:27:32] word seed."
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, folks. The prophet of God
[2:27:37] [screaming] is not bringing you a
[2:27:38] reformation. He's bringing a message.
[2:27:41] And it's the calling out of the bride.
[2:27:45] It's the shout of First Thessalonians 4.
[2:27:48] Anybody tells you you got to hear them
[2:27:50] to go on the rapture, I'm not trying to
[2:27:52] be mean. They're a liar.
[2:27:57] [applause]
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. Sometime or another,
[2:28:01] we're going to get some gumption about
[2:28:03] us and get a backbone and do like the
[2:28:05] Bible said. When they begin to say
[2:28:07] things that Paul said, and they knew
[2:28:09] Paul didn't say it, there were men that
[2:28:11] stood up and said, "That's not what Paul
[2:28:14] said."
[2:28:17] And I think we ought to get some
[2:28:18] Christians. It's got some courage about
[2:28:20] them. And when somebody begins to try to
[2:28:23] build a kingdom and a concentration camp
[2:28:26] to lead God's bride into, somebody ought
[2:28:29] to stand up and say, "That's [snorts]
[2:28:31] not what William Brandham taught."
[2:28:35] [cheering]
[2:28:38] [applause]
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to show you something. Billy
[2:28:44] Graham,
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere. Okay.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; He swed a denominational seed.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; And I heard one of his sermons the other
[2:28:52] day and I and you know what he said?
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "I feel
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; God is moving
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; all over the world."
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; I I did time and did a study.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "I feel God is moving all over
[2:29:05] the world
[2:29:07] calling souls."
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; I went listen to Oral Roberts
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; and I watched him in a service. You know
[2:29:14] what he did?
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; He got up and said, "Glory to God.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I feel God
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; is moving in this building somewhere."
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; But then I went listen to brother
[2:29:29] Brandham.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; You know what he didn't say? He didn't
[2:29:34] say, "I feel God is moving all over the
[2:29:36] world." He didn't just say, "I feel God
[2:29:39] is moving somewhere in this building."
[2:29:41] But he stood on a platform and said,
[2:29:44] "The God of this Bible is not three feet
[2:29:48] from where I'm standing from."
[2:29:52] Do you see? It was a dispensational
[2:29:55] change. It was going from saying there's
[2:29:58] something coming to saying this, here's
[2:30:01] my ministry to declare him, he is here.
[2:30:08] [cheering]
[2:30:10] that I don't need some man to come along
[2:30:12] and tell me where God is. I've already
[2:30:15] heard the shout of first Thessalonians
[2:30:18] 4. I've already heard, brother Gideon,
[2:30:21] I've already heard the voice of the
[2:30:23] seventh angel.
[2:30:25] He is here. [cheering] I tell you today,
[2:30:29] in the name of the Lord, he's here right
[2:30:31] now. The same God that was with William
[2:30:34] Brandon. The same God that was in Sabino
[2:30:37] Canyon is right here in Headstone
[2:30:40] Tabernacle this morning. He's here. My
[2:30:43] faith declares he's here.
[2:30:48] He's here to heal. He's here to save.
[2:30:52] He's here to deliver.
[2:30:56] [cheering]
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not seeking signs.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; I've recognized the sign.
[2:31:05] I'm not looking for a move of God.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at a move of God.
[2:31:11] [cheering and applause]
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not in a horse and buddy.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not in a car.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not in an airplane.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; I'm going I'm going to tie this up right
[2:31:19] here.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; I've seen the forecast.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, preacher,
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; you've been preaching on the forecast
[2:31:27] for an hour nearly
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; or over,
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; and you ain't said nothing about blood
[2:31:32] moons and You ain't said nothing about
[2:31:35] Russia.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; And you ain't
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; You a You ain't said nothing about Sodom
[2:31:43] laws. And you ain't said nothing about
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; what's like I I
[2:31:52] I'm going to get in trouble. I was
[2:31:54] preaching in a meeting one time and I
[2:31:55] had the last service in the meeting and
[2:31:57] a brother come to me and he said this.
[2:31:58] He said, "I feel sorry for you."
[2:32:01] I said, "Why you feel sorry for me?" He
[2:32:04] said, "Well," he said, "you got to
[2:32:06] preach after all these preachers and in
[2:32:07] this meeting." I said, "Oh, I studied,
[2:32:09] Brother Brandham.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; I I Brother Bram's got something to say
[2:32:13] and I'll say what he said. Not trying to
[2:32:15] be arrogant. I'm just I'm an eagle." So,
[2:32:17] I'm I'm talking to this guy and he said,
[2:32:19] "Well, let me tell you something to
[2:32:20] preach." I said, "Okay." He said, "Why
[2:32:23] don't you?" He said, "The whole nobody's
[2:32:24] preached on hell."
[2:32:27] I said, "Yeah." He said, 'Why don't you
[2:32:29] preach on hell?
[2:32:31] I said, 'Well, brother, I normally I
[2:32:33] normally try to preach on what I'm
[2:32:34] studying by inspiration, and
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; I ain't never really studied much on
[2:32:38] hell.
[2:32:42] [applause and cheering]
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Why ain't you study on
[2:32:45] hell?" I said, "Cuz I ain't going there.
[2:32:50] [applause]
[2:32:57] Come on.
[2:32:59] Before I come to Trinidad, I begin to
[2:33:01] study on things about Trinidad. I wanted
[2:33:04] to know what the weather was like. I
[2:33:05] looked at the forecast. I want to know
[2:33:07] the I begin look because it's something
[2:33:10] pertaining to me.
[2:33:13] Come on, church. I'm not going to waste
[2:33:15] my time studying on hell. I didn't come
[2:33:17] from hell and I'm not going to hell.
[2:33:21] I'm going to study on the future hope.
[2:33:24] I'm going to study on the rapture. I'm
[2:33:26] going to study on the revelation that's
[2:33:28] going to release the Elohim revelation.
[2:33:31] It's going to change my body.
[2:33:34] Come on, church. I'm not looking at the
[2:33:36] world's forecast. It don't pertain to
[2:33:39] me.
[2:33:41] [cheering]
[2:33:42] [applause]
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; I want to close by saying this.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; You can't have a message without a
[2:33:56] messenger.
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; You can't have a prophet a prophecy
[2:34:01] without a prophet.
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; And you can't have a forecast without a
[2:34:05] weatherman.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; Can I can I say something to you?
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; I've got it in notes, but I'm just going
[2:34:13] to preach it to you. Our
[2:34:16] prophet stood there. And brother Theo,
[2:34:18] I'm I'm not making light of the things
[2:34:20] he revealed, right,
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; concerning end time events. I I study
[2:34:24] those things. I'm not I'm just not
[2:34:26] That's how do I say it? It's not my
[2:34:29] food.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; I study those things, but it's not my
[2:34:33] food.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, let me say something to
[2:34:35] you here.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; He stood there and he said, "The world
[2:34:42] is falling apart." Amen.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Amen."
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; He said Sodom and Gomorrah has returned.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Amen."
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; He said that there's a there's a
[2:34:52] there'll come a time that the spirit of
[2:34:54] perversion will be protected by Sodom
[2:34:56] law.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Amen."
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "There'll come a time that
[2:35:00] there'll be a persecution come upon the
[2:35:01] bride." And and I said, "Amen."
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; He taught about the World Council of
[2:35:05] Churches. And I said, "Amen."
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; He taught about the Ecumenical Council,
[2:35:08] and I said, "Amen."
[2:35:10] But see, this is not a negative vision
[2:35:12] for the bride.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; Our strength is not coming from
[2:35:19] persecution.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; Our strength is coming from the
[2:35:22] revelation.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:35:26] [applause]
[2:35:26] [cheering]
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; Now, yes, I know persecution causes
[2:35:32] people to get stronger, but the bride
[2:35:35] strength
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; is coming from the revelation.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; So, I'm studying along and he says
[2:35:41] there'll be darkness upon the earth. And
[2:35:42] then he says there'll be gross darkness
[2:35:44] on the people.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; And saints, I don't fit in there
[2:35:47] anywhere.
[2:35:50] [applause]
[2:35:52] [cheering]
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; I don't fit in in there anywhere.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; I can't find my place in there. So, I
[2:35:58] keep on listening. And then I hear him
[2:36:00] say, "But arise and shine,
[2:36:05] [cheering]
[2:36:06] for thy light [screaming] has come and
[2:36:08] the glory of the Lord has arisen upon
[2:36:11] me." I said, "Oh, there it is. That's
[2:36:14] where I'm at." Amen. There's
[2:36:17] there's confusion upon me out of sin.
[2:36:19] The world has fallen apart. You want to
[2:36:21] talk about Russia? Let's talk about
[2:36:23] Russia. I heard a prophet say this.
[2:36:25] Before one bomb ever hits this land,
[2:36:28] I'll be seated.
[2:36:30] At the marriage supper of the lamb, I've
[2:36:34] already heard the forecast.
[2:36:39] It's not a negative forecast. It's not a
[2:36:42] doom and gloom
[2:36:46] &gt;&gt; forecast.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; There's a message.
[2:36:51] The modern events that are happening
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; are made clear
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; by the prophecy.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; Will you stand to your feet with me this
[2:37:00] morning?
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; The opening of the word
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; is the only thing
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; that could cause us to see
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; that it's happening.
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; Will you say this with me? It's
[2:37:14] happening.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; It's happening.
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; That felt good.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; It's happening. It's happening. [snorts]
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; What the Pentecostal said was going to
[2:37:23] happen.
[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; A prophet by the word seed stood there
[2:37:27] and said,
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; "It's happening
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord."
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; The evening time message is here.
[2:37:37] &gt;&gt; Y'all like to study your Bibles?
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 64 prophesied something. You know
[2:37:42] what it said, brother Gideon? It said
[2:37:44] that there were secret things of God
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; that had not entered the heart of man.
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; Paul come along in 2 Corinthians 2, I
[2:37:52] believe it is, and picked it up or 1
[2:37:53] Corinthians 2 and begin to read it and
[2:37:55] he began to say, "Now the things that
[2:37:57] have not entered into the heart of man."
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; He says, "But are now."
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; See what was happening? The prophecy of
[2:38:06] Isaiah was made was being made clear.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "God gives a revelation.
[2:38:12] He never changes it. He adds to it
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; to make it more clear. Right?
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; So Isaiah prophesied of it. Paul comes
[2:38:19] along and he says these words,
[2:38:21] beautiful. He says, "But it is now
[2:38:24] revealed by the spirit."
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; The things which were hid have now
[2:38:29] entered in the heart of the believers by
[2:38:30] the revelation of the spirit.
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; Now folks, I can't stop there. I got to
[2:38:35] read all the forecast.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham comes along and
[2:38:39] says these words. He says, "God's great
[2:38:41] mystery, the eternal God had as a
[2:38:42] mystery, has now been unfolded in Jesus
[2:38:47] Christ."
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; It's given right down to his church.
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; What was once in God's mind
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; is now in the body of Christ.
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; Church of the living God. Who else is to
[2:39:01] come?
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; None other but our Lord
[2:39:05] &gt;&gt; himself.
[2:39:08] Isaiah prophesied of it. Paul wrote
[2:39:10] about it. The seventh angel stood on a
[2:39:13] platform and identified what was in
[2:39:15] God's mind
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; is now in God's church.
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question today?
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; What will you do with this Jesus
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; called Christ?
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; What will you do with this revelation?
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; Will you make it a bunch of buzzwords?
[2:39:31] Will you make it a bunch of high points?
[2:39:33] Or will you be a will you be a son of
[2:39:34] God that'll dig in there? Amen.
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; And get an anchor
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; and get a place to stand.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is our vision. I
[2:39:45] love this. I'm I've got a bunch of stuff
[2:39:47] and I'm out of time. Y'all are just a
[2:39:49] joy to preach to.
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; You might not have felt it.
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know about that. He says, "But
[2:39:57] it's here anyhow."
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; Whether you feel it or not.
[2:40:05] Let's give God thanks for it.
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; It's here anyhow.
[2:40:14] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Theo, I'll get some I'll get
[2:40:18] some Trinidadian currency. Can I Can I
[2:40:20] buy five minutes
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; real quick? I'm sorry.
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; God don't want you living in Leosa
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; blinded. He don't want you living
[2:40:31] wondering what's going to happen. Folks,
[2:40:32] we have been posted by the word of life.
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; I tell you something beautiful. I was
[2:40:37] just studying this this morning. Brother
[2:40:38] said this. He said, "A woman come to me
[2:40:40] and she had dreamed a dream." He said,
[2:40:42] "The devil come to her in the dream
[2:40:43] making funny faces and screamed out
[2:40:45] these words, I got you now." And she
[2:40:47] said something just happened to me. I
[2:40:50] just jumped up out of the bed and I
[2:40:51] said, "Get out of here, devil, in the
[2:40:52] name of Jesus."
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; And [snorts] I started running him.
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; See, under Moses, they were on the
[2:41:00] defense.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:41:02] The enemy chased them to the Red Sea.
[2:41:05] But under Joshua, they was on the
[2:41:07] offense.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. [applause]
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; They went from the enemy chasing them.
[2:41:14] She said, "I run him out of the house
[2:41:16] and said, I don't understand." But then
[2:41:18] the Holy Spirit being present give the
[2:41:20] interpretation. And just little after
[2:41:22] that, her husband had a heart attack.
[2:41:24] And when she seen her husband fall, he
[2:41:26] was an aged man, heavy. His hands went
[2:41:27] back and his eyes said, "Death come to
[2:41:29] take him." But God wasn't through with
[2:41:32] him.
[2:41:33] &gt;&gt; And that [screaming] little woman's
[2:41:35] faith,
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; I want to preach a sermon on that one
[2:41:38] day. That little woman's faith, it
[2:41:41] raised up and said, "I won't stand for
[2:41:44] it. I [screaming] call for his life in
[2:41:48] the name of Jesus Christ." He got well.
[2:41:53] [applause]
[2:41:56] [cheering]
[2:41:57] In one sense, she was a little woman,
[2:41:59] but in another sense, she was a daughter
[2:42:02] of Abraham with the faith of Abraham,
[2:42:05] authority over every devil.
[2:42:09] [applause] But then he said, "What
[2:42:10] happened?" He said, "In that crucial
[2:42:12] moment," he said that little six sense
[2:42:14] rose up and give her faith.
[2:42:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "God give the interpretation.
[2:42:19] The devil come to get your husband, but
[2:42:21] you, the power of God stopped him. She
[2:42:23] began screaming." That's what happened.
[2:42:25] Now I love what he says. He said, "Now
[2:42:28] see, now that goes into grace.
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; Give her the dream, not even know it,
[2:42:35] not even knowing what it was.
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; But God is thankful and loyal anyhow to
[2:42:42] keep his people posted.
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:49] [applause]
[2:42:49] &gt;&gt; There's no devil."
[2:42:53] Brother, the devil hates this bride.
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; She cannot be
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; deceived.
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; Listen, there is a prophetic grace
[2:43:01] that's come to you
[2:43:03] &gt;&gt; in the hour that Jesus Christ would be
[2:43:06] revealed. How many believe that
[2:43:08] revelations give you authority?
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; How many raise your hands right now and
[2:43:12] say, "I surrender to the message."
[2:43:14] &gt;&gt; I surrender to the headship of the word.
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; I surrender to the power that has been
[2:43:19] brought back into the church.
[2:43:21] Is this what'll bring the power of God
[2:43:23] back in the church? Yes, sir, brother
[2:43:24] Brandon.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; It's the opening of them seven seals.
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; It's the revealing of them thunders.
[2:43:29] It's that opening of the word.
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; It's the power of God in the bride
[2:43:33] standing today calling these things
[2:43:35] present tense.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; It's your flesh coming subject to the
[2:43:40] word.
[2:43:41] &gt;&gt; Will you bow your hearts with me this
[2:43:42] morning?
[2:43:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Maybe we could just play
[2:43:46] that only belief softly.
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's your faith.
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; Believing what God said and accepting
[2:43:52] what God said.
[2:43:54] &gt;&gt; Listen, you're not going to take the
[2:43:56] rapture by feelings.
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you all something this
[2:44:02] morning. On the morning of the rapture,
[2:44:06] you might wake up and it might be the
[2:44:08] lowest you've ever felt in your entire
[2:44:10] life.
[2:44:12] You might feel the most unsaved, the
[2:44:15] most unqualified, the most unworthy. And
[2:44:18] in just a few moments, the power of God
[2:44:19] begin to change your body
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; because you will not take this rapture
[2:44:24] by feelings.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; You will take it by the word.
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; As you receive the word, you receive the
[2:44:31] word, you become the word.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; I wonder right now how many say, Lord,
[2:44:34] bring this flesh under subjection to the
[2:44:36] word of life.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want the treasure to be in this
[2:44:41] earthn vessel.
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; I want the power of God
[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; to manifest its life. Yes, Lord.
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; Through my body. Almighty God,
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; we stand here upon this platform today
[2:44:52] speaking the word of truth [music]
[2:44:54] &gt;&gt; that has been revealed by the spirit of
[2:44:56] truth.
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:44:58] &gt;&gt; Transmitted through the voice of the
[2:44:59] seventh angel.
[2:45:01] &gt;&gt; Father, not bringing confusion, but
[2:45:02] bringing clarity.
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; Not bringing misunderstandings, but
[2:45:06] bringing revelation.
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; Not bringing personality, but bringing
[2:45:10] the personal presence of Jesus Christ
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; among the church of the living God.
[2:45:15] Father, these are your children. These
[2:45:17] are your eagles.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; And Satan is doing everything he can to
[2:45:20] paralyze the faith of this generation.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; Men have invaded pullpits uncalled,
[2:45:26] unqualified.
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; Have not met the pillar of fire. Have
[2:45:29] not met the God of this message, have
[2:45:32] sat somewhere and met an intellectual
[2:45:33] spirit, which is a deceiving spirit.
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; And has walked to a pullpit and has
[2:45:38] tried to deceive people right out of
[2:45:40] their inherited promises by the
[2:45:41] revelation of this word. But Father, I
[2:45:44] stand here today and I I declare war on
[2:45:46] every devil in hell.
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; I declare war on every spirit of
[2:45:50] unbelief.
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; I declare war on every man-made
[2:45:53] interpretation that would the
[2:45:54] faith of your children and would hinder
[2:45:56] them from walking in the promises of God
[2:45:58] in this hour. Satan, I adjure thee by
[2:46:01] the power of the Holy Spirit. We have
[2:46:04] been given a clear message with a clear
[2:46:06] understanding. We have been given the
[2:46:08] revelation recorded on books and tapes.
[2:46:10] We have been given the Bible and it's
[2:46:12] not a closed book. It's an open book.
[2:46:14] You have provided, Lord, a five-fold
[2:46:16] ministry that'll stay under what a
[2:46:17] prophet said. And Father, there's no
[2:46:20] room for man-made interpretation.
[2:46:22] There's no room for man's ideas. Lord,
[2:46:24] we rebuke every one of them today. Every
[2:46:26] tradition, Lord, every everything that
[2:46:29] has been carried over from one from one
[2:46:31] tradition to another, we rebuke it and
[2:46:33] turn loose of it today in the name of
[2:46:35] the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, we have a
[2:46:38] vindicated forecast. And Lord, as you
[2:46:40] begin as a as a person begins to look at
[2:46:42] the forecast, that forecast begins to
[2:46:45] affect their actions. As I as I begin to
[2:46:47] come on this trip, I begin to pack my
[2:46:50] suitcase by the [music] forecast. I
[2:46:52] begin to think about things by the
[2:46:54] forecast. Oh God, the forecast [music]
[2:46:56] affects what we wear. It affects the
[2:46:58] places we go. It affects the things we
[2:47:01] say. It affects the things we do.
[2:47:03] Almighty God, may the forecast of the
[2:47:06] message of the hour, may it begin to
[2:47:08] affect every one of your children. If
[2:47:10] they're wearing things contrary to the
[2:47:12] forecast, may they change it to fit the
[2:47:14] forecast. If they're believing things
[2:47:17] contrary to the forecast, may they throw
[2:47:19] it away today. And may they get a hold
[2:47:21] of these searching, May they get a hold
[2:47:23] of these uncarchable riches. May they
[2:47:25] get a hold of these untapped resources.
[2:47:27] May they begin to tap into it. May they
[2:47:30] begin to search into it. May they begin
[2:47:32] to receive understanding and revelation.
[2:47:35] In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray. In
[2:47:38] the name of Jesus Christ, I pray. Raise
[2:47:41] your hands all over the building and
[2:47:42] thank God for the forecast. Thank God
[2:47:45] you got something to live by. Thank God
[2:47:48] you got something to raise your babies
[2:47:49] by. Thank God you got something to face
