[12:17] you
[12:18] and then we'll bring on our
[12:19] guest testimony speaker tonight
[12:22] today as i guess most of you might know
[12:25] by now
[12:26] we had 720 new cases of coronavirus and
[12:29] 21 deaths
[12:30] so trinidad is going in the
[12:32] wrong direction
[12:34] really fast and we want to encourage you
[12:37] to
[12:38] take note of these standing protocols
[12:41] that
[12:42] is in place that you
[12:44] don't be
[12:46] slack don't take things for granted
[12:49] actually today
[12:51] the world of the world health
[12:53] organization had an emergency meeting
[12:55] because of a new variant from south
[12:57] africa
[12:58] and that variant uh mutates setting 30
[13:01] times
[13:02] i believe the delta
[13:05] mutates about three times
[13:07] so this guy
[13:08] this demon whatever it is it
[13:10] it they're not sure that any vaccine
[13:13] right now would be able to deal with
[13:14] this guy
[13:16] so we are dealing
[13:18] we are living in perilous times we are
[13:20] living in dangerous times and i want
[13:22] each one of you to be safe
[13:24] yeah and i believe it was august the 1st
[13:27] i preach a message having therefore
[13:28] boldness to enter into the holy of
[13:31] holies by the blood of jesus something
[13:32] like that
[13:33] and on that message i shared
[13:36] about the leopards
[13:37] i know
[13:39] uh i didn't intellectually
[13:42] just uh
[13:44] study in and get that thought
[13:46] it was given to me to share with you
[13:49] by i call divine inspiration
[13:52] and you know what obama says
[13:54] you can only serve god
[13:56] as you do
[13:58] believe the servants that god send
[14:01] that interprets the word to you by
[14:02] divine inspiration
[14:04] and we got many testimonies both locally
[14:06] and abroad
[14:07] of people who haven't heard that message
[14:09] and heard what was shared
[14:11] uh they were hesitant to take the
[14:12] vaccine and they went and do it
[14:14] afterwards
[14:15] because in that
[14:16] i felt that i was given by the lord to
[14:18] share about these lepers and these
[14:20] lepers if we stay here we will die
[14:23] if we go out we will die
[14:25] and i didn't add this one but i guess as
[14:27] lepers they will die anyhow but they
[14:29] choose to act and in acting
[14:32] everything changed
[14:34] and i believe that the situation around
[14:36] us
[14:37] it's almost
[14:38] and and the prophet called this a dingy
[14:40] fate that these lepers
[14:42] choose to go into the camp the enemies
[14:45] camp and while they were going to watch
[14:47] the camp god caused the enemy to hear
[14:49] noise
[14:50] and they fled and they ran and these
[14:53] guys were able to eat food and come back
[14:54] and let the city know there's food up
[14:56] there and everything else but the
[14:58] storyline or what is the key behind all
[15:01] of that
[15:02] is that in times like this
[15:04] doing nothing is not an option
[15:07] it's not an option you have to take care
[15:10] of you and do what is your best
[15:12] for you
[15:13] as a pastor i don't
[15:16] go to hospitals and go to
[15:18] doctors with people
[15:20] who have issues and challenges you
[15:23] you take up yourself you go and visit
[15:25] the doctor doctor prescribe this
[15:27] prescribe this
[15:28] the person has nothing involved in that
[15:31] you
[15:31] go to your private doctor that is your
[15:33] business that is your fear and you need
[15:35] to set up a prayer request it's a
[15:37] prepared question and so on we're not
[15:38] involved in that so i cannot
[15:41] tell you
[15:42] that don't take the vaccine i cannot
[15:44] tell you that all these health
[15:46] professionals of the devil and vaccine
[15:48] of the devil is as far as they're
[15:49] concerned as foolishness
[15:51] um to travel overseas we have to take
[15:53] yellow fever vaccine we have to take
[15:54] this vaccine that vaccine it's required
[15:57] and all these so-called vaccines i never
[15:59] asked fortunate you know and i would say
[16:01] this way if you take a bottle of ketchup
[16:04] you will see some name there that you
[16:06] can pronounce you don't know what in it
[16:08] if you think what kind of coke
[16:10] any preserved thing you will see stuff
[16:12] there that you can't even explain you
[16:13] don't know what it's about it's there
[16:15] and we are still alive and around
[16:17] so to me
[16:19] in this plague it's a plague it's a
[16:20] pandemic is a plague
[16:22] we have to
[16:23] see ourselves getting more serious with
[16:25] the lord
[16:26] some time ago i preached a message i
[16:28] shared about the unleavened bread of
[16:30] sincerity and truth and that message
[16:33] i shared how about a man speak about
[16:35] this member this
[16:36] black mamba
[16:38] that wasn't coming to him
[16:40] he was coming to the bridge coming to
[16:42] his brother
[16:43] and even though that snake couldn't
[16:45] affect him
[16:46] he was told to be more sincere
[16:49] and you have been given power to buy any
[16:51] mamba is trusting me he wasn't told if
[16:54] you're being said if you be sincere
[16:57] you will get power
[16:58] he said you have been given power
[17:00] but the emotions here so as we get
[17:03] closer to the top
[17:05] as we get closer to the cap as we get
[17:08] closer to where we belong where we're
[17:09] supposed to be
[17:11] i believe in all my heart that they have
[17:13] to be
[17:14] a genuine heart experience towards god
[17:17] not head
[17:18] we're talking about heart
[17:20] you see it has to be a word from you as
[17:23] it was in your heart what does your
[17:25] heart feel you're here tonight to be
[17:27] edified to be strengthened
[17:29] um we're not here to rebuke you water or
[17:32] to bless you you are we are here that
[17:35] you your lives could be encouraged
[17:37] we live in a stressful time
[17:39] you know when when i was young much
[17:41] younger i i wanted to be a doctor to
[17:43] help humanity i felt that was my calling
[17:46] to help and assist i personally find
[17:48] life is very stressful life is very hard
[17:51] and i don't understand the sense and try
[17:54] to make life harder for others i feel as
[17:57] a christian as a believer as a soul or a
[18:00] fearing stranger in this world i feel
[18:02] that
[18:03] we ought to try to help people and make
[18:06] the lord a little lighter what can i do
[18:08] to make somebody else load lighter what
[18:10] can i do to encourage your feet
[18:13] that's why i don't like to dwell too
[18:14] much on the negatives or we could give
[18:17] warnings
[18:18] but on falseness and and all kind of
[18:21] hypocrisy and whatnot we try to stick
[18:23] with the true dollar the real dollar the
[18:24] original dollar which tried to do that
[18:26] so tonight just before
[18:28] our speaker comes i want to read a
[18:30] scripture for you and this scripture is
[18:32] from
[18:33] sin john chapter 14.
[18:35] i want to read just to find it let's
[18:37] read it it's familiar scriptures but i
[18:38] want to bring something to you tonight
[18:40] before we continue and this scripture is
[18:42] in john 14 15 to 21 this is jesus
[18:45] speaking
[18:46] he said if you love me keep my
[18:48] commandments this is in red and i will
[18:50] pray the father he will give you another
[18:53] comforter that he may abide with you
[18:55] forever
[18:56] and then
[18:58] in verse 17 jesus translates in the
[19:01] comforter even
[19:02] the spirit of truth
[19:04] now
[19:05] not just truth
[19:07] but he identifying not just word but the
[19:10] spirit of truth as a comforter whom the
[19:13] world cannot receive
[19:15] so you if you're in a holy spirit a
[19:17] worthy atmosphere you can't get this
[19:20] this is not for the world even the
[19:21] spirit of truth who can't receive
[19:24] because it sees him not he annoyed him
[19:27] but you know him for he dwelleth with
[19:29] you and shall be in you
[19:32] so god
[19:33] comfort was the pillar of fire above
[19:35] israel
[19:36] when they look up they were comforted to
[19:38] know that god is what was with them the
[19:41] night you saw a pillar of fire in the
[19:43] day you saw a cloud so as you move
[19:46] regardless of the enemies all around you
[19:48] know once that cloud is moving
[19:50] once that fire is moving god is moving
[19:52] with you that was god above us in the
[19:55] father
[19:56] and when the word became flesh
[19:58] in the person of jesus christ that was
[20:00] god with us
[20:01] but god want to come in us so jesus in
[20:04] verse 18 continues i will not leave you
[20:06] comfortless i will come to you you have
[20:09] no pastor there you have no evangelist
[20:11] there you have no prophet or apostle
[20:13] there i will not leave you comfortless i
[20:15] will come to you yet a little while and
[20:18] the world see at me no more but you see
[20:21] me you see me because i leave chalice
[20:23] also and then he prophesies at that day
[20:26] he shall know
[20:27] that i am in my father
[20:29] ye and me
[20:30] and i in you he that had my commandments
[20:33] and keeped them hated that love at me
[20:36] and he that loved me shall be loved of
[20:38] my father and i will love him i will
[20:41] manifest myself to him so jesus clearly
[20:44] tell them told these disciples okay
[20:46] the comforter is now with you which was
[20:50] the word made flesh jesus standing with
[20:52] them he said but this comforter will
[20:54] come into you and how they're going to
[20:56] be if you love me you keep my
[20:59] commandments
[21:00] and he loveth me shall be loved by my
[21:02] father i will love him and will manifest
[21:05] myself to him there is no evangelist
[21:07] dear there's no pastor prophet teacher
[21:09] there and will manifest myself to him
[21:12] now that is in john
[21:14] chapter 14. now in john 15 one verse
[21:17] there was 26 jesus said
[21:20] and when the comforter is come
[21:22] prophecy
[21:24] whom the father will send unto where
[21:26] whom i will send unto you from the
[21:29] father
[21:31] even the spirit of truth which proceeded
[21:33] from the father
[21:34] he
[21:35] shall testify of me
[21:37] so he is saying
[21:39] the spirit will always bear witness of
[21:42] the word the spirit will give witness of
[21:45] jesus christ the word
[21:46] okay we come to the final one
[21:49] i believe in john 16
[21:52] and this is jesus speaking these things
[21:53] have i spoken unto you
[21:55] that you should not be offended
[21:57] they shall put you out of the synagogues
[22:00] ye the time cometh whosoever killed you
[22:03] will think
[22:04] that he did god's service
[22:06] so jesus was prophesying dread times
[22:08] come in and they will actually think by
[22:10] killing you they're doing god's service
[22:12] and these things will they do unto you
[22:14] because they have not known the father
[22:16] nor me
[22:18] but these things have i told you that
[22:20] when the time shall come you may
[22:22] remember that i told you of them and
[22:25] these things i said unto you
[22:27] i said not unto you at the beginning
[22:30] because i was with you so jesus was
[22:32] saying certain things i didn't say at
[22:34] the beginning because i'm here
[22:35] but now i'm going so i have to tell you
[22:38] these things
[22:39] who is five but now i go my way to him
[22:41] that sent me and none of you asked me
[22:43] whatever is done but because i have said
[22:46] these things unto you saurod filled your
[22:48] heart
[22:49] nevertheless i tell you the truth is
[22:51] expedient it is necessary
[22:54] it is absolutely compulsory that for you
[22:56] that i go away for if i go not away the
[23:00] comforter will not come unto you but if
[23:04] i depart i will send him unto you and
[23:07] when he is come he will reprove the will
[23:09] of sin
[23:10] and of righteousness and of judgment
[23:12] when he comes he will convict and
[23:14] convince the world and bring
[23:15] demonstration to it about sin about
[23:18] righteousness and so on i see amplified
[23:20] verse night of sin because they believe
[23:22] not on me of righteousness because i go
[23:26] to my father and you see me no more of
[23:29] judgment because the prince of this
[23:32] world is judged
[23:33] i have yet many things to say unto you
[23:35] but you cannot bear them now i'll be it
[23:38] so he's prophesying listen man there's
[23:41] stuff you need to know but you can't get
[23:43] them now
[23:44] but how be it when he a person
[23:47] the spirit of truth is come he will
[23:50] guide you into all truth
[23:53] for he
[23:54] shall not speak
[23:56] of himself
[23:58] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[24:01] he speak
[24:02] and he will show you things to come
[24:05] and this is the verse i want to get to
[24:08] he
[24:09] shall glorify me
[24:11] for he shall receive of mine
[24:14] and shall show it unto you
[24:16] you see that little word there those
[24:19] four
[24:20] words
[24:21] he
[24:22] shall glorify me
[24:24] that mean
[24:26] the real holy spirit
[24:29] will
[24:30] glorify jesus christ
[24:32] let me say it again the real holy spirit
[24:36] so in other words
[24:37] glory
[24:38] cannot go to some man some message pope
[24:41] some bishop some pastor and and and so
[24:44] on glory go into some man this is
[24:46] humanity oh and what not that cannot be
[24:49] right
[24:50] this is what jesus identifying you know
[24:53] as the spirit of truth he says he shall
[24:56] glorify me for he shall receive of mine
[24:59] and shall show it unto you all things
[25:02] that the father had a mind therefore
[25:03] said i he shall take of mine and shall
[25:06] show it unto you a little while you
[25:08] shall see me not see me again a little
[25:10] while you shall see me because i go to
[25:12] my father then said some recitals among
[25:15] themselves what is this that he said
[25:17] unto us a little while shall i see not
[25:19] see me and again a little while he shall
[25:21] see me because i go to the father
[25:24] then said he therefore what is this that
[25:25] he said a little while we cannot tell
[25:27] what he said now jesus knew
[25:30] that they were desires to ask him and
[25:31] said unto them do you inquire among
[25:33] yourselves of what i said a little while
[25:36] and you shall not see me and again a
[25:38] little while you shall see me verily i
[25:40] send to you prophecy
[25:43] that he shall reap and lament his
[25:44] prophecy unto them and the world shall
[25:46] rejoice
[25:47] and he shall be sorrowful but your
[25:49] sorrow shall be turned into joy
[25:52] a woman when she is in travail to sorrow
[25:56] because her hour is come
[25:57] but soon as she's delivered of the child
[26:00] she remember it no more the anguish for
[26:03] joy that a man is born into the world
[26:06] and ye know therefore of sorrow but i
[26:08] will see you again and your heart shall
[26:10] rejoice and your joy no man take it from
[26:13] you and in that day
[26:15] he's prophesying to them again you shall
[26:17] ask me nothing very like unto you
[26:19] whatsoever you shall ask the father in
[26:21] my name he will give it to you hitherto
[26:24] he asks nothing in my name ask and you
[26:26] shall receive that your joy may be full
[26:29] these things have i spoken unto you and
[26:31] proverbs but a time comment when i shall
[26:34] no more speak to you in proverbs i shall
[26:36] assure you plainly of the father
[26:39] that day you shall ask in my name i say
[26:41] not unto you that i will pray the father
[26:43] for you for the father love at you
[26:46] because you have loved me and i believe
[26:48] that i came out from god i comfort from
[26:51] the father and i'm coming to the world
[26:53] again i leave the world to go to the
[26:56] father
[26:57] and then his disciples tell them law
[26:59] those speakers so plainly no speakers
[27:01] don't play me and speakers no proverb no
[27:04] we are sure that don't know use all
[27:06] things and it is not that any man should
[27:08] ask thee
[27:09] by this we believe the dog came as
[27:11] fought from god
[27:12] jesus answered them do you not believe
[27:15] he said behold our comment he is now
[27:17] come
[27:18] that he shall be scattered every man to
[27:20] his own and shall leave me alone and yet
[27:22] i am not alone because my father is with
[27:24] me these things i have spoken unto you
[27:27] in me that in me you might have peace in
[27:31] the world you shall have tribulation be
[27:33] of good cheer
[27:34] have overcome the world may god add a
[27:37] blessing to read a word isn't that a
[27:38] lovely scripture reading tonight
[27:40] oh my god jesus own words in red
[27:43] and um
[27:45] just two more quotes and we'll close
[27:46] here and be afraid
[27:48] but a brown
[27:50] that is why
[27:52] no man can ever come along and say the
[27:54] holy man is a pope
[27:56] or the holy man is a bishop or priest
[27:59] the holy man is christ
[28:01] the holy spirit in us how dare the
[28:03] hierarchy declare
[28:05] the lady has no word to say
[28:07] each one
[28:09] has something to see
[28:11] each has a work
[28:13] each has a ministry the holy ghost came
[28:16] at pentecost
[28:18] and separated himself on each that it
[28:21] might be fulfilled where if christ said
[28:23] at that day you shall know that i am in
[28:25] my father he and me i am you
[28:28] the great i am the almighty god has come
[28:31] a spirit
[28:32] to fill his true church
[28:34] he has a right here we go he has a right
[28:36] to move anywhere he wants to
[28:39] and upon anybody he wants to let me read
[28:42] that again he has a right to move
[28:46] anywhere he wants to and upon anybody he
[28:49] wants to we don't make any holy men
[28:52] among us
[28:53] but the whole
[28:54] true
[28:55] congregation of the lord is holy because
[28:58] of the presence of the holy spirit it is
[29:02] he
[29:03] the holy spirit
[29:05] that is holy
[29:06] not the congregation of itself and
[29:08] finally this is a harvest time that
[29:11] previous quote was from revelation of
[29:13] jesus christ
[29:14] but jesus said
[29:16] when he the spirit of truth is come
[29:19] see
[29:20] he will bring these things that i have
[29:22] taught to your memory the word
[29:25] he will also show you things to come
[29:27] there is the real spirit-filled church
[29:29] now stays with the word
[29:31] reflects the word god on earth see he
[29:34] doesn't need any theologian because his
[29:36] word is of no private interpretation
[29:39] he interprets his own word by
[29:41] vindicating it
[29:42] and proving
[29:43] it's the truth oh let's give the lord a
[29:46] hand to pray
[29:48] scriptures for the word from the prophet
[29:51] o blessed be the name of the lord so we
[29:54] are grateful tonight we have among us
[29:56] tonight
[29:57] brother lino tirado
[29:59] i um he translates
[30:01] in spanish as you know he came to
[30:03] trinidad and he was here in a convention
[30:06] and we worked together in argentina in
[30:08] chile
[30:09] a couple other places
[30:12] and i'm grateful to have him here
[30:13] tonight
[30:14] um over the time he has shared so many
[30:16] testimonies with me that
[30:18] i at the time we never had this platform
[30:21] or this opportunity and i always felt
[30:24] that if given the chance he should be
[30:26] able to share
[30:28] you know what's up on his heart
[30:30] and and and that will be able to bless
[30:32] god's people everywhere
[30:33] i believe a testimony is something to
[30:36] give witness of god
[30:37] so far we had about three or so
[30:40] sessions of testimonies and i believe
[30:42] people were edified strengthened
[30:44] and built up with it and i believe it
[30:46] will continue on tonight in a special
[30:48] way i know that
[30:50] lino is a brother who loves the lord and
[30:53] fire for god and has a burden for the
[30:56] spanish side of this message uh spanish
[30:59] language people who
[31:01] they were short on the books short of
[31:03] the translated books in spanish
[31:05] and you know we have to have that burden
[31:08] and just as i read where brother madam
[31:11] says
[31:12] how dear people say that the lady have
[31:14] no see you as an individual have no see
[31:16] each one of them ministry each one have
[31:18] a calling and to me
[31:20] this is what you have to begin to see
[31:23] i may have a calling as a pastor and
[31:26] and shepherd and to preach the word and
[31:28] so on but it's no different calling from
[31:31] you as a believer to believe and to
[31:34] receive and to act upon the word of god
[31:37] this comforter is not for the pastor
[31:39] only this comforter is for the entire
[31:41] body of jesus christ all that was
[31:43] important to god important to christ all
[31:45] of us in christ he poured into the
[31:47] church the church is not pastor teacher
[31:48] prophet evangelist that is a ministry
[31:51] that god will use to get things to his
[31:54] people and is not about glorifying these
[31:57] men or glorifying their ministries but
[32:00] is actually
[32:01] their their dear for your benefit for
[32:04] the perfection of the saints for the
[32:05] work of the ministry for the defining of
[32:07] the body so the whole burden of god
[32:10] is to get to his people he sent one man
[32:13] moses and he moses after so much a
[32:16] pressure god put the spirit and other
[32:18] men to share that burden and life itself
[32:21] is a burden and tonight adeline is here
[32:24] to share
[32:25] in this burden of the word and this
[32:27] burden of the lord to share so he could
[32:29] introduce himself and and testify about
[32:32] you know the lord and so on i want to
[32:34] get it over to him because we give the
[32:36] lord some praises oh and bless his name
[32:39] praise be to jesus blessed be the name
[32:41] of the lord
[32:42] hallelujah thank you lord
[32:44] thank you lord but as i could okay i'm
[32:47] seeing him now
[32:48] so we tonight we just want to welcome
[32:51] brother lino
[32:52] should we get into unmute
[32:56] amen amen amen
[32:58] god bless you my brother go right ahead
[33:00] praise god amen it's an honor and a
[33:03] privilege
[33:04] to come before you
[33:06] and
[33:07] lift up the name of the lord jesus
[33:09] christ
[33:11] the thing that he has done in my life
[33:14] they are all to glorify him
[33:17] i wish i can take credit but it's all
[33:20] him doing it and i'm so grateful that he
[33:23] has done it in my life and i'm very
[33:26] happy that he has done it in my life
[33:29] i mean
[33:30] um
[33:32] uh usually when no people fill out an
[33:34] application they they usually tell you
[33:37] um
[33:38] where was you born or where do you come
[33:41] from
[33:42] well my spiritual life
[33:44] uh it started in
[33:47] new york city the local christian
[33:49] assembly
[33:50] and uh
[33:52] me and my family my dad we were eight
[33:55] all together
[33:56] and um
[33:58] and it's a testimony in itself the way
[34:00] we got there
[34:02] but i just wanted to move up
[34:05] uh a further to for for the sake of time
[34:09] um
[34:10] me and my friend my dad and my mom we
[34:13] all visited the church
[34:16] and uh um
[34:18] i was going to church because i wanted
[34:21] to obey my dad
[34:23] and uh
[34:24] i i had an understanding that my daddy
[34:27] paid the bills
[34:29] he fed me
[34:31] uh he took care of me and he had a home
[34:34] for me
[34:34] and i said well the best thing i can do
[34:37] is to obey him
[34:39] so when he said let's go to church i go
[34:41] to church sunday and wednesday
[34:44] and when there were special services
[34:47] through the years just obey my dad but i
[34:50] did have something against my daddy
[34:53] uh it was kind of like a hatred
[34:56] because he gave me a spanking when i was
[34:58] a child that he almost killed me
[35:01] and i always carried that in my heart so
[35:04] every time i hear his voice then call
[35:05] the church there was something
[35:08] but i i de-obey and i went
[35:11] so going to church hallelujah
[35:14] the local christian assembly in new york
[35:17] um
[35:18] one day uh got7 preached a message
[35:23] and i didn't understand the message
[35:25] being a young person but i couldn't get
[35:28] away from the title of the message
[35:31] now the title of the message was i give
[35:33] you a new heart
[35:35] and i'll give you a new spirit
[35:37] so i went home as a young person and i
[35:40] began to think on the title
[35:43] and i began to think like nicodemus i
[35:46] said lord how are you going to do that
[35:50] are you going to come from heaven
[35:52] you're going to come down here you're
[35:54] going to bring a knife you're going to
[35:56] cut my heart take this one out i'm
[36:00] putting you in
[36:02] so i i went by myself
[36:04] talking to the lord and i said how are
[36:07] you gonna do that
[36:08] and then they say that they cannot see
[36:11] you how are you going to do that
[36:15] so i waited i waited order suddenly i
[36:18] got up from my chair
[36:20] and i stayed like this and i said okay
[36:24] i wanted it
[36:26] so i looked to my left
[36:28] i looked to my right i said i wanted it
[36:32] i wanted it
[36:34] and i waited and i waited when honestly
[36:37] suddenly
[36:38] a presence came
[36:41] and that present wrapped me up
[36:44] and literally
[36:45] that present took me up to the ceiling
[36:48] in a
[36:49] slow motion
[36:51] and i begin to go up and then come down
[36:55] i said to myself
[36:57] what is happening
[37:00] so and as soon as i touch the floor
[37:04] just like a little button
[37:07] something inside began to turn
[37:11] it was a joy unspeakable
[37:15] and
[37:16] incontrollable
[37:18] i hurt myself
[37:21] and i began to say oh
[37:23] oh
[37:25] oh
[37:26] and i hugged myself i run towards the
[37:30] house and i fell down
[37:32] i rolled over i got up i kept on running
[37:37] i'm hogging myself
[37:39] oh
[37:40] oh
[37:41] finally i went to my room
[37:44] and i nailed down
[37:46] pick and and as soon as i down i raised
[37:50] my head and i said lord
[37:52] what happened here
[37:54] please
[37:56] don't let never let me forget what
[37:59] happened over here
[38:01] and as i'm trying to understand i laid
[38:04] down i began to pray for hours and hours
[38:09] after a while my family began to come
[38:12] into the house
[38:14] and when i heard the voice of my
[38:16] daddy i run to my dad
[38:20] i throw myself on my daddy
[38:23] and i hug him
[38:25] and i said daddy i love you

[38:30] i miss you i love you daddy i love you
[38:35] i love you they my daddy tag me on the
[38:38] sh
[38:39] on the back i said boy what's wrong with
[38:41] you what's wrong with you
[38:43] so when my daddy touched me i looked to
[38:46] heaven and i said
[38:48] you did it
[38:50] i'm telling my daughter that i love him
[38:54] and that was the beginning
[38:56] of my life
[38:58] now i was just finishing high school
[39:03] and
[39:04] in high school
[39:06] i was a good baseball player
[39:09] and i was
[39:10] one of the best
[39:14] we beat all the high school on baseball
[39:18] and the rumor went abroad
[39:21] and even went to the scout of the major
[39:23] league los angeles dodgers
[39:26] and they came to see us play
[39:29] and it was the time when i did the most
[39:32] spectacular play ever
[39:35] and he told my coach i want that boy
[39:39] i want him
[39:40] so my coach called me to the office

[40:20] so the lord gave me a new heart
[40:23] and gave me a new spirit
[40:26] oh and i fell in love with god
[40:29] i developed a habit of praying
[40:32] i read my bible i read all the books
[40:36] that have been published by bro abraham
[40:39] and it was a
[40:41] a love of a falling in love with god

[40:50] new uh know me i went to college
[40:54] and in college i was supposed to major
[40:57] in biology

[41:56] and i was able to see hell
[41:58] in the book
[42:00] and in that hell i saw somebody trying
[42:04] to get out of it
[42:06] and when i saw the person i recognized

[46:56] voice again

[47:14] mom's room my mom had a stroke
[47:17] her arm was twisted
[47:19] her lip was twisted and she was on the
[47:22] floor
[47:23] and as soon as i came in
[47:25] or remember laying on my shoulder and as

[47:40] jesus name or the son of the arm just
[47:43] straighten up on her lip straighten up
[47:46] and mama got up
[47:48] lift up her hands and she began to
[47:50] praise god all over the house
[47:53] oh i fallen i fell in love with god even
[47:56] more
[47:58] hallelujah
[47:59] and then a
[48:01] couple of monks passed by
[48:05] and then i'm on my job
[48:07] and because i developed a habit of
[48:10] prayer
[48:11] even on my job
[48:13] on my breakdown i'm in my lunch time i
[48:16] had to hide myself
[48:18] in a second story building and just to
[48:22] pray
[48:23] just to talk with the lord
[48:25] and uh
[48:26] and i remember one time
[48:29] my supervisor he had a a slight heart
[48:32] attack the ambulance came and the
[48:35] ambulance took him
[48:37] and the doctor told him water
[48:40] the next time
[48:43] you will come in you're not gonna make
[48:45] it you have to stop smoking
[48:48] or you're not going to make it the next
[48:50] time
[48:51] so my supervisor brought a jar of candy
[48:55] into the office so every time he feel
[48:58] the pool of smoke he'd take a candy but
[49:02] one time he got rebuked from the office
[49:05] and he forgot about the candy and he was
[49:08] almost two or three packs a day he was
[49:11] just smoking like a chimney
[49:14] one day i i i was eating my lunch
[49:18] and i was eating my lunch
[49:20] uh
[49:21] the spirit of the lord he come back
[49:23] again
[49:25] and he spoke for the third time in my
[49:27] life i heard his voice and i said lino
[49:32] go to walter
[49:34] and tell him that the only way he could
[49:37] to stop smoking is by me and by me alone
[49:42] i say oh lord if you tell my boss about
[49:46] christ he probably fired me
[49:50] i said lord the doctor told him
[49:54] so he's supposed to know he's about to
[49:56] stop smoking because they tried to call
[49:58] him
[49:59] so about two or three minutes passed by
[50:02] the void came back again i said lino
[50:05] tell walter
[50:07] that the only way he's gonna stop
[50:09] smoking is by me and mia look
[50:13] now his supervisor is with him
[50:17] father
[50:18] the doctor told him
[50:20] so a little time passed by
[50:23] the voice came by the third time
[50:25] but this time
[50:27] he scared me he said if you don't go
[50:30] you will give me a count of the judgment
[50:33] day
[50:34] i don't know what happened but i drank
[50:36] my sandwich
[50:38] and i run to water
[50:40] and the anointing drop and i said walter

[50:49] is in the name of the lord jesus christ
[50:52] and him alone
[50:54] stop smoking
[50:56] now brother abraham said that
[50:58] is a demon
[51:00] so as soon as those words were spoken he
[51:03] began to scream and go from left to
[51:06] right
[51:09] and he slide down under his desk
[51:13] and i remained there and then five
[51:16] minutes later he took his head out and
[51:19] he screamed hallelujah
[51:22] he never smoked again for the glory of
[51:26] god
[51:28] and for the first time in his life he
[51:30] began to go to a church

[57:37] people and inside that cloud there was
[57:40] some of them pentecostals
[57:42] and i began to tell them
[57:44] what god is doing in the last day
[57:48] i began with the days of luther
[57:50] wesley and pentecost and what is god
[57:54] doing today

[1:08:59] you have given him a new opportunity in
[1:09:03] the name of jesus i rebuke the spirit of
[1:09:06] death upon this man for the glory of god
[1:09:11] and next day the men totally healed
[1:09:14] and the men screamed in the emergency
[1:09:17] room we're going home i'm totally free
[1:09:22] let that your man pray for you and
[1:09:25] everybody look around who is that young
[1:09:27] man for the glory of god
[1:09:31] the men went home
[1:09:33] they know the suddenly another emergency
[1:09:36] and the king of doctor come and they
[1:09:38] bring the bad news to the family
[1:09:42] now this family hallelujah
[1:09:45] they have a pentecostal family in there
[1:09:50] so when i came over i got so happy i
[1:09:53] said oh lord they are believers
[1:09:57] we can unite our faith
[1:09:59] amen and
[1:10:01] break the joke and whatever we're bound
[1:10:04] in heaven will be bound on
[1:10:07] bound in love will be bound in heaven
[1:10:10] so when i came to them
[1:10:13] the pentecostal say
[1:10:15] why pray
[1:10:16] god's gonna take it home
[1:10:18] i said oh
[1:10:20] i didn't expect that answer
[1:10:22] but then i replied but there's nothing
[1:10:24] too hard for the lord
[1:10:26] and then the reply back but he already
[1:10:29] lives here
[1:10:30] i said i'm sorry it's okay god bless you
[1:10:33] but as i was leaving the wife is a
[1:10:36] catholic
[1:10:37] and i heard when she told the nurse i
[1:10:40] said he will only take a
[1:10:43] when i heard that
[1:10:45] i said
[1:10:46] excuse me lady
[1:10:48] you say it will only take a minute i
[1:10:50] said yes
[1:10:52] so you believe in god i said yes
[1:10:55] do you manifest pray
[1:10:57] oh she got so happy
[1:11:00] and then the pentecostal got upset i
[1:11:02] said lord i don't understand
[1:11:06] so i put the gown now when i went to
[1:11:08] this man hallelujah he had so many
[1:11:11] machines hook up onto him one for the
[1:11:14] long
[1:11:15] one for the kidney one for the
[1:11:18] to breathe and one for the heart
[1:11:21] but i said the same prayer lord jesus
[1:11:25] give this man one more chance that when
[1:11:27] he leave this place
[1:11:29] he might be able to tell other what you
[1:11:32] have done i rebuke the spirit of death
[1:11:36] upon this man for the glory of god
[1:11:39] so the next day hallelujah they start to
[1:11:42] come to the emergency room and say
[1:11:44] lady
[1:11:45] we had to unhook one of the machines
[1:11:48] because the kidney started working and
[1:11:51] the little lady jumped the prayer the
[1:11:54] prayer
[1:11:55] the prayer

[1:11:59] i said no lady we already prayed no no
[1:12:02] no no let's pray again
[1:12:04] so we pray again and then the next day
[1:12:06] the doctor came back and said look
[1:12:09] the loan started working and we have to
[1:12:11] unhook another machine
[1:12:14] and the lady jumper said the prayer that
[1:12:16] prayer let's go pray again i said no
[1:12:19] lady we already prayed no no no let's go
[1:12:22] pray and we pray again and to make it
[1:12:25] short
[1:12:26] i was able to speak with this man
[1:12:29] with no machine hook up
[1:12:32] sitting on his bed
[1:12:34] and the next day ready to go home
[1:12:38] totally healed
[1:12:40] hallelujah
[1:12:42] oh for the glory of god

[1:12:57] he had a heart attack and he died
[1:13:01] oh

[1:13:03] i spent almost an entire day praying and
[1:13:06] crying
[1:13:07] i'm a prayer what just one word lord why
[1:13:12] he was going home
[1:13:15] and after seeking the lord the lord in
[1:13:18] his grace and mercy he's come down and
[1:13:22] he said leno
[1:13:23] i was calling him home
[1:13:25] but you were standing on the way i said
[1:13:28] oh lord i never pray again for nobody i
[1:13:32] am sorry no
[1:13:34] i never pray again for nobody
[1:13:37] so i came back to the emergency room
[1:13:40] and the rumor spread that's the young
[1:13:43] man
[1:13:44] and i said i'm sorry i'm not praying for
[1:13:46] nobody ah that's it i'm not praying for
[1:13:48] the body about two or three or four days
[1:13:51] passed by
[1:13:52] and then the scripture was quickened
[1:13:55] now they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:13:58] they shall recover
[1:13:59] i said lord you cannot take the
[1:14:02] scripture away from the bible it is
[1:14:05] written
[1:14:06] you wrote it
[1:14:07] i said yes lord
[1:14:10] and then i said but what is wrong
[1:14:12] then i say oh i must change my way of
[1:14:16] praying
[1:14:17] and then i said lord if it is your will
[1:14:20] for this man to live give him one more
[1:14:23] chance
[1:14:24] oh and i felt the peace of god and i say
[1:14:27] okay lord i'm ready now order suddenly
[1:14:31] i'm not emergency or for the glory of
[1:14:33] god
[1:14:34] but it happened almost five times
[1:14:38] in that area that even the norse
[1:14:40] came and told me lino
[1:14:43] would you work for the hospital
[1:14:45] and help these people i say i'll be here
[1:14:49] until my daddy is here
[1:14:52] and for the glory of god
[1:14:54] my daddy came out
[1:14:56] and he lived two years totally healthy
[1:14:59] and healed
[1:15:01] but then
[1:15:02] my daddy had an accident
[1:15:04] and uh
[1:15:06] when he had that accident
[1:15:08] uh
[1:15:09] my family told me oh lino
[1:15:12] the doctor said that there's nothing
[1:15:14] they can do
[1:15:16] i smile i said do you know how many time
[1:15:20] i heard that there's nothing the doctor
[1:15:22] can do
[1:15:23] but my god can do everything
[1:15:26] so finally
[1:15:28] to make the
[1:15:29] the testimony short
[1:15:31] my daddy
[1:15:33] passed
[1:15:34] and uh
[1:15:37] god took him home
[1:15:39] now thou really
[1:15:41] shook my faith
[1:15:43] i could not
[1:15:45] praise the lord i couldn't see what
[1:15:48] almighty god was sir because every time
[1:15:51] i sing it i look up to her and i said
[1:15:54] lord
[1:15:55] you said the almighty god
[1:15:57] oh you let my daddy go
[1:16:00] you said oh you're powerful
[1:16:02] boy you let my daddy go
[1:16:04] for months my faith was
[1:16:07] shaken
[1:16:10] and one day there was another emergency
[1:16:13] in the family
[1:16:14] there was a a a close friend of ours
[1:16:18] that developed a tumor on the left side
[1:16:21] and the doctor said we have to operate
[1:16:25] as an emergency because it's growing too
[1:16:28] fast
[1:16:30] so the operation was on a friday but
[1:16:33] then on that thursday night they say
[1:16:35] call by the linos let's gather the
[1:16:38] believer and let's have a word of prayer
[1:16:40] for our sister
[1:16:42] i couldn't pray
[1:16:44] but i looked up to heaven and i said
[1:16:46] lord
[1:16:47] i bet you couldn't hear her
[1:16:50] but he couldn't do nothing for my dad
[1:16:53] so we prayed for the lady they let it go
[1:16:56] for surgery on friday
[1:16:58] and the doctor couldn't find the tumor
[1:17:01] oh he shook my face even more
[1:17:05] i said you sing lord
[1:17:07] but he couldn't do nothing for my daddy
[1:17:10] so
[1:17:12] another two or three week time pass by
[1:17:14] and still my faith is
[1:17:16] shaking
[1:17:18] there's another emergency
[1:17:20] in the family and this time is a close
[1:17:23] friend of ours
[1:17:25] and this person is illegal in the state
[1:17:28] has no drivers like he's driving had no
[1:17:31] driver's license has no insurance in the
[1:17:34] car and then it's illegal don't speak
[1:17:37] english had no short nothing
[1:17:40] and she crashed a car
[1:17:43] and the accident belonged to a uh uh
[1:17:47] a young man
[1:17:49] that a family job bought a brand new car

[1:17:54] and she ate the red light no troubles
[1:17:56] license no insurance illegal she had

[1:18:02] so the policeman came
[1:18:04] and said to the lady you gotta go and
[1:18:07] face the judge
[1:18:09] so the day before that call by the
[1:18:12] leader
[1:18:13] god of the believer

[1:19:31] and i renew my faith and my love
[1:19:34] back to god
[1:19:36] i said lord let thy will be done then i

[1:25:48] left but anyway so as time went by and
[1:25:51] the lord began to open doors
[1:25:54] uh so i went to to fellowship with them
[1:25:57] i love that brother so i believe i spent
[1:26:00] five years with him and uh uh by the
[1:26:03] grace of god from that day on
[1:26:06] i visit 22 countries
[1:26:09] and each one of them has a testimony
[1:26:12] hallelujah now
[1:26:15] something beautiful happened in that
[1:26:17] church
[1:26:18] i i believe i would love to invite a
[1:26:21] brother theo one time in miami is the
[1:26:24] miami believer tabernacle
[1:26:27] the pastor is so humble
[1:26:29] and
[1:26:30] uh
[1:26:30] and he is surrounded by a youth leader
[1:26:34] the minister
[1:26:35] a co-pastor
[1:26:37] a teacher and they made myself that i do
[1:26:40] the missionary and evangelism all over
[1:26:44] so every time i travel i just come home
[1:26:46] and give a report
[1:26:48] but something happened in that church
[1:26:50] hallelujah
[1:26:52] and uh there was a city that had a dream
[1:26:55] and the dream that she had was that the
[1:26:59] angel of the lord a supernatural life
[1:27:02] fall right down into the puppet
[1:27:07] and the end you had a book open
[1:27:10] and whatever your name is called you're
[1:27:12] supposed to come up to the pulpit
[1:27:15] and the enemy will give you a piece of
[1:27:17] paper and then you're supposed to go and
[1:27:19] sit down
[1:27:20] so the sister in this church when she
[1:27:23] heard her name
[1:27:24] she came up
[1:27:25] and the angel gave her a piece of paper
[1:27:28] but what she was sitting down
[1:27:31] she wanted to see what was in the piece
[1:27:33] of paper so when she cannot look and she
[1:27:36] looked down
[1:27:37] she only saw three and a half
[1:27:42] so and she gave the dream to the pastor
[1:27:45] so the pastor don't know

[1:27:56] i do not know what it is but i want to
[1:27:59] share it with you
[1:28:01] so you go and pray and see what the lord
[1:28:05] will tell you
[1:28:07] that he's such a humble pastor and i
[1:28:09] love him dearly
[1:28:11] when you

[1:28:43] the grace of god and i'm thanking for
[1:28:46] that
[1:28:47] seven messages
[1:28:49] so when i'm done
[1:28:50] uh i didn't tell him nothing about it
[1:28:53] but in that church he said berlino uh
[1:28:56] where we spoke about the three and a
[1:28:57] half i shared with the church would you
[1:29:00] come and speak to us
[1:29:02] so i spoke seven times
[1:29:06] and he didn't know
[1:29:08] that i didn't have no more
[1:29:10] so he went immediately to the other
[1:29:13] brother now you speak
[1:29:15] now this is what i want to share with
[1:29:17] you
[1:29:19] there was another
[1:29:20] sister church in the area
[1:29:23] and the pastor in that church had an
[1:29:25] emergency
[1:29:27] he had to leave the country with the
[1:29:29] entire family
[1:29:31] so he called my pastor and he said
[1:29:35] do you have anybody
[1:29:37] that can take over my church until i
[1:29:39] come back it's only about three months
[1:29:42] and the pastor said yes to the leader
[1:29:44] will help you on that
[1:29:46] so as i went over there
[1:29:48] i brought the same thing i spoke over
[1:29:51] here
[1:29:52] now
[1:29:54] one of the messages
[1:29:56] that uh i was supposed to follow to make
[1:29:58] it short
[1:29:59] it was hallelujah uh
[1:30:03] the rapture of the church are you ready
[1:30:07] now
[1:30:08] i spoke one two three four five times
[1:30:12] and the next message was the rapture of
[1:30:14] the church
[1:30:15] but something was happening in the
[1:30:17] church
[1:30:18] i prayed to the lord i said lord
[1:30:20] i need to change my message because i
[1:30:23] want to help the believer
[1:30:26] and i pray and i didn't get no answer
[1:30:28] monday tuesday wednesday thursday and
[1:30:31] friday
[1:30:33] and then on saturday i said well lord i
[1:30:36] didn't hear from you i believe it is
[1:30:38] okay
[1:30:40] to change the message of the rapture to
[1:30:43] to help the believer or something was
[1:30:46] going on in the congregation
[1:30:49] but on saturday now i am a mailman
[1:30:52] but all through the week
[1:30:55] or through the week
[1:30:57] i have a building of 16th floor
[1:31:00] and
[1:31:01] that building each floor has different
[1:31:04] offices
[1:31:05] and each offices receive a lot of mail
[1:31:09] and oh the majority of those mail is
[1:31:13] critical payment mortgage payment and
[1:31:16] some kind of payment
[1:31:19] now all through the week and having a
[1:31:22] rough time with one letter
[1:31:24] that a person forgot to put
[1:31:28] the sweet number or the office number
[1:31:32] and to make it worse it didn't put a
[1:31:34] return address
[1:31:36] so i'm going
[1:31:38] floyd my floor
[1:31:40] for all through the week is this little
[1:31:43] europe no is this little you no
[1:31:46] now in the post office when we find
[1:31:49] something like that
[1:31:50] we supposed to cancel it
[1:31:52] and then because it has no return
[1:31:55] address it go to a room called
[1:31:58] death letter
[1:32:00] and he stay there there's an old man
[1:32:03] with all his special
[1:32:05] when he get a chance he opened one of
[1:32:07] the letters to see
[1:32:08] if they can send it back
[1:32:10] now in my conscience
[1:32:14] the postman is trained to keep the
[1:32:17] sanctity of the mail
[1:32:19] in other words we are not supposed to
[1:32:21] open none of the mail
[1:32:23] but i'm having
[1:32:25] a mind battle because i know that letter
[1:32:28] is a payment
[1:32:30] somebody make a payment and it's not
[1:32:32] going to make it on time
[1:32:34] i say oh lord and i want to help this
[1:32:36] person and i'm thinking perhaps the
[1:32:39] person was in a rush
[1:32:41] i forgot to put
[1:32:43] the office number
[1:32:45] so i waited all through the week
[1:32:48] but on saturday i said well lord i
[1:32:50] checked all the offices
[1:32:52] and this letter
[1:32:54] does not belong to anybody
[1:32:57] i said don't forgive me but i'm going to
[1:33:00] open it
[1:33:01] just to make sure that i'm help somebody
[1:33:04] so his payment will not be late now
[1:33:08] saturday i made up my mind also to
[1:33:11] change the message for sunday
[1:33:14] because i want to help the congregation
[1:33:16] but when i opened the letter
[1:33:20] it was not a payment
[1:33:23] the letter says
[1:33:25] the coming of the lord is at him
[1:33:29] i want you to encourage my people with
[1:33:32] this word force testing responsive 416
[1:33:38] i said what
[1:33:40] this letter was for me
[1:33:43] how can this thing happen
[1:33:46] and i didn't change the message
[1:33:48] i preached the rapture
[1:33:50] hallelujah
[1:33:52] oh what a mighty god we serve that knows
[1:33:56] everything
[1:33:59] now a week pass
[1:34:01] and when that will pass and some became
[1:34:04] i said well lord
[1:34:07] i don't have no more letters
[1:34:09] so i i hear from you all through the
[1:34:11] week today is saturday now sunday i
[1:34:14] believe i can change the last message
[1:34:18] which was the millennium
[1:34:21] or everything connected to three and a
[1:34:23] half
[1:34:24] but while us leaving the post office
[1:34:28] there was a lady that came running
[1:34:30] behind me now this lady in the post
[1:34:34] office gave me such a hard time
[1:34:37] because one time i did her route
[1:34:40] and when i finished i put i didn't know
[1:34:42] where everything was so i left it on the
[1:34:45] table so the next day when she came
[1:34:48] she said who did my route and they said
[1:34:50] leader so she came to me and opened the
[1:34:54] mouth
[1:34:55] and all the but were in the dictionary
[1:34:58] came out through the mouth
[1:35:00] sometimes inside of me began to boil but
[1:35:04] a middle of my lip i beat my lips
[1:35:12] and i humble myself when i say forgive
[1:35:14] me
[1:35:15] next time i do a better job
[1:35:18] and that lady changed
[1:35:20] her uh uh hot muffin
[1:35:22] i was just playing with you play with me
[1:35:26] anyway that lady came running
[1:35:29] i said leno
[1:35:31] don't go wait wait wait i said wow what
[1:35:34] does she want now
[1:35:36] lino yes
[1:35:37] i was listening to this song
[1:35:41] and something told me to share with you
[1:35:44] okay what is the song
[1:35:46] and when i heard the song
[1:35:49] it shook me
[1:35:50] because the song said
[1:35:53] i
[1:35:54] pray when i come
[1:35:57] they all be ready
[1:36:00] and then i said lord i'm not changing
[1:36:03] nothing
[1:36:04] i'm living the way it is i'll preach the
[1:36:07] millennium is coming
[1:36:10] oh the way god does his thing hallelujah
[1:36:18] so the pastor bless
[1:36:20] the pastor was so blessed
[1:36:23] to hear that the believers were well-fed
[1:36:26] but i never forget one thing i believe
[1:36:29] the last service on that church
[1:36:31] i came early
[1:36:33] that
[1:36:34] that sunday and i was rehearsing a song
[1:36:38] and i had to pass in front of the pulpit
[1:36:43] to go and get the instrument and
[1:36:45] rehearse it and bring him to the office
[1:36:48] so as as i passed through the pulpit
[1:36:51] nobody in the church
[1:36:55] i hear the voice of god
[1:36:57] so clearly like i heard it so many times
[1:37:01] i said little
[1:37:04] take away all of those pictures from
[1:37:06] there
[1:37:07] because today will be a standing block
[1:37:10] for somebody
[1:37:12] now i am not against picture but that's
[1:37:16] what the lord said
[1:37:18] and he had people the prime the clown
[1:37:21] jesus and many others
[1:37:24] so
[1:37:25] when i was coming back for the
[1:37:27] instrument
[1:37:29] the lord said the same thing leno
[1:37:31] take those pictures
[1:37:33] it will be a stumbling block for
[1:37:35] somebody i say oh lord
[1:37:38] uh
[1:37:39] but maybe
[1:37:41] i might be able to help somebody i can
[1:37:44] explain each one of them
[1:37:46] but i didn't obey
[1:37:48] i didn't obey
[1:37:50] so while the people started coming to
[1:37:53] the church
[1:37:54] and the church began to be full
[1:37:57] all of a suddenly i feel like somebody
[1:38:01] is
[1:38:02] having a fight
[1:38:04] it's rebuking is speaking loud
[1:38:08] and they say what's going on
[1:38:10] i said it what's happened
[1:38:12] that some of them believe a witness
[1:38:15] to somebody in the community
[1:38:17] and those people in the community they
[1:38:20] used to be idolatrous
[1:38:23] they used to worship saints full
[1:38:26] catholic
[1:38:27] and
[1:38:28] when they got converted
[1:38:30] they burned all those pictures all of
[1:38:33] the sting they burned it
[1:38:35] so when they came to church they saw the
[1:38:37] same picture
[1:38:39] and then i said
[1:38:40] you told me this was a christian church
[1:38:43] i burned all of those things
[1:38:45] wow
[1:38:46] oh did i cry
[1:38:49] i brought all the congregation
[1:38:52] and i came to the altar and i repented
[1:38:55] before the lord i said lord forgive me
[1:38:57] lord
[1:38:58] i pray that you give that person a new
[1:39:00] opportunity
[1:39:01] forgive me lord i should obey
[1:39:04] so i called the pastor from that church
[1:39:07] and i told him what happened pastor this
[1:39:10] happened
[1:39:11] and departed celino obey the lord
[1:39:14] take the spiritual away for the glory of
[1:39:17] god
[1:39:19] now
[1:39:20] as time went by so many precious things
[1:39:24] begin to happen i remember one time in
[1:39:26] this country
[1:39:28] i don't know how much time i have
[1:39:30] in this country hallelujah um it was
[1:39:34] about 11 churches i stood about two
[1:39:37] months on that country just from church
[1:39:40] and the thing that god did is so
[1:39:42] wonderful so wonderful i remember one
[1:39:46] time
[1:39:47] and there's a pastor that didn't want me
[1:39:50] to come to his church
[1:39:52] so
[1:39:53] uh he went away on vacation
[1:39:56] and the believer of that church they
[1:39:58] were hearing that's why faith comes by
[1:40:01] hearing
[1:40:02] the believer heard what was happening in
[1:40:04] that church
[1:40:05] so they called the pastor pastor would
[1:40:08] you invite brazilian
[1:40:10] to to to a church i said well i'm on
[1:40:14] vacation
[1:40:15] but
[1:40:16] as time went by
[1:40:18] the pastor investigated
[1:40:21] and uh
[1:40:22] uh
[1:40:23] he found out that i was leaving next
[1:40:25] sunday
[1:40:26] so that's something he came to church
[1:40:29] and i said well i heard brother lino is
[1:40:32] leaving
[1:40:33] sunday so i guess we'll catch him next
[1:40:36] time
[1:40:37] so when i heard that he was inquiring
[1:40:41] but i was not gonna come over to his
[1:40:43] plate because i was leaving so i
[1:40:45] cancelled my flight
[1:40:48] so when i canceled my flight
[1:40:51] the pastor was oh no now brotherline is
[1:40:53] gonna be in the church
[1:40:56] but for the people they wanted so i went
[1:40:59] to his church i'm by the grace of god
[1:41:02] so i'm look on the side and i see the
[1:41:05] pastor struggling
[1:41:07] uh uh
[1:41:08] having like a mind battle and i said
[1:41:11] lord help your servant
[1:41:13] i know you love him and he probably
[1:41:15] going through a
[1:41:18] mind battle
[1:41:19] the reason he heard some rumors
[1:41:22] and he believed the rumors
[1:41:24] that's why he didn't want me to come
[1:41:27] but
[1:41:29] as the minister the holy spirit pulled
[1:41:32] out oh how i love him
[1:41:35] the people run to the altar
[1:41:37] crying
[1:41:39] crying so when i saw that i left the
[1:41:42] pulpit and i went to pray for the people
[1:41:45] when the partner saw that he came to the
[1:41:48] pulpit
[1:41:50] and when he saw his own people
[1:41:52] receiving the holy ghost
[1:41:54] and then delivered
[1:41:56] with tear in his side
[1:41:58] in front of the congregation he said
[1:42:01] brotherly no
[1:42:02] and i look i want you to forgive me
[1:42:06] i spoke bad about you
[1:42:09] i said something wrong about you please
[1:42:11] but you forgive me i said brother it is
[1:42:14] under the blood
[1:42:15] that brother was so honest he didn't
[1:42:17] want a blessing for his people
[1:42:20] but god knows his sheep
[1:42:22] oh the lord is so wonderful
[1:42:25] praise god i want to share one more
[1:42:28] thing
[1:42:29] and uh uh
[1:42:32] it was in mexico
[1:42:34] in one of those churches way on top of
[1:42:37] the mountain
[1:42:38] as i'm doing a gut work
[1:42:42] there is a sister on that church
[1:42:45] that is a believer
[1:42:47] and uh
[1:42:50] and her husband
[1:42:52] told don't go to church
[1:42:54] but she can't come coming because god
[1:42:57] changed her life
[1:42:59] now
[1:43:00] she come coming she can't comment but
[1:43:03] the husband said i don't want you to go
[1:43:05] to the church
[1:43:06] she totally changes i want you the way
[1:43:08] you want with your pants with your
[1:43:11] makeup
[1:43:12] i said but i'm a daughter of god now and
[1:43:14] the husband beat her up
[1:43:17] that she called the pastor's pastor i
[1:43:19] cannot come to church because my husband
[1:43:22] beat me up or say okay my sister will be
[1:43:26] praying for you
[1:43:27] so what has happened
[1:43:29] her husband is a taxi driver
[1:43:32] so while he was doing his job he got
[1:43:35] hold up by robbers
[1:43:37] so he tried to defend himself
[1:43:39] and the robber beat him up
[1:43:42] beat him up so bad that he lost one eye
[1:43:46] so while he's in the hospital hallelujah
[1:43:49] the wife visited him and very softly i
[1:43:53] said honey you know
[1:43:56] i think this happened
[1:43:58] because of what you did to me
[1:44:01] so the husband kept quiet
[1:44:03] and the only thing he said
[1:44:05] tell your pastor that i want to see him
[1:44:08] so when he left the hospital came back
[1:44:10] to the home
[1:44:11] every time the pastor came he run away
[1:44:14] three times he run away but this time
[1:44:17] when i was there helping the believer
[1:44:20] doing missionary work
[1:44:22] the pastor said brother you know let us
[1:44:25] visit this family
[1:44:27] so
[1:44:28] when we went to visit the family he know
[1:44:31] we was coming and
[1:44:33] he left the place
[1:44:34] and he didn't came back into almost 12
[1:44:37] o'clock
[1:44:38] but oh while i was in the house
[1:44:41] i began to feel something strange
[1:44:45] i said something is not right so i began
[1:44:48] to look around and when i looked to my
[1:44:50] right i saw
[1:44:53] a a a place
[1:44:55] so many
[1:44:56] same
[1:44:57] or so many like a a a
[1:45:00] word like how can i say idolatry
[1:45:03] all kind of saint of virginia peace and
[1:45:06] that in one little corner and i said no
[1:45:09] one though
[1:45:10] that's where those demons are coming
[1:45:12] from
[1:45:13] and then i said within myself i wish the
[1:45:15] pastor
[1:45:16] will have a word of prayer before we
[1:45:18] leave
[1:45:19] so the time came the husband didn't come
[1:45:23] so when we were getting ready to leave
[1:45:26] the pastor said well the husband is not
[1:45:28] here let us go
[1:45:30] and i said oh i wish the pastor will say
[1:45:33] let's have a word of prayer
[1:45:35] but when we was leaving there's a little
[1:45:37] lady
[1:45:38] that's crippled in a wheelchair she came
[1:45:41] running
[1:45:42] and she said please before you go would
[1:45:45] you say a word of prayer and i say oh
[1:45:48] lord you are in business
[1:45:53] and uh
[1:45:54] and then the pastor said brother would
[1:45:58] you do a world of prayer i say oh father
[1:46:02] may you be glorified
[1:46:05] so you must know
[1:46:06] what you're doing
[1:46:08] and you got to know what you say so
[1:46:13] when i when i
[1:46:14] become to pray i say lord jesus
[1:46:18] i want you to go holy ghost go to the
[1:46:21] room
[1:46:22] and we
[1:46:23] process that room for the glory of god
[1:46:26] when the united states invade another
[1:46:29] country
[1:46:30] they put a banner
[1:46:32] and i said this is
[1:46:35] did we claim this land
[1:46:38] so the same way father i got to the room
[1:46:41] and i claimed that bedford for the glory
[1:46:43] of god father i got to the kitchen and i
[1:46:46] claimed the kitchen for the glory of god
[1:46:49] holy ghost may you go up to that corner
[1:46:52] and we crave this entire house for the
[1:46:54] glory of god may every soul be saved for
[1:46:59] the glory of god and satan i bind you
[1:47:03] and as soon as i say that
[1:47:06] all those things began to to push me
[1:47:09] down
[1:47:10] and as they pushed me back i said no sir
[1:47:14] and they pushed me i said no sir i'm
[1:47:16] going to finish my prayer
[1:47:19] as i was praying those demons were
[1:47:22] pushing me down i said not sir i'm gonna

[1:47:28] prayer boom everything left
[1:47:31] that was a saturday so on a sunday the

[1:47:39] ah
[1:47:40] the pastor come running i said
[1:47:43] i said yes my brother

[1:49:10] people and i remember
[1:49:12] brother bryan said that in every local
[1:49:15] church
[1:49:16] there is to be a fight for minister
[1:49:20] so with that in my i said brother look

[1:49:38] another one
[1:49:39] about seven of them
[1:49:41] so when sunday came that though
[1:49:44] i was playing
[1:49:46] but when the time came the brother would
[1:49:48] you come
[1:49:49] and then gave the favorite scripture and
[1:49:52] they said why
[1:49:54] then i told him all right

[1:50:39] take one step and god will come right
[1:50:42] behind and take the other step
[1:50:44] hallelujah
[1:50:45] now in that little church glory to god
[1:50:49] uh to put the young people in action we
[1:50:52] develop what we call
[1:50:54] a prayer warrior prayer warrior
[1:50:58] so we have a time when we pray
[1:51:02] all of us together
[1:51:04] and we
[1:51:06] try to teach all of them
[1:51:09] everything our prayer
[1:51:12] prayer for intersection prayer with
[1:51:15] fasting prayer breaking the joke
[1:51:19] a prayer in the morning prayer in the
[1:51:21] evening in prayer at night i mean they
[1:51:24] will cover with everything about prayer
[1:51:28] and we got all of the beautiful quote
[1:51:31] from brother brown what he say about
[1:51:34] prayer
[1:51:35] we don't have time we shall have time to
[1:51:37] share but anyway so we developed that
[1:51:40] group
[1:51:41] one time i said okay now we want to have
[1:51:45] a church deliver
[1:51:47] unclean and free from spirit so today
[1:51:52] but next weekend we are going to fast
[1:51:55] friday saturday and then sunday we will
[1:51:59] return the fast
[1:52:00] and we did it and we had a revival
[1:52:04] hallelujah
[1:52:05] we had a revival that all the gifts
[1:52:11] came alive
[1:52:13] even the gift of a young prophet he
[1:52:16] shook me
[1:52:17] even the gift or healing
[1:52:20] there was a young brother that
[1:52:24] a car killed a dog
[1:52:26] and he was so inspired that he went
[1:52:30] pray for the dog and they look in my
[1:52:32] life
[1:52:34] and we have a young man that is he
[1:52:37] called the path to pastor
[1:52:39] the spirit of the lord now that's the
[1:52:42] sound of a prophet the spirit of the
[1:52:44] lord lifted me up
[1:52:46] and drove me through the city
[1:52:50] and i saw what everybody was doing
[1:52:54] and then i looked at the church
[1:52:56] and i saw what the church was doing i'm
[1:52:59] pastor
[1:53:00] i saw when something happened
[1:53:03] something happened in this room
[1:53:05] then the door was closed
[1:53:08] and nobody couldn't get in
[1:53:11] and i don't know what that means so he
[1:53:13] shared with the pastor
[1:53:15] that sunday
[1:53:16] after the service the holy ghost pulled
[1:53:20] out in the kitchen
[1:53:22] so you see everybody being packed out
[1:53:26] and the door closed
[1:53:28] and nobody could go where the holy grail
[1:53:31] just so perfectly like the young men saw
[1:53:35] it
[1:53:35] all those young people were so excited
[1:53:38] hallelujah so we had a prayer warrior
[1:53:41] group
[1:53:43] now as i was traveling oh i hope i'm not
[1:53:45] getting close to myself as i was
[1:53:47] traveling and go to another country so
[1:53:50] when i go to that other country and i'm
[1:53:54] having a dinner in this house now in
[1:53:56] this house
[1:53:58] the owner of the house they have their
[1:54:00] own business in the house
[1:54:02] so when we were having dinner somebody
[1:54:05] knocked on the door
[1:54:10] so the host came and said excuse me i
[1:54:13] just need to take care of these people
[1:54:15] but just keep eating
[1:54:17] while i finish and deal with them
[1:54:20] but what was happening it was a couple
[1:54:23] that were doing business
[1:54:24] but they were going through a trial
[1:54:27] that they couldn't keep it to themselves
[1:54:30] and then share with that lady
[1:54:33] so when they share with that lady
[1:54:36] the lady came to us and they said
[1:54:39] no the lady told them look i have
[1:54:42] missionary here with us
[1:54:44] tonight
[1:54:46] for you one thing would you share this
[1:54:48] with them so they call me so when i go
[1:54:51] and i heard something that all just
[1:54:54] broke my heart
[1:54:56] and when i heard the story and this is
[1:54:58] the story they have two young men
[1:55:01] and they are they are black it's a black
[1:55:03] family they are the smartest of children
[1:55:06] i think they think they're young all the
[1:55:09] way to college they were the brightest
[1:55:12] and the smartest they get the highest
[1:55:15] grade in school so because of that they
[1:55:18] qualify to go to uh one of the special
[1:55:22] school
[1:55:23] but what has happened in that school
[1:55:26] uh they were maybe three or four of the
[1:55:29] same color now they gave a hard test
[1:55:34] and they pass it
[1:55:36] with a 95
[1:55:38] and they were joking with it oh daddy i
[1:55:41] couldn't get a hundred
[1:55:43] but when they went to celebrate all the
[1:55:46] school
[1:55:47] they had a uh what they call a party or
[1:55:49] a feast
[1:55:51] something happened to those two young
[1:55:53] men
[1:55:54] when they left that
[1:55:56] party they lost their mind
[1:56:00] and the parents do not know what
[1:56:02] happened
[1:56:04] for three and a half years
[1:56:06] these two young men
[1:56:08] they spend the rest of their life in the
[1:56:11] basement
[1:56:13] the parent
[1:56:15] came and opened up the burden to this
[1:56:17] family i said i don't know what to do
[1:56:20] i took him to every hospital and they
[1:56:23] said there's nothing wrong with him i
[1:56:25] took him to a specialist and they say
[1:56:28] and the last they told me is
[1:56:30] you have to go and see an exorcist
[1:56:34] because there's nothing wrong with them
[1:56:36] but they are crazy they lost their mind
[1:56:40] so when they told me that and they
[1:56:43] shared that with me
[1:56:44] i said sir
[1:56:46] do you mind if i go and see
[1:56:49] them
[1:56:51] the the father cry
[1:56:53] i said you
[1:56:54] you are the first one that ever told me
[1:56:58] that
[1:56:58] that ever wanted to see my children
[1:57:02] please come so i go with the deacon to
[1:57:04] the house
[1:57:05] and brother when i saw these two young
[1:57:07] men
[1:57:08] they are sitting in front of a tv
[1:57:12] and the tv has no image it's just going
[1:57:14] around around and around and they're
[1:57:17] just watching with mount open and the
[1:57:20] eye wide open like that
[1:57:23] i said this is my children
[1:57:26] three and a half years
[1:57:28] for the last three months they don't
[1:57:30] come up and support with us
[1:57:33] i say
[1:57:35] with god all things are possible
[1:57:39] so when we came up
[1:57:40] we began to sing only belief
[1:57:44] as soon as we began to sing only believe
[1:57:47] those young men slammed the doorbell
[1:57:51] and the father scream don't close the
[1:57:53] door keep it open i said brother don't
[1:57:56] worry
[1:57:57] god does not need an open door he knows
[1:58:00] how to get them

[2:02:41] oh hallelujah and the people worship and
[2:02:45] another mom passed by then another

[2:02:58] lady
[2:02:59] for uh they called a sexual slave
[2:03:03] so the family called i said paulino

[2:03:17] they released the lady untouched for the
[2:03:21] glory of god amen oh lord our god is an
[2:03:26] awesome guy i'll finish with this
[2:03:27] brother brother theo and there's so much
[2:03:30] more to share hallelujah
[2:03:32] in that same church
[2:03:34] when the pandemic came glory to god
[2:03:37] the pandemic got the pastor the wife the
[2:03:41] children and almost half of the church
[2:03:44] hallelujah
[2:03:46] and
[2:03:47] the pastor
[2:03:49] got the one that was hit the most
[2:03:54] so when he went to a doctor
[2:03:57] the doctor had five patients
[2:04:00] and he was the worst of all of the five
[2:04:03] patients
[2:04:04] but when the brother called me
[2:04:07] hallelujah
[2:04:08] not thinking that he was going to make
[2:04:10] it but for the glory of god hallelujah
[2:04:14] i share
[2:04:16] a scripture with a brother i said little
[2:04:19] brother
[2:04:20] teach you people to receive the holy
[2:04:23] ghost
[2:04:26] receive the holy ghost
[2:04:28] make emphasis in the experience of the
[2:04:31] holy ghost
[2:04:33] so anatomy look
[2:04:35] god
[2:04:36] one time was going to kill moses
[2:04:41] because moses didn't want to circumcise
[2:04:44] his son
[2:04:46] and the circumcision was a type of the
[2:04:48] holy ghost so when the brother heard
[2:04:50] that something happened to him he
[2:04:53] screamed out and i believe he had an
[2:04:56] experience of the holy ghost
[2:04:59] and he was healed and delivered on the
[2:05:03] pandemic
[2:05:04] so when he went to the doctor the doctor
[2:05:07] said you are a miracle
[2:05:10] because you were the worst one of all of
[2:05:13] them for the glory of god
[2:05:17] and so much more to say i share this
[2:05:19] with you
[2:05:21] right here in this community
[2:05:23] uh i heard something so beautiful
[2:05:26] of a husband
[2:05:28] wishes for his wife
[2:05:30] that he wanted to buy her this
[2:05:32] he wanted to do this for her
[2:05:34] [Laughter]
[2:05:37] and do this for her
[2:05:39] and when i heard that
[2:05:41] that that that just as the father that
[2:05:44] is so beautiful to hear
[2:05:46] from the husband to his wife
[2:05:49] and i kept it with him
[2:05:50] but two or three weeks later i heard
[2:05:53] he was struck with the pandemic
[2:05:57] he had coveted
[2:05:59] i said well we'll pray for him we trust
[2:06:01] that he will
[2:06:02] be uh free
[2:06:04] but a week later they say they've got to
[2:06:07] say
[2:06:08] that they give him up there's nothing
[2:06:11] they can do
[2:06:13] when i heard that i said oh no no father
[2:06:17] so i made arrangement to go and see him
[2:06:20] and visited him
[2:06:22] it was hard
[2:06:23] because they would not let no one come
[2:06:25] in
[2:06:26] but they summoned with the bible
[2:06:29] and they said oh are you a chaplain he
[2:06:31] said yes i'm a missionary just give me
[2:06:33] five minutes i leave right away
[2:06:37] um it was horrible by the grace of god
[2:06:39] they led me in
[2:06:41] now when i came in the north was taking
[2:06:45] care of him
[2:06:47] and uh
[2:06:49] uh she prepared me to go inside
[2:06:52] now
[2:06:53] as soon as i walked in
[2:06:56] all the all the machines
[2:06:58] began to to fall
[2:07:01] from from from from from green to yellow
[2:07:04] to red and all the machine began to
[2:07:06] sound
[2:07:08] the man was leaving
[2:07:10] he was going he was dying so the nurse
[2:07:14] ran for help
[2:07:16] and she began to call the other doctor
[2:07:18] as she left
[2:07:20] i then came in and i lay hands on my
[2:07:23] brother i said oh father
[2:07:25] may you give my brother one more chance
[2:07:29] that when he leave this place he might
[2:07:31] be able to tell someone what you have
[2:07:33] done
[2:07:34] father if it is your will
[2:07:36] for this man to live i rebuked the
[2:07:40] spirit of death on this man for the
[2:07:43] glory of god and i cursed that pandemic
[2:07:46] in his life
[2:07:48] in jesus name
[2:07:50] amen and as soon as i took my hand from
[2:07:54] all the lights begin to come back on
[2:07:57] and all the doctor was standing there
[2:08:00] and
[2:08:01] as i was standing there i left right
[2:08:03] away but then i heard that he was taken
[2:08:06] out as he's been taking care of and he's
[2:08:10] still
[2:08:11] living for the glory of god
[2:08:13] oh by the tia which i have more time
[2:08:15] thank you thank you so much for the lino
[2:08:17] actually
[2:08:18] since that was the testimony that
[2:08:20] stirred me this last test of money here
[2:08:22] and it's amazing that berlin started and
[2:08:25] talked about his life and with his dad
[2:08:28] and he kind of hate for how did i
[2:08:31] treated him and to see the love that he
[2:08:33] could tell his dad i love you and the
[2:08:35] whole line
[2:08:36] is such a blessing and such a powerful
[2:08:38] testimony i'm coming right back to that
[2:08:41] key testimony of this guy who better you
[2:08:44] know shared with me he wanted to do so
[2:08:46] much for his wife and
