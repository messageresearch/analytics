[38:33] afterward he appeared unto the eleven as
[38:36] they sat at meat and abraded them with
[38:38] the unbelief
[38:40] and hardness of heart
[38:41] because they believed not them which had
[38:44] seen him after he was risen
[38:46] and he said unto them go into all the
[38:48] world
[38:49] and preach a gospel to every creature
[38:52] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[38:53] be saved
[38:55] he that believeth not shall be damned
[38:57] and these signs shall follow them that
[38:59] believe in my name they shall castle
[39:01] devils they shall speak with new tongues
[39:04] they shall take up serpents and if they
[39:06] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[39:08] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[39:10] and they shall recover and from first
[39:12] corinthians chapter two
[39:15] one read from verse one
[39:28] and thy brethren when i came to you came
[39:30] not with excellency of speech
[39:33] or of wisdom
[39:34] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[39:37] for i determine not to know anything
[39:39] among you save jesus christ and him
[39:41] crucified and i was with you in weakness
[39:44] and in fear and in much trembling and my
[39:47] speech and my preaching was not with
[39:49] enticing words of man's wisdom
[39:51] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[39:54] of power that your faith should not
[39:57] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[39:59] power of god
[40:01] blessed by our hearts as we pray father
[40:03] we thank you for this resurrection
[40:05] morning
[40:06] where you prove
[40:08] that not only the word is mechanics but
[40:10] it's also dynamics
[40:12] father me you're saying the dynamic
[40:13] power inside of here
[40:15] lord i may have filled the people with
[40:17] the holy ghost
[40:18] may wave after a wave of your glory
[40:20] sweep over the souls and lines of your
[40:22] people all in the campgrounds all when
[40:24] they're eating lord oh man they go back
[40:26] to their rooms may your presence speak
[40:27] with them in a mighty way but you send a
[40:30] blast of the holy ghost inside of here
[40:32] in jesus name i ask it amen and amen you
[40:34] may be seated
[40:40] with a title this morning
[40:42] the gospel
[40:44] not in word
[40:45] but in
[40:49] [Music]
[40:50] power and
[40:52] from our message things wasn't so from
[40:54] the beginning
[40:56] he said jesus when he came he said moses
[40:59] because of the hardness of your heart
[41:00] suffered your divorce from your wife but
[41:02] it wasn't so from the beginning now we
[41:04] find out they took the commandments of
[41:06] god and made them of non-effect
[41:09] when jesus came he found people looking
[41:12] to the church for salvation
[41:17] that's what jesus came and meant
[41:20] and that's the same thing to try to set
[41:22] up now
[41:23] [Applause]
[41:24] some people leave the churches like they
[41:25] lost the salvation
[41:27] see
[41:28] what did they get creeds
[41:30] each denomination make up their own
[41:32] creed and then that's what he found the
[41:34] people depending on the church for
[41:35] salvation and from man-made creeds
[41:38] and if he come today in person and talk
[41:40] to us he'll find the same thing man
[41:43] making the word of god fit their
[41:46] denomination giving them creeds
[41:48] and there's no salvation in the creed if
[41:50] it's not the bible
[41:52] it's got to be the bible because it is
[41:55] his word all we have need of is his word
[41:58] and his word when it when the word of
[42:00] god is god in the beginning was the word
[42:02] the word was with god and the word was
[42:04] god and the word is still god
[42:08] now the people look to the church
[42:11] instead of looking to god's word and it
[42:14] wasn't so from the beginning
[42:16] now they have left god when they left
[42:19] his word
[42:20] that's the reason we have things the way
[42:22] we do today is because people left the
[42:23] word
[42:24] now if a doctor wrote a formula a
[42:26] prescription and you add something to it
[42:29] or take something away from it you'll
[42:30] kill the patient
[42:32] you have got enough uh have enough
[42:34] antidote to upset the poison enough
[42:36] poison to kill the germs too much poison
[42:39] without the antidote will kill the
[42:40] patient too much antidote without the
[42:43] poison it will do no good
[42:45] that's the way with god's word
[42:47] it is god's prescription
[42:49] it is god's prescription to his people
[42:52] to cure every sickness
[42:54] every disease
[42:56] sin and physical whatever it may be it's
[42:59] all met in god's word
[43:01] it is god's word you cannot deviate from
[43:04] the word
[43:06] isn't that right
[43:08] so he said no the people today no wonder
[43:10] this crowd there's a miracle is passed
[43:12] there's no such thing as divine healing
[43:14] why do they do it because they've got
[43:15] god's word
[43:16] wrapped are they creed wrapped up in it
[43:19] and it makes the thing wrong it hasn't
[43:21] got no power in there and if an angel a
[43:24] bishop arch bishop whatever it might be
[43:26] come and change one word it will change
[43:29] the whole prescription
[43:31] [Applause]
[43:34] [Music]
[43:37] archbishop big man small man
[43:40] elder man dick man
[43:43] one word
[43:45] change the prescription
[43:47] hallelujah
[43:49] but we don't want the prescription
[43:51] change
[43:52] hallelujah
[43:54] hallelujah
[43:56] glory to god
[43:58] my hallelujah because jesus had all
[44:00] power in heaven earth has given unto me
[44:03] he didn't say some power he said all
[44:05] power
[44:08] hallelujah
[44:10] i wonder where that power is this
[44:11] morning
[44:13] [Applause]
[44:15] hallelujah
[44:17] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[44:20] so he said no okay
[44:22] some second coming phoenix 1955 he said
[44:25] i believe that we're living in one of
[44:26] the most marvelous days that we ever
[44:28] lived the most greatest time that any
[44:30] person that ever lived on the earth yeah
[44:33] he said what about the time when jesus
[44:34] was here
[44:35] when he was coming then at the scene now
[44:38] that was just in the middle of the
[44:39] earthly pilgrimage here
[44:42] that human being has
[44:44] and this time it ends up all life of
[44:46] mortality
[44:48] going into immortality now
[44:50] and all the sin of all ages is settling
[44:53] down onto this generation
[44:57] you hear that
[44:59] all the sin of all your age is settling
[45:01] down in this generation
[45:03] all the weaknesses from our fathers
[45:06] of inbred traditions this sicknesses and
[45:09] disease is breaking out like you have
[45:11] never known before in the world
[45:14] [Applause]
[45:19] that's why there's so much sicknesses
[45:20] now
[45:21] that's why there's so much disease now
[45:24] there's so much
[45:25] disease
[45:26] [Applause]
[45:32] hallelujah
[45:34] churches suffer from spiritual aids
[45:37] they can't resist the enemy
[45:40] they can't resist the coldness and the
[45:41] death
[45:43] hallelujah
[45:44] praise god hell have enlarged its mouth
[45:48] you may be seated on streams of demon
[45:50] powers coming upon the face of the earth
[45:53] so to combat that quarter to send seven
[45:55] angels
[45:56] from eternity
[45:58] to bring heaven down
[46:04] maya you may be seated and heaven
[46:06] consists of the
[46:08] [Applause]
[46:12] word so the rays are standing against
[46:15] the enemy quarter to send seven angels
[46:18] from eternity
[46:20] to bring heaven down
[46:22] to battle on the earth
[46:25] but we are going to win
[46:27] we heard about that last night
[46:29] and jesus this morning proved
[46:32] that we are going to be his victory
[46:35] [Applause]
[46:38] oh
[46:39] are you with me
[46:40] glory to god
[46:42] satan was former champion
[46:45] but he is not champion this morning
[46:48] jesus is the heavyweight champion
[46:51] because he rose from the dead
[46:53] hallelujah
[46:55] i said the devil is a plus
[46:57] he is walking in championship clothes
[47:00] but he is defeated
[47:02] easter proved that
[47:05] oh hallelujah
[47:07] [Applause]
[47:10] oh
[47:11] blessed be the name of the lord
[47:13] you may be seeking
[47:16] oh my
[47:18] eternity never begins never ends
[47:21] never had a beginning never has an
[47:22] ending you can't explain it but anything
[47:26] that had a beginning has to end
[47:28] so you say what about us brother branham
[47:30] well as long as you're a natural human
[47:32] on the earth here you had a beginning
[47:35] but if you are born of heaven
[47:37] you're part of god
[47:39] then that spirit never had a beginning
[47:42] [Applause]
[47:46] hallelujah
[47:47] you cannot die no more than quote
[47:51] [Applause]
[47:53] because you never had a beginner
[47:56] and if you've never had a beginning you
[47:58] could never have an ending
[48:00] that's what i say is victory
[48:03] hallelujah
[48:04] [Applause]
[48:12] spirit never had a beginning
[48:14] because it's part of god is eternal
[48:17] that's the only way you can ever live
[48:18] forever is that eternal life
[48:20] an eternal life but anything that has
[48:22] begins has an end
[48:24] so if you had no beginning watch and
[48:26] jesus said except a man be born again of
[48:28] the spirit he cannot enter into the
[48:30] kingdom no eyes enter because you have
[48:33] got to have eternal life
[48:35] so when god spoke and made man
[48:38] and man's souls was soul was lost
[48:42] anything outside of of of that joining
[48:45] church and anything is high breeding
[48:49] so when man's soul was lost
[48:52] church couldn't redeem man
[48:54] by church join them
[48:58] [Applause]
[49:02] listen to this
[49:04] you have got to come back god
[49:08] has got to speak the word back again
[49:11] that makes it life eternal
[49:14] when god speaks life into you
[49:18] then that's eternal again
[49:20] [Applause]
[49:28] so the devil mingled mix it up try to
[49:31] mix faith with something unbelief
[49:33] together so it makes a hybrid or when
[49:36] god speaks and places the holy spirit in
[49:38] there and seals it it's eternal so when
[49:41] man fell man could not receive life by
[49:44] group joining for manner to receive life
[49:46] god had to bring the word
[49:49] to his people
[49:50] so that they can receive eternal life so
[49:53] you must receive the word so that you
[49:55] could have eternal life
[49:59] [Music]
[50:01] so the devil's job was to set up church
[50:03] to bring creed
[50:06] and god's job was to bring the word
[50:09] and the word comes to our prophet
[50:13] [Applause]
[50:16] hallelujah
[50:18] are you with me
[50:19] and how can you hear without the
[50:21] preacher
[50:22] [Applause]
[50:24] and how can he preach except he be sin
[50:28] [Music]
[50:28] [Applause]
[50:30] hallelujah
[50:32] hallelujah
[50:34] and if he is to preach he must preach
[50:36] what is already in the word
[50:39] [Applause]
[50:42] he cannot preach his own interpretation
[50:46] he kind of preached word only
[50:48] [Applause]
[50:50] because the cosplay is nothing but
[50:52] only but in the power
[50:55] and demonstration of the spirit
[50:57] that your fear
[50:59] that you fear
[51:01] that your fear
[51:03] might not rest in the wisdom of man
[51:05] but in the power of god
[51:22] oh hallelujah
[51:24] glory to god
[51:27] hallelujah
[51:29] so you wouldn't be walking around going
[51:31] and saying that's my pastor going there
[51:33] that's my part that's my man over there
[51:35] that's my bishop going there no no no no
[51:37] no you would not be saying that you

[51:46] me free last night he steal me he
[51:49] refilled me he delivered me
[51:53] [Applause]
[52:08] who are we anyhow

[52:14] to be among you shouting and praising
[52:16] the but god called me for a job and god
[52:20] called you for a job and i want to

[53:32] [Music]
[53:36] [Applause]
[53:41] ephesians 4 he says grieve not the holy
[53:43] spirit of god
[53:45] not the holy church of god
[53:49] i'm reading
[53:50] the holy spirit
[53:52] wherever you are sealed
[53:54] until the day of your redemption
[53:57] and the seal represents the finished
[53:58] work
[53:59] nothing is sealed like you load a box
[54:01] car you saddle in a box car i used to
[54:03] work on a railroad and we would load a
[54:05] boxcar different things but the
[54:07] inspector comes around first it's got to
[54:10] go to a lot of rough roads
[54:12] if there's anything loose he will not
[54:13] seal it
[54:16] until the car is loaded
[54:18] and compact
[54:19] let me ask a question who's the
[54:20] inspector the pastor
[54:26] [Applause]
[54:37] you may be seated
[54:39] she's downloading the box car i would
[54:41] load but the inspector comes around it's
[54:43] got to go through a lot of rough roads
[54:45] if there's anything loose he will not
[54:47] seal it until that car is so loaded and
[54:49] compact till nothing can shake it then
[54:52] he closes the door and seals it and it
[54:55] cannot be broken until it's destination
[54:58] god comes along and finds a lot of
[55:00] foolishness in us he just don't steal it
[55:03] yet
[55:04] he sees a lot of unbelief he just don't
[55:06] see that yet
[55:07] but when it's all packed up with the
[55:09] full gospel
[55:11] then he seals it
[55:12] till it's destination
[55:18] oh
[55:18] man so you got to be packed up
[55:22] with the gospel
[55:24] put it upon word
[55:25] line up online
[55:27] yeah little deal
[55:29] oh hallelujah promise after promise
[55:30] after promise
[55:34] this is a message of promises isn't that
[55:36] right
[55:37] amen you may be seated
[55:39] look at abraham
[55:41] god give him a promise that he have a
[55:42] son
[55:43] he's an old man
[55:45] and he's walking around god changed his
[55:46] name from abraham to abraham
[55:49] meaning father of nations and he has no
[55:51] evidence of being a father
[55:53] and yet he have to walk around with his
[55:54] promise
[55:55] he can't show anybody yet he cannot
[55:57] display it but he believed it
[55:59] no he was he was going along with
[56:02] seemingly the word the word the word the
[56:04] word
[56:04] but it was a word of promise
[56:09] it wasn't just word word would work
[56:11] it was word of promise
[56:14] it wasn't an explanation wrote or a
[56:16] reference text
[56:17] it was put a promise
[56:19] god promised me
[56:21] a son
[56:23] god said so
[56:25] hallelujah
[56:27] he had a personal revelation from god he
[56:30] may be seated
[56:31] so therefore he was acting on the word
[56:33] he was making preparation because he had
[56:35] revelation
[56:36] which brought expectation
[56:38] so whenever god gives you revelation
[56:41] you'll find yourself making preparation
[56:42] because revelation brings expectation
[56:45] it's revealed to you
[56:47] so seven thunders gives fate
[56:50] which is revelation
[56:52] that gives us all these years
[56:53] expectation
[56:55] for its real dynamic pride revival so
[56:58] year in year out
[57:00] convention and convention out we were
[57:02] preaching with revelation
[57:05] with expectation
[57:06] for a dynamic manifestation
[57:09] preachers come preachers go
[57:11] people come people go but we are
[57:14] steadfast
[57:16] it
[57:16] will rain

[57:25] my god you maybe see that
[57:28] some left some thought they had it
[57:29] already but they got it again
[57:31] praise god i think they got it already
[57:32] but they got it again some try to do
[57:34] their own thing but they still have to
[57:35] come back in line with the word i
[57:36] promise
[57:38] because dynamics is promised
[57:41] [Applause]
[57:43] amen amen do you believe that
[57:45] [Applause]
[57:47] so you may be seated
[57:49] so go to libram that his wife to his
[57:52] wife's son now abram did not believe
[57:55] sarah's body
[57:58] [Music]
[57:59] because if you keep looking at sarah's
[58:00] body he will get he wouldn't believe
[58:03] [Music]
[58:06] so he stopped looking at sarah's body
[58:08] and look at the promise
[58:09] [Applause]
[58:15] so stop looking at you
[58:19] stop looking at yourself and look at the
[58:22] promise of god
[58:24] [Applause]
[58:31] hallelujah
[58:34] you may be seated
[58:36] abraham knew that syrah don't have the
[58:38] power
[58:40] syria is all
[58:41] but you know god has the power
[58:44] now if he could get the word to sarah
[58:46] sarah could change
[58:48] if he could get the power to save us all
[58:50] will change
[58:51] so he stopped watching syria and he's
[58:53] watching the power
[58:55] [Applause]
[58:58] hallelujah
[59:00] glory to god
[59:02] so stop watching a wrinkle of life of
[59:04] unbelief
[59:08] and watch the promise this morning
[59:11] because he who made the promise
[59:14] is able to keep the promise because he
[59:16] proved oh glory to god
[59:26] oh hallelujah
[59:28] you may be seated
[59:31] remember the word is what brings the
[59:33] miracle
[59:36] [Music]
[59:38] there's a word of healing
[59:40] there's a word of deliverance
[59:43] isn't that right
[59:44] you have to take the word first and then
[59:46] it produces a miracle
[59:47] [Applause]
[59:48] abraham took the word first
[59:52] and sarah got a miracle
[59:56] [Applause]
[1:00:00] mary took the word first be it done unto
[1:00:02] me according to thy word
[1:00:04] [Applause]
[1:00:08] and if you want that miracle of
[1:00:10] transformation you have got to take the
[1:00:12] word first
[1:00:24] now remember
[1:00:25] the word was lost through the ages
[1:00:31] it is out of peace
[1:00:34] so god had to gather the scattered word
[1:00:37] and tied mark in the word
[1:00:39] to bring down the holy ghost
[1:00:41] [Music]
[1:00:43] so the very person of god was scattered
[1:00:45] through all the edges
[1:00:47] so forgot to restore his person back in
[1:00:49] the church
[1:00:52] he had to send the angels
[1:00:54] to pick up what luther left off
[1:00:56] to pick up what wesley left
[1:00:58] to pick up what the penny costa left off
[1:01:01] got it all together
[1:01:06] you may be seated

[1:15:45] the pharisees
[1:15:47] the sad you see

[1:16:51] a reference
[1:16:54] the thought was just another quote
[1:16:56] but he said today

[1:17:47] and david he was bringing it alive
[1:17:51] what is the kingdom
[1:17:54] the kingdom is the word
[1:17:56] made spirit

[1:18:10] churches when john the baptist came he
[1:18:13] came different

[1:18:17] church
[1:18:18] he went in the wilderness
[1:18:21] [Applause]
[1:18:24] because he had a different message from
[1:18:26] his father
[1:18:30] he had to announce the coming of messiah
[1:18:33] and that kind of different
[1:18:35] is different from traditions
[1:18:42] [Applause]
[1:18:45] a rocket man named john
[1:18:47] no smooth words
[1:18:50] he was a rough man
[1:18:57] eating wine lucas and honey
[1:19:00] brother he was something else
[1:19:02] but he said messiah is coming
[1:19:09] somebody said john but you're something
[1:19:10] else he said me no you think i'm
[1:19:12] something else where'd the dynamics come
[1:19:15] wait till messiah come
[1:19:17] we're till charity the bright absolute
[1:19:19] strikes
[1:19:21] [Applause]
[1:19:23] i'm only announcing he's coming
[1:19:28] you may be seated
[1:19:31] or you could even go way beyond that
[1:19:32] before that
[1:19:33] and the messiah was two years old
[1:19:36] crashing into jerusalem with two wise
[1:19:38] men
[1:19:42] crashing in jerusalem
[1:19:43] crashing into jerusalem
[1:19:45] was three wise men they traveling two
[1:19:47] years
[1:19:52] and when they hit the city
[1:19:55] they wasn't saying um uh could you give
[1:19:57] me the address of um
[1:20:00] wait waiting jesus is born
[1:20:03] no when they hit the city where is he

[1:20:28] because they thought everybody knew
[1:20:29] messiah was on earth
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:33] you may be seated
[1:20:39] only to find out they didn't even know
[1:20:43] sahara said what court is that again
[1:20:45] what what um messiah what what book what
[1:20:47] what
[1:20:48] where is the rising of the sun equipment
[1:20:52] where finding that one
[1:20:57] [Applause]
[1:21:00] you may be seen there
[1:21:02] they see these wise men with light led
[1:21:03] by a star or when they hit among the
[1:21:06] so-called caretakers and builders and
[1:21:08] protectors of the message the star left
[1:21:10] them
[1:21:11] and as soon as they get from among that
[1:21:12] crowd is that came back
[1:21:14] and then they rejoice with great joy
[1:21:17] my god hallelujah brother when you get
[1:21:20] among a bunch of unbelief you lose the
[1:21:22] star
[1:21:23] mind but when they get away from
[1:21:24] unbelief you'll see that star
[1:21:34] these wise men didn't travel for two
[1:21:36] years for nothing
[1:21:40] they didn't travel all those mines for
[1:21:42] nothing
[1:21:43] they came for something
[1:21:49] no they were wise men
[1:21:52] each had their personal revelation
[1:21:56] of messiah
[1:21:57] [Applause]
[1:21:59] they didn't form a municipal association
[1:22:00] and said let's discuss um how we should
[1:22:03] approach jerusalem
[1:22:04] let us put up together my one gift
[1:22:07] [Music]
[1:22:08] [Applause]
[1:22:21] to contribute to the unfolding mystery
[1:22:25] of identifying messiah
[1:22:29] [Applause]
[1:22:34] you may be seated
[1:22:38] so when they call to the
[1:22:40] the child jesus
[1:22:43] time to unveil the gifts everything had
[1:22:44] was a mystery behind it because they
[1:22:46] didn't discuss it upon another
[1:22:48] actually i read somewhere where they
[1:22:49] didn't even leave together they met
[1:22:51] along the way
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:22:58] so then one brought gold
[1:23:03] to identify that as god
[1:23:07] this is god here
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:12] another one brought frankincense
[1:23:15] this is service here this is called
[1:23:16] service
[1:23:18] so it's been revealed now
[1:23:20] another one brought more
[1:23:22] it means that this is caught in service
[1:23:23] today
[1:23:26] the purpose is identified
[1:23:28] [Applause]
[1:23:37] [Applause]
[1:23:41] [Music]
[1:23:46] now the bride must get a sense of
[1:23:49] mission oriented
[1:23:52] the pride must get a sense of purpose
[1:23:57] what are we to become
[1:24:06] [Applause]
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:14] before the rapture
[1:24:16] [Applause]
[1:24:19] are we to become a super race
[1:24:21] a super church
[1:24:23] as we near the headstone
[1:24:26] as the plagues keep coming coming coming
[1:24:29] it's power supposed to come power power
[1:24:30] power
[1:24:32] because one little player is going to
[1:24:33] meet the power
[1:24:35] and sons of god gonna push back the
[1:24:37] plagues
[1:24:39] they're gonna stop sicknesses they're
[1:24:41] gonna stop diseases
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:47] you may be seated what is our purpose
[1:24:51] or are we going to hope the pastor bring
[1:24:52] a good message
[1:24:59] [Music]
[1:25:07] and see if what we've seen is in the
[1:25:09] world
[1:25:10] [Applause]
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:22] god
[1:25:23] is still god
[1:25:30] and in order to be god he must remain
[1:25:32] god
[1:25:34] and i say this morning he's still
[1:25:36] almighty
[1:25:38] [Applause]
[1:25:45] not some mighty
[1:25:48] almighty
[1:25:51] does that mean he could do anything
[1:25:54] do you believe that
[1:25:56] oh man
[1:25:58] you may be seated praise god
[1:26:01] hallelujah
[1:26:02] [Applause]
[1:26:08] he was promising sunday gideon was
[1:26:10] stressing wheat
[1:26:12] and god came down and said i'm the god
[1:26:14] of abraham isaac jacob i'm the one that
[1:26:16] brought you out of egypt
[1:26:17] i'm the one that gives you what you have
[1:26:18] got turned to me
[1:26:20] there he and his father came out
[1:26:22] christian as wheat and angel came to him
[1:26:24] and he thought it was an angel it
[1:26:25] happened to him turn out it wasn't an
[1:26:27] angel it was god himself
[1:26:30] it was capital lord
[1:26:32] the lord
[1:26:33] [Applause]
[1:26:34] and when he spoke to gideon gideon was a
[1:26:36] little surprised
[1:26:39] because god's a gideon
[1:26:42] the mighty man of valor
[1:26:47] [Applause]
[1:26:55] [Applause]
[1:27:01] no that was good thoughts about gideon
[1:27:03] but that wasn't gideon thoughts about
[1:27:05] himself
[1:27:11] [Applause]
[1:27:16] he may be seated
[1:27:19] so many times i think we retain the
[1:27:21] things we believe about ourselves is how
[1:27:23] we live
[1:27:24] how we act
[1:27:26] bible said as a man thinking in his
[1:27:27] heart so is he
[1:27:29] so if you think you're defeated you are
[1:27:31] yeah
[1:27:33] yeah i am right
[1:27:34] if you believe you are going to break
[1:27:35] through you will get a breakthrough
[1:27:37] just what you think in your heart
[1:27:39] [Applause]
[1:27:43] amen
[1:27:44] so sometimes a lot of times the kind of
[1:27:46] thoughts we harbour
[1:27:47] and encourage if you think negative to
[1:27:50] what you'll be a negative person
[1:27:52] so what you have to do is to begin to
[1:27:54] think positive
[1:27:56] about the promises of god to you
[1:27:59] pray about it
[1:28:00] think about it
[1:28:02] act on it
[1:28:04] because god is not operating on the
[1:28:07] level of your emotions
[1:28:09] that you're not feeling that you're
[1:28:10] gonna make it he's not operating on that
[1:28:12] level
[1:28:19] amen you may be seated
[1:28:21] see so god wants to bring his word to
[1:28:23] you
[1:28:24] so you could be feeling sick here this
[1:28:25] morning but god is not operating based
[1:28:27] upon you are sick he wants to bring his
[1:28:29] word of healing to you
[1:28:31] you could be born this morning but god's
[1:28:33] not operating on that level of how you
[1:28:34] feel and i'm feeling that i couldn't get
[1:28:36] a breakthrough that's your feeling
[1:28:37] but how does god feel about you
[1:28:41] [Applause]
[1:28:43] so you may be feeling however you're
[1:28:44] feeling but god feeling positive towards
[1:28:47] you
[1:28:48] you might be feeling bonked but he want
[1:28:49] to tell you you will be delivered
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:28:56] you may be feeling sick but you're going
[1:28:57] to be healed
[1:29:00] you'll be hungry for the holy ghost you
[1:29:02] shall be filled
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:09] so gideon
[1:29:11] didn't know
[1:29:12] he was a mighty man of allah
[1:29:16] he thought he was just an ordinary man
[1:29:23] he thought he had to take all the
[1:29:24] pressures that medianite was giving him
[1:29:28] he thought he had to continue taking the
[1:29:31] pressure from the enemy
[1:29:33] that's what he was thinking all the time
[1:29:35] this is my lord you know many christians
[1:29:37] you know this is my portion
[1:29:44] [Music]
[1:29:45] [Applause]
[1:29:47] what are gonna do
[1:29:48] tell me what you're gonna do you're
[1:29:49] gonna find out what you're supposed to
[1:29:50] do you're not supposed to take that
[1:29:54] who say you supposed to take that from
[1:29:55] the anime
[1:29:59] watch
[1:30:00] but he was a mighty man of valor
[1:30:02] [Applause]
[1:30:04] yet that understanding wasn't unlocked
[1:30:09] that understanding wasn't unfolded
[1:30:11] that understanding wasn't revealed or
[1:30:13] made known now as long as he doesn't
[1:30:16] know that he will continue to live as he
[1:30:18] lived
[1:30:22] hallelujah and act as he act
[1:30:26] oh my
[1:30:28] praise be to jesus
[1:30:31] [Applause]
[1:30:39] look at moses
[1:30:41] moses
[1:30:42] in exodus street of the firemen just
[1:30:44] want to just go through it quickly
[1:30:46] moses saw the burning bush and you get
[1:30:48] up there and the holy god spoke to moses
[1:30:51] they put off thy shoes off thy feet for
[1:30:53] the police well though stan is holy
[1:30:54] ground
[1:30:55] then he identify himself again i'm the
[1:30:57] god of abraham
[1:30:58] isaac and jacob
[1:31:00] and the lord said i have surely seen the
[1:31:02] affliction of my people which are in
[1:31:03] egypt and i've heard their cry by reason
[1:31:05] of their task masters for i know their
[1:31:07] sorrows and i'm come down to deliver
[1:31:09] them out of the hand of the egyptians
[1:31:11] and to bring them out this is god
[1:31:12] telling moses now i come down to deliver
[1:31:15] them and bring them out and so forth
[1:31:16] until land flowing milk and honey and so
[1:31:18] forth now therefore behold the crowd the
[1:31:20] chair of israel has come to me i've also
[1:31:22] seen the oppression where the egyptians
[1:31:24] oppress them come now therefore and i
[1:31:26] will send the interfero that all means
[1:31:28] bring forth my people
[1:31:30] the chair of israel out of egypt
[1:31:33] now when god was talking about he come
[1:31:34] down that was fine for moses when god
[1:31:36] was talking about he's going to deliver
[1:31:38] them and give him a good land that was
[1:31:39] fine but when god says
[1:31:41] come now therefore and i will send thee
[1:31:44] that was a problem
[1:31:49] because moses said
[1:31:51] unto god who am i
[1:31:53] that i should go unto pharaoh
[1:32:06] so then
[1:32:07] god says certainly i will be with thee
[1:32:09] and so forth amuden said no if i go on
[1:32:12] they don't want to hear me know what
[1:32:14] i'll tell them
[1:32:15] so you're still trying to dodge a little
[1:32:16] bit
[1:32:18] so i'll say he said i am that i am and
[1:32:20] thus shall you know and so forth and
[1:32:22] different things like that
[1:32:23] praise be to jesus
[1:32:26] isn't that right
[1:32:28] amen
[1:32:29] and moses answered and said but behold
[1:32:32] they will not believe
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:36] someone is still trying to dodge as much
[1:32:39] as he could the lord said what is in thy
[1:32:41] hand
[1:32:42] god's going to demonstrate supernatural
[1:32:43] now
[1:32:44] said i read he said cast it down
[1:32:46] turn into a snake
[1:32:47] let him put his hand let us put it back
[1:32:49] his heel
[1:32:50] now with all of that and god spoke to
[1:32:53] moses
[1:32:54] and moses come again and shall come to
[1:32:56] pass if they will not believe that okay
[1:32:58] then after god do all of that moses said
[1:33:00] no moses said the lord lord i am
[1:33:02] eloquent
[1:33:05] i'm not eloquent either i could neither
[1:33:08] here to a since that was spoken that i
[1:33:09] served i am sort of speech a slow tongue

[1:41:29] at the end of acting upon the word
[1:41:31] there's a miracle for you
[1:41:34] at the end of it

[1:41:38] now listen to this
[1:41:39] moses going on his road to egypt with a
[1:41:42] stick in his hand a one-man invasion
[1:41:45] i know
[1:41:46] he said no he's going to take over with
[1:41:48] a dry stick in his hand see he'd done it
[1:41:50] too sure he did why he was acting how do
[1:41:52] you know well when you get down there
[1:41:54] listen to the voices speaking
[1:41:57] listen to the thoughts that is coming to
[1:41:59] moses man
[1:42:00] when you get down there pharaoh will
[1:42:02] hang you
[1:42:03] he's been looking for you for 40 years
[1:42:05] and whenever he finds you
[1:42:06] you'll certainly go on
[1:42:08] you have killer egyptian you know what
[1:42:10] it is even smite and egyptian is dead
[1:42:12] and here you don't kill one and hit him
[1:42:14] and run away when you get back there
[1:42:16] it's dead
[1:42:19] [Music]
[1:42:26] now just think about the kind of nine
[1:42:27] battles moses had to go through
[1:42:30] he took our mind back
[1:42:32] who want to go back egypt
[1:42:36] certainly not moses
[1:42:37] but he was acting
[1:42:40] upon what god told him
[1:42:42] [Applause]
[1:42:47] now if he was to study from a natural
[1:42:49] standpoint he would study but what a
[1:42:50] good thing but i can't go back dinner
[1:42:52] because i don't kill a man already and
[1:42:54] push up on my mind he might lock him up
[1:42:55] you know
[1:42:58] but moses went past all of that
[1:43:02] you may be seated
[1:43:06] he went past his failures
[1:43:08] he short comments
[1:43:10] moses had all of that to contend with
[1:43:13] yet he was acting upon what god promised
[1:43:16] he said you go and i'm going to deliver
[1:43:18] my people
[1:43:19] you go and let pharaoh know let my
[1:43:21] people go
[1:43:22] here was a weak man
[1:43:24] here was a runaway
[1:43:27] here was
[1:43:29] the sea man not the different moses
[1:43:35] he was the same man
[1:43:38] weak man
[1:43:40] the same man
[1:43:42] sailing man
[1:43:44] that same man was now an anointed
[1:43:46] commissioned man
