[50:07] are coming god bless you welcome one and
[50:10] all we so glad to be in the house of God
[50:12] this morning we want to go straight to
[50:14] the word if I have your Bibles I like a
[50:16] return to Luke chapter 17 we want to
[50:19] read verse twenty to thirty we want to
[50:22] turn after the first Corinthians chapter
[50:23] four 1 verse death was twenty and we
[50:28] want to read mark 16 it was 15 to 20 so
[50:33] Luke chapter 17 reading from verse 20
[50:37] and when he was demanded of the
[50:41] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[50:45] come he answered them and said the
[50:48] kingdom of God
[50:49] commit not with observation neither
[50:52] shall they say lo here or lo dear for
[50:55] behold the kingdom of God is within you
[50:59] and he said to his disciples the days
[51:03] will come when you shall desire to see
[51:07] one of the days of the Son of Man and
[51:09] shall not see it and they shall say to
[51:12] you see here see there go not after them
[51:15] nor follow them for as the lightning
[51:17] that lightened out of one part on the
[51:19] heaven shun it unto the other part on
[51:21] the heaven so shall also the Son of Man
[51:23] be in his day but first must he suffer
[51:27] many things and be rejected of this
[51:29] generation and as it was in the days of
[51:32] Noah so shall have also been the days of
[51:34] the Son of Man they did eat they drank
[51:37] they married wives they were given in
[51:39] marriage until the day that noe entered
[51:41] into the ark and the flood came and
[51:43] destroyed them all likewise also as it
[51:47] was on these of lot they did eat they
[51:49] drank they bought they sold they planted
[51:51] they builded but the same day that lot
[51:55] went out of Sodom it rained fire and
[51:57] brimstone from hell
[51:59] and destroy them all even thus shall it
[52:02] be in the day when the Son of Man is
[52:06] revealed and first Corinthians chapter 4
[52:11] verse 24 the kingdom of God is not in
[52:17] word but in power murder again for the
[52:21] kingdom of God is not in word but in
[52:25] power our last scripture from mark 16
[52:28] verse 15 and he said unto them go into
[52:30] all the world and preach the gospel to
[52:32] every creature he that believed in his
[52:34] baptized shall be saved he that
[52:36] believeth not shall be damned these
[52:38] signs shall follow them that believe in
[52:40] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[52:42] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[52:44] take up serpents and if they drink any
[52:45] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[52:47] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[52:49] shall recover and so then after the Lord
[52:52] had spoken unto them he was received up
[52:54] into heaven and southern on the right
[52:56] hand of God and they went forth and
[52:57] preached everywhere the Lord working
[52:59] with them and confirming the word with
[53:04] signs following
[53:06] may God blesses wood let's pray one more
[53:07] time father we have read your word and
[53:09] any man can read scriptures Lord but I
[53:11] take the Holy Spirit to come and breathe
[53:12] life into it Lord we pray the breath of
[53:15] God would breathe life into your people
[53:17] Lord that is son like a mighty much an
[53:19] army granted Lord in Jesus and my Oscar
[53:22] amen you may be seated and I just said
[53:24] don't give God some praise
[53:33] welcome again is good to be in a house
[53:36] of God always good to be in God's house
[53:40] this more important than your job whom
[53:44] family this is where you get divine
[53:46] instructions this is where you come
[53:48] under covenant this is where you get the
[53:50] connection with the supernatural but the
[53:52] protection with a word with a direct the
[53:55] seer the Lord into your life or glory to
[53:58] God not everybody's ordained to speak
[54:00] into your life but God have ministry to
[54:03] speak into your life by the Word of God
[54:05] the right things that you must hear
[54:07] coming into your life we believe that
[54:09] whatever title this morning call back to
[54:12] the original faith the bride that's a
[54:15] title called back to the original faith
[54:17] the bride and I've an inspiration faith
[54:20] is the key that lock unlocks every
[54:23] treasure in the kingdom of God faith is
[54:27] the key that unlocks every treasure in
[54:29] the kingdom of God hallelujah now the
[54:32] script we read first Corinthians chapter
[54:34] 4 verse 20 and the amplified every
[54:37] script we read for the kingdom is not in
[54:40] word but in power but in the amplified
[54:42] is written for the kingdom of God
[54:44] consists of and is based not on talk but
[54:49] on power moral power and excellence of
[54:53] soul Alleluia that's when we talk about
[54:56] the kingdom of God John was preaching
[54:58] the kingdom of God is at hand Jesus was
[55:01] preaching the kingdom of God my kingdom
[55:04] is not of this world so he was
[55:06] presenting people another Kingdom that
[55:08] they never saw they never heard about
[55:11] they never experienced and he was about
[55:14] to introduce the name this thing called
[55:16] the kingdom of God because they were
[55:19] living in the kingdom of this world but
[55:21] he was talking about a higher level a
[55:23] higher order a higher world called the
[55:25] kingdom of God amen
[55:28] no mystery back
[55:38] so describing Pharisees they demanded of
[55:42] him when the kingdom should come this
[55:44] came when it should come and Jesus said
[55:46] the kingdom come it not with observation
[55:49] so what you're looking for you're
[55:51] looking for clothes you're looking for
[55:53] they look at what what are you looking
[55:55] for looking for this he looking for that
[55:57] but what are you looking for you see he
[56:00] said behold the kingdom is within you
[56:03] oh my hallelujah so he was dismissing
[56:06] all the physical and notable things to
[56:09] precede the kingdom of God come in and
[56:12] he said this kingdom had to be within
[56:13] you but that itself is a revelation how
[56:16] does the kingdom come into someone
[56:17] because God's object is to get the
[56:20] kingdom within you and we find out what
[56:22] was above us pillar fire Moses time God
[56:25] with us and Jesus Christ and then the
[56:27] Holy Ghost come into you and Jesus told
[56:30] them I if I don't go the comforter will
[56:32] not come and I am the comforter which is
[56:34] the power which is the dynamics is not
[56:35] with you but it shall be in you so I
[56:38] have to get some way to reconnect you to
[56:40] the power that's supposed to come within
[56:42] you you don't have it no but you have
[56:44] there to get you don't have it no but
[56:47] you have a promise of it you don't have
[56:49] it yet but you're gonna get it because
[56:51] it was something in you to receive it
[56:53] you can't get it if there's nothing on
[56:55] you to receive it you have to have the
[56:57] ability to receive so God put the
[56:59] receiver inside you first and cover that
[57:02] receive I'm a dirty with mud with filled
[57:05] with unbelief with all kind of things
[57:07] around that but it's still inside of you
[57:09] you went to hell you went to trials went
[57:12] to tribulations but it's still there
[57:14] you fall sick but it's still there
[57:16] somebody can go crazy but it's still
[57:18] there
[57:18] nothing can change that because that God
[57:21] put that seed in your soul and the devil
[57:24] don't have the authority to go inside
[57:26] your soul he can mess with your mind he
[57:29] can mess with your body but he can't
[57:31] mess with your soul that she has
[57:34] predestinated that she is elected
[57:37] [Applause]
[57:42] let me say it again
[57:44] he could fool with your body he could
[57:48] fool with your spirit but he cannot fool
[57:50] with those soul because only the word is
[57:54] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[57:56] of the heart
[57:58] the devil is not the word he cannot go
[58:00] inside of your heart and mess up inside
[58:03] our dear God but that German Saturday
[58:05] that's why he told her who you are
[58:07] he didn't know who Jesus was he keeps
[58:10] saying Toby and Toby if they'll be he
[58:13] watching your stinking flesh and
[58:15] misinterprets and who you are because of
[58:17] what you was because what you're doing
[58:19] right now but he's not seeing what you
[58:21] had to become look at the Lord a shout
[58:25] hallelujah he's trying to nail you by
[58:28] your failures he's trying to nail you by
[58:31] your sins he's trying to nail you by
[58:33] your past but God already consider your
[58:37] future already done so he told you
[58:40] before the foundation of the world and
[58:43] he's not gonna lose you he's not Pointer
[58:46] hallelujah
[58:53] maybe season he's not going to undo his
[58:57] choice before I was even born he said
[58:59] Jacob I love he so I hate Oh glory to
[59:03] God because he knew what they will do
[59:04] and God knew what you're gonna do
[59:07] glory to God you know you will repent
[59:08] yes yes yes you know you're gonna make
[59:11] things right
[59:11] he's not gonna say I am sorry forgive me
[59:14] he know all of that before you even
[59:15] lorina God hallelujah oh boy we love God
[59:23] hallelujah glory to God hallelujah

[59:47] up they'd ever want to finish you a long
[59:48] time do they will always try to cut off
[59:51] potential because once I get into
[59:54] maturity he is finished or glory to God
[59:57] that's why I kill all them babies - yes
[59:59] and under kill what is the potential but
[1:00:02] once you come into maturity is finished
[1:00:04] because he had a prophecy handle over

[1:12:39] consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost
[1:12:42] was upon him and it was revealed unto
[1:12:47] him by the Holy Ghost that he will not
[1:12:50] see that until the Lord see the Lord
[1:12:53] scrap this revelation brought feet which
[1:12:58] brought an expectation for manifestation
[1:13:01] so faith is the talk have faith what are
[1:13:04] supposed to do a revelation brings
[1:13:07] expectation for something faith is the
[1:13:11] key to get you to where you're going
[1:13:14] the Bible says faith is the substance of
[1:13:16] what you're hoping for so a lot of
[1:13:19] things people think they have they
[1:13:21] really don't have because they make you
[1:13:23] act different talk different live
[1:13:25] different see different
[1:13:27] [Applause]
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:44] there must be feet to accompany
[1:13:48] expectation and there are only two
[1:13:52] elements in the world that controls the
[1:13:55] wood tonight
[1:13:57] fear and feet Russia is trying to get
[1:14:03] everybody to fear them and we are trying
[1:14:05] to get everybody to have faith in God
[1:14:07] that's the difference that is the two
[1:14:10] element control nations control all
[1:14:13] people control all churches control
[1:14:18] individual it is fear or faith I wanted
[1:14:26] to do it today but it was just I just
[1:14:27] simply do it
[1:14:29] what a glass here for you and put it
[1:14:31] halfway with water in it and ask you
[1:14:34] what you see
[1:14:36] so could imagine a glass here and it's
[1:14:38] halfway and I asked what do you see and
[1:14:42] some will say I'll see a glass half full
[1:14:45] and somebody's will see I see a glass
[1:14:49] half empty psychologists will say the
[1:14:54] person will say half empty is negative
[1:14:56] base the person will see how full is
[1:15:01] positive base but both of what the scene
[1:15:04] is right the half empty person seen as
[1:15:08] halfway down to finish the half full
[1:15:11] person seen is halfway down the fault to
[1:15:13] get it up what do you see
[1:15:16] it comes a question of perspective so if
[1:15:21] your perspective in life is negative its
[1:15:24] affects your marriage its effect how you
[1:15:27] view the world it affects how you see
[1:15:29] others because your base is negative
[1:15:33] Jesus taught us to get these guys under
[1:15:35] one base which is under the promise of
[1:15:38] God
[1:15:40] which is always positive I will not
[1:15:44] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[1:15:47] a little while the world's yet me no
[1:15:50] more but you shall see me and because I
[1:15:52] live shakily also all this promises is
[1:15:56] positive all this promise is true you
[1:16:00] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[1:16:04] is come upon you Oh glory to God
[1:16:06] hallelujah all this promises it's true
[1:16:09] you shall be delivered you shall be free
[1:16:13] you shall be delivered
[1:16:15] Oh glory the courser and God bring
[1:16:18] promises is real it is true it is tyreq
[1:16:22] to you or glory to God so God is trying
[1:16:26] to change your mind if we can get you to
[1:16:29] change your mind your entire life
[1:16:31] changes your entire world changes your
[1:16:34] perspective changes oh you see brethren

[1:47:57] Jacob tricking everybody mother-in-law
[1:48:00] fight a lot you name it Iike trick
[1:48:01] because this is neat yeah he's a real
[1:48:05] rapport factious but he's a son it has
[1:48:08] some ripple artists were sons now if you
[1:48:11] watch the artistry and it watch the
[1:48:14] behavior you will close it I doesn't
[1:48:15] know but Gordo see us man see so that's
[1:48:20] why when you have strange eyes you don't
[1:48:22] like this one your blood catalyst one
[1:48:24] you need help
[1:48:25] you need to deliverance you need that
[1:48:28] not like a demon to be cast out because
[1:48:30] Gordon loved you as you are but he's not
[1:48:34] really let me remain as you are he is
[1:48:37] changing you for what you are to what
[1:48:38] you had to become or glory to God and
[1:48:42] this purpose and desire is that you be
[1:48:44] conformed to the image of his son
[1:48:46] you have your nature and he of his
[1:48:48] nature you might be a man like Peter was
[1:48:50] an aggressive man a bold man learning
[1:48:53] that you will be to come there are
[1:48:54] people who are aggressive the sick
[1:48:55] people acquire there's a bit of a shine
[1:48:57] that's your nature but he have his
[1:49:00] nature and all of us have to be
[1:49:02] partakers of his divine nature so his
[1:49:05] nature has to come into you and that
[1:49:07] will take out your shyness that will
[1:49:08] take all this but will take out your
[1:49:10] anger and temper because you are
[1:49:11] surrendering his nature and his nature
[1:49:17] is a nature of power man was destined to
[1:49:20] have power man is supposed to be in
[1:49:23] power or grow in that polo and another
[1:49:25] but power very creeping things over
[1:49:27] sickness over devils over diseases man
[1:49:30] one Power Man or glory decorum before
[1:49:34] God give power you have to show power
[1:49:36] over you come on say Amen somebody you
[1:49:40] have to have power over you
[1:49:42] [Applause]
[1:49:46] and the first stage of getting power
[1:49:51] over you is when you could own your
[1:49:53] behavior i'ma say it again when you
[1:50:02] could own up to your behavior because
[1:50:07] decisions produces actions and actions
[1:50:09] of consequences and when you reap the
[1:50:13] fruit of your consequences being based
[1:50:15] upon your actions then you have a
[1:50:17] decision whether to make excuses or own
[1:50:19] up the prodigal son was not wrong and
[1:50:23] asking his father for money that was his
[1:50:27] right he was a son he had access to the
[1:50:31] father
[1:50:32] and what was his own he's taking my
[1:50:33] portion now I don't want to wait till
[1:50:35] they're dead just do me know
[1:50:36] I feel I could be responsible for what
[1:50:40] you give me he was not ready he was not
[1:50:44] mature he went a far country
[1:50:46] deliberately so nobody can monitor or
[1:50:49] give account in his behavior actions he
[1:50:52] spend his money wisely and then he find
[1:50:54] himself in the pic then call he can pay
[1:50:58] no more rent
[1:51:00] he broke he tell people now where he is
[1:51:05] living they seen the big mansion they
[1:51:07] are seeing the hot there Cindy found
[1:51:11] behind the homes so as far as he friends
[1:51:16] concerned he live in a bigger house he
[1:51:17] just said come on up and spending these
[1:51:18] days that time money is done money is
[1:51:23] finished no more pizza no more KFC no
[1:51:28] more outside diamond they just not seen
[1:51:30] him he say he taken a sabbatical he
[1:51:34] taken a rest that time is there none
[1:51:36] lajjun any pigsty eating pig slop and he
[1:51:42] was so proud
[1:51:43] that's the father's killer he pray he
[1:51:47] was so proud he didn't pick food for a
[1:51:49] while but style maybe blisters and put
[1:51:52] some ketchup on it but eaten pigs
[1:51:54] until he came to himself until he came
[1:51:59] to himself and began to accept
[1:52:02] responsibility for the fruit and
[1:52:05] consequences of an accent is that I will
[1:52:08] arise I will say unto my father I have
[1:52:11] sinned
[1:52:14] anima or give the Lord a show this is
[1:52:28] the problem here I know personally many
[1:52:31] people don't accept the behavior no
[1:52:37] acceptance say you are responsible no
[1:52:40] not me I'm not take enough of that
[1:52:41] and I said I take enough have you first
[1:52:44] response I remember talking of a New
[1:52:54] York about the time and I open my
[1:52:55] radiator and blow up and I get boom
[1:53:00] still have things from it and I was
[1:53:02] saying I was responsible for that I'm
[1:53:05] not a child
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:08] you definitely hold my hand and said I
[1:53:12] didn't want to but the devil hold my
[1:53:14] hair no no no devil in that that is me
[1:53:18] and folly and I get boon for my fault
[1:53:23] you I know better than that
[1:53:25] before you touch that pour water on it
[1:53:27] before you touch that had a cloth to
[1:53:29] open that that was foolishness and I was
[1:53:33] responsible and pay for that they become
[1:53:37] as I see it right in turn Lucifer don't
[1:53:49] know I came from
[1:53:50] I got burned painfully and Lucifer sin I
[1:53:55] was not there I did not touch him I did
[1:53:59] not tell him to do that he did that on
[1:54:01] his own even see it an ordinary night
[1:54:04] and this is the first time me telling
[1:54:07] the truth to begin with because because
[1:54:14] I am lying if I say that I know better
[1:54:17] than that
[1:54:17] and you know better than that to stop
[1:54:20] lying be honest with yourself accept
[1:54:25] responsibility for your behavior tell
[1:54:27] the Lord a show and whenever you begin
[1:54:39] to accept responsibility behavior that
[1:54:42] is the first step for you to be changed
[1:54:46] that's how you're going to be changed
[1:54:49] you cannot change at all if you're not
[1:54:53] prepared to accept you may feel as a
[1:54:55] wife it's not really a failure
[1:54:57] you do what you know you may feel as a
[1:55:01] husband it's not ready a failure or a
[1:55:03] father or mother maintain they try the
[1:55:08] best
[1:55:08] there's no school of motherhood there's
[1:55:10] no school of fatherhood
[1:55:11] there's no school of husband and wife
[1:55:13] there's none you do your best you say
[1:55:16] away as I say and you didn't see it
[1:55:17] right and whatnot but if you get the
[1:55:19] tools you would have done better and you
[1:55:23] have to forgive yourself there's another
[1:55:25] problem we people have people turn
[1:55:27] forgive their own self you have to come
[1:55:30] to a spot where you could forgive you
[1:55:33] because if you can't forgive you the
[1:55:36] devil will wipe you out because you will
[1:55:40] always walk under a condemnation but
[1:55:43] there are no condemnation to them who
[1:55:45] are in Christ Jesus who walk not after
[1:55:47] the flesh but after the spirit
[1:55:51] somebody get them free insider this
[1:55:53] morning somebody going free insider this
[1:55:56] morning be honest with your actions when
[1:56:10] you start to accept responsibility then
[1:56:12] you could say Lord change me why do I
[1:56:14] say that Jacob his nature was a ripoff
[1:56:17] thing he's tricking everybody and
[1:56:20] treated until he came to the endgame
[1:56:21] because all these have an EM you know
[1:56:24] people don't understand that so now when
[1:56:27] I was creeping Street I'll tell I'm used
[1:56:28] to look at that young people they don't
[1:56:30] know next 40 years of know that tall
[1:56:33] spiky shoes that they were in and I
[1:56:35] figured I had the balance and played
[1:56:37] gymnastics with us they went flats next
[1:56:40] 40 years
[1:56:41] perfect flats if they don't weigh them
[1:56:44] flats they will fall when they fall they
[1:56:47] win Hospital and at that age a bones to
[1:56:50] meander normal so right now dance Tillis
[1:56:55] and because they have uten the bones
[1:56:58] they could balance and them stilts that
[1:57:00] the walking on but all that comes to an
[1:57:02] end 40 50 years from them did not seem
[1:57:05] that so Jacob when he met the angel
[1:57:08] because afterwards he recognized his
[1:57:10] fear ezel all this money all this
[1:57:15] wealthy have all the land and house and
[1:57:17] everything he conquer and he filled me
[1:57:19] powerfully family so cord already naked
[1:57:21] boy you could admire he know you report
[1:57:25] from money that he Republic all family
[1:57:29] he know he not right
[1:57:32] and the other face is so any frightening
[1:57:34] fear grip room insanity what said we
[1:57:39] send babies and then God catch him alone
[1:57:42] for the first time most cellphone he

[2:04:50] believer I'll be with you even in you to
[2:04:52] the end of the world no that was the
[2:04:53] Apostles believed they believed that he
[2:04:56] was in the flesh he was also more in the
[2:04:58] spirit that is what they taught that is
[2:05:01] what they believed that is what they
[2:05:03] practiced that is what God confirmed he
[2:05:06] was in the fresh no he's more in the
[2:05:08] spirit that's what they believe
[2:05:10] now when your family walk inside of here
[2:05:12] the very full service dog is out of here
[2:05:14] there are 19 the presence of power but
[2:05:16] do something for them that they will
[2:05:18] know God is dealing with your hearts you
[2:05:20] don't have to tell a word the spirit
[2:05:23] speaking to them directly give the Lord
[2:05:25] a shout

[2:05:40] God and your faithfulness and your faith
[2:05:43] and blood is not in vain you have to
[2:05:47] believe the same what about him he said
[2:05:54] you know I like this that says what they
[2:05:56] believed that is what they practiced
[2:05:58] that is what God confirmed but during
[2:06:01] this time this 33 years of laughs they
[2:06:04] became many false brethren not few many
[2:06:08] false brethren who raised up and brought
[2:06:11] in heresies and brought people off the
[2:06:14] theology and different things like that
[2:06:16] and all had a private revelation because
[2:06:19] they want to get big up they want to get
[2:06:20] high up the one people see them a
[2:06:22] certain way so therefore the exercise of
[2:06:24] their knowledge people

[2:06:26] so never cease console but did he
[2:06:29] supposed it's the Lord was working with

[2:11:42] that was once delivered to the Saints
[2:11:43] the Saints believes in the dead burial
[2:11:46] and resurrection they believe in the
[2:11:49] baptism of the Holy Spirit let me pause
[2:11:51] here a minute the Prophet said you can
[2:11:53] have the bat-signal goes 24 hours every
[2:11:55] day and still be lost
[2:12:00] what is he talking about
[2:12:03] you could be baptized on your spirit
[2:12:05] you could be baptized in your flesh or
[2:12:08] you can be baptized in your soul so that
[2:12:10] 24 hours being lost is not for the Soul
[2:12:17] so teachings are going on the ceiling
[2:12:20] you're sure you don't need a baptismal
[2:12:21] holy ghost because it Baptist was not
[2:12:23] the real thing he says because you are
[2:12:25] son
[2:12:26] you were to receive the spirit the
[2:12:28] spirit that making you my son this
[2:12:30] spirit is empowering you as a son but
[2:12:33] Peter didn't bypass the upper room and
[2:12:35] say have a seat on his soul at only the
[2:12:37] upper room he needed the upper room he
[2:12:39] needed the power house he needs to be
[2:12:41] activated in the anointing you need this
[2:12:45] power let me say it again you need it

[2:13:00] holy life power to overcome power to
[2:13:03] forgive power to make things right or
[2:13:06] for evil God power to live power to add
[2:13:09] the list of the life let me check my
[2:13:16] descriptions upon scriptures as many
[2:13:18] receive him to them gave he power not
[2:13:23] more laptop power the kingdom is nothing
[2:13:26] letter power well glory to God the
[2:13:28] kingdom is preached is a kingdom of
[2:13:30] power or glory to God God's kingdom is a
[2:13:33] kingdom of power and before you to be
[2:13:36] subject to the king you have to come
[2:13:37] into the kingdom because the king is
[2:13:40] responsible for everybody in the kingdom
[2:13:41] or come and preach back to me somebody
[2:13:44] Oh hallelujah hallelujah

[2:15:58] this fit that is the key to lock this
[2:16:02] door this feat is based on forgiveness
[2:16:04] and Jesus said when you stand praying

[2:16:17] somebody do you something and sometimes
[2:16:20] nobody are doing at you know you do your

[2:17:36] rejection so I'm gonna give somebody
[2:17:38] advice and I turn it down and then I

[2:19:31] some of you need to forgive yourself let

[2:19:48] Jesus himself said behold I stand at

[2:19:58] inside he's not going to break down your
[2:20:01] door you are going to choose to love you
[2:20:06] are going to choose to forgive it's a
[2:20:07] choice I have in my heart to share
[2:20:12] something with you I didn't plan do it
[2:20:14] today about certain principles and what
[2:20:16] has kept me over the years and to share
[2:20:18] some tips if I could call it or whatever
[2:20:20] it is
[2:20:21] Oh what has he me over the years
[2:20:24] I like the power of choice I like the
[2:20:27] power of decision I'll see the fruit of
[2:20:30] decision with actions and the
[2:20:31] consequences of that when you choose to
[2:20:34] love and choose to forgive it changes
[2:20:37] everything
[2:20:37] you're not looking for reward I
[2:20:39] scratched my back I scratch your back
[2:20:41] because I will you scratch mine no no
[2:20:43] we're not talking about the ice crush my
[2:20:44] your back because your back needs to be
[2:20:46] scratched I help you because I want to
[2:20:48] help you I choose to help you so there
[2:20:50] is no reproach Oh God let's help him I
[2:20:52] have her I look what she's doing no no
[2:20:54] you have none of that you do it because
[2:20:57] they want to you do it because they
[2:20:59] choose to because when God was helping
[2:21:00] you he did it because he wanted to he
[2:21:03] wish you this song that said when you
[2:21:06] reach down his hand for me I was lost
[2:21:08] and undone without God or his son when
[2:21:10] he reached on his hand for me or glory
[2:21:13] to God hallelujah how could you forget
[2:21:16] that how could you forget where God
[2:21:19] brought you from hallelujah don't you
[2:21:22] ever forget that
[2:21:27] and usually when people get blessed to
[2:21:30] forget God because alimony get ammo
[2:21:32] Hoffa SMO higher order and more disarm
[2:21:34] or that and they forget God but God want
[2:21:37] to reach you so but but Ivan said his
[2:21:39] faith God want somebody the more he get
[2:21:42] blessed is the more humble he becomes
[2:21:44] it's a tough combination because
[2:21:46] normally when we get blessed to get
[2:21:48] puffed up you get oversized they don't
[2:21:51] care no more when God when there was in
[2:21:53] tears when if they forget when when when
[2:21:55] when the others was driving them to
[2:21:57] service when they get the kadek they do
[2:21:58] want to pick up somebody to bring them
[2:22:00] to church but if I get when other people
[2:22:02] was given another hiker service but when
[2:22:04] they get a car to have the news up in
[2:22:05] the air and the making style I am either
[2:22:08] knock anybody or me to say it I had sure
[2:22:11] in worse for me to say it you have to
[2:22:13] remember where you come from or glory to
[2:22:16] God he brought me off the merry clear he
[2:22:18] set my feet upon a rock Christine he put
[2:22:20] a shock in my soul today Oh glory to God
[2:22:27] hallelujah
[2:22:29] I remember look what a gorge right here
[2:22:31] he will never forget that I was in
[2:22:34] Belmont she was in KY well at a pump
[2:22:37] pump pump gas lamp in those days go to
[2:22:40] the well and get water and and before we
[2:22:44] even build this smaller wooden church
[2:22:45] was up in a house pumping gas lamp and
[2:22:47] praying
[2:22:48] it's right up this way so my first
[2:22:49] vision I heard a travel walk into KY
[2:22:52] well I'll have about three people in
[2:22:55] service and brother George tell me you
[2:22:57] say why why didn't still you will leave
[2:23:00] quite from bellman p2g people told him I
[2:23:03] say when you repent go go forgive you
[2:23:06] and he repented next day because I
[2:23:10] didn't come to keep you people
[2:23:11] I came to preach the word
[2:23:14] it didn't matter it were three people
[2:23:15] well from them three people we have a
[2:23:18] group here now a church here now
[2:23:21] you see we don't know why God will take
[2:23:23] us when we broke into brotherly kindness
[2:23:27] 1981 it was a vision was a premium and I
[2:23:30] showed this vision and I saw a sheet
[2:23:32] drop down and even words the second
[2:23:34] commercial awareness and I went to find
[2:23:37] that message to find out if that was a
[2:23:39] message preached by brother Branham and
[2:23:40] was and then that message you see when
[2:23:42] the church finds its brother love when
[2:23:43] it's chill Phi holds and I said church
[2:23:45] this have to be revealed and God broke
[2:23:47] the revelation and then pour it on top
[2:23:49] of it listen carefully God brought the
[2:23:54] revelation and put this spirit on top of
[2:23:57] it that changed my life completely and I
[2:24:00] can't hold out against anybody I could
[2:24:02] bus it to your face I could tell you
[2:24:05] like it is but there's not one behind
[2:24:07] that I could slam me on the ground and
[2:24:09] roll on the floor with you
[2:24:10] but there was not one behind that I
[2:24:12] still love you but I will tell you the
[2:24:16] truth I wouldn't fool you I wouldn't I'm
[2:24:20] a guy I will tell you the truth because
[2:24:22] the truth alone would set you free so
[2:24:24] I'm not going to set you up if a
[2:24:26] cappella truth I may as well get on the
[2:24:28] pulpit ok Fatah be honest with you act a
[2:24:30] be honest with God won't give the Lord
[2:24:32] some breezes or glory that God
[2:24:35] hallelujah so certain things are like
[2:24:39] part of me is green inside of me I hope
[2:24:42] that I could impact and share some of it
[2:24:44] with you along life's journey that you
[2:24:46] could be empowered in your marriage in
[2:24:49] your as a husband as a wife as a father
[2:24:51] as a mother that you could be
[2:24:52] effectively empowered to deal with your
[2:24:54] challenges and issues or glory to God
[2:24:57] Amen see I can tell you love your wife
[2:24:59] and I not loving minds you go have a
[2:25:03] problem with brothers talking nights and
[2:25:05] sisters and between diseases nice and I
[2:25:06] catch either wife nice that's a problem
[2:25:08] that's a serious problem because charity
[2:25:10] because at home so that love how to
[2:25:12] express love is not talking him for poor
[2:25:16] soul of the world you say Oh Paula
[2:25:17] Danube unknown I'm not talking he gave
[2:25:19] His only begotten Son
[2:25:21] so love is not talk I will say better
[2:25:24] than the Bell till till you ring it it
[2:25:25] may look like a bell but it was not
[2:25:27] nothing inside to make me noise as song
[2:25:32] as there are something to sing it it
[2:25:34] could be a poem
[2:25:36] love is not love until you could give it
[2:25:40] away love wasn't given for you to stay
[2:25:42] love was given for you to give it away
[2:25:44] so you have to give love not you're
[2:25:48] looking for love looking for love is a
[2:25:49] final any wrong person come to introduce
[2:25:52] you to love don't look for love receive
[2:25:57] love receive God's love be empowered
[2:26:01] love get off your selfishness and as
[2:26:03] soon as you begin to look out for others
[2:26:06] the quadrille look out for you I don't
[2:26:10] know why I'm saying all these thing but
[2:26:11] a punch I don't know why I am inside out
[2:26:14] there this morning but as soon as you
[2:26:16] begin to look out for others gobble look
[2:26:18] what for you or look out for your better
[2:26:21] look of wishes that don't talk them down

[2:26:26] know bother deliver them and I am
[2:26:28] passing sign for them I am preaching
[2:26:30] because I believe in God for them I know
[2:26:32] what was set you free because you are
[2:26:35] sons and daughters of God your spirit
[2:26:37] messed up that has nothing to do but
[2:26:42] that predestinated see that God's it in
[2:26:44] your soul may be seated
[2:26:54] [Music]
[2:26:57] there's a reason why we never proselyte
[2:27:01] it's a reason why I never said other
[2:27:05] person there's a reason why we don't
[2:27:06] backtalk and blasts other ministers and
[2:27:09] churches and groups it has always been
[2:27:11] this way it's not no we living like that
[2:27:15] we have always lived at one time I
[2:27:19] didn't want nobody from northern
[2:27:20] messages coming to this church is that
[2:27:23] right bird hungry
[2:27:24] I saw Express that and that's why I went
[2:27:27] any fees except prefer go and win
[2:27:28] sinners to the Lord and I mean I know I
[2:27:32] said it before and I see it again

[2:27:48] that and after six months the Lord spoke
[2:27:51] to me let me go back now and we have
[2:27:53] baptism after baptism after baptism

[2:28:02] the taught a certain way and yet almost
[2:28:04] on to teach them and citizen do come
[2:28:06] with your stuff so when sinners come I

[2:34:11] word now what is this messenger of
[2:34:13] Malachi 4 to do restore back the
[2:34:16] original fate yet the resurrection faith
[2:34:20] what is the faith that they seen Jesus
[2:34:23] after he was raised from the dead seen
[2:34:26] him working among them they were men of
[2:34:30] few words they went forth and preached
[2:34:33] the word oh my and I come to the last
[2:34:35] quote and I wrap up the service right
[2:34:36] here this is the part this is some
[2:34:39] condemnation by representation and he
[2:34:40] was praying he said let us pray now you
[2:34:43] think it's over it can play something he
[2:34:48] said Lord knowing that I'm immortal and
[2:34:51] soon I shall go my days are getting many
[2:34:55] nouns
[2:34:56] soon I'll be 52 years on this earth and
[2:34:58] Lord I want to be faithful I want to be
[2:35:02] true to the end around the world many
[2:35:04] many Nations people's tongues races seen
[2:35:06] many creeds and seen them how them mix
[2:35:09] them up and all their different emphases
[2:35:12] and frustrations when in those places
[2:35:14] there are many true children many men
[2:35:16] and women in those places over in that
[2:35:19] hybrid field that truly don't want to be
[2:35:21] there they think they are doing God's
[2:35:23] will I pray father this morning to take
[2:35:27] away all doubts from my little group
[2:35:28] here today and from those who will be
[2:35:31] listening on to the tapes that you will
[2:35:33] take away all the man-made creeds as
[2:35:36] Jesus when he came the first time he
[2:35:38] found them teaching thing that wasn't
[2:35:40] from the beginning father so it is now
[2:35:42] at the near coming of Jesus again
[2:35:45] just like the vine the divine put forth
[2:35:47] a branch and that branch was a
[2:35:49] Pentecostal branch filled with the Holy
[2:35:51] Ghost and signs and wonders of fruits
[2:35:53] fall in that branch if that vine ever
[2:35:55] put for another branch it will be the
[2:35:57] same kind of branch we know that father
[2:35:59] by nature itself but we do know that you
[2:36:02] can graft any fruit that's pertinent to
[2:36:04] that into the vine and we'll live by
[2:36:06] divine and we know that we can take
[2:36:09] orange tree and grow citrus fruits of
[2:36:11] different kinds seven or eight we can
[2:36:14] put lemons on it and it'll grow right in
[2:36:16] citrus fruit they will grow grapefruit
[2:36:17] or many others tangerines and so forth
[2:36:19] but if that tree brings forth its own
[2:36:22] branch it will be orange Lord as we like
[2:36:25] the first one was here we go and this is
[2:36:28] where I get the inspiration from for
[2:36:29] this morning and we believe there is to
[2:36:32] be a church in these last days that will
[2:36:35] receive both former and latter rain it
[2:36:38] will be scattered throughout the world
[2:36:39] in this loud Eastern Church age it will
[2:36:42] be a church that is called back to the
[2:36:44] original faith in God it will be a
[2:36:46] church that have Jesus Christ walking in
[2:36:48] it manifested himself and the shout of
[2:36:51] the king will be in it may the Lord
[2:36:54] bless she was we want to stand and
[2:36:55] worship Father God I pray in the name of
[2:36:58] Jesus to break every banner off the
[2:36:59] people set them free today and bless
[2:37:02] them in a powerful way father with
[2:37:04] Baptist not the baptism Lord celery
[2:37:06] famine among young people inspire souls
[2:37:09] to press on to the kingdom of God in
[2:37:11] Jesus and we ask it amen and amen

[3:02:30] salute you in a special way and beyond
[3:02:32] that if you would like to a system is
[3:02:34] regard
[3:02:35] we'd ask you to please speak with a
[3:02:37] Stephen Oliveri
[3:02:38] if you want to join one of these groups
[3:02:40] to give support we have a
[3:02:42] an approach to share the responsibility
[3:02:44] of either group so no one should have
[3:02:46] the burden all the time so this group
[3:02:48] system she has the burden so we really
[3:02:51] appreciate the support and we encourage
[3:02:53] you to get involved if you have not

[3:02:57] choir practice after the service today
[3:03:00] so members take note and we also want to
[3:03:04] remind the church of the upcoming
[3:03:07] convention July 10th 11th and 12th of
[3:03:10] 2020 and we only begin to put things in
[3:03:13] place for that so we solicit your
[3:03:15] support in every way that you can and in
[3:03:18] particular with respect to pledges and
[3:03:20] commitments the sisters will be
[3:03:22] downstairs and we appreciate if you
[3:03:25] could at least let us know what you can
[3:03:27] do we don't pressure you but we pray
[3:03:30] that God will put it up on your heart so
[3:03:32] that we could put things in place so we
[3:03:34] could have a wonderful time in the Lord
[3:03:36] this year as God has blessed us every
[3:03:38] year that we have had the convention we
[3:03:41] are looking to go another round higher
[3:03:43] this year and who knows this may be the
[3:03:46] last one we will have we don't know we
[3:03:48] see things are happening all around us
[3:03:50] we see the signs and the world signs in
[3:03:53] the economy signs with viruses and
[3:03:55] plagues and all these things so we know
[3:03:57] it's not too much time left
[3:03:58] so we want to do all that we couldn't do
[3:04:00] while we have the strength to do it no
[3:04:04] we're not our families have to come in
[3:04:06] and our loved ones have to come in and
[3:04:08] we have to add the full food value of
[3:04:10] the word so that as the dynamics pause
[3:04:13] upon the mechanics we can reproduce the
[3:04:15] seed that God has placed in us a men so
[3:04:19] in addition we are going through a
[3:04:21] process of updating or church system or
[3:04:25] Church database or church records so
[3:04:27] that we can effectively communicate and
[3:04:30] keep track of certain things many of you
