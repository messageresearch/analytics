minister to us as the word goes forth me healing rain pour out in this sanctuary healing Wayne pour out downstairs Lord and those who are connected on the internet made a healing power of God minister to them wherever they are in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen before we go any further I do want to read prayer requests before I start this morning musician can play something softly we have a prayer request from sister Christine for Naomi who is currently experiencing body pain when I remember her in prayer form by the Mike Blackman for chasse Sammy well his grandson who was an attack of the flu and headaches from looks like sister Tricia Gomez I believe seeking divine intervention for an altercation that took place on Friday with Daniel where he was attacked in Sanger grandi coming from school by six men and we also want to remember sister oven in prayer she's not feeling well throwing up and different things this morning so a little bit is with

one more time Heavenly Father Lord we allure come to your throne once more Lord bring these prayer requests before you Lord for little Naomi experiencing peens in her body Lord by the power the

you saw every hand that was raised this morning may you minister to your sons and daughters may you touch every situation every condition and by the time the service is over may there be streams of notes of praises because as the word goes for there's power word of the Living God and you promise that when the word goes for the spirit has to follow because the word is the conductor of the scrip may there be a transfer this morning from the banks of heaven into the accounts of the sons and daughters of the living club father you promised to heal you promised to deliver you promised to break every chain and every shackle how do we give this service over to you in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen and amen so I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ and if you have your Bibles you just want to read from one portion of Scripture reading from Revelation chapter 3 and reading from verse 11 revelation 3 and verse 11 behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and I will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because they'll say as I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint and I swear I saw that now me as sea as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord this morning it's certainly a great privilege to be able to come to the house of the Lord this morning it is what we do it is what motivates us it is what inspires us it's where we get encouragement is where we get a battle plan to face the week the feast a month to face challenges it's where we get a word from the Lord to deal with our situation because every answer for our lives is in the word of Almighty God every answer to every situation can be found in the word of the Lord the psychologist Scott ride a psychiatrist could try counselors could try but in the word of the Lord is the answer to every problem that you could ever find on this journey you could find the answer in the word of the Lord amen and how blessed have we been in the midweek services what a blessing last Wednesday what a blessing on Friday amen and special announcement this week this week midweek services will be on Wednesday of this week this week there'll be no Friday night service for this week we will have a youth service on Saturday at 5 p.m. so please take note midweek service this week will be on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. there will be no service on Friday instead we will have a Saturday youth service at 5 p.m. for the entire church so make every effort to be there because we have to do all that we can do when we can do it there comes a time when your energy is that as strong as it was and then many people look back and say I wish I had done more I wish I had done more and that living with that regret of having the opportunity to do more and not doing more puts us in a very precarious position because one day we all have to give an account and we don't want to be found standing and seeing I wish I had done more I wish I had prayed more I wish I had sacrificed more I wish I had done more so while there was strength and life in us we want to do all that we can do for the kingdom of God because heaven and earth will pass away but this kingdom of which we preach will never pass away it is from eternity it is eternal and if there's a seed German your soul there is something in you that will pulse it no matter what you did last week last year last month once you come in contact with the spirit and the word that seed in you has no choice but to respond because you have no control over the seed in you that's why the Prophet said we are not even to believe us but the word in us that we didn't put there that's the believer and that believing seed in our souls is programmed to respond a certain way because once you come and contact with the presence of Almighty God I made a word of Almighty God it does something to the seed in your soul you could try to cover it up you could try to hide it you could try to put the fire out with your work schedule and with family issues and drown yourself with problems but five minutes in the presence of God it's all it ticks without schita to let you know I'm still here but waiting for a long time to be reminded at to remind you that you are called for a higher purpose you are not called to be defeated you want to call to be a church remember you are not call just to be a message believer but you are called to be a participator and a partaker of his divine nature there's a nature and we are born to enjoy there's a life that we are born to enjoy and the devil's job is to try to keep us from that and he does a good job of that but we also have a job to do we have a job to worship we have a job to press we have a job to fight we have a job to achieve our job to succeed we have a job to overcome we have a job to contend for the feet we have a job to fight for our lives because the devil wants our lies well we have a chop to fight for our lives you could choose to give up or you could choose the fighter you could choose to worship or you could choose to have a pity party and I see nobody knows the trouble I've seen he has time to talk about the trouble but the Bible tells us that the sufferings of this present time are not even worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us the sufferings of not being able to pay the bills is not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us the sovereigns in your marriage is not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed in us the sufferings on your job they are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us these sufferings are temporary pain is temporary sadness is temporary sickness is temporary being defeated is temporary having an identity crisis is temporary spiritual amnesia is temporary he in town around his temporary not knowing who you are is temporary you may be seated had it not been for the fall of Adam we would have been spoken into existence and we would have been spoken into existence with authority to speak to our situations but we bypassed off the often II and we came to this earth as a proving ground so that in Satan's Eden which he has had over six thousand years to perfect got to deploy some secret agents who look like the world they go to work just like everybody else go eat in places like restaurants with everybody else but there's something different about them there's a white light on the inside and there's an invisible light on the outside of so when you woke up this morning that that was raid I went crazy when you woke up this morning before I even cut off the bed the devil say he's up let's see what it's gonna do let's let's hope he stays defeated let's hope he worries about his pills left hope he worries about his problems but but when you begin to see it thank you Lord for waking me up the devil say oh boy oh boy today looks like it's going to be a problem every move you do gives the devil a headache I say let us give the devil the biggest migraine he has ever had since Jesus was in the wilderness let's confuse the devil let's confuse the devil this morning how do you confuse the devil by doing what he doesn't expect he may be seated that's how you confuse the devil by doing what he does not expect understand this the devil has one objective to keep you blind to your purpose because whether Branum taught us the moment the brain gets to know who she is she's invincible that's very powerful because it means you are already something else than you could even see I'll say that again you are already something else that you cannot even see you got up this morning and looked in the mirror and you saw yourself but when God not he didn't see what you saw or you don't hear me this morning and when you cut up this morning and the devil looked at you he didn't see what you saw because the devil understand the spiritual realm and when you're in the realm of the natural you see your pills you see your problems you see what happened and you're looking in the natural eye and the tablet seemed to open his eyes don't open his eyes don't let them see that he's a king don't let her see that she's a princess don't let them see that the essence are under the blood let them think that they are still tied like Johnny crow let keep walking around in circles but this morning no more circles this morning no more PM defeated this morning no more wondering who you are come to church Shaymin [Music] hallelujah hallelujah I'm just talking to you a little bit is that okay inside of this service here by the county just having a conversation this morning just having a conversation with life and the struggles of life but the random preacher might say why are we so tossed about why why we have all these ups and thousand because you this and all of that is is to try to keep us in this natural realm that's gonna feel away one day and the boss that puts pressure on you he's anointed to put pressure the friends in your schooling are doing it to do what they do your name is anointed to make noise early in the morning your name is anointed to put on the carnival music the Maxie you going to is anointed a Mac the traveler has a choice and he's operating under a law to do everything to influence you were there only two influences you either influenced from above or you're influenced from below so everywhere you go it's not about family and friends and work and chalk it's about influence because you have been marked for a destination the devil undoes --nt understand the full specifications that defines your existence because the devil dealt with David and David made a mistake the devil dealt with Moses and Moses made a mistake it's just when Jesus him it was an experience could never forget because this man suffered he wept he was hungry he went and suffer just as we as a man but the Bible said he didn't sin and then Jesus placed a seed in front of some predestinated people and said because I live you are gonna live also but he didn't tell you he did it because when you were born and you were going school and he will go into work and you in the path and you were drinking you didn't even know that you were carrying a present that there was something locked up in you you didn't even know when you did what you did there was something in you so we come to service to find out what God put in us and the church Shaymin and every time you come to church and you hear the word it's the seed in your soul see that's me that songs I did talking them on me wait a minute that's how I feel when I feel the anointing it makes me feel good it makes me feel satisfied if I could just have this all the time I'll be all right come to church Haman so I have a title this morning the rewards of the overcomers the rewards of the overcomers because when you overcome you ought to get something when you go to school and you overcome for one you kind of go to form two until you overcome form one if you don't overcome form one they will keep you informed one until at such time as you have overcome from one overcoming from one is required to experience form two and when you overcome from - you're not ready for form three when I was in school they would keep people back if they didn't overcome the form because you have to pass a test to face another test but the objective of going to school is got to say I overcome form one overcome for you could produce your level passes and those passes represent the rewards of the overcomers [Music] now when people are in school there are many excuses and then the excuses disappear when you hear some people story because they are people Hammerman in school they were students who struggle with electricity but at the end of the five years they overcame some who had no electricity had more qualification and those who had electricity so electricity was not the differentiator or the lack of electricity was not the differentiator it was that those that overcame had a tenacity had a Drive had a desire had a motivation there was something in them that said what my father went through I am NOT gonna go through I heard somebody say a few days ago he said I grew up in abject poverty and I said to myself when my son drives the university he's gonna drive in on his first day in a mercedes-benz and he said what he said is his family they say talking struffolis why are you talking so and he said I worked hard he's given a testimony I worked hard and I live to see the day my son went in a university he drove dinh in a mercedes-benz and he was telling a group of people he said until you say it it could never happen he said the first step in saying it because when you say it it puts it out there and this man I don't know how much of a Christian he is I don't know what his testimony is I'm seeing but did he read the scriptures we read because my Bible says if you shall see to this mountain be more and don't doubt it's gonna do something and natural men break into spiritual principles about speaking into existence and walking into it what about the Church of the Living God when we know from the prophets a message that the spoken word is the original seed and we are commanded as sons and daughters to begin to speak I'm gonna make it I'm gonna overcome I'm gonna get the Holy Ghost my son is be delivered I could see him delivered I could see him jumping in the church that's how we ought to speak I could see him doing no ma I could see nobody else to ignore my like my son I can see nobody else Alton like my daughter I can see my wife walking into church one day I'm not knowing what pull into the house of club that's how we ought to speak that's that's how Christians speak that's how sons of God speak that's how daughters of God speak you may be seated who tournament overcoming this morning life is a struggle that's a foundational fact of life it is designed to be a struggle it's a struggle for food if you study biology to see the strong survive so the lion who is slow and can't exhibits tells he will need because as he moves surely jungle everybody am coming vitami reach everybody go so depending on a situation that you have to overcome in you have to understand your terrain understand your challenge I would say to somebody recently that's why Paul could say to the strong I became strong to the weak I became weak because he understood that to overcome in different situations you can't use the same tactic all the time bear in mind the end game is to get the O levels from one form to form three from four from fact that's a journey but after the journey and their people the journey is different you know people who play sports in school I wasn't one of them the people look to different things and I said you're wrong with that and the journey is grit there are people that is 50 per her ailments in primary school and it's over like I want to go back to secondary school when they had no bills cuz I'm technically no bills no call from the bank to pay a credit card and school it was the best but that was a stage in your journey because even though all levels is a stage to prepare you for a job and life is about stages and God is also about stages so when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a job when I became a man I want to go back to primary school when I begin a man I put away the childish things when I become a man I listen each I'm getting older doesn't make you a man there's some 50 year old boy still in primary school because as you get older it should be you get more mature that's that's by design but that's not how everybody lives because we allow different situation and we and we try to preserve an unchanged it's what's hard we don't like interruption we don't like disruption we like to do things the same way so whenever change comes in it makes us feel uncomfortable but God is it was of change you call Abraham he say Abraham leave your family leave your comfort zone and come follow me Abraham had no idea where he was going he was being challenged to change him I'm coming into this walk I want to call it this walk not Church coming into this walk it requires a mindset of change of growth of development of having to overcome and positive this way I die daily so this overcoming we are speaking about is a daily overcoming it's overcoming when the pastor is not there to see you overcoming when the deacon is not around it's overcoming when nobody from church is there and you are confronted with decisions and you are challenged to overcome we're gonna we're gonna get to the deeper part I'm just I'm still talking to you this morning because people tell me I'm struggling and I'm struggling and they see it as if it's not supposed to be that way as if the alternative to struggling is somehow not struggling and that doesn't exist struggling is a permanent state of existence for the believer you struggle to pray you you struggle to seek the Lord you you struggle because we are in a war fear and until we put the devil firmly under our feet it will always be a battle every inch of ground you intend to take will be a struggle a struggle in your marriage or struggle in your finances a struggle in your prayer life I struggle to praise a struggle to worship that's why TV can see we bring a sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord sacrifices struggle you have a choice to make the live or die to worship was to death to give God praise or stay where you will but to him that overcometh I have rewards for the overcomers hallelujah you may be seated the challenge I have is people who look at those who study hmmm in school either Elmer boy you know they're merely when he books when he books you need books car I saw some young people buckle under pressure I know and I cannot come and play and life is choice so when you confronted with a situation if you leave your books because your friends selling your yo-yo mid and you don't want to be another Wendy Henry's outcome and there's some students who they play all day in school but at night the beaten book yeah well kinda at night the beat in a real book I want the results coming but you explained only time who you get nine ones I was studying that night now you can't get effects with somebody who put the time and effort into achieving go to just remarried he don't know what day and night and he will have good success you can't vet somebody who have good success because their merit it really would be a night see a man bless he is gone ready like him then why he getting a blessing and you don't know the hours he and you would when in his secret closet when you're not looking for attention and nobody there but he crying and he holding onto the horns of the altar because the Bible told us pray in secret so that the God that sees in secret will reward you openly all of that is the struggle but to meet time to pray to make time to study to make time to be a Christian you have to overcome how you manage your time you have to overcome the demands of your life your work your commitments I remember when I was in university soon the bellringer had no bail but soon car has denied out I had no reason to see to do what to do what and I saw young people go to university I went class done time the lime lime to do what after all these years was he equals I'm on that blame what does the enemies are worried off the show for all the hours you spend Lyman what is the equal sign of time not spent into what is eternal because when you spend time into what is temporal there will never be anything to show for it but when you spend time in the eternal there's an eternal house there's an eternal Road with gold on it is it there's an eternal testimony because you are investing in your in who you really are can the church seem and is this helping anybody this morning and the message crisis revealed as all word I'm gonna take my time this morning so buckle your seatbelts I wasn't feeling 100% good this morning but no I feel 100% good but economy there's some viruses good around it that was twenty what I've had me this morning but I really want to appreciate my wife with some ginger tea without sugar this morning and some warm water with apple cider vinegar and just what he talked to order to give the devil trouble so if you need to take apple cider and water even neater ginger tea or green tea or whatever you take you make sure you come to the house of the Lord at least come the devil if you have no teeth if you're walking and I can use the cane as a weapon but whatever you clock like shamba he does a table scored and use what he had because there was a cause there was a need there was a situation your heart palpitates him we'll take it easy but keep coming blood pressure low take it easy but keep coming breakfast I I take it easy but keep coming but whatever you do keep on moving everything you getting closer to your inheritance closer to your portion and when it looks like you're getting older every step you really getting younger because there's another body waiting for you a spiritual body to hold the seed in your soul and you are temporarily carrying because these sixteen elements one day there'll be no more but we are from another place another dimension a place where there's no sickness no sadness no depression no fear no confusion no mortgage no pearls no ups and tolls that's where we come from and David he's waiting for me Joshua is waiting from me Moses is waiting for me to find out how you made it over how did you survive 2018 of how did you survive this internet age somebody preach back to me can we get the Lord a shout of praise [Music] [Applause] and this is my inspiration here this morning from the message crisis revealed his own word preached in Jeffersonville Indiana August 22nd 1965 knowing that what we see this morning we mustn't just see because we are gathered together that just haphazardly speak on anything but it is it's something that will help stabilize the people listen why we need the stabilization for we are going to pass through dangerous treacherous waters we're already sealing through them and sometimes I guess it's with you like it is with me so the Prophet is saying the waters he going through I don't know how it is for you but I can tell you what me is that it seems like so much of it it's such a scary so the Prophet as numerous visitations of angels and the Prophet is saying we want to see something this morning because we're gonna pass through some dangerous waters you're gonna pass through moments in our lives that we can't explain up we don't understand out there Lord why me why I have to go through this I serve you all these years why my children are struggling so you're I'm gonna see in those treacherous waters just keep on walking just keep on walking just keep on praying just keep on pressing because for all of your family that's not here you are the wave she you are who's rolling on for your brother holding on to your sister on and on for your family and God has not forgotten you those things that are revealed belong to us and to our children can the church Shaymin so you are born to overcome you are born to be successful I'm gonna stop when natural says say that spiritually you are born to be successful where the Branham said ladies you are closed advertisement board so when people want to see Jesus God already send sons and daughters we wouldn't advertise if you are an advertisement port for God and you ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth because the purpose of an advertisement is to bring people to buy the product that you advertising and this product that we have has no price but it's a good product people just don't know how good it is people just don't know how good Jesus is people don't know that is a solution when you're sick we don't need to go by the doctor and people need to know so this morning I'm just somebody I'm not nobody trying to tell everybody about somebody who could save anybody I want to be a good advertisement for Jesus I want to be a good representative of the kingdom and for me to be a good representative I've got to be on fire I've got to have joy I've got to have the Holy Ghost I've got to have seven living voices [Music] can the church say men so you are born to overcome overcoming is built in the fact that you are here already speaks of the fact that you are an overcomer because you couldn't just come to this church this morning let's go call you you couldn't be here this morning unless God spoke to your heart there are many churches you could go to but not this one for you to come to this church this morning there has to be something in you that's connected to your eternal destination this is not a Catholic Church not a Methodist Church and a Pentecostal Church these are our body of believers with three kinds of believers but I'm not speaking than am a believer this morning or the unbeliever this morning because only the true believers can overcome but the pranam said God can only prove his word by true believers so there's got to be some true believers who believe in their heart that deliverance will not come from man what it will come from God himself up he will raise the winds he will bring the storms up he will bring the earthquakes up but he will have every Sun every part of every predestinated seed I don't care it it at this morning they've got to come go give the Lord a shout of praise somebody give him praise this morning you are gonna be healer you are gonna be deliverer you are gonna overcome you are gonna get the Holy Ghost the pillar of fire is gonna visit your house the pillar of fire is going to visit your job the pillar of fire is going to visit your son the pillar of fire will visit your daughter it's got to happen how do you know God said it the Prophet spoke it that settles it for me this morning and this morning the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy we are seeing what the tapes I'm not crazy I'm not crazy I have not lost it enough I want to lose it some more I want to lose myself in the love of God I want to lose myself in the goodness of Jesus I wonder sing to run over I want this cup to run over till everybody must know this person is different this young man is different this young woman is different can the church say man you are going to overcome young brother young sister I don't care what the world offers you it's built in you to overcome the desires of this world you may be seated the fashions the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life it's built in you to overcome its built-in don't M you can do it don't tell me you can dress like a Christian don't tell me you kind of act like a Christian don't tell me in his hat it's not hard for you because you are built to struggle it's hard for listen it's hard for a car to fly ever punch it's hard for a car to fly it's not built to fly but the inner is also hard for plane to fly because when a plane takes off it must pass the sound barrier it must break out of gravity that's not easy it's hard the difference is the plane is built to fly let me see it another way if you look at a fish until you fish a climb this tree the fish will always be a failure because the fish wasn't built to climb a tree but a young boy climb the tree it'll take a while to get comfortable with how to climb a tree because if anything you don't know it's difficult anything that's new it'll take some time some experience some experimentation some experiential learning for you to to be able to do it so the difficulty will always exist the differences if you are built to do it and that's what we're seeing this morning you are built to overcome you are built to break past gravity you are built to break past like the lily who can press through the pond that Lily is built for it somebody Branson is pushes through the mud it pushes through the mire it pushes should have felt and it breaks out and that's what we want to do this morning break out break free break pass every limitation break pass every obstacle now if you know your destination and you know what you're built to do and you want you're built for how can you get caught up in petty nonsense well I'm saying back because he did tell me something I never really and then that and you look fit I didn't look fit but you are built for higher purpose I said you put them did nobody nobody can make you do anything your actions are always your choice yeah every set of people trying to fake fight of faith who in the back hold my back hold the back and happy times boosting already afraid man who on the back why Adam he tell me he did you have to accept responsibility for every action every word you can't blame your wife you can't blame your husband you can't blame me boss the company taxi driver you really should affect your vex your vex you wish the Church of X but it's taxi driver this what I'd have to do with your walk with God usually a you vex somebody I'd shake your hand you there half this is it thank you a whole half service to warm up who all have you missed the whole half of the service because you just dealing with products so and so didn't greet here long stairs and for the whole half service us see any preacher this one leader you seen this brother so-and-so pass you straight and it's a loop in your mind that's it enough you're my inner we transfer may be renewing of your - reboot resets the Lord reset this computer be transformed by the renewing of your minds of ollie to reboot your mind cast own reason class down imagination cast it down and when you come to the house of God you know coming to friends you look up and see people you come in for your inheritance you come for your portion you come because your body and theme and the best place to be when pain is in the house of God because healing is a children's bread we eat healing for breakfast that's what we do it's our bread is our food here's our shoe bread he is our God and if nobody wants to worship that's Tim that nothing to do with me I was born to worship and the hour cometh and now is that the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth born to overcome born to worship want to put the devil under your feet hallelujah it doesn't matter the situation in your job in your school it doesn't matter everywhere you go you have a testimony I said it indigo Martin a couple months ago has a listen find out from hearing your neighbors where your testimony and if you're Robert estimate your neighbors even revisit it has no money find out your testimony from your co-workers because if your co-workers not sure your Christian something wrong with your testimony listen don't don't have anybody guess who you are your neighbors must say listen that house right there that houses the Christian homes I tell you now house a Christian oh let it not be today have a service in by your house and I say we I didn't know there was no you're singing really really and that's why some of us have a challenge inviting people a traditional because when you invite people now people who are around here cannot hold your more accountable I was I was ready doing a commission of inquiry into the inviting ratio and for the source of the problem because even a testimony becomes easy because people ask you why I'm so happy why there's trouble in the economy but yet still you're happy you see what the Lord is my provider how do I come and contact with that Lord who provided for you because all of us had trouble but if he if you have somebody could arrive you I want to meet him too inviting people to the house of God should be the easiest thing to do because this is the best product you could ever touch this is the only product that have healing salvation Redemption adoption deliverance and even stuff that hasn't been this plated missing limbs be restored is part of our package and we got and this is only how hard is it and when you can tell somebody I mean best part it free you gotta pee if it gets come and worship just come and enjoy just come on dance just come on sing yes come on shout let's come and give God praise there's no cost there's no price he died for you [Applause] give the Lord a shout of praise I haven't even gotten to the message I was still having a conversation one day where the Terri will just break from the church into the eternal realm might forget you says you know Alberta Raymond said last week he said Enoch was walking with God and then one day his foot just hit the Kings Highway oh my oh what a thought he is walking and I'm one of your foot hit the Kings Highway one of these morning between 6:00 and 9:00 you'll be on your road to the maxi on the taxi and your foot will hit the Kings Highway and we'll be gone I'm looking for that tease anybody else looking for that day then can you come and go with me to my father's house where is joy unspeakable and full of glory all right you may be seated now let's go back to Genesis God in his mind because you see the challenges this when people get things easily you'll lose it easy I'll say that again when you get stuff easy you lose it easily so there are many stories of businessmen who started with nothing and they sacrifice and when he had a story to say they eat pig and butter for 10 years 15 years to work to build something up this sacrifice but their children didn't understand or when should he sacrifice that they went through so anytime company children to take over business there are many businesses that took 14 years to build up and two years to go down because there was no sacrifice to build there was no pain in growth so Jesus and God himself rather when Adam was put in a Garden of Eden Adam didn't earn anything he didn't earn character from experience from pain but on the other side he had Jesus not obedience by the thing that he suffered but Adam it was handed to him on a platter for the Georgia sea and because of how it was cotton it could have been easily lost and God pledged it will not be like that ever again the power to reach to anybody they must have character and to get character character comes by trials by testing by giving you exams by putting you under pressure to see how you would handle certain situations because if you do improve how you will handle it so the promises of an overcomer that was built into Scripture Adam could have never enjoyed because he had never overcome anything just like the Angels never had anything to overcome Adam had no trials no tests no problems no sufferings no financial problems no problems in his marriage no all the animals listen to him Nonnie early animals back shot when he mountains was spoken to the mountains moved Adam had nothing to overcome Adam could have never been called an overcomer because there was nothing to overcome everybody with me Adam had a book of names and Adams mission was just to call from this book of memes the time and season and they were could be made manifest but Adams Ellingson before he had the chance to call one name can assure it's a man but in that book in the book that Adam had but the Branham said there's a category of that book which he tied to scripture it says in revelation 3:5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels so there's a section of the book that has do not remove that their names could never be blacked out because they overcome you know what it is to know that you overcome and God say listen you overcome that name could never come out because that type of overcoming God honors that type of overcoming somebody preached back to me so one of the rewards of the overcomers is to he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name so am i preaching overcomers this morning and for those of you who have been long on the overcoming scale you try to overcome sometimes you want to overcome some things and it would want to overcome anything that you want to overcome but it's in that you know wonder overcome you don't want to overcome missing life is about choice so things you want to overcome you want anything to do at that you enjoy you want blessing with a nice car Laura you know overcome and if I get a car do everything to get it Caillou 1 overcome you overcome your driver's license you but you've already bank and you see pray for me I want to get his bank loan to any car you overcome that it's tank or any overcome everything to do with what you like you happy to overcome it tengo for the victory be bang gave you a hard time but he's able to scrape to get any money - meaning of atonement free car Angelica you overcome this the bank manager is saying you overcome the bank manager and once it's what you you happy to overcome and say you overcoming I overcoming to I get Iike but overcoming I'm talking about is overcoming in every area of your life overcoming when you don't feel like green but you still pray anyhow overcoming when you want to answer black but you overcome and you're still silent that's the overcoming we'd already won to do it because it goes against our very nature you overcome when you want you feel like staying home and when you overcome death and you press you to come to the house of God that's overcoming you overcome when you open your wardrobe and you look at your cloth to recognize we're gonna discuss a little too short I have to overcome and burn it finally Amen Saturn you overcoming it already here just honey here just to tell you well if we just clip the ends or somebody please back to me are we having church this morning and your over comments you don't worry about them ends a lot we'll take you on the end of somebody preach flat to me this morning can we talk about overcoming overcoming when the boys come to the young sisters and say look and you overcome and you walk away because you know you are princess you born of a king and God has a prince for you you overcome want to overcome every temptation every desire every opportunity that the devil presents your way you overcome it because you are born to overcome overcome music but with a nice song it it is a nice song it's slow its it'll put any mood what mood but they overcome overcome the music that's supposed to be Christian music - that makes you want to dance not like a Christian but he devil using all it is to to pull you down and you're overcome method see that's not what motivates me [Music] yeah appetite is changing your desires changing you don't want to look sexy that's not your objective you reject that you overcome that you're bigger than that you're more precious than then you overcome though he slay me yet still I trust them I'm an overcomer but they laugh at me in school you are an overcomer let them laugh it does not matter porn to overcome I said it um and many Youth Services say young sisters you don't need to put on makeup or semi makeup or half makeup or quarter makeup god made you beautiful as you are if those worldly ladies need makeup to look at that's damn that's not you feel sorry for them you need to drink to be a man smoke to be a man run woman to be a man that you overcome all of that and that's a baby stop you gotta babysit present your bodies a living sacrifice that's your reasonable service reasonable having a testimony to millions or to Colonel we in the flesh too much and it's impossible to be in the flesh if you know that and you pray in any Italian and seeking the Lord it's impossible to get off your knees and say boy you touch my things for if you were praying and that's your quick response from praying I don't know what anointing you was just breathe but when you pray me get him on something the services don't know Lord this is a test and he let God work it out say Lord I leave this one to you because if I had it I would have a little wrong so I want to get back and it's a different consciousness it's conscious that every way you go God goes with you when you walk into your job he is looking there for you and if everywhere you walk you know he's dear how would we speak how would we live how would we act how would we dress what would we see the rewards of the overcomers so I'm speaking to over comers because in every area of your life you must overcome hallelujah and the message how can I overcome but the balance that I think that the church maybe should be taking this a step higher at this time and that's what I'm pushing for to go a little higher at this time and where the problem said in the same message how can I overcome now we're speaking on this overcoming the word overcome of course you know what it means you've got to have something to overcome there is a Goliath in all of our lives God sets up stuff in our lives for us to overcome it will not be the same for you it will not be the same for you but there'll be stuff in your life for some of us is gossip for some of us itself we just have so much self god within a break that self to pieces for some of us we just holy we didn't our mind we holy and we judge everybody by your standard not your word now by your standard I don't do this and that's why the Upper Room brought it equal and when we come to church is no big you little me listen I am no way no way above nobody no I am here this morning preaching to myself so even thought I was talking about you you're wrong I preached it myself I want to be different I want to change I want to be a real Christian in my heart I want to walk like you might want to talk like him I want to live like him I wanna act like him I wanna be like him when people see me they must not talk that's a Christian when they see me they must take note that I've been with Jesus that's my desire is it your desire then if it's your desire may appear unto you according to your heart's desire I asked a question this morning if Almighty God would grant the desire of your heart right now what is that desire if right now he were to grant to decide what is your desire just this morning why did you come to church this morning is it to go back home is it to just be in church or is it to be change to be transformed cut out the evil ways of get closer to him to know who you are to want to change your appetite from the things of the world from your own desires and is the Lord yeah yeah my lord send me Lord I don't have much but I given you all I have Lord I mean me this morning I've been coming up a long time but I need something more this morning than yesterday I'm ready to overcome myself you know but I better say see when you lift your hand as a sign of surrender when you surrender your efforts your activity Lord I give up I've tried my own way but lord I surrender but the random said you've got to have something to overcome and this church age that the Holy Spirit was speaking about here at the lair of CNC age as we have been through it needed a rebuking Laodicea had to be rebuked because it was different towards Christ in other words the attitude towards Christ was a little different it is not how it was supposed to be what I would used to be but it was a little different and if you are here this morning and your attitude towards God is a little different then you need a rebuking it had put Christ outside in the age and Christ was on the outside trying to get back on the inside but the man said that's love and this morning he is he said if he said I stand at the door and knock and if any man here this morning open open his heart I will come in he's not trying to break down your heart he's there to break it to your house into your family but he's there knocking on the door of your heart this morning so you can overcome more than you've ever overcome before because greater is he that will be in you than he that's in the world is there anybody want to let him in this morning let him in every area of your heart he is still standing at the door this morning knocking on the doors of your heart young brother young sister father mother I don't care where you stand what you have done what you achieve he wants to take over more of you than he has ever had before don't reject him don't turn him away don't turn him away young sister don't turn him away young brother don't turn him away backslider don't turn him away unbeliever don't turn him away mama don't turn him away Papa open up this morning he is knocking he wants to tell you it's a wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire I believe in my heart before this services over healings will break forth I believe in my heart that before this service is over a backslider will be restored I believe in my heart before this service is over yes somebody could be filled with a baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire I asked is anything too hard for the Lord this morning listen to the Prophet he said that's love that's a lot of people don't know what love is but he said that's love we were born for him to be there we are the ones who put him out but the problem said if you want to find God he said God is right wherever you left him because he will never leave you he said if you want to reconnect with God go back the way you walked away because it's not in God to walk away it's not his nature to walk away he is the one that goes after the one sheepies don't wanna knock on the door he's the one that oh come on somebody preach back to me it's not in his nature to abandon you said I will never leave you I'll never forsake you so if you have lost your connection God the Prophet said walk back trace black your steps to where you left him because he will never leave you I don't feel the annoying thing anymore I don't feel I'm praying anymore I don't feel I don't blame God for that don't hold court accountable for that that's nothing to him that's on you reverse your steps walk back to the altar this morning and say Lord I'm sorry for walking away I'm sorry for missing church I'm sorry for not praying and I'm coming back to the heart of worship coming back up I'm coming back to a house of worship we let our time getting away we let our commitments get it away and God is still there you still even when we walk away he's still knocking he's still knocking this morning he's still knocking this morning he's still knocking he's still knocking he's still knocking he's still knocking trying to get control control of your life because when he is at the control of your life the situations around you you can finally put it in your control when he is in control it gives you authority and to be in control because Ed I am the vine ye are the branches so when he is connected to you suddenly your world begins to change because you are connected in a source of power the source of authority the source of the spoken word is that when you came to church here this morning for always this look go back home and live this see me you live last week let it not be another week live in the same way no more walking around in circles doing the Deaf walk as a prophet spoke about but this morning as for me and my house we will serve the Lord I don't care if they are in the church this morning but so me and my house we will serve the Lord we will speak for families we will call their names we will anoint deliverance we will apply the blood on our houses and they have to come because it's a promise the promises unto you and to your children and to ten that are far off there's nobody that going too far that God cannot call back our god is a god of the impossible he's a god of deliverance he's a God of miracles this morning miracle working God supernaturally healer mighty deliver a strong tower hallelujah hallelujah he may be seated but a Clarence we have the devil on the ropes and we're not gonna let up until he lets you go I'm sick and tired it has to come a point in your life that you are sick and tired of the way things are and the way things work and that drives you to change and it drives you the desperation stop accepting failure as your promise stop accepting defeat as your promise stop accepting it it's not yours your promises the Holy Ghost Elam victory blessings bounty harvest that's your promise he said I will be your God and you will be my people that's your promise Oh glory to God god bless you ever you are this morning hallelujah our job is to make heaven high and to preach hello hot and to let you know that God has a day and a time and an appointment for you and if your name is on the book there is no devil there is no demon there is no pass there is no situation that could stop you from coming to God he said my sheep hear my voice sheep didn't know my voice yes sheep oh come on somebody please back to me this morning let us not be a tradition to you let us not be a routine for you let us not be something that you just do because you want to come to church the road to hell is paved with good intentions people have good intentions plenty plans plenty things they want to do and good heart good desires but God is not measuring heart and he's he's looking for that life if the desire the intention and the heart doesn't translate into our life it's not enough you have to overcome I want to continue but now notice in school here is not to just the church he that overcometh see not the church that would be she see the church body but it's he that overcometh and by the branch had overcome and keeps life in you so when you back up and backslide and say well because under pressure that's why you're not seeing man and because under pressure I just going through something you're dying but overcoming keeps life in you overcoming keeps life in you overcoming keeps you alive the Bible is a book of overcoming this message this morning is immeasurable will come and when calling the beginning said let there be light that like to overcome the darkness that was there the very first beginning of Genesis and God said let there be light that's where overcoming started and the darkness had to back up because light and tactics cannot stay in the same house and against darkness in your house this morning we said let there be light
