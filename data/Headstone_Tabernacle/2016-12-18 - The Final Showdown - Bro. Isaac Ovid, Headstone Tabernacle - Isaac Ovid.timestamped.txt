[36:51] a strong as I would like to feel but I
[36:54] want the devil to know whose side I am I
[36:57] may be wounded but I still want the
[36:59] devil to know whose side I'm on I may
[37:01] have lost my foot but I want the devil
[37:03] to know whose side I'm on my wing may be
[37:06] broken but I still want the devil to
[37:08] know whose side I'm on I may have been I
[37:10] may have had a rough year this year but
[37:13] I still want the devil to know whose
[37:15] side I'm on I may have lost friends and
[37:17] lost favor and lost family but I still
[37:20] want to let the devil know who side I'm
[37:22] on because
[37:24] as you may be seated
[37:27] I don't want to get ahead of myself but
[37:29] greetings in the precious name of the
[37:31] Lord Jesus Christ and welcome to the
[37:33] last service the last Sunday service of
[37:36] 2016 just to make some announcements uh
[37:40] there will be no Sunday service next
[37:42] Sunday Lord willing to close out this
[37:45] year there will just be two Thursday
[37:46] services this Thursday ahead of us next
[37:49] week Thursday both at the Tabernacle and
[37:51] our all Year's night service which will
[37:53] be on the 31st Saturday at 10 p.m.
[37:58] in addition this week ahead of us
[38:00] brother and myself will'll be flying out
[38:02] to South Africa to the convention hosted
[38:05] by brother Raymond Thompson so we are
[38:07] under great expectation with that do
[38:09] remember us in prayer both to travel and
[38:12] for God to break out our Revival in
[38:15] South Africa uh brother Raymond has been
[38:17] such a blessing to us for the last two
[38:19] years coming to the convention so we are
[38:21] very honored to fly over there to join
[38:23] with him as he hosts his convention over
[38:25] there as well so may you remember us in
[38:28] prayer and throughout this whole season
[38:31] that is Christmas and everything that
[38:33] comes with it make sure you keep Jesus
[38:35] as a center of your joy the Center of
[38:38] Your Action I believe it was last year I
[38:42] was speaking uh in a similar time as
[38:44] this and I said it's so many people they
[38:47] spend time trying to do their painting
[38:49] and they apply their paint on their
[38:50] houses and they get things in order
[38:53] because they want things to be in a
[38:54] certain position for the Christmas and I
[38:56] want to know how many people were
[38:58] applying the
[39:00] token because it's easy to apply the
[39:02] paint and apply this and apply you want
[39:05] to put the decorations and you want to
[39:06] make sure you have the the ham or the
[39:08] turkey or the whatever and at the end of
[39:10] the day you don't want to miss out
[39:11] applying the token because that's the
[39:14] real reason has been the message not
[39:17] just in December it's the message in
[39:18] January it's the message in February in
[39:21] March in April in May June is the
[39:23] message every single Sunday apply the
[39:26] token but the brandom told the brandom
[39:28] Tabernacle don't just hear the messenger
[39:31] don't just say I believe the message but
[39:33] do what the messenger says which is to
[39:35] apply the token apply it all over your
[39:38] house apply it in your bedroom apply it
[39:40] on your life apply it in your car apply
[39:43] it all over you just apply the
[39:45] token because that's the only thing that
[39:47] will last can the church say Amen so I
[39:51] do want to recognize and appreciate
[39:53] brother O's message last week how many
[39:54] appreciate
[39:56] him for his burden for his labor what a
[39:59] masterpiece that was so I'm under great
[40:02] expectation for God to speak to us today
[40:05] I am totally dependent upon him thank
[40:07] you musicians you appreciate brother
[40:08] Anthony with the worship
[40:11] service so if you have your Bibles would
[40:13] you turn with me to three portions of
[40:18] scripture I have quite a bit of reading
[40:20] but I do want to get it all
[40:22] in so that we can deal with the subject
[40:27] at hand I want to start in the New
[40:29] Testament then we'll go to the Old
[40:32] Testament so we're going to read from
[40:34] Hebrews chapter
[40:36] 12 and we also going to be reading
[40:39] from First Kings
[40:42] 17 and
[40:46] 18 Hebrews 12 and verse
[40:51] 25 see that you refuse not him that
[40:55] speaketh for if they escape not to
[40:58] refuse him that spake on Earth much more
[41:01] shall not we escape if we turn away from
[41:04] him that speaketh from Heaven whose
[41:07] voice then shook the Earth but now he
[41:10] had promised saying yet once more I
[41:12] shake not the Earth only but also heaven
[41:16] and this word yet once more signifi it
[41:19] the removing of those things that are
[41:22] shaken as of things that are made that
[41:25] those things which cannot be shaken May
[41:28] remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom
[41:32] which cannot be moved let us have Grace
[41:35] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[41:37] reverence and godly fear for our God is
[41:41] a consuming
[41:43] fire and reading
[41:45] from First Kings 17 and reading verse 1
[41:51] First Kings 17 and reading verse one and
[41:55] Elijah The tishbite Who who was of the
[41:57] inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as
[42:01] the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[42:04] whom I stand there shall not be due nor
[42:08] rain these years but according to my
[42:11] word and reading First Kings 18 and
[42:14] reading verse one we going to read a bit
[42:18] here I may stop and then have us finish
[42:20] it but let's start and it came to pass
[42:23] after many days that the word of the
[42:25] Lord came to Elijah in the third years
[42:27] saying go show thyself unto Ahab and I
[42:30] will send rain upon the Earth and Elijah
[42:33] went to show himself unto Ahab and there
[42:36] was a sore famine in Samaria and Ahab
[42:39] called Obadiah which was the governor of
[42:41] his house now Obadiah feared the Lord
[42:44] greatly for it was so when Jezebel cut
[42:47] off the prophets of the Lord that
[42:49] Obadiah took and 100 and hid them by 50
[42:53] in a cave and fed them with bread and
[42:56] water and and Ahab said unto Obadiah go
[42:58] into the land unto all Fountains of
[43:01] water and unto all Brooks per Adventure
[43:04] we may find grass to save the horses and
[43:06] mules alive that we lose not all the
[43:08] beasts so they divided the land between
[43:11] them to pass throughout it Ahab went One
[43:14] Way by himself and Obadiah went another
[43:16] way by himself and Obadiah was in the
[43:19] way behold Elijah met him and he knew
[43:22] him and fell on his face and said art
[43:25] thou that my Lord Elijah elah and he
[43:28] answered him I am go tell thy Lord
[43:30] behold Elijah is here what a way to
[43:32] introduce yourself tell your boss that
[43:35] Elijah is here and and he said what have
[43:38] I sinned this is Obadiah speaking that
[43:40] thou would has delivered thy servant
[43:42] into the hand of Ahab to slay me as the
[43:46] Lord thy God liveth there is no Nation
[43:48] or Kingdom whether my Lord hath not sent
[43:51] to seek thee and when they said he is
[43:53] not there he took an oath of the kingdom
[43:55] and nation that they founded not and now
[43:58] thou sayest go tell thy Lord behold
[44:00] Elijah is here and it shall come to pass
[44:03] as soon as I am gone from thee that the
[44:06] spirit of the Lord shall carry thee with
[44:08] I know not and so when I come and tell
[44:11] Ahab that he cannot find thee he will
[44:13] slay me but I servant I thy servant fear
[44:17] the lord from my youth was it not told
[44:20] my Lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
[44:22] prophets of the Lord how I hid a 100 men
[44:25] of the Lord's Prophet by 50 in a cave
[44:27] and fed them with bread and water and
[44:29] now thou sayest go tell thy Lord behold
[44:32] Elijah is here that he may slay me and
[44:34] Elijah said as the Lord of hosts liveth
[44:36] before whom I stand I will surely show
[44:39] myself unto him today so Obadiah went to
[44:43] meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to
[44:45] meet Elijah and it came to pass when
[44:48] ABAB saw Elijah and a that Ahab said
[44:51] unto him art thou he that troubleth
[44:53] Israel and he answered I have not
[44:56] troubled Israel but but thou and thy
[44:58] father's house in that ye have forsaken
[45:00] the Commandments of the Lord and thou
[45:02] Hast followed bam now therefore send and
[45:05] gather to me all Israel unto Mount
[45:07] Carmel and the prophets of Baal 450 and
[45:11] the prophets of the Groves 400 with eat
[45:13] at Jezebel's table so Ahab sent unto all
[45:17] the children of Israel and gathered the
[45:19] prophets together unto Mount C and
[45:21] Elijah came unto all the people and said
[45:24] how long hold ye between two opinions if
[45:28] the Lord be God follow him but if bail
[45:31] then follow him and the people answered
[45:33] him not a word may the Lord had a
[45:35] blessing to the reading of his word you
[45:37] may be seated
[45:40] am so I have a title this
[45:43] morning and my title is the final
[45:46] showdown Hallelujah and I have a subject
[45:50] placed by fire into the kingdom that
[45:53] cannot be moved and an inspiration let
[45:57] the god that answer by fire let that God
[46:02] be God Amen everybody feeling fine amen
[46:05] So today we're going to talk about the
[46:07] fire we're going to talk about the Holy
[46:09] Ghost we're going to talk about the time
[46:11] of the manifestation of the Holy Ghost
[46:13] and we're also going to talk about the
[46:15] final showdown because the fire is
[46:18] coming to claim individuals into the
[46:20] kingdom the claiming is not by the
[46:22] church the claiming is not by the group
[46:24] The claiming is not by the pastor the
[46:27] claiming is by fire because the fire of
[46:30] God will place you into a kingdom his
[46:33] kingdom a kingdom that cannot be moved a
[46:35] kingdom that cannot be destroyed a
[46:38] kingdom that always was that always is
[46:40] and always will be a kingdom with a king
[46:43] who is the I am that I am he's the king
[46:46] of kings and the Lord of lords and today
[46:48] the Holy Ghost charity itself is here to
[46:51] place individuals into that Kingdom the
[46:54] Bible said and we read everything that
[46:57] can be shaken will be shaken churches
[47:00] will shake ministers will shake church
[47:02] members will shake politicians will
[47:05] shake the government will shake the
[47:07] police force will shake the criminals
[47:09] will shake men's heart failing for fear
[47:12] but the false anointed they will shake
[47:14] also your family will shake but not you
[47:18] fear not little flock it is my father's
[47:21] pleasure good pleasure to give unto you
[47:24] something give unto you a kingdom and
[47:26] entire Kingdom where he is king and you
[47:29] are priest and you are princes and you
[47:31] are sons of the king so we have a reason
[47:34] this morning to smile we have a reason
[47:37] this morning to be happy don't tell me
[47:39] that I should be sad I mean not have
[47:42] money in my pocket right now but my
[47:44] father is the king he is the king of
[47:46] kings he is the Lord of lords he is the
[47:50] Majesty he is bigger than your problem
[47:53] he is bigger than your trial he is
[47:56] bigger than and your situation he called
[47:59] you for a purpose for such a time as
[48:02] this for a final showdown oh we have
[48:05] waited a long time for this but I hear
[48:08] the clock ticking coming to an end uh we
[48:11] are about to break from time into
[48:13] eternity but before we leave this place
[48:16] there's going to be one more ride uh
[48:18] there's going to be one more battle
[48:20] every day is a battle when you wake up
[48:22] in the morning it's a battle when you
[48:24] lift your hand it's a battle but brandom
[48:27] said whenever you lift your hands you
[48:28] are Defying Gravity it's a battle it's a
[48:32] showdown When you pray it's a battle
[48:35] when you worship it's a battle that's
[48:37] why the Bible says bring the sacrifice
[48:40] of praise praise is a sacrifice because
[48:43] it's a sacrifice to worship when you
[48:45] don't feel like worshiping it's a
[48:48] sacrifice to lift your hands when you
[48:50] feel there's no reason to do so but you
[48:52] bring a sacrifice of praise into the
[48:55] house of the Lord uh and you offer up
[48:57] incense to him uh because you
[48:59] acknowledge that we are creatures of
[49:01] Eternity we are trapped in time uh but
[49:05] one of these days time will be no more
[49:08] time will
[49:10] finish can the church say Amen but
[49:13] before we leave this place uh there's
[49:15] going to be another Showdown uh God
[49:18] loves a showdown uh the devil made the
[49:20] mistake way back before the beginning
[49:24] way back there he got angels to worship
[49:26] ship him and there was war in heaven and
[49:29] there was a showdown in heaven it
[49:31] started there but we were represented
[49:34] here with Michael so when Michael drew
[49:36] his sword sons who rotated off of the
[49:39] presence of God who were Gene attributes
[49:42] of God who had the DNA from God they
[49:45] were compelled to draw their swords also
[49:49] there was no question about it it was
[49:51] Instinct for us uh because we are just
[49:55] like God we are just like our father so
[49:59] when Michael drew his sword you drew
[50:01] your sword also the devil wants you to
[50:04] forget that you are a warrior he wants
[50:07] you to forget that you are a fighter he
[50:10] wants you to forget that you are a
[50:11] trained soldier this is not new to you
[50:15] this is not strange to you this is what
[50:17] you were doing where was th when I lay
[50:20] the foundations of the earth and the
[50:23] morning Stars sank together and the
[50:25] children of God Shout for Joy this is
[50:28] what we were doing worship is not
[50:31] strange to us giving God praise is not
[50:34] foreign to us this is what we do this is
[50:38] who we are we are born to worship we are
[50:41] born to give him praise uh we are born
[50:44] to kick the devil out of our homes out
[50:47] of our families uh out of our bodies
[50:50] cancer has got to go diabetes has got to
[50:54] go sickness has got to go why because
[50:58] this is what we do we cast Devils out we
[51:02] cast demons out in Jesus name come the
[51:06] church say
[51:07] [Applause]
[51:19] amen hallelujah this is the last service
[51:22] for the year the last Sunday service so
[51:25] I'm going to give it all I got got I'm
[51:27] going to give it everything I got I want
[51:29] to let the devil know I don't care how
[51:31] January was how February was how march
[51:35] was how April was but this service is my
[51:39] service he may have had a voice all of
[51:42] this year but today it's my turn to say
[51:44] something the bride will have a voice
[51:47] the bride will speak and what we speak
[51:49] will come to pass so this morning we are
[51:52] prophesying the time is at hand uh s is
[51:55] this the time this morning we are
[51:57] prophesying there will be a Revival for
[52:00] the young people all you young people
[52:02] who are halfway in and halfway out we
[52:05] are speaking for you this morning God is
[52:08] going to arrest you he's going to arrest
[52:10] you he's going to lock you up uh he's
[52:12] going to put you in prison a prison of
[52:15] love that you can't even get out if you
[52:17] want to yes if you are sick in here this
[52:21] morning we are speaking a word your
[52:23] healing is happening right now and not
[52:26] even waiting for
[52:28] 2017 your family they already coming
[52:31] right now they don't even know it but
[52:34] they are being pulled just like Lazarus
[52:37] Lazarus come forth backslider come forth
[52:42] sick person come forth you who are
[52:45] depressed come forth God is
[52:51] able you may be seated you may be seated
[52:54] if you can I want you to understand the
[52:56] backdrop in First Kings 17 Elijah said
[53:01] not even due or rain is going to come
[53:05] unless I call for it and Elijah
[53:07] disappeared he went into safety he went
[53:10] into where God led him to be and King
[53:12] Ahab looked to the east looked to the
[53:15] West look to the north look to the South
[53:18] he couldn't find him they searched he's
[53:21] trying to know who is called who is
[53:23] predestinated but he can't find you
[53:25] because you're under the blood Elijah
[53:27] was covered he was protected he was in
[53:30] training he was in preparation but in 18
[53:33] it switched Ahab is going around his
[53:36] business and Elijah is ready to display
[53:39] who he is he is ready to come out of
[53:41] hiding you can't hide for long this
[53:44] morning we coming out to hide in the
[53:46] devil beat you up and you went into hide
[53:48] in but not this morning we are getting
[53:51] the permission by the word to come out
[53:54] of hiding you may be seated
[54:00] so Elijah comes out of hiding because we
[54:04] spoke a couple weeks ago God has never
[54:06] changed his strategy so when God wants
[54:08] to do something he could use hiding he
[54:11] could use manger he could use the
[54:13] burning bush he could use the walls of
[54:15] Jericho he could do whatever he want but
[54:17] when it's time for you to come out it's
[54:19] time for you to come out so Elijah
[54:21] taking a stroll he knows Ahab is going
[54:24] to be out there he knows over is going
[54:26] to be out here he know they're looking
[54:28] for him he said go tell your master that
[54:31] Elijah is here he pull out his business
[54:34] car yes this is that Elijah that Elijah
[54:38] he's been searching for he don't need to
[54:40] sent you a Hunting Party he don't need
[54:42] to look no more I've made myself
[54:44] available you may be seated over said no
[54:48] no no no no no no
[54:50] noall when I go and tell Ahab that you
[54:54] said that you are here but the moment I
[54:56] turn around you will disappear and go I
[54:58] don't know
[54:59] where and he will kill
[55:02] me amen Elijah said not this
[55:05] time it's time for a
[55:08] showdown the time for hiding is over the
[55:11] time for playing church is over the time
[55:14] for warming a church bench is over the
[55:16] time to say I'm in the message is over
[55:18] the time to be a rumor is over the time
[55:21] to be a name you hear from the distance
[55:22] is over this is going to be a showdown
[55:25] if God is God then serve him let the God
[55:29] and answer by fire let that that's the
[55:31] time we're talking about let the God and
[55:34] answer by fire you may be seated not
[55:37] answer by convention not answer by the
[55:39] type of service not answer by what is
[55:41] spoken but leted to God because the only
[55:44] Vindication the only evidence of The
[55:46] Showdown is when God himself answers and
[55:49] sends fire into your life that nobody
[55:52] could take away send fire in your house
[55:55] that the devil can and fight that
[55:57] Vindication is not from the ministers
[56:00] Association that Vindication is not from
[56:02] your family but it's God who sends the
[56:05] fire and this morning we say send the
[56:09] [Applause]
[56:13] fire can the church say Amen oh
[56:17] hallelujah
[56:19] hallelujah but a kind I didn't even
[56:21] check what time I came into the pulpit
[56:26] hallelujah amen
[56:28] amen amen fire is a powerful thing you
[56:32] know it that's why I love how God operas
[56:36] brother the Clarens because sometimes he
[56:37] have to force force the issue to get us
[56:40] to move where he wants us to move the
[56:42] prophet relates a story one time I think
[56:44] he saw a turtle and he say take a stick
[56:46] and tried to push it and it didn't move
[56:49] triy to throw something and it it didn't
[56:51] move but when he lit a
[56:53] fire Turtles had to do no more
[56:57] turtles have to move because fire do
[56:59] cause a response and some of you who
[57:01] don't want to lift your hands we take
[57:04] stick and try to push you we take stuff
[57:06] and try to thr it but when the fire
[57:09] comes you can't help yourself we say
[57:12] Lord send the fire may he answer by fire
[57:16] this morning all these years in the
[57:19] message what you need is an answer of
[57:20] fire fire in your soul fire in your mind
[57:24] all the things you're struggling to do
[57:26] and you're trying to hold on and you're
[57:28] trying to make it but let fire drop down
[57:31] in there that lust of the eyes the lust
[57:34] of the flesh you trying to be somebody
[57:36] all of that disappears because the fire
[57:39] Our God the Bible say is a consuming
[57:41] fire he will destroy everything just let
[57:44] go this morning and let the fire of God
[57:47] take a whole of your
[57:49] [Applause]
[57:51] life hallelujah hallelujah a kingdom
[57:55] that cannot
[57:58] be
[57:59] moved a kingdom that
[58:02] cannot be moved cannot be shakened amen
[58:06] so many times in our lives we try to
[58:09] rely on these props I call it the props
[58:14] in our lives amen we rely on the prop of
[58:17] our job you know once you have your job
[58:19] you know you can make it we lie on the
[58:21] prop of our savings we may lay on the
[58:25] prop of our family and God has a way of
[58:27] removing these props so that we could
[58:30] lie on him amen and rely on him because
[58:35] he's the only one that cannot be shaken
[58:37] he's the only one that cannot be moved
[58:39] man cannot produce that only God could
[58:42] produce that can the church say
[58:45] Amen so The Headstone is coming the
[58:49] stone of Power is coming to break up
[58:51] every man-made system to break up every
[58:54] conception that you have but over it he
[58:57] was preaching on inspiration and he was
[58:59] preaching from this Cote last week he
[59:01] said I believe that the bride of Christ
[59:02] is called amen I believe she is sealed
[59:05] in the kingdom of God I believe the
[59:06] mechanics is there they're waiting for
[59:08] the Dynamics that will take her off the
[59:10] earth into glory in the Rapture I
[59:12] believe it with all my heart yes sir he
[59:14] won't know how he's going to do it but
[59:16] he shall we don't know how he's going to
[59:18] do it but he shall do it he is the
[59:20] Dynamics we just become members of the
[59:22] machine of his body forming ourselves
[59:26] into his image and see him uniting
[59:28] himself with us in his works with his
[59:30] love gifts as he hands them to us just
[59:32] before the wedding supper we are waiting
[59:35] we are watching for that can the church
[59:37] say amen and the Dynamics of this church
[59:40] will be a refilling of the holy spirit
[59:43] that we have worked in a small measure
[59:45] while The Headstone is coming down to
[59:47] unite with the body but when the head
[59:50] and body unites together the full power
[59:53] somebody say full power the full power
[59:56] of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just
[59:59] exactly like that even the dead that's
[1:00:02] dead in Christ for hundred of years will
[1:00:04] rise in the beauty of his Holiness and
[1:00:07] take a flight to the skies but the B
[1:00:09] said the Dynamics is the holy spirit so
[1:00:12] this final showdown that we are talking
[1:00:15] about it's not going to be your strength
[1:00:17] it's not going to be your might but
[1:00:19] it'll be the Dynamics the Holy Ghost
[1:00:22] itself taking control of the mechanics
[1:00:25] the body is itself and when the two come
[1:00:28] together and begin to move in harmony
[1:00:30] Ahab the devil for all these years every
[1:00:33] age every generation he felt he made it
[1:00:37] he beat up Elijah he beat up Joshua
[1:00:40] throughout it the dead they fall to the
[1:00:42] ground but in this time the power that's
[1:00:45] coming will raise the dead out of the
[1:00:47] graves the power that's coming will
[1:00:49] cause a Rapture to take place the power
[1:00:51] that's coming will reach to your family
[1:00:54] that can't understand what's going on on
[1:00:56] but this power could not be stopped I
[1:00:59] see a stone cut out without the hands of
[1:01:01] man and that stone of Power is coming
[1:01:04] can the church say
[1:01:06] Amen you may be
[1:01:09] seated in the very first recorded
[1:01:11] message that brother brandham preached
[1:01:13] in on April 12th
[1:01:16] 1947 listen to brother bram's words in
[1:01:19] the message faith is the substance so he
[1:01:21] said I wish to speak to you tonight just
[1:01:24] for a little bit of time and teach the
[1:01:25] word of Fai that you might know how
[1:01:28] listen carefully how to approach God
[1:01:31] Amen there's many of these great and
[1:01:34] deep subjects that people claim that
[1:01:37] they know much about and when it comes
[1:01:40] down to the final showdown they know
[1:01:43] very little of it now that's true we are
[1:01:46] going to find out in a few of these
[1:01:48] things tonight amen so brother brandham
[1:01:50] saying there are many deep things that
[1:01:52] you could preach and you could
[1:01:53] investigate but when it really comes
[1:01:55] down to it it comes up to the final
[1:01:57] showdown and very few know about it so
[1:02:01] we are talking about showdowns this
[1:02:03] morning a showdown what is it it's a
[1:02:06] confrontation amen it's a fight amen
[1:02:09] it's a face off it's a standoff life is
[1:02:12] a showdown the Bible is a book of
[1:02:14] showdowns but I believe this morning the
[1:02:17] bride is getting ready for the
[1:02:20] final
[1:02:22] showdown Hallelujah we live in a modern
[1:02:25] age now but years ago in the days of the
[1:02:28] Wild West there used to be showdowns
[1:02:29] we'll meet you at 12:00
[1:02:31] noon and one man walk up the dusty road
[1:02:34] and come into a showdown and he stands
[1:02:36] up on this side and on the other side
[1:02:37] the other one walks and they would face
[1:02:40] office a showdown and the whole
[1:02:41] neighborhood is there the whole
[1:02:42] community and they would say draw and
[1:02:44] whoever draws and shoots first wins a
[1:02:46] showdown what a way to
[1:02:48] go but life is about
[1:02:53] showdowns sometime ago but over preach a
[1:02:55] message you say you do what you have to
[1:02:57] do until you find out what you are
[1:02:59] called to do many of us we don't like
[1:03:03] showdowns we don't like
[1:03:05] confrontation but over also said your
[1:03:07] passion for victory must be stronger
[1:03:10] greater than your fear of
[1:03:14] defeat I'll say those two again you do
[1:03:17] what you have to do until you find out
[1:03:19] what you are called to
[1:03:20] do and your passion for victory must be
[1:03:24] stronger greater greater than your fear
[1:03:27] of
[1:03:28] defeat and he also said Satan cannot get
[1:03:32] stronger but you can I love that one
[1:03:36] Satan cannot get stronger but you can so
[1:03:39] in this battle this showdown that we are
[1:03:42] talking about it's time that you lift
[1:03:44] your head up but brother Isaac I don't
[1:03:46] have the best prayer life that has
[1:03:47] nothing to do with it right now The
[1:03:49] Showdown is coming and you are being
[1:03:51] called out this morning you being called
[1:03:53] out to make an appearance you being
[1:03:55] called to represent the faith that was
[1:03:58] once delivered to the Saints you are
[1:03:59] being called out to be identified you
[1:04:01] could hide no longer in the shadows
[1:04:04] every individual in the bride is being
[1:04:07] called out to be
[1:04:09] identified oh those Dark Ages when the
[1:04:12] Christians were burnt at the Stak and
[1:04:14] fed to
[1:04:16] Lions it was easy to make your
[1:04:18] identification
[1:04:21] known those days were easier you know it
[1:04:23] might sound rough to go to the Lion's
[1:04:25] then then and stuff you know but it's
[1:04:27] either you were lion food or not lion
[1:04:30] food all right it's either you a real
[1:04:32] Christian or not a Christian there were
[1:04:33] many people I'm sure say you know what
[1:04:35] I'm good enough enough I'm good I I'll
[1:04:38] pray in secret you had no identification
[1:04:41] but in this age is easy for people to
[1:04:42] stay hiding like Adam did hiding in Eden
[1:04:47] hiding here hiding there hiding in the
[1:04:49] church hiding in the crowd but we're
[1:04:50] talking about a showdown where you could
[1:04:52] be identified by the token itself the
[1:04:55] brandom said the token must be displayed
[1:04:57] that the people around you could see it
[1:05:00] so if you're trying to hide in the
[1:05:01] church or hide in the message the clock
[1:05:04] is ticking down let this service put a
[1:05:06] Line in the Sand with you hiding who you
[1:05:09] are hiding where you come from hiding
[1:05:11] your testimony hiding who you are in God
[1:05:15] can the church say
[1:05:17] Amen the more I study the word the more
[1:05:19] I realize that God loves Showdown some
[1:05:22] of us we don't like conflict we don't
[1:05:24] like confrontation we don't like the
[1:05:26] face of anybody but God is different he
[1:05:28] Delights in the opportunities to prove
[1:05:32] himself can the church sayen when you
[1:05:35] read Genesis there was Darkness but
[1:05:37] there was a showdown and God said let
[1:05:39] there be light and light and darkness
[1:05:40] for and light one from all back there
[1:05:43] it's been a showdown can the church say
[1:05:46] Amen when Moses went down to Egypt and
[1:05:49] he began to speak he said I'm going to
[1:05:51] show you a sign and they dropped the rod
[1:05:53] and and the devil responded Janice and
[1:05:56] jambes throw their rods down what was
[1:05:57] that it was a showdown if Moses didn't
[1:06:00] hear from God he would have said listen
[1:06:02] I'm gone I'll come back the next time
[1:06:04] when I come back with something
[1:06:05] different but no it was a showdown it's
[1:06:08] a battle you think the devil's going to
[1:06:10] make it easy for you no he's going to
[1:06:13] fight for every inch of ground but God
[1:06:15] has never changed his strategy you are
[1:06:18] going to overcome you are going to make
[1:06:20] it you're going to have a
[1:06:23] testimony oh blessed pet the name of the
[1:06:27] Lord if youve ever seen a boxing match
[1:06:29] you may be seated there's a certain
[1:06:31] energy but the brand was an amateur
[1:06:33] boxer amen amen can the church say Amen
[1:06:37] but BR was an amateur boxer and there's
[1:06:39] a certain atmosphere when you're in a
[1:06:41] boxing match on one side it's one person
[1:06:44] about to fight and usually on the other
[1:06:46] side it's some kind of champion somebody
[1:06:48] who's being challenged in other words a
[1:06:50] showdown has a challenger and the person
[1:06:53] being challenged
[1:06:55] and in a box and match is the defending
[1:06:57] Champion or the person who thinks they
[1:06:59] are winning or whatever it is and then
[1:07:01] there's a person coming against it so
[1:07:04] right now this morning it's what you
[1:07:05] have been fighting all these years your
[1:07:07] cancer your tumor your disease your bind
[1:07:10] battles your fears and all these years
[1:07:13] it's day in your life but this morning
[1:07:15] you are getting an encouragement to come
[1:07:17] to The Showdown because but the brandom
[1:07:19] said you have to say boo back listen God
[1:07:22] is not coming to just take care of your
[1:07:24] battle when you are a soldier you know
[1:07:26] he's coming to give you strength to
[1:07:27] fight your battle but Abram said it like
[1:07:30] this he said you have to do something
[1:07:32] for something to
[1:07:33] happen that's why if you shall say to
[1:07:36] this mountain be moved you can't sit
[1:07:38] there and say I'm waiting on God to come
[1:07:40] and do something no you got to say
[1:07:42] something you got to speak to your
[1:07:43] Mountain you got to speak to your house
[1:07:45] you got to speak to your family and then
[1:07:48] watch God come to back it up oh you
[1:07:50] don't hear me this morning stop being
[1:07:53] lazy stop sitting back saying I'm
[1:07:55] waiting for God to deal with it what are
[1:07:57] you doing speak to the mountain why cry
[1:08:00] Moses speak and move forward you have
[1:08:02] been given a commission you have been
[1:08:04] called as a soldier in such a time as
[1:08:07] this can the church sayen Oh My My My I
[1:08:11] feel religious this morning on the left
[1:08:13] corner is the devil and he's jumping up
[1:08:15] and down he's been winning all kind of
[1:08:17] battles for all these years he thinks he
[1:08:19] could win this one there was showdowns
[1:08:22] and battles and but one time somebody
[1:08:25] came into the ring who was a little
[1:08:27] different he wasn't popular he didn't
[1:08:29] look handsome he didn't speak nice but
[1:08:32] when he came to the ring the devil
[1:08:33] thought this was just going to be like
[1:08:35] every other battle when the devil fought
[1:08:37] Moses he won he got Moses to not make it
[1:08:40] to the promised land he got Abraham to
[1:08:42] lie he got David to do this and to do
[1:08:45] that but when this one came into the
[1:08:47] ring and the devil thought he was like
[1:08:48] everybody else he said this is just like
[1:08:50] another Showdown but here comes a lonely
[1:08:53] little savior named Jesus and he comes
[1:08:56] walking into the ring and the devil try
[1:08:58] to test him he give a little jab if thou
[1:09:01] be and Jesus
[1:09:04] said come on now come on now it is
[1:09:07] written the devil say well that's a
[1:09:09] different
[1:09:10] one he Pro him again he said it is also
[1:09:13] written Pro him again and then Jesus
[1:09:16] walk out the
[1:09:18] ring the devil doesn't know what's going
[1:09:20] on the devil doesn't know what's
[1:09:22] happening this boxer is boxing different
[1:09:28] this box is a little different from
[1:09:30] everybody else he trying to pull he say
[1:09:31] pull his file hallelu let me understand
[1:09:35] this one we can't find nothing against
[1:09:38] him there was no sin in this one he see
[1:09:40] I got to find somebody to pin on this
[1:09:41] one the devil had to use all kind of
[1:09:44] attct he said call him be call him this
[1:09:46] but Jesus uttered not a word because he
[1:09:49] was preparing to give a knockout blow to
[1:09:51] the devil the devil had never fell
[1:09:53] before but the p said when Jesus was in
[1:09:56] the wilderness with the devil Satan was
[1:09:58] electrocuted with some FS that he never
[1:10:02] forgot but Jesus wasn't finished with
[1:10:04] him yet can the church say Amen Jesus
[1:10:08] battled and battled and battle and then
[1:10:10] on the cross when Jesus said it is
[1:10:12] finished the devil got one of those
[1:10:15] moves that he didn't understand him it
[1:10:17] looked as if Jesus was knocked out
[1:10:20] cold and the referee start to count one
[1:10:23] 2 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and the devil lift
[1:10:32] his hands
[1:10:34] up it looked as if Jesus was finished
[1:10:37] the devil say let's call the biggest
[1:10:39] party we ever had because this one was
[1:10:42] the biggest fight I ever had it was
[1:10:44] round after round usually I could knock
[1:10:46] out somebody in one round in two rounds
[1:10:48] in three rounds but this man give me a
[1:10:50] fight to the end let's celebrate but
[1:10:52] while the devil is celebrating Here
[1:10:54] Comes boxer who did something no boxer
[1:10:57] had ever done before here comes a boxer
[1:11:00] who knocks on the door and he said I
[1:11:02] need to get inside of there they say
[1:11:04] you're not invited no I don't need to be
[1:11:05] invited and Jesus walked in there and
[1:11:08] took the keys of death and took the keys
[1:11:10] of
[1:11:12] hell and he gave those keys to his bride
[1:11:15] he said Don't Fear debt don't fear hell
[1:11:18] Don't Fear the grave you are just like
[1:11:20] me because I live you are going to live
[1:11:23] also I'm the resurrection and the life
[1:11:26] but listen this battle that I started
[1:11:29] this battle that I give the devil I'm
[1:11:31] going to leave it to somebody special to
[1:11:33] finish this so down is going to be like
[1:11:36] no other battle Abraham couldn't do this
[1:11:39] Elijah couldn't do this Moses couldn't
[1:11:41] do this Peter couldn't do this Matthew
[1:11:45] couldn't do this I'm going to leave a
[1:11:47] lady to do
[1:11:48] it come on now a little lady in 2016
[1:11:53] she's going to be training for the final
[1:11:56] knockout
[1:11:58] punch can the church say amen for the
[1:12:02] final showdown for the final battle
[1:12:05] Satan has never been knocked out
[1:12:07] completely before but this time he's
[1:12:09] going to get something he never expected
[1:12:11] from a group of people he never expected
[1:12:14] but the brandom said when Peter walked
[1:12:16] out of the upper room the devil didn't
[1:12:17] move but when he went by the gate called
[1:12:20] beautiful and said silver and gold I
[1:12:22] don't have but such as I have I give to
[1:12:24] you the devil HD the alarm switch and
[1:12:27] say I talk we kill Jesus who is doing
[1:12:29] all of that and there's Peter there's
[1:12:31] James there's John there's Paul come on
[1:12:34] now irenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley
[1:12:36] All Through the Ages the devil just

[1:14:57] is you know when the devil raises up in
[1:14:59] front of you and your natural response
[1:15:01] is to go and hide and say let me call
[1:15:04] the pastor let me call the assistant
[1:15:06] pastor let me call the Elders to pray
[1:15:08] but your instinct as a soldier is you
[1:15:10] supposed to be always
[1:15:12] ready inseason out of season friend or
[1:15:15] no friend on the job in the home in the
[1:15:18] school on the road though 10,000 fall on
[1:15:21] my right side
[1:15:23] of the de Ang could be walking down the
[1:15:26] road but you know you have the token on
[1:15:28] the inside you just display your token
[1:15:30] say listen this is who I am the dead
[1:15:32] Angel has to pass you by don't you know
[1:15:35] you are
[1:15:36] predestinated for a special
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:44] Mission oh Hallelujah so there's been
[1:15:46] churches churches bries bries and they
[1:15:48] have been Showdown showdowns battles
[1:15:50] battles Showdown but there must come a
[1:15:52] final
[1:15:53] showdown there's got to come a point
[1:15:55] where you break past the sound barrier
[1:15:57] as it were and when you break past the
[1:15:59] sound barrier there's nothing to hold
[1:16:01] you back anymore brother Knights there's
[1:16:03] nothing to keep you bound anymore
[1:16:05] there's nothing to keep your prayer life
[1:16:07] down anymore there's no devil in hell
[1:16:09] could hold you back once you pass the
[1:16:11] sound barrier but the BR said there's a
[1:16:13] lot of vibrations there's a lot of
[1:16:15] shakings there's it feels like the wings
[1:16:17] want to fall off it feels like the
[1:16:19] inures want to come off but when you
[1:16:21] break past that barrier that sin barrier
[1:16:24] that out barrier brother it's unlimited
[1:16:27] the potential that's in the church it's
[1:16:30] unlimited what's locked up inside of
[1:16:38] you brother random said in the message
[1:16:40] Ministry explained he said what's the
[1:16:42] matter is we Christians get too weak
[1:16:45] when it comes to The Showdown my God my
[1:16:48] God that's the prophet speaking we get
[1:16:51] too weak when it comes to The Showdown
[1:16:53] if it's real it's real
[1:16:55] if it's not it's not he said and if I
[1:16:58] didn't believe him with all my heart and
[1:17:00] know it was real I would not be here
[1:17:02] tonight but I believe it and not only
[1:17:05] that I know it's real and that's why
[1:17:07] I've always said in my heart I want a
[1:17:10] reality I am I'm not just here to have
[1:17:12] church I'm not here just no it's got to
[1:17:15] be more than that there are many
[1:17:17] churches there are many groups but I
[1:17:19] want the reality of the Living God
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:25] Hallelujah that's what I'm looking for
[1:17:28] for God to step into homes and heal
[1:17:30] marriages uh because he is God uh he is
[1:17:33] Jehovah Gyra he is Jehovah shama he is
[1:17:36] Jehovah Rafa that's God he promised to
[1:17:39] take care of you he promised to heal you
[1:17:42] he promised to give you the victory you
[1:17:44] better believe it and stand up and claim
[1:17:46] it it's
[1:17:48] [Applause]
[1:17:53] yours
[1:17:56] Hallelujah there's a difference between
[1:17:59] showdowns and a final
[1:18:03] showdown you know brother random said if
[1:18:05] you don't testify you going to
[1:18:09] backslide you know he said that right
[1:18:11] yes so some of you who never tell
[1:18:14] anybody about
[1:18:17] Jesus
[1:18:19] hallu God is fair you know he's just you
[1:18:22] know and he is tied to his own
[1:18:27] word and he makes no
[1:18:29] excuses so there's no
[1:18:32] Bly there's no free
[1:18:35] pass with God you have to be able to
[1:18:39] testify of God and the reason I'm saying
[1:18:42] I remember when I was in secondary
[1:18:43] school I got in a showdown with somebody
[1:18:46] in my class about the
[1:18:48] Bible and he chopped me to
[1:18:52] shreds we going back and forth on
[1:18:54] scripture this mean this and that mean
[1:18:56] this and this and this and and after
[1:18:58] that Showdown I felt so
[1:19:01] defeated because I went with a motive to
[1:19:04] convince him that this thing was truth
[1:19:08] but he was more trained than I was in
[1:19:11] scripture so he was like what this mean
[1:19:13] and what this mean and and for many
[1:19:15] people in the message we know the
[1:19:16] message but we don't know the
[1:19:18] Bible so when they pull scriptures it's
[1:19:21] like but brother brandham said this like
[1:19:24] who is Brother
[1:19:28] brand so you got to know the scripture
[1:19:30] that's why even the prophet said back to
[1:19:33] the
[1:19:36] Bible because the Bible is God's word
[1:19:39] The Prophet's mission was to bring a
[1:19:41] light and shine under the direction of
[1:19:42] the Holy Spirit into where it's written
[1:19:45] and to tie up the Loose Ends and to
[1:19:46] connect the pieces so that we can
[1:19:48] rightly understand the Bible because the
[1:19:50] Bible in isolation is a closed book it's
[1:19:53] a seal it's seal to the pentec it's
[1:19:55] sealed to the Catholics it's sealed to
[1:19:56] them they read scriptures and they only
[1:19:59] seeing shadows but when you look into
[1:20:01] the revealed word you're seeing clearly
[1:20:03] and plainly what you are born to do what
[1:20:05] you are called to
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:09] do but only a showdown could show what's
[1:20:13] inside of
[1:20:15] you let me say that again it's only when
[1:20:17] The Showdown come it proves what's
[1:20:20] inside of
[1:20:21] you that's why there's a test
[1:20:25] the only way to prove that you didn't
[1:20:27] waste your five years in secondary
[1:20:29] school is to have a
[1:20:31] test your test is a showdown it's you
[1:20:34] and the paper and the pencil and the
[1:20:36] examiner there and it's like a
[1:20:39] Warfare and you walk in there you either
[1:20:42] know what you're doing or you're praying
[1:20:43] to God to remember the stuff you heard
[1:20:45] in form one that you never looked at
[1:20:49] again and it's a showdown amen and some
[1:20:52] people in 10 minutes it's over because
[1:20:54] they only know 10 minutes worth of stuff
[1:20:57] and for others they're down to the wire
[1:20:59] time up and they want to be finish in
[1:21:01] because they have a lot to say because
[1:21:03] they want to make sure they overcome in
[1:21:05] this showdown
[1:21:07] amen life is about conflict Hallelujah
[1:21:10] everything has conflict a chicken coming
[1:21:12] out of a egg is
[1:21:14] conflict it's a showdown who is going to
[1:21:17] win is it going to stay in its condition
[1:21:19] and stay in the comfort zone of the egg
[1:21:22] or is it going to break out away from
[1:21:24] that Mama chicken and break out of the
[1:21:27] egg and it wins that Showdown and it
[1:21:29] steps out then it wants to go and
[1:21:32] explore on its own it's a showdown
[1:21:33] that's life it's a showdown it's a
[1:21:36] battle it's a
[1:21:37] struggle you struggle every day to
[1:21:40] overcome it's built in all of us to
[1:21:42] struggle amen just like it's built in
[1:21:44] all of us to be
[1:21:46] creators because there's the genes of
[1:21:48] our fathers and it's a struggle because
[1:21:50] God wants you to be a Creator and the
[1:21:53] devil wants you to be a copy amen
[1:21:55] hallelujah a photocopy of somebody else
[1:21:58] Hallelujah but when you get the
[1:21:59] individual Revelation you are born for a
[1:22:02] time as this to be just like your father
[1:22:05] to have dominion that Dominion that Adam
[1:22:08] was given that he
[1:22:10] forfeited and you recognize that when
[1:22:12] you worship and you pray and you praise
[1:22:14] God and you press and you battle and you
[1:22:16] contend there's something taking place
[1:22:18] in the inside that's connecting to who
[1:22:21] you
[1:22:23] are I love what but the redhead said
[1:22:26] about two weeks ago he say you can't go
[1:22:27] back if you were not
[1:22:29] there but only because you were there
[1:22:31] you could go back to
[1:22:34] that where was thou when I laid a
[1:22:36] foundation be that's not for everybody
[1:22:38] but if you were there you could go back
[1:22:40] to
[1:22:41] that can the church say amen and
[1:22:43] something has to reveal to you that you
[1:22:45] were there and if you were there and you
[1:22:48] are a warrior there why are you a
[1:22:50] warrior
[1:22:52] here I just used two words
[1:22:55] Hallelujah if you were there you were a
[1:22:56] warrior you were a fighter over there
[1:22:58] now you're coming and you're worrying
[1:22:59] worrying if I going to make a wonder how
[1:23:01] I going to pay the bills I wonder I'm
[1:23:02] worrying about my child I worrying if I
[1:23:04] going to make it a worrying if I going
[1:23:05] to if I going to get the Holy Ghost I
[1:23:07] don't know
[1:23:09] and but back there you are a warrior
[1:23:12] hallu just like the eagle the eagle
[1:23:14] don't ask permission for meat to seize
[1:23:16] meat and soups down and when and find
[1:23:18] the meat it grabs it because it's an
[1:23:19] eagle it don't ask permission from
[1:23:21] another Eagle it knows that it has a
[1:23:23] right to
[1:23:26] it's not a chicken it's not a hawk it's
[1:23:28] an
[1:23:29] eagle you don't need permission to go to
[1:23:31] the world and see your name in there you
[1:23:34] need permission to go to God that veil
[1:23:36] was Ren from top to bottom that the
[1:23:38] priest had put up to but when Jesus died
[1:23:42] it was direct access you don't need to
[1:23:44] go through anybody you can go straight
[1:23:46] to God and say Lord my child is in
[1:23:49] trouble and need an intervention I can't
[1:23:52] reach them they in another country but
[1:23:54] you are able just like that Centurion
[1:23:57] I'm not even worthy for you to come
[1:23:58] under my roof but just speak the word
[1:24:02] that's who we
[1:24:05] are listen to the prophet he said the
[1:24:08] devil will make you prove every one of
[1:24:10] those virtues think about that the devil
[1:24:13] will make you prove every one of those
[1:24:15] virtues isn't that a showdown so if the
[1:24:18] virtue being tested as patience then you
[1:24:20] have a showdown coming a patient
[1:24:22] Showdown
[1:24:25] Hallelujah and if you've been tested and
[1:24:27] Temperance by the nights you have a
[1:24:28] Temperance Showdown
[1:24:30] coming and a situation will come to see
[1:24:33] if you could be
[1:24:35] temperate to see if you could be patient
[1:24:38] so not every Showdown requires the same
[1:24:41] response that's right not every response
[1:24:44] but a Shan is dry s and chop you know
[1:24:46] that's right when Joseph had his
[1:24:48] Showdown it was a potty for wife
[1:24:50] [Music]
[1:24:52] Showdown and Joseph take them shoes I
[1:24:56] don't know if it was Nike I don't know
[1:24:58] if it was Adidas I don't know who it was
[1:25:00] and he ran for his life so there are
[1:25:03] some showdowns to win you have to
[1:25:05] run there are some showdowns stand still
[1:25:08] and see the salvation of God that's a
[1:25:11] different kind of Showdown Joseph
[1:25:13] couldn't see stand still and see
[1:25:17] this different kind of Showdown am but
[1:25:21] the Bible says we are not ignorant of
[1:25:23] Satan's deves so the Devil comes with
[1:25:26] all kinds of and I said to the young
[1:25:28] people many years ago you in church
[1:25:30] you're struggling you're holding on you
[1:25:32] want to be a Christian you want to live
[1:25:34] right you want to have a testimony in
[1:25:36] your school on your job because you know
[1:25:38] better amen anybody who comes and walks
[1:25:40] through this you know better when you do
[1:25:42] nonsense it's a
[1:25:44] choice that's right Hallelujah and the
[1:25:47] sad part is many of us we do the blame
[1:25:50] thing and the blame thing comes way back
[1:25:51] from
[1:25:52] Adam it wasn't me it was
[1:25:55] woman it wasn't me it was the
[1:25:58] serpent in fact Adam even throw God in
[1:26:01] him under the bus he said the woman you
[1:26:02] gave
[1:26:05] me so he blame the woman and God for
[1:26:07] giving it because if I was by myself
[1:26:08] alone doing telling I would have not be
[1:26:10] in this position right
[1:26:12] now but God has got a
[1:26:15] responsibility of accepting
[1:26:17] responsibility for your choices that's
[1:26:20] why we are free moral agents so we have
[1:26:22] a choice on if we want to worship so
[1:26:24] that's when Elijah reached a point of
[1:26:26] The Showdown he said why halt ye between
[1:26:29] two opinions amen come on why are you
[1:26:33] stuck trying to decide if to serve the
[1:26:35] god of Ahab or if to worship the Living
[1:26:38] God why are you Hal between two opinions
[1:26:42] to be a real Christian or to just be a
[1:26:44] church member amen come on why are you
[1:26:47] stuck between two decisions to go all
[1:26:50] the way or just come part of the way
[1:26:52] come on why are you stuck between two
[1:26:56] decisions to dress one way for church
[1:26:58] you know I'm
[1:27:00] coming and dress another
[1:27:03] way when you want to go to your show or
[1:27:05] you want to go to your thing or you want
[1:27:06] to go by your friends or whatever speak
[1:27:09] one way in the house of God and that's
[1:27:11] why I say it's easy to be a Christian in
[1:27:13] church because by Nature we could adapt
[1:27:16] our environment but when you are out
[1:27:18] there when nobody's looking or when you
[1:27:20] think nobody is looking that's the real
[1:27:22] you that's who the angel of the Lord is
[1:27:25] following not following you when you
[1:27:27] here in the church and you looking all
[1:27:30] churchy but when you wake up in the
[1:27:32] morning and you in the Maxi and the
[1:27:33] music suing
[1:27:36] good hallu I remember one time I was in
[1:27:39] form two or so and um my dad was against
[1:27:43] us going to school bazaars and stuff
[1:27:46] and so maybe I went to maybe one or so
[1:27:49] for a short moment and he sent us with a
[1:27:52] somebody from church a older young
[1:27:55] person I was like form one from to can
[1:27:56] remember and to my shock this older
[1:28:00] person was dancing to the music like
[1:28:02] just bobbing his head now he said this
[1:28:03] music catchy boy and I was just
[1:28:06] appalled because this was supposed to be
[1:28:08] person making sure that I don't do
[1:28:15] that but it's about choices show now is
[1:28:18] about a
[1:28:20] choice what you say is a choice
[1:28:24] you could say the right thing you could
[1:28:27] and and I know we hear it you know but
[1:28:28] you see what happens to Showdown is when
[1:28:30] the heat get turns up and the pressure
[1:28:33] comes a lot of the stuff you train and
[1:28:35] you hear suddenly Fades away you
[1:28:40] know that's when the pre that that
[1:28:43] that's The Showdown The Showdown is now
[1:28:44] when it's nice and we could go through
[1:28:46] the service now and everything is all
[1:28:47] right but The Showdown is when you by
[1:28:49] yourself and there's nobody to check you
[1:28:52] and as I said to them in maraval 2 weeks
[1:28:53] ago that still Small Voice that says
[1:28:56] don't do it but the Brandon said when
[1:28:58] you don't listen over and over you
[1:29:01] become so you lose the
[1:29:04] sensitivity and then you get cut off so
[1:29:07] when you make a choice to disrespect
[1:29:09] your parents or you make a choice to not
[1:29:11] come to church after a while it becomes
[1:29:14] easier and easier and easier that's why
[1:29:17] the Bible says we are in a rebellious
[1:29:19] time amen amen amen and Rebellion is a
[1:29:22] spirit yes
[1:29:25] Hallelujah so we don't want to sit back
[1:29:27] and act as if everything is all right
[1:29:29] because we are in a showdown right now
[1:29:31] but the Brandon was preaching the
[1:29:32] greatest battle ever fought and a battle
[1:29:35] was going on right there in the
[1:29:36] Tabernacle right there in the church so
[1:29:38] there's a shown going on right now a
[1:29:41] showdown for your soul a showdown for
[1:29:44] your testimony a showdown to see if
[1:29:46] you're going to put God first hallelujah
[1:29:49] hallelujah or if you're going to be just
[1:29:51] like anybody else Hallelujah you could
[1:29:52] be 10 years old and put God first you
[1:29:54] could be 6 years old and put God first
[1:29:57] you could be 100 years old and put God
[1:29:59] first it has nothing to do with your age
[1:30:02] who your father is who your mother is it
[1:30:04] has to do with if God has spoken to your
[1:30:06] life to your
[1:30:08] [Applause]
[1:30:12] heart you may be seated I know when I
[1:30:15] started people thought I was I going to
[1:30:17] get focus in the final showdown to come
[1:30:19] you know but I want to stick here for a
[1:30:20] little while in this showdown here right
[1:30:22] now amen the show down with your
[1:30:25] expectation and what you expect and how
[1:30:26] you expect God to move and God saying
[1:30:28] not yet I don't want to give you that
[1:30:31] because you have some more maturing up
[1:30:33] to do you have some much growing up to
[1:30:35] do but the brandom said one time to the
[1:30:37] ministers we have some more growing up
[1:30:39] to do because God wants some mature Sons
[1:30:42] some mature daughters who could weather
[1:30:45] the storm who could weather the trials
[1:30:48] who see trials for what they are that
[1:30:50] God will not give you more than you
[1:30:52] could bear and what trial sent is more
[1:30:55] precious than gold and God wants to get
[1:30:57] your character so beautiful and so sweet
[1:30:59] that whenever he squeeze your life is
[1:31:01] only perfume comes out because it's just
[1:31:04] like the rose of Sharon when they crush
[1:31:06] the petals on Calvary only the sweet
[1:31:08] fragrance of the Rose of Sharon could
[1:31:11] come out
[1:31:12] [Applause]
[1:31:15] because so God give us some sons and
[1:31:18] daughters that in 2017 would say God
[1:31:21] give us some more trials give us some
[1:31:23] more pressure give us some more
[1:31:25] showdowns because only The Showdown
[1:31:28] could get us to overcome how many want
[1:31:30] to be
[1:31:31] Overcomers how many want to face The
[1:31:34] Showdown to overcome The
[1:31:36] [Applause]
[1:31:38] [Music]
[1:31:45] Showdown only the
[1:31:47] Overcomers the Overcomers are the ones
[1:31:49] who overcome The Showdown The Showdown
[1:31:52] of the lust of the eyes
[1:31:54] The Showdown of the lust of the flesh
[1:31:56] the showdowns of the pride of life the
[1:31:58] showdowns of how you will conduct
[1:31:59] yourself during this Christmas season
[1:32:02] amen
[1:32:04] amen about two Tuesdays ago I believe it
[1:32:07] was there was the earthquake in
[1:32:09] Trinidad whole island shook I was there
[1:32:11] at my house and I was actually leaning
[1:32:13] just over the couch at the time and I
[1:32:15] felt the house began to
[1:32:17] shake and I said when I spoke that that
[1:32:20] Tuesday evening in service I said for
[1:32:21] that brief moment you recognize how
[1:32:24] small you are in the architecture of
[1:32:29] God I looked out to the church there
[1:32:33] that Tuesday night and it's one one of
[1:32:35] the largest attendances we had on a
[1:32:38] Tuesday
[1:32:40] night in a long
[1:32:42] time and brother Anthony I said to them
[1:32:45] I believe in my heart that everybody had
[1:32:48] planned to come to service early that
[1:32:51] morning and it was not the Earth earth
[1:32:54] quake that drove everybody to the house
[1:32:56] of God that
[1:33:01] evening but everything that can be
[1:33:05] shaken will be shaken hallelujah
[1:33:09] hallelujah hallelujah people don't
[1:33:11] understand yet and bovid was so powerful
[1:33:13] in his ministry last week when he
[1:33:14] speaking about
[1:33:16] judgment and the Bible said judgment
[1:33:18] will begin where in the house of God
[1:33:22] Amen so don't look at judgment out there
[1:33:25] judgment begins in the house of God the
[1:33:28] Bible says at the ancient
[1:33:31] men and the men who have sat in the
[1:33:33] message for a long time and they know
[1:33:35] better because to whom much is given
[1:33:38] much is
[1:33:40] required and the ancient men who have
[1:33:42] sat with the books and the tapes and the
[1:33:44] quotes and God is sending judgment amen
[1:33:48] because he will have no sin in his
[1:33:50] house he will have a church without spot
[1:33:53] without
[1:33:54] wrinkle so this is a showdown this
[1:33:57] morning to have a holy church am to have
[1:34:00] a church built on prayer to have a
[1:34:02] church built on respect to have a church
[1:34:04] built on forgiveness because God is a
[1:34:06] god of judgment and he's a god of
[1:34:10] Mercy Hallelujah and the two come hand
[1:34:12] in hand amen the B said one day the last
[1:34:15] song Will Be Sung one day the Bible will
[1:34:17] be closed for the last time and where
[1:34:18] will where will you be that's why the
[1:34:21] Bible say Seek Ye the Lord while he may
[1:34:23] be found call him while he is near this
[1:34:26] may be not the best type of service you
[1:34:28] want to hear to end the year you want to
[1:34:30] jump you want to shout but friends if we
[1:34:33] don't apply the token we miss the whole
[1:34:35] purpose of this
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:44] message the Raptor is going to be a
[1:34:46] small bunch of people
[1:34:48] friends it's not the whole message going
[1:34:50] to make it it's not the whole of
[1:34:50] Christianity who talk about the Rapture
[1:34:52] not because you talk about it means
[1:34:54] you're going to make it amen can the
[1:34:57] church say
[1:34:59] Amen
[1:35:01] Hallelujah
[1:35:03] showdowns from the message God's way has
[1:35:06] been made for us brother bam said so
[1:35:08] when it come time and The Showdown and
[1:35:10] Israel stood there by the Sea God's path
[1:35:12] LED across the sea so God looked down
[1:35:14] through the pillar of fire the sea got
[1:35:17] scared and move back you hear that
[1:35:19] description the sea got scared and moved
[1:35:22] back and Israel went across and dry land
[1:35:25] God's path LED through it so what do you
[1:35:28] think will happen when you come to your
[1:35:29] shoulder and God wants to step in the
[1:35:31] sea your situation will get scared and
[1:35:33] move back we spoke about Moses and his
[1:35:35] Showdown we spoke about Daniel he had
[1:35:37] his Showdown his Showdown was a show
[1:35:39] down about his prayer
[1:35:41] life that's what it was a show down
[1:35:43] about his prayer
[1:35:45] life and what did Daniel do Cur up no he
[1:35:49] prayed he had a choice he could have go
[1:35:51] and prayed under his belt so nobody
[1:35:52] would see it but you know what dam
[1:35:55] Daniel would pray that anybody could see
[1:35:58] him praying you know he had a choice yes
[1:36:01] he had a choice but the kind to go and
[1:36:03] hide you know think about
[1:36:06] it he had a choice to go when nobody
[1:36:08] would see him and pray but Daniel Was
[1:36:12] Not Afraid Hallelujah because he knew
[1:36:14] where his strength came from he knew
[1:36:17] where his power came from so he prayed
[1:36:19] just the same shame on you Christians
[1:36:22] who don't even want to pray for your
[1:36:23] food at lunch in your lunch room and
[1:36:25] your
[1:36:26] job you're an embarrassment to the
[1:36:29] kingdom of
[1:36:30] God and if you are not strong enough to
[1:36:34] pray for your food on your lunch table
[1:36:37] yes I know some of you that that's just
[1:36:39] don't
[1:36:42] don't and if you are ashamed of him what
[1:36:45] how do you want him to defend you and
[1:36:47] the Bible says my people shall never be
[1:36:50] ashamed can the Church Say Amen
[1:36:56] real Christians or no Christians at all
[1:36:59] butam said God Don't Make halfway
[1:37:01] preachers he don't make Halfway
[1:37:03] Christian but a preacher could be
[1:37:04] halfway a Christian could be halfway but
[1:37:06] we want to go all the way we want God to
[1:37:09] do something for us but God expects
[1:37:10] something from us also a committed life
[1:37:13] a surrendered life can the church say
[1:37:16] Amen the three Hebrew boys had their
[1:37:20] Showdown and they didn't back down they
[1:37:23] had a choice going to the fiery furnace
[1:37:25] and say to beg beg for mercy but they
[1:37:28] kept walking they kept walking they kept
[1:37:30] walking and when they got into the fiery
[1:37:32] furnace there was a forth man in the
[1:37:34] fire to meet them in their Showdown can
[1:37:37] the church say
[1:37:40] amen and we spoke about Elijah Elijah
[1:37:43] said call all your prophets hallu
[1:37:45] because the Reason God held the rain and
[1:37:47] held all the due and rain is because the
[1:37:49] children of God had turned their backs
[1:37:51] on God hallelujah hallelujah they were
[1:37:53] worshiping false
[1:37:55] Idols God he said call for us Showdown
[1:37:58] call all your prophets call all your
[1:38:01] priests call all your Believers let's
[1:38:03] have a convention set up your altar I'll
[1:38:06] set up my altar Elijah was not afraid
[1:38:09] he's standing there by himself he has
[1:38:11] nobody to support him he has nobody to
[1:38:13] encourage him but he has a revelation he
[1:38:16] said let it not be about numbers but let
[1:38:18] the god that answer by fire let that God
[1:38:21] be God
[1:38:23] and that's what I'm saying this morning
[1:38:25] Let The God Who heals the sick let that
[1:38:28] God be God let The God Who raises the
[1:38:30] dead let that God be God this morning
[1:38:34] you better have that God as your God
[1:38:36] this
[1:38:37] [Applause]
[1:38:38] morning and those priests who were
[1:38:41] worshiping ba and baam and all of that
[1:38:44] they put their animals there and they
[1:38:46] start to dance and they start to worship
[1:38:49] and Elijah was so confident he began to
[1:38:51] tease them he said maybe your God is on
[1:38:53] a vacation maybe your God went fishing
[1:38:56] maybe your God went for a walk maybe
[1:38:58] your God went strolling and those men
[1:39:01] understand this but the brand said they
[1:39:02] were so
[1:39:04] sincere they believed that they had to
[1:39:06] cut themselves because they believe that
[1:39:09] they were right but when Elijah's turn
[1:39:11] come now the whole nation is watching
[1:39:15] It's the final showdown that day he said
[1:39:18] put it there he said pour
[1:39:21] water put some water in it
[1:39:24] because I want to make sure that you see
[1:39:25] it's really fire from God there's no
[1:39:27] flame burning anywhere there I didn't
[1:39:30] start this but let the god that answer
[1:39:32] by fire it's not a man-made fire it's
[1:39:35] not a church made fire it's not a group
[1:39:37] fire but it's God answering by fire
[1:39:40] because he sees your life uh he sees
[1:39:43] your sacrifice he sees your testimony he
[1:39:46] sees you staying with his word he see
[1:39:49] you applying the
[1:39:52] token and all of a sudden the fire from
[1:39:54] heaven dropped down and the people began
[1:39:56] to repent God give us people like that
[1:39:59] who will stand in such a time as this in
[1:40:01] this showdown can the church say Amen oh
[1:40:05] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:40:08] Hallelujah the woman with the issue of
[1:40:10] blood she came to her Showdown the Bible
[1:40:13] says she has spent all that she had and
[1:40:15] I would expect if she had more money she
[1:40:17] would have spent it to but she had went
[1:40:18] from Doctor to doctor with her condition
[1:40:21] but she had come to her Crossroads as it
[1:40:23] was she had come to her Showdown she had
[1:40:26] no many or no more options and God many
[1:40:29] time has to bring us to the spot where
[1:40:31] we have no more options we have no more
[1:40:34] Alternatives we have no more family to
[1:40:36] ask I could have imagined you would have
[1:40:38] asked a family for money ask some
[1:40:39] friends for money to keep paying the
[1:40:41] doctor's bills she had an issue of blood
[1:40:43] for years and she kept trying to solve
[1:40:46] it but she heard that Jesus was in town
[1:40:49] and she heard the testimonies of what
[1:40:51] Jesus would do but she came to her
[1:40:53] Crossroads and she told herself if I
[1:40:56] could just Touch the Hem of His Garment
[1:40:59] I'm going to be made whole she came to
[1:41:01] her Showdown and God didn't make it easy
[1:41:04] for her he didn't clear a path for her
[1:41:06] but the currents she had to press her
[1:41:08] away past those who were just in the
[1:41:10] church she had to press away past those
[1:41:13] who were just warming a bench she had to
[1:41:15] press away past those who just wanted to
[1:41:18] be in church Hallelujah and she pressed
[1:41:21] away and she touched the him of his gar
[1:41:23] and she made a withdrawal because she
[1:41:26] had Faith to reach out and Jesus looked
[1:41:28] around he said who touched me the
[1:41:30] disciples didn't understand what was
[1:41:32] going on they said but Jesus everybody
[1:41:35] touching you he said this is different
[1:41:37] this woman made her with Joel I felt
[1:41:40] virtue left me I felt power left me I
[1:41:44] felt Grace left me is there somebody

[1:48:09] Shamar had reached a point where he was
[1:48:11] tired of giving up his prayer life
[1:48:15] giving up his labor every season after
[1:48:18] he would plant and he would reap and he
[1:48:20] would put away the Harvest the philis
[1:48:22] times would come and they would take it
[1:48:24] away from him but the brandom said you
[1:48:26] may be seated but the Bram said that sh
[1:48:29] God hallelujah had reached a point where
[1:48:32] he couldn't take it anymore he said sha
[1:48:35] looked out but the BAM said he was maybe
[1:48:37] about 600 Philistines coming he said
[1:48:40] shamba stood there the prophet said he
[1:48:42] looked at his wife he looked at his
[1:48:45] daughter he said not another season am I
[1:48:48] going to give up my labor to the
[1:48:51] Philistines brother brand said shamba
[1:48:53] was dressed like a farmer he said he was
[1:48:55] not a soldier but in his heart but the
[1:48:58] brandom said he was concerned and then
[1:49:00] he got convinced he was convinced that
[1:49:03] God was with him but the B said he was
[1:49:06] not a soldier he didn't have a sword he
[1:49:09] didn't have a spear he didn't have a
[1:49:11] shield he had a ox gold you know what a

[1:49:21] reached his limit
[1:49:23] he couldn't take it no more sha was
[1:49:26] tired of praying and seeing the devil
[1:49:28] take his Joy he was tired of coming to
[1:49:32] church and going back home and not

[1:49:40] seeing his daughter hungry he was tired

[1:57:34] commission Hallelujah God is holding you
[1:57:37] in your position for your loved ones
[1:57:39] don't just think about yourself but God
[1:57:41] is holding you to testify to your
[1:57:43] daughter to testify to your son to
[1:57:46] testify to your wife your husband your
[1:57:47] children praise God praise God praise
[1:57:50] God he may did it for a few minutes I
[1:57:53] want to get this in
[1:57:58] there but the Bram said Shamar was
[1:58:01] convinced all right and Shamar was
[1:58:04] concerned all right it had just become
[1:58:07] too much for him that's it and many
[1:58:09] times we have to come to the spot like
[1:58:11] shamba he had become used to giving up
[1:58:14] his Harvest but the devil just pushed
[1:58:16] just ones too much amen and this time he
[1:58:20] made up his mind that he was was not
[1:58:23] giving up
[1:58:24] again he looked not just at himself but
[1:58:27] he looked at his wife brother he looked
[1:58:29] at his child look at his family I want
[1:58:32] to challenge you look not just at
[1:58:34] yourself but look at your family look at
[1:58:37] your wife your husband your child your
[1:58:38] brother your sister look at the person
[1:58:40] who's next to you right now because
[1:58:42] that's your family amen and catch your
[1:58:45] burden and say Lord is enough is enough
[1:58:48] Hallelujah I'm tired of seeing Sister
[1:58:50] Christine and pain doesn't that that
[1:58:52] that that should affect you on a deep
[1:58:54] level I'm tired of seeing my brothers
[1:58:57] and sisters struggling with their back
[1:58:59] their eyes they it comes a point where
[1:59:01] you say it's enough is
[1:59:03] enough enough is enough seeing our young
[1:59:05] people struggling listen our young
[1:59:07] people they love God they want to serve
[1:59:10] God and the enemy has done a number on
[1:59:12] their minds in the schools and on their
[1:59:14] friends and many of you parents you have
[1:59:15] done the best that you could the best
[1:59:17] that you know how you have loved them
[1:59:20] more than than you could even put into
[1:59:22] words but still they have a hard time
[1:59:24] and you know this is the truth and you
[1:59:25] pray for them and you cry out for them
[1:59:27] but I want to say enough is enough this
[1:59:30] is the season for their restoration the
[1:59:32] Philistines have done enough and we come
[1:59:35] to push them back we come to serve them
[1:59:37] notice that this is the final
[1:59:40] showdown
[1:59:42] hallelujah thank you brother the
[1:59:44] brandham said in the message convinced
[1:59:47] and then concerned he said if this group
[1:59:49] of people here tonight and I I said
[1:59:52] today could get that much convinced he
[1:59:55] said God gave the promises and when God
[1:59:57] gave the promise to Abraham he said he
[1:59:59] would have possess the Gate of his
[2:00:00] enemies and so Shamar believed that and
[2:00:04] look at the odds against him listen to
[2:00:07] the prophet and this is what I'm looking
[2:00:09] for today he said God only needs one
[2:00:16] man so I'm looking for one person I know
[2:00:19] I'm one this morning but is there
[2:00:21] anybody else this morning morning he
[2:00:22] said God only needs one man God just let
[2:00:26] just let him get one man in his hand the
[2:00:30] world will think he's crazy but he will
[2:00:32] drive home the gospel when he's
[2:00:35] thoroughly convinced listen to what he's
[2:00:37] convinced about that Jesus Christ
[2:00:40] Remains the same yesterday today and
[2:00:42] forever under anything else he will
[2:00:45] stand true and go on because he's
[2:00:47] thoroughly convinced that God is God and
[2:00:51] if he ever was God he's still God and if
[2:00:54] he isn't the God he was he never was God
[2:00:56] that's right he's the infinite God the
[2:00:59] all powerful listen the prophet Almighty
[2:01:03] omnipresent omniscient infinite he said
[2:01:06] Oh my he is God he's the same God that
[2:01:09] opened the Red Sea he's the same God
[2:01:11] that brought Daniel out of the Lion's
[2:01:13] Den the same God that brought the Hebrew
[2:01:16] children from the fiery furnace he's the
[2:01:19] same God that raised up Jesus Christ and
[2:01:21] Easter morning he's the same God that
[2:01:24] fell on the day of Pentecost he's the
[2:01:26] same God that raised Lazarus out of the
[2:01:29] Grave he's the same yesterday today and
[2:01:32] forever and I'm convinced that this is
[2:01:35] the Holy Ghost oh my that's the
[2:01:37] prophet's words but the B goes on he
[2:01:39] said Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[2:01:42] this is that and if this isn't that I'll
[2:01:45] keep this till that comes for I believe
[2:01:48] this is that I'm convinced that it's the
[2:01:51] gospel
[2:01:52] and the power and the demonstration of
[2:01:55] the resurrection of the appearing of the
[2:01:57] Lord Jesus Christ in this last day
[2:02:00] making the church ready to be caught
[2:02:02] away in a bride can the church say
[2:02:07] Amen oh my oh my oh my oh my is there
[2:02:14] anybody convinced this morning is there
[2:02:16] anybody convinced this morning is there
[2:02:19] anybody concerned this morning listen to
[2:02:22] the prophet Moses in the same message
[2:02:24] Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ
[2:02:27] listen greater riches than the treasures
[2:02:31] of
[2:02:31] Egypt
[2:02:33] amen I want to say this friends you hunt
[2:02:36] all kind of stuff in life the nice house
[2:02:39] the nice car the money the this the
[2:02:41] whatever it is but Moses esteemed the
[2:02:43] reproach of Christ greater riches than
[2:02:47] the treasures of Egypt therefore he
[2:02:49] forsake a throne he took his Choice with
[2:02:52] the poor ignorant illiterate slaves why
[2:02:55] he esteemed The Riches of Christ greater
[2:02:57] Treasures than to have his glory in the
[2:03:00] world at that time amen hallelujah can
[2:03:03] the church say Amen oh have all the
[2:03:06] glory they want but what God wants today
[2:03:09] is men and women who isn't interested in
[2:03:12] great big fineries and all these other
[2:03:14] things but somebody that will take the
[2:03:17] simple word of God and preach it with
[2:03:19] all that's in them and wait on God for
[2:03:22] the power of God to manifest himself
[2:03:25] Hallelujah we can't bring the
[2:03:27] manifestation on in our time but when
[2:03:29] the time has come it's just like Elijah
[2:03:31] tell them I'm here and one of these days
[2:03:34] there'll be an announcement go around
[2:03:36] the world tell them the bride is here
[2:03:38] tell them the bride is here once more
[2:03:41] they are Sons and Daughters of God just
[2:03:43] like Adam Dominion on the earth once
[2:03:47] more the bees will know it the trees
[2:03:49] will know it the sky will know it the
[2:03:52] seed will know it can the church say
[2:03:54] Amen oh somebody give the Lord a shout
[2:03:57] of Praise hallelujah
[2:04:00] hallelujah oh my my my my my my
[2:04:04] my oh I'm getting ready to close out now
[2:04:08] could you take some
[2:04:09] [Applause]
[2:04:12] more Hallelujah so brother brandham he
[2:04:16] proclaimed a message a shout message and
[2:04:19] that shout message was a call to war
[2:04:21] that message was to place Us in another
[2:04:23] Ephesians that in another Ephesians
[2:04:26] where the faith will be preached and
[2:04:28] brother stepen was so tremendous a
[2:04:29] couple of weeks ago speaking about the
[2:04:31] faith not a faith or a belief or a
[2:04:33] Doctrine but the faith that the early
[2:04:36] church had because Malachi 4 come to
[2:04:38] restore the heart of the children back
[2:04:41] to the apostolic faith because it takes
[2:04:43] Faith to operate to power it takes Faith
[2:04:46] to move the sword so every service we
[2:04:49] getting prepared by the word we're
[2:04:51] getting heed by the word because faith
[2:04:53] comes by hearing the word and when you
[2:04:55] are convinced and you get concerned that
[2:04:57] the time is now and God is able and he's
[2:05:00] still the same yesterday today and
[2:05:03] forever then all of a sudden your walk
[2:05:05] begins to change your talk begins to
[2:05:07] change and every attack the devil could
[2:05:09] put might be against your body but he
[2:05:11] could never touch your soul there's a
[2:05:13] seed in your soul that the devil cannot
[2:05:16] touch but the pop well he could watch
[2:05:18] you he could bring your headaches and
[2:05:20] your mind battles and mess with your
[2:05:21] mind and your memory and your conscience
[2:05:23] and your imagination but your soul
[2:05:26] belongs to God and the devil is mad he's
[2:05:29] [Music]
[2:05:34] upset Hallelujah so maybe after this
[2:05:38] year you're a little tired you're a
[2:05:40] little weary and you know there are some
[2:05:42] people they they almost want to send
[2:05:44] themselves off all
[2:05:47] right maybe a little tired maybe a
[2:05:49] little weary but I want to encourage you
[2:05:52] this morning maybe you didn't understand
[2:05:54] how this happened why this happened
[2:05:56] maybe you have seen so much you don't
[2:05:58] even know if you want to fight anymore
[2:05:59] say let young people
[2:06:03] fight but today we are all going to
[2:06:05] fight for every inch of ground we all
[2:06:09] going to fight to see these gray hairs
[2:06:10] turn back black I was saying to my wife
[2:06:13] just yesterday I find my rate of gray
[2:06:15] hair growth is becoming
[2:06:18] exponential it used to be one or two I
[2:06:20] tell within last two months I just see
[2:06:22] like a whole crop of gray
[2:06:27] hair but brother the Barry that gray
[2:06:29] hair got to turn back
[2:06:32] hall that great hair got to go got that
[2:06:35] my promise if my hair grows he to see
[2:06:38] here is a little lower than the size for
[2:06:40] some reason I don't know why one time I
[2:06:43] told you Bara cut this to match this
[2:06:52] but it's a showdown amen amen Paul's
[2:06:55] today said death where's your sting
[2:06:57] grave where's your Victory he looked it
[2:06:58] in his face and
[2:07:00] laughed show down because he knew where
[2:07:02] he was standing that's the confidence we
[2:07:05] must all have he could speak that way
[2:07:08] because he had met the pillar of
[2:07:10] fire his approval was not from men his
[2:07:13] approval was not from Gel his approval
[2:07:16] was not from Jerusalem his approval was
[2:07:18] from the pillar of fire the pillar of
[2:07:20] fire placed him into his position and
[2:07:22] that's what we want sons and daughters
[2:07:25] of God placed by
[2:07:27] fire whether we have a service or not
[2:07:30] your connection is vertical your
[2:07:33] connection is not horizontal if brother
[2:07:35] Steven isn't here I can't be like oh
[2:07:37] gosh I wonder what going on no my
[2:07:39] connection is
[2:07:41] vertical if nobody else want to worship
[2:07:43] my eyes are closed to everybody else
[2:07:47] what they going through is not what I'm
[2:07:48] going through I will worship nobody well
[2:07:51] no nobody else standing up so I what is
[2:07:54] that
[2:07:56] your your connection must be
[2:07:59] vertical when God speaks to you you
[2:08:02] respond because God is speaking to you
[2:08:05] if nobody else is hearing him this
[2:08:06] morning and you hear him you should be
[2:08:08] so happy so excited to hear the voice of
[2:08:12] God inside of your soul somebody say
[2:08:19] Amen my could you take some more
[2:08:22] it's the last Sunday you know no I don't
[2:08:25] want you to think I'm finished you
[2:08:32] know you're getting service today and
[2:08:35] next week one
[2:08:41] time from the message putting on the
[2:08:43] whole armor of God and said you know in
[2:08:46] this Warfare between nations there's a
[2:08:48] great Warfare going on beyond that so
[2:08:51] while the Bible says you'll hear of wars
[2:08:52] and rumors of wars and the end is not
[2:08:54] yet but the bandam is now saying let's
[2:08:55] go a little higher than that there's a
[2:08:57] great Warfare going on beyond that and
[2:09:00] that's a great Warfare between God and
[2:09:02] Satan a great Warfare that was the first
[2:09:04] Warfare and it's still raging but oh I'm
[2:09:07] so glad it'll soon come to an end then
[2:09:11] it'll all be over and listen listen
[2:09:13] carefully young
[2:09:14] people Satan has his agents out
[2:09:19] everywhere I want you to get this so
[2:09:21] this is not about you coming to church
[2:09:22] and going to work and going to school
[2:09:24] Satan has his agents out everywhere
[2:09:27] watching spying out on God's people
[2:09:30] God's
[2:09:32] moves the enemy is sitting everywhere
[2:09:34] watching to see what he can do and God's
[2:09:37] got some out too so God's got some
[2:09:40] agents out too brother Shane so we find
[2:09:42] out that these secret agents of the
[2:09:44] enemy that sits around now listen but
[2:09:46] the B said each Nation now will equip
[2:09:49] its men with the latest equipment all
[2:09:51] right
[2:09:52] the very latest and they study and they
[2:09:54] do everything they're trying to
[2:09:56] counteract the other fellow's weapons
[2:09:59] and to get a little more modern weapon a
[2:10:02] little something with a little more
[2:10:03] punch to it from the bow and arrow to a
[2:10:06] musket and from a musket a modern rifle
[2:10:08] and from that to an atomic they just
[2:10:10] keep on building and it keeps them busy
[2:10:13] all the time and it's the nations's
[2:10:15] business if they want to survive they
[2:10:18] want to equip their solers with the best
[2:10:20] equipment that there is brother brandom
[2:10:23] goes on he said well God you know he's
[2:10:25] infinite see he don't have to think of
[2:10:27] anything better he's just got the best
[2:10:30] to begin with so you can't improve on it
[2:10:34] nothing's to be done about it he just
[2:10:37] gives us the best and that's his word
[2:10:39] that's right that's his word the best
[2:10:42] that can be given and God gives his
[2:10:44] people the very best that's what he
[2:10:47] chose for his children the very very
[2:10:49] best I'm so glad of that listen to The
[2:10:53] Prophet now God cannot make a decision
[2:10:56] today listen carefully and tomorrow come
[2:10:59] back and make a better
[2:11:02] decision Hallelujah let me say that
[2:11:04] again God cannot make a decision today
[2:11:07] and come back tomorrow and make a better
[2:11:10] decision so if God elected you he cannot
[2:11:14] come back and make a better decision to
[2:11:18] pick somebody else
[2:11:22] when God chose you he made the best
[2:11:25] decision he made the best choice you
[2:11:28] were his first choice you were not his
[2:11:30] second
[2:11:31] choice can the church say
[2:11:34] Amen listen to The Prophet see because
[2:11:37] his first decision is perfect he never
[2:11:40] has to change it so therefore we can
[2:11:43] rest upon whatever God says and if God
[2:11:46] says you're going to get the Holy Ghost
[2:11:49] that decision is already made there's no
[2:11:51] better decision we can rest on that and
[2:11:55] I'm resting on it this morning we are
[2:11:57] going to have a Revival we are going to
[2:11:59] have a
[2:12:03] Revival oh
[2:12:05] my my oh my oh my everybody feeling fine
[2:12:12] everybody feeling energized you ready
[2:12:14] for another 3 hours oh
[2:12:16] [Applause]
[2:12:20] my
[2:12:22] Hallelujah so we are getting ready for
[2:12:24] war brother the B said in the message of
[2:12:26] paradox he said any man that believes
[2:12:28] God any man it doesn't even speak about
[2:12:32] his condition he said any man that
[2:12:35] believes God and takes him at his word
[2:12:38] no matter what the situation is God will
[2:12:42] perform another Paradox to keep his word
[2:12:46] it didn't say how you're living how
[2:12:48] you're acting he said If any man believe
[2:12:49] God and take him his word no wonder but
[2:12:53] the brand could talk about the people
[2:12:54] would come and get healed in the prayer
[2:12:56] lines who were prostitutes who were
[2:12:59] living any way they wanted but they
[2:13:00] believed God and they took him at his
[2:13:03] word and God healed them and people sat
[2:13:05] in the Tabernacle for 20 years to 10
[2:13:09] years for 5 years believing and got
[2:13:12] nothing because they didn't have the
[2:13:13] faith but this morning we have a Fai to
[2:13:16] see God do something
[2:13:21] am you may be seated not by legalism not
[2:13:24] by rules and I said to them in maraval
[2:13:27] listen this gospel is message is not
[2:13:29] about
[2:13:30] rules do this don't do this do this
[2:13:32] don't do this the young people say we
[2:13:34] have too much rules it's not about rules
[2:13:36] it's about
[2:13:38] [Applause]
[2:13:41] love so I said to them in marava my wife
[2:13:44] wasn't in the service but I said if my
[2:13:46] wife tells me to put the white clothes
[2:13:48] here and put the colored here
[2:13:51] because it's easier to wash I could go
[2:13:54] and tell my friends boy Tony boy my wife
[2:13:56] have real
[2:13:57] rules I have to put the white here and
[2:14:00] put the color here but it's not a rule
[2:14:03] to me it's love because if she loves it
[2:14:06] that way my love for her to make her
[2:14:09] happy will make all the whes here and
[2:14:12] all the colored here so I don't see it
[2:14:14] as a rule I love her so if she want the
[2:14:17] white clothes here white clothes colored
[2:14:20] here color cloes and whatever God wants
[2:14:23] from me if he says do it this way I say
[2:14:26] yes Lord here yes Lord here is at the
[2:14:29] rule he loves me I love him it's a
[2:14:34] relationship you may be
[2:14:36] [Applause]
[2:14:39] seated and but read but R said it two
[2:14:42] weeks ago you know there's a Facebook
[2:14:43] status relationship status single
[2:14:46] married and have it's complicated he
[2:14:49] said your relationship with God cannot
[2:14:50] be complicated it's either it's real or
[2:14:53] it's not you can't be not sure how
[2:14:56] things stand between you and God our
[2:14:57] relationship we kind of Rocky no no no
[2:14:59] no no keep that relationship on point
[2:15:01] all the time the same he give you gifts
[2:15:04] you give him gifts a sacrifice of praise
[2:15:07] that's a gift to him surprise him with a
[2:15:09] gift of worship surprise him with
[2:15:12] spontaneous Glory just standing the
[2:15:15] middle of the day lock yourself in the
[2:15:17] bathroom and say Lord I Want to Thank
[2:15:19] You for Your Grace and your love and
[2:15:21] your
[2:15:29] mercy can the church say
[2:15:31] Amen I'm all over the place this morning
[2:15:34] but I pray this gives you some substance
[2:15:36] to fight the battle that when nobody
[2:15:39] else is around that's that's what this
[2:15:40] is about but you could stand when nobody
[2:15:44] else is looking anywhere under any time
[2:15:47] under any condition the earthquake must
[2:15:50] come on you must look around and stand
[2:15:51] strong knowing that the canopy of life
[2:15:53] you know brother Brandon walked and
[2:15:55] there was a bubble around him people
[2:15:58] would come to him and they would stop he
[2:15:59] said don't be afraid that's just the
[2:16:01] presence of God
[2:16:03] hallelujah it was something you could
[2:16:04] feel hallelujah it's something that you
[2:16:07] just recognize you hit something you
[2:16:09] can't see with the eye but he was
[2:16:12] protected and don't you know when you
[2:16:14] give your life completely to him and he
[2:16:16] takes the driver's seat because he is in
[2:16:19] there he has his own security guards so
[2:16:21] when he's in there his security guards
[2:16:23] become your security
[2:16:25] guards can the church say
[2:16:29] amen I want you to understand friends if
[2:16:31] the president of the United States is
[2:16:32] driving and this his whole motorcade the
[2:16:35] plane on top all the security and you
[2:16:38] just stand in by you say come and get a
[2:16:39] ride with me and you sit in that
[2:16:43] car then all of a sudden you are
[2:16:47] protected you are just as protected as
[2:16:50] the president of the United States so
[2:16:53] when you think God plac the Holy Ghost
[2:16:54] which is a part of himself in you isn't
[2:16:57] he obligated to protect
[2:17:01] himself that's why he said no weapon
[2:17:03] formed against you can prosper because
[2:17:06] they tried weapons on Jesus but it
[2:17:08] couldn't
[2:17:11] Prosper they will pick up deadly things
[2:17:14] they wouldn't harm them if death
[2:17:16] couldn't kill him how could it affect
[2:17:18] you it might change your location your
[2:17:20] dwell place but your soul belongs to
[2:17:23] God you are Cut From a Different Cloth
[2:17:26] your DNA has has has has has has
[2:17:29] Resurrection built in there not
[2:17:32] everybody has that you know that's why
[2:17:34] you confuse the doctors how much
[2:17:37] testimony you have you don't know how
[2:17:38] you made it through and the doctor said
[2:17:40] this about you that about you we read it
[2:17:42] every Sunday praise after praise after
[2:17:44] praise is your DNA is different your
[2:17:47] blood type is not AO or a positive or
[2:17:50] that's not your blood type your blood
[2:17:52] type is the same genes that come from
[2:17:54] [Applause]
[2:17:56] God can the church say
[2:18:01] Amen just a little more I'm just trying
[2:18:03] to find a way to close out here to
[2:18:06] encourage you so we are getting ready
[2:18:08] for war for a final showdown a final
[2:18:12] battle Abraham is counting on us Joshua
[2:18:16] is counting on us David is counting on
[2:18:18] us they did their part to the best of
[2:18:20] their ability but they had to pass the
[2:18:23] Baton on to the next group to take it
[2:18:25] and the next man to take it and the next
[2:18:27] judge and the next prophet and when
[2:18:29] Jesus came he passed the Batton on to
[2:18:31] the church all that was in God important
[2:18:33] to Christ all that was in Christ
[2:18:35] important to his church and then the
[2:18:37] first church Age come and when they were
[2:18:38] done they pass it on and every age was a
[2:18:41] battle every age had a thunder every age
[2:18:44] had a voice every age had a message
[2:18:46] every age had a people every age had a
[2:18:48] Time amen but now we are the end of the
[2:18:51] ages hallah there's no more Messenger to
[2:18:54] come but there is a people on the land
[2:18:57] there's no more time to come because
[2:18:59] time is no more we are in that season
[2:19:02] now where the devil is confused the
[2:19:05] devil is mad he doesn't understand what
[2:19:07] is going on but a bride is getting ready
[2:19:09] you know what brother brandham said the
[2:19:11] third P is for the weaker ones the ones
[2:19:14] who don't even have the Fai can't even
[2:19:15] must the faith but the Bram also said
[2:19:18] that when you get over there you're
[2:19:19] going to see people there you never
[2:19:21] thought we're going to make it so God
[2:19:24] picked for declarant a bunch of Misfits
[2:19:27] a bunch of unqualified people just like
[2:19:30] how we picked Peter and James and John
[2:19:32] who were not qualified God picked a
[2:19:35] bunch of unqualified people who didn't
[2:19:37] have the best
[2:19:40] resumés they didn't have the best
[2:19:42] resumés brother the kangali they didn't
[2:19:43] have the best qualifications but he
[2:19:46] still say I'm going to choose you Paul
[2:19:48] was a murderer he still choose Paul
[2:19:50] Peter was of all kind of he still choose
[2:19:53] him David was all he still choose him
[2:19:56] and why God wouldn't choose you you are
[2:19:58] already chosen to overcome in such a
[2:20:01] time as this and to
[2:20:03] [Applause]
[2:20:05] overcome I'm looking for a point to
[2:20:07] close out I got some a lot more here but
[2:20:10] I want to close out but friends this
[2:20:12] final showdown will bring in your family
[2:20:15] this final showdown will bring in your
[2:20:17] loved ones this world will shake but the
[2:20:19] BR said it'll be so much power this
[2:20:21] world will cannot contain it all and
[2:20:24] then the Rapture is going to take place
[2:20:25] he said it won't last long but it's
[2:20:27] going to be here a short quick message
