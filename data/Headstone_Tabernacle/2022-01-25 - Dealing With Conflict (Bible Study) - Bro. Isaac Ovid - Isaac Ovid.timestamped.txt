[12:34] brother marlon alexander in prayer as
[12:38] he's recovering from the virus for
[12:40] complete recovery and i'm sure i'm
[12:42] certain tonight that there are many
[12:44] requests
[12:46] of differing needs
[12:48] be it physical be it health
[12:50] family be it
[12:52] uh business and job related there are so
[12:54] many areas in our lives where we are
[12:56] needy people tonight so we want to
[12:58] approach the throne of grace with
[13:00] reverence and respect
[13:02] heavenly father we come before your
[13:04] presence tonight lord so grateful for
[13:08] your word and for your promises to us
[13:11] lord there is nothing we could have ever
[13:14] done or could ever do
[13:17] lord to deserve what you have done for
[13:19] us lord your love
[13:21] we lack the words lord to describe it
[13:24] lord we lack the way to express how much
[13:27] it means to us that you could find us at
[13:30] the point of our need and reveal
[13:32] yourself to us
[13:33] and lord we come here tonight as needy
[13:36] children father lord to hear a word from
[13:39] you
[13:40] lord as we come on a tuesday evening
[13:42] lord to interrupt lord the hustle and
[13:45] the bustle of the week there are so many
[13:47] ways we could be spending our time there
[13:49] are so many things we could choose to do
[13:52] but we choose you tonight
[13:55] we choose your word tonight we choose
[13:57] your will tonight we choose
[14:00] lord to become closer to you
[14:03] and closer to one another as part of
[14:05] this family of god
[14:07] father united by the spirit lord being
[14:10] baptized by one spirit
[14:12] into that one body that mystical body
[14:15] and father tonight we are a body that's
[14:18] in need of a touch
[14:19] lord we have members with different
[14:21] types of situations different types of
[14:23] conditions lord and lord we understand
[14:26] the authority that you are placed in the
[14:28] church of the living god over sickness
[14:30] over diseases over situations over
[14:32] challenges and lord we come to lay it at
[14:35] your feet you're set to cast all of our
[14:37] cares lord upon you and that's what we
[14:40] come to do tonight to cast our cares
[14:43] upon you and to trust you to work it out
[14:45] father we thank you for our precious
[14:48] brother marlon lord and he has put in a
[14:50] request for a complete healing a
[14:52] complete touch may you minister to your
[14:54] son tonight lord and touch from the
[14:56] crown of his head to the souls of his
[14:58] feet lord and for every other brother

[15:03] perhaps someone who may hear the deep
[15:05] lord that needs a touch in their body
[15:07] father me the angel of the lord lord
[15:10] lord step into the room where they're at
[15:12] and touch them from the crown of their
[15:14] heads to the souls of their feet if

[15:17] encouragement a word from you may you
[15:20] speak to them tonight father take me out
[15:21] of the way lord i submit my thoughts my
[15:24] ideas to you lord for that you could
[15:26] speak lip to hear use me as your
[15:28] instrument that's just a microphone to
[15:30] speak to your children
[15:32] lord as we approach your scripture may
[15:33] you open our understanding to your word
[15:36] and may you be with each one tonight we
[15:38] commit this bible study to your hands in
[15:40] the precious name of jesus christ amen
[15:42] and amen and amen
[15:44] it's certainly a great privilege to be
[15:46] here tonight for bible study
[15:48] and um i really want to firstly salute
[15:51] brother ovid for the
[15:53] masterpiece of a message on sunday last
[15:57] my i
[15:58] don't even have the words to describe it
[16:00] and there was a such a super anointing
[16:03] that dropped down
[16:05] that i know
[16:06] was felt both in the tabernacle as well
[16:09] as those who were connected on the
[16:12] internet and truly
[16:13] it was not brought over that that that's
[16:15] how i'll say it it was not brought over
[16:17] it was a lord speaking through his
[16:19] servant to us
[16:21] and it was such a fitting timely message
[16:23] that i trust that if you
[16:26] um have not seen it that you certainly
[16:28] go check it out and for those who have
[16:30] it is certainly worth um watching again
[16:32] you know so i want to encourage you
[16:34] tonight for a few minutes
[16:37] as we continue to travel along the right
[16:39] road
[16:41] um
[16:41] in this journey in this 2022
[16:44] um we would have had one bible study
[16:46] thus far this is our second
[16:48] um for the year
[16:51] and
[16:51] uh you know life has its way with so
[16:54] much that's coming to us you know as i
[16:56] was
[16:57] driving home from work today you know i
[16:59] was saying that
[17:00] you know if somebody were to stop me now
[17:02] for wood you know i've i've found myself
[17:05] more and more realizing that you know
[17:07] and we've said it it's about the right
[17:09] balance you know
[17:11] you you want to
[17:12] have the balance in your life
[17:15] the right balance with this time that
[17:17] we're living in
[17:19] the consciousness of the pandemic and
[17:22] and the stream it could place on you and
[17:24] sometimes it just gets you tired it gets
[17:26] you wary if you just get caught up in it
[17:29] even if you're not into it it's just a a
[17:32] atmosphere that you're in you know and
[17:35] it's so important and um
[17:37] you know i was thinking
[17:38] you know i said you know after elijah
[17:41] had his mount carmel you know experience
[17:44] you know he found himself there in a
[17:47] valley almost of depression as it were
[17:49] you know found himself there struggling
[17:52] you know and and the reality is
[17:54] you know sometimes we don't talk about
[17:56] it much
[17:57] but we get tired you know and sometimes
[17:59] we don't we don't want to admit it but
[18:02] sometimes we just get tired
[18:03] and it's important to know where your
[18:06] anchor holds when you get tired you know
[18:08] it's important to know what keeps you
[18:11] standing when when you may not have all
[18:14] of this strength to fight you know and
[18:15] and and in part i want to touch on that
[18:17] just uh just a little bit for a few
[18:19] minutes tonight i have a thought and i'm
[18:22] trusting god tonight to help bring it
[18:24] out in the right kind of a way that it
[18:27] could help us
[18:28] and if
[18:30] it is not focused at us specifically
[18:34] maybe can help someone who is in contact
[18:36] with us
[18:37] you know sometimes we come to church and
[18:39] and the word that comes to us
[18:41] and sometimes it is because we are so
[18:43] selfish
[18:45] that
[18:45] we hear something and we tell ourselves
[18:47] you know that's that's not for me and we
[18:50] miss the point that sometimes god is
[18:52] equipping us to deal with somebody that
[18:54] we will interact with somebody who comes
[18:57] into contact with us you know so
[19:00] i have learned more and more to not take
[19:02] things lightly you know and i want to
[19:05] encourage you tonight
[19:07] i sort of have two parts to this bible
[19:09] study and one part of it may be for you
[19:12] and if it's not for you
[19:14] it may be somebody you'll interact with
[19:16] a bit
[19:16] and then there's another part that i
[19:18] want to kind of touch
[19:19] on for everyone
[19:21] that i believe by the grace of god will
[19:23] be a blessing it's been a burden on my
[19:25] heart
[19:26] um for some time i shared it brother
[19:28] with what i wanted to kind of touch on
[19:29] and i don't know if i'll get into all of
[19:32] it tonight i told them this evening
[19:35] i don't intend to be too long
[19:37] and sometimes i say that and i go longer
[19:39] than i intend
[19:40] and um so i need to stop
[19:43] stop saying and just get to do it you
[19:45] know by the grace of god
[19:47] so i have a small thought tonight and
[19:50] it's not something that
[19:51] i have heard
[19:53] expressed much or talked about but it's
[19:55] something we all deal with so
[19:58] the tortoise is dealing with conflict
[20:01] dealing
[20:02] with conflict
[20:06] and
[20:07] conflict is
[20:10] inevitable
[20:12] you put two people in a room
[20:16] and it is actually impossible to get
[20:19] them to agree on every single thing
[20:22] that's the nature of life
[20:24] sometimes it's as a result of our
[20:26] upbringing it's our exposure what we
[20:28] have gone through
[20:30] sometimes as a result of trauma
[20:32] sometimes it's a result of maybe
[20:34] successes we would have had or feel as
[20:36] we would have had but we end up taking
[20:38] certain positions about certain things
[20:41] and maybe the position we take is not
[20:43] wrong
[20:44] but just because we take a position on
[20:46] something it is in conflict with someone
[20:48] else's position and as a result there's
[20:50] conflict
[20:52] sometimes you walk into a room and you
[20:53] realize that somebody in your room just
[20:56] just don't take to you and for some
[20:57] reason you have to contend with that you
[20:59] have to deal with that and it is not
[21:02] that you chose a part
[21:04] a path of conflict but you just have to
[21:06] deal with conflict
[21:09] there's conflict in families
[21:12] there's
[21:13] conflict that's inevitable in a family
[21:15] so it is not that
[21:17] you're not supposed to have conflict
[21:19] what we want to speak about a little bit
[21:21] tonight is how to deal
[21:23] with conflict there's conflict in
[21:26] marriages
[21:27] and if that is not dealt with in the
[21:29] right way it could lead to
[21:32] big problems
[21:34] there's conflict between siblings
[21:38] brothers and sisters
[21:40] sisters and sisters
[21:42] brothers and brothers and if it's not
[21:44] dealt with the right way
[21:46] we could end up with big problems
[21:48] there's conflict between parents and
[21:50] children children and parents and if
[21:53] it's not dealt with the right way
[21:55] as spiritual as we may be as educated as
[21:58] we may be as talented as experienced as
[22:01] mature as we think we are
[22:03] conflict that is handled in a wrong way
[22:07] leads to great issues
[22:09] countries have gone to war over matters
[22:12] that could have been discussed
[22:15] some conflicts took place because of
[22:17] issues in the translation of language
[22:20] and the list goes on and on but the
[22:22] reality is conflict
[22:24] we will always have
[22:27] sometimes we shake when we go into
[22:28] family gatherings when the whole family
[22:30] come together because whenever
[22:32] especially when they're from a big
[22:33] family you have all these ideas and
[22:35] opinions and perspectives and god help
[22:37] you if you start to talk about the
[22:38] government and politics and the
[22:41] socio-economic situation and no matter
[22:42] what it is you get this flurry of of of
[22:46] of energy and and argument and debate
[22:48] and some people live for that
[22:51] wait you know
[22:53] to get in a room where they can say well
[22:55] you right here what happened here and
[22:56] going on and no it's not so it's not so
[22:58] and i hear from somebody else and no
[23:00] you're wrong no that is not and and they
[23:02] live in that and and conflict could be
[23:05] subtle it could be expressed it could be
[23:07] external it could also be internal
[23:12] so tonight i want to deal with it from
[23:14] two perspectives i want to touch on the
[23:16] internal conflict
[23:18] i also want to deal with some external
[23:20] conflicts now normally when i am looking
[23:24] at
[23:24] breaking stuff like this out i always
[23:28] like to deal with the external first and
[23:29] leave the internal last
[23:32] because i always say the greatest enemy
[23:34] is is yourself
[23:36] it's it's actually easier to deal with
[23:38] with with
[23:39] other people but you see but that that
[23:41] enemy within is the big one to you to
[23:44] deal with you know and
[23:46] and to not do it a disservice by the
[23:48] grace of god i want to reverse the
[23:50] script a little bit and deal with the
[23:52] internal conflict a little bit first
[23:54] but not maybe how you might think it
[23:56] might be
[23:57] i want to deal with it because conflict
[24:00] is not just about argument
[24:02] conflict is about a clash
[24:04] a class of ideas a clash of principles
[24:07] sometimes you don't know where you're
[24:08] standing so you're you're undecided and
[24:11] even being undecided itself is a form of
[24:14] conflict
[24:15] sometimes you don't know where you stand
[24:17] and you trying to reconcile where you
[24:19] stand even where you stand with god and
[24:22] because of that there is conflict
[24:25] some of us find ourselves in conflict
[24:27] with god we're not even dealing with
[24:29] church we find ourselves in conflict
[24:32] with god
[24:34] anybody with me tonight
[24:36] so i want to start a little bit
[24:39] by
[24:40] before getting into into into
[24:42] conflicting family and this kind of
[24:43] stuff i want to talk a little bit about
[24:45] conflict
[24:46] the conflict within
[24:51] and if most of us would care to admit it
[24:54] we would always have to deal with this
[24:56] conflict within and how do we find back
[24:59] the anchor or the balance or recalibrate
[25:02] or the north star or wherever you want
[25:03] to see it
[25:04] and i can find almost no better example
[25:07] for for this part of it than the
[25:10] psalmist david
[25:12] and as i would have said david is unique
[25:14] i'm hard-pressed when i look at bible
[25:16] characters i always say it's very
[25:17] difficult to identify
[25:20] who my favorite bible character is it
[25:22] really doesn't sound right to say you
[25:23] have a favorite but david has an unfair
[25:26] advantage
[25:27] only because he is one of the only
[25:29] characters in scripture that we see so
[25:32] much of his life
[25:33] for most other characters it's a sliver
[25:35] it's a portion of a period in their
[25:37] lives but in the case of david we see
[25:39] the young david as a boy we see the
[25:41] teenager we see the young king we see
[25:44] the david on the run we see the old
[25:46] david you see david on the death bed we
[25:48] see the tapestry of his life before us
[25:50] and i would have preached when i spoke
[25:52] on david a man after god's own heart
[25:55] that almost every emotion that somebody
[25:58] could experience david felt it
[26:01] not just felt it he expressed it so he
[26:03] would go through and we would have read
[26:05] it
[26:06] where you read in psalms 3 for example
[26:08] where david would scream out oh lord how
[26:11] are they increase that trouble me
[26:14] many are there that rise up against me
[26:16] many there be with say of my soul there
[26:19] is no help for him in god
[26:22] but thou o lord had a shield for me
[26:26] every time i read these scriptures it's
[26:27] an encouragement to me but though oh
[26:30] lord and and and
[26:32] i love
[26:33] the use
[26:34] as i was thinking about the study of the
[26:37] word but
[26:38] because david
[26:39] always creates this contrast of his
[26:41] situation but he always find the butt
[26:46] to separate
[26:48] how he feels
[26:49] from the path where god gets involved
[26:52] and it's such an encouragement because
[26:54] he said lord how did i increase and go
[26:56] and receive but
[26:58] and he puts a line in his hand and he
[27:00] says but no matter how i feel but now oh
[27:03] lord at a shield from me
[27:06] my glory and the lifter up of my head i
[27:09] cried unto the lord with my voice and he
[27:11] heard me out of his holy hill
[27:14] i laid me down and slept i awaked for
[27:17] the lord sustained me
[27:19] this is the same man who earlier in this
[27:21] chapter talking about how many increases
[27:23] that trouble in him but now he is
[27:26] declaring for himself
[27:28] i will not be afraid of ten thousands of
[27:30] people that have set themselves against
[27:32] me route about somehow
[27:35] through his expression of what he was
[27:38] going through he found his butt movement
[27:41] he found his anchor movement he found
[27:43] where he could make a left turn around
[27:46] along the road he was going to because
[27:48] he could have kept going down the road
[27:50] of the self-pity the road of the
[27:52] negativity the road of the challenges
[27:55] the road of the overwhelming stress
[28:03] and we get overwhelmed
[28:06] i told somebody recently i feel
[28:08] overwhelmed
[28:09] and i and i not shamed to say it
[28:13] because life sometimes gets us
[28:14] overwhelmed but we have to find the butt
[28:18] moment
[28:20] but thou o lord
[28:22] and david is the example because david
[28:24] through scripture the bible said he
[28:26] encouraged himself and i was saying to
[28:28] myself and you have to forgive me
[28:30] sometimes before i preach to you or
[28:32] share something with you i'm preaching
[28:33] to myself
[28:35] so i have the experience if you meet mr
[28:37] mind driving
[28:38] and you see me talking
[28:40] and nobody around no worries is you are
[28:42] talking to just in advance
[28:45] you know what i and i was saying to
[28:46] myself coming out of my car
[28:48] because i can remember how this sequence
[28:50] took place i see how blessed we are to
[28:52] be able to gather on a tuesday evening
[28:55] to get a word of encouragement david
[28:57] didn't have that in him
[28:59] david had to find his butt moment he has
[29:02] to find his his own way and the bible
[29:04] said he encouraged himself in the lord
[29:10] right now we shall be so grateful that
[29:12] we can have the opportunity to gather
[29:13] like this
[29:14] but there will come a time friends when
[29:16] we have to encourage ourselves in the
[29:19] lord
[29:20] when there'll be no opportunity like
[29:22] this to be encouraged but you need to
[29:24] know
[29:25] what bank account you're drawing your
[29:26] strength from and understand that your
[29:30] signature is good as your father's or
[29:32] anybody with me tonight that whatever
[29:34] you have need of you could tap into and
[29:36] you can encourage yourself no matter
[29:38] what you're going through
[29:40] so this is the david and the
[29:41] reconciliation of david
[29:43] but this david doesn't sound overly
[29:46] overwhelmed
[29:47] david this david he is overwhelmed but
[29:50] there's a level of overwhelmness
[29:52] and in part the conflict of
[29:54] understatement is about that being
[29:56] overwhelmed
[30:03] psalms 8
[30:05] we see a different contrast of david
[30:08] oh lord our good
[30:10] o lord our lord
[30:13] how excellent is thy name in all the
[30:15] years
[30:15] who has set thy glory above the heavens
[30:19] out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
[30:21] had our ordained strength because of
[30:23] thine enemies that thou might is still
[30:25] the enemy and the avenger when i
[30:28] consider thy heavens the work of thy
[30:30] fingers the moon and the stars which
[30:33] thou has ordained what is
[30:36] mindful of him and the son of man that
[30:38] thou visited him but thou has made him a
[30:41] little lower than the angels and has
[30:42] crowned him with glory and honor
[30:45] and when i look at this picture of david
[30:48] you see almost the other side of david
[30:50] the david is on fire for god
[30:52] and that's wonderful
[30:55] but for a few moments i want to go into
[30:56] one psalm that
[30:59] sees another picture of david
[31:02] and as i was going through this study i
[31:04] was like
[31:05] wow
[31:07] i pray this will be an encouragement to
[31:09] you tonight
[31:11] and like i said this is the part where
[31:13] say if it's not for you maybe it'll help
[31:15] you encourage somebody else
[31:17] so i want to look at psalm 13 and we'll
[31:19] take it a bit slowly we'll see how far
[31:21] how much we do into this and then
[31:23] determine by the grace of globally time
[31:25] where we'll go next
[31:29] psalms 13 verse 1 you can find it with
[31:32] me
[31:34] and listen to the conflict remember we
[31:36] talk about dealing with conflict right
[31:38] this is the internal conflict
[31:41] and david is saying how long
[31:46] will thou forget me
[31:48] oh lord
[31:50] forever
[31:54] anybody ever felt forgotten
[31:57] anybody ever felt like you're waiting on
[31:59] a promise you're looking for something
[32:02] and you're wondering
[32:04] lord even there
[32:06] is there hope for me
[32:09] is there a way
[32:10] i feel forgotten i see i see other
[32:13] people getting blessed to see things
[32:15] happening but it's as if god forget me
[32:19] not only was david accepting a level of
[32:22] forgetting but he was asking how long
[32:25] and he almost come to a conclusion
[32:27] forever
[32:28] like there's no end it is forgetting
[32:32] now this is david expressing how he's
[32:34] feeling huh
[32:38] many times you talk to people and they
[32:40] feel like listen i don't know how long i
[32:42] could keep going you know but here
[32:43] they're saying lord how long will thou
[32:46] forget me oh lord forever
[32:50] how long will thou hide thy face from me
[32:55] anybody ever feel like
[32:57] they're praying and they're carrying and
[32:59] they're holding on and they're looking
[33:01] for a change and
[33:02] sometimes sometimes sometimes it feels
[33:05] like there's there's no answer and you
[33:07] can almost feel like i wonder if god
[33:10] even looking in my direction i wonder if
[33:12] if i waste some time because david was
[33:14] expressing sometimes what we may not
[33:17] even care to express ourselves
[33:20] david was feeling and expressing his
[33:22] feeling how long will thou hide thy face
[33:25] in other words david is saying lord are
[33:27] not seeing your face
[33:30] lord oh i want to see him look upon his
[33:33] face
[33:34] and and the the other part because
[33:37] david's expression would would would
[33:39] reflect that he was longing
[33:42] to connect but it as if god wasn't doing
[33:44] his part i want us to catch this
[33:48] so the conflict david is feeling i don't
[33:50] want to miss this it's a simple
[33:52] short chapter
[33:54] but it's deep in its meaning
[33:56] because many times when people give up
[33:58] it's because they feel like
[34:01] they say this thing not working i don't
[34:03] know how long i could
[34:05] and i want you to understand that you
[34:07] are not alone sometimes and feeling like
[34:10] is there a way out
[34:11] is there hope for me is god gonna answer
[34:14] my prayer is this is this worth it
[34:18] how long will thou hide thy face for me
[34:20] so david wasn't seeing it in a positive
[34:23] perspective that maybe maybe god has
[34:26] taken me through something david
[34:28] processed the silence of god
[34:31] as god hiding his face from him
[34:35] and one of the challenges with us is
[34:37] sometimes we have expectations of god
[34:41] and god's plan for us is different from
[34:44] our expectations and we process god's
[34:47] wisdom in a negative light
[34:52] all of us have gone through experiences
[34:54] in the last two years that could
[34:56] sometimes if we're out of the spirit we
[34:58] could wonder oh lord how long how long
[35:01] will you forget me
[35:03] forever
[35:05] how long will you hide your face from
[35:06] here praying for a change of job i'm
[35:09] praying for a situation in my home i'm
[35:11] praying for the conflict in my job to be
[35:14] resolved but how long will you hide your
[35:16] face from me
[35:17] because i want to get a response from
[35:19] you but it seems as if i getting no
[35:21] response
[35:24] like i said maybe it's not for you but
[35:25] maybe in having a conversation with a
[35:27] brother a sister a son a mother a father
[35:29] somebody else you could show them in
[35:31] scripture
[35:32] how to deal with when things aren't
[35:35] answered and things are unresolved and
[35:37] there's no closure to issues that you
[35:39] want
[35:42] closed listen to verse two how long
[35:46] shall i take counsel in my soul
[35:51] this is that
[35:52] counsel in your soul as you and yourself
[35:55] in other words david is saying are
[35:58] trying to resolve it inside
[36:01] for a long time i really need your help
[36:04] to resolve
[36:05] what's inside
[36:08] this is this is deep nowhere
[36:10] david is not dealing with his wife his
[36:12] brother his sister the priest the
[36:14] prophet the generals this is david
[36:16] himself saying this is me dealing with
[36:18] me
[36:21] how long shall i take counsel in my soul
[36:24] me trying to resolve my personal issues
[36:29] he said having sorrow in my heart daily
[36:33] this is the picture of somebody who has
[36:35] a burden as a situation maybe have
[36:38] nobody to talk to and they find
[36:40] themselves just taking counsel in their
[36:43] soul
[36:45] maybe you don't want to talk to nobody
[36:46] but it's there
[36:48] there's a sorrow in your heart daily and
[36:50] you're asking god a question lord how
[36:52] long will you forget me is it forever is
[36:54] there an end to it
[36:57] how long will you hide your face from me
[36:59] how long shall i take counsel in my soul
[37:02] having sorrow in my heart daily
[37:06] and david goes on how long shall my
[37:09] enemy
[37:10] be exalted over me
[37:14] this is one of the few places in
[37:15] scripture with this repetition and it
[37:18] speaks of the agony how long how long
[37:21] how long how long
[37:24] we don't know the mind of god in this we
[37:26] don't know what god is trying to unveil
[37:28] and david here but we know his
[37:31] perspective his feeling his emotion and
[37:34] for many of us
[37:35] who we sometimes don't want to wait on
[37:38] the will of god and way through the plan
[37:40] of god we end up in a state of thee how
[37:42] long
[37:43] verse 3
[37:45] consider
[37:47] and hear me
[37:48] o lord my god
[37:52] consider
[37:53] and hear me
[37:54] oh lord my god
[37:57] lighten mine eyes
[38:01] lighten mine eyes is a powerful
[38:03] statement it means to lift the weight
[38:05] over my eyes meaning my eyes not seeing
[38:09] my eyes are darkened my eyes are dimmed
[38:11] over i need a new perspective
[38:16] anybody tonight need a new perspective
[38:20] so david went that entire verse one and
[38:23] two is addressing
[38:25] what god can do and and this here is a
[38:28] real example of a journey of prayer and
[38:30] a finding back yourself in conflict
[38:33] it would almost appear in verse one that
[38:36] god is a problem
[38:38] i want us to understand how david
[38:40] himself
[38:41] because i always say david found a way
[38:43] to talk himself out of the situations
[38:45] and it's very it's a very teaching
[38:47] moment for us
[38:48] he starts off it's almost like he is
[38:50] almost accusing god how long will don't
[38:53] forget me oh lord meaning
[38:54] it's not an easy problem here right now
[38:56] you know lord is you you forgetting me
[38:58] how long will you do that he's almost
[38:59] pointing his finger at god in in in
[39:01] chapter one verse one in verse one all
[39:04] right how long will you hide your face
[39:06] from me almost as if to say if you were
[39:08] showing me your face my situation would
[39:10] be different so i am not the problem you
[39:13] are the problem i want us to catch this
[39:14] picture
[39:16] and how the reconciliation needs to take
[39:19] place of this conflict so here is
[39:21] internal conflict david is calling god
[39:24] to task how long will you forget me how
[39:27] long will you hide from me
[39:30] then he starts to move from god being
[39:32] the issue to himself being the issue how
[39:35] long shall i take counsel in my soul
[39:37] having sorrow in my heart
[39:39] how long shall my enemy be exalted over
[39:41] me
[39:42] then he starts to switch
[39:45] and this is important friends consider
[39:47] and hear me oh lord my god he makes a
[39:49] change
[39:51] and he confronts it
[39:52] lighten my eyes you know what you know
[39:55] what you know what tonight
[39:57] perhaps perhaps perhaps i'm not seeing
[40:00] things the right way
[40:02] i need a new perspective because if i
[40:04] don't see things different less i sleep
[40:06] the sleep of death so you're saying to
[40:08] god lighten mine eyes
[40:12] anybody catching this
[40:13] it's a simple chapter here in psalms and
[40:16] this is the psalmist david and the only
[40:17] man in scripture called a man after
[40:19] god's own heart
[40:20] saying let me recalibrate my perspective
[40:23] lighten my eyes maybe i have one shades
[40:26] maybe i have on darkers maybe you're
[40:29] allowing stuff to cloud with judgment
[40:30] because i'm not seeing things slightly
[40:32] but lord if you don't lighten my eyes
[40:35] and help me see this differently i'm
[40:37] gonna die
[40:41] when i saw this it confronted to me a
[40:44] whole issue for all of us as believers
[40:48] sometimes we need a new perspective
[40:51] sometimes we need to look at situations
[40:53] again
[40:55] sometimes we have looked at things for
[40:57] so long we haven't realized that our
[41:00] eyes have gotten dim and dark and we are
[41:02] not seeing what god wants us to see but
[41:04] david snapped himself in time to say
[41:07] lord lighten mine eyes
[41:10] lest i sleep the sleep of death
[41:13] lest my enemy that's a continuation she
[41:16] said unless i get a new perspective i'm
[41:18] going to die
[41:19] lest i see the sleep of death
[41:21] lester my enemies say i have previewed
[41:23] against him so in other words if i don't
[41:26] get a new perspective if my eyes don't
[41:28] get lightened tonight
[41:30] away from the negativity and the
[41:31] darkness and looking at the wrong things
[41:33] and seeing you wrong things and having a
[41:35] wrong perspective or wrong focus around
[41:37] image in my mind because your eyes you
[41:39] want into your soul if you stop seeing
[41:42] the right thing you can never find
[41:43] yourself anybody with me tonight
[41:46] lest my enemies say i have prevailed
[41:48] against him without a vision the people
[41:50] perishing
[41:52] this is it here
[41:53] david said i'm not seeing if if you
[41:55] don't light my eyes
[41:57] i'll die without a vision without vision
[41:59] without seeing
[42:00] that i'm a child of the king without
[42:02] seeing that is a possibility without
[42:04] seeing the opportunity that the realm of
[42:06] the spirit can give me to tap into the
[42:08] heavenlies
[42:09] i'll sleep to sleep of death
[42:11] lest my enemies say i have revealed
[42:13] against him
[42:15] and those that trouble me rejoice when i
[42:17] am moved
[42:21] i trust his encouragement to him
[42:24] because david start to pull himself out
[42:27] this here is almost the one defining
[42:31] chapter in the book of psalms where
[42:33] david could be almost described as being
[42:34] the most depressed he was ever was
[42:38] when you read if you read that first two
[42:41] verses alone and you walked away you
[42:44] would say this is a depressed man
[42:47] he was depressed
[42:50] but david is clawing himself out
[42:52] climbing pulling himself out of that
[42:55] condition
[42:58] and by verse 5 he throws in the but
[43:04] but i have trusted in thy mercy i have
[43:08] seen few people
[43:09] who could find i said finding the butt
[43:12] in your life but lord you took me
[43:14] through
[43:16] but when i had no food you put food on
[43:18] my table
[43:19] but when i didn't know how i was gonna
[43:21] pay this bill you make a way but when i
[43:23] couldn't see my way out
[43:27] and this but also when you read it it's
[43:30] also in past tension but i have trusted
[43:33] in thy mercy so he began to reconnect
[43:38] and that's why it's so important friends
[43:39] to have an experience or foundation
[43:42] something that angers you that you could
[43:44] reconnect up but
[43:47] i have trusted in my mercy
[43:51] and then he says my heart now we speak
[43:53] in future
[43:54] so he went he connected he passed
[43:56] i hope you see any subtle teachings here
[43:59] this is a lesson and you say but i have
[44:01] trusted in in my mercy great is thy
[44:03] faithfulness if i didn't trust any mercy
[44:05] i wasn't here as bad as i think things
[44:08] might be i'll look back and see i could
[44:10] not be here tonight if it wasn't for you
[44:13] and it's because i have trusted in thy
[44:15] mercy
[44:19] and now he speaks he he don't need to go
[44:21] back no more because he found back his
[44:23] anchor
[44:24] if you're falling down you want to find
[44:26] a place to stop falling to climb back up
[44:28] but he said my heart shall rejoice
[44:31] in thy salvation
[44:34] so he already see this situation
[44:37] resolved because he said my heart
[44:39] already rejoices in thy salvation
[44:42] meaning i know there's a way out of this
[44:44] and then he now declares to everybody so
[44:47] in other words if you had seen david 10
[44:49] minutes before and say call the doctor
[44:52] and they come back 10 minutes later you
[44:53] see it don't call the doctor because
[44:55] here you have david saying i will sing
[44:57] unto the lord
[44:59] because he had dealt bountifully with me
[45:02] how do you move from how long will thou
[45:05] forget me oh lord so i will sing unto
[45:08] the lord
[45:11] because he half past tense dealt
[45:14] bountifully with me
[45:17] so i want to encourage you tonight and
[45:19] this here is a lesson of so many
[45:22] proportions it is dealing with this is
[45:24] david and
[45:25] he actually resolved his internal
[45:28] conflict
[45:30] and the reality is i want us to look at
[45:32] this
[45:32] from a simple perspective if you had
[45:35] approached brother david
[45:38] when he was in verse one
[45:40] of his life in this chapter you would
[45:42] say boy david in a real bad mood you
[45:44] can't talk to him they even want to hear
[45:46] nobody right now david just in a state
[45:49] brother david watch now leave him alone
[45:50] now let's do it because david right now
[45:52] he
[45:53] and the david in verse 6 he is a whole
[45:55] different version of
[45:58] he's a whole different synonym
[46:01] by the time he reached verse six
[46:03] he is singing you know he not he he
[46:05] actually singing you know
[46:07] people for each other rejoicing in them
[46:10] all right
[46:11] do we have these spiritual maturity
[46:13] friends to help ourselves move from
[46:15] verse 1.6
[46:19] do we have enough
[46:21] enough built in in our internal
[46:24] combustion chambers
[46:26] to move ourselves from verse one to
[46:28] verse six it's just you and god making
[46:30] me move
[46:31] you reconciling because
[46:33] i don't know in chapter 13 what was the
[46:36] issue
[46:38] some scholars speculate because we know
[46:40] science is not chronologically written
[46:42] some speculate is what's with absalom
[46:44] okay but we don't know but what we know
[46:46] it whatever it was
[46:48] almost brought david to our halt
[46:52] and the reality is friends
[46:54] life will many times bring us to our
[46:57] halt
[46:59] with bad news
[47:00] with disappointment
[47:02] with rejection with issues
[47:05] with resentment with betrayal
[47:09] all of these are forms of conflict and
[47:11] we must learn how to deal with it
[47:16] we must become stronger at dealing with
[47:18] it
[47:19] and we must be able to come out of it as
[47:21] quickly as possible to see the situation
[47:24] because our emotions can get better of
[47:26] us
[47:28] and when we allow our emotions to take
[47:30] over we make decisions we regret
[47:33] we do things we regret we see things we
[47:36] regret we act in ways that we regret
[47:39] because we are not where we're supposed
[47:41] to be in god
[47:43] the david in verse one and two may have
[47:46] said things he didn't want to say
[47:52] anybody with me tonight
[47:55] we're dealing with dealing with conflict
[47:56] sir but this is not i know it's not if
[48:00] it's all kind of thing we can deal with
[48:02] there but but i first want to deal with
[48:03] us
[48:05] because if we could resolve the us
[48:07] then everything else had to get easier
[48:09] you know
[48:11] many times the arguments and the fussing
[48:13] and the debates in our homes with our
[48:16] families with our loved ones with
[48:17] situations we have been arguments and
[48:19] it's because it's not right with us
[48:23] and because we had a bad game we take it
[48:25] out on somebody
[48:26] because we get bad news we take it out
[48:28] on somebody we say what we shouldn't say
[48:30] and i want us to practice that
[48:32] recalibration
[48:34] and if it's one thing i want to take out
[48:36] of this is
[48:37] what stuck the most to me is lighten
[48:39] mine eyes
[48:41] because i recognize the devil's job
[48:43] is to get you to take your eyes off of
[48:45] god
[48:46] is to get you to see your flesh your
[48:48] mistakes your situations your problems
[48:50] if the devil can get a look at your
[48:52] credit card statement and your bank loan
[48:55] and what's not working out and keep your
[48:57] focus there i'm not on god's provision
[48:59] you're finishing them
[49:02] the devil job is to remind you
[49:06] lord help us tonight i trust this is an
[49:08] encouragement to us in some way tonight
[49:14] so i want to now step a little bit
[49:17] into
[49:19] a little thought a little bit about
[49:20] dealing with conflict
[49:22] and
[49:23] by no means
[49:25] is this something that i think could be
[49:27] exhausted in our session
[49:29] because
[49:30] conflict between family is real
[49:34] it could affect
[49:35] so much
[49:37] it could extend
[49:39] for years
[49:40] conflict and marriage you know but over
[49:43] a few weeks ago
[49:44] was speaking about
[49:46] tools and
[49:47] tips and different things and he talked
[49:49] about making your house a home
[49:53] and i was driving meditating and i would
[49:55] come back to what he said and say
[49:57] conflict can make your home a house
[50:00] [Laughter]
[50:02] conflict can reverse the situation you
[50:04] know you know conflict if if if if you
[50:07] know when you go home it's an argument
[50:09] waiting for you
[50:11] somebody's life slower
[50:13] sometimes you take extra gas
[50:16] you know you make a grocery stop
[50:18] because you know what waiting for you
[50:20] when you get home
[50:22] you know and if it's an unresolved issue
[50:25] you know it is something that could that
[50:27] could you know it make it a house
[50:31] make it a house
[50:32] you know so but we have to learn to deal
[50:34] with conflict and we have to understand
[50:36] that if conflict does exist what is the
[50:38] christian way and not christianizing
[50:41] jewish christianity the christ-like way
[50:44] because to be christians to be like
[50:45] christ
[50:46] how does christ want us to deal with
[50:49] conflict
[50:52] we may not agree on if it's to cook
[50:54] chicken not to cook before and and and
[50:56] and
[50:57] and you'll be surprised sometimes you
[50:59] see menu is a conflict sometimes is is
[51:02] where to buy something is here you buy
[51:03] the wrong thing sometimes it's simple
[51:05] things
[51:06] and people that talk for a day or two
[51:08] days or evening or
[51:11] you know
[51:15] and it seeps in their christian journey
[51:17] so you're driving to church you're on
[51:18] your way to church you know but nobody
[51:19] talking because everybody mad everybody
[51:22] vexed
[51:24] and you come to church and you worship
[51:25] hallelujah and when you're in church
[51:28] nobody no is conflict within the
[51:30] conflict you left it right in the car
[51:32] and the moment you go back in the car
[51:33] you pick it up right where you left it
[51:36] to continue to be conflicted anyway
[51:39] all right so it is real it is life
[51:42] and and that is family but there's
[51:44] conflict on the job
[51:46] there are people
[51:48] what monday morning is like the worst
[51:50] it's done apart from all the memes about
[51:52] monday morning work and stuff but if
[51:53] there's conflict in your job and you
[51:55] know there's somebody ought to get you
[51:57] and you're always arguing and the
[51:58] environment is toxic there's a lot to
[52:01] deal with
[52:04] it's real
[52:06] what is also sad there's conflicting
[52:08] church
[52:10] yeah
[52:11] so it's one thing you say well it's that
[52:13] marriage conflict family conflict me
[52:14] about conflict the work business
[52:16] conflict you have a competitive but it's
[52:18] conflicting church
[52:21] and we can't spend the time to go into
[52:23] it but the reality is
[52:25] when there's confliction with this
[52:27] brother not seen i tied with his brother
[52:29] and this brother take my seat and this
[52:31] sister take my spot and
[52:33] this one was clapping too loud and i if
[52:36] i could tell you the list that has
[52:37] reached me on the memo
[52:42] who has shake your hand
[52:44] who shake your hand too hard who
[52:47] i mean if it's one and and
[52:49] the list goes on it's thing that people
[52:51] make the issue the issue with
[52:54] you wanted a song who who wants to sing
[52:56] i'm special and they're getting special
[52:58] and for five years the effects they
[53:00] missed 90 percent of the content of the
[53:02] service because they're still sitting on
[53:04] because they didn't get to sing the
[53:05] special that they wanted to sing and
[53:07] because of that brother so and so who
[53:09] they told they wanted singing special
[53:11] didn't tell the pastor
[53:13] and did him and his conflict no some of
[53:16] us may smile and laugh but this is real
[53:18] you know
[53:19] and then you want to get any scriptures
[53:21] but if you have an ought and you want to
[53:22] and recognize when you're ready unwind
[53:24] the ought well
[53:26] well brother it was 10 years ago i did
[53:28] bring my guitar and it asks a player
[53:31] song and they didn't let me play it and
[53:33] since then i was looking at you funny
[53:35] and i never really let it go
[53:37] and it might sound trivial but the
[53:39] reality is that thought that's mine and
[53:42] grow and nourish them get food eliza and
[53:43] manure and get bigger and bigger and
[53:46] grow and grow and grow until when they
[53:47] come to the altar to pray they came
[53:49] praying because this get a story from 10
[53:51] years ago
[53:52] you know well let me sing yeah you
[53:54] didn't make my usher you take me from
[53:55] being asha you move a seat your movie
[53:58] fan you found one by somebody else and
[54:03] and this is in the church
[54:08] dealing with conflict
[54:10] but matthew 5 9
[54:13] says
[54:15] blessed are the peacemakers
[54:19] for they shall be called the children of
[54:21] god
[54:22] and i can't remember i remember sometime
[54:24] i don't even but overdealt with it all
[54:26] but we talk about being a peacemaker
[54:30] and how important it is to be a
[54:31] peacemaker
[54:33] you you ever meet somebody and they say
[54:34] but that person real argument everybody
[54:36] just like to argue in school there was a
[54:39] debate society
[54:41] even if they have a good point or you
[54:44] you right they still want to find you
[54:46] one thing to say but you know it's so
[54:48] and so on so on so and so
[54:50] there are people who just like friction
[54:52] like every place quiet they're
[54:54] uncomfortable
[54:56] but the christian nature
[54:58] jesus is saying blessed are the
[55:00] peacemakers for they shall be called the
[55:02] children of god are you a peacemaker in
[55:05] your job
[55:09] you know it's the opposite of a
[55:11] peacemaker i remember in school i show
[55:13] you all the way to this somebody says
[55:15] something to somebody and there's always
[55:18] always somebody in the corner you taking
[55:20] that
[55:22] you see you take in that group
[55:25] dicey people they have nothing to do
[55:27] with the situation you know
[55:29] but something happened oh
[55:31] no no no no you taking that
[55:34] and when somebody hear that enough that
[55:37] they rather people who can't fight get
[55:39] gassed up battery pack get turned on and
[55:41] they go on your beat up on them
[55:43] because somebody in the corner the
[55:45] classroom say you take taking that nah
[55:48] he can't talk to me so
[55:50] you see so so in life you have people
[55:53] who thrive they have
[55:55] they get up they they get excited when
[55:57] they see conflict
[56:00] i remember in school you always doing a
[56:03] fight breakout in school fight fight
[56:05] fight
[56:06] why why people
[56:08] was he why people don't say peace peace
[56:10] peace
[56:16] our nature we glorify this kind of
[56:18] foolishness
[56:21] but christ sent us blessed are the
[56:23] peacemakers
[56:25] for they shall be called the children of
[56:27] god can you you youth here tonight be
[56:31] called a peacemaker in your family
[56:34] is it your nature to try to pacify to
[56:37] resolve conflict
[56:39] to close off argument to say no let me
[56:41] leave it here don't let it go any
[56:43] further don't let's advance it it's not
[56:45] worth it
[56:49] do you know how many people have lost
[56:51] their lives for simple small arguments
[56:53] that just went so far out of proportion
[56:57] i remember being in secondary school and
[56:59] two fellows got into an argument over
[57:01] who had 50 cent for somebody and that
[57:03] led to a young man dying because it
[57:05] escalated and escalated escalate over 50
[57:07] cents and you ask yourself was he worth
[57:09] of a life wasn't there anybody around
[57:11] who could say okay that's enough don't
[57:13] take it further don't take it further
[57:19] but now we are challenged as believers
[57:21] because
[57:22] when a husband and wife is arguing and
[57:24] it's escalating
[57:26] both are guilty of not being peacemakers
[57:28] eh
[57:30] and all you really take is one person of
[57:32] the two to be the peacemaker you know
[57:34] because the bible says soft answer that
[57:36] stood away right
[57:39] so the reality is the concept of being a
[57:41] peacemaker among your siblings among
[57:44] friends among believers among your
[57:46] coworkers
[57:47] has a lot to do with
[57:50] with you and your response and the way
[57:52] you treat treated situations
[57:55] even when you're right and have a right
[57:57] to do something you have to discern is
[57:58] it worth it
[58:00] is it worth it picking the fight
[58:02] is it worth it having an argument about
[58:04] something that's not worth fighting for
[58:06] because if you see there are bigger
[58:08] issues to be dealt with somebody's you
[58:10] have to pick your battles friends
[58:13] anybody with me tonight
[58:15] so i want to encourage you from the
[58:17] words of the lord jesus himself
[58:19] if you take the
[58:20] approach this could be a conflict but i
[58:23] am going to be the peacemaker in this
[58:25] i'm not trying to advance the conflict
[58:28] there's always multiple ways to deal
[58:31] with situations
[58:34] and the moment conflict starts most
[58:36] people can't remain
[58:38] logical and uncontrollable your emotion
[58:40] gets warmed up
[58:42] and then god help us some of us we start
[58:45] to pull back the parts
[58:47] well it was five years ago what was the
[58:49] last time you and before you know it
[58:50] your whole history your whole biology
[58:53] your whole resume come out
[58:56] and another emotion you see things that
[58:58] you don't want to say and you can't take
[59:00] these words back
[59:02] isn't it better to just be a peacemaker
[59:05] let's go on a trust is helping you in
[59:07] some way you know this is a cause of
[59:09] practical teaching tonight
[59:12] romans 12 18 this is paul listen to this
[59:14] one
[59:16] if it be possible
[59:19] as much as light in you in other words
[59:22] if it is possible and as much as it's
[59:24] within you live peaceably with all men
[59:28] not only your friends or no this is
[59:30] romans 12 18 if you take any notes
[59:33] romans 12 18
[59:34] if it be possible
[59:36] as much as light in you in other words
[59:39] as much as is within your power
[59:42] live peacefully with all all
[59:46] all is all i always say with the bible
[59:48] all is all
[59:50] as much as possible meaning it is our
[59:53] duty it is our responsibility
[59:55] to find a peaceful way to resolve
[59:58] situations
[1:00:04] this was an encouragement to me proverbs
[1:00:06] 16 7.
[1:00:11] proverbs 16 7 and this is this is a
[1:00:14] scripture that i want to this is this is
[1:00:17] just an encouragement to me
[1:00:18] when a man's ways
[1:00:21] please the lord
[1:00:24] he make it even his enemies to be at
[1:00:27] peace with him
[1:00:30] that to me is such a scripture to live
[1:00:34] by
[1:00:34] in other words you could please god so
[1:00:37] much
[1:00:38] that god gets involved in dealing with
[1:00:40] conflict by making your enemies to have
[1:00:44] peace with you
[1:00:46] and don't tell me you don't have enemies
[1:00:48] in them
[1:00:49] because even if sam is david say don't
[1:00:51] be prs a table for me
[1:00:54] right in front of my enemies while my
[1:00:56] enemies watching you taking all the food
[1:00:58] and laying it out in their view
[1:01:03] there will always be somebody who don't
[1:01:05] like you
[1:01:08] after you live to the best of your
[1:01:09] effort there's somebody who just said
[1:01:11] take to you
[1:01:12] and it's not our job to convince
[1:01:14] everybody to be with us that's that's
[1:01:16] not it we're living for christ
[1:01:19] everybody didn't like jesus
[1:01:24] in fact they persecute him they call him
[1:01:26] walk in the names if they will do that
[1:01:28] to the perfect man who walked the earth
[1:01:30] you with your imperfection trying to
[1:01:32] please everybody
[1:01:34] with the hope that you could convince
[1:01:35] everybody that you are the best thing
[1:01:37] since life's read
[1:01:39] you have to accept the reality that
[1:01:41] somebody would say bye
[1:01:43] yeah that church money people get a
[1:01:44] church man all kind of thing they want
[1:01:46] to say there's nothing you could do
[1:01:48] about that
[1:01:49] but if it is possible as much as light
[1:01:52] in you live peacefully with all men and
[1:01:54] your goal is to please you lord so much
[1:01:57] that he make even your enemies to be at
[1:01:59] peace with you
[1:02:02] notice the scripture didn't say he will
[1:02:04] make your enemies your friend and him
[1:02:09] these status remains an amazing except
[1:02:11] they're peaceful
[1:02:15] so i want us to appreciate the reality
[1:02:18] of
[1:02:18] life god and say i will turn all your
[1:02:21] enemies into your friends he says when a
[1:02:23] man wins please the lord he will make
[1:02:26] even his enemies to be at peace with him
[1:02:29] so underscore the fact that there will
[1:02:31] always be disagreement there will always
[1:02:33] be conflict there will always be
[1:02:35] situations but there's a way that we can
[1:02:37] live through this conflict through
[1:02:39] situations through things we cannot
[1:02:41] understand and with god's help we will
[1:02:43] overcome it
[1:02:45] anybody with me
[1:02:48] ephesians 4
[1:02:51] a short teaching tonight i hope this is
[1:02:52] helping us in some way ephesians 4 verse
[1:02:56] 1 to 3 this is paul
[1:02:59] i here for the prisoner of the lord
[1:03:00] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[1:03:03] vocation where it you are called in
[1:03:06] other words besieged means to beg
[1:03:08] so he's begging you that you work you
[1:03:11] walk worthy in other words that your
[1:03:13] life your talk your the way you're moved
[1:03:15] the way you speak the way you live is
[1:03:18] worthy of the vocation you're called to
[1:03:20] an office and there's an expectation of
[1:03:21] that office there's an expectation of
[1:03:23] your attitude the way you use your words
[1:03:25] your whatever wherever you're called and
[1:03:28] he qualifies that worthiness of the
[1:03:30] vocation with all loneliness
[1:03:34] and meekness
[1:03:36] with long suffering
[1:03:39] forbearing one another in love that's
[1:03:41] like tolerating one another in love
[1:03:44] endeavoring endeavouring is the active
[1:03:47] process of working to keep the unity of
[1:03:51] the spirit in the bond of peace
[1:03:54] nowhere in here speaks about you trying
[1:03:57] to find conflict with people
[1:03:59] conflict with brethren conflict with
[1:04:01] anybody at all it is all about
[1:04:03] loneliness
[1:04:04] and meekness and long-suffering for
[1:04:08] bearing one another endeavoring to keep
[1:04:10] the unity of the spirit in the bond of
[1:04:14] peace
[1:04:16] is this helping anybody tonight
[1:04:18] i'm not going to be too much longer
[1:04:20] trust this is helping you in some way
[1:04:22] let's go
[1:04:24] now we're going gonna take a few from
[1:04:26] the book of proverbs
[1:04:27] you know robert has been speaking a lot
[1:04:29] about wisdom knowledge and understanding
[1:04:32] and i know we did a bible study in that
[1:04:34] some months ago
[1:04:39] proverbs
[1:04:41] 17
[1:04:42] 14.
[1:04:46] proverbs 17 14
[1:04:48] and this will help us in family it will
[1:04:51] help us in business and help us in life
[1:04:54] proverbs 17 14. if you have it let's go
[1:04:57] the beginning of strife
[1:04:59] is as when one lettered out water
[1:05:04] therefore
[1:05:06] leave off contention before it be
[1:05:09] meddled with
[1:05:11] i want to read it in the amplified
[1:05:13] so the beginning of a strife
[1:05:16] is like letting out water as a small
[1:05:18] break in a dam
[1:05:20] first it trickles
[1:05:22] and then it gushes this is the amplifier
[1:05:24] i'm reading therefore abandon the
[1:05:27] quarrel before it breaks out and tempers
[1:05:30] explode
[1:05:33] in other words nip it to the bottom
[1:05:38] so if you're taking notes
[1:05:40] and you want to change your environment
[1:05:41] in your home change your mind behind
[1:05:43] your family change by within your job
[1:05:45] just just try jesus
[1:05:48] try the scripture all right before it
[1:05:51] gets bigger
[1:05:52] treat it when it's small in other words
[1:05:55] the wisdom of sorrow by saying the
[1:05:57] beginning of a strife in other words
[1:05:59] every stripe have a beginning that we're
[1:06:01] saying here the beginning of a strife
[1:06:03] every strike have a beginning
[1:06:04] every arguments that are smaller no
[1:06:08] i see people argue about food and wood
[1:06:10] kitchens before
[1:06:13] simple thing you know
[1:06:15] who moved my food in the kitchen he work
[1:06:17] off his kitchen who moved my food
[1:06:22] nobody answer who move up and before you
[1:06:24] know it is big argument thing could be
[1:06:26] flying in the office uber and it was a
[1:06:29] cleaner the gesture
[1:06:30] fitting nobody are moving you know and
[1:06:34] it's you and an accusation and before
[1:06:36] it's a whole issue
[1:06:38] but every stripe
[1:06:40] every stripe you know
[1:06:42] the beginning of a stripe is as when one
[1:06:44] letter of water it started with a
[1:06:46] trickle
[1:06:47] and it could turn into a dam
[1:06:50] and before it break out and explode so
[1:06:52] solomon is saying here before the
[1:06:54] argument the next time you have a
[1:06:56] conversation
[1:06:58] think
[1:06:59] is is this going to be a strife because
[1:07:01] let me cut it here
[1:07:03] let's go
[1:07:04] proverbs 18
[1:07:06] verse 13.
[1:07:11] proverbs 18 verse 13.
[1:07:13] he that answered a matter
[1:07:16] before he heard it
[1:07:18] it is folly and shame
[1:07:21] on to him
[1:07:23] so how much times we just end up arguing
[1:07:26] and then after you hold out you
[1:07:27] recognize you know what
[1:07:29] when we really understand situation we
[1:07:30] really didn't need to really argue you
[1:07:32] know
[1:07:33] because i didn't really um
[1:07:37] really understand i didn't really hear
[1:07:38] the problem
[1:07:40] so the whole argument all your blood
[1:07:43] pressure went up
[1:07:45] your throat red
[1:07:47] you're you're you have to drink water
[1:07:49] you think i mean when anyone finish with
[1:07:51] wine dung and you come down and the
[1:07:52] battery is so bad can i wait a minute
[1:07:54] you know it was i misunderstood what he
[1:07:56] probably wants to know do you know the
[1:07:58] phone is embarrassing
[1:08:00] your friend is embarrassing after you
[1:08:02] are you on your sweatshirt nothing about
[1:08:03] that you throw a whole time trauma with
[1:08:05] a non-issue
[1:08:11] and it's simple ways you know like
[1:08:12] sometimes somebody might misplace
[1:08:14] something in your house
[1:08:15] and i say karen you move
[1:08:18] whatever it is you move my tie
[1:08:21] no you move
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:28] there's only two of us in the house
[1:08:30] anytime you know it's
[1:08:31] i don't take a movie time so it'd have
[1:08:34] to be you movie time
[1:08:35] i'll give you an example and when and
[1:08:38] when he when he marked bus the tie still
[1:08:41] in the car you know did nobody move it
[1:08:46] and after you get your energy up on up
[1:08:48] on it you reckon where it's not
[1:08:50] all that was unnecessary you know if
[1:08:52] you're gone check where the tie was in
[1:08:53] the first place and see where you left
[1:08:54] it right where you left it you wouldn't
[1:08:55] even be having this but when you retrace
[1:08:58] sometimes i sure you have been an
[1:09:00] argument i recognize you know i didn't
[1:09:02] have to argue or i didn't have all the
[1:09:03] information oh if i didn't really pause
[1:09:06] to really analyze it before i take a
[1:09:08] position to take up a fighting stance i
[1:09:10] could avoid this whole argument
[1:09:13] so the bible says he who answers before
[1:09:15] he hears the facts it is fully unashamed
[1:09:17] to him is he amplified
[1:09:19] let's go
[1:09:21] proverbs 18 verse 17.
[1:09:26] and on this one i really so so i want to
[1:09:28] read it first proverbs 18 and verse 17.
[1:09:31] he that is first in his own cause
[1:09:35] seemed just
[1:09:37] but his neighbor commit and search at
[1:09:39] him
[1:09:40] in other words in the amplified the
[1:09:42] first one to plead his case seems right
[1:09:46] until another comes and cross examines
[1:09:48] him
[1:09:50] friends all that's in the bible in him
[1:09:52] so how much time you get in the argument
[1:09:56] with only one side of the story
[1:09:59] that is what this is here
[1:10:01] you're ready to fight you're ready to
[1:10:02] fight you're ready to fight you're
[1:10:03] huffing on your husband
[1:10:04] you're all up in because you're here one
[1:10:06] side and you even wait
[1:10:08] to hear the other side of the story
[1:10:10] because if you take time to listen now
[1:10:12] you can properly wait first before you
[1:10:15] take an opposition
[1:10:19] and the bible is saying the first person
[1:10:21] to come to you with a matter does seem
[1:10:23] right because the story coming to you
[1:10:25] first
[1:10:26] some children know that manipulation
[1:10:27] game so well
[1:10:29] they run to daddy or mummy because the
[1:10:32] first person because daddy won't be here
[1:10:33] in this world
[1:10:34] johnny taught this talking to me and you
[1:10:37] that's the first time you hear it you're
[1:10:39] ready to respond without even asking
[1:10:41] johnny well johnny what happened
[1:10:45] you done blazing
[1:10:47] suzanne left right and center
[1:10:51] or blazing johnny or every it's mayhem
[1:10:54] but you only have one side of your story
[1:10:58] so even the bible given you how to be
[1:11:01] just and mature in these matters now you
[1:11:03] know
[1:11:09] so and i really admire and i was going
[1:11:10] to say it one thing i see with brad
[1:11:12] robert
[1:11:13] many times he will listen to something
[1:11:14] and
[1:11:15] before you take a positional act you
[1:11:16] want to know the other side of the story
[1:11:19] you say i'll get back to you
[1:11:21] i'll get back to you because you want to
[1:11:23] know the other side before you take a
[1:11:24] position everybody just run in one side
[1:11:27] you could end up into so much problems
[1:11:30] and sometimes people miscommunicate
[1:11:31] things or they give you partial
[1:11:33] information so they child and say well
[1:11:35] daddy johnny hit me and that's the only
[1:11:38] part
[1:11:38] here and they're going and beat johnny
[1:11:41] when johnny finally come down you say
[1:11:42] well johnny well well what happened well
[1:11:44] david hitman's listening but you never
[1:11:46] david never seen hit first in him
[1:11:48] he does bring the part of it that is
[1:11:50] appropriate for what he
[1:11:52] needs
[1:11:54] let's go
[1:11:56] proverbs 18 19.
[1:12:04] and this is deeper because i find
[1:12:06] sometimes
[1:12:08] when we act impulsively
[1:12:11] in our emotion in our feelings
[1:12:15] we sometimes don't understand what i
[1:12:16] call these second order consequences you
[1:12:19] ripple effect of our behaviors
[1:12:21] and solomon is saying here this is a
[1:12:24] cautionary warning a brother offended
[1:12:28] is harder to be won than a strong city
[1:12:33] and their contentions are like the bars
[1:12:35] of a castle
[1:12:37] so in other words when you end up in a
[1:12:40] conflict with a brother
[1:12:42] conflict with a sister
[1:12:45] sometimes it's harder to patch it back
[1:12:47] up
[1:12:48] and the work to patch it back up or to
[1:12:52] win back the relationship
[1:12:54] solomon could be as hard as a strong
[1:12:57] city
[1:12:58] because you have done unnecessary damage
[1:13:01] to a relationship
[1:13:03] because you created a conflict or
[1:13:05] pursued a conflict that either did not
[1:13:07] need to happen or any emotions you said
[1:13:10] or did the wrong thing
[1:13:16] let us let us think on these things
[1:13:18] friends
[1:13:19] proverbs 23 i'm almost done proverbs 20
[1:13:22] verse 3.
[1:13:25] it is an honor
[1:13:28] for a man to cease from strife but every
[1:13:31] fool will be meddling
[1:13:35] i'll say it one more time and really
[1:13:37] amplify it it is an honor for a man to
[1:13:40] cease from strife
[1:13:42] but every fool will be meddling and
[1:13:44] strike whenever you see strife is
[1:13:45] conflict right it is an honor for a man
[1:13:49] to cease from strife
[1:13:51] but every fool will be meddling so
[1:13:53] solomon is actually honorable
[1:13:56] for you to avoid conflict
[1:13:58] but
[1:13:59] hand always in the middle of backhand as
[1:14:01] you see here in trinidad they're the
[1:14:02] oils in the middle of something
[1:14:04] and something's not part of you know
[1:14:05] something is is known
[1:14:07] you know they say known to the police
[1:14:10] the people with conflict known to be in
[1:14:11] conflict they're always in an argument
[1:14:14] listen to the amplified
[1:14:16] it is an honor for a man to keep away
[1:14:18] from strife
[1:14:20] by handling situations with thoughtful
[1:14:23] foresight
[1:14:25] but any fool will start or quarrel
[1:14:28] without regard for the consequences
[1:14:33] anybody with me
[1:14:34] just a few more we're done
[1:14:36] dealing with conflict through the
[1:14:37] scriptures see the position
[1:14:40] so when you see a believer always
[1:14:42] ranting and raving and is this and is he
[1:14:44] government and is he disc and is he king
[1:14:46] and is he boss and is he man
[1:14:48] is that a christian behavior
[1:14:50] is is this an alignment
[1:14:54] is this an alignment with what you think
[1:14:56] christ wants to see our behaviors
[1:15:00] and i'm fighting for the lord you're
[1:15:02] fighting for which lord
[1:15:07] matthew 5. we're going into new
[1:15:09] testament now before we get ready to
[1:15:11] close out is this helping anybody
[1:15:13] tonight to reframe
[1:15:15] how you talk how you approach situations
[1:15:17] thinking before you act we know you know
[1:15:19] they tell us in promise you don't think
[1:15:20] before you speak thank you for your act
[1:15:21] but the impulsiveness now look at his
[1:15:24] spiritual sense of it now
[1:15:26] because conflict now let's take it in
[1:15:28] matthew 5 verse 23
[1:15:31] therefore
[1:15:33] if thou bring thy gift to the altar
[1:15:38] and there
[1:15:40] are the pointer there
[1:15:42] rememberist
[1:15:44] that thy brother had ought against thee
[1:15:48] now listen carefully here
[1:15:50] this is not even you have ought against
[1:15:53] them
[1:15:57] therefore if thou bring
[1:16:00] thy gift to the altar
[1:16:01] and their remembrance that thy brother
[1:16:03] have ought against thee and that thought
[1:16:06] also just means an issue an unresolved
[1:16:09] issue with thee
[1:16:11] leave there thy gift before the altar
[1:16:15] because god had taken it
[1:16:17] god don't want that kind of offering
[1:16:20] in other words
[1:16:21] don't come and bring it with conflict
[1:16:23] and you know you have conflict he said
[1:16:26] leave there that i give before the altar
[1:16:28] so you say well well i hear all a thing
[1:16:29] with conflict and god is saying resolve
[1:16:31] your issues
[1:16:33] before you're coming i'm bringing you
[1:16:34] alter
[1:16:35] in other words i don't want you trying
[1:16:37] to pray and offer your offering and you
[1:16:40] know you have matters you need to close
[1:16:42] off and you left stuff in a way that
[1:16:44] shouldn't have been left your settings
[1:16:46] make it right
[1:16:48] leave there thy gift before the altar
[1:16:51] and go thy way
[1:16:53] first be reconciled to thy brother in
[1:16:56] other words close the gap on the
[1:16:58] conflict
[1:16:59] and then come and offer thy gift because
[1:17:02] your gift is a requirement of the
[1:17:03] gardener but there's a way there's an
[1:17:05] approach
[1:17:07] oh hallelujah there's an approach to god
[1:17:10] and as part of the approach to god is an
[1:17:12] approach that is a life of peacefulness
[1:17:16] a life without unresolved issues
[1:17:18] a life that if you know it is a matter
[1:17:20] to be reserved treat it in a certain way
[1:17:23] you're not treating any viking vaccine
[1:17:24] there's a way to choose with it
[1:17:33] i just want to read that in the
[1:17:34] amplified quickly
[1:17:36] so if you are presenting your offering
[1:17:38] at the altar and while there you
[1:17:40] remember that your brother has something
[1:17:43] such as a grievance or legitimate
[1:17:45] complaint against you
[1:17:48] so maybe you did something
[1:17:50] so sometimes we use the word ought and
[1:17:51] don't understand what an ought really
[1:17:53] means
[1:17:55] remember that your brother is something
[1:17:56] sort of a grievance or somebody
[1:17:57] complaining about you have an issue with
[1:17:59] you and you know maybe you hurt somebody
[1:18:01] a certain way or maybe they
[1:18:02] misunderstand you or maybe you had an
[1:18:04] argument
[1:18:07] leave your offering there you also go
[1:18:08] first make listen listen to the words
[1:18:10] make peace with your brother
[1:18:12] and then come and present your offering
[1:18:17] i challenge you tonight
[1:18:19] let us look at our relationships as we
[1:18:21] look at our conversations let me look at
[1:18:24] our attitudes people must see christ
[1:18:26] living in us
[1:18:28] this is the message you know
[1:18:31] i don't care how much books do you have
[1:18:33] how much tips you have if you can't live
[1:18:34] peacefully if you can't live a life that
[1:18:36] is the virtue of god that we can see
[1:18:38] sweetness and humility that's the
[1:18:40] thunder the devil is not a book it's not
[1:18:43] a tape there's not no hindi message is
[1:18:46] the lie that's lived that confuses the
[1:18:48] devil because you go contrary to the
[1:18:50] expectation you're supposed to fly off
[1:18:52] your hand though but you didn't do it
[1:18:54] and they can't understand why because
[1:18:56] you're so grounded in the revelation of
[1:18:58] the mystery of god and these scriptures
[1:19:00] are real to you that when you could say
[1:19:02] something look at jesus they were taking
[1:19:04] him to calvary and he said that a word
[1:19:07] he didn't say a word
[1:19:09] they beat him when he uttered not a word
[1:19:11] for some of us i have taken that
[1:19:14] we're quick to respond
[1:19:16] we we we in a minute but look at jesus
[1:19:19] let's go almost done
[1:19:21] a few more minutes
[1:19:25] now
[1:19:26] matthew 18.
[1:19:29] and this is now carving now closer to
[1:19:31] home become another closer to home
[1:19:33] closer to personal one-on-one issues now
[1:19:36] and i want us to appreciate the fact
[1:19:38] that in scripture
[1:19:39] god given us every way to deal with
[1:19:41] every situation and that's why i say the
[1:19:43] bible is the best book on marriage the
[1:19:46] best book on living a holy life the best
[1:19:48] book on business the best book on
[1:19:51] anything you need to know is in the
[1:19:53] scriptures
[1:19:54] because god gave us all things the bible
[1:19:56] says pertaining to life and godliness
[1:19:59] so you want to run a successful business
[1:20:01] it's in the scripture you want to
[1:20:02] accelerate in your career it's in the
[1:20:04] scripture you want to have good family
[1:20:05] relation it's in the scripture you want
[1:20:07] to save money it's in the scripture you
[1:20:09] want to live healthy it's in the
[1:20:10] scripture
[1:20:13] no if you follow the formula
[1:20:17] the formula works
[1:20:19] so listen to the formula and
[1:20:21] when you understand this formula
[1:20:24] you will recognize because of the way
[1:20:26] god is when you operate outside of his
[1:20:28] formula you're running into problems so
[1:20:30] listen to how god says moreover
[1:20:34] if thy brother shall trespass against
[1:20:36] thee so your brother offend you do
[1:20:38] something this is sin whatever it is go
[1:20:42] and tell him his fault between thee and
[1:20:44] him alone
[1:20:48] first step of the formula
[1:20:50] so you have an offense somebody here
[1:20:52] yeah i say well
[1:20:55] you know what i do now
[1:20:56] facebook
[1:20:58] whatsapp stories haters will always be
[1:21:01] there
[1:21:02] no loyalty
[1:21:04] and
[1:21:05] before you know it it taken two minutes
[1:21:07] to figure out well so and sort of a beef
[1:21:08] with so and so
[1:21:12] or you're going to tell all your friends
[1:21:14] boy yeah see what he do and this way do
[1:21:16] me up to no you haven't spoken to the
[1:21:18] brother yet

[1:21:24] brother shall trespass against thee
[1:21:27] go and tell him is fall between thee and
[1:21:29] him alone the issue doesn't that there
[1:21:31] are nobody else how come tom and jenny
[1:21:34] and sister jane and sister
[1:21:36] i don't call it nobody else is the judy
[1:21:38] and i who are calling names no nobody
[1:21:40] how come they're all aware of the
[1:21:42] trespass
[1:21:44] and the person who is involved in
[1:21:45] trespassing
[1:21:47] you you haven't even had a conversation
[1:21:48] with them yet hey brother i don't know
[1:21:50] if you realize but you certainly kind of
[1:21:52] offend me i just want to kind of make
[1:21:54] sure that you understand that i already
[1:21:56] want to be at peace and i will tell you

[1:22:07] that is that and that what he that is
[1:22:09] immature behavior that is prime minister

[1:22:16] saying here you better say if i brought
[1:22:17] offend you is between you and them if
[1:22:19] that feels if he shall hear thee listen
[1:22:22] thou has gained my brother
[1:22:24] you know as powerful it is if you go to
[1:22:26] somebody's listen

[1:22:29] you know about me and stuff and maybe
[1:22:31] you misunderstood maybe i am missing and
[1:22:33] said but let me just clear it up okay
[1:22:34] great it over no problem god bless you
[1:22:36] and and that dead right there dead right
[1:22:39] there
[1:22:40] the bible said you have gained a brother
[1:22:42] because most of us the opposite is you
[1:22:44] blast them up
[1:22:46] you light them up
[1:22:48] first response
[1:22:49] even in the working world friends if hr
[1:22:53] getting involved in something there's
[1:22:54] something called progressive discipline
[1:22:58] there's a viewable warning there's
[1:22:59] written warning there's suspension
[1:23:01] people you don't have two minutes
[1:23:03] we're terminating too fast enough we
[1:23:06] turn it in too fast
[1:23:08] so even god has a process he said listen
[1:23:10] go one on one is you one on one
[1:23:13] if that brother sister hears you you're
[1:23:15] closing matter perfect you have gained a
[1:23:18] brother
[1:23:20] the matter is always dead
[1:23:22] we're 16 but if he will not hear thee
[1:23:26] so that i will you tried you you're
[1:23:28] following the process you know what
[1:23:30] matters went to court and fell apart in
[1:23:32] court because the process wasn't
[1:23:33] followed so you want to know do you
[1:23:34] process this due process
[1:23:36] if step one don't work
[1:23:39] if he will not hear thee
[1:23:41] then take the iphone go to whatsapp and
[1:23:45] send to facebook message and light up it
[1:23:47] that is not what i'm reading here
[1:23:51] if he was not heavy then take with the
[1:23:54] one or two more
[1:23:56] one or two not three we are read three
[1:23:58] yet we are reached we have five yet
[1:24:00] where it's 10 yet where is 15 people in
[1:24:03] the lupine what's going on here yet
[1:24:06] if he will not hear thee then take with
[1:24:08] me one or two more that in the amount of
[1:24:11] two or three witnesses every word may be
[1:24:14] established so now there's a paper trail
[1:24:17] in the heavenlies of use following the
[1:24:20] process
[1:24:21] boy i see but a mic and that brother had
[1:24:24] a little issue but i might talk to the
[1:24:25] brother you better hear listen so about
[1:24:27] a mic call but are you i'm an isaac and
[1:24:30] he went and talked to him that's what he
[1:24:31] just writing on
[1:24:33] and if they reason with him to show him
[1:24:35] that that approach he took wasn't right
[1:24:38] and after by the michael brother human
[1:24:39] rights i talked to him he barely said
[1:24:41] when he was 17. if he shall neglect to
[1:24:44] hear them
[1:24:46] tell it unto the church
[1:24:49] but if he neglect to hear the church now
[1:24:52] the church don't get involved so you see
[1:24:54] god actually say it's a system to deal
[1:24:56] with issues
[1:24:58] so if one and one they can't resolve it
[1:25:00] if bringing a two witnesses carries over
[1:25:02] if the church is now saying my brother
[1:25:04] this is not the be this is not the
[1:25:06] conduct
[1:25:07] if the church
[1:25:10] if he neglected here he should let him
[1:25:11] be unto thee as a heathen and republican
[1:25:16] last scripture i believe
[1:25:20] close last scripture i believe here
[1:25:23] james 4 1.
[1:25:26] we close up with this
[1:25:29] from whence come wars
[1:25:32] and fightings among you
[1:25:36] so this is now what justin believer is
[1:25:37] they're from whence come wars
[1:25:41] and fightings among you
[1:25:44] come there not hence even of your lust
[1:25:46] that war in your members
[1:25:50] ye lust and have not ye kill and desire
[1:25:52] to have and cannot obtain fight and war
[1:25:55] yet you have not because you ask not
[1:25:58] he asked and received not because he
[1:26:00] asked abyss that you may consume it upon
[1:26:04] your lust
[1:26:05] so i want to read that those three
[1:26:07] verses in the amplified so you get a
[1:26:10] little more clarity on what the bible is
[1:26:12] saying here
[1:26:14] what leads to the unending quarrels and
[1:26:16] conflicts among you
[1:26:20] do they not come from your hedonistic
[1:26:23] desires that wage war in your bodily
[1:26:26] members fighting for control over you
[1:26:29] and now he goes into what he's referring
[1:26:31] to you are jealous and covet what others
[1:26:34] have
[1:26:35] and your lust goes unfulfilled so you
[1:26:38] murder
[1:26:39] you are envious and cannot obtain the
[1:26:41] object of your envy so you fight and
[1:26:43] battle
[1:26:45] you do not have because you do not ask
[1:26:47] it of god
[1:26:49] you ask god for something and do not
[1:26:52] receive it because you ask with wrong
[1:26:54] motives
[1:26:56] out of selfishness or with an
[1:26:58] unrighteous agenda
[1:27:00] so that when you get what you want you
[1:27:02] may spend it on your hedonistic desires
[1:27:06] so this is how i like to know this
[1:27:09] understanding of what causes conflict
[1:27:11] well i don't like you because really
[1:27:12] actually deep down you don't like you
[1:27:14] have a car a new car and you again you
[1:27:16] can help
[1:27:18] you may not want to admit it
[1:27:20] but
[1:27:21] the bible says jealousy is coveted these
[1:27:23] are the issues that at war so what's
[1:27:26] really happening is your internal
[1:27:28] conflict and i'm closing with this
[1:27:30] became an external conflict
[1:27:34] you couldn't resolve that's what the
[1:27:36] bible say you know
[1:27:37] what leads
[1:27:39] so this is what a tying now that first
[1:27:41] part so if david couldn't resolve his
[1:27:43] internal issues it manifested if you can
[1:27:46] resolve your issues you take it out on
[1:27:48] your chairing dignity in your family
[1:27:49] take it out on your co-workers you take
[1:27:51] it out on the church and suddenly the
[1:27:52] pastor and it should and it's really
[1:27:54] your internal issues your unresolved
[1:27:56] issues that is your internal conflict
[1:27:59] that became an external issue and
[1:28:01] manifested
[1:28:03] many times people beat up people and
[1:28:05] recognize well it's really not the
[1:28:07] person they beat up they had the issue
[1:28:08] with you know
[1:28:10] but it was pent up energy and and issues
[1:28:13] that it was just it's like a pressure
[1:28:15] cooker explode
[1:28:16] it was just the last show
[1:28:18] you were trying to go into a taxi and
[1:28:20] you stopped the taxi and said when
[1:28:21] you're 20 and you get so back you're not
[1:28:23] going to manually in the taxi
[1:28:25] and it's not really you've actually taxi
[1:28:27] manual but this whole week you feel like
[1:28:28] people jumping in front of the line
[1:28:30] and this is just the last man to jump
[1:28:32] before the line so your internal
[1:28:34] conflict about line jumping now manifest
[1:28:36] itself in one man unconscious and you
[1:28:39] now in the politician trying to explain
[1:28:41] if you knew this man i didn't know the
[1:28:43] man and then when you really resolve it
[1:28:44] you recognize is the whole week back up
[1:28:47] on you and you lose control
[1:28:50] so here it is saying what leads to the
[1:28:52] quarrels and the conflicts
[1:28:54] do not come from your desires that wage
[1:28:57] war in your members
[1:28:59] so the root cause of the conflicts don't
[1:29:02] be identified enough
[1:29:06] because if you can't wait for something
[1:29:08] and it's really impatience is what is on
[1:29:10] the inside then the impatience manifests
[1:29:12] itself and when you reach home and the
[1:29:14] food already at the economy where they
[1:29:15] put it ready why do food already and and
[1:29:18] a situation that could have just be well
[1:29:19] hey you didn't the pressure cooker
[1:29:21] wasn't working or this wasn't okay you
[1:29:22] had to take time to hear that yes you
[1:29:24] know so your internal issues now become
[1:29:26] an external issue and before you know it
[1:29:27] the port gone flying you fool's gone
[1:29:29] flying no you really have no food
[1:29:34] anybody
[1:29:35] with me but here we see that connection
[1:29:37] between the internal conflict becoming a
[1:29:39] similar conflict i am done for tonight
[1:29:43] i trust that in some ways something was
[1:29:45] said tonight that you could really look
[1:29:47] at your internal conflict
[1:29:49] and relook at your external issues
[1:29:52] because they are real and we have to be
[1:29:54] victorious there is
[1:29:56] a right way there is a better way there
[1:30:00] is a perfect way shall we pray heavenly
[1:30:03] father we thank you tonight for this
[1:30:04] session lord
[1:30:07] through your scriptures as we look at
[1:30:08] this
[1:30:09] theme of conflict and lord when we
[1:30:12] reflect and truly reflect we can realize
[1:30:15] how many situations we could have
[1:30:17] avoided
[1:30:18] how many things could have been
[1:30:19] different
[1:30:20] have we taken a different approach
[1:30:22] had we stopped to listen to think to
[1:30:24] reflect to pray to ponder
[1:30:27] to wear the sides of a situation before
[1:30:29] getting involved
[1:30:30] how we allowed our internal conflicts to
[1:30:33] become external
[1:30:35] our own internal resolve unresolved
[1:30:37] issues
[1:30:38] manifesting themselves
[1:30:41] lord we are so grateful that you lean in
[1:30:43] your word that
[1:30:45] lord blessed are the peacemakers
[1:30:47] this is something you want to see
[1:30:50] he said with all that is within us if
[1:30:51] it's within our possibility and our
[1:30:53] strength live peacefully with all men
[1:30:56] you tell us if we have unresolved
[1:30:58] conflict we can't even present our gift
[1:31:00] at the altar oh god help us
[1:31:04] to become united
[1:31:06] not because of rotor because of letter
[1:31:08] lord because of love
[1:31:10] your love for peace
[1:31:12] your love for purity
[1:31:14] your love for us to live a certain kind
[1:31:16] of way in a world that's dark and
[1:31:19] violent and evil
[1:31:20] where people say what they want whether
[1:31:22] they have the liberty to
[1:31:24] to to declare how they think things
[1:31:26] should be we are challenged to speak the
[1:31:29] way you would speak
[1:31:31] say the things that you would see
[1:31:33] help us to be subject to your holy
[1:31:36] spirit father
[1:31:37] lord that we could be reflections of
[1:31:39] your majesty of your glory as a prophet
[1:31:42] said ambassadors be gods advertisement
[1:31:45] boards
[1:31:46] help us father that we not lose our
[1:31:48] tempers
[1:31:49] and get caught up in emotions and lash
[1:31:52] out unnecessarily but lord we work
[1:31:55] towards peace
[1:31:56] and not having conflict

[1:32:03] in this room the bond between parents
[1:32:05] and children children and parents the
[1:32:07] bond between siblings
[1:32:09] lord may you strengthen the believers
[1:32:11] lord may you root out conflict may you
[1:32:14] root out all 10 grudges
[1:32:16] may you help us on our jobs
[1:32:18] lord in this world we live in where we

[1:32:24] compasses and different moral values and
[1:32:27] these things father a lot is still walk
[1:32:29] in that world that where your bible said
