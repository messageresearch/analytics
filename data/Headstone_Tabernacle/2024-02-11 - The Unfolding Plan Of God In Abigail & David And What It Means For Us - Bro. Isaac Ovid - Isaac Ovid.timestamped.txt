[1:00:21] scripture just want to read one portion
[1:00:25] of scripture this
[1:00:27] morning we have quite a bit we're going
[1:00:29] to spend some time in today but just
[1:00:31] want to open as a foundation reading
[1:00:35] first
[1:00:37] Samuel
[1:00:39] 25 and reading verse
[1:00:42] one 1st Samuel 25 and verse
[1:00:46] one and Samuel
[1:00:49] died Samuel
[1:00:52] died and all the Israelites were
[1:00:55] gathered together and lamented
[1:00:58] him and buried him in his house at
[1:01:03] Rama and David
[1:01:05] arose and went down to the
[1:01:09] Wilderness of Paran may the Lord add a
[1:01:12] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:01:15] may be
[1:01:17] seated certainly a great privilege to be
[1:01:19] in the house of the Lord this
[1:01:21] morning and to be able to sing his
[1:01:23] praises
[1:01:25] and for God to speak to us through song
[1:01:28] Through the ministry of music and
[1:01:30] through the ministry of his word and how
[1:01:33] blessed we are to be called out in such
[1:01:35] a time as this we see the world this
[1:01:38] morning I had to go go to the Baba and I
[1:01:41] saw three men walk in the street with a
[1:01:44] look in their eyes and the Baba had just
[1:01:46] pulled up and he didn't come out his car
[1:01:48] he say I waited for them guys to pass
[1:01:49] before I come out on my car say yeah
[1:01:52] those those guys have a spirit upon them
[1:01:54] came
[1:01:55] that's demon possession right there
[1:01:56] walking a certain way they the spirit
[1:01:58] they have no idea what Spirit they're
[1:02:00] dealing with but this Spirit of Carnival
[1:02:02] and banal and all these things it's
[1:02:04] demonic forces that take over people
[1:02:06] where they lose control and it's evil
[1:02:09] spirits that we're dealing with in in
[1:02:11] this time so don't be naive that what
[1:02:13] might seem innocent what might seem
[1:02:15] simple is really spiritual forces at
[1:02:18] work that you cannot see with a naked
[1:02:19] eyes so we want to be vigilant we want
[1:02:21] to be mindful we want to be sensitive to
[1:02:24] what's happening in this season to know
[1:02:26] that de the devil is mad he is he's
[1:02:28] angry because he knows his time is short
[1:02:31] he is not a fool he knows his time is
[1:02:33] short he he sees a change taking place
[1:02:35] in you he doesn't yet understand who you
[1:02:37] are or what you will become but he knows
[1:02:39] there's a change there something that's
[1:02:41] different he felt it when Jesus was on
[1:02:43] the earth and he's feeling it again it's
[1:02:45] a reminder to him of when that great
[1:02:47] prophet priest and king walk the earth
[1:02:49] there's a different people in the land
[1:02:51] who under their messenger are about to
[1:02:53] become the final voice to the final age
[1:02:56] he knows his time is up he knows that
[1:02:58] there's a plan because every time the
[1:03:00] devil thought he could stop it God found
[1:03:02] a way to make it anybody with me this
[1:03:05] morning every time the devil thought he
[1:03:07] could stop something God always had a
[1:03:09] way it's been God's way to always find a
[1:03:12] way God always has a provided way we are
[1:03:14] here this morning because of God's
[1:03:16] provided way can the church amen and for
[1:03:20] this we give God praise we give God
[1:03:22] praise when we feel good we pray God
[1:03:24] praise when we don't feel good we give
[1:03:26] God praise when we feel happy and we're
[1:03:28] supposed to give God praise when we feel
[1:03:30] sad the Bible says in all things in
[1:03:32] everything give him thanks Hallelujah so
[1:03:35] I don't care what's going on right now
[1:03:37] in everything you could find a reason to
[1:03:39] give God thanks in the good times praise
[1:03:42] His name in The Bad Times do the same in
[1:03:45] everything give the king of King all all
[1:03:48] of the thanks thank him in your pain
[1:03:51] thank him in your struggle thank him
[1:03:53] when you're upset thank him when you
[1:03:55] don't understand thank him when you
[1:03:57] don't feel like thanking him you thank
[1:03:59] him anyhow thank him when you have money
[1:04:01] in your bank thank him when you don't
[1:04:02] have money in the bank thank him when
[1:04:04] there's food on your table and when
[1:04:06] there's no food you thank him anyhow
[1:04:08] because there's no condition there's no
[1:04:10] exception there's no rule that allows
[1:04:12] you to do anything else because we thank
[1:04:14] God because he is God and without him
[1:04:17] and beside him there's not else but
[1:04:19] without him we are nothing this morning
[1:04:21] can the Church of the Living God say
[1:04:23] Amen
[1:04:30] falling in sin doesn't change the need
[1:04:32] to thank him making a mistake doesn't
[1:04:35] change a need to thank him oh you don't
[1:04:37] hear me this morning hallelujah
[1:04:40] hallelujah there's a difference between
[1:04:41] praise and worship worship him because

[1:04:48] with your transgression he'll deal with
[1:04:50] your iniquity but let us not remove who
[1:04:53] he is he is God uh he is I am that I am

[1:04:58] life he's the door he is my rock he is
[1:05:01] my shield he is my buckler he is my
[1:05:04] Fortress he is my deliverer and in him

[1:07:27] means for us and I really want to have a
[1:07:30] conversation this morning because in
[1:07:32] what we are about a going through
[1:07:33] there's a lot it speaks to marriage it
[1:07:38] speaks to
[1:07:39] relationship it speaks to dealing with
[1:07:41] struggles it speaks to dealing with
[1:07:44] depression and frustration and breaking
[1:07:47] points you know everybody has a Breaking
[1:07:49] Point
[1:07:52] right the best of us
[1:07:55] us have a Breaking
[1:07:58] Point
[1:07:59] hallu take the simplest person and put
[1:08:03] them under a lot of
[1:08:07] pressure after a while
[1:08:10] yes that person will
[1:08:12] reach their breaking
[1:08:15] point and if you don't know how to deal
[1:08:17] with reaching your Breaking
[1:08:20] Point you're going to get into
[1:08:22] problems
[1:08:25] so we're going to talk a little bit
[1:08:26] about it today but to lay a background
[1:08:29] and a
[1:08:31] context and a foundation for what we're
[1:08:33] going to get into I'm going to
[1:08:36] start with that scripture we read in 1st
[1:08:39] Samuel
[1:08:40] 25 and Samuel
[1:08:43] died a great
[1:08:45] man
[1:08:46] died a powerful man died a man who was a
[1:08:51] prophet he was a judge
[1:08:54] he functioned as a
[1:08:56] priest he died and the Bible tells us
[1:08:59] and all the Israelites were gathered
[1:09:02] together and lamented him nation is in
[1:09:08] mourning Nation
[1:09:11] stops because the great spiritual leader
[1:09:14] has gone
[1:09:16] on Samuel's death marks the end of an
[1:09:21] era because we know Abraham ISAC Jacob
[1:09:25] who turned to Israel the children of
[1:09:26] Israel sent into Egypt coming out Moses
[1:09:30] years later brings them out and then
[1:09:32] Joshua takes them into the promised land
[1:09:35] and between
[1:09:36] Joshua and Samuel are all the judges
[1:09:40] from annel who is Caleb's younger
[1:09:42] brother to Ehud Deborah Gideon jeffa and
[1:09:45] Samson and we know that Samuel
[1:09:48] represented the result of Prayer of a
[1:09:50] Barron
[1:09:52] woman it was not a normal birth it was a
[1:09:54] woman who was in travail of Soul because
[1:09:57] she was under pressure in her
[1:09:59] home and she took her pressure to the
[1:10:02] altar we need more women like that who
[1:10:05] would take their pressure to the altar
[1:10:07] we did a study on that sometime ago and
[1:10:09] in bitterness of Soul the high priest
[1:10:11] Eli thought she was drunk because she
[1:10:13] was crying so much and mumbling so much
[1:10:15] that he said why you drinking he say I'm
[1:10:17] not drinking I'm in travail of
[1:10:20] Soul bring us back believers who are in
[1:10:22] travail of soul where they sigh and they
[1:10:25] cry because they have a need and instead
[1:10:26] of running to this person or that person
[1:10:28] they run to the Altar for God to deal
[1:10:31] with the situation and God met her
[1:10:33] because she made a she made a covenant
[1:10:35] with the Lord and Lord if you give me
[1:10:37] this son I'm going to give this son back
[1:10:38] to
[1:10:39] you Hallelujah and God heard her prayer
[1:10:42] God honored her prayer God granted her
[1:10:44] prayer to that woman named Hannah God
[1:10:46] gave her a son whose name was
[1:10:48] Samuel and the Bible say God gave Samuel
[1:10:51] Grace he gave Samuel favor with God and
[1:10:54] with men and Samuel grew up we know the
[1:10:56] story under the training of
[1:11:00] Eli a high priest who didn't manage his
[1:11:03] home the criticism of Eli was his son
[1:11:06] were running
[1:11:08] havoc and God say why you didn't address
[1:11:10] your boys why you allow them to do what
[1:11:13] they want and God killed his sons and
[1:11:16] the heartache and the pain of the story
[1:11:18] when when when Eli heard that the Ark of
[1:11:20] the Covenant was taken away he died in
[1:11:22] his seat
[1:11:24] all of this Samuel would have witnessed
[1:11:25] as a boy Samuel would have heard the
[1:11:27] voice Samuel Samuel he didn't even know
[1:11:29] what to do with it because the Bible
[1:11:31] said he didn't even know God and the
[1:11:33] high priest Eli said L when you hear
[1:11:35] that just say Lord here I
[1:11:37] am all his training Samuel went under
[1:11:40] until God start to deal with Samuel as a
[1:11:42] judge he is over the people God is
[1:11:44] showing Samuel things and revealing
[1:11:47] himself to Samuel and using Samuel
[1:11:49] between God's thoughts and his people
[1:11:51] until Samuel comes to a crossroad as it
[1:11:53] would were and the people say we want a
[1:11:55] king like the rest of the world and it
[1:11:58] grieved Samuel when he heard
[1:12:00] this and God said don't worry about it
[1:12:02] they have not rejected you they have
[1:12:04] rejected me and God showed Samuel a
[1:12:07] young man named Saul and he anointed
[1:12:09] that man Saul to be
[1:12:11] king all of this Samuel would have seen
[1:12:13] as the the the the the the the chapter
[1:12:16] of the judges was coming to a Clos
[1:12:17] anybody with me this morning I'm
[1:12:19] painting a background so you can see the
[1:12:21] unfolding of this
[1:12:22] thing and S and Saul sat it off good you
[1:12:26] know Saul sat off real good there was
[1:12:29] until Saul began to do his own
[1:12:34] thing an incident after incident Sam say
[1:12:37] listen God not with you anymore you
[1:12:39] know and as you read it you almost feel
[1:12:42] sorry for Saul because there are these
[1:12:44] moments through his life you see these
[1:12:45] glimpses of repentance and he want to be
[1:12:47] right but the Bible says that God
[1:12:49] allowed an evil spirit to go to Saul so
[1:12:52] upset God was but the way Saul
[1:12:54] disregarded the laws of God and the
[1:12:57] Commandments of God and God tell Samuel
[1:12:58] Samuel how long will you mourn for Saul
[1:13:01] a finish with
[1:13:02] Saul I want nothing to do with him
[1:13:05] anymore God had reached his breaking
[1:13:10] point it is not uncommon for God God
[1:13:13] reaches breaking point in the days of
[1:13:14] Noah you know butam could talk about it
[1:13:17] as God one day he looked down and see
[1:13:19] young people at the line trying to get
[1:13:21] salvation and no salvation for them they
[1:13:23] done CR the line Breaking
[1:13:24] Point seeking the Lord while he might be
[1:13:27] found call upon him while he is near
[1:13:29] there's a limit to what God will do
[1:13:31] there's a limit to his Mercy there's a
[1:13:33] limit to his grace there's a limit to
[1:13:35] how long going to say come fix your life
[1:13:37] get an order change your walk change
[1:13:39] your to he will do it and then God says
[1:13:41] I'm
[1:13:43] done I can't take it no
[1:13:48] more I wanted to preach but over read
[1:13:51] scripture some weeks ago and it it's it
[1:13:54] it affected
[1:13:56] me here in Jeremiah speak for the Lord
[1:13:59] and asking the question what iniquity
[1:14:01] have your fathers found in
[1:14:03] me you know what have I done to your
[1:14:06] fathers that that all you're going and
[1:14:08] do all this nonsense tell me I'll fix it
[1:14:11] imagine almighty God trying to negotiate
[1:14:13] with man and say if it's me is the
[1:14:15] problem let let me know you
[1:14:17] know so much God trying to bridge the
[1:14:21] gap between his children and himself he
[1:14:23] say if if I'm the problem he say what
[1:14:25] iniquity have you found in me that lead
[1:14:27] you to all these false gods and all
[1:14:30] these false clothes and all this worldly
[1:14:32] music and all your life you're living
[1:14:34] what have I done to you that drive you
[1:14:36] to this
[1:14:40] thing God reached his Breaking
[1:14:43] Point anybody with me this
[1:14:46] morning I just want to talk to you a
[1:14:48] little bit from this thing because God
[1:14:49] is unfolding
[1:14:52] something
[1:14:54] and Samuel is griev in his heart God
[1:14:55] said to Samuel Samuel stop it how long
[1:14:58] you'll mourn for him he dead already
[1:15:00] he's walking but he's
[1:15:03] dead Samuel is mourning so like a dead
[1:15:06] man you
[1:15:08] know Saul's still on his
[1:15:10] throne but Samuel know he's dead oh God
[1:15:15] death begins in the sanctuary death
[1:15:17] begins in the church people still come
[1:15:19] to church
[1:15:21] but and Samuel it it it resonance will
[1:15:23] say you can't mourn him anymore this is
[1:15:26] not Samuel praying for Saul now he was
[1:15:27] mourning him because he know there was
[1:15:29] no coming back oh anybody with me the
[1:15:31] house this
[1:15:33] morning and God send Samuel he said go
[1:15:36] to the house of
[1:15:38] Jesse and there you will find a man
[1:15:41] after my own heart you will find a new
[1:15:44] king you will find the one I'm going to
[1:15:45] use because I have a plan I have a way
[1:15:49] to Redemption there's a plan that's
[1:15:50] unfolding so bad behavior can stop the
[1:15:53] plan the enemy can't stop the plan
[1:15:56] unbelief can't stop the plan depression
[1:15:58] can't stop the plan mistakes not going
[1:16:00] to stop the plan my plan is too
[1:16:02] important no man will stop my plan I'll
[1:16:05] get somebody
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:11] else so Samuel goes down to the house of
[1:16:14] Jesse and you know the story Eliah comes
[1:16:17] the first born and each one comes and
[1:16:20] and and and and and the reality is
[1:16:22] Samuel couldn't tell tell who to
[1:16:25] choose in his mind eye he thought elab
[1:16:28] the firstborn was going to be the one
[1:16:30] and God allow him to go through that
[1:16:32] process to teach his Prophet to teach
[1:16:34] his the last judge I'm not letting you
[1:16:36] choose it's not your kind of choice not
[1:16:38] man's choice I am looking at the
[1:16:41] heart until all seven passed through and
[1:16:44] and Samuel had to be confused and say
[1:16:45] but wait night it had to be somebody
[1:16:47] else he said well there's one more he T
[1:16:50] sheep he say send for him amen and the
[1:16:53] Bible says Samuel pour the whole Horn of
[1:16:55] the altar the whole Horn of the altar on
[1:16:58] David listen David didn't ask to be
[1:17:00] chosen David didn't volunteer for the
[1:17:03] role David didn't know even what he was
[1:17:05] coming to when they called David come up
[1:17:06] to the house now David get a WhatsApp
[1:17:08] maybe say come up come up to the house
[1:17:10] David come up to the house not knowing
[1:17:11] what they're calling for maybe it was a
[1:17:12] food maybe it was what and and and David
[1:17:15] walked straight into the Horn of the
[1:17:17] altar straight into anointing oil and
[1:17:20] some of you come to church this morning
[1:17:22] you didn't even know what you're coming
[1:17:23] to and you
[1:17:24] walk straight into
[1:17:29] oil and from that day the Bible said
[1:17:33] David was anointed and the spirit of God
[1:17:35] was with David and from that very minute
[1:17:38] and evil spirit went to
[1:17:43] Sol can the church say Amen you may be
[1:17:46] SE it a little bit I'm trying to teach
[1:17:47] and to talk to you a little bit
[1:17:49] we the moment the anointing Came Upon
[1:17:52] David and an evil spirit went to saw the
[1:17:54] same
[1:17:56] instant David picked up an anointing and
[1:17:58] he picked up an
[1:18:02] enemy he picked up his Destiny and
[1:18:04] purpose and he picked up someone who
[1:18:05] wanted to kill
[1:18:08] him David didn't choose this walk he
[1:18:10] didn't ask for the walk God chose the
[1:18:13] walk God gave him the walk no wonder
[1:18:15] David could speak he would lay a table
[1:18:17] for me in the presence of my enemies
[1:18:19] because David understood after a while
[1:18:22] that the plan of God had to unfold a
[1:18:25] certain
[1:18:26] [Applause]
[1:18:27] way and unlike Saul who was made king
[1:18:31] without process David was being brought
[1:18:33] into kingship by a
[1:18:38] process he had to earn the right to sit
[1:18:41] on the throne he was anointed but God
[1:18:43] wanted his character to be a certain way
[1:18:46] because Saul had messed it
[1:18:49] up anybody with me this morning
[1:18:54] [Applause]
[1:18:59] and we don't have much we still dealing
[1:19:00] with chapter one of Sam of of of first
[1:19:03] Samuel 25 right the death of a great
[1:19:06] man whose name was
[1:19:10] Samuel but on the road to this because
[1:19:13] there's a background we need to
[1:19:14] understand with this thing
[1:19:16] Saul as a
[1:19:19] backslidden
[1:19:20] king had some victories
[1:19:23] had some successes had some
[1:19:27] experiences but through this journey we
[1:19:30] know the story they came to a crossroad
[1:19:31] there's war in the land and you don't
[1:19:33] know what to do with the Philistines and
[1:19:35] and the Bible said and I want us to
[1:19:37] catch this the Bible said that anybody
[1:19:39] who Saul taught could have fight he he
[1:19:40] recruited them one time one time if you
[1:19:44] look like you could fight he was coming
[1:19:46] to get you so if you were not with Saul
[1:19:48] the belief was you can't
[1:19:50] fight so the fact that David was not
[1:19:53] there it was a testament that David
[1:19:55] looked like he couldn't
[1:19:56] fight but we know the story one
[1:19:59] day Jesse sent David to carry food for
[1:20:04] his brothers and to collect the little a
[1:20:05] little piece of the paycheck that they
[1:20:07] got the Bible said so so so Jesse could
[1:20:09] buy some stuff for the house and that
[1:20:11] kind of stuff and while David is there
[1:20:13] he hears the Cry of Goliath send a man
[1:20:16] to fight me and David we dramatized it
[1:20:19] was walking away from the situation and
[1:20:21] he say wait wait wait wait hold up hold
[1:20:22] up hold up what are going on
[1:20:24] here who is this uncircumcised
[1:20:28] Philistine if nobody going and fight him
[1:20:30] I will go you know and Saul would have
[1:20:33] said to David listen you are but a youth
[1:20:37] so you cannot go this man called golad
[1:20:40] been fighting from his youth so you're
[1:20:42] not qualified for this thing and David
[1:20:44] had to respond and say but as a Shepherd
[1:20:47] I had need to defend the Sheep against
[1:20:49] the lion and I overcame against the bear
[1:20:51] and I overcame I think I'm
[1:20:53] qualified a man who wasn't trained in
[1:20:55] the school of man was telling the king
[1:20:58] of the land I'm qualified to go and deal
[1:20:59] with this thing and Saul say well if you
[1:21:01] wanted they even take listen whoever
[1:21:03] could fight gol gain Saul daughter gain
[1:21:06] money David didn't even do it for that
[1:21:08] know David saying is a uncircumcised
[1:21:10] Philistine defying the army of the
[1:21:12] Living God this thing don't sound right
[1:21:14] with me not it it it's not sitting well
[1:21:16] with
[1:21:19] me it not resonating with me amen and
[1:21:23] I'm trying to speed through this path
[1:21:25] because this is where the issue starts
[1:21:28] we know where David kills
[1:21:33] golad and Saul ask the question who is
[1:21:37] this he didn't just ask who is this know
[1:21:39] let me let me get to the exact verse in
[1:21:41] in in 1 Samuel 17 he asked the question
[1:21:44] there at the end of who son ad
[1:21:49] do he even asked him what your name is
[1:21:52] he said who whose son are you and I'll
[1:21:54] get into that a little later on and the
[1:21:56] Bible says and it goes on that in in
[1:21:58] verse in chapter 18 of 1 Samuel and it
[1:22:01] came to pass when David was returned
[1:22:03] from the slaughter of the Philistines
[1:22:04] that the woman came out of all cities of
[1:22:07] Israel singing and dancing to meet King
[1:22:10] Saul with Tabet with joy and with
[1:22:12] instruments of Music they rejoicing
[1:22:15] because the Philistines had them back up
[1:22:17] for a while and the woman answered one
[1:22:19] another they they testifying to one
[1:22:21] another as they played and said shall
[1:22:24] Saul had slain his thousands and David
[1:22:27] his 10 thousands and they rejoicing they
[1:22:30] just happy they just happy than you went
[1:22:31] inside you
[1:22:33] know but verse 8 and Saul was very rough
[1:22:37] and the saying dis pleased him and he
[1:22:38] said they have ascribed unto David 10
[1:22:40] thousands and to me they have ascribed
[1:22:43] but thousands and what can he have more
[1:22:45] but the
[1:22:48] Kingdom so Saul had to get a fight he
[1:22:50] not rejoicing because the pH know he was
[1:22:52] in his throne you see how power does
[1:22:54] corrupt he can't say well bless the Lord
[1:22:57] thank God for this man called David oh
[1:22:59] gosh he help no no no no no he said but
[1:23:01] wait a minute what what song what song
[1:23:03] Let just play back the track play back
[1:23:06] again no it played slowly Saul they're
[1:23:09] saying Saul had killed th and David no
[1:23:11] no no no no take it off the
[1:23:13] air take don't play on your radio ban
[1:23:16] that music but I can imagine in secret
[1:23:19] everybody playing it know Saul kill a
[1:23:21] thousand David kill 10,000 all the
[1:23:23] little children on the street and
[1:23:25] assault he get upset I want to paint a
[1:23:36] picture and imagine after that with the
[1:23:38] George in next verse and Saul I David
[1:23:41] from that day and
[1:23:43] forward not Saul prayed that David would
[1:23:47] get would grow stronger in faith and in
[1:23:49] Grace and in knowledge and in wisdom and
[1:23:50] the Lord will use him mightily for the
[1:23:52] next next
[1:23:54] service from that day he said I am
[1:23:59] funny thank you brother
[1:24:02] George and listen not only that you know
[1:24:04] and it came to pass on the tomorrow that
[1:24:06] the evil spirit from God Came Upon Saul
[1:24:09] and he prophesied in the midst of the
[1:24:11] house and David played with his hand as
[1:24:13] at other time so so I want you to
[1:24:15] understand for all the time David
[1:24:16] playing to drive the spirit away it's
[1:24:19] not as if Saul don't know David David
[1:24:20] inside the man king come inside the CLE
[1:24:23] but this time after the conquest of
[1:24:25] Goliath the Bible said and there was a
[1:24:28] javelin in Saul's
[1:24:31] hand and Saul cast the javelin for he
[1:24:34] said I will Smite David even to the wall
[1:24:37] with
[1:24:38] it so here's this
[1:24:41] King ready to kill David for why
[1:24:46] why and David avoided out of his
[1:24:49] presence
[1:24:50] twice and I'm building to something here
[1:24:53] now just very quickly after this
[1:24:56] incident the Bible said that Saul tried
[1:24:59] directly and indirectly to kill David
[1:25:02] many times he said David you could have
[1:25:05] my daughter you know he's sending
[1:25:06] through some men to tell him that but if
[1:25:08] you want daughter you have to go and
[1:25:09] kill a 100 Philistines and get their
[1:25:12] forkins because Saul telling himself
[1:25:14] there's no way possible David could kill
[1:25:15] a 100 men the Bible say David killed
[1:25:20] 200 so sa at a back down so and and Saul
[1:25:24] say I will give him a daughter so she'll
[1:25:25] be a snare tra to him so in other words
[1:25:27] so I could WhatsApp her to know where he
[1:25:30] is so the Bible said that one time that
[1:25:33] that that that that Saul sent men to his
[1:25:35] daughter's house because now by this
[1:25:36] time David is his son-in-law you
[1:25:39] know so he's a warrior he's a musician
[1:25:42] he's in the court he has a seat at the
[1:25:43] table he's a captain of the God and he
[1:25:46] WhatsApp the daughter say where David
[1:25:48] you
[1:25:51] home and and the daughter tell David
[1:25:53] David here now if you don't run tonight
[1:25:54] you're dead
[1:25:57] tomorrow and the Bible says you read the
[1:25:59] Bible that she make a little figurine
[1:26:02] put it under the pillow and make it look
[1:26:04] as if David day and when the men come
[1:26:05] they say where David he say you see
[1:26:07] sick they say we want David we come to
[1:26:09] look for David he he's sick I might him
[1:26:11] to get up into the room they recogn but
[1:26:13] wait now David not here Saul say to his
[1:26:17] daughter how you could trick me
[1:26:19] so he get vexed with his own daughter
[1:26:21] because he want to kill David so much
[1:26:23] I'm building a a drama dramatizing here
[1:26:26] after this thing the Bible says David
[1:26:28] ran to
[1:26:30] Samuel to tell Samuel all that Saul
[1:26:33] trying to do to
[1:26:35] him I'm seeing all of this to build a
[1:26:38] connection between David's almost large
[1:26:41] last major encounter with Samuel was him
[1:26:44] pouring out his heart to Samuel about
[1:26:47] how Saul trying to destroy his
[1:26:50] life I wonder how Samuel
[1:26:54] died he would have died with mixed
[1:26:56] feelings you
[1:26:57] know because he died with no Clarity he
[1:27:00] just had to have trust in God with how
[1:27:02] this thing going to work out because at
[1:27:03] the time of his death David was running
[1:27:05] for his
[1:27:08] life just two more I want to touch
[1:27:11] before get into this thing here the
[1:27:13] Bible said that there was a time of a
[1:27:15] feast this is this is in 1st Samuel 20
[1:27:20] when David fled and the Bible said David
[1:27:21] is just running he's running he's
[1:27:23] running for his life he's in the
[1:27:24] wilderness could you imagine a man with
[1:27:27] a revelation of kingship but his
[1:27:28] situation is not kingship what do you do
[1:27:31] when your Revelation doesn't match your
[1:27:37] situation David and his friend Jonathan
[1:27:41] Saul's son is pleading with his father
[1:27:45] he say what what's really going on and
[1:27:46] the Bible says that that there was a
[1:27:48] time that David was supposed to come and
[1:27:49] there's a seat on the table for David
[1:27:50] and David is not there the first day saw
[1:27:52] make no fuss about it he maybe say he
[1:27:53] had to clean up himself before he come
[1:27:55] into my presence the next day it came to
[1:27:58] pass on tomorrow that David's place was
[1:28:00] empty and saled unto Jonathan his son
[1:28:03] wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse I
[1:28:06] want you to note here he not calling him
[1:28:08] David this is his
[1:28:10] son-in-law he asking for his son-in-law
[1:28:13] he name saying hey wa where David know
[1:28:14] he say where is his son of Jesse so the
[1:28:17] son of Jesse means I want to call this
[1:28:19] boy name
[1:28:20] know D to your
[1:28:24] son he want to call him David he said
[1:28:27] why is the son of Jesse this is Saul's
[1:28:30] son-in-law a warrior a man everybody
[1:28:33] know wherefore cometh not the son of
[1:28:36] Jesse to meet meaning to eat neither
[1:28:38] yesterday Nor today yesterday I give him
[1:28:39] a pass but by today I thought he would
[1:28:41] have been
[1:28:42] here and Jonathan answered
[1:28:45] Saul David earnestly asked the leave of
[1:28:48] me to go to
[1:28:50] Bethlehem and he said let me me go I
[1:28:52] pray the for a family at a sacrifice in
[1:28:54] the city and my brother he had commanded
[1:28:56] me to be there all this is a response
[1:28:58] that Jonathan given Saul to test to see
[1:29:00] Saul's response then Saul's anger was
[1:29:03] kindled against Jonathan and he said
[1:29:04] unto him thou son of the perverse
[1:29:06] rebellious
[1:29:10] woman he set up his daughter to kill
[1:29:12] David now his own son Jonathan he said
[1:29:15] thou son of the perverse rebellious
[1:29:18] woman do you not know that thou Hast
[1:29:20] chosen the son of Jesse again the name
[1:29:22] son of Jesse I want to point it out
[1:29:23] because we're going to meet it again to
[1:29:25] thine own confusion in other
[1:29:28] words and unto the confusion of thy
[1:29:31] mother's nakedness in other words you
[1:29:32] are was a son
[1:29:35] now for as long as the son of Jesse
[1:29:39] liveth upon the ground Thou shalt not be
[1:29:41] established nor thy kingdom wherefore
[1:29:43] now send and fetch him unto me for he
[1:29:46] shall surely
[1:29:48] die and Jonathan answered Saul his
[1:29:50] father and said unto him where therefore
[1:29:52] shall he be slain what had he done and
[1:29:54] Saul cast a javelin at him to Smite him
[1:29:57] whereby so he tried to kill his own son
[1:29:59] now this the same son he say if Jesse's
[1:30:02] son live you can't get his throne now he
[1:30:04] want to kill his son who's supposed to
[1:30:05] get he
[1:30:06] throne and I want to show you something
[1:30:08] here is it sounds an interesting story
[1:30:11] but this is what an evil spirit does to
[1:30:16] somebody make no mistake about it this
[1:30:18] is Brother Saul once anointed because
[1:30:20] Samuel the same Samuel who anointed
[1:30:23] David anointed
[1:30:25] Saul but the Saul who is sitting there
[1:30:28] is not the one who David who Samuel
[1:30:30] anointed know because the man has an
[1:30:32] evil spirit that making him jealous
[1:30:35] envious angry in so much it eat into him
[1:30:38] that he willing to kill his son he
[1:30:40] willing to come against the daughter's
[1:30:43] marriage anybody with
[1:30:48] me it gets worse you know
[1:30:54] 1st Samuel 21 are you with me this
[1:30:57] morning everybody with me and David came
[1:31:00] to Knob to ahc the priest and ahc was
[1:31:04] afraid of the meeting and the
[1:31:05] mindblowing thing through all of this is
[1:31:07] David still serving Saul at no point is
[1:31:11] he rejecting an instruction is he
[1:31:14] stopping doing the purpose that he's
[1:31:15] he's supposed to do in fact during the
[1:31:18] whole running he saves the people in the
[1:31:20] village of this will be the village of
[1:31:22] uh uh uh uh kellia as it were but just
[1:31:26] before that David went to a himc the
[1:31:29] priest and a himc was afraid at the
[1:31:31] meeting this is this is 21 why out and
[1:31:34] and when a himc see him he said why are
[1:31:36] you why are you alone a nobody with you
[1:31:39] and David said to uh himc the king had
[1:31:41] commanded me of business so Saul trying
[1:31:44] to kill him and still sending him
[1:31:45] instructions of things that one done in
[1:31:47] the government and
[1:31:48] thing and David so gentle so Meek so
[1:31:53] honest so pure that he know the man want
[1:31:56] to kill him but nothing stopping him
[1:31:57] from fulfilling the King's
[1:31:59] Command you see the kind of man David
[1:32:03] was and David realized he have no sword
[1:32:06] and stuff and and and and uh I want to
[1:32:10] skip through some of
[1:32:12] this this is verse eight and David said
[1:32:15] unto a himc is there not here any under
[1:32:17] thine hand spear or sword for I have
[1:32:19] neither brought my sword nor my weapons
[1:32:22] with me because the king's business
[1:32:24] required
[1:32:26] haste and the priest said the sword of
[1:32:28] Goliad the Philistine whom thou slewest
[1:32:31] in the valley of ela behold it is here
[1:32:33] wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if
[1:32:36] thou will take it take it for there's no
[1:32:38] other Sav that here so the only sword we
[1:32:40] have here is the sword of goli if you
[1:32:41] want to take it and David arose and fled
[1:32:44] that day for fear of
[1:32:46] Saul and The Story Goes On the point I
[1:32:49] want to make here is that when Saul
[1:32:51] heard
[1:32:52] cuz he trying to track David down now
[1:32:55] and a painting a picture is the last
[1:32:56] part of it and David then departed then
[1:33:00] in in this is chapter
[1:33:02] 22
[1:33:08] and let's go to 22 but Shan to
[1:33:17] verse 22:6 and when Saul heard that
[1:33:20] David was dis covered and the men that
[1:33:22] were with him now Saul aboard in giba
[1:33:25] under a tree Rama having his spear in
[1:33:26] his hand and all his servants were
[1:33:28] standing about him then Saul said unto
[1:33:30] his servants that stood about him here
[1:33:32] now you benjamines will the son of Jesse
[1:33:35] give every one of you fields and
[1:33:36] Vineyards and make you all captains and
[1:33:38] of thousands and captains of hundreds
[1:33:41] that all of you have conspired against
[1:33:43] me and there is none that showeth me
[1:33:45] that my son had made a league with the
[1:33:47] son of Jesse and there is none of you
[1:33:49] that is sorry for me
[1:33:53] so only if you didn't sorry for me that
[1:33:55] that I stressed out here that David
[1:33:57] there winning and David there getting
[1:33:58] blessing and only not
[1:34:04] sorry I want you to understand the
[1:34:06] psychology at work here all not feeling
[1:34:09] sorry for me or show it unto me that my
[1:34:11] son had stirred up my servant against me
[1:34:13] to lie in weight as at this
[1:34:17] day then answer do the Edomite which was
[1:34:20] set over the Servants of Saul and said I
[1:34:22] saw the son of Jesse notice nobody
[1:34:25] calling him
[1:34:26] David so I want to identify in Saul's
[1:34:29] Camp the way to refer to David was the
[1:34:32] son of Jesse it became somewhat of a
[1:34:34] derogatory term we are calling him David
[1:34:36] the son of
[1:34:37] Jesse then answered D the Edomite which
[1:34:40] was set over the Servants of Saul and
[1:34:42] said I saw the son of Jesse coming to
[1:34:44] Knob to a himc the son of autb and he he
[1:34:47] inquired of the Lord for him and gave
[1:34:50] him vitual of food and gave him the
[1:34:52] sword of Goliad the
[1:34:55] Philistine then the king sent to call a
[1:34:58] himc the priest the son of ahitub and
[1:35:01] all his father's house the priests that
[1:35:03] were in knob and they came all of them
[1:35:05] to the king I want you to see the
[1:35:07] picture here now you have an angry king
[1:35:10] looking for an innocent boy who did
[1:35:12] nothing to her this King and Saul said
[1:35:15] hear now thou son of aitu this is a
[1:35:17] priest he's talking
[1:35:20] to
[1:35:22] and he answered here am here I am my
[1:35:24] Lord and Saul said unto him why have ye
[1:35:26] conspired against me thou and the son of
[1:35:29] Jesse in that thou H has given him bread
[1:35:33] and a sword and has inquired of God for
[1:35:36] him in other words you see a prayer for
[1:35:38] him and he should rise against me to lie
[1:35:41] and wait as at this day so Saul is also
[1:35:44] spreading word that David out to get
[1:35:47] him he is spreading his like a a
[1:35:50] misinformation campaign
[1:35:52] he's saying watch now if you don't know
[1:35:54] David trying to kill me I just letting
[1:35:57] you know I mean you might have heard
[1:35:58] other things about David you know he
[1:36:00] killing Philistines and you know he's
[1:36:01] out there defending the people and stuff
[1:36:03] but behind the scenes I just want you to
[1:36:05] know that this brother who looks like he
[1:36:07] is for the Lord he is ready out to get
[1:36:13] me so I want you to just look out I want
[1:36:16] to know and I'm in in fact I'm very
[1:36:18] upset that he didn't call me
[1:36:22] you don't have my
[1:36:23] number you don't have abna phone number
[1:36:26] you don't you don't have Jonathan phone
[1:36:27] number you don't have anybody phone
[1:36:28] number so why he didn't tell me so
[1:36:31] listen to verse 14 and a himc answered
[1:36:33] the king and said and who is so faithful
[1:36:36] among all thy servants as David so the
[1:36:38] priest up he he confused he said he say
[1:36:41] who is so I don't know anybody who is
[1:36:43] more faithful to you than David which is
[1:36:46] the King's
[1:36:49] son-in-law he says so he faithful
[1:36:52] he's your son-in-law so you telling me
[1:36:53] your son-in-law out to kill
[1:36:56] you and go it at thy bidding meaning
[1:36:59] everything David does he does at your
[1:37:02] command and is Honorable in thy house
[1:37:06] meaning he has done nothing to dishonor
[1:37:08] your house are
[1:37:10] confused I want you to show an evil
[1:37:12] spirit at
[1:37:14] work did I then begin to inquire of God
[1:37:17] for him be it far from me let not the
[1:37:20] king impute anything unto his servant
[1:37:23] nor to all the house of my father for
[1:37:25] thy servant knew nothing of all of this
[1:37:27] less or more in other words I don't know
[1:37:29] nothing about what you talking about
[1:37:30] with David trying to kill you and David
[1:37:31] out to get you and David trying to
[1:37:32] remove you from the throne I know
[1:37:34] nothing about that kind of stuff I want
[1:37:36] to build it something here now right and
[1:37:39] the King said Thou shalt surely die look
[1:37:41] at the response of King Saul to a
[1:37:47] priest Thou shalt surely die a himc thou
[1:37:50] and all thy father 's house and the King
[1:37:53] Saul anointed
[1:37:55] Saul said unto the footmen that stood
[1:37:58] about him turn and slay the priest of
[1:38:00] the
[1:38:02] Lord because their hand also is with
[1:38:05] David and because they knew when he fled
[1:38:08] and did not show it to me but the
[1:38:10] Servants of the king would not put forth
[1:38:13] their hand to fall upon the priests of
[1:38:15] the Lord and the King said to dou turn
[1:38:19] thou and fall upon the priest
[1:38:21] and D the Edomite turned and he fell
[1:38:24] upon the priest and slew on that day
[1:38:26] four score and five persons that did
[1:38:29] wear the linen ephod in other words on
[1:38:31] that day they killed 85
[1:38:37] priests on that day 85 priests were
[1:38:41] killed because Saul felt that a him did
[1:38:45] not let him know that David passed by
[1:38:47] this
[1:38:49] way and so allall because of an evil
[1:38:52] spirit thought it was justified to slay
[1:38:55] priests this goes beyond slaying
[1:38:57] Brothers
[1:38:58] now this is Priests of the Lord who just
[1:39:01] doing their Duty as priests no wonder
[1:39:05] God said Saul will be finished and his
[1:39:06] line
[1:39:13] finished and knob the city of the priest
[1:39:17] smort he with the edge of the sword
[1:39:19] listen both men
[1:39:21] and women children and babies sucklings
[1:39:25] and oxen and asses and sheep with the
[1:39:28] edge of the
[1:39:29] sword so Saul stood there and watched 85
[1:39:33] priests and men and women and children
[1:39:37] killed so angry he was at this man
[1:39:40] called
[1:39:45] David and one of the sons of aimc the
[1:39:50] son of a hbe named ABA so one of the son
[1:39:54] of the priests escaped and fled after
[1:39:56] David and ABA showed David that Saul had
[1:40:00] slain the Lord's priest now you know the
[1:40:02] kind of man David
[1:40:06] was and David said unto ABA I knew it
[1:40:10] that day when brother dog because these
[1:40:13] are
[1:40:15] brothers in some way for of fashion
[1:40:17] cousin join up all kind of they in the
[1:40:19] church so I knew it that day when
[1:40:22] brother doag was
[1:40:24] there the
[1:40:26] Edomite that he would surely tell
[1:40:29] Saul I have occasioned the Deb of all
[1:40:32] the persons of thy father's house in
[1:40:34] other
[1:40:35] words is I I I I cause
[1:40:39] this and that would have eaten up a
[1:40:45] David
[1:40:47] abide thou with me fear not for he that
[1:40:50] seeketh my life seeketh thy life but
[1:40:54] with me Thou shalt be in
[1:40:57] Safeguard so I want to paint a picture
[1:40:59] that riding with David is this man ABA
[1:41:03] who's a priest who his whole family
[1:41:08] dead so with David brother Hugh is a
[1:41:11] bunch of angry
[1:41:14] men men who know if they get caught up
[1:41:17] with Saul's men they will get killed Men
[1:41:19] Who you you you understand the context
[1:41:22] the
[1:41:23] picture everybody with me I hope you
[1:41:26] have time today know because we we have
[1:41:28] to finish this course I can't do this in
[1:41:29] two parts this is this is one part we
[1:41:31] have to finish here and I get to the
[1:41:33] message yet this is still the foundation
[1:41:36] right chapter 23 of 1 Samuel then they
[1:41:39] told David saying behold the Philistines
[1:41:42] fight against kellia and they rub the
[1:41:44] trashing
[1:41:45] flaws so David dealing
[1:41:48] with all of Saul's foolishness
[1:41:53] and while Saul spending good time
[1:41:56] chasing David the Philistines attacking
[1:41:58] the villages homes being destroyed
[1:42:01] marriages being destroyed young people
[1:42:04] going into the world all this but
[1:42:05] meanwhile Saul chasing
[1:42:09] David I want to paint a picture because
[1:42:11] this here is not a story of yesterday
[1:42:13] this is now we're talking
[1:42:15] about if you don't get back no
[1:42:17] appreciate
[1:42:19] nothing appreciate what happening today
[1:42:21] present
[1:42:24] tense so they told David David I know
[1:42:26] you're under pressure and I want to
[1:42:28] paint a picture of a man under pressure
[1:42:31] because that's where we going a man
[1:42:33] under stress a man who is angry a man
[1:42:36] who is frustrated a man who is pure in
[1:42:38] heart but they're pushing him to his
[1:42:40] breaking
[1:42:42] point they're pushing him to become
[1:42:45] something that he's really not but under
[1:42:47] pressure people do all kind of
[1:42:49] stuff
[1:42:51] the gentle quiet accountant for 20 years
[1:42:53] he go to work and then he get up one day
[1:42:55] and go to the office and kill everybody
[1:42:57] say but he was so quiet not realizing
[1:43:00] that he had reached his breaking
[1:43:10] pointu 23 verse2 therefore David
[1:43:13] inquired of the Lord and this is one
[1:43:15] thing you will find with David over and
[1:43:16] over in scripture David are going to
[1:43:18] just move just so amen amen before David
[1:43:21] move he inquires of the Lord he said
[1:43:24] Lord shall I go and smite these
[1:43:27] Philistines Under Pressure but if you
[1:43:29] tell me to go I feeling a burden I know
[1:43:32] they Under Pressure I know they have no
[1:43:33] meent to fight I know they have no no
[1:43:34] defense but if you tell me to go Lord
[1:43:36] here I am send
[1:43:39] me and the Lord said unto David go and
[1:43:41] smite the Philistine and save
[1:43:44] Kia and David's men said unto him behold
[1:43:47] we be afraid here in Judah in other
[1:43:48] words we know where saw men because
[1:43:51] you're telling us go out of hiding
[1:43:53] because these men hiding for their life
[1:43:55] you're telling us to we we under
[1:43:57] pressure here in Judah they tell us to
[1:43:58] go out and fight now a whole different
[1:44:00] Army now the
[1:44:02] Philistines behold we be afraid here in
[1:44:04] Judah how much more then if we come to
[1:44:06] kellia against the armies of the
[1:44:08] Philistines then David inquired of the
[1:44:10] Lord yet again he said Lord hear what
[1:44:13] your brother is
[1:44:15] saying and the Lord answered him and
[1:44:17] said arise go to kellia for I will
[1:44:18] deliver the Philistines unto thine hand
[1:44:21] so David and his men went to kellia and
[1:44:23] fought with the Philistines and brought
[1:44:25] away their cattle and smed them with a
[1:44:27] great Slaughter so David saved the
[1:44:29] inhabitants of Kia so even though he
[1:44:31] under pressure even though Saul went to
[1:44:33] kill him David still doing all he could
[1:44:35] do for his
[1:44:43] people and I'll skip I'll skip through
[1:44:46] the rest of this thing here by the time
[1:44:49] we reach 1 Samuel 24 is the encounter of
[1:44:53] where Saul is sleeping in the tent and
[1:44:55] David has the opportunity to kill him
[1:44:58] that's
[1:44:58] right and he goes down and he cuts a
[1:45:01] piece of His
[1:45:02] Garment and he hides back away and when
[1:45:04] Saul gets up to walk he calls out to him
[1:45:06] and I want you to look at the
[1:45:08] conversation here
[1:45:15] now this is 24 brother Shan and we're
[1:45:18] going
[1:45:19] to
[1:45:22] verse
[1:45:23] four and the men of David said unto him
[1:45:27] behold the day of which the Lord said
[1:45:30] unto thee behold I will deliver thine
[1:45:33] enemy into thine hand that thou mayest
[1:45:35] do to him as it shall seem good unto
[1:45:39] thee then David arose and cut off the
[1:45:42] skirt of Saul's robe
[1:45:44] priv and it came to pass afterward that
[1:45:48] David's heart smot him he got got
[1:45:53] convicted because he had cut off Saul's
[1:45:56] skirt and he said unto his men the Lord
[1:45:58] forbid that I should do this thing unto
[1:46:01] my master the Lord's anointed to stretch
[1:46:05] forth my hand against him seeing he is
[1:46:08] the anointed of the Lord look at the
[1:46:11] respect that David still has for Saul
[1:46:14] after multiple attempts and you want to
[1:46:17] knock people out because they say one
[1:46:19] word against you
[1:46:22] one word somebody say something and you
[1:46:24] so vexed with that you want to go to
[1:46:29] war Saul meddled in David's marriage he
[1:46:32] tried to kill his own son he sent
[1:46:34] multiple men to kill him he sent David
[1:46:36] to get killed and here it was David has
[1:46:38] the chance to kill
[1:46:41] him and the most he could reach is cut a
[1:46:44] piece of his clothes and even that he
[1:46:46] get convicted he say oh God God forbid I
[1:46:48] can't do
[1:46:49] it no wonder God could say a man after
[1:46:52] my own
[1:46:54] heart when you have the power to revenge
[1:46:56] and do Vengeance and and and even the
[1:46:59] score and flatten the table and and and
[1:47:01] and and anybody with me and and here his
[1:47:05] Faithful Men these men these men not
[1:47:07] trying to be evil enough they know the
[1:47:09] stress that David is
[1:47:11] under no wonder David said many are they
[1:47:13] that increase that trouble me they know
[1:47:16] they hear the cries they hear the
[1:47:17] sighing they know they say David K here
[1:47:20] let's go here David whatever you need
[1:47:23] when David need a drink of water and he
[1:47:24] send them he couldn't these men so
[1:47:26] loyally pour the drink of water on the
[1:47:27] ground he said I even drink
[1:47:31] it here he has the opportunity to take
[1:47:33] out the man who wants to kill
[1:47:36] him and David can't bring himself to do
[1:47:39] it all of this is bottling up in David
[1:47:42] anybody with me this
[1:47:46] morning the Lord forbid that I should do
[1:47:49] this thing unto my master he's still
[1:47:50] calling him Master the Lord's anointed
[1:47:53] he still recognized that his man is
[1:47:55] Anointed no matter what he has done to
[1:47:57] me he's still a man of
[1:47:59] God I can't bring myself to disrespect
[1:48:05] him to stretch forth my hand against him
[1:48:08] seeing he is the anointed of the Lord so
[1:48:11] David stayed his servants with these
[1:48:13] words and suffered them suffered them
[1:48:15] means plea with them because they ready
[1:48:17] to go these men ready to fight they're
[1:48:19] ready to s listen it is not David just
[1:48:21] give us the word and we take him out
[1:48:23] know if you don't want to do it and I
[1:48:25] know you're feeling convicted turn your
[1:48:27] eyes go back in the cave we'll handle it
[1:48:29] for you we we have your back because
[1:48:31] these were David's Mighty Men I want you
[1:48:33] to everybody have friends you know I
[1:48:35] heard somebody say recently it's one
[1:48:36] thing when you make up with somebody but
[1:48:38] is Friends has be the problem sometimes
[1:48:39] because they know your
[1:48:42] makeup so David has suffer the men now
[1:48:44] suffer them not to Rise Against Saul
[1:48:46] because they ready say well David you
[1:48:48] car go no problem go and sleep wait
[1:48:50] didn't wake up in the morning the
[1:48:51] problem wouldn't
[1:48:53] exist say what listen Brothers Stand
[1:48:56] Down e i telling all you stand down
[1:48:58] leave Saul alone they don't touch his
[1:49:03] head but Saul rose up out of the cave
[1:49:06] and went on his way David also arose
[1:49:08] afterward and went out of the cave and
[1:49:10] cried after Saul now this is this is
[1:49:13] almost mindblowing to me because this is
[1:49:15] red big man thing you know this is not
[1:49:18] no joke walk with the Lord because this
[1:49:21] is somebody who tried to kill you
[1:49:22] multiple times and listen to the
[1:49:24] operation of David cried after Saul
[1:49:27] saying my Lord the
[1:49:30] king look at the respects my Lord the
[1:49:33] king and when Saul looked behind him
[1:49:35] David stooped with his face to the Earth
[1:49:38] and bowed
[1:49:39] himself you see the respects you see the
[1:49:44] humility and David said to Saul
[1:49:47] wherefore hearest thou men's words
[1:49:49] saying behold d David seeketh thy hurt
[1:49:52] behold this day thine eyes have seen how
[1:49:54] that the Lord had delivered thee today
[1:49:56] into mine hand in the cave and some B me
[1:50:00] kill thee but mine eyes spared thee and
[1:50:03] I said I will not put forth mine hand
[1:50:07] against my Lord for he is the Lord's
[1:50:11] anointed moreover my father look at the
[1:50:13] term of respect he's still calling Saul
[1:50:16] father moreover my father see y the
[1:50:20] skirt of thy robe in my hand I was this
[1:50:23] close to you so I'm not just talking I'm
[1:50:24] showing you I could have do it the skirt
[1:50:27] of thy robe in my hand for in that I cut
[1:50:30] off the skirt of thy robe and kill thee
[1:50:33] not know thou and see that there is
[1:50:35] neither evil nor transgression in my
[1:50:38] hand and I have not sinned against thee
[1:50:41] yet thou htest my soul to take
[1:50:45] it he David
[1:50:47] playing the Lord judged between between
[1:50:50] me and thee and the Lord avenge me of
[1:50:52] thee but mine hand shall not be upon
[1:50:54] thee I'm not going to touch your
[1:50:58] soul and as sayeth the proverb of the
[1:51:02] anels wickedness proceeded from the
[1:51:04] wicked but mine hand shall not be upon
[1:51:07] thee and then he goes on Saul after whom
[1:51:11] is the king of Israel come out after
[1:51:14] whom Dost thou pursue after a dead dog
[1:51:16] after a
[1:51:18] flea
[1:51:20] the Lord therefore be judge and judge
[1:51:22] between me and thee and see and plead my
[1:51:25] cause and deliver me out of thine hand
[1:51:28] and it came to pass listen carefully now
[1:51:31] when David had made an end of speaking
[1:51:33] these words unto
[1:51:35] Saul I want us to pause here for a
[1:51:38] minute and it came to pass when David
[1:51:40] had made an end of speaking these words
[1:51:43] unto Saul that Saul said listen to his
[1:51:46] words now is this thy voice my son David
[1:51:55] all the time before his son of Jesse son
[1:51:57] of Jesse son of Jesse son of
[1:51:59] Jesse is as if he didn't even recognize
[1:52:02] his voice but David's word had cut true
[1:52:07] the evil spirit upon Saul at that moment
[1:52:10] is as if Saul wake up from the evil
[1:52:13] spirit and he say wait now is David that
[1:52:16] is that is is is that
[1:52:18] you
[1:52:21] is this thy voice my son David no longer
[1:52:24] son of Jess know my son David and Saul
[1:52:27] lifted up his voice and
[1:52:29] wept and this is where I find it's
[1:52:31] painful because this is the issue I have
[1:52:33] friends people have evil spirits upon
[1:52:35] them you
[1:52:36] know and through the moving of the evil
[1:52:39] spirit upon them you see glimpses of the
[1:52:41] real person so there's the real Soul
[1:52:44] make himself known there through the
[1:52:46] evil spirit that guide in his hand and
[1:52:48] his decisions So when you say you
[1:52:50] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:52:52] principalities and powers and spiritual
[1:52:54] wickedness in high places on the throne
[1:52:57] of Israel is a man under the oppression
[1:52:59] of an evil
[1:53:01] spirit and his actions until or if he
[1:53:05] ever gets delivered because we know so
[1:53:07] and in witchcraft raising up Samuel from
[1:53:09] the dead through the witch of indor he
[1:53:11] went straight into
[1:53:14] witchcraft but look at this glimpse of
[1:53:16] the real man stting to show himself
[1:53:19] don't make of the real person showing
[1:53:21] themselves through an evil
[1:53:23] spirit we get into some things this
[1:53:24] morning how we doing for time I start
[1:53:26] the message yet all right no I go I go
[1:53:30] in don't worry today I TR watch away
[1:53:32] listen the party now
[1:53:34] start we start yet we reading message
[1:53:38] yet we we not warming
[1:53:42] up and it came to pass when David had
[1:53:44] made an end of speaking these words unto
[1:53:46] Saul that Saul said is this thy voice my
[1:53:49] son David and Saul lifted up his voice
[1:53:51] and wept and he said to David Thou Art
[1:53:53] more righteous than
[1:53:55] I so this is this is the real soul the
[1:53:58] soul that Samuel anointed this this is
[1:54:01] the original
[1:54:04] Soul it reminds me when Jesus met Legion
[1:54:07] because Legion was crying because there
[1:54:09] was the real man inside it was his
[1:54:11] Spirit upon Legion that had him acting
[1:54:13] crazy with and
[1:54:15] naked but the real man that was inside
[1:54:18] of those spirit is who reached
[1:54:22] Jesus and when those Spirits came off
[1:54:24] Legion put back on his clothes the man
[1:54:26] who was called Legion that man put back
[1:54:27] on his clothes and went and testify hey
[1:54:29] I know you see me acting crazy before
[1:54:31] but thank God he took those Spirits off
[1:54:33] of me I'm a change man I'm a different
[1:54:37] man anybody with me this morning
[1:54:43] Hallelujah
[1:54:44] hallu Thou Art more righteous than I for
[1:54:47] thou Hast rewarded me good whereas I
[1:54:49] have rewarded the evil so Saul now he
[1:54:51] could see what going on yes and thou
[1:54:54] Hast shown this day how thou Hast dealt
[1:54:58] well with me for as much as when the
[1:55:00] Lord had delivered me into thine hand
[1:55:01] thou killest me
[1:55:03] not for if a man find his enemy will he
[1:55:06] let him go well away so it means you're
[1:55:08] really really you're you're not my enemy
[1:55:11] wherefore the Lord reward the good for
[1:55:13] that thou Hast done unto me this day and
[1:55:16] listen to Saul's words for now behold
[1:55:21] I know well that thou shalt surely be
[1:55:25] king sa is a Believer this is this is
[1:55:28] the believer
[1:55:29] talking I know you're going to be
[1:55:32] kinging and that the Kingdom of Israel
[1:55:34] shall be established in nine hand swear
[1:55:39] now between me and the evil spirit
[1:55:41] coming back upon me while I talking
[1:55:43] sense swear now therefore unto me by the
[1:55:46] Lord that thou will not cut off my seed
[1:55:48] after me and that dog will not destroy
[1:55:50] my name out of my father's house and
[1:55:53] David swear unto Saul and Saul went home
[1:55:55] but David and his men got up unto the
[1:56:00] hold and that leads us to the verse we
[1:56:04] started with and Samuel
[1:56:08] died but David is no
[1:56:11] fool because after 25 is 26 and 26 but
[1:56:16] Claren Saul tried to kill him
[1:56:18] again
[1:56:21] so the context of the
[1:56:22] situation sister Oliver is that David
[1:56:25] couldn't even attend the
[1:56:28] funeral he was still a wanted man he's
[1:56:31] still a fugitive he don't know who to
[1:56:34] trust save his 600 men men who had been
[1:56:38] through some stuff like ABA whose family
[1:56:41] was killed when all the priests were
[1:56:42] killed men who had debts men who had
[1:56:45] trouble men who were Outcast men who had
[1:56:47] crossed all family the wrong way over
[1:56:50] time David had been walking with these
[1:56:51] 600 men the burden of leadership was
[1:56:54] upon this young man he had no fixed
[1:56:56] place of aboard he Throne is his promise
[1:56:58] but the Wilderness is his
[1:57:02] home from point of the Wilderness to
[1:57:04] point of the Wilderness he is
[1:57:06] moving trying to find someplace to
[1:57:09] go it's it's not easy but a hue to feed
[1:57:12] 600
[1:57:14] men all of this is weighing down on
[1:57:17] David he is under stress he didn't grow
[1:57:21] up in a royal family he didn't grow up
[1:57:22] in a big family he is there and he's
[1:57:25] trying to reason and he's trying to
[1:57:26] figure out and what do I do with these
[1:57:27] 600 men who all they could do is fight
[1:57:30] these are warriors now 600
[1:57:32] Warriors so the Bible says now let's go
[1:57:35] and Samuel died and all the Israelites
[1:57:37] were gathered and lamented him and
[1:57:38] buried him in his house of Rama and
[1:57:40] David
[1:57:41] arose a great man died and a great man
[1:57:44] Rose and went down to the Wilderness of
[1:57:48] Paran and there was a man in my own
[1:57:51] whose possessions were in
[1:57:53] carel so there's a man in my own whose
[1:57:56] possession were in caral that is like
[1:57:57] saying you're living in ARA and you're
[1:57:59] business in pter Spain I want to paint
[1:58:01] the picture
[1:58:04] here and the man was very great now when
[1:58:07] the Bible says you're great you're great
[1:58:09] Stephen when the Bible say you're very
[1:58:11] great you're very great there's great
[1:58:13] and it's very great if God said the man
[1:58:15] is very great he's very
[1:58:17] great and he had 3,000 sheep and a
[1:58:20] thousand goats and he was sharing his
[1:58:22] sheep in camel so he's in MA lives there
[1:58:25] but his possession in caramel and he
[1:58:27] sharing his sheep in
[1:58:30] carel there's no question he's great so
[1:58:32] this chapter we are reading so far has
[1:58:34] introduced to us three great men the
[1:58:36] great man Samuel the great man David and
[1:58:38] now this great man who we have not named
[1:58:41] just yet but he we know he's a great man
[1:58:44] not just great but the Bible calls him a
[1:58:46] very great and he's sharing his sheep
[1:58:49] and and the process of sheep sharing at
[1:58:50] that day friends was a big event because
[1:58:53] sharing of the sheep men they were
[1:58:54] cutting off all the W from the Sheep
[1:58:56] it's a process sheep was the currency of
[1:58:59] wealth at that day so the man who had
[1:59:01] plenty sheep had plenty money plenty
[1:59:04] wealth plenty status and the Sheep
[1:59:07] sharing brought with it a whole
[1:59:09] celebration the culture of the day is
[1:59:11] when there is sheep sharing going on you
[1:59:13] will cook big food invite the village
[1:59:16] invite those who are less fortunate it's
[1:59:18] like a whole Cale a because hey we
[1:59:20] sharing the
[1:59:21] Sheep but when in that moment it
[1:59:24] attracted all kind of ragam muffins too
[1:59:27] so it was a whole thing with protecting
[1:59:28] the process of the sheep in preparation
[1:59:31] for the Sheep sharing and the the result
[1:59:33] of the sheep sharing anybody with me I
[1:59:36] know we do a ship here in Trin but the
[1:59:37] ship sharing for all the young people
[1:59:39] who really
[1:59:42] didn't the Sheep growing its wool
[1:59:45] growing growing growing and after a
[1:59:46] while you have to cut it off in fact it
[1:59:48] said that if you don't cut it off in the
[1:59:49] summer time they could die because they
[1:59:51] get so hot and warm that they would die
[1:59:53] so it's a process of wealth the the the
[1:59:56] the wool would be cut and turn into
[1:59:57] fabric the milk and the meats some of
[2:00:00] them will be killed so you could have
[2:00:01] some good food and all this this good
[2:00:02] stuff right so let's go now the name of
[2:00:05] the man was nabal and this word naal
[2:00:07] I've done a Bible study in this before
[2:00:09] but I want to look at it another way now
[2:00:11] the name of the man was nabal and this
[2:00:12] word nabal by translation means fool so
[2:00:15] his parents know what he was
[2:00:18] doing
[2:00:20] because they named him
[2:00:21] fool so I want to make a point here now
[2:00:24] this is a very great
[2:00:28] fool so foolishness is not limited to
[2:00:31] people who have small stature you could
[2:00:33] be a very great fool you could be a very
[2:00:35] educated fool you could be a very
[2:00:37] wealthy fool let's make no mistake about
[2:00:40] it so the Bible has established that he
[2:00:43] is very great but the Bible now says
[2:00:45] that the name of the man was neighbor
[2:00:48] which means he's a fool
[2:00:50] and the name of his wife
[2:00:51] Abigail and she was a woman of good
[2:00:54] understanding and of beautiful
[2:00:56] countenance how does a woman of good
[2:00:58] understanding and of beautiful
[2:01:00] countenance end up with a
[2:01:05] fool we live in a world where women want
[2:01:08] to be of good
[2:01:11] countenance beautiful
[2:01:14] countenance but the Bible makes a
[2:01:16] distinction about Abigail that she is
[2:01:19] a combination of a beautiful countenance
[2:01:22] but of good
[2:01:23] understanding it is more important to be
[2:01:26] a woman of good understanding and a
[2:01:28] woman of beautiful
[2:01:32] countenance we getting somewhere this
[2:01:33] morning yeah we going we say the party I
[2:01:36] think the party start a little
[2:01:39] bit so we have a woman of good
[2:01:41] understanding are you a woman of good
[2:01:43] understanding all the all the sisters in
[2:01:44] the house are you a woman of good
[2:01:46] understanding we are all beautifully and
[2:01:48] wonderfully and and wonderfully and
[2:01:49] fearfully made so all everybody
[2:01:51] according to scripture have the good
[2:01:53] countenance part the good understanding
[2:01:54] part I trying to get to this
[2:01:56] morning but we do know based on
[2:01:59] scripture the fact they highlight
[2:02:00] Abigail's good continence men she was a
[2:02:02] little above
[2:02:04] average if you could say such a thing in
[2:02:06] scripture because the Bible take note of
[2:02:09] this point anybody with me all right I
[2:02:13] didn't say it there I'm just a messenger
[2:02:15] don't get EX with me take it up with
[2:02:17] management I didn't write the book the
[2:02:19] book wrote
[2:02:23] it of but the but the man was
[2:02:27] chish I mean he rude he have real bad
[2:02:29] attitude very great but
[2:02:33] rude very wealty but the man attitude
[2:02:40] stinks and evil in his
[2:02:42] doings and he was and look at it he was
[2:02:46] of the House of Caleb in other words he
[2:02:49] saying listen the same Caleb who say
[2:02:52] give me my
[2:02:53] mountain in other words he from a good
[2:02:56] house you
[2:02:58] know but his house had no bearing on the
[2:03:01] way he grew up this man is a
[2:03:04] rascal so you could be from the best
[2:03:06] house but
[2:03:07] George your house and your lineage but a
[2:03:10] Hugh don't turn into a good man you know
[2:03:13] he had to forsake the teachings of his
[2:03:15] father's father's fathers all the way
[2:03:17] back to the man called kale
[2:03:21] anybody with
[2:03:25] me and David heard in the wilderness
[2:03:28] that nabal did share his sheep so David
[2:03:30] there give you the burden now the
[2:03:32] context the drama all we talked about
[2:03:35] already happened with David the the
[2:03:36] attempted assassinations the stress all
[2:03:39] the pressure seeing the priest killed
[2:03:41] David is close to his breaking point he
[2:03:45] is hungry he is tired he's frustrated
[2:03:48] ated he is wary and we all get wary
[2:03:52] sometimes and David say okay where are
[2:03:54] we going to go what are we going to do
[2:03:57] the men say David we love you but we
[2:04:00] hungry David wherever you're going we
[2:04:02] going in no but of course let we go some
[2:04:04] somewhere we get some food now where we
[2:04:06] where we could sleep and rest at
[2:04:08] night verse four and David heard in the
[2:04:11] wilderness that Nabor did share his
[2:04:13] sheep and it goes on to explain this
[2:04:15] later on but by verse five and David
[2:04:18] sent out 10 young men and David said
[2:04:21] unto the young men get you up to camel
[2:04:24] and go to nabal and greet him in my
[2:04:30] name and thus shall he say to him that
[2:04:33] liveth in prosperity it's a powerful
[2:04:36] statement what do you tell somebody who
[2:04:38] has
[2:04:39] money what do they need what is a man
[2:04:42] who have money need so David now is is
[2:04:45] is is in the same way he was gracious to
[2:04:48] Saul in in the same way he is into the
[2:04:50] spirit of discernment a man after God's
[2:04:52] Own Heart he say tell this man that
[2:04:54] don't need material
[2:04:56] things these
[2:04:58] things Hallelujah peace be both to
[2:05:02] thee peace be to thine house and peace
[2:05:07] be unto all that thou Hast David is very
[2:05:10] conscious that you could have money and
[2:05:12] have no peace you could have prosperity
[2:05:14] and have no peace you could have a good
[2:05:16] job and have no peace you could have
[2:05:19] education and have no peace you could
[2:05:21] have all anything you want in the world
[2:05:23] and have no peace so the best thing I
[2:05:26] could give to this man that I know that
[2:05:28] he would need is
[2:05:31] peace greet him in
[2:05:35] peace anybody looking for peace this
[2:05:41] morning it is better to be on a on a on
[2:05:44] a on a mat on the ground with peace than
[2:05:46] to be on the best bed without peace
[2:05:48] because with peace you could sleep with
[2:05:51] peace you could rest because people
[2:05:53] sleeping without
[2:05:55] rest peace in the valley peace in the
[2:05:58] midst of the storm peace when the doctor
[2:06:00] say I don't know what's going on with
[2:06:02] you Lord give me peace when I get bad
[2:06:04] news I rather have peace than money
[2:06:06] because peace is more precious than
[2:06:10] Prosperity the peace in my mind and my
[2:06:13] heart to know my children in trouble but
[2:06:15] God give me peace that everything is
[2:06:17] going to work out and all things will
[2:06:18] together for good and peace to know that
[2:06:20] the mighty hand of God could deliver
[2:06:22] them peace to know that in the middle of
[2:06:24] my trouble the Great Mighty hand of
[2:06:27] Jehovah could reach out and open doors
[2:06:29] [Applause]
[2:06:32] and David is not doing this for sure
[2:06:35] he's not trying to make an impression he
[2:06:37] is genuinely in the midst of his
[2:06:39] situation saying oh God what would this
[2:06:41] man need I don't have money I don't have
[2:06:43] food I don't have anything to give him
[2:06:45] but just giving the only thing I could
[2:06:47] give him because as as a type of Christ
[2:06:49] David understood what peace
[2:06:53] was Jesus is called the Prince of Peace
[2:06:56] tell this man peace not just peace to
[2:07:00] him peace both to thee peace be to thine
[2:07:04] house peace be unto all thy H peace be
[2:07:08] unto your staff peace be unto your
[2:07:10] household peace be unto your children
[2:07:12] peace be unto your cattle peace be unto
[2:07:15] your land peace be so these young men
[2:07:18] would have walked up Sister Jenny with a
[2:07:21] confident message to carry to
[2:07:25] nabal 10 men talking on the way up the
[2:07:28] road you say any peace be to your house
[2:07:31] part I'll say any peace be unto your
[2:07:32] family you say peace be unto your land
[2:07:34] who saying it you saying it no practice
[2:07:36] it peace be no not no do it stay these
[2:07:39] young men practiceing because they're
[2:07:41] going up to a great man's
[2:07:45] house they haven't had much opportunity
[2:07:47] to interact with great men because could
[2:07:49] have been running they've been hiding
[2:07:50] they've been anybody with me caves and
[2:07:52] Tents and these things they have spent
[2:07:54] days Days in the
[2:07:56] wilderness I wonder what kind of man NE
[2:07:59] is and a hungry boy hope I wonder if you
[2:08:01] give you something now boy you think we
[2:08:03] can eat it before we car back for David
[2:08:06] go all be hungry you think we have to

[2:08:09] carry for David first sh till we can eat
[2:08:10] it on the way down until we just tickle
[2:08:14] appetizer all of this brother car I want
[2:08:17] you to picture the picture
[2:08:23] peace be unto all our house that and
[2:08:25] verse S and now I have heard so David is
[2:08:27] this whole message so after the peace
[2:08:29] the salutation of Peace as it were verse
[2:08:32] 7 and now I have heard that thou Hast
[2:08:34] sharers now thy Shepherds which were
[2:08:37] with us so he's informing nabal of a
[2:08:40] turn of events now thy Shepherds which
[2:08:43] were with us we Hur them not in other
[2:08:46] words if we wanted it by force we could
[2:08:48] have take it
[2:08:49] we heard them not neither was their
[2:08:51] ought missing there was nothing misses
[2:08:53] unto them all the while they were in

[2:08:59] our word for it ask thy young men and
[2:09:02] they will show thee wherefor let the

[2:09:17] food it's a good day we come you know we
[2:09:18] come a day when you're
[2:09:20] struggling we come in a good day give I
[2:09:23] pray thee

[2:09:28] ask we're not telling you what to give
[2:09:29] us just give us something we
[2:09:32] hungry you see the picture here we
[2:09:36] hungry give a pray whatever come to th
[2:09:38] hand unto thy servant andto thy son
[2:09:40] David David sent a a group of men to
[2:09:42] convey with as much humility as much
[2:09:44] respect as much background as much
[2:09:46] context as possible he he making no
[2:09:49] demand he's been sincere he's been
[2:09:51] honest and he sent his message to
[2:09:53] nabal and when David's young men came
[2:09:56] they spake to nabal according to all
[2:09:59] those words in the name of David and
[2:10:01] ceased so they said everything that
[2:10:03] David told them to
[2:10:05] say and nabal answered David's servant
[2:10:08] and said who is
[2:10:10] David and then you could see his
[2:10:13] political allegiance and who is the son
[2:10:16] of
[2:10:17] Jesse when last you heard that all true
[2:10:20] Saul Camp is who is this Jesse son he
[2:10:23] goes
[2:10:24] further there be many servants
[2:10:28] nowadays that break every man from his
[2:10:33] master in other words he's saying he a
[2:10:35] really asking who is David and know he
[2:10:37] say who is who is this David
[2:10:39] Fell and he's supposed to be in Saul
[2:10:41] Court how come we ready I don't know if
[2:10:44] I
[2:10:45] want anybody with me and it's not as if
[2:10:48] D nabal would know because everybody
[2:10:51] know what Samuel said everybody know
[2:10:53] because the Bible said that Saul knew
[2:10:55] that God was with David so it's not
[2:10:57] uncommon knowledge everybody know David
[2:11:00] the Bible said it his name was spread
[2:11:02] all around and here is this man who's in
[2:11:03] a position to help saying who is
[2:11:07] David and who is the son of Jesse that
[2:11:10] there be many servers nowadays who break
[2:11:12] away from from his master is is is is
[2:11:15] this David still under salt inspiration
[2:11:19] come on is he still under wasn't he
[2:11:21] under Saul's
[2:11:23] Ministry who his master that plenty that
[2:11:25] break we break we
[2:11:28] breakway
[2:11:30] CL hallelujah look look look at the
[2:11:32] context so neor nebor is into politics
[2:11:36] now he's not acting like a man who
[2:11:39] seeing hungry people he's saying what
[2:11:40] church what church David in
[2:11:42] now who is David plenty people leaving
[2:11:46] church and
[2:11:47] thing
[2:11:49] people leaving their master and think
[2:11:51] who's this this David and who is Jesse's
[2:11:53] son he quoting things he here in sa Camp
[2:11:56] I'm painting the picture this is this is
[2:11:58] this is no thing I talking this is not
[2:11:59] but but but the mic this is not years
[2:12:01] ago thing we talking happen
[2:12:04] now how David could do that how David
[2:12:06] could start the own thing David have 600
[2:12:09] men in the wilderness we can't find him
[2:12:11] we don't know where the church is we
[2:12:12] don't going the church he moving I'm
[2:12:13] here there
[2:12:17] everywhere
[2:12:21] and look at verse 11
[2:12:22] now listen to the spirit of the man now
[2:12:26] shall I singular personal pronoun take
[2:12:29] my bread and my water and my flesh that
[2:12:35] I have killed for my sharers and give it
[2:12:38] unto men whom I know not when they
[2:12:42] be what kind of I me my my i i i i they
[2:12:47] like Lucifer I shall arise I shall I
[2:12:50] shall Ascend I shall do
[2:12:52] this totally lacking the fact that the
[2:12:54] Earth the Sheep everything is God own
[2:12:56] totally forgetting that you are just a
[2:12:58] steward it's not your you don't own
[2:13:01] nothing see what you're carrying put you
[2:13:03] in a box and see where carrying with you

[2:13:11] water can can we talk a little
[2:13:14] bit my bread my water my flesh my
[2:13:20] sharers
[2:13:22] Hallelujah so you can imagine how these

[2:17:28] whatever it was it was just the Tipping
[2:17:31] Point and here it was we see David after
[2:17:34] all the pressure by the George now reach
[2:17:37] here's the first time David is stepping
[2:17:39] out of
[2:17:42] character now bear in mind friends nebor
[2:17:45] owe them
[2:17:46] anything
[2:17:48] nabal has no obligation to give them
[2:17:52] anything nabal they didn't work and have
[2:17:55] a contract with with with naal and D
[2:17:57] supposed to pay them and he refused to
[2:17:58] pay them they volunteer to do what they
[2:18:01] do and here it is David is so angry he
[2:18:04] is
[2:18:06] angry he reaches breaking
[2:18:11] point you say everybody G up your
[2:18:15] sword and they ging on every man his
[2:18:18] sword this is verse 13 and David also
[2:18:20] good in on his
[2:18:21] sword so David said this it fellas we go
[2:18:24] and eat today and everybody
[2:18:27] dead and they went up after David so
[2:18:30] David not letting men go in front and
[2:18:32] leading him and know David leading this
[2:18:34] thing as a angry man leading 400 angry
[2:18:37] hungry men who had been running for
[2:18:40] their lives living in the wilderness and
[2:18:42] they are angry and they're about to kill
[2:18:45] everybody anybody with me
[2:18:49] amen ging on every man his sword and
[2:18:52] David also ging up his sword and there
[2:18:54] went after David about 400 men and 200
[2:18:58] by the stuff it was 600 200 stay
[2:19:00] back and 400 riding up with David but
[2:19:04] one of the young men this is one of
[2:19:06] nabal's young men told Abigail nabal's
[2:19:09] wife saying
[2:19:12] behold David sent Messengers out of the
[2:19:14] Wilderness to salute our master and he
[2:19:17] raised nailed on
[2:19:19] them so this little brother thank God
[2:19:22] for this little boy without no name is a
[2:19:24] big part of the story we don't know his
[2:19:25] name but this man saved
[2:19:29] everybody if there some people have to
[2:19:31] meet is people like this because this
[2:19:33] young man if he didn't do that this
[2:19:35] whole story of David would be a very
[2:19:37] different story he say Abigail hear this
[2:19:40] now man David sent 10 men they went to
[2:19:43] the boss you know how boss is and he
[2:19:45] railed on them listen isn't it the young
[2:19:49] man but the men were very good unto us
[2:19:53] so this is a young man who was out there
[2:19:55] in the wilderness and we were not hurt
[2:19:58] neither missed we anything so this is
[2:20:00] the firstand testimony That nabal was
[2:20:02] supposed to get that he refused to get
[2:20:04] because of his arrogant polit political
[2:20:07] foolishness as long as we were
[2:20:09] conversant with them we had fellowship
[2:20:11] with them when we were in the fields
[2:20:14] they were a wall unto us hallelujah both
[2:20:17] by night and day all the while we were
[2:20:20] with them keeping the Sheep now
[2:20:23] therefore know and consider what thou
[2:20:25] will do for evil is determined against
[2:20:28] our master so somebody send him a
[2:20:32] WhatsApp whether they told him on the
[2:20:34] way out and say listen boy you know we
[2:20:36] was in the field together run for your
[2:20:38] life we coming back because when David
[2:20:39] hear this he coming they know the State
[2:20:41] of Mind whether it was then whatever it
[2:20:44] was this young this one young M the
[2:20:46] Clarence was the one who we could say
[2:20:47] was closest to them brothers so it was
[2:20:50] in their best in to tell them listen get
[2:20:52] just get just get to the house because
[2:20:54] we don't know how David taking this
[2:20:55] thing so whether it was a smoke signal a
[2:20:57] WhatsApp message a text he know trouble
[2:21:02] coming he had a choice you know he could
[2:21:04] have run for his life and say fire bur
[2:21:06] you know how long I want to get out this
[2:21:07] walk you know how long I look at my
[2:21:09] reason to get this walk let me just head
[2:21:11] out of
[2:21:12] it but he saying to her here for evil is
[2:21:16] determined against our master and
[2:21:19] against all his house household for he
[2:21:21] is such a son of Bal so he's describing
[2:21:25] neor as a son of Bel means what we say
[2:21:27] in J here he wless that's the
[2:21:30] translation there he's a wless man a
[2:21:32] waste of time talking to him that's what
[2:21:34] he's saying here right that a man cannot
[2:21:36] speak to
[2:21:37] him so coming to you Abigail oh God
[2:21:40] thank God for the abigailes you
[2:21:42] know because nobody could talk to this
[2:21:45] man he's a very great man but this
[2:21:47] foolish worthless man
[2:21:50] nobody I hope there are no men in your
[2:21:53] here that nobody could talk to
[2:21:58] you you see said some lessons inside of
[2:22:01] here let it not be said about you nobody
[2:22:03] could talk to you you know no I be
[2:22:06] honest I know some people that nobody
[2:22:07] can talk to them and then people will
[2:22:09] tell you don't talk to me you know they
[2:22:11] would tell you they don't let let it be
[2:22:13] said they would tell you I don't like
[2:22:15] nobody telling me nothing don't talk to
[2:22:16] me
[2:22:18] so the servant is saying you know you
[2:22:20] know you living with the man you know
[2:22:22] nobody can talk to
[2:22:24] him then Abigail made haste I love that
[2:22:28] one piece of Crypt right there listen
[2:22:30] what a note here friends is Abigail
[2:22:32] Eddie fendy
[2:22:34] man say how you could talk

[2:22:40] was a wife like Safar who you talking
[2:22:42] about you talking about my husband
[2:22:46] so
[2:22:47] the Bible said Abigail made haste
[2:22:50] friends some of us moving too
[2:22:54] slowly Abigail made haste and we'll see
[2:22:56] how this is
[2:22:57] important Abigail made haste and took
[2:23:00] 200 Loaves and two bottles of wine and
[2:23:04] five sheep ready
[2:23:07] dressed and five measures of parched
[2:23:10] corn and a 100 clusters of raisins and
[2:23:14] 200 cakes of figs and laid them on asses
[2:23:17] and she said unto her servants go on
[2:23:19] before me in other words carry that just
[2:23:24] go behold I come after you but she told
[2:23:28] not her husband
[2:23:30] nebor and it was so as she rode on the
[2:23:33] ass and she came down by the covert of
[2:23:36] the hill and behold David and his men
[2:23:38] came down against her and she met them
[2:23:39] so want you see this this encounter
[2:23:42] we're not going to be too much longer
[2:23:43] with you but it see the encounter 400
[2:23:45] angry men led by D David coming up to
[2:23:48] kill they just have one motive to kill
[2:23:50] everything and here comes some donkeys
[2:23:53] with food and a crazy looking beautiful
[2:23:56] woman racing down instead of running
[2:24:00] away from danger she is running into not
[2:24:04] 2 5 10 20 25 400 angry men all with
[2:24:09] swords coming up moving at PACE this is
[2:24:11] Pace meeting Pace because she's moving
[2:24:14] fast and David moving fast because you
[2:24:15] know when you're angry people just move
[2:24:17] super
[2:24:18] faster Vex we don't move slow you a slow
[2:24:21] vexed
[2:24:23] person we will Mar that it taking
[2:24:26] throwing something and be like how you
[2:24:27] moving you don't ever move so
[2:24:30] fast David is Angry Men angry and and
[2:24:33] and I want you to picture this this
[2:24:35] clash as it were of
[2:24:36] armies 400 led by David and a brave
[2:24:41] courageous spiritual woman of
[2:24:45] understanding Hallelujah give us more
[2:24:47] women of understanding who will fight
[2:24:49] for their
[2:24:51] houses especially when the man of the
[2:24:54] house don't want to do his
[2:24:55] [Applause]
[2:24:59] work in the face of danger she's going
[2:25:02] in the face a danger as it
[2:25:08] were she met them verse 20 verse 21 now
[2:25:12] David had said so now it's going into
[2:25:13] what David thinking is so this is what
[2:25:16] David had said to himself his men now
[2:25:18] David is said surely in vain so this is
[2:25:20] this is this is David venting this is
[2:25:23] David relating and this is many of us
[2:25:26] parents this is many of us
[2:25:28] Believers when you do something and you
[2:25:31] wonder if people appreciate
[2:25:34] it when you do something and you feel no
[2:25:38] gratitude when you do something and you
[2:25:40] feel no kind of appreciation because old
[2:25:42] David was asking God I help you a little
[2:25:44] thanks now so David they saying surely
[2:25:47] in vain you know many parents I here say
[2:25:49] say say this in some form or the other I
[2:25:52] I don't don't I waste time with them
[2:25:53] Ching
[2:25:55] know if they only understand the
[2:25:58] sacrifice I
[2:26:00] make when I bur my belly and I didn't do
[2:26:03] things I wanted to do to send them to
[2:26:05] school and I pay for extra and they have
[2:26:06] no idea the the I went to the credit
[2:26:08] union and I did this thing and I did
[2:26:10] that I work extra and I do overtime and
[2:26:13] all kind of anybody could anybody
[2:26:15] understand what I'm talking about
[2:26:18] this is the reality of life we dealing
[2:26:19] with to know so David is talking like so
[2:26:21] many of
[2:26:24] us see not making sense or
[2:26:29] nobody surely in vain have I kept all
[2:26:32] that this Fellow Heart in the wilderness
[2:26:35] I feel like I waste my time it's better
[2:26:37] I went to the next Village it's better
[2:26:39] do our next thing it's better I didn't
[2:26:40] know children it's better I had one
[2:26:42] child it's better I had two better I
[2:26:44] give it to somebody else better I send a
[2:26:45] neighbor to school
[2:26:50] anybody can
[2:26:52] relate I pay for you to go to school and
[2:26:54] you come up with
[2:26:58] nothing this is the reality of life here
[2:27:00] you
[2:27:03] know I sent you to school for friends
[2:27:06] you went to school for friends I I were
[2:27:08] you there for
[2:27:10] friends where where where your homework
[2:27:13] why your report card so all the report
[2:27:16] card have is games games games surely in
[2:27:19] vain this is David and it applies to any
[2:27:21] part of our Lives that's why I say this
[2:27:23] gospel is a real thing you
[2:27:25] know this is David at his breaking point
[2:27:28] so the issue here friends is not just
[2:27:30] neighbor's issue the issue is this is a
[2:27:33] pent up this is David saying a fight for
[2:27:36] Saul and look how he treat me it is now
[2:27:39] bottled up in this
[2:27:42] moment anything Soul asked me to do I
[2:27:44] did it and he said to kill me and this
[2:27:45] no just enable and I com everything is
[2:27:47] wrapped up so I want you to understand
[2:27:49] the context is not just limited to the
[2:27:51] enal encounter it's the issues of Life
[2:27:55] gathered all together at that moment for
[2:27:58] David and when that happens we all need
[2:28:01] an
[2:28:03] Abigail if you don't have an Abigail you
[2:28:06] are in
[2:28:13] trouble surely in vain have I kept all
[2:28:16] that this fellow hat in the wilderness
[2:28:18] so that nothing was missed at all
[2:28:20] pertained unto him and he has requited
[2:28:22] me evil for
[2:28:24] good so and more also do God unto the
[2:28:28] enemies of David he just named The Man
[2:28:30] an enemy of David he's so upset he
[2:28:33] pulling back prophecies and everything
[2:28:36] if I leave all that pertain to him by
[2:28:38] the Morning Light any that piss it
[2:28:40] against the wall that is men standing up
[2:28:44] right so every man dead
[2:28:47] if you stand up to piss you're dead that
[2:28:49] what you saying
[2:28:52] here if you're looking like a man you're
[2:28:55] dead be careful
[2:28:58] sisters anything looking like a man are
[2:29:03] killing be
[2:29:09] careful and when Abigail saw David she
[2:29:12] hasted again speed watch your speed she
[2:29:14] haste to pack she haste to him so I want
[2:29:17] you to understand the contrast the shock
[2:29:19] to David because this woman is not
[2:29:20] tentative in her
[2:29:22] approach she is running to him so she
[2:29:24] she run to David soon you see him she
[2:29:26] speed
[2:29:31] up and she lighted off the ass and fell
[2:29:34] before David on her
[2:29:37] face so she used her
[2:29:41] countenance uhuh she use her
[2:29:44] beauty this is not the time for
[2:29:48] beauty you ever see a a a angry man beat
[2:29:51] up a beautiful
[2:29:53] wife go talk to the Social Services all
[2:29:56] of them who feel the the beauty is what
[2:29:57] the thing
[2:30:00] is men with money tell their beauty gets
[2:30:02] boring you know well I don't want to go
[2:30:05] into that to this not not not not this
[2:30:09] morning you young sisters if all you're
[2:30:11] fighting for is
[2:30:13] looks looks Fades quickly you know not
[2:30:16] just look of looks to no but the value
[2:30:18] of looks because when men come into a
[2:30:20] position of Crisis they need a woman of
[2:30:24] understanding when they meet a cross
[2:30:27] with a decision your beauty can't figure
[2:30:28] out the mortgage and your beauty can't
[2:30:30] figure out the next career move your be
[2:30:33] come on now somebody talk back to
[2:30:34] [Applause]
[2:30:36] me when real decisions are made it has
[2:30:39] nothing to looks can you help me decide
[2:30:41] the next
[2:30:42] move because the woman's supposed to be
[2:30:44] a helpmate
[2:30:47] to help Adam when God look at Adam he
[2:30:49] say it's not good for man he needs some
[2:30:51] help it's a blessing if you look
[2:30:53] beautiful but make sure you're a woman
[2:30:55] of
[2:30:58] understanding that's real value to bring
[2:31:00] to the
[2:31:02] table anybody with me this
[2:31:09] morning she fell before David on her
[2:31:12] face a rich
[2:31:13] woman a powerful woman a woman with
[2:31:16] servants a woman with help a woman with
[2:31:19] soldiers a woman of prestige a woman of
[2:31:22] status a beautiful woman a woman of
[2:31:24] understanding fell to her face and bowed
[2:31:27] herself to the
[2:31:28] ground reverence humility
[2:31:34] respect bless this
[2:31:39] woman and in that moment the respect
[2:31:42] because clearly she was a woman of
[2:31:44] understanding and respect even to her
[2:31:45] foolish
[2:31:47] husband but here she had the opportunity
[2:31:49] to show respect and reverence to a man
[2:31:52] who was not her husband but good Lord
[2:31:54] this is a king and we'll get to
[2:31:57] it and fell at his
[2:32:01] feet and this is mind-blowing friends to
[2:32:04] show a type of Christ a type of the
[2:32:05] Bride so many things TI in here this
[2:32:08] woman stood there and said upon me my
[2:32:10] Lord upon me let this iniquity be
[2:32:14] Abigail said hear this if you want to
[2:32:16] kill
[2:32:17] anybody kill me put it on me don't go no
[2:32:21] further this wrong that you feel wrong
[2:32:23] is on
[2:32:27] me this reminds me of Abraham when God
[2:32:30] say I've reached my break with God God
[2:32:32] reaches his Breaking Point too he say
[2:32:33] I've come to the end with Sodom and
[2:32:35] Gomorrah I come to wipe them out and
[2:32:37] David say Lord hold up hold up hold up
[2:32:40] if there be
[2:32:41] 50 David Abraham sorry put himself
[2:32:44] between God and Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:32:46] because he have family there so here
[2:32:49] Abigail standing just like Abraham not a
[2:32:52] prophet not a king not a priest but a
[2:32:53] woman of God standing between judgment
[2:32:57] and her
[2:33:01] house and say upon me let this iniquity
[2:33:03] be upon me just like Moses because when
[2:33:05] God saw the gold the gold and calf he
[2:33:07] said I'm going to wipe them out and
[2:33:09] build a new house under you Moses and
[2:33:11] Moses that remind you but God remember
[2:33:13] your promise to Abraham and to Isaac and
[2:33:14] to Jacob and everybody else and
[2:33:16] and the Bible says in Exodus 32 God
[2:33:18] repented of his thought to destroy all
[2:33:21] of Israel because Moses stood in the Gap
[2:33:23] give us more mothers and fathers who
[2:33:25] will stand in the gap between judgment
[2:33:28] and their
[2:33:32] house this is not politics this is not
[2:33:35] game this is real because Abigail
[2:33:36] understood that death was on the
[2:33:43] door let this iniquity be and let that
[2:33:46] thine handmade I pray thee speak in
[2:33:48] thine audience and hear the words of
[2:33:52] thine
[2:33:53] handmade let not my Lord I pray thee
[2:33:57] regard this man of bellel look at her
[2:34:01] approach she said don't regard this
[2:34:04] wless
[2:34:07] man God even naal for as his name
[2:34:12] is so is
[2:34:15] he the man named fool he's a fool what I
[2:34:19] love about Abigail she try to defend him
[2:34:22] she say David he was having a bad day
[2:34:25] David the B the check crash David the
[2:34:27] bank Bus David the business thing she
[2:34:29] had tried to defend nothing again I use
[2:34:32] the parallel and and saf saf know very
[2:34:34] well what they decided to
[2:34:36] do but here is Abigail speaking
[2:34:43] truth even nebor for as his name is so
[2:34:46] he is nabal is his name and Folly is
[2:34:49] with
[2:34:50] him some people are real
[2:34:55] Folly and she was not embarrassed to say
[2:34:57] it brother Clarence I was hearing a
[2:34:59] school teacher speak and the school
[2:35:01] teacher was saying is really something
[2:35:02] else when they talk to parents in the
[2:35:05] PTA meetings because they would tell the
[2:35:08] parents your child this your child that
[2:35:09] and your child that and the parents is
[2:35:11] be saying
[2:35:12] nah mm and his parents he say they know
[2:35:15] that what
[2:35:17] lless and he says it is so much better
[2:35:20] the parents say you know you're right
[2:35:21] how can we work to fix
[2:35:24] it versus trying to cover up so I want
[2:35:26] to make a point here there's too much
[2:35:28] covering up abig try to cover up nebor
[2:35:31] she say the man named fool he's a fool
[2:35:33] and Folly if I tell you now how much
[2:35:36] Folly I went
[2:35:41] through but I th handmade saw not the
[2:35:45] young men of my my Lord whom thou did in
[2:35:47] other words if I was there if I was in
[2:35:50] the house I just went did run to some
[2:35:52] seasoning for all the lamb they want to
[2:35:54] cook I wasn't home if I was home and I
[2:35:57] saw those young men this was not going
[2:35:59] to be the
[2:36:00] situation verse 26 now therefore my Lord
[2:36:04] as the Lord liveth and as thy Soul
[2:36:07] liveth seeing the Lord had withheld thee
[2:36:10] from coming to shed blood so she already
[2:36:12] speaking into the
[2:36:13] prophetic she is already speaking in
[2:36:16] last 10 say seeing that the Lord has
[2:36:17] already held your hand she not telling
[2:36:20] him to hold your hand anymore know
[2:36:22] seeing that the Lord had already Hold
[2:36:24] Your Hand this what this is this is a
[2:36:26] woman this is a spiritual
[2:36:28] woman and she is speaking to a spiritual
[2:36:31] man who lost his
[2:36:33] way she's speaking to a man who's under
[2:36:35] pressure who's tired who's
[2:36:38] weary so she is speaking is almost like
[2:36:40] all those he called he justified know he
[2:36:42] justified already already speaking in
[2:36:43] past tense seeing that the Lord had
[2:36:45] already with held your hand she already
[2:36:48] considering things done as though they
[2:36:49] were she's already she's already
[2:36:50] speaking in faith anybody with me
[2:36:58] Hallelujah seeing the Lord ha withheld
[2:37:00] the from coming to shed blood two things
[2:37:03] and from avenging thyself with thine own
[2:37:05] hand which we know Vengeance only
[2:37:07] Belongs to the Lord listen friends do
[2:37:09] you understand that according to
[2:37:10] scripture Vengeance only belongs to God
[2:37:13] that as a Christian you could never
[2:37:16] tried to avenge anything only God
[2:37:19] reserved the jurisdiction to
[2:37:22] avenge that the moment you try to do
[2:37:25] retribution or or or or or do any
[2:37:27] settling of the score you are going into
[2:37:29] God's territory that he reserves only
[2:37:31] for
[2:37:34] himself it is not your place or my place
[2:37:36] to bring judgment or to bring that leave
[2:37:39] it up to God to S it out so this is not
[2:37:42] just a woman of of of a house because
[2:37:44] she was able to quickly deter DET how
[2:37:46] much food to pack get the horse get the
[2:37:48] get the donkeys ready she is quick she's
[2:37:49] a manager she's an administrator she
[2:37:52] understand the spiritual Realms she
[2:37:53] speaking in the prophetic she's speaking
[2:37:55] in faith to understand the doctrine that
[2:37:57] is not your place to avenge anybody it's
[2:38:00] not your role to do that kind of stop
[2:38:11] David now therefore my Lord as the Lord
[2:38:14] liveth and as I still live it I'm still
[2:38:15] in verse 26 seeing the Lord has withheld
[2:38:17] thee from coming to shed blood and from
[2:38:19] avenging thyself with thine own hand now
[2:38:22] let thine enemies and they that seek
[2:38:24] Evil My Lord be as neor in other words
[2:38:27] let him be an example let him be an
[2:38:29] example let they be an example in other
[2:38:31] words you don't get involved in that let
[2:38:33] God deal with it and she goes on and now
[2:38:37] this blessing which thine had men had
[2:38:39] brought unto my Lord all this food let
[2:38:42] it even be given unto the young men that
[2:38:44] follow my Lord
[2:38:47] and I can imagine could you imagine
[2:38:49] David angry you know somebody angry they
[2:38:51] start to get red the veins stinging and
[2:38:53] and I can imagine Abigail just cutting
[2:38:57] through cutting through David and his
[2:39:00] steam like letting of the pressure the
[2:39:02] pressure that's coming now and David is
[2:39:04] is mystified he's baffled he don't
[2:39:06] understand what going on here something
[2:39:07] he said what it and all the anger that
[2:39:09] David I just starting to fade
[2:39:13] away I pray thee forgive the trespass of
[2:39:16] thine
[2:39:17] handmade for the Lord will certainly
[2:39:19] make and look at look at she's in the
[2:39:21] prophetic now for the Lord will
[2:39:23] certainly make my Lord a sh house so
[2:39:26] she's speaking into his life in this
[2:39:28] like she is actually quoting Samuel
[2:39:30] there now so Samuel the prophet is dead
[2:39:33] but she was in the books and the
[2:39:34] tapes anybody with me she's in the days
[2:39:37] of the voice of the prophet Samuel she
[2:39:39] in the books and the TI and she's saying
[2:39:40] now David let me remind you of who you
[2:39:42] are let me talk about your past your
[2:39:45] present and your future
[2:39:47] Hallelujah give us more sisters who are
[2:39:49] sensitive to the times the seasons and
[2:39:51] the word for the hour to speak about the
[2:39:53] past the present and the future so she
[2:39:55] goes on in the spiritual realm there I
[2:39:58] pray the forgive the trespass of that in
[2:40:00] in other words forgive what I'm about to
[2:40:02] say don't take this your wrong way David
[2:40:05] I'm saying it out of respect to you all
[2:40:07] right but the Lord will certainly make
[2:40:09] my Lord a sure house because my Lord
[2:40:12] fighted the battles of the Lord and evil
[2:40:14] listen to this had not been found in
[2:40:16] thee all thy
[2:40:18] days so she knows who David is she knows
[2:40:22] David's testimony she knows David's life
[2:40:24] she knows David's Ministry and she knows
[2:40:27] up to this point on there's been no evil
[2:40:30] found in David there's nothing we could
[2:40:32] hold against David there's no
[2:40:34] transgression we could bring there's no
[2:40:36] accusation we could bring against
[2:40:39] David can the church say Amen am verse
[2:40:42] 29 and now it shows that and this is it
[2:40:46] you can be a parent and don't know the
[2:40:47] attack upon your children upon your
[2:40:49] family upon your house what going on in
[2:40:50] the global economy what going on in the
[2:40:52] National scene this woman who was under

[2:41:04] still know what's going on she said yet
[2:41:06] a man is risen to pursue thee talking
[2:41:08] about

[2:41:14] even though she under the Hat a fool she
[2:41:16] not ignorant to the word to the doctrine
[2:41:18] to the season to the time to the hour

[2:41:27] life with the Lord thy God and The Souls
[2:41:30] of thine enemies listen to this one she

[2:41:55] from Goliath is the same God that will

[2:42:55] had spoken concerning thee she was in
[2:42:57] the books and the tapes she knows

[2:43:19] not yet on his throne but he has have a
[2:43:20] certain character to sit upon the
[2:43:23] throne and she knows by Revelation that
[2:43:26] if David does this thing he will bring a
[2:43:28] stain to the

[2:46:32] it'll bother you
[2:46:35] forever it'll be a grief in your
[2:46:42] heart that this shall be no grief under
[2:46:44] thee no no offense of heart unto my Lord
[2:46:46] either listen that thou has shed blood
[2:46:49] causeless in other words how in the
[2:46:51] world you could kill nabal because he
[2:46:53] give you something he never promised to
[2:46:54] give
[2:46:57] you but Abigail having Liv with a
[2:47:01] fool for all her years was able to
[2:47:05] understand what a man was under
[2:47:06] pressure so she had as a woman of
[2:47:09] understanding she could find the right
[2:47:11] words to bring him back down
[2:47:15] and she speaking said David you know you
[2:47:18] know you know you have no cause to do
[2:47:20] this thing two things that this
[2:47:23] have no grief under thee nor offense of
[2:47:24] heart unto my Lord either thou has shed
[2:47:26] blood causeless or that my Lord had
[2:47:28] avenge himself these are two is like if
[2:47:30] you go the court count number one that
[2:47:33] we charging you with is killing Without
[2:47:36] a
[2:47:37] Cause count number two is avenging
[2:47:39] yourself because these are both errors
[2:47:42] these are both wrong she's saying these
[2:47:44] are the two counts that will be held
[2:47:45] against you that thou shed blood
[2:47:47] Costless or that my Lord had avenge
[2:47:49] himself but when the Lord shall shall
[2:47:53] have dealt well with my Lord then
[2:47:55] remember thine handmade so she's saying
[2:47:57] listen when you reach up there remember
[2:48:00] I give you this little
[2:48:02] encouragement remember I help you turn
[2:48:04] your course a little bit and there's
[2:48:05] somebody in this room today who thinking
[2:48:06] of doing the wrong thing who on a Verge
[2:48:08] on a Breaking Point they about to do
[2:48:10] some nonsense and I'm praying that the
[2:48:12] word to you today would be your caution
[2:48:14] saying don't do it I know you're under
[2:48:17] pressure but check back the word and
[2:48:19] hold on to the Anchor of the word about
[2:48:21] what God said about you don't don't

[2:48:28] don't lose your cool now I know you're

[2:48:36] be
[2:48:38] [Applause]
[2:48:42] accomplished we're almost done the
[2:48:43] musician can get ready
[2:48:46] verse 32 and David said unto Abigail
[2:48:49] blessed be the Lord God of
[2:48:53] Israel this woman was talking to a man
[2:48:56] you could talk to because NE can't tell
[2:48:58] him nothing but here is David his
[2:49:00] response he argue he debate this is the
[2:49:04] this is no wonder God is a man after my
[2:49:06] own heart and the Lord said unto Abigail
[2:49:09] blessed be the Lord God of Israel which
[2:49:12] send thee this day to meet me
[2:49:15] in other words you come here but I know
[2:49:17] you just come so the Lord I recognize
[2:49:20] the Lord send you to talk to me
[2:49:23] today and I pray that you recognize is
[2:49:26] the Lord sent me to talk to you
[2:49:28] today David recognized this wasn't
[2:49:30] Abigail talking to
[2:49:33] [Music]
[2:49:37] him blessed be the Lord God of Israel
[2:49:40] which send thee this day to meet me and
[2:49:43] listen Blessed Be Thy
[2:49:47] advice Blessed Be Thy
[2:49:50] advice some you taking advice from wrong
[2:49:53] people and he taking cursed
[2:49:57] advice your advice have a curse in
[2:50:02] it you can't say blessed be the advice
[2:50:04] but the advice is not in line with the
[2:50:06] word this advice is in line with the
[2:50:07] word she was reading from The Prophet's
[2:50:09] message she was saying what the tape say
[2:50:11] right
[2:50:12] here all the words of Samu was inside
[2:50:15] locked up while na in Folly she
[2:50:18] listening to the tapes while Nebel in
[2:50:19] Folly she in the word while Nebel in
[2:50:21] Folly she playing the song Saul killed
[2:50:23] 1,000 David killed 10,000 she know all
[2:50:26] them songs she know David by time she
[2:50:28] already in spirit
[2:50:30] anything anybody with me this
[2:50:33] morning so the advice that comes from a
[2:50:35] person in the word is blessed
[2:50:38] advice when my coworker tell me so and
[2:50:41] so the coworkers even sa they know they
[2:50:42] know God they have any Revelation what
[2:50:44] what what is is their source of Supply
[2:50:46] where they fishing from where they
[2:50:48] getting it from and you wonder why I
[2:50:50] keep hitting your head against you wall
[2:50:52] David a man after God's Own Heart to
[2:50:54] look at that woman who in that day a
[2:50:56] woman speaking to a King was a rare
[2:50:57] thing to see yeah so David is just being
[2:51:00] shocked that this woman is different to
[2:51:02] run into her Army to run up to her
[2:51:04] future
[2:51:05] king one who mad and angry about to kill
[2:51:08] he about to fight he about to kill and
[2:51:10] he said blessed be the god I I recognize
[2:51:12] you here but it's God who sent you
[2:51:14] blessed be your
[2:51:17] advice blessed be thou he say you are
[2:51:19] all
[2:51:20] blessed which has kept me this day from
[2:51:24] coming to shed blood and from avenging
[2:51:27] myself with my own hand and David
[2:51:30] reinforces her
[2:51:33] understanding and he says openly for in
[2:51:36] very deed he say as the Lord God of
[2:51:39] Israel live it which had kept me back
[2:51:42] from hurting thee he was saying you you
[2:51:44] and all was going to get it except thou
[2:51:47] had hasted in other words if you didn't
[2:51:49] come this fast to me you might be able
[2:51:52] to stop me that's how angry I
[2:51:55] am anybody with me David saying if you
[2:51:59] had moved any slower you
[2:52:02] dead no wonder the prophet say when the
[2:52:05] angel of the Lord is in the house and
[2:52:07] you want to receive him say stand up
[2:52:08] quickly to receive the
[2:52:10] healing he said move quickly don't move
[2:52:13] slow if you're a call to the altar run
[2:52:15] to the altar don't walk you don't run to
[2:52:17] the altar move quickly some of us move
[2:52:18] too
[2:52:20] slow so David is saying to her you're so
[2:52:23] blessed you don't even know how blessed
[2:52:24] you are because if it didn't move fast
[2:52:25] enough you're
[2:52:30] dead except though that Hast and come to
[2:52:33] meet me surely there had been not been
[2:52:35] left unto nabl by Morning Light any that
[2:52:38] pissed against you all verse 35 we're
[2:52:41] done just a few more verses so David
[2:52:43] received of a and that's which she had
[2:52:46] brought him and said unto her go up in
[2:52:49] peace to thine house see I have
[2:52:51] hearkened to thy voice and I've accepted
[2:52:54] thy person Hallelujah Glory we're almost
[2:53:00] done and Abigail came to
[2:53:03] nabal and behold and I want us to
[2:53:05] picture this look at this broken
[2:53:09] home look at this messed up
[2:53:13] situation
[2:53:15] nabal is so
[2:53:17] clueless while Abigail pleading for his
[2:53:21] life what is nabal doing throwing our
[2:53:27] fet whole fat going on know listen
[2:53:30] listen here and Abigail came to nabal
[2:53:33] and behold he held a feast in his house
[2:53:35] like the Feast of a king he party in he
[2:53:39] don't know that if abig didn't go out
[2:53:42] there in a matter of hours he dead
[2:53:44] everybody meeting
[2:53:46] dead you see how people could be and
[2:53:49] they say they'll be eating drinking
[2:53:50] marrying and he his de judgment on his
[2:53:54] door and he did crazy music hey where
[2:53:56] the where the stew chicken and who did
[2:53:58] not bring the stew chicken he in a whole
[2:54:00] party
[2:54:02] cless a feast like a king he's not a
[2:54:04] king the king outside in the
[2:54:06] wilderness looking to eat something and
[2:54:09] you having a feast like a king not
[2:54:10] knowing the King on the outside coming
[2:54:12] to kill you had it not been for
[2:54:14] spiritual woman God thank God for the
[2:54:16] spiritual woman in the house you
[2:54:19] know a neighbor's heart was Marry de on
[2:54:22] the door with a George and he had marry
[2:54:25] feeling glad feeling good I good I good
[2:54:27] I good thing good this year we had a
[2:54:29] good sheep
[2:54:30] sharing death judgment on the door
[2:54:33] clueless friends you don't know when
[2:54:35] judgment on your door you
[2:54:37] know and neighbor's heart was merry with
[2:54:40] him for he was very drunken wherefore
[2:54:43] she told him nothing less or more don't
[2:54:45] waste your time where you tell
[2:54:48] him this woman understanding on so many
[2:54:50] levels she come home and she it ain't
[2:54:52] worth talking to this man this man
[2:54:53] totally un foolishness still un
[2:54:55] foolishness until the morning
[2:54:58] light verse 37 but it came to pass in
[2:55:01] the
[2:55:02] morning when the wine was going out of
[2:55:05] nabal nabal get
[2:55:07] sober his wife had told him these things
[2:55:11] and when nabal recognized he almost was
[2:55:13] dead
[2:55:14] his heart died within him and he become
[2:55:17] a stone in other words na got stroke one
[2:55:22] time nebor get a stroke youn you mean I
[2:55:25] could have be
[2:55:27] dead verse 38 and it came to pass about
[2:55:30] 10 days after that the Lord smed nabal
[2:55:33] that he died so God killed
[2:55:37] him God has killing her God has take
[2:55:40] people off the scene God has wipe people
[2:55:43] out he in charge of that part the Lord
[2:55:47] killed him he removed him of the scene
[2:55:49] because this story of redemption is not
[2:55:52] just about David being guided away from
[2:55:56] destroying his line to the throne this
[2:55:59] is not just a story of redemption of
[2:56:01] nabal's house being saved because
[2:56:02] Abigail saved the house but God found
[2:56:05] favor with Abigail and say I want to
[2:56:07] have Redemption not just for David not
[2:56:09] just for neighbor's house but Abigail
[2:56:13] you too good to be living under that
[2:56:14] foolish
[2:56:17] man so she God wants to free her from
[2:56:20] that
[2:56:25] situation and when David heard that
[2:56:27] nabal was dead verse 39 he waited for
[2:56:31] the Wake he waited for the
[2:56:34] funeral he gave it
[2:56:42] time when David heard that nabal was
[2:56:45] dead he said blessed be the
[2:56:47] Lord that had pleaded the cause of my
[2:56:50] reproach from the hand of nabal and had
[2:56:53] kept his servant from Evil for the Lord
[2:56:55] had returned the wickedness of dble
[2:56:56] under his own head and David
[2:56:59] sent CS for the funeral no no no David
[2:57:02] sent and communed Abigail to take her to
[2:57:04] him to wife he said this woman here is
[2:57:08] too good listen David and many wife none
[2:57:11] got a
[2:57:12] chapter none of them got a chapter but
[2:57:16] Abigail because she was a woman of good
[2:57:19] understanding and when the Servants of
[2:57:21] David would come to Abigail to carel
[2:57:23] they spake on us saying David sent us
[2:57:24] unto thee to take thee to him to wife
[2:57:26] what a type of Christ and his bride what
[2:57:29] a type of the old headship of The Old
[2:57:31] Man and the old you to the new newness
[2:57:34] of a new headship under Christ anybody

[2:57:53] the words of Samuel for all these years
[2:57:55] and your old nature trying to keep you
[2:57:57] trapped in bondage but God want to kill
[2:57:59] the old nature this morning the old enor

[2:58:32] again and we know David is a type of
[2:58:33] Christ and the woman is a type of the
[2:58:35] Bride in church come on now so Abigail
[2:58:37] was being broke cut out and her
[2:58:41] character Under Pressure showed the word
[2:58:43] was in her her because the word is in
[2:58:44] the bride so she could speak from the
[2:58:46] word that was inside of her so when
[2:58:48] confronted with crisis nothing can come
[2:58:51] out but the word and the mind of Christ
[2:58:54] dropped down to her to know what to do
[2:58:56] with the word so she can meet David in
[2:58:58] that
[2:59:00] Wilderness and when David saw her he
[2:59:02] said this is Flesh of My Flesh this is
[2:59:04] bone of my bone she speaking my language

[3:00:33] will come to Abigail this verse 40 to
[3:00:34] carel they speak under us saying David
[3:00:36] sent us unto thee to take thee to him to
[3:00:39] WIP is like Eleazar go in to find a
[3:00:42] bride for Isaac the same thing David are
[3:00:44] going to go himself he sent his
[3:00:47] men God sent prophet he sent the prophet
[3:00:50] William brandham he sent a fold Ministry

[3:01:40] because the Bible says in Romans 7 why
[3:01:43] she's married she can marry another man
[3:01:46] within this is the only chapter I think
[3:01:48] in scripture where this woman has one H
[3:01:50] one husband at the beginning of the
[3:01:51] chapter and by the end of a different
[3:01:55] husband old man old fool old nature
[3:01:59] sinful carnal Rich Leia I have need of
[3:02:03] nothing I have money I into politics or
[3:02:05] going of foolishness and by the end of
[3:02:08] it King David King David King Jesus king
[3:02:15] Glory can the church say Amen oh I want
[3:02:19] to see my king I want to see my Lord I
[3:02:22] want to oh I want to be part of that

[3:02:27] morning anybody feeling
[3:02:29] religious hold on brother Hold on Sister
[3:02:32] your change is going to
[3:02:35] come I said to read this last verse here
[3:02:37] know but is the message coming out of
[3:02:40] the world coming out of the church into
[3:02:42] bride
[3:02:44] this was the house of a man of the house
[3:02:45] of Caleb you know it was a nice message
[3:02:47] church it was the house of Caleb nice
[3:02:50] message they have everything in there
[3:02:51] but she couldn't grow in that church she
[3:02:53] couldn't prosper in that church in that
[3:02:55] church was judgment in that church was
[3:02:59] death in that organization was
[3:03:02] that but here's King Jesus here's King
[3:03:06] David on the road to the
[3:03:09] throne Hallelujah and when the Servants
[3:03:12] of David will come to Abigail to carel
[3:03:15] they spake unto her saying David sent us
[3:03:17] unto thee to take thee to him to wife
[3:03:19] and she arose and bowed herself on her
[3:03:22] face to the Earth and said
[3:03:25] behold let nine hand may be a servant to
[3:03:28] wash the feet of the Servants of my Lord
[3:03:31] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[3:03:33] reading of his
[3:03:34] word oh
[3:03:37] hallelujah
[3:03:39] hallelujah
[3:03:41] hallelujah hallelujah
[3:03:44] now friends I'm
[3:03:46] done
[3:03:49] when when Abigail went to David she
[3:03:51] wasn't going for husband
[3:03:53] all she was going for Redemption for her
[3:03:56] house she was pleading even for her
[3:03:58] foolish husband that's the real
[3:04:01] Christian walk you know that's the real
[3:04:03] Christian Journey you know so just like
[3:04:05] how Ruth was rewarded this can also be
[3:04:07] presented as this is AIG Abigail's
[3:04:09] reward am because she didn't go out for
[3:04:13] the becauseand she didn't go out to be
[3:04:14] you know what to be King David's
[3:04:17] wife the true rightful king of all
[3:04:20] Israel she didn't just like David just
[3:04:23] like David didn't ask to be king I
[3:04:25] didn't ask to be David's
[3:04:26] wife the same way you didn't choose this
[3:04:29] road but said the message will fall into
[3:04:31] the hands of the
[3:04:32] predestinated you didn't find this
[3:04:33] message this message found you this
[3:04:36] message pick you bleeding in the field

[3:30:21] this far to leave
[3:30:23] [Music]
[3:30:40] me
[3:30:43] [Applause]
