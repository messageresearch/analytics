be here time of Carnival and fetting and carrying on and whatnot you could come today to hear the word of God and I believe in my heart we have a word from the Lord for you something God put upon my spirit and I had it was about three weeks now I never approached it before I went in it before but we're going to go into it today so we want to stand for the reading of the word as you want to go into the scriptures want to go to Jeremiah chapter 18 vers 1 1- 6 Romans Chapter 9: 11-23 2 Timothy chap 2 19 to 21 praise God reading from Jeremiah chapter 18 1-6 the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go down to The Potter's House and there I will cause thee to hear my words then I went down to The Potter's House and behold he wrought a work on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was m in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the Potter to make it amen then the word of the Lord came to me saying oh House of Israel cannot I do with you as this poter sayeth the Lord behold as the clay is in The Potter's hand so are ye in my hand oh House of Israel Romans chapter 9 to read from verse 11 see speaking about Esau and Jacob for the children not being yet for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that c it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he said to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy for the scripture said unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore ha he Mercy on whom whom he will have mercy and whom he will harden he Harden it thou will say unto me why do he yet find fault for who had resisted his will nay but oh man who had thou that rep us against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus had not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much Longs suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had a four prepared unto Glory our last scripture from second Timothy 2 verse 19- 21 nevertheless the foundation of God standard sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity but in the house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth some to honor some to dishonor if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meet for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work let us pray almighty God we thank you for your holy scriptures and I pray that you would Inspire to our hearts I pray you take this lump of clay and speak through it Lord anoint me and anoint the people to hear your word may we see what you show Jeremiah may you show us as you told him to arise and go down to The Potter's House anoint us we pray in Jesus name we ask it amen may you be you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord Glory blessed be the rock hallelujah of our Salvation oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah so this morning have a title come down to The Potter's House that's my title this morning of a subject the purpose of God according to election that's the subject purpose of God according to election and have an inspiration a work on the wheels amen hallelujah so I we know what we talking about there but we'll get it work on the wheels okay let's go so I have a little backdrop here I want to share with you brother brandham speaking about the Ephesians Church age Ephesus the very name Ephesus has a strange comp meaning meaning it means aimed at and relaxed the high aspiration of this age that had begun with the fullness of the spirit amen and he called that the depth of God yes sir so the depth of God is the fullness of the spirit remember these brothers Peter and all these other brothers they were ignorant and unlearned so they couldn't talk all kind of mystery talk and intellectual talk they were filled with God Amen in so much that they reproduced God yes they were God arms and ears and mouth on the earth they were God eyes on the earth so when an Nas of fire came lying in the church they were dead they got killed because God was veiled in that man called Peter amen isn't that right so the high aspiration of this age that begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of God whereby they were aiming at the High Calling of God begin to give away to a less watchful attitude and as soon as you begin with a less watchful attitude your life begin to deteriorate your Christian walk begins deteriorate because you have to be guarded Sir You Have To Be watchful because your not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against spiritual wickedness so even though you walk in this Ordinary World that seems normal and natural it have demons from hell plotting and planning your overthrow plotting and planning your destruction plotting and planning your captivity so you have to walk wise Redeeming the time for the days are evil oh Hallelujah so when you come to Church to come to church to be empowered to get wisdom to be inspired to be anointed that is why you come to church hallelujah hallelujah so the passion to know the word the cry to get in the spirit the fent is are to please God that become the wax coal in people's lives and they just begin to go to church not going to hear from God going to do their Duty unless ad and following of Jesus Christ begin to manifest itself as an omen in the future ages the physical vehicle called The Church would sink to the awfulness of the depth of Satan who would have thought the church would move from the depth of God to the depth of State Satan but still remain church still at the church today move from the depth of God fullness of the spirit to the depth of Satan amen it had become relaxed and was drifting already the age was backsliding it has left its first love the tiny seed planted in that Ephesians age would one day grow into a the spirit of error amen until all false bir of the air would Roost in his branches so inoffensive to human reasoning that little plant appeared to that new EVE the new church and she would be Deed by Satan the Ephesians age had presented to her the opportunity for God's best amen because when God start a work he started for it to be the best because his work reflects his workmanship his work work reflect who he is his work reflects his character his nature his being his very person god is perfect and his work going to be perfect so he expected the church to be glorious he expected the church to be powerful he expected the church to be anointed he expected the church to have the foot on the neck of the enemies that's where he expected the church GL Oh Glory Hallelujah he didn't expect you to say a prayer he expect you to be praying he expected to be calling that devil and El him with with your prayer every time you pray you're hitting him in his face you're hitting him you're giving it back to [Applause] him the Ephesians age had presented her the opportunity for the God's best and for a while she prevailed then relaxed and in that unguarded moment Satan planted the seed of complete ruination in other words that church got pregnant with the wrong seed yes and the life of that seed begins to unfold and brought it right down to the depths of Satan yes yes the very religion of Ephesus stpes out perfectly the Church age and says the tenor of the ages to come just going to just go on quickly Hallelujah I going to skip that talking about the fifth AG Tira the resume of the ages he said since the fifth age aha here we go listen amen brought a dissemination of the word true printing because the printed press was invented in Luther's time I believe it was so before they couldn't spread the word God make them to invent the print in press so you get the word in print and with the word in print now the word start to spread all that is God's purpose just as God say in the days of the voice God have to make science to invent the audio tape to get the prophet's voice isn't that right God a letting that stop and nothing stop him he he's going to control things he's involving things he's going to make sure you get it why you think God have 5old Ministry why you think God have pastors and teachers and Prophet why God have all these things for you to be be your own God no because God have a purpose the church become a vehicle to reconnect you with God not reconnected to church church is is is church that's what the devil use God is the [Music] [Applause] word you a come here to join Church you come here for the [Applause] word so watch this age watch this age was the second stage of the restoration and as we have stated previously was the tassel age education abounded this was the age of intellectual men who love God and served him missionaries abounded and the word spread over the world it was the age of Brotherly Love It was the age of the open door it was the age a long duration and after it the loud Eastern age would come which would be a short one the True Vine flourish in this age as in no other when one think of the numbers at home and abroad this age brought holy men to the Forefront the True Vine spread and the false Vine receded amen the word was pumping do on print it done work it in testimony God rais up a lot of holy men and they were running the gospel isn't that right having the True Vine on the run the false vine on the run everywhere the true Vine went God gave light and life and happiness the false Vine was showed up for what it was Darkness misery poverty illiteracy and death and as the false Vine in its day of power could not kill the True Vine neither could the True Vine now bring back the false Vine to Jesus Christ so this thing working two ways the false car the the true and the CH car convinced the false isn't that right but the false Vine here we go entrenched itself waiting for the last part of the last age when it would win back all except that small flock that elect the vine of God so that false Vine was waiting for the last day he just hanging in the side line waiting to entrench everybody to tie them up in deception only the El will not be deceived how sad does this age Mak us feel as we realize that every great move of God neglected to throw off the nicolan doctrine for they all organized and died remember what a niolon is it's to conquer the Ley it's to conquer the people it's to detrone the Holy Ghost and impose man rulership over the Church of God that was the niolon and that's why we have a pope today because the spirit was removed and they say we want that man let us be the leader remember Israel they wanted a king and Samuel came to them and said do talk that talk why you want a king God is the king oh Hallelujah and God told Samuel they have not rejected you they have rejected me they said they want a man like the other tribes they want somebody to put as the leader now a king must coming David was coming but that was God's appointed time God had a purpose went to give them a king but they wanted a king and God gave them Saul oh Hallelujah Israel and the backl God don't want you to have no other gods before him he must be your lord and your God there is no mediator between man and God there is no fif between man and God the fful ministry to bring word to connect you back to God because you are Sons and Daughters of the Living God oh are you with me Hallelujah so now they all move into denom denominations to hold the spiritually dead and foodless pastures little they they know but each group was tainted with the same error and when the Revival fire burn low organization took over and the people became denominations they were only nominal Christians though each group claim the very assur same Assurance as the Roman Catholic Church that they were right and all others wrong amen every group claiming it right everybody El wrong the stage was truly set for the daughters to go back home in the last age back to Rome under the mother hen as we come to the last age the loud is age this is our age we know it's the last age the Jews are back in Palestine no matter how they got there they are there this is the Harvest time but before there can be a harvest there has to be a lightening a maturing of both the vines the Lutheran age was Springtime the Western age was the summer of growth the ludian age is the Harvest Time of gathering the tears binding and burning and Gathering the wheat for the Lord amen Harvest Time notice that in the Harvest Time there is a real acceler cation in right men yes sir and there is consequently a slowing of growth so in other words there come a point you can't grow no more growth max out then the fruit begin to ripen an acceleration of ripeness and a deceleration of growth oh hallelujah praise God that is what Harvest Time represent isn't that what we are seeing Oh Praise the name of the Lord in Harvest time then there must come upon the scene in this age do who would bring wheat and tears to maturity the tears are already maturing very fast under corrupt teachers that turn the people from the word but the wheat also must mature and to her God is sending the prophet messenger with the Vindicated Miss Ministry that he might be accepted by the elect they will hear him as the first church heard Paul She Will mature in the word until becoming a word bride the mighty Works will be found in her amen that's always attendant upon the pure word of God and Faith oh my the false Church would come together with the world con churches and he wreck an image unto the beasts the Beast deceiveth the whole Earth by means of those Miracles he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast and the image of the Beast should speak and cause as many as should worship the image of the Beast should be killed and caus it all both small and great rich and poor free and burn to receive a mark in their right hand and their foreheads that no man by ourselves save he that have the mark of the beast now remember it was Imperial Rome that fell by the sword but she was healed of a death stroke when she joined the nominal Christian church and Rome and Incorporated paganism and Christianity and thereby become the Roman Empire which will endure until Jesus come and destroy am but Rome is not going in alone her daughters are right with her and she will take over absolute Authority by the World Council of churches here we go are you ready this may seem farfetched to some but actually it is very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling politics and at the opportunity time time will manifest itself exactly how great is the control this ecumenical move will end up with Rome as the head even though people did not Envision it that way amen aha you mean they're not expecting it no they're not even looking for that but he's saying it's going to be that that is where it is heading because God's word Can't Fail isn't that right that is because Revelation 17 3:16 States that's the whole mystery Babylon is Seated on the Beast she is controlling the last or the fourth Empire the mark of the beast means they will have to take the doctrine of the church system which is trinitarianism and the mark in the hand will means to do the will of the whole church with this great power the church system with this great power are you listening am the church systems will persecute the true bride amen this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching Etc her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and Truth to the people who need it but before the Antichrist in person takes over this complete World System of churches the true bride will be taken away with from this world to be with the Lord God will catch away his bride for this great marriage supper of the Lamb amen oh praise the name of the Lord amen hallelujah thank you Jesus Oh Glory to God give him some Praises people hallu hallelujah from the Tian Church age Revelation 2:23 quotes and I will kill a children with debt and all the churches shall know that I am he which search the reins and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works God looks on the heart yes sir that has never changed amen remember about 3 weeks ago I preached on the right kind of a son and I was talking about God didn't talk about Mysteries and teachings and Revelations if that be so Peter who can read and write what is Peter's condition but guess what he had faith in him virtue in him knowledge in him he had life in him he had the word in him all the Mysteries was in him the hidden ones too all of that was lock up inside of him GL Glory what God was looking at was at at his behavior because your behavior is what put you on your path to adoption not how much you KN in your head but how much could come out of your heart isn't that right so let's go God look on the heart he never changed neither will it ever change here as though all the ages are two groups both proclaiming the Revelation from God and their relationship to God nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having the sealed the Lord knoweth them which are hiss the Lord searcheth the Reigns the word search means to track follow up God tracked down our thoughts which is our Reigns he knows what is in our hearts he sees our works which are definite manifestation of what lie within us that is not fake news that is expressing what's on the inside what does that your works so things have to come for us to produce something that we can see what's inside of us isn't that right it is out of the heart that proceeds righteousness or wickedness our motives our purposes are all known unto him as he watches every action and every action every word shall be brought into judgment then the accounting of Our Lives is given there was no fear of God before the false Vine and dearly shall they pay let him who named his name live live as becometh Saints we might fool the people but we will never fool the Lord could I continue the promise in these dark days and he quote the scripture Revelation 2:24 but I say unto thee but unto you I say and unto the rest of titra as many as have not this Doctrine which have not known the depth of Satan as they speak I will put on you none on a burden but that which you already hold fast till I come now before we go into the promise this is brother Brandon let me show you again show again the church as spoken by the spirit in this book has two Vines whose inter wiing branches compos it but I say unto you and unto the rest in Titar as many as have not this Doctrine there it is he is speaking to two groups this is the backdrop of coming down to The Potter's House so no we ain't reach to Putter's house yet we on our way there we talking about the church right now yes oh Hallelujah he is speaking to two groups one has the doctrine and another has not there they are scattered abroad across the nations with each other Doctrine opposing the other this is Doctrine one is of God knowing his depths and the other of Satan knowing the depths of Satan that's incredible isn't it talking about church now you're not talking about unbelievers talking about church now depth of God depth of Satan I will put you I will put upon you none other burden the word for burden is weight or pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages was either Bend or be broken bow or die it was the Inquisition the power of the empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay for your life with your life each age had its pressure for example a great burden of the last age talk about a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft living amen and nervous tensions amen true that's this he problem ch right here this this is it right here I found it this is it right here I do I go nowhere else this is it right here for example a great burdens of the last age is the pressure of riches riches you want to buy byy byy spend spend spend improve improve you can't way to get money to spend and there's a pressure what to buy on how much to buy where to buy the kind to buy who buying just like you who you want to buy like Jesus it's a pressure soft living I mean the pillow fluffy my that's right no mattress we had a long time you taking beat fiber mattress afterward you had to take that and beat that put the stuff that back and L down on that ease no burden for church nobody even to come on time nobody to worship you can't even afford to miss the song service because the song service give you an opportunity to give worship to God if you come and sit down for just word how do you get in the spirit that's what the song service that's why bring me a Minstrel hlj the prophet was angry he was upset he said bring me a Min make some music here now change the atmosphere create an atmosphere that I could move into the spirit and then you could hear th say of the lord we not singing because it's a song We singing Because it brings worship and honor and adoration unto God because in heaven of seraphim day and night Bing holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy H holy holy Lord God Almighty heaven filled with Angelic beings bringing adoration and praise unto God each age has his pressures for example a great burden of this last agees the pressure of rich soft living and nervous tensions in a complex in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in lord lord nervous tension and is that nervous tension because you waiting for the Holy Ghost it's a different kind of nervous tension oh my watch this forward age seem to have a clearcut burden it was to defy Rome stand up for the word even unto death amen that is why the Christians in those age were very pure you have no compromise when they knock on your door Rome or de what you going do have no in between you know well I thinking about it they take you and they cut your head off you had to think about it before those Christians give their lives the real ones the genuine ones they meant and they serve God hallelujah praise God they have not known the of Satan it seems that this verse has been left out by the commentators for they were not able to figure out what Doctrine or what experiences are meant by this phrase actually it is simple to know what is meant this is Brother Bron you recognize none of the com commentators talk about this dep of Satan they don't know what that is listen to The Prophet let us first know what the depth of God is and the opposite will be true for the depth of Satan in Ephesians 3:16 here we go that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of God that is the depth of God hallelujah could we give the Lord a shout hallu do you understand the depth of God now that prayer I I want to read it again that Christ will dwell in your hearts by faith and that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that he might be filled with all the fullness of God now according to these verses when a man experiences the depth of God in his life it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of God indwelling in him amen his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word but the depth of Satan will be in that he will attempt to destroy this he will always attempt to make a substitute of this reality all right all right all right all right oh so it's two things we pointing to now the depth of God is a personal experience with the spirit indwelling in your life that's a reality that is God and you there is no man in between that's fire upon your being that is fire upon your life there is nobody in between you and [Applause] that now watch how will he do it to bring this depth to Satan he will take away the knowledge of the truth of God and destroy the word by putting forth his own yeah had God said he will then substitute here this bomb he will then sub Ute the personal Christ in our Spirits this is the problem from from from the personal Christ in your spirit to a man behind the pulpit or some bishop or some message Pope or some message dictator he will do it as he calls Israel to do the same by a human being reigning as King instead of God the Born Again experience will be rejected in favor of church joining so the people have it in their mind when they in church they are safe when they at church they are bride when they are in church everything is fine because they're in a particular church but Jesus already exposed that and said when they say come here forget that when it's say low here forget that dude come here come here he said behold the kingdom of God is within you [Applause] could we give a shout on that one he never point the kingdom to a place to a church to a man to a person he said the kingdom is within [Applause] you therefore the kingdom has to be the word turn into spirit the Born Again experience will be rejected in favor of church joining the depth of Satan has been entered into that age and the fruit of that depth of Satan which Alles murders and horrible crimes came forth from it oh my thank you Jesus Oh Glory to godu brother brandham we continue from p v suppose you need healing what does the word say he said said but did you get in the spirit when reading it did we ask God for his Spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we could call the Elders confess our sins be anointed and prayed for it might not come immediately immediately but in his spirit in his Spirit it is all over hallu there is I love this there is no other court of appeal God will fulfill his word we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done so the devil's job is to fight you with the spirit fight you from on the anointing fight you make your trip and fall in sin or what not they have no confidence you're condemned you're all messed up you can't even get in the spirit that's the devil job oh Hallelujah do you remember that brother don't go to the acts first get in the spirit and then go to the acts and watch what God will do hallelu ATT that word reading again don't go to ACT first get in the spirit then go to the acts and then what what God will do Hallelujah have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things they go to their ball games their sporting events their dances they get in the spirit of it they don't sit there like a wallf flower old dried up stick they get right into the field of things and become part of it oh hallelujah it's only when you recognize and you become part of this word and be recognize you are priest on to God and recognize that you come to bring the sacrifices of your lips you don't say Amen you're not saying Amen to what you like this is not

of the Lord the Christian ought to be just as listen here we go the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it Savers and delights in its Pleasures there is come listen the Bible said the pleasures of the Lord is at his right hand hallelu the pleasures of the Lord the Lord have his Pleasures you know when you lost that pleasure of the Lord you watch TV they watch movie because that giv you pleasure as a substitute to the pleasure that God has but I challenge you to shake off that pleasure get the pleasure of God that's why that's

will rejoice yes you are problem but Rejoice because he is God he is God and God Alone hallelujah oh thank you Jesus hallu Hallelujah you may be seated both Christians and the world are human both have emotions the difference is the Christian's heart and emotions are purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love while the world satisfy the flesh so you can't give your heart to Jesus and your flesh go on one side Lord I give my life to you but your flesh gone so no that's why right Romans 12 says present your bodies a Living Sacrifice so when you give your heart you have to give your body too you can't go where your accustom going you can't do what your accustom no no no no you got to make a sacrifice your body have to follow your confession of your faith come on give it come on now don't get me started inside of here right now come on now come on now your body have to go you have to tell the devil no not in that bar not in that house not there I'm not going to do that not fornication not adultery no oh give the Lord a shout present your body a Living Sacrifice it's a sacrifice to turn your head it's a sacrifice to walk the right way it's a sacrifice shout out sacrifice so don't [Applause] sacrifice may be seated if you want to purchase a certain item you make a sacrifice to save some money to buy it the sacrifice might want other things but because this is so important you have a sacrifice to save this amount every month for 12 months or whatever it is then you're going to get this well that's the same thing God calling for for your body to connect with your confession so you stop having a mental faith and a and experience that disconnect you from a way of life Christianity is not a Sunday morning thing it's a way of life a [Applause] way it's a way I am the way it's a way of [Applause] life not how you're smiling at people on Sunday morning how you live Monday Tuesday how you face the garbage man how you face the je witness knocking your door harassing you at the wrong time how you deal with that how deal with every issue how you deal with your husband how you deal with your wife it's a way of life it's not to impress the preacher Oh Glory to is to please God oh give the Lord a shout in the house is this the word or not some of you not saying amen is this the word or not is this the truth or not hallelujah praise God I'm not preaching to make you happy I am preaching the word what God put upon my heart [Applause] you may be seated greetings to those connected to us on the internet God bless you trust the Holy Spirit speaking to you up there wherever the tape goes oh glory to God hallelujah my God is messing are shaking it's 40 Years of Ley 40 years men getting tired 40 years and we have a battle now about to get started we need Warriors of the faith and but I'm prayed a prayer raise up mighty men raise up Mighty Warriors of the faith not not of the message nor of the faith the faith has to be restored the faith that was in Ephesus the fullness of God the depth of God has to come back yes yes yes yes yes we have to go back to the depths of God all the world has never seen anything like it it's about to begin it's about to start it's going to rock hallelujah it going to shake he said a short quick message that going to shake the whole [Applause] nation Hallelujah my God bam says oh we always happy when it comes to have the joy of the Lord in our midst oh Rejoice with you greatly but did you ever notice and stop and think the cost to have it did you realize the price that was behind it that the Judgment was and the penalty of sin how cruel sin was you have got listen you stand in a church you've got one of the best churches i' ever walk into my life anywhere I it breaks my heart to see you let the world reach into you the way you're doing all like the honesty of the Prophet wherever he go he will tell them like it is tell them the truth don't tell them because you know you know you know no no no tell them what is truth so don't do that no more snap out of it pray out of it let God come back and take over submit yourselves to God and get the oldfashioned blessing back amen oh my and let me tell you don't let the W creep in onto you onto you the W like a Vine snatch Onto You small Vine small Vine then it start to get thick and hard and then tie up you ever see Vines pulled together you ever see the ground Vines and they bind together like all them have a meeting going on and they say let we line up let we line up let we line up let we l some tin fellas you know if take them one by one they burst easily but when they group together all them fell wrap around you so they tie up real well you can't move I tell you don't let the world creep in on you don't let the world get into your churches so this is our authority to crack The Buckshot and blast the world out of here and if you don't want the world go out you will go out with it but we're going to shoot we're going to use Dynamite grenades whatever it is but there's going to be a glorious Church Without spot without wrinkle washed in the blood of the lamb and you have to want [Applause] that don't let the world get into your churches Brethren pray it out am fast it out until God comes down and take a hold we invite you to come 9:00 to start a pray inside of here to have a prayer meeting inside of here until we put on a tape for consecration service we invite you to do that to put some extra oil in your own lamp don't miss that opportunity now amen all right that's right keep the joy of the Lord among the saints keep them prayed up and guard every place if Noah see a leak in the ark why he put some pitch in it that's the best thing I know to keep a leak out stop a leak prayer stops the leak Prayer Changes Things Hallelujah and that's the what's the matter with the brandom Tabernacle because that unbelief the cares of the world has bong the people until it cannot produce spiritual growth and that's what's the matter with our nation that's the matter with our churches they have no joy the joy of the Lord has departed written in the scripture the the word Hebrew word EAB means the presence of God have departed when the presence of God departs you start to find fault fault with this one that one a Vex with this one and she do me and and and it's a whole flesh natural humanistic thing there is no joy of the Lord hallelujah so then because of that now we're going to other places of pleasure instead of coming into the house of the Lord for pleasure it should be a pleasure and delight and encouragement to know that 9:00 is people praying in the church 9:00 you're smoking up the place as incense going up before God the spirit realm incense going up before God and it's a joy for you to connect with that and be part of that you want to know when is the next pray meeting it can't be you know I forget I I forget when the pray meeting no if you forget it wasn't upon your heart it wasn't upon your mind you have to recognize this is a life Source amen praise God this is where you're getting empowered Hallelujah this is where you're getting in the spirit this is where God could speak to you Hallelujah the house of the Lord is the joy of the Lord the joy of the Lord is the joy of his people he wants you to come to church and worship him and be happy and satisfied give him praise honor and glory and wisdom and might and power he wants you to do that Hallelujah all the pleasure out there substituting the devil is substituting Rowdy things that to take the place of the real good Spirit-filled experience experience so if you never experienced come taste of the Lord huj you see he is good Hallelujah glory to God and when the people want joy today what do they do the people instead of accepting the joy of the Lord people go to church and claim to be Servants of Christ and when they get real nervous they light up a cigarette women sck on immoral clothes and go out on the grass and when man is going there to whistle at them to do everything to be popular oh praise the name of the Lord Halle hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus oh praise God so that's church we finished with the church now come down to The Potter's House open your Bibles to J 18 we want to read the scripture again the word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying Jeremiah 18 verse1 the word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise go down to the Putter's house and I will cause thee to hear my words then I went down to The Potter's House and behold he wrote a work on the wheels and that's where I get inspiration from a work on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was m in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel but seemed good to the Potter to make it then the word of the Lord came to me saying oh House of Israel can I do with you as this Potter sayeth the Lord behold as the clay is in The Potter's hand so are ye in my handen oh House of Israel so I want to just talk a bit about this Potter's House that God sent Jeremiah to see and it's so strange that God would send him there because God want to bring a picture a comparison uh analogy is it word that's right and I'm seeing something about the Potter I'm seeing the clay yes I am seeing the whe I am seeing the purpose I am seeing a mad vessel all right I am seeing the Potter's Choice whether to keep it or discard it yes this is what I'm seeing now before clay could be used you don't just dig up Clay it has to go through a process yes that it can be usable let's call it Sanctified cleansed purified purged out to get it malleable that you could work it amen and get it into a usable State yes sir isn't that right amen The Vessel was mad the Potter Choice was to keep it or discard it he brought it back from a broken State and the vessel was remade so I have some notes Here the clay after being pulverized mixed with water brought into a usable State a lump is tored in the middle of this wheel and I wish I had a wheel to show it in reality it's a wheel have something on your foot spinning this wheel spin around like this and they take this lump of clay and hit it in the middle of the wheel and and okay a lump is tossed into the middle of the wheel the center of the wheel with fingers thumbs water and pressure that lump of clay is turned into a bowl if you go on the internet and YouTube you could see how it is done huh and it's kind of and it turned into a bowl a vase a water pot a candle holder whatever the Potter de sides after completion the artwork is done it is placed in the over K heated to bring it to a usable State glazed then heated and brought it into a state for the Potter the reason the clay must be processed because when it is placed on the wheel and the wheel begins to spin as stone rock Pebble or stick could M it or break it so when the Potter start to put that lump there start to knead it and put water in it and put his hands in it and it keeps spinning and expand it he in other words one beautiful thing though he knows where he is going when you are spinning the wheel it can't be you know I feel I should make it so you know are you sure no no no no no once it start to spin his hands and tumbs and pressure when he want to raise it higher he's quick and the whole mud thing raised up higher the clay because he have a vision I want to make a pot so you know how to guides his hands that's the Potter the Accurate Way spinning he can't stop it now hallelujah praise God are you with me [Applause] now but Bram said this in Witnesses before we can ever make any Headway we have got to get broke up first amen you know like the Potter the prophet was going down to The Potter's House to be broke up to be made over again you know if there's no breaking up there is no Making Over Again Hallelujah when he confronted Moses this is the prophet who make mouth and so like that he said now watch you've got to be broke up before you can be remade the prophet went into The Potter's House to get broke up to get on the wheel and spun out something different if you a sinner get on the wheel God will break you mold you different shape your life different shape your home different praise the name of what the church needs today is a breaking up we need to go down to The Potter's House our stiff homemade theology sometimes doesn't work so good what we need is a oldfashioned breaking up repentance in our heart getting mellow towards God am mellow towards God picted the Potter God he's a Potter and if you don't catch the analogy we are the clay just in case you miss it you are not the Potter we are the CLE hallu picture the Potter God working with the ending Mind of a finished product amen amen he is not working to kill time sir he is working with purpose Hall of the type and use of the vessel he has in mind amen he is not working blindly he sees in you what you don't see in yourself he sees what you could become and you have to begin to want to become come how he sees you as opposed to how you see [Applause] yourself he is working on purpose not Beauty I want to repeat that he is working on purpose not Beauty so the things around you may not be nice it not be smooth it might be easy it may be messy but it's not the beauty he's working around your life he's working to your purpose because each vessel that is crafted each Bowl each thing that is made by the Potter have a purpose behind it hallelujah oh glory to God Amen so the things around you may not be Prett your easy he's not Santa Claus working at the weed deal with an end in mind a water pot a flower pot that's the Potter Hallelujah I like that he knows the end from the beginning when he picks up that lump of clay he know exactly what he's going to make it and when I see how they work it they work it to completion they don't mix it half with a half Bowl when they start to spin it but a St it spins complete everything is still and then they just wipe it out put the string and pull it off and you get a bowl you get a pot you get a vase it's complete he had it in his mind what he's going to make how he's going to make it the time to make it it's already finish the work he started in you Hallelujah he's going to complete it could we get a sh in the house [Applause] Lord that's the Potter let's look at the clay a little bit the clay is the choosing of God is God's choice St John 15:16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you amen and ordain you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he may give it you amen Isaiah 29:16 surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as The Potter's clay for shall the work say of him that made it he made me not or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it he had no understanding Isaiah 459 woe unto him that strive with his maker Lord let the putur strive with the pches of the Earth shall the clay say to him that fashion it what makest thou or thy Work he ha no hands I want to read the Amplified Isaiah 459 wo to him that strive with his maker a worthless piece of broken putry among other pieces equally worthless and yet presuming to strive with his maker shall the clay say to him who fashion it what do you think you are making the wheel clay poter let's talk a little bit about this wheel I call it the wheel of circumstance the wheel of struggle the wheel of people the wheel of sickness the wheel of the death of a loved one The Wheel of Life amen you don't choose the wheel and you don't even choose the spin you don't even choose the speed you don't choose how long you're going to be there that's right because he is the Potter and we are the [Applause] clay First Peter 1 said that the trial watch who watch blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy has begotten us again with a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and fade not away Reserve in heaven for you so that's the promise it's reserve it inheritance is there who are kept by the power of God through faith and salvation ready to be revealed in the last time BR when you rejoice greatly though now for a season if need be your in heaven is through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being more precious than gold that perisheth though it be Tri fire might be F under the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ amen so you don't get to choose what God is going to use for that wheel you don't get to choose how fast the wheel is going to spin you don't get to choose your test the putter choice at the wheel according to the the purpose he has for that vessel Act 7:9 and the Patriarchs moved with Envy sold Joseph into Egypt but God was with him amen ahuh you mean God used Joseph's own brother as a spinning wheel to put him into his purpose and his [Music] destiny what if Joseph got a bad attitude and just hate his brothers I hate him I hate him you seeing it to you know all story different you know because there was no anointing or blessing to come up upon that he has to adjust that's why when they came for food he said God send me ahead to preserve life so Joseph was in his thing you see all you do me you see where you do me get that nonsense he wasn't in that foolishness he said God send me ahead to preserve life before because he saw the higher purpose that he was on that wheel that was being spun to make him a vessel to be placed next to Pharaoh hallelujah hallelujah the ptter was working on Joseph not the brothers I'm not hearing you Hallelujah say if the PO working on you not your wife not your husband you not your children you not your mother not your father you not your sister or brother you working on you let him work on [Applause] you so God used Joseph's own Brothers as the spinning wheel to bring Joseph into his purpose and Destiny you don't choose a temperature of the fullness of the kill or oven you don't choose how long you are going to be there all right amen amen ah I feel good this morning the vessel that he made of clay was mad in the hand of the butter so he made it again another vessel he his bump part he his clothes as seem good to the Potter to make it the Potter didn't have to consult anybody when people write you off when they think you can bounce back when they think you are finished finish yeah say who the poter didn't say that the butter kept you when you were broken the butter held you when you were bruised the P held you when nobody understood what you were going through when you were wrecked on the inside you almost give up you're almost given he he could have discarded you but he still held you oh give God praise if you don't find it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God praise God praise God oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how dare any man question the Potter remaking a vessel onto a new purpose unto a new Destiny things started out and things went wrong things started out and didn't work out as you expected but the Potter didn't give up on you the Potter didn't discard you the PT didn't let you go the ptter going to take you and remake you oh glory to God come down to the PT's house hallelujah hallu oh Jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh give the Lord a shout God loves to remake Broken Vessels come on now come on now don't let no man on Earth write you out H he is the [Applause] ptter [Applause] Hallelujah May SE it and the vessel that he made of clay was m in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel so he had to bring it back down to original state back to this lump because once it's not hit heat once it doesn't go in the oven it could be brought back to this Mal malleable State once it doesn't heat it and bake it you could remake it mold it it have some St in a corner call call them pot shirts all them cracked pieces broken pieces but God decide not to throw you aside God need that's why you have no excuse in praising shouting worship it God chose you [Applause] amen Isaac Hallelujah when Hallelujah when they say you finish when they say C be REM made it again God changed the purpose by making it let me read it again let me read it again let me read it let me read it Hallelujah so he made it again another vessel another vessel he he shap it to have fresh purpose the same material the same man same shoes same man same name but Channel differently purpose differently glory to God the purpose of God according to election that will [Applause] stand oh Hallelujah tell that old devil God is not finished with you as yet he is still working on [Applause] me Hallelujah Give the Lord a [Applause] shout m my God you may be seated the thing about it you can't make the vessel without the wheel all right all right and the wheel is not just have a name called wheel the wheel is to spin the making is in the spinning if it don't spin you can't make it if your life not spinning nothing is making it's only when it's spinning it could shape you it's only when

Esau I hate Hallelujah that the purpose of God according to election can stand amen not him that will it that's why he's almost sinful to write off people you can't do that I don't care what somebody did the only thing that cannot be forgiven is blaspheming the Holy Ghost and that is attributing to the devil The Works of the spirit every other thing can be forgiven hallelujah thank you Jesus hallelu as long as you haven't blasphemed the Holy Ghost there's blood amen there is Mercy the ptter could take you up and put you back on the wheel Hallelujah repurpose you fix your right my it's so good to go down to The Potter's House amen think about how everybody have seen you that you know that know about your life and your sins and your feeling short think about that think about Peter fisherman Lord is that you B me to come walking on water man cutting off ears believer chopping off ears man Hallelujah denying man Peter but when God take him break him remol him and shape him how you going touch that man now you can't talk about when he deny Christ that's foolishness you can talk about when he did this and did that that is nonsense he's already remade he already gone to the OV Fire come upon him that's a brand new man purpose according to election that man given the key to the kingdom a man that could even sign his name God to hold the keys unlock the kingdom repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and them that are far off even as men the Lord of God shall [Applause] call could we give the Lord a shout you may be seated and this man this B that God reshape and repurpose with the key to the kingdom Hallelujah when Paul come ahuh and BST a

Paul said listen listen listen listen I didn't meet all the fellas I meet Pillar of Fire on the backside of desert and he told me this and because they are Sons they understand rank position purpose Paul Apostle and prophet of the Gentiles Paul Peter don't have the education and stuff to write these letters Paul have that God Called Paul for a purpose God called pet for a purpose isn't that right every one of you have a purpose tell the devil is a liar you have a purpose your life a finished yet your purpose a finished [Applause] yet so if God had to remake remold go back to the base to bring you back to manable condition and then put it to spin he going to do that tell Dev is a liar he can't get you Hallelujah can't have your musicians come up please oh glory to God hallelujah come down to The Potter's House and see what God told jeremi that you as the clay is in his hands you didn't choose he chose you you can't choose his spin you can't choose your trials you can't choose whether sickness come whether death come life come you can't choose who will walk out of your life who friends you will lose we can't choose who walk out of the church who would leave who would come we're not going to choose that it's God's choosing all that is arranged around your life Hallelujah friends we leave church that was the introduction on backet to come down to the individual would you allow God to put you on his will to work a work on the wheel it's only on the wheel that work could be accomplished nothing things are quiet and nice you get a raise a pay or get some back pay and they get some improvement in the furniture and the h and I just purchased this and things are so nice and smooth God I working to work with that when things begin to spin when things begin to turn around that is where when you don't feel like praising God when you have a sad story and you come to church and you could say hallelujah D the glory and you could worship God pressure being applied you divorce yourself from your human emotions and sentiment when you come to church you come to worship God you're thanking God for deliverance of your son and your daughter thanking God in advance you're letting the devil know who sign your on yeah sitting there dumb dumb dumb like some dumb dog in Israel sitting there dumb God not God not recognizing that God not trying to read your your God God God not M God not reading M and the four be say m 24 say mm mm and the angel M no they all Hallelujah they all praise God you going to open your mouth you ain't getting nothing till you ask for it ask it shall be given I ask for a special service I ask that God would speak to you I ask that this will transform your life that you would stop complaining and shut up because you're on the wheel and you will thank God and bless God for the opportunity on your wheel and if you get broken he could rework you he could remake you he could make you over again oh Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah let me just s down a minute let me just read this here from L Church AG he said now he said his own as many as I love I rebuke and chasten to chasten is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view to correction chasen does not mean to punish I think I need to let that soak in a little bitah as many as I love I rebuke and chasen chasing doesn't mean to punish it means to discipline because the subject's amendment in his mind it means he's disciplining you to bring you into Conformity to his will and to his word that is what that chasen is all about isn't that right whom the Lord love it he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom receive it if you endure chastening God deal it with you as with sons if you endure the Chast amen if they run out well you know you're on your own amen some people just run out the test they run out they can't take it no more so avoid duck hide and they by the self and the devil isolate you and then take you out if you cat your bird aside you could take him out when the bird wounded and weak and he stay with the flow of the rest of birds and they make a way and in front of him and they G the breee you get to ease and flying with the rest of birds you have people to encourage you and support you but once the devil can get you to a side that's what he does you first thing you fall you fail something happen wrong you keep to yourself no prayer you're not coming to the church you're not coming to the ministry you're all by yourself devil says stay right there now you can do it you can handle it yes and all he trying to do is to get you by yourself to nail you when he finish with you like a zombie Dead Man Walking no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which exercise thereby I'm almost done hearing is set forth the love of God love of God he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons like himself I'm finishing dear before him lies all one mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he now will make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosen will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to be conformed to His Image in their walk he reproves with all longsuffering and Gent gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order to rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is his love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be oh fear not flock this age is closing fast as th those tears will be bound together as a threefold cord is not easily broken they will have a tremendous three-fold strength of political physical spiritual satanical power they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ she will suffer but she will endure fear not those things that are coming upon the Earth for he who loved his own love him un the end and I close with these scriptures and a quotation at the end this the scripture I read think when brother Stephen SP spoke Isaiah 431 and7 but thus said the Lord that created thee oh Jacob that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee have called thee by thy name for thou art mine when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee and through the war Rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire Thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I give Egypt for thy Ransom it you e opian seber for thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable I have loved thee therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for I am with thee I will I will bring thy seed from the East and gather the from the West I will say to the north give up to the South keep not back bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the Earth even everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him ye I have made him what are we created for for his glory Isaiah 684 648 but now oh Lord thou Our Father we are the clay Thou Are The Potter we are all the work of thy hand Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had before ordained that we should walk in them PR something
