[28:33] substitute for divine inspiration and
[28:36] Revelation there is no substitute I
[28:39] don't care intellectual I don't care
[28:41] have a PhD a doctorate there is no

[29:31] anybody could be a preacher read text
[29:34] scripture and quote but very few going

[29:40] barrel the the the Basin with water and
[29:43] washed their feet amen they didn't
[29:46] understand what he was doing at first
[29:48] amen he wanted to do something not by

[29:55] thinking this is the attitude I want you

[30:26] ministers it's about the
[30:30] people God's
[30:33] flock and in Ezekiel 34 you can read it
[30:37] God said I going to require those
[30:39] Shepherds of the flock that I put into
[30:41] their
[30:43] hands you are not my flock you are God's
[30:48] flock that I have been placed here to

[31:55] seals preach to the Baptist to the
[31:57] Methodist preach to The Sinner the

[32:34] Glory to God oh give me give me Lord a
[32:37] shout of Praise over the speaker on the
[32:40] comat Give the Lord a shout of Praise
[32:42] they're going to be real Christians
[32:45] ruged Christians Gody Christians you may
[32:49] be seated praise God not the kind you
[32:52] have to spray no I of water I you to put
[32:56] certain thing to spray the the off for
[32:58] them no not that kind of Christians I'm
[33:00] talking about people that love God they
[33:03] become Fearless it come like you don't
[33:05] care a kind of Reckless fith where you
[33:08] believe God for anything and for
[33:11] everything you don't care because God is
[33:13] your father and the devil have no
[33:15] business between you and your father he
[33:18] doesn't own you he have no license on
[33:20] you H going whisper and talk and talk
[33:23] all kind of negative things to you but
[33:26] when you come to church you come to hear
[33:28] your voice my sheep hear my voice his
[33:32] voice is his word so once the word is
[33:34] spoken that's the voice of God you love
[33:37] him oh praise the name of the Lord oh
[33:41] hallelujah hallelujah praise be to Jesus
[33:45] Oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[33:47] Lord he said we cannot lead one another
[33:50] we are helpless we got to depend on the
[33:52] great Shepherd amen of the Sheep amen
[33:55] who is the Lord Jesus who's the great
[33:57] sheer the Sheep Lord the Lord Jesus not
[34:00] Pastor somebody Pastor somebody is a
[34:02] Shepherd in a church is not right but
[34:05] the real Shepherd is the Lord Jesus amen
[34:09] isn't that right hallelujah praise God
[34:12] so if a fellow doesn't know a sheep real
[34:14] well it's hard to tell the difference
[34:15] between the bleeding of the goat and of
[34:17] a sheep they hold lot alike but the
[34:19] nature of them prove what they are and
[34:21] that's the way with confessed Christians
[34:23] and real Christians the goat represent
[34:25] the world they lead you right down the
[34:27] wrong road to your Eternal separation
[34:28] from God they would lead you into the
[34:30] trouble but we are sheep or we better
[34:33] watch what kind of Shepherd we got isn't
[34:36] that right and it could be if all God
[34:39] sheep when the heat was on would stand
[34:42] together when the trials was real hard
[34:44] and the heat is on and everything is
[34:45] going on everywhere if all of God's
[34:48] Little Sheep would just stand together
[34:49] we have the coolness of the shade of
[34:51] each other to comfort to lean upon one
[34:54] another now somebody said is that
[34:56] necessary brother Brandon it certainly
[34:58] is there's nothing like having a real
[35:00] good Dependable friend or when the
[35:02] trouble are blazing and the heat is on
[35:04] you can go to this friend and sit down
[35:05] and explain to them talk it over in
[35:07] personal confidence and then kneel down
[35:09] pray together and know that this person
[35:11] is a good God saved man or woman that
[35:13] you can put confidence in oh it's good
[35:16] to do that hallelu oh blessed be the
[35:18] name of the Lord and I think when the
[35:20] church get real cold in different God
[35:22] sheep ought to kind of huddle up
[35:23] together and pray for each other and the
[35:25] warmth of good Christian Fellow ship it
[35:28] means so much David said blessed is the
[35:30] man that sth not in the seat of the
[35:32] scornful but is Delight in the law of
[35:34] the Lord and in that La that heed day
[35:36] and night isn't that right now praise
[35:39] God whatever you do shall prosper isn't
[35:40] that wonderful then he said now if our
[35:43] heart condem us not but if there's
[35:44] something in your life that condemns you
[35:46] you better make that right you just
[35:47] can't operate right the Holy Spirit
[35:50] can't deal with you when you got
[35:51] Prejudice and selfishness and all those
[35:53] things in you the Holy Spirit can never
[35:55] bless you you might get some
[35:57] intellectual emotions G some work up let
[36:00] me explain something to you for instance
[36:02] when a woman gets married and she's
[36:04] afraid that she's not going to have a
[36:06] baby she won't have it no but let her go
[36:09] and adopt a baby then she will have one
[36:11] now that book's claim that's N9 out of
[36:13] 10 it will do it why it sets her body
[36:16] into the right emotion ask the doctor if
[36:18] that's not right it puts her in the
[36:20] right attitude so before you have the
[36:23] real baby you could get the adopted baby
[36:25] so before you get the Holy Ghost you
[36:27] could
[36:28] adopt by your
[36:30] Praises by your worship by getting your
[36:34] minds set in the right atmosphere
[36:37] because you know God going to fill you
[36:39] with the Holy Ghost hallelujah praise
[36:42] God you can come on a great expectation
[36:44] because you know God going to manifest
[36:45] something in your life can you please
[36:47] stand and give God some worship praise
[36:50] God hallelujah hallelujah praise the
[36:53] name of the Lord hallelujah praise be to
[36:57] Jesus

[42:51] verse Verse 18 Matthew chapter 9 while
[42:55] he spake these things unto them behold
[42:58] there came a certain ruler and worshiped
[43:00] him and saying my daughter is even now
[43:04] dead but come and lay thy hand upon her
[43:08] and she shall live may the Lord add a
[43:11] blessing to the reading of his word you
[43:13] may be
[43:20] seated I surely deem it a privilege to
[43:23] stand before you I am very grateful for
[43:27] the hospitality that has been extended
[43:29] to me somehow the Lord knew all about
[43:32] these plans I didn't even know myself
[43:35] that I would be here but I have realized
[43:37] that it's the Lord's doing and I will
[43:39] take the opportunity and I hope to be a
[43:42] blessing to you as you've been a
[43:44] blessing to me thus far so I would like
[43:47] to thank the pastor and brother Isaac
[43:49] and the entire church for the lovely
[43:52] brotherly love that they have shown the
[43:54] kindness towards me during my in
[43:58] Trinidad and uh I'm sure enjoying it I
[44:01] wish I could speak your P so I'm
[44:05] catching the accent and I'm getting
[44:08] there for a title I have quite a bold
[44:12] message this morning and I hope it
[44:15] blesses you as the Lord laid it upon my
[44:17] heart amen my title is be Reckless and
[44:20] fearless in
[44:23] faith
[44:25] Hallelujah be Reckless and fearless in
[44:28] faith which Faith there's only one Faith
[44:32] there's only one Lord and we've been
[44:34] contending for that faith and that Faith
[44:37] was restored by Malachi 4 therefore
[44:40] Malachi 4 is telling you this morning be
[44:42] Reckless and
[44:44] fearless in faith Hallelujah and my
[44:47] inspiration is fear not little flock
[44:51] it's the father's will to give you the
[44:54] kingdom Hallelujah so it's the father's
[44:57] will to give us the kingdom we did not
[45:00] deserve this Kingdom but he made us
[45:02] citizens of this Kingdom and it's a
[45:04] spiritual Kingdom you won't see it with
[45:07] your eyes because the king of this
[45:09] kingdom is the Lord himself and his
[45:11] citizens is the elect only Hallelujah
[45:14] the predestinated ones
[45:16] Hallelujah and my
[45:18] subject Holy Ghost Land possessing time
[45:22] do you believe that we have arrived in
[45:24] the land possessing time which is the
[45:27] Holy Ghost Land it is a land of milk and
[45:30] honey it is a beautiful land my brother
[45:32] and you've made it on the third face
[45:34] this is where you going to have your
[45:36] inheritance
[45:39] Hallelujah are you
[45:41] ready direct quote from the prophet's
[45:44] message as I was with Moses so will I be
[45:46] with thee now Joshua in all this knowing
[45:50] that the command was great but having
[45:53] the Assurance he could be Fearless he
[45:57] could be as we would call it Reckless as
[46:00] long as he was pointed the right way
[46:04] hallelujah amen he says as long as you
[46:06] are pointed in the right direction be
[46:09] Reckless and fearless in your faith
[46:12] Hallelujah because people are Marching
[46:15] some groups are going this way some
[46:17] groups are going that way we don't know
[46:20] who is leading them but all we are
[46:22] interested about is to know what did
[46:24] Malachi for say because he is the the
[46:27] star he is the star that pointed us to
[46:29] Christ and if you are facing the right
[46:32] direction my brother my sister be
[46:34] Fearless be Reckless as long as you are
[46:38] facing the right direction
[46:44] Hallelujah we find Joshua knowing the
[46:47] responsibilities was leading them
[46:49] through L now that he'd have to go over
[46:52] into some land he have to set up the
[46:55] kingdom he'd have to divide The
[46:57] Inheritance among them he know the
[46:59] commission was tremendous many people
[47:01] was thinking that the new land was the
[47:04] Millennium the prophet says no they were
[47:06] killing and fighting there there won't
[47:08] be any fighting in the Millennium the
[47:10] land that Joshua was taking them into is
[47:13] parallel to the Holy Ghost Land
[47:15] Hallelujah he said but to you men and
[47:18] woman there's something in you that is
[47:20] calling out because the other Brethren
[47:23] prefer to stay on the border they prefer
[47:26] to stay on the other side of Jordan but
[47:28] for you who's got the deep that is
[47:30] calling unto a deep there must be a call
[47:33] Yonder to respond to your deep
[47:35] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so he
[47:39] says hallelujah you are going to pass by
[47:41] your brethren but you who believe God to
[47:45] you who know to you that God something
[47:49] in you that is calling you to the other
[47:51] side if all the Deep you've got has been
[47:54] satisfied then stay where you are but
[47:57] for me and my house it's a personal
[48:00] testimony I am not yet satisfied because
[48:03] when I listen to brother bram's message
[48:06] I don't just get the knowledge of the
[48:07] message I also see the demonstration of
[48:10] the faith the gift of God operating in a
[48:14] man Hallelujah he will discern he would
[48:17] heal he would tell things in advance
[48:19] brother I am not yet satisfied with the
[48:22] theologies of men that's why for me and
[48:24] my house for me and my house don't speak
[48:27] for me let me speak for myself for me
[48:30] and my house I am not yet satisfied I am
[48:33] looking for a Revival Hallelujah because
[48:37] he promised a Revival and there's coming
[48:39] for a Revival a seven Thunder
[48:42] Revival
[48:45] hallelujah hallah hallelujah Hall you
[48:49] may be seated Glory Glory he says I
[48:53] cannot I cannot be satisfied with you
[48:56] theology there's something beyond that
[48:59] and that's calling me that's my desire
[49:02] Brethren to see my church cross over
[49:05] into another land a desire to move over
[49:09] to the other side if there's something
[49:11] in you here first there's a calling in
[49:14] you there'll be something to respond to
[49:16] that call because there's something
[49:18] called on on across the ridge Yonder
[49:22] across the Ridge and all across Jordan
[49:26] until you fall fall into the arms of God
[49:29] Yonder so your portion is God himself

[1:05:55] evidence
[1:05:56] of the new land amen the son of man who
[1:05:59] is the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:02] he is the new land we are living by the
[1:06:05] evidence because Jesus came he died and
[1:06:08] we died with him in the message
[1:06:10] identification we had to be we went with
[1:06:12] him to Gethsemane we went through
[1:06:14] Calvary we died with him we went into
[1:06:16] the tomb we rose with him and as he
[1:06:19] lifted up on the third day as he went up
[1:06:21] he sent down the Holy Spirit which is
[1:06:24] the down payment which is the down
[1:06:26] payment of your Redemption Hallelujah
[1:06:29] the other half of the Chinese ticket you
[1:06:32] have it in your pocket you can't just
[1:06:34] sit still my brother that's the reason
[1:06:36] why you have come to these meetings
[1:06:38] Hallelujah you need a Revival Hallelujah
[1:06:42] the son of man is here and he's giving
[1:06:44] out the Holy Spirit to whosoever will
[1:06:46] it's yours it's yours the land is good
[1:06:50] the land is real the land is here
[1:06:52] hallelujah the Holy Ghost the person of
[1:06:55] Christ
[1:06:57] Hallelujah you may be seated now in the
[1:07:01] message total Deliverance amen the
[1:07:04] prophet says tell us if you are a
[1:07:07] Christian God does not make halfway
[1:07:12] Christians God makes complete
[1:07:15] Christians God Don't Make halfway
[1:07:18] preachers but the preacher can be
[1:07:20] halfway if he wants
[1:07:21] to and God makes his children Christians
[1:07:25] did you notice Christians not message
[1:07:28] Believers but sometimes they are halfway
[1:07:31] Christians but it's not God's intention
[1:07:33] for them to be that halfway it's their
[1:07:35] own ways that God mixed up with the plan
[1:07:40] of God for their life and that's what
[1:07:42] makes them to be halfway now the the
[1:07:46] prophet say all that was in God Kos he
[1:07:50] emptied it in Christ all that was in
[1:07:53] Christ he emptied it
[1:07:56] into the church why would you just hold
[1:07:59] on for one gift when the whole gift giv
[1:08:03] the Holy Spirit be abundance until your
[1:08:07] cup overflows why would you be a Halfway
[1:08:09] Christian why would you be limping in
[1:08:12] the presence of the one that can
[1:08:14] strengthen you why would you be a cried
[1:08:16] Christian why would you still have your
[1:08:18] crutches why will you just be hanging by
[1:08:20] the way because we have the full word
[1:08:23] the word is restored we can now walk
[1:08:26] upon the waters of the word of God we
[1:08:28] can challenge the enemy upon any ground
[1:08:32] because perfect Faith Masters all
[1:08:35] circumstances
[1:08:37] [Applause]
[1:08:43] Hallelujah so they got mixed up with the
[1:08:46] program of God those halfway preachers
[1:08:49] compromising on every side but God wants
[1:08:52] you to be completely standing in the
[1:08:55] preach on the word expectations I love
[1:08:58] the word the holy spirit fs on the word
[1:09:00] of God Christians should always read
[1:09:03] their Bible it's food it's the word of
[1:09:06] God men shall not live by bread alone
[1:09:09] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:09:11] the mouth of God that's what the
[1:09:13] Christian lives on the word and the Holy
[1:09:16] Spirit loves the word and he's here to
[1:09:19] receive the word and if that word is in
[1:09:23] you that what the holy spirit is coming
[1:09:25] upon it's not so much of your body but
[1:09:28] it's the Redemption of your soul the
[1:09:31] Redemption of your spirit and the
[1:09:32] Redemption of the body Christ does all
[1:09:35] three
[1:09:36] Hallelujah now he says in three kinds of
[1:09:39] Believers you may be seated am that
[1:09:41] ought to be amen the achievement of
[1:09:43] every believer am this afternoon amen
[1:09:46] God is able to keep every word that he
[1:09:49] said he would do I don't care what
[1:09:53] denomination sayah if that gun is zeroed
[1:09:57] to the Target it will hit the target
[1:10:01] amen and I believe if a Believer is
[1:10:04] zeroed with the word of God it will hit
[1:10:08] the same
[1:10:09] thing
[1:10:11] amen he says if the word of God ever
[1:10:15] promised anything it will do it
[1:10:18] again I am fully persuaded of it that's
[1:10:22] the reason why I do believe that when
[1:10:25] that bride is called out and elected and
[1:10:29] set in The Book of Life there will come
[1:10:32] a sound from Heaven that will take such
[1:10:35] a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that
[1:10:38] bride that will take her from Earth into
[1:10:42] rapturing Grace God promised it
[1:10:46] Hallelujah so the prophet said there's a
[1:10:49] heaven Hallelujah and there's a little
[1:10:51] Jesus Christ who in that Heaven There is
[1:10:55] going to come in a body form one day to
[1:10:57] receive his church to himself no matter
[1:11:00] how the story seems old no matter what
[1:11:03] other people feel like I will still
[1:11:05] believe it to be the truth God said so
[1:11:09] and that's the believer's beliefs
[1:11:11] Hallelujah birth pain these men if they
[1:11:15] can pick up this and go out with it they
[1:11:18] can make more sense to it to bring it to
[1:11:21] a place you would I just want to lay the
[1:11:24] seed then I hope they make make it come
[1:11:29] to life amen now you remember in the
[1:11:33] message
[1:11:34] he you are a son and a daughter of God
[1:11:38] but you are living under your
[1:11:41] privilege you remember the prophet tells
[1:11:43] about that negro African
[1:11:47] slave the prophet says he had
[1:11:51] selfawareness that he was royalty
[1:11:56] material that's why in that camp this is
[1:11:59] my words now I'm just explaining to you
[1:12:01] he knew who he was he knew that back
[1:12:04] home his father was a king and he was a
[1:12:07] prince and he was a air to the throne
[1:12:09] although he was away from Papa and Mama
[1:12:12] in some foreign land in bondage in
[1:12:15] slavery where there was no signs no joy
[1:12:18] no nothing but what did he do he
[1:12:21] conducted himself as a priest Hallelujah
[1:12:25] I want to believe that black man he was
[1:12:28] black I will believe so and I want to
[1:12:30] believe he was from Africa from
[1:12:32] somewhere and I want to believe he was
[1:12:35] tall he was big he was strong he had
[1:12:38] shoulders he had shape he had everything
[1:12:41] but what did he do you didn't have to
[1:12:43] whep him Hallelujah you did not need to
[1:12:46] whep him he knew how to conduct himself
[1:12:49] although he was away from his kingdom he
[1:12:52] would just carry himself like a son of a
[1:12:54] king when they say rise he rise up when
[1:12:57] they say sit he sits and the other
[1:13:00] people they were getting the morale from
[1:13:03] him because he was giving them some
[1:13:05] strength some encouragement that what I
[1:13:08] want you to do my brother walk like a
[1:13:10] son of a king walk like a priest walk
[1:13:13] like a Son of God don't be under your
[1:13:15] privileges don't walk under your
[1:13:17] god-given privileges you are a son of
[1:13:19] God you were predestinated unto life
[1:13:22] Hallelujah that's the reason why the
[1:13:24] Holy Ghost is here to Quicken you to
[1:13:27] give you back everything that you lack
[1:13:29] Hallelujah the pill of fire everything
[1:13:32] that Moses lack was in the pill of fire
[1:13:36] anything whatsoever you need for your
[1:13:39] families for your children for yourself
[1:13:42] it's in the pill of fire Hallelujah
[1:13:45] [Applause]
[1:13:50] Hall so the prophet says no matter what
[1:13:53] the world says about it yes you as a
[1:13:57] member not of a church but you as a
[1:14:00] member of the body of Christ the prophet
[1:14:03] says you yes work to please
[1:14:07] God do everything you can to build the
[1:14:10] kingdom of God don't never separate it
[1:14:14] but build it together don't never divide
[1:14:18] it by denominational
[1:14:20] barriers don't let those little things
[1:14:23] that man has put up to come and separate
[1:14:27] Brotherhood then when that
[1:14:30] son do you realize the responsibility is
[1:14:33] upon you that's the reason why I came to
[1:14:36] the convention and I came to be
[1:14:39] identified because I need the Revival I
[1:14:42] want to be the Revival I am the worst
[1:14:44] Revival I'm going back with my Revival

[1:14:50] possessing it this is my land this is my
[1:14:53] promise this is my inheritance
[1:14:55] Hallelujah so I'm looking for the
[1:14:58] adoption
[1:14:59] Hallelujah the prophet says if the chure
[1:15:03] had brought a word to the father and
[1:15:05] told him that everything was fine this
[1:15:09] boy is a gallant man that he was zealous
[1:15:13] of the father's Kingdom and he's done
[1:15:15] all that he could to improve and embed
[1:15:18] the kingdom then this boy what we call
[1:15:22] is ready for the blessing of a child
[1:15:25] am amen that's adoption season the
[1:15:28] father taken him out into a public place
[1:15:31] and set him up before the public his
[1:15:33] same son that had been born in this same
[1:15:36] family years before all the time he was
[1:15:39] there but this time his characterall and
[1:15:43] his conduct had brought him into another
[1:15:46] office hallah that's your promise my
[1:15:49] brother don't be satisfied to be just a
[1:15:52] deacon don't be satisfied because you

[1:15:57] a position somewhere because people
[1:15:59] recognize you as such and such no my
[1:16:01] brother there's more land to possess and
[1:16:04] the land is open to all of us
[1:16:07] hallelujah hallelujah thank you
[1:16:11] Jesus
[1:16:13] hallelujah our characters should have us
[1:16:17] up into a place where we can be in an
[1:16:20] office to meet the crisis of this hour
[1:16:24] that we are

[1:16:29] an hour of Crisis what is Crisis danger
[1:16:33] what is danger trap what is trap

[1:17:39] and this one is wrong you should have
[1:17:40] understood it from this day and this age
[1:17:42] and this time and this prophecy he won't
[1:17:45] do that not only that this is what God
[1:17:48] is going to do amen us tell us brother

[1:18:07] meetings did we assemble ourselves
[1:18:10] together around the seventh ther
[1:18:12] convention did God speak to us then what
[1:18:15] must I do do all you can to embed the
[1:18:19] kingdom do all you can to keep the unity

[1:18:29] ministers pray for the bride of Christ
[1:18:32] but keep your eyes open on the promised
[1:18:34] word of the hour because of the
[1:18:38] crisis
[1:18:41] Hallelujah no matter if two or three
[1:18:45] whatever it is pray there he said he
[1:18:47] would hear from Heaven this is my son
[1:18:50] and he received in the ceremony the
[1:18:53] rights in another word his name
[1:18:56] Hallelujah that's not your nature his
[1:18:59] name under the check would be just as
[1:19:02] good as the bank and his own father's
[1:19:05] name for he was a heir of all things

[1:19:12] great days God will come Hallelujah he
[1:19:16] will manifest his he will manifest his
[1:19:19] church we will be a to all things then
[1:19:23] God don't take great denominations apart
[1:19:26] but God takes individuals apart and he
[1:19:30] speaks with them he takes you apart and
[1:19:34] he speaks with you sometimes over in a
[1:19:38] closet when you feel led to go and you
[1:19:42] don't go then you've missed out that's
[1:19:45] what God will do he will call you aside
[1:19:47] one day and speak to you and tell you
[1:19:51] this is now the new office that you're
[1:19:52] coming into you are not just a bride
[1:19:55] member you are not just a church member
[1:19:58] but this is what I predestinated you for
[1:20:01] go ye out there and find The Lost Ones
[1:20:03] for my kingdom because the time is at
[1:20:05] end and we about to go but before we go
[1:20:08] we must tell our testimony
[1:20:11] Hallelujah so Caleb he questioned people
[1:20:15] before the prophet you may be seated he
[1:20:18] said we are well able to take it let's
[1:20:22] go and get it immediately it was a state
[1:20:25] of emergency he didn't want to waste
[1:20:28] time when the people were mourning and
[1:20:30] meming and saying Moses the land is real
[1:20:34] but they are giants Caleb qu in the
[1:20:36] people what we need today we need in
[1:20:40] this hour what we need is men to
[1:20:43] challenge the promise of God before the
[1:20:45] people God promised to pouring out of
[1:20:48] the a Pentecostal blessing in the last
[1:20:51] days I mean a real Pentecostal pour out
[1:20:54] and it's the time for it now so we are
[1:20:57] again at Kadesh Baria we must take our
[1:21:01] position we must go possess the land we
[1:21:04] can wello it sure we can do it what was
[1:21:08] it those coverly church members they
[1:21:11] were looking at the giant they were
[1:21:13] looking with the natural eye but Caleb
[1:21:15] and Joshua was looking into the promise
[1:21:18] of God I don't care how much the
[1:21:20] opposition they had how big the giant
[1:21:23] looked how big the faces looked they
[1:21:25] were looking to God's promise every man
[1:21:28] and woman tonight I would say this
[1:21:30] morning every man and woman who wants to
[1:21:33] go with God don't pay any attention what
[1:21:35] the world says whether we can or we
[1:21:38] cannot what I'm telling you it's the
[1:21:40] promise of God and that settles it God
[1:21:43] said so I like that when God says so
[1:21:46] it's
[1:21:48] settled I tell you tonight we've had a
[1:21:51] whole Hallelujah too many
[1:21:53] Pretenders
[1:21:55] pretences we've had a lot of makeup
[1:21:58] belief we've had a lot of stuff that
[1:22:01] went out for a sure certainly the devil
[1:22:05] always throw it out just to show you the
[1:22:08] counterfeit to scare the people but
[1:22:10] we've had false Pentecost false
[1:22:13] prophecies false stuff false rain we've
[1:22:16] had false this and false that but in the
[1:22:19] midst of it all there is a genuine
[1:22:23] baptism of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:22:25] genuine Pentecostal blessings again
[1:22:28] there's a genuine Divine Healing there's
[1:22:31] a genuine steer there's a genuine people
[1:22:33] and it's time for the match amen amen
[1:22:37] hallelujah so you've got a decision to
[1:22:40] make at
[1:22:42] Kadesh you have to stand and you speak
[1:22:45] for yourself you've got to come to a
[1:22:47] time of decision now I got permission to
[1:22:50] read this
[1:22:51] quote the pastor gave me permission and
[1:22:54] I'm going to read it to you it's a very
[1:22:57] bold quotation from the prophet message
[1:23:00] titled at Kadesh paragraph after 3138
[1:23:05] just further down he says you've got to
[1:23:08] come to a time of decision that's right
[1:23:11] that's right you've got to come to a
[1:23:14] place amen where you have to decide for
[1:23:19] yourself this includes everything
[1:23:22] whether the church you belong to whether
[1:23:25] the city you live in whether the
[1:23:27] doctrine you align yourself behind it's
[1:23:30] your responsibility to check the word of
[1:23:33] God so let me read the quote to you
[1:23:35] you've got to come to a time of decision
[1:23:38] and if the pastor he says let me start
[1:23:42] it from 138 you've got a decision to
[1:23:44] make you see it stands much longer you
[1:23:47] are heart between two opinions why why
[1:23:51] isn't the church on fire why isn't the
[1:23:53] people packed out why why isn't great
[1:23:57] signs Among Us and wonders why don't lay
[1:24:01] it on the pastor it's you we've got a
[1:24:06] mixed multitude we've got people pulling
[1:24:08] this way we've got people pulling that
[1:24:10] way now comes the quot you've got to
[1:24:13] come to a time of decision if it's the
[1:24:15] pastor fire
[1:24:18] him get him out put somebody else who
[1:24:22] will take his place and preach you the
[1:24:25] promise of the
[1:24:26] hour Hallelujah if it's a deacon take
[1:24:30] him out of the deacon board put somebody
[1:24:33] else in his place that will take the
[1:24:36] place and preach you the word of God
[1:24:39] what are you going to do my brother God
[1:24:42] puts the responsibility upon you
[1:24:46] Hallelujah and this may be the time that
[1:24:49] you've got to make your decision you are
[1:24:51] either going to move up with God or stay
[1:24:55] with a dead
[1:24:56] Church you may have to make your
[1:24:59] decision now it's urgent so be Reckless
[1:25:03] be Fearless if my pastor doesn't believe
[1:25:06] it maybe God has not yet revealed it to
[1:25:09] him but for me and my
[1:25:12] house for me and my
[1:25:14] house we will serve the Lord we know the
[1:25:18] words of the son of
[1:25:20] man turning northward possess the

[1:34:00] praise God praise God now the scripture
[1:34:02] we read tell us I will tell you about it
[1:34:05] amen Gus amen there was a man in the
[1:34:08] Bible a little fellow and a nice man he
[1:34:12] was a family man let's say he was a
[1:34:15] pastor let's say he was a priest let's
[1:34:19] say he was from a certain church but in
[1:34:22] some ring up he was was a secret
[1:34:24] believer amen and his name was gyrus
[1:34:28] gyrus means the one who shares the light
[1:34:31] or it means Jehovah enlightens so he had
[1:34:35] some little bit of light in him but he
[1:34:37] was ashamed he was afraid to take a
[1:34:40] stand as a man of God amen hallelujah
[1:34:44] amen I believe he was a nice
[1:34:47] fellow and many times when we judge
[1:34:50] people we judge them by their actions
[1:34:52] and sometimes we we don't judge the
[1:34:54] heart we don't know so gyrus he wanted
[1:34:59] to be
[1:35:00] identified with Christ but he belonged
[1:35:03] to the club of the association of the
[1:35:06] Ministers of the day he was given a
[1:35:09] badge and a bowl of soup he had a lot to
[1:35:13] sacrifice to come out and show where he
[1:35:15] stands he had no backbone he had a
[1:35:18] wishbone whatsoever they tell him to do
[1:35:21] because his name was put in the church
[1:35:23] book
[1:35:24] he was scared to step out
[1:35:27] Hallelujah so this
[1:35:30] man he was told that if he goes to the
[1:35:33] meetings of Jesus Christ that Divine
[1:35:35] healer he will be put out of the
[1:35:38] synagogue and little Jos I would imagine
[1:35:41] down in his heart he didn't want to be a
[1:35:43] secret believer he didn't want to be a
[1:35:46] borderline believer he didn't want to be
[1:35:50] just on on the bench he wanted to make
[1:35:53] sure that he could step out but he had
[1:35:55] so many ties so many things were
[1:35:58] hindering hisi hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:02] amen praise God and he says Thank You
[1:36:05] Lord he just could not make his decision
[1:36:08] hallelujah or else his paycheck would
[1:36:10] not come you know a man like that
[1:36:13] Hallelujah the prophet says soon or
[1:36:15] later God will bring you to a
[1:36:18] showdown Hallelujah God knows how to
[1:36:21] work it out so don't worry about your
[1:36:23] love ones that are not here with you God
[1:36:27] is interested in every name that is
[1:36:30] found written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:36:34] and that's Michael's duty to redeem
[1:36:36] every seed to call out every name no
[1:36:40] matter which church they belong to no
[1:36:42] matter which Fellowship they go to
[1:36:44] sooner or later God will bring them to a
[1:36:47] showdown and there's going to be a
[1:36:49] showdown for you there's going to be a
[1:36:51] showdown for me but I don't know how
[1:36:53] hard it going to be but all I'm
[1:36:55] interested to know by the grace of God
[1:36:58] we going to make it we're going to take
[1:37:00] a stand after we've done all there is to
[1:37:02] stand we shall stand therefore
[1:37:09] Hallelujah so gyus wanted to follow
[1:37:13] Christ into the present stage of his
[1:37:15] ministry which was the third phase which
[1:37:18] was the seventh standard gives Faith
[1:37:21] which was the certain sound which was
[1:37:23] the words of Malachi 4 which was seven
[1:37:26] Thunders will reveal itself in the last
[1:37:28] days and give the church rapturing Faith
[1:37:31] gyus wanted to believe it he wanted to
[1:37:34] step on it this is the sound of the
[1:37:36] trumpet we heard blown from Malachi 4
[1:37:39] this is the doctrine we've been taught
[1:37:41] upon Jus knew the truth but he was
[1:37:45] scared to take a
[1:37:48] stand afraid to be
[1:37:50] identified afraid to preach a certain
[1:37:52] thing amen afraid to say what Malachi 4
[1:37:57] says poor little gyus and he was a
[1:38:01] pastor of a church can you imagine he
[1:38:04] had no choice he was obligated to
[1:38:08] compromise convention in convention out
[1:38:11] meeting in meeting out Hallelujah he was
[1:38:15] just in between not so sure Amen on we
[1:38:19] are going to strike his name now strike
[1:38:22] that's what they are saying the prophet
[1:38:23] say Jesus all along knew that this is
[1:38:28] his position and this is where he
[1:38:31] stands but Jesus wanted to give gyrus an
[1:38:36] opportunity to express his
[1:38:40] belief Hallelujah you are going to
[1:38:43] express what you believe you don't need
[1:38:45] to debate now my brother but the
[1:38:48] interpretation or the manifestation of
[1:38:50] the son of man's words will be the
[1:38:52] interpret ation of the word of the hour
[1:38:55] for the quest of the hour and you will
[1:38:57] be Vindicated by him who sent you who
[1:39:00] called you who predestinated you
[1:39:03] hallelujah
[1:39:05] hallelujah so what what did he
[1:39:08] do God took him between a rock and a
[1:39:12] hard
[1:39:13] place for his Showdown and sometimes God
[1:39:17] will do that gyus did not know how to
[1:39:22] show what believes on Amen but he just
[1:39:26] lingered and followed along and clapped
[1:39:28] his hand and felt condemned sometimes
[1:39:30] and join this club and come out of it
[1:39:33] but one
[1:39:34] day God who knows all about it began to
[1:39:38] deal with him and all that he had for
[1:39:41] his life you see when it comes to your
[1:39:44] personal household brother you are not
[1:39:47] ready to compromise you are not ready to
[1:39:50] play games because this is what is your
[1:39:54] inheritance Gideon say oh shamai I think
[1:39:58] it was I'm not going to give my Harvest
[1:40:01] again to this Philistine for my family
[1:40:03] to starve for six more months
[1:40:06] no so gyus only had one child am a
[1:40:11] little beautiful young girl 12 years old
[1:40:14] amen and she got sick amen hallelujah
[1:40:18] and that's how or that's what God used
[1:40:23] to to get his attention so that he can
[1:40:25] stop looking on men he can stop
[1:40:28] belonging to a cloud he can stop having
[1:40:31] a hand of fellowship or Association but
[1:40:33] he would step forth and identify with
[1:40:36] the word and the crisis of the hour
[1:40:40] hallelujah
[1:40:42] hallelujah so gyrus started to develop a
[1:40:47] complex amen you know sitting at home
[1:40:51] watching tapes saying I'm having church
[1:40:54] I'm just as good as the one that goes to
[1:40:56] church he was afraid to join this group
[1:40:59] because there's too many stories if I go
[1:41:02] there what will they say if I go to this
[1:41:04] convention what will they say chrus
[1:41:06] started now to have his own church in
[1:41:09] the
[1:41:11] house you see brother Bram says ever
[1:41:15] present water it's a joy to go to church
[1:41:19] under any
[1:41:22] circumstances whether it's hot whether
[1:41:25] it's cold whether it's indifferent
[1:41:28] whether the people are fing whether the
[1:41:30] people are growing whatever they are
[1:41:32] doing it's still a joy to hear the word
[1:41:36] of God from the
[1:41:37] pulit because you are in love with God
[1:41:40] that's why you go to
[1:41:41] church God wants you to go to church in
[1:41:45] the message here him God wants to
[1:41:47] manifest something to you that's why he
[1:41:50] wants you to come to church and listen
[1:41:52] to the preacher
[1:41:54] Hallelujah discernment of the spirit
[1:41:57] every man ought to have a church home
[1:42:00] you ought to have a place not just
[1:42:03] floating about from Pillar To Post but
[1:42:06] have somewhere that you go to church and
[1:42:09] you call it your church somewhere where
[1:42:12] you pay your ties and somewhere that you
[1:42:14] help support the cause Hallelujah so
[1:42:18] come on gyus come out of your hiding
[1:42:21] place just come open
[1:42:23] God is interested in you step to the
[1:42:26] church sometime step to the church

[1:42:34] something for you hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:37] hallelujah hallelujah you see God is
[1:42:40] going to use every excuse which is
[1:42:43] preventing you to be identified in order
[1:42:47] to deal with you amen and deal with your
[1:42:49] heart if that's the only excuse you've
[1:42:52] got well
[1:42:53] God will come deal with you through that
[1:42:57] very excuse that you using to keep
[1:43:00] yourself as a box leader you may be so
[1:43:03] that you may be at your post of Duty
[1:43:06] because you are a soldier you are a
[1:43:08] citizen to this Kingdom you're supposed
[1:43:10] to sit there and amen the word but you
[1:43:13] are hiding going this way going that way
[1:43:16] and God is going to use your
[1:43:18] excuse now God is coming to the house of
[1:43:21] gyrus and he's coming to to give him a
[1:43:23] test amen and that's what God did amen
[1:43:27] and what did he do amen the musician may
[1:43:30] come I wish I had part
[1:43:34] two
[1:43:39] hallelu amen am amen but I won't mind to
[1:43:42] visit you again in
[1:43:45] [Applause]
[1:43:52] Tad I'll leave the other stuff for some
[1:43:54] other
[1:43:56] time time flies we're doing well amen so
[1:44:01] gyrus had a daughter yes she got sick
[1:44:05] that's right there something nice
[1:44:08] brother and when his daughter got
[1:44:12] sick the most sensible thing gyrus knew
[1:44:16] what to do was to call a
[1:44:18] doctor all along he was a secret
[1:44:21] believer he knew where to find faith for
[1:44:24] the healing of his child because the
[1:44:26] crisis of the
[1:44:28] hour the prophet says at the end time
[1:44:31] the end time message has to meet the end
[1:44:34] time condition that's right so the
[1:44:36] crisis of the hour Jesus Christ was on
[1:44:39] the land doing miracles on the other
[1:44:42] side of the lake chus knew about it
[1:44:45] because he was in the association of the
[1:44:47] claps of the ministers so he knew what
[1:44:50] that Ministry was doing he heard about
[1:44:52] the signs and wonders but he was caught
[1:44:56] up so what did he do he calls the doctor
[1:44:59] the doctor comes looks at the child says
[1:45:03] chus losing quick the child is getting
[1:45:06] weak but I will come back tomorrow he
[1:45:09] gave them some wet cloth put on the
[1:45:11] child the next day he came the child was
[1:45:14] getting worse by the day child up until
[1:45:17] then wouldn't decide amen second day the
[1:45:20] doctor comes on his Chariot he looks at
[1:45:23] gyus he looks at the child he examined
[1:45:25] the child he says gyus I need to tell
[1:45:28] you
[1:45:30] something he calls gyrus to the side as
[1:45:33] a gentleman he say gyus you know better
[1:45:36] your child is losing ground fast I must
[1:45:40] prepare you for a shock this is what the
[1:45:43] devil will do when you live under your
[1:45:46] privileges when you are afraid to take
[1:45:49] God at his word when you are HID behind
[1:45:53] some group some men some Family Ties
[1:45:56] some family relations my child my
[1:45:58] daughter my husband my in-laws because
[1:46:00] of that God will use that excuse and get
[1:46:03] you on a rock and a hard place to deal
[1:46:06] with your heart Hallelujah the doctor is
[1:46:09] preparing him for a shock he says gyus
[1:46:14] the most sensible thing you should do
[1:46:16] amen is to prepare your wife go back
[1:46:19] there tell her anytime from now the
[1:46:22] child will die
[1:46:24] amen amen so I'm leaving and I won't
[1:46:28] come back but prepare your wife and
[1:46:31] prepare yourself for a funeral service
[1:46:34] you see a messenger of death brings with
[1:46:38] him death news but this messenger of
[1:46:41] life has brought to us good news and the
[1:46:44] good news is the gospel even now there's
[1:46:47] a
[1:46:47] possibility Hallelujah so when it comes
[1:46:51] down to your house to your Char to your
[1:46:54] soul brother you going to have some
[1:46:56] backbone even if you had a wishbone this
[1:46:59] time you just not going to do that you
[1:47:02] won't take it for granted so gyrus said
[1:47:05] Doctor I appreciate you honest man thank
[1:47:09] you for telling me the facts and the
[1:47:11] truth according to your science
[1:47:14] according to what you believe according

[1:47:19] you've studied I appreciate it goodbye
[1:47:24] amen now
[1:47:26] remember I said me and my
[1:47:29] house we are in the House of gyrus today
[1:47:33] gyrus now sits on the
[1:47:34] corner he
[1:47:37] says I just don't take the doctor's
[1:47:39] words for it I can't just go by the
[1:47:42] doctor's report this is my
[1:47:46] child now that little bit of life or
[1:47:50] light that he had began to move
[1:47:54] in his heart something begin to remind
[1:47:57] him what about
[1:48:00] Jesus Hallelujah I pray that this
[1:48:03] morning something begins to come upon
[1:48:06] your heart and reminds you what about
[1:48:09] the God of William
[1:48:11] BR what about the indiaan meetings what
[1:48:14] about the South Africa meetings what
[1:48:17] about those prayer line in every tape
[1:48:19] that you listen to Hallelujah we want
[1:48:22] reality
[1:48:23] of the Living God we want to see God for
[1:48:26] ourselves if someone else sees it he
[1:48:29] will tell us we might not have enough
[1:48:31] Faith but when God opens your eyes and
[1:48:34] you receive your Miracle then you know
[1:48:36] you are in condition for your own
[1:48:38] changing of the Body for the Holy Ghost
[1:48:41] to possess the land so gyus says I don't
[1:48:46] believe the doctor's report I refuse the
[1:48:49] doctor's report I'm going to take the
[1:48:51] word of God all along this word was
[1:48:54] inside of him but it needed some wings
[1:48:57] it needed some help so gyus calls his
[1:49:00] wife he says Wifey this is the doctor's
[1:49:03] report amen he said the doctor is dying
[1:49:06] soon amen this is my
[1:49:09] report I don't believe what the doctor
[1:49:12] says but tell me what is your
[1:49:16] report hallelujah what is your report
[1:49:20] what is your report some times gyus was
[1:49:24] afraid to leave that Association and
[1:49:27] that club because the wife was
[1:49:29] considered as a presti lady her dressing
[1:49:32] code and other thing that she had access
[1:49:35] to so she said to him before shus if you
[1:49:39] go to that group people will look down
[1:49:42] on us because you know we are that class
[1:49:44] of clergy so I don't want you to mix
[1:49:47] with that Jesus but this time it was
[1:49:49] serious it was a crisis it was a aair so

[1:49:57] the doctor's testimony I want to hear
