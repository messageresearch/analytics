[35:29] could dance too much but we could never
[35:31] pray too much so you want to come and
[35:34] put everything else aside and shut down
[35:36] the weak and the thoughts of the weak
[35:38] and the agendas of the week and put God

[35:42] place everything else falls into place
[35:45] you believe that this morning so we want
[35:47] to read one scripture reading from the
[35:49] book of Hosea chapter 6 I'm just going
[35:52] to read three verses verses 1 to 3 Hosea
[35:57] chap 6:1 Come and Let Us return unto the
[36:02] Lord for he hath torn and he will heal
[36:05] us he had smitten and he will bind us up
[36:10] after two days will he revive us in the
[36:13] third day he will raise us up and we
[36:16] shall live in his sight then shall we
[36:19] know if we follow on to know the Lord
[36:22] his going forth is prepared as the
[36:24] morning and he shall come unto us as the
[36:27] rain the latter and former rain unto the
[36:30] Earth may the Lord add a blessing to the
[36:33] reading of his word you may be seated
[36:37] special welcome this morning to Samantha
[36:41] mahes where is she at Samantha mes
[36:44] invited by Maria Lui Welcome to The
[36:46] Headstone Tabernacle this morning and we
[36:48] are happy to be in the house of God so I
[36:51] have a title this morning it's return
[36:54] unto the Lord and this is part two I
[36:57] started this thought on all years night
[36:59] so is return unto the Lord part two and
[37:01] for a subject recognizing your day and
[37:04] your message and an inspiration a call
[37:08] to return a call to return and I'm
[37:12] praying and I have a burden in my heart
[37:14] this morning you know there are
[37:16] different types of services there are
[37:17] Services where you you preach the word
[37:20] and it's it's always a blessing because
[37:22] it's through the foolishness of
[37:23] preaching God ordained that Souls come
[37:26] to him
[37:28] there's also teaching Services where you
[37:30] teach the word and there's also Services
[37:32] where the needs of the people are
[37:34] ministered to and as we come into this
[37:36] new year of 2017 we must resolve in our
[37:40] hearts deep down that there must be a
[37:44] change it cannot be that year in year
[37:47] out service in service
[37:49] out you not seeing results at the end of
[37:53] the day life is about results the only
[37:57] way to measure your performances through
[37:59] some type of results it's easy to talk
[38:02] it's easy to to say things it's easy to
[38:04] even be positive and to be bold but
[38:06] being bold and being positive still
[38:09] doesn't mean results you could tell
[38:11] somebody you will do it and the saying
[38:14] of will do it or having the intention to
[38:17] do it still doesn't mean results you
[38:20] could start to do it and if you don't
[38:22] finish it's still not done you still
[38:24] don't have
[38:25] results and God is calling us to have
[38:29] results and the title this morning
[38:31] return unto the Lord it's such a burden
[38:34] on my heart because as I look and I've
[38:36] I've grown up in this
[38:38] message I've grown up in the church and
[38:42] as I look around and I see what has
[38:44] transpired over the years and the
[38:46] struggles but the Brandon preached a
[38:47] message why are we so tossed about he
[38:50] preached a message letting off the
[38:52] pressure to indicate the struggles of
[38:55] the day and the tug and the pull and the
[38:57] times you don't feel like you're in the
[38:59] spirit and the times you're on top of
[39:01] the mountain but at the end of the day
[39:03] every message that has been preached
[39:05] since the Garden of Eden and still being
[39:07] preached today is to return unto the
[39:09] Lord not to return to the church because
[39:13] they are people who are in church and
[39:14] they have not returned to the Lord it
[39:16] has not returned to the pastor because
[39:18] they are people who have a good
[39:20] relationship with the pastor but they
[39:22] don't know the Lord what we are talking
[39:25] about for 2017 is do you know the Lord
[39:29] and and that's what the burden is
[39:31] because he the Lord he is the pillar of
[39:33] fire he was the cloud by day the pillar
[39:36] of Fire by night it was the Lord that
[39:39] visited them on the day of Pentecost it
[39:42] was the angel of the Lord that met the
[39:44] prophet do you
[39:46] know the Lord hallelujah return to the
[39:50] Lord you could only talk about returning
[39:52] if you were somewhere
[39:55] before if you are in stand you right now
[39:58] and you came from Barataria or digo
[40:00] Martin or wherever you could only return
[40:03] to digo Martin because you were
[40:05] there you cannot return to where you
[40:08] never were before that's why this gospel
[40:11] we preach is not for everybody it's for
[40:14] the
[40:15] predestinated because the predestinated
[40:18] had
[40:19] representation by
[40:21] predestination you come from somewhere
[40:24] that's why even Jesus said I come from
[40:27] God and I'm going back even Jesus had a
[40:31] return to talk about he had to return
[40:34] unto the
[40:36] Lord in the midst of job's trial the
[40:40] exal the encouragement that job got was
[40:42] where was thou it was a reminder that he
[40:45] came from somewhere where you come from
[40:49] is just as important as where you are
[40:51] going to because we are creatures of
[40:54] Eternity we come from a different place
[40:56] we come from different rules there are
[40:59] different rules of engagement where we
[41:01] come from yo you walk different where
[41:04] you come from you talk different where
[41:06] you come from and we are going back to
[41:08] where we come from we are going back to
[41:11] the
[41:13] Lord you may be seated for a minute I'm
[41:16] praying that this morning will be a
[41:18] different kind of service that deep down
[41:20] in your soul you'll be compelled to do
[41:23] something different without a vision the
[41:25] people perish without a bur to people
[41:28] perish without listen in anything in
[41:31] life there is nothing in life that comes
[41:36] easy and if that's a law of natural life
[41:39] you think spiritual life will come easy
[41:42] if Jesus had to learn obedience by the
[41:44] things that he suffered it's a teaching
[41:47] to us that if you want something you
[41:49] have to want it bad
[41:51] enough real enough that's why brother
[41:54] Brandon preached a message desperation
[41:57] because you have to want it bad enough
[41:59] because when you want it bad enough
[42:01] you'll do anything is there anybody who
[42:03] wants it bad enough you want your
[42:05] healing bad enough you want your
[42:07] breakthrough bad enough you want the
[42:10] Holy Ghost bad enough you want to see
[42:12] your house in order bad enough you want
[42:15] to see your marriage in order bad
[42:18] enough it's real to you it's tangible to
[42:22] you not words not just coming to church
[42:26] what good is it to come to church and
[42:28] not have a difference in your walk what
[42:30] good is it to come to church and not see
[42:32] the blessings of the Lord there has got
[42:34] to your results there's got to be signs
[42:37] there's got to be Miracles there's got
[42:39] to be a change you should be able to
[42:42] testify I'm not what I'm used to be I'm
[42:44] not what I'm supposed to be but I'm
[42:47] changed 2016 is dead it's finished it's
[42:50] over but this year I'm going to return
[42:53] unto the Lord somebody say Amen
[42:59] [Applause]
[43:05] returning unto the
[43:07] Lord many in the church have lost their
[43:12] way we have preached about it before
[43:15] Mary and Joseph they were so caught up
[43:18] going to church they were so caught up
[43:20] in the convention so caught up in the
[43:22] routine that when they went to worship
[43:25] and perform their sacrifices and
[43:27] celebrate that they left feeling so good
[43:30] what a meeting what a service what a
[43:32] convention and for three days they
[43:34] testifying after the meeting and then
[43:37] ask the question where's
[43:44] Jesus so it's not so much in the
[43:47] shouting and the jumping and but if you
[43:50] lose the Lord in the picture we have
[43:53] missed a whole business there are people
[43:56] caught up in this quote versus that
[43:58] quote and they don't know the Lord come
[44:01] on now Hallelujah debating quotes
[44:03] doesn't make you closer to the Lord
[44:05] that's about a personal experience you
[44:08] don't even need to read or know how to
[44:09] read to know the Lord because he wants
[44:11] to introduce himself to anybody who will
[44:14] open up their hearts to him that's the
[44:17] real gospel an individual experience
[44:21] with Jesus Christ is there anybody here
[44:24] this
[44:25] morning you didn't come just to have
[44:27] church you didn't come just to be here
[44:30] because it's the first Sunday of 2017
[44:32] you didn't come just to let people know
[44:35] you're still in church but you came to
[44:36] meet
[44:39] Jesus that's why I came because if you
[44:42] came for any other reason you are here
[44:44] for the wrong reason it's more important
[44:46] to know Jesus than to be
[44:48] [Applause]
[44:50] healed let me say that again it's more
[44:53] important to know Jesus than your
[44:55] healing
[44:57] your healing is a result of a
[44:58] relationship let me is there anybody in
[45:01] the house this
[45:04] morning no wonder David could say though
[45:07] he slay me yet I'll trust him forget
[45:11] about the flesh forget about the
[45:13] situation make sure that you leave this
[45:16] service knowing you know the
[45:19] Lord can the Church Say Amen
[45:23] [Applause]
[45:29] [Music]
[45:30] a lot of religious Spirits that's right
[45:34] people take from the gospel or from the
[45:38] scripture as if it's a
[45:40] buffet you know I'm going to di this
[45:42] year so I'm not eating cake and ice
[45:44] cream and I'm not speaking about me
[45:46] personally this is this is the buffet
[45:49] approach so they're selective I'm eating
[45:53] chicken now I'm eating fish um whatever
[45:55] it is and they want to take from the
[45:57] gospel what they want and then they want
[46:00] God to do something for them but
[46:03] returning to the
[46:04] Lord the choice of the word return puts
[46:07] the word Lord in a place so you return
[46:11] to the Lord you return to a place
[46:13] brother bandam taught us he said if you
[46:15] ever Miss Jesus anywhere it's not that
[46:18] he ever left you because he never will
[46:20] leave you it's because you left him so
[46:23] if you want to find him back you have to
[46:25] go back to the place where you left
[46:28] him because that's where he'll find him
[46:30] right where you left him he's not
[46:33] walking away from you we are the ones
[46:35] who walk away from God and whenever you
[46:38] walk away from God your life will never
[46:40] be
[46:42] blessed you hear this young
[46:45] people whenever you go against the law
[46:47] of God there is no blessing it may look
[46:50] like it's a blessing but there a price
[46:52] to be paid when you transgress the law
[46:54] of God and you know better than there's
[46:57] a consequence that has to be met there's
[46:59] a price that has to be
[47:01] paid oh yes oh yes we have in church
[47:05] this morning but I believe there are
[47:06] some young people in the house that want
[47:08] to return to the Lord there are some
[47:10] fathers in the house that want to return
[47:12] to the Lord we want to we want to dig
[47:14] deep we want to come to your house this
[47:18] morning let me read something from the
[47:19] prophet brother brand in the message
[47:22] Gyra said that's the way it is today
[47:24] with the people that's what's the matter
[47:27] with America tonight the only thing that
[47:30] could save America from Total
[47:33] Annihilation is to return to God with
[47:36] the baptism of the Holy Ghost so the way
[47:39] to return to God is with the baptism of
[47:41] the Holy Ghost that's the means to get
[47:43] back to God he said that's exactly right
[47:45] that's right and they are scared of it
[47:47] that's right God help us to have a
[47:49] Revival that will shake the shells off
[47:53] why are people scared of the Holy Ghost
[47:54] because the Holy Ghost will make you
[47:56] change your walk
[47:57] the Holy Ghost will expose in you what
[47:59] people cannot see it'll make you look at
[48:02] yourself different because there a new
[48:04] operator on the control tower of your
[48:07] heart the Holy Ghost will make you stop
[48:09] your line there are people who don't
[48:10] want to stop their line they want to
[48:12] hold on to their jealousy hold on to
[48:14] their Envy they want to hold on to
[48:16] something but the Holy Ghost makes you
[48:18] throw all of that out in the message
[48:20] what is the Holy Ghost given for but the
[48:23] bandam said it'll make you stop wanting
[48:24] to be a big shot
[48:27] that's what the Holy Ghost for he said
[48:29] it gives you power in
[48:31] speech it gives you power in prayer it
[48:35] gives you power to live a holy life it
[48:37] gives you power to
[48:39] overcome you may be seated so brother
[48:42] Isaac I'm I'm struggling are you
[48:45] desperate for the Holy Ghost are you
[48:47] looking for God to work or are you
[48:49] walking away from God so things didn't
[48:51] work out in 2016 things didn't work out
[48:54] for you so what does it mean give up no
[48:57] backslide walk
[49:05] away brother
[49:06] Bram was speaking one time and he said
[49:10] that he had somebody who would help him
[49:12] and he would drive around with this guy
[49:13] and this guy was used to
[49:15] smoke and he said the goodly brothers
[49:18] came to him and said brother brandom
[49:20] this guy you have with you who is
[49:22] smoking he's he's stumbling us because
[49:25] you're a man of God how could you be
[49:27] going around with this guy who's smoking
[49:28] he say okay no problem I'll fire the
[49:31] guy he said the same man who told
[49:35] him that he should fire the guy he said
[49:37] he went to meet with
[49:38] him and the minister said to brother
[49:41] brandham brother Bram I want you to meet
[49:43] my wife and brother brandham the way he
[49:45] describes it in preaching he said I'd
[49:47] never seen anything like that before he
[49:50] said her hair was bobbed back the dress
[49:53] was so tight looked like she poured
[49:55] herself into it she he had these blue
[49:57] and so much makeup and stuff and he he
[49:59] turned to the minister the same one who
[50:01] told him get rid of the smoker he said
[50:03] is your wife a Christian and the
[50:05] minister said yes she's a saint and
[50:08] brother Bram said no she's a
[50:10] haint and he said the reason it got to
[50:13] that point is because men who knew
[50:16] better had walked away from the
[50:18] Lord you could have a Bible in your hand
[50:22] and be walking away from
[50:25] God Amen amen the amount of services you
[50:28] attend doesn't bring you closer to God
[50:31] it's what's on your heart it's your
[50:33] prayer life it's not what we see it's
[50:35] what God sees understand this this is a
[50:39] requirement people over the years have
[50:41] gotten it twisted Church an attending
[50:44] church is not an option it's not
[50:47] something to do it's not it's not some
[50:49] it's a
[50:50] requirement the Bible says don't forsake
[50:53] the assembling of yourselves together as
[50:55] the manner of some it puts these some as
[50:58] a group of people who have the audacity
[51:01] and the
[51:03] arrogance to say that they could sit at
[51:05] home and edify themselves when God has
[51:07] placed in the church ministers for that
[51:12] purpose the arrogance because you may be
[51:15] seated you know what brother random said
[51:17] one time he spoke about even if you
[51:19] don't have a good church to go to still
[51:21] go to church and get a half a loaf get a
[51:24] quarter loaf get a piece of bread get a
[51:27] CCS biscuit but there is no excuse for
[51:30] sitting at home you may be
[51:32] seated it takes wisdom in 2017 to
[51:35] discern because all tools could be used
[51:39] for good and
[51:40] evil isn't that right you could use a
[51:43] gun to kill an animal you could use a
[51:45] gun to kill somebody you could use a gun
[51:47] to kill something that's coming against
[51:48] you so it's not the gun that's bad is
[51:51] how you use
[51:52] [Applause]
[51:54] it anybody with me this morning
[51:57] so the internet and the live streaming
[51:59] wasn't meant to replace the sovereignity
[52:01] of the local church it was not meant to
[52:03] replace assembling yourself together it
[52:05] was not is there anybody in the house
[52:08] this
[52:09] [Applause]
[52:15] morning the arrogance of some people to
[52:18] make their own scriptures I can sit at
[52:21] home and read the prophet quotes and
[52:22] edify yourself
[52:25] how it's a dangerous thing to venture
[52:28] Where Angels Fear To Tread it's a
[52:30] dangerous thing to think that that that
[52:32] that you could do it on your own when
[52:34] God has an order when you return to the
[52:37] Lord It's returning back to his order to
[52:40] his principles to the way he wants
[52:42] things can the church say Amen can I
[52:46] preach a little bit you may be
[52:49] seated I was having a great conversation
[52:51] with my wife and I said to her you know
[52:54] what I didn't choose to be head of this

[53:37] that were laid down by the prophets and
[53:39] the apostles can the church say
[53:43] Amen you may be seated this is a
[53:46] different kind of service and that's why
[53:48] I love why God placed every church as
[53:51] Sovereign yes amen and we have one
[53:54] headquarters and that's the Holy Ghost
[53:57] can the church say Amen so I'm not
[53:59] accountable to anybody except God and my

[54:05] to speak to the fathers I'm free this
[54:08] morning to speak to the husbands I'm
[54:10] free this morning to speak to the young
[54:12] people because we're going to have a
[54:13] real church or no church at all I didn't
[54:16] come here this morning to have a
[54:17] conversation or a discussion or a debate
[54:20] I came to see Jesus I came to return
[54:23] unto the Lord is there anybody Elight
[54:26] house that's the reason you came
[54:28] [Applause]
[54:32] here 2017 has got to be different from
[54:37] 2016 can I get a witness in the
[54:40] house you may be
[54:44] seated in management consultancy they
[54:47] say when you want to change a company
[54:48] you have to start from the
[54:50] top because no matter what you do on the
[54:53] ground level if the top isn't changed
[54:55] the problems will exist again and again
[54:58] and again and the problem in the message
[55:00] is not the
[55:02] [Music]
[55:05] people the problem in the message is not
[55:07] the Sheep the Sheep love Jesus the
[55:11] Saints won the Lord the problem is the
[55:13] ministers the elders the deacons oh my
[55:18] we having church this morning brother
[55:19] Shane I'm not speaking about any other
[55:21] church I'm making sure that we clean
[55:24] this place up so that the Holy Ghost can
[55:26] move in because no man could stop the
[55:29] Holy Ghost God will find you listen you
[55:32] don't belong to man you belong to God
[55:34] you have to return not to brother over
[55:37] it not to headstone Tabernacle return
[55:40] unto the
[55:43] Lord keep may be
[55:47] seated no wonder brother Bram said I
[55:49] didn't come to build a denomination and
[55:52] I come to bring people to myself that's
[55:54] not what he came he came to point you to
[55:56] the Messiah he came to point you to the
[55:58] [Applause]
[56:00] Lord every scripture every Prophet every
[56:04] apostle was pointed to the Lord so why
[56:07] is it we have men who pointed
[56:09] themselves why do we have people in
[56:11] churches who they can't talk about Jesus
[56:13] but they could talk about their
[56:15] pastors come on now I'm not talking
[56:17] about anybody else I want to make sure
[56:19] it doesn't exist in here because my
[56:21] responsibility is to make sure it
[56:23] doesn't exist in
[56:25] here the Lord is the head of this church
[56:28] it is his church we are instruments he
[56:30] can replace at any moment because you
[56:32] are the ones he died for and I put
[56:35] myself in that category the pillar of
[56:38] fire is preaching this morning I'm not
[56:40] even worthy to stand behind the sacred
[56:43] desk because what we want is the pillar
[56:45] of fire to take his place in this church
[56:48] can the church sa amen
[56:52] [Music]
[56:53] [Applause]
[56:58] so when a position is placed upon you
[57:02] now you have two choices Emmanuel two
[57:05] and only two choices you step up or you
[57:08] step
[57:09] out that's it on now if you are promoted
[57:13] on your job you have two
[57:15] choices you embrace the position and you
[57:19] step up to the task at hand or you will
[57:22] fail because you do not meet the
[57:24] challenge of the hour
[57:26] and in 2017 to the men in the church I'm
[57:28] speaking to the men in the church this
[57:30] morning right now you have been
[57:32] entrusted placed in a position of
[57:36] authority as head and priest of your
[57:38] house how could you be a priest of your
[57:40] house when you don't
[57:42] pray what kind of priest are you when
[57:45] you haven't talked to God about your
[57:49] family I told you this morning we coming
[57:51] to your house we coming into your living
[57:54] room we're coming into the kitchen we're
[57:56] coming into the bedroom we're going in
[57:58] the back to see what's going on because
[58:00] we have to returnto the Lord and he has
[58:03] laid out the blueprint every Prophet
[58:05] every evangelist every preacher has been
[58:08] pointed to the blueprint which is the
[58:10] Bible can the church say
[58:13] Amen anybody with me this
[58:16] morning so if we want to have a Revival
[58:19] that's why brother Earth brandom said
[58:21] the preacher could never bring the
[58:22] Revival the minister could never bring
[58:24] the Revival the Revival as to start in
[58:26] your home and the same way we have to
[58:29] set the church in order is the same way
[58:31] you must set your house in order and say
[58:33] you know what I'm taking back the Reigns
[58:36] of my house I'm going to start the pray
[58:38] meeting let's have family prayer I'm
[58:40] going to pray in my closet when they
[58:42] thought I'd be reading the papers I'm
[58:44] praying when they thought I'd be worried
[58:46] I'm
[58:47] [Applause]
[58:50] praying can the church say Amen it's all
[58:54] right to get somebody to encourage you
[58:56] but when the Bible tells you David
[58:57] encouraged
[59:00] himself we have too many Christians who
[59:02] have become dependent and it's not just
[59:04] a spiritual thing it's a societal thing
[59:06] the government didn't do it for me my
[59:08] boss didn't give it to me the neighbor
[59:10] didn't do it for me and the reality is
[59:12] you are born to dominate born to have
[59:15] dominion born to be your creator just
[59:17] like your father what you speak is
[59:19] supposed to come into existence it's the
[59:22] fall of Man that prevented this power
[59:25] reaching to you but you are
[59:27] predestinated to get that same kind of
[59:29] power
[59:30] [Applause]
[59:35] back you may be seated I done left my
[59:38] notes already but husband love your
[59:41] wives even as Christ loved the church
[59:44] that's
[59:47] 2017 it's not a
[59:50] suggestion it's not a recommendation
[59:53] it's not advice it's not even counseling
[59:56] it's just the word of God it's just the
[1:00:00] truth and you know there's no scripture
[1:00:03] that says why love your
[1:00:05] husbands there's no scripture you can't
[1:00:07] find it because I'm speaking to the men
[1:00:10] we're going to get to the sisters in a
[1:00:11] little
[1:00:12] while husband love your wives because
[1:00:15] it's easy for a man's affection to go to
[1:00:16] his car to go to his house to go to a
[1:00:20] game to go to sports to go to this or
[1:00:23] that or the other
[1:00:26] that's right but God had to place
[1:00:28] instruction in there for husband to love
[1:00:31] their wives even as Christ loved the
[1:00:33] church and that even as Christ brings
[1:00:36] some qualification in there because
[1:00:38] Christ loved the church the Corinthian
[1:00:39] Church the Ephesian Church the
[1:00:41] Philippian church with all their
[1:00:42] mistakes he did everything in his power
[1:00:44] to get them back on track so you have no
[1:00:46] excuse in here you man of God you men of
[1:00:49] God I don't care what's happening in
[1:00:51] your house your love for your wife is
[1:00:54] unconditional because his love for us is
[1:00:58] UNC can I get a witness in the house
[1:01:01] this
[1:01:03] morning you may be seated can I preach a
[1:01:05] little bit husband love your wife
[1:01:08] doesn't mean if she washes the wees if
[1:01:10] she wash the clothes if she clean the
[1:01:11] house it's unconditional I don't care if
[1:01:14] the we tack to the roof if the clothes
[1:01:17] reach outside the door the instruction
[1:01:19] is love your wife there's no room for
[1:01:23] interpretation there's no
[1:01:25] [Applause]
[1:01:31] we are talking about returning to the
[1:01:32] Lord to his principles whether she could
[1:01:35] cook like the best chef or there's
[1:01:37] trouble to boil water it doesn't matter
[1:01:40] you chose her you married her deal with
[1:01:43] it love your wife that's the word and
[1:01:46] your blessing your freedom your
[1:01:48] anointing Your Grace your inspiration
[1:01:52] your walk with God is based on you
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:02:03] can the church say
[1:02:04] [Applause]
[1:02:07] Amen love has no eyes when you were
[1:02:10] married you didn't have eyes you loved
[1:02:12] everything now I sit with ch suddenly
[1:02:13] you're seeing
[1:02:17] [Applause]
[1:02:19] things stuff you never saw before you
[1:02:21] didn't see it when you were getting
[1:02:22] married but now you see I F you doing it
[1:02:24] this way and I
[1:02:26] I'm not talking about sight I'm not
[1:02:28] talking about the five senses I'm
[1:02:29] talking about love because God is love
[1:02:32] it's the attribute of God to
[1:02:35] love you may be
[1:02:37] [Applause]
[1:02:40] seated and as a consequence we should be
[1:02:43] such examples to the world it's a
[1:02:46] travesty it's an
[1:02:49] embarrassment when in the church we
[1:02:52] cannot have men who would show love to
[1:02:53] their wives
[1:02:57] [Applause]
[1:02:58] we have people in the world trying to
[1:03:01] put examples do it this way Men Are from
[1:03:04] Mars Women Are from Venus Act Like a
[1:03:08] Lady Think Like a Man all these scripts
[1:03:10] are when the Bible already sort all this
[1:03:12] thing
[1:03:14] out with two principles husband love
[1:03:17] your wies
[1:03:18] regardless and all your problems are
[1:03:20] solved when you do that it's all for you
[1:03:23] now we could go on to her but when you
[1:03:25] love her you sign your paper it's like
[1:03:29] you're on a job and you are co-workers
[1:03:31] in the vineard of the Lord and your kpis
[1:03:35] anybody with me your key performance
[1:03:37] indicator the way you are being
[1:03:39] evaluated is on one thing and one thing
[1:03:41] only in the house husband love your
[1:03:43] wives and when you do that say okay good
[1:03:46] you pass now
[1:03:50] wives Hallelujah
[1:03:53] [Applause]
[1:03:56] we are returning to the Lord this
[1:03:58] morning wives reverence your
[1:04:02] husbands you know what reverence
[1:04:05] means the amount of debates I've heard
[1:04:07] and then you know because men have lost
[1:04:09] their position God didn't put Eve in a
[1:04:11] garden first he put Adam he never spoke
[1:04:16] to Eve he gave adam instructions Adam
[1:04:18] was supposed to communicate to Eve what
[1:04:20] the instructions were anybody read a
[1:04:22] Bible anybody know what I'm talking
[1:04:24] about we are back back to the Bible this
[1:04:26] morning I'm you see when I come from
[1:04:29] behind the desk it's a whole different
[1:04:31] Ministry we are inside the house this
[1:04:35] morning so wives reverence your husbands
[1:04:38] we live in a messed up world it was not
[1:04:40] so from the beginning men have lost
[1:04:42] their place I was sharing with somebody
[1:04:44] yesterday when I was in university it
[1:04:46] was starting to happen that the males
[1:04:50] years ago 20 40 years ago Engineers
[1:04:52] doctors lawyers palot they were all
[1:04:54] males but men have stepped away stepped
[1:04:57] away stepped away there are times that
[1:04:59] driving the road and you see young
[1:05:00] ladies going to work and all the fellas
[1:05:02] sitting down in the
[1:05:04] corner men have lost their place but not
[1:05:08] because men have lost their place gives
[1:05:10] a sister or a woman or a lady let me use
[1:05:13] the word lady the right to disrespect
[1:05:15] your
[1:05:16] man reverencing your husband has nothing
[1:05:19] to do with what job he has how much
[1:05:21] money he makes what he does it's simply
[1:05:23] the word of God there is no excuse
[1:05:26] debate argument discussion your blessing
[1:05:30] is tied to you reverencing your
[1:05:32] [Applause]
[1:05:39] husband

[1:05:44] promise obey your
[1:05:49] parents honor your father and your
[1:05:52] mother you know that doesn't apply it
[1:05:55] doesn't qualified if they're in church
[1:05:57] or out of
[1:05:59] church some powerful teaching right
[1:06:03] because you could never win somebody to
[1:06:05] Jesus if you act disrespectful and
[1:06:06] arrogant to
[1:06:08] them because all they will say is now
[1:06:10] you're in church and look at you you're
[1:06:12] in church here and you can't even
[1:06:13] whatever they say after that but your
[1:06:16] life your
[1:06:18] testimony your testimony you you
[1:06:21] understand your testimony is based on
[1:06:22] the test that God send your way to see
[1:06:24] how you act that's your testimony your
[1:06:27] testimony is your response to the test
[1:06:30] your response to the situation I pray
[1:06:33] that when you leave church today you
[1:06:35] will vow to never do some of the stuff
[1:06:37] You' have been doing and you will truly
[1:06:39] leave 2016 in the past and say Lord 2017

[1:07:54] condition it
[1:07:56] it is with a revelation of where you are
[1:07:58] going so because you know you're going
[1:08:00] to a city whose Builder and maker is God
[1:08:03] where there's no more pain there's no
[1:08:04] more sadness there's no more depression
[1:08:07] there's no more problems aren't we
[1:08:08] supposed to walk happy all the time
[1:08:11] knowing that what we're going through is
[1:08:12] temporary and the sufferings of this
[1:08:14] present time are not worthy to be
[1:08:16] compared with the
[1:08:19] glory which will be revealed in us God
[1:08:22] will use you to reveal his glory his
[1:08:25] power

[1:09:09] condition and we can enforce a claim to
[1:09:11] be
[1:09:13] restored we find in return and Jubilee

[1:13:43] the problem is you know some of you

[1:13:47] during the week so it takes you some
[1:13:49] time to get back like you have to warm
[1:13:51] up so it takes a good one hour to wind
[1:13:54] you up but those who always in the
[1:13:56] spirit the moment you feel the
[1:14:01] anointing this reminds me of where I was
[1:14:04] D when I laid the foundation I might
[1:14:07] have slipped through eternity into time
[1:14:10] but every moment I could be reminded
[1:14:14] that I'm not from here that I come from
[1:14:16] God and I'm going back to God I embrace
[1:14:19] every moment to be reminded that I'm a
[1:14:22] warrior I'm a son of God I'm a conqueror

[1:14:46] going to be the best week of your life
[1:14:48] because you're starting it right you
[1:14:50] started in the house of God and you're
[1:14:52] going to be blessed because of your
[1:14:54] decision Because of Your Action because
[1:14:57] of your attitude because of your
[1:15:02] approach you may be
[1:15:05] seated you know when you listen to the
[1:15:07] business Community somehow I feel like
[1:15:10] this going to help somebody this morning
[1:15:12] huh you listen to business they tell you
[1:15:14] to be successful as an entrepreneur one
[1:15:17] of the things you must have is
[1:15:19] optimism you see if you're not positive
[1:15:21] you cannot make
[1:15:23] it negative people cannot make
[1:15:27] it and I tell you you have to do your
[1:15:30] affirmations anybody ever heard that
[1:15:33] they do your affirmations you wake up in
[1:15:34] the morning and these coaches charge a
[1:15:36] lot of money this is free this morning
[1:15:38] because God's word is without money
[1:15:39] without price and they tell you wake up
[1:15:41] in the morning look in the mirror and
[1:15:44] say I am strong I can make it I'm going
[1:15:48] to get more business I'm going to get
[1:15:50] more customers I speak negativity away
[1:15:53] and when you read the scripture let the
[1:15:54] weak say I am strong I can do all things
[1:15:56] through Christ who strengthen it me I
[1:15:59] say wait a minute these people go on and
[1:16:02] done pull things out the Bible and
[1:16:03] trying to sell it I try to motivate you
[1:16:05] when that's our thing all along let the
[1:16:08] weak say I'm strong I'm not feeling it
[1:16:11] but I'm not even going to speak the
[1:16:12] weakness I'm going to say I'm strong I'm
[1:16:15] an overcomer if you shall say to this
[1:16:17] mountain and don't that's the gospel
[1:16:21] [Applause]
[1:16:28] you may be seated why are you accepting
[1:16:31] sickness I heard a businessman from the
[1:16:33] US said last year he was not sick
[1:16:35] because he told himself I will not
[1:16:38] accept sickness in my body and I was
[1:16:39] like he's not even a
[1:16:41] [Applause]
[1:16:43] Christian when the Bible says life and
[1:16:45] death is in the power of your tongue so
[1:16:47] whatever you speak you can whatever you
[1:16:50] bind on Earth it's not a law you bind in
[1:16:53] heaven whatever you loose on
[1:16:56] Earth so your children they already
[1:16:59] delivered say it speak it your finances
[1:17:03] free your health you are already well
[1:17:07] speak it walk into it Own It claim it
[1:17:11] it's your promise it's the word of
[1:17:15] God you may be
[1:17:17] seated let me give you another example
[1:17:20] whether brandham spoke about this he
[1:17:21] said a blind man came to him he prayed
[1:17:23] for him but the guy didn't know about
[1:17:26] affirmations so he went back he come
[1:17:28] back to the line again but the BR said
[1:17:30] you're healed but I want you to go
[1:17:32] around saying by Stripes I'm Healed by
[1:17:34] Stripes I'm Healed and listen at first
[1:17:36] when he was saying it there was no
[1:17:38] weight in what he was saying because it
[1:17:40] was just words but after a while it
[1:17:42] start to resonate by Stripes I'm heal by
[1:17:44] Stripes I'm heal by Stripes I'm heal by
[1:17:47] stripes and heal until one day his words
[1:17:49] connected with his faith and whenever
[1:17:51] words and Faith connect it's a chemical
[1:17:54] reaction
[1:17:55] something has got to happen so I'm going
[1:17:58] to be filled I'm going to be filled I'm
[1:18:00] going to be healed I'm going to have a
[1:18:02] Revival I'm going to get a breakthrough
[1:18:04] God is going to make a way he will
[1:18:07] deliver me he is going to work it out
[1:18:09] he's going to work it out oh I'm going
[1:18:11] to have joy I'm going to have peace I'm
[1:18:14] going to be adopted I'm going to be
[1:18:16] perfected I'm going to be changed I'm
[1:18:19] going to be transformed I'm going to
[1:18:21] have a Revival I can't stop now I can't
[1:18:24] stop saying it I can't stop believing it
[1:18:27] God said so that settles
[1:18:30] [Applause]
[1:18:44] it can the church say
[1:18:47] Amen he's a little warmer in here feels
[1:18:51] a good in here wonderful Hallelujah Give
[1:18:54] the Lord a hand of
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:19:04] Praise now let me get in a little deeper
[1:19:08] in the M return and Jubilee brother Bram
[1:19:10] said now we find out when Joshua divided
[1:19:13] the inheritance to the people each
[1:19:16] person was placed positionally exactly
[1:19:19] the way these Hebrew mothers named those
[1:19:22] children how they were placed in
[1:19:24] Palestine just at their place Asher G
[1:19:28] and naal and each one Judah everyone
[1:19:31] just placed in their
[1:19:34] position so you must be placed in your
[1:19:37] position what a wonderful picture it
[1:19:39] gets us because it's a type of God
[1:19:43] placing in the church himself listen to
[1:19:46] the prophet he placing himself every
[1:19:49] member every stone every place every
[1:19:53] Christian to itself
[1:19:56] each one of us in our peculiar
[1:19:59] way that's why we can't be like
[1:20:02] everybody else you can't be like the
[1:20:05] person next to you God chose you in your
[1:20:07] own peculiar way you are a flower in his
[1:20:10] garden and he loves you just the way you
[1:20:13] are he loves your height he loves your
[1:20:15] walk he loves your smile all he wants is
[1:20:17] your heart to be a new heart a new
[1:20:19] spirit and his spirit in there can the
[1:20:22] Church Say Amen
[1:20:25] so you know something is wrong because
[1:20:26] brother talk about it some Churches you
[1:20:28] see the spirit of the pastor and the
[1:20:30] people all everybody dress like Pastor
[1:20:34] smileing like the pastor the pastor to
[1:20:36] shake his hands like this everybody
[1:20:38] doing that and they lose their own
[1:20:40] peculiar way because they have the
[1:20:42] spirit of man but what we want is the
[1:20:44] spirit of the Holy Ghost because that's
[1:20:47] the only Spirit that's important because
[1:20:49] I don't know if I'm going to get to it
[1:20:50] but but said man will fail man will fail
[1:20:54] do you understand that preachers will
[1:20:56] fail and God set it up that way so that
[1:21:00] your confidence is not in the man but
[1:21:03] it's in the Holy
[1:21:04] [Applause]
[1:21:08] Ghost you mean God will let the P to
[1:21:10] make mistakes of course because he's the
[1:21:13] one doing the moves because God will
[1:21:15] share Glory with
[1:21:17] [Applause]
[1:21:22] nobody listen God will not even share
[1:21:24] his Glory with the prophet because the
[1:21:26] prophet was on the fields ministering
[1:21:28] and people were baptizing in his name he
[1:21:30] left the convention to go to clean that
[1:21:33] up because he didn't want no worship
[1:21:36] he's not deserving of worship
[1:21:40] Hall only God deserves a worship can the
[1:21:43] church say Amen let's move on so what a
[1:21:47] wonderful picture it gets us because
[1:21:49] it's a type of God's placing in the
[1:21:52] church himself every member every store
[1:21:54] every place every Christian to itself
[1:21:57] each one of us in our peculiar way has a
[1:22:01] place in the house of God hallelujah
[1:22:04] like Solomon's Temple when it was cut
[1:22:06] out all over the world but when it was
[1:22:09] brought into jopa by floated in and took
[1:22:11] there by oxcart and all these rocks had
[1:22:14] their place when the temples went
[1:22:16] together and I think that God down
[1:22:18] through this time has cut out some very
[1:22:20] odd stones that we might not have
[1:22:22] understood amen oh my and there brothers
[1:22:25] and sisters you can't understand but you
[1:22:27] can judge it because God cut the stones
[1:22:31] odd an odd means you can't understand it
[1:22:35] it's odd to you but to God the peace
[1:22:37] fits just where it's supposed to
[1:22:40] be so don't get fight with anybody
[1:22:43] brother so and so where no he's
[1:22:50] odd it's so easy to look at other
[1:22:52] people's problems you know I saw a
[1:22:54] letter from somebody blasting everybody
[1:22:56] I told my dad there's nobody didn't
[1:22:58] blast at least he got to end it to say
[1:23:00] well let me shoot myself too and say I'm
[1:23:02] wrong but you want to shoot me shoot you
[1:23:04] shoot you but the George is this but the
[1:23:06] jerem is this but the mon is when they
[1:23:08] tell you finish you finish you kill
[1:23:09] everybody so you alone going to
[1:23:14] heaven like I saw a meme on Facebook a
[1:23:17] young girl crying and somebody consoling
[1:23:19] her and she's crying and the other girl
[1:23:21] is saying I know he promised you the
[1:23:22] whole world but where were the rest of
[1:23:24] us supposed to
[1:23:27] [Applause]
[1:23:31] stay so the end of the day be careful
[1:23:33] when you go around pointing this one you
[1:23:34] see how that one living how that one
[1:23:37] living has nothing to do with your walk
[1:23:38] with
[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:42] Christ we have to be so mature and grown
[1:23:45] up now that you could come to church and
[1:23:46] your focus is the
[1:23:48] word if other people want to do
[1:23:50] foolishness that's them listen that's
[1:23:53] why there's a remnant
[1:23:55] yeah that is actually a har statement
[1:24:00] huh but it is the truth because I want
[1:24:03] to shake some of you that's why there's
[1:24:05] a
[1:24:06] Remnant and the remnant will be made up
[1:24:08] of people who heard the word but did not
[1:24:11] recognize and act upon it that's why but
[1:24:14] PE hearing recognizing and acting upon
[1:24:15] the word are we there this morning
[1:24:18] everybody with me this morning so when
[1:24:21] you hear and you don't recognize but I
[1:24:24] would like to believe that everybody
[1:24:26] here is hearing and recognizing so the
[1:24:28] issue is the action putting the word of
[1:24:30] God into action the action of
[1:24:32] forgiveness is an action love is an
[1:24:34] action word isn't that right Hallelujah
[1:24:37] worship is an action word I'm a I'm a
[1:24:40] silent worshiper don't worry my mouth
[1:24:41] will ever
[1:24:43] move I'm worshiping in my heart when the
[1:24:46] 24 Elders throw down their
[1:24:48] crowns John say all in heaven heard him
[1:24:51] all on the earth heard him all under the
[1:24:52] Earth heard him and you want to be a
[1:24:54] silent worshiper you worshiping God in
[1:24:55] silence that silence was at least Even
[1:24:58] Silence in the Bible was for a space of
[1:25:00] half hour it was a limit so I pray the
[1:25:03] limit of your silence could be broken
[1:25:04] this morning and you could be free to
[1:25:06] give God a shout of Praise like you've
[1:25:08] never shouted
[1:25:17] before so let's continue do we have time
[1:25:20] this
[1:25:21] morning are you enjoying the word this
[1:25:23] morning
[1:25:27] you know I heard somebody say and I just
[1:25:29] find myself 2017 is just for me but the
[1:25:32] George I've just been so tired of the
[1:25:34] routine and people just coming to church
[1:25:36] going home is just a normal thing and
[1:25:37] say you know what we got to do something
[1:25:40] different so I heard somebody ask a
[1:25:42] professional how long you know in this
[1:25:44] world of modern technology they say
[1:25:45] video is the future so video on Facebook
[1:25:48] video he say how long should should a
[1:25:50] video be short long how to hold people
[1:25:52] attention he said it doesn't matter
[1:25:54] about the length you know it's about the
[1:25:56] content
[1:25:58] am because something could be 10 seconds
[1:26:00] and it's boring but you know much people
[1:26:03] are still watch TV series for days the
[1:26:05] eyes day they holding up
[1:26:07] a because it good they watch a game for
[1:26:09] 5 hours game go to overtime and they say
[1:26:11] well it's only 90 minutes a half of this
[1:26:13] game when the game go now now it go to
[1:26:15] overtime they have they paying more
[1:26:17] attention because it's a tiebreaker and
[1:26:19] in the spiritual realm we have reached
[1:26:21] the
[1:26:22] tiebreaker all the ages that were
[1:26:25] playing this
[1:26:27] game we have now come to the tie breaker
[1:26:30] seven Church ages we at the end of
[1:26:33] finishing of the seventh seal now it's
[1:26:36] overtime we are in overtime this
[1:26:39] morning it's already been spoken time
[1:26:41] shall be no more we in overtime this
[1:26:44] morning but there are some names that
[1:26:47] are written in the book that still need
[1:26:49] to be delivered so we are in overtime
[1:26:52] this morning for your husband for your
[1:26:54] wife for your children
[1:26:57] [Applause]
[1:27:00] woo glory to
[1:27:02] [Applause]
[1:27:09] God so when you come to the house of God
[1:27:11] is to get some good content Mana hidden
[1:27:14] Mana from under the seven seal it eating
[1:27:17] good it tasting good you could share it
[1:27:19] with everybody that's how it's supposed
[1:27:21] to be contagious you should never come
[1:27:23] in here for a
[1:27:27] at but he is downstairs I want a box put
[1:27:30] up somewhere that save frustration right
[1:27:31] outside the door when you walking just
[1:27:34] tap it just say that's it I leave it
[1:27:36] there leave it there and the deacons
[1:27:40] will empty a juny service so you can't
[1:27:41] even pick it up when he walk back
[1:27:47] out Jesus because that's what the gospel
[1:27:50] is Jesus said de at a well have no need
[1:27:53] of a physician but I came to those that
[1:27:55] are sicken and are weary and when he
[1:27:57] finished with you you're healed you're
[1:27:58] delivered you're set free you're not the
[1:28:00] way you used to be and brother Bram
[1:28:02] taught us whenever you come to the house
[1:28:04] of God you either get better or you get
[1:28:07] worse so I pray that by the end of this
[1:28:09] service you all leave here better with a
[1:28:12] confidence and a boldness that you could
[1:28:14] approach the throne of God and say Lord
[1:28:17] I want my
[1:28:19] inheritance I want my portion I want my
[1:28:23] individual experience I want my family I
[1:28:26] want my house can the church say
[1:28:29] Amen so let's move on
[1:28:34] hallelu
[1:28:36] Jesus just
[1:28:39] exactly uh Hallelujah every one of us
[1:28:43] has a place right all these odd rocks
[1:28:44] had their place when the temple went
[1:28:46] together and I think that God down
[1:28:48] through this time has cut out some very
[1:28:50] odd stones that we might not have
[1:28:52] understood
[1:28:54] but they have their place exactly in the
[1:28:56] temple in the building of God so it's
[1:28:59] not our place and that's why somebody
[1:29:01] asked me recently what my thoughts were
[1:29:02] and a matter outside of this church I
[1:29:04] said my authority is limited to to this
[1:29:07] church that's what sovereignity does am
[1:29:10] sovereignity places my responsibility in
[1:29:12] this Sovereign church and God entr trust
[1:29:14] and places the responsibility of other
[1:29:17] churches on their pastors and if they
[1:29:19] don't deal with the situation God is the
[1:29:21] one who will move the pieces out if he
[1:29:23] has to amen amen can the church say
[1:29:26] Amen so I think that God down through
[1:29:28] this time has cut out some very odd
[1:29:31] stones that we might not have understood
[1:29:33] but they have their place exactly in the
[1:29:35] temple in the building of God and Joshua
[1:29:38] by inspiration not by just mathematics
[1:29:41] that's the prophet he inspired by God he
[1:29:45] lotted each one of those Patriarchs in
[1:29:47] their position just exactly the way
[1:29:50] their name belongs what a picture it
[1:29:53] puts before for us of God in his master
[1:29:56] Works no one could have ever done it but
[1:29:59] God there's no way of doing it God Alone
[1:30:03] huh it was for to be there forever it
[1:30:06] was a gift from God God by His Marvelous
[1:30:09] Grace give these people this land in
[1:30:12] this position and place them in it
[1:30:14] according to his word and the birth of
[1:30:16] his people just perfect how it clocked
[1:30:19] right together and I think it was a type
[1:30:21] Hallelujah can the church say amen
[1:30:23] hallelujah and now no one else could
[1:30:25] take that place in other words when God
[1:30:28] places you in your position that's your
[1:30:30] position nobody else could take that
[1:30:33] place it had to be for Israel alone just
[1:30:37] them alone was the only ones that could
[1:30:39] take this place and the blessings on the
[1:30:43] place so only they can take the place
[1:30:45] and the blessings that come with the
[1:30:48] place so when he return to the Lord
[1:30:50] Brother Shan there are some blessings
[1:30:52] that come with returning to the Lord
[1:30:54] when you return to the Lord It's
[1:30:55] returning to your position that you were
[1:30:57] supposed to be in and your blessing is
[1:30:59] tied to your
[1:31:02] position you may be seated So when you
[1:31:05] say I've been a Christian but God has
[1:31:07] not been blessing me are you in your
[1:31:09] place are you where God wants you to be
[1:31:13] because your blessing is tied to your
[1:31:16] position and listen you cannot be living
[1:31:18] in sin when you're outside of your
[1:31:21] position because when you're are in your
[1:31:22] position you are protected
[1:31:25] when you are in your position you are on
[1:31:27] your ground because that's the ground
[1:31:28] God gave to you the only time you get
[1:31:31] yourself in trouble is when you went
[1:31:33] away from your position but this morning
[1:31:36] the message is return unto the Lord
[1:31:38] return to your
[1:31:40] [Applause]
[1:31:41] position can the church say amen God
[1:31:44] bless you brother Hugh good to see you
[1:31:45] how many appreciate brother
[1:31:47] Hugh always working behind the
[1:31:51] scenes amen amen amen
[1:31:54] amen and I do want to recognize Brother
[1:31:58] Thompson brother Timothy Granville
[1:32:01] Brother Francis Timothy who came up here
[1:32:02] I believe last week Thursday to work on
[1:32:05] the sound system there's so many things
[1:32:06] behind the scenes you want to put your
[1:32:07] hands together for
[1:32:13] them listen everything in life takes
[1:32:17] work if they didn't come up this
[1:32:19] wouldn't be working this way this
[1:32:21] morning so you do your part
[1:32:24] ask how you could support because it's a
[1:32:26] kingdom of God it's a move of God it's a
[1:32:28] work of God don't just come and it's
[1:32:30] going to happen no it's going to happen
[1:32:31] when you help make it happen can the
[1:32:33] church say Amen we all have our part to
[1:32:35] play It's one bu right now the leg here
[1:32:38] and and you and the hand you still
[1:32:40] behind
[1:32:41] here but let's move together can the
[1:32:43] church say
[1:32:44] Amen so now no one could take that place
[1:32:47] it had to be for Israel alone just them
[1:32:50] alone was the only ones that could take
[1:32:52] this place the blessings on the place
[1:32:54] and if somehow or other and this might
[1:32:56] be for some of us this morning if
[1:32:58] somehow or other during these times if
[1:33:01] they lost their inheritance by some
[1:33:03] means by some so somewhere along the
[1:33:06] road in your Christian Journey you find
[1:33:08] yourself just not at that place that you
[1:33:13] know where you felt the power of
[1:33:15] God because you know when you got save
[1:33:18] you know when you had experience how it
[1:33:19] was for you but somewhere along the
[1:33:22] journey you have come from that place
[1:33:25] somehow be it your home be it your job
[1:33:28] be it sickness whatever the situation is
[1:33:30] you could look back and no matter what
[1:33:32] the situation is cuz it's different for
[1:33:34] different people you know you are not in
[1:33:36] the place that you're supposed to be so
[1:33:40] but the pr said if they lost their
[1:33:41] inheritance by some means it might been
[1:33:43] poverty it might been some other way
[1:33:46] that they lost
[1:33:47] inheritance their fathers one would
[1:33:49] leave it to his son and he would leave
[1:33:50] it to his son it belonged to the tribe
[1:33:53] it belong to that people forever because
[1:33:55] it was an
[1:33:56] inheritance and if I'm not
[1:33:58] misunderstanding the scriptures wrong I
[1:34:01] believe in a great Millennium that is to
[1:34:02] come you know what I mean they'll take
[1:34:04] right back to that place for we know
[1:34:06] Zion and we preach about Zion and the
[1:34:08] holy city some weeks ago that great City
[1:34:11] they'll not have day or night for the
[1:34:13] light will hang on Zion and I believe in
[1:34:15] the Millennium those tribe will take
[1:34:17] their position again all right now if
[1:34:20] somehow or the other the individual lost
[1:34:23] their inheritance
[1:34:24] that was given to them by God they come
[1:34:26] a year called The Jubilee I see there
[1:34:29] are some Bible Believers here this
[1:34:31] morning the year called The Jubilee
[1:34:34] every seven years they had a rest a
[1:34:36] Sabbath and every seven days they had a
[1:34:38] Sabbath every seven years and the
[1:34:40] seventh Sabbath was 49 years and the
[1:34:42] 50th year was a
[1:34:45] jubilee is anybody with me this morning
[1:34:48] and in this Jubilee every man that had
[1:34:51] lost his inheritance every man that
[1:34:54] found himself away from God away from
[1:34:57] his position away from his
[1:34:59] inheritance in this Jubilee every man
[1:35:01] that has lost his inheritance by some
[1:35:04] means whatever the means was if he was a
[1:35:07] Freeborn and a true blooded Israelites
[1:35:11] no matter who held a position it had to
[1:35:14] go back to him

[1:37:51] right the Bible speaks about it
[1:37:54] of I said the wages of sin sin have
[1:37:56] wages when you do sin you're getting
[1:37:57] paid don't worry you're getting paid God
[1:37:59] do pay he said the workers came and he
[1:38:01] say I going to give you a penny yes
[1:38:03] there those come for the first hour or
[1:38:04] the second hour everybody with me is a
[1:38:07] this gospel is a simple gospel know
[1:38:09] people want to make it complicated so
[1:38:10] mysterious that you leave here your eyes
[1:38:13] open you don't know where you're
[1:38:15] standing you don't know where you're
[1:38:16] going but it's
[1:38:19] simple wages of sin have payment and is
[1:38:21] debt
[1:38:24] but the penny you get even if you're a
[1:38:26] 11 hour worker and you come in last
[1:38:28] minute just before they say we
[1:38:32] paying some people will even but some
[1:38:35] people may even get much work to do you
[1:38:36] know because in 11 hours how much work
[1:38:39] you have to do you have to feel for
[1:38:41] those who started in the first hour you
[1:38:42] know they they would they would have
[1:38:44] done a good 12h hour work and you just
[1:38:46] do one hour but they can look at you
[1:38:48] funny because the master say given the
[1:38:50] same pay the same Holy Ghost the same
[1:38:54] token the same inheritance the same
[1:38:56] signs the same wonders the same Miracles
[1:38:59] the same adoption the same Perfection

[1:39:14] church say
[1:39:15] [Applause]
[1:39:21] amen he didn't have to pay a thing he
[1:39:24] didn't have to do a thing but just stop
[1:39:26] what he was doing and go back to his
[1:39:28] inheritance Oh my he had a right to it
[1:39:31] yes sir it was a god-given right because
[1:39:34] he God by Grace oh oh no no no no hold
[1:39:37] on he had a right it was a god-given but
[1:39:39] he the individual rather by Grace had
[1:39:41] inherited it so God through his grace
[1:39:45] gave him the inheritance and it would
[1:39:47] have been given to his fathers and
[1:39:48] handed down year after year no matter
[1:39:51] what had taken place it doesn't matter
[1:39:54] what the situation is friends no matter
[1:39:55] what had taken place if he lost it it
[1:39:58] must go free it meant Grace is way
[1:40:01] provided for each individual to return
[1:40:04] to their rightful inheritance what a
[1:40:06] picture it gives us tonight of the
[1:40:08] church in this last days hallelujah you
[1:40:11] see what man could do and then you see
[1:40:13] what God does What man does is failing
[1:40:16] and listen to the prophet and will fail
[1:40:19] has failed and always will fail amen
[1:40:23] that's
[1:40:24] right but what God does is eternal and
[1:40:27] must forever remain nothing can ever
[1:40:30] take it away God give it it's his free
[1:40:33] gift and by Sovereign foresight saw it
[1:40:36] and placed it and there's nothing can
[1:40:39] ever move it it's there eternally and at
[1:40:42] Jubilee was God's manner of expressing
[1:40:45] Grace to his people for restoring or be
[1:40:48] brought back to their rightful position
[1:40:51] am amen so friends there's a rightful
[1:40:55] position for
[1:40:57] you young people you heard that there's
[1:40:59] a rightful position for you there's a
[1:41:02] place that you're supposed to be and I
[1:41:05] believe brother Adam said that this is
[1:41:07] the hour again of Jubilee I believe it's
[1:41:09] a time of Jubilee can the church say
[1:41:12] Amen oh can we give the Lord a hand of
[1:41:15] praise
[1:41:24] and brother bam goes on in that message
[1:41:25] return on Jubilee to describe how the
[1:41:28] church has lost its burden and its Zeal
[1:41:32] and it's
[1:41:33] enthusiasm and he speaks about here in
[1:41:36] that same quot
[1:41:37] and he says and brother ly and I as we
[1:41:40] said there and out there that sister
[1:41:42] Mo's father and how he told me in the
[1:41:44] early days back in those days when they
[1:41:45] were persecuted and turned out from
[1:41:48] everywhere that he was a meeting on to
[1:41:50] where they had forbid them to Worship
[1:41:52] the Lord in the
[1:41:53] spirit and a group of people came up and
[1:41:56] shut through the windows with pistols
[1:41:58] and rifles and an old sister standing in
[1:42:01] the floor with her hands up in the air
[1:42:03] praising God while the windows was being
[1:42:06] riddled with bullets and rifles and the
[1:42:08] bullet struck the woman's dress and fell
[1:42:10] to the floor without harming
[1:42:17] her that's that's gospel is that the
[1:42:20] season we're going back to they supposed
[1:42:22] to be powering the Church you are
[1:42:23] Eternal listen to The Prophet after he
[1:42:25] said he say we need to go back to a
[1:42:27] power of God and something that could do
[1:42:30] the same thing today can the church say
[1:42:33] Amen listen although in our numbers but
[1:42:36] but the said persecution always gives
[1:42:38] strength to the church listen to The
[1:42:40] Prophet we've had it too
[1:42:42] easy we get full we get to a place
[1:42:46] where we don't want to move on because
[1:42:48] everything's just handed to us listen to
[1:42:51] The Prophet it takes so sorrow and tears
[1:42:55] and sweat and prayer and faith and
[1:43:00] promise to move forward in the power of
[1:43:03] the holy
[1:43:04] spirit let me say that again it takes
[1:43:07] sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer
[1:43:11] and Fai and promise to move forward in
[1:43:14] the power of the Holy
[1:43:16] [Applause]
[1:43:20] Spirit brother said that Zeal and power
[1:43:23] that they had in those days has long
[1:43:25] time vanished from our assemblies he
[1:43:27] said I'm afraid if the windows would be
[1:43:29] shut out tonight people would run
[1:43:30] everywhere and never come back
[1:43:34] again speaking about the power that
[1:43:37] should be in the
[1:43:40] church in the message the first seal
[1:43:43] could you take some more I'm I'm just
[1:43:45] I'm still on the introduction
[1:43:48] huh in the message of first seal while
[1:43:51] all them Scruples of denomination
[1:43:53] arguing their differences about Creeds
[1:43:55] God promised listen that he would send
[1:43:57] us a true prophet of the true word with
[1:44:00] a message to return I'm talking about
[1:44:03] that return to the Lord to return he
[1:44:05] said to the original word of God and the
[1:44:09] faith of the fathers to do what to bring
[1:44:11] down the power of the Holy Ghost amongst
[1:44:14] the people with a power that will raise
[1:44:17] her above these things and take her in
[1:44:20] at that same time so this prophet of God
[1:44:25] and this word of God is to bring down
[1:44:27] the power of the Holy
[1:44:30] Ghost so when you return to God when you
[1:44:34] return to the word when you return to
[1:44:35] the prophet's message all of a sudden
[1:44:38] you are now a candidate for the
[1:44:40] expression of God by the means of the
[1:44:43] Holy Ghost to bring a power into the
[1:44:45] church a power to not only deal with the
[1:44:48] situations around us but to take us up
[1:44:51] can the Church Say Amen
[1:44:55] [Applause]
[1:45:00] God will bless anyone in the message
[1:45:03] Father the hour has come God will bless
[1:45:05] anyone who will go back to the old
[1:45:09] landmark of the Bible and start from the
[1:45:13] Bible not according to theology or some
[1:45:17] man-made theology but from True Bible
[1:45:20] theology and start from the old landmark
[1:45:23] and move up God will move with you and
[1:45:27] that's what I'm looking for friends to
[1:45:29] start with the Bible because you know
[1:45:30] what the prophet said we have to get
[1:45:32] back to the
[1:45:34] Bible and if you start with the Bible
[1:45:37] the prophet said because the Bible is
[1:45:39] the word of God the ministry of that
[1:45:42] Elijah Prophet was to make clear the
[1:45:45] Loose Ends that are in here that are
[1:45:48] above our pay
[1:45:51] grd above the pay of the Pentecostals
[1:45:54] who could interpret some of it but a
[1:45:56] prophet had to come to open up to an
[1:45:59] elect lady it was not for everybody but
[1:46:02] to an elect lady to open up the
[1:46:04] Mysteries and show you your name in here
[1:46:08] and to show you the journey and the
[1:46:10] battle plans from Glory so you could
[1:46:13] understand where this War Began where
[1:46:15] the war went through the Old Testament
[1:46:17] where the war went through the New
[1:46:19] Testament where the war went through the
[1:46:21] church ages so you could understand the
[1:46:23] devil at every one of his
[1:46:26] tricks and you could overcome and you
[1:46:29] could be victorious because David is
[1:46:32] waiting on you Noah is waiting on you
[1:46:35] Abraham is waiting on you brother
[1:46:37] brandham is waiting on
[1:46:38] you can the church say Amen Oh Glory to
[1:46:43] God somebody give God a shout of
[1:46:47] Praise from the message of zuza Jubilee
[1:46:50] brother B said what we need to do is get
[1:46:53] rid of a lot of our fancy
[1:46:55] fandangos and get back to the Bible and
[1:46:58] back to the oldfashioned Holy Ghost and
[1:47:01] back to the place where man and woman
[1:47:03] look and act and walk like Christians oh
[1:47:06] God take us away from the fancy fangles
[1:47:09] where men and women would look like
[1:47:12] Christians not just on a Sunday but look
[1:47:15] like Christians on a Monday on a Tuesday
[1:47:18] people must see Christian written all
[1:47:19] over you when you walk the street can I
[1:47:22] get a witness come on young
[1:47:24] [Applause]
[1:47:27] people man and woman look like Christian
[1:47:30] act like Christian walk like Christian
[1:47:33] amen you might think I'm a little
[1:47:35] excited that's a prophet he's getting as
[1:47:37] excited as I am I'm just a little crazy
[1:47:40] but I tell you I love to be this way
[1:47:42] that's the prophet do you love to be
[1:47:44] this way do you love this gospel do you
[1:47:47] want to be a real Christian it takes
[1:47:49] sweat it take tears it takes prayer it
[1:47:53] takes Faith but that's the only way is
[1:47:56] birth
[1:47:57] pains but you're going to make it can
[1:48:00] the church say
[1:48:04] Amen
[1:48:06] [Music]

[1:48:10] Jubilee we're talking about going back
[1:48:12] returning to the Lord friends returning
[1:48:14] to the old Landmark returning to the
[1:48:16] scripture to the principles that were
[1:48:18] laid down for us on the day of Pentecost
[1:48:22] by the holy ghost itself but over the
[1:48:25] church ages it just weigh down and weigh
[1:48:28] down and there'll be a Revival and then
[1:48:30] it'll weigh down and Luther's day they
[1:48:31] had mechanical Dynamics and then after
[1:48:34] that but this day is the last day this
[1:48:37] day we have to return to the Lord the
[1:48:40] relationship that Adam lost we are going
[1:48:42] to have that relationship
[1:48:45] back can the church say Amen the whole
[1:48:48] of creation the whole of
[1:48:50] nature but said can will be a tooth AE
[1:48:54] to what's coming all of these sicknesses
[1:48:56] and diseases is because nature is out of
[1:49:00] balance because the sons of God are not
[1:49:02] in their position but God help us today
[1:49:05] a son get into the position nature knows
[1:49:09] when a son is in position God may you

[1:50:51] that prayer meeting amen it's true we
[1:50:54] have just begun to Fashion off just like
[1:50:56] the world do just the same things the
[1:50:59] world does
[1:51:02] right Hallelujah that's right we need to
[1:51:06] return unto the Lord yes sir how it
[1:51:10] happened brother's a lot of Hollywood
[1:51:13] evangelism and a lot of Television
[1:51:15] staying home at night watching
[1:51:17] television instead of going to prayer
[1:51:18] meeting all
[1:51:21] right and in those days he couldn't talk
[1:51:23] about Facebook and YouTube and Instagram
[1:51:27] and PlayStation and Wei but if brother
[1:51:30] anim was in here in this day he would
[1:51:32] deal with that as well because it's the
[1:51:35] time wasting element that sucks away
[1:51:38] your focus and attention from the things
[1:51:40] of God how do you explain somebody I
[1:51:43] missed the Rapture because I was just
[1:51:45] watching
[1:51:46] TV when you should have been at the
[1:51:47] premon or you're so caught up on doing
[1:51:51] stuff on your time that you had no
[1:51:53] respect for God's time you had no fear
[1:51:56] of the Lord which is the beginning of
[1:51:58] wisdom to understand that God will not
[1:52:00] call all the time and he said it seek ye
[1:52:03] the Lord while he might be found so he
[1:52:05] puts a time limit on his grace a time
[1:52:08] limit on his Mercy because grace and
[1:52:10] mercy can't exist forever after a moment
[1:52:14] it switches from grace and mercy to
[1:52:18] judgment in fact the prophet brought it
[1:52:20] out it's not even a mercy seat
[1:52:23] it's a judgment seat but because there's
[1:52:26] blood under the seat it's a mercy seat
[1:52:29] friends there's still blood there's
[1:52:31] still Power in the Blood there's still
[1:52:33] Mercy this morning for you to return
[1:52:36] unto the Lord don't you leave this
[1:52:39] morning if you know you are not in your
[1:52:43] position your prayer life is
[1:52:46] not in the right position your walk with
[1:52:49] God is not in the right position on the
[1:52:53] job you know nobody could tell you a
[1:52:55] Christian because you are just living
[1:52:57] any way you want your neighborhood they
[1:53:00] can't tell you a Christian when we just
[1:53:02] read we're looking for Christians who
[1:53:04] could walk like a Christian act like a
[1:53:07] Christian and live like a
[1:53:10] Christian
[1:53:12] return unto the Lord there's a lot more
[1:53:15] that I have but I'm not going to go too
[1:53:17] much longer the message today is a call
[1:53:21] to return amen her return unto the Lord
[1:53:25] Jesus himself said in Matthew 11:28 come
[1:53:28] unto me all ye that labor and heavy
[1:53:32] laden and I will give
[1:53:35] you rest people tried to find rest you
[1:53:39] know what rest is rest is a pause it's a
[1:53:41] it's a break because so many times in
[1:53:44] life the stress and the struggle and the
[1:53:47] pain could be so
[1:53:49] overwhelming we get frustrated we get
[1:53:52] tired tired we feel like giving up and
[1:53:54] and we look for that rest and then the
[1:53:55] problem is we try to find the rest in
[1:53:58] the wrong places amen that's what drugs
[1:54:02] is you know it's a rest it's a break
[1:54:05] it's an attempt to separate from the
[1:54:07] reality of life and in that moment when
[1:54:09] you are drunk or you are high you have
[1:54:11] rest a break from your life a break from
[1:54:16] your reality but Jesus stood there in
[1:54:19] the volume of the book and said come
[1:54:21] unto me all ye who are heavy laden all
[1:54:25] ye who are weary all ye who are tired
