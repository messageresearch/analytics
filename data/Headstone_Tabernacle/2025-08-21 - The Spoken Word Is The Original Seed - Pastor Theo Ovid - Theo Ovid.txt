Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Let's just give the Lord a hand of praise. If you have your Bibles, like to just turn with me to just a couple verses in Psalms, the 92nd chapter, Psalms 92. Amen. And it says, "It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto his name, oh most high, to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, upon an instrument of 10 strings, and upon the sulttery, upon the harp with a solemn sound, for thou, oh Lord, has made me glad through thy work. I will triumph in the works of thy hands. Oh Lord, how great are thy works, and thy thoughts are very deep." May just bow our heads as we opening a word of prayer.

Just one word from you is all it takes, all that matters. Have your way. I pray in Jesus I ask it. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let the king be lifted up tonight. Amen. So, God bless you. If have your Bibles, I'd like you to turn to Genesis 1 and St. John 1 for a scripture reading tonight. Genesis 1. In the beginning, God created heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form and void. Darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the spirit of God move upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. And God saw the light, which was good. God divided the life from the darkness. And God called the light day. The darkness he called night, and the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, "Let us therefore there be a firmament in the midst of the waters. Let it divide the waters from the waters." And God made the firmament, divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. And God called the firmament heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. And God said, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place." But the dry land appear, it was so. When God called the dry land earth, and the gathering that g the waters called, he sees, God saw that it was good. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed was in itself upon the earth, and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass and herbing seed after his kind. And the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after its kind. And God saw it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day. And from St. John 1 verse one verse verse one says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. May God bless his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh we are blessed privileged to be here tonight &gt;&gt; and I pray that God will speak to you because God will only speak by his word. &gt;&gt; The word is his tools. The word is the means in which he get the message across to the people. &gt;&gt; God himself subject himself to his own word. &gt;&gt; So I have a title tonight. The spoken word is your original seed. &gt;&gt; Now I know brother preach a message on that but we're not uh but we'll see where the Lord will take us tonight. I have an inspiration. The transformation of his own seed word. Now words are powerful and words are seeds. Sometime parents tell the children the wrong thing. They don't even realize it's a seed that they're speaking to their children. &gt;&gt; A seed they're speaking to this one or that one. Sometime pastors may tell the congregation the wrong things or the negative things. But God uses his own word. &gt;&gt; We see it in the beginning in Genesis, God said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; And there was light. &gt;&gt; In other words, there's no other way for God to bring thing into being outside of his word. &gt;&gt; Because in the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. &gt;&gt; So God have to speak it &gt;&gt; before it happens. &gt;&gt; He has to speak it. And brother Anthony tremendously brought out on Sunday how God took the waters and have to use the waters as a womb &gt;&gt; to get the fishes and everything else. &gt;&gt; He had to use an environment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He couldn't bypass that. &gt;&gt; So he set it up that way &gt;&gt; because he put the built-in the fish to swim. &gt;&gt; He put that inside the fish. &gt;&gt; But you can't put the fish to swim on earth. You have to have seas for it. &gt;&gt; So God makes sure there are seas before he get the fish. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? He makes sure there's the earth before he get the beast of the field and make man because he for man out of the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; He didn't fall man out of the sea. He for man of the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So God himself subject himself to the laws or principles of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he subject himself. He can't help it. &gt;&gt; The sun and the rain fall on the just and the unjust. He can't help it. The sun just shines. The rain just fall. But you have to fall on something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that where the seed come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So in the beginning, God had to speak a word for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Before he was God, he was Elohim. We know that self-existent by himself. But he had thoughts. &gt;&gt; And his thought is just as real as his word &gt;&gt; or his expression. &gt;&gt; So even though you were silent or hidden or sealed in his thinking, he had to bring you forth. And he had to create the environment for you to come forth. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, in the original, Adam was supposed to speak for you, &gt;&gt; but Adam fell. &gt;&gt; So, God had to not not redo his plan, but just reorganize how this thing supposed to unfold. &gt;&gt; Because there were many attributes in him, he couldn't express if Adam come true. But because Adam fell, there was an opportunity for him to come with all the attributes of being a redeemer, of being a savior, of being a comforter, of being a healer, of being a whatever you want him to be. He was the I am that I am. He couldn't be the I am that I am if Adam did not fall. But because Adam fell, he a position now to become the I am whatever you have need me to be. And whatever you have need of him tonight, he could be that tonight. But he cannot come out silent his spoken word to produce that for you. He sent his word and you believe it and you're going to see the miracle &gt;&gt; after you receive his word. He don't give it a miracle first. He give it a word first to see if you will believe what he said. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's speaking about this. Let it bring forth of its kind. Whatever it was, it must be brought up of its kind. Now this word of God is eternal. God being infinite cannot speak one thing and then later change it to something else &gt;&gt; to a better decision because every decision of God is perfect. &gt;&gt; He cannot once his word is once spoken it can never die. &gt;&gt; It lives on and on and on and can never die because it is God. &gt;&gt; His word can no more die that he can die. And that's why Baraban pray for somebody and I can't remember what was the condition and the person come and complain and said they'll be you know they doubt and question. He said what did he say? She said he said thus say the Lord said whether you believe it or don't believe it coming to pass. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I do thus say the Lord. That's that's not my opinion. That is say the Lord. If God say the Lord, you going to be delivered. Nothing going to stop the deliverance. I don't care what your father, mother, brother, sister, neighbor, uncle, aunt, mother, doesn't matter who say what you are going to be delivered because it is thus sayeth the Lord. Thus say the Lord cannot fail. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; So once his word is spoken, it will never die. And that's the reason. And then he quote this in St. John the first chapter. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. And the word was made flesh. The same word that was spoken in the beginning with his eternal purpose came on over and was made flesh and dwelt among us. God's word. Could we give the Lord some praises? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right, let's go. Jesus was the fullness of God manifested. &gt;&gt; He was the fullness of the Godhead bodly. Therefore, when he came to the earth, he was manifested in flesh. You were here in him then &gt;&gt; because he was the word. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. The word was made flesh as well among us. The word was made flesh. Therefore, you walked with him &gt;&gt; when you were in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he was on earth, you suffered with him &gt;&gt; and you died with him. You was buried with him and now you are risen with him. &gt;&gt; Manifested attributes of God setting in heavenly places already raised, resurrected to a new life, setting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So at some point in time this have to become a reality that you could see yourself not just as an ordinary walking human on the earth but called to be in Christ Jesus placed in Christ Jesus. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now if we are those attributes of God if if we cannot live by creeds &gt;&gt; we cannot live by denomination. We must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom. You can't live by Facebook. You can't live by WhatsApp. You can't live by what your neighbors say, your wife say, your husband say. You have to live by what God said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can't live by your dreams is what God said. &gt;&gt; Oh god. And God can't lie. &gt;&gt; Everything God say, it's got to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you know inside there I was just thinking when the Lord spoke to my heart when he was in Carwell that we me standing. I was just thinking about that and a brother came up to me a day and say nobody believe that you know I said it doesn't matter &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; I said if God said it &gt;&gt; it will materialize &gt;&gt; it was a total impossibility I know that it's five senses seeing cocoa trees and see all them thing around or something like that didn't &gt;&gt; you understand in the bush &gt;&gt; but God said &gt;&gt; that we'll be here &gt;&gt; right where we are right now &gt;&gt; hallelujah and if he said that it has to materialize &gt;&gt; and everything God said that come out his must materialize Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; So therefore, if we are the attributes of God, &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; Not your mother, child, and your who's your father and who's your mother. Attributes of &gt;&gt; God. And God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; That mean you are attributes son of your spirit. &gt;&gt; And the devil want you to wash your flesh. But you are attributes &gt;&gt; son of his &gt;&gt; spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the attribute son of his spirit. Have to live by the word. &gt;&gt; You have to live by something. Man shall not have bread alone but I every word that proceed out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we are fighting for the words that came out the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; And the mouth of God at his are his prophets. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was not a false prophet. &gt;&gt; He was a true prophet. He's a true prophet and he got the word of God. That's why we are here. We were prophesied to be here. And he that Elijah shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers. The devil is in trouble tonight because the bride come back to the faith of the fathers. Regardless of what you feel have nothing to do with your feelings. It have to do with the faith of the fathers. And the faith of the fathers is God's own faith in the fathers. Oh give the Lord a shout in the house. Let me say it good. The faith of the fathers is God's faith in the fathers. That is the faith of the fathers. He is that faith and that faith is going to come inside of you. It's going to be manifested because works without faith is dead. Oh, give the Lord a shout. It's not a talking faith. It's a walking faith. It's a living faith. It's a manifesting faith. Is a faith that you believe &gt;&gt; and you are justified by that faith. &gt;&gt; What is that word bride? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Like any wife is part of a husband. Therefore, we must be that word brine. &gt;&gt; Now, listen to this description. He's not talking about this tabernacle and our fellowship. He's not talking about that. &gt;&gt; You have to be a word bride. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And hear this. Now, watch. Good. Therefore, we must be that word bride. And what is that word bride? Question. Question. Where's the answer? &gt;&gt; The manifestation of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So when a man talk about he tabernacle and this tabernacle like if you see a one kind of believer he's a liar &gt;&gt; the churches have three kinds &gt;&gt; good bad indifferent ugly whatever &gt;&gt; you understand &gt;&gt; nobody could say this is the Holy Ghost tabernacle &gt;&gt; he said the Holy Ghost could be preached in it &gt;&gt; but this is a tabernacle people come in fellowship in &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is poured out on individuals. Now when you see that I remember at the time I was young about 18 or so and I found a quote right bottom say one is a majority in God &gt;&gt; and I remember dropping on my knees and say Lord I'm a majority &gt;&gt; I got so excited I said I am a majority I don't need two just one &gt;&gt; is a majority in God &gt;&gt; I felt I had direct access as an individual to whatever God promised &gt;&gt; and that is what we have to come to that spot &gt;&gt; to recognize the devil is against us not your brother not your sister not your husband husband, not your wife, no enemy, but flesh and blood. The devil is against us. All hell is against us and we have to fight back. Not your brother, you're fighting, not your sister. You're fighting not to fight another church, but you are fighting that devil. He come to steal, to rob and to destroy. He come to wreck your faith. He come to frustrate you, depress you, upset you, and get you out of the spirit. But he come that you might have life, Jesus, that have it more abundantly. Oh glory to God, we come you tonight to get in the spirit. Oh, glory to God. You're fighting devils all week, but when you come here Wednesday night, you come for a sill. You come for a pause. You come to shaft mark your sword. You come to get your womb sponged. Oh God, your womb sponged. Give the Lord a shout. Pastor on your soul. Oh, glory to God. Med for your head, for your heart, for your mind. You're going to get a fresh touch from heaven. Oh, give the Lord a shout. When they come on a Wednesday night, they come at the hospital, they get a blood transfusion. Oh, glory to God. Some plasma from the word of God to give you a spunk. They give you a spark. All your energy gone, but you come back to get some energy from the life of God, from the power of God, from the spirit of God. Oh, give the Lord some praises. [Applause] There are some people like spiritual vampires. They suck you dry. You talk to them, they dry up. Praise God. They're like bllightes. You don't want to talk to them because they just drain you. You don't want that kind of thing. You want your cup to refill. Praise God. You want to get back some strength. Oh, glory to God. You know, somebody some vampire every time you come to me sucking you. Suck when you see them. So, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You ever get a mosquito flying? Oh, God. And you're doing something. You're doing so. And they looking for blood. You know, &gt;&gt; that mosquito trying to They're not trying to get talk to your ears. It's blood they're looking for. I know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what is the word bride? &gt;&gt; The manifestation of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride not a creed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or a denomination but a living oracle of God. &gt;&gt; A living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the bride that is to be expressed in this hour that we are now living. Amen. &gt;&gt; So this bride is not people sit down in church &gt;&gt; saying I am in the message because you're wearing a long dress and you have a tie. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; No this bride will be the word manifested. &gt;&gt; But when you hear that you have to believe you are going to become that. &gt;&gt; And God can't put a requirement in us that we can fulfill. &gt;&gt; Every time God say that we have to come up to this standard it means he have to make a way for it. &gt;&gt; When God told Moses bring the people to this mountain he knew the Red Sea was going to be in front of them. That was nothing. Oops. Oh, shocks. I never I forget the focus. The Red Sea. But how we how we how we handling this? God never had that problem. How we handling this? His problem was was was with Moses because Moses was the one was complaining and come crying and sighing. Moses was the one that was in out the spirit. He said, "Why cry unto me? &gt;&gt; You supposed to speak &gt;&gt; and move forward because the spoken word &gt;&gt; is the original seed. &gt;&gt; And to move forward, you have to speak. &gt;&gt; Okay. Give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Don't just say it in your head. You have to speak. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he spoke to the Red Sea. And the Red Sea have to open up because the word came out the mouth of God. Moses mouth was God's mouth. Oh, give the Lord a shout. And your mouth going to be God's mouth. And the word that come out your mouth shall not return void. Give the Lord a shout. Glory. You can't think it. You have to speak it. Oh, give the Lord a shout. I say you can't just think it. You have to speak it. Don't think you're going to be healed. Say you're going to be healed. Don't think you'll be delivered. Say, "I am going to be delivered." Let it come out your mouth. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Those dead churches, they can't water the word in their mind. &gt;&gt; He say you water the word with the praises. I know years ago people sleep in the church and the preacher talking about the going on your subconscious. He preaching to people totally out of it. &gt;&gt; And he going ahead. He going ahead with the word. &gt;&gt; He bringing the word and he say going in the subconscious with the Bible for that &gt;&gt; with the scripture for that. The first parable Jesus give is the word is the seed &gt;&gt; that a ser went to sew. &gt;&gt; Some fell on the way side. &gt;&gt; Some fell here. Some fell there from there. &gt;&gt; Then he explained Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Those that fell on the way side, the the crow come and take it. People hear it and enemy come and take it out their mind &gt;&gt; that they wouldn't be converted. They wouldn't jump in their heart. &gt;&gt; And next person hear it, they jump, jump, jump, jump, jump. They excited bad. Afterwards, they jumping out &gt;&gt; because of no roots. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They have wayside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rocky &gt;&gt; and then have the Ties. &gt;&gt; They start to grow. &gt;&gt; Yes. But vines &gt;&gt; after this up to the day this evening I clean some vines them vines are easy you know but &gt;&gt; tiny tiny fellas you know &gt;&gt; but they weaving boy they weaving they we plant your flowers if you don't cut them off they if you stand too long they weave around you &gt;&gt; their objective is to choke &gt;&gt; that what cares of life does &gt;&gt; that's what you all your business and all them natural that what that does choke you Yes. &gt;&gt; So you have to know when to cut them vines. &gt;&gt; You don't know how to tackle it, but this evening &gt;&gt; cut the head off. &gt;&gt; Went out for them. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; A people hear the message and went out for them. &gt;&gt; They say watch neighbor house. You know &gt;&gt; watch slack man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; His house overtake with vines. I watch them vines. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you watch a slack believer, &gt;&gt; you know going on. &gt;&gt; Vines overtake your life. &gt;&gt; And it comes so simple, so subtle. divise up divise up big muscles and thing you know there tiny guys and they start working if you see them &gt;&gt; when you're wetting watching them wet have a lime tree from the house I wet it watching the vine ting it up &gt;&gt; but I know I coming for that because he waiting for the water to where he say hallelujah glory glory glory when I wet he getting wet too &gt;&gt; you understand what I'm saying I am wet the line tree but divine said hallelujah glory glory glory &gt;&gt; but tonight but today that was the end of all that glory glory glory &gt;&gt; come to take them out and we have to come and take them vines out. Choke your life. Choke your prayer life. Choke your prayers. Oh, glory to God. Choke your shout. Choke your passion to know the word. Come on now. Choke the cry to get in your spirit. Choke the passion to please God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Martin Luther could not express the attributes that we express because that was in the beginning the resurrection like the corner wheat. You see the whole program of the church is built upon divine revelation. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not was what he was in another hour. What he was now the Bible expresses it is growing in the bride to the full stature. &gt;&gt; So he is saying this stature of the perfect man has to grow in a bride. [Music] Now when the when the mango push out flowers &gt;&gt; and the fruit start to come, &gt;&gt; the fruit is not matured yet. &gt;&gt; It's a young pick it yet. &gt;&gt; It's young. It's green. It's coming. &gt;&gt; Afterwards it get mature. Afterward it have no more growth. &gt;&gt; It come to the peak of its growth. &gt;&gt; Then the mango begin to turn color. &gt;&gt; It getting ripe. Because if the growth period is is finished, &gt;&gt; you can't grow no more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have to ripen. &gt;&gt; He said, I believe intellectually the church is hearing a message, but their faith isn't ripe enough. &gt;&gt; So the faith could grow, &gt;&gt; mature, and then get ripened. &gt;&gt; And he said to get ripen, you have to lay in presence. So presence have to be introduced to the church that you could rock back in that &gt;&gt; that you could live in that. It can't be you come to church like this is where the the the pipes is at and only when you come to church you access that. No, you have to access it every day. &gt;&gt; It is yours to access. The veil of the temple was rent from the top to the bottom to give you direct access rights. The devil can't access that. Hallelujah. Password wrong password. He don't have access denied. He can't access that. But you, little lady Jesus, you can access that tonight. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So, here it is. Therefore, the bride in the rapture will come forth and it is all pre-planned by God. &gt;&gt; It's all backed up. He know every man, every place who would set all about it. It's all pre-planned. God knew it would be here. He's going to be prepare a place for us. When we get there, it's all to be prepared. Just like even this night is prepared. This hour is prepared. His great forn knowledge tells him all these things. Here we go. He's he's omnipresent because he's omnisient. Omniscient means he knows all things. He's not in the bar by by the man who hit in his vat 19 and is wrong. He's not sitting down with any man there, but he knows what going inside of there. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; He can just be like the wind over the earth. &gt;&gt; No. Oh, sorry. I I read that wrong. He can't be just like the wind &gt;&gt; over the earth &gt;&gt; because he's a being. &gt;&gt; He isn't a myth. &gt;&gt; He is a being. &gt;&gt; He dwells. &gt;&gt; He even dwells in a house. &gt;&gt; He dwells in a place called heaven. Therefore, by his omnipresent being omnisient, knows in all things, then he is omnipresent because he knows all things. &gt;&gt; Here we go. Here I want to get to now. Now you grew from your birth. When you were born and presented into this world, God knew that you were going to be here on this earth &gt;&gt; and you growed from birth to maturity. &gt;&gt; And things that seem so strange to you in your young womanhood, young boyhood as children now seem very real. &gt;&gt; You couldn't understand it when you was a child. But now you become an adult. You begin to understand and find out that everything was just set just right. It is really means something to you now. So it is in your spiritual birth. You do things that you don't understand when you were a little baby. Come to the altar. You give your life to Christ. You do strange things. You wonder why you did it. But after a while, when you mature as matured Christians, then you understand it. &gt;&gt; There is something picks up. You see why you had to do it? Your spiritual birth. Your natural type bird type. You're spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is fitting in your life as you grew. Fitted right in because you were made for that. Wasn't it a strange thing the night you staggered into the mission tent meeting a church and there somewhere in the corner. See, God knew before the foundation of the world. It seems strange to you, but why you did it then? But now you understand. You know what happened. &gt;&gt; It is so fitting to your life. I don't believe that person just happened to be here by chance. Now just think when you come into this world everything have to be for prepared for you &gt;&gt; or pre-prepared rather. I don't hardly understand how we could think that God could prepare all these good things for us and he could not put trust and we could not put trust in him. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. That if he brought us into this chaos that we in now and prepare the good things of life for us, how much more we could trust him &gt;&gt; to prepare the things that is to come. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Come on, trust him. He was good for you when you're young. &gt;&gt; When you're old, he's still good. &gt;&gt; That's why David said, "Now that I'm old, forsake me not." Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you're young, you're strong. You have energy. As you get older, you don't have the energy. I was young. &gt;&gt; You think God don't understand that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go quickly now. &gt;&gt; So, here's the predestinated plan in plain view. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just as others seed, &gt;&gt; the word of God is a seed &gt;&gt; and must have the ground prepared beforehand. &gt;&gt; If you sow seed, just throw it out in the ground. It would do no good. &gt;&gt; The birds will pick it up. Jesus spoke a parable on that, right? So the ground had to be first. &gt;&gt; So God, here we go. You ready? &gt;&gt; In sovereign grace &gt;&gt; prepares the heart first. And he prepared you &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; to receive him in this age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He forneew you by his fornowledge &gt;&gt; and ordained you to eternal life. &gt;&gt; He knew you. &gt;&gt; Therefore he prepared you. &gt;&gt; Now you understand the scripture. Who he forneew? &gt;&gt; He called. &gt;&gt; Who he called? He justified. Who he justified. He had already glorified. And if God be before us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? It is God that justify it. Let the dogs back this caravan moving on. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Oh, hallelujah. The dogs back in, but the chain moving on. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; It is God that justify it. Not man that justify it. Like the song said, you may remember. You remember all the things I've done, but Jesus with your special blood forgive me of everyone. He picked me up. He turned me around. Oh God, give me a brand new song. But Jesus dropped the charges. Now I'm free. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. He dropped the charges even though I was wrong. Oh, glory to God. He dropped the charges. Show me right from wrong. He dropped the charges. And at Calvary, case dismissed. &gt;&gt; Case dismissed. &gt;&gt; Case dismissed. &gt;&gt; Bring up my case, but my case is dismissed. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Abraham said, &gt;&gt; it go surprise people who are cross. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. It go surprise a lot of people here. &gt;&gt; I didn't know you was going to make it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So watch God in sovereign grace prepared the heart first. &gt;&gt; So he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age. &gt;&gt; He forneew you by his fornowledge and ordain you to eternal life. He knew you. Therefore he prepared you. &gt;&gt; That's the reason you staggered out of these things and staggered into what you have now. It was God leading you to a place that he ordained for you. &gt;&gt; If this ground isn't prepared beforehand, hear the bomb, it can't grow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So maybe that is why we are so much a when you say shorties, so much has stunted Christians. &gt;&gt; People that they come and you recognize, well, &gt;&gt; all they have is years on them. They're not growing. &gt;&gt; Something kind of wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch. &gt;&gt; That's the reason the seed of faith &gt;&gt; when you are preaching faith. I'll skip that. All right. All right. Let's get to the seed word now. Jesus is the word of God. &gt;&gt; And he was busted open that life. &gt;&gt; The life is inside the seed. &gt;&gt; So this spoken word &gt;&gt; son, &gt;&gt; second son, &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; He had the life inside of him. &gt;&gt; And God had to bust him open. &gt;&gt; So Calvary wasn't just he died for me. Calvary was about open up the seed. &gt;&gt; The seed son which is the son with the germ &gt;&gt; to release life &gt;&gt; which is the water &gt;&gt; to the seed. &gt;&gt; God have to work with his word. &gt;&gt; The water have to come to water the seed. &gt;&gt; He know the seed is on the earth. &gt;&gt; The devil don't understand that because your forn knowledge is your gene germ &gt;&gt; inside of you. Whether you're smoking, drinking, carrying in the world, it is something inside of you that he can say come, come, come. You can't explain it. That's why you stall out of what you're in into what you're in now because of what inside of you. But he had to bust open that seed word to release the life to hunt you. The spirit life have to go after you. Give the Lord a shout. You just come. The father had us to send a spirit. Seven spirits &gt;&gt; throughout the whole earth &gt;&gt; to find you and he has found you. Oh, that's a reason to shout tonight. That's a reason to praise God tonight. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's put a B and present it here now for us. &gt;&gt; The life is inside the seed. &gt;&gt; This life which is spirit water flowing over the spirit over the seed of God will bring forth the life of the seed. Let every seed &gt;&gt; bring forth &gt;&gt; after its kind. &gt;&gt; You don't know what kind it is. Let every seed &gt;&gt; bring forth &gt;&gt; after its kind. &gt;&gt; We don't know what kind it is. But when the spirit fall, when the water fall and that sea begin to break out, it will reveal itself. Oh, give the Lord a shout. If that's the son of God, it will produce a son of God. If that's the seed of God, it will produce a reality of God. Oh, give the Lord a shout. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. In the beginning was the seed. Oh glory. And you are that seed now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 was a seed. &gt;&gt; Behold Elijah. &gt;&gt; Nobody knew that who that was. Nobody could say who that was. You had people who before brother man was playing Elijah. All kind of people were playing that. But when William Brandon came, he connected that word. &gt;&gt; That become his word. because he was that seed. And when the water fell on him, he knew he was that Elijah. He knew he was anointed and commissioned to get a people that going to turn the hearts back to the faith of the fathers. He knew he had to bring the entire message. So he had to connect with Revelation 10:7, 7th angel message. He had to connect with Luke 17:30 to reveal the son of man. He had to connect with a bride word. And Holy Spirit told him, "Pick up your pen and write. In the last days, the true bride will come to the headstone. She'll be a super race. All these are words from the mouth of God. She'll be a super race, a super church as she nears the headstone, not a weak church, not an intellectual church, not a dead set church. No, not that kind of church at all. But the original planting has been restored. The original planting was on the day of Pentecost. And if that original branch comes forth again, it will produce another book of acts. Not book of talk, book of acts, not a book of mysteries, book of acts. Oh, give the Lord a shout. The acts of the Holy Ghost. Oh, glory to God. I am looking for it. Looking for what? Another book of Acts. It has to be the acts of the Holy Ghost. No. No. Acts a man. &gt;&gt; I was telling I was telling my wife about churches and men who want to expose and expose and expose. They think they have the ministry of exposing affairs. But that whole exposing thing is already tell the people what they're not telling the people. There are people who preach and the people hearing what they're not saying. When you say this one false, this one falls, this one falls, this one falls, this one falls. What you actually saying is I am right. &gt;&gt; So the people comforting everybody else we alone. &gt;&gt; Deceived. &gt;&gt; Dumb and deceived. deceived. &gt;&gt; So we are not here and we see but God is not into craft. &gt;&gt; God is not crafty. &gt;&gt; Bible talk about twisting the word and so on. God is wisdom &gt;&gt; not craft. &gt;&gt; He don't say we had to say he don't go wrong and wrong and you have to you know you're getting this here and no he don't talk that kind of way. &gt;&gt; He said let there be light &gt;&gt; and he separate light from the darkness &gt;&gt; and he name it. He called the darkness day night and the day. He called it the light. He called it day. &gt;&gt; He just named it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He He named the bride revival too. &gt;&gt; He just said revival. Any revival? He says there no revival yet to wake up the bride. It will take them seven thunders. &gt;&gt; And I can't say that. I'm not supposed to say that. I didn't get permission to say that. Who are supposed to ask to say that? Which bishop I supposed to ask to say that? He will send it. He promised it. The seventh turn is to wake up the bride. Like Anthony say, not dead, but they're sleeping. He said the bride had not revival yet. &gt;&gt; You know what revival does? It set a charge in your [Applause] &gt;&gt; All that blues are leaving. &gt;&gt; He said, sisters, can you wash the dishes? &gt;&gt; A revival in tongue. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This message will need a revival. I ain't saying that to exclude us. We need a revival. &gt;&gt; The whole thing need a revival. &gt;&gt; It's 40 plus years. Chugalog. Chugalog. Chugalog. Chugalog. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This war between Russia and Putin. &gt;&gt; Russia. Look what Putin supposed to be some big bad thing and and and and Ukraine keep innovating. &gt;&gt; Ukraine and Russia. sending all them drones and whatnot. The whole warfare, the whole thing about warfare different Ukraine don't have the the numbers of men to fight Russia. &gt;&gt; But they send in drones like story. No, the other day they had a robot &gt;&gt; robot shooting gun &gt;&gt; and and have a voice in robot saying surrender. &gt;&gt; I couldn't believe it. I said and we look at this here. &gt;&gt; A robot &gt;&gt; shooting gun like man about surrender. &gt;&gt; Give up. man surrendering to drone. &gt;&gt; Somebody far away looking and and sending and sending miss &gt;&gt; remote control from a distance. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When Peter was in prison, some believers far away was praying for Peter. &gt;&gt; Angel stepping. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Open up the door. Let the chains fall over Peter. Walk out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Peter come by the door and knock, they said, "Nah, that can't be Peter. The angel &gt;&gt; God answer prayer and they &gt;&gt; they don't even want to open the door to the prayer that God answered. &gt;&gt; Peter says me. Yes. All you have to eat. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Go jail food now right here. &gt;&gt; You see what I'm talking about church? &gt;&gt; B said we haven't seen power yet. &gt;&gt; There's a power coming in the church and now it's coming in &gt;&gt; where men will speak the word &gt;&gt; and it will flash like lightning. see power yet. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's power yet. And we have to Hallelujah. We have to have a rehearsal. &gt;&gt; We can't just walk into power. &gt;&gt; You can't just walk into this thing. You have to have stage one, stage two, stage three. That's what the bear and the lion was about because Golth was coming. Golth was always coming. But who could deal with Goliath? Who could fight with Golth? A man had to handle the bear first, the lion after. And he was prepared and ready &gt;&gt; beforehand. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do y'all shout in the house? &gt;&gt; God didn't tell David David y with the land and rub gad come you. No. God didn't say that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He just give him the test. &gt;&gt; He give him the experiences. If David the first bear David take up like a bullet and say sheep in you. David how you car looking like you're driving straight ahead. &gt;&gt; He can't face Golad. God had David part two, &gt;&gt; David Junior, David assistant or something. So like that. So God knew what experience is yet down the road. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So let me tell you plain. Stop complaining. &gt;&gt; Quit griping. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you may see nothing yet. &gt;&gt; Dreadful times still lay ahead. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; People hearing me tonight and they saying amen on that. &gt;&gt; I didn't say that. That's in the message. &gt;&gt; Dreadful times lay ahead right now. We in the best times right now we could have &gt;&gt; Mr. Tariff tariffing all over the world. &gt;&gt; So what up with prices and and life and quality of life with Mr. tariff tariffing? &gt;&gt; America in the greed. America with all the the debt and whatnot. But say they broke long time you know &gt;&gt; they have no money you know &gt;&gt; they living off of money to come you know &gt;&gt; so anytime the whole thing could crash &gt;&gt; and everybody going in the whole you know Brazil India Russia South America the bricks and everybody going into the alignment &gt;&gt; because of what is to come &gt;&gt; peace system is on its way &gt;&gt; but not on its way it's here already &gt;&gt; it's Is the pressure come to us yet? Because they have none the press for &gt;&gt; y Bible. Everybody have Bible Bible. &gt;&gt; So that they not the press for Bible spoken word books on the earth years for 40 50 years. Does that not the issue? &gt;&gt; The issue will be the manifested word. &gt;&gt; He said they're going to hate you because you are Joseph. The word he can work through rejected. If you think the manifested word will be loved in this message, you are dead wrong. &gt;&gt; After all that hatred and jealousy, the fighting the revelation of Jesus Christ through them seven seas and seven thunders. When that word become manifested, you think they will tell the believers, "Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus." Not a bit of it at all. &gt;&gt; When that word became manifested and the showdown came, &gt;&gt; they say, "We have Judas here." &gt;&gt; Not Judas. Um, Barabas. Which one you want? Somebody say, "Give us &gt;&gt; Barabus." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He wasn't the messenger, you know. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the messenger, you know. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; What shall we do with Jesus &gt;&gt; called the Christ? Crucify him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me sting you a little bit. You may be seated. So the bride which will be the word manifested &gt;&gt; would be rejected first in this message. &gt;&gt; Then the government will come down. &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. &gt;&gt; The bride &gt;&gt; which will be &gt;&gt; not this tabernacle. &gt;&gt; We not talking about this church. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about that. This bride is universal. &gt;&gt; This bride is around the world. Nobody have the bride hold the bride and only the bride here. That is foolishness. This bride is belong to the body of Christ. And by one spirit you get inside that body. When you're in that body, nobody can put you out. Nobody can put you in and they can't take you out. This bride baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ. Manifesting the word for the hour will be rejected. &gt;&gt; Upon that rejection, judgment comes. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; But the bride will have the power &gt;&gt; to face it in that hour. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The government couldn't come down unless they rejected Jesus. &gt;&gt; Who rejected him? The priest &gt;&gt; dare. Who there? The most holy people &gt;&gt; in the most holy place rejected the Christ. &gt;&gt; What shall I do with Jesus called the Christ? What shall I do with them seven thunders &gt;&gt; living in the people? &gt;&gt; What did the prophet said? What we see should make a church that people refining and say the seven thunders is being manifested. Oh give the Lord a shout not explain nor talk manifested [Applause] &gt;&gt; two things. &gt;&gt; What the thunders is and what the thunders does. &gt;&gt; Seven thunder revelation. &gt;&gt; Seven thunder manifestation. He say if that be so then the seven thunders cap the pyramid. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he put the seven thunders in the holy spirit slot &gt;&gt; which is the spirit of Christ coming into the church to manifest them virtues. &gt;&gt; Oh give the lord a shout manifest those virtues and Satan &gt;&gt; have to know it's there. &gt;&gt; He said you you don't have to show off like that. He all them thing have to be tested in you. Tested what? What? faith, &gt;&gt; virtue, &gt;&gt; knowledge, &gt;&gt; temperance, &gt;&gt; patience. &gt;&gt; Man blowing the top without a test. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just the plain old trinity temper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Man, man acting rowdy without even a test coming. Daddy test. Your wife is your test. What is your test? &gt;&gt; The church is a test. The passing the test. Elder is a test. &gt;&gt; Sickness is a test. &gt;&gt; You want to cuss because you're sick. &gt;&gt; The test already come yet. Because the faith of God was in Job. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God could call out God could call out to Satan &gt;&gt; and say, "Have you considered my servant Job?" &gt;&gt; So So Satan start to explain, "Well, the way I see him, I see him like a hedge around him. &gt;&gt; You're a special protection around that man. So why you ain't going nearby there? I ain't touching because you have a big hedge." &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; God says, "No, that no no no, not so what you seeing." &gt;&gt; So Satan, he ask me a crack now. He's not backing down yet. &gt;&gt; He know God have a hedge around him. He's seeing protection. He's seeing blessings. But Satan backing down. Give him a crack. Said take a crack, but don't touch his life. Protection. He's seeing blessings. &gt;&gt; Take a crack, but don't touch his life. &gt;&gt; And he hit Job where it hurts the most. &gt;&gt; Hit his children, hit his flocks, hit his family. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him &gt;&gt; until he hit his health. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when your health get hit a big hit &gt;&gt; because your money doesn't count then you know your swimming pool come you know &gt;&gt; people driving back car that doesn't count then you know &gt;&gt; is your health is the most important thing you know &gt;&gt; and his precious wife &gt;&gt; who in church with him so long &gt;&gt; who married so long &gt;&gt; say God &gt;&gt; how much insurance you have in his back there why curse God on debt He had a choice, you know. &gt;&gt; Bust some cuss. Carry on. &gt;&gt; Expose her. &gt;&gt; You wicked woman. Mind you, all these years I buy fish and stove. You know, you know talking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He didn't go down that road. &gt;&gt; Why are you going down that road? and you even had job test and you open your mouth and saying all kind &gt;&gt; keep quiet. &gt;&gt; Try to catch what God want to reveal to you. &gt;&gt; Keep quiet. &gt;&gt; Hush a little bit. Stop being so talkative. Just hold your peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that man with virtue. &gt;&gt; So you speak like a foolish woman. &gt;&gt; He only could say that because he had virtue. Yes, &gt;&gt; he had something in him that brought it out with kindness. &gt;&gt; There are many when he test come you under pressure. Charity is kind not itself is not puffed up. It's not easily provoked. It think no evil. It rejoices not iniquity but rejoices in the truth. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's a character. &gt;&gt; That's a lie. That's not a text to preach on. &gt;&gt; That is what shakes the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the thunder that shakes the devil. &gt;&gt; Shake and thunder shake. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me see wrap up here. I don't know how to wrap up here. &gt;&gt; But if the spirit of God comes forth to water the seed, if it is the seed it is watering, it will produce the life of the seed. It will produce the life of the seed because that is what it is given for. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the water release is the water for the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember what the prophet said, know the life working on. &gt;&gt; She waiting for the life. &gt;&gt; So you put that a 8 volt battery in this big engine the bride have in it and trying to start. It can't tumble. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might get the horn make a peep but that car turn no engine. &gt;&gt; You need the right kind of battery for that. &gt;&gt; You need the right kind of life for that. &gt;&gt; When you put that so the whole thing rumble &gt;&gt; and the devil know you're on your way. That's why I say leave you with smoke in the devil face. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You don't want to be standing by your car. Oh, God. You see the rims, you see the You see the color, you see the paint, you see the texture, you see how it blending and whatnot, but the car can start. &gt;&gt; A tricycle passing you &gt;&gt; and you have a nice long car that cannot start &gt;&gt; because you full of mechanics and torque. &gt;&gt; But somebody pass you with mechanic and dynamic the foot moving so on the wheel. a bicycle. &gt;&gt; But this bride will have mechanics &gt;&gt; and dynamics, word and spirit, &gt;&gt; power and demonstration. Oh, I will never stop preaching this who vexed loss. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Who upset that is the business? But this is what Peter had. And we ought to get nothing less than that because seed in Pentecost was the original planting. That was the original seed. They give the Lord a shout. Jesus tell them you shall receive power not revelations power &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost come upon you. &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; All the revelations and mysteries he opened their understanding. He opened the word to them. They had revelation. They had mysteries. They had understanding open to them. But what they need was power. Power is the water. Power is the spirit. Power is the anointing. Power is what breaks the yoke. Jesus himself said, "The spirit is upon me because he has anointed me." He couldn't say it if it wasn't so. He said it because it was real. He said it because it was present tense. He said this day the scripture is fulfilled. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The Bible descript Jesus described Jesus and a man that God anointed with power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. John the Baptist &gt;&gt; didn't have any power &gt;&gt; because his purpose was to introduce Messiah. &gt;&gt; Repent. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just words coming out of his mouth. &gt;&gt; And convictions hit in the heart. And when he se you know &gt;&gt; you go here dry say come wet one. &gt;&gt; Don't just come in water fruit here. I don't come to church again. Go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was so anointed on the mechanics of preparing away for Messiah that the scribe and Pharisee are you the one? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Or should we look for another? &gt;&gt; Who tell them to tell John that &gt;&gt; now? If another man hear that, you know who I am. &gt;&gt; Not Jonah. No sir. Just say me, you have to be kidding. &gt;&gt; The one coming after me. &gt;&gt; I'm not even waiting to open. I I can't even look like his shoes. &gt;&gt; That one that coming, &gt;&gt; he going to baptize. He said, "I baptize with water." &gt;&gt; But that one is fire, man. &gt;&gt; Fire. &gt;&gt; There's not an apostle coming, not a prophet coming. That is the Lord himself coming. Give the Lord a shout. That's the Lord himself. and he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost. The same Holy Ghost they reject in the message. The same Holy Ghost they don't want in the message. &gt;&gt; The same Holy Ghost Esau despised &gt;&gt; that that Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; power &gt;&gt; I supposed to expect it? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If I don't preach it how you expect it. If I tell you why I dream last night, I didn't dream last night by the way, so I can't tell you that one. &gt;&gt; But if I tell you why I dreamed last night, &gt;&gt; what you expect? &gt;&gt; Nice thoughts. &gt;&gt; I dream a flowery bed. I dream adoption and I was up in the air. No, I ain't dream that. I just see nothing. &gt;&gt; What you do with that? The pastor dream is up in the air. We have a good pastor. &gt;&gt; Are you crazy? &gt;&gt; That's the word. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what somebody dream &gt;&gt; or what somebody thinks. &gt;&gt; The spoken word &gt;&gt; is the original seed. &gt;&gt; And for the word to be manifest, it have to come to seed. &gt;&gt; Seed is spoken. &gt;&gt; Seed is expressed. &gt;&gt; My daughter is going to be delivered. &gt;&gt; My son is going to be delivered. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where we have to speak it. We are going to have a revival. You are going to be delivered from your fears, from your past, from your history. &gt;&gt; All right. Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Wishes were Sunday, but it's a Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; All right. Where am I at Brown? Jesus, he was the seed that Eve should have produced. &gt;&gt; Do you get it? &gt;&gt; But she hybrid by disbelieving God's word. So he was that seed and the only way life could be in the reproduction of life, life had to come through that seed &gt;&gt; and that seed had to die. Here we go. &gt;&gt; In order to spread out the life. &gt;&gt; That is why the water was given. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The water is to water the seed. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit that was in the garden of Eden &gt;&gt; was to water the seed. Man wasn't made to die. He was made to live. &gt;&gt; But high breathing brought death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God had a germ of life. &gt;&gt; That germ of life come from the real seed &gt;&gt; and God proved it was his seed because he rose him up again. &gt;&gt; So Jesus said, "Destroy this body &gt;&gt; and in three days &gt;&gt; I will raise it up &gt;&gt; myself." &gt;&gt; Because he know that teeth have power in it. They have power. Resurrection power &gt;&gt; set on a timer. It looked like he was dead, brother Anthony. But he was not dead. &gt;&gt; When they thought he was dead, he was not dead. He was active and alive. He went down to the halls of hell and went and opened the door. And when they were toasting their champagne that he is dead on the cross, he knocked on the door and they said, "It cannot be anybody else because everybody is here." And they saw the mighty conqueror. And he took the keys of death and hell from Satan as have cut the keys. They couldn't believe it was Jesus, but it was Jesus. And he rose from the dead. And he's alive tonight to confirm his word. He's alive tonight to vindicate his word. He's alive tonight to prove he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Watch. He prove he was seed. He rose him up again. &gt;&gt; That through that life that was going over the original seed like it was given to Eve or his real church is bringing forth life again &gt;&gt; through the birth &gt;&gt; through the womb of his bride. &gt;&gt; So the bride now becomes a womb &gt;&gt; to bring forth children. &gt;&gt; He say it is rich. It is glorious. &gt;&gt; He said he was that seed that was produced by the word that say be it done unto me &gt;&gt; according to thy word. That is the seed. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus, here we go, is the word made manifest. &gt;&gt; So the word made manifest is Jesus. &gt;&gt; St. John 1:1, &gt;&gt; in the beginning was the word with God was God and the word became flesh. &gt;&gt; It is still God. &gt;&gt; It's the word manifested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that makes the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. That's the reason that God manifested himself so perfectly in Jesus because he was the seed word, &gt;&gt; the germ word, &gt;&gt; look, look how specific the words are. He's speaking the germ that was inside the seed that the life in the seed. Do you get it? He talking about Christ was the germ word of God. &gt;&gt; He's going deeper. The germ is the spirit. &gt;&gt; He's going deeper. The germ is the water. &gt;&gt; Fight that. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Let them fight that. Brother Clarence, &gt;&gt; the germ is the spirit. &gt;&gt; The germ is the water. &gt;&gt; Which one you want? &gt;&gt; The words that I speak unto you. &gt;&gt; Jesus said they are spirit. &gt;&gt; And they are life. So the word spoken word &gt;&gt; coming out the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; He said he that believeth on me as the scripture had said &gt;&gt; out of his belly &gt;&gt; shall flow &gt;&gt; rivers of living water. &gt;&gt; This spake he &gt;&gt; of the spirit &gt;&gt; that was not yet released &gt;&gt; because Jesus didn't die yet. He was prophesying that something going to break inside of you &gt;&gt; and you going to have it abundantly &gt;&gt; more abundantly. &gt;&gt; It going to flow. &gt;&gt; That river going to flow. &gt;&gt; You are going to be like that man in Psalms one &gt;&gt; planted by the waters. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Are you ready now? &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; had to be broken open &gt;&gt; in order for that seed to let forth its life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to water other seed that was coming. &gt;&gt; Did you get it now? &gt;&gt; So his life was busted open &gt;&gt; to release a spirit &gt;&gt; because other seeds is coming &gt;&gt; and other seeds need that water &gt;&gt; or that spirit &gt;&gt; to come aliveise. &gt;&gt; Now God have to find you know &gt;&gt; in the dirt. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch here. Watch. They are going to get that word. That's and stay right with it. I'm sending forth the spirit to water it. It will produce miracles. It will produce the power of God. And that's why it'll be very comic, not really comical. When every time you talk about power and whatnot, people have a problem with that. &gt;&gt; They don't like to talk about power, miracles, speaking in tongues, they go so Pentecostal, &gt;&gt; like that Pentecostal church, that Pentecostal group. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Well, here watch. God is taking you now to reveal himself again &gt;&gt; through his church. &gt;&gt; The resurrected body of the Lord Jesus Christ. Resurrected out of churchianity. Resurrected out of cold formal churches. Resurrected out of fanaticism. God is bringing forth a bunch of bones and putting skin on it in the power of the Holy Ghost that will bring the gospel in this last day with signs and wonders to the end of the world. They will teach the Bible. They will stand by it. They will live by it. They will not compromise right or left. They will stand right on the word and move on. And God will be with them daily confirming the word with signs and wonders following. Or could we hear a shout in the house? &gt;&gt; That is the prophecy hanging over you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will be with them daily &gt;&gt; confirming the word with signs following. All right. &gt;&gt; Cast up now in the middle. &gt;&gt; The plane about to take off now. &gt;&gt; Now Eve, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Received the wrong seed word. &gt;&gt; That's right. Listen close. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what Satan tried. She shook him away. Mary shook him away. Um Mary said the and the holy the angel told Mary the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you. It's the word of God. She said be it unto me &gt;&gt; right up in Judea. Mary. So so Eve get and receive a wrong seed word. &gt;&gt; I know it produce a life. So it's not only God's seed that's produce life, you know. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Wrong seeds produce &gt;&gt; alive. &gt;&gt; Wrong seek to produce angry church members, &gt;&gt; heady, high-minded, arrogant, looking for fight. &gt;&gt; Really untrue. Looking for a nice K in spirit. &gt;&gt; Looking for wrestler. Instead of winning souls, they're looking to fight brethren &gt;&gt; who not looking so fightish, &gt;&gt; looking humble, looking like you. All right. &gt;&gt; So when that word hit Mary, Mary went straight, you know, I'm going to have a baby. Hear your difference. Now this is seed hit Mary, right? &gt;&gt; Before she felt anything because the word was already set there. &gt;&gt; She didn't have to go through the prayer line a second time. &gt;&gt; She believed it. She didn't have any sign of life. She never had no sign of pregnancy. She felt nothing. &gt;&gt; That is I like this one here. Punch this for the feelers inside of here. We're not talking about here tonight have feelings inside tonight. But about the whole church then only want to feel something because she heard a word. She took it. &gt;&gt; Had to feel nothing. &gt;&gt; Feeling God with me now. I want you feel nothing. God not with me. See that can't work. &gt;&gt; Devil will play you like a fiddle. &gt;&gt; Devil will play your feeling like a fiddle. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you could take God at his word, devil have nothing to play. You know, &gt;&gt; all you devil, God said so. God said so. It is written. It is written. It is also written. God said so. Devil can't stop you. Then he know if you're going or coming. He know if you're sick or you're not sick. He know if you're up or down. You're depressed. You're frustrated. The devil doesn't know because all your confession is what God have said. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; She felt nothing. Listen to this now. When you realize &gt;&gt; that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing, &gt;&gt; there is nothing in the world is going to defeat you in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are absolutely undefeable. &gt;&gt; Not you, but God in you. &gt;&gt; Oh people, God bless you. Hear me. &gt;&gt; But say, hear me. &gt;&gt; I can't believe nothing but God's word. &gt;&gt; I want it to be my life. &gt;&gt; Everything that I am, I want you to do the same. Let your walks, your talks, your moves, everything to be in the word of God. Let the mind of Christ come into you and that will pregnant you &gt;&gt; with the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you let the mind of the denomination come in, you'll be denominationally pregnantated. &gt;&gt; So you see what happened to the groups now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If they're not preaching the word, &gt;&gt; they get their own baby &gt;&gt; from the pastor. &gt;&gt; You know who the father that child is? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you let the mind of Christ come into you, he can't deny his own word. &gt;&gt; This is what I want to get to now. Christ is now taking himself a bride &gt;&gt; to be pregnantated with his own seed word &gt;&gt; in her womb, &gt;&gt; the spirit womb in her mind. &gt;&gt; That won't mix with any national trash with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Could you take some more? Yes, &gt;&gt; God knowing in this last day &gt;&gt; there will come a intellectual giants &gt;&gt; that will come everything intellectual all kind of enemy with reasoning powers to try to prove to the church that the days of miracle is passed &gt;&gt; God packed in the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; with what speaking in tongues interpretation &gt;&gt; prophecies all kind of things that may seem hard in training but brother on the battlefront everyone One of them think got to be used. &gt;&gt; Who said that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every one of them got to be used &gt;&gt; God equips his soldiers on what take it takes what to use. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You stay there till God equips you with the baptism of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Then everything you got need of in this world or the world to come lives right in you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The all- wise God knowing how to equip his army. He equipped it with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew, here we go. When people would reason &gt;&gt; would go to reading this word when it come out here, &gt;&gt; what would happen? So Lucifer, old Lucy, &gt;&gt; he was waiting for it to come into book form &gt;&gt; and print form &gt;&gt; where people could study it &gt;&gt; and reason with it. &gt;&gt; And today we find people saying, "Where where's the God of history? Where is the God across the Red Sea? Where's the God that heal the sick?" And they try to go back. What good does it do to give your Canary bird vitamins and make him strong winds and keep him in a cage? You are penned up in some little thing down there. It's a lie. Christ is the same yesterday and forever. God know. Here we go. It will take the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; to prove his latter day signs. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now you see, here we go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Almost done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No, I shouldn't say that on page 74 14 pages. We were supposed to get through quickly tonight, but this is now you see. Here we go. That's the seed word cannot grow in the atmosphere of knowledge. &gt;&gt; So all them who sitting down with the itching ears looking for more teachers to come to hit them a four hours and a five hours and a six hour sermon &gt;&gt; of information. The word can't grow &gt;&gt; in the atmosphere of &gt;&gt; knowledge. Faith only grows in one vitamin. Faith only grows in one vitamin. That's the word. The only thing that faith can grow in is the word. And the only way it can grow is because it believes the word. It has to take all the word and believe it. Faith vitamin is spelled in little four-letter word L I F E. Life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Vitamin L. &gt;&gt; Life. &gt;&gt; Wisdom has vitamin P. &gt;&gt; R pleasure and reason. That's wisdom. pleasure and reason. &gt;&gt; But faith only have one thing, life. &gt;&gt; Thy word is life. &gt;&gt; Thy word is truth. &gt;&gt; So the seed word of life can't grow in the kind of atmosphere of wisdom. &gt;&gt; Almost. Yeah. Oh god, skip down. The life that come out of the original seed. &gt;&gt; Oh god. Here we go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come through different processes &gt;&gt; and turn back to its original condition. &gt;&gt; So Luther, Wesley, Pentecost was just part of the processes. But when it come to the top, Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, top, it come back to the original, alpha and omega. &gt;&gt; Paul and brother Brandham and then the bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. So God set up Paul as the original messenger. Set up brother Brham as the end time messenger and set the bride behind that. With Paul had the early church, the bride and with brother Brandham have the last day church the bride. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. which will be original word which will be original seed. That is why the prophecy say what the tape say because it's not me saying it. It's he that is saying it. Oh give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; The secret is what the word is in the bride. How did the word get inside of you? Because it's promise after promise after promise. What did Peter said? By these promises you become a partaker of his divine nature. All right let's go. The life that was in the stalk went one went to make another. Justification made a way for sanctification. Sanctification made a way for the bapt Holy Ghost. And the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come down in perfection. When they organized the life move right out of it, &gt;&gt; the life is traveling on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So churches have testimonies. People have testimonies of the life of what God did for them and what God for them years ago and what not. But if you're organized, life move on. &gt;&gt; And all you have is a history &gt;&gt; of a testimony. &gt;&gt; Oh my. The life leaves the stalk to make the tassel. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Leaves from the tassel. It makes the husk. From the husk, it goes into the original grain. Notice never again to be useful to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the processes dries up. &gt;&gt; And the seed stands original. &gt;&gt; What's that seed? Original seed. &gt;&gt; What's that seed? The spoken word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It comes back to that &gt;&gt; the original seed went down through processes seven church ages come back up again &gt;&gt; as original seed &gt;&gt; to be you &gt;&gt; the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we can't be less than the original. &gt;&gt; We cannot be less than the word manifested. &gt;&gt; That is our gene, &gt;&gt; our gym. That's our seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice the seed is coming up. &gt;&gt; The life is coming up. It is not going back. and hear the bum. And when the seed word begins to grow, music come, please. When the seed word begins to grow, the husk put it from itself. &gt;&gt; That's rejection right there. &gt;&gt; The husk in the message that can't take you no more. &gt;&gt; The life leave all the others &gt;&gt; to follow it. &gt;&gt; That's the true believers. &gt;&gt; What the true? They follow the life &gt;&gt; wherever the life goes. What happened to the church once carrier is alive? The spirit passed through. &gt;&gt; No more useful to God. &gt;&gt; The spirit passed through her. It's true. But she will not be air with the vindicated seed word. &gt;&gt; She will not be in the rapture. She'll be a church member come up in the second resurrection. Ah, praise God. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Like you woman claiming you got the Holy Ghost out here wearing shorts and things. You see, he's not a filthy spirit. He's a Holy Spirit. And when you become subject to that spirit, it throws your whole being subject to that spirit. I'm about to close. Skipping here. And that spirit, &gt;&gt; are you ready? &gt;&gt; Is nothing in the world but the seed word made manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this kingdom of God, &gt;&gt; the spirit is the seed word in you &gt;&gt; made manifest, &gt;&gt; quickened alive or made alive. &gt;&gt; Oh my. This body is subject to the spirit. Have not yet entered into the word form. &gt;&gt; We are still in flesh form &gt;&gt; but subject to the word. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to close. He that heareth you heareth me. He that despiseth you despiseth me. &gt;&gt; He that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. That proves he speaks his message through his servants. Now the power of the believing church. Christ has all power in heaven. Do you believe that? What if he's in you? Has Christ got all power? He is the seedword in his body. He in us become the seedword in us. &gt;&gt; Now watch the law of reproduction. Everything after its kind. &gt;&gt; And then he said these words here. Now the seed of Christ must m u s t must come through his body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not through a denomination but through a bornagain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seed of the word. We coming back to this. Amen. &gt;&gt; Seed is through the body. &gt;&gt; How does my seed come? Through the body. How does apple seed seed come? Through the body. &gt;&gt; And the church is the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Now watch. He said now watch this. Now watch the seed church here. Now he's given example with the true sperm. The Enoch unoch remember God never committed his preaching to an angel. He said God came down below angels and committed to man. Although an angel directed Philillip to him, but the germ of life had to come from the body. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; Philillip. &gt;&gt; Brother, are we on the line now? &gt;&gt; Where did the germ come from? Through the angel. &gt;&gt; No, the angel show him where to go. An angel is a messenger. Here is a son. Philip had the germ, the message, the word. &gt;&gt; You see what he bring? &gt;&gt; This is the message here. Now, &gt;&gt; this is what we have to get to. Philip had the message, &gt;&gt; the word, &gt;&gt; the germ. That is how a child can be born. &gt;&gt; Philip laid his hands upon him. Philip baptized him in Jesus Christ and there come the spirit of God. Now the gym had to come from the body. What body? Christ's body &gt;&gt; and Philip was a member of that body. &gt;&gt; And then he went on about Cornelius while Peter speak these word and I'll close with this last quote here. Two more. All done. &gt;&gt; What is the transformation? How do we get it? What does the transformation? God does it by the spirit of his word. &gt;&gt; He plants his seed &gt;&gt; and throws his spirit on it &gt;&gt; and it brings forth the product. &gt;&gt; His holy spirit transform the seed word to be vindicated of its kind. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit transformed the seeds that's on the inside of it. No matter what kind of seed it is, it will transform it. &gt;&gt; If it's evil, it will bring forth evil. If it's hypocrite, it bring forth hypocrite. If it's genuine word of God, it will bring forth genuine sons of God. And this is the final quote. &gt;&gt; We are waiting for that something that's going to take the faith. &gt;&gt; And restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. &gt;&gt; He said, I'll restore again in last days. It will be restored. God shall send the Holy Ghost in such a way upon planted word &gt;&gt; and that will restore. &gt;&gt; The word of God is a seed that a soul went for. So let's all stand and praise God. Father God, we thank you tonight. We praise you tonight. We thank you for your spirit. We thank you for your presence and power. Have the preeminences, Lord. Have the oversight. And may your people give it revelation inspiration knowing that the spoken word is original seed and you have sent forth your spirit to throw that rain that water upon that seed to make it manifest. I commit them into your hands in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. God bless you. Thanks again for being here. [Music] [Applause] Blessed be the name of the Lord. I love the Lord tonight.
