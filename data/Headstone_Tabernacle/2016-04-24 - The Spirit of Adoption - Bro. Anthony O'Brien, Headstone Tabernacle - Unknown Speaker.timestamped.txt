[24:00] they are the sons of God Amen for ye
[24:03] have not received the spirit of bondage
[24:06] again to fear but ye have received the
[24:10] spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA
[24:14] father the spirit itself beareth witness
[24:18] with our spirit that we are the children
[24:21] of God may God a blessing through his

[24:52] create a space where we could get in oh
[24:53] Father and see your your your glory Lord
[24:57] father to see what you want from us Lord
[24:59] father to see how we're Measuring Up
[25:01] with the gospel Lord father at this 11th
[25:04] Hour Lord where the Earth is falling
[25:06] apart Lord we want to be anchored in you
[25:09] tonight this morning rather we pray your
[25:12] Holy Spirit be with us in a special way
[25:14] bless us Lord bless the word as said go
[25:16] forth take me out of the way Lord and
[25:18] use me for your honor For Your Glory
[25:20] this morning Lord if I could be a help
[25:22] to somebody this morning then let your
[25:24] will be done Lord father we pray a
[25:27] special pray now for your your servant
[25:29] brother ID our pastor Lord and he's
[25:31] traveling on the fields Lord we pray
[25:33] keep him safe Lord he and the elders
[25:35] that are with him Lord father we pray
[25:37] keep them safe also Lord for we live in
[25:39] perilous times Lord but your angel is
[25:41] able to keep us Lord hallelujah with us
[25:43] soever we go as father Lord so we pray
[25:47] encamp around them today Father and and
[25:49] bless them as they travel through
[25:50] Kentucky Lord and through the services
[25:51] day we pray you bless the services there
[25:53] also Lord and father we pray you bless
[25:55] us once more now this morning as we
[25:57] enter your your word Lord grant it Lord
[25:59] in Jesus name we pray and ask it amen
[26:02] and amen you may have your seats this
[26:08] morning amen praise
[26:11] God
[26:23] hallelujah you love the Lord this
[26:26] morning amen amen amen praise God you
[26:29] know when we come in the house of God we
[26:31] ought to have a praise on our lips
[26:33] Hallelujah and a song in our heart
[26:36] Hallelujah because it was God that
[26:37] brought us out and it's God that
[26:39] gathered us here this morning amen amen
[26:42] amen the world says we're crazy this
[26:44] morning they said we're crazy for
[26:46] shouting they we're crazy for worshiping
[26:48] we're crazy for praising God but I don't
[26:51] mind being crazy this morning just let
[26:54] me be crazy for my Jesus amen amen let
[26:57] me act heretical this morning let me act
[27:00] hysterical this morning but I don't mind
[27:02] getting crazy for Jesus this morning is
[27:05] anybody feel that way this morning amen
[27:08] amen and amen so I have a title I have a
[27:11] title this morning which is my uh my
[27:12] title is coming from Romans 8 the spirit
[27:15] of adoption and my inspiration is the
[27:18] spirit itself beareth
[27:21] witness amen and amen isn't that right
[27:25] hallelujah hallelujah so Romans 8 is a
[27:28] very spiritual scripture it speaks about
[27:30] the spirit it speaks about the influence
[27:33] of the spirit it speaks about what the
[27:35] spirit is supposed to manifest which is
[27:38] Sons and Daughters of God in the last
[27:40] days we are promised to see God again in
[27:44] human form isn't that right God once
[27:48] again putting on skin God once again
[27:51] hiding behind human veils is that right
[27:55] God once again is going to pick up 16
[27:58] elements just like he did in Jesus just
[28:01] like he did in the prophet God once
[28:04] again wants to put on your skin he wants
[28:07] to put on my skin he wants to put on
[28:10] your shoes he wants to wear my tie he
[28:13] wants to speak through your lips oh H he
[28:16] has no hands but your hands this morning
[28:19] and this spirit is useless unless it has
[28:22] a body to use oh can somebody say Amen
[28:27] oh if you could use anything Lord come
[28:30] on and use me take my hands take my feet
[28:34] touch my hearts speak through me this
[28:37] morning oh hallelujah hallelujah
[28:42] hallelujah Heen amen hallelujah and when
[28:46] you're in the spirit God could use you
[28:50] when you're in the spirit God could
[28:52] speak to you when you're in the natural
[28:55] you are subject to the things of the
[28:57] natural
[28:58] you're subject to the outer court if the
[29:00] sun shine you're happy and if the rain
[29:02] fall you're D and out but not those that
[29:05] walk by the spirit those that walk after
[29:08] the flesh are subject to the things of
[29:10] the flesh but those that walk after the
[29:13] spirit they don't care about the flesh
[29:16] to them flesh is flesh but spirit is
[29:19] Spirit oh is not right Marvel that I say

[43:18] amen isn't that right Bible says we're
[43:21] born in sin shap in iniquity comeing the
[43:24] world speaking lies but the law of
[43:26] Christ Jesus is here this morning to set
[43:29] us free from the law of sin and death
[43:33] isn't that right and in the previous
[43:35] scripture of Romans Romans chapter 7
[43:37] some of yall know it that Paul speaks of
[43:39] the struggle that he faces with himself
[43:42] isn't that right Romans 7:2 21 he says I
[43:46] find then a law that when I would do
[43:49] good evil is present with me for I
[43:52] Delight in the law of God after the
[43:54] inward man we light in the law of God we
[43:57] love to hear his word isn't that right
[44:00] but here's Paul an apostle here's he
[44:02] speaking here 23 says but I see another
[44:05] law in my members Waring against the law
[44:09] of my mind Waring against the law that I
[44:13] know to do right isn't that right and
[44:15] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[44:17] sin which is in my members so there's a
[44:21] war going on this morning young people
[44:23] you in a battle sign your shes up polish
[44:27] your Spears and beat your plow sheds
[44:30] into swords we are under
[44:36] attack Hallelujah man the barricades
[44:39] every man to his post we are under
[44:41] attack this morning the enemy is coming
[44:43] like a flood but the spirit of God is
[44:46] here the spirit of God the Lord himself
[44:50] has descended with a shout to make a way
[44:53] for the elect sake hallelujah praise God
[44:58] those days shall be shortened God's
[45:00] going to have one quick message short
[45:02] quick message to shake the whole nation
[45:05] and then we're out of
[45:07] here oh hallelujah
[45:13] hallelujah
[45:15] amen a
[45:17] spirit a
[45:18] nature in you fighting against the law
[45:22] of God that's what's going on that's why
[45:26] it's so hard to lift your hand sometimes
[45:28] that's why it's so hard to praise God
[45:29] sometimes especially when the emotions
[45:31] kick in especially when your mind begins
[45:35] to over
[45:36] click clicking so fast till it can't
[45:39] even function anymore just Frozen have
[45:42] to control all the lead sometimes I
[45:44] don't know if you understand what I'm
[45:45] talking about
[45:47] but times you have to just shut down and
[45:50] get away with God or you'll be
[45:53] overcome even the prophet himself and
[45:56] brother ISAC spoke about it a couple of
[45:58] times he said he himself when he was
[46:01] tested with his wife and he was tested
[46:03] with his child he himself his mind broke
[46:06] down to the point that he picked the gun
[46:08] up and pointed it to his head he pulled
[46:11] the trigger it wouldn't go off God would
[46:15] not allow it and sometimes you would do
[46:17] wrong and it wouldn't go off because God
[46:21] wouldn't allow it because there's
[46:22] something inside of you that just won't
[46:25] let go oh and God will not let you go
[46:30] Mercy said no oh
[46:33] hallelujah oh you are too precious Jesus
[46:37] left his home in glory and came down the
[46:39] Earth the creator of the universe bowed
[46:43] himself low enough to become a vagrant
[46:46] he was sleeping on the streets he had no
[46:48] house to dwell in but it gave him the
[46:51] ability watch to meet the needs of every
[46:54] person that he came into contact with
[46:57] that is how God needed humility he
[47:00] needed to become so low till he could
[47:03] touch the lowest person if he was too
[47:05] high he could only touch the high and
[47:08] mighty but God forsook everything to
[47:11] come and be with you how happy we ought
[47:14] to be this morning we ought to be
[47:17] screaming we ought to be jumping just to
[47:20] know
[47:23] him oh do you know my savior do you know
[47:28] my redeemer oh he's the humble one he's
[47:31] the lonely
[47:35] one oh
[47:38] [Applause]
[47:43] my was God veiled in
[47:48] Simplicity he hides himself in
[47:50] Simplicity and reveals himself in the
[47:53] same isn't that right Hallelujah and
[47:57] science know how to how to build the
[48:00] fastest plane they have self-driven cars
[48:04] they have technology and science and
[48:06] knowledge and so forth hallu but they
[48:08] don't know the Mystery of Life in a
[48:11] single blade of grass they miss that and
[48:15] yet God is hidden in that simple thing
[48:19] they cannot make it grow they cannot
[48:21] force it to grow and say now it's time
[48:23] to grow you have to grow no there's a
[48:26] law in the life of that plate of grass
[48:29] he knows that when his time is come he
[48:32] knows that when winter is over that when
[48:35] the dry seasons are over it's his time
[48:38] to shine and when is your hour come your
[48:42] hour come H and when it's your time to
[48:45] shine you will shine forth with the
[48:48] Praises of his glory not the works of
[48:51] any man lest any man should boast it is
[48:54] not by The Works of man man but it is by
[48:56] the grace of God that you made it in
[48:59] this service this morning because
[49:01] there's a law of life in Christ
[49:09] Jesus isn't that right Hallelujah
[49:13] there's a law of life in you there's a
[49:15] seed in you that God had
[49:18] predestinated to be there before the
[49:21] foundation of the world if it were not
[49:23] there you couldn't hear this message
[49:25] this morning with faith you couldn't
[49:27] respond to it you'd be cut off from it
[49:30] because you couldn't come to any kind of
[49:32] fullness or realization of truth but
[49:34] that seed inside of you is really what
[49:37] connects to the gospel is what connects
[49:40] to the word when preach and when we
[49:42] speak your name something inside of you
[49:44] has to respond because it is your name
[49:47] being spoken and only you could respond
[49:50] to your name when it is spoken oh
[49:54] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[49:56] hallelujah isn't that right it's a
[49:59] natural reaction if you hear your name
[50:02] even if somebody have a name like your
[50:03] name and they call that person you can't
[50:06] help but look around just to make sure
[50:10] that it's not you they calling well
[50:12] that's how your spiritual name is a
[50:15] response when God's word is preached

[50:20] Ghost when you hear something about
[50:23] Deliverance when you hear something
[50:25] about about the spirit of adoption you
[50:28] can't help but look across just make
[50:32] sure that it's you they calling

[51:13] something could take place a little
[51:15] spark of faith when Jesus heard those
[51:18] words all the time it was a natural
[51:20] conversation but when she said those
[51:23] words something triggered inside Jesus's

[56:42] God Psalms 123 1 144 and this came to me
[56:46] by the will of the Lord is a plea for
[56:49] the mercy of God through the psalm David
[56:53] isn't that right and through this Psalm
[56:56] David are asking for God's mercy upon
[56:58] the
[56:59] people his prophecy every Psalm is
[57:03] prophecy isn't that right going out just
[57:05] like he
[57:06] prophesied the death of Christ saying
[57:09] why God why God why is that forsaken me
[57:11] it was hidden written in Mystery in a
[57:13] Psalm but when Jesus lay on the cross
[57:16] there was the Fulfillment of that Psalm
[57:18] isn't that right I will not see that
[57:20] Holy One to see corruption when he was
[57:22] Rose three days from the dead that pm
[57:24] came to life and there are certain words
[57:27] concerning us this morning that must
[57:29] come to life shortly thereafter the holy
[57:33] spirit is here this morning to make sure
[57:36] that that happens am isn't that right if

[58:06] atmosphere okay Psalm
[58:09] 123 it says a plea for Mercy isn't that
[58:12] right he's asking for God's mercy why
[58:16] because a spirit has fallen upon the
[58:19] people hallelujah isn't that right let's
[58:22] read it again Psalms 123 let me see if I
[58:25] can find it quick read it
[58:28] again I know it's not a familiar Psalm
[58:30] so we'll refresh it to your memory once
[58:34] more says behold as the eyes of the
[58:37] servants look unto the hands of their
[58:40] masters try and picture that scene the
[58:43] eyes of a servant looking unto her
[58:45] master for bread for meat for a meal for
[58:49] help isn't that right he said now as the
[58:52] eyes of a maiden look into the hand of
[58:55] her mistress so our eyes wait upon the
[58:58] Lord Our God until that he have mercy
[59:01] upon us have mercy upon us oh Lord have
[59:06] mercy upon us for we are exceedingly
[59:09] filled with

[59:14] running
[59:15] over hallu isn't that right exceedingly
[59:18] filled with contempt hallelujah our soul
[59:21] is exceedingly filled with the scorning
[59:23] of those that are at ease
[59:25] ease and
[59:28] Zion and because they're so secure in
[59:30] themselves they look down on others
[59:33] that's right because they're so secure
[59:35] in the church and in their group and in
[59:38] the
[59:39] organization hallelujah hallelujah they
[59:41] feel that they have the
[59:43] self-righteousness to be able to look
[59:44] down on others and they fail to see the
[59:47] approach to God they fail to see how
[59:50] they ought to be approaching God in this
[59:52] hour and season with humility
[59:55] and with reverence and with respect and
[59:58] with Godly
[59:59] fear that is almost absent in this
[1:00:02] loudan age that we are living
[1:00:05] in they are blind wretched miserable

[1:00:20] have one foot in
[1:00:22] hell and the next foot in a banana peel
[1:00:25] there's almost no hope for
[1:00:29] them it's a sad situation I don't mean
[1:00:33] to make jokes
[1:00:34] but it's a terrible
[1:00:37] situation to be in that
[1:00:40] atmosphere because it's a deception and
[1:00:42] the devil actually deceived people mind
[1:00:45] into thinking that they're doing all
[1:00:47] right just keep going the way you're
[1:00:49] going just keep going to church and

[1:00:53] they're passing all all the stop lights
[1:00:56] and all that how God tried to keep them

[1:05:25] tree come around and he meet the same
[1:05:27] Rock come around and he meet the same
[1:05:30] Stone same piece of dirt that he passed
[1:05:33] how much ever minutes ago till he
[1:05:35] realized that he was
[1:05:37] lost and he needed a guide he realized
[1:05:41] that he couldn't do it on his own am and
[1:05:44] the funny part is he was a trained guide
[1:05:47] he was a trained professional said he
[1:05:49] know he could feel the side of the tree
[1:05:52] and whichever part the Moss was growing
[1:05:54] I think is the North side or whatever he
[1:05:56] knew all these things and yet he got
[1:05:59] lost God permitted that to show him that
[1:06:03] there's no higher than
[1:06:05] God there's no one above God straight is
[1:06:09] a gate and narrow is the way few there
[1:06:13] be that find it woo it take a guide to
[1:06:16] show you that gate a Straight Gate is a
[1:06:19] very small gate you'll miss it if you
[1:06:22] wasn't looking so many people speeding
[1:06:24] down the highway of life it's like a six
[1:06:27] Lane seven Lane highway to change lanes
[1:06:29] is a problem because there's so much
[1:06:31] people going in the same direction
[1:06:33] Bumper to Bumper heading to hell it take
[1:06:36] God to get you out of
[1:06:39] that traffic of
[1:06:43] Madness take God to weave you out of
[1:06:47] that
[1:06:48] Pitfall that rat race that is the world
[1:06:51] today take God to take you over to the s
[1:06:54] somewhere I show you a narrow road
[1:06:58] highways leading to hell highways
[1:07:00] leading to satanic destruction and all
[1:07:04] different types of things isn't that
[1:07:06] right Mayhem chaos confusion but there's
[1:07:09] a narrow way this
[1:07:11] morning and if it wasn't for Jesus who
[1:07:14] had not been on our side we would have
[1:07:16] been swallowed whole but the Lord had
[1:07:19] been with us the angel of the Lord
[1:07:22] encamp it round up about them that fear
[1:07:25] them them that fear Him and deliver them
[1:07:30] oh taste and see that the Lord is good
[1:07:34] blessed is a man that trusteth in him
[1:07:37] where is your trust this morning David
[1:07:40] said I can't put my trust in the legs of
[1:07:42] a man I can't put my trust in horses my
[1:07:46] trust is in the Lord my God he is my
[1:07:49] shield he is my buckler he is my
[1:07:52] exceeding and great reward
[1:07:54] W oh
[1:07:57] [Applause]
[1:08:06] Hallelujah there's a way out this
[1:08:08] morning it's only one
[1:08:11] way few there be that find it but it is
[1:08:14] Jesus he is the way out there's only one
[1:08:18] provided way and that's God's provided
[1:08:21] way Hallelujah and that's true Jesus
[1:08:24] Christ his Spirit has to Bear witness
[1:08:27] with your spirit that you are the Son of
[1:08:30] God that you are a daughter of God that
[1:08:33] you are who you say you are is not good
[1:08:35] enough just to come to church and to
[1:08:37] play Christian and go home the devil
[1:08:40] watching that life because a bunch of
[1:08:43] other people said they were doing that
[1:08:45] too and they in hell right now so what's
[1:08:48] difference between you and them you've
[1:08:50] got to have a token to prove
[1:08:52] it
[1:08:54] plenty people went to church lots of
[1:08:56] people went to church had fine churches
[1:09:02] nice devil not looking at that devil
[1:09:05] looking at her life once he see that
[1:09:07] life thundering out in sweetness and
[1:09:09] humility thundering out in this age
[1:09:12] that's what he's got a problem with he
[1:09:14] got no problem with you coming to church
[1:09:16] show people come to church people pay
[1:09:18] their tithes people do nice things
[1:09:20] hallelujah hallelujah but that's not the
[1:09:22] way H that's just only part of it that's
[1:09:24] just only the things that make it up H
[1:09:27] but the nucleus of the thing is Christ
[1:09:30] the nucleus of what we are going after
[1:09:32] is
[1:09:37] Jesus that's the thing that's the center
[1:09:40] of it
[1:09:41] all Jesus and he Remains the Same
[1:09:45] throughout all the ages Hallelujah times
[1:09:47] have changed seasons have changed
[1:09:49] technology has rapidly become better and
[1:09:51] better it's such a wonderful example
[1:09:53] existance now people just press their
[1:09:55] phone and get what they want go into the
[1:09:58] bank and take out something if they want
[1:10:00] to and everything just works you don't
[1:10:02] know how you just living and technology
[1:10:05] is making it so easy now isn't that
[1:10:09] right and and yet in all of this rapid
[1:10:12] change of time God Remains the
[1:10:15] Same his word Remains the Same his
[1:10:19] promises remain the same and his laws
[1:10:22] remain the same he said and if you abide
[1:10:25] in me and my words abide in you ask what
[1:10:28] you will and it shall be done unto you
[1:10:32] you shall find me when you seek me with
[1:10:35] all of your heart and turn away the
[1:10:38] distractions and turn away what people
[1:10:40] say and what people do forget about it
[1:10:43] run into the Ark of
[1:10:46] Safety while there is still
[1:10:52] time something
[1:10:55] else nice people who went to church but
[1:10:59] look at Israel Israel was called out two
[1:11:01] and a half million people called out
[1:11:02] wonderful dancing and shouting praising
[1:11:05] God and little did they know that later
[1:11:08] down the road they'd all die because
[1:11:11] they failed to meet God's
[1:11:13] requirement they failed to come God's
[1:11:15] way they failed to take the land that
[1:11:17] God had sworn unto their fathers that
[1:11:20] they would possess they failed to see it
[1:11:22] and God judged them right there
[1:11:23] eternally separated from God cut off
[1:11:27] isn't that right even the Pharisees and
[1:11:29] the Sadducees telling Jesus that our
[1:11:32] fathers eat Mana in the wilderness he
[1:11:34] said but there are everyone dead
[1:11:36] Hallelujah God don't care how much Mana
[1:11:38] you eat God want to see how much word
[1:11:40] you live go don't care how much Mana you
[1:11:43] eat they ate angel food I've never
[1:11:46] tasted angel food and yet they all
[1:11:49] perish for the lack of faith that's
[1:11:52] right isn't that right
[1:11:54] don't be in that condition friends we
[1:11:56] have a chance all these things happen
[1:11:58] Paul said for all restruction and Repro
[1:12:00] that we could learn from it that we
[1:12:02] could grow from it that we could not do
[1:12:04] as they did but that we could learn from
[1:12:06] those experiences and that we could
[1:12:08] strong in the knowledge of God and Chase
[1:12:11] the thing that we were born to go after
[1:12:13] isn't that right
[1:12:17] okay
[1:12:19] Hallelujah Psalms 123 the Amplified says
[1:12:21] be gracious to us oh Lord be gracious
[1:12:23] and favorable towards us for we are
[1:12:26] greatly filled with contempt our soul is
[1:12:28] greatly filled with the scuffing of
[1:12:30] those who are at ease and with the
[1:12:31] contempt of The Proud who disregard
[1:12:34] God's law it's an extension of
[1:12:36] translation isn't that right my and the
[1:12:39] word contempt means willful Disobedience
[1:12:42] or open disrespect that's what contempt
[1:12:45] means amen isn't that right Hallelujah
[1:12:48] and that word of the Lord shows the
[1:12:50] attitude of the people today isn't that
[1:12:52] right a willful disobedience
[1:12:54] are open disrespect to God's law isn't
[1:12:56] that right come to church how they want
[1:12:59] come to church when they want do what
[1:13:01] they want no prayer no sanctification no
[1:13:05] dedication no hungering for God a
[1:13:08] thirsting to come to the to the
[1:13:10] realization of the truth to to want to
[1:13:12] be a
[1:13:13] manifestation to want to see God live in
[1:13:16] their lives and to see God do something
[1:13:18] real in your heart for you to be a real
[1:13:21] Christian to do the things that you were
[1:13:23] supposed to do isn't that right to
[1:13:26] present yourself a Living Sacrifice unto
[1:13:28] God holy and acceptable that is your
[1:13:31] reasonable service that's ABCs that's
[1:13:34] Basics you're supposed to do that and
[1:13:37] yet there's a a willful Disobedience
[1:13:40] today isn't that right my God see 2 and
[1:13:44] a half million people were disobedient
[1:13:46] to God's law and we're judged for it
[1:13:48] isn't that right okay uh let me read
[1:13:51] something here from the prophet how can
[1:13:53] I overcome from paragraph 41 he says I
[1:13:56] was crossing an Old Log the other day
[1:13:59] down a wash or what is called a hollow
[1:14:02] okay and I jumped up on this log on the
[1:14:05] outside it looked good it looked like a
[1:14:07] big old beach log so he's in the woods I
[1:14:10] guess and he he jumps on top of this log
[1:14:12] I guess he's testing the strength of it
[1:14:13] or the weight of it and he said it look
[1:14:15] good it looked like a big old beach log
[1:14:17] he said but when I jumped up on it oh a
[1:14:20] great chunk of it fell off he said it
[1:14:23] was real rotten and dty I said that's
[1:14:27] the way the Christians are
[1:14:28] becoming he said they've been dead in
[1:14:31] sin and trespass so long till become
[1:14:35] Dy they can they can hold no weight at
[1:14:38] all they don't know what the overcoming
[1:14:41] means he said I begin to think of this
[1:14:43] text then see overcome what does it mean
[1:14:47] overcome means to keep life in you he
[1:14:51] said when when life went out
[1:14:53] that's what brought the log to that
[1:14:55] condition see and it made it worse than
[1:14:58] ever when it laid in the branch where
[1:15:00] the water was he's saying something here
[1:15:03] now listen close he says and then there
[1:15:06] you take a Christian that's supposed to
[1:15:08] be a Christian but he said let the life
[1:15:10] of God go from him and the experience
[1:15:14] the joy of serving Christ and live and
[1:15:16] and living in a church where where such
[1:15:19] is going on he says he rottens twice as
[1:15:22] quick
[1:15:23] living right under right in that
[1:15:25] condition isn't that right people com to
[1:15:28] church and they're dying people come in
[1:15:30] church and doing the same things over
[1:15:31] and over and they're slowly dying in the
[1:15:34] Pew isn't that right when you're
[1:15:36] supposed to be applying the word but the
[1:15:37] life of God is gone out of you there's
[1:15:39] no testimony anymore there's no
[1:15:41] vibration anymore there's no cry to get
[1:15:43] in the spirit a passion to know the word
[1:15:46] a fervent desire to please God all of
[1:15:48] that is is almost void and absent in the
[1:15:52] life of the so-called Christian and then
[1:15:54] it begin to wither and rotten and cave
[1:15:57] in on itself that's a condition he say
[1:16:00] that Christians are coming into today
[1:16:02] this is the prophet here he said so if
[1:16:06] we are trying to follow the message of
[1:16:08] the hour or at least part of this
[1:16:10] message he said we should live
[1:16:12] constantly in the Life of Christ see cuz
[1:16:16] if you don't you lay around and you know
[1:16:19] that these things that you're supposed
[1:16:21] to do and you don't do it the the Bible
[1:16:23] say he that knoweth to do good and doeth
[1:16:25] it not to him it
[1:16:28] sin then you become Doty rotten when
[1:16:31] you're separated from the life of God
[1:16:34] here's a prophet encouraging you he says
[1:16:36] so strive with all that is in you to
[1:16:40] stay in the Life of Christ that you be
[1:16:43] fruit bearing he said back then the
[1:16:46] early ages a Christian could uh for his
[1:16:49] profession of in a church or belonging
[1:16:50] to Christ he said he could be beheaded
[1:16:52] for it he could be killed he could be
[1:16:54] put out of his misery and go to meet God
[1:16:57] quickly but now he said the enemy has
[1:16:59] come in the game has change he said the
[1:17:02] enemy has come in the name of the church
[1:17:04] and it's so deceiving this is the great
[1:17:07] age of deception he said when when
[1:17:10] Christ said that the two Spirits would
[1:17:12] be so close in the last days till it
[1:17:15] would deceive the very elect if it was
[1:17:18] possible see see see the prophet says
[1:17:20] see three times he said remember Christ
[1:17:23] spoke of an elected people for the last
[1:17:25] day that's you and I an elected people
[1:17:28] for the last day he said see it would
[1:17:31] deceive the very elected if it were
[1:17:34] possible so close he said that people
[1:17:37] could live uh so live people can live a
[1:17:39] clean holy life not be sinful adulterers
[1:17:43] and Drinkers and liars and gamblers they
[1:17:45] can live above that and still not with
[1:17:48] it that's right that's
[1:17:50] right he said and this is the age I love
[1:17:53] this this this phrase here the prophet
[1:17:55] says he said this is the age the age of
[1:17:59] Life personal life of Christ where the
[1:18:03] chemical of his body what was in him
[1:18:06] first under justification the water
[1:18:08] baptism second under the new birth of
[1:18:10] Wesley uh sanctification which cleanses
[1:18:13] and thirdly under the baptism of the
[1:18:15] Holy Spirit putting that Sanctified
[1:18:18] vessel into service see he said the word
[1:18:21] sanctify means it's a compound Greek
[1:18:24] word which means cleaned and set aside
[1:18:27] for service and the Holy Spirit puts it
[1:18:30] in
[1:18:31] service oh Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:18:35] so we don't just want to be set aside
[1:18:37] for service but we want to be put in
[1:18:40] service and it takes a holy spirit to do
[1:18:43] that it takes a spirit of God to do that
[1:18:45] an anointing to come upon you to live
[1:18:48] this life of Christ to act the Life of
[1:18:51] Christ to do the works of Christ it
[1:18:53] takes another Spirit to do that but you
[1:18:55] have to be emptied out and to let God
[1:18:58] come in so that he could perform his
[1:19:01] Works in you isn't that right oh
[1:19:03] wonderful can we give the Lord a praise
[1:19:05] [Applause]
[1:19:13] offering oh Hallelujah they love the
[1:19:15] Lord this morning amen I don't want to
[1:19:18] keep too long but just a few more
[1:19:19] minutes and I'll close out he said so
[1:19:21] with promise the Holy Spirit
[1:19:23] not the spirit of contempt but the
[1:19:25] spirit of sin the uh not the spirit of
[1:19:28] sin sorry not the spirit of contemp not
[1:19:31] the spirit of sin but the spirit of
[1:19:33] adoption see isn't that right now we
[1:19:36] know what adoption is isn't that right
[1:19:37] it's the placing of sons into the family
[1:19:40] of God by adoption isn't that right
[1:19:44] hallelujah hallelujah and what we are
[1:19:46] speaking of this morning is the spirit
[1:19:48] of
[1:19:49] adoption now the word of God for each
[1:19:52] age listen to this it releases an
[1:19:55] anointing that comes upon the people of
[1:19:57] that day to fulfill the word of that day
[1:20:00] isn't that right it's an anointing it's
[1:20:03] a special anointing that is supposed to
[1:20:05] come upon the Bride of this hour to help
[1:20:07] her fulfill the word for this day isn't
[1:20:10] that right to anoint what does anoint
[1:20:12] mean anoint means to set someone apart
[1:20:15] or to authorize and equip someone or him
[1:20:18] or her for a task of spiritual
[1:20:21] importance Hallelujah and there's
[1:20:23] something important that we are supposed
[1:20:24] to do and you cannot do that in your
[1:20:27] human Spirit you cannot do that in your
[1:20:30] carnal mind you have to put away your
[1:20:32] caral mind that's enity towards God but
[1:20:35] you have to put on a spiritual mind an
[1:20:37] anointing a presence has to come upon
[1:20:40] you to help you to live this thing to
[1:20:43] help you to do this
[1:20:45] thing isn't that right seven Thunders
[1:20:48] are not going to live in your human
[1:20:50] Spirit your human Spirit can't do that
[1:20:53] that it's possible to have human virtues
[1:20:55] but they won't be God's virtues and it
[1:20:58] won't be God's requirement it has to be
[1:21:00] God's virtues God's spirit meeting God's
[1:21:03] Own requirement and then when God sees
[1:21:06] that life he caps it off with charity is
[1:21:09] Charity isn't that right that's our
[1:21:13] promise an anointing isn't that right
[1:21:16] David David was anointed king by God
[1:21:20] through the prophet Samuel isn't that
[1:21:21] right and God released his anointing
[1:21:24] upon David isn't that right the Bible
[1:21:26] says so as soon as the porn of oil was
[1:21:29] poured upon David the spirit of God
[1:21:32] rested upon David from that time onward
[1:21:35] and a evil spirit took a hole upon Saul
[1:21:39] isn't that right Hallelujah Saul was was
[1:21:42] anointed all the time but when the
[1:21:45] season changed the spirit changed when
[1:21:48] the season changed the spirit made its
[1:21:51] identification with David
[1:21:53] a man after God's Own Heart God's true
[1:21:56] man for the
[1:21:57] hour isn't that right hallelujah
[1:22:00] hallelujah isn't that right and David is
[1:22:02] a ruddy old fell Ruddy little fell and
[1:22:04] back there feeding the Sheep taking care
[1:22:06] of the Lambs and and nobody pays him any
[1:22:09] mind and any attention he's just a
[1:22:11] little fella nobody listens to him he's

[1:30:11] the age of adoption isn't that right and
[1:30:14] adoption is a hard process it's almost
[1:30:18] scary when you think about what God

[1:34:34] have an
[1:34:35] adoption an adoption ceremony he said
[1:34:38] now when the father in the Old Testament
[1:34:39] understood that his son was come of age
[1:34:42] and had been uh seasoned out onto
[1:34:44] adoption unto uh he said they borned a
[1:34:47] child but when they a son right then but
[1:34:51] then they they they'll never be no more
[1:34:52] than just a child see just an ordinary
[1:34:54] son until they mature and show what they
[1:34:58] are then he calls him out then now here
[1:35:01] we are church he said are you ready he

[1:35:07] minute he said you see now we're going
[1:35:09] to place the church he said now when the
[1:35:11] church gets to that place he says
[1:35:13] Manasses belong over here Ephraim you
[1:35:15] over there then he takes them out to a
[1:35:18] certain place isn't that right the
[1:35:21] father does and he sets him up on a high
[1:35:23] place like this and he has a ceremony
[1:35:27] and they all come around and he said I
[1:35:29] want everyone to know that this is my
[1:35:31] child and I adopt my son I want anyone
[1:35:34] to know from hence forth that his name I
[1:35:37] dress him up in a special dress on him I

[1:35:53] been my son since he was born Hallelujah
[1:35:56] isn't that right and you've been a
[1:35:57] Christian since you come out isn't that
[1:35:59] right but he said since he received the
[1:36:01] Holy Ghost he's been my son see but now
[1:36:04] I'm going to place him positionally now
[1:36:07] in Authority what he fires is fired and
[1:36:11] what he hires is hired verily verily if
[1:36:15] I say unto you if I say to you to this
[1:36:17] tree to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:36:19] doubt in your heart but believe believe
[1:36:21] that what you said will come to pass you
[1:36:24] can have what you said see there you are
[1:36:27] there you are see he's my son how many
[1:36:29] knows that that's the adoption isn't
[1:36:31] that right that they adopted the son
[1:36:33] after he proved to be the right kind of
[1:36:35] son isn't that right everybody ever read
[1:36:37] the Bible it's a placing of a Sons isn't
[1:36:41] that right I'm we to close you can play
[1:36:42] something softly he said now God did the
[1:36:44] same thing to his son when he took Jesus
[1:36:47] up on the mount Transfiguration he took
[1:36:49] Peter James and John up there he said
[1:36:51] that three Witnesses of the earth he
[1:36:53] said there was Jesus Moses and Elijah
[1:36:54] God upon that mountain they they stood
[1:36:57] up there on that mountain he said the
[1:36:58] first thing you know they looked and
[1:37:00] Jesus was glorified before them is that
[1:37:02] right how many knows that's the
[1:37:03] scripture what' he do he dressed him in
[1:37:05] a robe of
[1:37:06] immortality he said and his Ramen shine
[1:37:09] like the sun is that right and a cloud
[1:37:11] overshadowed him him and Peter and John
[1:37:13] and them fell on their face and they
[1:37:15] looked and there stood Moses and Elijah
[1:37:17] talking to him Moses had been dead and
[1:37:19] buried in an on Mark grade for 800 years
[1:37:23] Elijah took a chariot ride to Heaven 500
[1:37:25] years before that but there they were
[1:37:27] still there there was he was talking to
[1:37:29] him see he had taken Jesus up to see
[1:37:31] them to see what it was all about see
[1:37:33] showing him things and they talked with
[1:37:35] him and they had a conversation then
[1:37:38] stood Peter looking back again and the
[1:37:40] glorification was off Jesus they seen
[1:37:42] Jesus and then only a voice come from
[1:37:44] the cloud and said this is my beloved
[1:37:46] Son hear ye him his name's just as good
[1:37:50] as mine now that's right hear ye him
[1:37:53] that's it adopted or plac Sons isn't
[1:37:57] that right I end this quote here the
[1:38:00] prophet says if you place your face in
[1:38:02] God's word and your eyes towards heaven
[1:38:05] and let your pants legs be bagged at the
[1:38:07] knees you understand be reverent before
[1:38:10] God there'll be someday that God will
[1:38:13] take you over to the side one way and
[1:38:17] give to you a power and a gift and that

[1:38:23] has been with
