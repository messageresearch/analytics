Bibles i' like you to turn to Isaiah chapter 53 for scripture reading brother Isaac going to bless you this morning and share the word with you but before he comes I have something upon my heart I like to share just before he comes Isaiah 53 1-7 who had believe of report unto whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground he had no form nor cess when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he has despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteem him not surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him strickly smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for transgression he was bruised for iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his Tripes we are healed amen all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before his sharers is dumb so he open it not his mouth may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated such a blessing to be here this morning welcome greetings in Jesus name uh we say God bless all those connected to us on the internet may God sh shine shine upon your life where you are today amen amen and um just a thought I have strength through weakness that's a thought strength through weakness and from communion brother brah said these words now if God did not spare his own son from Cruel testing then he will not spare you and I from Cruel testing and Jesus was here confronting the greatest test that he had ever had Gethsemane laid just before him a whereare that once that final all sufficient test must come when the burdens of the entire world laid upon his bless shoulders there was no one in all heaven or Earth could ever stood it but him and to know that all of the sins of past sins present sins and future sins rested upon this decision it was one of the most greatest victories that Christ ever won or proved his great messiahship as when he said to God not my will thine be done that was the greatest Victory he had ever won all the Demons of Torment was around to tempt him and try him and when we get right with God when our hearts become pure and the Holy Spirit has taken its place in our hearts it's the most glorious thing to have testing amen amen amen a s like 35% before we would say it again when we get right with God when our hearts become pure and the Holy Spirit has taken its place in our hearts it's the most glorious thing to have testing the Bible tell us that our testings and trials are more precious to us than silver or gold of this world and we should be thankful that means you're grateful to God to be considered Worthy to be tested remember he could to throw you away but he decide to work you and rechannel you and repurpose you for his honor and His glory for his honor Hallelujah therefore the greatest victory of overcoming for Christ was in The Garden of Gethsemane under anguish under pain and that word anguish means severe mental or physical pain or suffering anguish misery sorrow heartache dispear desolation grief anguish is to be extremely distressed about something amen he was a man acquainted with grief amen not just with luxury or everything working out nice and everything working out this is we talk about to be like Jesus this is Jes Jesus we talking about we talking about what he was acquainted with what he went through what he had his fights and battles with so externally here we go there may be no sign of the mighty power of God especially when you're praying especially when you're struggling there may be no Mighty signs but in that weakness in that struggle God is at work to accomplish his will in your life who have known where Jesus took some step forward in the Ghana Gethsemane and prayed and his sweat like drops of blood who would have thought that was the greatest Victory when a man in prayer saying not my will but thy will be done if it's only possible let this cup pass I'm in a great battle I wish I could get out of it but I can't I make a choice oh do I hear a shout in the house this is my decision to pay the price this is my decision to walk the talk oh give me a shout in the house this morning it wasn't easy but it was worth it Hallelujah externally there may be no sign of the mighty power of God but he works when you are feeble when you are trembling when you are weak when you're feeling to give up when you don't know to turn to the left and to the right he is still working and you can overcome right on your knees right amidst your struggle keep on struggling th worm Jacob keep on struggling you're going to turn into a butterfly but keep on struggling Hallelujah within the cocon of your life don't stop don't give up struggle until you break out struggle until you break through struggle until your prayer is answered from God hallelujah Oh Glory to God struggle keep on struggling hallu Hallelujah 2 Corinthians 12 verse 71 this is poor un least I should be exalted above the measure through the abundance of Revelation there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me least I should be exalted above measure this is Paul describing how God uh sends stuff to make sure he stay humble to make sure he stay under the dust to make sure he stay under cover least he get puffed up and proud and arrogant and lifted up because he gets some little something more than others and how human beings are when they get a little something more they want to walk like praise God with their nose up in the air but God have a way of flattening you and send you down to the dust that same man sa he was riding his high horse and that Pillar of Fire knock him off his high horse and he B who are thou Lord and when you think you a big Shir God Is Bigger Than You he going to knock you off your pride he going to break your arrogance because in the last days they're going to have a type of people in church they're not going to be easy they're going to be heavy they're going to be highminded they could be lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God and I want you this morning to be a lover of God I love of his word I love of his power I love of Revival I love of his fire I love of his cleansing power i l of his quicking power you got to forgive me but I'm a revivalist oh God I can't take the deadness can't take the coldness if you don't want a Revival I want one and I'm going to have it I'm going to take it I'm going to Res it I get it he promised to send it oh Hallelujah somebody going to break out somebody going to be a Pioneer somebody going to do what others has never done before yes somebody want to give the Lord some shouts and some praises and some worship like they they've never given him before Hallelujah Glory you may be seated God didn't ask Peter and James and John all them what is the problem he come to bring solution how to solve them here come address the problem he come to bring Solutions how to solve them CH have you any meat they said we search we fish all night and caught nothing he said casting it to the right side I just want all your meat I a come to ask you if there's no fish in the sea because I put fish inside of there I am God and I change not I can put Birds where there are no birds squirrels where there are no squirrels are you hearing me this morning my God I can change a liver the kidney I could repair that I could replace that I made it I could heal it my God I feel real Pentecostal this morning real oldfashioned this morning praise God I can praise God can change your wife right now right in the house the pillar can drop down the angel of God who are th Lord I am Jesus you not hear what I'm saying this morning glory glory glory glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise God woo hallelujah hallelujah my God you want be seated I want to see people jump up I want to run out the Pew run downstairs and come back up my God you can't keep still because God put fire in your heart he put fire on your feet and you confessing this morning that the devil is truly a liar every time he open his mouth he's the father of Lies he lied about you all these years he told you you wasn't a son he told you it wasn't a daughter but that was always a lie let to be seated Paul not trying to be a big shot Paul and Apostle of the Gentiles not declaring you who I am and you had to worship and bow and do this and do that no Paul was speaking plainly that he got so much Revelation that God had to keep him and put something upon him to check him for this thing I besought the Lord chce that it might depart from me and he said unto me come on he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness and when Paul caught that Paul said most gladly therefore I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure my God the devil is messed up and screwed up when cor decide to take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ sake no more excuses oh give the Lord a shout are there mature sons and daughters in the house this is not for babies this is enough for Di [Applause] wearing pacifier sucking children this is enough for that this is for mature then you begin to Glory then you stop making excuses and you shut up and stop complaining and take a complaint into praise you flip the complaint over into a praise and the devil get messed up when you begin to praise God when you're supposed to be grumbling complaining gossiping and moping you start to flip the whole thing over I will glory in my infirmities I will glory in my reproach I will glory in my persecution I will glory in my distress the god going to get Glory Hallelujah therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in the the Str for Christ sake for when I am weak then am I strong I am become a fool in glorian you have compelled me for I ought to have been commended of you for in nothing am I behind the very cheest Apostle do I be nothing from perfect my perfect weakness listen to The Prophet God passes the Nobles and get the weakest God passes those who think they are something to get somebody that don't know nothing in order to work his purpose in their life God said to Paul my strength is perfect in your weakness my strength becomes more perfect as you become more weaker more you can yield to me the better I can use you you see normally when we get high yes on the job on the money on the house on the car on the land on the post or whatever it is we feel sufficient so then that sufficiency make us less dependent upon God so God have to give you a highfall make something happen make a split in your life make some kind of punch inside of there to oh God that's what he want to hear you that you could get to depend on him lean on him because if you could lean on a brother you lean on your brother lean on on a father lean on an uncle lean on a husband lean on your wife lean on anybody except him but he want you to lean on him that's why he pulled the props off of Isaiah and Isaiah to run into the temple Isaiah was leaning on King Uzziah and when God pulled the prop this is where he saw the Lord high and lifted up then he can confess my dependency is on God that's when the SS come among him to bring fire to bring cleansing power oh Hallelujah so the more you can forget about your education the more you can forget about your denomination the more you can forget about the stuff and your stuff and yield yourself to me the more I can use you CU you become weak and I'll make you my own purpose strong God can make strength out of weakness that's the reason he always does it who would think of the humility of his own son when he was born in the manger manard B cow stall wrapped and swad and CLA he could have come to a palace he could have come through corridors of Heaven A full Angel salute but he choose to make Christ the example of us he brought him in humility he never trained him in the schools of this world but he trained him by his own power so he could completely yield himself not to the thoughts of man or the strength of the world but yield himself to the power of God and that's what us today we yield ourselves today to our great denominations and Realms we yield ourselves denomination people sold out to their churches to the what they believe in that kind of a way they not sold out to God because they don't have a personal experience with Christ they have a church experience so as long as they in the church they safe and I'm sorry they're not safe oh you're not safe you have to want a personal experience you have to want your own fire that church are fire boy don't talk about that church of fire you have to have the fire don't talk about no church fire the church fire is one thing but do you have the fire of God to take you through what yet lays ahead amen you hear what I said the fire is not phenomenal the fire is to prepare you for what lays ahead because a trying time is coming a challenging time is yet ahead of [Applause] you amen we heal ourselves to denomination what it's got to say and what they say about it that's contrary to God's will we've got to heal ourself to the spirit of God and go where the spirit should go Hebrews God soldiers Heroes and they said they said out of weakness was made strong that's Hebrews 11:34 they had to get weak before they could get strong out of their weaknesses they were made strong you you put on that scripture here's something to console us I'm almost done here's something that console us here's something that encourages out of weakness and humility God chooses the people to build his kingdom out of if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of God with his church we will stand in a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected cast out by the world and know it's nothing isn't it strange that God Likens a sheep a sheep is the most helpless thing there is nothing is so insufficient or defense than a sheep a rabbit can run a squirrel can get up in a tree a dog can bite a l can tear a horse can kick a bird can fly but the Sheep stands helpless that's the way God wants us Amen to realize that we are totally insufficient then God takes that person and begins to mold himself into that person and make his hands do what God would have his hands to do make his lips speak what God lips would speak because they're not his they Gods he begins to build a character begins to take his weakness to make his own self am he brings us here on Earth but then we are educated we are smart did you ever think about that and then that what educated Great Men Builders professional men and what but God's side was weak and humble that's how God uses them that's God's opportunity that's God's way of getting to us is when we are weak we get something then this encourages of course because God's whole kingdom is built out of these kind of people then when you get that kind when you get to that kind of a way then you in his kingdom the case is with us here we go not that we are too weak the case is we are too strong we are just too strong we are Str stronge headed on another side bullheaded nobody can't tell you nothing because you seen it so and you stand by your conviction and you seen it so and God have nothing with you seen it so God say my thoughts is not your thoughts my ways are not your ways so it's not how you see it it's God's vision of it oh Hallelujah that's what you need a vision that transform your life that that show you something Beyond you isn't that right the cas is we're not too weak we're too strong we're too strong too Str strong-headed we're too strong in our head we know too much God wants to get that out of us we're too strong we're too strong to yield to him we to yield ourselves and this I'm going to close with the scripture First Corinthians one and Paul saying Christ said me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words at least the Cross of Christ should mean none effect for the preaching of the Cross is them that perish foolishness but to us which are saved it is the power of God for it is written here we go I will destroy the wisdom of the wise I will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of this world had not God made foolish the wisdom of this world for after in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God here's why because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty and many noble are called but God yeah we go are you ready have chosen the foolishness of this world to confound the wise God had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are Mighty the Bas things of the world and things which are despised had God chosen ye things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh shall glory in his presence hallelujah what about Jesus he could have boasted but he humbled himself he humbled himself and became obedient to the cross a man acquainted with grief a man acquainted with sorrow do you want to be like Jesus am

preaching of it in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen you appreciate our pastor this morning you appreciate the comments this morning you appreciate the message last week the refiners fire what a masterpiece of a masterpiece you know during the week I said to him I feel like I'm in the refiner fire and it's something he read and I said that was it for me when he did some research on how they put the silver in the refiner fire and in every Flame or the fire there's the hot spot it's the hottest part of the fire and that's where God places you but he has to keep his eye on you because if he leaves you there one second too long you get destroyed so no matter how hot the trial is he is watching you because he knows just how much fire you need to be in a position that he could shape you and he could mold you and he could take the impurities out to you so I thank God this morning for the refiners fire I thank God for the trials I thank God for the testings I thank God for the pressure because it's good it doesn't always feel good but it's good can the church say Amen so I have a thought this morning if you have your Bibles would will you turn with me to four portions of scripture going to read quite a bit this morning I don't normally do this but I think it's necessary for this message we're going to read two scriptures in the Old Testament and two in the New Testament we're going to be in the Book of Ecclesiastes we're going to be in the book of St Matthew and the Book of St Mark reading Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and reading verse one to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance moving in the same book Ecclesiastes to chapter 7 and reading from verse two it is better to go to the house of mour than to go to to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart am sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance The Heart Is Made better the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of Mirth reading from St Matthew Chapter 5 and reading from verse one in Matthew 5 and verse1 and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be f F blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake and our last scripture reading from the book of St Mark chapter 5 and reading from verse 21 and this scripture interestingly as I Was preparing it I didn't even realize where it fell but this scripture actually falls right after Jesus comes back from dealing with Legion so he's coming back from the other side so verse 21 and when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue gyrus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly seeing my little daughter lith at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and that she shall live and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many Physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse when she had heard of Jesus came in the press behind and touched His Garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall be whole and straight away the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes and his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude thr in thee and sayest thou who touch me and he looked around about to see her that had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy fate had made thee whole go in peace and behold of thy plague and while he had spake there came from the ruler of the synagogues house certain which said thy daughter is dead why troubles thou the master any further as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he said unto the ruler of the synagogue Be not Afraid only believe and he suffered no man to follow him save Peter and James and John the brother of James and he come into the house of the ruler of the synagogue and see it the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly and when he was coming he saith unto them why make he this a do and Weep the damsel is not dead but sleep it and they laughed him to scorn but when he had put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him and entered in where the damsel was lying and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha come me which is by interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise and straightway the damsel AR Rose and walked for she was of the age of 12 years and they were astonished with a great astonishment and he charged them straightly that no man should know it and command it that something be given her to eat may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow our heads one more time Heavenly Father any man could read the scriptures but it it really takes the Holy Ghost to breathe life upon it Lord and I pray this morning you would walk out of the pages of the Bible and touch your people Lord touch my body Lord father minister to us this morning Father may you bless the word and the reading of it in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you may be seated Hallelujah this morning so I have for this morning a very interesting title my title this morning is a house of mourning a house of morning we read in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 there's to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under Heaven time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted and A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up and it goes on a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn and a time to dance and many times in our lives we find ourselves attracted to one thing more than another it is our nature to go after joy and go after what's what's Pleasant or what's appealing to us there are things that we find ourselves that we like and there things that we we don't like and it doesn't matter what the situation is it's a war going on because doctors tell you you should eat this to be healthy but what you should eat and what you want to eat has two different effects on your taste buds but we find ourselves in life life is about balance and when you read that scripture they said to everything there's a time and there's a purpose and so you can't get away from it because even even if you have the moments when you are happy all the time there will come a time when you have to cry and no matter how long you cry there's a time that you'll have to laugh because that's just the way it is there's a time to everything there's a time to dance even if you don't and have never danced in the spirit there's coming a time when you have to dance because to everything there's a season and a purpose and a can I get a witness in the house this morning we are going somewhere this morning so to everything there is a time and there's a season you can't get away from it you cannot just have one you cannot just have laughter all the time you cannot just have dancing all the time you cannot just have what you want all the time because that's not how God does things brother brandom said it this way he said there are mountains and there are valleys and you can never appreciate the mountain unless you know what the valley is can I get a witness in the house just morning he said the very nature of God is a god of variety there are yellow flowers there are red flowers there are pink flowers there are green flowers they all kinds of flowers because that's how God wants to see the tapestry of life even God himself there are times he is glad there are times he's angry he said I'm a jealous God he himself goes through these changes that take place kind of church say Amen there's a there's a time for everything Hallelujah there's a season for everything you could you could be walking the street and it's a dry season but when the season Chang the rainy season you can't walk as if it's a dry season not because you don't change doesn't mean change is happening around you because it's a time to every season when it's the rainy season you need to adjust how you dress adjust what you carry you got to carry an umbrella or something because the season has change if you don't change you'll be forced to change or you'll get wet can I get a witness in the houses this morning to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven and under the heaven every purpose that God has for under Heaven has a time to every purpose that's why you couldn't miss the service this morning if you wanted too because there's a time to the purpose for you being here this morning your condition has nothing to do with his purpose and the time for his purpose what happened to you yesterday has nothing to do with his purpose and the time time he placed on his purpose because when God says the time is up and the time is ready and he calls Saul from over of his horse Saul couldn't say check me back next week his time had come because it's a time and a season a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant so all these years we have had times of planting the word seed but is a time for a harvest there's a time to reap the rewards of the sacrifice and your labor the time to see the blessings of the travailing Zion there's a time to see the benefits of the testimony that you have maintained on your job maintained in your neighborhood there's a time to every [Applause] purpose A Time to Kill and a time to heal the devil is afraid of this scripture because when the time to heal is come there's nothing could stop a time of healing there's nothing to stop a time of life there's nothing to stop a time of dancing When God says it's time for you to dance you may have never danced before you may not even know how to dance but when David saw they are coming it was his time to dance his wife got flustered about it but he had tapped into this scripture a time to dance he had mourned for a long time he had weeped for a long time but the time for dancing had come can the Church Say Amen you could only appreciate the mountain unless you taste the valley that's why God takes you through your ups and downs and your trials and your testing and your tribulation and your persecution because there's coming a mountain there's coming a holy city there's coming a holy Jerusalem those who get there will appreciate that day and sing the songs of Amazing Grace because the Angels cannot sing that song because the Angels don't know what it is to be in the valley the Angels don't know what it is to be sad Angels don't know what it is to be depressed and frustrated and to feel like giving up they don't have that transition between laughter and sadness between joy and peace but we know what it is because we are operating under a law that Solomon wrote about everything there's a season and a time to everything under the heaven so brother Isaac I've been waiting I've been holding on I've been sighing I've been praying uh that's good that's all right but there's something happening behind the scenes uh that have nothing to do with your sign and have nothing to do with your crying it has to do with God's clock God's time piece and it never stops ticking it never stops moving and one of these days an alarm will go off it's God's Heavenly alarm when you have a destiny you have an appointment with the supernatural that you cannot miss you can the church say Amen hallu hallu we're going somewhere this is just the background Hallelujah but the brandom said the time has come friends when something's got to be said amen got to break the routine a little bit we got to say something a little more effective the time has come for the church to move upall or to go back is that how you feel this morning what's the good coming to church after the service and you're not moving up you're not getting stronger you're not getting faster when you join the Army after a week of training you supposed to be stronger than the first day you came in after a month of training you're supposed to be a little stronger a little faster a little more experience so I say this when the time has come for the church all of your experiences now you have work experience Hallelujah can the church say Amen when you apply for a job you want to know how much experience you have amen and when God is looking for some vessels to use he wants to know how much experience you have how many Devils you push back how many times you've been pressed down but you didn't stay down you got back up again can the church say Amen the time has come brother the brand said for these things to be fulfilled the time has come for god Jehovah to rise on the scene and show himself that's the prophet's words now the time has come now for you to make a decision tonight what side you'll be on come on Young people the time has come where we can't pet anymore we've got to preach and that's what we are doing in this season every service we're not petting anymore we are preaching the unsearchable riches of Heaven the time has come to believe or to don't believe do we have any believers in the house this [Applause] morning the time has come to act upon what you know to be the truth the time has come for a show from the message the hour has come brother said the time has come that God will gather his church together through under one great big banner of the Lord Jesus Christ and pour out his powers among them and great signs and wonders will take place the time has come the time has come for the Pentecostal Church to make a stand the time has come to circumcise the church and call out this foolishness the time has come to go back to the old Landmark the the time has come for the outpouring the time has come for the Gathering of the people the time has come for Jesus to come the time will be here soon to give out the rewards brother I'm excited because the clock is taken and the time has [Music] [Applause] come don't worry I haven't gone to the text just yet Hallelujah brother be careful the prophet said that your crown is in set on someone else's head the time has come we're at the end time if we're ever going to do anything Brethren we're going to do it now the time is at hand the time has come when God shaken every denomination Under the Sun can the church say Amen can the church say Amen am wonderful so we read this scripture and I'm building a background because I'm going somewhere to everything there's a season there's a time to mourn and a Time time to dance and then we read the scripture in Ecclesiastes and I want you to ride with me this morning where Solomon continues and I want you to understand the picture of Solomon for the young people who have not studied it in depth would you've studied it God gave Solomon an opportunity he said whatever you ask for I'm I'm going to give it to you it was a blank check whatever Solomon requested he was going to get it Solomon could have asked for riches and wealth and whatever he had an opportunity to ask and whatever he asked for he was going to receive it but Solomon made a choice and he asked for wisdom that's right and God said to him you know what I'm going to give you wisdom unlike anybody else but because he asked wisdom I'm also going to give you a great Kingdom I'm going to give you strength I'm going to give you and he gave him everything else wealth and everything else that he didn't even ask ask for so when we read the book of Ecclesiastes it's it's written by a king like no other king and Ecclesiastes after he says in chapter three there's a time to mourn and dance he goes on to say it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart and then he goes in verse four the heart of the wise is in the house of more but the heart of fools is in the house of merth and throughout the Book of Proverbs Solomon takes his time to draw a distinction about fools and wise in fact he very early he begins to speak about the fear of the Lord amen is the beginning of wisdom amen and he begins to draw a distinction between fools and the wise are you with me this morning Hallelujah amen Solomon says in fors a fool a fool finds pleasure in evil conduct Solomon goes on whoever spreads slander is a fool I'm not calling anybody a fool this morning I'm just reading the scriptures the mouth of the fool gushes fully so when somebody is speaking nonsense they are a it is a man's honor to avoid Strife but every fool not some every fool is quick to quarrel that's word the way of a fool seems right to him but a wise man listens to advice so Solomon begins to create this distinction between fools and wise this has nothing to do with how long you're the church that's right if you're a deacon Elder Minister Usher truste it doesn't this is not about that it's about how you speak how you act what you do a fool spurns rejects his father's discipline Solomon goes on as a dog returns to his vomit so a fool repeats his folly and then he goes on to make this distinction it is better to go to a house of mourning and he said the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of the fool is in the house of Mer you know there people who like to joke and they like to laugh and they like to have fun there's nothing wrong with laughter and smiling there's a time to laugh there's a time to smile there's a time to dance but it's also a time to mourn but Solomon makes a powerful distinction he said it is better if you have a choice between the house of laughter and the house of Mirth and the house of Happiness he said it is better to go into the house of mourning that's right because the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning you gain wisdom in the house of mourning because in the house of mour it's not all about what's funny Hallelujah in the house of morning it brings you to confront will I go out like this man will I go out like this woman in the house of morning they talk about who went on was he a good man was he honorable man was she a good woman was she a prostitute was he an honest man was he a man with a testimony was he a real Christian did he have a testimony I've been to houses of mourning of real Christians where the neighbors who don't know Jesus would say that man was different that man loved the Lord that man Hallelujah it is better to be in the house of mour than the house House of birth a house of morning that's my title this morning a house of mourning because in the house of mourning you get wisdom in a house of mourning you get to reflect in a house of mour you begin to think carefully am I living right about a week or so ago he didn't sent me a message for a schoolmate of mine who got a heart attack and died all of a sudden Jesus it shook him it shook me I'm young I'm like that age a heart attack and all of a sudden made me think am I healthy that was the first thought that came to mind cuz all of a sudden when you are confronted with your mortality you begin to think I need to exercise I need to eat better can't allow things to stress me and I didn't even go to the house of morning so much more when you were there and you were in that environment yes so I want to paint a picture this morning of the House of morning when Jesus was here there are very few houses that he visited in very early in his ministry he would visit a house and there was a wedding and we know it is his first miracle he's there he's invited nobody really knows who he is there's suspicion there are rumors he's just there and they run out of wine and his mother Mary come and say listen we run out of wine he said that what is that to do with me I'm just a guest like everybody else and say whatever he says to do do it Jesus is in that house and when Jesus is in the house says something got to happen [Applause] and Jesus gives instruction pour water and they pour water and but the brandom said he bypass the grapes he bypassed the pressing of the grapes he bypassed the fermentation he and you know what it was the best wine they say who does that who saves the best wine for last why Jesus was in the house can the church say Amen I'm trying to paint a picture this morning there are very few houses that Jesus visited when he walked the Earth he would visit a house of Simon where he would face disrespect it was the custom because of the roads and the camels and the donkeys and the animals that when you walk the streets your feet would be dirty By Invitation he didn't force himself into that house by invitation he is there and they allowed the Messiah to sit in the house with dirty feet and Jesus as a wise man he didn't argue he he didn't slander he didn't criticize them he didn't say oh gosh all yes he may here everybody else would clean no he sits there and a woman sees this is disturbed by it she begins to cry he said this is not right and with her tears she washed his feet hallah with her hair she wipes his feet Jesus visits the home of zakus and there are few homes that he visit visited and each of these homes had a different story a different message a different lesson to be gleaned out of the life of Jesus and we handled it but I want to go a bit deeper this morning brother the Jason and look at how Jesus dealt with two situations we preached two weeks ago about Jesus going to the other side to deal with a man who couldn't come to him so Jesus went to him and the Bible says as he returns he is met with a group of people and a man called gyrus comes up to Jesus and said Jesus my daughter's 12 years old she's dying and Jesus the Bible said is on his way towards charis's house but there's a huge crowd around him and at the same time there's this woman with the issue of blood who interrupts Jesus's journey to gyrus his house so you see as you watch Jesus life he's going from mission to from mission to Mission there's no wasting time he finishes preaching and he comes from preaching tired he goes to the other side he delivers the man callion he comes back gyrus confronts him he's walking there's a woman with the issue of blood Hallelujah he's on a mission and as Jesus is walking this woman touches him and Jesus says who touched me I felt virtue left me disciples say but Jesus everybody touching you amen and he speaks to the this woman and the Bible says while he's talking to her a man comes to gyus and say gyus don't waste the Master's time your daughter just died while Jesus finish and talk to the woman with the issue of blood who was just healed he overhears this he said don't worry about it gyrus only believe and Jesus continues his journey brother kangali to the house of morning the Bible says when Jesus gets to this house of mourning but a shame there's crying there's wailing there's weeping yeah amen and Jesus ask why are you making all of this fuss why are you making all this noise I've come to wake up but the nights the Bible said they laughed at him they mocked him they scorned him because for a long time brother said she was sick so when Jesus come and said now we brother brand dramatized it and said she's dead you can't wake on no what but Jesus said get all the unbelief out and the Bible say after he threw them out after he threw all the unbelievers he goes up to this young damel and says arise and this young girl got back up and he said give her in one book they say give her some meat you know normally said they say when you're sick give you something soup and you know you say give us some meat give us some real food because the the sickness she had not only she raised from the dead but she's not even don't give her any soup give her some meat give her some heavy food she she could handle it because it's resurrection power resurrection power Jesus stepped into a house of mourning a house of sadness a house of weakness he may be [Applause] seated but mourning is not just for people who go on you know people mourn all kinds of stuff They Mourn their car They Mourn opportunities They Mourn where didn't work out They Mourn how their neighbors have stuff that they don't have and they go into their own mour because they don't have and it's painful that they do not that's in the scripture it's in [Music] scripture their own morning and it's important to understand because people don't study the Bible so when and that's the reason I read the blessed are the peacemakers and the poor in spirit because that scripture blessed are they that mourn is not mourning natural death because those scriptures let me draw a reference I'm kind of it's Sunday school this morning is that okay listen to the structure of Jesus's teaching he said blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven so what they are blessed with blessed the poor in it's something to attain it's something to have it's something to get blessed are the poor in spirit so if you get and if you are poor in spirit you get the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit blessed are they which do Hunger so they shall be filled there's nobody walking around saying I want to mourn as many people as possible that's not what this mourning is friends so there are three types of mourning can I teach a little bit amen natural mourning is grieving for someone you have lost God gives you a give the natural responses to mourn even Jesus mourned at the grave of Lazarus but that's not what Jesus is talking about here of all the the Beatitudes it's called it's submit a desire nobody would say about natural mourning no ber person would say I want to go after as much of it as I I can that's what not what Jesus is speaking about another type of morning is sinful morning King Ahab when he was king of Israel God gave him a palace and a kingdom and next to the Palace there was a poor man called naboth a poor man who had a Vineyard and the Bible said Ahab set his eyes on nebo's Vineyard the Bible said Ahab got vexed and suen he got sad he got depressed he started one biblical scholar said he started to pout he started to mourn because he couldn't get his hands on the vineyard that is called sinful mourning so it's a sadness is a grief that leads to death amen but Godly sorrow or Godly mour produces a repentance that leads to life so we talk about natural sorrow natural mourning with the loss of an individual there's sinful sorrow but there's also Godly sorrow there is Godly mourning amen it's the same thing like those that sigh and cry to the abomination in the city so blessed are they that mourn for the sin in the city blessed are they that mourn because we have lost young people people blessed are they that mourn because we need a Revival blessed are they that mourn because they are dead people in the church but they are dead but we are mourning for them blessed that mourn because they shall be comforted they shall be comforted with a Revival they shall be comforted without UNP pouring they shall be coverfor oh you don't hear me this morning you don't hear me this morning blessed are they that mourn for the tying and they're crying They Mourn because there are sick people in the church that need to be healed but but you are not happy you are mour and I want this to be a house of mour this morning because Jesus is attracted to a house of mour he could only perform Resurrection in a house of mourning there could be no Resurrection in a house of sickness but in a house of mourning Jesus could step in and he could raise the dead there are people in the church this morning that are dead so this is the house of mour for those that have given up a long time ago their bodies are here but their Spirits are messed up but in this house of mour I believe Jesus is in the building he has stepped into the building and we are throwing the unbelief out oh can I get a [Applause] witness hall hallelujah hallelujah spiritual mourning is sorrow over our sins against God spiritual mourning is sorrow because we haven't prayed enough spiritual mourning is sorrow because we haven't cried enough spiritual mourning is sorrow because we have not desperate to see the Holy Ghost pour out spiritual morning is when we come to the Altar and say Lord I'm sorry Lord I'm broken up Lord I've lost everything and I'm willing to lose more but I'm mourning this morning my pride I want my pride to die I'm calling a time of morning I'm calling a funeral for Pride I'm calling a funeral for lust I'm calling a funeral for Envy I'm calling a funeral oh you don't hear me this morning it's a house of mour there could be no Revival unless something dies there's got to be a debt something's going to die this morning fornication got to die adultery got to die oh you don't hear me this morning a house of mourning we're going to kill every evil spirit we're going to kill your flesh we're going to kill your mind battles we are going to kill doubt this will be a house of mourning because when God comes in to resurrect you what will come out is a living faith a living virtue a living knowledge a living Temperance can I get an amen in the house a house of mour a house of mour a house of mour there are all kinds of houses there are houses that are houses of laughter but this morning morning is a house of mourning there are times that the Deep stuff is talked about but we need more crying we need more sighing we need more soul searching we need more travail we need more dying out we need more giving up we need more surrender we need more letting go we need more giving up uh we need more breaking up we need more breaking up the follow ground we need to have a house a house of mourning because only through death we could live uh Jesus had to die he had to die so we can see resurrection power and he said because I live you are going to live [Applause] also Hallelujah you may be seated the house hallu of morning I was asking my wife if she knows or if she knew what the term awake comes from you know you say when somebody passes on you have to attend awake yeah and that term wake brother Clarence comes from years ago before there were medical professionals who would pronounce that somebody was dead there were many times centuries ago brother kangali where people would be unconscious people would be in a temporary coma and they would bury them or start to bury them or start a funeral for them and these people while they about to throw dirt over them they would wake wake up so when somebody passed on they would say let's wait three or four days just in case they wake up so that we don't make the mistake we made the last time you know what I love about God God makes sure and remove every doubt he makes sure and remove every room for the enemy so whereas somebody could have said but jra's daughter what if she was in a coma what if she was unconscious so Jesus runs away from a village because he had had some words with some of the Believers so the Bible said he couldn't go back there where Martha Mary and Lazarus were living so when they told him Jesus Lazarus is sick he say don't worry about it but then he came back and said but Jesus Lazarus is dead Jesus know they are mourning the death of Lazarus they really not on him amen so Jesus comes back and in this time brother Gideon they couldn't say Lazarus wake up they couldn't say he was unconscious because they all knew for days he was in the Tomb they knew Lazarus was stinking so it couldn't be awake it couldn't be unconscious it wasn't revived it wasn't it wasn't that this man was gone and Jesus comes to the house of morning and they have the ceks the coffee the biscuit the everybody is sad and he says one question where have you laid him take me to the place where you laid him where have you laid the problem where have you laid the situation take me to the problem I can't fix it where I'm at right now take me to where the problem is and they took Jesus to the problem he said roll away the stone roll away I don't want any hindrance because I'm about to perform some surgery in the house of mour people all now watching they're looking and say what Jesus up to there he goes again and Jesus stood there and said Lazarus come forth and brother here comes a man who they know was dead who didn't know for days he locked up didn't know he wasn't in church for a long time didn't know he missed Sunday service they know he wasn't there for the Revival and this man start to come outside this man start to move outside as best as he could because he was still tied up and they said lose that man and let him go set him free because he has a reason to shout he has a reason to Rejoice [Applause] Hallelujah and I say this morning if God could raise a man who was not just dead but was already rotten in his flesh a man who was already going a man who was already gone and he could raise him up how much more could God give a spiritual Resurrection to Sons and Daughters of the Living God hallelujah come on young people come on calebs come on headstone Tabernacle this is our time this is seed time this is bright time this is revival [Applause] time hallu can the church say Amen from the message perfect strength by Perfect weakness but the B said then God can achieve his purpose by sending not a Revival but listen carefully but brother what he needs to do first first before the Revival is send a killing that's right so we can revive you have to die before you can be born again he needs a killing of ourselves this Tabernacle he's speaking to the brandom tab and I see I'm speaking a headstone Tabernacle this morning this Tabernacle needs a killing and me with it that's the prophet's words all of us we need a killing so that we can be revived in a new life a new hold a New Hope a new experience we need first a day of mourning and that's what today is it's a day of mourning because we are going to kill every amalak every Philistine every hittite every jebusite [Applause] [Music] H Hallelujah we need first a day of mourning we need a place of yielding to the spirit and instead of so much depending upon schooling Upon Our programs and our campaigns and all we have we rely upon cooperation with so many different ministers to cooperate we allow if we can get so many why we wouldn't do it we won't go to the critics without that we got to get to a place Church where we can surrender our souls and lives even to the housewife to the farmer to the mechanic or whoever we are we got to surrender completely to God and know we are nothing then let God start from there is this now beginning to connect to the Potter and the clay to the refiners fire to God taking and trashing your life so something good could come out of it can the church say [Applause] Amen then he starts moving working and that includes all of us everyone that's the thing that we got to do history proves that God always choose the noodies to become his somebodies God takes the person that's nothing and he makes them something can the church say Amen so do we have any nothings in the house is there anybody in the house this morning who wants to give up who wants to let go who want to say Lord I'm willing to die with the Philistines like Samson I'm willing to die out take me also I'm willing to die to myself die to my thoughts die to my ideas died oh come on Church a house of mourning because out of the house of mourning God could bring new life out of the house of mourning God could raise the dead out of the house of mourning God can raise up preach out of the house of mour God could deliver the backsliders out of the house of mour he could say get the unbelief out and I say unto you arise arise and shine for thy light has come out of the house of morning I couldn't do it before but now that Lazarus is dead I couldn't come in before but now Lazarus is dead now I could do a miracle I couldn't come before but now that you at the end of your road uh now I'm ready to pour out the Holy Ghost now I'm ready to fill you now I'm ready to deliver you can the church say Amen H oh hallelujah hallelujah can the church say Amen oh gyrus was bad but Lazarus was worse jyra situation was bad but she was still in the room Lazarus was worse God was showing doesn't matter what the condition doesn't matter what the situation is doesn't even matter how long long you've been dead it's not just being dead it doesn't matter how long you've been dead there are people coming to church every Sunday with no joy there people coming to church every Sunday with no Victory the last time you say a good Hallelujah was 10 years ago you are here in church but you know you're dead on the inside this message this morning is to finish bury that dead you and see New Life come under resurrection power we want to bury the dead ways we want to bury the dead Church you want to bury the dead old former religion and give me the old time religion we want to bury the formality bury the canal bury just being in the message that's over we are committing It To The Ground today and we are raising up under resurrection power we are raising up under the anointing of the third P we are raising up to see a manifestation of the sons of God hallelujah Goodbye World goodbye to the all you say goodbye to the all you say farewell to the all you he's going into the ground this morning it's a day of morning and after today we shall see the king in his glory Because He Lives we will live also can the church Give the Lord a shout of Praise hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my time to Let It Go time to let the pass go it's dead it's finished bury it it's under the sea of forgetfulness it's dead don't raise it up God can't even raise it up again it's under the blood leave it there get up to the ground like the Lily who press through the m and press through the muck and press through the limitation and press through the negativity this is our day this is Resurrection Day this is Easter this is the new day this is the new time oh roll away the stone roll away the obstacles roll away everything roll away your pth roll away everything this morning and you come out of your grave you come out of your old ways you come out of your own life hallelujah oh my oh my oh my oh glory to God hallelujah when Jesus he may be seated was finished with gyus the Bible said there was so astonished Jesus knew their mind was blown out he said don't even tell nobody it don't even make sense trying to tell nobody because what I did for you it's for you it's an individual Affair that at that time was not for everybody and God in the upper room he pulls some men aside and they were dying out dry seeds in the upper room that same Peter who had cursed that same Peter who had backslid he was dying out for 50 days in the upper room dying out until there was no more Peter until and there was a day of mour then all of a sudden when Peter was dead and James was dead and there was no more flesh and there was no more personality there was no more agenda there was no more big me little you there was no more arm in the ministry there was no more of that Mary had no chip on her soul when everybody was dead when everybody had died out when the day of morning had come when everybody was us H you may be seated you may be seated I want to get this right when God visited lot via the angels and told them come out of Sodom but whatever you do don't look back it was a day of mourning it was a day of death they were being killed and they had the opportunity to let what was in die with what was behind [Applause] them let me say that again they had the opportunity to let what was in them die with what was behind them because they had left the world they were already outside of Sodom you you don't hear me this morning Sodom was already behind them denomination was already behind them their P was already behind them they were walking out of Sodom they were walking into Glory they were walking into the deliverance and they had the opportunity to let what was in them die with what was behind them lot he did it he killed what was in him and did not look back the daughters killed what was in them and did not look back but Lot's wife she was out but she was still tied she was out but she was still connected she was out but there was still something alive in her that was not of God so she turned back this morning I say kill the past and kill whatever is in you that God hasn't want there that's why we come boldly this morning on this day of mour that Spirit of lust it's dead in the name of Jesus Christ whatever it is that Spirit of backsliding we come against it this morning in the name of Jesus Christ that Spirit of cancer of sickness of disease a female condition I don't care what it is we come against it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus you are not wanted here you have no place in this house [Applause] hallu [Applause] h no turning back no turning back we're not going back we're not going back we're not going back to the old ways we're not going back to the old you we're not going back to the old ways you may be [Music] seated I look forward to meeting Lazarus because it's impossible for you to go through what Lazarus went through and be the same a couple weeks ago I believe a few days ago I put something on on my Facebook page I said a man who's on his dead bed he doesn't ask for a book on mathematics he doesn't ask for a book on science doesn't ask for a book in theology he asks for the book The Only book that matters because he comes to confront the reality of his life death is not an easy thing natural and spiritual is still hard people don't want to die God Hallelujah the death of a corn of wheat people don't want to let go of themselves let go of their Ambitions let go of their desires let go of their perspectives let go of their dreams and Ambitions and God loves to crush our dreams and our Ambitions because he is not sharing your heart with anything else he wants all or nothing that's good there's no middle ground that's why the Bible say I rather you hot or you cold but that middle walk you want to walk where on Sunday You Are Holy and on Monday you are less Holy by Tuesday you're not sure if you're [Music] holy but when you begin to die out to yourself it's it's really amazing about the wisdom in the house of morning the older you get certain things begin to just lose its attraction after you live for a certain amount of years the car and the house and it doesn't it's not as important anymore the car becomes an object to take you from one place to the other because when you get closer to the end of your road because Solomon was bringing the wisdom to say the end of all men is De so take wisdom in the house of morning because when you reach that point you're not really worrying how much cylinders is in the engine it's not that important anymore the question that you ask is what will I re be what will I be remembered for sometime ago I I spoke at the home of someone who had passed on and I preached very short message called remember me and I took it from the text of the thieves who were next to Jesus on the cross and Jesus is day hanging in a cross and these two thieves are having a conversation Hallelujah and one of them said Remember Me amen and Jesus responds to him is today you will be with me I said those are two powerful words Hallelujah remember me and I ask the question how do you want to be remembered there are some people who are not remembered yeah because in the tapestry of Life they have left no marks yeah they have left not one life has been influenced or touched in any way Hallelujah but look at the life of Jesus so many years after look at the life of Peter so many years after James John Moses Noah we don't even need to know his surname just Noah and you know who I'm talking about Moses you know who I'm talking about their lives have left a mark on us that we could look back and glean how will you be remembered Hallelujah that's when you meet Daniel and he says tell me about you I know you heard about me what will they say about you how will you be remembered [Music] will he be remembered as a prayer Warrior just like Daniel Daniel I took inspiration from you and I prayed every [Music] day will I be remembered like Jesus at age 12 we're not reaching Jesus in his adul just at age 12 confounding the men in the in the temple at age 12 how would you be remembered we're still in a house of mour this morning and I pray that when we leave this house of morning that we can leave here with a renewed life A Renewed Zeal A Renewed passion to know the word a passion to please God and we would leave this Tabernacle this morning with the old you buried that's good that's good buried never to be taken up again and you have the opportunity today to be a real Christian and to sing that song Lord I want to be a Christian in my heart we allow the things of the world to Cloud us and to take up our time and to take up our energy and take our Zeal and we don't even talk to God enough Lord help us this morning can the church say [Applause] Amen but brandham said in the message believest thou this I'm not going to be too much longer with you he said I believe this is Brother Bram he's seen the resurrection of Lazarus he's talking about Jesus so when Jesus said our friend Lazarus sleep it Jesus said he do it well then he told him in plain words he's dead but I love this he said and I'm glad I wasn't there but I go wake him he knew what the father had told him to do so he said I go wake him and away he started back and when Lazarus was getting sicker and sicker and they sent for him oh how discouraging but said they would have felt they sent for the pastor to come pray for them they left the church they left everything to follow this man this Divine healer and no hopes of him coming he just went on ignored their message what a dark hour and the first thing you know death struck killed Lazarus took him out and they buried him the first day passed oh my how dark second day passed dark Third Day fourth day all hopes was gone he's already rotting in the grave and all hopes was gone discouraged their pastor had let them down their loved one The Miracle Worker had left leted them down didn't come to the rescue and there was Mary and Martha left alone mother and father gone now just them two girls left alone in the world someone come along to encourage them they set in sackcloth Black Veils and weeping and mourning over their brother and now in the very darkest of hours then Jesus come along that's the way he does it Amen brother it maybe your darkest hour right now but Jesus comes along just at the darkest of hour when I think of it is the darkest hour the woman with the blood issue had ever seen she spent all of her money then Jesus came along it was the darkest of our that gyrus had ever seen his little daughter laay dead but then Jesus came along it was the darkest of all that Peter and the apostles had ever seen on the sea just looked like it was going to drown but then Jesus came along and I say this morning maybe your darkest hour but Jesus is in the building this morning and he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's still a Healer he's still a way maker he's still a baptizer he's still a restorer he is still a resurrection and the life can the church say Amen the musicians can get ready I'm not going to be too much longer with you Hallelujah in the message God providing healing for this generation but the brandom said do you know the hour is coming when you'll be weeping and crying and mourning of these things amen amen when you'll not get them Hallelujah awake while there is while time is at hand Hallelujah and while you can receive God in the message in the in the scripture rather Zechariah 12 and verse 9 and it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all the the Nations that come against Jerusalem amen and I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourned for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn in that day shall there be great mourning in Jerusalem as the mourning of had Dron in the valley of mageddon and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the House of David apart and their wives apart and the family of the House of Nathan apart and their wives apart but the B said listen what a morning there be when he stands there making himself known to them like Joseph did listen and in that day shall it be such great mourning in Jerusalem they'll be so ashamed of theel when they stand there and see that the very one that they had crucified in the night standing there their own pressive J if there'll be such morning so with the Bram is speaking about a morning to come after the Gentile dispensation is over yes sir and when the Gentile dispensation is over there'll be mourning among the Jews Hallelujah so there is mourning that's coming no matter what the Jews will have to mourn the fact that they crucified their Messiah amen praise God and in that time there'll be those that are mourning Hallelujah from the Gentiles who heard the truth yes and They Mourn because they in the tribulation and They Mourn because they miss the Rapture and they will mourn because they wasted their time coming to church and not acting upon the word hallelujah praise God time to mourn a time to cry a time to laugh amen there is no avoiding Hallelujah the time of mourning so my burden this morning church is mourn today amen cry today amen sigh today amen seek God today sigh for the Abomination today mourn today for the sin in the church today mourn today for Revival mourn today for your breakthrough oh God help us this morning you could begin to PR something softly brother mam said in the message having conferences God send us back to the real thing Hallelujah let the Holy Ghost come among this people tonight Lord and start a Pentecost right here Grant it Lord in every heart oh God it's in their their hearts to do it that's the prophet he's Discerning it's in their hearts to do it but the cares of the world and the swiftness of passing of time has just wooed them out Lord start from this Pulpit from me and go to the audience and move like never before and give us a Zeal for lost souls we are mourning the souls that have been lost this morning we are mourning for the backsliders this morning granted Lord and we pray tonight that you'll put such a hunger in the hearts of people until up and down these river banks will be prayer meetings going on

to us uh oh God be merciful to us uh that's my prayer this morning God be merciful to us as we see our churches and our own groups begin to cool down down it seem like there's no great crying for lost
