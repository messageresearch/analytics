[25:07] I just I just get things I just share
[25:10] things amen praise God for there shall
[25:14] arise false Christ and false prophets

[25:42] I read it notice perilous time shall
[25:44] come men shall be lovers of their own
[25:47] selves I thinking about that and
[25:48] thinking how if have all these selfies

[26:03] thanful and holy without natural
[26:05] affection choose Breakers false accusers
[26:07] incontinent fears despises of those that
[26:10] are good traitors he high-m minded
[26:12] lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of
[26:14] God and these are not people outside
[26:17] having a form of godliness but deny
[26:19] power
[26:20] thereof and and and the Bible oh I'll
[26:23] read a little bit uh having a form of
[26:26] godliness but denying the power thereof
[26:28] from such turn
[26:30] away from such turn away for of this
[26:34] sort are they which creep into houses
[26:36] lead captive silly women Laden with sins
[26:39] Le We R divers lust ever learning never
[26:43] able to come to the knowledge of the
[26:44] truth as Janice and jambers wied Moses

[27:15] himself Tabernacle inside of you that is
[27:18] Def Faith it's not a faith it's God's
[27:21] life inside of you that is defate so
[27:24] when we turn our hearts back to defate
[27:26] it means you turn your heart back to the
[27:28] person of Christ Living in you and this
[27:31] is God's promise for this hour that
[27:33] Christ will be living in you how many

[30:11] people so watch the Bible is a seal book
[30:14] yes yes Revelation 4:5 tells us that
[30:18] until the lamb came and broke the seals
[30:20] and opened the book amen so therefore
[30:22] Baptist Methodist all the denomination
[30:24] they are preaching from a closed book
[30:26] unless they understand how these seals
[30:28] were
[30:29] opened do you understand that now so God
[30:32] sent a prophet that would open the seals
[30:34] that's right six of them because Christ
[30:38] is the seventh one that's right so he
[30:39] can only open six because Christ have to
[30:42] open the seventh one because that is the
[30:44] one have your names on
[30:46] it and Christ a taking no Chances with
[30:49] this bride the Lord himself the Lord
[30:53] himself descend from heaven with a shout
[30:56] to call you out come on now give the

[31:35] more important than the prime minister

[32:28] told the prophet pick up a pen and write
[32:31] he told him the secret is the word is in
[32:33] the brain therefore they had to be a way
[32:35] for the word to come in the bride now a
[32:37] lot of people used to laugh at us
[32:39] because we were quoting the prophet they
[32:42] call us quoters not preachers we can't
[32:44] preach we only quoting what they fail to
[32:48] understand that the words from a prophet
[32:51] is not just words he's not a preacher

[37:11] free preachers all those preachers are
[37:14] preaching freely for 3 hours and
[37:15] preaching
[37:18] nothing I could say in 50 minutes what
[37:20] is spend three hours to tell the people
[37:23] just talking and yapping and killing
[37:25] time
[37:26] and you could say in 15 minutes what it
[37:29] Taken 3 hours to say all that talk waste
[37:34] people time because the people don't
[37:37] know what's
[37:39] coming what's coming what's coming
[37:42] that's right and Jesus scripture we read
[37:46] he say what's coming and J shall arise
[37:50] false
[37:51] Christ false prophets shall show great
[37:55] signs and wonders now these guys that
[37:59] yet don't think I talk about anybody
[38:02] because reach
[38:05] yet so I am not talking about anybody I
[38:08] want you to understand that these guys
[38:10] that I'm talking about didn't come yet
[38:14] yet they have a time to come because
[38:17] they can't come until we

[38:33] bit brother Bram for anointed once he
[38:37] said now he said Abel offered unto God
[38:40] ex sacrifice and came God testified he
[38:43] was righteous amen then he switched to
[38:45] Peter who do men say I the son of man am
[38:48] some say you're this some say you're
[38:50] that some say the other fine those out
[38:53] there don't know who I am now who do you
[38:55] say I am amen they still did know and
[38:58] Peter broke into the spirit and said th
[39:01] to Christ now this a sinner man you know
[39:02] this's a CBD man little drinking smoking
[39:05] He orary Man breaking into something by
[39:08] sovereignty Elohim Elohim the Lord the
[39:10] spirit the Father the anointing so God
[39:13] have nothing to do with uh what you
[39:14] think who supposed to get Revelation he
[39:17] he's Sovereign he gives it to whomsoever
[39:19] he will somebody lying somebody in
[39:22] fornicate it doesn't matter somebody
[39:24] blind somebody backing somebody commit
[39:26] adultery it doesn't matter he is
[39:28] Sovereign he could reveal himself to
[39:31] whom soever he will could somebody say
[39:34] Amen or that so stop stop getting a
[39:37] fight with people who are
[39:39] blessed because yours
[39:49] coming hallelu watch he said Upon This
[39:52] Rock I'll build my church not brother
[39:54] over building church or this pastor
[39:55] building church I will build
[39:58] my church and that church doesn't
[39:59] consist of bricks and stones and cement
[40:01] that church is revelation so as soon as
[40:03] somebody get Revelation there's a stone
[40:05] built that's stone stone in the church
[40:08] not a stone another rock another rock
[40:10] that Peter a rock rock rocks rocks
[40:13] Stones stones in the last days God don't
[40:15] picking up Stones devil can't shake them
[40:18] Stones devil can't move those stones you
[40:20] are Stone you are rock come on say Amen
[40:23] somebody Hallelujah Give the Lord a
[40:25] shout of praise
[40:27] that's why the devil don't understand
[40:28] you fall down you get back up why you're
[40:31] rock hallelujah bounce your head you
[40:33] shake your head you get back up because
[40:35] you are rough you stumble but you get
[40:37] back up because you are
[40:41] rough the devil want to sing like wheat

[40:47] of
[40:48] Praise oh hallelujah hallelujah
[40:51] hallelujah sit down a minute oh
[40:55] Hallelujah so therefore Peter said what
[40:58] the Christ is not right and Jesus said
[41:00] Upon This Rock of what was revealed I
[41:03] will build my church and the gates of
[41:05] hell so we don't have to try to pump it
[41:07] into people like I hear a minister say
[41:09] I'm I'm going to reveal it and I say wow
[41:11] he could I thought the Holy Ghost alone
[41:13] is a revealer so see I can't reveal
[41:14] anything I could preach it but the Holy
[41:17] Spirit have to reveal it now if I preach
[41:19] my dream I had last night I preach some
[41:21] kind of thing that I had then you know I
[41:23] don't know how you can that but going to
[41:25] preach your word the spirit that spoke
[41:27] the word could reveal the word to
[41:32] you Hallelujah so so so therefore we
[41:35] ought not to be afraid to speak the word
[41:38] because power is in the word he not life
[41:40] is in the word revelation is in the word
[41:43] that's why the devil job is to keep you
[41:45] away from the word that's why the bride
[41:47] will not be deceived you know why
[41:48] because she will be the
[41:51] word come on I caught you on that one I
[41:54] caught you on that one the bride
[41:56] wouldn't be a church member the bride
[41:57] will be the word itself that's why the

[53:21] a further Revelation was supposed to
[53:23] come as to how right she didn't wait and
[53:27] then of course the devil bring break his
[53:28] seals and reveal to her what to do and
[53:31] then with his book of wisdom she got
[53:33] messed up and we fell but God had to
[53:35] break his seals now to this second Eve
[53:38] to reveal what to do and when to do so
[53:40] he said he said he said no man can make
[53:42] her do otherwise right she have D say

[54:38] picture Flesh and Blood Fades out the
[54:40] picture Minister Fade Out the picture
[54:42] because you're looking to see Jesus
[54:44] you're looking to see Christ come on the
[54:46] page of the bible let me go quickly now
[54:48] listen to this Vision hallelu God open
[54:50] up to the prophet the rain falls on the
[54:52] just and the unjust that's what the
[54:55] Bible say said and now notice a vision
[54:58] he said now the wheat and the weeds live
[55:00] by the same anointing from Heaven both
[55:02] of them Rejoice over it wow I remember
[55:04] this referring back to this instance up
[55:07] there that day at Green Mill I seen a
[55:09] vision come up and there was a great
[55:11] Earth had been diced up and there went
[55:14] to saw first I went I want to keep that
[55:17] before you watch What Goes Forth first
[55:19] and what follows it and as this man in
[55:22] white came forth around the earth sewing
[55:24] seed behind him came a man dark clothes
[55:27] on looking sneaking slipping along
[55:29] beside him sewing seeds weeds and as
[55:31] this was taking place I seen boat crops
[55:33] come up and as they come up one was
[55:35] wheat and one was weed and there come a
[55:39] drought oh
[55:41] Hallelujah that that is what is on right
[55:45] now a drought watch this they come a
[55:49] drought and when looked like both of
[55:51] them had their heads down crying for
[55:52] rain and there come a great Cloud over
[55:54] the Earth and it rained
[55:57] there is no doubt Dynamics is coming
[55:59] there is no doubt the cloud is coming
[56:02] may I inject here how that cloud going
[56:03] to come because seven Thunders unlock
[56:06] the heavens when you speak it by
[56:08] Revelation so therefore the seven
[56:10] Thunders going to have to unlock the
[56:11] heavens and then rain going to fall in
[56:14] other words it'll be spoken by
[56:15] Revelation and unlock the heaven that
[56:17] had been shut by William brandham 7 se7
[56:20] under the prophecy he actually shut the
[56:22] heavens because he going to have too
[56:24] much unrighteous partaking of the Holy
[56:25] Ghost if rain fall upon uncont contrary
[56:28] seeds so you have to make sure your
[56:30] seeds of God the elect is called out
[56:33] make sure the elect of God is pregnant
[56:35] with Christ the person of the Holy Ghost
[56:38] because out of your seed Will Comfort
[56:41] the person of God oh give the Lord
[56:44] Praises do do you see that
[56:48] now so watch drought came up both of
[56:51] them had their heads down crying for
[56:52] rain there come a great Cloud over the
[56:54] Earth it rain and the re raised up and
[56:55] said praise the Lord praise the Lord and
[56:57] the weed raise up B praise the Lord
[56:58] praise the Lord same results both of
[56:59] them perishing both of them going away
[57:01] then the wheat comes up and get thirsty
[57:03] because it was in the same field same
[57:05] Garden same place under the same Sprout
[57:08] here come the wheat and the tears the
[57:09] very same thing the same anointing
[57:11] Waters bring forth the wheat and the
[57:12] seed yes but AB Bram said her ripeness
[57:15] the bride the true bride will mature and
[57:17] her ripeness hear this shall be her
[57:19] identification with the Lord by means of
[57:21] the word and her head who will come to
[57:24] her is the mystery of godliness now you
[57:26] said notice it didn't say false Jesus
[57:29] false Christ watch it's false teachers
[57:31] of it false prophets of it false
[57:34] teachers false anointed false Christ
[57:37] false teachers that's the only way you
[57:39] can see it so when they say false Christ
[57:42] and I'll go down I I'll summarize I
[57:43] don't want to read all too much he say
[57:45] it's not the prophecy that is false it's
[57:48] the teachings that is false the prophecy
[57:51] spirit-given prophecy coming to pass but
[57:53] the teachings that is false Now list
[57:56] this oh my so therefore the Dynamics is
[58:01] going to fall to produce the Glorious
[58:03] baptism of the Holy Spirit isn't that
[58:05] right when the Dynamics fall that is
[58:08] where the war going to begin that is
[58:11] where the battle is going to begin so
[58:13] right now we just warming up hallelujah
[58:17] praise God but the battle is about to
[58:19] start when the dynamic strike because
[58:21] when the Dynamics Strike It Strike the
[58:23] wheat and the weeds amen it's like the
[58:27] true and the false both are waiting for
[58:30] the Dynamics Hal the Lord a shout of
[58:33] Praise this exaltation right now is an
[58:36] appeal to prophecy amen that I was
[58:38] inspired with to see am by the grace of
[58:41] God to see what is going to come to pass
[58:43] to see what's along the way isn't that
[58:45] right so therefore when the battle is
[58:47] about to start and therefore Satan will
[58:50] try to come with deception and whatnot
[58:52] and when that can't work when he misses
[58:53] the bride cu the bride will be taken up
[58:55] into the Raptor when he misses the bride
[58:57] Revelation 12 he make war with the
[58:59] remnant of the foolish virgins isn't
[59:02] that right 3 and a half year tribulation
[59:04] so you don't want to be in that he'll be
[59:05] going like a roaring line to take them
[59:06] over so brother Bram said that the force
[59:08] anointed they come afterwards to pervert
[59:11] the original word what we need in our
[59:14] churches is a man that's got an absolute
[59:18] what we need in the Methodist Church the
[59:19] Baptist Church the Pentecostal church
[59:21] the presan church is an absolute a man
[59:23] of God that will stand time to the word
[59:26] and to Christ here we go and bring that
[59:29] congregation under the condition of
[59:32] where each member walks in the condition
[59:35] of this word and see that word
[59:39] manifested oh Hallelujah in know way to
[59:41] stay with it am stay with the vision
[59:44] stay with the purpose that the message
[59:46] come for all what we are doing for this
[59:48] year is to bring us the Dynamics if we
[59:50] don't get the Dynamics we are failed but
[59:53] we have to come to our promise Hall
[59:56] hallelujah praise God praise God
[59:59] everything else is a
[1:00:03] distraction Hallelujah brother say we
[1:00:05] build bigger seminaries bigger churches
[1:00:07] better pews bigger organ better dressed
[1:00:09] crowd and what we have denominational
[1:00:11] death he said if I die in my tracks my
[1:00:14] absolute is Jesus Christ I'll be
[1:00:16] somebody say he'll preach the post he
[1:00:17] said I'll be preaching to God's word to
[1:00:18] the post then because able to raise up
[1:00:20] stones to Abraham here we go I'm almost
[1:00:23] closed this is good now watch the truth
[1:00:26] Vine the false Vine same anointing water
[1:00:27] fell upon them it will SE very like if
[1:00:29] it's possible notice man does not gather
[1:00:32] grapes off a tisle even though the t is
[1:00:34] right in the Great Vine what is the
[1:00:36] fruit the fruit will tell it what is the
[1:00:38] fruit the word for the fruit of the
[1:00:41] Season what is it their teaching the
[1:00:43] teaching of what the teaching of the
[1:00:44] Season man's Doctrine denominational
[1:00:47] Doctrine amen so what will make the
[1:00:49] difference between the true anointed and
[1:00:51] false anointed not the prophecy not the
[1:00:52] signs not the Wonders not the Miracles
[1:00:54] so those people that up on that the
[1:00:57] first sign and say wo that's God is that
[1:00:59] right what the man
[1:01:01] teaching see bam Anointed with the same
[1:01:04] spirit that was upon Moses what was the
[1:01:06] difference the teaching of Moses was
[1:01:08] perfect the now the teaching of bam not
[1:01:12] the prophecy oh praise the name of the
[1:01:14] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:01:17] here's the shocking here's the shocking
[1:01:18] part listen to this as John and J Moses
[1:01:21] so these men resist the truth men of
[1:01:23] corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the
[1:01:25] Fate that that was one delivered to the
[1:01:26] Saints of course concerning the faith
[1:01:28] and he shall turn the faith of the
[1:01:29] fathers to the children back to the
[1:01:31] fathers reprobate concerning the faith
[1:01:33] he said now what he said if you want to
[1:01:35] go into the scoffield it say apostasy
[1:01:37] here and then brother Bram quote the
[1:01:39] scripture uh shall not God avenge his
[1:01:42] elect which Cent him day and night I
[1:01:43] tell you he will avenge them speedly
[1:01:45] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:01:48] shall he find faith on the earth it's
[1:01:51] unbelievable to think Jesus will ask
[1:01:53] that question after the son of man come
[1:01:55] to reveal himself to bring back the
[1:01:56] faith but it was so bad he said when the
[1:01:59] son of man cometh shall he find the
[1:02:01] faith that was revealed shall he find
[1:02:03] that on the earth Well church you have
[1:02:05] to answer that you have to say that F
[1:02:07] going to be in me he going to find it in
[1:02:09] Me Oh Glory Hallelujah I'm going to
[1:02:12] close with this now the question here is
[1:02:14] where I wanted to go to in Revelation 10
[1:02:17] we'll get to a few minutes in the days
[1:02:19] of the message of the seven Angel the
[1:02:20] mission go ought to be finished here's
[1:02:22] the question if you following that line
[1:02:24] in this s will it be finished
[1:02:26] will I find the faith will Malachi 4 be
[1:02:29] fulfilled at this time restore the faith
[1:02:31] back to the fathers oh blessed be the
[1:02:33] name of the Lord I'm finish this morning
[1:02:34] so I want to challenge you to get down
[1:02:36] into the word because we have a rare
[1:02:38] rough time come up ahead and I won't be
[1:02:40] able to tell you at that time because
[1:02:42] that time is too late to change you
[1:02:44] can't change the seed amen praise God so
[1:02:47] I wonder if right now that is going
[1:02:50] forth false teaching true teaching all
[1:02:52] kind of teachings going forth and rain
[1:02:53] looking to fall on it and and those that
[1:02:56] have taught the true teachings of this
[1:02:58] virtue coming inside of you when the
[1:03:00] rainf a rainbow a rainbow going to come
[1:03:02] out of you the life of God going to flow
[1:03:04] to you you're going to add to your
[1:03:06] virtue knowledge and Temperance and
[1:03:08] patience a glorious baptism of the are
[1:03:10] you looking for it a lot of people not
[1:03:13] looking for the you have to be looking
[1:03:14] for ital you're looking for your promise
[1:03:17] you're looking for your inheritance
[1:03:19] right now Ukraine don't know what Russia
[1:03:21] going to do Russia playing games and
[1:03:24] everybody playing the games and whatnot
[1:03:26] and but but we know what God promised
[1:03:28] he's going to do and we have a right to
[1:03:30] say God you promis you can't lie you got
[1:03:34] to bring your promise to pass I told in
[1:03:36] Africa you have to say God you are
[1:03:38] guilty until you bring your promise to
[1:03:40] pass so can we give the Lord a shout a

[1:21:01] church he want a church that he could be
[1:21:04] proud
[1:21:05] of we have 40 plus years in this
[1:21:09] message ought not to be one question on
[1:21:12] the
[1:21:14] word there ought to be not one
[1:21:18] question or in
[1:21:20] teaching because God a
[1:21:23] prophet the prophet have dust sayth the
[1:21:27] Lord a prophet don't have his own
[1:21:30] opinion a prophet speaks do say the
[1:21:34] Lord so what we
[1:21:37] have is the plum
[1:21:39] line what we have is the measuring
[1:21:44] Rod the word from the
[1:21:47] prophet of
[1:21:48] Malachi you will be seated but you know
[1:21:52] what like in Africa
[1:21:55] unlike in some third world
[1:21:58] governments the leaders take so
[1:22:02] long that they believe after a
[1:22:05] while that they own the
[1:22:08] country they own the
[1:22:11] people people stay so long in church
[1:22:16] systems that they
[1:22:18] believe they belong to some
[1:22:21] man or some church but in real
[1:22:25] reality you supposed to be the wife of
[1:22:27] the
[1:22:29] Lamb you supposed to be the
[1:22:34] bride just one more I want to say before
[1:22:36] I read the
[1:22:37] scriptures Bram he talk about those
[1:22:42] directors those
[1:22:45] conductors he spoke about the
[1:22:48] symphony and in the
[1:22:50] symphony
[1:22:51] violin trets trp
[1:22:55] BS
[1:22:56] clarinet and everybody can play their
[1:23:00] instrument but there is one man that
[1:23:02] stands on a
[1:23:04] platform with a little
[1:23:06] stick and he's the one that gives the
[1:23:10] little
[1:23:12] hint he
[1:23:15] doing now he is reading from a
[1:23:19] sheet to read the
[1:23:21] music each man
[1:23:24] in that
[1:23:25] Symphony have to be able to
[1:23:29] read the part that they have to
[1:23:32] play
[1:23:34] everyone can't play the same
[1:23:37] thing the man with the
[1:23:39] drum he has to wait to get the
[1:23:43] signal H that
[1:23:45] drum the man with the
[1:23:48] symbols he has to wait until the
[1:23:52] director until the conductor
[1:23:55] he is in the spirit of the
[1:23:59] composer is the great
[1:24:03] composer composed the music
[1:24:06] sheet and sent William
[1:24:08] pram to reveal the Sheep
[1:24:11] music and the fful
[1:24:14] ministry is the
[1:24:16] play as it is
[1:24:18] written they supposed to
[1:24:21] read the same sheet music
[1:24:24] and conduct the
[1:24:26] group conduct it well now if there's an
[1:24:31] interpretation that
[1:24:33] paper it will not come out
[1:24:36] right if there's a wrong
[1:24:39] signal it will not come out
[1:24:42] right so the prophet says the
[1:24:46] conductor must be in the same
[1:24:48] Spirit of the
[1:24:50] composer in other words you have to have
[1:24:53] the
[1:24:55] which is the mind of Christ which is the
[1:24:58] voice of the Archangel to reveal the and
[1:25:02] time of your living him give the Lord a
[1:25:04] shout of
[1:25:09] Praise I want to turn your
[1:25:13] Bibles to Revelation chapter

[1:25:48] morning praise the Lord I want to read
[1:25:52] from 1 to 6 I saw another might Angel

[1:25:56] rainbow upon his head his face was with
[1:25:59] a sun his feet is still as a fire he has
[1:26:02] in his hand little book open he set his
[1:26:05] right foot upon the sea his left foot on
[1:26:07] the earth cry with a loud voice when a
[1:26:09] lion roar it when he had cried seven
[1:26:11] tunders uttered the voices when the
[1:26:14] seven tunders had uttered the voices are
[1:26:16] about to write I Heard a Voice of Heaven
[1:26:18] saying unto me seal up those things
[1:26:21] which your seven Thunders uttered and
[1:26:22] might them not and the angel which I saw
[1:26:24] stand upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:26:26] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[1:26:29] by him that live forever and ever who
[1:26:31] created heaven and the things that
[1:26:32] therein are and the earth and the things
[1:26:35] that are therein are and the Sea and the
[1:26:38] things which are therein that there
[1:26:40] should be time no longer Revelation chap
[1:26:45] 22y reading verse 16 and 17 Jesus have
[1:26:49] sent my angel to testify unto you these
[1:26:51] things in the churches I am the root of
[1:26:54] and The Offspring of David the bright
[1:26:56] and morning star and the spirit and the
[1:26:58] bright say come let him that hear say
[1:27:00] come let him that is the thir come and
[1:27:03] whosoever will let him take the Water of
[1:27:05] Life freely let's pray father we thank
[1:27:07] you for your scriptures
[1:27:09] Lord and we pray that you would come
[1:27:11] down Among Us and interpret the word to
[1:27:14] our hearts in Jesus name I ask it amen
[1:27:18] and amen you may be seated praise God
[1:27:22] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:27:24] I have a title
[1:27:26] tonight and I took the title from
[1:27:29] Revelation 10
[1:27:31] verse6 time no
[1:27:35] longer this is when time Runs
[1:27:38] Out time no
[1:27:41] longer I have an
[1:27:44] inspiration and I'm taking that from
[1:27:46] Revelation
[1:27:48] 112 first part that says I turn to see
[1:27:52] the voice that spake with me
[1:27:55] and being turned I saw seven golden
[1:27:59] candlesticks and I want to take from
[1:28:02] there turning to see The
[1:28:06] Voice name of the
[1:28:08] Lord hallelujah praise God so I
[1:28:13] believe that the seed in you and
[1:28:16] I is
[1:28:18] right and I
[1:28:20] believe that the
[1:28:22] dynamic is about to pour
[1:28:25] out upon those who have kept the
[1:28:28] faith isn't that right I believe that
[1:28:33] there is to be a
[1:28:35] power that is released to the
[1:28:38] bride to produce
[1:28:41] birth power for
[1:28:43] service not adoption
[1:28:46] yet but power for
[1:28:49] service in that power for
[1:28:51] service you will have signs
[1:28:54] you will have wonders you will have
[1:28:57] Miracles but not adoption yet you still
[1:29:01] have to be
[1:29:02] tested you still have to be tried you
[1:29:05] still have to climb the
[1:29:07] mountain because the Bible said he came
[1:29:10] onto his own and his own receive him not
[1:29:14] but as many as receive him to them he
[1:29:18] gave power to become the sons of God so
[1:29:23] this is that instance
[1:29:25] Sons this is growing in
[1:29:28] God or adding the life to get to the top
[1:29:32] of the
[1:29:34] pyramid in other words a power has to
[1:29:39] come that we could be
[1:29:41] formed into the word image and be
[1:29:45] adopted and positionally
[1:29:48] placed in the Kingdom of God in other
[1:29:52] words as Jesus
[1:29:54] was the revelation of God you and I
[1:29:58] becomes the revelation of Jesus
[1:30:00] Christ so our very life reveals Jesus
[1:30:06] Christ oh blessed be the name of the
[1:30:09] Lord and what shall I do with Jesus
[1:30:11] called the Christ listen to him he said
[1:30:15] watch now
[1:30:18] watch let me say this I say this with
[1:30:22] reverence and respect
[1:30:25] I believe that the bride of Christ is
[1:30:28] called I believe she is sealed in the
[1:30:31] kingdom of
[1:30:32] God that's a prophet going in the
[1:30:37] future present tense he already see you
[1:30:41] sealed he already see you
[1:30:43] sealed so stop
[1:30:46] wondering you want to be
[1:30:49] sealed you got to be
[1:30:52] sealed Hallelujah hallelujah oh praise
[1:30:55] the name of the Lord Brother I believe
[1:30:59] the mechanics is there they are waiting
[1:31:02] for the
[1:31:04] Dynamics let me drop this
[1:31:06] bomb from the
[1:31:08] prophet he is the
[1:31:11] Dynamics who is the
[1:31:14] Dynamics he is the
[1:31:16] Dynamics that he somewhere Europe no
[1:31:20] America no South America Africa know he
[1:31:25] is the
[1:31:26] dynamic come on now come on now that's
[1:31:30] why you have to
[1:31:31] sign that's why you have to cry because
[1:31:34] you want the
[1:31:35] Dynamics and the angel put a
[1:31:38] mark upon those that
[1:31:40] sigh upon those that
[1:31:43] cry sit down a minute let's get down
[1:31:46] into the
[1:31:47] word when God said my people start S
[1:31:52] Jour in a strange
[1:31:56] land
[1:31:57] years and after those years with a
[1:32:01] mighty
[1:32:02] hand I'm going to bring them out I'm
[1:32:05] going to brought this
[1:32:07] out was a real powerful
[1:32:11] thing even though God said I will bring
[1:32:15] them
[1:32:16] out when those years came
[1:32:19] up the people had to
[1:32:22] cry after 400
[1:32:25] years God put a
[1:32:28] thirst in the
[1:32:30] people yeah hold it hold it hold it you
[1:32:33] see many of times we are waiting on God
[1:32:38] but what you don't understand God
[1:32:41] waiting on
[1:32:47] you oh sit down a minute I say your sit
[1:32:51] down a minute I say said this
[1:32:54] if you could only get
[1:32:57] started God will do the
[1:33:00] rest but BR he took a rock he threw it
[1:33:04] up in the air and it started from a
[1:33:07] whirlwind and God through the
[1:33:10] Whirlwind said you have to do something
[1:33:14] for something to happen therefore the
[1:33:17] Dynamics will be a
[1:33:22] reaction come on now
[1:33:24] if we could only get
[1:33:26] started God will do the
[1:33:28] rest God brings the
[1:33:32] test to see our
[1:33:35] attitude and our action towards what he
[1:33:39] promised because God can't lie if God
[1:33:44] said the seven tunders it's the bright
[1:33:47] Revival and there have been no
[1:33:49] manifestation of God to the bride yet
[1:33:54] but he will sell it he promis it if you
[1:33:58] see it then you supposed to ask for
[1:34:06] it sit down a minute let's get on into
[1:34:09] the word
[1:34:12] 1906 just around the Pentecostal the
[1:34:15] start of the Pentecostal
[1:34:17] Revival
[1:34:19] 1906 a half blind
[1:34:24] man Reverend
[1:34:27] sour he was reading the
[1:34:29] scriptures down in a
[1:34:32] bment and he saw where God promised the
[1:34:37] spirit and he began to have prayer
[1:34:40] meeting asking God to bring his promise
[1:34:44] to
[1:34:45] pass and when he created the
[1:34:49] atmosphere you heard that
[1:34:51] word atmosphere atmosphere he created
[1:34:55] the atmosphere atere then the Holy Ghost
[1:34:59] pour out and that
[1:35:01] started the Pentecostal
[1:35:04] Revival Luther had mechanics and
[1:35:07] Dynamics Wesley mechanic Dynamics what
[1:35:11] about you and I when are we going to get
[1:35:14] up from all this
[1:35:17] intellectual knowled Stu and begin to
[1:35:21] say where is the Lord God of Elijah
[1:35:26] when are we going to say where is the
[1:35:28] lord
[1:35:30] El Hallelujah HJ hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:34] you may be seated let's make it B Point

[1:35:48] himself if I get that Rob I'm going to
[1:35:51] get everything
[1:35:57] G
[1:36:02] cross ask what you will he said I want a
[1:36:07] double portion that's what I want Elijah
[1:36:10] said if you see me go you could have it
[1:36:15] so you had to keep focused he can't be
[1:36:17] reading
[1:36:18] newspapers he can't be looking at
[1:36:20] magazines he can't be looking at
[1:36:22] movies going alignment here and sitting
[1:36:25] down here no you got to be focused
[1:36:28] because Elijah said you have to see me
[1:36:32] keep watching now because you don't know
[1:36:34] when I'm going to go but if you see me
[1:36:36] go you can get what is Promised Give the
[1:36:40] Lord some Praises people now watch he
[1:36:44] saw him go he dropped down the
[1:36:47] mantle and Elijah put on the mantle

[1:36:57] I'm but
[1:36:58] I I Ain feeling no
[1:37:01] power and I have the mant of

[1:37:25] El and when he cried out that anointing
[1:37:28] struck
[1:37:30] him Hallelujah so you can't sit there

[2:12:16] voice you could only hear a
[2:12:18] voice you can't see a voice
[2:12:22] but a voice is a person so when you hear
[2:12:25] a voice behind the voice is a person and
[2:12:30] God's voice was split up to Seven Ages
[2:12:36] God's
[2:12:38] voice unfold to Seven

[2:13:30] tonight God got to have witnesses on the
[2:13:33] earth when turned it was no longer
[2:13:38] seven it was one Lord one fa glory to
[2:13:43] God same
[2:13:44] Jesus when the picture was
[2:13:47] turned you only see Jesus
[2:13:53] it's not about the
[2:13:55] ministers it's about Jesus and his
[2:13:59] PR for
[2:14:01] Ministry is for the perfecting of
[2:14:04] you work for you toy you to build
[2:14:10] you

[2:14:22] name goes on that
[2:14:24] book then changes
[2:14:27] words or the last name that's
[2:14:33] redeemed that was put on the
[2:14:36] book watch he comes to claim what he
[2:14:41] redeemed it might be a strange
[2:14:44] time watch have we waited too
[2:14:48] long is there many out there that will
[2:14:51] never come
[2:14:53] in has the last name been
[2:14:57] redeemed it could be you
[2:14:59] know it could easily
[2:15:02] be and never interrupt the
[2:15:05] scriptures we don't
[2:15:07] know so be
[2:15:10] careful when these
[2:15:12] Thunders let me read back it's Thursday
[2:15:16] time from the mighty
[2:15:18] angel that time was finished
[2:15:22] and when these
[2:15:23] Thunders brought forth their
[2:15:26] voices think of it an
[2:15:30] angel with a cloud rainbow over his
[2:15:34] head you know who that is swore by
[2:15:38] himself seven ters after the
[2:15:40] voices that time would be no
[2:15:44] more hallelujah hallelujah then if time
[2:15:47] has run
[2:15:48] out it's later than you think
[2:15:54] 1962 says if time has run
[2:15:57] out it's later than we
[2:16:00] think
[2:16:02] said God told him your message will wind
[2:16:06] up the Loose
[2:16:08] Ends I will introduce the
[2:16:11] Messiah but this Angel brings the next
[2:16:15] announcement so in other words for the
[2:16:19] ministry El
[2:16:22] a son of man was the tie of the loose
[2:16:28] end but he was introduced
[2:16:31] Christ the seventh
[2:16:34] seal that is what is here
[2:16:37] tonight the mighty Angel the one with
[2:16:40] hisat
[2:16:41] wings he is with his
[2:16:44] people glory to God so the next Angel
[2:16:48] The Mighty Angel brought the next
[2:16:52] announcement he said might be closer
[2:16:53] than you
[2:16:54] think it has got me
[2:16:58] scared shall be no more he
[2:17:01] announces the time is over seriously
[2:17:05] think if it is then the pyramid is kept
[2:17:10] by the seven Thunders is this the
[2:17:12] mystery of the Thunders to bring back
[2:17:15] The Headstone headone to come upon the
[2:17:18] bra to fulfill
[2:17:22] Revelation the bride have to meet with
[2:17:26] her
[2:17:27] husband bride has to become wife his
[2:17:30] wife has made ready the bride has to get
[2:17:34] an experience connection the
[2:17:37] supernatural seven perfect Spirits from
[2:17:40] the back side of the book baptizing you

[2:18:08] closing with this brother says and the
[2:18:11] reason that the church is in the
[2:18:14] condition is in because there are so
[2:18:17] many
[2:18:18] voices to attract the church
[2:18:21] away from the voice of God the voice of
[2:18:25] the
[2:18:26] supernatural there are so many
[2:18:28] intellectual
[2:18:30] voices great
[2:18:32] voices mighty men who are
[2:18:35] intellectual and in their intellectual
[2:18:38] condition they shake the
[2:18:41] Nations and cause the voice of
[2:18:44] God to be placed way back somewhere to
[2:18:47] be placed way back somewhere

[2:33:40] seated for a few announcements this
[2:33:43] morning my is such an anointing here
[2:33:46] this
[2:33:47] morning you know I said to the young
[2:33:49] people yesterday say I I saw a quote
[2:33:51] earlier this week that there are only
[2:33:54] two very important days in your life the
[2:33:57] first is the day that you are born and
[2:33:59] the second is the day you find out why
[2:34:01] you were born and I believe that we're
[2:34:03] in a season where the bride is finding
[2:34:05] out why she was born because but brandom
[2:34:08] said the moment you realize who you are
[2:34:10] then the Raptor is going to go so I
[2:34:12] believe somebody is coming is waking up
[2:34:15] to the realization that you are born for
