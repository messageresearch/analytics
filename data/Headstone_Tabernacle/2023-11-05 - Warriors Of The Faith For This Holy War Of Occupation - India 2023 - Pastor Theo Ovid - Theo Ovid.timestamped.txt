[46:25] Lord
[46:26] okay so I have a few words I like to
[46:28] share with you before we put that tape
[46:29] on um so this Israel hamus war started
[46:33] October 7th hamus launched a surprise
[46:36] attack on Israel killing hundreds of
[46:38] civilians taking more than 200 hostages
[46:41] Israel responded with air strikes gr
[46:43] operations to stop the rocket fire and
[46:45] rescue the
[46:48] captives so this is what's going on
[46:51] right now and um Hamas had was the
[46:53] rulers of the of the of the Palestinian
[46:55] people but they are like enemies of
[46:58] Israel okay so um you know I was
[47:02] concerned with because they have over I
[47:04] think 500 miles of underground tunnels
[47:08] that they dug to go here there
[47:09] everywhere and whatnot so I was always
[47:11] thinking about it going take a lot of
[47:13] Courage for Israel to go into these
[47:15] tunnels but you know what actually
[47:16] working opposite it working opposite
[47:19] that Hamas being trapped within the
[47:21] tunnels and Israel actually the blasting
[47:24] away their way of Escape
[47:26] that's just I'm going to just share this
[47:28] with you so the Vatican which I know
[47:30] Rome have to come and stick the head
[47:32] inside here the Vatican said it is ready
[47:34] to mediate between Hamas and Israel so I
[47:37] always wonder how on Earth Rome going to
[47:39] get into this thing you know because
[47:41] Rome going to make a covenant with
[47:42] Israel all that is part of Bible
[47:43] prophecy but here it here here we go the
[47:46] Vatican said it was ready to Med mediate
[47:48] D hamus and Israel to prevent further
[47:50] violence and facilitate the return of
[47:52] hostages held by hammers Cardinal p
[47:55] Carolin the Vatican Secretary of State
[47:58] told Vatican media on Friday that the
[48:00] attacks on Israel by Hamas were inhuman
[48:02] and he echoed pop Francis call for the
[48:04] freeing of Israeli hostages held by the
[48:07] militant group so I just skipping
[48:09] through I just going to skip that
[48:10] through right okay so now
[48:14] um have a sort of title for what I'm
[48:17] going to say here this morning the
[48:19] Battle of Psalms
[48:20] 83 um not going to just get here going
[48:23] to get to it here I just want to read
[48:24] from Judges chapter 4 and I want to read
[48:27] the scripture here J chapter 4 and if
[48:30] you want to turn your Bibles you turn it
[48:33] and and this Psalms 83 thank god brother
[48:37] Andrew Lan he keep telling me about this
[48:39] Psalms read this time he read it read it
[48:41] read it and I finally got chance to read
[48:43] it I said I see what you seeing so I
[48:45] really appreciate but Andre Lan for
[48:46] sharing that ssal with me Psalms 83 and
[48:48] we'll get to it just in a while but
[48:49] Judges chapter 4 and the children of
[48:51] Israel did again did evil in the sight
[48:54] of the lord lord when Ood was dead
[48:56] they're always doing this evil thing you
[48:58] know after God speaks to them and the
[49:01] Lord told
[49:02] them watch these words now they did Evil
[49:06] and look what happened in verse two and
[49:08] the Lord sold them into the hand of
[49:11] jabin king of Canaan that reign in heor
[49:14] the captain of whose host was Cera
[49:18] that's the name of the captain Cera
[49:19] which dwelt in hares of the Gentiles and
[49:22] the children of Israel Cried unto the
[49:23] Lord watch this now ver one evil verse
[49:26] three they Cried unto the Lord for he
[49:29] had nine this Cera had 900 Chariots of
[49:33] iron and 20 years he mightily oppressed
[49:36] oh this is jabin he mightily oppressed
[49:38] the children of Israel so after sinning
[49:41] after doing evil they take a 20e
[49:43] sentence under jabin verse four and
[49:46] debor a prophetess the wife of labido
[49:50] she judged Israel at that time and she
[49:52] dwelt under the palm tree of De Bor
[49:54] between Rama and and beel in Mount
[49:56] Ephraim and the children of Israel came
[49:58] up to her a judgment the prophet debor
[50:01] verse six and she sent and called Barack
[50:04] the son of abinoam out of Kadesh naftali
[50:08] and said unto him had not the Lord God
[50:10] of Israel commanded saying go and draw
[50:13] towards Mount Amar and take with thee
[50:15] 10,000 men of the train of napali and of
[50:17] the train of Zebulon and I will draw
[50:19] onto thee to the river of Kishon Cera
[50:22] this is God telling them now I will draw
[50:24] this captain that abin has to the river
[50:27] Kon Cera the captain of jabin's army
[50:30] with his chariots and with his multitude
[50:33] and I will deliver them into thine hand
[50:36] this is when God speaks God say I'll
[50:38] deliver that enemy into your hand and
[50:41] Barack said unto her if thou will go
[50:42] with me then I will go whether thou will
[50:44] not go with me I will not go she said I
[50:47] will surely go with thee not
[50:49] withstanding the journey that thou
[50:51] takest shall not be for thine honor yeah
[50:53] he this not
[50:56] withstanding the journey that thou

[51:06] of a woman that's prophecy the Bor
[51:10] prophesying unto him and de Borah Rose
[51:13] and went with Barack to
[51:15] kades and Barack called Zebulon and
[51:18] naali to kades and he went up with
[51:19] 10,000 men at his feet and debor went up
[51:22] with him now hea the kenite which are
[51:25] the children of hobab the father-in-law
[51:28] of Moses had severed himself from the
[51:30] kenites and Pitch his tent into the
[51:32] plain of zanim which is by Kadesh and
[51:35] they showed Cera that Barack the son of
[51:40] abin Noam was going up to mount himo and
[51:44] cesera gathered together his chariots so
[51:47] the prophecy already said that God will
[51:49] deliver s to their hands when Sarah here

[53:07] Chariots after the host on haret of the
[53:10] Gentiles and all the host of cesaria
[53:13] fell by the other's sword and there was
[53:15] not a man left how be it cesaria fled
[53:18] away on his feet to the tent of gel the
[53:21] wife of hea the canite for there was no
[53:24] peace between jabing the king of Hannah
[53:26] and the house of hea the kenite and J
[53:29] went out to Mid C and said him turn in
[53:31] my Lord turn in to me fear not and when
[53:35] he had turned into her into the tent she
[53:38] covered him with a mantle and he said
[53:41] unto me give me I pray the a little
[53:43] water to drink for I am thirsty and she
[53:45] open my butter and milk and give him to
[53:46] drink and covered him again he said unto

[53:50] shall be when any man that come and
[53:51] inquire of Theon said is there any man
[53:53] here Thou shalt say no
[53:56] then Gile he's wife took a nail of the
[54:00] tent and took a hammer in her hand and
[54:03] went softly unto him and smoked the nail
[54:05] into his Temple and fasted into the
[54:07] ground for he was fast asleep and weary
[54:09] so he died and behold as Barack pursued
[54:12] cerah jail came out to meet him and said

[54:16] whom thou seekest and when he came unto
[54:18] her tent behold ceria l dead and the
[54:21] nail was in his Temple so God subdued on
[54:25] that day jabbing the king of Canaan
[54:27] before the children of Israel and the
[54:29] Hand of the children of Israel prospered
[54:31] and prevailed against jabin the king of
[54:33] Canaan until they had destroyed jabin
[54:36] king of Canaan remember what debor

[55:13] silence oh God hold not thy peace and be
[55:17] not still oh God for L thine enemies
[55:21] make a tumult and they that hate thee
[55:24] have lifted up the head they have taken
[55:27] crafty counsel against thy people and
[55:30] consulted against thy hidden ones they
[55:32] have said come let us cut them off from
[55:35] being a nation that the name of Israel
[55:38] may be no more in remembrance for they
[55:40] have consulted together with one consent
[55:43] they are Confederate against thee the
[55:47] Tabernacles of Edom and the Israelites
[55:50] of Moab of the Hagar jibal and Ammon and
[55:55] amalec the Philistines with the
[55:57] inhabitants of Ty aser also is joined
[56:00] with them they have Halen the children
[56:02] of lot silah do unto them as unto the
[56:06] midianites as to
[56:08] Cera as to jabin that's why I read
[56:11] judges first because there was some
[56:13] reference to point what God could do you
[56:16] know was just as CER get lick up do unto
[56:19] them like Cera and jabin at the brook of
[56:22] Kishon which perish at Endor they become
[56:24] has D for the Earth make their nobles
[56:27] like Horeb and like Ze y all their
[56:31] princes as a Zeba and a Zuna who said
[56:34] let us take to ourselves the houses of
[56:36] God in possession oh my God make them
[56:39] like a wheel as the stubble for the wind
[56:42] as the fire burneth a wood and as the
[56:44] flame set it in the mountains of fire so
[56:46] persecute them with thy Tempest make
[56:48] them afraid with thy storm fill their
[56:50] face with shame that they may seek thy
[56:53] name oh Lord let them be confounded and
[56:55] trouble forever y let them be put to
[56:58] shame and perish that men may know that
[57:01] thou whose name alone is Jehovah at the
[57:03] most high over the all Earth Jehovah is
[57:06] the most high god oh give the Lord a
[57:09] praise offering and that's the God we
[57:11] serve this morning
[57:13] Hallelujah so then I wanted to find out
[57:16] more about these names because these
[57:18] were not the these are not the mother
[57:19] names now e Edom and Moab and giel and
[57:23] Ammon these Nam here these are the
[57:25] regions in Jordan ishmaelites and
[57:28] hagrites these are the people of Saudi
[57:31] Arabia amalec this is the region of
[57:34] Egypt philistia this is the area of Gaza
[57:37] Palestine Ty this is the city of Lebanon
[57:41] Assyria this is the region that covers
[57:43] parts of Syria and Iraq children of lot
[57:46] these are the descendants of Moab and
[57:48] Ammon scatter in in in in the Middle
[57:51] East oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[57:54] so Psalms 83 tells of a about a 10-
[57:58] member Alliance comprised of Arab
[58:01] territories that mostly share a common
[58:03] border with Israel who would form an
[58:06] alliance and seek to wipe Israel off the
[58:08] map in other words they say Israel have
[58:10] no right to exist and some I feel that
[58:12] way you know people feel we have no
[58:13] right to exist but we are still here we
[58:15] a disappearing anywh time now we we
[58:17] ordained to make the Rapture praise God
[58:20] they say the Israel have no right to
[58:21] exist but they cannot Stamp Out Israel
[58:24] because go his hand upon them 144,000
[58:27] have to be sealed after the bread get
[58:30] sealed oh give the Lord a praise Give
[58:32] the Lord of Praise if there's 144,000
[58:35] Jews to be sealed there's a pride to be
[58:38] sealed that would close of this Gentile
[58:40] dispensation Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[58:44] praise God praise God so these groups
[58:46] are no longer identifiable by their
[58:48] ancient names the modern day equivalent
[58:52] of these nations that will form the
[58:53] alliance that plotting to destroy Israel
[58:56] the tens of Edom the sents of of
[58:59] Esau are we're going again which is
[59:01] Palestinian refugees and Southern
[59:02] jordanians ishmaelites Saudi Arabians
[59:05] Moab Palestinian refugees and Central
[59:07] jordanians hagrites the Egyptians jibal
[59:10] Northern Lebanese Ammon Palestinians
[59:12] refugees and Northern jordanians amalec
[59:15] Arabs south of Israel philistia pales
[59:18] refugees and hammmer of the Gaza
[59:23] Strip so you see we have must connected
[59:25] with the Philistines they're not easy
[59:29] you know but I'm talking about adoption
[59:31] to deep with the Philistines you know
[59:32] these are demons you see Hittites and
[59:34] jeites is one seites but the Philistines
[59:36] are different together them have iron
[59:39] chots they come back and fight you oh
[59:42] Hallelujah you hit the amorites and the
[59:45] Hittites and the jebusites but the
[59:46] Philistines you need power to deal with
[59:48] Philistines not easy you know that the
[59:50] golad
[59:51] family we give the Lord some Praises
[59:54] Hallelujah praise God praise God praise
[59:56] God
[59:58] hallelujah oh glory to God Amen so we

[1:40:45] Jesus after a couple of years with the

[1:40:52] question who do men say I the son of man
[1:40:57] am some say you're

[1:41:08] Peter he said thou are the
[1:41:11] Christ the son of the Living
[1:41:14] God Look what Jesus

[1:42:43] [Music]

[1:43:15] it Jesus he wait for that woman at the
[1:43:19] well
[1:43:22] and he told
[1:43:23] her if you know who's speaking to
[1:43:26] you you ask me for
[1:43:29] water and the water I give

[1:43:37] her go call your
[1:43:40] husband she said I have
[1:43:44] none Jesus said you had five and the one
[1:43:48] you're living with is not your

[1:44:12] her he said I that speak unto
[1:44:17] you it is me it is
[1:44:21] and Jesus freed
[1:44:23] her from the inside
[1:44:26] out and she run into the
[1:44:29] village
[1:44:34] a somebody say another
[1:44:38] man she said

[1:44:42] different is a perfect
[1:44:45] man this is a perfect
[1:44:48] man see a man
[1:44:52] this the
[1:44:53] Christ give him some
[1:44:56] Praises wants you to see him this
[1:44:59] morning want to see him
[1:45:02] today so you have to
[1:45:05] fight for what to possess what you know
[1:45:08] is your
[1:45:09] own so I have this here I wrote this the
[1:45:14] entire Seven
[1:45:15] [Music]
[1:45:17] Seals was to bring us to revelation
[1:45:21] of what belongs to
[1:45:25] us the
[1:45:27] ministers was supposed to show the
[1:45:30] bride her
[1:45:33] promises that she can go on to possess
[1:45:39] them that is what the ministry is
[1:45:42] for not to present
[1:45:46] ourselves but to present the
[1:45:49] promises
[1:45:51] you may be
[1:45:52] seated we find out and we talk about it
[1:45:56] this morning a
[1:45:57] bit you cannot contend for the
[1:46:01] faith without a revelation of
[1:46:04] forgiveness and brotherly
[1:46:08] kindness because you will encounter
[1:46:11] people that Hate
[1:46:15] You Without a
[1:46:18] Cause Joseph
[1:46:20] was
[1:46:22] hated without a
[1:46:24] cause his own Brethren hated
[1:46:28] him because his father gave him a
[1:46:34] coat of many
[1:46:36] colors and Joseph had
[1:46:40] vision and when he shared
[1:46:43] them his brothers got
[1:46:46] jealous now you cannot stop people
[1:46:49] opinion about you
[1:46:53] you have to have a
[1:46:55] revelation of what God called you to
[1:46:59] do stop listening to what others think
[1:47:02] about
[1:47:05] you you have to know who you
[1:47:08] are and who your father
[1:47:11] is you may be
[1:47:13] seated notice they sold
[1:47:17] Joseph to Egypt and they are
[1:47:21] thinking they are getting rid of the
[1:47:25] problem but what they are
[1:47:28] doing is bringing the prophecy to
[1:47:31] pass so when
[1:47:34] Joseph as a young man being driven from
[1:47:38] his
[1:47:39] brothers into a Strange
[1:47:45] Land find his
[1:47:49] position
[1:47:51] because if God give the
[1:47:53] vision it must come to
[1:47:56] pass so after a
[1:47:58] while the brother's
[1:48:01] living brother's
[1:48:04] fellowshipping but Joseph is down in
[1:48:07] Egypt Joseph got
[1:48:10] promotion from cleaning the
[1:48:14] garden to be in charge of for
[1:48:19] house one day po wife got an interest in
[1:48:25] him and Joseph run for his
[1:48:29] life you have to know when to
[1:48:32] fight and you have to know when to
[1:48:38] run Joseph knew to run from that
[1:48:42] woman and when he
[1:48:45] ran he was accused falsely and put into
[1:48:49] prison
[1:48:51] now watch if Joseph did not have a
[1:48:55] revelation he might have think about
[1:48:59] suicide he might think God abandon
[1:49:03] him but he knew Romans
[1:49:06] [Music]
[1:49:09] 8:28 and we
[1:49:10] know that all things work together for
[1:49:17] good to them that love the Lord
[1:49:21] to them who had he called Accord to his
[1:49:25] purpose so even in
[1:49:28] prison God was blessing
[1:49:31] Joseph had a Buckler and a
[1:49:35] baker and he told the
[1:49:38] butler you will be restored into a
[1:49:41] position and he told the baker he will
[1:49:45] die he told the
[1:49:47] butler when you get back in favor with
[1:49:49] the King
[1:49:52] remember
[1:49:53] me be
[1:49:56] grateful be
[1:49:58] thankful show some
[1:50:00] love show some
[1:50:03] appreciation when that
[1:50:06] Butler get delivered and come to the
[1:50:08] presence of the
[1:50:09] king he forget about
[1:50:12] Joseph no remember he's serving the king
[1:50:18] now but all of that was God's
[1:50:21] plan because Joseph wasn't
[1:50:25] ready and God not put
[1:50:29] you in a position of
[1:50:32] power if you are not
[1:50:35] ready you have to be
[1:50:37] ready to be placed into
[1:50:41] Power Give the Lord a praise
[1:50:44] offering the Lord
[1:50:47] shout so watch this when
[1:50:51] God was ready to
[1:50:54] move not man
[1:50:56] moving man controlling
[1:51:00] things when God was getting ready to
[1:51:05] move Pharaoh a
[1:51:08] dream and Pharaoh forgot the
[1:51:12] dream it was a terrible
[1:51:15] dream and he called all the wise
[1:51:18] men and told the wise men
[1:51:21] tell me the
[1:51:22] dream they say what is the dream
[1:51:25] interpret the
[1:51:28] dream say gone from my
[1:51:31] mind all say all wise
[1:51:33] [Music]
[1:51:35] men you better tell me that
[1:51:38] dream if you don't tell me I will cut
[1:51:40] all your head off
[1:51:43] come all you say all you know
[1:51:45] Supernatural things and spiritual
[1:51:48] things so this is when the
[1:51:52] butler remember
[1:51:54] Joseph you see nothing happens by
[1:51:58] chance so the butler tell
[1:52:01] Pharaoh there's a man named
[1:52:04] Joseph who interpreted a
[1:52:07] dream and told me I'll be
[1:52:11] here then Pharaoh says send for
[1:52:15] Joseph and I could see
[1:52:17] Joseph he's in prison
[1:52:21] he's in prison
[1:52:22] clothes and he is coming
[1:52:24] up in prison
[1:52:27] clothes up to
[1:52:30] Pharaoh Joseph looking like a
[1:52:34] nobody and Joseph tell
[1:52:38] Pharaoh the god of
[1:52:40] Heaven to reveal secret
[1:52:44] things and Joseph went and
[1:52:47] prayed and the vision broke upon Joseph
[1:52:51] of seven years of
[1:52:54] plenty seven years of
[1:52:57] famine and Joseph interpreted the dream
[1:53:00] to the
[1:53:02] king and Joseph told the
[1:53:06] king fin a
[1:53:08] man who is wise
[1:53:11] enough govern this whole
[1:53:14] thing and Pharaoh told him go the
[1:53:18] man you are going to rule this
[1:53:22] thing and I am telling
[1:53:25] you there's a fold
[1:53:28] Ministry that God will
[1:53:31] adopt into the
[1:53:34] family and give them a
[1:53:36] power I to shake the
[1:53:39] nation shake the
[1:53:42] nation this world going be
[1:53:44] shaken Once
[1:53:46] More by the voice of God
[1:53:50] and
[1:53:51] Pharaoh had chosen to be the right next
[1:53:54] to
[1:53:56] him watch God work you may be
[1:53:59] seated this is an international Affair
[1:54:03] now God let fam strike
[1:54:07] everywhere famine is
[1:54:10] everywhere but in
[1:54:13] Egypt when there's a
[1:54:15] pyramid when all other bands are empty
[1:54:21] only Joseph B have
[1:54:24] grain so

[2:47:59] God this is the place this is the time
[2:48:01] this is the season if you're looking for
[2:48:03] more of God he is here it has nothing to

[2:48:09] perfect union with you Hallelujah bride

[2:48:16] service continues this evening for the
[2:48:17] Lord's Supper we encourage you to make
[2:48:20] the effort stay in the spirit this
[2:48:24] coming Wednesday there'll be no physical
[2:48:27] service here at the Tabernacle there'll
[2:48:29] be a live stream service only and I
[2:48:31] really want to encourage you Church make
[2:48:33] that sacrifice to carve out that time
[2:48:36] for that service don't do it as
[2:48:38] something you're doing along with
[2:48:39] something else but do it because you're
[2:48:41] in the house of the Lord in that space
[2:48:43] that space that God has carved out for
[2:48:45] you dedicate that to be a time with the
[2:48:48] Lord so you can receive fully from the
[2:48:50] Lord this coming Friday there'll be no
[2:48:52] Zoom prayer meeting but we encourage you
[2:48:54] remember the pastor in prayer as he's
[2:48:56] traveling this weekend to minister in
[2:48:58] the US may God go with him and
[2:49:00] strengthen him and bear him up we are in
[2:49:02] a special time as we know menance group
[2:49:06] five please meet with brother Blackman
[2:49:08] after the service second service and
[2:49:11] next week group four is CED to serve and
[2:49:14] we also made an
[2:49:16] announcement I believe it was a week or
[2:49:18] so ago about our planned church dinner
[2:49:23] which is going to be on December the 9th
[2:49:26] and we just want to speak briefly to
[2:49:30] this that uh we really want an extra
[2:49:34] effort so that everyone can be there and
[2:49:37] we want to be able to have registration
[2:49:39] begin today uh for it so we could
[2:49:43] understand uh what we're looking at and
[2:49:44] we encourage you if you have a burden to
[2:49:47] sponsor someone you are free to do so
[2:49:49] you can let them know at the table if
[2:49:51] you have someone in mind and if you
[2:49:53] don't have someone in mind that you
[2:49:54] would like to sponsor for this then let
[2:49:57] them know at the table and they will be
[2:49:59] able to help assign to someone who may
[2:50:01] have that need uh but we do have uh the
[2:50:05] church dinner on December the 9th and
[2:50:09] the price for adults will be
[2:50:12] $150 um for adults
[2:50:15] for children between the ages of 6 And1
[2:50:19] it'll be $75 and for under five and
[2:50:22] under it'll be free and we do have a
[2:50:25] brief menu uh that we will publish on
[2:50:28] the notice board uh downstairs but I
[2:50:31] could assure you it's a it's a wonderful
[2:50:33] menu that is planned uh but I feel led
[2:50:38] uh to to not read the menu now I think
[2:50:41] this the spiritual food is still is
[2:50:43] still being consumed
[2:50:45] consumed and although we have natural
[2:50:47] food to eat
[2:50:48] afterwards you know there are times when
[2:50:50] you have to lean to the Holy Ghost
[2:50:53] because I believe God is still dealing
[2:50:54] with someone in the sanctuary this
[2:50:56] morning and God is not finished yet and
[2:50:59] we want the Holy Ghost to have his way
[2:51:02] that's the reason we came to church
[2:51:04] that's the reason we came in the house
[2:51:05] of the Lord for him to have his way not
[2:51:07] for us to have our way not even for the
[2:51:10] minister to have his way but for God to
[2:51:12] have his way Lord if you need to break
[2:51:14] me break me you need to change me change
[2:51:16] me you need to shut me up shut me up you
[2:51:18] need to shut me down shut me down
[2:51:19] whatever you need to do because I want
[2:51:21] to be changed I want to be transformed I
[2:51:23] want to be a a worthy soldier of the
[2:51:25] cross a warrior of the faith because
[2:51:27] there's a great occupation there's a
[2:51:29] promised land that I have to take and
[2:51:31] there's a cause because the young people
[2:51:33] need it and the fathers need it and the
[2:51:35] husbands need it and the wives need it
[2:51:37] and the daughters need it and the young
[2:51:38] people needed every inch of ground so we
[2:51:41] could build up this statue of a perfect
[2:51:43] man because one of these days the last
[2:51:45] service will be preached and the last
[2:51:47] song Will Be Sung and whoever is filthy
[2:51:50] is filthy still whoever is righteous is
[2:51:52] righteous still Lord I want to be ready
[2:51:55] I want to be ready I want to be ready so
[2:51:57] may the Lord richly bless you may the
[2:51:59] Lord be with you in your in your lunch
[2:52:01] meals and and in your fellowship and I
[2:52:03] really encourage you to keep practicing
[2:52:06] the presence of
[2:52:07] God keep in the spirit there's so much
[2:52:10] to consume our time during the week but
[2:52:12] if you plug in to the super natural
[2:52:14] through your prayer through reading the
[2:52:16] scripture through reading the prophet's
[2:52:18] message through watching a tape your
[2:52:20] life will be different so may the Lord
[2:52:22] richly bless you brother
