[39:38] hand of the Egyptians and to bring them
[39:40] up out of that land unto a good land and
[39:44] a lodge until land flowing with milk and
[39:47] honey unto the place of the Canaanites
[39:50] and the Hittites and the amorites and
[39:52] the parasites and the hivites and
[39:54] jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry
[39:58] of the children of Israel is come unto
[40:01] me
[40:02] and I have also seen the oppression so
[40:05] not only the cry he saw the oppression
[40:07] he saw the circumstance he saw the
[40:09] challenges he saw the ups and downs he
[40:11] saw everything that was taking place and
[40:13] he says I have also seen the oppression
[40:15] wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them
[40:19] you know may the Lord I had a blessing
[40:20] to the reading of his word you may have
[40:22] your seats
[40:28] amen let's go
[40:32] so for for a simple title
[40:36] the title I've chosen is the Last Cry
[40:40] how is this related to the scripture
[40:42] that we just read you see at the end of
[40:44] the day
[40:45] the children of Israel as we know and we
[40:47] just want to sit there a little bit the
[40:49] children of Israel were in bondage for
[40:50] about 400 years
[40:53] so they weren't in budget for a short
[40:54] time they weren't enslaved for five
[40:57] years or two years or it was a short
[40:58] stint and they they went in and out no
[41:00] it was a period it was generation after
[41:03] generation you would have seen your your
[41:05] father your your grandfather a great
[41:07] grandfather and a few Generations back
[41:09] would have gone through this and reading
[41:11] this scripture we should understand that
[41:13] it wasn't easy it was not walk in the
[41:15] park no type of slavery or oppression
[41:17] would be easy I could only imagine that
[41:20] Israel being the superpower of the time
[41:22] at that time would have put extreme
[41:25] pressure on the children of Israel this
[41:27] was free labor that's just the way it
[41:30] operated they had no say in in when they
[41:33] eat when they drunk when they did this
[41:35] and that outside of I want you to do
[41:37] this that and the other they had to
[41:39] follow instructions follow rules and be
[41:41] highly disciplined because they were
[41:43] oppressed they were enslaved they had to
[41:46] do because that that is what was
[41:48] required at the time however on the
[41:51] backdrop of all this the Lord had made a
[41:54] promise
[41:54] that he wasn't going to leave them that
[41:56] way he understood that they were going
[41:58] through and they were going through for
[42:00] a reason he as we read here he saw the
[42:03] Affliction he knew what was happening to
[42:05] them so it's not strange what's been
[42:07] happening to you he knows he saw the
[42:11] oppression of the task master because
[42:13] they said by reason of the task master
[42:16] he understood by their hand they were
[42:19] oppressed and Afflicted they were hurt
[42:21] they were in pain
[42:23] I hope you could relate to that because
[42:25] sometimes we feel as if we are the only
[42:27] individuals going through this and
[42:30] nobody else understands but here we can
[42:32] clearly see identified in Scripture
[42:35] that the Lord knew
[42:37] the scenario they were in he knew the
[42:40] situation they were in he knew they were
[42:43] going through this and some I could just
[42:45] imagine somebody might have sat down
[42:47] with their child or grandchild and say
[42:49] it wouldn't always be this way you know
[42:50] you know I remember
[42:52] Granddad told me that although this
[42:55] might be our scenario today a day will
[42:59] come when this will not
[43:00] be our present condition where we'll be
[43:03] able to be free and that's the way the
[43:05] Lord operates
[43:07] however
[43:09] and I need to pause here
[43:11] what is interesting about this scripture
[43:13] it's twofold it's almost like a sandwich
[43:15] I call it in verse 7 it talks about your
[43:18] Affliction it talks about the hurts and
[43:20] the pain and what you went through and
[43:22] in verse 9 it does the same they went
[43:24] through and you cried and and you had
[43:26] pressure and you were oppressed and we
[43:28] understand that but in the middle
[43:30] there was a knockout there they say I am
[43:32] come down to deliver so this is where
[43:35] things change
[43:36] I have come down to deliver them out of
[43:39] the hands so so the Egyptians had no
[43:41] right to hold them anymore because I the
[43:44] boss the Lord God Almighty was coming
[43:47] down and with a strong hand was going to
[43:49] bring them out and that's just the way
[43:51] he operates he was going to deliver them
[43:54] out of the hand of the Egyptians so
[43:57] there was no hand that was going to hold
[43:58] on to them anymore there was no bondage
[44:01] there was no supervisor no manager
[44:04] nobody could claim to be in charge and
[44:06] yes they were in this position for 20
[44:08] years so you had to stay there this was
[44:11] a sign of Jubilee this was a sign of
[44:13] them being released from the scenario
[44:16] they were in so perhaps tonight you've
[44:18] been going through the same thing for
[44:19] the last 10 years
[44:20] but tonight that could change because he
[44:24] said I am come down right now present
[44:27] tense to deliver them out to the hands
[44:29] of the Egyptians and to bring them out
[44:32] up out of that land until good land
[44:36] he didn't want to bring them from A to B
[44:38] just to be in the same condition he want
[44:41] to bring you out into a good land into a
[44:43] better land into a better place and he
[44:45] goes on to describe you say a land
[44:48] that is large
[44:50] not small
[44:51] not small you're not going and you're
[44:54] shrinking and you're timing and you're
[44:56] not sure if to step this way or that way
[44:58] it's large you could look to the east
[45:00] west north south you're considers the
[45:02] sunrise and nobody could restrict you
[45:05] you can freely raise your hands and
[45:07] praise nobody could tell you when to
[45:09] shout nobody could tell you when to
[45:11] worship nobody could tell your song into
[45:13] loud or you're disturbing them because
[45:15] he has delivered you out of bondage out
[45:19] of lethargy out of sleeping out of
[45:22] Slumber out of sickness out of pain and
[45:25] oppression and affliction he has raised
[45:28] you up to do something different to do a
[45:31] new thing to do something bigger and
[45:33] better than before so perhaps you may
[45:36] have been accustomed
[45:38] listening perhaps it was a good servant
[45:42] a a a model slave you know when you
[45:45] build homes they have a model home and
[45:47] they tell you come come and see this
[45:48] this is what everything is going to look
[45:50] like this is the model in the workplace
[45:53] when you start to work they often tell
[45:55] you come come come come talk to John
[45:57] o'hary or Gina whoever they say she will
[45:59] show you are wrong she'll show you the
[46:00] roofs often times that's the model they
[46:03] expect you to emulate them and operate
[46:04] like them because then you can fit into
[46:06] the culture and you'll be all right not
[46:08] tonight tonight we are not looking for
[46:10] models the only thing we're modeling is
[46:13] Christ you understand so we're not
[46:15] trying to be like me or the brother next
[46:17] to you or concern about the sister
[46:19] behind you you're trying to be the way
[46:22] God wants you to be because he's put
[46:24] something into you and he's made certain
[46:26] promises to you and he is well able to
[46:30] meet all his promises amen
[46:34] thank you
[46:36] he went on you may have your seats he
[46:39] went on and he said he said unto a land
[46:42] flowing with milk and honey
[46:45] I don't want to go too deep into that
[46:47] but but if you do research you'll
[46:49] realize milk and honey are not for the
[46:51] poor milk and honey are not for slaves
[46:54] milk and honey is something that you
[46:56] work towards and and and you have
[46:58] Ambitions to to be able to to
[47:00] participate in which is why it's a
[47:03] luxury which is why when the 12 Spies
[47:05] went out they brought back grips
[47:08] not not the kind of groups the seller
[47:10] decided he wrote it not the small ones
[47:12] are they important they talk about
[47:13] oversized
[47:15] I said bigger and better
[47:17] different this is not slavery and you
[47:20] take a little end and you know if we
[47:22] have a good time and past you have some
[47:23] extras it's nothing like that this is
[47:26] where you are first you are on top you
[47:29] are in charge you are above you you are
[47:32] a royal priesthood and a holy General
[47:34] listen you're chosen you're a child King
[47:38] can you imagine for a second let me just
[47:41] show you for a second can you imagine
[47:43] you are the child of a king and we know
[47:45] it when we talk about the prodigal son
[47:47] and you realize your father is in charge
[47:50] of everything
[47:51] and you walk in
[47:53] and you see he have silver hands he have
[47:55] a certain operation he have a certain
[47:57] thing where where he have food laid out
[47:59] there's a banquet there's a buffet have
[48:01] you ever gone to all you can eat buffet
[48:03] it's quite interesting that you could go
[48:05] anywhere you could go eat anything any
[48:08] amount nobody could watch and say um
[48:10] you're taking too much chicken you know
[48:12] Hey listen there are other people to eat
[48:15] if that's the case walk out walk or
[48:17] that's not a buffet right I'm talking
[48:20] about a case where it's flowing they
[48:22] didn't say there's a little there's a
[48:24] there's a honeycomb here on the left
[48:26] side no they say the land is a good line
[48:29] it is large so there's room for
[48:31] everybody and it's flowing with milk and
[48:33] honey they say answer the place and
[48:36] here's the thing
[48:38] this here is
[48:41] it's very very interesting they say
[48:43] answer the place of so it means they
[48:45] exist and they already you know
[48:47] so he didn't tell you listen I'm gonna
[48:49] take you out and I'm gonna bring you
[48:50] into the Savannah the Queen's back
[48:52] Savannah everything is clear all is
[48:55] yours everything is cleaned up
[48:56] everything is scripts no he's saying no
[48:58] he said listen he say answer the place
[49:00] of Diana reading it again the Canaanites
[49:04] and he Hittites and the amorites and the
[49:07] parasites and the heavites and jebusites
[49:11] he identified them by name
[49:14] so you know listen this is God
[49:16] not into the pity party thing he not
[49:19] taking you out and say listen he wasn't
[49:20] sleepy for 400 years so here what I know
[49:23] you've been through a lot you know so
[49:25] here ascending into therapy for a
[49:27] hundred years and not only that while
[49:29] you do that I'm gonna clean your land
[49:30] I'm gonna take care of you I'm gonna
[49:32] prepare your place no at the end of the
[49:35] day
[49:35] God is God only time he operates a
[49:39] particular Wing So the same way he said
[49:41] listen up I put you on the tutors and
[49:43] governors and I test you I told Jesus
[49:45] say to those I love I rebuke and I chase
[49:48] I want to ensure if you don't bring
[49:50] forth fruit I will prune you I will cut
[49:51] you I will ensure that I want to get you
[49:54] a particular way because you are my
[49:56] child you're a reflection of me you
[49:58] don't have your own thought side and
[49:59] ideas you say your thoughts are not my
[50:01] thoughts he said your ways are not my
[50:03] ways you say my thoughts are higher than
[50:05] you also don't try to figure this out
[50:07] this is the way it is he said I'm gonna
[50:09] take you out of bondage out of slavery
[50:11] but I'm gonna give you some challenges I
[50:14] I'm gonna open it up I'm gonna tell you
[50:17] what you have to face so you say you
[50:19] have the key in a night the amorites
[50:21] parasites and each of them have their
[50:24] own unique way but guess what he also
[50:27] went on to say listen
[50:29] Behold The Cry of the children of Israel
[50:33] is come unto me
[50:35] just forgive me here right it's come
[50:37] unto me and I have also seen the
[50:41] oppression where with the Egyptians
[50:43] oppress them so I
[50:46] I Rise onita to assure you I said to
[50:49] encourage you but to reassure you that
[50:51] he knows everything
[50:53] he understands what you have been true
[50:55] so I don't want you to try to throw the
[50:58] pity party because it wouldn't work he
[51:00] understands listen I carry you through
[51:01] that and I can take you out of that
[51:03] right so don't feel sorry for yourself
[51:05] and oh gosh look at me imagine this is
[51:09] what I'm good you're going through that
[51:11] because he choose that route to send you
[51:13] through I do songwriter say something to
[51:15] the water some truly Flats I'm truly
[51:18] fire all through the blood he knows what
[51:21] you have made of he knows he tests to
[51:23] give you to ensure that he can develop a
[51:25] character that you have to be so you can
[51:28] line up with a statue of a perfect man
[51:30] that's what he wants from you
[51:34] [Music]
[51:40] there's another thing in this scripture
[51:42] that I want to highlight
[51:44] and I don't tend to be long but there's
[51:46] something significant that I just saw
[51:49] here I know it's here it's here here
[51:51] this is a scripture this is not my ideas
[51:52] this is not a revelation or Mighty
[51:54] mystery
[51:56] there is something I observed
[51:58] the children of Israel were in bondage
[52:00] for 400 years
[52:02] just walk with me for a second
[52:04] if you are in bondage for 400 years can
[52:06] you imagine
[52:07] after year one or two for perhaps five
[52:11] give yourself 10 years that's a long
[52:13] time
[52:14] you may have thought
[52:17] boy
[52:18] you see where we are by we are the
[52:20] children of God the chosen people can
[52:23] you imagine the kind of songs they sound
[52:26] songs I mean we often talk about slavery
[52:29] songs but you can imagine the kind of
[52:31] songs they had the kind of cries they
[52:34] had can you imagine those mothers and
[52:36] fathers and weeping children in the
[52:38] nights why why after go through this why
[52:41] my child have to be born into slavery
[52:44] can you imagine the kind of cries they
[52:46] have I thank God they were nurturing his
[52:48] day
[52:50] because we like to March we like to
[52:52] demand things pluck hard and think now
[52:54] at the end of the day the kind of cries
[52:56] these people would have had I could only
[52:58] imagine and and this is why I choose a
[53:00] title because I could only imagine they
[53:02] would have cried they would have had
[53:04] tears they would have had funerals they
[53:06] would have had had different things
[53:08] would have taken place in bondage and
[53:10] slavery can you imagine any type of
[53:12] services they had I'm sure they may have
[53:14] had opportunities where they tell them
[53:15] listen
[53:16] gather together a little bit not too
[53:19] long because we have things to build we
[53:20] have we have people to conquer and
[53:22] cities to build however I'm pretty sure
[53:24] they would have cried sometimes because
[53:26] bondages are hard they but I'm here to
[53:29] tell you when I read that
[53:31] what I observed is that in verse 7 which
[53:34] is the first verse we read one of the
[53:36] things we almost glossed over but it's
[53:38] there he said
[53:40] and I'll read it one more time
[53:42] he said and the Lord said I have surely
[53:44] seen the Affliction of my people so he's
[53:46] looking at it he saw it
[53:49] which are in Egypt so it's very very
[53:51] specific this is not anyway those people
[53:54] are my people and they're in Egypt they
[53:56] are being Afflicted and I'm seeing it I
[53:58] took notice of it and I'm telling you
[54:00] that that is what I'm seeing
[54:02] because I leave them there for a while
[54:04] but then he goes on to say and I have
[54:07] heard their cry
[54:11] so
[54:13] what I believe significantly is the fact
[54:15] that there was a cry that he couldn't
[54:18] ignore
[54:20] in year one they may have cried
[54:22] in your 40 they may have cried in year
[54:25] 300 they may have cried it would have
[54:27] been a valid cry but you know what I'm
[54:29] here to talk about the Last Cry can you
[54:31] imagine you're in year 400 you don't
[54:34] know when the delivery are coming you
[54:36] just know there's a promise of a
[54:37] deliverer and and here's this here's the
[54:39] shocker
[54:40] in year 400 you decide brother
[54:44] it's real pressure is yes my great great
[54:46] grandfather telling me about this you
[54:48] see this crying thing I I don't cry you
[54:50] know I cried my last cry last year
[54:53] this is it this is it a done a done No
[54:56] More Tears I'm going to accept this is
[54:59] my position and I'm gonna make the best
[55:01] of it can you imagine
[55:03] no that's not what God wants
[55:06] God wants you to cry he wants you to
[55:09] sigh he won't show it a depth of
[55:12] sincerity to know that this is not the
[55:15] place I'm supposed to be
[55:17] the enemy can have me this way I'm a
[55:21] Child of God
[55:22] has chosen me and predestinated me for
[55:26] this time
[55:27] so I'm gonna cry I'm gonna hold on I'm
[55:31] gonna fall on my face if I have to but
[55:34] this is my position that I'm not staying
[55:37] here you see Joseph say when you go take
[55:40] my bones because you know this is not a
[55:42] promised land this is not a place that
[55:45] God predestinate me to stay so the the
[55:48] inspiration I have is don't give up no
[55:52] matter how dark it seems no matter how
[55:54] gloomy it gets don't give up you don't
[55:57] know tonight might be a Last Cry The
[56:00] Last Cry and God respond and say you
[56:03] know what
[56:04] I heard I Cry
[56:06] I heard the Cry of my people I heard the
[56:09] cry about a London tonight and I come
[56:12] down to deliver him tonight he may have
[56:14] been crying for the last five years but
[56:16] tonight
[56:17] I can't ignorly cry anymore I need to
[56:20] respond because this cry is not the cry
[56:24] to walk away from you have reached
[56:26] points where I have no choice at this
[56:28] time I have to deliver I have to bring
[56:30] you out so the children that you're
[56:33] praying for for the last 20 years and
[56:35] you don't know what seems to be going on
[56:37] you seem like they're just going
[56:39] Australian they're not listening and
[56:41] they're Disobedience and they listen to
[56:43] No One don't give up don't give up the
[56:46] fight don't give up the prayer don't
[56:49] give up the crying because tonight might
[56:51] be a Last Cry that cause God on the
[56:54] scene that calls Jesus on the scene to
[56:57] respond and bring them out and it's not
[57:00] by your might it's not by your power but
[57:03] by his save the Lord so he gonna deliver
[57:06] with a mighty hand so don't stop crying
[57:09] when they tell you cry for the Holy
[57:12] Ghost I don't want you to stop it might
[57:15] be tiring you might be wearing but God
[57:19] may just be looking for that last cry
[57:21] and once that last cry takes place he
[57:24] could respond because that's the one cry
[57:27] that he can't ignore amen
[57:36] [Music]
[57:39] [Applause]
[57:41] foreign
[57:45] bless his name bless the name of the
[57:47] Lord
[57:51] [Applause]
[58:13] blessed be the name of the Lord
[58:16] Hallelujah
[58:18] Hallelujah
[58:20] he's the same yesterday today and
[58:22] forever
[58:24] amen amen amen
[58:26] Glory Hallelujah
[58:31] you know the prophet spoke a message
[58:34] the title of it is as the eagle Stir It
[58:37] Up her nest
[58:39] and I say I'm not making up any of these
[58:41] ideas
[58:43] and and in paragraph 52 he says I can
[58:46] prove to you by science
[58:48] not my ideas by science that anything
[58:51] that doesn't move is dead that's right
[58:54] you know if a baby is born and they
[58:55] don't cry you don't Squall it don't do
[58:57] nothing that baby's dead that's what the
[59:00] matter with the church today we've got
[59:02] too many stillborn babies you know what
[59:05] the doctor usually does he picks him up
[59:07] by the heels and give him a little
[59:09] posterior protoplasma stimulation a good
[59:12] old-fashioned spanking that fixes him up
[59:15] just right and what the church needs
[59:17] today is a good good old-time
[59:20] stimulation of the power of the Holy
[59:22] Ghost to come into the church tear us up
[59:25] shake us up still up the nest and blow
[59:30] out the loose feathers he said too many
[59:32] loose feathers you want to blow it out
[59:35] get it out
[59:44] [Music]
[59:47] you know the beauty of God is that he
[59:50] doesn't change
[59:51] he's not predictable but he doesn't
[59:53] change
[59:56] now
[59:57] in the story of blind Bartimaeus
[1:00:01] you know it's so interesting and we know
[1:00:04] the story
[1:00:05] that he wanted to be healed
[1:00:07] he wanted to be set free
[1:00:09] he wanted to be delivered in a different
[1:00:11] way he wasn't in bondage as we think
[1:00:14] about it but he had an Affliction that
[1:00:17] he wanted gone
[1:00:18] he had a Deliverance that he wanted to
[1:00:21] to be met he he wanted to be delivered
[1:00:23] from the scenario the situation in which
[1:00:25] he was in so you know at one time the
[1:00:28] story is still you know he sat there
[1:00:30] and he realized the crow was no longer
[1:00:33] around
[1:00:35] and he asked what's going on what's
[1:00:38] happening
[1:00:39] I
[1:00:40] I'm not getting arms and I'm not getting
[1:00:42] a little patterns in little coins as our
[1:00:44] custom get in and they say well you know
[1:00:47] interestingly you heard of Jesus Jesus
[1:00:50] is on the next street right and and as
[1:00:53] we go on the same
[1:00:55] he was on the expectation he was
[1:00:57] expecting and in the message expectation
[1:00:59] he says notice blind bataming as he was
[1:01:02] expecting if he could get to Jesus
[1:01:06] he or attract his attention
[1:01:09] that he would be healed
[1:01:12] so here's the thing
[1:01:13] they try to get him to set down
[1:01:17] and that's the calm down to take it easy
[1:01:20] because boss man you're blind
[1:01:23] you can't go anywhere where you're going
[1:01:26] you may have had a burden or desire but
[1:01:28] you can't do anything
[1:01:30] so what you're talking about you trying
[1:01:32] to get Jesus attention everybody have
[1:01:34] needs and you know what the scripture
[1:01:35] said to say he cried
[1:01:38] more
[1:01:39] more
[1:01:40] once again we see
[1:01:42] a a theme where he cried because he had
[1:01:46] a need
[1:01:47] he wasn't crying because I feel to cry
[1:01:50] today you know but he knew his crying
[1:01:54] was going to attract the attention of
[1:01:57] Jesus and he knew if he could only get
[1:01:59] the attention of Jesus he would be
[1:02:01] healed so he cried of them all thou son
[1:02:04] of David have mercy on me for he knew if
[1:02:07] he could ever bring the attention of
[1:02:08] Jesus to him that he expected Jesus
[1:02:11] would kill him if you expect him to be
[1:02:13] healed tonight wherever you are wherever
[1:02:15] you hear this tip if you're expecting to
[1:02:17] be healed today you will be healed
[1:02:20] whatever your expectations are and
[1:02:23] that's the prophet's words that's not
[1:02:25] mine the principle Remains the Same when
[1:02:29] you cry somehow it triggers a certain
[1:02:33] reaction that cannot be ignored it
[1:02:37] cannot be avoided and and you know what
[1:02:39] no I'm not sharing the cry it's it's
[1:02:41] that last cry because I sure blind
[1:02:44] buttermils cry before you know
[1:02:46] it wasn't the first time but you know
[1:02:49] what
[1:02:50] it was the last time because when you
[1:02:52] cry like that and Jesus respond and you
[1:02:55] call him on the scene it's not going to
[1:02:57] be the same I know because he would hear
[1:03:00] that cry that cry would transcend
[1:03:03] distance so no space could hinder it you
[1:03:06] know is not necessarily the volume doing
[1:03:08] it but he faith in the cry that could
[1:03:11] connect like a deep call into a deep and
[1:03:15] the Deep have to respond no matter what
[1:03:18] the principle Remains the Same so I hope
[1:03:22] you get a clue tonight that is not the
[1:03:24] time to give up it's not the time to
[1:03:27] stop it's not the time to be wary
[1:03:29] although the promise might might go on
[1:03:33] for one year for five years for ten
[1:03:35] years 40 years this is the time to cry
[1:03:38] all the more
[1:03:39] to see the manifestation a kite on the
[1:03:44] scene that might be a Last Cry the
[1:03:47] pivotal one the critical one that calls
[1:03:50] Jesus on the scene
[1:03:53] as we go on
[1:03:58] I want to make quick mention because I
[1:04:00] said it wouldn't be long about the
[1:04:02] parable of the unjust judge As We Know
[1:04:06] and and Jesus spoke the parable unto
[1:04:08] them in this end that men ought always
[1:04:11] to pray and not faint saying there was
[1:04:14] in a city a judge which feared not God
[1:04:17] neither regarded man
[1:04:20] he was a serious fella
[1:04:22] he didn't even fear God he had no regard
[1:04:25] for man he was just about his business
[1:04:28] by the book this is what it is black and
[1:04:31] white there's no negotiation no middle
[1:04:33] ground No No Gray at all this is how he
[1:04:36] was who he was
[1:04:38] and he says at the same time there was a
[1:04:41] widow in that City
[1:04:43] and she came onto him saying avenge me
[1:04:46] of mine adversary
[1:04:48] and he would not for a while but
[1:04:51] afterward
[1:04:52] he said within himself
[1:04:54] though I fear not God nor regard man yet
[1:04:59] because this Widow trouble at me I will
[1:05:03] avenge her less by her continual coming
[1:05:06] she weary me
[1:05:08] and the Lord said hear what the unjust
[1:05:11] judge said
[1:05:13] and shall not God avenge his own elect
[1:05:17] which cry day and night unto him though
[1:05:21] he belong with them I tell you that he
[1:05:24] will avenge him speedily nevertheless
[1:05:27] when the son of man cometh shall he find
[1:05:29] faith on the earth now we see a common
[1:05:32] theme a Common Thread so it goes on to
[1:05:35] say yes she came and she knocked yes she
[1:05:39] came he may have been a particular way
[1:05:42] he may have had certain characteristics
[1:05:44] about him that may not have been
[1:05:46] conducive to what she desired and people
[1:05:48] may have had their judgments about how
[1:05:51] he operated they might say he feels
[1:05:53] tushed he's stuck up he wouldn't respond
[1:05:55] he is not the person to go to you know
[1:05:57] you're wasting your time but you know
[1:05:59] what
[1:06:00] he said you know what it's best I
[1:06:02] Avenger
[1:06:03] unless you're wearing me
[1:06:06] less by your crying less by your
[1:06:09] persistence yes by your continuity yes
[1:06:11] by your level of commitment yet listen
[1:06:15] when God looks at your faithfulness and
[1:06:18] see Wednesday after Wednesday Sunday
[1:06:20] after Sunday on Friday nights the level
[1:06:23] of commitment the consistency the cry
[1:06:26] the faith the the fact that the promise
[1:06:29] not manifested yet but you're holding on
[1:06:31] still it's been five years but you're
[1:06:33] holding on still it's been 15 years but
[1:06:36] you're holding on still after a while
[1:06:38] you say listen I will live Avengers
[1:06:41] speedily you know because you don't want
[1:06:44] to wear him he wanted to recognize that
[1:06:47] listen that fit is a real deal that is
[1:06:49] not pretense like my father always said
[1:06:52] he said you are who you are across the
[1:06:54] board
[1:06:55] across the board he said you could
[1:06:57] pretend for a while you know you could
[1:06:58] pretend that work that you're going
[1:07:00] early to work every day but guess what
[1:07:03] after a while
[1:07:05] all of a sudden you come back into your
[1:07:08] comfort zone of course I'm coming late
[1:07:11] right so you could keep it up for a long
[1:07:13] time you know but you know what it's
[1:07:15] almost like the truth will rise to the
[1:07:17] top
[1:07:18] right no matter how hard you try it have
[1:07:21] a way of leaking out and seeping out
[1:07:23] same thing with crying when you say you
[1:07:26] have that kind of commitment that kind
[1:07:30] of passion perseverance persistence and
[1:07:32] that drive and you know
[1:07:35] I have a need
[1:07:36] I want the Holy Ghost deliver my
[1:07:39] children I want you to restore I want
[1:07:42] you to open up my blind eyes I want you
[1:07:44] to fix my female condition I want it
[1:07:47] fixed tonight I want it fixed tonight
[1:07:49] I'm not going anywhere
[1:07:52] until you do it right now
[1:07:54] tonight not tomorrow tonight he have a
[1:07:59] way he just have a way that he he is
[1:08:02] almost obligated to respond I don't know
[1:08:05] your condition tonight but he knows that
[1:08:08] he is obligated to respond to that kind
[1:08:11] of a faith that kind of commitment that
[1:08:15] kind of persistence
[1:08:21] my my my my my
[1:08:25] amen amen amen isn't Jesus wonderful
[1:08:29] we can't give up now we can't stop now
[1:08:32] we've come too far down the road
[1:08:36] [Music]
[1:08:43] you know this is a guy I admire a lot I
[1:08:46] believe a lot of people could relate to
[1:08:48] him and that's that that strong man
[1:08:51] Samson
[1:08:53] you know it's so interesting that he had
[1:08:57] a covenant on his life
[1:08:59] he was called before he was born
[1:09:03] his mother knew he would have been a
[1:09:05] special child
[1:09:06] he was predestinated to operate a
[1:09:09] particular way
[1:09:11] and it was Supernatural everything he
[1:09:13] did
[1:09:14] he wasn't this kind of muscle man as as
[1:09:17] Hollywood portray him as you know but he
[1:09:20] had a strength that was unparalleled
[1:09:22] nothing else could compare to it defeats
[1:09:25] he did
[1:09:26] people looking oh as a matter of fact
[1:09:29] go on to say the enemy used to tremble
[1:09:32] just at the name something he didn't
[1:09:34] have to walk in you know just by the
[1:09:36] name you can imagine you walking down
[1:09:38] the road and they just said Gideon
[1:09:41] and people shaking
[1:09:42] that's how powerful he was just the name
[1:09:45] alone if somebody says Samson they might
[1:09:48] have said jokingly
[1:09:51] it had an effect it reminded me when I
[1:09:52] was in secondary school the principal
[1:09:55] well I went to a unique school I went to
[1:09:58] a school that used to have lick
[1:10:00] something
[1:10:00] they used a bit
[1:10:02] I know that might be outlawed no but
[1:10:05] everybody used to beat it didn't matter
[1:10:07] who it was it could be a form teacher
[1:10:09] your deed a principal I mean anybody who
[1:10:13] is anybody used to beat
[1:10:15] so the principal had a way he was a beat
[1:10:17] first and asked questions after
[1:10:19] if you believe anything wrong licks
[1:10:22] looks like he didn't care who get licks
[1:10:24] it could be the first student the
[1:10:25] brightest student the nerd it didn't
[1:10:27] matter licks lick slicks and then oh and
[1:10:29] he used to apologize if he'd be the
[1:10:31] wrong person
[1:10:32] right as a result
[1:10:35] when he left the school
[1:10:37] even no listen he retired huh when he
[1:10:41] retired from the school even the song of
[1:10:43] his name when they say Cox everybody's
[1:10:46] straighten up
[1:10:47] he had such an impact
[1:10:50] that we respected even the name
[1:10:53] being spoken mind you this was after he
[1:10:56] physically left the school he still had
[1:10:58] that lasting Legacy and impact on us
[1:11:01] thank God for that huh
[1:11:03] Samson was like that wherever he went
[1:11:06] his story went before him
[1:11:09] he was larger than life
[1:11:11] so he would go into a place
[1:11:14] would went out
[1:11:16] Samson on his way you know
[1:11:19] so you're better
[1:11:21] take care of your business sort yourself
[1:11:22] out because Samsung comment we don't
[1:11:24] know what he up to
[1:11:25] but
[1:11:26] it's interesting and we know the story
[1:11:28] how you know he cut off his hair and and
[1:11:31] we we know that part
[1:11:33] and the part that I say that we could
[1:11:36] relate to
[1:11:37] is after the fact yes after the drama
[1:11:42] after we see he was on the straight and
[1:11:45] narrow and what happened to him and it
[1:11:47] was a nice story but there came a point
[1:11:49] in which he was grinding at the Mill
[1:11:54] you probably don't spend enough time
[1:11:55] there but he was grinding
[1:11:58] can you just imagine
[1:12:00] Samson
[1:12:02] just like us the way he felt you think
[1:12:05] he felt bad
[1:12:06] terrible horrible he felt he failed God
[1:12:10] he failed his family he was a
[1:12:13] disappointment he may have cried he may
[1:12:16] have thought Lord
[1:12:17] how I could do this
[1:12:19] why why I had to do this I knew better
[1:12:24] oh gosh next time if I had a second
[1:12:26] chance if I only had another opportunity
[1:12:29] it wouldn't be this sweet he may have
[1:12:31] made promises he said Lord if you could
[1:12:33] regenerate my eyes
[1:12:35] I will ensure you know the good I will
[1:12:39] preach I will teach I will do I will be
[1:12:43] great I will give charity I will do all
[1:12:45] I could do he may have done that but you
[1:12:48] know his conscience would have convicted
[1:12:51] him
[1:12:52] he would have felt bad
[1:12:54] he would have gone through all I call it
[1:12:57] all human emotions
[1:12:59] of what he went through and what
[1:13:01] happened to him and he beat up himself
[1:13:03] and he felt he was no good and Lord you
[1:13:05] should choose somebody else and why you
[1:13:07] choose me and I disappoint you and he
[1:13:09] would have gone through this process
[1:13:11] until
[1:13:13] one day
[1:13:15] he was grinding at the middle
[1:13:18] and it might have seemed to everybody
[1:13:21] else to be a regular d
[1:13:23] because Samsung grew accustomed to
[1:13:25] grinding at the Mill
[1:13:28] you know
[1:13:31] there's a message called Just One More
[1:13:34] Time Lord that brother Branham preached
[1:13:36] and in that message in chapter 99 he
[1:13:39] says no now we find out that while
[1:13:42] Samson stood there looking over his
[1:13:45] error looking what had been done in his
[1:13:48] inner conscience that he had he had
[1:13:50] failed God Amen that's what he did
[1:13:54] he failed God he was a disappointment at
[1:13:57] that stage if we look at Samson Samson
[1:13:59] is not a role model at that point
[1:14:01] failed be like success we like to see
[1:14:04] Heroes we like Victory but he failed
[1:14:08] and it went on to say
[1:14:11] he failed God he had failed God's people
[1:14:16] and there he stood as an example
[1:14:18] thinking back what he was and thinking
[1:14:21] no what he was
[1:14:23] it would have been so different
[1:14:26] he was Samson the man whose name
[1:14:29] people was afraid of
[1:14:31] the man who was powerful and strong
[1:14:33] people had confidence in him
[1:14:36] self
[1:14:40] Samson is on our side and now he looked
[1:14:43] down and he
[1:14:44] looked through his socketless eyes and
[1:14:47] he said
[1:14:49] I'm a failure
[1:14:51] I disappointed God I disappointed my
[1:14:53] family my parents as a matter of fact
[1:14:56] people don't don't talk about me anymore
[1:14:59] there are no memes they don't like my
[1:15:01] posts I I am I I don't come for anything
[1:15:05] you know what he said
[1:15:07] he was thinking what he was and thinking
[1:15:09] no what he was and when he did that
[1:15:13] it comes up again guess what he cried
[1:15:15] out he cried out somehow our doubted the
[1:15:18] first time
[1:15:20] I'm sure there are times when he stood
[1:15:22] alone and cried
[1:15:24] cried cried cried because of what he had
[1:15:27] done
[1:15:28] cry because where he was cried because
[1:15:31] of where he was before that so cry
[1:15:33] because of the past cry because of his
[1:15:35] present condition
[1:15:37] and he said
[1:15:39] oh if the church tonight would stand
[1:15:42] still a minute and look back to the day
[1:15:43] of Pentecost look back to where we
[1:15:45] started from and realize the condition
[1:15:47] that our Creeds and fussing has gotten
[1:15:49] us into cry out again Samson cried Lord
[1:15:53] God Revenge my two eyes if we could cry
[1:15:57] that same pension and cry Lord God these
[1:16:00] things has guided me blind all these
[1:16:02] times now he knew there was a price to
[1:16:05] pay you know it
[1:16:07] there's a price to pray for doing the
[1:16:09] wrong thing but it didn't stop Samson
[1:16:12] from coming to the realization that the
[1:16:15] god you served
[1:16:16] was greater than the scenario he was in
[1:16:20] it didn't stop Samson from crying out
[1:16:22] and saying you know what
[1:16:24] and I know brother Branham said it he
[1:16:26] said he said listen he almost
[1:16:28] rationalized that God had the same power
[1:16:31] that he had before even if Samson didn't
[1:16:34] have it that the God he served was
[1:16:36] greater than the circumstance and the
[1:16:39] fact that he had disappointed the people
[1:16:41] and disappointed God that God was the
[1:16:43] same yesterday today and forever and if
[1:16:46] he could cry out to God and call out a
[1:16:49] God the poor Adventure God would hear
[1:16:51] him and God would respond and God would
[1:16:54] avenge or Revenge him of his two eyes
[1:16:56] that were lost and although he was doing
[1:16:58] wrong to lose it they were wrong to
[1:17:00] imprison him they were wrong to take it
[1:17:03] they were wrong to afflict him they were
[1:17:05] wronged to have him in pressure in that
[1:17:08] way not him he was still a child of God
[1:17:10] it didn't change the fact of who he was
[1:17:12] the prodigal son's example was the same
[1:17:15] he was no less than a son he may have
[1:17:18] been out of position he may have been
[1:17:20] out of place like you might feel at
[1:17:22] times you may have been out of church
[1:17:24] you may have felt like you're
[1:17:26] disappointed your parents your
[1:17:28] disappointed Church you disappoint
[1:17:30] somebody else you disappoint God but it
[1:17:33] doesn't change who God is and it doesn't
[1:17:35] change what God thinks about you and
[1:17:38] Samson had the ability to cry out to God
[1:17:40] and we know the rest is history although
[1:17:43] he had a price to pay God was able to
[1:17:45] come down and he said in his death more
[1:17:49] persons were slayed than in his entire
[1:17:51] life amen
[1:17:54] foreign
[1:18:04] looking at this and I keep saying
[1:18:06] it doesn't matter how many times you cry
[1:18:10] it isn't important
[1:18:12] how hard you cry or how long you cry
[1:18:15] what is important
[1:18:18] is that when God pulls the lesson you
[1:18:21] see that last cry
[1:18:22] it had a comfort you know
[1:18:24] you're carry missing in action I mean I
[1:18:27] I travel and I like to travel and and as
[1:18:29] as many persons may know if you're
[1:18:31] taking a boat or playing a train they
[1:18:33] often is what they call a final call
[1:18:36] so you could be I I remember I was
[1:18:39] traveling recently a few months ago and
[1:18:41] I thought I had
[1:18:43] a layover that was a few hours about
[1:18:45] four hours and I'm an adventurous fella
[1:18:47] I say adventurous because I wasn't in
[1:18:49] Trinidad and I looked on my phone and I
[1:18:51] saw there's a bus taking you to a mall
[1:18:54] and there's a bus to bring you back I
[1:18:57] assuming it's not Trinidad so it's
[1:18:58] efficient and on time
[1:19:00] so I took the bus and I went
[1:19:02] and I didn't expect the boss to be an
[1:19:05] old stop bus all stop mean it's stopping
[1:19:07] at all stops everyone
[1:19:10] so as I'm going I'm thinking I have a
[1:19:12] flight to catch
[1:19:13] have a flight to catch
[1:19:15] as I'm as I'm coming back I'm praying
[1:19:18] to leave
[1:19:20] our flight to catch by God's grace I
[1:19:22] made it
[1:19:25] in the story I'm about to tell you it's
[1:19:27] kind of similar
[1:19:29] at the end of the day when in the
[1:19:32] airport they make that announcement and
[1:19:34] say I'm calling x y and z
[1:19:38] you see people sometimes running
[1:19:41] the reason because they have to be on
[1:19:44] that plane before that door closes
[1:19:47] there comes a point however when they
[1:19:49] say final boarding call for and the city
[1:19:53] name
[1:19:54] no sometimes you see people tripping
[1:19:56] over themselves racing
[1:19:59] skating sliding trying to get in because
[1:20:02] it's the final call you see at that
[1:20:05] point if you miss that the door shuttle
[1:20:08] like no idea
[1:20:09] there is no way there's no listen you
[1:20:14] could be the top negotiator in the world
[1:20:17] the kind of rules and restrictions they
[1:20:19] have they don't reopen planes or reopen
[1:20:22] flights because you were late enough
[1:20:24] you could tell them listen I have a
[1:20:25] million dollars here they're not real
[1:20:27] many flights for you you know they are
[1:20:30] no respecter of persons you know that's
[1:20:31] the way God is
[1:20:33] God operates a particular way with a
[1:20:35] level of excellence and professionalism
[1:20:37] he not Viking haphazard and you know
[1:20:40] what I go make up a rule for this one
[1:20:43] this child of mine he kind of slack on a
[1:20:45] song make her I'll have the barley lower
[1:20:47] no you have one bar
[1:20:49] everybody must have the token where they
[1:20:52] are all your young you're rich you're
[1:20:54] poor you're no calm you're here for 30
[1:20:56] years it matters not
[1:20:58] my pay is the same pay my rules are the
[1:21:01] same rules my expectations are the same
[1:21:03] why because I'm gone and I don't change
[1:21:06] I'm the same yesterday today and forever
[1:21:08] so it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
[1:21:10] that you think you don't understand
[1:21:11] everything guess what you don't have to
[1:21:14] in this season you have to have what he
[1:21:17] is looking for
[1:21:18] right so if the flight is about to take
[1:21:22] off you have to be inside
[1:21:24] you can't say well well I didn't know
[1:21:27] that flights just be on time I thought I
[1:21:29] was in Trinidad no you can't say that
[1:21:31] there's no excuse it will leave you
[1:21:33] wherever you are it doesn't matter who
[1:21:35] you are the fact that is the first time
[1:21:37] I'm traveling you know no it doesn't
[1:21:39] matter no respecter of persons his rules
[1:21:42] is his rules he operate the way he's of
[1:21:44] operating he choose to do what he wants
[1:21:47] to do when he wants to do it how he
[1:21:48] wants to do it he doesn't have to
[1:21:49] explain it to you that's just the way he
[1:21:52] is right now
[1:21:54] the same way I said that sometimes we in
[1:21:58] our finite Minds try to figure out and
[1:22:00] explain how God operates but look how he
[1:22:02] works
[1:22:04] there's a story told us we know and
[1:22:06] sometimes we highlight it by talking
[1:22:08] about the alabaster box
[1:22:10] and in the message he
[1:22:14] leodusian Church age
[1:22:17] where Abraham said you know and we know
[1:22:19] this story in the terms of the backstory
[1:22:20] Simon invited Jesus to come to his house
[1:22:24] and when he came in he said you know he
[1:22:25] said usually there's a feet washing
[1:22:27] flunky that will will clean his feet and
[1:22:29] clean up because it wasn't tables or
[1:22:31] chairs as we know it today you sat
[1:22:34] almost on the floor cross your feet and
[1:22:36] you eat perhaps with your hands and
[1:22:38] stuff right in this particular scenario
[1:22:40] Simon would have invited him over and
[1:22:43] basically ignored him
[1:22:45] came to Simon's place and whether he was
[1:22:48] there he wasn't there it made no
[1:22:49] difference at all he was just there he
[1:22:52] existed there so there was no Provisions
[1:22:55] for him there was no special treatment
[1:22:57] or or I will go so far as to say there
[1:22:59] was no normal treatment for him because
[1:23:01] that that wasn't something for the
[1:23:03] privilege or for the rich that was
[1:23:05] something you do because they walked
[1:23:07] long long distances as well and
[1:23:09] oftentimes as sandals and the cloaks and
[1:23:11] stuff would have been going through the
[1:23:12] dirt and the dung and stuff so when you
[1:23:14] reach somebody's home it's natural and
[1:23:16] normal that you will wash your feet you
[1:23:18] know so there would be be welcome they
[1:23:21] would be comfortable in the space so as
[1:23:23] we went down
[1:23:25] and we know
[1:23:27] this lady
[1:23:29] this
[1:23:31] prostitute woman
[1:23:34] saw what was taking place
[1:23:37] and she got a burden somebody said
[1:23:40] burden
[1:23:41] she had a burden
[1:23:44] and her burden was to ensure that Jesus
[1:23:47] doesn't remain that way
[1:23:50] she saw Jesus come to Simon's house
[1:23:54] and she wanted to ensure that Jesus
[1:23:56] didn't remain that way
[1:23:59] so as a result
[1:24:02] as The Story Goes she would have brought
[1:24:04] an alabaster box
[1:24:06] and anointed his feet and you say
[1:24:09] cried and she used her hair to dry it up
[1:24:12] we know the story
[1:24:13] and after that
[1:24:16] it just brings a context as to what's
[1:24:18] taking place here in the laodice
[1:24:22] paragraph 250.
[1:24:26] Jesus I guess looks over said Simon I
[1:24:29] got something to say to you
[1:24:31] you invited me here and you never met me
[1:24:34] at the door now
[1:24:36] if you were to come to my house
[1:24:39] on a normal basis meaning you arrive at
[1:24:42] my house I'll meet you at the front I
[1:24:45] might even meet you outside
[1:24:46] to welcome you in
[1:24:48] I will open the door hey come in welcome
[1:24:51] this is where I live
[1:24:54] so here they're saying Simon didn't even
[1:24:56] meet him at the door
[1:24:58] Simon was about his own business but
[1:25:01] they invited him
[1:25:03] you didn't give me any water to wash my
[1:25:05] feet with
[1:25:06] you never anointed my head when I come
[1:25:09] in
[1:25:10] take the patch of the sun off me
[1:25:13] now the way Jesus describes this you can
[1:25:15] see that this is the norm
[1:25:18] this was a regular expectation this
[1:25:21] wasn't you know I would say you're bull
[1:25:24] face if you were to come to my house and
[1:25:25] say Gideon you didn't give me some
[1:25:29] freshly squeezed orange juice you
[1:25:31] invited me in
[1:25:33] I have no obligation to do that
[1:25:35] but if it's the norm that people are
[1:25:38] walking and it's hot like it's hot these
[1:25:39] days and I say hey when people reach
[1:25:42] behind me they must drink some cold
[1:25:43] water at least you know you must be
[1:25:45] refreshed I put on the ESC so you cool
[1:25:48] long put your shoes aside and take care
[1:25:50] of you because I'm inviting you and I'm
[1:25:52] expecting to treat you a particular way
[1:25:54] so this was the norm this is nothing
[1:25:56] special here now and he said oh my
[1:26:01] you never give me any kiss of welcome
[1:26:04] when I come in but this poor woman
[1:26:07] oh my this outsider a prostitute on the
[1:26:11] street
[1:26:12] she had no water to wash my feet she
[1:26:15] washed them with her tears she had
[1:26:17] nothing to wipe them off with so she
[1:26:20] took her hair she wiped them she
[1:26:22] continually kissed my feet now I want to
[1:26:25] say to you her sins which were many are
[1:26:29] forgiven her that's right never said
[1:26:32] nothing about his your sins which are
[1:26:35] many are forgiven now
[1:26:38] the reason I read that is because she
[1:26:41] caught a burden being a prostitute and
[1:26:44] an outsider she wasn't too Corral
[1:26:47] familiar with what may have been been
[1:26:52] missing or what was taking place but she
[1:26:54] looked in and saw a need so she went and
[1:26:56] she she cried and she wiped it and she
[1:26:58] kissed his feet and she did things that
[1:27:00] Simon was supposed to do but failed to
[1:27:03] do and in doing so although Jesus
[1:27:06] highlighted the fact that listen we know
[1:27:09] this woman is a prostitution we know
[1:27:11] she's an outsider she wasn't even
[1:27:13] supposed to be there because of her
[1:27:16] burden because of a cry because of her
[1:27:18] desire because of her commitment her
[1:27:21] sins which were many were forgiven which
[1:27:23] means
[1:27:24] that was the last cry she cried in
[1:27:29] I doubt she practiced that but when she
[1:27:31] came and washed the feet of Jesus with
[1:27:33] her tears with us level of sincerity
[1:27:36] with a burden to have this wrong made
[1:27:40] right
[1:27:41] Jesus could turn to her and say listen
[1:27:43] not tomorrow not next week not next
[1:27:47] month he said listen your sins which we
[1:27:50] all know to be many are forgiven right
[1:27:53] now
[1:27:54] so I'm still saying
[1:27:57] when you cry unto God with sincerity and
[1:28:01] musicians could get ready when you call
[1:28:03] out unto God and you catch a burden for
[1:28:06] the promises of God he has to respond
[1:28:09] and when he responds that way
[1:28:12] listen you can't say the same you know
[1:28:15] she walked in a prostitute and walked
[1:28:17] out different you know
[1:28:19] the children of Israel were slaves but
[1:28:21] when they cried he said listen I've
[1:28:23] heard the cries and have come down to
[1:28:25] deliver they were free you know
[1:28:27] when you see a cry that last cry and it
[1:28:30] resonate like that when God realized
[1:28:33] that you mean business that you're not
[1:28:35] doing this because somebody trying to
[1:28:37] woke you up and somebody trying to crank
[1:28:39] you up but but you're really sincere and
[1:28:41] you really want this and you really have
[1:28:43] a burden and a desire he is obligated to
[1:28:46] keep his promises you know and the mark
[1:28:49] of God is like that
[1:28:51] the Lord said unto him you know go
[1:28:53] through the midst of the city
[1:28:56] talking about the Marco Gordon
[1:28:58] through the midst of the city through
[1:29:00] the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark
[1:29:02] upon the foreheads of the men that sigh
[1:29:04] and those that cry for all the
[1:29:06] Abominations that are done in the midst
[1:29:08] thereof and to the others he said in my
[1:29:10] hearing going after him through the city
[1:29:13] and smite let not your eyes spare
[1:29:16] neither have ye pity and
[1:29:18] slay utterly old and young earlier on
[1:29:22] when I'm saying that that Benchmark is
[1:29:24] the same it doesn't matter where they're
[1:29:26] old whether they're young whether this
[1:29:27] is your first year whether this is your
[1:29:30] 30th year his requirement is still the
[1:29:32] same he says slay utterly old and young
[1:29:35] but maids and little children and woman
[1:29:37] but come not near any man upon whom is
[1:29:41] the mark who got the mark those outside
[1:29:43] and cry those that had that burden that
[1:29:47] those that had that level of commitment
[1:29:49] and sincerity knowing that he who made
[1:29:52] the promises able to calm down and
[1:29:54] deliver no matter what your scenario
[1:29:56] your situation your circumstance he said
[1:29:59] then they began at the ancient men which
[1:30:02] were before the house
[1:30:04] so once again there's no respecter
[1:30:06] persons it doesn't matter that you're an
[1:30:08] elder a dick not a minister his
[1:30:11] requirement is the same no matter where
[1:30:13] you are no matter where you go he still
[1:30:16] requires that kind of desperation that
[1:30:18] kind of cry to get in the spirit that
[1:30:20] kind of call to ensure that that you do
[1:30:23] have a level of sincerity yes you may
[1:30:26] have fallen yes you may have made
[1:30:28] disappointments yes you have made
[1:30:29] missteps but it doesn't change God's
[1:30:32] perception and God's view of you it
[1:30:34] doesn't change his greatness and his
[1:30:35] goodness and his ability to do above and
[1:30:38] beyond all you can have or think all
[1:30:41] that you could imagine he is well able
[1:30:44] to deliver cry that cry for who knows
[1:30:47] that might be a last crime keep on
[1:30:49] fighting keep on pressing don't give up
[1:30:52] no matter how dark it seems how gloomy
[1:30:55] it seems how wary it might be know that
[1:30:58] he is faithful and able to keep all his
[1:31:00] promises and deliver amen God bless you
