words shall not pass away and take heed to yourselves least at any time your hearts be overcharged with the fighting and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that they come upon you una awes for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man oh blessed be the name of the Lord Praise His holy name and let's go to Isaiah chapter 60 praise be to Jesus arise and shine for the light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon the may God the bless the read of his word you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord praise God what a time this morning in the word and what a contrast of that Good Shepherd from Ezekiel 34 where God says son of man prophesy against the Shepherds of Israel prophesy and say unto them thus say the Lord God unto the she Shepherds W be to the Shepherds of Israel that feed themselves should not the Shepherds feed the flock he eat the fat he clothe you with the wool you kill them that are fed but you feed not the flock the disease have you not strengthened neither have you healed that which was sick neither have you bounded up that which was broken neither have you brought again that which was driven away neither have you sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have you ruled them and they were scattered because there is no Shepherd and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered my sheep wandered through all the mountains upon every High Hill yeah my flock was scattered upon all the Earth and none did search or seek after them therefore ye Shepherds hear the word of the Lord as I live sayth the Lord God surely because my flock became a prey my flock you see what God keep say my flock my flock my flock this is not meant churches the people don't belong to men it's my flock is my people the my people that's called by my name praise God Hal in the last days true Shepherds will be a hidden Mystery and brother preach a message called why it had to be Shepherds and reveal a hidden Mystery that God going to have true shepherds in the last day BTO the false Shepherds Hallelujah so what the shepherd supposed to do is to heal the brokenhearted to restore those that are lost to go after them in other words they're supposed to have a heart of a shepherd a true Shepherd that would lay down his life for the sheep and stand for what is right and stand for what is true and stand for what is righteous that is the kind of heart that God going to put in the last days oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God him in listen to this as I liveed say the Lord God surely because my flock became a prey and my flock became meet to every beast of the field because there was no Shepherd neither did my shepherd search on my flock but the Shepherds fed themselves and fed not my flock therefore oh Shepherds hear the word of the Lord th say the Lord God behold I am against the Shepherds I will require my flock at their hand and cause them to cease from fending the flock neither shall the Shepherds feed themselves anymore but I will deliver them from their mouth for thus say the Lord I even I will both search my sheep and seek them out God promised the Lord himself to descend from heaven with a shout to come and seek his own sheep out so you don't belong to no man you don't belong to no system you belong to the Lord God Almighty Oh Glory praise God do you believe that tonight Hallelujah so you have to know who find you God himself push back this one push back that one he don't care if it was in a bar he don't care if it was in adultery if it was in fornication I care if it was drunk and drinking God himself he said I myself going to come down and find my sheep glory to God hallelujah Halle he is the Good Shepherd Oh Glory to God hallelujah all that the father had given me will come glory to God and I will raise them up so no devil could hold you back you are going to come out you are going to be free you're going to be be Anointed with god oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen do you believe that praise the name of the Lord thank you so this morning this evening a little message the word manifested is the light of the hour that's the title the word manifested is the light of the hour from s is the time but brandham it might be closer than you think it's got me scared I haven't done enough where are we at time shall be no more he announced a Time is over what happens is this real it's already in the scriptures no time shall be no more we be talking about this and that and all we want to plan time shall be no more Russia in position is not right the sodomites in position is not right everything is getting into position what about that bride that bride have to get in position glory to God I'm going to prove it to you before judgment struck Egypt they had a Goan judgment didn't strike Goan Goan was the only place of safety you have to get to Goan if there's one place you got to go and hide is in cion in cion had the blood in Goan to kill the lamb it go tell they appli the blood to the doorpost because the angel told Moses to tell the people when I see the blood I'm going to pass over you praise God they had a sign they had a prophet they had prophetic utterance they had a word from the Lord and if ever there was a time to get a word from the Lord is a time like this because the Bible said there's going to come a famine in the last days Oh Glory not for books and tips we have a lot of that not for preachers we have lots of that but for hearing the true word of God they're going to run to the east they're going to run to the West they're going to run to the north they're going to run to the South they can't find it but there's going to be a people that going to be well fed my people shall eat and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord their God why because the Good Shepherd going to Fe need his flock oh give the Lord a praise offering oh Hallelujah and the manner that the Sheep is going to get is found under the seven seal that was reserved for the Sheep it's seven Thunders under there banging 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 Thunders under there that's for the Sheep Oh Glory oh Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to godj you may be seated time shall be no more he announced that time is over what happened could that be so seriously think if it is then the pyramid here we go is capped by the seven tunders and if the pyramid is capped by the seven tunders then the seven Thunders is the holy spirit I'm not hearing you I am not hearing you if the pyramid is kept by the seven tunders then the seven tunders is the Holy Spirit and the Seven tunders is the Capstone woo hallelujah it's the Capstone Revelation turning into a Capstone manifestation oh give the Lord Praises Jesus amen Jesus said my words they are spirit and they are life amen what he did not say is the process for it to turn from word into spirit because anytime God about to do something he doesn't give you the full fulfillment of it if you want a savior he say hold a baby amen amen come on now if you want a deliverer he said hold a seed and watch it unfold everybody want the full thing complete everybody want a full Deliverance but he said a virgin shall conceive you want a deliverer he's in Baby Moses watch him grow he's coming he's coming he's not ready yet he's coming look how God has work when he get fed up a sa he told Samuel go to the house of Jesse anoint my king I have a king there not a little boy a king God here it complete come on now come on now God see God sees your adoption complete God sees God sees your healing complete God sees God sees your deliverance complete my feel of faith in the building tonight I feel an anointing in the building tonight oh glory to God it's good to be here it's good to be here W Glory you may be seated God Was going about to anoint David to be Shepherd over Israel David was God's Shepherd isn't that right but watch this when Samuel came a boy was coming but God so a king you see God loves to see the seed unfold itself you see God knows that once the word Goes Forth the word is a seed and the word just can't return void God knows when that word when that word is [Applause] spoken that word have power in itself come on now come on now let's go down to Genesis let's let every seed bring forth after it's came my God I don't have enough this church is too small for me today oh glory to God is too [Applause] small Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's right that's why the devil is always interested in killing babies because the babies have the potential you you see a little Eagle is a big one in small form I'll say it again a little Eagle is a big one in small form oh if you only get big if the church only got to know who he is if you got to know who you are if you got to know your potential you will see why the devil is fighting you toot and nail every single day of your life because he knows that if you come into an understanding and a revelation of who you are and you can do the Greater [Applause] Works you may be SE Adam Adam was a seed of the word amen Adam did not to a TR Adam just was born let make man man became a living Soul let a man of dominion hallelujah hallelujah a man with Dominion a man with power a man with God a man veiled with God fell so you think you falling a surprise o I'm surprised you mean you don't want to say Amen on that that's okay you are surprised at what I'm saying amen that's why Jesus didn't get no fight with the one of the well that's right it's five man oh I gone see Jesus have no problems because you were born in [Applause] sin all have come short of the glory not some all all all all have come short of the glory not some all so don't play righteous inside of here with like you have some wings to fly somewhere we will clip Them Wings and make you sit in your [Applause] seat do I hear a shout in the house you may be seated when power start to ooze out of Peter when power start to flow like Sparks off a Anvil and the people got excited DP said don't look at us we are but men it's not by our Holiness this man is made whole but by the power in the name of Jesus this man walks before you Peter knew what he did Peter knew how he came through and he knew it wasn't by might or power but by the spirit oh my God my Jesus Oh Glory we in a new time we in a new season and now we going to say the right thing and we going to dash into the blessings of any day now any any service now and he service now the right word going to be spoken the right thing is going to be done do you believe that listen to this there is no church is our standard there is no church we can look up to there is none all I have is the word this is a new season when Joshua cross over he said we have not been here before this is a new time all together nobody could teach us where to put our foot we know every place come on now every every place every place every place from this day forward every place yeah yeah every place you put your is yours oh hallelujah amen Isaac every place every place every place so you what happened to us now we become dangerous men in Satan's kingdom we are dangerous people we are atomic bombs we are God's weapon of warfare we are God's judgment sword on the earth the spirit is upon me for he had anointed me to bring a word to you today oh give the Lord some Praises oh we in the spirit this evening we in the anointing this [Applause] evening you may be seated hallu hallelujah hallelujah we speak to you amen because we don't want the day to take you unaware like a snail it will trap people upon the Earth those that are unguarded those who are not Vigilant it will catch them like a trap set for an animal like a snare to gather all men on the Earth but you are not one of those you are escap escap ones you escape the pope you escape Rome you escape denomination you escape false prophets you escape interpretation you escape men's idea and now you are in the Holy Ghost slot of the seven tunders to utter the voices to you Hallelujah you want be seated if it is then the pyramid is kep by the seven Thunders you remember the pyramid message it's a Capstone what did it do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual amen and sealed it when we have added Faith righteousness godliness and so forth we kept adding till we got seven things and the seventh one was love watch and then watch that's how he makes the individual he caps him and seals him with the Holy Spirit then if that be so if this individual is kept and sealed with the Holy Ghost what does this individual have if that be so then he has got seven Church ages that he had seven Mysteries that have been sounded away and they fought to bring them back and The Headstone come the cap of the church does the Thunders mean that my brethren Hallelujah SES where we are at so we find out the seven Thunders kep the pyramid is not right praise God God talked to Moses Chicago listen to this and I believe that the age has come now amen the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit and power and signs and wonders this great outpouring of God's spirit in the last days that's the thing that will bring Faith into the people that will take a rapturing faith that will take the church into Glory you heard what he says the baptism of the spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the thing to bring Faith into the people and seven Thunders gives Faith so seven Thunders is the holy spirit I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you then the same seven Thunders that caps the pyramid that's the thing to bring the faith so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the thing to bring the faith into the people therefore the seven Thunders must be the holy spirit because the seven Thunders get Faith and the Holy Spirit gains Faith so therefore the tunders is the Dynamics in banic form in word form super sign that when light struck Rebecca she knew something within her that brought her to Isaac she veiled her face she wanted no more to do with her own thinking Isaac was the thinking from then on and the church itself here we go when it strikes the power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost out of the international churches out of the Catholic Church wherever it is when the baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real to the people them that's predestinated like you people here to life sees it and walks in it what's it a super sign that's right and you possess the gates of the enemy so the baptism of the Holy Ghost has to be made real to the people rising of the sun he came to redeem or to bring to life those predestinate seed of God that he seen before the foundation of the world and put their names in The Book of Life so he put their names in The Book of Life he come down on the earth and looking for those seeds he's a great Shepherd looking for the seeds looking for sheep he had sheep in Trinidad so the great Shepherd had to bring the seven Thunders from under the seven seal and throw it over this island to see them seven tunders pick up the seed because the seven tund going to gather the bright together seven thund to give the bride fith seven thund going to UT the voices of that group The Seven Thunder going to show how to prepare those seven Thunders had to be loose seven perfect Spirits across the whole earth to get every predestinate seed it's the great Shepherd it's the great holy spirit it's the great Elohim moving brooding like it was in the Garden of Eden when cross Darkness cover the earth and the spirit of God move upon the face of the water and God said let there be light oh come on now come on now God said let there be light it was dark Hallelujah I want you to notice the darkness didn't intimidate God God didn't hide his PR but it's so dark I can't see anything that God they was intimidated by the darkness and Isaiah Isaiah said cross Darkness cover the Earth cross Darkness covered the people but the light going to come the light going to shine when God saw the darkness the Bible said Darkness was upon the face of the deep but the spirit of God move upon the face of the waters the spirit of God and the waters which thou sest at the multitude of the people the spirit of God begin to move upon the waters and when the spirit begin to move upon you you're going to hear the voice of God that's why you got to get in the spirit that's why you got to worship that's why you got to honor his name that's why you got to press your way you can't just watch and stare you got to watch and [Applause] praise listen to brother Bram he not only come to be a blessing but to share the blessing with every predestinated seed oh Hallelujah now the mystery was the seed was always in the earth you hear what I said in Genesis the seed was already there that was a hidden Mystery Darkness was covering it and once Darkness covered the seed it can come to life it make light to bring it into a manifestation so the word manifested brings light to bring forth the seed as long as darkness is covering the seed they can't produce anything but when God roll back the darkness when God rolled back the darkness when God rolled back the darkness you're going to hear Let there be [Applause] light and that light going to strike that seed inside of you oh Hallelujah listen to this Jesus he was God's first corner of wheat that have been raised from the dead Hallelujah the first corner of Wheat by God's quickening power God has Quicken his life rais him from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the first sample the first taste of others that could to raise he was the first fruits of them that slept and that's why they had to wave that Chief because it was the first one that come to maturity it was waved as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest of them would come so in the Old Testament when you plant your crop and you get the first Chief come to maturity you take it and wave it before the Lord it like a wave offering Lord more is coming yes they ready yet but they're coming they have all the potential but they're coming they in bondage but they're coming they're looking for a breakr but they're coming they fall here they fall there but they coming because this is the first one that come to maturity and if this one could make it all the rest could make it if this one could overcome all the rest could overcome if this one can have power all the going get power oh the first one come to maturity was waved [Applause] how many see the power of love God waving see that's why oh this is good that's why Jesus had no fight to tell the disciples what they need to know and what they not prepared to handle as yet he watched them and said the same works I do shall you do also and these guys have all kind of spirits on them they don't even know what Spirit they of Jesus so let this now if you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you say they can't touch that yet but he hit it on the Promises it he's just hitting them with it that's like algebra you're beating them with it and they don't even know mathematics and again algebra because it belongs to [Applause] them you see all what God is he poured into Christ and all as Christ he poured into the church so everything Christ did we have potential to do it's just you don't know it yet it come like you have amnesia and you forget your name you forget where you're staying you forget who your fire is you forget what street you're living on and you don't know and somebody know where you belong and they keep telling you walk here keep on walking here that's a 5old Ministry it a strike you yet if they hit you yet you're still dazed because the devil bump you on

will that you have to die up to so you could be sweetest Christian you hear in Psalms Bible every day you going to work you're just staying in the spirit backsliding as ever because if a man don't work you kind forget about it so you could stay there and you're waiting for wrapped in the bush somewhere on some Mountain by yourself somewhere Hallelujah still a self-will isn't that right so you have to want the will of God that's right you say s of course Jesus had his own so when get some hit him so he said Lord I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming that's not in the Bible I'm coming true I'm I'm coming to you say I'm coming no he said if it's possible let there a serious thing this is not going to a picnic this is going to a cross that's you have to make up your mind if Jesus wasn't sure he said God just give two month on that two more months because my mind not ready yet but J say if it's possible let this go pass if it not passing Lord give me some time God how many you run on Calvary Calvary Street this way every other street that you're looking so you're looking so is that his way you're looking so but so is Calvary but you're not focusing so you're looking so you're

so in order for enough to steal it you better start to build it you have to dig the trench you have to put the pole you have to put the post and so on and the iron mix the cement pour it put foundation but that's the same thing inside of you that's a building a holy building God want to build that in you it has to be formed inside of you and the trial of your faith stop complaining the trial of your faith stop complaining the trial of your faith is more precious than gold and God love to see you in the battle God has get excited I know you run sometimes I know you get scared

knock on Heaven's Door let God know you are not satisfied with you let God know you need a transformation in your [Applause] life Oh Glory Hallelujah Glory hallelu Glory Hall Glory Glory Glory Glory how many want a transformation in their life oh my my my my my my hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God hallelujah so Jesus was the first fruit of them that slept praise God he was waved over the promis SE that have life and watch he was waved on the day of Pentecost and there came a song from heaven so the son of man came and then the Spirit came Hallelujah and wave over them and each one got their Pillar of Fire they wasn't just in the atmosphere the tongues of fire settled upon each one of them so each one of them had their Kingdom had their fire had their portion had God failed and that is what is Promised pillow fire back in the church who is the church you are the church tell her fire back in you and when you have fire and he has fire and she has fire and I have fire and that fire come together that's the pillar of fire that's the bride prise God goise so says and it be wave again we realize to Luke 17:30 Hallelujah in the Sunday again the son man will be revealed now watch who is the son of man in the beginning was the word the word was but God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us am watch and that word again is wave over the people here we go that the Dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right Among Us and is giving us life so I'm showing you right true and true praise God that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what is Promised judgment was Fallen all over Egypt and if you notice now ministers you may disagree with me on this but before the Judgment started hit in Egypt God sent Israel to Goan they were in Goan no plague fell on them a perfect type of the church carried over through the tribulation and The Last Enemy the last plague that struck the Earth was death now this is something we may Overlook listen to these words and The Last Enemy that going to strike the church is death spiritually speaking those who will not follow Christ in the baptism of the Holy Spirit Will spiritually dry up and die Hallelujah and that is why I am against any teaching any doctrine that quench the desire for the holy ghost in the people any Doctrine Any teacher that quench the desire for the Holy Ghost and the people is Antichrist it is false it is demonic that's right because any church that don't follow you with the Holy Ghost will spiritually die hallelujah hallelujah why you say that because Isaiah prophesied that God Darkness cover the Earth God Darkness covered the people Darkness taken over homes Darkness taken over ministers Darkness taken over churches take Darkness they are blind leaders of the blind they are not seeing they can't lead the people because the light is not there when you turn down the word you walk into darkness oh Hallelujah but arise and shine thy light is come and the glory shall be seen upon you Isaiah didn't talk no hidden in you the glory going to be seen they're going to seen see your glory your cup going to run over go your table in the Pres of your enemies you didn't know you had enemies right of course you have enemies you think you think you're nice you don't do nothing wrong you know enemy is that right then you don't belong to God you belong to the enemy if you know enemies but once you are Son of God every devil in hell is against you the devil going drop on your son on your husband on your wife on your uncle on your aunt on your neighbor on the boss on whoever God ever will jump on them try to mess you and tie you up Hallelujah that's the devil job he come to steal to Rob and to destroy he's a thug he's a highway robber my God you have your joy devil come and hold you up steal your joy Jesus frustr you let some accident happen in your home this happen you're breaking up you're broken up you're in tears and he say good good good that is where I want you when you're messed up like that you're in your human Spirit but Jesus and brother Bram seem to have the mind of Christ for every situation so nobody could throw them off because they're dealing with the intelligence you see I caught something when Samuel went to anoint David when Samuel went to anoint David he didn't know was David God says one of the sons of Jesse that's how God does think God can to tell him David is the man thank you just go down there and pour the all in him God but how you look praise God Amen Hallelujah God like how things is looking how you look he just just PA and David my God tell us my Jesus on the contrary he didn't want to go at all because he say sa here that so will kill him God tell him listen just tell them to come to prepare a feast and invite the house of Jesse M so go around the whole thing just just make a spin around so when the first man come when them ad or whatever his name is man he's put his put cologne on forget it he check the mirror and fix his tie say good Lord the anointing coming put his tie and he walk out there with a little buns and Sam himself saying this had to be he so is a Harmony going on there he feeling like he and Samuel think is he but when the intelligence dropped down God said no that's not him because God doesn't see as man see God now this is the problem because man sees a certain way that's right that's right so he was teaching the prophet Samuel you have to have a discernment don't go by out with the parents and how the cologne smelling and how his tie is well fixed matching his shoes and matching his socks don't go by that but go by the inward part of the heart you got to be in the spirit to discern that so when when when Samuel caught it he said I check them out now on the inner man not him not him not him keep on walking praise God keep on walking next Hallelujah next Hallelujah next next when the last one pass he said wait a minute all done thank you Lord he said I ain't get no witness he said you have anymore praise God man they say yeah we have one David he with the Sheep he he he's a little Shepherd ah Hallelujah he he he he seen about sheep he say send for David I wouldn't sit down until David come amen when David come David stink up David smelly David have no cologne David Young David looking so out of it Hallelujah God said this is he now now these other guys know they passing test they know they pass through they know they failed they know they didn't make it so they can't with what God had to do now so God say He Man Samuel take the whole on and just pour it on David we call it oil down he just could get the whole oil or just go right down Hallelujah just oil him down David don't even know what going on David just o what is this David going back to the Sheep David is now anointed king hallah now watch what is happening in the spirit realm that's right the same hour that's right David anointed that's right the same hour evil spirit come upon Soul amen amen GID gift is predestinated to pay the har his gift is predestinated to run them demons so when Saul get his upset and his problem they say we know somebody skillful in the have this is sent for David and I'm telling you they're going to send for you come on now I I want to I want to kind of finish off here eventually they're going to send for you so here come David David playing hop in his castle David playing hop you not hearing what I'm saying Saul don't know the kingdom has all been removed is only a matter of time you see this is what the devil didn't care to for he thought he we could cut off in the 70s but Jorge he thought we going to finish in the 80s when the ' 90s hit he said we not going to make it but here we are 2014 and we just as strong as when we started out oh Hallelujah lah just as strong amen am praise God God doesn't see what man say thank you Lord say Lord don't use my eyes Lord use my heart give me the discernment oh that's why you're supposed to look at the person motive and objective what somebody want to achieve oh Hallelujah so my God hallelujah praise God praise God Amen God provided a place called go and there was coming a spirit of death upon the land that's what I was scared of all along to be caught up in a spirit of debt where people going to church in formality they going to church because they have no place else to go it can't be that Jesus I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly that come to you to exist and struggle and get fight in church all you come to the church and get fight in the church this is a place to be empowered this is a church to get your sword this is a church to be sharpened this is what the house of God is for praise God praise God praise not a bunch of confusion when you finish from the house of God you supposed to feel empowered as a father when you go home to your children as a husband when you go back to your wife as a wife when you go back to your husband you supposed to feel empowered as a daughter of Sarah as a son of Abraham yeah yeah yeah as a priest of the most high [Applause] God having the ability to bring your sacrifice hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus so then you're not depending upon some Pastor or some elder or some Deacon you understand by Revelation that he didn't come to be a blessing he come to share the blessing you understand by Revelation when the lamb took the book didn't take it for himself he wasn't feeling bookish he wasn't feeling to hold a book he like book he like to read books it wasn't about that it had names in the book he wanted to release those names those names were in captivity those people didn't know who they were he had us to release who you are and you are the word you are the germ you are to be released from the thoughts of God by the word of God my I don't know Hallelujah I want to finish off listen to this a word had to be created thank you Lord a thought Hallelujah is in the mind of God hallu a word had to create it God said let there be light was a word seed and that word could have remain a thousand years but all of a sudden that word have life in itself all of a sudden that word manifest itself and the word produce light that's the word being Vindicated that's the word being manifested the word have to be Vindicated in order to be light people can say what they want but when the light is made manifest when the word is made manifest that is the light say it again brother the word itself is not the light the word manifested that is the light so when God speak a word to you that's a word to you but when that word is [Applause] manifested that's the light that's the light oh hallelujah oh glory to God watch God provided a place called Goan there's coming a spirit of death upon the land death is the reason we die Israel had to have something to keep them from dying and it was the blood over the door death God could remove the deathu it was sentenced it was the penalty was released that angel itself was released by The Geral to take out anyone who not under the blood God had no jurisdiction upon anyone who was not under the blood he said when I see the blood I'm going to pass over he released a death angel to knock out to kill everyone who was not under the blood and the Seven Thunders is the blood of Jesus the seven Thunders is the blood that God has covered all these years that's why we are [Applause] alive do you understand without the seven Thunders we'll be reaching six seals on our way to the tribulation and know it not hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but because we have a blood because we have the fullness of the atonement not just the atonement but the atonement in it fullness Hallelujah blood in it fullness and in the blood have the life no blood no life no blood no anointing no blood no power no blood No Authority the blood give us Authority right now we don't even have power but we have authority by the blood we have confidence that when we speak we speak through the blood there is no sin when the blood is dear because the blood speaks better things than the blood of Abel the blood of God speaks faith in your doubt speak weak virtue in your weakness speak knowledge in your ignorance it's the blood of God over your life it's a pyramid in your soul it's the word pyramid in mechanic form let me try to finish off here oh hallelujah oh glory to God listen to this bum when spiritual Darkness gets upon the Earth it is time for the enemy to attack the devil is bong yeah when the spiritual Darkness come upon the Earth it's time for the enemy to attack watch we see fearful sights earthquakes tidle waves Falling Away gross Darkness hey High minded lovers of Pleasures watch that's what the world is pointing to but the church has another sign a blessed call out sign he promised here we go he promised you want to hear your sign you want to hear your sign he promised that there will be line in the church the church spiritual in the last days he would pour out but the former and the latter in the former in come first the latter in come second both former and latter rain in the same season he promised it so what I'm supposed to look for some man coming no man could bring a Revival if man could have bring it we had it already it takes the people to bring the Revival you got to know who you are all right [Applause] oh my here we go Hallelujah the sun is the word of God in the beginning God said let there be light and when the manifested word here we go when the word of God was manifested there was light first God spoke it what if it didn't manifest then it wasn't light yet but when he spoke it and then it was manifested or Vindicated his word was Vindicated light come into existence and that's the only way it can be done now is when the word is Vindicated God's written word Vindicated it shows light oh blessed be the name of the Lord do you believe that Hallelujah pise God gross Darkness blinding of Israel was for the lightning of the Gentiles now the blinding of the Gentiles is the lightning of Israel God blind the Jews that the Gentiles might see now God is about to Blind the Gentiles that the Jews might see cross Darkness have to come Darkness have to cover the people but a missst all of that Darkness there's going to be light oh Hallelujah light in your life because the spoken word manifest is the light coming to your life oh hallelujah praise God praise God good people caught up sincere people watch like Mary and Joseph they were sincere they were presuming Jesus was with them but they miss Jesus isn't that right and there are many preachers people put their names on the book many thought they were sprinkled and confirmed baptized in father and Holy Ghost but the fact is he wasn't there what is light question the Vindicated spoken word of God outside of that there's no light it takes God word made manifest How can there be Darkness and Light it can't be dark and light together they can't Fellowship together and the Bible said and God separated the light from the darkness and the Darkness he called night and the light he called day so God has separate the light from from the darkness he don't have mix up light and darkness he just separate the light from the darkness so once light start to come he have to separate it and light do push back Darkness that's why the darkness has to have a Revival the darkness have to be pushed together when the light have to come something got to move people who never come together they have to come together because light is pushing light is coming as the light coming the darkness of the gather together oh say Amen somebody because the light is coming oh Hallelujah what's that light that's the morning Starlight that's the light of the uncoming sun reflecting upon the stars of God him that overcometh will I bring the morning star and that star going to reflect the light and as the sunlight hit that star you are that star and as the sunlight hit you you're going to reflect the uncoming son you're going to reflect the coming of the Lord oh give the Lord some Praises people oh Hallelujah Glory the darkness is separating it self from the light God is causing it the light is doing it God is causing it the light is doing it the light expressing itself in such a way until the darkness has to congregate together they had a chance to accept it and they won't do it so it condens itself so today we are now living God has to come on the scene here we go now ah let me hit stretch God has to come on the scene to vindicate and prove his promises it's the light of the hour so we can Rise and Shine the light shines upon us today the word is being manifest that is the light oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah just a few more minutes again and we'll be done this is important the world had to unite Titus this Roman general had to unite his armies together after these Jews rejected the god-given sign to them Hallelujah oh praise God that's the time Titus United his army together and come to take the city there had to be a uniting of God's people soal against the word of godall so listen before National Force come in effect before the Press come down it has to have the people in this message fight the true word in this [Applause] message everything is hinged upon the inner battle let me read it for you oh Hallelujah God watch this Hallelujah they rejected him turn him out crucify him Lord when they rejected the Salvation that was sent to them they United themselves together hold that in mind United themselves together to reject the message of the Y they had to do that and when they did that then the national sign come in what did says National Force will put the world forces in the the church in the work of churches like the power of God will put the people in The Bride you understand what national force mean government edict like how they have all these sodomites in America right now if they pass that as a national law federal law it means to say you cannot deny marrying those characters because that will be contrary to federal law then they could shut down the churches they could close that down that because that will be the law amen that do with God's law that is man's stuff amen and God see that as Sodom and gomor repeat right hallelujah thank you Jesus just like brother say Martin Luther King had a community Spirit upon him and will cause all the RS all to die and people to die and stuff where I'm talk about that or what happened now that seed was so in the 60s look at coming to harvest today it's a spirit so therefore all the riots whatever it is is a spirit coming to a harvest the sodomites is a spirit coming to harvest what about the bride Hallelujah every seed have to come into a harvest Hallelujah and that perfect man statue have to come to a harvest Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah there is one like musician come on please there is not Methodist Baptist PR Christ is the light and the light is the life and here we get it from and the word man manifested is the light of the hour Hallelujah last quote praise God from Ephesian Church Ag and I'm done hallelujah but St you could come to the side he a let them hear what the spirit said in the churches how tragic it is that this first age did not listen to the spirit Hallelujah instead of listen to man but thank God in the last age there will be a group rise up the true Bride of the last day she would listen to the spirit in the day of cross Darkness light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ that's my final quote God bless [Applause] you

remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me Hallelujah for as often as eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not
