in the spirit pray in the spirit shout in the spirit breach in the spirit moving into a channel oh my god a man amen the Prophet said we put too much emphasis on the mechanics and we have that for 50-plus years but we are actually transitioning now into the dynamics we are coming out of that time of lingering which was prophesied by the Prophet a time when things like static just like nothing moving but you just under the anointing of the spirit of prophecy you're knowing t'en of promises because by these promises you become partakers of His divine nature so god bless you and greetings in the precious name of Jesus is such a privilege to be back home amen and amen attended the funeral service service of sister Coleman and I believe that it closes a great chapter in Brides history I truly believe their turn I I just talked a little bit see how it goes today Haman so sit down relax you come to church ah before I start the other finance I'll just read it from second Timothy 4:1 is I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing at his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine why for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou in all things - until afflictions tree do the work of revenge list for make full proof of thy ministry so that is what Paul was tellin there's quite an experience of Paul the Apostle to be going through all these stuff with the early church because there were some serious issues and challenges that had to be dealt with and to be met so he went to the funeral and ministers give just some money and I I I didn't get any guidelines as such I guess we put thought that I got after what was the theme and so on like that and it seems like I went outside of the team to see what I said and I understand somebody made a clip of it and it went viral and people said oh watch it on what not or minister and train that hijack the funeral service and so on like that and said his stuff something like that some people were very unhappy some people offended and I'm I didn't mean to offend anyone and some people were pleased so six of one half a dozen the other it doesn't matter with me really what matters with me is what God puts up on my heart if somebody tell me I can't see this I capricious and somebody has Church I'll respect that but if there's no guidance given I will always speak what is upon my heart and there is something coming to my heart about Tom when you go to court they ask you do you pledge or swear to speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and there's a reason why those three things are involved what the first part means are you going to lie don't like tell the truth now if it's telling the truth make sure is the whole truth and nothing but the truth don't act it and send truth a different way so it's the truth don't lie the whole truth and nothing but the truth and I remember thinking 2012 in New Yorkers preaching I was talking about facts and truth sometime the fact is not the truth talk about a car break down and you see somebody coming out of a bar with a container and they say yes I seem comedy rump shop but his radiator over overheating and he went to get some water to plan around it no the fact is he did comedy rum shop but what is the truth was he drinking rum shake a go over the report he comedy rum shop I saw him I saw him any other contingent is on the boot but that's not the truth so that's what the court want is the whole truth so don't just take words and that is why the Bible have safeguards it said do not receive an acquisition against an elder unless there are two or three witnesses and these witnesses must be tried before they even give witness because have liars I have a lying spirit an alliance for it cannot speak truth actually a lying spirit volunteered to jump on 400 men that lines break direct from he'll say he volunteered Gordon pay him body invite him he did he let me go permission please to jump on all of them the prophesy a lie that the Word of God will come to pass hallelujah and God said I desire truth from the inward parts God desire truth from us it's just very interesting experience and I got some emails both negative and positive but I would read a positive one for you I got blasted don't worry I thank them for being able to freely communicate with me I I will take hit mills angle meals whatever it is and I'll respond I have no problem with that i'ma just cool one second praise the Lord okay so I want to read this one for you but strange are two of the brothers who wrote me negatively and offended and upset and so on they seem to be saying something that is so strange they said the revealing of it is the vindication of it because I was dealing with people claiming to be the Holy Ghost see so the revealing of it is the vindication of it the season is now not written as you see what are we waitin for what vindicate some ministry is revelation on the word whether it be a prophet or the Apostle I am the Holy Spirit revelation is the vindication of the ministers who preached it now that is so I mean this was so deceived that they actually believe that our revelation is the vindication they're not saying it has to compare with the rest of the word but the revelation is the vindication but any I'll read it to you and so on I said arm this person says I now find myself god bless you richly okay I don't know if you know me at all this business writing I now find myself as part of 7,000 that were the cool months that are all day under the Seventh Seal of life under them pushes out there and are now beginning to come alive realizing that all the lies that was told etc the Holy Spirit told me last week to go to the funeral service and act civil towards the people and that it would Electrify I had no idea how profound those words would turn out to be and the subject he hadn't in a subject line was electrifying your words of pure inspiration was such a comfort to the very few of us still standing you have no idea how much they meant to us we were all in agreement that the seven thunders would get yet have to gather the bride together and they are the bride revival and we'll wake her up again and sure how to prepare in the time of life revival and the manifestation will be the interpretation thank you so much for being fearless your powerful exhortation and a few words totally revived our expectation for that David to finally come on the scene and prove the seven seat on the spot and the sheep of God will come screaming forth no false anointed will be able to hold him back no kind of way thank you and God bless amen praise the Lord so I just want to tidy up what we spoke about before leaving when I speak about you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free because the church was hijacked and before that you it was hijacked or the person was on the clip say that I hijack the funeral service but actually I was typin that brother Coleman's wife is also the church and the church got all messed up and as a reason why it was messed up so I wasn't just taken sister Coleman as such but I talking about the condition of his church because children not even in a church today and something is wrong and it's a reason for that external outside influences has affected the church and I was talking about the word sovereignty sovereignty means no outside influences this church is a sovereign Church nobody can tell us what to sing one not to sing what the priests not what to preach this is a sovereign church and the reason the Prophet wanted it that way and the Bible have it that way is that no bishop will come over the people I remember we went I while we were six people in Cairo and I better tell me some kind of thing I see our children suffering easily only our six is sovereign six sovereign people [Applause] we Ord for Burrell joins Riley was there and what mentions a bridge fry or day if to fly is two more remain and I preached that to the accent and that's all about George Lucas rissalah Sandhya that's right I am on the word I am NOT this side and that side I'm on the world I will stay with that word hallelujah so he passed as the money just gonna be free this morning because he saw the man set me free already who the son of man set free it's free ha ha ha indeed so I came to the Lord 975 baptize nothing February 15 1975 after which I used to go up in the hills and love until and the empty houses abandoned houses as they once seek the Lord and pray I had a hunger in and distant for God I remember one day came home my sister I was stealing my sister that time and her daughter I think we got her was one year old or whatever it is in the crib and I was seeing that room she had a baby daughter and I closed the door forgot she I was sleeping I closed the door locked the door not begin the crowd and seek the Lord an explosion of white light came into my life that was my first supernatural experience with God but talked much about it but after that experience the presence of God was in my heart and I had dissonant I'm telling you after that experience the world's from the spoken word books used to quicken to me it's like I feel like it coming out and go inside again just like that that's how it could in so much that was 17 years old in so much that I talked to the pastor and I told the pastor I am NOT being fed no this is a holy man you know you like your beef you steak rice and peas a hungry man coming hungry the income for conflicts and milk you come first seven course menu they come for the real deal so I was telling the pastor I said I I find it when I read the book somebody ran and he's speaking prophetically he's freaking present tense he's preaching about the past but but what you give him it kind of short I said but I am staying here because the word says don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together so I wasn't moving anyway I'm staying there so if I could get whatever getting I'm taking it I was in February March April May and May but Coleman came to Trinidad and I went to the meetings was dontcha bonus and I listened and I bought record but what he spoke was the truth and I receive him as a servant of Christ and I receive what were spoken about these seven thunders got any bright together and seven thunders we should have I talked to BP and seven thunders we'll give the back feet I went back to the pastor very excited see will you preach what that man treated in who is was his name didn't even stick at that time he said you have to consult Billy Paul I see Billy Paul I said but the man quoted what the Prophet said let me know he is not going to preach what that man preach then I told him I'm gone we're going I don't know but certainly not staying I've I walked out what age 17 years old and I began to look for any church that preaching close to anything that that man was preaching to and that is how I end up in the church that I was in years ago and stay there until things unfold and remember I'm saying these things that give witness of how things unfold in my life and maybe never share this with before and I want to speak it and so on like that and at that time we were about Lopez was the past at a time but 19 I was under him and then things didn't work out well for him the church brook and then we went up north and Brian was my pastor and then he used to work next door to me and so on one day the Holy Spirit told me when he moves from next door make high with your home church then but a nicer Brandeis that but nice was abundant in church at that time but Joseph's in Cairo I spoke to power nights I said don't tell anybody I told him and I told butter George said don't tell anybody and I my diary I've been dark 1981 diary right inside the office right now that he could read hope things unfold because those days I said write down everything and then everything what the Lord spoke and everything else and a couple of months afterwards they move him out move the Holy Department out then I make I well my home church that is how I end up there by God speaking to do that then remember Tim brother George was there at night in Cairo well in a prayer meeting we know if something you don't know why all is a guy will have no lights like these at the pump the gas lamp but you're smiling right now sometime ago by the well to get water and yeah just a walk not even bicycle it has to walk at the walkie how much mr. Granger two months about two months walking two months and one night prayin and a vision Brook and I saw a book come down and that book marked the second coming of the Lord and that was a message that the prophet spoke so I got the book went into the book when we found that spot when we say when the church finds is Bradley love when the church finds his holy decency when the chief finds is pleased in Christ and so on and has told them I said this has to be revealed and God brought a revelation of brotherly kindness but George is our witness and so on the spirit poured out and what that was quite an experience for us God vindicated a revelation by your point of his Spirit and that is how I came to claim this revelation orderly kindness not in 2010 in 1981 nah 2010 1981 what give me a revelation of early kindness so I know trillion aliens and trade that gave work women a hard time so when I went to the States for the first time was 1981 to 1981 only 1982 but I kind of didn't 981 but but uh mommy took me to him and he said I want to introduce to her brother they'll have a testimony of brotherly kindness and I came to her home and I we met and greet later on he told me that when I was walking towards him the Lord told him join yourself to that man laughter no I do understand that but that's what he told me later on as he would know in a testimony and so on he said the Holy Spirit told him put butter over than the meetings and training because I have a work God has a work for him to do and that is how being muted and so on so I want to see this to you I went to New York by revelation with revelation I will say it again I went to New York by revelation with revelation when I was invited to speak in 1989 I was a manie's and the Lord spoke to me and says the manifestation of the sons of God that was my message and when I came and I preached Burcham I said that was the inspiration he had I didn't consult with man I didn't ask anybody and since that time he has never asked me what I'm going to preach what is my inspiration it has always been free whatever God put up on my heart and the inspiration that have been among us is what I take to this foreign things and so on well no I get messages on this front of fields and a plane wherever doesn't really matter but are trying a point to you that God speaks what have a voice gonna still talk to people we were in Cairo while we build a small wooden church and then after a while the Lord spoke to me that we've been sonic Randy where we I know when I told the people that they are come after all I said nobody believed that I say well even if nobody that doesn't change it if God said it it will come to pass well you are sitting down right now Oh what God said [Applause] I didn't write down all these things so resting just sequencing in my mind right now Sunday flippy and preparing and sauna but might not be in order so I just shame with you what God didn't son like that so I share this before what division what 30-plus years ago of this thing where nakum was to kill me and my wife jumped down and block our sister was standing next our pasta on top the platform people are looking for it to die then you just waited for this monster to finish T of it off as I seen a plane just look at nobody I'm moving I went under it looked she jumped down and come between and I knew it was spiritual I know it have significance the sister was not in my church so when she came to this church 1993 I knew she had to go back this is vision this is behind the scenes now 1999 see what what he went back and a witch and proceeded monster common 2000 1 2 3 4 5 here it comes and I knew was ought to take me the cut a long story short I was off the fields for 6 years 10 2009 the Lord spoke to me he said you'll be back on the fields I didn't understand till this year that it meant that whole seed was over and you the church was represented by my wife and Marie so you the church that's why I love you and appreciate you and value you you are the ones that stood between me being destroy because when that happened in 2005 I thought that was it I was ready to join the sponge and then my wife ah this is good when Gore column an he call his wife I say it again when God call our money call his wife if that man have a place in this stitute to do this work he has to have a wife in position and my wife said stay focused that spiritual lady that God gives me stay focused and as I talked about that lady let me talk a little more when a lady those brothers long time they want to pick wife for me I won't pick you if I know what I said do do that you see these women working inside of here I say go go provide by for me begin to pray and she came by vision also and I wasn't fooling so I said she comes in sound like this god bless you God bless you God bless you I said look at an office and one day when it broke my dream about her I said lord if you this sisters to post my wife revealed to her that I am a husband not knowing she already got that so she was looking at me so we came together by inspiration and revelation that is my rib sitting right there I'm just telling you when guac Holliman he call his wife so so so so so this is it okay so Lord told me I back on the fields let's fast-forward it now 2012 but I Hardy who built the church came and I had personally that D that he died I was on my way to service I don't know if I talked about it I wounded with the breach but God put upon my heart a message to preach about dispensation of another Ephesians who put it up on my heart God put it up on my heart he gave me the message he gave me hope identify Hobart a woman a cold but a paneled message trauma divided and he had his own inspiration about himself his family and church is not the same thing it's two different things don't mix it up and I did that okay so no calls no invites nothing at all but the Lord said you'll be back on the fields and if God said that he can't lie go to tell stories before they come to pass it's a wrong spirit so I got an invite for Ghana I said whoa Anri there it is and then afterwards but a furious impasse safari that it wrote not we resigned that they booted out he invited me to preach in New York a Sunday or Wednesday and come back a Sunday Sunday in New York go to Pennsylvania he went to preach come up with Sunday and okay leave out something after preach that message amazingly after I preached that message the Lord spoke to my heart he said this is to go out to the bride I can't explain that I have no invites nobody has invited me but the Lord told me that God can't lie if God speak it has to come to pass so when when I was invited to go New York I know this is what had to be spoken there so I preached the same message across there without consulting flesh blood I'm telling history I do have a telly storm I told you I want you to know from this pulpit here I don't want you to hear not an outside people tell you at home outside you're hearing from the horse's mouth give another live and direct I'm not whispering dinner whispering Pastore no I don't do that I don't talk to people people behind the back as a gift not to do that the gift that I have is the look people treat in their eyes I'll tell them like it is I don't take no machine gun can equip it and I don't do that i will stitch it down and use it straight to your head I don't want to make no mistake I don't want to make a mess taken a bullet fly on somebody that not supposed to fly on no I don't do that one on one that is me okay be behind - roughly know my goodness pray the gordium is soft three three the charity the bond of perfectness you see because I can take his smooth slipping I wanted real hallelujah because we fight in a real devil he is slick and smooth so T of it what you see is what you get like it was his brother his pastor but this Minister brother when he talking ly talking normal normal when he gonna put bit Lord God anymore twist so once you guess what trouble is this boy like he's a different person it's a one person you talking normal normal we recommend a pulpit we will tune intonation change and whatnot what kind of scary thing is that I know I'm stepping back and forth talking mature in enterprise before I accept pastorship and I was voted in the past and 1982 okay I'm preaches is 1979 it's a long time next they're gonna be 40 years okay in enterprise the Lord shared some stuff with me concerning money woman and popularity the Lord show me to stay with the world to watching the Lord deal with my concern about do not impersonate because if you impersonate you will die you will know who killed Lord kill me which one don't imprison it and the next in a lot of optimi is about adoption adoption is not based upon the people's so this is not people's choice this is not I love my pasta he's the best man named Tony best thing since sliced bread this is not that this is between father and son so that is why I have never been swayed by people whether it's to where there is mm because when it come to adoption is not the vote of the people yoky a vote a man in position please and Christ you cannot vote a man to be in a fight fool that is not your vote in God after place a man there a man was trying to climb up in the spirit realm and Brahm said only got to put them on there go back down and testify to the people don't try to climb up we're gonna put you or glory decor because when God put a man in position nobody could take that man Oh Oh get the Lord a shout Oh hallelujah glory to God that's why the bow is the promotion doesn't come from the east and the West it comes from the Lord or glory the government got promote you no man could be more chilled when God raised you up no man could put you back down these haven't heaven then go to hell or get the Lord a shout in the house I'm in my own church now all glory remember Jason hallelujah we are at home right now we have the liberty to say what we have to say and we understand Oh Lord God give us a voice to speak Oh glory we go to speak the land of roared the not spoken you can but prophesy Oh hallelujah give the Lord a shout Laurene Oh God what child we belonged about over Judah as he tried I said that were in the east okay where we had long so I'm in the New York and preach people rejoice and shouted and hungry for the message and so on like that and then the storm was coming so I'm sandy I believe it was I was the lead the next day I said no way my esteem running at the rented car I'm worried up at got a phone call but in England didn't like the message that I preached way message the Lord who tell maybe on e-fields the Lord and I know what appreciate and this guy didn't like the message I said okay I will talk to him when I get to Pennsylvania when Irish Pennsylvania I'll give him a call I said I understand you didn't like the message of the preach I didn't know what he didn't like it in it I said uh-uh we have become too arrogant we have become too proud I said the Lord did all of this to see what's in our heart the humble us and to prove us in it I remember talking about Isaiah when Isaiah got in the presence of God he said woe is me Isaiah's it was you he said woe is me I spoke about when I'm uncommon the presence of work to have one effect on every profit on every messenger any person going into prison it's not one effect it has make you feel like you're nothing silly young nobody nobody ever gets in God's presence and stock up on the trust nobody I fell as one death [Applause] could we give the Lord a show that's what John did listen John was me Jesus John Jesus and John eat Jesus fish and bread and all everything else but when on the Isle of Patmos when Jesus come in his glory he said I fell as one dead why put a pranam in that vision broke he was packed in the corner he said you know about the power of God you don't know about the power of God little bubble dancing this is a fearful thing to come into the presence of God Isaiah saw the train of the Lord High and lifted up dangerous fine back and foot holy holy Lord God Almighty the whole earth is full of your glory high in the spirit he will always be I'm undone I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell among people of unclean lips for my eyes I've seen the glory then the voice of the Lord said who will go for us there is a here am I send me Oh Gloria caught but the other confess worries me maybe they didn't like that I don't know so I call him I say brother I was really talking kahi and gruntin the other end of the phone that's it brother I will not let any man on it tell me what to preach I said the three wise men one bought frankincense one bought gold one bought myrrh they brought the revelation that God give them but together it make a message God a service to die yes no what was the inspiration I tell them suddenly coming Sunday never came because it crash the other two services because of this storm and that was it and after that I was cut off from that signal no problem hard to meet one of his surrogates and another brother in Pennsylvania and they I began to talk to them began the Ark's I'm about the condition of the believers that got run off the believes that had my bachelor's the believers that were weak that was my concern I said how will new name help them how will pitch your for help them help them I'm live begin to say this story and what not so then began a talk a certain way I said well this church is suffering and Warner Brothers hit the bench and said that's consent we should not go back to serenity it will break the unity then I know there were plumb off the world because without sovereignty there can be no unity we must be sovereign because the early church the reason the church failed listen listen listen the reason the church filled is because they take the anointing from off the people and put it on a man and put it on a holy order and then eventually come on a pope now what is the argument Catholics have Peter gave the keys they don't know another scripture no he is the first pope I'm if you had iki he could ban me recipe books because he has the key what a flimsy argument in the beginning was the world was at with God in the wood was gone so this is how things unfold and after I preached in New York there I got quarrels I got our people interested and invited me and so on like that and that is how it kind of spread around whatnot so to go Ghana no I I was going on everything is fine and so on not knowing I got a call to go Haiti around the same time that goes somebody else and go Haiti and so on I said no not knowing this brother he offered to pay for the whole convention in Ghana but I must be out of it and this is you know and totally brother but over it not coming to Ghana again he's going Haiti so yeah please set up somebody to call me to try to get me to go to Haiti - telling you this is it this is this is politics now I never bring politics before but I bring in how did this work out there and what you have not been hearing this is 2012 mmm this is stealing this is very still you know this you can't even hot this bread again this is stealing but this is just for informational services of the kind of war and battle that behind the scenes so when you come here and you see me on fire is fast it's all kind of dots and arrows and and so dr. Cain you know oh yeah mine but anyhow so this is how it is right now so we come down to New York now and people Clemente sovereignity I went in a sovereign Church and whatnot and a new church already hijacked on sight people don't take it over for passes the night that they had a whole story sending emails to the back of the rebels that was any Church yeah I need them no the changing locks and it you know could email somebody she looked at you Tonica get us outta here you have to be dreamin that's a nightmare for you think about it think about the gang inside here change them to smoke I said I got myself here you'll be arrested I would change in love before you so this is the kind of drama that was behind the scenes manipulation lies and some and all this stem from the false prophet anointing that was released as a lying spirit spirit of error that was loosed and that bring an error in doctrine now you hear me talk my new age but people so lazy didn't check a lot what were we saying what does new is just teach and so like that but I want to bring somewhat of it today though I want to bring you some other photography that you know that you are not the Holy Ghost you not God so anyhow I think I wrap up with this you know this is a letter lower send but I am shocked by this brother or just couldn't get some highlights and I'll just read it and read but a gave us response allowed Clues all of this because I want to get out of this god bless you my precious brother creatures from England need as I say I'm very saddened by your recent message in New York and your decision to reject the tree for revelation something which of course came as a surprise to me after you had helped to bring the inspiration alive with the school of Elohim logos and bride is he well until his brothers is thus they unsubscribed to this false teaching they were warned subscribe to it and they press the button unsubscribe that was the sin of the pastor day he unsubscribe from false teaching and orchestrated a kick-out nevertheless boy it woulda be nice if you would call me which are concerns before certain our cause to divide the body of Christ nevertheless I respect your decision and right to follow what you believe the bitter - inspiration I was disappointed that you didn't come in love and try to help me and other ministers and a bride to treat not what you felt had gone wrong instead of cutting yourself off from body of Christ around the world that has moved together for so many years okay let's go Freda and this is but I give a response there better call his name thank you for your email and he caught from first Corinthians 3:12 about Paul's talking about everyman work being tried if any man would shall be burned he shall suffer loss for himself I received I know ye not you are a temple of God and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you okay so watch so then he says here in regards took the concerns you're talking about I did not feel led to call you my brother I went to seek God's face concerning his leadership I always consult the Lord for his leadership whenever there was a change of temple or important decision to make he always led me in my 47 years of Christian life just as he did when I went through the heavy trial with Brunel who was in my church for seven years however all along my Christian journey I always observe people's behavior and when it comes to a minister I look at the way he steers with the word and the life he lives before the people I look for Christ's character to see if he will stand the test of popularity woman and money I always watched that because as you know my brother we can't judge a man by his gift and the anointing that's upon him and the number of followers he's got no matter how much vindication he claims to have from God this is no sign indeed last month being invited to preach in New York by butter theory the paths of the church dear I preached what my Heavenly Father put in my mom to see I proudly stood for the Lord Jesus Christ I stood for Malachi his father's message friend or no friend I stood for one of the oldest time-tested members in this message when nobody stood for him I also stood for the truth sheep of God India I did that mine at all to go against the grain my brother no matter what people may think or see when it comes to the Word of God I never compromise for popularity I am Not Afraid of men they haven't got a heaven and they haven't got a hell and I gladly exhorted the new your brothers and sisters to stay with their pastor that's all because I know the man to be a true Shepherd the whole world knows but if here is a true servant of God a man has been trained under the Apostle ik ministry for more than 50 years and whom God has used my to be since but Akuma sleep atcha indeed that god-fearing pastor stood with Gore from the beginning humbly serving his people the man was tending the Sheep of New York Church while God's apostle was on the field all these years let me tell you my brother that it was totally outrageous that those brothers did the pastor theory these past few weeks besides it was totally disgraceful on your behalf to have encouraged was brothers to take authority over their posture and go behind his back and solicit people to vote him out they sure acted like juvenile delinquents nor church can vote a pastor out except for a moral issue that's what we did in 90s and mythix when we found out that the pastor was a pervert who would have dared to step brother Coleman down when he started to heat the buna lines and sanctioned those writings on the wall has been of God obviously those brothers did that with a selfish motive according to the intellectual and legalistic we not according to God's own nature and we are doing things but God is not mocked God is not going to bless what they did they leave you me to go around and try to turn people from their god-given pasta and then telling the whole world that brother Fiore simply decided to resign even the website is thanking him and in resign and so on that is not the whole truth add in sizzle I was not the whole truth but if is not equal to design this is totally out of order brother unchristian like and preposterous I sure remind me of this conspiracy of Absalom in the book of Samuel brother by encouraging them to act like that and to conspire against their god-given pastor you are the one who was set a course to divide the body of Christ if someone is not happy with their pasta they have to they only have to leave it respectfully and go somewhere else that is all but the go around calling people even go into their jobs and pressing them to have vote their pastor out such behavior is low dong shameful very cheap and you know it what a Steen on the message for over 40 years go into all the pain Harris conventions I've seen many forceful preachers that preach like Archangels great gifts of God in were part of the disability of the fivefold ministry which I sure respected some of them are being ordained by God as a puzzle but I said to the church when you go to a department store when you see a display in the window shop it's not necessarily what you're gonna buy inside but we know that the manifestation of charity will tell that they will declare it when the members of his universe are bribed and very few members of this fivefold ministry will be adopted it will speak for itself in the meantime it is our behavior that sets us to adoption not what we see from our mount or what we pretend to be oh my hallelujah so then he could from Tottori unknown to the pastor but I never remember he's a full head of the church but I never has a right to exercise any authority that the Holy Spirit would anything the Holy Spirit would tell him to say in other words in the church he has a right to anything that God would lead him to do he can have a right over his Deacon board he can change the Deacon board the trustee board the pianist any office in a church he desired a change and feel led of the Spirit to do so whatever he does I will recognize it because he's a godly man recognize it to be of the Lord and will sanction the same deer for it gives them the authority to operate the church so in those 36 years which God allow meet by His grace to be close to a friend who goes apostle and to be on his ministry that's perfectly the way I saw him handle things in his own local church and he taught me to do the same if needs be in my own church he would also choose himself his own deacons and present him to the church that's just the way he taught me to do and all those who have been on this ministry know very well that's the way by the Coleman applied to his order throughout many years of his pastorship and to add to their lead link when behavior these brothers change the locks of the New York to its building which according to the law is totally illegal what did he do that for the lock but a fiore out of the church indeed I am very disappointed at you my brother to me this is poor discernment I don't think but a Branham would have been happy to see that rude and improper behavior more my brother it appears that the way you are talking about the body of Christ it would be a closed circle of ministers and brothers and sisters who absolutely share your spiritual views I do believe that people can be part of the body of Christ even if they don't see things exactly the way we zoom and butter Brannon said some people will have access to all the tips I will never make the rapture while some will have heard just a few tapes I'll make the rapture Paul said do I have gift of prophecy understand what mysteries all knowledge do I have all faith to move mountains but have not love I am nothing it's not the end okay and then he closed off but this third story that you know about the man who went gold hog huntin he got his goal he had all these nuggets he said tomorrow he's going to convert it into cash gonna convert it and he gonna have his whiskey and whatnot he had a good faithful door you have danced and so on and his dog was back him dog back in backing he went to the door open the door says shut up the dog wine he was tied to a leash he tried to warn his master because men come and bandits come at him and he went back and laid on his bed the dog started back and again he call him after shut up I don't want to hear you I want a lovely dream tonight of the good times I'm gonna have tomorrow when I cash in my goal and finally dog back again he became angry you reach in the corner but a double-barrel shotgun went to the door with both hammers back shut the dog down to death he said that will take care of you I don't need you anymore anyhow set the gun down will lead on his bed folded his hands with his dream fell off to sleep just another wire the door open easily someone slip across the floor plunge a knife into his bosom took the gold and lifted it what do you do he killed voice that was warning him let that not be your stand that voice of the Holy Spirit that warns the church day after day we see the protein watch man watch of the night watching over inheritors you'll give the law some praises all glory to God you love the Lord let us turn is that one a sound in your sing a song I want to change Europe service that's my comments for the name of [Music] oh man Oh ha ah Oh bah [Music] shut the power Potter yeah share the power [Music] [Applause] Oh Halloween and the glory shake somebody one more time greet someone if you say [Music] [Music] again god bless you if ever Bibles alig return the acts 1:8 ephesians 4 11 to 16 acts 1:8 one scripture do thank you musicians prison name of the Lord glory to God that's 1/8 but he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and the uttermost part of the earth next scripture and he gives some apostles Ephesians 4:11 and some prophets and some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ here we all come into the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make an increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love less bore his father we thank you for your word may you come now and breed life and presence and fire upon your word speak to our hearts and transform your people here to be more like you and Jesus and we ask it amen and even you might be seated oh praise God hallelujah or something and no heresy and it just slipped me because what this guy is saying now is that the local pastors because they have the own faith or a 5-footer enough being tested and tried and so on the local pastors their job now is to point the people to the International angel with the faithful and if they don't point the people to this International engine with this fifl the people have a right to over to him so that is where this guy leaden I'll say this he preached a message years ago that caused Burke woman a lot of pain the message in title was the international crisis local reflection and he was trying to present the voice of the Archangel New York and that's why bakoma had a big big war and the people say are we seeing voices like Angela what not but what he was saying is that they're like headquarters and every local church supposed to reflect that and Burke overharvested spending years I went to defend and trying to show Christ is the voice if you got injured he tried to make and dist it tried to make him that and it was so hard so no it flip here's what he didn't know I spoke to him years ago and he was young and his ministry and so on he didn't know but a corpsman asked me to talk to him I never told him that I suffered him al cafe in London with some English tea an English cake Satya Eton and I began to talk to him I said brother branham said a young minister should keep the shuts off of him this is what I learned this is what I know I told him I have never preached a sermon that anybody ever came up to me and asked me what do you mean when you see that why did you see that I have never preached a message where there's any controversy because I try to see with what the prophets see and even though I don't quote by the book is I still try to speak it so I begin a shared for him so I told him why are you a New York business why do you want to be New York business and you lean forward and say why I shouldn't be and afterwards I had no more to say so that was it I am in no church business I am in nobody business I will try to over Church nor Church I have never proselyte one prison I've never done it we don't have no need to do on the contrary you know me Odyssey if you don't like Italy exit every exit sign right there no fight we want people that want the word want God won't what you read manifested you don't need a bishop you need the Holy Spirit and the last time I read Christ is the head of the church the last time I don't have a change now but the last time I read in Colossians Christ is the head of the body called the church I don't see no man is he head I always walk ahead I am the head of no church he told Peter upon this rock I will build my church so Christ have a church and that church is the body that touches the body of Christ the church is not the head doesn't make sense you have a head this is the body disconnect if anybody else you have that is why Jesus said I am the vine you are the branches he said you have to be a true to me but if you think you could go on your own he said without me you can do nothing so you better stay inside the vine in order to produce fruit way of oil since when you become mine since when you become caught dead where you're going a

spirit guides used to be speaking to this dimensional column spirit guides spirit guides and former that each individual is God and she passed along the wisdom each individual is the Holy Spirit she pass along the wisdom that the person is unlimited New Age thinking has its roots in Eastern mysticism which attempts to bypass the main the organ they have to die spiritual eyes and whatnot and they have the belief that all is one one is all history is not the story of humanity's fall into sin it and it's restoration of God's my saving grace that's what we know man fell in sin and God by you come and save us rather it is humanity fallen to ignorance and it's the gradual ascent into enlightenment that is the gospel enlightenment watch there is a change of consciousness listen listen listen if we are Holy Spirit we need to know we are Holy Spirit if we are God we need to know your God we must become cosmically conscious and enlightened and attuned to the Cosmic Consciousness someone reaches and like the status will claim to be born again listen a conquer feet of biblical conversion so that is why all the movie stars and all the people like the new age thing because new age you have to repent because after all I am God our movie stars in the same day I am God who else see so watch the Ascension is not whether we believe on meditate or but whom we believe in no one but jesus said no one comes to the Father except to me so the new ichthyologist a super conscious creative integrative self organization mine that is part of our purchases that constitute our court likeness that have no Bible doesn't that new haven't report no scenes at the break manhattan's tell you that and you walk out here ballin i am i am holy spirit root montgomery this is supposedly channel a spirit that spoke to her claiming we are as much God as God as part of us each of us is God together we are God white steers listen that sooner or later every human being will feel a call from the cosmos to ascend to godhood I'm almost done beaten Baha my Louise declares there's only one question and once you know the answer to that question there's no more to ask Who am I thirty question answer that and question does only one answer I am God after that you have no more questions to ask you done she'll be McCain recommend that every person should begin every day by affirming his or whom god would you can use I am God I am Holy Spirit I am that I am as Christ often did so that is why the pombe Nam said sit sit I have Holy Spirit and understood him a cleansing when you see it an anointing comes over you just see it so you see what they're doing here they're doing affirmation I am Holy Spirit he said the Indians I call up the common India Hinduism did I say I am that we we were saying I am that I am I am a healer I'm the liver and so on they don't say it so did I say I am that I am whatever that I am is I am that to cerebral I am God so that's why the religion of the repentance in it that is not the gospel amen I'm almost finished here now with this so you can you I am God I am I am I am as Christ often did or you can extend the affirmation to fit your own needs you fit it away a wonderful special revelation need not exist in books or in any form outside of us because each of us has our own special revelation of consciousness and our own ability to get in touch with a part of us that is God so the grant is individual the power of determinants reality by creating a co-creation truth with a powerful statement creating own reality but all appreciative make the selves our own God not the god of the word this quarter debatable judge America will not be great again that is a lie that'll come in the pass right now this definitely bums the center America judgment is about to strike America people make mockery at the prophecy over the Brenham about seeing the cars without steering wheel this week corn here General Motors announced that the cars coming out next that within five years we'll have no steering wheel but her mom was a true prophet he said this have to come to pass before Jesus come again this has to come to pass before the seventh vision war is coming next what's the use we come and you're not getting prepared what you should come and you're not be made ready you come not to hear you come never get information you come because you wanted me ready because Jesus Christ is coming back hallelujah boring a good one day all those people that have been deceived but I am the Holy Ghost one day there be a midnight cry behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him [Applause] and all those who didn't see the self as lamps to get oil to go wake up with a minute you mean I do have the oil yes you don't have the article you claim to be Doyle already so if you are the oil reacts in the oil for you then pray for you I this is what you're supposed to do and say Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost because the Bible says you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost if I did not say you are the Holy Ghost you are temple you are house you are building that God want to come and live in oh my hallelujah Oh glory to God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus Oh glory to God so this is the free sovereign independent church and people who feel I have God I have no right to come benda what that I was associated with this treat for all all these years since 1975 yes so I was part of this whole movement of or being blessed by all these Bridal promises exclusive by the promises but a Panama only Reed is here for me similar spirit are we no I think is a good thing for us ministers to follow our order when we see things in the world on we see today we have an order from God who is for the zenon of spirits trying the spirits and I believe that is a very great lesson for the church today is to try the spirit of anything have discernment of spirit I do not think that we should ever judge a person by the denomination they belong to by the group that they are some little bit whatever we are we should never judge the man by the denomination we belongs to we should always judge him by the spirit he has the spirit whether he has Lateran for marine inner in altering Noreen we should assume the spirit watch what the man has in mind what he's trying to achieve if the man buy a gift listen no matter how great the gift is I want you to get this to the church this morning which define denominations you are still the treat of Living God different people I tell bridging all the time I don't expect everybody to believe the way I am I am Mina certainly I am built a certain way I don't expect every Minister to be like me I understand that their ministers have different characteristics and the people could work with that but I am Who I am and you have to understand that this is how God made this O God make you you have your own individual fingerprint nobody has a flaw fingerprint that is yours and you should rejoice in that you don't have to copy from anybody you have to be like anybody else you want to be placed in Christ hallelujah our individual in God God want to bless you you have to get your Mountain you have to possess your inheritance everyone is given my measure I measure our faith a measure of grace fight for your measure you need your measure you want your measure no man should drop you from your measure so always 5:45 was another title I want to get us corrected fight for Zara title fivefold ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ it's not my ministry and about over ministry he's a five-o minister no it is the Ministry of Jesus Christ because what a bottom said I wish I did pyramid here he said in these virtues the building could still leak it was not sealed with charity so all these virtues faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance all these things have to be sealed in Paul call charity the bond of perfectness like this cement to cement the whole building so you could have shared virtual knowledge he said instant leaking out so you need charity to add to all these things but you'll have a things then that's Christ in you the hope of glory he believed that Oh glory to God so the messages and it's a particular quote I love the coat when Rama sprain in the prayer he said me these mysteries be revealed to show the plainness of God that we might know how to behave ourselves so the mysteries is not revealed to us to have argument I have a mystery your mystery my mystery method on your mystery another foolishness the mystery being revealed it's the shorter plainness of God that we can know how to behave because your adoption is based upon your behavior their host rights will be adopted sisters gonna be adopted brothers gonna be adopted yet is nowhere that prophet said he said the world will bow at the feet and melon woman who crossed Jordan or get a lot of shut doors woman not on the faith or ministry but those woman went to be filled with God Oh hallelujah we gonna some godly woman there are some godly Sons what put you in his evil issue overcome he put you because you know you could overcome it he put overcoming inside of you it's the outside is inside of you before Bellanca come david was gonna get that stone that spoon was already here you ever stood for you're glad every call out in your life there's the spawns that every force in your life Oh God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen so we are not divided we are stones that's cut in different forms I wish I had the pyramid here because two things I wanted to show you you see one reflect the age like fate read Paul virtue unison it doesn't mean that paulownia fate you know if you believe that is cuckoo Paul had the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost consists of two seven spirits she's not Paul it represented an age so that is right at Holy Ghost rut represent the bride age because the seven ages in this age is hidden mystery it's a bright edge under but but in in virtues now all it in virtues that holy or is the Spirit of Christ by ramesses coming into the church to manifest the virtues [Applause] this is what cause people have seen nobody of the illegals because I see the holy goes at the top it ma Holy Spirit so they said nobody have the Holy Ghost because the Holy Spirit is at the top this is like a revolution but the Holy Ghost is from the bottom to the top [Applause] do we have the pyramid you go victory yes confer get a stand for me I want I want to shoot up put in screen okay fine let's that's great when they puts it up on the screen you go see it when you see it because two things involved they're watching it from the edge perspective and watching it from the the the natural put the human perspective the individual perspective you see one saying so if you look at it from the ears procession and you mix it up you can say we add the Holy Spirit because eNOS left my Holy Spirit and we nothing loudly sir we in the Holy Spirit but what does that mean that means we are the Holy Spirit so Paul is hidden I realize were children your honor Sampson and they represented seven spirits but these guys have some fiat authority Paul was adopted B that was adopted they were vindicated sons they were speaking the word cast no Devils [Applause] [Music] oh there we go okay all right so here we have Paul Aranea smut and Columbo Luther Wesley pan signature this is representing the ages it doesn't mean that brother Branham only had brotherly kindness so he's broadly kindness he was adopted he had all these things here this l.o.v.e is not even charity when the Prophet reveal l.o.v.e he said l.o.v.e is Christ corporal body under Christ is his spirit [Applause] do you understand that now so if somebody get mixed up they go screw up this thing big time on the Christ corporal body is his spirit coming into the church to manifest these things these things have to be in you okay the Lord our show these things iron you because the secret is the word is enterprise give the Lord a shout or get the Lord our show Oh hallelujah both glory to God feeling inspired now Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God you may be seated praise God thank you lord hallelujah glory all right [Music] what a what a Brandon say but a Branham says no we see this is from to the Exodus now we see the wheel in the wheels moving God reads plan moving up to get the people lap in the land again into a place in a position we could bless them remember they have to come out of the land they were in to get in the land of promise before the promised Messiah had come and the church has to do the same thing get out of that Koopa rejecters over into the promise before Messiah and ever be manifested to them everybody in churches that reject the true Messiah inspiration after come out to see Messiah but this is the part of when I get to the life of the Messiah manifested making a church ready a bride not mistress being preached but the life this is a life here hallelujah brother Branham was so much like Jesus they took him for Jesus okay the Lord a shout he was walking like Jesus he was talking like Jesus he was manifesting Jesus the life of Jesus have to be manifested or canceled or - oh or chlorine or God the life of Jesus must be manifested to make the church ready Old Glory does Gordon and hallelujah let me see said I'm from census this time but a Brenham might be closer than you think it cooked me scared haven't done enough where are we at time shall be no more he unknown to that time is over what happens could that be so if it is then the pyramid is kept by the seven thunders if it is the pyramid is cut by the seven thunders so no but a Branum put the seven thunders as the Holy Spirit how could that be because all these seven things is inside of you know hear what he says he called the elected Lutheran's to make the West viens he called elected Westlands to make the Pentecostals listen now we call the elected penny custer's to make the headstone which is this what here to come into it this lock is part of the temple this lock is part of our house he's making a billion for he to step into it then the head the next of the body

why I preach and all and kind of take this morning or glory hallelujah hallelujah oh my hallelujah praise the Lord thank you lord there are so many people just by the gifts that they have I believe these things are gifts I believe that we see take place as gifts their god-given gifts but if we do not use them the right way that God intended them to be used then we do more harm with the gifts than we could not reach without a kiss the other night I made a statement on the pulpit saying I would rather see bradlee love exist among the church if we didn't have one kiss or divine healer this is important to this no before I got to remember Deaconess I had odds against people who mistreated me and so on when that came all that leave so I could rough you up and still love you I got whole notes I could rest on the floor and roll over with you and when we come back we shake hands you praise my brother before when I finish with you I am looking at you I don't want to talk to you because

over to this drop it you see what these brothers have done they have short-circuited place of trying so what they do is like Jesus when Jesus we see the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost early into the wilderness Jesse not new I couldn't wait to be temple to bring some mystery from Isaiah 60:1 so Jesus bypass we just dramatized in just bypass he will do this for the chapel the spray is upon me for anointed me after he recognizes he has no no engine upon him because that anointing coming after a pastor wilderness because to overcome lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and the pride of life so all who don't want wilderness listen but a brand didn't escape it he lost his wife he lost his daughter he lost this he lost that God take him through this wilderness and later on in life he said he was

a big name so other people would look up to him as a big person that's wrong maybe he's trying to edify a certain thing here that he wants everybody to get out of the picture and let him and his group in the picture that's still wrong so I meant to come and tell me I they look to some internet in international angel located in London I wonder what I'm partnered our angel Renton I really want to
