and to worship and to praise God and to get into the atmosphere and to show the devil who's the real boss praise God he thinks he's the boss but we're going to show him who's the boss this morning amen amen well we have a title this morning of a title is an exhortation to you this morning and uh we in Revival mode this morning I don't know how much of you how many of you heard this morning but we in Revival this morning praise God say it's time to get your shouting shoes on time to put on your spiritual jackets this morning amen amen and get into this revival Hallelujah my title this morning is Every Man Press into the kingdom of God and my inspiration expectation brings preparation for the promises of God isn't that right well it's impossible to say that um let's say You're Expecting Christmas to come it's impossible to say that you are in the Christmas spirit if you are not buying something last minute if you're not painting the house if you're not cooking a pie or or baking a ham or or getting something ready or buying a present or or just just being Jolly just for no reason because that's what the Christmas season is all about everybody is just smiling everybody is just happy everybody's just in an atmosphere the World Cup is an atmosphere you don't know the person next to you but as soon as you start to talk football they start to talk football and everybody's talking about whose team's going to win and who's the best team and who's in the spirit of it well if you're in the spirit of Revival you have to be doing something about the Revival you have to be praying you have to be under expectation you have to be in the anointing you have to be looking for something to happen you have to be looking for something to take place that's the spirit of Revival so we don't come in no ordinary spirit this morning we come in the spirit of Revival because we are expecting something because we are looking for something to happen we are looking for something to take place and I don't know about you but I didn't come all this way just to warm a church bench come on now I didn't come all this way just to warm a church pew no no no no no Hallelujah that's not what God called the church for God raised up the church to cast out the works of sin and the only way to do that is in the power of the spirit so I want to raise up in the power of the spirit this morning for such a time as this for now we the sons of God oh hallelujah hallelujah say Amen if you can say Amen if you can oh how you raised up for such a time as this oh hallelujah hallelujah somebody Shout with me somebody praise praise God with me let's get into the atmosphere because in the atmosphere of Fai is where the Miracles take place in the atmosphere of faith is where the baptism of the Holy Ghost is issued to every man that believe oh hallelujah oh praise God amen amen amen oh give him a shout of [Applause] Praise Hallelujah H Every Man Press his way into the kingdom isn't that right you have to press that press that word press is a verb let's go back to primary school and every verb is an action word you can't say you're pressing and you're not doing anything about it you cannot say you're lying to me you're lying to me if you say you're pressing and you're not praying you're pressing you're not calling on God you lying to me you got to be pressing you got to be doing something about this word that was so graciously given to us Luther didn't have this word Wesley didn't have this word the Pentecost didn't have this word Malachi 4 came and restored the fullness of the word for one purpose one purpose that we could press our away into those virtues oh say Amen somebody hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's impossible to say that you're pressing and you're not doing anything about it to whom much is given much is required Hallelujah isn't that right and Perfection is required in this day and if Perfection is required we cannot settle for anything less than perfect in this hour God don't want to hear it oh hallelujah hallelujah you either have all the virtues or you have none oh H some Pro for some bring forth 64 some bring forth 84 but some are going to bring forth 104 God wants 100f fruit more fruit and much fruit oh hallelujah hallelujah every branch that bring forth he pures to bring forth more fruit and much fruit and who don't bring forth fruit he'll be cut off and cast into the lakes of fire there's only one group that's going to make it and one group that's not going to make it I don't know about you this morning but I want to be the one that made it tell me about the one that overcome tell me about the one that crossed the river tell me about a one that went over hallelujah amen [Applause] Hallelujah human behavior it's so easy to spread negative this thing tastes bad boy yeah you taste it why you want to taste that for serious it's easy to spread negative easiest is thing is to tell a bad thing about some customer service experience or something that happened to you it's easier to tell a bad things it's easier to see the bad things in people and it's easier to highlight the negative I don't want to hear about the negative this morning I want to hear about the positive I don't want to hear about the ships that wreck I don't want to hear about the accidents I don't want to hear about this that happened that I want to hear about the ships that made it I want to hear about the ones that overcome I want to hear what reward they got for their hard labors I want to hear what reward they achieved when they overcame this trial and this test that's what gives me courage that's what gives me motivation that's what gives me a press in my heart and I know that I can make it it's a positive light against a negative Shadow oh give me that positive light this morning that positive light is Jesus Christ the same yesterday the same today the same forever oh Hallelujah and that positive light is here this morning to meet your need you may be seated Hallelujah Glory GL GL the word press describes a certain kind of a struggle come on now a grit a grind a constant upward battle I love preaching this kind of message because it's real to me because I feel it every time I wake up I feel it every time I go to bed my legs are sore I had a long day but but tomorrow is another Journey I'm just going to take a little rest until tomorrow because tomorrow is more pressing tomorrow is more fighting we are fighting a real enemy but Bram said don't tell me the devil is not real I fight him every day don't you tell me the devil doesn't exist I met him face to face praise God hallelujah I know who I'm fighting I know what I'm looking for praise God amen amen the devil is real young people he's trying to kill you he's trying to cut you off before you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the devil is alive because there's a prophecy hanging over your soul hanging over your body hanging over your spirit the devil could watch but he cannot touch the predestination that God put in there and if God put it there the devil cannot take it away I don't care what he does I don't care what he says he cannot take it away oh say man somebody amen young people the devil is 6,000 years late because when Jesus died on the cross you are on his [Applause] mind oh hallelujah hallelujah blow a trumpet in Zion sound an alarm in the Holy Mountain let the men weep before God in sack loot but we're going to have a Revival we're going to have a Revival the sick will be healed the dead will be raised up the cripples will walk the blind will see the gospel will be preaching his power [Applause] Hallelujah we got to have it we're desperate for it we're hungry for it we thirsty for it 40 plus years in the desert no rain no rain oh God send the rain we need the Holy Spirits we all backsliding children oh bring back the backsliders bring back the young people restore the man of faith in the house of God bring back the Weeping bring back the all night prayer meeting bring back the crying out before God bring back the sick being healed bring back the blind sin bring back the dead praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah we come to mean business this morning h [Applause] oh shall we pursue shall we pursue let's pursue the enemy let's go after him and take back everything that the devil took from us take back all joy take back all peace the seven tunders is yours that's your promise that's your [Applause] inheritance hallelujah hallelujah keep your Motors huming something could break this morning now we the sons of God it do not appear what we shall be you might feel like it you might smell like it you might think like it but you're going to be a Son of God you're coming on to something when the baby is first in the womb it doesn't look like a baby people say it looks like an alien but it's coming on to something it's forming the legs are forming the hands are forming the feet are forming every day something is happening and every day something is happening to this church every day something is happening with this people look around you this building is different we are getting ready for the Holy Ghost we are fixing a place that the angel could come and be pleased to move among the people and baptize Souls into the kingdom of God by fire oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallu oh hallelujah it's a battle of wills whether you will whether you won't God set up the situation to see what is in you see what is in your heart if you go forward or if you stay where you are it's easy to stay where you are cuz you done already made it here why go on more but God got to put a thirst in your heart to know that there is something more so he give you Revelation which is foresight which is Vision that gives you a picture and when you look at your present condition you realize that the picture and the present condition is not the same then therefore there's a more glorious picture before you so forgetting the things that are passed and look into things that are before I press towards the mark of the High [Applause] Calling Hallelujah my God That's The Power of Revelation that's why Jesus said the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against Revelation because once Revelation strike your soul you will never be satisfied with anything outside of God and the entirety of God's promise you want all of it all is mine Hallelujah Joy is mine peace is mine the Salvation is mine the Holy Ghost is mine I want that pillar High moving In and Out Among Us that's what I want to see that's what I want to feel when I walk into the presence of God rainbow spirit rainbow flashing around the prophet was that rainbow spirit that same rainbow promise is promised to be among the bride in this hour we are going to have it [Applause] Hallelujah let me continue hallelujah hallelujah you can't fight until you're tired you got to fight until you win cuz if you don't win you'll die Hallelujah so you got to win because in the winning is triumph in the win in his life in the win in his victory in the win in his where get character character Hallelujah is not a gift but it's a victory it's something you overcome and the only way you could overcome is because some test was GI to you to show that you overcome it's not right God can't just push you through a pipe and pull you out to the other end you didn't do nothing he just pushed you through a pipe hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right but random said the only way for they found for a chicken to be born into this world is to pip its way out there's no other way to do it science has found no other way they have created airplanes that can fly at Ma two speeds but they still don't know the Mystery of Life that is hidden in a blade of grass brother brandom said so isn't that right and they found no other way for a chicken to be born in this world than for him to pip his way out but the B said if you pick the shell of the eggs off of the baby you'll kill it he has to press his way he has to fight his way he has to struggle his way out praise God of his situation out of his circumstance out of where he is into where he wants to be oh hallelujah praise God and you Eagles this morning we are pipping our way out of our shell because we were born to fly we were born to S we are not staying in this egg praise God silence is only for half an hour but after the half an hour silence God is about to break the Silence with a wonderful glorious manifestation of the Holy Spirit [Applause] hallah Hallelujah scientists theorists psychiatrists they all agree that once your mind has stretched to a certain Dimension it is impossible for you to go back to the old Dimension once you have experienced something new once you have experienced something different you can't go back to your old ways you can't go back to your old thinking to the old beat of how things used to be no no no away with that this is a new season this is a new day praise God we like Elisha this morning as long as I so live it I will not leave the I got my eye on the promise I got my eye on the prize I got my eye on the target [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah isn't that [Applause] right hallelujah hallelujah hallu we skip over here to Something in I had something about oh hallelujah oh here we go I was doing some research about a special kind of fish this fish is called a rainbow trout a rainbow trout remarkable creature it's a special kind of fish he said that when it's time for this trout to reproduce and lay it's young it cannot stay in the environment that it was accustom at wherever that fish used to live wherever that fish used to commute that fish can't stay stay there no more because he's pregnant with something he's embedded with something it is burdened with something it's burdened with precious seed and that seed have to bring forth and that burden is now upon the mother fish to go upstream and to lay her eggs she has to go against the tide she has to go against the current she has to go against the grain of the normal beat it's easy to go Downstream because you have the support of the stream and the stream is flowing in a certain direction and everybody is going in the same direction you don't even have to swim it's like going down a hill with a car you're not even mashing the gas you're just rolling going down but this Upstream thing is a different thing altoe this Upstream thing is against the current it's against the tide sometimes it's two steps backward sometimes one step forward but mama I got to make it because there's precious seed and that's how I feel the bride is this morning she has precious seed oh H the seed of the promise is laying in oh and she's going Upstream this morning flashes of rainbow trap this morning over doubt over fear over cont contrary Spirits over who don't want it over who sleeping over who tired forget about it you our rainbow trout this morning you've got to make it you've got to overcome we've got to get to Higher Ground hallelujah hallelujah they say she can't lay the egg in that lower stuff in that lower atmosphere the water is not clean enough it's all dirty with the debris and the drust that come down from the waterfalls and things like that so she goes all the way up the Rapids going up the higher stream what's she trying to get to the crystal clear water she's got to get to that crystal clear water that water of the Holy Spirit she's got to get to it she's got to make it there she's got eggs those eggs have must come to pass and that time and that season and I feel another season come around oh Hallelujah a season of manifestation whatever seed is inside of you the rain is about to bring it to life and those seeds must come to pass in their hour in their season hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my God my God hallelujah all right let me go back here now to press that's what they're talking about right to press means to push past the obstacles that may be in your way in order to attain a certain goal that is set before you the definition of the book d uh dictionary says to move in a specific Direction by pushing the only way to move is to push the only way to move is to press you can't move when you're standing still it's very simple you can't move forward in prayer Hallelujah if if you're not prayed up if you're not amen anointing the scriptures if you're not pleading the promises of God if you're not getting in the spirit if you're not going around higher around higher around higher oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right am Hallelujah that's what required of us hallelujah see cuz we want things to come easy we don't want to work we live in a generation now that word work is a a strange word you get so easy isn't that right the other day I I remember talking about going to the coffee shop and normally people get my coffee for me but this one is different they had a dispenser there and I was able to access coffee for myself I love coffee and um I put the cup there and I press the button down come the coffee hot water everything and I said my what an age we living in you push your button and you get it a long time ago you know older ones would talk about brewing coffee and waiting a long time getting it just right but here it is that they just push a button and you get it that's the age we live in it's very easy to get things send something down from Amazon get it l just like that isn't that right internet Shoppers and oh the world is just crazy it's fast-paced people don't want to wait anymore instant chicken instant coffee Hallelujah but God's kingdom and man's kingdom is to different kingdoms where Satan have for you everything to get easy God don't work like that God don't have spoiled children God will just give you what you want because you want it and because you ask for it this way no no no he test your attitude to make it to wait to see what your real desire is if your treasure is in the thing or if the treasure is in the thing you can't see that's where he tests you on praise God to see what you really made of to see if you're really willing to go on even without this thing that's why the Tre Hebrew boys were so inspired it wasn't about life or death for them that was irrelevant what was relevant for them is their stand they wanted to go down on record as the boys that took their stand they wanted to go down and testimony as the ones that took their stand against the king and what he had to say and they gods and their Idols that's why when the king say bow down before the idol they say we're not going to bow down and even if our God does not deliver us we still not going to bow down it's not our living it's not about dying praise God it's about taking your stand with the word of God whe I live or die sink or drown let this life living me oh God is my prayer hallelujah praise God amen amen oh hallelujah hallelujah and when God speaks to a man when God inspires a man he could only talk the same way because is the same anointing upon those boys the same anointing that was upon brother branam is the same anointing that'll be upon the bride live or die sink or drown let this life live in me let these seven tunders be banging in my heart 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 oh youah I promised it this morning hallelujah hallelujah Malachi 3:6 I am the Lord and I change not isn't that right so many things have changed around us but God Still Remains the Same his word Still Remains the Same and his ways still remain the same and there's only one way to enter into the kingdom of God and that's to press into it you can't py your way into it there's no amount of money you could spend there's no amount of treasures you could have you can't take it with you the Egyptians try that and they died and left their Treasures behind but you have a kingdom that can be shaken that kingdom is going to be in you that Kingdom will be the word turned into power and spirit in your life oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh say Amen if you [Applause] can Hall word is not in one only but it's in power and demonstration hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah gospel is not a word only isn't that right but it's in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost we want the full gospel not just the word but the signs accompanying the Wonders accompanying the Miracles accompanying Gideon cried out he say if God be God and wear out the Miracles that where is this great God that I heard about that Moses talk about and Joshua talk about they said he opened the Red Sea and they said he hail the thousands in the in the in the wilderness with the brass Serpent and they talk about the bitters Waters of mam being made sweet by the tree that was thrown into it I want to see that same God I want to meet that God for myself and not another I will not be satisfied with just some old story I want to meet that God tonight praise God amen amen amen hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah Isaiah 558 for my words thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways your ways sayth the Lord so forget your thoughts this morning they are not God's thoughts forget your ways this morning they are not your ways Hallelujah there's a way that seem it right unto a man but the end thereof is death you might think you're going in the right direction but it take the word to show you a different way it take the word to be a lamp onto your feet it take the word to be a light onto your path all of the else is Darkness everything else is amen not the word everything else is the devil just playing tricks at your mind but when you get on the word then you're on the right path oh isn't that [Applause] right oh and we on the right road this morning it's always good to know that you're on the right Road sometimes I hate being lost I hate being just driving around and you don't know where you're going and you ask this one how to get to this Bypass Road and they don't know and you got to stop by somebody else and they ask them and they say they're not from here and they never they not move here for two weeks and they don't know the road so good and you go around and next person and they don't know where it is and you're struggling to find your way but all of a sudden you meet somebody who who says I've been here 60 36 years and I know the road by hand if you take this right you you go down to a little way and if you meet a track on the left you can take that left right there it'll take you to your destination praise God isn't that right it feels so good to find your way again and I believe we got lost somewhere along the way I believe the bride got lost along her way but but we met the right person at the right time we we came into contact with Jesus Christ the same yesterday and he pointed us to the way he pointed us to the word and said if my word abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you and praise God hallelujah oh Hallelujah so we on the right road this morning this road will take us to Glory this road will take us to our destination oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right wonderful h his ways are perfect God has a way isn't that right he has a kingdom a kingdom that is set up it has a king it has a domain it has a throne it has policies it has an attitude it has a whole concept of thinking and idea and structure amen and you have to deny your way of doing things to come into God's kingdom to come into God's way he has a way of doing things isn't that right he has a way of dealing with his sons come on now he has a way of dealing with His prophets he has a way of dealing with his teachers he have a way of dealing with his pastors and his ministers he have a way of rebuking and correcting and instructing oh you can't be sofy sofy in this Kingdom you got to get pearly you got to get a broadback you got to be able to take correction you got to be able to take instruction you got to be able to take reproof oh Hallelujah though he slay me yet I trust him I go with him all the way though 10,000 follow my side though a thousand fall on my left I shall not be moved oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that [Applause] right David could say that cuz he had an experience he went through some stuff that only he could tell you about the real way we read it in the Bible but he felt the feelings felt the emotions you get glimpse of of it in the in the Psalms but but he was up and down he was in and out sometimes but he trusted in the Lord is God oh Hallelujah he was not afraid of The Hour That flyed by day nor of the pestilence that walkth in darkness nor of the disturbance that walk it at noon day oh Hallelujah he knew that there was a river the streams thereof that shall make clad the city of God and he knew as the Dare panted after the river so does it thirst pant after God and if he go to get to that River in that river is strength in that river is Grace in that river is everything he need and this morning there is a river there's a river flowing this morning with the Holy Ghost in it it has your healing in it it has your promises in it if you could only get to that water if you could only get to that water oh you will be satisfied hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah Hall my my my my Hallelujah are we in the spirit this morning sh just kind of trying to flow with the text [Music] here God has a way of doing things isn't that right his kingdom is set up a certain way he set up the earth a certain way the Earth right now is all corrupt and he has it in that condition to test the bride why would God put a bride in this evil hour it is to test her to try those seven virtue spirits and huh everybody has something to prove is is not right the devil has something to prove Luther has something prove Wesley has something to prove and the bride has something to prove in this hour praise God hallelujah isn't that right amen has it set up that way see for you to press what you want everybody has to prove something isn't that right okay let me go here now so the kingdom of God is set up a certain way isn't that right it's set up in this way watch that God can do what you cannot do amen amen but then you have to do what you have to do amen that's how it set up Hallelujah isn't that right only God can fill with the Holy Ghost isn't that right only God could seal only God could deliver only God could break the chains only God could do that we know that we are waiting on him to do that but while we are taring while we are waiting we've got to do what we have to do to get ready for when that breaks out for when those Miracles begin to break out that your heart would be right he said behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be there's always a work for you to do there's always something that you have to do praise God in God's kingdom Bible says he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him you not seek him in a lazy Spirit you're not looking for God well you're not under haway I give up yes no that's not the attitude you got to seek until you find like that woman who lost a coin she swept the walls she swept out the cobwebs she dusted the house she went on all night long until something happened it was getting dark she lit a candle she had a boom in one hand I'd imagine it's very difficult to sweep with one hand and have a candle in the other but she had to do it she needed a little light just to make it through she lit her candle she let her light so shine above men because she was desperate she needed something she got to get that coin and the bride in this hour has got to find her coin because her Lord is coming back to Earth again oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we got to find that coin we got to find that coin praise God oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah she swept the walls the neighbors can see the dust flying The Neighbors could see the commotion going on the neighbors could see the heart tearing the knee burning the neighbors could hear her praying the neighbors could hear her screaming the neighbors could hear her crying but what the neighbors also heard was come and rejoice with us for we have found the coin I was lost for she seek and she found when she knocked that door was open oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I want to be able to tell my neighbor the good news that God is Not dead but he is alive today that same God is here this morning he give the Lord a shout of Praise [Applause] amen hallelujah you could fast amen you could pray you can get in the spirit you can you could do that right there's things that you could do justification is as if you never did it God God wipe your Sate clean but then the sanctification part that's the part you have to play all right you have to clean up your home you have to clean up your life you know what inside your house living with you only you know that God nothing in there God coming to to to to visit you and if he's coming to visit if you expec in a visitor then you have to prepare the ground just right then you have to prepare the house just right isn't that right this church is being prepared just right the deacons are ready the ushers are getting ready the Billings are getting ready why because fire is fixing a fall oh hallelujah praise God Amen we've got to get things ready get everything ready because the king is coming the king is coming the king is coming he's riding in on angel's wings he'll have a cloud of witnesses with him praise God hallelujah oh Hallelujah prepare ye the way of the Lord Hall hallelujah hallelujah praise amen amen okay Hallelujah you have to do what you have to do is that right come like I think Peter was in jail is that right and he was in jail preaching the gospel and so on and um the Roman centurions are watching him is that right Peter was in there sleeping had fets on him and so forth sleeping there in the prison just imagine that prisoner of Christ doing the right thing and he's in prison for bearing the reproach of Christ I like to think that he was he was sleeping now if I was in that condition I'd have been worried cuz I didn't know what my state of condition would have been in the next morning I don't know if they would have my head or have I been in trial or what my court case would be like I'd have been worried that's me in my natural but but Peter wasn't in the natural Peter was in another atmosphere that's why he could sleep you could sleep when you know God's got you got your back you can sleep when God know he's got your control Peter find a comfortable spot on the wall there in the prison and he fell asleep and all of a sudden the angel come and smoked him the angel woke him up the angel had to shake him hard because he was so resting in the spirit resting waiting on God because he knew God was in this situation even though he was in prison it wasn't always going to be like this God's got his back and he knew the church was praying for him so he took a comfortable nap and he he was sleeping so hard the angel had to wake him up and said Peter Peter it's time to go and all of a sudden the chains fall off his feet and when the angel begin to walk with Peter the doors begin to open the Bible said the door opened by itself we think we know what automatic door is we think we know about GPS and smartphone technology but God had that long time God just push up button peep it the system wasn't even his own he didn't even build the technology but he override the technology and press the button and open the gates and he and the angel walk outside oh you talk about a God we serve oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he can open any door for you this morning all he's got to do is press the button but he's looking at your attitude he's looking at what you're doing oh Hallelujah [Applause] isn't that right the angel led him out of the prison the Bible says and then the Bible actually says a strange thing it says when he got to a place where he was familiar the angel left him immediately so just goes to show that God will lead you as far as he can carry youj but then when it comes to a point where you can do for yourself he leaves you to to to go on the rest of the way isn't that right Jesus led them as far as to Bethany that's as far as he could carry them that's as far as he could take them oh isn't that right but his 40-day ministry it was over it was finished with he had given them the Word of Promise he had breed unto them receive the Holy Ghost he had opened their understanding to the scriptures but that's as far as they could carry them he could carry them rather isn't that right because they had to go in the upper room they had to find a place they had to set themselves aside they had to pray they had to seek they had to praise God they had to earnestly contend they had to wait until the promise of the father proom was brought unto them amen isn't that right hallelujah amen so as I close up this thought you have an active role to play in your blessing isn't that right there's always something for you to do isn't that right there's an active role for you to play amen amen Hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah praise God praise God so Matthew 11:12 says and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence and the violent take it by force I love that word take isn't that right God gives it but you have to take it isn't that right am it's about that like that story where about the presidental pardon isn't that right the president give the pardon to this young man who who did something wrong in the military or something was remember the story and um president gave a pardon when the pardon was brought to him he didn't believe it was a pardon and he end up getting killed anyway and the people wondered how come he was written a pardon and he uh still end up getting the death sentence and it end up turning out that amen isn't that right uh our pardon is only a pardon until it is accepted as a pardon so our pardon can be given but until you accept it it is not yours until you possess it until you take a hold of it it is not yours until you take up the right take up the mantle of responsibility or take up whatever the thing is then it's not yours hallelujah praise God until you possess it isn't that right God gives it but you have to take it God gives salvation but it's not yours until you take it Jesus didn't just die for this one he died for the whole world his blood covered the whole world but not everybody could take it only the predestinated could go into that place only the predestinated could take their promises for this hour isn't there right and God set it up that way that the predestinated could shine through amidst the testings amidst the trials amidst the situation that is set up in the Earth today only the predestinated oh Hallelujah is predestined to go into that [Applause] place hallu isn't that right we need to predestinated look at Esther Esther was a queen yes living in the palace my God Wonderful Life Hallelujah married to King XIs love of his life things are wonderful things are glorious grapes when you want it wine when you want it food when you want it fellowship and fun and sweetness and laughter but then all of a sudden God begin to turn the tide God begin to change the situation God begin to bring it to us but where it come the point of desperation because Esther's people were in Peril go is not right the devil raise up on am malachit oh Hall on all enemy of the Israelite people to bring bondage upon the people to bring a decree upon the people to bring a price on the people's head isn't that right the people's blood were at the one thing Hallelujah isn't that right there was a warrant out for their arrest oh Hallelujah the people were in Peril and little did us to know that she was in position she was in a unique situation only she was in a situation to do something about the condition that was taking place in that day oh Hallelujah and God rais up a bride in this hour she is the only one in a unique condition this morning to do something about the condition that the world is in today the world is in Peril Darkness on every side young people fainting on the left and on the right who could stand oh it'll take Michael in this hour to stand under every name on the book oh at that time thaty people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the Lamb's Book of Life Michael is about to take his stand Hallelujah

Bible yes and um they were marking pages in The Bible and I don't know if anybody know what it was but all of a sudden somebody noticed it and say wait a minute these are checks these are checks this

bookmarks she didn't place value on it she didn't see the importance of it oh Hallelujah isn't that right she thought they were bookmarks onest on the story St amen amen and there were checks laying

before fruit more fruit and much fruit you appreciate of it amen amen amen Hallelujah and I love what he is talking about with the two growing together until the time appointed isn't that right hallelujah what a wonderful thought I began to think about it it said that God uh the Lord rather of the Harvest came and the people said look the enemy has brought tears the tears have been swn among the wheat and amen isn't that right and the the caretaker said the enemy has done this oh Hallelujah and they say what shall we do shall we pl up the tears pluck up pluck them up now shall we we reap them now he said no no no no he said don't do that he said let them grow together until the time of the Harvest until the time of they begin to show their fruit until the time begin to show who they are oh hallelujah praise God and I will send for the Reapers I will do the separation I will do the work the Lord himself he not going to send anybody to do this work for him he is going to send for the Reapers he is going to let you know when the time is ready when the season is ready when it's time to bring forth fruit when it's time for that fruit to come forth hallelujah praise God amen amen

Heaven suffer it violence and the violence take it by force isn't that right and notice Joshua God told Joshua see I have given into thy hand Jericho and God gave Joshua Jericho the city Hallelujah but it wasn't his until he marched around it it wasn't his until he take it it wasn't his until he do did what God told him to do until they marched the first day and the second day and the third day until they did that Jericho was not full theirs they had to go and take it by force they had to go and take each promise and for each City that they took there was a different instruction for that city the city of I had instructions oh isn't that right the Canaanites and the jebusites and the hites and the P the amorites and so forth amen isn't that right all of them had different instructions that went along with taking those cities isn't that right it's not going to be the same all the time God has a program God has a way of doing it we just got to follow his way we just got to follow his will and once we do what he says do you're going to have good success you're going to have good success praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen oh myall hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen praise God we have promised Dominion Hallelujah to take back from the devil what he stole from Us Hal Hallelujah isn't that right Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah for years he has had his run for years he has had his thing but the bride is about to take her place amen in Christ in the word Jesus had to take his place in the scripture he was God yet he was a man enough to take up his position to subject himself to the word hallelujah for that day the scripture of Isaiah saying hallelujah isn't that right to peel a brokenhearted isn't that right to bind up the BR BR amen and to loose the captive and to preach the acceptable day of the Lord isn't that right that was the word for his day oh and he anointed it and so must the bride anoint her word her scripture for her day she have to find where it is written all and walk in that anointing brother PR had to walk in that anointing Hallelujah isn't that right of Malachi 4:5 and 6 he had to walk in it he had to study it he had to stay in it until it was fulfilled praise God and the bride too for this hour has to find her word and her scripture for her day and when you find where it is written there's no devil that can shake you there's no devil that can take you off of your promise because you know that it is yours and you know that if it is yours you can take it listen we not take in something that is not ours you know it is ours yes sir God spoke to us and told us what our portion is from this border to this border from this border to this border from the north from the south from the East where the parameter of the promised word of God is God has already stretched that out in the word of God there's no new thing that needs to be preached all we need to do is go up at once and take the land that is promised to us from this border to this holy ghost from this inheritance to this inheritance the sick will be healed the dead will be raised up a five-fold Ministry from this border to this border from this border to this border all is yours hallelujah hallelujah Prophet preach a message how can I overcome he said did you notice the arrangements of that see set with me in my Throne talking about a scripture in Revelation amen isn't that right not on my throne but in my Throne amen he said that's in his domain isn't that right the literal English you would say on a throne a human being sits on a throne but brother BR is bringing out something here now that the scripture has slipped in a mystery isn't that right he said in his throne see and now as Christ is the ruler Throne ruler at this time of the complete domain of God he said so will the church be with him the bride will be with him in his his throne am in his entire in the entire domain see not on my throne but in my Throne see that's where his domain reaches oh Hallelujah so you are promised to have power to have dominion in Christ in his throne Hallelujah isn't that right and his domain reaches just as far as its boundaries does and this his boundaries is from eternity to Eternity just think of it isn't that right and Jesus said on that day you shall know I am in the father he in me and I in you and you in me on that day you're going to understand who your father is and who you are and that you have an inheritance in God that you are not a you're not Wayward you are not a bastard child but you have a father you have a family somewhere and just as your natural name represents your natural family on Earth you have a supernatural name that represents a supernatural family in heaven and the only way to get into that kingdom is to be born into that kingdom is to press your way in there for an individual birth into that Kingdom then supernaturally you are connected to that family oh huah brothers and sisters up there Paul is up there in that family irus is up there in that family Peter James and John is in that family you have brothers and sisters this morning that you don't even know about praise God but you are connected to that family that glorious family of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost on Fire oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what a faith that ought to give you what a faith I believe that give brother Brandon brother Brandon you come true a real messed up family situation and his father was a drunker oh he didn't have anything to be proud about and the Americans me different people in different societies they always built up on family and who their father was before them all always have a way of dictating how the children are supposed to be how the children are supposed to come out isn't that right your family was a policeman so everybody expects you to be a policeman your father was a carpenter so they expect you to be a carpenter too is this not Joseph's son but when brother Branham connected to his Supernatural family in heaven brother he forgot about his family forgot about where he come from he was a seek in a city whose maker and pillar was God he was looking for something Supernatural he was in a supernatural world he was disconnected from his natural lineage and the bride on this Earth will be disconnected from our natural lineage oh you come from God you didn't come from this Earth come on now you didn't come from your natural family oh God separated you from your mother's womb brought you out of the Miry clay put your foot on a rock give you a promise in your soul he said I'm coming back for you oh how you and you alone oh you got a revelation in your soul that God is coming back for me [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

bother about them they in their vainness taking selfies and taking video clips and dancing and partying and getting drunk and she's in the back washing the dishes all all of a sudden the lord of the party leaves the presence of the party and come down to the back because he fed up with the attitudes fed up with the vain women and silly women and just going on and carrying on and I can imagine Jesus see church after church come and fall into the dust and a lot of vain people passed through and different ones who wasn't real and different ones who wasn't genuine but here he come and slip over to the backs side of the book and there was a little woman washing some wees and oh Hallelujah she just in the spirit and she just doing her thing and she just being courteous and she just accustomed being kind because she was always that way somewhere on the backside God had to find you where you were sitting find you where you were sleeping find you oh Hallelujah this Pride this

Hallelujah she don't see herself as nobody hallelujah hallelujah she's just washing dishes do what she does best helping out being a nice person here's this lord of the Party come down to the back see this woman begin to talk to the woman don't know who he are but he's checking out her spirit she's humble barefooted how the prophet talked about isn't that right oh but she had a a spirit about her there was something different about this woman he said I'll come back for you he said I want to marry you I want you to be my wife see you see them out there they on their own we say see you just remember I spoke to you this is between me and you sh don't tell nobody don't talk to nobody hey you in the spirit now I'm coming back for you praise God that woman is in the spirit oh Hallelujah from that time her life was different from that day she began to make preparation because she was expecting the lord of the party to come back for her and we know the time of the Harvest Bo the Lord of the Harvest is going to come back with his Angelic Reapers and he's going to reap oh hallelujah hallelujah reap you into the resurrection hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah it's one thing for your mother to talk to you it's one thing for your father to talk to you but when God speaks to you that's different this woman Heard a Voice a direct voice from a young man who made a promise he said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be there also it's a glorious place it's a land flowing with milk and honey it's a river Hallelujah there are streets of gold there's a promise there's an entire city 15,000 M Square made for you praise God the height of it the depth of it the length of it the breadth of it every place you put your foot will be yours God has promised a place for us it is a glorious Resurrection it is a glorious Rapture let's make ready for it if God has promised a revive let's make ready for it if God has promised a glorious goinging home of the church then brother let's make ready for it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I don't know how much money she made but her little pittance went towards making a dressall every little coin she had saved it up was sewing something stitching something them wom's laugh at her they began to mock her they tell they thought you was crazy H he you are getting yourself ready to be married to some man that you you believed what he told you but she said I believe it because he spoke to me he didn't speak to none of them but he spoke to me and I'm waiting for him she was sewing her dress just getting a veil ready she had to find the right shoes she went shopping for sequence the right kind of sequence she needed to be under expectation she was shined up she was polished up and when the day of a visitation come there she stood waiting with a veil in her praise God on her head with a bouet in her hand and down come the lord of the party praise God hallelujah riding praise God from the sunset coming to take his pride away oh hallelujah hallelujah come on now oh the Lord is going to come back for you one day he's coming back he's coming back the king is coming make way for the king Hallelujah oh my GL hallelujah hallelujah my God he said we're like Abraham brother said H the world is again falling apart he said well like Abraham Abraham received the word and anything was contrary to the word he called it as if it wasn't and he said any true born child of God receive God's word he said and I don't care what anybody says what system speaks against the word the word is true anyhow and brother bam said further on he said God is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises oh Hallelujah outside of them promises he can't meet you because you don't cut yourself off from him so if you can't preach the promises if you can't anoint the promises you cut yourself off from God but we didn't come this far to cut ourselves off he didn't bring us this far to leave us he didn't teach us to swim so so we could drown and he didn't give us the holy ghost that he could just move away that's not the God I serve our God has given us promises in his word acts 18 you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you Joel 2:28 after these things I shall pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters have prophesy your young men shall dream dreams old men shall see Visions praise God H the gospel will be preaching its [Music] [Applause] power yeah amenah [Applause] Hallelujah can you take a little more my hallu amen I W be too longer with you amen so the Bible clearly identifies in the scripture when you talk about this press two different types of press isn't that right there's a group press and then there's the individual press isn't that right the definition of a group press is a closely packed crowd or mass of people or things isn't that right a group a crowd isn't that right pressing isn't that right and in a group press it's easier Amen to press with the group because you're going with the flow of things whatever the group says is what you do whatever group the group sanctions you go with it isn't that right there there's no real struggle there isn't that right say what everybody else says do what everybody else does you're identified with the group isn't that right you're all moving in a particular direction isn't that right but with the individual press it's different you have to know what you are about you have to know what you are doing you have to know where you are going amen isn't that right or you can get let astray because if the group is going to hell you'll go into hell with them just to show us anything so God have to open your mind open your heart to something different to make you to move in a different direction oh to make you move away from the group think from the group idea Hall then you are seeing what God Said and not what they say and not what they approve and not what they happy with whether they happy or whether they don't happy you're not there to please them you there to please God you there to please your father you are concerned about what your father is saying about you that's what adoption is your conduct and your behavior is what places you in the adoption not what people say not men's ideas not what the group thinks but your behavior and your conduct amid the trials that he and his wisdom sends your way you conduct yourself like a son you conduct yourself like job you speak like a foolish woman and though his brothers come and say joob what's your condition what is going on with you Jo your sin who sin what what going on with you and and and and you need some help you look you look badly off you don't look like a Christian you don't smell like a Christian you don't look like us what's going on with you there's something weird about you but job know what was going on with him because he had a personal connection with God and these fellas weren't real friends they were just Associates and when in the trial you you really see who your friends are in the test is when you see when your real friends are your real friends are those who could stay with the word those real friends are people who could encourage you isn't that right when you're all low when you're broken up friends are people who could come and carry you take you through like that man was lame with the py I think it was Jesus preaching among the press the group was around and he's preaching and talking and these real friends say listen you been in that condition a long time yeah we are good friends and we are not going to allow you to live another day in this condition you are coming with us whether we have to carry you whether we have to lift you lift you up climb you whatever that whatever it take but we taking you and these friends begin to break up the roof oh what a condition praise God I don't even know they got time to talk to the landlord I don't even know they got time to talk to the land owner but they begin to break the roof up because they had needs for their friend and they loved their friend enough to begin to break up the roof that's real friendship praise God and it began to lower a man down into this service that was going on and they interrupted the program they interrupted the natural flow of things whatever Jesus was going to say next was interrupted whatever Jesus was going to do next was interrupted because there was a need there and whenever there's a need there anytime somebody's pressing for a need that need must be fulfilled oh Hallelujah God is a gentleman praise God hallelujah and if you got a need he's going to accommodate you he's going to find a place for you he's going to see to that need he put everybody else on the side and go after that one he leave the 99 and go after that one he is the Good Shepherd that Good Shepherd will find every one of his [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sheep Jesus that was a story with this woman prise God as you read in the scripture isn't that rightl this woman with the blood is you Bible said she had a condition for 12 years not 12 days not 12 months 12 long years Hallelujah that's a long time amen it's long enough for you to get discouraged amen it's long enough for you to get dismay it's long enough for you to feel like you're all always going

kind of a beautiful woman she was all they could see was her condition her situation that she was in for 12 long years Hallelujah isn't that right and all her money ran out it was one thing to be sick and he could see and pay your way through but when your money run out it's a different story people don't really explore the options until there's almost no options left all right comes down to the a knife's edge straight but a little and you will fall she was at this Edge oh she needed something she didn't know how long she would live anymore because the money was no longer paying for her dialysis or whatever it is she was taking she was death's door things was getting Grim all right isn't that right this was This Woman's condition and preceding the scripture I read the scripture a bit and the Bible actually talks about that manise God who was in a state of mental Decay Hallelujah and Jesus had gone over to the other side to heal this man amen and to deliver this man from his condition Hallelujah cast the spirits out into the pigs isn't that right Hallelujah this man was so touched by God he was excited as we all get excited he felt the power he felt the glory he said Lord I want to go with you I want to fellowship with you I want to follow you where you are and Jesus told him no no no no you don't follow me what I want you to do is go out and tell your story among the people go and testify of What the Lord Has Done and this man begin to testify this man begin to share it on Facebook he begin to share it on Twitter he begin to tell his story he went on the news and went on the newscast and they talked to him and the pretty soon the the the the people that Day begin to hear about this man who was delivered from a state of mental illness oh Hallelujah in so much that the Bible says when Jesus came back from the other side there was a great crowd waiting for him there was a great mass of people waiting for him Jesus was like a celebrity now everybody want to touch Jesus everybody want to talk to him he's beginning to come famous he's beginning to come popular oh and people just begin to throng him and as he come off the boat or whatever transport he was

excited everybody's in the message everybody's reading the books everybody's reading the tapes everybody's feeling good everybody's singing the songs of Zion everybody's in the atmosphere oh Hallelujah some come to be seen some come to be heard but this woman she was different she had a need that nobody else hallelujah praise God could help her with she had something something that she was trying praise God to get from God and nobody else could do it nobody else could help her oh the musicians could begin to come forward this woman Hallelujah heard it on the news people were talking about it she heard a testimony that Jesus was coming to town she heard a testimony that Jesus was coming this way and this woman begin to talk to herself all the time the shadow of death was over her life but just for a moment just for a brief moment she saw a possibility that all of a sudden her 12E sickness could be ended today she told herself if I could just touch I don't want my mother to touch I don't need my father to touch I don't want to have a conversation I want to touch him I want to touch him for myself oh hallelujah hallelujah what did you come for this morning what is your attitude this morning she wanted a touch from [Applause] [Music] God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now she could have gone down to the pool of Bethesda amen and she could have waited down there for her blessing that was an option too but if she went down there her chances were slim because only one person could get into the pool and her day needed to be today it couldn't be tomorrow because she didn't know what tomorrow hold but she know who hold tomorrow and she didn't want to go by some pool and wait for some blessing she decide that she going to press her away she going to find this Messiah wherever he sitting at she didn't care how much people was around him she didn't care how much people was arguing and quarreling and fussing and stewing they had their issues but she had a blood issue she needed something she wanted something she got to get it she got to get it and we've got to get it only God can help you with your issue oh hallelujah praise God
