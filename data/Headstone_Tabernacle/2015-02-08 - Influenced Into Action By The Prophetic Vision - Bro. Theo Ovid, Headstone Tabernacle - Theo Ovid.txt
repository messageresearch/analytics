rugged cross team with blood so divine Father we thank you for that blood covering this morning for they come down over that blood Lord your presence come and fill every hungry heart here this morning have your way in Jesus then we ask it a man a name and you will be seated it's good to be home it's good to be home amen well greetings from Uganda the Bride of Christ and people the believers their host pastor john Shakuni Street was dedicated at about 50 ministers over their passes I believe and we had a great time in the Lord and it's so good to see God's people hunger and twisting for righteousness Oh blessed be the name of the Lord's we'll be hearing more about those meetings but God has been good to us and got us being good to me it gave me the strength and they gave me the grace to be able to him and make these trips and his journeys but I thank God for his love and to think that you know we just have a short space of time to do what we have to do before you know it the years just passed by hallelujah whatever you do what comes is what you do for the kingdom of God not the house that you build at the car that you drive no what you do for the kingdom of God we went out not to represent Trinidad represent this church but to represent the kingdom every Christian represents the king of God you represent a higher power a higher authority your anointing and your unction and your authority comes from above it doesn't come from the local church it doesn't come from an elder or a pastor or bishop it comes from above hallelujah praise God you are sons and daughters of the Living God it doesn't ever greet one among us and a greater one among us it doesn't have that you only have sons and daughters of God I passed the past and five people is just as good as a pastor pastor in 10,000 people it's just sons and daughters of God that God would give some places and and talents and so forth for his glory and for his honor he know what you could handle he know what you could manage he know what stress you can take and he wouldn't give you more than you can bear that's the God that we serve with every temptation he makes a way of escape he wouldn't leave you just to give up and let go and pack up shop he will always make away because he has proven himself to be a way maker when it seems to be no way when you seen press pop panic on Halloway to turn he have a way of opening doors that you didn't even know was there sometime in the room all locked up but God címon open I went caught open that door for you whatever God to open no man could shut that door or even God hallelujah maybe this morning Gordon I open a door to good health maybe this morning God could open a door to you for revival maybe this morning God could open a door that you could receive the baptism of Holy Ghost and your deliverance maybe this morning God would open your prison and you could walk a free man a free woman this morning or what a mighty God we serve Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but for the blood of Jesus where would we be without that blood that's why the day they were still power in the blood you may not understand all when we preach for there is power in the blood a blood price was paid for your deliverance that's why the devil has no right this morning to hold you back hold you down and catch you the devil all right this morning because jesus paid a price that you could saw where you never went before Jesus paid the price that you could go free you may be seated but a random said one of the worst things as I see our Eagle caged up you got kids up a bird that was born to show no limits oh hi you could go where you could fly what meat you wanna eat no limits Oh hallelujah and some spirit a man come to entrap ajita hold I dig along the soil you can't tell a heel don't try to fly out it's built into flies built into soy build in the press and when you tell a son of God you have to stand at a state you cannot tell a true son of God that you will build to rise from the ashes you will build the bunks back up you will build Ariz up from the jaws of defeat to be given victory over the kids of the enemy you will raise up for God's honor unscored glorious good to be here this morning it's but to be in the presence of God it's good to be under the anointing of victory of triumph Oh blessed be the name of the Lord glory legardie man god bless you may be seated I want a time but uh Anthony and by the exact for hauling on and amen preaching the Word of God that's what they anoint you to do the preach the gospel without compromise hallelujah we are not responsible for what God said we're responsible for giving the message of what he said if you are fight with it that's your problem that's not our problem because once God said is it got to come to pass God don't waste words God don't waste time god don't play games god don't play politics God said my word is different from every other world my world have a beat up aware about it it just cannot return void always accomplish the purpose that I said and thought to accomplish and of course send me in this morning with a word for you that word can't return void Oh glory not God hallelujah glory Lala you know somebody made a statement if it keeps speaking the truth every time you wouldn't have to fight them to try to remember what they said last oh hallelujah hallelujah if you keep speaking the truth every time you wouldn't have to fight up with what you try to remember what just told that person time before because it is not so straight because you lie become consistent your life comes you directly with the words from your mouth you see it is powerful to be authentic it is a stressed act to perform the deed to impress people you have to make a great effort to do that but when you are you you and you are you and when you know who you are where you come from you are just who you are you don't think effort to be who you are you you just you just who you are when you see me you see the father because the father dwelleth in me that's what Jesus said hallelujah praise God did Lord some praises glory and the only thing that could return you to that uniqueness is divine revelation and Jesus said upon this rock I will build my church the Prophet said he don't even mind to help embellish it he is the architect he draw the design for it he know where he wants what so stop trying to help God I'm just moving the spirit the way God wanted to move be free to serve Him be free to push up your after said step like you belong to some priesthood back there no you don't have to walk like you have some angel's wings and some falls and you're looking to recover it yeah this morning no no he be making seven lower than the Angels he became one of us to become like a the feel the way we feel you feel tired you feel weary but he kept pressing on because you know if you only get the cavalry he will come true Oh precious is the flow that mainly wait to snow nor the song title nothing but the blood of Jesus we need the power of the blood the song as they look beyond my force and so my name's what are wretched people we are but God rich rich in mercy but last I heard there's worth rich and mercy be self to be condemned deserve the time but God rich and Mercy Mercy Mercy there was great and grace was free I don't dare was multiplied to me there are my burn soul for Liberty at Calvary Oh hallelujah mercy there was great and grace was free pad and there was multiplied to me damn my banjo from Liberty if you're free shout this morning hallelujah or glory how many expectation this morning that God can do more then you could ask or think reaches a little higher than where you are raise your feet little higher than where you are really focus on hard and where you are go on to bless this morning go to one to deliver this morning God want to change this morning a from the powerful statement and I believe it's from Franklin D Roosevelt that said not everything that is feast can be changed but nothing can be changed until it is feast I kind of like that I want to see it again not everything that is faced can be changed but nothing can be changed until it is faced if you want to change you have to listen confront yourself you're not some people had to confront other people at the confront is one the afraid of confrontation the comfort of confrontation they love confrontation they some people run from confrontation but when are you going to begin to confront yourself where you are the way you operate what you think what you feel where you go why are you seeing all of this this morning but over it I don't know I just just to see what she gave me to say and I just hope it stick someone we need a left rib somewhere down here inside your heart but you got to confront yourself some point in time as a husband as a wife as a man as a woman as a sister as a daughter its parents father mother are the believers of worship are the child of God you have got to confront yourself because you're gonna find out that the God's behavior is his prison so the God's behavior is this person not what you say but what you are so on the authenticity comes to the point of what you are not what you see you are but what you and that's what Jesus came to do to bring us into a revelation and a recognition of who we are because we lost it we lost it we lost our Dominion we lost our inheritance we lost our position with God we lost when we look in the mirror we didn't recognize who that was because we lost the vision we lost the purpose and intent of God for what we were born for what we created for but Jesus and sins and 14:20 said that day you shall know but I am and the father he and me and I in you and Paul said we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is part is done or it and we shall know as we unknown so we're going to know that we don't know just yet but we gonna know something that's so powerful that it will change and revolutionize your life you are done because you don't know who you are you are depressed because you don't know who you are you ask week before you don't know where you are but if the we begin to say I am strong and that the strength of God on the inner man then you begin to see something different you stop complaining he's that praising you stop complaining he's not worshiping we're gonna read the script adjust now we want to float a little bit and a feel something like that hallelu let the prove of this spirit go down to pop our hearts football minds and souls mmm holla it takes effort to act it takes effort to be like somebody else but it's natural to be unique and people don't appreciate their uniqueness in God that's why we can't have one covering one banner one Methodist what Baptist economy one church to be under have to be one whole Eagles has to be one Kingdom because mana different countries are different culture is different and we are shaped by an environment or culture country and everything else make us act and behave a certain way but the life could have be Christ in the different countries in the different environment open be Christ one Christ there's only one Lord got ten Lords only one Lord there's only one baptism indistinct they this thing today is there's only two forces or two influences it don't have tree you don't have ten just two I want you to think about that because this is one when today and the title this morning has been influenced hallelujah praise the name by the prophetic vision to get into action hallelujah praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord getting into action by the prophetic vision being influenced to get into action by the prophetic vision and that is what has happened to your life you have to be influenced Amen to get into action there are only two influences you are influenced to watch God or we from God some types of something coming to influence your marriage to break it or to heal it you come into church I get closer to God or further from God influences everywhere it's ever all around us all the advertisements are wrong is the influences to buy this product or that product they have it on the airwaves they had it on Billboard's what is that for to influence us to make a choice between Coke and Pepsi or whatever it is they want to influence us and the devil have his influence and God have his influence God influence is his word and that's what he want to bring to you this morning and influence of people hallelujah and if you have the influence of the word then you have the inference for life Oh glory to God so as we want to stand and give God some praise 'as hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Oh G Jesus little why why I wanted to run with somebody and look at them at the blood is washing them all away love Jesus Jesus the blood why why has no one more time for the blood Jesus who the blood of Jesus ah Jesus watch this one we want to turn off Piper's Ezekiel chapter 12:1 Ori from who's 22 to 28 also from Habakkuk chapter 2 1 2 3 proverbs 20 29 verse 18 influence into action by the prophetic vision Ezekiel chapter 12 reading from verse 22 son of man what is that proverb that he have in the Land of Israel saying the days are long and every vision feel and tell them therefore thus saith the Lord God I will make this provoke the Seas and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel but say unto them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision for there shall be no more any Veen vision no flattering designation within the hooves of Israel for I am the Lord I will speak and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass it shall be no more prolonged for in your days or rebellious house will I see the word and will perform it see the Lord God again the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man behold day of the house of Israel see the vision that he see it is for many days to come and he prophesied of the times that are afar off therefore see unto them thus saith the Lord God there shall none of my words be prolong any more but the word which I have spoken shall be done see it the Lord reading from Habakkuk chapter 2 reading from verse 1 I will stand up on my watch and set me up on the tower and we'll watch to see what he will see unto me on what I shall answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that reads it for the vision as yet for an appointed time but our the energize speak are not lie do it Tyree read for it because it will surely come it will not tarry and from proverbs chapter 29 read in verse 18 where there is no vision the people perish let us pray father we thank you for your word and I pray give us brutal insight bless the word Lord take me out of the way and be glorified in Jesus name I ask it amen amen you may be seated per gram our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see or what we hear it is determined on what discernment we have of what we see on what we hear what the Christian looks to is never the scene all our power and strength is unseen that's why we walk not by sight but by feet isn't that right and the Prophet said an influencer Phoenix what we have seen his promises in the last days or to put each one of us into action you have to see something that will inspire you into action many people sit and hear and you know understand but that's more on an intellectual level but what you hear must put you into action so somehow the Holy Spirit have to translate what you hear into an understanding that is so simple now when you read it you could run because he was told in Habakkuk to write the vision and then make it plain it ought not to be complicated it ought not to be that you don't understand the vision because the vision must be made clear must be made clean plain for you to understand it that you could move into action if you don't understand that you would freeze if you understand it you're gonna begin to understand the patterns you have to play because a minister cannot bring a revival if the people have to bring a revival therefore the understanding of the come to the people so it's not about the minister it's not about the preacher it's about you getting divine revelation to enter into your inheritance o blessed be the name of the Lord do you believe that this morning now watch what we have seen do you know what he said cover yourselves home by themselves then get into action watch what we have seen happen to put every soul in action it should make a church that would make a revival here in Phoenix that people will be flying in from Europe to see what's taking place there's a place in Arizona called Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix there is something broke out until the seven thunders of revelation 10 that's not even a road is being manifested in other words somebody some group somewhere some part of the world will be able to say this day the scripture is fulfilled Oh hallelujah got the seven thunders it's being made manifest you mean that's a promise that's a promise you mean that's efficient that's a vision it's a vision of perfection because you cannot move unless you get revived you see if the pipe is dripping you could let it drip you don't have to fix it right away if you choose not to they could drip hole there and this make noise big dip but if the kitchen catch a fire you can just watch the city kitchens on fire that's a different thing altogether you get into action you see the tripping right get along to move because that says drip drip drip but the fire forget it if you don't move your house is gone and that's what we need we meet the seat somebody say fire Oh hallelujah but I like those five on the move all and petals hiding in that shell ain't gonna make a little come off the shell beating them with the step won't do it it pick fire Oh glory to God to get them purple over the shell all you touches inside of here you're gonna come out your shell that come fresh I didn't even know we have to limit it was Brazilian I didn't come fresh anymore hiding under this hard shell you can't get to them at all the only poking out and putting back in coconut and green back in then doing nothing but I met a turtle on the beach and he hits it it wouldn't come out like some fire then that head come on move move get more spot church members who want to rise up hallelujah so don't tell me you can't get the run but if I'm saying if you're not run is the devil up behind you has ever got you you better be running oh how you better be running if you're not running the devil got you hallelujah you better be running I'm running for my life this morning Oh hallelujah your love and praise golly man praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God so friends this is the time to be influenced by the world to be put into action with reverence and humility isn't done right blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why people feel safe hiding in groups they feel they want to take the burden off of there being an individual and put it under group so therefore you are safe in the group I belong to this group I'm a Methodist I'm about this I'm a dis you want to belong to a group but God does have a way of singing y'all gonna get our group name you have one name the name you're born into say silver rose I hope to have nothing they born at the silver rose family and under person given name Julie I am MS Julie Silver Rose isn't that right you couldn't have more than a mere born into that's the name that we're born into but that's what I'm talking about you'll be given a name given a path given a role and that part is unique now when you come into that authentic who you are there is no room for jealousy because you don't want what any other person have you don't want come on oh you don't want that gift you don't want that position you want to be in the place that God wants you to be because in your place your power in your place you have authority in your place you are hallelujah glory to God hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah raise the name of the law so when they come to know who you are then your inner is in harmony with your outer you don't have no internal self conflict you have no points to prove you're not trying to get people to respect you respect me respect me will live a life and people will respect you because we will respect you not for what you're given to but what you stand for come on same and somebody you see when you come to be who you are in God you not you don't cater for the group for the crowd so what the sizing comes in you don't care for that you said you're hurting all times get your enemy and kill and do that but I say unto you love your enemies do good to them that do evil to you in other words do the opposite pass them in kindness posture and sweetness pass them and humility we're gonna have the life of Christ on this play Oh hallelujah if you believe that hallelujah glory to God Amen so then when you have to please people you have to find out what they see somebody asks a question you can't answer yeah because I want to nobody or the scene we've seen we've seen we use alright I say the same thing to you have no revelation you have no inspiration it depends upon what the group see what the feel of say and Jesus had that he said who do men say I am let's hear what the group of men otice him some say you a dis some say that everybody have interpretation who I am no church tell me who I am and they look to the left look to the right nobody got hurt because they didn't know he's a good man it's a powerful man he's a man of God but nobody is wandering here everybody knew that but Peter said I'm at the Christ the Son of the Living God now the revelation is not what he said but he haven't revealed to him and that's why Purim says it will take divine revelation so what people have for these years is a lot of intellectual conceptions but luck and divine revelation because we've an revelation TQ otaku think divine revelation raise you up into a reconciliation with God as a son that means you can stand anywhere any place any time under any condition you will stand because you are built upon a rock import put you in the fiery furnace you understand if God put you in the lies then you're gonna stop if God put your wherever can be five years River Isaac you understand all his children have to stand as individuals you can't rely on your mother and your father you can't rely on your brother your sister you got to rely on the revelation of God coming to your soul because what your soul believed but your father that's yours you're in your soul of yours you can be healed right now as the word is being spoken that is Jaws or chlorine did you get that did you get that Jesus man came to Jesus he said I reckon a soundbar you you a man under authority to have authority to be under 30 you have to be authorized to have power I don't imagine taking power on your own nice to come in yourself a kind of dictator business yes I know your man under Authority and you say the one go Ani go no speak the word I'm a servant it's not a brother they're not a family thy servant and he is sick that speak the word you're not that commonly hands not even common I'm I just speak the word I have power to believe your word I know your word is not gonna return boy I know you all would have an impotent speaking when your nipple and speak the miraculous that's the great when you speak your word can't return void when you speak that's God speaking when you speak man speaking of sports Pekin Oh hallelujah my word shall not be prolonged I will bring my own water pass of a bright revival of a 7-ton arrival in Trinidad I will bring my word to pass Oh hallelujah now watch when that man reaches house he wasn't asking how you're feeling he said I asked what time what time do you know what time he was knew what time was he healed what time I want to confirm they say the same time the word was spoken the same time / spoken do you believe you could go free today when the same time the word is spoken you don't have to remain sick you don't have to name depress you know I'm a man trapped you'd have to be covered with all that heaviness over you he came to lift your heavy burden he come to bring you up in spirit in case you forgot I want to remain you for all of I'm short of the glory of God for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God so if you think your obvious and we all have sinned we have come to man all have sinned not some not some more and some all have sinned and come short of the glory so when God began the dumpers go read all have sinned and come short of the glory of God that's what we could have pictured this morning this morning Oh hallelujah because of the love of Jesus which is so wonderful there is no condition that is too bad to her too low too deep that he can reach down and pull up annoyed inspire him and change a wrong turn around there's no situation that you could express the God that he can handle change transform rearrange what blow in a God you can do all of that this morning all glory to God he could be arranged everything around your life yes this morning could be the beginning the first day of the rest of your life all what is the past is the past Loreena God that woman at a well

are commenter authentic you Peter Peter had to get converted and Jesus knew it so it - laughs they converted strengthen the bedroom you will deny me because you're human yeah you'll reject me because you're human you'll run away from me because you're human just a human you but when you get converted that's the power that's not natural that's inner power that brings out the review so Peter as a human run away and deny Christ Peter as a human wept Peter's the human but when he was filled with the Holy Ghost that changed Peter totally completely to the self that God wanted to have at that day you wanna know who is inside of you because God's a new heart I'll give you but that's not the end of it he's a new spirit I will give you because I want you to be able to agree with your neighbor at least there are some people so sour they saw it everybody by sight they're sour they walk sour they look sour they talk so on they're just negative you don't want to be around them because they just plain sour if you're joyful they will summer your joy they get a chance to their swords their grapefruits their lemons that's the spirit upon them so God's I'll give you a new heart I had to watch God I'll give you a new spirit say it wouldn't be someone's Savior so us inside of here you need a new spirit because God had put in the Holy Ghost in the showers hallelujah you have to come with us I was going to put in Holy Ghost on wolf holy was coming on lambs I'm the only with the chicken Islam is to do something to you to see the lamb coming out or the world's coming on if the wolves coming out

altar with one Accord and three until fire of God begins to fall again pray until the fire of God begin to fall again somebody gonna catch the vision somebody will get an inspiration to understand the path that has to play to see every vile break out and fire begin to move again because fire has already started to move that's why we could preach what we preach because the fire they cannot preach what we are preaching right now because you have got the catch of vision that will put you in action Oh hallelujah cut somebody say Amen so I don't care you can have the mightiest creatures the very best elected teachers line them up one by one the minister to you if you don't get a vision the preachers and them just doing just out there doing free last 40 years that's sowing seed and whatnot but when you are ready when you say Lord I want a revival what a revival does our revival boys the trash out of the church and the trash out of your life all what you can't do all what your tolerance and all what your cover my zone right now or that gets flushed so it's the same see but guess what it shows the trash on the shore because the sea is having a revival so when the storm come and rip up the ocean liner rip up this is a revival taking place it brings us still in your heart it brings us stay in your spirit it reported deafness the coolness it's all the excess fresh if they become pio it

that they could see where you're going you need a revival we need a revival not porn need like a tiny gas to drive the church needs a revival like the car need gas to drive the church's clock to hammer in Lila what if we don't preach it what the riddle Oxford's what life you don't claim it I want you to leave here cleaning it in your home clean minutes on the street cleaning it going to

you come in a great expectation your spirit revive your revive you under prey on the consecration you're under worship you're under praise you understand education you under the blood then something got to take place those demons affecting your life with the backup shop those unclean spirits at the sign-off why because you are no beginner get into action one squad people begin their get into action watch the devil pakka believer hallelujah probably that God you understanding eraser watch the stubbornness the indifference of man has broke up godly fear and brotherly love takes a space in the human heart then it becomes salty then the message will have the preeminence is in the heart it will have influence in the city we could scream shout do whatever we want will never influence man until they see the life of Christ being projected in you someone who stand and merciful forgiving ready to run the other side of the cheek or give a second coat or go a second man Christianity in action not just taught from the pulpit but acted among the members among the pastor's that's when you see Christ living in the church Oh hallelujah yes Christ in action not just in teachings people love the teachings it is intellectually stimulating and it stimulates the gray matter in front or behind the head but the action life that's different that's applied Christianity Oh glory to God you come later go to school you learn knowledge but you have to apply the knowledge down apply the Christianity where you have to love your wife where you have to listen carefully to your husband and talk how to talk the same language at least that he will understand what you've seen and you will understand what he's saying and you want to understand what you seen because you are there to be a helpmeet not the other way around even going that's okay still the truth right you see Christ living in a church decisions are made over here and before when the Calvary the father brought his own son into a conference and Gethsemane while angels taking their positions to see what the decisions would be so Jesus was having a conference in the gonna get cemani angels at their poster duty watching to see what the Son of God will do anything if it is possible let this cup pass nevertheless not my will but thy will be done he was confronted by decisions and that's all our lives will be confronted by decisions on choices and upon the choices you will see whole life unfold for you and Jesus took the decision to go to Calvary it was a hard choice but that's what the father presented to him a cup of death a bitter cup a cup of cruelty whipped beaten embarrassed humiliated shipped up his clothing but he was going to pay a price because he saw people coming forth like the power of the blood being released go when the blood was shed the spirit came out and that spirit was to hunt every predestinated seeded that is why you're here this morning because the spirit found you go give the Lord some previous people do you understand what I'm saying there are so many people right off this one and right off that one because they write talking their minds and got a write off notes when I got in right of that one if God was writing on rate of all of us for all our sin that come short of the glory of God but the Bible teaches God so loved the world we have to stretch amen amen Oh hallelujah are you ready for some more watch if God acted any one time on a certain circumstance and if that same circumstance arise again he's got the ark a second time like he did the first time oh he's unjust no matter how bad you are in sin how stupid they become he has got to act to you like he did that fallen woman or he acted wrong them that is and here we go God's behavior is his person what he is in his behavior declares his person and that's the way you are in your behavior of life tells what you are as you went on lesson to you two days ago the Methodist people wanted to declare when you're shot you got it the Pentacles don't see when you spoke it down I got it the shake can say when you shake I got it what your life declares it your person declares what you are so it's not when you shout people want them simpleton identification or when you have this when you're on this when you believe this and so forth they want that but what about when you have the life when they can manifest his works when you can manifest his presence when you can live something that is more important but but people come like if all of you is a believer but it has to be more than that because even the devil believe and tremble but you have to believe and go on and to possess what you know is your so our revelation have to come to you as an individual because you're kind of possesses as a church because your name is you join heritance is yours you cannot take somebody's hair is your glory look juices heated by his brothers and I see he was set up to be hidden so I love them openly give him a quote openly love them openly his brothers got a fight with that his brothers wasn't feeling that love from the father dividual that was feeling it plus dress of my dreams that's even more complicated so they had enough on him to get rid of him they say know what let me solve a problem get rid of him and that's what God wanted know you may not think that way and you may not like the experience of being stripped of being give up by your family and and separated and so on and penis plenty pimping for Joseph he's young he's in pain left to the Egyptians to take him over isn't that right his father is paying because Sonny he loves is now gone and they bring a coat with blood and it seemed like he somebody kill him and eat him or whatever the animal and so on there's a lot of pain but God smilin God was not in pain go to see at last at last my son is gently being guided into his position to be at the right hand of Pharaoh he doesn't know that yet he doesn't understand that yet that vision is for a point of time the vision I give him is from a point of time it got to come to pass because the word that I spoke it will not be prolonged it will come to pass so Joseph had to Egypt by force what was it force or was it a gentle hand of Jehovah using the Egyptian taskmasters to bring his son to be position any place to be ruler how the knee because Joseph is coming hallelujah you see when you understand that no child nothing gonna stop you from confessing Romans 8:28 oh we know that all things work together for good to them that love God the demo1 d called according to his purpose

bowing with what a chief as it was his brothers no comment trips into Egypt for green Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah Joseph had every reason with all the life of Christ to put some licks on them had every reason with a lever Christ to give them would deal with them heavy but Joseph but the life of Christ sorry you gotta tell them God God send me ahead the trials over though that's in Delano the maturity is there the understanding is there God send me ahead to preserve life God has sent me ahead that I could be lord over you now without me being here what happened we all perish so let's bless the Lord all together and that is when you begin to understand God of a plan and purpose for your life the vision didn't mean what if I wouldn't make a move on one Joseph the vision didn't mean children go to prison deficient we need another week when the appointed time because you have told a butler when they get promoted remember me a Sunni Butler get his thing to serve you forget Joseph

can't hear your words so whatever you are the life that you live shows what kind of Spirit is in you oh praise go when Christ son of God was put to test it showed what he was when you are put to the test it will prove what you are your life always reflects wasn't inside of you so then you understand what the test is for the test is to bring out the real you so when you see of collapse under the test don't get Lex say you know what there's more than how to come out that's where no career breakthrough don't get frustrated oh god no your press towards the mark Borden's I sit down because I'm so fed up I'm frustrated I'm coming to church boy didn't talk that way he said forgetting in the past God ever keeping like a pass the dissident dodging it that yes never I get all of that but I'm come to tell you today I'm forgetting the king then your brothers behind you you're going this way I press the words the mark at the high corner Christ Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah we need some more people to press you need to press press away how many how many go to press our script if original the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses awaited sorry weak operation who boldly passing on along wouldn't help you charge my battery and I'll do this woman honey she can handle long not gonna press you you got a pressure here you you got to want to get in the kingdom of God is preached man pressed away where's the press what do you mean like the water with the blood issue that what she had to do we she's the example of pressing she had Paul guys big guy she crawled to the leg big men stand up there watching she over the heart face she undone do with that they had no feet they watching for signs they watching for light they working for cloud looking for rainbow she looking for no lights she just want to be healed and she pulled herself this is he you got to tell yourself something some of you not talking to yourself you need to tell yourself something when I come into church I see myself getting a preacher I see myself in the future I see myself in spa I see myself relax hallelujah I know I'm the pastor of this church so I come here look into God looking for the fine inspiration to minister to your need these are partial message this morning I'm looking for your needs to be met their needs inside of here I don't know all of us go inside there but the Spirit who shows the reigns of the heart the spirit knows what you are neither Loreena corner I want to salute all those who connected us on the Internet God know what y'all need of also god bless you hallelujah trust that the spirit speaks expressly to YouTube to give the victory tempo a life well hallelujah want to be a real question a real son a real man of God or you'll be seated or glory so the tests when you're put to the test it proves what you are your life always reflects what's on the in sight of you and bound by your sins make sure your sin will find you all that's what we're trying to say Jesus of course they try to belittle him Baram he said no they want to hurt your inference before the people that's the way you want to watch care for what you do walk like real men of God talk like men of God act like men of God live like men of God because the devil your adversary is going about like a roaring lion seeking what he may devour why did he do this why did it act like that to Jesus they were jealous of him that's the main reason they tried to belittle him they were jealous of his ministry and that's the reason they tried to belittle him he had a Ministry of God and they knew that but it was contrary their Creed's so the track were trying to belittle him make everything every little floor they could find that way they want him to quit they wanted him to quit they wanted the people that he knows him they wonder said no this guy's nothing look here o years how is this dis you know that's not right we've been told all our life we should believe the elders and here's the right down bald ear though what choice do what I've made if Jesus come back again and she does the security bunch Elvis in this message we are being taught by each rabbi oh yes true and this comes along and disagree with them that man ain't fit to be a preacher they were trying to belittle him but all of that the ones that believed him loved him they seen the scriptural mirco signs that would not be hindered back there no sir damn who believed him believe him those who loved them stood by him and brought they would not see what others pointed to them Oh hallelujah God always cause I ready they're not sure to hit the spiritual not the other way are wrong that events are in the light boy are you spiritual you'll be you'll be heated I told them at Olin Africa join the bunch Alleluia all those who work were not the perfection will be heated because Joseph was the word that's why he was heated Jesus was the word that's why he was heated the pride will be the word that's my she be heated join the bunch so don't think everybody will put a bookie over your flower over your head and put us row by a ring of flowers I wrong out your neck no no no no they wouldn't see with you because you are going to perfection oh praise God so what's something they're not trying to hit the spirit of course the kids hit evil it cause Cora to hit Moses it's called Judas to hit Jesus and on and on it goes is not right they tried to destroy the influence tried to destroy everything because nothing but jealousy started in Keene and proved was jealousy and its kind and then when the natural the Conner and the spirit on me together it proves seat an order we called jealousy comes from Satan and then causing an impersonation of truth Oh hallelujah if people don't want God's perfect will God give you a permissive will isn't that right God made a perfect will and it's perfect will isn't what we want today a man isn't that right so God wants his people to be one and the devil of a plan to try to put people under his one under his plan God has a plan and the devil has a plan I when the devil is trying to get all people on his plan while God is trying to get people to be under his plan there are two great spirits in the world one of them is a devil the other one is gone so all in your life there are just two influences everything is connected with those two not three not four just two is either the devil is inspiring something or God is inspiring something influence come towards or against hallelujah somebody could influence somebody against this church or watch this church somebody could influence people away from what is right or towards something that is wrong is to untrue that's how your influence and Jesus came to bring an influence of God upon the face of the earth they wanted an influence of a man to take power back from room until I said My Kingdom is not of this world so the inference you want I come to bring you that because you have men to fight for me my kingdom is of a different world altogether got that Rome and all and things just temporary isn't that right or what have you kept it is this temporary isn't that right so the devil of is messengers and Quatermain messengers and we had Liberty to take our choice to whom we would heal ourselves to so who have influence over your life up all over you are you hearing me whatever have influence over your life have the power over you that's why the adopted son must have dominion over himself before you have dominion over others and other things that's why Jesus was led into the wilderness that he get a pole or himself over the lust of the eyes the pride of life lust of the flesh when you overcome that he was ready to return in the power of the Spirit to deal with the humans because when you could deal with the devil humans are secondary because you're already deal with the devil it is written it is written it is written and he dealt with it never liked the word to prove we got a deal did ever like the world and overcome it is written it is written it is written then the Spirit come upon Jesus to really handle the devil until you with the devil and I brought I bring a tremendous thought in Uganda there he said the devil's Jesus the going to the pigs and Jesus give them their requests and if Jesus could give Devils their requests because the acts they're going to pigs do more mischief what about his sons and daughters the devil's asked Jesus let us crawl into the prints and Jesus said I allow you to I give you information like I answer your request what about you sons and daughters of God that should wake you up inside of here to make a request known unto God there's no good thing he really hold from you there is no good thing he would withhold from you let me say it good now there is no good thing he would withhold from you he won't appoint on you and let you come run over said my cup runneth over my cup runs over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life oh that's a man that I love that man loved God he anoints in the promises of God I look on to the hill so my coming my help my help comes from the Lord isn't that right oh praise God Amen so what the only two forms are gonna skip down Oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah you talked about United Nations everybody trying to get the unity everybody only same thing I watch it's choosing time you must choose you this day whom you're gonna serve the devil has presented many things glamorous that you can choose if you wish true isn't that right he said no you said when I unclean spirit here we go he's gone out of a man he walks in dries places and he's going around trying to find rest here we go a spirit is not very bad until he can find somebody he can talk to or live through so the spirit is harmless until it gets somebody he could talk to and work through just recently I could feel the spirit in a meeting all sending a letters of apology the first night I forgive you God does too when the meter was going on an evil spirit in the meeting and that spirit here we go is almost harmless until it can catch somebody it can work through watch then it kind of worked through it certainly be damaged because it's an evil spirit and the Holy Spirit is here trying to find somebody to work through and when it finds somebody to work through it can do good so it's two spirits their motives the objectives watch how it is watch their works watch their fruits and then you see what spirit is on you you are motivated by spirit are you hearing me this morning you are motivated by spirit if you have no spirit you are dead if you have spirit it motivates your life and your life bears the fruit of a Christian it's a Christian spirit if you're in the fruit of a Christian is not right you see it and deep quality people coming on the platform and Baram says you not a Christian what does he be man didn't speak there's a spirit that vibrate love the man that Barham know he's a Christian he said your Minister the gospel you're not here you here for revival he could discern the spirit of a Christian it sends out the vibration you don't have to even speak it with speaks for itself so when Jesus walking them Devils crying out because the devil seemed big bright light walking and other people watching him all invisible and those never seeing son of God hallelujah don't ever seem pretty bright light walk in the face of the earth catches about what they want to see what thousands of live voice is the Thunder of God don't know not and sweetness and humility undefined lies walking around the earth without the blemish Oh hallelujah hallelujah are you with me so what this spirit now goes out walks in dry places hunting the fine rest the bobber I said he could not find it so he said I'll return to where I come out of so it goes back to this person that he was was in and he find all the house swept cleaned up sanctified condemnation gone I read how a believer but it is empty he said come here seven other spirits worse that he was when you please try to get this the Bible said that's the truth jesus said it's the truth he comes back to this house a man who confessed Christ to be a savior got rid of his wickedness the Christians drinking quitting smoking his line is stealing he has become sanctified cleaned out he's always all swept if he's free he comes back find that house then he goes and gets seven other spirits who worse than he was comes into this person and the Bible said the last state of that person is seven times worse than wasn't the beginning was that I tell you our empty house is a target for the devil so we have to get the empty house filled with the Holy Ghost so you really have no time to waste you have time to be hungry none Tilson looking to be filled with the Holy Ghost because the devil look at my empty clean house and he know he got kicked out so he's not coming by himself so I got takeout again he needs some help so he gets seven more and they're not gonna be bad and he was those seven worst and him to help pass down the door to come and occupy your house but today the Bible said when the enemy coming like a flood the Spirit of God raised a standard so we have been living this morning that's time that will be raised in your life o blessed be the Lord hallelujah hallelujah so watch if you are filled with the world of us God sent the Holy Spirit to the earth to motivate the church you might be filled with toys you might be filled with geology you might have an education you might be filled with religion and still be a target of the devil or watch when God made you that you could empty I love that when you are born you was made with a place to be filled by Nietzsche you're a child of the devil the evangelists come along you repent get cleaned up you see what the devil comes he brings back to you and sets you in some little denomination and say our church is the biggest one and then you get heady highminded why don't condemn it just stay home watch television it doesn't condemn me to smoke a little friendly cigarette your food tell you what you are no watch and then somebody come and talk about miracle you sit down somebody said don't believe that we don't believe it and then you get behind it is the same motive that was in store be there God don't want that he don't want us United all on the Methodists under Baptist or any Church Dominion he wants united under his spiritual Kingdom the Holy Spirit and when the Holy Spirit comes the world becomes dead and you are filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the devil is a person that has to stay away from you you are under court domain so with the Holy Ghost inside of you that devil of the get permission he will stay away from you because he got shocked when Jesus touch when he had a touch I need a favor Jesus in the wilderness isn't that right so God made you a place that you could be emptied out oh praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and Jesus would not permit the disciples to preach the gospel until they receive the Holy Ghost that been honored to walk with him for three and a half years they were holy men accepted in his sight but he would not let them preach until they waited up there and got all the
