[42:33] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[42:35] soon as I had eaten it my belly was
[42:39] bitter and he said unto me thou must

[45:04] we pray and ask it amen and amen glory

[45:09] feels good in here tonight we're happy
[45:11] to be in his presence
[45:15] amen thank you so much amen well praise
[45:19] God okay so for just for a few moments
[45:22] tonight we just have a thought I want to
[45:23] share by the grace of God so my title
[45:27] tonight is go and take am that's my
[45:31] title tonight go and take and of course
[45:36] as we know um this comes directly out of
[45:40] the word of God tonight the scriptures
[45:42] that we
[45:43] read um right here in Revelation 10
[45:46] which you just read tonight amen am and
[45:49] this was a voice that was speaking with
[45:51] John yes um on the aisle of Patmos amen
[45:57] and usually when you read the scripture
[45:58] we read it um under the light of Malachi
[46:02] 4 message of the revealed word sir um
[46:06] which is which is quite all right but
[46:08] tonight I wanted to kind of think about
[46:11] for a few moments John in the context of
[46:14] the scripture just as he is receiving
[46:18] these Heavenly pictures or these
[46:21] Heavenly visions that are coming to him
[46:25] while on the aisle of Patmos
[46:27] in a situation that looked like he's um
[46:31] rejected or looked like he's
[46:33] abandoned or it looked like he was cast
[46:37] away um but that wasn't so in the
[46:40] program of God cuz in God's program he
[46:44] was right where he needed him to
[46:46] be John was right where God wanted him
[46:50] to be so that he could reveal to him
[46:53] these Mighty Revelations that we have as
[46:56] The Book of
[46:57] Revelations as the prophet described as
[47:00] the book of symbols and so forth like
[47:03] that isn't that right so sometimes we
[47:05] feel like we're in a situation where we
[47:08] are Cast Away or we might feel like
[47:10] we're in a place where we were me
[47:13] abandoned or or rejected but sometimes
[47:16] that is exactly where God wants us to
[47:20] be because he can't use us until he's
[47:23] got us alone somewhere where he could
[47:26] speak speak to our hearts and show us
[47:29] something that could shake us into the
[47:32] time and the season that we are living
[47:34] in isn't that right and it's time for
[47:37] the bride tonight to recognize her day
[47:41] and her message and what she is called
[47:44] to do tonight amen and what we see ought
[47:47] to make a church that would make a
[47:51] Revival that people will come flying in
[47:54] to see the seven Thunders that are not
[47:57] even written are being made manifest
[48:00] upon the people the seeed that the
[48:03] people have found that lost coin that
[48:07] the that the bride had lost throughout
[48:08] the ages the bride at the end time is
[48:11] going to find that coin that was lost
[48:14] and the prophet said when she finds her
[48:16] brotherly love when she finds her holy
[48:20] decency and when the church finds her
[48:22] place in Christ then she's going to call
[48:26] to the other members of the body and
[48:30] she'll say come and rejoice with me come
[48:34] and rejoice with us because we found
[48:37] something that we have lost amen isn't
[48:41] that right amen and I was so inspired by
[48:44] Brother ovid's message on Sunday amen
[48:48] talking about going back to something
[48:51] Hallelujah that once was that God had
[48:54] once delivered to the church amen going
[48:57] back to the apostolic faith going back
[49:00] to the typos going back to the old
[49:03] Landmark that was set in the book of
[49:06] Acts where holy men spake as they were
[49:09] moved by the Holy Ghost oh and it's a
[49:13] Holy Ghost Land of promises that we are
[49:17] promised to go back to in this day oh
[49:20] Hallelujah and tonight I believe that we
[49:23] are inspired that there is a group on
[49:26] the Earth tonight that are inspired to
[49:29] go and take what God has for you tonight
[49:34] oh hallelujah hallelujah we're here
[49:36] tonight we're here to go we're here to
[49:40] take it amen and that word take just
[49:43] kept coming to me over and over and as I
[49:46] dove into it this is what Cann of come
[49:48] out go and take the book that voice that
[49:52] spoke with John yes here it is he saw
[49:55] the mighty Angel come down
[49:57] clothed with a clown Hallelujah rainbow
[50:00] upon his head feet as it were pillars of
[50:04] fire face shining like the sun
[50:06] Hallelujah isn't that right and he had
[50:09] in his hand this little book open isn't
[50:12] that right and he's instructed by this
[50:16] by the voice that speaketh with him
[50:18] saying go to that angel and take the
[50:22] book isn't that right and I love how
[50:25] that voice spoke to him
[50:27] The Voice didn't say go to a
[50:29] man it didn't say go to a group it
[50:32] didn't say go to an
[50:34] organization but it said go to that
[50:36] angel that standeth upon the sea and
[50:39] upon the Earth that has the book in his
[50:42] hand and take the book that is in his
[50:45] hand isn't that right and so we're
[50:48] talking about go and take and this
[50:51] speaks of two things isn't that right
[50:54] first we have to go isn't that right
[50:57] going is a sense of direction you have
[51:01] to know where you're going in order to
[51:03] go where you're going you can't just go
[51:06] anywhere it's not being led by your own
[51:09] mind isn't that right in John's account
[51:12] of the angel of Revelation 10 John is
[51:16] pointed in the direction of this Angel
[51:19] and he is told to go and take the little
[51:22] book that is open in the hand of that
[51:25] angel he wasn't sent to a man he was
[51:29] sent to that angel and we believe the
[51:32] True Church of God today isn't being led
[51:35] by a man but it's being led by that
[51:38] angel it is not a group it is not an
[51:41] organization it's not a group think it
[51:44] is not how we feel about it oh but the
[51:48] angel of the Lord is sent to go
[51:51] everywhere with us and confirm the word
[51:54] of God with signs one do and with
[51:57] Miracles
[51:58] following isn't that right who is that
[52:02] angel let's answer that question tonight
[52:05] the prophet said here is anything too
[52:07] hard for the
[52:09] Lord uh in paragraph 26 he says remember
[52:14] Jesus Christ the son of God Amen said
[52:17] that same thing would repeat again yes
[52:19] as it was in the days of Sodom so shall
[52:23] it be in the coming of the son of man
[52:27] that God would be working through human
[52:31] flesh oh hallelujah hallelujah he wants
[52:33] to work through human flesh oh
[52:37] Hallelujah so thinking not strange you
[52:39] are here tonight God wants to work
[52:42] through your flesh
[52:44] tonight he has no hands but your hands
[52:48] he has no feet but your feet but God is
[52:52] raising up a bride in this last day to
[52:56] be a witness of his resurrection power
[53:00] in this lisian age do you believe it
[53:03] tonight God wants to work through you
[53:06] tonight he wants to use your hands he
[53:09] wants to use your feet he wants to use
[53:12] your mouth he wants to go where you go
[53:15] Hall and at the right time he put words
[53:18] in your mouth Hallelujah to speak to
[53:22] them to confound the wise because it'll
[53:25] be the wisdom of God God speaking not
[53:28] the wisdom of man amen oh Hallelujah
[53:31] that God would be working through human
[53:35] flesh doing the same thing that he did
[53:39] then amen he'd be doing it today isn't
[53:42] that right oh God Prophet said help us
[53:45] to wake up the day of visitation is here
[53:50] you say oh God doesn't send Angels
[53:54] anymore he said but the holy spirit is
[53:58] that angel oh there's our answer tonight
[54:02] who's that angel the prophet said that
[54:04] the holy spirit is that angel he said
[54:08] the holy spirit is that person oh that
[54:13] person of Christ oh Hallelujah Halle the
[54:15] holy spirit it's not you it's not me
[54:18] it's a person he said the Holy Spirit
[54:21] Jesus said he the Holy Ghost the prophet
[54:25] said when he comes comes when he comes

[54:37] things to our
[54:39] remembrance that he taught and would
[54:42] show us of things to come oh Hallelujah
[54:46] isn't that right glory to God hallelujah
[54:49] hallelujah when Jesus come back Amen in
[54:51] his resurrection Ministry he unlocked
[54:54] their understanding to the scriptures
[54:57] and many of the things he shared with
[54:58] them when he was yet with them in
[55:02] Galilee and in Jerusalem and and
[55:04] different places but in that hour oh
[55:07] hallel the word was not yet quickened to
[55:09] them but when he come back after his
[55:12] death his burial and his resurrection he
[55:15] come back to them and he breathed upon
[55:19] them receive you the Holy Ghost and all
[55:22] of a sudden the word that they were
[55:25] hearing all the while

[55:30] quickened to them oh he the Holy Spirit
[55:33] he Jesus Christ was finally revealing
[55:36] back the word to them that they had
[55:39] already heard oh he was recycling back
[55:42] all of the promises isn't that right and
[55:46] the prophet said God is obligated to
[55:49] meet you on the basis of them promises
[55:54] oh Hallelujah outside of them promises

[1:07:54] that right Hal hallelujah amen so what
[1:07:57] the children of Israel so here's a point
[1:07:59] we're trying to make what the children
[1:08:01] of Israel was doing as an act of
[1:08:03] possession was also an act of
[1:08:07] repossession isn't that right so it was
[1:08:10] like possession and repossession was
[1:08:13] happening at the same time because the
[1:08:15] children of Israel was going back for
[1:08:17] the land that God had sworn to their
[1:08:20] fathers God called Abraham out isn't
[1:08:22] that right so many years ago and said I
[1:08:26] give you this land isn't that right look
[1:08:28] to the north look to the South look to
[1:08:30] the East and the West all this land
[1:08:33] belongs to you isn't that right but then
[1:08:36] that horrible dream Came Upon him isn't
[1:08:38] that right and God showed him that this
[1:08:40] people would sojourn in a Strange Land
[1:08:43] and with a mighty hand he would bring
[1:08:46] them out amen hallelujah and that
[1:08:49] prophecy unfolded over time until it
[1:08:52] come down into Joseph and how they came
[1:08:55] out from there into Egypt and sojourned
[1:08:58] there isn't that right praise God and
[1:09:00] that whole thing unfolded but that land
[1:09:03] where they lived praise God was
[1:09:06] originally where God had placed his his
[1:09:09] uh his his people at that time that was
[1:09:11] a land that he swore unto their fathers
[1:09:13] to give them Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:09:16] but now it had been overrun with
[1:09:18] Hittites and jebusites and parasites so
[1:09:21] God send Moses down there to get my
[1:09:24] people out
[1:09:25] not just to deliver them from slavery
[1:09:28] not just to save you from sin but to
[1:09:30] bring you out into your own land a land
[1:09:33] of possession a land of inheritance a
[1:09:37] land flowing with milk and honey a land
[1:09:41] flowing with the Holy Ghost a land with
[1:09:44] healing in it a land with Deliverance in
[1:09:46] it a land with breakthrough in it yes
[1:09:49] there's wars in the land but God
[1:09:52] promised to give you Victory and as
[1:09:54] Caleb said
[1:09:56] if the Lord be with me then I shall be
[1:09:59] able to drive out the enemy as the Lord
[1:10:03] had said oh Hallelujah you have the
[1:10:07] ability tonight oh God is with us and
[1:10:10] he's going to help us to drive out all
[1:10:14] of the foreigners in this land and
[1:10:17] establish for us a land PR a Holy Ghost
[1:10:21] Land of promises
[1:10:23] amen so you see that that tonight amen
[1:10:26] it was a repossession of the land that
[1:10:28] he originally established with Abraham
[1:10:30] and Isaac and so forth like that they
[1:10:32] were coming back to repossess and in
[1:10:35] their possession or in their possessing
[1:10:39] they were also repossessing isn't that
[1:10:42] right and it makes me think of what we
[1:10:44] are called to do in this last days we
[1:10:47] are called to possess a land a Holy
[1:10:50] Ghost Land of promises another Ephesians
[1:10:53] and the best part about it is that it
[1:10:55] was once delivered to the Saints oh
[1:10:58] we're not talking about a new thing it's
[1:11:01] not a new theology it's not a new idea
[1:11:05] oh Hallelujah isn't that right but it
[1:11:07] was once delivered Peter once had it
[1:11:10] Mary once had it oh they received that
[1:11:13] coin and you are going to receive that
[1:11:16] same Penny tonight oh hallelujah
[1:11:20] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that
[1:11:22] Gentile bride that 11 hour worker is
[1:11:26] promised to receive the same pay the
[1:11:29] same Penny the same Holy Ghost oh
[1:11:33] hallelujah hallelujah if he healed in
[1:11:35] times past he's going to heal today
[1:11:38] because he's the same God tonight if
[1:11:40] that God if that spirit that raised
[1:11:44] Christ from the dead ever dwells in your
[1:11:47] body he will do the same Works he did in
[1:11:51] you like he did back then if he healed a
[1:11:54] sick then he'll heal the sick today if
[1:11:57] he deliver then he'll deliver tonight if
[1:12:01] he made more way if he restored if he
[1:12:05] did Miracles he'll do it again tonight
[1:12:08] because he's the same God doing the same
[1:12:11] things acting the same way like they did
[1:12:15] in the upper room oh they were drunk men
[1:12:18] they came out with stammer and lips
[1:12:21] people wanted to know what noise is this
[1:12:24] oh Hallelujah Hallelujah and Peter spoke
[1:12:27] to them hallelujah oh by the inspiration
[1:12:29] of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and they
[1:12:32] were pricked in their hearts Hallelujah
[1:12:34] and as men and Brethren what shall we do
[1:12:37] to be saved my that same spirit is
[1:12:40] coming back again do you believe it
[1:12:43] tonight so there's both a possession and
[1:12:45] a repossession being done amen is that
[1:12:48] right through the bride in the last days
[1:12:50] and that isn't that right repos we're
[1:12:52] reclaiming going back amen taking
[1:12:55] backwards rightfully hours it's a work
[1:12:57] of
[1:12:58] restoration restoring the church again
[1:13:00] isn't that right or rebuilding the
[1:13:02] church again under the power of the
[1:13:04] spirit Seven Virtues God is now bringing
[1:13:06] us back into our inheritance isn't that
[1:13:10] right yes sir and this little book we
[1:13:12] find Revelation 5 was a closed book so
[1:13:15] we said go and take the ink the book
[1:13:17] that is in the hand of the angel that
[1:13:19] was open right but in Revelation 5 it
[1:13:22] was actually a closed book no man was
[1:13:24] found worthy to take that book needed to
[1:13:28] look there on so this act of taking this
[1:13:31] book that was in the right hand of him
[1:13:34] that sat upon the throne this act of
[1:13:37] Taken was an authoritative right isn't
[1:13:40] that
[1:13:42] right a right to take a right to possess
[1:13:47] a right to take up a a position or to
[1:13:51] take up an authority but the Bible said
[1:13:53] no man was found
[1:13:55] worthy no man in Heaven Nor in the earth
[1:13:58] neither under the Earth Hallelujah was
[1:14:01] able to open the book neither to look
[1:14:03] thereon and John said I wept much
[1:14:05] because no man was found worthy isn't
[1:14:07] that right but one of the elders said
[1:14:09] unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the
[1:14:12] tribe of Judah the root of David had
[1:14:15] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:14:18] the seal thereof and behold and L in the
[1:14:21] midst of the throne and the four beasts
[1:14:23] in the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[1:14:25] as it had been slain having seven horns
[1:14:30] and seven eyes which are the seven
[1:14:33] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[1:14:36] Earth isn't that right and he came and
[1:14:39] the Bible said he took the book out of
[1:14:41] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:14:44] throne and when he had taken the book oh
[1:14:48] aren't you glad he took the book tonight
[1:14:51] because he took it you can now take it
[1:14:55] for yourself oh no man was found worthy
[1:14:58] to take it but because he took it oh now
[1:15:01] you are being told to go and take the
[1:15:05] open book that is in the hand of this
[1:15:08] Mighty Angel oh what a privilege what an
[1:15:12] honor do we have tonight oh Hallelujah
[1:15:15] because he overcame you are going to
[1:15:17] overcome also because greater is he that
[1:15:20] is in you than he that is in the world
[1:15:24] oh oh Hallelujah because he died you
[1:15:27] died in him and when he rose you Rose
[1:15:30] victoriously and when he took that book
[1:15:33] oh John said they sung a new song saying
[1:15:36] thou was worthy to take the book and to
[1:15:39] open the seals thereof for thou was
[1:15:41] slain and has redeemed us to God out of
[1:15:45] every Kindred and nation and tongue and
[1:15:47] so forth isn't that right oh my
[1:15:51] Hallelujah he possessed it took it
[1:15:56] and then that possession was a
[1:15:57] repossession because this book was Adam
[1:16:00] had it first isn't that right the first
[1:16:02] Adam he created and he was supposed to
[1:16:05] speak the names from that book but he
[1:16:07] fell by sin and he never got to be
[1:16:09] unfolded and as we always say the devil
[1:16:12] tried to grab a hold of it at that time
[1:16:15] but because his hands was slippery amen
[1:16:18] because he had greasy hands of unbelief
[1:16:20] he couldn't hold on to that book and
[1:16:23] that book went back into the hands of
[1:16:25] the original owner the him who sat on
[1:16:28] the throne with it in his right hand
[1:16:31] waiting for a worthy kinsman redeemer to
[1:16:35] step forward and reclaim what was
[1:16:38] originally lost through Adam and the
[1:16:39] fall oh Hallelujah so when he came and
[1:16:43] took the book it was a possession but it
[1:16:45] was also a repossession a retaking of
[1:16:49] our inheritance oh isn't that right
[1:16:52] Hallelujah and the prophet said in that
[1:16:54] book was a book of redemption oh and in
[1:16:57] that book was all the names that was to
[1:16:58] be called your name was there my name
[1:17:02] was there but no one was found worthy to
[1:17:05] unseal to loose and to Break Free the
[1:17:09] contents of the book no one was worthy
[1:17:11] to open and to loose and to break free
[1:17:15] your life from out of the book of life
[1:17:18] but one was found worthy tonight oh
[1:17:20] Behold a lamb slain before the
[1:17:23] foundation of the world
[1:17:25] he was worthy to open the book tonight
[1:17:29] and that is why I'm here tonight to
[1:17:31] shout and to give God praise because
[1:17:34] someone was found worthy oh to save you
[1:17:38] and I to redeem you and I and because he
[1:17:42] took it we can now take our
[1:17:46] inheritance oh our inheritance in life
[1:17:50] everything that Adam lost can now be
[1:17:52] restored to us in this last day
[1:17:55] because he took it first amen amen he
[1:17:59] went out
[1:18:00] first he took the bullet as it was died
[1:18:04] for us paid a price to make a way for
[1:18:07] rest of us to come rid in through
[1:18:09] salvation come riding through all the
[1:18:11] way through the
[1:18:12] Redemption the Lamb of God that uh uh
[1:18:16] paid for the sins of the world isn't
[1:18:17] that right oh my we love him tonight
[1:18:20] Deuteronomy
[1:18:22] 29:29 says the secret things belong unto
[1:18:24] the Lord Our God but those things which
[1:18:27] are revealed belong unto us and to our
[1:18:31] children forever that we may do all the
[1:18:35] words of this law Hallelujah so once it
[1:18:38] is a secret Jesus said isn't that right
[1:18:40] it remains a secret isn't that right
[1:18:42] Jesus said it's not for you to know the
[1:18:44] times or the seasons which your father
[1:18:47] had put in his power hallah it's not for
[1:18:49] you to know the times they were asking
[1:18:52] him as he was ascending into heaven how
[1:18:55] long when are these things going to be
[1:18:58] uh they were anxious they were nervous
[1:19:00] they knew that the end was coming and
[1:19:03] they wanted they had a question on their
[1:19:05] hearts as their master was leaving them
[1:19:08] this glorified Son of God and the answer
[1:19:11] he gave them was that it is not for you
[1:19:13] to know the times or the seasons which
[1:19:16] the father had put in his own power in
[1:19:19] other words I can't tell you the time
[1:19:21] the father has that in his mind that's
[1:19:24] his secret that belongs to him uh God is
[1:19:28] Sovereign and he is allowed to keep what
[1:19:31] he wants to keep but whatever he reveals
[1:19:34] to you that belongs to you tonight
[1:19:37] whatever he opens or unveils to you that
[1:19:41] actually belongs to us tonight so we now
[1:19:44] may not know when tonight but what we do
[1:19:47] know Jesus said is that you shall
[1:19:50] receive power I can't tell you when it's
[1:19:53] going to happen all you have to do is T
[1:19:57] in the upper room wait in Jerusalem I
[1:20:00] can't tell you when but I can tell you
[1:20:03] one thing of assurance that you shall
[1:20:06] receive power you are going to receive
[1:20:09] power after the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:20:13] you and you're going to be a witness a
[1:20:16] witness of Jesus Christ on the earth
[1:20:20] you're going to walk and talk like Jesus
[1:20:23] Christ you're going to do the work works
[1:20:25] that he did you're going to heal the
[1:20:27] sick raise the Dead cast out Devils all
[1:20:31] that was G Christ would be poured into
[1:20:34] the church at that hour oh won't it be a
[1:20:38] time tonight when he fully manifest
[1:20:42] himself oh it is going to happen tonight
[1:20:45] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:20:49] if it's revealed it belongs to you if
[1:20:53] your healing has been revealed then that
[1:20:55] belongs to you if your inheritance has
[1:20:58] been revealed then that belongs to you
[1:21:00] tonight if your deliverance your
[1:21:03] breakthrough whatever you have need of

[1:21:21] you could boil me roast me chop my head
[1:21:24] off
[1:21:25] you cannot change what God has put in my
[1:21:28] heart oh and if God put something in
[1:21:30] your heart tonight it shall happen
[1:21:33] because God said so oh hallelujah oh he
[1:21:39] promised the Holy Ghost and we're here

[1:25:54] me skip in there we got all this
[1:25:56] wonderful amen exposition of seven
[1:25:58] Church ages Revelation Jesus Christ said
[1:26:01] if Revelation is beyond you Prophet said
[1:26:03] look up and seek God for it he said that
[1:26:07] is the only way you're ever going to get
[1:26:10] it so if you want to go and take tonight
[1:26:13] it's got to be revealed to you what
[1:26:15] you're going to take this is it here if
[1:26:18] the if it's beyond you look up and seek
[1:26:20] God that is the only way you're ever
[1:26:23] going to get it amen a revelation has to
[1:26:26] come from God he said it never comes by
[1:26:30] human natural endowments but by
[1:26:33] spiritual
[1:26:34] enduement you can even memorize the
[1:26:37] scripture he said and though that is
[1:26:39] wonderful that won't do it it has to be
[1:26:43] a revelation from God it says in the
[1:26:46] word that no man can say that Jesus is
[1:26:48] the Christ except by the Holy Ghost you
[1:26:52] have to receive the holy ghost He said
[1:26:54] and then and only then can the spirit
[1:26:58] give you the Revelation that Jesus
[1:27:01] Christ Jesus is the Christ God the
[1:27:04] anointed one oh how we need the baptism
[1:27:07] of the Holy Ghost tonight isn't that
[1:27:08] right he promised it let's be under
[1:27:11] expectation he said no man knows the
[1:27:12] things of God save the spirit of God and
[1:27:16] He To Whom the spirit of God is
[1:27:18] revealing it to them so no man can know
[1:27:20] the things of God unless between the
[1:27:23] spirit of God and the man to whom it's
[1:27:25] being revealed that that communication
[1:27:28] is taking place isn't that right it must
[1:27:30] be a direct line isn't that it can't
[1:27:33] come through a Library of Congress or or
[1:27:37] some other high and mighty place no no
[1:27:40] no it's got to come straight from God
[1:27:42] isn't that right it's a relationship
[1:27:45] between you and the spirit of God
[1:27:48] revealing things showing you things
[1:27:51] isn't that right just like in Eden when
[1:27:53] God had fellowship with man and spoke to
[1:27:56] him in the cool of the evening God wants
[1:27:59] to establish that relationship with you
[1:28:01] tonight and that is how we will ever
[1:28:03] know the things of God isn't that right
[1:28:06] we need to call on the prophet said we
[1:28:07] need to call on God for Revelation more
[1:28:10] than anything else in the world he said
[1:28:13] we have accepted the Bible we have
[1:28:15] accepted the great truths of it but it
[1:28:18] is still not real to most people because
[1:28:22] the Revelation by the spirit is not
[1:28:25] there and the word has not been
[1:28:27] quickened he said wow food for thought
[1:28:31] right okay so let's move on quickly so
[1:28:34] by revelation we are going we are going
[1:28:35] tonight amen we're going to a land of
[1:28:39] possession God promised us a land and
[1:28:42] it's a Holy Ghost Land of promises where
[1:28:45] we are actually going to take and
[1:28:48] possess again amen praise God Omega
[1:28:52] bride possessing again isn't that right
[1:28:54] Hallelujah okay Matthew
[1:28:56] 11:12 it says and from the days of John
[1:28:59] the Baptist until now the Kingdom of
[1:29:02] Heaven suffered violence and the
[1:29:05] violence take it by force oh there's
[1:29:08] that word take again oh Hallelujah God
[1:29:10] wants and requires a certain kind of an
[1:29:13] attitude from you oh hallelujah it's got
[1:29:16] to be a certain level of of Grimace oh h
[1:29:20] of of of of of of
[1:29:22] determination of persistence
[1:29:24] isn't that right like that woman isn't
[1:29:26] that right whose daughter was vexed with
[1:29:28] the devil they said she was crying
[1:29:30] continually crying continually towards
[1:29:33] God toward Jesus at that time isn't that
[1:29:35] right until she became a nuisance until
[1:29:38] she became a nuisance to the disciples
[1:29:41] oh H and say they want to know why this
[1:29:43] dog is bothering us because she's of A
[1:29:45] different race she's of a different
[1:29:47] culture she's a woman for crying out
[1:29:50] loud why is she bothering Jesus but that
[1:29:53] woman had a need she didn't care what
[1:29:56] they called her she didn't care what
[1:29:58] they said about her her daughter was
[1:30:00] vexed with the devil and when you have a
[1:30:03] need you don't care what they call you
[1:30:06] you don't care what they say to you even
[1:30:09] Jesus said oh it's not fit to take the
[1:30:12] children's bread and to cast it to dogs
[1:30:15] and she said truth Lord that's true but
[1:30:18] I'm a dog I accept that and all I want
[1:30:21] tonight is just some crumb
[1:30:24] from off the master's table oh if I am a
[1:30:28] dog oh then surely the dogs could get
[1:30:30] something tonight oh Hallelujah surely
[1:30:33] there's something a little extra
[1:30:35] something a little left over after all
[1:30:37] the children have eaten surely the dogs
[1:30:40] could get something tonight oh I come
[1:30:42] for whatever I come for the crumbs oh
[1:30:45] what you come for tonight are you under

[1:30:50] expectation hallu hallu we are not dogs
[1:30:55] we are not
[1:30:56] Castaways we are children of the father
[1:30:59] and yet this woman with a Persistence of
[1:31:02] spirit was able to get something from
[1:31:05] the Lord with her attitude isn't that
[1:31:07] right oh Hallelujah because she said the
[1:31:10] right thing praise God she got what she
[1:31:13] wanted hallelujah amen amen hallelujah
[1:31:16] isn't that right praise God so don't
[1:31:18] worry if you come across a little
[1:31:20] Annoying praise God that's exactly what
[1:31:22] God wants keep at it until you get what
[1:31:26] you come for amen amen oh the faith that
[1:31:29] was once delivered to the Saints the
[1:31:31] faith that we're going to receive
[1:31:33] possess and possess tonight was actually
[1:31:35] once delivered huj once before isn't
[1:31:37] that right and it will be delivered
[1:31:39] again yes sir it's a work of restoration
[1:31:43] isn't that right restoration of the Bri
[1:31:44] tree the prophet said here 1962 he said
[1:31:47] now I rush home and got my dictionary
[1:31:48] and so forth some scripture notes begin
[1:31:50] to copy things down then I got Webster's
[1:31:53] Dictionary to find find out the right
[1:31:55] definition for the word restore he
[1:31:58] looked it up he said to restore means to
[1:32:00] return to the former owner or to bring
[1:32:04] back to the former estate of condition
[1:32:08] oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that
[1:32:11] right before sin came in the picture you
[1:32:13] were perfect oh Hallelujah without
[1:32:15] blemish you are spotless you only come
[1:32:18] now born in sin shaping iniquity you
[1:32:21] come into the world speaking lies but
[1:32:22] before the beginning oh before there was
[1:32:25] a moon before there was a star you were
[1:32:28] perfect in God's mind so this work of
[1:32:30] restoration is to bring you back to a
[1:32:33] state of condition that you once had in
[1:32:37] before the beginning oh hallelujah it's
[1:32:39] only the devil's lie that you come into
[1:32:41] this condition but this is not your only
[1:32:44] home this is not your only hope where
[1:32:47] was down when I laid the foundations of
[1:32:49] the earth and the morning Stars sang
[1:32:52] together and the Sun of God shouting for
[1:32:54] Joy you were those sons of God tonight
[1:32:58] shouting for Joy you were those sons of
[1:33:01] God tonight shouting and leaping and
[1:33:04] praising God you saw the lamb took the
[1:33:07] book and loosed the seals oh Hallelujah
[1:33:10] isn't that
[1:33:11] right amen amen it's a work of
[1:33:14] restoration Hallelujah that I will
[1:33:16] restore okay to restore to a former
[1:33:18] owner to bring back to a former estate
[1:33:20] of condition he said and we can enforce
[1:33:23] a claim to be restored he said that
[1:33:26] that's what Webster says to bring back
[1:33:28] to the former owner or to back bring
[1:33:31] back to a former state of condition and
[1:33:34] if a claim is made on something see you
[1:33:37] take it you're claiming something uh to
[1:33:41] make that restoration the prophet said
[1:33:43] you can enforce it and make it come back
[1:33:47] to its rightful place oh Hallelujah
[1:33:50] isn't that right praise God he said may
[1:33:52] God bless these feeble words he say so
[1:33:54] to restore means to bring back to
[1:33:55] restore a claim can be enforced isn't
[1:33:58] that right Hallelujah so he said to
[1:34:00] restore a claim can be enforced isn't
[1:34:03] that right now to bring anything back to
[1:34:04] his rightful owner where it belongs he
[1:34:08] said therefore some way it went from its
[1:34:10] rightful owner it can rander around
[1:34:13] anywhere but to restore is to bring it
[1:34:16] back to who really owns it oh hallelujah
[1:34:21] hallelujah you might have been lost in
[1:34:22] sin lost in filth lost in the world but
[1:34:26] if you belong to God then there's a
[1:34:28] claim going out tonight to restore you
[1:34:32] back to where you once was oh hallelujah
[1:34:36] hallelujah isn't that right glory to God
[1:34:39] that's why that seed in your soul cannot
[1:34:41] be lost because if God put that seed in
[1:34:43] there doesn't matter what condition
[1:34:46] arounds the seed has a law in it and the
[1:34:50] law of life that is in Christ Jesus Oh
[1:34:53] is in that sea tonight oh and that law
[1:34:56] is what sets you free from the law of
[1:34:59] sin and death oh Hallelujah they could
[1:35:02] put you in a bar they could put you in a
[1:35:03] rum shop but that seed was always in
[1:35:06] there oh how you could be around
[1:35:08] marijuana around the wrong company but
[1:35:11] if God put that seed in there tonight
[1:35:14] there's a time there's a countdown on
[1:35:16] that seed oh at the right hour at the
[1:35:20] right season Once light strikes that
[1:35:23] seed it's got to come back to life oh
[1:35:26] hallelujah
[1:35:28] hallelujah amen amen and there's a la to
[1:35:32] enforce this rightful condition to
[1:35:34] enforce it so it's like you put in an
[1:35:37] application for something but now you
[1:35:39] could enforce that and and and make it
[1:35:42] happen praise God say I put this through

[1:39:17] Moses so I be with thee he said now
[1:39:19] Joshua the new Warrior only two left now
[1:39:21] that'll ever reach the Promised Land was
[1:39:23] Joshua and Caleb now Joshua the new
[1:39:25] Commander LED an army step into that
[1:39:27] place where a great man like Moses stood
[1:39:30] it was no little task he said and I
[1:39:33] think of a minister today that's called
[1:39:35] of God to step in the tracks where Jesus
[1:39:37] stood he said what a command what a
[1:39:39] commission you can begin to play
[1:39:41] something softly but each of you uh but
[1:39:43] each of that called of God each of us
[1:39:46] that's called of God is commissioned to
[1:39:48] stand in that same place he said I'll be
[1:39:51] with you even in you to the end of the
[1:39:54] way each minister is called to stand
[1:39:57] where he did the works that I do shall
[1:40:00] you do also each minister is ordained of
[1:40:02] God to is command to stand in the tracks
[1:40:05] of Jesus Christ and perform the duties
[1:40:08] that Jesus performed Prophet said that's
[1:40:10] quite a command and how it must have
[1:40:12] felt when Joshua standing there that
[1:40:14] morning talking to God he said I will
[1:40:17] not fail thee as I was with Moses so
[1:40:20] will I be with you no man shall stand
[1:40:23] before for you all the days of your life
[1:40:26] I'll destroy and devour I'll make the
[1:40:27] weight clear only be strong and be very
[1:40:31] courageous be not dismayed or worried
[1:40:34] don't be afraid he said I'm with you
[1:40:37] I'll see you through what a commission
[1:40:40] to be given to this man called Joshua he
[1:40:43] said and now there's great types here
[1:40:44] that I could go into but we'll bypass
[1:40:46] some of them and so forth like that he
[1:40:48] said and the uh he said but for instance
[1:40:50] Moses was the church age that brought
[1:40:52] them to sin to their theology but Moses
[1:40:55] wasn't permitted to take the children of
[1:40:56] Israel into the promised land because he
[1:40:58] had failed he said in a church
[1:41:00] organization denomination has failed
[1:41:03] they'll not take the church over he said
[1:41:05] but God will raise up a new system a
[1:41:09] Inter denominal National system by the
[1:41:12] power of God that will take the church
[1:41:15] into the promised land you we can
[1:41:16] understand organizations and
[1:41:18] denominations has messed it up each one
[1:41:21] after their own theology each one after
[1:41:23] their own way of thinking but God will
[1:41:26] take his Holy Spirit and he will raise
[1:41:30] his joshuas like he did and will take
[1:41:32] the church to the promise with no
[1:41:35] denominational strings tied anywhere he
[1:41:39] will take over his church Moses had
[1:41:41] failed as a lawgiver but Joshua was
[1:41:43] called of Grace and he took the church
[1:41:46] on oh do you believe tonight that Joshua
[1:41:49] the holy spirit is going to take you on
