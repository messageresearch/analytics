tonight and they have your Bible so I could attend the to portion of scripture Luke chapter 18 want a refund verse one to eat and Revelation chapter 22 we want to read from verse 10 to 17 Luke chapter 18 wanna read from verse 1 taste and he speak a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint and that and singing there was an a city a judge which he had not God needs a regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me a man Visser II and he would not for a while afterwards he said within himself do I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow trouble at me I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what unjust judge see it and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with him I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless 1 when the son of man commits she shall he find faith on the earth and from revelations up to 22 verse 10 he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is holy let him be holy still I me who like come quickly my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed the data do His commandments that they may have right to the Tree of Life and may enter in through the gates of the city for with out are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever love it and make it a light I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I'm the root and the offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star and the spirit and the bride say come at him the heareth say come let him that the test come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely may God bless his word you may be seated or praise the Lord amen you got a beer tonight it's good to be here tonight always good and always a blessing and a privilege to come into the house of God oh my as time on for you would see how God has been gracious to us to give us his opportunity all these years to come into his house to hear his word amen so I'm a titled tonight seal not the sayings of the prophecy that's the title seal not the sayings of the prophecy for a message feet but a Brannon 1953 he was saying listen God bless you I want to tell you one thing I know I'm holding long but I just want this wonderful thing I want you to remember there is something fixing to happen now remember I told you that there was a step up coming in the church now these things that you're now seeing are going to be just little things after a while something is moving so he was prophesying of this to pull of the power he was prophesying and I say this listen by the power of the volition of Jesus Christ whom I he said everyone in our doctrine in our baptism we have come to a place but there is some key that will unlock something here so he knew he has the word doctrine teaching presence signs and wonders but is a key to unlock something here no he saw the book sealed on seven seals and when Daniel saw the scene and when the Tundra's utter the voices he said on right that what was that in the scripture but it'll reveal in the last days we are at the time we are chemists right now so he was seeing that these thunders is connected but crossing over to the other side and we know later on he says open up the seals in the back of the book that we could cross over so he knew that the seven thunders was connected to the key to unlock the power so that's why the Prophet says is this the mystery of the thunders that will bring back a power back to the church and you see now the great need for power in the church not torque power not teachings power not big big evangelists we're talking about power the power of God back in the church because this is what is promised do you believe that do you believe that all glory to God we had Kay wish right now yeah few nights I went across the burn of libbets over the Paducah Kentucky crossed into Evansville but a boss what wasn't me I said it's just kept burning on my heart a message and I know that something God has promised on the opening up of the power and yet I'm waiting no for him so this is real the power have to open up something after turn the key to open up this power then he talked about a vision here he said I walk around cleared my throat and he looked at me this is beau Jesus raise up his hands I feinted didn't come till next morning I have an idea what he looks like I've been feeling for the last months I'll see him again pretty soon that he revealed something that's fixing to come forward oh brother if I have it right God forgive me if I'm wrong but seen it in the scripture seeing that he arose I send it up he received a new name that no man know then I see him coming in his power so everything is tied together it shall be revealed understand this new name new walk new life something of the turn so I want to challenge you tonight that you on the prophecy or glory that God great things are still fixing to happen or going don't be weary or glory to God beyond the expectation that woman having an expectation that one that became before the unjust judge she had an expectation of hearing her case or glory that God she had that expectation and the judge was unjust here fear God he a fear man but wouldn't it coming she keep coming because she wanted to get her expectation fulfill Oh glory to God and God put that parable to set it up to show you the quality of perseverance but you have to have in believe in the prophecy that has to be fulfilled William Brennan is not here he is written on us to call him up or glory that God he can do nothing at this point in time but God is risen in you and I believe that God is waiting on you and I to come into position to come into a place Oh hallelujah so he said now watch me on the verge brother somebody come back from Kenan the grapes are good it is our land it is our land God give it to us listen we can take it all glory to God I want a a bigger even than that this is our land God give it to us God give it to us we can take

coming let me see it again it coming what you're doing I'm puffy sign or glory it's coming we're gonna print the seas offer every prophecy that the prophet prophesied for this bride hallelujah it cannot be sealed any more judgment is also coming here less filthy filthy still righteous still holy still everything gonna be fixed or chlorine a God made God fix you by the word tonight Oh

Oh give the Lord some praise as people go glory who have this and who have that and who are the other let them have what they want to have and think what I have I am thinking nothing I say what Peter hand we have to have what the early church had we have to have I don't want nothing less than that I don't want nice sermons nice explanations nice mysteries unfolding that's fine the word has already been opened but if that mystery can be respected that power was the use of the mystery or glory to God it has to be a key to turn to unlock this power this power to be a rock god put the power behind the door and crisis the door and he put the key of faith or glory to God the turn hallelujah to unlock the door of the power is that right he put the word right there and put power behind the word or glory of God in him hallelujah and I believe with all my heart I believe me in the age of the battle we believe that the leader usually that the age of what the battle not the sitting down and holding on and you're hanging in there no that little woman she had a battle on her hand because that judges a mean judge and she wasn't letting that judge her off key she had a passion in her heart she want an answer she want results and Jesus said here what do young just judge said no I mean hallelujah I will avenge her shall not go revenge the Saints who cried di night under him nevertheless the question when the son of man cometh not when he appear when the Son of man cometh not when reveal himself when the Son of man cometh shall we find the faith on the earth Luke 17 the fit was revealed I'm going to look something today this is Luke 18 Oh and Jesus question and if this fate goes still be here that's a tell you must cross darkness cover near it that's almost demon powers people trying to throw people off the word he's challenging and shall I find faith on the earth but I'm coming back he's gonna find fit you're gonna fit and chilling that for sure or Gloria the girl you have to answer that question if you have faith enough people that believe God regardless my god like job is your tire from God the devil can move you because you're staying with the word did you get what I say you're seeing with the word you can hear from gonna definitely move you you have a platform of the word that you could stand on or glory to God looter did not know manifestation or literal was a revelation that just shall live by faith and he withstood the whole Catholic Church with a revelation from God of justification and that one had no power in it to withstand the holo-room or give the Lord a show and if that one man could sternum batter with room the pagan Roman Empire that have been converted to the Empire which can that we could withstand anything anything in this last day when seven Caesars open and the book has open and Adam has been restored Oh glory to God hallelujah God already give us a kiss I even wanna give us a taste of what man men restored Oh glory to God that man

expect it so you're gonna have an expectation if we don't preach it I'm not here to tell Anansie stories I'm gonna dream last night this is the what is promised and Peter said by these promises you become partakers of of this divine nature so if you get the promises and the promises come under the prophecy and these promises were sealed so the breaking of the Seas was still loose the prophecies over your life not what you feel but the prophecies Oh hallelujah what if Joseph did another prophecy over his life what if what he didn't have the vision over his life my time here is easy day he frustrated and he pressed he pack up shop he done he he done but because of the prophecy hanging over him he knows God is with him he knows every vision has to come to pass doesn't matter if imprison itself to come to pass it doesn't look like every he's the right place at the right time but God will make all things work together for your good he will make the good things for good and the bad things the world for the do the things that don't understandable look to the things have questions about he will make it will go to my drug addiction I'm not tell you like you don't want to fully see a man or matter but it still doesn't change it you're gonna make all things work together for good when Joseph get that cotton awoke that was for his good when what if I white make us move from here on him that was for his good because prison was for his good got to break him prison break him Oh glory to God Prison remake him or piss and humble him or glory to God prison put him on that cross where his words were not only effective but the prophecy was still over him and I don't care what prison you in right now my me a prisoner sickness a prison is the prisoner that but the prophecy still hanging over you and don't you let go hallelujah hold on to that prophecy glory the core knowledge never bind that prophecy away from you in this prophecy of your healing and if I go to Revelation 10 year 11 and we take the book we prophesy of your healing of your deliverance of your bridge of your baptism of your adoption of your perfection we prophesy by the word there's gonna be a revival a referral the just and great power coming to the church I'm expecting it tonight not Sunday tonight not Friday tonight I'm a writer expected tonight know if it is all glory to God who say we are never

of the complete deliverance your Jubilee don't belong to us he can take if we can possess it glory to God hallelujah hallelujah and this way I can look to know church a lot group they don't have it whatever looking for the prophet reveal what we supposed to have which man is supposed to look true maybe sees it which church a church what they have I know but a PITA I know Peter denied Christ yeah well he wasn't there when God said on Peters hat and split up a reserved seat on his own and maybe oh god no into and God was filled in him the same man that deny Christ the same man that kissed the same and not run away that night God was veiled and that man you can't challenge God on that so don't anybody hold you to your pass didn't know when you met the person they don't know and God interrupted your life they don't know when the bird was speaking on your behalf they don't go together they don't know about that and where you could go to dinner can't even go didn't ever could imagine about faith no one those Bibles that I have not seen have not heard what God has prepared for them that love him see if Anna's jealous of you tonight because we know you're on your way to the

God hallelujah hallelujah all in the den brothers and you need dissonant but applause have no Bible that Old Testament Scriptures they were the Bible they became the scriptures itself here with the Living Word or give the Lord a shout and we are coming right back to that where the fires God would fail in the sons of God to make them the final voice to the final age there will be the living word of people hallelujah under the messenger glory to God under the messenger will do one messenger they become the final voice of the final age the manifest revelation 22:17 who glory to God the spirit

know normal explanation and mechanics mechanics mechanics no it will be dynamics it'll be word moving in power or glory to God hallelujah ballerina God amen let me see said listen to this God take but about don't you first per second put two people to bring him to the world we know now the angels came to God I discuss that word they tie it back in the word to bring down the Holy Ghost the object was always to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost but God commendeth power when the wood was lost to the ages because the fullness of the would have to have restored to get the fullness of the power back in the church so because the word was lost gonna have to first carry the word because a word and spirit this one so the world was divided in his seven pass through seven ages it took seven messengers to restore back the mysteries that came not from God as the word back into the church and Balarama came with the glue two stitches all together and put it in the pyramid I said as a Bible that has to be in you Oh glory to God I understand I'm saying now this captive world that we'll all to the ages you have to pull it together tied back on the word put this in a vision and being us prophecy the same record bring the ages he pretty individual and this being when it's completed is the servant of God in the church of god that totally rapture not because a man magnet pulpit evil rapture know that being has to be completed or give the Lord I shall that be enough to be completed not some sermon preached we are all servants you are subhan sitting on your worship and as a savant I have to call the freezer after preached and the seven we all serve on the devil and all is the servant will get the lot some praises or glory to God hallelujah all them put all them bishops and all them Kings and pretend to their servants God using them so completions will walk glory to God hallelujah hallelujah my my my so when Gord tell them to send ten spies that chuck de la note don't discover it wasn't harvest time it was in great pain he said a perfect type of pentecost firstfruits pentecost was in gathering the first fruit and when there was a finish Barnea at the judgment it was to be determined whether we'll go on and get the holy sprit or not in the land of promise where was the promise is that promised peace I say repent every one of you so he tied with Pentecost he talked about the upper room he tie it with the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the promise that's the reason they got this big bunch of grapes and brought it back as evidence where I was careless vania judgment see what's over there promised man grapes God make sure they go in harvest time go to let them go when hell no grief sorry tree he had to make sure to have this time that Emperor's could bring some prettiest and look oh my god is great I walk what is good here is the evidence so then that comes with some young great sapling tree some small she say since um here is trees to plant and we were silly can a solid have and if it would be a groups God make sure it's harvest time Jews had to run on the more clothes Dino for them ten valences them fellows then fellows a hollow juice the fellas grab some grips and run out Caleb and Emma juice tripping non-typical and fellows never meet grip so big them fellows to stone them fellows lose weight with the juice from the grapes hallelujah them them taking the time to come back because I love hurry this is my I can walk here I could walk dear I look around citing to get out no this is my land or glory that God gives me this

understanding give your knowledge give you wisdom we are some things that's a night will blow your mind hallelujah or glory to God oh yeah that's the reason they got this big bunch of grapes brought it back for evidence I can see Caleb and Joshua went on their shoulders matching true they're just singing the Jubilee song they had evidence they could prove it was a good man they brought back and give all a journal grip if they wanted one of the coaster a bunch of grapes no Joshua and Caleb when they heard the murmur of the people call them fellas historic sofas now them able to talk the spirit of negatives and on darkness and doubts over the people there are leaders very so-called 500 fools who ever fool inside but they are the elders when they breed their prophecy over the people it was weak at a kit that's anointed upon the people the people didn't go in on these men were supposed to represent the people bring back evidence to the people the people in know what I mean like

seals but that is what belong to us Adam had the book and it was sued I don't watch the prophesied to pull you out and I'm filled the book rent in the hands an original owner so when the book come down prophecy had to come back or to call you because God bringing it back to original so when Jesus came he said you had to be born of the word and the spirit to bring it back to Adam again where we fell from Jesus come to correct that and bring it back to word and spirit mechanics and dynamics so they remember around bought the book he brought all the names was in him so when he spoke about his Lord all the names I know he gonna have a faithful minister to call the last set of names book going to be in son calling names how the spirit and the bride say come go glory to God the voice of God will be in her isn't that the prophecy the voice of God will be in the pride or glory she will speak for God Oh hallelujah the Spirit will give her a voice or glory of God because the Lobos have to be a living voice but speak the Living Word Oh glory to God not a living word therefore the bride of the beginning spirit for it to become living world why period spit these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them that heard the word because he was speaking living word Norville's word Oh glory to God he was in the body life was flowing to the body and the prophet prophesied will happen again or give the Lord a shout full C term being loosed from the body by spoken word original seed coming alive Oh hallelujah hallelujah or blow it over a member a family hmmm amen watch this watch this yeah the disciples under-promise receive it Holy Ghost that is when the upper one wait and then if I FL but notice what happened after if I I fell upon them dr.

into the family and Oh glory to God hallelujah we on the verge of it friends oh my hallelujah hallelujah why Joshua and Caleb could be like that what a rank of the answer right here what was it they were positionally born in Christ positionally they had a knowledge of the word and the word became manifested so then guys was completely different from the rezidentura guys oh good lord have mercy are you with me oh my praise God as darkness and Jambres withstood Moses so these would resist the truth men of carp Minds reprobate concerning the faith this unfortunately ones watch rapper considering the feet and he interjected here that was wonderfully the scenes of course so manly messaged and do not do nothin do nothing about defeat the newly message they know gosh and a prophet they know does Elijah but they don't know about defeat because T fate is what was once delivered to the things I'm saying so to know what defeat is you have to go back to what the fathers had you can't measure it what the message had for the last forty years that your measurement then the prom lane ya know go back to the father's because was enough profit to turn off fax button back to the faith of the father and when when that happens is fulfilled elias purposes fulfill or has literally turned back to the father's we were earlier for you we have to go back and get that plus show time on plus hallelujah we also go and pick up where the hot bus what God promised us we are going nowhere until we have this without going back for that we have to get that first and then come back the disc or glory of God hallelujah hallelujah it will take more than what they had then to go to know but we have to start there because original that's the Alpha Church that's when the bonfire job done or glory to God and go Sam Alpha and Omega once I also drop them on the Omega or give the Lord a show come on Brian hallelujah see in power strike the Alpha Church with the strength you'll make a church this is our promise same power but talk same power poor Peter Peter Peter cutting regenerate and or anything like that must be I thought Peter I see it was speaking things too difficult understand or nothing like that you expect the site Peterborough low moods all them big words poured over the doctor Paul was a lawyer powers Dysport was that powers how did you get it poker use big words take him because of that he could actually translate the Old Testament and bring it in a New Testament and she loved her stuff I'm Paula figure if we wanted to fight him and thing is if let every man who put him and acknowledge what I write is the commandment say Lord if you ignorant leave him alone in his ignorance and come to explain under he I'm a puzzle of Jesus Christ I ain't no Christ and in flesh and oh Christ my pillar of fire you can come and tell me what you know you walk with Jesus and you will see air when you fish in and here no I'm not in that I'm in a different level altogether and I have the authority become a messenger to the age Paul I tell them that but he's alight because I'm a star and in right hand of God what I seen is dusty at the Lord or God is using me just here to you I'm a messenger three anti-age so keep walking keep walking like that's why you're the bus terminal is the contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints it once had it they lost it and we are fighting for it that's why you asked the question when the son of man cometh shall he find faith books not books and tapes not believers not I believe the prophet and second message songs not that not shall I sign message songs shall I find the faith that was once delivered to the Saints there's only one say like this eight hallelujah be fit Mykel rough it up tonight general the only one fit dies defect or put the bomb on it down what face without words you know nothing all the works is going to stand clapping and singing and preaching and window-eyes going to have that's all we have to boast about devil seller and sleep on that he would need establishes whether did ever say listen them them doing good as long as I'm Steve so because Bram says the devil know that the true church is mark six in feedback to me Chris McNamee the devil no solidly you can fool him you can fool him you know when he seen that true church in action so the process said the second time that those voices will be known by the real true church because those voices those thunders when they after the voices of that group not to take the word and hundred dear it was face and cut the heavens they could do whatever they wanna do words will the expression the faith that's restored back in the church [Applause] hallelujah nobody could tell you much faith I know works works asleep expressed only evidence of faith it's works reprobate concerning the feet you know what reprobate means apostasy he said fate defeat there's only one faith visible around considering the fate no I want to read Luke 18 and he read it parable a man ought to pre enough faint see to your judge descriptive you read he read it and he said Lord said hear what the unjust just see it shall not caught a vent he let which cried the night unto Him I tell you when this he would have in time speedily nevertheless when the Son of man commits shall he find faith on it then Barham says no that's the question here is where I want to get to Revelation 10 we're getting a few in the tease of the message of seven angels the mystery of God ought to be finished yes the question is if you would follow a lioness our will it be finished will I find fate like i4p fulfilling this time restore the feet of the children back to the feet of the fathers do you original the word Oh glory to God reprobates nothing living they are fine cultured men but the reverb is considered defeat Oh hallelujah my god you don't have to explain defeat you no no no no no no no no just explain defeat Jesus inside was trying to cop all the electability devil come on come and burn around dramatize the devil talking back to them and say look Jesus tell you of the cash but not one of you could do it because at that point the anointing upon them can't work Jesus coming out of the mountain and all them colors flashing Brom said the devil's can't wait to leave they just waiting for instructions he German one time he said GSA's not in this mode then no is exit which which part to exit how fast the exit they just waited get out or glory of God what was that a live voice as you turn to the chick the devil you can't Bluff it we cannot Bluff it it has to be real oh come on now oh god this is the showdown you know Oh glory I Jesus have sent mine angel testify of these in the churches I'm the root and offspring of David and the bright and morning star Oh hallelujah praise God praise God could we take a little more cos we could take a little more we know groove here this for tonight question Oh help me Jesus where are the spirits no a question that went into the swine where the spirits that went into the herd of swine that be when Jesus cast them out of the maniac that's a question what about a path to the best of my knowledge now we are starting off on demonology no demon is a great thing now some of ok now those demon powers those spirits was a madman called Legion because his name was legion many dos spirit I was in that dear man that drove him insane and if any one of us here insane person had to deal with them they have many times their strength because they are so possessed of the devil if he was ever wrong person that lost their mind it takes several good men to hold them there are twice or three times their power listen Wes way is going to be the snow now when a person is crippled and the Holy Spirit gets ahold of them if the devil's got that much power to make a man three or four times human strength how much power can God put in a man that's what come upon him to make him walk in the strength of God where he have been lean crippled for years so you're not looking at flesh and blood you're not looking at triple bones for twenty years you're looking at the strength of God the power of God hallelujah that could hit that person with so much power that bones could walk yeah when I said because that person that was done - how much bones on the bed was this bones and that bones went running out under the strength and poor God and that part of the come upon you tonight you might be bones but crooked and you your life at such power or glory to God a super strength coming just out of you tonight not tomorrow tonight glory to God I want you to come that way every service today is my service today is my day this is my time this is my hour hallelujah watch watch that's what make him to walk in his train of God way lickable four years his bones come on street his hands go straight he walks like a young new man because the power of the Holy Spirit is on him way is a not any message power of the Holy Spirit but I'm a pastor and you best be shan tong he's done he's done he's the other he's pc for i guess it'll be laughing a lot of things because he that demon spirit that Luciferian spirit that spirit that that jesus put some volts on but just it is written is written he no power gia was a mystery man to him jesus was the most mysterious man ever encountered because when he said if toby jesus never demonstrated any power toward him as far as he can send that i can't touch that man because I mind so connectivity would that that that he yeah I mean citizen of power from Jesus alone when he was finished with him isn't you know he get dream he kept dreaming took a holiday memory beat some way and take a rest all from different things but Jesus not get dream Jesus don't fully charged he went into the wilderness and was tested and when he come true the charge come back on him with that charge quantum is a temple check the book and say the Spirit is upon me no the devil listen no no Alan sighs mr. he says upon me we are not to meet the total then it's a disdain this scripture is fulfilled thanks when I open up big on sin whoa whoa what you're talking about sir all glory has got it to him out but you got something what happy for him no he could prove what's up on him or give the Lord a shout any man can say the Spirit is upon me but when Jesus said that he was able to prove that because he did the words that northern man my god my Lord God help me tonight I came up here wasn't feeling well but I feeling so charged know I could run to a truth or glory to God hallelujah praise God so when that spirit come upon him he could prove it prove it he had confidence in every prophecy concerning his life so he could say destroy his body and treaties I'll raise it up because David prophesy about him he knew the word of prophecy so he could take it and prophesy based upon what the scripture said that he was the Living Word still walking up according to the scriptures I know the bride will be the living wood and we have the scriptures of Malachi for we have the reveal world we have the Bible that we can identify our name and our purpose and if we and if Jesus could go to the temple and pick up the scripture this builds upon me to the temple and revelation 2:17 God because he has anointed here for a device to seek home the spirit and the bride say come Oh glory to God why because when your temple and identified that we had a children whose hearts are beating literally back to the face of the father's the faith of the father's is living still in spite of fire dungeon and sword is still living tonight it will cut the devil ribbon tonight or chlorine accordion causes the Word of God told on the Mount of God and the bride of Jesus Christ no this whole thing about pity or for will become so real we tell them seven thunders after the voices are we talking talking talking beware or glory recording you will see something because they're gonna have the sword in hand what shot the Kings sword was bad the third poll Florida thought it would be greeting among us or chlorine accord the King saw it gonna be in their hands sword in the mouth word of God Oh hallelujah well my my my my my let's continue he said no deal Wendy's evil until they wrap the man in Chains he could break them he put them asunder and there was nothing good mining he was really a bad case and Jesus cross on that the Ghaderi he was so even not the man the man was alright it's not the man when you see a person like that don't ever think it's the man it's the devil that's in the man then the maniac and the platform that night was going to kill me in Oregon when I 20 count to me him spit into my face calling me snake in the grass before nearly 10,000 people it wasn't a man he's a man that eats and drinks and sleeps but who the family loves and like you and I am but that was the devil in him doing that and you never cast a devil out by the wrong attitude it takes love to do that and love is the most powerful force there is in the world when I say here at when I say yella hallelujah hallelu of is the most powerful force when I say here most powerful force or glory to God hallelujah Amen now if you notice the devil is always heat it is of the devil let's go wrong with a binoculars no and when people hit someone remember it's a terrible devil to despise or dislike you mustn't do that so when your blood can't take this one you need a blood transfusion you need to blood of Jesus so dislike and hit and you can take this one dies issues that you have see any other care about your system you mustn't do that this is about a brown-nose there's a whole lesson this question an answer soon that's a question answer is there's some stuff inside that is why bring it on Jesus and I he said let me continue no no remember Jesus said in a sermon when you pray our Father who art in heaven when he come down he said if you don't from your heart forgive every man his trespasses neither your heavenly Father forgive you your trespasses you mustn't do that now where the devil creates a power of hatred to run out on the platform to kill me which he physically was more than able many times he could have held me up past with two fingers like mine a belt because he weighed 261 somebody pawns six foot and a half seven foot tall great fellow he just hit a pitch along the street with his fists broken collarbone and jaw injured him put him in hospital he hated preachers so he ran out there to kill me no and so on okay we'll continue you know now in that man that was of those spirits was cast on this finan Ghaderi some of those poor people are out there remember remember Devil's birthday Devils always live and there will be a time when Devils will have to die they will become totally undeleted but now they are live and they work from generation to generation upon human beings some of them in the form of cancer some of them involve epilepsy some of them form of tuberculosis they get into the flesh but seemingly they are powerless until they get into a prison or glory of God they have to operate you a person which brings us to another thought and the Holy Spirit covers the earth but is almost helpless until it gets into you and to me God is dependant on you and I the Holy Spirit the earth is full of the Spirit of God it's poured out but it cannot operate until it comes into us we human beings are operated or give the Lord a shout Oh hallelujah solo what but whatever mom says the word was invisible until it became flesh then they will become visible Oh hallelujah so he said it's so powerful he said God is depend upon you and I it is full of the Spirit of God it's poured out kind of operate until it comes into us we human beings operate so all these mysteries all these great revelations well Thompson is to get us out of the way that the Spirit of God would have actually have the preeminence 'as which fulfills the second fall of the great mystery of God the first followers who reveal himself the second part was to have the three eminences and the third part was to restore back Eden or glory look also when God could find a man and he said there is my spirit flowing freely that man is blown out he have no self in there you have no pride India he has no aim and everything scared out there like a flow freely so the devil wants to take us over to operate under him so he gets in a mild form he starts in sin if he can hold them just in a righteous man a good man I let him go ahead and try to be good like that if he can hold him until he is dead that's what he wants to do he's got him because no matter how righteous you are how good you are home all you are how clean you are how honest you are you will never get the helm until you are born again so the devil don't mind holding them holding them holding until they did I know they can't make it nobody path back to a question the spirits the window that man - like a maniac does the same thing in people today is them spirits thousand time Towson's and the devil coming with opium it's like a schoolgirl they just started to do get her to smoke a cigarette that gets us started the next thing is a stronger end up with marijuana and then the real dope habit what does it it drives him insane they go crazy so the devil is in smoking cigarettes that's his little mind form he sees you're pretty smart you're going to catch that he will never let it go further than cigarettes if you see gonna catch it so you know I wanna know I wanna know I just thickened broad we don't know what names they have I know camel I don't know what names there right now so the window for that the west and he'd ever whenever I see right there I have you this is as long as you can hold there long enough he can take your life snuffed out because you know you can't go on until God I said so but you will hear sermon after sermon message after mess this punch after punch and warning after warning you can just keep you wore off keep your mind on something else being a popular person you got to have it something like that I'm gonna be a good fellow I'm gonna turn a new page I'm going to church or in church keep you under that but jesus said verily verily I say unto you except a man be born nor wise enter the king now Oh hallelujah that's why people keep people in church you see church is deformed it's deformed but when you see bride you see in life where you have to push on press you see you're not seeing form you see in life Jesus told them he said sister Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they testify of me and you wouldn't come to me living word that you might have life so he was showing sister could cause he said life wasn't dwelling in the scripture they were reading it was what was present tense hallelujah he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water so he was bringing a present an gospel and see them kind of fancy all the way real India has been fulfilling me I am the way I am the truth I am the life so far as if manna wilderness is under everyone dead he sound the Living bread that come from heaven if I money that means he shall not die or glory to God that's right can all for the one a well you say woman if you know talk to you you would ask me for water Oh glory to God I live in water living word life spirit life the way that I speak their spirit and their life or give the Lord a shock the bride will come back to that the Miller she will come back to that the very world itself will be spirit and life like what Peter had that's the fate of the father's Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah that's what we're fighting for oh my lujah Oh glory to God let me skip down he said the Holy Ghost ought to be more important to you than everything else in the world your prestige your life your job anything that is dear you should not cease until you have it you must receive it it must be the most you see I am afraid at my work are free but my husband don't be afraid let that be first please let everything else go you say well I expect it one of these days but I Branham not one of these days this is the time let it be first before I do anything else let me have it no yes spirit that would help answer a question you get when you are desperate you already have to get it or die that's when you're gonna get it or praise the name of the Lord hallelujah I mention it the wrap up you know Oh My Jesus enjoying the winter nights I don't know about you but I am alright no we know something about the ten vision and better manner which ago was teaching him about the pools and so on like that and he catch a small fish and the angels tell him I truly enough to dress with explaining things just get piece of that you know and he said you cause impersonations then I started weeping I look took the string was trying to treat it out he looked at me and I wondered what he was going to do he said keep your line straight in these kind of times so yes so I cut the line right through again and just as I did at that time he take me up all again and he stood me up in the air over agreed order to him or tent and I mean an altar call and hundreds of people Reeve softly sweetly were weeping setting by the altar receiving the Lord Jesus and I said that looks better and then there was a nice smooth spoken gentleman step that I said no wild but a brand is rested a little bit with line up the fair line you all with prayer cards beginner at a sitting line to my right so I stood looked and I could see to my left from where I was standing there was a little building sitting there a little building built like that and the people here look like they went around the tent and and then I seen a woman in the almond stretcher was lean and a man behind her was standing on the crutches and they were standing there waiting for their turn and there was a lady taking down their names and things and then there was a canvas stretched that no one could get her wrong that tent and I wanted to watch this and listen to how it is now and watch the difference and I heard that always goes every time we have a healing service that's what happened was that's the wait always song did song like like like we in the bush when I did it it always been that way and I felt it I heard it rather moving I looked and there was a soft light moving away from me and went down and went into that little building so the light went into that little building and there was something different between the light and the angel because he was still there with me and the light that went into the building and this angel still speaking behind me which is a big man he said I will meet you India and I said I don't understand why I and there he said watch I'm this woman when she come out of this unbalanced stretcher she was pushing the stretch on the other side and the lady asked her what happened she said I don't know it just happened I've been on the stretcher I've been on his bed for years and here come the man packing his crutches and they asked him what he didn't know he was commented a platform that testified I don't understand it there so they were passed into this room this room and were being healed and then he's I don't understand what's in there and then the Holy Spirit the angel begin to put it back in the wood for him watch he's always scriptural but I'm saying that he said did not our Lord see window prayers be not as the hypocrites that like to make a show he said enter into the secret closet and when you have done so closed the door then pray to your father that season secret and he that season secret shall reward thee openly and he said you remember that name that you hunt him that you dream about he said I'll meet you in there and this time it will be a public show and then the vision left me so that was 1956 but on 1963 the 7cu night he was just talking back some of it I just want to read that back he picked me up he took me up set me high I'm a meter was going on and looked like a tent or car TV or some sort and look and there was a little box like place on the side I seen the light that was talking above me the light that you see and the picture it will away from me like that went to the tent and said I'll meet you in there and this will be the purple and you won't tell it to nobody or glory that God has a place for him to meet you he's going to meet you there don't miss it Oh hallelujah give the Lord a shout hallelujah and in Seban your colonel he said this is the third pole and there are three great things that goes with it one unfolded today and he said the first full of his seven seals worth seven thunders banging one two three four five six zero Oh hallelujah one for today yesterday and the other wonderfully today and there is one thing I can't Tirpitz it's an unknown language but I was standing right there this is the tuple coming up this is the reason that heaven was silent I better stop here I feel check but I see no more see remember the Seventh Seal the reason was not open the reason it did not reveal it nor know about it is that vision come years ago you remember that it's slightly right straight into the word he said notice for the end of time message this seal he reveals succeeds it doesn't nothing about the seventh but the end time seal when it starts it will be a secret according to the Bible and remember Asian ten one two seven at the end of the seven angels message all the mysteries of God will be known we are the end time the opening of the seventh seal oh my I'm almost done one more coat on with a musician Oh glory that God you love him tonight Oh glory that God hallelujah praise God from here he him but a bantam says this now though the father said if the son is behaving himself is his short product that son you know what happened he's taking the schooling if that son a tool to be the RIKEN her son loved the father business teeth right with instructions the father in a certain day took that son out before the public set him in a high place claw him in a beautiful comment and they call the abduction of a son placing a son positionally what he was they had a ceremony then the father said this is my son I adopt him or place in positionally and they had checks in those days that son name on the check was just as good as his father cause he was placed and the son could fire who he wanted to he could hire who he wanted to he was in full possession of all that the father had Oh glory to God amen amen amen now you see Jesus here we go I had proven to God that he has been the right kind of son and God took him up on the top of the mountain brought witnesses oh dear heavenly witnesses and he witnesses and he clawed him at immortality a supernatural something taking place his garments glisten like the Sun in the middle of the day as white as they could be God placed on him that robe of immortality showing that the even here we go are you ready God's the thing that God will do to his sons here on earth someday he will call you a side Church if you'll only obey Him and stick on the wood and believe it he will place into the church before the coming of Jesus he will place he will place into the church all the power that Christ had in him will be in the church all that God was he poured into Jesus all that Jesus was important to the church God wanted his work done he sent it into his son the son wanted work done he said into his church at that day you shall know I am in the father the father in me and I in you you and me at that day because here we go because the same power of God that was in Jehovah of God resident Jesus Christ and the same power that rested in Jesus Christ resting-place sons in the body of Christ the other sons that will be placed we always sons but we got to be placed placed sons will have Jesus Christ's power in them let me finish it the prison of a son take a motor set in place have a ceremony before angels please him positionally what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority that person watch how easy you know let me see this if you copy a finale from this night on that very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done you mean I'm not supposed to expect this we supposed to expect this because the Prophet said that very same thing will be done there will be a power put into the church and no calling in the Holy Spirit with so anoint the people till they will speak the word I will recreate itself right there we haven't seen powers like coming to church now I know it's a fact see under the smoke can we move don't don't in your heart but believe what you have said shall come to pass you can have what you have said the listen of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church
