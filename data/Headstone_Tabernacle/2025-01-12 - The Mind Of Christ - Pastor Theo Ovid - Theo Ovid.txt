morning it's a blessing and a privilege amen so before I get into the message I do have something like to share before we get into the word this morning with Bram in the Rapture he said Remember the same God said that Los Angeles is doomed and she is finished I don't know when I Can't Tell You Jesus said Capernaum you have exalted yourself into heaven you shall be brought into hell for Mighty Works has been done in you had been done in Sodom it stood today and the same spirit of God that said all these things and done all these things it said oh City capernum who call yourself by the name of the angels Los Angeles how you have exalted yourself into heaven the very root and seat of Satan you have exalted yourself preachers it's a graveyard for them good good men go and die like rats what a Havoc you that call yourself by the name of the Angels if the mighty Works have been done in s and been done in you it you stood today but your hour has come you watch and see if it ain't I'm a false prophet she is yes she is she is laying there so we know the prophet prophesied that was Angel is going to go down to the bottom but I want to read a scripture from Jeremiah chapter 21 two verses there verse 13 and 14 God speaks he says behold I'm against thee Oh inhabitant of the valley and rock of the plain seeth the Lord with see who shall come down against us or who shall enter in our habitations but I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings seeth the Lord and I will Kindle a fire in the forest thereof and it shall devour all things round about it second scri I want to read is from second Peter familiar one I'm going to it talk about verse six about the water being overflowed but I want to go for in verse seven of second Peter but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word I kept in Store Reserve unto fire against the day of judgment and of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years as a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concering his promise as some men can slackness but is longsuffering to usw I remember a woman telling Mar you know she living in sin this all kind of stuff she said nothing happen to me and she doesn't understand that is the longsuffering of God and people carrying all s of foolishness and don't understand is the longsuffering of God but here the Bible says God doesn't consider slackness his promise he said watch not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought he to be in all holy conversation that is living and godliness looking for and hasten unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the element shall melt with a fent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new Heaven A New Earth wherein there righteousness therefore uh beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless amen praise God so we know that uh Los Angeles have some serious fire going on right now it says there about $ 59 billion worth of damage and uh a lot of the Hollywood Elites and movie stars and whoever uh $20 million home burn completely down to the ground the satellite pictures of that is is like a war like a what you call like a desolation and you know there's a scripture that talk about God said I will send fire on the wall I will send fire to the Palace I will send fire and that is what God speaks of a individual or Country Pride strength and security and they feel you have money and you feel you have this and everything will be fine God say I will send fire righteous judgments of Nations cities and individuals so fire represent that destruction but I want to read a scripture from Zephaniah it's a book we don't really touch uh I'm going to just jump a bit the word of the Lord Z is one of these small guys don't get them up small prophets the word of the Lord which came into Zephaniah the son of Kushi the son of Jalia the son of amariah the son of Hezekiah hisia in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah I will utterly consume all things from of the land this is the God we serve there's not no Mickey Mouse God this is not no Santa Claus God this is the god what we reading here is the God we serving this morning this is the god of the word I will utterly consume all things from off the land sayth the Lord I will consume man and Beast I will consume the Falls of the heaven the fishes of the sea the stumbling blocks with the wicked I will cut off man from off the land sayth the Lord I will also strch out my hand upon Judah upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem I will cut off the remnant of Beal from his Palace from his place and all the name of CH and the priests me skip a little bit verse eight it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord's sacrifice that I will punish the princes and the King's children and all as are clothed with strange perel in the same day I will punish all I'll skip that nine but here one I want to go down to um verse 14 let's go on to ver 14 the great day of the Lord is near it is near and he said greatly even the voice of the day of the Lord the mighty man shall cry there bitterly that day is a day of rra a day of trouble and distress a day of wastesson a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clothes and thick Darkness a day of trumpet and alarm against the fence cities against the high to I will bring distress upon men they shall walk like Blind Men because they have sinned against the Lord and their blood shall be poured out as dust and their flesh as the dong neither listen neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in that day of the Lord's wrath let me read that line again neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that are in the land and this is what brother brandham said in a message called the angel of the Lord Brother step Al very shared with me he said over in the east coast they always hollering to me why you're going to the east coast everybody pulls out to Los Angeles maybe that's God's place that's right right here is probably where judgment will strike and that's right let's get ready my this will probably the first place it will be hit right here oh Church hold to God's unchanging hand let's put that again brother Shan put it up for me I want over in the east coast they always Hing to me why you're going to the West Coast everybody pulls out to Los Angeles maybe that's God's place that's right right here is probably where judgment will strike that's right let's get ready my this will probably be the first place it'll hit right in here oh Church hold to God's unchanging hand and pray at this time I want to show you a little clip of what is happening across there and we just take a look and we continue from there shame I welcome to three news the struggle to save Los Angeles from the worst wildfires ever visited on the city still seems like a one-sided fight 120 square kilometers an area larger than Hamilton of both scrubland and Prime real estate has been incinerated turning affluent neighborhoods into Landscapes of Ash and charred ruins CBS is reporting that 9,000 structures have been lost the Palisades eaten and Hearst fires are still r while a new Blaze called the Kenneth fire has sprung up in San Fernando Valley and Incredibly only seven people have been confirmed dead thanks to mandatory evacuation orders affecting 180,000 people Senor reporter Juliet Speedy has more the road into Pacific Palisades in the aftermath of the wild fire a shocking journey through destruction and it soon becomes clear this fire is still consuming homes and businesses all along Sunset Boulevard the scenes here show that the mandatory evacuation orders saved hundreds if not thousands of lives and from the year the scale of the tragedy becomes Starker still entire neighborhoods lost to the Flames underresourced firefighters working in strong winds Around the Clock we're we're running out of water this is the worst one for me worst one I've ever SE no question this resident has briefly returned to see the scale of the disaster at less than 24 hours the neighborhood gone leveled disappeared I was in tears with my still choked up with um with my daughter right now it's you know it's a lot of lot of hard work building building a business and seeing this it's tough very tough you better take pictures of the house right now for residents daring to go back just a glimpse what they have lost the emotion is overwhelming one of the most desirable places to live in America now a [Music] hellscape it's like Armageddon when you can see the Flames coming up over the houses and you're just getting out of the driveway and the the smoke and the ash is so thick I'm surprised all of us got out of there a mailbox but no house to serve a child's toy and the abandoned remains of an attempt to load up a car Nature has had the upper hand in the City of Angels the infamous s Anna winds scale Force at times changing direction with a fiery trail of Destruction it's extremely difficult to predict it's extremely difficult to contain that's pretty much like a hurricane except instead of rain we had fire it is safe to say that the Palisades fire is one of the most destructive natural disasters in the history of Los Angeles a new fire gained traction last night this time in the Hollywood Hills the places where you'd come to dream Sunset Hollywood Boulevard Mal Halland Drive named synonymous with the movie industry that is Al's bread and butter it's many of those who've reached the top whose homes have now burned to the ground those who have reached to the top whose houses have burned to the ground and to think this is just the introduction the real disaster Is Yet To Come where it will sink straight down into the sea and brother brandham says that the ocean would go back into desert into the sultant it will go back to the desert way back into the desert it uh this year has been starting very dramatic as you see from the very beginning it hasn't even pass January yet and the drama and the wheels are already turning what is fixing friends is judgment is God R in other words after a while after 120 years with Noah God got fed up he repented he made man and and and and the Bible talk about Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord and then God came down and shut the door then everybody inside the ark knew that was Supernatural uh Noah didn't go and close the door God shut the door and this door to the Gentiles this door to Salvation this door to Deliverance this door to break through one day will be closed so we have to begin to realize that this message is not a gimmick is not a show is not a religion is God s a prophet notice what the Bible talk about the righteous shall walk on the ashes of the wicked behold I send you Elijah the prophet when before that great and Terri of the lord it's just that we have many many years waiting for this hour some of us in the 70s 80s '90s and so on but we will live to see it with our own eyes a lot of things you're going to live to see many of them in Hollywood didn't expect to see what they're seeing and there was a time when they came up in the car to hit the road now there was so much traffic nothing was moving you know what they had to do leave the cars and walk and the cars burn down if they had stay in the perish but I have to leave the fancy car the mercedesbenz and the BMWs and you name it all the fancy you can think about that to leave them and walk so when God begin to move God going to move him remember God is not a man God is no respected of persons when judgment strikes a land drop and strike the whole land not because you in the land Dr strike you when God say everybody going to Bon is everybody to Bon you know whether you Daniel whether sh whether M wheo who you are and how long you are you going into bondage so we are grateful to God tonight so let's sing that song and hold to God

Corinthians chapter 2 reading ver verse 11 okay for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who had known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ and from Phil Philippians chapter 2 and there is a scripture we have read a couple of times if there be any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of spirit if any borrows and of mercies fulfilling my joy that you be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of mind is a mindset Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man on the things of others let this mind being you which was also in Christ Jesus who been in the form of God taught not Rob to equal with God made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross let's bow head father we read your word tonight and I pray that you would come Among Us in a special way and take me out of the way and speak to our hearts and we can leave you change people a people drawn closer to you a people that would surrender repent and lay upon your altar Grant gred father in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen God bless you have a seat praise God Amen so this morning I have a title the mind of Christ and I have a inspiration altering our thinking to his thinking and we'll get to it but but baram says your mind makes your character we get that all right so the mind of Christ having a perspective and understand standing shaped by the Holy Spirit a mindset that affects your thoughts

your life is changed don't take an emotion or sensation don't do that stay there until something actually happen that changes you completely remember I talk about altering your thinking this is where I get it from Moses begin to think on his ways how he went off in his own schooling and training he know there was a call of God on his life but he tried to work it out his own way many of us preachers get into that trouble a call of God in our life and then go off and get a schooling that tells us the days of Miracles pass there's no such thing as the Holy Ghost now they say holy ghost sensation and whatever they want to bring same Baptist style not understanding what the prophet presented them what for days gone by God let you think on your WS that same God wrote the word still lives and holds you responsible to it God is infinite here we go when he speaks it's got to be perfect we cannot alter God's word we have to alter our thinking to his thinking then you will think like he thinks let this mind that was in Christ be in you Hallelujah Give the Lord some Praises there is no need of any man to try to take his worldly knowledge and ever please God with it the scripture we read it says not with man's Wisdom is what the Holy Spirit teaches do you understand that because because these things are spiritually discerned it's an abomination in the sight of God you will never please God with worldly ambition and knowledge because it's enmity to God says the scripture and each one tries to have all the knowledge they just know what to do and the words to say it becomes listen it becomes a political speech instead of the the powerly demonstrated Holy Spirit message that sing to the heart of men and discover the sin they are trained for political talks we don't need that so he's talking about political ministers they just make the gospel into politics now Paul said the way the word come to us gospel not in word only but in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost that brought the gospel demonstrating the powers of the Holy Ghost and all these men go off to seminaries and so on like that right around here the Paul said the gospel that I preach didn't come like that but it come through the renewing of the Holy Ghost and the power of demonstration in other words it doesn't come by right form speech that your wisdom would be or you trust in the wisdom of man praise God each one try to think he's smarter than the other one you hear each denomination we got the smartest men in other words uh we got the he have more Mysteries like a brother told me he said brother to you you know you preaching too light and he's praying for me that I could get down the de of the W he said pray for me brother next brother tell me he's ahead of me I said I'm coming on I'm coming as fast as I can pray for me pray for me I'm coming on see now watch watch all knowledge we know all about it and some of them doesn't know the first alphabet of the Holy Spirit and this I want to get through it reminds me a little book I read one day in California about 10 years ago I pick it up in an old bookstore I forget who the author was a 10 cents book but it had some good sense to it though it was jokingly and cunningly but I found something in there that some like got to me one of little story is startled like this one morning in a great chicken pen there were certain Little Rooster that thought he had all the knowledge that there was to be known so he flies out on the box and beat his little bill against the Box four or five times flew threw back his head throw like a never the r and the others he attracted attention he said ladies and gentlemen of this chicken pen I would like to speak to you all this morning on some great educational program we have designed I have required a lot of knowledge in my studying he pulls his glasses over his bill he said I have decided that we chickens can better ourselves by more knowledge therefore I can tell you where we will dig and work in certain pen and hole You' find certain vitamins that will make us grow better pry of feathers I can tell you how we can embed ourselves in many different ways and little pullets little red Combs they cackled and said isn't he a darling and they admired him oh he's such a brilliant rooster all them sisters and reminds me some of these Seminary preachers such a brilliant man there's no need of us hanging around with the rest of the chickens well before the little fellow got his speech finished there was another little chicken that didn't have much bright feathers Come Running in the rest of the chicken yard he said boys just a minute I just heard the latest bulletin on the radio chicken went up 4 cents upon P we are all going to the slaughter tomorrow what good is your knowledge going to do after that rooster make his big Crow chicken G for he said all of us how find that's a powerful lesson brother all the knowledge that we can accumulate what good does it do we are Sixt of dirt we are all dying by inches and by minutes our knowledge means nothing we want to know him give the Lord some praises and I was reminding something about a little Canary which is a bird he thought he know all the knowledge and he need to know he know all much he could tell the rest of the canary about human beings so he flies on his cage begins to speak about human being how he know all about them all of a sudden a profession Professor from puru walked up and begin to speak some high polish words to him little fellow batted his eyes and turned his head he had eyes he could see the professor he had ear he could hear him but of course he didn't know what he was talking about because he have a canary brain he par talking morning morning talking talking what repeating power brain he hads he could hear him of course he didn't know what he talking about he's got Canary brain he's just a bird brain that's all he got he hasn't got a human brain he can't think like human being get the point Propet bringing here now and neither can a human being think like God you are human and all the worldly knowledge is no more than a canary brain you all you have to do is hurt yourself with it you have got to have the mind of Christ the reason people go and join organization and substitute a handshake instead of the new bird they're trying to bypass the new bird they don't want the new birth they know we teach it in the Bible they want to substitute something for it so you in the message you're in the bride that is not true that is not the word now you know a birt whether is a a hospital or hard Flor ping decate hospital is a mess the new Bo is nothing less than a mess but people are so starchy was that that means tachy when you cross your leg and you cross your arm and you you do it here this morning and you don't want to get it you nothing R flet that's tachy if you go hit your wig fly so your teeth flight so you don't know what flying where and how you don't care you know because when you leave here you leave your change you your high your hair hook up and afterward your hair fall down can I continue people are so starchy we will go over there where they shake hands we'll go over there where they don't ball and cry hey somebody crying and you you get a fight somebody went to a service and somebody bought they heard a preacher it they Hallelujah and everybody in church turn back because that is not in the church now so that's a strange thing the man happened to visit the church and when the preacher say something Hallelujah and everybody every neck turned back you was who is that when you get your break Tre you're not looking to see who stand up I tell sister I said standing up I youever church was looking standing he was standing by himself some had to hit you to get you out of you but you Liv with you so long you don't know you something have to strike you that to Christ the son of the Living God something stuck Peter that woman who come and dve Jesus here foot and and cry and reap and and wipe his foot and what not she take a chance you know because normally you're supposed to have somebody to wash Jesus feet in front but them Rascal leave Jesus come with dirty feet so she Peep and see inside the whole thing oh God everybody feet clean everybody well manicured and you know perfumed and things Jesus had dirty feet so she had was to pass somehow she passed a certain way you know maybe maybe the people were servant had a back door AB maybe she pass to the back door but she make a move and find your said by jesus' feet and them fell think we catch him now we catch him now see who by your foot yeah he don't know who that is and Jesus keep his mouth shut say our word when she finish you have a word for you come in here you wash my feet I come in for no perfume no kiss nothing this one who sends many catch them right there you recognize that she said her sins are forgiven she did an act that brought forgiveness to her and them self-righteous message people not doing Christ as service at all because his self rightous in their own head that woman saw a need that woman did something and Jesus told her her sin which how many are forgiven or you think she must have felt when God was silent all along much time God might be silent with you but he's looking at you give the Lord a shout

the spirit of God give make it make things right make you love your brother make you drop your Arts that's what the Holy Ghost has given for oh give the Lord a shout the spirit of God make you have forgiveness have brotherly kindness oh give the Lord some praises I believe the right mental attitude but towards any Divine promise will bring it to pass if you can look at it the right way so he's talking about a reframing of the mind he's talking about looking at things differently you look at things your way and you see you have failed I do have to tell you that look at yourself look at around what you have produced that is failure don't say Amen now show your hand them how successful you are because God tell Joshua meditate in the word day and night and then you shall have good success what does that mean you don't meditate what success you going have you will have your thing that you might accomplish and you feel good about but not the success God want of you because God want you to be successful how many knows that he said as my father sent me so send than you he want you to be a success failures don't show God failures defeat do show God man defeated there boy that's God I remember my early Christian journey I got um the some virus something I had and it had my body like SS and different things and shingles my shingles and I'm walking so and somebody say oh God look at that Christian Christian walking I feel bad because I walk so pain this you see that talking about they seeing but look a Christian you walking because my testimon is out there and when you put put your testimony out there where you have to put your testimony I do it on my job woman in job trying to push move I said show show them my ring she she said that nothing I push my rings so you know words back off hands off she said that nothing that's the devil talking to you if I do have it right that's a whole M finish I know Lucy when I see him and you had to be able to recognize Lucy because Lucifer a taking no no prisoners you know he come to steal to Rob and Destroy so he's a bandit Highway Bandit fight back we give the Lord some Praises fight back but BR I believe the right me attitude towards in a Divine promise he's talking about a set a mindset a mind change a mind shift asking all these things I remember people fighting in a house you with the couples in the girl house shoes and things going in the bed or his house where he come from shoes going in the cupboard that get married shoes under the bed get married to shoes in the cupboard you see that problem they going on battle over where to put his shoes well best bought them say put the roof compromise all together but I it may sound silly but I had battles with all them I had to deal with all kind of foolish is like want to say call to deal with them it because the husband had given her a chance to wash the car I said what she buy the car he only washing watching it and her grandfather tell her she have jealous Spirit to fight so oh so the husband jealous you that why Wasing okay all right husband mash up Soo much of things but if I as a wife and my my husband washing my car every day for me then you get kisses every day I have no complaint he could drive the car if he want you understand saying that but to show you the foolishness because some grandmar see some some old fee some old story and you hold on to that and you looking for who jealous in you and nobody watching you you have a new dress no recogniz a New Dress until like it have a new looking nice people have the problems you know you fix your hair nobody see your here you swing his here left you're swing his ha right swing back what time with that swing your ha but do expect people to say oh you swing it left this morning last week you swing it right and this week you put it behind forget about that you're not here to for here swings you're here for the gospel to do something real to you you're here to Free Yourself lay down your burden get the weight off of you break off the sin that so easily beset you you here to break out break through bust through oh give the Lord some Praises help us Jesus when you in that private Zone you get no help tell tell tell nobody and you're suffering something remember somebody has some operation to go to his kidney or some operation and they figh and they fight and they fight and they fight when they finally got it it was so easy so simple they said for all these years I suffer I got to do this thing long time but thoughts and fear and nothing and some of you just need a breakout to get that off your shoulder and free yourself from the past put an anchor down and said let this stay right here like the two families having Feud and and and it go on to the next generation and and granddaughter ask the grandmother Grand why we not talking to the other family again she said child it's so long I can remember it's so long I can remember why this church not talking to the other church again such a foolishness God will judge people like that you Jesus demonstrated a practical gospel you know he came and started tell oh come bring me bow let me wash your feet said no you're washing my feet big Big M Champion said Lord the Bas on me Peter want to let go Jesus you know all M Champion he want let go you know when Jesus finished with them he say see what I do you all you call me master I do that as your master do that to one another Paul come back and said Let each esteem the other better than themselves and you playing and you feel you are somebody you are embarrassing to the kingdom with that thought that is a high thought and we supposed to pull on every High thought and bring it into captivity oh give the Lord a shout captivity of the high thoughts when you could have seen your brother better than yourself you are pulling down high thoughts and you are reframing your man like Jesus did who being the form of God taught it not robbery to be equal with God and he became a silver and he humbled himself so when Jesus was ah head of the table Jesus come with you he come with the plate with the food and rested in front of you that's Jesus so all of you who don't like to serve in trouble because Jesus was a servant Hallelujah he said the son of man come to what to serve not to be served so you sitting on your throne waiting to be served take St him because sometime you to join the buffet line all right I didn't come here for that so watch remember that has been the standard in my life I have tried to do this the first thing I want to find out is whether it's the will of God or not then I know it's God's will the next thing is my objective it my motive in doing it then if it is the will of God and my objective is right and my motive is right I have faith it will be done because first is the will of God and my objective is to glorify him my motive is to give him all the glory there's no selfish motives about it if you have a selfish motive it won't work if your objective is to make money for yourself or something it will never succeed when you try to do something outside the will of God it won't work to begin with here we go this what I want to get to now there's a genuine Faith but you must come into the real channel of God to have that genuine Faith are you ready there is human faith and there's the faith of God and you must have Godly Faith to believe and to have Godly Faith you must have the mind of Christ prophecy is I'm hearing him the mind of Christ is to be in the church are you with me this prophecy the mind of Christ is to be in the church and the mind of God was in Christ and how the spirit let Christ so ought his Spirit lead the church now God meets in the circle of men sometimes in great numbers one time he met with 500 Brethren another time he met with 12 number time he went with three sometimes just with one so it doesn't matter how great our numbers or how small our numbers Christ has left us this word that wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in the midst now you can't have the mind of the world and the mind of Christ at the same time one is caral and one is spiritual and the caral mind could never comprehend the spiritual mind so you have to understand when people in the flesh and people all natural they certainly not seeing what they're supposed to see so I will have no argument with the flesh pots and fleshly people and caral people no arguments is either you are willing to bow to this or or you just check out yourself you understand what I'm saying then we not trying to fight up the people know no but now when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of Christ you'll be so far away from your own thinking of your own mind now if you could solve your problem if you could solve your issues you don't need Christ if you could solve your problem and you could minister to your own issues you don't need Christ Christ don't need to die all you need to understand like all this humanists will talk about you know think positive and all kind of story whatnot but what we talking about now is a transformation by God doing something in your heart if you stop smoking that is you stop smoking but when something happen in you that take out desire to smoke that is Supernatural do you understand what I'm saying you could stop drinking that you stop drinking but when something happen in your heart that takes the desire out then you're free glory to God glory to God are you with me now so God want you to be free let's quick go quickly now PR pra be to Jesus brother so you don't use your own thinking you don't use your own mind oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God so brother bam said here now watch so you watch the mind that was in Christ is in you and when the mind of Christ is in you you are the word you are God's living word representative so when the Bible talk about R 2017 the spirit and the bride the spirit comes upon the bride because the bride has come become the word Oh Glory to God do you get that now so now you becomes the word and the spirit comes to you the spirit and the bride could say come the spirit in the bride have a voice it is loost word and Elohim coming on top that lhost word then the bride is Anointed and appointed every devil is under the Run Lucifer is under the Run Oh Glory to God this is not temporary power this is permanent power power like we have never seen before so that Prophet said what what you see manifested temporarily that's what he had to demonstrate little fish you give back your life before the doctors un touches my wife the T will go down before the sun come let the sun come on and shine four days when a storm was coming he actually rolled back the storm and say C son you shine he said that power will be in the bride I give you your sons I give you salvation oh give the Lord some Praises that power will be in the bride question do you believe it [Music] now watch this when I ask you do you believe it amen that it and bride have all this power in your mind that could be it that somebody else and not you know you saying something that you connect with yet you when you begin to see that when he's talking about the bride he's actually talking about you now you may not be in the shape now to be that but you will be you may not be the shape now to manifest that but he is prophesying over you that you will become that but if you let unbelief say the wrong thing you are in trouble because Oh Glory to God Zechariah Zechariah John father the priest um Zechariah Zariah the priest he know the word he know what God said he pred a long time and the priest come and the angel come and tell him you have a son and and he doubted why why should he doubt when he had the books and Taps and he he's the preacher Angel appear say come listen man to you because he doubted he said you dumb till the manifestation come you talking at all hold your peace dumb you off shut him up Mary she had a question how shall these things be not she doubt know she just want know how you be done word and Mary running running to tell Elizabeth not she thinks you have a baby you know she said I have a child coming and his name shall be called Jesus she's anointed she has Revelation she's inspired she know that is her Isaiah 9:6 that is her div virion shall conceive that is her do you see that like you give the Lord a shout or you just a chch m inside of here do you see you you have to begin to see God is talking to you about you for you when you see that way then you see the responsibility you have to pack this baby to pack this Messiah you're not coming here because it's brother ID and brother church and no you're not coming here for that you're coming here because God promised that one day the Messiah will come sub to the temple Oh Glory to God glory to God that is what God promised that we will be worshiping the living Christ him moving in and out that will be the Thunders Hallelujah being made manifest amongst God's people oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah buck up your seat belts Glory at 20 Pages page 11 so we going good Hallelujah but the BR says the mind of Christ that you becomes the word representative of him here on Earth you become the word representative you're not representing Hollywood you're not representing carnality you're representing him on the earth he sees you that way oh my and then you begin to see yourself that way because he's saying this is to be you you are to be that this is to be you you are to be that you are to become the word is self then you begin to see yourself as a representative of God on the earth glory to God hallelujah when you walk the streets is not you it is him that you want to see manifested in you by and through the bride oh let's pump you a little bit on so the Bible is manifested again like in the earliest of Christ cuse are you ready you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was not different just like Christ was and when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit fall all these pastors all these ministers that under zero expectation for the Holy Spirit to fall they think that because they think they have the life they think that because they think they adopted the think that because they think they up there somewhere where the prophecy is the spirit is to fall now when the spirit fell in me Upper Room Apostles came out prophets came out pastors came out Believers came out ushers came out tech people came out everybody was there pastor and congregation don't say Amen now if bishop and our Bishop Mary was there you know both Marys was there Mary Mary and Mary Magdalene oh give the Lord some Praises hey my God are feeling good this morning Hallelujah I feel like I'm now getting started my God I'm energized my battery fully charge it's still saying 100% say where this old man getting his energy from Hallelujah charge this morning Hallelujah press on and ready to go are you ready to go this morning Hallelujah we have a evening service are you ready to go Hallelujah so what's something now Jesus said he chose them before the found of the world and they were predestined seed is that right we talking about fisherman cus but all kind of characters was there to Jesus call who name on the book you think you think he was St Peter and St Matthew and St John all there was no saint yet ain't no saint yet they were just called following Jesus but he know the power will make them saints they ain't that yet you know the mother who came and said Lord I had two sons who follow you boy oh boy God could you make one right right and one left Jesus know his problems the other was very upset with her mother pushing she on she pushing she for position Jesus said you see that position I not in charge of that my father in charge of that have a bit a cup if you could drink that fine bitter cup bitup bitter cup bitter cup bitter trials bitter testings tribulation hard trials you want Power you want position but you don't want the process to get there people look at the finished product but it have finished just so it went through a process to become a finished product and God processes through character training so what's happening they haul themselves up in the upper room dry seeds seeds the word was laying there with life in it all of a sudden there came a song from Heaven and the waters begin to gush down and it Act fill all the house where they were sitting and the seeds begin to grow and it begin to manifest itself all this word in the bride the secret in the bride the word is in the bride where that word going to stay that word fire to hit that word water to hit that word inside of you then you going to see what come out inside of you you come and here not in vain that why your flesh just act up sometimes but that seed going inside your soul that seat going inside your spirit inside of there God want that seed inside inside oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah let's see if we got a home stretch here as long as God got a People God got a church God got the Holy Ghost matching with it that is what God give the Holy Ghost for intellectual will rise always have but God has got a minority somewhere God have a little church that will move right on with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that claim the light oh praise God and your testimony today will bring judgment against the city our testimony of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power of God and a holy life will bring judgment against City Hallelujah talk about power of prayer power of speech power of the Holy life is given for isn't that right it's to make you quit your smoking quit your drinking quit wanting to be a big shot it will take that out of you it will humble you when you do that that is what the Holy Ghost is for it's for Holy life it make you quit gossiping quit playing cards shooting craps and all these other thing around the corner somebody said oh God I can't do that I can't do that I can't do that you sure can't but the holy Spirit come to for that purpose he said to take it out of you all the old habits things that you're doing the old backbiting separating yourself say bless God I'm a Methodist I have nothing to do with the Holy rulers the holy come to take out of you it washes you in the blood it irons you out that is what it comes to do oh glory to God hallelujah so the Holy Ghost come to bring discernment that's what the mind of Christ does the natural Man 1 Corinthians 2:14 we read that receive not the things of the the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned spiritually what spiritually what spiritually discerned so that mind of Christ is to bring on discernment that's discern right and wrong discern hypocrite and all kind of funny business sometime you can't you explain it you just know something not clicking something not clicking is that right Hallelujah the mind of Christ what Jesus had let this mind be in you it brings humility he was made in the lious a men and being found in a fashion as a man he humbl himself so this mind brings on humility not Pride not arrogance but humility praise God the mind of Christ praise God Jesus said John 4:34 he said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work so the mind of Christ is connected to the will of God hallelujah focus on the father's will and this mind also brings God's peace Isaiah 263 said thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is on thee because he trusted in thee so this mind of Christ brings you peace it brings you Assurance Ephesian Philippians 4:7 said and the peace of God which pass it all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Jesus Christ Hallelujah the mind of Christ we talk about transforming your thinking reframing that point of reference in your mind what it does it transform how you think are you thinking anything saying anything because your thoughts coming through your mouth so we know how you're thinking because we hear your mouth did you get that yes we hear your mouth from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks so when we hear your mouth we know what's in your heart because it coming through your mouth so when you're thinking change what come out through your mouth will change when you're thinking change what words what expression comes to your mouth that will change because your thinking has changed watch he said now be not conformed to this world but be transformed by what the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good acceptable and perfect will of God so the renewing of your mind change your thinking amen praise God hallelujah 2 Corinthians 10:5 casting on imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God

I really bounce this up in this way but but says no remember we are invited think of it to become characters like his if we are ready to lay our character down and the molding that we had H minded lovers of pleasure of God he said how can God come into a place like that when they deny the word he watches over his word to vindicate it to make it come to pass we have got to take here we go the entire Full Gospel we must being that we have identify ourselves as the Full Gospel people there's the part I got to let's mold our character we are invited to be molded in His image that we might reflect his presence the life that I live so shall you we are invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his then when we let his character be in US then we become Sons by having the mind of Christ mind and listen to the depth now which is his character your mind makes your character what you think you become as a man think it in his heart so is he so I never saw this like way he bring it let me read it again by having the mind of Christ mind which is his character so he's talking about spirit because spirit is life mind which is character your mind makes your character let the Mind Paul said of Christ the mind that was in Christ be in you let that mind of Christ be in you here we go it molds the character of a Son of God hallelujah this is active the one music come please see all right so we reach 1520 brother Bram Hallelujah the Lord warned brother Brandon be careful what you say he don't know what is coming but the test is coming he has a warning be careful what you say he come to said preaching and two people carrying on they want to make love inside the church he said please would you stop that stop that behave stop that they're

people but that wasn't God that is you in your flesh that is you in your caral mind you see he said he did things wrong he fail and fell and he recognized God forgive him and he could forgive them and that's why he said I forgive you God was looking for that could you imagine that and God give him the exam multiple choice pick one and it will work pick anyone oh my so you have to watch what you say so without the minor Christ you might see the wrong thing and you get the wrong result praise God so this holy ghost that is Promised is to drop down over our imagination our conscience our memory our affection Christ in you the hope of glory praise God praise God so those seven voices of the seven Church ages that was God's mind for every age came now to each messenger God's mind dropped down upon each messenger and released the word for the age so when we have seven voices or seven Thunders what we actually have is the mind mind of Christ that was through the Seven Ages is now coming upon a bride Hallelujah and that seven Thunders becomes the Capstone revelation of Jesus Christ to cap off the Pyramid of Our Lives you say if that be so then the seven Thunders kept the pyramid Hallelujah might beos and we think he long say time shall be no more what happens could that be so no Brethren seriously think if it is the pyramid is capped by the seven tunders remember the pyramid message it is a Capstone what did it do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual after they add all the thing and The Headstone come to cap it off does the Thunders mean that my brethren I'm closing there's not one Mo for cult to beond the eye is that right the next is the intelligence which is Christ himself who control the whole body my and when he said he said every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form and if it received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialize the Bible it brings it to pass as a man think in his heart so is he so just as God said let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thought isn't that right and the thought become material Hallelujah I'm going to skip down what I want to get to praise God so you can say let
