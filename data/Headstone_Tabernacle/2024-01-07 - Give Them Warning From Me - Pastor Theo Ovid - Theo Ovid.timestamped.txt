[51:37] from verse
[51:40] 17 son of
[51:42] man I have made thee a Watchman over the
[51:45] house of
[51:46] Israel therefore hear the word at my
[51:49] mouth and give them warning from
[51:53] me when I see unto the wicked thou shal
[51:57] surely die and thou givest him not
[52:01] warning nor speakest to warn the wicked
[52:04] from his Wicked way to save his life the
[52:08] same Wicked man shall die in his
[52:10] iniquity but his blood will I require at
[52:13] thine
[52:14] hand yet if thou warn the wicked and he
[52:18] turn not from his wickedness nor from
[52:21] his Wicked way he shall die in his
[52:24] iniquity but thou has delivered thy Soul
[52:28] again when a righteous man do turn from
[52:32] his righteousness and commit iniquity
[52:35] and I lay a stumbling block before him
[52:38] he shall die because thou Hast not given
[52:41] him warning he shall die in his sin and
[52:46] his righteousness which he had done
[52:48] shall not be remembered but his blood
[52:51] will I require a thine hand nevertheless
[52:55] if thou warn the righteous man that the
[52:58] righteous man sin not and he do not sin
[53:01] he shall surely live because he is
[53:04] warned also thou was delivered thy Soul
[53:09] St John 1 verse
[53:12] one in the beginning in the beginning

[53:23] 4 reading
[53:25] verse
[53:26] 17 for the time has come that judgment
[53:31] must begin at the house of God and if it
[53:34] first begin at us what shall the end be
[53:38] of them that obey not the gospel of God
[53:42] may we bow our head one more time and
[53:44] pray heavenly father I am in needy of
[53:47] you Lord and I know what you put up on
[53:50] my heart and what you have for your

[54:32] towards one the holiest of holies coming
[54:34] down to the Earth and to redeem a sinner
[54:38] like
[54:38] myself and I'm sure that these ministers
[54:41] that's present now can feel the same way
[54:45] that is what by your grace that we have
[54:47] been made the Ministers of this Covenant
[54:50] that th has given with Adam's Fallen
[54:52] race and we are here this morning
[54:55] father gathered for no other purpose but
[54:58] to study to know rather the will of God
[55:03] and what we must do to make Christ real
[55:07] to the people of this
[55:10] generation knowing
[55:12] surely that in the day of
[55:14] judgment we will be brought face to face
[55:18] with this
[55:20] generation and being
[55:22] ministers we will be judges
[55:25] and the people to which we have spoken
[55:28] to and their attitude towards the word
[55:31] that we bring them will determine their
[55:35] Eternal
[55:37] destination therefore Lord in that day
[55:42] we would be a judge for or against the
[55:47] generation that we preach to praise the
[55:51] name of the Lord he continue on to say
[55:53] father God please through Jesus name let

[1:14:20] man name Bishop Pierce or something like
[1:14:22] that didn't know the guy he was under
[1:14:24] all Roberts young handsome singing and
[1:14:28] big powerful church and whatnot almost
[1:14:30] 20,000 he lost his church a couple of
[1:14:32] years ago because he come and come to
[1:14:34] say that he don't believe in hell he
[1:14:35] don't believe he everybody going to
[1:14:37] heaven you know he can't understand this
[1:14:38] God of love and and and there's no hell
[1:14:41] and whatnot and he said a hell with hell
[1:14:43] you know what I mean and he he died
[1:14:45] recently about three weeks ago or four
[1:14:46] weeks ago die in his bed he died a
[1:14:49] heretic I see like the man who blast
[1:14:51] hell going straight to hell
[1:14:54] and all the years before that he was
[1:14:56] preaching the gospel thousands of people
[1:15:00] and he died a heretic he said you know
[1:15:03] maybe we got it wrong the Bible is not
[1:15:04] the word of God the Bible is is the word
[1:15:06] of man about
[1:15:10] God that is how the devil could twist
[1:15:13] people rap people and get them off the
[1:15:16] word and I recognize all the deception
[1:15:18] in this message is to try to get the
[1:15:19] bride off the word because the word is
[1:15:22] God and they're going to be a Bible
[1:15:24] believing bride I don't care what signs
[1:15:26] what wonders What miracles who you are
[1:15:29] what name you carry what office you hold
[1:15:31] what country come from if it's not the
[1:15:33] word it's not the word Paul said if an
[1:15:35] angel come from heaven and preach any
[1:15:38] other
[1:15:40] gospel Give the Lord a shout in the
[1:15:42] house preach any other gospel let him be

[1:15:52] cursed
[1:15:55] because some pedaling another gospel
[1:15:57] Hallelujah not the original because the
[1:16:00] spoken word is Original Seed that's why
[1:16:02] we have to speak what God Said I have no
[1:16:04] feelings to put into this I have to say
[1:16:06] what the Bible said fight up with who
[1:16:08] said that I didn't say that God said
[1:16:11] that I am to say what he said Oh Glory
[1:16:15] you take it or you leave it you accept
[1:16:18] it or you
[1:16:19] rejected give them warning from
[1:16:22] me oh the Lord I shout in the house

[1:16:57] of compromising with them why don't you
[1:16:59] tell them what God said because God
[1:17:01] can't lie if there one thing we know God
[1:17:03] can't

[1:19:10] change his
[1:19:11] nature his program can never change from
[1:19:15] what he started with because he's
[1:19:17] infinite his program and his ideas are

[1:19:24] nature was here to always warn a man
[1:19:27] before

[1:19:34] mercy God extends to
[1:19:37] humanity hoping that they will come true

[1:21:49] it's say be a farmer be a genuine farmer
[1:21:52] whatever it is God has put you to do you
[1:21:54] got to stewardship to that you got to
[1:21:56] answer for we are stewards over children
[1:21:59] we don't own
[1:22:00] them many parents feel my child and they
[1:22:03] come with the nonsense and the
[1:22:04] foolishness we are stewards one little
[1:22:07] mean little baby little B baby that me
[1:22:09] big men and women in in small
[1:22:12] form as soon as of their age they want
[1:22:15] to make their own decisions and make
[1:22:17] their own choices and so on like that
[1:22:18] and we just have bring guidance and
[1:22:20] Leadership to them and example to them
[1:22:22] that they may follow God's way because
[1:22:25] when they had to sin they were born in
[1:22:26] sin and shape iniquity they they have a
[1:22:29] a tendency to go wrong they come in
[1:22:32] church because the parents coming but
[1:22:33] when the time of choice come they have a
[1:22:35] choice and we have to pray that they
[1:22:36] make the right choice we can force them
[1:22:39] to make to choose everybody come on that
[1:22:42] same basis as Adam and Eve to choose
[1:22:44] isn't that right all right so watch
[1:22:47] whatever it is God put you to do you got
[1:22:49] to Str it for that you got to answer to
[1:22:51] God because it takes all that you do

[1:45:11] them they know more than
[1:45:15] God so
[1:45:16] friends we are facing the judgments of
[1:45:19] God Amen the warning of God I want to
[1:45:23] challenge you to read your Bible every
[1:45:25] day pray every day bring your Bible to
[1:45:29] church meditate on the word day and
[1:45:31] night I think in a certain sense the
[1:45:33] Bible on the on on the phone is almost
[1:45:35] like a negative it's different from the
[1:45:37] physical Bible and it doesn't have the
[1:45:39] continuity that you're spinning the
[1:45:40] pages and what I I don't find it the
[1:45:42] flow there somehow it's not it's just
[1:45:45] not cutting it it's good to have it
[1:45:46] there to take a read taxi or Maxi or cow
[1:45:50] or something like that that but it's
[1:45:51] nothing like the pages of the Bible
[1:45:53] Ezekiel
[1:45:54] 14 and I want to read that

[1:48:42] man these men have set up their Idols in
[1:48:46] their
[1:48:47] heart and put the stumbling block of the
[1:48:49] iniquity before their face should I be
[1:48:52] inquired of all by them in other words

[1:48:59] God and you have your idol inside of
[1:49:02] there he don't want a physical Idol he
[1:49:05] don't want Idol inside your
[1:49:07] heart therefore verse four speak unto
[1:49:12] them and say unto them thus sayth the
[1:49:14] Lord God every man of the house of
[1:49:17] Israel that set it up his in his heart
[1:49:21] and putteth the stumbling block of his
[1:49:23] iniquity before his face and cometh to
[1:49:25] the
[1:49:26] prophet I the Lord will answer him that
[1:49:31] cometh according to the multitude of his
[1:49:34] idols that I may take the house of
[1:49:36] Israel in their own heart because they

[1:50:37] idols and turn away from your faces from
[1:50:40] all Abominations for everyone of the
[1:50:44] House of Israel or a stranger that sit
[1:50:46] in Israel which separate himself from me
[1:50:48] and set up his idols in his heart and
[1:50:50] put his tumbling block of his iniquity
[1:50:51] before his face and cometh to a prophet
[1:50:53] inquire of him concering me I the Lord
[1:50:55] will answer him by myself and I will set
[1:50:57] my face against that man and will make a
[1:51:00] sign and a proverb I will cut him off
[1:51:03] from the midst of my people and he shall
[1:51:04] know that I am the Lord and if the
[1:51:06] prophet be deceived when he had spoken a
[1:51:08] thing I the Lord have deceived that
[1:51:09] Prophet I will stretch out my hand upon
[1:51:11] him and will destroy him from the midst
[1:51:13] of My People Israel and they shall bear
[1:51:15] the punishment of their iniquity the
[1:51:17] punishment of the Prophet shall be even
[1:51:18] as the punishment of him that seeketh
[1:51:19] unto him and the house of Israel may go
[1:51:22] more no more astray from me the object
[1:51:24] is this that the house of Israel May no
[1:51:26] more go astray from me neither be
[1:51:28] polluted anymore with all the

[1:51:40] the
[1:51:43] object Hallelujah huj Give the Lord some
[1:51:48] praises
[1:51:51] wow Revelation chapter 13 familiar
[1:51:54] scripture I stood in the S of the sea
[1:51:56] and saw beast and this is
[1:51:58] America this is
[1:52:00] America I saw a beast R out of the sea
[1:52:02] even seven heads and 10 horns upon his
[1:52:05] horns 10 crowns upon his heads the name
[1:52:07] of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw
[1:52:09] was that like unto a leopard his feet
[1:52:11] feet of a beer his mou mou of a land
[1:52:14] dragon give him his power and his seat
[1:52:15] and his great Authority I saw one of his
[1:52:18] heads he was wounded to death his deadly
[1:52:20] womb was healed and all the word wanded
[1:52:22] after the Beast he the part and they
[1:52:24] worshiped the dragon which give power
[1:52:27] unto the Beast and they worshiped the
[1:52:29] Beast saying who's like unto the Beast
[1:52:30] who's able to wake more with him and
[1:52:32] there was given unto him a mouth
[1:52:34] speaking great things and blasphemies
[1:52:35] and powers given to him to continue 40
[1:52:38] and two months he open his mouth in
[1:52:41] blasphemy against God to blashe his name
[1:52:44] his Tabernacle and them that dwell in
[1:52:46] heaven it was given unto him to make war
[1:52:49] with the the Saints here we go and to
[1:52:52] overcome them and power was given him
[1:52:56] over all kindreds and tongues and
[1:53:00] Nations so this beast power will have
[1:53:03] tremendous power but the BAM call it
[1:53:06] political physical and spiritual demonic
[1:53:10] power a three-fold cord but the branam
[1:53:14] also said the United Nations has have
[1:53:17] the laws they're only waiting for
[1:53:18] Dynamics to enforce them they're looking
[1:53:21] for the season and time to enforce the
[1:53:23] laws that they already have
[1:53:27] covid-19 manufactured or cocked up by
[1:53:30] China however that come out from from my
[1:53:32] China side already taught the world how
[1:53:35] to get back in order and get back and
[1:53:36] step how to stay home and shut up how to
[1:53:39] keep quiet no traveling and whatnot they
[1:53:40] already set the template for that
[1:53:43] whether there's a gyon I don't know I am
[1:53:45] not in conspiracy theories all I know

[1:56:47] BR let me tell you not skinning woman
[1:56:50] I'm wanting man to understand this too
[1:56:53] this nation is a woman's Nation I can
[1:56:55] show by the scriptures and prove to you
[1:56:57] what appears in our money a woman and
[1:56:59] there she is in Revelation number 13 she
[1:57:02] started with 13 stars 13 stripes 13
[1:57:04] colonies 13 everything 13 she appears in
[1:57:05] the 13th chapter of Revelation in
[1:57:08] 1933 when the Lord when he was having
[1:57:11] meetings over here where the Church of
[1:57:13] Christ is standing now the old Masonic
[1:57:15] Home the vision of the Lord came to me
[1:57:17] up here predicted that Germany would
[1:57:20] rise up and remember and only 4i and
[1:57:23] whatnot Roosevelt and them things and
[1:57:25] then we come and make a for perfectly
[1:57:28] just exactly and come to pass that the
[1:57:31] cars will be getting more and more like
[1:57:32] an egg and in last days they'll be
[1:57:34] shaped like an egg now I said it will
[1:57:37] come to pass that those cars will not
[1:57:39] run by a steering wheel it will be
[1:57:42] something other run it's them cars right
[1:57:45] you okay now I remember in that day here
[1:57:49] we go before the end time comes before
[1:57:54] the end time comes that a woman and you
[1:57:58] keep this wrote down there will be a
[1:58:00] great powerful woman raised up either be
[1:58:04] president or
[1:58:06] dictator or some great powerful woman in
[1:58:10] this United States and she will sink
[1:58:13] under the influence of woman now
[1:58:16] remember that is th sayeth the Lord let
[1:58:19] continue now he said now he said I
[1:58:23] preach remember about the overthrow of
[1:58:26] the American
[1:58:27] government so he's prophesying that the
[1:58:31] government of America will be overthrown
[1:58:33] and how I said he raised up in Paris
[1:58:37] Satan Satan after we saved them over
[1:58:40] from the woman whne and big time and he
[1:58:43] L it down in Hollywood so he said the
[1:58:45] worst place was Paris with woman and
[1:58:48] whatnot and then the the devil take his
[1:58:50] business and move it over to Hollywood
[1:58:53] because Hollywood had the power to
[1:58:54] spread it more Paris was just Paris and
[1:58:57] Hollywood now have all the TV and the
[1:58:59] movies and what he went on further to
[1:59:01] say that the Devils will be coming
[1:59:03] through television influences coming
[1:59:06] through the television witchcraft Harry
[1:59:09] Potter big wings and all kind of stuff
[1:59:11] they're going to have and people just
[1:59:12] saying glum they taking H Vision right
[1:59:16] down so the Devil is a business
[1:59:20] man he looking to spread his business
[1:59:24] and he looking to spread it that they
[1:59:25] become more effective so you understand
[1:59:28] it's so not going to more tele uh like
[1:59:30] going to the movies that doesn't exist
[1:59:32] movie The no right through the
[1:59:34] television hit it Hollywood now now you
[1:59:36] find all them Hollywood people most of
[1:59:37] them into witchcraft most of them into
[1:59:40] gay and all kind of filthy and perverses
[1:59:42] living that coming out more and more
[1:59:43] more will come out more of them is very
[1:59:45] very filthy more of them in prison right
[1:59:47] now praise God with underage children
[1:59:49] being with on and all of that is there
[1:59:51] right now that's Hollywood like these
[1:59:54] stars that looking like so strong and
[1:59:56] healthy and powerful and they're weak
[1:59:59] glory to God they're weak weak men Oh
[2:00:02] Glory to God and they are stars and they
[2:00:04] are way call it stars and whatnot and
[2:00:07] and the Emmy and the grammies and
[2:00:08] whatnot and they are Boo in the sight of
[2:00:10] God oh glory to God hallelujah praise
[2:00:14] God praise God you said watch something
[2:00:16] in 1933 this is a woman Nation is number
[2:00:19] 13 it appears 13 chapter and so forth
[2:00:22] right he said thus sayth the Lord
[2:00:25] remember thus sayeth the Lord there will
[2:00:28] be a woman
[2:00:30] rule before the end time she'll either
[2:00:34] be president or vice president or it
[2:00:37] will be the Catholic Church as a woman
[2:00:39] I've seen her a great woman and a nation
[2:00:42] bow to her thus says the
[2:00:45] Lord and I'll just okay here it is now
[2:00:48] so so so so right now in know the time I
[2:00:52] always keep wondering where did he get
[2:00:55] this old man from this Walking Dead Man
[2:00:57] Joe Biden of all the people in America
[2:01:00] this Ancient Man of all the people they
[2:01:01] could find is this man and he come in
[2:01:04] response to to to Donald Trump and I
[2:01:06] guess Donald Trump was he can't even
[2:01:07] understand how a man walking dead could
[2:01:09] beat him so that just think by itself
[2:01:12] but let's say this way walking dead did
[2:01:14] beat him I beat him comprehensively too
[2:01:17] but then I
[2:01:19] always believe that whether it's
[2:01:21] Republican Or democrats one making a way
[2:01:24] for the other because it's Satan at work
[2:01:27] Satan have an agenda the men might be
[2:01:30] nice don't think you know when they sit
[2:01:31] on that Throne the devil come and and
[2:01:33] and keep fing up the agenda so when
[2:01:36] Obama came he pick up the agenda of the
[2:01:39] alphabet community and legislated and so
[2:01:41] like that so now they had the freedom or
[2:01:43] whatnot and then of course General Trump
[2:01:45] he come on top of that I know what he
[2:01:47] last Trump think that people want to
[2:01:48] make him to be but he bring a different
[2:01:50] tone in America and now it coming back
[2:01:53] to election time now I don't see him
[2:01:56] getting a reward this Trump guy I see he
[2:01:58] couldn't judg the latest thing he did is
[2:02:01] to make a ad and this come out this week
[2:02:04] God made
[2:02:06] Trump now when that come out and say
[2:02:08] that the final St for me that shows that
[2:02:11] that man is right to be judged when you
[2:02:13] start to play with God like that God
[2:02:15] made Trump and when God 1946 when God
[2:02:18] made Trump God made Trump to rule
[2:02:20] America so he he what he's doing there
[2:02:23] he expressing his way to Christians and
[2:02:24] say hey I'm a little Messiah you see
[2:02:27] that man that's man putting him no he
[2:02:30] know what he's doing he Ain no fool he's
[2:02:33] an idol to most of them and God do judge
[2:02:37] idolatry God will judge that man oh give
[2:02:40] the Lord some
[2:02:41] Praises Hallelujah so I was wondering if
[2:02:45] this old guy this Biden what is he about
[2:02:48] and then it come to me struck me
[2:02:49] something that kamla Harris that one VP
[2:02:53] that is almost
[2:02:54] invisible about she is one breath
[2:02:59] away you hear me she is one breath away
[2:03:04] from becoming
[2:03:07] president think on
[2:03:11] it those are the election coming that
[2:03:14] coming but I'm talking about what is on
[2:03:17] in front of us right now she is one
[2:03:19] breath
[2:03:20] away or one poison
[2:03:27] away but I'm telling you she's that

[2:36:46] oh my
[2:36:48] Hallelujah Revelation 220 almost done we
[2:36:51] 18 going out at
[2:36:54] 19 notwithstanding our a few things
[2:36:56] against thee because th was suffer it or
[2:36:58] tolerate that woman Jezebel which called
[2:37:01] herself a prophetess to teach and to
[2:37:04] seduce my servants to commit fornication
[2:37:07] and to eating sacrifice to Idols now
[2:37:09] with this verse I want you to drop down
[2:37:11] here to verse 23 and see the proof of a
[2:37:13] great truth I have been bringing to you
[2:37:15] attention all along I will kill her
[2:37:18] children with death and all the churches
[2:37:21] shall know that I am he which search the
[2:37:24] Reigns and hearts I have been saying
[2:37:27] right along that there actually two
[2:37:29] churches though the spirit speaks to
[2:37:32] both of them in each age as though they
[2:37:35] were what one here it is plainly stated
[2:37:38] that they are churches and it states
[2:37:41] just as plainly as some of those
[2:37:43] churches most evidently do not know that
[2:37:45] he is the one one who search the Reigns
[2:37:47] and the hearts he is going to prove to
[2:37:50] them that it is so what churches will be
[2:37:53] those that do not know this truth of
[2:37:56] course it is a false Divine group
[2:37:58] because the True Believers certainly
[2:37:59] know that judgment begins at the house
[2:38:01] of God they being God-fearing judge
[2:38:04] themselves that they be not judged
[2:38:07] that's what we say for the communion
[2:38:08] judge yourself that you be not be judged
[2:38:11] now why does God call these churches his
[2:38:13] church his churches even though they are
[2:38:15] false Divine the truth of the matter is
[2:38:18] that they are
[2:38:19] Christians but they are not Christians
[2:38:21] of the spirit they are Christians of the
[2:38:24] flesh they are bearing the name in vain
[2:38:28] Mark 77 how be in vain to they worship
[2:38:31] me teaching for doctrines the
[2:38:32] Commandments of men watch indeed they
[2:38:36] are Christians for what else could they
[2:38:37] be a muhammadan is a muhammadan that is
[2:38:39] his religion no matter how he lives
[2:38:41] because he subscribes to the theory to
[2:38:43] what the Quran teaches in the same a
[2:38:46] Christian is a Christian as long as he
[2:38:47] subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the
[2:38:49] son of God born of a virgin crucified
[2:38:51] died rose again he's a savior of mankind
[2:38:54] in fact in the lisian age there will be
[2:38:56] those who call themselves Christians
[2:38:58] because they subscribe to the Fine
[2:38:59] qualities of Jesus while reserving to
[2:39:02] themselves the right to deny his deity
[2:39:04] Christian Science but he is not a true
[2:39:07] or spiritual believer that kind of
[2:39:10] believer True Believer is one who had
[2:39:11] been baptized into the body of Christ is
[2:39:13] a member of him but nonetheless is in
[2:39:16] God's order that the tears grow up with
[2:39:18] the wheat and they are not to be
[2:39:19] uprooted that is a command of God their
[2:39:22] day for binding and burning is coming
[2:39:24] but not yet my Lord so the spirit is
[2:39:28] speaking to a mixed group musician come
[2:39:30] up please on one hand he is praising and
[2:39:33] on the other hand he is rebuking he has
[2:39:37] told what is right with the True
[2:39:39] Believer now he warns what the false
[2:39:41] Vine must do if it must stands Justified
[2:39:45] before before the Lord give them warning
[2:39:49] from me saints of God what I believe God
[2:39:52] put Upon My Heart by God's help and
