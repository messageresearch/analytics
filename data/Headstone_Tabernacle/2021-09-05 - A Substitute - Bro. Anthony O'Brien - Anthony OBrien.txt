so god bless you thank you so much brother gideon amen so i have a message this morning and um we want to switch over now to that and ask god's blessing amen upon us this morning as we endeavor to preach the word this morning amen and to uh read the scriptures and so uh i have two scripture readings i'd like to read from here now and uh i want to read from genesis chapter 3 and i also want to read from hebrews chapter 9 verses 11 to 15 amen praise god amen it's quite uh quite interesting to uh preach in this way i uh would have been wonderful to praise god have the uh the congregation here this morning but uh god knows all things amen i believe by faith you're connected this morning and that god will speak to your hearts genuinely truly amen all we can do is just yield ourselves to his will and let god take control amen so genesis chapter 3 and verse 7 we want to read that first scripture reading there amen and this is adam uh in the garden of eden and this is after the sin had taken place genesis 3 7 says and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord amongst the trees of the garden and the lord called unto abraham and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself my now turning over to hebrews chapter 9. i want to read from verse 11 to 15. amen and amen hallelujah hebrews chapter 9 and verse 11 says but grace being come and hype uh but christ sorry being common high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands this is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance amen and amen hallelujah we got our blessing to the reading of his word this morning let's just bow our heads and pray one more time and that's the lord's leadership heavenly father lord this morning we've read your word lord and lord as we get ready now to lord to to break these scriptures father and to lord to preach for a while lord we pray holy spirit come on a special way this morning lord i just want to surrender myself now for a few moments lord that you would drop down a special way lord father unfold your revelation lord this morning in such a special way father lord i know that you are in charge you are in control father take control this morning take charge father lord we just hide ourselves behind the old rugged cross this morning we pray god that you're coming lord anoint and inspire breathe life into the word this morning and touch your people lord father anoint these scriptures lord may your minister lord what you would have to minister this morning lord i just heal myself lord we don't just yield ourselves to your presence once more lord that you would use us in our mighty way grounded almighty god now take charge take control have your preeminence this morning in this message in jesus name amen and amen glory to god hallelujah amen do you believe it this morning praise the name of the lord you may have your seats if you were standing you praise god you could just have a seat now amen praise the name of the lord so hope you're feeling fine this morning praise god and let the truth say amen praise the name of the lord amen and amen god is good amen praise all the time amen please god despite your ups and downs praise god he is there he many men hallelujah to lead you through amen i have a thought this morning praise god very uh on to what for me because it is my usual uh route as i should see but god is in charge amen i'm just healing myself now to be a tool for the harvest and i just praise god know that god this is what god wants this morning i feel amen this is uh leaning of the lord so a title this morning a substitute amen that's my title this morning a substitute praise the name of the lord now what does it mean i like to i like definitions praise god so i'm going to give you the meaning of it to kind of clearly define what we're talking about today a substitute means to take the place of or to put in or or to put or to use in the place of another amen isn't that right substitute means to take the place of isn't that right and usually usually we use we take this meaning of substitute usually take it to replace something that was original or something that was originally was there something that is authentic we may replace it with a substitute isn't that right and in some cases or maybe most cases you might find that the substitute is not as good as the original isn't that right but sometimes it's just a placeholder praise god it just takes up a place until the original could come and do the original work that the original thing was meant to do amen amen hallelujah but until that time you're given a substitute to kind of just hold in place of to carry you until that time oh hallelujah isn't that right praise god and as this thought dropped down to me i began to see god unfold it unfold it praise god it was like a it was like a firework okay man just kept exploding exploding and um amen i began to see substitutes and it was just all through the bible praise god and we'll take a run through this morning praise god and see what god will reveal to us amen glory to god but a substitute so usually you use it to mean replacing something that may be original so a class maybe about 30 children or so maybe they've been teaching matthew man but it's team oliver know about that and they have a teacher they started off with this teacher and they're accustomed to the teacher they go used to the teacher but then maybe they end up with a substitute teacher for some reason that teacher couldn't be with them at that time then they'd have to get a substitute to hold in place of until they could come back to the original teacher that was there isn't that right praise god amen and amen hallelujah isn't that right praise god we can also take the meaning of substitute as a requirement when we look at it in spiritual context god requiring a substitute for us for our sins for our faults for all failures isn't that right amen we at one time required a substitute isn't that right glory to god amen amen oh hallelujah so i have a quote here let me just read this here a uh so original context and what we read in the bible here or scripture genesis chapter three amen and this is the context this is how god showed it to me amen it was through this adam and eve story in the garden of eden isn't that right and god we know god gave adam the word amen he said eat of every tree in the garden but of the tree of knowledge and of good and evil do not eat amen he told them don't touch that tree amen that was the word of the lord amen he also put a commandment over him to multiply and replenish isn't that right but the revelation of how that was to be wasn't unfolded yet praise god he just spoke it praise god that's how god does it he's always done it that way praise god he proclaims it praise god and then he comes down and shows what it all is afterwards isn't that right hallelujah and so god gave adam the word isn't that right and when he took woman out of man and we know the soaring adam told the woman what god had said isn't that right so they were all aware they all knew what god required of them isn't that right they all had the word they all had a word for that day amen amen but when man sinned in the garden isn't that right we know the serpent came into the picture subtle how little beast of the field come and there was something the devil could use to deceive that woman isn't that right isn't that right and he told her you shall not surely die praise god but you shall be as gods and different things isn't that right my and he threw in a little word in there he twists the word praise god amen and perverted the original because the devil cannot create he can only pervert the original oh he's a perverter of the original truth oh hallelujah that's what he does that's his power his power is really only to twist what was the original truth or what was the original story oh hallelujah right glory to god amen amen hallelujah the original narrative that god gave to adam praise god that even the serpent didn't even know it isn't that right he had to ask eve what did god say and then she divulged amen what she heard from adam and what got him heard from god isn't that right praise god hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right i went that was spoken then he had something he could twist now hallelujah isn't that right now he had something he could misconstrue amen and misrepresent praise god hallelujah to her praise god and amen the bible said that she saw when i saw that it was desired to make one wise and different things amen isn't that right and she fell into sin watch and the woman and she gave of her husband also the fruit to eat thereof isn't that right and they both fell now watch adam had the word isn't that right but in order to pick up this this uh this this untruth he had to first give up the word praise god in order to receive something else praise god isn't that right he had the word all the time but when that lie was presented to him he had a choice at that time he could either stay with the word or receive this lie but in order for him to receive this lie he had to first give up the truth praise god and he took a substitute instead of the truth oh hallelujah isn't that right they took the devil's line in place of the word that he had originally gave to them do not eat thereof isn't that right praise god hallelujah hallelujah and then let adam let go of the word of god and a substitute took its place harlan isn't that right my see it there human reasoning isn't that right took its place human intellect loss of the eyes lust of the flesh took its place and anytime we give up the word we end up with a substitute instead amen isn't that right uh prophet said here 1953 israel and the church paragraph 22 he said he made a covenant with man and man always breaks his covenant but man has always tried to find some way to save himself trying to make himself uh uh it can't see trying to make himself isn't that right trying to make himself a salvation it comes from a strain in the garden of eden and when man had realized that he had sinned he tried to make himself a religion oh hallelujah are covering amen and we just read in the scripture they sew together fig leaves isn't that right because all the time they were in our garden and praise god when they had done the sin they had not recognized it yet but then when god come down walking in the garden of eden just like he would in the cool of the day as he usually would all of a sudden it was a different thing altogether oh hallelujah they realized that they were naked and they hid themselves from the presence of the lord isn't that right oh my it comes from a strain in the garden of eden a stream of prophecy and when man realized he had sinned he tried to make himself a religion a covering and the word religion means covering and adam and eve sowed fig leaves together and made themselves a religion and since then it's been a strain of man coming down through the age trying to uh to do something to save himself oh mercy isn't that right that's the condition that man has come into trying to save themselves praise god trying to put on a covering oh hallelujah who told you that you were naked hallelujah but when the presence of god comes you'll recognize your own faults you'll recognize your own failures you'll recognize your own shortcomings and you stand naked in the presence of god without that covering isn't that right so if man felt naked then it means he had a covering before isn't that right he had a covering before because when god came into the garden of eden man didn't feel that insecurity no he ran boldly out to meet the lord to tell god about how his day was to have a conversation with the father but here it was that when god come down as his custom in the cool of the day adam was in a different place because god had to ask the question where art thou you're not in your place you're not where i left you where is your covering why are you hiding who told you that you were naked oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my the prophet said here on prodigal 1950 he said look how the little how little the the first sin was but look what it did to the human race when the first sin was committed look at the difference when the message came to heaven is he dramatizing here now god is in heaven and the message came that your son has fallen well it looked like adam ought to have been running around the garden hollering oh father oh father where are you but adam went and hid himself oh my oh you see that there it was just vice versa it was a father calling son son where up you see how man will just try to to to justify him themself he'll try to stand behind something instead of coming right out and saying what he is and confessing his sins before god he'll try to hide behind something oh hallelujah hallelujah glory isn't that right how many times we tried to hide behind something oh isn't that right people hide behind church people hide behind a group people hide behind an interpretation people hide behind their idea of what god is people hide behind their family people hide behind a job people hide behind their home people hide behind their fortresses they build people hide behind education people hide behind stuff oh holly but god is exposing it today oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah don't hide behind something there's nothing you could do to hide not when god comes down oh hallelujah hallelujah amen and there he was the searchings of god walking running up and down through the garden screaming for his lost boy the father hunting oh i love this prophet describing the sitting scenario here here is god looking for adam he's sinned he's gone into a dark place and here is god looking for his lost little boy searching for the sun oh it should have been the sun searching for the father and today it's just the same just as soon as man sins instead of coming out and confessing his sins before god he'll try to get back he'll try to hide behind something he'll try to get a self-made religion oh my hallelujah glory to god hallelujah but look at adam my he said they made aprons of fig leaves and they put that around there the fig leaves but when they came to the place where god called adam and eve to stand before him they realized that they had a man-made religion isn't that right and the word religion means a covering and they were covered by a self-made apron you see it now that strain is in man yet today the prophet said and instead of trying to come god's way of repentance and believing on his son and letting the blood of his son cleanse us from our sins we slip around and try to find some other way isn't that right some way of escape from coming god's way we'll say well this religion or i'll join this church or we'll do this where it's not quite so strict and then make fig leaves and when they had to face god it was no good the prophet said their fig leaves was no good and you come to find out my dear friend that man-made theories will not stand when you're coming down to the last breath of this body and this life oh he said it's good to live by those things but you can't die by them oh my well you've got to have the real original thing in order to stand in that day having done all to stand the bible said stand therefore oh trust yourself oh in the holy armor of god put on the robe of righteousness this morning oh and cast off the works of darkness put on the armor of light oh hallelujah walk in soberness hallelujah walk in understanding walk in the revelation of this day are not in wantonness and not in drunkenness and not in selfishness or however get caught up in the spirit of the coming of the lord get caught up in what god is doing oh hallelujah oh now i feel like preaching oh glory to god hallelujah if god is doing something today oh your desire may be was your desire ought to be god don't leave me out don't leave me behind i want to be a part of your program i want to be a part of your mission i want to be a part of your purpose make me more like you less of the world and more like you more like jesus oh hallelujah not a man made covering oh but to be covered in the robe of his righteousness oh hallelujah of the holy spirit of god's requirement for this day oh the bride is gonna come forth with the blood upon her chest oh hollywood the age requirement upon her chest oh hallelujah you've got to have it on this play you've got to be able to have real forgiveness real holy spirit works real brotherly kindness or to be able to speak the truth in love oh somebody shout amen hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my yes lord hallelujah hallelujah glory to god oh man isn't that right and god covered them with skins isn't that right the prophet said if he covered them with skins then it meant something died isn't that right he covered them with skins he gave them a covering himself it wasn't the perfect covering it wasn't the one they had originally but our sacrifice was not required because because death was now in the picture isn't that right a god had to kill something prophet said he covered them with with skins to cover them to cover the shame of their nakedness hallelujah isn't that right oh glory to god see god provided a substitute now oh hallelujah the fake leaves wasn't good enough so what'd he do he could provide a substitute praise god hallelujah something died and he took those skins and he covered his son and his daughter oh mercy what a picture my god and so when adam and his wife were driven out of the garden of eden we know the story that they bought sons one named cain and another name abel isn't that right one totally different spirit from the other and if works did show and testify of this amen the fruits that they bore isn't that right and god had come a time when god required worship from cain and abel he said come on offer something come and show me what your revelation is he didn't tell him what to do you just tell him come and show me what what what your what your idea of this is what what what you have in your heart come and present something to me that i may approve it that i may receive it that i may accept it isn't that right and here come cain bring in the fruits of the land flowers beautiful things cain took his time oh isn't that right he had wonderful things he had figs and leaves and this and that and all the things he all the beautiful things colors he arrayed it in a special way he wanted to create a certain pattern took his time placed each one set up his altar as it was and they got to prove it no didn't approve it isn't that right because this what god was asking for required a substitute a proper substitute isn't that right hallelujah because what cain didn't realize was that a sacrifice was required isn't that right cain and abel sat down in their father's church for years and heard their father adam talk about the garden of eden and where they were and how beautiful it was talk about how they were driven out talk about the sin talk about the change talk about everything else that took place they know everything that happened but here was god now asking them what is your revelation praise god show it to me show me a worship and cain brought fruits fruits of himself so cain really uh he brought he barely brought himself isn't that right what he could do what he could produce what he could create what he could what he could design he brought he represented himself basically before gone and it was rejected but when abel saw the opportunity to worship before god abel understood by revelation oh hello knows no one told him that praise god because god didn't tell him what to do so it's up to them do whatever you feel led in your heart but there was something in abel's heart when abel understood where they were and where they were now and when abel understood his father's stories his testimony he realized that a sacrifice was required oh hallelujah caught an animal oh honey is that right laid it there praise god took a rock and cut it hallelujah and the blood splashed hallelujah right upon the altar isn't that right oh that he had made and god received that sacrifice oh god accepted this worship hallelujah why because he realized that a substitute was required a life for our life amen is that right hallelujah isn't that right a substitute was required amen adam caught uh able caught it the revelation of it what was required for this day amen since back then it was always required isn't that right something has to die in order for something to live amen and amen that's the way it is and so now watch now why a substitute why a substitute let's ask ourselves this question now why would someone choose a substitute over the original so we could take substitutes in different contexts there's a positive end of it where god uh we're a subject required for us for sin and so forth and god gives our substitute is narang but then sometimes a substitute can substitute the original something i wasn't there before praise god and sometimes people take a negative substitute isn't that right almost amen praise the name of the lord and sometimes it just doesn't do no good like the fig leaves was man's idea of a substitute isn't that right amen but the killing of the animals this was god's requirement for a substitute amen isn't that right this was god's idea of a substitute until the original could come which we know was christ who was the original substitute amen isn't that right praise god he was the original he come from glory hallelujah to take your place holla because you needed a substitute oh but he wasn't no substitute he was the original praise god amen and he took your place amen amen amen and because he took your place praise god you can now stand blameless before god because he took your place you could say amen because he took your place you could say hallelujah because he took your place you could pray with confidence come boldly before the throne of god with the blood of jesus christ splash upon you forgiving you remitting you of every sin oh hallelujah because the original substitute oh glory come and take your place oh hallelujah it took your place glory to god took your place yes your place because you were supposed to die you were supposed to pay that price hallelujah but god come and paid it for you amen men hallelujah holy glory that god is not right amen a little more in the monitors brother timmy man if you could preschool now why a substitute why why would someone choose now a man-made substitute rather over the original the reason i believe is because man loves a shortcut isn't that right they love shortcuts they like the easier way you see it all the time sometimes they have a nice park paved out and they they make an entrance on a little gate and stuff like sometimes i look at those things sometimes you know they might make a nice little area or whatnot and because people find it so hard to walk all the way around there to get to that place i'm trying to get to they cut a hole in the side pass this way because it's easier good fence they cut a hole because they're looking for a shortcut my see they they want shortcuts that's just man's nature the prophet said and you must be born again 1961 he said shortcuts tonight they're out there today they're going on he said oh my and tomorrow they want to preach pentecostal people let them do that too yeah they want a shortcut to heaven hallelujah all i have to do is get down there and just not think of nothing at all and say hallelujah hallelujah i've got on elijah's garment some things like that hallelujah casting out devils different things he's saying i got it hallelujah praise god go on there he said praise god here i go he said they want the shortcut to heaven taken as much of the world as they can take amen they can't take any of it the prophet said there's no shortcuts you come the way of calvary you come the way of the brass altar oh hallelujah isn't that right glory to god hallelujah oh where the others where the sacrifices offered up in your stead the brass altar isn't that right but over here man my inspiration so beautifully laid that out amen is not right you remember for the presentation zone the brass altar and what that means for us the believer isn't that right he said you come the way of the brazen serpent oh hell isn't that right glory to god when moses was out there in the wilderness and they made that praise and serpent oh hallelujah when they cast their eyes upon it they were healed god provided a substitute for them isn't that right he said you actually you die the prophet said you actually die oh god why can't i say it right he said you actually die you literally tied to yourself oh hallelujah you die to the things of the world and you are born anew amen he said no world the things of the world is dead he said there are no shortcuts see they want to come in right quick and they don't want to grow he said but we grow in the lord oh hallelujah they don't want to grow they don't want to grow they want to just come in come as you are don't change just come as you are come as you are just come you're not supposed to stay like that am you got to get cleaned up praise god in order to enter in oh hannah aaron couldn't just show up isn't that right no no no he had to get the right dress he had to get his garments overflowing with the oil he had to get the bells on his apr is that right on his comments swinging just right swinging the right melody singing the right song oh i got to be in the right inspiration praise god almighty had to get the fragrance oh hallelujah over him you have to be smelling right dress right oh hallelujah pray there's an approach to god oh hallelujah hallelujah amen oh my people just want to come any old there'll come a time when you can't do that god will call sin out praise god amen oh hallelujah before you even come in here glory to god will have a holy church a super church one of those spot without a wrinkle washing the blood of the lamb the prophet said that he said i longed to walk into a perfect church walk in there god call sent out praise god if there's anyone confessing he calls it out right there praise god down the altar wherever god moving god in control god in charge of the elders the deacons the ushers for god placed in his fightful ministry isn't that right god in charge we will have that amen before the resurrection god will have a glorious church without spot without wrinkle washed in the blood of the lamb hey many men that brian she'd have to have the same kind of ministry as hot as they had back there in the early church isn't that right in order for christ to receive her again hallelujah praise god all the rest is not even called to it at all praise god hallelujah so you better get right or get out but god's requirement must be met oh hallelujah hallelujah no shortcuts no man-made substitutes praise god got to come god's way amen i hope you see it this morning amen and amen give him praise hallelujah glory amen give my shout out praise hallelujah manny man wow said they want to come right quick okay they don't want to grow they don't want to grow he said we got to grow in the lord it takes growth and experience to come into maturity to learn of god he said my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways my ways are higher than your ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts so how do you get up there you got to start down there you got to stand down there with faith and climb up to virtue and climb up to knowledge and climb up to temperance and to patience into godliness and to broaden the kindness you got to climb all the way up amen hallelujah and it takes god to take you up there oh hallelujah glory to god isn't that right it takes the holy spirit to take you all away up there that's not a man-made covering that's not a man-made teaching that's not a man-made effort oh that's the unction of the holy ghost oh hallelujah after that you are born again or you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you and that power is to grow you is to drive you to calvary out your yonder and then to the rapture there's no rapture without calvary you've got to die to yourself praise god hallelujah hallelujah oh my glory to god hallelujah hey man amen man loves to take the easier easier way out easier route isn't that right he wants it easy isn't that right have you received the holy ghost since you believe first they started off by saying you got it when you believe it the prophet said that baptist doctrine now they're saying i am the holy ghost well i don't even know a good catholic would throw you out because that's not even written in here huh he is the holy spirit he is the tutor and he shows you how to go he shows you how to walk in jesus name the holy spirit is a behavior it's a it's a characteristic it's an anointing it's a it's a teaching you praise god hallelujah it's an anointing that lives inside of you praise the name of the lord hallelujah glory to god teaches you praise god isn't that right how to go how to walk where to walk who to talk to how to talk to them oh hallelujah holiday sweetness and humility oh hallelujah lived voices that's what we need today is thousands and thousands of more live voices that is the thunder that shakes the devil that is a thunder that'll shake this world oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my they don't want to do they don't want to do the work that's involved in getting to this perfection so they take a shortcut you get it now they take a shortcut they take their own substitute their own way of doing it in order to try to get to this but you can't get to this perfection praise god in your own human spirit in your own human strength they're people at natural virtues naturally patient they're naturally kind naturally loving sweet people nice people really great really sweet people but that is not this that is just man me that has its limits but when that comes to its end that is when this takes or to take over isn't that right those rainbows ought to be flashing praise god hallelujah glory to god that you could see the fullness of god veil in our brine that'll be the difference between what's man-made and what's the original original amen oh my god so it's like the ten ten versions isn't that right five or why is five are foolish but overall it always says he said they didn't want to pay the extra cost that's what they separated the foolish from the wise amen that's what separated the foolish from the wise they didn't want to pay the extra course for the extra oil they didn't want to do the extra amen what it took to press a little further praise god a little longer praise god hallelujah amen to get in there but the great contest is on this morning are you going to press your way into what god has required for us are you going to press your way into perfection because perfection is required and because perfection was required god presented his own substitute in the form of his own son christ jesus took our place the prophet said he took our place so that we could take his because that's the purpose he died for oh hallelujah isn't that right praise god amen hallelujah so that he can make a way for perfection so that you could come to it oh my if he didn't make our way we couldn't get in there and now that he has made our way what have we got to do die out ourselves isn't that right our sacrifice is required now watch but god requires a sacrifice somebody has to die in order for somebody to live am i right that's the reader adam uh the reason adam and his wife sewed those fig leaves together is because they found that they were naked isn't that right hallelujah isn't that right okay now uh where are we at here okay prophet said on prodigal one more time he said believe uh before we leave this here about the fake leaves he said i wish you say one more word he said notice what god did when he met with adam and them he said they had their own uh their own made religion it hasn't been 24 hours ago till someone said brother branham you know what my religion is he said my religion is the golden rule prophet said do unto others as you have others do to you isn't that right and i said well that's that's good but that hasn't got any salvation in it prophet said that's right except a man be born again he will in no wise enter the kingdom born of the spirit of god renewed regenerated become a new person in christ jesus all things passed away and all things become new converted changed over going your road this way and turn come this way and vice versa isn't that right but now when they they when they stood before god adam he was afraid to come out he said i'm naked he said now notice god went out and got some skins got in made aprons tied them around notice if god got skins he had to kill something this was it here this is where i got it from somebody had to die in order to make a covering he killed something he got the skins off them and something died in their place because their penalty was death and so an innocent victim had to die for the guilty to cover them up isn't that right i said so it is today friends not the golden rule which is all right not the ten commandments which is holy but god killed something to cover you up oh his son jesus christ died on calvary the innocent for the guilty to make a way that you and i might be innocent in him before god oh you stand blameless in him before god oh hallelujah hallelujah when he died you die and when he rose again you rose oh we are in him oh isn't that right and that's the thing that the holy spirit is searching through the land today says trying to find someone to believe on him to believe on jesus christ amen and amen oh mercy so the beginning of jesus fame 1953 he said brother sister the church ought to get in god's program he said then the church will move all right just like suppers and dinners and so forth to appropriate money he said that's not good way of doing it pay a tithe see that's what god wants you to do see just keep in god's program he'll bless the giver and so forth okay he promised it he said no so if we substitute something else just like we've substituted theology today to take the place of the baptism of the holy spirit he said it'll never work oh hallelujah it can't he said we've substituted multitudes instead of power he said but it will never take the place of power oh i want to say that again my my my maybe didn't get that hallelujah he said so if we substitute something else just like we've substituted theology today to take the place of the baptism of the holy ghost and fire the devil keeps fighting that you know he's fighting the holy spirit praise god because he knows the holy spirit the holy spirit is not something man could control oh isn't that right man can control his own thoughts his own ideas his own information his own thing and his own agenda and his own modus are parana and his own amen isn't that right he could control that but he can't control the holy spirit isn't that right no church can hold the holy spirit isn't that right glory to god hallelujah hallelujah holy spirit ain't stationed here somewhere praise god hallelujah like some kind of god booth or something no holy god moves where he wants to he moves in and out of his church manifesting himself moving in and out among us that will be the when we're worshiping the living christ oh hallelujah we just create a space we just create an atmosphere we just create an anointing we release our faith into the atmosphere and god fixing to move god who knows the end from the beginning who knows the condition of your heart can move in any time he wants to and heal the sick and raise the dead and cast out devils and help somebody and lift up somebody and rebuke and correct and chasten that's what the holy ghost was given for amen and amen isn't that right oh my it'll never work you can't substitute anything for it see the prophet said no other life will work in this bride oh glory to god that's that's it alone he said we've substituted multitudes instead of power it'll never take the place of power god is power he is the almighty god the power of all powers is god hey give him a shout of praise hallelujah glory to god he's a powerful powers oh he's anointing of all anointings oh he's a blessing of all blessings oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah he is god almighty amen he can't substitute it so we don't want to substitute this morning amen not a man made one we want the original we want what god has for us amen amen and nothing less isn't that right okay let me skip over to abraham and isaac let's look at this here after waiting 25 years for our son god said offer him up what was it a test on obedience isn't that right after waiting 25 years for this promised son isaac now god want to see if he would stay faithful to god's word amen regardless of the cause amen regardless of what it cost him isn't that right and you know we know that the story when they went up on the mountain as i spoke unto his father abraham said father i see the word i see everything set up the altar i see but i don't see a sacrifice isn't that right and abraham took his amen all right but god uh abraham talked to his son he said amen how did god provide for himself see a sacrifice oh hallelujah isn't that right and abraham took his own son bound him laid his son on the altar here was his only son abraham waited 25 years for this son and now he has to obey a commandment from god to offer him up this was a commandment offer up your son isaac that was what god spoke to him this was a word he might have wrestled with it he might have thought about it a long time but he knew it was the word of god and he received it as the word of god hallelujah and abraham in obedience went up that mountain with his son to offer him up praise god as the commandment of the lord oh is that right and he took his son his only son oh doesn't it sound familiar he took his son his only son and bound him quickly and laid him upon an altar and he took a knife oh abraham holding a knife in his hand oh just imagine it friends or just catch a vision of it abraham with the knife in his hand coming down you know what coming next oh blood is coming next death was coming next our sacrifice was coming next oh he's getting ready to offer him up oh i could imagine abraham holding his hand up there with the knife coming down praise god isaac with his eyes closed he'll know what's going to take place praise god hallelujah oh holy shut everything out abraham coming down hallelujah with the knights oh this hide too holy in the name of god hallelujah and he's coming down praise god and god come and break through the silence and say abraham abraham oh hold your hand praise god oh hallelujah what did god do he pushed abraham beyond the point of human limits abraham would made up his mind at that point in time that he was going to offer up his son and when god looked at abraham's heart he saw the obedience in that man and god had to do something oh hallelujah he said abraham because i know now that you love me oh and blessing i will bless thee and multiply and i multiply that seed oh hallelujah glory and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy oh because you are willing to go beyond human limits oh and offer up thy son thine only son or when abraham threw away the knife and he grabbed his son isaac oh and they hugged each other and cried they looked over into the corner and what did they see it was a ram caught in the thicket oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah oh my do you catch it isaac was supposed to die then but god provided a substitute god provided his own substitute whose realm was that that was god's ram or a ram caught on the thicket god put that there holly said offer that up instead oh holy what a moment what a time oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh brother we were supposed to die oh i see myself as isaac this morning i was supposed to lay on that altar that knife was coming down for me but god brought provided his own substitute oh hallelujah he provided a ram and a thicket for me hallelujah my god my god how can i help but praise him i cannot help but shout how can i help but lift my hands oh and i think of the goodness of jesus i should have died oh hallelujah but jesus rose up one time and set his face toward jerusalem he said i died for them i paid the price for them father the always come and he lifted up his eyes to heaven and screamed on the cross it pleased god to tear his own son into pieces oh hallelujah glory to god hallelujah oh to sacrifice him on calvary's tree it please god hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to take the place for me and you tell me i can't praise god you tell me i can't shout you tell me i can't lift my hands hallelujah we have a right this morning oh to every blessing that he died for we have a right to be healed to be delivered to be all set free to every chain to be broken he took your place he took your place he stood in a gap for you he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing you didn't know what you was doing but he died for you when you couldn't see where you was going god offered up a substitute god took your place oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my my my hallelujah god provided a substitute and abraham called that place jehovah jairo the lord provided hallelujah glory to god isn't that right it was named jehovah jairo after the god i provided he provided all that you have needed of this morning whatever y'all need of he's already provided it oh he owns a cattle on a thousand hills oh my isn't that right hallelujah it's not right burnt offering isn't that right this was a substitute said now i've watched now the blood of bulls and goats and ashes and a heifer sprinkling unclean sprinkling to the unclean sandify to the praying of the flesh this is the scripture we read in hebrews uh sanctified to the purifying of the flesh well how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit of offered himself without support to god purge your conscience from death from dead works to serve the living god isn't that right when israel is joining true wilderness we know the story that they were sacrificial lambs bulls goats etc that acted as a substitute for the sins of the people at that time and god accepted that until the perfect one could come forth isn't that right it's not right christ's death at calvary what was it it was our substitute it's not right yet he was the original amen so that was god's original substitute that he sent from glory to take our place isn't that right prophet said on god's provided way 1953 and paragraph 6 he says how that on one man the iniquity of all the world was laid all the sins all the sickness of all the everything that was wrong was laid upon that one sheep god's provided lamb and he took him up to calvary and crucified him to be the substitute for all wickedness oh mercy for our sins and our transgressions and all that we've done against god and all that we've done against ourselves and ever he was god's provided sacrifice for us god's provided away and now god has always had a way he's got to wait tonight and god always before he sends judgment he always makes a way of escape out of every trial amen god makes a way of escape isn't that right and god makes a way before he sends his judgment he said i might say first before he sends his judgment he always sends mercy hey isn't that right mercy said no oh i'm not gonna let you go not gonna let you slip away praise god hallelujah amen and sovereign grace hallelujah when love projected itself sovereign grace took over amen my stature of perfect man 1962 here's the prophet speaking he said i pledged this morning praying at the end of the message day just read this out i just love what he said said i pledge this morning to him with all my heart watch that by his help and by his grace i pray that i'll seek daily without ceasing until i feel every one of those requirements flowing in this little old stature of mine till it can be a manifestation of the living christ for he became sin like me that i might become righteousness of god like him oh hallelujah isn't that right isn't that right he became sin like me that i may become righteousness of god like him watch prophet said he took my place lord let me take his now because that's the purpose he died for oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god man amen hallelujah glory to god isn't that right amen who is man or dog mindful of him amen hallelujah glory to god i remember the stephen he read that scripture this morning amen holly took our place who are we that he would take our place the sons and daughters of god amen amen he died for you he loved you before and because he first loved you he purchased your salvation on calvary's tree oh hallelujah oh that's enough that's enough is that not enough to love him i don't know what is praise god amen oh hallelujah amen and amen praise god amen just a few moments now i know time is running a few moments here now saul was anointed king now watch look at this substitute here now now here's the negative side of it so when the prophet samuel heard the moments of the people isn't that right even uh and then all the elders of israel got it themselves together came to samuel unto rama and said unto him behold our old thy sons walk not in thy ways isn't that right and now make us a king to judge us like all the nations isn't that right and this thing plea this please samuel and when they said give us a king to judge us and samuel prayed unto the lord and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee oh my for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should reign over them oh my god hallelujah isn't that right so he says according to all the works which they have done since the day that i have brought them out of egypt so god is recall we're calling now yeah it's not right all that he has done for the people even unto this day i call him out of egypt wherewith they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee it was rejection amen isn't that right the people rejected the leadership of god at that time and god felt that rejection amen amen because he no longer wanted the word of the prophet unto them or the word of the lord unto them but they wanted their own thing amen they wanted fig leaves let's call it that amen my he said now therefore hearken unto their voice how be thee protest solemnly unto them and show them the man of the king that shall reign over them and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked of him a king oh isn't that right my god hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right glory to god and look at this here now the same spirit here now upon the people rejection is that right is a human is a human trait now is our human behavior that just keeps coming out it's all over the bible here see watch we can see that same spirit now here the people can also be seen in the wilderness when the people was brought to the mountain isn't that right and god went up there to hear from the lord people began to murmur isn't that right when the people saw that moses delayed to come down from the mount amen written exodus here the the people gathered themselves exodus 32 uh the people guiding themselves out onto aaron and said unto him up said azan rise get up make us gods isn't that right we shall go before us as for uh for as this for us for this moses the man that brought us about the land of egypt we what not what has become of him you know those we don't know where he is or what's going on so we need a god we want to worship a god make us something yo you call yourself a priest do something make something isn't that right and everyone said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and your daughters bringing them unto me isn't that right and all the people break off their golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them onto aaron and he received them under their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it in a molten calf and they said peas be thy gods oh israel see the spirit same spirit here now rejecting the leadership of the holy spirit and taking a substitute taking something else that brought the other land of egypt is that right and when aaron saw it he built an altar and aaron made proclamation and said tomorrow shall be a feast of the lord and so forth isn't that right now here hear this kicker now and the lord said unto moses he said go get thee down watch for thy people which thou brought out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf i worship him so god see everything just because you not seeing doesn't mean that god doesn't see he is not right he sees in the secret place amen isn't that right the god that seeth in secret oh he knows what you're doing isn't that right my they've turned aside quickly watch they made a molten calf they worship it and sacrificed there unto and said these be thy gods oh israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiff-necked people oh my god hallelujah are stiff-necked people or what you hear that it sounds familiar right now let's get over to accent number seven and 51. here's stephen rebuking the people is now right uh in that day stephen rose up isn't that right just before he was killed huh and he said recalling the spirit of god is upon him he's preaching to the people rebuking the people and god is recalling this very incident here praise god hallelujah in the wilderness he said watch he said ye stiff neck and uncircumcised in heart and heirs ye do always resist the holy ghost as so your father's dead so do you hey man isn't that right holly and so it is today stiffness praise god i don't want to listen praise god they're abstinent praise god they want their own way they prefer fake leaves and become god's provided way but they prefer to take a substitute praise god hallelujah isn't that right my amen and amen my my my glory to god honestly is that something isn't that right huh it's a human behavior see human nature prophet said i am my biggest enemy me william branham not anybody else i've got to get myself out of the way if i get william branham out of the way amen then god could move then the sick would be healed then the blind could see it in a crippled walk then the gospel could be preaching his power when i get out of the way or what an example for amen for us to look at hallelujah and if he had to get out of the way how much more you and i have to get out of the way oh hallelujah allah overt brings it out he says you don't want anything to hinder the flow of god in your life there should be no obstacles amen in the pipeline to hinder the flow of god so that you could become a direct channel for inspiration and communications of god that god could speak through you amen to the people and be a reflection of his perfection of his holiness in this hour and this time that we're living in oh my isn't that right it's not right stiff neck they say that that saying comes from dealing with cattle you know oxen and different things no right just like elisha used to drive the oxen before elijah come and drop the mantle upon him he used to drive oxen that was elijah elisha's occupation isn't that right till the soil till the land and when you're prime when you're prodding the cattle say sometimes you're probably cattle or the ox goal isn't that right prodding the cattle keeping it going and he said sometimes they call it stiff neck because the ox sometimes just doesn't want to do the work somebody just doesn't want to go in the direction that you're going they're trying to tell it to sometimes the goal is there to prob them keep them going keep them in line keep them straight on the word isn't that right you've got to stay on the word anything else is just a substitute oh it's not the real thing yet but you've got to stay on the course two degrees off and you'll find yourself way out back somewhere praise god plumb off holiday believing on something else instead of the lord jesus christ stay with that word oh keep your eye on the prize oh no wonder elisha was so focused he spent all his life training for this moment to keep his eye on the oxen now he was keeping his eye on the prophet oh everywhere the prophet go he was following everywhere elijah go he was following you stay here at gilgal stay here in battle hallelujah pray but he had a revelation something told him his experience told him i got to stay with this man he's got the thing i need he's got what i need praise god i don't care how far i don't care how long i have to walk i don't care how long i have to go i'll not be stiff neck praise god i keep my eye on him if he turn left i'm turning left if you turn right i'm turning right but i got my eye on him oh double time double time praise god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hey many many man hallelujah see stephen wasn't there when god spoke to moses but that same spirit was upon him rebuking the people stiff night uncircumcised of ears and heart resisting the holy spirit isn't that right and so they do today resisting the true holy spirit when it comes the spirit of truth guiding us into all truth god promised that he would send another comforter amen amen isn't that right what better praise god comforted on the holy spirit himself amen he couldn't be here in that literal way christ was to come again but he sent his holy spirit here in your hearts as an earnest of the expectation of his second coming oh hallelujah before he that while he comes while he's on his way we have the holy spirit our comfort oh how to keep us to show us what to do isn't that right hallelujah in our hearts in our lives as paul said seal with that holy spirit of promise o hallelujah glory to god isn't that right my they had that same covering the people at that time pharisees sadducees stephen rebuked them they had that covering what was it fake leaves the eyes of veil they couldn't see praise god god manifesting in his own sons and daughters oh my man-made teachings dogmas doctrines rejecting the holy spirit oh my isn't that right so we have to remove these fig leaves friends oh we have to remove these coverings pray god the bible talks about we all with open face be holy and hallelujah the glory of the lord when we do that when we take off all the veils off of our eyes when we take of all the human veils all the veils of self-will all the veils of what you want and what your idea is pray and you put on hallelujah hold the love of god hallelujah and take off all those human veils isn't that right just like elijah had to tear up his own old clothes to receive a new mantle oh to receive a new comment oh hallelujah so do you have to tear off your old things all things are passed away behold i make all things new oh hallelujah amen brother isaac over praise god hallelujah glory put on a new robe oh hallelujah put on righteousness put on holiness put on love put on forgiveness oh hallelujah glory to god i'll put on repentance oh turn around this is your season for turn around oh hallelujah may god turn you around today may god turn you around right now oh hallelujah holiday on the day you hear my voice hard not your heart is in the provocation oh glory peter god hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah don't reject it receive it willingly openly inwardly praise god amen remove these coverings today oh hallelujah i pray that's our desire i pray that's what we want no more fig leaves no more hiding let's behold him oh hallelujah shed all our rights away in this world of sin oh hallelujah are you needy of him this morning hey man amen these are the things that make us feel safe make us feel secure and that's a dangerous feeling because king yuzaya once felt that feeling this feeling of self-secure this feeling of of nobody could tell me what to do because he was so obstinate when he went into the temple going to offer up going off up incense and stuff isn't that right and the priest picked him don't do it don't do it don't do it you went in there anyway and what happened got struck down isn't that right oh my hallelujah and when he died hallelujah it shook isaiah the prophet at that time is that right hallelujah because he was leaning on king uzziah oh such a blessed and wonderful man but even the greatest of them fall sometimes or you better be leaning on christ put not your trust in the legs of a man or in a prince where there is no help but our eyes look towards the hills from where comet or help david said my help cometh from the lord not even the hills could help me but there's a god out there somewhere who's greater than them hills greater than the mountains oh isn't that right david when he looked towards the hills from whence commented help it had enemies behind them hills it had enemies behind their mountains waiting to take the kingdom any time israel slipped them fellows running down take over david said look to the hills won't come with my help praise god my enemies are watching me praise god dying night and day looking to see me fall looking to make a snare to make a trap for me praise god hallelujah hallelujah where's my help coming from oh holla there's something beyond there brother there's someone beyond them skies something beyond the blue hallelujah hallelujah that's keeping you that's holding the reins oh that will not let you fall praise god amen oh my praise god do you love him today praise god that's what people hide behind don't let me finish i'm almost finished anyway musician could get ready coverings hiding behind some concept of god some idea their own interpretation instead of seeing it the way god sees it the scripture that says there's a way that's seamed right onto a man but here is death now that scripture is a really serious scripture because it's such a thin line because you see we interpret things in our natural way they're things that seem right it feel okay to do this it seems right sometimes it's legitimate things that choke the plant that it would not be afford fruit in its time it's legitimate cares of this life that they allow to grow up like little weeds then they become big wheats then they become vines then they choke the plant what's taking place they're allowed to grow take over oh holla isn't that right isn't that right you got to pluck those things up friends praise god hallelujah and keep your ground fertile isn't that right praise god in the word of god all right revelation 13 6 8 16 to 8 rather revelation 13 16 to 8 and the scripture says he calls it all both small and great rich and poor free and born to receive a mark in their right hand talking about the mark of the beast isn't that right i know therefore in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had that mark or the name of the beast and the number of his name here is wisdom let him that half understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and a number his number is 600 three score and six isn't that right the antichrist friends will be christ replaced by an image isn't that right by organized religion it's not the seal of satan praise god the mark of the beast is actually a substitute that the people take in place of the holy ghost so by rejecting the holy spirit you take this mark automatically the mark of the beast the prophet brought out that you had to reject that holy spirit in order to take that man isn't that right there's no other option for the seal of god tonight praise god and the market of beasts so instead of a covering of the holy spirit amen like what adam had before the fall this is what we're supposed to receive in the end here now amen god's gonna have a true church oh they're covering the anointing the holy spirit true holy spirit works praise god the rainbow flashing of glory of spring all around us praise god that's what we're to receive and if you don't have that then what you end up with is a bi-product amen it's a man-made covering a hybrid theory praise god fig leaves all over again oh my my my my isn't that right glory to god hallelujah so i'm getting ready to wind up i am the resurrection of life 1952. the prophet said now the ministers of them they said now well he's a psychiatrist he's a mind reader he reads your mind that's how he knows what's wrong with them and them people i guess you're talking about brother branham's ministry here and he said he reads your mind see he did he said prophet said but jesus was a mind reader he said that shocked you didn't it yeah he was he perceived their thoughts is that right he said well that's what what's mine reading he said well not one of these setting out here one of these little women uh sitting around the corner reading the palm of your hand he said that's what the substitute the devil's got something to maintain imitate it he said that's the bogus dollar but to the real dollar is that right so prophet said here everything god has done the devil has made a substitute for it made something bogus see and that's the reason these two spirits in the last days come right along they'll be formal and fundamental they'll miss the spirit altogether oh mercy you see like that and some of these on the radical side go plum off into isms with it oh but right in the middle of the road runs the true church of god amen standing in the full power of god amen that is where it's at not off to the side somewhere not up to this fanaticism but right plum down the middle stay with god amen hallelujah staying with that word hallelujah and god continuing in her amen he's voicing you the voice of the archangel for this day isn't that right why is it that so many christians find it hard to live the christian life 1957 this is my last quote here and i'm finished he said listen friends let me tell you this he said now why take a substitute when the pentecostal skies are loaded with the real thing he said why try to lay upon some fantastic he said why try to rely upon some little emotion oh hallelujah glory to god why try to to lay upon that isn't that right people get so caught up in little things people get so caught up in in their own imagination and their own idea of how things supposed to be rather than getting caught up in the program of god that god has for your life that god wants from you he wants her to surrender he wants a desire oh hallelujah he wants something from you today holy a full surrender oh hallelujah you got to break down hallelujah hallelujah god's got to renovate you over amen i so appreciate that thought amen from with isaac over behold i make all things new you see god is not going to replace you he's going to restore you hallelujah he's gonna bring you to a place where you once were isn't that right be on the moon beyond the start before there was a moon there was a star god had a place for you and that place is predestinated holly i know devil holler no demon to pull you out of your place could take you from your position oh hallelujah isn't that right oh hallelujah glory to god there's a place for you there's a place for you my brother there's a place for you my sister jesus told his disciples behold hallelujah i go to prepare a place for you that where i am there you may be also hallelujah amen is not right hallelujah let me tell you something hallelujah this human body is not the real thing this human body is a substitute oh you didn't hear me this just said this just to keep to harness the soul that carried you praise god this just this is for our time this is for a temporal season but they're going to come an hour when this mortal shall put on immortality right now we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part will be done away which oh and this mortal will put on immortality and in a moment and in a twinkling of an eye this poor substitute for our body is going to put on a perfect body this poor little substitute of mine oh all he's going to put on perfect holy spirit works you're going to be just like jesus you're going to walk like him you're going to talk like him you're gonna look like him you're gonna live like him you're gonna forgive like him you're gonna live like him on earth oh you're gonna hallelujah oh glory to god you're gonna be molded you're gonna be melt you're gonna be shaped into his image from glory to glory to glory from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord and we will open face no veils no fig leaves beholding the glory of the lord our change into this image from glory to glory to glory to glory oh hallelujah god wants to pour out his spirit upon the bride in the last days it'll be wave after wave of a rushing mighty wind the holy spirit filling your heart filling your soul filling your life changing you making you hallelujah into what he wants you to be oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god there'll be brides brides there'll be churches churches but there must come one oh hallelujah all the way holly just coming onto something but god will have our original one day praise god hallelujah just like him hallelujah to stand like him in that evil day having done all to stand stand there for oh my let me finish up here he said oh some little thing or another he said there's nothing to it he said watch why try to lay upon some fantastics why try to rely on some little emotion or some little something that's nothing to when the pentecostal skies the real pentecostal skies are just crowded with the real thing he says don't take a substitute when you can get the real he said paul said all these things i do he said they'll pass away all tongues will cease everything else will go but when love has come it will endure forever oh sure don't take a substitute no sir i want the real one oh i want to leave i want to be a real christian i don't want to be anything like it i want the real oh he said nothing but the real here it is for you oh hallelujah praise god oh i feel god this morning hallelujah he said pentecostal skies i just loaded right now pentecost is not some assembly he said pentecost don't mean altogether foursquare pentecost is not a denomination he said it's an experience it's an experience experience that constrained you to the love of god he said and then what is these other things he said his attributes apples that fall off the tree see he said but but don't get the apple before the tree he said get the tree and then it'll bear the apples hey and that's what we want today god is driving us back to the tree of life praise god if we get to that tree the signs will follow isn't that right oh you can have all the signs and fantastics you want you can pick up around the tree and but you still don't have the tree the tree has got the life oh hallelujah you see you're just taking something that fell off the tree but get the tree first he says and it will bear itself but if your tree isn't yielding these things there's something wrong that's right he said this is what you want that original tree amen amen oh i'm finished today may the lord bless you oh hallelujah why don't you just worship him right now and just bless his name oh hallelujah glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah yes lord hey remember to see my verse he comes to sing amen
