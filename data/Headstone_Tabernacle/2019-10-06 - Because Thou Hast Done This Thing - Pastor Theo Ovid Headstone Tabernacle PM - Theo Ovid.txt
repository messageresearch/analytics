Amen wanna turn our Bibles to Genesis chapter 22 wanna read verse 1 to 18 of Genesis up to 22 it's so good to be back here and see all of you out amen Genesis chapter 22 verse 1 says and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto Him Abraham he said of them behold here he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest like that get the internet I'm not the one I get into the land of Moriah offer him up there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell the earth if I'm Russa the leaner morning service assam took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son cleaved the wood for the burnt offering Rosa went up into the place of which God had told him they're gonna turn am I'm a little busy I saw the place afar off and Abram said unto his young men a baggie here good ass and I and the lad would go up yonder and worship and come down to you the Abraham took the wood the burnt offering lead upon Isaac his son he took the fire in his hand a knife went together both of them together and as I speak unto Abram his father and said My father he said here my my son he said Behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and Abram said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together they came to pass the place where God had told him and even built an altar there laid the wood in order bound Isaac his son Liam upon the altar upon the wood and ibrahim stretched for his hand took that knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham he said here am i he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God she endures not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abram lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns Abram went and took the RAM offering up a blood offering instead of his son and Abram called the name of the place do-over Tyra as it is said to this day in the month of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called the Abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn she has the Lord for because that was done this thing and hast not withheld thy son and only Son that in blessing I will bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven as the Sun which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations be blessed because I was obeyed my voice may God bless his word you may be seated who praise God this exhortation we push communion table and the title of the rang is because that was done this thing those words were spoken before because there was done this thing the Garden of Eden man felt was it because thou has done this thing you disobey my voice get kicked out that's what we agree here were people dying because that was done this thing but this is a different thing that was done here this was a man that was inspired by God yet inspiration to hear for the voice of God this man called Abraham and I choose to bring this as an emphasis because there's something that you have to do not because you have said this thing because you have done this thing because once it just reveals has to be tested once is reveal it has to be tested like 10 percent say Amen the others meditation of the food a date I don't know but once it has been revealed it has to be tested that's what God does he tests because he want the best and the test Springs are the best in you and I only the test could do that I want to say it again the test bring out the best what if the students is who got no tests promoted from for one the form to the treat of water 5 what don't have money in there from 5 what would happen in job market the test filters the best from the rest the testers back and the tests provide the cue to send the person to the higher level so as you pass this test of faith you could rule the virtue mental knowledge then to temperance and patience and godliness there's every level of a test because one want the best at the top of it see it I'm not getting less Satan a delusion less than his best he has illusions best forces in this last day the challenge the bride two hundred thousand Thousand Devils coming loose against this bride don't have to lose his best also or glory to God so God bring the nobodies the people that they look like they are bright the people that have this condition that condition he chose you that you chose Gideon like it was just I don't mass and Sampson like he chose all them who was a faith there wasn't looking like the people that were supposed to be but God made them it's not what you look at is what you have to become it's what you have to be designed into I love em people study destiny but called I study destiny a lot of people really live for the know but God has studied beyond the know that's why the words were spoken in blessing I will bless thee and multi-planar multiply thee and I see took my destiny talk about what is to come he's on top of what sin Fronteras me
