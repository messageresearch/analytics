praise God in Maine it's good to be here praise God just quickly I want us to go to read a scripture and I have the scripture here Genesis chapter 18 from verse 9 to 14 and reached this wise and they said unto Him we re Sarada wife and he said behold in the tenth and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and Lord Sarah the wife shall have a son and Sarah hary in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and was stricken in age and it seems to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a surety be a child which I am told is anything too hard for the Lord added time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son may God a blessing to the reading of his ward in Jesus Christ's name Amen you may be seated just very little salutation I want to greet and salute the our hosts pastor T Ovid and his family and church and acres of government for the Reno's together for this special summertime meeting I want to also recognize I know the presence of other ministers here from all around the globe from Nigeria Ghana South Africa Europe Germany UK and America Argentina all around the world and all of you there in the internet or watching I want to say may God richly bless you so for me is a privilege to be here to bring you this testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ I'm here to testify amen and I want to keep the title of my testimony running through the inspiration and I title it seat time my subject is time of life and inspiration recognize your message and your day praise God a main hallelujah time of life time of life is a very special time is a seed time and recognizing that the Word of God is a seed jesus said that in the Bible and he said that this seed that was planted said that was the Word of God praise God remain hallelujah amen so and we know that God came to visit Abraham according to the promised word and when that time came for God to fulfill his promise nothing could stop him and I want to say for those of you that are here I want to let you know that God already had him plan and everything he has purposed for you in your life shall surely come to pass at his own time not at your own time praise God Amane and what is it the evening time message is the message of the hour is the message of Malachi 4 it has come it is to here with us because the Holy Spirit is still identifying with his word according to how it has been spoken and I notice that the Lord can never fail so God sent Malachi 4 at this end time and we know the challenges that normally come when God sends his prophets when he sent Moses he faced the challenge when he first nor infests the challenge and this time around he also sent Malachi 4 we will also have a challenge but despite of all these challenges I want to let you know God has already made a way of escape for you so there is a way of escape for you escape for you in your situations escape for you in your sickness escape for you in your maybe you think that everything is just going down and down I want to let you know God has you implant praise God a Maine so and the only thing that is required for us in this hour is nothing but God coming to take his bride away because we have seen Israel imposition we have seen that they are waiting to welcome back the Lord again but before that we take place the bride would have been taken praise God and therefore what is it god build his art and he framed it with his word and having framed it it doesn't matter how you may have tried to backslide or whatever no devil the one that I've done nothing to you for any reason it is that you are the one that's really strode away from the fortified wall that God has really done of this earth and all around by his word and then all you need to do follow the tracing of that blood the sprinkled blood of Christ and come back again into the framed Word of God and that's what God wants in this hour and I want to let you know the bride is already here and being in she's ready for the rapture and then what is it here the prophet in the message United time and sign it says here God United time yes oh my now remember now there is a uniting of the world unite him back again bring him back the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bring him back that this could only be done in this day the only time it could be done is right now it never was a attacked anyway as the went off on denominational sprays but now it don't belong to no denominational spray because it is time for the uniting of man and woman of every race every color every Creed everything on the Christ by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and back to the world praise to remain and then I want to also here before I close amen charities God is united his bride she is coming together from east and west and north and south there is a uniting time and dance on right now what is the worship uniting for the rapture amen God's getting her ready yes uniting what is what is it she is uniting width with the word for all the heavens and earth we pass away but my word shall never pass away she's uniting herself with all said the Lord regardless of what any denomination anybody has says she is uniting herself she's getting ready why she is the bride that's right and she is United herself with her bridegroom see and the bridegroom is the word in the beginning was the word and what was with God and what was God and what was made flesh and dwelt among us and that is the promise in this last day and that is our message praise God a main now in the message the world is falling apart I don't care what goes the world can fall apart but God is getting his people back again with his word he says here this is what we are supposed to stay fortified by is the world see we are surrounded by the world the world is in you God is in you around you wherever you go it is the word the word keep him always before you remember before we be conscious of him everywhere now when Eve and Adam walked like that there was no deaths the man a woman that works like that now there is no dead to him they got eternal life when you are when you are surrounded and kept by the world I want to let you know there is life for you no debts we ever come your way and I want to let you know that God has promised that because he has come to harvest back again his seed and this is the seed time and the only thing that can keep the seed is the word and you are a seed and now is the manifest in time stay with the word regardless because the word we meet every challenge at any time at any condition God richly bless you amen amen appreciate brother Charles perseverance together we appreciate you brother Charles thank you for the greetings even all the way

Scriptures so you can take the comfort of your seats and we trust that the Lord would bless us from that moment you are welcome in the name of Jesus Christ amen if you have your Bibles with you please turn with me to the book of Genesis chapter 18 Genesis chapter 18 and in Genesis 18 I want to read from the ninth verse the background is the visitation of three hinges actually two angels and one hello him amen through Abraham so I just like to cut it from verse 9 to 19 amen and they said unto Him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah had it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were hold and well striking in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah loved within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a surety bear a child which I'm hold is anything to for the Lord at that time appointed are we return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I loved not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou did love and the men rose up from thence and looked toward Sodom and Abram went with them to bring them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham death in which I do saying that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgments that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he had spoken of him may the Lord had his blessings to the reading of his holy word god bless you you may be seated I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and welcome all the believers both present and on the virtual land to the meetings this year in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I've been told that believers connected from many parts of the world Latin Spanish French English many more language speaking countries amen and well known unto God how all his ways that we cannot at this time be physically present in the land of the Caribbean they call Twin Cities Trinidad but physically we might be hindered in our movement but the Word of God cannot be hindered amen there is no circumstance on earth that can hinder God or his word so we were told that if our technology rise up to eat even the words that our Lord Jesus Christ spoke while was he on earth can still be you know captured or honest and brought to the hearing of mankind because God's Word does not die so if it does not die and it cannot die it cannot also be hindered because that word is life so we thank God it knows about this time before the foundation of the world and he has also made adequate arrangements to get his watch across to his own despite all their hearts amen we thank God for a season like this we were told that there have been true global major pandemic on earth in recent time those who know if they arrived told us we had a major one in 1820 then another one in 1920 and a century later we are having another one in 2020 in between we have at Severus but they said they haven't be one that had a global spread all over the earth than this ones that we haven't and the remarkable thing for me about this current pandemic is that it's apt us to look at some silent things that are taking place for which believers should not gloss over the world by not know anything about it but as children of God will understand according to the scriptures and their review world Israel is our time peace the Prophet said if you want to know what time of the deities you can look at your wrist watch or a clock but if you want to know the hour you are living in the garage of Li spiritually look at Israel amen and one thing I saw in Makapuu in Israel which I have shared locally is that for the first time in known history since the advent of Christ the perfect and the original Passover Israel has not been able to celebrate their Passover within the context of the solemnity and the sincerity of the very first one that was instituted in the book of Exodus and the book of Exodus the Passover was meant to be a ransom for the firstborn amen and because the firstborn of the Egyptians were to be wiped out while the firstborn of the Israelites were to survive and the article for survivor is the blood he said when I see the Blood I will pass over you is that what the Bible said all right dust was the article for Survivor it never meant much to the Egyptian but it meant everything it mental life to an Israelite amen but you see the way it was to be celebrated was with serious caution and the so banished it was to be celebrated endure it was to be celebrated you know with some sobriety people are to be gathered ready prepared to leave the land of their slavery so it wasn't with such funfair you know ceremonies something to laugh about it was something to really be sober about and to do it with our consecration that was the spirit with which the Passover was instituted but over the years after the advent of Christ I think that soberness was lost because it became a celebration it became a party it became a family gathering until blows away even gathering for the Passover never understood the purpose or the meaning as it is always said the meaning of it get lost from generation through generation amen and you can see Israel returning back to the homeland in 1948 with the proclamation of 1946 and since then they restore the Passover but they were doing it more like a party like a funfair but for the first time in any known history hallelujah God allowed Israel to go back to the solemn celebration you know there was no Israel in 1820 there was none in 1920 Israel exists but never as a nation amen because since they were scattered in AD 70 by the invasion of Rome entitled general they were never recognized as a nation again so if there was any celebration at all it would be in the land of they're scattered in a wand'rin but as a nation they came back together after ad 70 in 1948 but the celebration they began to have threw out the meaning and the solemnity and the soberness of that ceremony until this year so the blessing the pandemic brought was to return Israel back to the sober celebration of Passover now this Passover of this year happens to be just exactly at the time of the Gentiles Easter and it is the same celebration it was Easter to the Gentiles it was a pass over to his realized amen they were celebrating the shadow Passover for the Gentiles that of accepted Christ are celebrating the real power Savva which is the Lord Jesus Christ and gods who arranged that it came together it's a pond at about the same time senses in this time around but God forbid Israel to do it like a party it returns to the original and a lot of Israelites were not happy about it they said that Passover was to be celebrated endure and they said the young people we are so sad but to me it was a joy you know I it's a call return it's a call to return to the original form of worship it's a preparation for Israel to start preparing for their visitation while it's a message to the Gentile world to stop preparing for their home no Israel in 1820 no Israel in 1920 but there is Israel in 2020 for the first time Israel celebrated Passover like it was in the original behind the closed door and in so banished that should speaks something to the bride of Jesus Christ it's a message French things are winding down and coupled with the fact that we've just been told that the greatest interest of Israelites young people today it's about the advent of the Messiah so if young people in Israel are watching for the coming of Messiah and the Gentile people are going into apostasy it's indeed true that the Gentile days are numbered so friends things are happening they will be rising and it will be going down and one of these days in the midst of each our Lord will come let's get ready for our redemption is near I want to appreciate a statue of it for a time like this and a platform to reach out to the sense of God all over the world appreciate brother heizak Oviedo also and all the rest of the minister's the officers the boat and the church at edge stone Tabernacle he ain't Rena Dutch and we pray that the blessings of God will rests upon your ministries upon your churches your families and your labor for the kingdom may God bless and be with you all and to the audience all over the world I say Shalom to the bride of Jesus Christ so this moment if the Lord would be our health I want to go with the theme of the convention by speaking on that time of life in the time of God amen the time of life in the time of God amen the scripture average which I believe is also the scripture for the convention was speaking of the visitation of three men to a God's elect in the beginning generation and this scripture is very important more than importance to the bride of Jesus Christ because this is one of the Old Testament scripture that explains the condition and the working of God in our own generation whatever you read in Genesis chapter 18 is a shadow as powerful as it is amen Abraham was a shadow Sarah was a shadow the holy real thing in there was the angel I'm not even speaking of the three angels I'm speaking of one from among the three amen is the only one who represented himself the rest that you saw in there the other angels all this character called Abram and Sarah we are representing something as people some people as their reason that one angel represented himself is because is the Ancient of Days is the same yesterday today and forever he is the one writing this entire story he is the one that story revolves around a man so evenly brought in some other actors in other to give us a preload of what is to take place in this end time and that is why this scripture is important to the bride of Jesus Christ so in this shadow we saw an angel that was caught hello him amen Abram gave a proof that it was not a Trinitarian here that it was a believer in the only one God of Israel because one of the sons of Abraham later said yea o Israel the Lord thy God is one and if it was truly a son of Abraham then that means abraham believed in one God you will ask me how when this angel came down the reason it was women to unveil himself to Abraham was because it said Abram will teach his generation so one of the things Abram taught is generation was the true revelation of Godhead that God is not three God is just one because Abraham was a believer in one God so it wasn't difficult for Moses to believe in one God it wasn't difficult for the Patriots to believe in one God three angels actually came down amen but when Abraham will address the three angels he said my lord he never said my Lords of many when two of them went to shoulder and lots call them my lords both three appeared to Abraham and Abraham said my lord so Abram believed in one God Abram had the perfect God at revelation a new three people came down but he knew who is God was among them because before that time he has been interacting with Abraham so Abram only listened to a familiar voice Alleluia and the Prophet give us a background to this visitation I hope I don't take your time today amen he told us that Abraham having made a proper choice of choosing the lunch of the desert as against the lunch we are not chose the land of the plain well watered Lance Amen things never went easy for Abraham but the Abram was demonstrating a Christian character here in preferring his brother ahead of himself it was the one who brought lot out it was the one who made lot whatever worth lot a Hodge Abram was responsible because he brought a lot of nothing and he made him so large they became so large until the lands will not contain the truth and there is a need for them to separate that separation was the program of God because without that separation Abram will not have this visitation of the three angels and that visitation was very important because the continuity of Abraham's generation by covenant relied upon that visitation without that visitation Abraham's generation we only before that by Ishmael but Ishmael was not a covenant product the plan of God was to deal with Abram according to a covenants and the only person that can carry on that covenant has to be somebody from Sarah but don't forget Sarah does not feel does not look though is not in a situation amen to be able to bring forth to continue that generation this is why this visitation is necessary for a great beam to come and restore the time of life because without the restoration of the time of life in God's time there will never be an Abrahamic generation you will have the Arabs but you will never have Israel another would you have Israel by the spirit so you yourself will never be here so this visitation was very important and I think the devil appreciated the importance of the visitation and it tried out to make sure it never happened the Prophet by the Revere word told us that the deadest visitation was to come was a terrible bad day for Abraham because of the choice image set and mature it was afflicting him when he told not the land is before us choose decide you want the Bible said by sites not by revelation Lord chose the path towards Sodom it was able to see opportunity for better economy he was able to see opportunity for financial and economic prosperity because it was looking by sight but friends when you are looking by sight the thing you are not seeing a much more than what you are saying believers are not to be are not strange and not built up to look by natural eyes they are to look by faith FET is the power to see beyond what your five senses can declare and it is those things that your five senses cannot declare that are more material to your existence it is those things that will affect your eternity is gonna be by faith church Lord couldn't see the destruction of his wife the destruction of his children they wiping out of all that he had in life it didn't seem safe ending up in a shame of having to become father by his own daughters why because he was looking by natural aside but the Bible told us Abram by faith Abraham didn't look natural it looks super natural and so when Lord choose that better place it wasn't nothing to Hebron he accepted the desert land but the devil will always make you feel you did a wrong thing so the Prophet said you know what the devil did he made him so far for that choice each day there was one story or the other oh the land was too dry that grasses wither the kacho couldn't get food and they were dying and we were like this we were coming this way and this one died and that one died that cat who had died this was happening brother Brahm said it got bad on sister Sarah mama Sarah and to begin to pull trouble with Abraham for allowing a little lot to take a better pass and the commotion was so much in the house and until father Abraham had to say excuse me I have enough eat let me just go out for some fresh air amen sometimes the pressure pile up on horse just walk out for a fresh air don't give in to your pressure because you know I when it gets so much under pressure it is the Scarecrow of the devil to keep you from your visitation it is really gets the darkest before the daybreak the darkest part of the night is not true a.m. is not 1:00 a.m. is not even 3:00 a.m. it is that time when the darkness are being congealed pressed together to give way to sunlight that is around 4:00 5:00 a.m. in the morning what a paradox but that is when it gets the darkest and when it gets the darkest around you it's an announcement that your son will soon shine don't ever give in to the devil don't buckle down under pressure don't faint in the days of adversity because it is only a scarecrow trying to keep you from your visitation Abram refused to Baku down it just said mama Sarah everything will be all right it's okay just calm down let me take some fresh air we've got enough bad news for the day but we need some fresh air and as he came out to get some fresh air within a few moments here came the three men coming the professor that was what did ever want Abram to miss so if they are picked up Korah with the wife if he had been in a state of a trouble in a state of Sue stupa in a state of sadness it will never see those people pass by so land to rise above it French land to buy passage that was the language of the Prophet is that I bypass that land to bypass that so that you don't miss your visitation and when these three men came they must have saluted each other under the next message the nestin was Abraham they met a store they will go but Abraham said gentlemen please turn in I can see a lot of doors over you I can help you a bit with some refreshment you must have been traveling for long just get in let's make refresh you get some watch get some drink and you can continue your journey as the accepted to come around he offered them more packages the user the reason why the Bible said give yourself to hospitality amen seeds of Abraham are us beatable if you are not hospitable you need to find out what your genealogy is amen Abraham was willing to give everything to strangers it didn't know because there was a witness in his heart hallelujah and the masalas beard up witness in our heart there must always be a bubble of compassion for every true seed of Abraham even if it cost you your last meal give it the one all restored the flan the oil of the widow woman is still in charge the Bible told me the same yesterday today and forever does the nature of seeds of Abraham hallelujah so they turned in and he did all he could it wasn't an easy thing for a man to go and kill a goat in Rama whatever it did it dress it they prepare it and these three visitors waited patiently enough until dustin's we are prepared and ready to be eating friends God hate [Laughter] a drunk milk is how did he do it God knew what was going to happen the Prophet told me to reveal what told me that when is tap done from glory with his angels knowing that we eat in the eyes of Abraham is Pope to be bodies into existence hallelujah because in the firm they came down they will never heat but they know they must eat amen because they must give us a message amen the anonymous it so is Pope to be partisan to assistance he told his angels to step into those bodies and himself tapped into one so they look like ordinary people but they were Angelica visitors this is the reason the Bible said be auspey table he said because this is the way you entertained angels unawares they can come in the gap of the flesh of your neighbor that might be an angel and friends after they hit they enjoyed themselves I hope I'm not too slow for you this morning they enjoyed themselves and they were satisfied they declared their mission amen I think it's light it feels like the nature of God when that when - soon a mad woman has done everything amen for the representative of God at that time that was when they on the students needs they said what can we do for God is still in that business amen it knows what to do for you but sometimes he wants you to create a platform for each it wants you to present something as a basis for which it will bless you you want to use something as a medium for a visitation unto you this is why you must never be weary in well-doing it is a simple subject Amen so after they have eaten and drunk and enjoy themselves that one was the elohim among them said we are is Sarah thy wife as if she didn't know it didn't know that is just in the tents behind here so you know why we came down here few things in the message and 98 ones at the end time the prophet tops of those few things is that three things will happen one the world will be in a certain condition women it's a number two this is the hour for jinns and Gimbels to arise we have seen them already amen and I said number three it is also the hour for the revelation of the Son of Man so we have come down for few purposes number one I not we again so the god amongst them know himself and under children who are connected to that God also know themselves and they know their father amen it will take a bastard to after he father's as a matter for no one as three fathers but it is it looks but static when three people are laying claim to a father thank God we are songs were not bastard we know our Father we know where we came from we are pedigree because we can trace our genealogy Alleluia is a high we'll visit Sarah according to the time of life when Sarah Hodge that she knew what it meant said he said by this time next year Sarah will carry a son that was too much for Sarah who believe she said me out of my head don't forget by the time it came to Abram and Sarah hundred years old even less than hundred was already well stricken in age do you realize that in the days of Enoch in the days of Methuselah Abram would be a kid but since it was pronounced the day you eat the error of that day you die that death has been shown in symptoms in the decimation of the age of the individual until when it came to Abraham being an honorary Alfred or ninety was already hold and striking in age because that was the testimony of the Bible concerning this couple said they were old and well stricken so Sarah saying what he said she knew what she was saying she understood the rhythm of our body she understood a chemistry but this doesn't matter to God who created that body who knew about that chemistry in new world Sarah was in new it has ceased to be with her according to the manner of women before he said I will visit and for you to understand it he said I will do it outside of my natural range because Abram knee Sarah will need a restoration of the time of life follow me now in order to be able to bring forth the promised son but Sarah was not in a position to carry time of life again it assists to be with our she doesn't feel like any other woman feels on a monthly basis again so medically speaking physiologically speaking by lecture naturally speaking all that this man had come to say cannot happen and that was why as a human being she doubted and loved within ourselves but the one who came down was no ordinary man he didn't have to look at the construction of your face before he knows what is in your bank because some people as much they look great with their countenance but their mind is speaking something else some people are that deftly smart no matter how deafness Macchio ha you can be smarter than God so there's no pretenses before him he had his back turned to detent and guess what he hacks Abraham it didn't even turn back because it was with Abram a our business is that why did Sarah laugh even he didn't challenge Sarah immediately because in know Sarah as Noah torment to present him n as the one who could stand as an atonement for Sarah amen the circumcised man becomes the atonement for his own wife you can see that Abram made no defense Abram was come it's a maybe I didn't worry about that let's call the attention of Sarah Sarah why did you laugh is I didn't laugh that was enough to cause the death of Sarah instantly do you know why she said it to the face of God that you lied that would look like a blaspheming but thank God for hey bruh ha thank God for the Lord Jesus Christ if we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us now what cleanseth means constant atonement you know the prophets that God doesn't even see you he only hears your voice when it looks to see you is his Jesus amen and that is why you can never be faulted before him because you are represented before Christ before God by your sacrifice and this sacrifice was examined totally from the outs of critics to the outs of the supporters the verdict was the same we found no fault in him the people of the earth found no fault in him in L they found no fault in him in heaven they found no fault in him that is right it became the perfect sacrifice and the captain of your salvation so if your sacrifice is not faulty you are not faulty it doesn't give you lessons to live anyhow amen because if you have truly accepted the sacrifice it changes your nature it changes you from denomination to the wedge it changes your habit it changes your desire sin cannot come to you by desire it might come as a mistake but not as a willful desire when you are still a willful sinner you have not accepted the sacrifice Oh glory to God are you seeing the beauty of atonement this is why the Prophet pronounced the bread as a sinless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ always standing pure the Prophet true challenge is that in your face I may not be perfect amen but in the face of a who matters I am more than perfect because I am blood wash I am sin free I am guilty free that is what the blood of jesus crisis a generation of people upon unseen can never be imputed they are the blessed of the Lord that's what my scripture says so it's a name you loved but don't worry don't mind we won't argue about that I know what you did the Bible says she was afraid then God threw a challenge is anything too hard Church of the Living God I'm asking this morning in the face of your Downton problems or the challenges you are facing in the face of that debt crisis is anything to add for the Lord the answer was no 10 the answer is still no now because is the same yesterday today and forever you love him it's an I will visit you according to the time of life amen if the most visitation according to the time of life that means that with Sarah as lost by menopause let me come a plane must be restored for there to be a restoration of that there must be a restoration of youth amen there must be a restoration of the stream of life and look you've got to assess this friend because the Prophet said what God was using Abram and Sarah to demonstrate is what is going to do to every sons and daughters of a bruh old age is not our final reward eternal youth is the final reward of the believer but that youthfulness is not by this time body whether we are life or we are gone before it comes there will be a change of the body they are big glorification amen and in that body there will never be an old man this is what we come to the house of the Lord to connect from where we are to where we should be because we fell from somewhere but tell it to the righteous this morning they are be returned glory to God so if there must be a visitation according to the time of life there must be a restoration of those things and that was too much for Sarah amen it's been too much for them for a while but let me tell you this morning God will never visit the bright outside of the time of life I will explain it amen now the time of life was explained by the Prophet in two ways he used the 28-day cycle of woman you understand what I'm saying to explain the time of life but that is one amen and I will come back to heat because even that as the nature speaks of our supernatural visitation today who will come to eat then he also explained time of life as a cycle in which God does his things it was talking of Zechariah and was the name Elizabeth he said then knew God gave them a very proper charge who become a messenger but they were so sober and such because they know that according to the time of life that we never lived to see that boy get into his ministry so that is not speaking of the transience death cycle of a woman now it speaking of that cycle that time at which God will bring his purpose to pass so these two things are similar in nature and they are interwoven and that is why I am speaking of the time of life in that time of God now for you to understand where we are going it is not everybody or every woman who sees what you call a period that can conceive even though medically speaking that is the basis for conception is that right if she could see a period it's a sign that she still agates eggs to be what to be fertilized but we have a whole lot of women in the world today who had no problem Ganic illogically amen who as their heads every month and when the eggs are not you know you know met with life they become pasta tossed blood is all right that's what they explained to us but we still have a lot of them a marriage and trusting God for children and medically which are the tests they said there was no problem in their life there was no problem with a brother there was no problem with the sister and yet the child is not coming so meaning that for a human being that time of life cycle is not enough for anything to happen that time of life must come into the time of God are you catching it the superior Trainmen is the time of God because until God's appointed time that time of life we always fill you so if you said I went in I conceived I had my baby I consider again I have my baby you were a venire conception because it was God's time for hitch are you cutting it and I wanted to understand these principles because that is also the spiritual principles with which God has dealt with his bride in these last days if you can catch this you've caught 60% of the message amen you might be able to experience time of life but until it comes into that time of God conception will never take place that is why you see every couples they've done every test that is possible under heaven and every test at vindicated that there was no problem and yet they couldn't have a charge lets them not fresh let them not worry nothing is actually wrong with them let them not allow the devil to work them off and keep them in anxieties because anxieties will never allow them to see the purpose of God anxiety we make them miss that time of God for their lives let me say this there's actually no Baroness with God's children listen to me the whole thing is only wait until God's time said they said there is nothing wrong with me and yet I'm burning you are not buried amen tell it to that sister she is not barren it's just that that time of life must come into God's time let me prove it to you more radical Sarah saw that time of life all our years that is why the Bible could say is cease to be with her are you following simple Scripture she was enjoying that time of life but it came to a point that it never appeared again which shows to you that that is not as important as the time of God so don't keep your eyes on the time of life keep your eyes on that time of God yes the season for everything God does until you come in season you will fail I prove it to you so you will understand what time of life is time of life is when God activate is Popish and they won't do it until the time he has appointed for each human so time of life actually is time of God it ceased to be with Sarah and as far as God is concerned there was no problem I thank God the prophet described in Abram for us as far as Abram was concerned there was no problem is that he told the doctor the one who promised me can never fail so menopause shouldn't be a problem to you no condition should be a problem to you amen if it's a condition brought by fallen nature doubts that condition deny that condition because it can never be greater than the promises of God it says to be with her Peyman and she was hopelessly hopeless but when God's time came in Genesis chapter 18 is that I am now ready to visit according to the time of life so this visitation is God's timing amen and God knew that Sarah needed that time of life even if is just to be restored for once in other to prepare are to receive see amen is anything too hard for the Lord but why they did not happen when she was a lot younger it was in God's time a new covenant Elizabeth and Rebecca and Zachariah couldn't have had John the Baptist earlier than that time they had him do you agree with me do you agree with me of what use will be a foreigner who will be almost dead before the one who is to foreign comes there must be contemporaries they must meet themselves here when this endtime foreigner Jesus Christ our Lord came the Prophet told us it must be on earth at the time of Revelation 10 7 amen because it must be a concept in Misaka contemporary ministry with the one whom he is for running amen how can I introduce an abstraction bin to you amen there it must be here to us declare behold the lamb of God that carried away the sin of the world amen the Prophet told us when the mighty angel amen which is going to have one leg up on the head and one leg up on the water when nothing will fulfill he said the aptly seventh angel must be here amen they must have a contemporary ministry because one must introduce the other so William brand couldn't have comma edge of this time because is the 1/2 in produced Christ is the one to tell us and it was our Lord up there no one could've done that before the love of God the Korea tradition of the world John and Jesus must be contemporaries so was Elizabeth Barron Erin it's deep she wasn't barren hallelujah she was our time of life was also was only waiting for our time in God let her be an encouragement to you you know I'm stressing this Satan we always want you to heart outside of the time of life or we want you to invent a Reviver outside of the time of God Moses looked at himself the professor at 40 I felt is got to go by the business right now it must be done Amon it never waited for God's timing and he launched a Dutch revival but what did he produce death of only one Indian all these military training and skills and everything of Moses achieved only one Egyptian anytime you take the matter upon yourself your achievement will be one Egyptian get from me and this is your one Egyptian you will not even wait be able to wait to defend your victory you will run away hallelujah because you are trying to invoke time of life outside of the time of God you don't get conception you don't get Reviva just by your ability to produce eggs or to produce gems amen when that informs the conception it's because it was God timing to do a service inside the will of God timing is one of the Kadena thoughts the Prophet taught us Moses means that timing even though he knew he had a revelation and it was correct he was sent to do the job it was a correct revelation by usually the one who promised Israel the one who promised Abraham in Genesis 15 according to the convenant he said deliverance will come after 400 years not before when you do your mathematics very well Moses was trying to bring deliverance before 400 years because if we spend if we sent spent fund 40 years running away amen and Israel eventually came out at 430 years take 40 years from 430 that was three 90 years if God has allowed Moses to succeed at that time in started it will have broken the scriptures but you see how powerful it is that God watches over his word to perform it to the letter [Applause] he wouldn't do under it wouldn't do over it must be exactly as I said is that after 400 years some people are challenging that is a founder yes but they came Authority as a go back and read your Bible I didn't say 400 years is there after four zero one is after four zero four ninety-nine is even after so for 30 years is perfectly in line what that word says is the funda must be accomplished then after eat something can take place Moses attempted it at 390 years Gaza uh-uh so you will think it's God's Reviva why is the devil you see that believers are seeing the devil beyond the bad man who just who is just can't Icarus we know the devil is one of the closest ally is it so close to the light and yet there is no light in him it works around the boundary of the truth and yet there is no truth in him until you see the devil like that you have missed him you see the reason why the professor the greatest light I was ever told as a 9910 2.9 truth in age did you catch that so what is light by the way 99.99% truth point 0 0 1 lie arrow makes it what a lie this is my friends we don't believe prophecy or any truth that has imagined of hero is that least when you look at this is the present of it came to pass the 40 percent can be forgiven we shall not forgive it because it is not 40 percent that proves is the devil oh praise the Lord you love him this morning so 3 90 years God said no that period is going to accomplish that was why God kept him away he was too excited to be catch in Egypt he probably will have attempted another one amen so God kept him away for 40 years amen by the time we came back the people were also ready at that time the brethren went already but by the time we came back everybody was ready so the revival was universal I am feeling the way my brother is feeling because God has sent DiSpirito supplication he has sent a spirit of revival so is catching fire on you is catching fire Amy is catching fire in everybody and all of us are ready so also in this end time let me say it without fail a lot of us are trying to manufacture Reviva you will fail and it is not God's let me tell it is not God's move it is pure Satanism is that this is deep I see yeah I know it is deep but you got to receive it say why is there no revival in the back well then who told you there is no revival in the bride hey that sounds like the devil to me hmm people who feel they're very spiritual want to agree with ish so where's general Rivera you know what you are doing you are trying to define Reviva by by what you have seen in the Pentecostal which is proven dead by there to be what to be false to be Arrangements to be fraudulent moves you can only be deceived if you have a seed of deception in you but let me tell it to the blood of Christ this message of the hour the professor is the program of God it's not yours is not mine Amen I didn't make myself what I am today you did make yourself what you are if he brought you this far it will take you truth for those of you are concerned about the future of the message save your worries the future of the message is secured it was already secured from eternity before we came to time God is not having one day sleepless night over the continuity of the message oh yes it is you defuse that you want to have good at the harvest sleepless night oh yes brother there is nothing wrong with the future of the message how about all these things people are doing they are things data to be it is the our fortunes and jimba to arise amen and gents and Jambres will always rise up to attack the truth amen but it wouldn't change the truth it didn't change Moses it didn't change Aaron even though their activities and the pressure of Egypt was affecting the Brethren but it never changed those who had the mission it wouldn't change you and I we should be having this we should be having that we should be listening that Hotel you dead is not be enraged sick I've been healed I'm seen hands data with a straightening out obscene honey has disappeared absent two more disappeared some of you are witnesses of it absent people upset people received their children absence and rise up and acts foreign with data from plane and Austin's are taking place they are in line with God's program do you hear the words is what the program is the professor attitude that we have received we have got to drop down he told us of the thought pool is said that which we have worked in this small measure him n friends although since you have seen RT writes children they the fish they received back life thus curious that was poking into existence they are all worked in what small measure the profits that we are slowing down waiting for the time to use it in a greater way you know why because in this race the Antichrist lacks the power it lacks the provocation as at that time of the Prophet amen to bring to full effect all the powers and glory of God we'll do it this is what it looks as if we have run too far ahead amen and the professor we will slow down waiting for them to catch off he said when they catch up watch what I'm fixin to tell you he told you what that Todd pulled damn you know God was releasing beats by beats in her in Egypt amen the BT was religion was much in the power of Pharaoh the BT was religion was matching amen and when God saw that Pharaoh was evil ready to bow kudani with a you can't you can't repent I promised Abraham I will bring his people had my mighty hand you need the wickedness the level of wickedness that we provoke the greater power so God is allowing the Antichrist to come to ripening is allowing this world to come to a level of decadence is allowing them to come to the earth to their most atrocious form of Sodom before he unleashes greater power otherwise it will be it will be a situation of using sledge Amato Killa fly for those of you are crying forever that is the answer to your cry don't manufacture one many of you are trying to manufacture and it is backfiring you are given professes that are failing you are working up emotions that are not working it is not your program when you behave like that you are taking the program out of the hand of God you are sin is too slow or is too late I love God tour on this program he's never Ledger's never gone brother Brahms I live a simple Christian life and watch more followed they are big grid unfolding friends hey man before you can come to such out of demonstration you must become the message you are to demonstrate amen it will not be cotton the message is again it to be caught in yourself come to a situation that you have power of his power what of his watch you are no longer saying does say the Lord it becomes according to my watch because the Prophet said when we are quoting we will be caught in ourselves Alleluia word of his word life of his life he said in fact she is and when the bride come to such a level of ripening watched the power of God and it's a promise friend it will come to pass but don't allow the devil on that the guise of being spiritual amen take you out of the blessing he did it to Sarah hey man he said this promise may be Abraham if you take agra maybe that promise may be true that way God would bring his promise to pass God doesn't need your help it doesn't mean resistance there is a timing for everything when he promised after Sarah's proposal wanted a gas they got an Ishmael they got a match they couldn't undo themselves they caught a wild man who's and will be upon every nation until today the Scriptures he fulfilling you've got them all everywhere you've got the book where I'm Zuccotti his who absolute God all this we as the orientation from from the descendants of Ishmael we will not fail to tell that regardless of who feel of an edge is too short to you and high that does say the Lord can never fail Ishmael was not a product of God's promise it was an attempt of man to come outside of God's program it was an attempt of man to work outside of God's timing for life and let me bring - God is a great farmer isn't it he gave you plants in season cultivating season spring season maturing season and a vest season is all right is all right but is God limited by those seasons can you not do everything in one day didn't approve we can do it when - five loaves a day man and a blessed and five loaves fed 5000 amen and seven loaves fed 4000 the professor do you understand what happened there within few hours which was planted within that hour with grew up with was cultivated with much worth with was arrested which was processed into flour which was built and it became bread all within split second in the hand of master Jesus only believe within split seconds Dustin's happened but this same one who can do it in those split seconds decided to give you seasons no matter how far science became they can never do what Jesus did they were still each day's my brother they will still need time my sister they say ok let us shot let us shorten you know the length at which misurkin matures from 9 months let's make it three to four months and what it is succeed in producing by that high bridge and what did I brought death it is the cause of all kind of genetic aproblem as you have today diseases an affliction because people are not ready to which according to the time of life and so spiritually speaking if you don't wait on God's timing for his program you only dead hand that if ever you think you want to invoke we only bring death nothing more nothing less do you see why some of the things the prophet knew before a preach marriage and divorce listen to my church the Prophet our understanding of marriage and divorce the fullest understanding at least three years by his own testimony before a procedure or two years the fullest of it revelation came when the sins were opened a man but God has been touching it for the Prophet and has been putting the puzzle together a man by led 63 and 64 had the complete revelation but why did he not British it was waiting for God's timing to bring that blessing because I said if it never waited for God's time it will do more harm than the good it was intended for are you catching it so time of life must be in that season of God's time in other to be a blessing now let me tell you charge the revealed mysteries and the blessings we have today do you know that Daniel saw it is the a doubt on that do you know that John saw it Daniel saw it it was forbidden to write John was allowed to write but he was forbidden to explain it was coming gradually Amen why God told him leave it till the time of the end is that Daniel you will go to your place don't worry what you have seen that I didn't allow you to write or author Israel as already bless you you will go into thy Lord is about the enter in the end time knowledge shall increase and Papa we run to and fro looking forward knowledge but in that time the wise shall watch understand so why didn't God allow it to be preached it must wait till God's timing did you get it - the hassling judge hallelujah the reason it wasn't given was because it must wait till cost Timon so time of life must be watched must be in that time of God in order to produce a blessing hallelujah let me begin to random by this when you take a woman's time of lifecycle of 28 days you will see a blessing in here they say for some women it could stretch to 35 days cycle does what science edge but the most normal is 28 days and the wonder prophet mentioned was 28 days now inside this 28 days there are only seven days in all that a woman can conceive if he stretches to 35 days cycle it could extend to ten days for conception are you following but I'm going to adopt the one the Prophet adopted 28 days amen because he has a reason for their adoption now this seven days inside these seven days three days are the most important it could fall to the beginning it could fall to the middle it go for to the end but because life could survive inside a woman for few days if he had an encounter with Mel within seven days that these three days are inside there is a possibility for what conception because the revelation the egg producing days of a woman in those seven days are just three days so if life was waiting before the egg drops their life that was waiting for that egg could survive two days if within two or three days egg drops that woman can conceive if it's in the time of God for her to do it and if the egg drops the eggs can also survive a day or two so if life comes after the egg drops it is still possible for conception to take place so all this drama of twenty-eight days can only be blessed within seven days by a three-day event did you catch that so the entire 28 days or a month of a woman's life look forward to only seven days amen so we can say seven days is the time of life season we are conception can technology if it's in that time of God or if it is God's time for that life to be made manifest upon the earth are we together is that clear to you alright let's bring it back amen do you know how the redemption plan of the brides of Jesus Christ the gentle bride of Jesus Christ we're just in seven days it was a seven day or seven dispensation aplan did you get that a dick a minute dispensation in God's economy so I'm preaching the scriptures amen amen when you say the day of the Lord the day of the Lord tell me when I sat on your Monday it's a period of God's dealing are you catching it so these seven days amen God was using nature is why the Prophet said I preached by nature I will do my preaching by types and by shadows amen I've just told you now that what happened the three angels that came down Abram and Sarah they were shadows hallelujah let's begin to fix the original Apostle Paul said amen they're without us cannot be perfected now II thought that the program we held in his own day is a right that was why feels like they were the capping of all things not knowing that God still has some six more days after the death of Paul of Ephesus amen so we are the one who rightly and fitly said today because we are in the final day the seventh day the seventh age Amen if you are still confused about the days let me put it back to you the professor the several feast days of Israel is a type of the seven Church edges how does an H become other say they become an age those are spiritual language languages are you following so it's a this day that we are living in because it is the day that fitted perfectly at the end amen it is the seventh day after number seven you go back toward to the beginning again Enoch was the seventh from Adam amen Enoch was one who took the rapture amen and that is our time we are the servants from the second Adam amen so this is the age that would take the rapture so we are the one actually owns the scripture day without us and not complete we are the perfection of the bright building of the Gentile hitch congratulate yourself Alleluia so we've got a seven days every other day look forward to these seven days this is my brother Brahm in the message horizon of the Sun he said that program is between the E and the Shi the program of redemption he is the Lord Jesus Christ she is you and hi-brite and his bridegroom Alleluia now it was only on this seventh day that the shadow of Genesis 18 perfectly came to his fulfillment three angels came down as usual amen looking for who for the Abraham's group again amen Abram who had suffered and you know buck would are not so many persecutions you know of doctrines you know mind pollutions and battles was wondering what to do it came up for a fresh air is fresh air to please by coming out of the door allowed this year you know Lassa Lassa if you are not spiritual you come follow me no don't look lost Amen Philadelphian age and age before lord isaiah was the age of open door is that right by the time you came into la decisión age it becomes the edge of a closed door they shot oh ha sight they shot Christ outside he said build I stand at the door whoever we get a fresh air most come out of the closed ossification the church was becoming a suffocation the pressure was getting so much that was where why you had that's great noise comment from among my people so you came out for watch a breath of fresh air and when you came out guess what you saw you saw the angels coming again ah just like Abram saw three men by window they were three michi even know they were three I mean to say I thought you a catcher dad I can see them resistant at every spiritual people amen even though they were three yet the Abraham's group knew who is on God who is on messenger was is that right the new era robot wasn't sent to them the new Billy Graham wasn't sent to them they got a message no doubt and their message as a project and their message as a way it will be disseminated and their message as is own audience that it will attract but then know that there must be a peculiar messenger meant only for the Abraham's group and never in history since the time of Abraham have we had messengers with Vietnam and in H am than in this day it wasn't a coincidence it was to announce the closing of time but Graham Graham came with six letters six is the number of man amen but there was another who came with several letters and ending ham halt so that wasn't a coincidence that was Branham that was the one sent to the Abraham's group Abram has seven letters Brom has seven letters hallelujah they all came out at the same time amen one to the Evangel occurs one to the protestin some fundamentals and one to the bright of Jesus Christ we know our messenger brethren amen the risen brother Brom couldn't prosper so much with them despite the fact that it was one that did the greatest number of miracles and the highest level among them was because it wasn't sent to them it was sent to us when people are annoyed that you quoted brother Brown or you are quoting him don't fight them it's possible that it wasn't sense to them amen but orders only was sent to it is not a sacrilege it is a joy amen to coach the message because when we are caught in the message William Brown never represented himself he brought the Ministry of Christ the reincarnated Ministry of Jesus Christ but to you and I so what did that messenger said when it came to Sarah is that I will visit you according to what that time of life so if this messenger a man will come and is this to fulfill that Genesis 18 to you and I what is it to announce to the bride I will visit you according to that time of life why didn't that visitation come before now because it was in time amen the visitation of time of life must be in the time of God that was right Daniel could not have done it amen don't worry Oh sir brother okay that was right Daniel could not have done it that was right John could not have done it it has to take a william branham to do that for you and i in the season of god's time and watch those three days again in these last seven days amen justification dropped sanctification dropped amen baptism of the Holy Ghost dropped in order to do us in other to materialize and reproduce Christ again on two feet did you catch that Christ must be reproduced again on two feet the world must become flesh amen that Christ that walk through the streets of Jerusalem must be expressed perfectly in the body of some people and that is the reason for the three days amen so justification came sanctification came it dropped a life amen now before those realized a skin efficient age started as watch if it's an age started as a great light but don't forget that lights couldn't retain itself is that a dwindling only when it came to the middle age the what age there was no more light again almost it was almost complete darkness did you catch that so if the edges of the Gentile ended at that time nothing much was achieved it shows that we started and we degenerated are you catching it before there to be a generation again hallelujah for there to be an ascension again for there to be a rapture like it was before a fizzle started with the rapture of Christ under sense they are must beat these last three days otherwise Christ will have lost in his arrest amen you see why the professor is the Alpha and what Omega what he planted what is
