cast out all religious spirits all unbelief all kind of contrary spirits and enticing spirits upon the lives of your people may they be free from it father as the word come forth but the spirits and the philistines back up lord as you promised they would in jesus name i ask it and as we approach your word tonight we pray a blessed interpreter to our hearts and confirm it with signs wonders and miracles we ask in jesus name amen and amen you have a prayer request we'll take after the service but at this time we want to turn your bibles to matthew 19. of verse 16 to 22. saint john chapter 5 verse 36 to 40 and sin john chapter 10 verse 23 to 27. i want to read three portion scriptures tonight matthew 19 reading from verse 16 and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life he said unto him why call his daughter good there is none good but one that is god and if thou will enter into life keep the commandments he said unto him which jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not come with adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not be a false witness honour thy father and thy mother and thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself and the young man said unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what like i yet and jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me and when the young man heard that sin he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions reading from sin john 5 i want to read from verse 36 this is jesus speaking but i have greater witness that of john for the works which the father had given me to finish the same works that i do be a witness of me that the father had sent me and the father himself which had sent me had borne witness of me you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his sheep and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he had sent him you believe not search the scriptures for in them you think ye have it in a life but they are they which testify of me and you will not come to me that you might have life our last scripture is something john 10 and we want to read from verse 23 and jesus walked in the temple in solomon's porch then came the jews are wrong about him and said unto him how long does thou make us to doubt how long he'll keep us in suspense if thou be christ tell us plainly and jesus answered them i told you and you believe not the works that i do in my father's name db would they be a witness of me but ye believe not because you are not of my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me may god bless this world you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the lord jesus told them direct he said you are not my sheep i know who is a shepherd but you are not my sheep hallelujah because my sheep hear my voice and they i know them and they follow me oh glory to god my sheep my sheep hear my voice and the voice of god is a thunder so my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me so i have a title tonight the true believers follow the life wherever the life goes that's a direct quote and that's what i use in our title i think i mention it on sunday but that's a direct quote the true believers follow the life wherever the life goes that is what the following oh glory the life now i don't believe that god sent a lasting message for us to be right in this spirit and wrong in doctrine i don't believe that it's good to be right in spirit that's what we want and that's what we should be when you're wrong in spirit that's cuckoo it doesn't matter what you teach what you preach what you say what you believe your spirit off but you want to be right in spirit and write in doctrine okay so you ready tonight all right saint john 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god this is logos and elohim right all things were made by him and without him was not anything me that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men oh glory to god where the life was in him and that's why jesus told them direct you wouldn't come to me that you might have life oh glory to god so he's one man i am the way the truth and the life oh glory to god so the pharisees can get light the sadducees can't give life but he could give life because he is the life itself do you believe that tonight oh glory to god thank you lord praise god so the prophet was saying here in the day when the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come through this when the son of man will come down in human flesh to unite the two together the church here we go has to be the word because he is the word and the two unites together and to do that to bring this united it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man so the son of man has been revealed but it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not the clergyman is the son of man oh glory to god hallelujah praise god it will take a manifestation of the revealing of the son of man all glory to god so what he is saying there's a time of the revelation of these things being made known that's in the seals but there comes an hour when there will be a manifestation of what has been revealed and we are moving into that hour now where we are actually walking in the vision of the prophecy itself we're not prophesying you're walking into the vision of what para manham saw by vision oh praise the name of the lord praise god do you believe that notice at in the pentecostal age to the literary age to the western age uh it'll be the same thing to this pentecostal age notice at the opening of the seven seals revelation 10. the full word is to be born into manifestation again who knew that it's not just the word the word was lost through the ages you had to go and get guard it up tie up the loose ends to get the full word to be under the seven seats like the bright message and that word has to be born into manifestation do you hear a shout in the house oh glory to god you mean this word have to come to maturity he prophesied that the son of man will be way over again and what it is the full word come to maturity handled with signs wonders and miracles oh god another wavin all glory to god the son of man came and waved over them promises they went into the upper room and they were filled with the holy ghost god send back son of man again and wave every promise to bring forth the adoption the perfection the manifestation of the sons of every promise not one was held back every mystery was revealed that we could make it to the rapture he said the rapture in faith is laying in the messages because every mystery has been revealed reveal and put there as the word all glory to god so the mystery of your translation is already been revealed millennium reveal new city reveal going home reveal change of the body already revealed oh glory to god and we have to walk into a manifestation of the revelation oh glory to god do you believe that hallelujah let's say that again at the opening of the seven seals revelation 10. remember what he said the breaking of the seventh seal is found in revelation 10. to find out what that silence is about you had to go to revelation 10. to find out what the devil don't know you have to go to revelation 10. oh hallelujah so he said no what the full word is to be born into manifestation again and vindicated by the spirit of god in the full strength as it was here on earth full strength oh it wasn't half a son of man and it was decent man come back to reveal himself so what went out from the prophet's mouth wasn't that man trying something and given an exhortation it was christ what are you talking about first thessalonians 4 the lord himself is what descended to speak through this lasting messenger [Applause] that is not with confidence he could say say what the tapes say because it wasn't me saying it it wasn't he that was saying it it was god saying it there are certain things i can't say it better because it's just the word oh glory to god do you believe that all right now watch the word isn't us the world is in the summer condition the church was went into sodom like lot and his wife and i see there's a elected church somewhere in this world that is pulling out and set aside those things and the manifestation of god has attracted its attention within the last days it will take the manifestation of god to attract its attention what he said the bride had no revival as yet there have been no manifestation of god to steal the pride why am i so excited why suppose because i know this is promise or who who feels have it already like them is has any devil come to test that is when these storms come to test that it's because you see everything you build have to be tested you know if you just said come we could we could wear flag put flag shout ball say we are it and everything else but when the tests come we'll show what what was already built what do you believe that this is beautiful he said watch the shock has give fought its strength unto the seed it went on out it was a good shock but it served its time see it is the word bride of the word groom so when shock time is over shock time over you shall and protect the bride for for many many years and the shock pulled back the shock just pull away that the bride get room to get right man mature and the hot july sun trials and tribulation to ripen you out it's not just a test you're ripening your faith inside of you and when god strip you on the heat start to take you and the greenness had to get baked out then you finally see if you still believe the word devil tree don't get back up you still believe the word this happened that you still believe the word oh glory to god you believe that word you have a perfect faith in what god said hallelujah know the devil no he can't move you off at that because you see the devil lose fallen angels to try to get the right off the word because once you're off the word you are entitled to enticing spirits you hear what i said once a man a church anybody going off the word lion spirits enticing spirits fallen angels backing that man and church up yes now i'm not talking about devil in party i'm not talking about devil outside beaten pan and carnival i'm not talking about that kind of level i took my one thought in the bible i don't know the one with the long dress i talked about the one who said they believe this message that is ever talking about people are saying they love but abandonment all that in love will be with him and whatnot don't buy that you know do you say they love me keep my commandments you don't feel your love but i love the message everyone says nice zero and you're making it because you love the message you're loving messenger it's not that tender he said hear me but i'm tabernacle you have to apply the token he's not to talk about it talking he said he talked not to be displayed does not talk to him there's a real thing there's a live thing there is an appliancing let's continue wow wow wow wow oh glory to god when they come and say go up and you have to say and um joseph i'd say isn't there one more this year we have my car but he always talking against us we can't handle them at all and when mike says six say something good tell me i'll see i will see what god put in my mouth but the whole minister's association saying the same thing like them i go and pray and find out what god tell me well you know where is bishop saying and on a certain channel i go hear what god tell me when he started giving me what he said going up he said but i see israel scattered like sheep you see that district prospector walked out and smacked him in the mouth and said where where where the word of god where the spirit go when he when he went over to me watch the arrogance i have ministry all these years wait wait go tell me but he's praying live long time because once it have prophetic utterance every ministry have to subject itself to that so no man can be above the prophet he's an intellectual idiot if you think he above the prophet when the prophet is a star in the right hand of god so every minister every ministry have to subject himself to the prophetic utterance that came out of the mouth of that elijah prophet william marian rana so we could judge every minister by that word let a man move try every spirit we have the authority to do that no man is above the word man is any absolute you know much man playing god my lord uh thank my clients for saying this to me he said god never did any time have a group of men to run his church it has always been the holy spirit that's his duty that's what he's here for that's what god sent him for unlike the other day but as i say people who want to criticize and whatnot they don't have to watch this they don't have to view us they don't have to take us on this is our suffering church we preach and we feel led we don't preach as people feel we're not preaching for others we're preaching here to help you because this is what i am responsible for and the ministry he is responsible for oh glory to god i have no international right to hold up and build no no god give me now you know who have that god bless them but i have to account for this group here and that's why preaching too that i could push to the kingdom because of a word when the power of this church rises i have to anoint that i have to believe that i have to claim that if they have cancer i'd have q minor what kind of thing among us and that blindness that kind of thing i have to i have to claim those things because i don't want doctor come on one doctor jesus to come oh glory to god our church could be defeated with jesus christ walking in it what press effect in what press could affect a church he said there will be a church with jesus walking here the shout of the king will be in the camp that is dusty at the lord that that dear fail nobody could cancel that rome itself two hundred thousand dozen devils can't cancel that prophecy there will be a church in the last days and jesus christ will be walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp that's a direct dossier the lord prophecy that cannot fail i feel inspired tonight oh god let me say it again if you can get it good there will be a church but jesus walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp hopefully that church gonna be defeated think about it hallelujah all that church go get back up think about it now if i'm in charge we will be defeated if i run in the show we will get lick up we will get pressed out yes if i am in charge but if jesus the head the cap the lord himself god take the prophet he ain't take the lord himself fellow he didn't take that mighty angel you know the one with the seventh seal the one with his he ain't gone back in him he said the angel of the lord is unearthed now right now tonight fixing things are wrong for the coming of the lord and the seventh seal is connected the seven thunders is connected to the coming of the lord so he is here tonight he is fixing tonight oh glory to god he has to be here to fix things are wrong i can't fix it he has to fix it it is his church upon this rock i will build or give the lord a shout tonight [Music] upon this rock not to yoga bill until god says jesus i will build my church and the gates of hell including 200 thousand can't prevail against it i had to include them because they must bond at the river euphrates they must tying up people all along they banged the holy ghost for two thousand years nice and feast of the trumpets but the evening time message is to lose the holy ghost somebody shall god lose the devil loses demons and god going to lose the holy ghost because when the enemy come in like a flood the spirit of god with a standard oh god you got to miss tired tonight oh hallelujah glory to god when the enemy coming like a flag spirit raises the standard you've always been the holy spirit that's his duty that's what he's here for that's what god sent him for he will teach you he will guide you into all truth i will show you things to come and reveal these things take things of minds and reveal it to you not seminary as he said but the holy spirit that's the teacher but we try to adapt man to take the holy spirit place we try to adopt sitting offices in the church to take the offices of apostle and prophet and so forth but god set the gifts in the church but we took men and made them gifts oh so there's a fightful in the body and a fightful out to the body the fightful out of the body is what people pick and make them gifts but when god said what god said no man could unsaid no man can't cancel i can't be fifo today and no for tomorrow that's his foolishness what god blesses bless what god curses curse what god says shock and shock what god says see the seed oh give the lord i shout tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah remember the bride goddess of all the life everything dries up you know whoa oh glory to god you know obama said there'd be no love left except among the elect you feel like you're buying chicken and chips and sandwich and sharing it out [Music] so people take men and made them gifts so all they could talk about the pasta and the pasta years ago god showed me that adoption have nothing with the people that's years ago donkey years ago that's why i do bother with the people adoption is strictly father and son so you can have 50 million people inside the church fifty thousand people into that is not gonna make the man adopted the man make the most perfect sermon that is not adoption adoption has to do with behavior it has to do with life life behavior oh hallelujah do you believe that tonight thank you lord thank you lord let's continue lucy wow so when when any man say where the spirit go you see you know what god said he let the devil go down and get among them yeah why because they were off the wood to begin with so wait a minute when somebody off the word there was a drop on them yes because they're off the word that's why under under under loose ends is spirits you have to want your life to conform with the full world because it's united unbelief with the full word of god is only in this message you'll come and do that because this message is the full word when you put your own belief in it are you ready trouble you know is a big demon coming and jumping up there it has to be a hundred percent word oh glory to god praise god praise god let's continue the more he said the two spirits working among alike right down through here one is the nomination the other one is the holy ghost you see denominational spirit is man's spirit with denominational spirit it binds the holy ghost it arrests the holy ghost the holy ghost can't move in that because the cabbage done on a doctrine teaching an idea so it banished and lock off the holy ghost now what the prophet said he said the seven angels come from eternity to gather the scattered word to tie back in the word to bring down the holy ghost so when the word becomes the conductor of the spirit is because everything lined up just right so god laid the planks and the pipes are the word to be the conductor of the spirit no longer just flesh but the word made flesh so the man himself become a conductor so when a man become a doctor the sermon itself is affected by the man and what he want to say dear is my spirit flowing freely because now we find a perfect conductor for the spirit to flow or give the lord a shout you will live to see that [Applause] let me say it again you would live to see that oh hallelujah praise god amen eve the reason like eve if stopped long enough to be deceived if she hadn't stopped there never been no receiving but he stopped and when she stopped there is where she got her decision instead of pressing on follow me close now the reason that eve was deceived and barabana made them say it together these words he said the reason eve was deceived she never kept the full word of god satan quoted it to her but he never told her all the truth neither does his denomination see but she said long enough to get part of the word and didn't take all the word and that is what the matter today the sleeping virgin stayed long enough to get part of the word but not all the word the deceased church stayed long enough to get part but not all he said it knocks up your two tomb in his fullness so their full atonement wasn't applied to them which is the foolish version don't stay long enough to get part you want all oh glory to god all the word go hallelujah praise god hallelujah they received church says long enough to get part of the word but not all the word and they were sincere and honest about it and eve was deceived isn't that right hallelujah praise god thank you lord thank you lord jesus hallelujah oh amen and there's another quote concerning my cayenne they and this is the next angle that he brought to that the man come with big horns you're gonna push back the enemy and so on like that and then my car went he said i want to ask you something which way did the spirit of god go when it went down to me when he man said when i come back i'll take care you say they come back at all god never spoke to me if you only come back go ahead and talk to me you say you will understand you'll understand when you're getting the cage out you under as a captive i seen god sitting on the throne he meant no listen and the host of heaven was gathered around him what was the matter his prophet had already said what is going to happen to ahab that wasn't elijah said that that was an anointed prophet that had the word of the lord thus said the lord my car said i seen all the whole heaven gathered around god in a great conference and they were talking one with another and the lord said who can we get down dear which one of you can go down and deceive ahab to get him out there to fulfill the word of god to get him shot who can we get the good on well the one was seeing this one that one after a while an evil spirit a lion spirit say i will go down and get in all them preachers 400 of them behind the pulpit with books with bible with tapes i'm a lying spirit i'll go down and get in all them preachers because they haven't got the holy ghost so they're off the world and they don't have the holy ghost so then they have access this the line spirits have access to them i say this way the lion spirit have access to them oh glory to god and then you have doctrines of devils that's in the bible you know devils have doctrine you know a little thing off here a little thing off here a little thing off here a man preaching off stuff you see this battle tonight you see what the bride have to fight up with man who believed part of the word they can't receive all the word oh glory to god your acts are pentecostal you believe your bible they say yeah malakai for nah whatever they believe they believe bad when you drop malachi 4 on them because i sent you the prophet they find a problem with that they steal the word oh glory to god in this message you quote revelation 10 3 and 4. 700 other voices they will tell about new york yeah yeah yeah yeah christ uttered them voices seven thumbnails after their voices no man no lies on it on us hallelujah this christ himself throw them thunders out christ himself unveiled himself he revealed himself to whomsoever you will i don't have to rest on some man's revelation the same god i revealed the paul have to reveal to us how to reveal to you you have to get your own revelation he said these divinely revealed mystery truths oh glory to god you have to get revelation revelations prevail in power all the church defeated and there's no prevailing power what kind of revelation you have revelation is power and you ain't got the power yet no glory of god revelation is power and holy ghost power air strike yet oh glory to god hallelujah muslims when holy ghost come upon that revelation thank you lord jesus hallelujah said uh them preachers haven't got the holy ghost he said that's the way it's deceived a prophecy a lie he said god said you have my permission to go and he went on got into those false prophets school train ministry and make them prophesy a lie it was a lion spirit working out the will of god oh thank you lord and byram they don't want to hear because they need darkness they want to follow a creed it has made them feel good i believe this you don't believe it that's something that they believe that you do have keep it but the true believer they're following the life wherever it goes oh hallelujah praise god there's nothing about myself let me continue disobedience that word disobedience failure or refusal to obey rules of someone in authority that would disobedience failure or refusal to obey rules of someone in authority disobedience is deliberately not doing what someone tells you to do or what the rule or law says you should do failure or refusal to obey rules or someone in authority that is what you call disobedience because you'll find out there's a spirit that work in the children of disobedience now notice something i wrote here this is not about believing now this is about following instructions if i tell you the red horse rider is he is he and the palos rider and the black horse rider that is information that is not instruction revealing the mystery of the sip and seed that can help you in your marriage that guy put nothing in the table right now that is information there's nothing to do with that but when the spirit come to give instructions which the spirit will come to you to try to guide you and lead you that is where you have to understand whether or not you are obeying the lord because in adoption he spoke about a good son and a troublesome one man doing what you want acting how we want he's a son but he's not coming into discipline he's not coming into order the other synonyms of disobedience is unruliness waywardness in discipline bad behavior misbehavior misconduct delinquency disruptiveness troublemaking rebellion defiance mutiny revolt lack of cooperation non-compliance awkwardness perversity contrariness mischievousness mischief ambitions i see that's the synonyms of this thing called disobedience and brahman said this now the two spirits one of them holy spirit the other one is the devil's spirit working in deception is that certainly where he's working you know working and how deception the people of the earth are now making their choice so you have to choose what mark you want because the end of the day is just two marks is that at least seven c you drop that mark on you for the rapture or you take some other seals and you're born for the tribulation you have to want that you have to know what you're going after oh glory to god the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for christ he is doing it by vindicating his word of promise to her showing it is christ the spirit if the finger is supposed to move in this age the finger will move if the foot is supposed to move in this edge the foot will move if the eye is to see same this is the i will see here we go listen to this word now the spirit of god as it grows into the full stature of god is the age we are now living in you hear that the spirit of god as it grows in the first stature of god for example only a prophet could have said this he said when you say you want to get closer to god what you're really seeing is you want to grow in god and when he reveal the statue of perfect man he show you i want to lord i want to get closer to you god give your faith i want to get closer to you lord he give a virtue you're getting closer until there is no more closer together when you see me you see the father and my father are one jesus prayed that one in us you are in you and you and me at that day so to get closer is to really grow hallelujah and what makes you grow trials testing tribulation and most of all time because time is what god unlocked for this thing called process and everybody looking very shortcut does the devil job to show you this shortcut by sharing something with isaac i said we were born in ignorance the world is ignorance knowledge is light but it could give you two different light yes the knowledge of good and evil so knowledge brings light because you're in ignorance that's why david said knowledge of good and evil god knows if you if you get this revelation here you'll be wise knowing good and evil like god now watch this here but the thing about it is that when you get placed on the road of knowledge you have to keep looking for the time you will take on to the tree of life because if you stick on knowledge alone it could guide you off plumb off because jesus said search the scriptures because they have the knowledge that have the prophecy that have the information search the tapes search the books in them you think you have life but you wouldn't come to me to get life so he was showing them having the books having the scrolls that was not enough here come the young ruler good master what shall i do to inherit it in her life he's taking my word he dropped the coats on him adultery he said are you doing this i i reading this message all the time i believe moses i believe the prophet of the earth hallelujah i i am this thing from a youth what luck i yet he had the books he had the tapes he's going to church he's a nice guy he's rich but when the word which is the reason of hebrews 4 12 begin to go beyond the bone and the marrow and go past his flesh go past his his christian behavior go past his good self and see the demon in his soul hallelujah he says get rid of that you have to sell no you might be rich in money might be rich and lost you might be rich in pride there may be other things you might rich with but you have to sell you have a price to pay in order to get stripped of that demon that religious spirit upon your life some people have to repent of the religious spirit they have it so long in this message oh hell too long in this message that all they get is that there's a shell over their life you need to come real authentic original or something else to connect with a reality inside of you a manifested reality you have to want that you have to hunger for that you have to thirst for that stop putting on stop acting get real all glory to god you want life he said they wouldn't come to me that they might have life oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah search the scripture search the text or who he's talking to people in church a long time pharisees who study the word them fellas lioness is pure and clean and whatnot and he ripped them through and said listen what you have is not life yes one time when jesus talking to them and jesus busted me before the fathers was i am he saw a father man in the wilderness and jesus under everyone dead i am the living bread if a man eat of me shall not die oh hallelujah oh glory to god you say you have light when i come and you reject this light you walk in darkness every time that person's perfect has come that person's impact is done away written once perfection is identified and you're going to understand where the believers walk into and following why the believers will move that way when luther drop his trumpet to the roman empire and shook up rome with a justice league by faith what did the true believers do they followed the life justification was the doctrine but the life oh glory to god they were justified by faith that was the thunder the devil couldn't understand they were still drinking beer they were still smoking cigarettes but they were justified by god because they followed the life of luther's message he caught the word not fully revealed he went and blast oh hallelujah praise god the catholic church buster churches opened a rejected dunk on a plague a seal to open mystery unfold word drop down messenger catch the mission that fully revealed went and called the elect and the devil clueless because the elect was called out by justification oh hallelujah luther dropped back into the ground and them justified people formed the denomination they formed the lutheran and the life moving on into sanctification and all them justified people it was good when luther was there it was good when that hour was there but when wesley come nothing could know more you need more than that or give the lord a shout we need more than we had 20 years ago in this message we need more than that to deal with what is and what is to come i hear shout tonight i am fighting for my life because i know where it's coming time i come i fight i can't do like his business as usual i can't do like oh it was a long time it's not come back a long time oh hallelujah believers what they're doing they're following the life hallelujah my god he said the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the whole spirit is doing this so that the people that believe god will be called to this chaos the devil's on holy spirit is here calling his church by the error as usual by a perversion of the word like he did at the beginning then he quote the scriptures in john 4 5. he talked about if you want to put it down the spirit of error so it's not just a text spirit you know a man saying a wrong texting or wrong information you know there's a spirit and error behind the teaching that the man is teaching off the word that's what's wrong with barely kind i forgive you there's a spirit of forgiveness it's not what you do it's how you do it that rich young ruler he did all the commandments but it's what was in him you guessing that tonight you see what god sees you see how god tells samuel i don't see like you see when you're looking to anoint one of your sons jesse when samuel says surely this is he illya come forward they let us a jessie a handsome son firstborn god said no no don't look at that don't look under the outward appearance look what's in the heart and always get some designment so then when he passed he recognized he had to look for the witness of the spirit now them fellas they know like brother isaac says saul without his only choice was already chosen to be paul with all his consent to be a messenger of the age and he's fighting on the christians but that name up there catching china that name was put there before the foundation your name can't change behave yourself oh glory to god gone and given up you god put your name on that book behave yourself come on your foolishness come into christ come into life you could do it yes you can yes you can yes you can you could really make it god had put us in this last year to be weak backstage you know striving on your existing and yes i come that you might have life and have it more abundantly you have to see the more abundantly life you have lighter it's the cup run it over oh give the lord a shout my cup it runs over i'm not frustrated i'm not fed up oh god eve never simply walk out willfully and say i don't believe in god no it was an error she believed and you say when she believed the error he said instantly the life left her one two her connection with the husband got broken that break up relationship one time he said once in life leave the church the connection of the believers are broken believers who want to fellowship and shake hand and hug one another they stop that now they're passing and crossing on the street because i believe this you believe that life gone so that is backed up yeah when the whole entire doctrine is executive catholic i believe your possibly created the holy mary the mother of god i just said you know i was a catholic but there was something inside of me so when them thunders hit me so i just don't be right all the catholic church rome couldn't hold me whom couldn't keep me i was the first person in my family at 12 to step out i was 16 17 at the time mother father all the lay hands the praying that they shall play they believe in mary joseph everybody that couldn't stop because i was a seed in that house and when the time come time come god said time i'll call to you do you fly out of this oh glory to god when i get baptized and i tell them it was few years but i got baptized in jesus name oh glory to god hallelujah yeah so therefore because my parents were catholic i was in the catholic system but i was never catholic so you feel all them believers them true believers under those men in the message them go stay there all the time you hear what we titled the messages the true believers will follow the life wherever it goes so a lot of men who feel they have their church locked down with their doctrine and teaching they don't understand the only messing in the human instagram they cut that receded than people so years ago i used to talk about these men and the people and the many people and now in prayer the lord amen don't say that and after the lord spoke to me i never say it again he's because the lord told me these are my people these are these are the words under these men and my whole picture changed so i recognize it's not the man it's god's people some of them men can truly be any pulpit but the people is god's people and after a while the lord himself when he begin to move he will deal with those men behind the pulpit because his bride will not be manhandled are all will come where the jubilee trumpet will sound for the bride around the world not just in trinidad train our own coming but around the world there will be a jubilee song for the bride you talk about freedom oh glory to god you talk about liberty i'm not talking about liberty i'm talking about you might be called by the glorious liberty of the sons of god freeing your spirit free in your soul freeing your heart freeing your mind are talking about free all glory to god in your inner being free from your complexes free from the sins of the past free from condemnation free from people's idea and thoughts about you free from your lies your oppressors free from demonic oppression and activity free from sickness free from disease free from unbelief oh glory to god free from your natural mother and father brother sister feel all at that whose son of mine know oh glory to god hallelujah [Music] glorious liberty of the sons of god we're going to exercise that before we leave here we have to do that here divine healer is not for the other side oh glory okay i feel like real knowledge right now let me say that again divine healing is not for the other side you don't need it across the air you need that here the devil's a liar tonight you are going to be healed you are going to be delivered you are going to be filled with the holy ghost [Music] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah we need a power now not over there we need that here satan satan never come out and say oh well that's not even the word of god satan lindsay leave that he admitted it was the word of god but he put his own interpretation it which god pleaded to him not to do it what does this do it makes a strong delusion for the people to believe a lie hallelujah i just wonder why people just standing against me that kind of way so when i say tune i mean no no no no small turn you know i'm being told to fight you people that want to like yesterday love you but you see it happening bible you know jesus hosanna hosanna blessed is eden next we crucify him same bunch of people and that devil hit them so they will crucify this week they love them next week they hate them and they don't even know why a delusion a spirit there's more spirit going on and you think there's more spirit influences than you think we have been churchified too long like if we have an automatic guarantee because we believe malachi 4. that means what the devil and all believes i'm is going no rapture no resurrection so we got to do more than this wish the entire church was here tonight we have to do more than that the spirit of delusion is of the devil devils now working in the children of disobedient we're not talking about people that type in coke and smoking dope we're talking about church people children of disobedience in church in this message the spirit of delusion is of the devil there is no working internal disobedience disobedient to what what the turn of the distillability was to the true word of god and then he quote the scripture ephesians 2 wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the ear the spirit that now worketh in the eternal disobedience churn of disobedience if the antichrist spirit begin in there in his infancy of disobedience what would it be when it heads up in the person of the antichrist oh my so but abraham said now remember christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows that the antichrist spirit would come into the church it's a spirit that comes into the church it had to come by any purpose and go down to the people and hear the purpose of that making the church the church and the violet making it look warm formal and powerless what did jesus say denying the power thereof heavy high-minded church people prophecy spirit them coming to fight the computer one yeah this bright spirit of faith and virtual knowledge this is the christ spirit here and every other spirit had to fight that that's the battle in the last days that versus everything else hallelujah denying the power to change your life and walk but yet they can argue and debate concerning the texts don't get tapped in that system scriptures don't get tapped in that follow him take up your cross and he said follow me because it's he that have the life not some man have the life he have the life yeah adopted someone will have seen him anybody that's true that's when they adopted that is christ veiling a man none of the man trying something that is christ veiled like spiller fire veil dies for the last day too but does god have to do that and said this is my beloved son hear him when that happened that's a different thing then called needles could send for that man and while you speak the word the holy ghost take upon hold upon the words and and baptize communism for the holy ghost that too coming do you believe that because all of that is part of booker acts and if that branch put forth another original branch if you're write another book of acts alpha will become omega we have to write another book of acts and i see nowhere in the book of acts when people was churchi fighter dr pew tied onto some church no god was alive among the people everywhere when god was with them and the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs and wonders and miracles and that is not pentecostal come on give the lord a shout that is sin mark 16 in action not in text not in talk not an explanation of breaking it down we don't need that to break down we need to see it in action oh give the lord a shout glory to god we don't need a man to come back and break this down the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs oneness and miracle he was interested in confirming his word the man preached the word god confirmed the word it was the word of god god confirmed would sign one of the miracles may god conform his word tonight to you oh hallelujah i miss you i could wrap up here he knows the devil knows if the people i want to take a slow walk around this one because when they see you walk slow your sleep and do things if the people gets the true revelation let me take every time not revelation true true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for that she can do what the church is what she stand for and what she can do that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army let's go deeper if they get a true revelation and there's a partner of the two spirits you see you can't follow if you don't know what you have to fight because if the wrong person come forward spirit wise and you follow that you're going off so therefore he said when they get the true true revelation of the two spirits working away in the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit that's important because have all kind of luciferian spirit dismantling too and could tell this and tell that and it's some hell it's not all these women really you know the spirits that know where they walk and talk however they go and come back and say well when they remember the bar and whatnot you know it's not god's spirit is lucy again is dancing jumpers anointing you know it's which doctors bear prisoner with spirit power you know you don't know i want to get into this thing i can't get anything like that that's a whole story by itself i don't want to go there yet are coming i'm coming are going down there months ago i wanted to get there yeah yeah religious praise message but you can't be taking unawares wait do you think johnson's intellectual freaks there was intellectual you know when moses dropped down that road pharaoh said john's jumping showed him there wasn't a dark art they was bringing a text you know i said oh oh we believe this you know they were bringing manifestation you understand what i'm saying that's what i'm saying you know you have to know what you're talking about when you go to them places in africa all about the places these heavy spirits one time barramundi some meetings and some rich doctor pelted some storm and it turned ripping off and the problem rebuked him and the storm going coming back and forth rebuke back and forth after obama's i bind you bind you strong man carry brook no story can be no storm no storm done i have no words to bring no storm hallelujah i'm talking about it you see men make a feathers right and and and and table float and all kinds of things they know imaginary power that's why you say you prefer to talk to which doctors but this texting belongs to my spirit realm that my jesus said you didn't come to me that you might have life you need you didn't want to text you better go be any text in he said by is there understanding any good spirit satan is powerless before her who he will definitely taught today and so on earth he says satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the github cannot prove against us but we reveal against them and we read this on sunday life system doesn't have life it's only god's word has life the systems are built around it it does not have life it is the word that gives life oh glory to god do you believe that then he said something have to come that cannot be denominated it's the entirety of the sea that's comfort oh glory to god the entirety of the life that endear has to produce itself again in the bride oh glory to god so let's just wrap it up here now this last great step he said now watch what came from jesus body water blood and spirit the elements that came from his body is what makes up his body hallelujah water blood spirit water blood spirit he said to make us bright because adam had his bride taken from his body christ has his bride taken from his body and when christ died there was three elements that came from his body water blood spirit justification to believe in water signification through the blood and then the baptism of the holy spirit then he dropped the bomb here he said now this last great step must come to perfection that the holy spirit has to live in that church so perfectly that will make the head and body unite together he ain't talking about no mysteries he ain't talking about no history he don't want no testimony he said the holy spirit has to live so perfectly nations come a place hallelujah glory to god amen he's a look at the four patriarchs isaac calling abraham election isaac calling jacob joseph perfection nothing against him abraham fate isaac love jacob grace joy perfection then he said what he said looter wesley pentecost then the capstone when the church and the word becomes the same oh hallelujah so then the believers that of the wesleyan church when the pentecostal broke they move on and they follow the life and when the life leave pentecost and come into this message by the prophet malachi 4 the elect of the pentecostal follow the life oh glory to god what life did brahma release it was the capstone life of jesus christ eventually perfection nothing against the bride nothing against you pregnant with that seed of jolly perfection it is god working his way out right under the nose of the devil god put a seed inside of you and that seed peeping his way out stretching his way out pushing his way out that's it will come out and bring a cap stone to a perfection bribe nothing against her justify that she never did in the first place you talk about faith you talk about a perfect fit for a perfect rapture oh hallelujah let's continue here notice the life that was in the stalk and tassel now ends up in the seed the life come true the original seed come to different processes then turns back to its original condition he said hallelujah i'm the happiest man in the world that god will let me see that notice the life that was in the husk in this talk in the tassel gathers up in the seed and the light that was in the stock one one went to make another justification made away for signification salvation made a way for the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come down imperfection and back to the word so once fire falls back today oh glory to god oh give the lord a shout let me just wrap up i'm the home stretch right here now stalk tassel pollen then husk then out of the horse come the original seed not a seed it was the life of the seed growing through this to come to seed oh so the word is really a hub a conduit a conductor of the very life the devil couldn't understand that because god was protecting the very life by the spirit of the lion spirit of the ox spirit of the man spirit of the eagle they were the guardians that was gardening life not the oil and the light unwind so when they killed the christians through the dark ages the devil didn't understand the seed was growing in the ground in the devil you understand that he was going to block this even going in the wrong he never let him go on any ground because he hit the ground have to spring back up oh glory to god because the law of god hit the ground come back up and when god said i will restore there's no going back there's no turning back because they was eaten down to the very stomp so when god started work of restoration it means that the bride will come to full tomb this bride no one brought a pregnancy oh give the lord a shout this child will not be aborted we on our way their bride will come to full term and the word will be born into manifestation in its full strength oh give the lord a shout to vindicates in mark 16. vindication john 14 12. vindicates in hebrews 38 that he's the same yesterday today and forever but pentecostal came out an organization then it turned to one it had to to make the husk the true word of life on it was on its way to the original gearing through the stages to the stalk so you could see your life your own life the history of your life that you were on your way to produce this thing so god take you through processes your life is not by chance you pass through hell high waters walk under conditions what for today is if you give up now you're dead if you're stuck no yeah come true but you have to go through all your processes for you to get where you're supposed to go because you're going to perfection that's the target that's the goal homie perfection perfection is that spirit that was before the word he said going back to that perfection which was elohim seven perfect spirits oh glory to god so this knowledge have to take us back to the tree of life if your knowledge and take it back there you're in trouble because that is what man fell from remember any garden with two trees knowledge and life oh hallelujah could you take a little more now watch tassel stalk castle house living they produce a holder they were a holder of a certain portion of the sea life but when they organized the life move out of it that proved by all history never an organization ever done a thing after organ it was dead the life was traveling on it was moving on so watch god his people is like a tree the life goes down up down but in the corner it goes up from the original and to the stalk tassel and husk and the thing that it passed through dies so it can't get back to you again so when a group a church is formed by an organizational spirit or denominational spirit the spirit of god can't get back in they block him out with decrees so when they block him also the elect and that group of church have to come out they have no choice it has no other road and have no other place for them they can't stay there they have to come out they have no choice because the true believer follows the life wherever it goes that god puts it in them to hunt for life and the life is in second peter one four through seven oh there is going to be a river and it's going to flow oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah give him some praises let's just hit this again stalk tassel husk and the thing that has passed you dies so it can't get back to you again what is it it's no use anymore it goes on to its perfection don't you see why he never used an organization he can't get back in it again it is dead but the life passed on one for another so after a while all they could rest on is their history not present tension the history of how it used to be what they had how much years ago because the life passed through i didn't move on and the true believer follows the life wherever it goes hallelujah glory to god hallelujah let me just finish here he said no watch but she is coming back again to the masterpiece the wonder bride perfected because she's part of that word that was spoken by him he will have a church without support or wrinkle it will not be connected to any kind of organization or any denomination that's a cursed thing it passed through those things but it will never be there notice the seed is coming up here brother that life is coming up not going back there is no more resurrection after this the life is coming up to go to its perfection oh you mean the life itself have to go to perfection yes because justification was a life satisfaction was a life after one of those was the life perfection is coming into the life itself oh glory to god is coming into the life itself hallelujah now remember no other church was he put out of the bible but there is nothing else the sculpture has got to go back to perfection again the word notice i hear the bomb have you read sunday when it comes forth it looks like the green or when the green light begins to leave the husk the green light let me say it again the green life when it begins to leave the husk watch to go to make the green he said the bride the husk opens up excommunicate the green what that's exactly what she did and when the seed begins to grow forward the horse puts it from itself then the life leaves all others to follow it that's the true believers they follow the life wherever the life goes oh glory to god hallelujah he said the holy ghost have been born at the river euphrates but at the doors of queens and dogmas that the holy spirit can't work in the church it was burned by these inaudible rivers for almost 2000 years but is to be loosed by the evening time by the even time message oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah i'll be close with this isaiah 29 verse 9 it says steal yourselves and wonder cry out cry they are drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink for the lord had poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep had closed your eyes and the prophets and your rulers and the seers had recovered and the vision of all is become unto you as words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that has learned he said read this i pray thee he says i cannot for it is sealed and the book is delivered to him that is not clear and said read this he said i can't because i'm not learned wherefore the lord said for as much as this people draw near to me with their mouth and with their lips to honor me and have removed their heart far from me and their fear towards me is taught by the perceptive men therefore behold i will proceed to do a marvelous work among these people even a marvelous work and a wonder for the wisdom of the wise men shall perish and the understanding of the prudent men shall be heared oh glory to god i'm finished so malachi 4 he brought this prophetic vision for the bride that revealed that the ministry of jesus christ will be returned back to the church oh glory to god not a man but the ministry of jesus christ oh glory to god i had some more stuff and cut off here you talk about the fifo ministry pouring the virtues to that perfection of the coming of the son of god begin to play something could you stand and worship the lord oh hallelujah glory to god that fightful ministry again would be the ministry of jesus christ regardless of what them brothers saying i'm just saying they think they'll be fightful and it's the fightful and they preach in a long time that is not what the prophet revealed he said the fifo ministry will be the ministry of jesus christ which should be the life added manifested confirmed he said when the capstone come they become vindicated sons and vindicate their daughters charity to burn the perfectness covering that man from head to toe not that devil moved till he says i see nowhere satan kingdom not even this thing at all is god moving like sparks of an anvil baptizing people he said baptism after baptism after baptism revelation after revelation after revelation power after power of the power that's what will be striking the church the church were so anointed he said 30 40 days that resurrection anointed gonna be on a bird the earth wouldn't be able to hold anointing oh glory to god hallelujah yes lord yes lord father god i pray in the name of jesus that your holy spirit with baptized the people mind and heart change your thinking lord and the attitude that they will ride over their trials and testings and see your glory and
