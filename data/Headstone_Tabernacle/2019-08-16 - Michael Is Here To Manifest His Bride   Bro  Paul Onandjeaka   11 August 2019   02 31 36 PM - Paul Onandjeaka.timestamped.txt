[59:42] brother who had really labored
[59:46] he's coming here was a battle I want to
[59:51] tell you a short testimony he was to
[59:55] come here and pretend was to come with
[59:58] him and the devil went unblocked
[1:00:01] that a change had not come by refusing
[1:00:06] him a little pass on his in his place of
[1:00:09] job and you know but a poor brittani's
[1:00:14] his minister so how can the message flow
[1:00:18] true and this is an English country from
[1:00:24] nowhere where we are battling on what is
[1:00:28] also happening to other ministers are
[1:00:30] yet to come
[1:00:31] the next moment was Brockport Colleen
[1:00:34] said I need to get my visa now five

[1:01:30] purpose where the devil wants to stop
[1:01:31] your Russian but the devil have been
[1:01:36] defeated and you must have the Russian
