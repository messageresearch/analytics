[11:19] Thank you for [music]
[11:20] God bless you
[11:23] back home and greetings in Jesus name.
[11:27] Let's bow our heads for a word of
[11:28] prayer.
[11:30] Heavenly Father, we thank you for this
[11:32] great opportunity that you've given unto
[11:34] us that we could gather together in this
[11:37] virtual room. And I pray your hand be
[11:40] upon your people in Jamaica that has
[11:43] suffered great loss from this hurricane
[11:45] that just passed by. And I pray, oh God,
[11:48] for your people here in Trinidad, even
[11:51] under what we have as a war oncoming war
[11:53] that is coming. I pray give your people
[11:56] faith and great courage to stand this
[11:59] hour Lord because we have been sitting
[12:01] in this message for quite a long time
[12:04] but Lord you're calling us to maturity
[12:05] you're calling us to deal with what's
[12:07] ahead and the challenges that lays ahead
[12:10] be with us be with us tonight as we
[12:12] approach your word remember those that
[12:14] are sick among us may touch brother in a
[12:16] special way tonight and any person sick
[12:18] mean a special touch on you may your
[12:20] presence go by your word and heal them
[12:22] and touch them and deliver I commit
[12:24] their lives into your hands, this
[12:26] session into your hands in Jesus name.
[12:28] Amen and amen. God bless you. So, God
[12:31] bless you. It's good to be back home uh
[12:33] from this trip and I want to thank you
[12:35] all for your prayer. God did bless and
[12:38] um you'll be hearing more more of it.
[12:41] But right now um the atmosphere in the
[12:43] country long line by gas stations,
[12:46] people line up in groceries to stock up
[12:48] for this war that's supposed to be on
[12:51] its way. and America has um placed all
[12:55] air forces and and aircraft carriers.
[12:59] What a time to be in the Caribbean and
[13:02] um understand that some of Russia stuff
[13:05] is in Venezuela also um China. So we
[13:09] don't know what this would pivot to. Of
[13:12] course they're heading for the oil. It's
[13:14] all about the oil and the bride of Jesus
[13:17] Christ have to head for the oil. is all
[13:20] about the oil. And I want to share
[13:24] something with you today that came to me
[13:26] about war. And the title of what I have
[13:28] to share with you tonight, I have it
[13:30] here. The battle of angels has become
[13:33] the battle of men. So I think I'll read
[13:35] a scripture first and then we'll share
[13:37] what we have to share. I want to read
[13:38] from Ephesians 6
[13:41] uh verse 10 to 19. Make your Bibles. We
[13:43] have another scripture to read.
[13:46] So the title is the battle of angels.
[13:49] has become the battle of men.
[13:52] You know what? Let's read Revelation 12
[13:55] first.
[13:56] Revelation 12 7-11. Then we go to
[13:59] Ephesians 4.
[14:03] Revelation 12:7. There was war in
[14:05] heaven. Michael and his angels fought
[14:08] against the dragon,
[14:10] and the dragon fought on his angels and
[14:13] prevailed not, neither was their place
[14:15] found anymore in heaven. And the great
[14:18] dragon was cast out, that old serpent,
[14:21] all the devil and Satan which deceived
[14:23] by the whole world. He was cast out into
[14:25] the earth and his angels were cast out
[14:28] with him. And I heard a loud voice from
[14:31] heaven saying in heaven, "Now is come
[14:33] salvation and strength, the kingdom of
[14:36] our God, and the power of his Christ.
[14:38] For the accuser of our brethren is cast
[14:40] down which accused them before God day
[14:43] and night. And they overcame him
[14:47] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[14:50] of their testimony and they love not
[14:53] their lives unto death.
[14:56] And we go to Ephesians chapter 6 verse
[14:59] 10. Finally, my brethren, be strong in
[15:01] the Lord and the power of his might. Put
[15:04] on the whole armor of God that you may
[15:06] able to stand against the ws of the
[15:08] devil. For we wrestle not against flesh
[15:11] and blood, but against principalities,
[15:14] against powers, against the rulers of
[15:16] darkness of this world, against
[15:18] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[15:21] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[15:24] of God, that you may to stand in the
[15:27] evil day, and having done all to stand,
[15:29] stand. Then it went on to talk about uh
[15:34] uh I'll continue read it to stand
[15:36] therefore having your law good about
[15:37] with truth. One having the breath of
[15:39] righteousness. Two your feet sh with the
[15:42] preparation of the gospel. Three above
[15:44] all taking the shield of faith. Four
[15:46] able to quench all the fiery dust of the
[15:48] wicked and take the helmet of salvation.
[15:50] Five and the sword of the spirit. Six
[15:52] which is the word of God. praying always
[15:55] with all prayer and supplications in the
[15:58] spirit and watching there unto all
[16:01] perseverance and supplication of all
[16:02] saints and for me that utterance may be
[16:05] given unto me that I may open my mouth
[16:07] boldly to make known the mystery of the
[16:11] gospel.
[16:13] Now
[16:15] we know America is phrased under
[16:18] Revelation chapter 13. The Bible talking
[16:20] about the beast. And the beast I saw was
[16:23] like a leopard. In Revelation 13, I saw
[16:25] one of his heads were wounded to death.
[16:27] His wounded deadly wound was healed. And
[16:30] verse four, familiar scripture. And they
[16:32] worship the dragon which give power unto
[16:35] the beast. And they worship the beast
[16:37] said, "Who is like unto the beast? Who
[16:40] is able to make war with him?" And verse
[16:43] seven of that scripture says, "And it
[16:47] was given unto him
[16:49] to make war with the saints,
[16:53] and to overcome them, and power was
[16:56] given him over all kindreds and tongues
[17:01] and nations. and all that dwell upon the
[17:04] earth shall worship him whose names are
[17:08] not written in the book of life of the
[17:11] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[17:13] world. So I want to share with you
[17:16] tonight that
[17:19] we all have to get away from this
[17:22] natural carnal humanistic realm to catch
[17:28] the purpose of God. This beast system
[17:32] has been given power over nations.
[17:35] That is why the Bible say who can make
[17:37] war with the beast. It's a system. It's
[17:40] a power. You cannot talk like this is
[17:43] disadvantage and advantage and the
[17:46] American forces coming down and little
[17:48] things real and you can't talk that.
[17:52] The battle is against not flesh and
[17:54] blood but ruling spirits. spirits that
[17:58] fell from him. I want you to think about
[18:02] it. War is not new. War is old because
[18:08] war started in heaven. Not only that,
[18:11] the reality is we are up against we are
[18:15] not up against flesh and blood and too
[18:17] many of us are caught up in flesh and
[18:20] blood. And if you think about it, if the
[18:24] battle is not flesh and blood, then
[18:27] listen, our human efforts, money,
[18:31] position, office, wealth, nothing of
[18:36] this earth or in this world of this
[18:39] world could fight that battle
[18:42] because your battle, our battle is not
[18:44] with humans but with spirits working
[18:48] through humans. Hence the battle of
[18:52] angels has become the battle of men. How
[18:56] many see that tonight? I wish so uh and
[18:59] I hope and I want to encourage you to
[19:01] put on your video put on the camera. I
[19:03] could see you. I would love that very
[19:04] very much. But how many understand
[19:07] tonight that
[19:10] this battle okay so we are triune being
[19:12] body spirit and soul. We have to eat. We
[19:16] have to sleep. We have to go to the
[19:17] washroom. We have to go to work. You
[19:19] have to whatever. See about family and
[19:21] everything that is at one level.
[19:25] But understand this. Don't ever forget
[19:27] this.
[19:28] We are spirit being
[19:31] and we are in a war with demons and
[19:34] devils and things that you cannot see
[19:35] with your naked eye. But they are deal.
[19:39] And we could see how they work and how
[19:42] they operate. Now, if you notice,
[19:45] America didn't just come say they're
[19:46] going down to war uh with Venezuela.
[19:50] They ain't come like that yet. They come
[19:52] and say um little narcotics want to stop
[19:55] the drugs and whatnot and one boat, two
[19:57] boat, big aircraft carrier and whatnot.
[20:00] They not It takes so much of millions of
[20:02] dollars to position forces in a
[20:06] particular area. It takes so much to do
[20:09] that that they not wasting time in it
[20:12] already planned plot it how you will
[20:14] execute it and I'm watching the drama
[20:16] unfold.
[20:18] I'm watching how our present prime
[20:21] minister take a certain stand and
[20:23] because of her stand
[20:26] we have uh the country is under certain
[20:29] stress
[20:30] of what is about to take place which is
[20:33] normal and it goes to show the choices a
[20:37] leader makes could affect an entire
[20:39] country. Same thing as a pastor could
[20:42] infect entire church. Same thing as a
[20:45] father in in in affect entire house, a
[20:48] home or a job or a business, whatever it
[20:51] is. Leadership is very important. And
[20:54] God call each one of you here in this
[20:56] room tonight to be leaders, not to be
[20:59] followers, to be leaders. That is why
[21:02] the Bible exhort us to be strong in the
[21:04] Lord and the power of the might. Now,
[21:07] American forces, they pick up people on
[21:08] the street and say, "Let me go to
[21:09] Venezuela. Um, you have a you have a
[21:11] gun." No, it doesn't work that way. The
[21:15] guys who going down there, they are
[21:17] trained.
[21:19] They are trained to
[21:23] know what weapons they have, how to use
[21:27] it, the mindset of war. Now, you will
[21:30] see by going tonight because we have to
[21:33] have we have to go into what I call
[21:35] spiritual warfare.
[21:37] We have to understand the weapons that
[21:39] God has given us and we have to
[21:42] understand how we are to use that. Now,
[21:45] if you are novice or uh a new scripted
[21:50] person, it is a bit difficult because
[21:52] you're getting to know and you're
[21:53] getting familiar familiar with the
[21:55] territory. But the reality is we are in
[21:58] a battle. And I hope tonight that this
[22:02] little exhortation will sort of wake up
[22:03] some of you all to cut the foolishness
[22:06] out as if this is just a flesh and blood
[22:08] thing. you know, you go home, you drop
[22:10] your children to school, you go to the
[22:12] job, you wash your car, you do this, you
[22:15] buy groceries, and I hope this kind of
[22:17] knock that out because it's like you see
[22:19] it, everybody's scrambling.
[22:22] I see so much cars lining up by the gas
[22:24] station, so much people at the
[22:26] groceries, they're stocking up.
[22:29] And when I think about it,
[22:32] where is the soul stuck up? Where is the
[22:36] spirit stuck up? Where is the heart? You
[22:39] know, Lord, I want something more. This
[22:41] is what the wise version doing. They
[22:43] were stocking up on oil. The foolish
[22:46] virgin, their oil ran out. And we have
[22:49] to think like true soldiers. Then we
[22:55] have to think that we are now about
[22:57] getting ready for the war. We come into
[22:59] service, you get an exhortation, you get
[23:01] an instruction, you're getting manual
[23:03] and everything else. But right now, we
[23:05] about to face into action. And that's
[23:07] why some time ago I read the scripture,
[23:09] beat your plowshares into swords. In
[23:12] other words, stop being on the defensive
[23:16] and begin to think that you have to
[23:19] become on the offensive. It's a
[23:21] difference. You're blocking, you're
[23:23] parrying, you're taking blows, you're
[23:25] taking blows, you're taking blows, but
[23:27] you're not doing anything. You're not
[23:29] claiming anything. You're not fighting
[23:31] for anything. You are going to church
[23:34] and then you're going back home. That is
[23:36] not a battle. There's a trip.
[23:40] So God don't want us on trips. God want
[23:42] us to understand why God sent a prophet.
[23:47] Why he take him off the scene knowing
[23:50] that somebody, some group, some people,
[23:53] some individual somewhere on planet
[23:54] Earth will pick up the prophet's
[23:56] prophecy and make it live.
[23:59] Who can make war with the beast? Not me.
[24:03] I can't make no war with the beast. But
[24:05] the Bible said they overcome by the
[24:08] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[24:10] your testimony. You have to have a
[24:12] testimony. You can't be caught up with
[24:14] them people running to the grocery. No,
[24:15] I'm not saying you can't go to the
[24:16] grocery and thinking. I'm saying you
[24:18] can't be caught up in mindset as the
[24:20] people out there who don't know better
[24:23] because we know better. This has been
[24:25] prophesied. These are things that are to
[24:28] be. But what about the bride? What shape
[24:31] is the bride supposed to be in? What
[24:34] consciousness are we supposed to have?
[24:36] And this is the challenge that is before
[24:38] us. So war is not new. War is old. And
[24:42] the battle of angels has now become the
[24:43] battle of men.
[24:45] Listen. So you your battle is not with
[24:49] humans but with spirits working through
[24:51] humans. The battle for territory, battle
[24:55] for land. The battle throughout all the
[24:58] ages have to do with principalities and
[25:00] powers.
[25:02] Now in Luke 10 verse 17, listen to this.
[25:06] This was an amazing piece of scripture
[25:08] and I'm sure if Isaac will dig into it,
[25:10] he would see a lot of stuff inside of
[25:12] here. But verse 17, and the 70 return
[25:14] with joy. This is Jesus guys, Jesus
[25:17] ministers. They're happy saying, Lord,
[25:20] even the devils are subject unto us
[25:22] through thy name. So these guys have an
[25:24] anointing. These guys sharing in the
[25:27] inspiration with Jesus. They're not
[25:28] converted yet, but they're sharing with
[25:30] Jesus ministry. Listen to Jesus now. And
[25:32] he said unto them, this is amazing. They
[25:35] are rejoicing. They are happy. And Jesus
[25:37] said in the first words come out Jesus,
[25:39] I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
[25:42] heaven. So these guys are seeing
[25:45] manifestations
[25:47] of devils in subject to them. So they
[25:50] know they have broken into a realm of
[25:52] the spirit. But Jesus is seeing
[25:54] something and sharing it with I beheld
[25:57] Satan as a lightning pole from heaven.
[26:01] Next words, behold, I give unto you
[26:05] power to tread on serpents and scorpions
[26:09] and over all the power of the enemy, and
[26:12] nothing shall by any means hurt you.
[26:16] So what he did, Jesus saw the vision of
[26:20] Satan, fallen spirits and yet he
[26:23] released to them this promise of power
[26:26] over serpent, scorpions, over the enemy,
[26:28] nothing shall enemies hurt you. And then
[26:30] he dropped down to this. Now not
[26:33] withstanding in this, rejoice not that
[26:36] the spirits are subject unto you, but
[26:39] rather rejoice because your names are
[26:42] written in heaven. And here we have in
[26:44] the book of revelation, all that dwell
[26:47] on the earth shall worship the beast
[26:51] except those whose names are written.
[26:54] Now if by revelation or inspiration
[26:57] God show you or open up to you your name
[27:01] in that book, you have to be somebody
[27:05] that is praising and worshiping God
[27:07] amidst your condition, amidst your
[27:09] trials, amidst your situation because
[27:11] you are here but we have not faced a
[27:14] hurricane 5. So Jamaica just faced that
[27:17] serious problems, serious issues.
[27:21] Someday our time will come. Whether it's
[27:23] hurricane, whether it's earthquake,
[27:25] whatever it is, that is just the law of
[27:26] life, the law of nature is whether or
[27:29] not we will take to heart our trust and
[27:32] our confidence in God. So I want this to
[27:35] be an encouragement to you tonight to
[27:37] have faith in God. So Jesus said,
[27:39] notwithstanding in this, rejoice. In
[27:42] other words, don't we judge because
[27:42] preach unto you, but rejoice because
[27:45] your name is written in heaven. And in
[27:48] that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and
[27:52] said, "I thank thee, oh father, Lord of
[27:55] heaven and earth, that thou has hid
[27:57] these things from the wise and prudent
[27:59] and has revealed them unto babes, even
[28:01] so, father, it seems so good in thy
[28:04] sight." Okay, so let me share something
[28:06] with brother Brandham. Here what he said
[28:08] here. This great first battle that was
[28:11] ever fought begin in heaven. When Mike
[28:13] and as the angel fought, Lucifer as
[28:15] angel and it first started, the first
[28:17] battle was in heaven. So sin did not
[28:20] originate on earth. [clears throat]
[28:22] It originate in heaven. And then here we
[28:25] go. It was thrown down from heaven, cast
[28:28] out of heaven to the earth and fell on
[28:31] human beings. Then the battle from
[28:35] angels become human battles.
[28:40] Do you see it tonight? And Satan come to
[28:43] God to destroy God's creation. What God
[28:46] had created for himself. Satan come to
[28:49] destroy this. That was his purpose was
[28:52] to destroy it. Then the battle begin
[28:54] here on earth and begin in us and has
[28:58] been raging ever since. So the battle of
[29:02] angels have become the battle of men in
[29:04] truest sense.
[29:06] Now
[29:08] I don't know if people take Satan as an
[29:10] idol spirit or idol being. He is not.
[29:14] Jesus is the person that identify that
[29:17] Satan has a kingdom.
[29:19] A kingdom means he has structure.
[29:22] He has order. He has assignments. He has
[29:26] an army of spirits loosed to do
[29:30] mischief, to do destruction, to steal,
[29:33] to rob, to destroy.
[29:35] And we have to understand that our lives
[29:39] have to come into order, structure.
[29:42] Our lives have to come to be determined.
[29:45] Listen to this and I'll read this almost
[29:47] finished. Let me read this here for you.
[29:50] Matthew 12.
[29:52] Then was brought unto him
[29:56] one possessed with a devil. Talking
[29:57] about Jesus, blind and dumb. And he
[30:00] healed him in so much that the blind and
[30:03] dumb both spake and saw. And all the
[30:06] people were amazed and said, "Is not
[30:08] this the son of David?"
[30:10] And when the Pharisees heard it, they
[30:13] said, "This fellow do not cast out
[30:15] devils, but by beab, the prince of
[30:18] devils."
[30:19] And Jesus knew their thoughts and said
[30:21] unto them, these are the words I want to
[30:24] get to you. Jesus speaking of every
[30:27] kingdom divided against itself is
[30:31] brought to desolation.
[30:33] Every city or house divided against
[30:37] itself shall not stand. So what Jesus is
[30:39] identifying here is a principle when
[30:42] things are divided problems. Things are
[30:45] divided a house divided problems. A city
[30:48] divided
[30:50] it will fall. So then he went in verse
[30:52] 26 and said if Satan cast out Satan then
[30:56] he is divided against himself how shall
[31:00] then his kingdom [snorts] stand. It's a
[31:03] question. So Jesus is the one who
[31:07] identify
[31:08] Satan's kingdom that is structured that
[31:12] is ordered. So when the Bible said we
[31:15] wrestled against flesh and blood but
[31:16] against principalities,
[31:19] powers, spiritual wickedness is identify
[31:24] a structure
[31:26] and order.
[31:28] And just as as that all kingdoms have
[31:30] it, God's kingdom has it also structure.
[31:35] Order. And that's how God want our lives
[31:38] to get into order. And when people break
[31:40] the order, there are problems. When in
[31:43] the divisions, you have problems. And
[31:45] that's why the Bible don't want schism
[31:47] in the body. We want to know every joint
[31:50] is supplying what is supposed to supply
[31:52] to the body. This is not church. Now,
[31:54] this is the body of Christ. So, in
[31:56] closing, let me just say these few
[31:57] words.
[31:59] If you are not prepared to fight, you
[32:03] are finished.
[32:05] This is not a picnic. And I am are quite
[32:08] aware that all of you here in this room
[32:10] tonight would be aware of the atmosphere
[32:13] that's in Trinidad right now. I'm sure
[32:15] it is disturbing. It is troublesome. It
[32:17] is annoying. Whatever. But it's an
[32:19] atmosphere. It's something that we know
[32:21] is pending and there's uncertainty.
[32:25] I heard the army is called up. All the
[32:27] policemen is called to come out on duty
[32:29] and whatnot. They expect something.
[32:31] They're looking for something. And what
[32:34] about us? What must we expect? We cannot
[32:38] be just sitting back and just hoping and
[32:40] wondering. No, we have to be prepared to
[32:44] fight.
[32:45] If you have to fight, these are words I
[32:48] put here. You have to acquire weapons of
[32:50] warfare to know how to use them and be
[32:54] trained for the great hour of battle.
[32:57] This is not a game.
[33:00] So America is about to start a war to
[33:03] get the Venezuelan oil.
[33:06] Here Paul in 2 Corinthians 10 3 to 5.
[33:10] For though we walk in the flesh, here we
[33:12] go. We do not war after the flesh. For
[33:16] the weapons of our warfare are not
[33:18] carnal, but mighty through God to the
[33:22] pulling down of strongholds, casting
[33:24] down imaginations and every high thing
[33:28] that exalted itself against the
[33:30] knowledge of God and bringing into
[33:32] captivity every thought to the obedience
[33:34] of Christ. So this is a discipline and
[33:37] I'll close with these words from the
[33:38] Ban.
[33:39] He says this,
[33:43] the great hour of charge is at hand.
[33:45] Soldiers with armor is gleaming, color
[33:47] streaming, faith and doubt is setting
[33:49] yourself in array in this tabernacle.
[33:51] This morning, doubt on one side, faith
[33:53] in the other side. Soldiers stand at
[33:55] your post of duty. Our captain, the
[33:57] morning star leads on. He never goes
[33:59] back. He doesn't know the word retreat.
[34:02] We don't have a retreat. The greatest
[34:04] battle ever fought, she is going on
[34:06] right in here now. between life and
[34:09] death, between sickness and health,
[34:10] between faith and doubt, between liberty
[34:12] and bondage. The battle is on. Shiniest
[34:15] soldiers polish up the armor. God is
[34:18] getting his soldiers ready. God anoints
[34:21] his army. America dresses their soldiers
[34:23] in the best that they have to dress with
[34:25] steel helmets, armors, whatever they
[34:27] got, armor tanks, whatever they go in.
[34:30] God dresses his army. What kind of
[34:31] equipment? the spirit, the sword, the
[34:34] word, the word of God, to believe his
[34:37] word. That's the way God arms. That's
[34:40] what he gave Eve to arm herself with.
[34:42] But she broke her armor down. How did
[34:44] she do it? By opening up her mind to
[34:47] reason. You don't reason with God's
[34:49] word. It has no reason. It's God's word.
[34:51] There's no doubt about it. There's no
[34:53] reason to it. You see what I mean,
[34:55] honey? He's talking to somebody there.
[34:57] God word promise it. They said to
[34:59] Abraham, "Oh, you know, you're going to
[35:00] have a baby." See, God said so. That's
[35:01] settling. Well, why you ain't got it? I
[35:04] don't know, but I'm going to get it. But
[35:06] I'm going to get it. God said so. That
[35:07] won't stop me. Why don't you go back to
[35:10] your home where you come from? I'm to be
[35:12] a pilgrim stranger. God give the
[35:13] promise. God will give the baby right in
[35:15] this land. He sent me. God will heal you
[35:19] right in this atmosphere of the Holy
[35:21] Ghost where he sent you. God will give
[35:24] it to you. Just believe it. Amen. Open
[35:26] up them flues of the soul, body, senses
[35:28] and conscience and just let God's word
[35:31] penetrate first. Take that mind. There
[35:33] is a battleground. Not say, "Well, if I
[35:35] could feel it, if I could feel the glory
[35:38] of God falling, that has nothing to do
[35:41] with it." Another thing, open up that
[35:44] mind. That's the battleground. There's
[35:46] where the battle sits in the right there
[35:48] in the front line, your mind. I doubt I
[35:52] doubt my doubts. I'm doubting my doubts
[35:54] now. and believe in God's word. Here I
[35:56] come, Satan. Something's going to take
[35:57] place. Sure, it will.
[36:01] And that's the end of my exhortation to
[36:02] you tonight.
[36:05] The battle of angels
[36:07] have became the battle of men. And when
[36:10] you mistake
[36:12] this
[36:14] this spirit thing for human, you find
[36:17] yourself fighting up at the humanistic
[36:19] level. This one don't like me. This one
[36:21] this and that one that. And that time is
[36:23] spirits working. And if it's pray spoken
[36:24] on your children, on your wife, on your
[36:26] husband, your mother, your father, your
[36:27] brother, your sister, your uncle, or
[36:28] your boss or your neighbor or your
[36:30] coworker,
[36:32] you are still not wrestling against
[36:34] flesh and blood. And that's why you have
[36:36] to pray. You have to pray for
[36:38] protection. You have to pray for
[36:40] guidance. You have to pray for covering.
[36:42] You have to pray for God's leadership.
[36:44] That's what we have to ask of him.
[36:46] Because the tools of our wealth warfare,
[36:48] we can't pelt money and pay off a demon.
[36:52] You can't take muscles and build muscles
[36:54] and say, "Well, you go fight a physical
[36:56] fight with the spirits." It not not
[36:58] working. So, the tools we need is from
[37:00] God. The power we need is from God. I'll
[37:03] close with these words. I want to close,
[37:04] but things keep coming.
[37:07] Samson with the anointing upon him
[37:11] covenanted by seven. After a while,
[37:16] it comes so normal in his strength that
[37:19] he thought he was the superman.
[37:22] When the Laya,
[37:24] the spirit behind him. So, so you're
[37:27] looking nice woman, nice shape, tall,
[37:30] whatever, whatever, whatever. He like
[37:32] her, he in love with her. She's been
[37:34] used, she's been influenced by a higher
[37:38] power. She's being influenced by heavy
[37:41] demons to get the secret of Samson seven
[37:45] locks to break him. And Samson, you
[37:48] could see a level of his ignorance when
[37:50] she did get the secret. And when she cut
[37:53] his locks, the Bible said he shake
[37:55] himself like before, but he was like any
[37:58] other man. Friends, we cannot go back
[38:02] there. We can't afford to be like any
[38:07] other man. That's what the world has. We
[38:11] are called to be a covenanted people and
[38:14] our God is a great God. He is a way
[38:17] maker. He want you to be able to
[38:20] acknowledge that he's a way maker. So
[38:22] you're not trying to make a way for
[38:23] yourself. You're trying to let him lead
[38:24] you.
[38:26] Let's bow our heads.
[38:28] Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight
[38:31] trying to exalt your people
[38:35] and it has been coming to me for quite a
[38:37] while. War is coming and war is almost
[38:41] right upon us. But Lord, the battle is
[38:44] not against flesh and blood. Prepare our
[38:46] hearts Lord because things is about to
[38:49] get started. Prepare our hearts because
[38:52] the bride your prophet taught us will be
[38:54] a haunted persecuted group. Prepare our
[38:57] hearts because we we were not called to
[38:59] sit on warm church benches and then go
[39:02] home in the rapture. Oh glory. No, we
[39:04] are called to higher calling than that.
[39:08] to manifest and to reproduce your
[39:10] original grain, even Jesus Christ back
[39:12] on the earth. There'll be one more ride.
[39:16] May the people get a burden tonight. A
[39:19] burden of this spiritual warfare that
[39:21] starts in prayer that starts with the
[39:25] understanding is not flesh and blood.
[39:28] It's a whole spiritual realm and we need
[39:31] reinforcement.
[39:33] When Daniel was praying and the angel
[39:36] Gabriel was busting and fighting through
[39:38] that was detained because of the raging
[39:41] warfare in the realm of the spirit. Your
[39:44] prophet taught us that if Daniel had
[39:46] stopped praying, the angel had to stop
[39:48] coming. Oh God, dispatch your angels
[39:51] tonight to every home, every family,
[39:55] every life. And as they pray, God
[39:57] tonight, may the angels come closer and
[40:00] closer and closer. Angel of deliverance,
[40:02] angel of healing, whatever they have
[40:04] need of, may you minister and meet their
[40:06] every need in Jesus name I ask. Amen and
[40:10] amen. God bless you. I trust then that
[40:13] this would help you. As we look to God
[40:16] and cry out unto him and to think that
[40:20] he's not finished with you yet, there's
[40:22] much more to be done. There's much more
[40:24] for God to accomplish through all that.
[40:26] And just as these demon spirits need a
[40:29] physical body to work through, the Holy
[40:32] Ghost needs a physical body to work
[40:35] through. Let that body be you. I want to
[40:38] repeat that. Just as those demons,
[40:42] spirits, entities without bodies, God
[40:45] put man in the earth in these spirits
[40:48] was kicked out from him and they're
[40:50] looking to enter into bodies to
[40:53] influence lives, to influence countries
[40:54] and nations. That's why he offered Jesus
[40:58] all these nations are mine including
[40:59] Trinidad.
[41:02] Just remember that all these countries,
[41:05] all these nations are mine. So, however
[41:08] he is being ruled, every country is
[41:11] under that anointing of the devil.
[41:14] But we are called out to be under the
[41:18] anointing of God. So, may God bless you
[41:19] as we get down in prayer. Praise the
[41:21] Lord.
