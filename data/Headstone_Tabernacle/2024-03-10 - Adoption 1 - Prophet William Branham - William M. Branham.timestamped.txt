[45:53] our Sunday morning service and what a
[45:55] blessing we had on Friday brother
[45:59] Kelly if you haven't heard it go back
[46:01] and listen to it every service counts
[46:04] everything that we do and share I said
[46:07] that um I felt led to call him and I
[46:11] can't say he felt L to be ready but he
[46:13] was ready just like he was waiting for
[46:15] that call so that's how God work on both
[46:18] sides and there's another testimony what
[46:21] happened the day after just to confirm
[46:23] what took place on Friday so it's kind
[46:24] of mind bugling
[46:26] so I told him it's all Supernatural and
[46:29] this is what we have to see about being
[46:31] led by the spirit so for example on
[46:34] Wednesday night I know I didn't finish
[46:36] and had stuff I could preach I had
[46:37] another message preach this morning and
[46:39] yet I get something else to do this
[46:40] morning so we going to see what the Lord
[46:42] will do but I want to bring back a
[46:43] scripture that brother kis read from
[46:48] Jeremiah uh
[46:50] chapter uh three and God was speaking
[46:53] and said and the Lord said unto me the
[46:55] backsliding
[46:56] Israel had justify herself more than
[46:59] treacherous
[47:00] Judah go and Proclaim these words
[47:03] towards the North and say return th
[47:05] backslide in Israel sayeth the Lord and
[47:07] I will not cause my anger to fall upon
[47:10] you for I am merciful sayth the Lord and
[47:13] I will not keep anger forever so I want
[47:16] you to think that God is not a man so
[47:18] let's say another dimension mysterious
[47:21] being
[47:22] Spirit humans that's what we are
[47:26] and he can't break his own laws because
[47:29] he's God even though he want to be
[47:32] merciful even though he want to help you
[47:34] he can't help you outside the law of his
[47:37] word do you understand that he can't say
[47:41] like I was human as as you pass pass
[47:43] pass or come to the back door oh or is
[47:46] your child no he's no respect of persons
[47:49] so you may have issues with your child
[47:52] being straighten out by the ministry or
[47:54] by the word and you get vexed and
[47:55] everything else that have with God you
[47:57] know that have to do with your human
[48:01] element that has nothing to do with
[48:05] God uh the Bible study Isaac had the
[48:08] king who was a good King his sons was
[48:11] terrible so you can't say because the
[48:13] king is a good King automatically his
[48:15] son's going to be good no them guys was
[48:17] terrible guys even with Eli was terrible
[48:20] people terrible children in other words
[48:23] they don't follow through the king is
[48:25] righteous the father is righteous and
[48:27] the children end up corrupt so it cannot
[48:29] be is my child and my child you're
[48:31] defending your child no have child off
[48:32] your child off your child wrong your
[48:33] child wrong because God word is
[48:35] true so God was saying here go and
[48:38] Proclaim his words to the north and said
[48:40] return th backside in Israel say the
[48:42] Lord and I will not cause my anger to
[48:45] fall upon you for I am
[48:49] merciful sayith the Lord I will not keep
[48:52] anger forever so this God we serve do
[48:55] get angry
[48:57] come on say don't hold back on what
[48:58] talking mystery he just get angry he
[49:00] just get upset you as a parent you ever
[49:03] get
[49:04] upset upset with your children upset
[49:07] with the situation well God has get
[49:08] upset he has get upset with you and with
[49:11] me he get upset and he has get angry and
[49:14] when he get angry he just want to do
[49:17] something just as you as a parent when
[49:19] you get angry you want to do something
[49:22] either you speak to the child or correct
[49:23] the child or whatever it is but you do
[49:25] something about it the first thing you
[49:27] do is to speak stop that
[49:31] foolishness and if you don't want to
[49:33] hear you just feel afterwards oh I go
[49:35] bring the
[49:38] belt but something had to be done the
[49:41] first thing is a warning because it's
[49:43] God speaking are you with me here this
[49:46] part verse 13 this the part me only
[49:49] acknowledge thine
[49:50] iniquity that thou has transgressed
[49:53] against the Lord thy God right and has
[49:56] scattered thy ways to the strangers on
[49:58] the evergreen tree and you have not
[50:00] obeyed my voice sayeth the Lord all
[50:03] right he said only acknowledge your
[50:05] iniquity don't make excuses don't say
[50:08] it's not me no no no you was that fault
[50:12] you sinned you fail you were corrupt you
[50:16] were whatever you did

[50:24] somebody excuse you want to make church
[50:25] are excuse all kind of excuse and you
[50:27] don't want to see the mirror of the word
[50:28] to see your own self and that's a shame
[50:31] because God will hit your heart on that
[50:34] you are his child but he going to
[50:35] discipline you praise God he going to
[50:38] forgive you know but you going to reap
[50:39] what you s you can't so Cav and reap

[51:02] will give you pastors according to my
[51:05] heart which shall feed you with
[51:08] knowledge and
[51:10] understanding oh praise the name of the
[51:12] Lord and it shall come to pass when he
[51:14] shall be multiplied and increased in the

[51:20] they shall say no more the Ark of the
[51:21] Covenant of the Lord neither shall it

[51:25] remember it neither shall they visit it

[51:29] time they shall call Jerusalem the
[51:30] Throne of God and all nations shall be
[51:32] gathered unto it to the name of the Lord

[1:01:25] at the Sha that's where we always have
[1:01:28] such a marvelous time not too biger
[1:01:32] crowds we run sometimes it'll hold up to
[1:01:35] about I suppose we could put 10,000 in
[1:01:38] it easy but usually last year I think we
[1:01:41] had around about
[1:01:43] 7,000 something like that was a packed
[1:01:45] out place but there's plenty of room to
[1:01:48] stand and seats that they could run all
[1:01:50] the way
[1:01:51] out and uh so we are looking forward to
[1:01:56] that and glad to see many of our
[1:01:59] Minister Brothers
[1:02:01] in uh can't never think of his name here
[1:02:04] the missionary brother
[1:02:05] Humes sister Humes is that you sitting
[1:02:09] right here the little ones we're glad to
[1:02:11] have them a
[1:02:12] missionarying other ones brother Pat
[1:02:17] brother Dalton and all just so many
[1:02:20] brother beer and seen brother Collins
[1:02:23] just a few moments ago
[1:02:26] and oh it' be kind of hard to call them
[1:02:28] all but we're very happy to have you in
[1:02:31] the house of the Lord
[1:02:33] tonight this great precious brother
[1:02:37] Neville sitting behind me here to pray
[1:02:39] with me while we are going to teach the
[1:02:41] word Charlie glad to see you and sister
[1:02:43] Nelly Here Tonight the little
[1:02:47] ones this is and Bible teaching is
[1:02:50] usually a
[1:02:52] very yes brother Welch I just was
[1:02:54] looking for you I see you sitting back
[1:02:56] there
[1:03:00] now Bible teaching is usually a little
[1:03:04] treacherous a little you know kind of
[1:03:07] walking out on the thin ice we call it
[1:03:10] but we just feel that maybe at this
[1:03:15] point and at this time it might be good
[1:03:18] to kind of bring the the church to what
[1:03:22] I think to uh
[1:03:24] uh
[1:03:26] complete uh understanding positionally
[1:03:29] of what we are in Christ
[1:03:33] Jesus and sometimes I think that
[1:03:36] preaching is a wonderful thing but I
[1:03:39] believe sometimes brother beer that
[1:03:42] teaching goes beyond that and kindly
[1:03:47] especially to the church now preaching
[1:03:50] usually catches The Sinner brings him
[1:03:53] under condemnation by the word but
[1:03:58] teaching places the man positionally
[1:04:01] what he
[1:04:02] is and we can never rightly be able to
[1:04:08] have faith until positionally we know
[1:04:12] what we are amen now if the United
[1:04:16] States of this Fair land here sent me
[1:04:20] over to Russia as an
[1:04:23] ambassador of this nation to
[1:04:25] Russia then if they have officially sent
[1:04:30] me to Russia all the power that the
[1:04:34] United States has is behind me my word
[1:04:38] is just the same as the United States if
[1:04:41] I have been recognized as an ambassador
[1:04:45] amen and then if God has sent us to be
[1:04:49] his
[1:04:50] ambassadors all the power that's in
[1:04:53] heaven
[1:04:55] all that God
[1:04:57] is all of his angels and all of his
[1:05:02] power stands behind our words amen if we
[1:05:05] are correctly an
[1:05:08] ordained sent Messengers to the people
[1:05:13] God has to honor the
[1:05:16] word for he has so solemnly
[1:05:19] written that whatever you bind on Earth
[1:05:23] that will I bind in
[1:05:26] heaven whatever you loose on Earth that
[1:05:29] will I loose in
[1:05:32] heaven I give unto thee the keys to the
[1:05:36] kingdom all such great promises he's
[1:05:39] given the
[1:05:42] church and I am after the other day if
[1:05:46] many of you are supposed to share this
[1:05:48] morning to here as I try to in my humble
[1:05:53] simple way to explain the the vision
[1:05:58] that I saw of
[1:06:02] Heaven I Would by no means ever try to
[1:06:06] doubt anything that anyone ever told me
[1:06:08] that God told
[1:06:10] them I believe it even if I didn't see
[1:06:13] it in the scripture I would still uh
[1:06:16] want to believe that brother's
[1:06:18] word I I might just stay right along
[1:06:21] with the Bible but still I would believe
[1:06:23] it may be brother had just misunderstood
[1:06:25] it some way that he might have just got
[1:06:28] it mixed up a
[1:06:30] little and still I would believe he he
[1:06:33] to be my
[1:06:35] brother and if there's anything that
[1:06:37] burns within my
[1:06:39] heart and I hope it never leaves in my
[1:06:42] years to come that I'll never forget
[1:06:45] what happened last Sunday morning as a
[1:06:48] week amen it has done something to me
[1:06:52] that's revolutionized my my
[1:06:55] life I I do not fear I I have not one
[1:07:00] fear of
[1:07:01] death death has no fear at all and it it
[1:07:07] doesn't for you if you just
[1:07:10] understood now maybe if you'd have to
[1:07:13] have the experience to know it because
[1:07:16] there's no way to explain it you cannot
[1:07:19] find words because it doesn't lay in the
[1:07:24] English uh
[1:07:26] dictionary or no other
[1:07:29] dictionary because it's in an
[1:07:33] eternity no yesterday no tomorrow it's
[1:07:37] all present
[1:07:40] tense and it's no uh I feel pretty good
[1:07:44] in an hour from now I don't feel so well

[1:08:08] ever reach that Heavenly
[1:08:11] Shore and if I may have the privilege of
[1:08:15] saying this which maybe I do not if I do
[1:08:19] not then I pray God forgive
[1:08:22] me but if if I have the privilege and it
[1:08:25] was that God let me be caught
[1:08:29] up to see something I would refer to the
[1:08:34] first
[1:08:35] heavens and then I believe one in the
[1:08:38] Bible by the name I believe was Paul
[1:08:41] that was caught up into the third
[1:08:46] heavens and if it was this glorious in
[1:08:49] the first Heavens what does that third
[1:08:52] Heavens hold
[1:08:54] [Music]
[1:08:56] am no wonder he couldn't speak of it for
[1:08:59] 14
[1:09:00] years he said he did not know whether he
[1:09:03] was inbody or out of
[1:09:06] body with that great Apostle not to
[1:09:10] share his his his office or not to try
[1:09:15] to make ourselves anything like he
[1:09:19] was but I can say with him I don't know
[1:09:23] whether it was in this body are out of
[1:09:25] the body only thing it would just as
[1:09:28] real as I'm looking at
[1:09:30] you and I've always wondered about if
[1:09:35] I'd passed by I'd see a little Cloud
[1:09:38] floating by a spirit and say there goes
[1:09:40] brother and sister that's Charlie and
[1:09:44] Nelly that's brother and sister Spencer
[1:09:46] going
[1:09:48] there that always puzzle me if my eyes
[1:09:52] is in in the grave uh
[1:09:56] decaying
[1:09:58] rottening if my ears is not here to hear
[1:10:02] anymore and if my blood is all gone back
[1:10:06] and they've been bombed it and it's in
[1:10:09] the waters are in the ground and my
[1:10:13] mental faculties my brain cells are all
[1:10:16] gone then how would I be any more than
[1:10:20] just a spirit floating around that
[1:10:24] wearied me how would I like to say hello
[1:10:28] brother Pat oh so glad to see you hello
[1:10:33] brother naville I would like to see you
[1:10:36] but I thought well if I don't have
[1:10:38] anything to see with any mouth to speak
[1:10:42] with it's rotten it's
[1:10:45] dust how would I be able to say hello
[1:10:48] brother Pat hello brother Neville or so
[1:10:50] forth hi
[1:10:52] Charlie
[1:10:54] but now I know that that's
[1:10:56] wrong for it is written in the
[1:10:59] scriptures which I say it's not contrary
[1:11:02] for if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:11:07] dissolved we have one already
[1:11:11] waiting another Tabernacle it has eyes
[1:11:16] ears lifts mental
[1:11:20] faculties if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:11:24] dissolved it has a body that I can feel
[1:11:27] can talk and now it comes to me just now
[1:11:32] that Moses had been dead and in an in
[1:11:35] unmarked grave for 800 years and Elisha
[1:11:40] had went to heaven 500 years before but
[1:11:45] on Mount Transfiguration they were found
[1:11:48] talking with
[1:11:51] Jesus Hallelujah
[1:11:54] Hallelujah after Samuel had been dead
[1:11:57] for at least 3 to 5 years and The Witch
[1:12:02] of indor called him up and she fell on
[1:12:05] her face and she said you have deceived
[1:12:08] me
[1:12:10] because you are Saul
[1:12:12] yourself she said because I see Gods she
[1:12:17] was a heathen you see I see Gods rising
[1:12:22] up and Saul couldn't see him yet and he
[1:12:25] said what does he look like describe him
[1:12:29] to me said he's thin and he has a mantle
[1:12:34] over his
[1:12:35] shoulder said that's Samuel the
[1:12:38] prophet bring him here before
[1:12:41] me and I want you to notice that Samuel
[1:12:44] had not lost any of his personality he
[1:12:48] was still a
[1:12:49] prophet he told Saul exactly what would
[1:12:53] happen happen the next
[1:12:55] day so you see death does
[1:12:58] not completely diminish us as we weep
[1:13:03] and wail and lament at the grave it only
[1:13:07] changes our Dwelling
[1:13:10] Place it takes us from a place to what
[1:13:14] is
[1:13:15] age if I live one more hour I'll outlive
[1:13:19] a many 16y old
[1:13:22] person
[1:13:23] I'll out live a many five year old
[1:13:27] person age is
[1:13:29] nothing we're just set here for a
[1:13:33] purpose to do
[1:13:35] something well now many of these
[1:13:39] little pretty faed mothers sitting here
[1:13:42] some of them 60 or 70 years old would
[1:13:44] say what have I done brother brandom
[1:13:48] you've raised your
[1:13:49] children you've done what you were
[1:13:52] supposed to do
[1:13:54] maybe some old dad sitting here say well
[1:13:56] I've hired the fields I've done this I
[1:13:58] never preach but you did just what God
[1:14:02] sent for you to do there's a place for
[1:14:06] you speaking to an old doctor yesterday
[1:14:10] one of my doctor friends
[1:14:14] buddies 80 something years
[1:14:19] old
[1:14:20] and his sister law is here at the church
[1:14:27] tonight and she's been just a tle teeny
[1:14:30] bit worried about him and I went to see
[1:14:34] him and as soon as I begin to talk to
[1:14:37] him he brightened up told me about a
[1:14:40] hunting trip he taken many years ago up
[1:14:42] in Colorado in the very same country I
[1:14:44] hunt at just as brilliant and
[1:14:47] bright and I said Doctor how long you
[1:14:50] been practicing he said when you were
[1:14:52] nursing
[1:14:54] and way down I said a many a time he
[1:14:57] said I've practiced taking my
[1:14:59] buggy I've put my saddle bags over my
[1:15:04] horse I've took the little
[1:15:06] satchel and I've walked and I said yes
[1:15:09] down along the creek Banks 2:00 in the
[1:15:12] morning with your flashlight trying to
[1:15:14] find the house where a little child had
[1:15:16] tummy acre mother labor
[1:15:18] pains that's
[1:15:21] right I said you know doctor I believe
[1:15:25] across this dividing line here between
[1:15:28] Mortal and immortality God has a place
[1:15:31] for good old doctors that serve like
[1:15:34] that great tears come in his eyes and he
[1:15:38] started crying he reached up his feeble
[1:15:40] hands and said brother I hope
[1:15:42] so across the
[1:15:46] land god judges a man's
[1:15:49] Soul what he is then I give him this
[1:15:53] satisfying
[1:15:54] scripture many times plying through
[1:15:57] those dark muddy fields at night trying
[1:15:59] to help
[1:16:00] somebody maybe never get a penny for but
[1:16:04] it's all
[1:16:05] right I said Jesus said in the
[1:16:08] scripture blessed are the merciful for
[1:16:12] they shall obtain
[1:16:17] mercy and that is
[1:16:19] true tonight we want to set the church
[1:16:23] in these three lessons if God
[1:16:26] permits how and what to look to what we
[1:16:30] are we're going to begin at the first
[1:16:33] chapter of the book of Paul's letter to
[1:16:37] Ephesus and we're going to take the
[1:16:40] three first chapters in our next three
[1:16:43] studies trying to get a chapter a
[1:16:46] evening if we
[1:16:47] can tonight Wednesday and next Sunday
[1:16:52] morning Ephesians the first
[1:16:55] chapter
[1:16:56] now as we study together I'd like to say
[1:17:01] this that this book of
[1:17:05] Ephesians perfectly
[1:17:08] parallels the Old Testament
[1:17:13] Joshua Ephesians the book of Ephesians
[1:17:16] now remember if we happen to get just a
[1:17:19] little off to your teaching just far
[1:17:23] give us and bear with us a while before
[1:17:26] we open it let's ask him to help us as
[1:17:29] we bow our
[1:17:30] heads Lord we are
[1:17:34] approaching thy holy and sacred
[1:17:39] RIT which it is more secure than all the
[1:17:43] heavens and
[1:17:45] earth for we read in this word called
[1:17:49] the Bible that both Heaven and Earth
[1:17:52] will pass pass away but my word shall
[1:17:55] never
[1:17:59] fail then upon this solemn hour that I
[1:18:04] come to this ppit tonight before the
[1:18:07] purchase of your blood these precious
[1:18:10] darling
[1:18:12] martal that set here tonight grasping
[1:18:16] for every little hope that they can to
[1:18:19] hold on for that life that is to come
[1:18:23] yes may it be so sufficient tonight that
[1:18:27] every believer here will see his
[1:18:30] position and everyone who has not yet
[1:18:33] come into this Great Fellowship will
[1:18:36] press the kingdom Lord and knock at the
[1:18:39] door until the keeper opens the
[1:18:42] door granted
[1:18:45] Lord we are reading in here where uh
[1:18:48] this Bible is of no private
[1:18:51] interpretation
[1:18:54] God forbid that I your servant or any
[1:18:58] other servant would ever try to put
[1:19:00] their own interpretation to the
[1:19:03] word let us just read it and believe it
[1:19:07] the way it is
[1:19:09] written and especially we Shepherds of
[1:19:13] the
[1:19:14] flocks we pastors who someday will
[1:19:18] gather you in that glorious
[1:19:20] land with the little flocks and we'll
[1:19:24] stand in the presence of the Lord
[1:19:27] Jesus and we'll see that generation come
[1:19:30] up of
[1:19:31] Paul and of
[1:19:33] Peter and of Luke and Mark and Matthew
[1:19:37] and all the them and see them judge
[1:19:41] there with their
[1:19:43] groups God grant that I can lay 10
[1:19:47] million trophies at your
[1:19:50] feet while I humbly Coss all up and lay
[1:19:55] my hands upon your precious feet and say
[1:20:00] Lord they are
[1:20:03] yours oh
[1:20:06] God fill us freshly with thy spirit and
[1:20:10] with thy love and thy
[1:20:12] goodness and may we as the poet has
[1:20:16] expressed in the song many years
[1:20:19] ago dear dying lamb thy Precious Blood
[1:20:25] shall never lose its
[1:20:28] power until all the ransom Church of God
[1:20:32] be saved to sin no
[1:20:35] more and ever since by faith I saw that
[1:20:40] stream thy flowing wound
[1:20:43] supplied redeeming love has been my
[1:20:47] theme and shall be till I
[1:20:50] [Music]
[1:20:51] die then in a nobler sweeter song he
[1:20:55] goes on to
[1:20:58] say I'll sing thy power to
[1:21:03] save when this poor lisping stammering
[1:21:06] tongue lies silent in the
[1:21:10] grave then the grave does not hold any
[1:21:13] death for your
[1:21:15] children it's only a resting place or a
[1:21:19] hiding place for this corruption put on
[1:21:24] incorruption may we tonight see this
[1:21:27] Lord plainly as it is given to us in the
[1:21:30] word give us understanding and place us
[1:21:34] Lord at our post of Duty that we might
[1:21:37] serve Faithfully until you come we ask
[1:21:40] this in jesus' name and for his sake
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:54] now the book of Ephesians as I was just
[1:21:59] saying I to my opinion is one of the
[1:22:03] greatest books of the New
[1:22:06] Testament it leaves us on where
[1:22:11] Calvinism runs out on one limb and
[1:22:14] Armenian ISM runs out on the other L but
[1:22:18] the book of Ephesian draws it together
[1:22:20] and positionally play es the
[1:22:24] church now I typed it with
[1:22:28] Joshua if you notice Israel was brought
[1:22:31] up out of Egypt and the three stages of
[1:22:35] their
[1:22:37] Journey one stage was leaving Egypt the
[1:22:41] next stage was the Wilderness and the
[1:22:44] next stage was
[1:22:46] Canaan now Canan does not
[1:22:51] represent the age of the
[1:22:55] Millennium it only represents the age of
[1:22:58] the
[1:22:59] Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming
[1:23:02] because in Canaan they killed and burnt
[1:23:07] and Tuck cities and there will be no
[1:23:10] death in the
[1:23:12] Millennium but another thing that it
[1:23:15] does it brings up justification by faith
[1:23:19] after they believed Moses and left Egypt
[1:23:22] sanctification to following under the
[1:23:24] pillar of fire and the atonement of the
[1:23:26] sacrificial lamb in the wilderness and
[1:23:29] then entering into a land that had been
[1:23:35] promised now what is the land promised
[1:23:38] to the New Testament
[1:23:40] believer the promise is the holy
[1:23:45] spirit for it shall come to pass in the
[1:23:48] last days Joel
[1:23:49] 228 that I will pour out my my spirit
[1:23:53] upon All Flesh your sons and your
[1:23:56] daughters shall prophesy upon my hands
[1:23:58] maids and my maid servants will I pour
[1:24:01] out of my spirit and they shall
[1:24:03] prophesy I'll show wonders in the
[1:24:06] heavens above and in the earth pillars
[1:24:08] of fire and smoke and
[1:24:10] vapor and Peter said on the day of
[1:24:12] Pentecost after taking his text and
[1:24:16] preaching repent every one of you and be
[1:24:20] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:24:23] for the
[1:24:26] remission to remit to forgive to take
[1:24:31] away all back trespasses did you notice
[1:24:36] Joshua before they Cross Jordan Joshua
[1:24:40] he said go through the midst of the camp
[1:24:43] and clean your clothes and sanctify
[1:24:46] every one of you and let no man come at
[1:24:48] his wife far within 3 days you'll see
[1:24:53] the glory of
[1:24:55] God see it is a it is a process of
[1:25:00] getting ready to inherit the
[1:25:04] promise now the promise to Israel was
[1:25:07] God gave Abraham the promise of the
[1:25:11] land of Palestine and it was to be their
[1:25:15] possession
[1:25:17] forever and there was to always remain
[1:25:20] in this land now they come three stages
[1:25:24] coming to this promised land now watch
[1:25:27] it's perfectly typed in the New
[1:25:30] Testament now if this is I've said
[1:25:33] disagrees with some of the thinking of
[1:25:36] yours some of you precious Nazarene
[1:25:38] people Church of God and so forth don't
[1:25:41] let it hurt but just watch it close and
[1:25:44] watch the types watch and see if ever
[1:25:46] place don't hit just perfect there was
[1:25:49] three stages of the journey and and
[1:25:52] there's three stages of this
[1:25:54] journey for we are justified by faith
[1:25:58] believing on the Lord Jesus christall
[1:26:01] forsaking the land of Egypt come out and
[1:26:03] then are Sanctified to the offering of
[1:26:07] his blood wash from our sins and become
[1:26:11] pilgrims and
[1:26:14] Souljers claiming that we are seeking a
[1:26:17] land a city that's coming are a
[1:26:21] promise so did Israel in the wilderness
[1:26:25] sojourners no place to rest traveling
[1:26:29] night after night fallowing the pillar
[1:26:31] ofar but finally come to the promised
[1:26:37] land where they settle
[1:26:40] down that's where the believer comes he
[1:26:43] comes first to recognition that he's a
[1:26:46] sinner then he is separated by the
[1:26:49] waters the washing of the Water by the
[1:26:51] blood
[1:26:53] and are the washing of the Water by the
[1:26:55] word rather Believing on the Lord Jesus
[1:26:58] Christ than being justified by faith he
[1:27:02] becomes a partaker and a peace with God
[1:27:05] through
[1:27:06] Christ baptized into the name of Jesus
[1:27:09] Christ to Omit him into the
[1:27:14] journey you get
[1:27:16] it into the journey then he becomes a
[1:27:20] soul Jer and a
[1:27:23] Pilgrim he's on his journey to what a
[1:27:27] promise that God
[1:27:29] made Israel had not yet received the
[1:27:33] promise but they were on their
[1:27:37] [Music]
[1:27:38] Journey I'm
[1:27:40] without raising please do understand
[1:27:45] that's where you the Nazarene and
[1:27:47] Pilgrim Holiness and so forth fell
[1:27:49] because Israel when they come to the
[1:27:53] spot of kades Baria when the spies went
[1:27:56] over and said the land is great but some
[1:27:59] of them come back and said we can't take
[1:28:01] it because the cities are walled up and
[1:28:04] so forth but Joshua and Caleb stood out
[1:28:08] and said we're more than able to take
[1:28:11] it because of there're already signed up
[1:28:16] documented statements they believed in
[1:28:19] two works of Grace justification and
[1:28:22] sanctification and could not move any
[1:28:25] farther and
[1:28:27] listen that whole generation perished in
[1:28:32] the
[1:28:35] wilderness but two that went over into
[1:28:39] the promised land and brought back the
[1:28:41] evidence that it was a goodly land and
[1:28:45] we were more than able to take it
[1:28:46] because it was God's promise then
[1:28:49] instead of the people going on receiving
[1:28:52] the Holy Spirit speaking with tongues
[1:28:55] receiving the power of God the baptism
[1:28:57] of the Holy Ghost signs wonders Miracles
[1:29:00] they felt that it would break down their
[1:29:03] tradition of
[1:29:05] Doctrine and what happened to it
[1:29:08] perished in the
[1:29:10] land that's right but the Believers the
[1:29:15] Caleb and Joshua outfit that was going
[1:29:18] on to the
[1:29:20] promise they move moved on over into the
[1:29:23] land and took the land and settled down
[1:29:28] in the land as a
[1:29:31] possession and we never stop at
[1:29:34] justification
[1:29:36] sanctification let's go on to the
[1:29:40] baptism of the Holy Spirit let's not
[1:29:43] stop at Believing on the Lord Jesus
[1:29:45] being baptized let's not stop because he
[1:29:48] cleaned us up from a life of sin but now
[1:29:51] we pray rest down into a
[1:29:54] position to a promise of the baptism of
[1:29:58] the Holy Ghost bar Peter said on the day
[1:30:00] of Pentecost for the promise is unto you
[1:30:04] and to your children and to them it's
[1:30:07] far off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:30:10] shall
[1:30:12] call so Ephesus here sets us like Joshua
[1:30:18] positioning you notice Joshua after
[1:30:22] crossing over the land and taking the
[1:30:24] land then he divided the land Ephraim
[1:30:29] here Manasses here and this one here Gad
[1:30:35] here Benjamin here he divided the land
[1:30:39] and
[1:30:40] notice oh this just burns our hearts
[1:30:45] each one of those Hebrew mothers giving
[1:30:48] birth to those
[1:30:50] children she spoke the very place in her
[1:30:53] labor pains where they would be
[1:30:56] positioned in the promised
[1:30:59] land oh it's a great study we can only
[1:31:03] go into it in details which would take
[1:31:06] hours after
[1:31:08] hours someday when we get our church
[1:31:11] fixed I just like to come and take a
[1:31:13] solid month or two am just stay right in
[1:31:17] it watch when they each one of those
[1:31:19] mothers when she called out e for
[1:31:23] him when she was in labor positionally
[1:31:27] placed him where his feet was setting in
[1:31:31] ARL just exactly every one of them
[1:31:35] whever they were at and Joshua not
[1:31:38] knowing this but by
[1:31:41] inspiration LED of the Holy Spirit after
[1:31:43] being into the promised land give each
[1:31:47] man his promise exactly what the Holy
[1:31:49] Spirit promised through the birth Bank
[1:31:53] there how that God has set some in the
[1:31:56] church through the labor
[1:31:59] pains oh they get tremendous
[1:32:03] sometime when a church is groaning under
[1:32:06] the persecution of the outside world
[1:32:10] Believing on the Lord Jesus that the
[1:32:12] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[1:32:14] real to us as it was the
[1:32:16] Pentecost how they groan and cry under
[1:32:20] labor pains but when they are born and
[1:32:25] positionally Born Into the kingdom of
[1:32:28] God then the Holy Ghost has set in the
[1:32:32] church some
[1:32:34] Apostles some
[1:32:36] prophets some teachers some pastors some
[1:32:41] evangelists then he's given to there
[1:32:44] speaking with tongues interpretation of
[1:32:47] tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of
[1:32:50] healing all kinds of Miracles where the
[1:32:55] church is now this is my purpose of
[1:32:57] doing
[1:32:58] this the church is always trying to take
[1:33:02] somebody else's
[1:33:05] corn but don't do that you can never
[1:33:08] raise corn in ephraim's corner if you're
[1:33:12] a
[1:33:13] Manasses you've got to take your place
[1:33:17] in Christ positionally take it all it
[1:33:21] gets deep and Rich when we get in
[1:33:23] here how that God puts one in the church
[1:33:27] to speak with tongues another now we
[1:33:30] have been taught many times we all have
[1:33:32] to speak with tongues that's wrong we
[1:33:35] all got to do it no we don't they all
[1:33:37] didn't do one thing each one was each
[1:33:40] lamb was provided and divid up by
[1:33:43] inspiration and each one I could take
[1:33:45] the scriptures and show to you exactly
[1:33:48] that he put them in the place where they
[1:33:50] were supposed to be
[1:33:53] amen
[1:33:55] positionally how that the two half
[1:33:57] tribes is to stay across the river how
[1:34:00] that their mothers cried that in their
[1:34:02] birth and how that each place was
[1:34:05] supposed to be and now after you're in
[1:34:08] that don't mean that you're out free
[1:34:09] from war you still have to fight for
[1:34:12] every inch of ground you stand on so see
[1:34:16] Canaan did not
[1:34:18] represent the great heaven because it's
[1:34:22] war and troubles and killings and
[1:34:24] fightings and so forth but it did
[1:34:28] represent
[1:34:29] this that it must be a perfect
[1:34:34] walk there's where the church is failing
[1:34:37] today on that
[1:34:40] walk do you know that even your own
[1:34:43] behavior can knock somebody else out of
[1:34:46] getting
[1:34:48] healed your misbehavior of unconfessed
[1:34:51] Sins Of You
[1:34:53] Believers can cause this church to
[1:34:56] bitterly fail and at the day of the
[1:34:58] Judgment you'll be responsible for every
[1:35:00] bit of
[1:35:01] it oh you say now wait a minute brother
[1:35:03] Brandon well that's the
[1:35:06] truth think of it Joshua after he
[1:35:09] crossed over into the land God gave him
[1:35:13] the promise that just think the fight an
[1:35:16] entire
[1:35:18] campaign without losing a man without
[1:35:21] even getting a
[1:35:23] scratch without having to have a nurse
[1:35:25] or a first aid or a
[1:35:29] B God said the land's yours go
[1:35:33] fight think of fighting a campaign and
[1:35:36] there's no Red Cross around at all
[1:35:38] there's nobody going to get hurt and
[1:35:41] they slay the amorites and the haites
[1:35:45] but there wasn't one hurt among any of
[1:35:48] them until sin come in the camp
[1:35:53] and when achen took that Babylonian
[1:35:57] garment and that gold wedge and hid it
[1:36:00] under his
[1:36:01] Camp then the next day they lost 16
[1:36:05] men Joshua he said
[1:36:08] stop
[1:36:09] stop wait a minute there's something
[1:36:14] wrong something's wrong here we're going
[1:36:17] to call seven days of
[1:36:20] fast God made us a promise there will be
[1:36:24] nothing hurt us our enemies will fall at
[1:36:27] our
[1:36:28] feet and there's something wrong
[1:36:32] here something went wrong somewhere
[1:36:35] because we got 16 dead men laying here
[1:36:38] they're Israelite brothers and they're
[1:36:40] dead why did they die innocent man
[1:36:44] because one man stepped out of the
[1:36:50] line
[1:36:53] you see the reason this needs to be
[1:36:54] taught amen the church lining up lining
[1:36:59] up with the word of God Amen lining up
[1:37:02] with God lining up with each other amen
[1:37:05] walking perfectly upright soberly before
[1:37:08] all men fearing
[1:37:10] God because one man stole a garment and
[1:37:14] done something that he should not done
[1:37:16] took the life of 16
[1:37:19] man I think it was 16 maybe more I
[1:37:23] believe it 16 man that was dead Joshua
[1:37:27] called said there's something wrong God
[1:37:30] made the
[1:37:32] promise and something's
[1:37:36] wrong we bring the sick up before us and
[1:37:40] they fail to be healed we need to call a
[1:37:43] solemn
[1:37:44] fast call an
[1:37:46] assembly something's wrong
[1:37:49] somewhere God made the promise God's got
[1:37:52] to stick to that promise and he will do
[1:37:56] it and he called a fast and they found
[1:38:00] out the Castel lots and aen confessed it
[1:38:03] and they killed aen family and all and
[1:38:06] burnt their ashes and left it there for
[1:38:09] a memorial and Joshua went right on
[1:38:12] through the battles taking everything
[1:38:14] without a scratch her
[1:38:16] wound there you
[1:38:18] are one day he had needed a little time
[1:38:22] extra time the sun was going down that
[1:38:25] man couldn't fight very good at night
[1:38:26] time Joshua that great warrior anointed
[1:38:30] of God positionally placed into the land
[1:38:32] like Ephesians to the new church Poss
[1:38:36] possessed the possessing the land taking
[1:38:39] it over he needed some time so he said
[1:38:42] Son stand

[1:46:38] Sauls coming from seminaries and
[1:46:40] Theological schools and going out and
[1:46:43] teaching this perverse things as the
[1:46:45] Bible said they would do seemingly not
[1:46:48] having the faith separating themselves
[1:46:50] from you having no fellowship with you
[1:46:52] and so forth having a farm of godliness
[1:46:56] and denying the power thereof from such
[1:47:01] turnaway they don't know where they come

[2:01:46] before the

[2:01:53] be holy Without Blame before him

[2:02:35] the propitiation of your sins to call
[2:02:38] you to reconciliation to himself to
[2:02:42] love oh wish we had just a few more
[2:02:45] minutes time let me before we go any
[2:02:48] further go back Genesis 1:26 I'll pick
[2:02:51] it up
[2:02:52] Wednesday when God made man before he
[2:02:56] made man he called himself l e l l e l h
[2:03:01] l o l
[2:03:03] oim the word means in the Hebrew the
[2:03:07] self
[2:03:10] existence all by
[2:03:12] himself nothing existed before him he
[2:03:15] was all the existence the ever was self
[2:03:19] existence
[2:03:21] on L
[2:03:24] Elohim means all sufficient all
[2:03:30] powerful allm
[2:03:32] mighty
[2:03:34] self-existence
[2:03:37] one Hallelujah but in Genesis 2 when he
[2:03:40] made man he said I
[2:03:43] am y a h u ju u v u h yah
[2:03:50] Jehovah what did it mean I am the all
[2:03:54] existence one who has created something
[2:03:58] all of myself to be a son of mine or a
[2:04:02] temporary or an amateur little one of
[2:04:11] mine why he gave
[2:04:14] man Jehovah means that he gave man to be
[2:04:18] an amateur
[2:04:20] God because he is Father God and he made
[2:04:24] a man an amateur God so he isn't
[2:04:27] self-existence anymore he exists with
[2:04:29] his
[2:04:33] family
[2:04:34] Hallelujah el el
[2:04:37] Elohim now now he is Jehovah Jehovah
[2:04:42] meaning the one who exists with his
[2:04:46] family now God made man to be the
[2:04:51] predominant over all the Earth he had
[2:04:54] dominion and the Earth was man's
[2:04:57] Dominion is that
[2:04:59] scripture then if that's his domain he
[2:05:01] was God over the
[2:05:04] Earth he could speak it it would be so
[2:05:07] he could speak this and it would be
[2:05:10] so amen there he is god
[2:05:15] Jehovah the one who once existed
[2:05:19] in self-existence but now exist with his
[2:05:22] family and his little ones with
[2:05:25] him amen there you are

[2:08:49] Healer Hallelujah while there was
[2:08:52] nothing to save and nothing to

[2:09:04] display in here of him that he would be
[2:09:07] a savior that he would come and be made

[2:09:26] world Amen thank you Jesus listen to
[2:09:30] this
[2:09:32] predestination looks back to for
[2:09:35] knowledge I mean
[2:09:36] election election looks back to for
[2:09:40] knowledge and predestination looks to
[2:09:43] Destiny don't forget that that election
[2:09:48] looks back here here it is I was a
[2:09:50] cockle bir I was born in sin shaped in
[2:09:54] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[2:09:55] born among Sinners father and mother and
[2:09:58] all my whole family Sinners I was a

[2:10:04] wheat
[2:10:05] grain how did it happen uh that what is
[2:10:09] that election God before the foundation
[2:10:13] of the world elected that the CER was to
[2:10:16] become a grain of
[2:10:18] now I know I'm a grain of wheat because
[2:10:20] I'm saved how do I do it look back and
[2:10:22] see that he predestinated it long time
[2:10:27] ago by for knowledge he seemed that I
[2:10:29] would love him so he made a propitiation
[2:10:31] through his own son that through him I
[2:10:34] might become from a of bird to a
[2:10:36] grain of wheat now where am I at now I'm

[2:10:46] where will he take me to and where am I
[2:10:49] going that's got you there you are now
[2:10:53] let's read just a little farther and
[2:10:55] then we'll have to close pretty
[2:10:57] shortly according as he chose us in him
[2:11:01] before the foundation of the world that
[2:11:03] we should be holy Without Blame before
[2:11:06] him in love
[2:11:09] having
[2:11:11] predestinated
[2:11:12] us unto the
[2:11:15] adoption predestinated unto the adoption
[2:11:18] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[2:11:22] according to the good pleasure of his
[2:11:26] will what did he do he by for
[2:11:30] knowledge foresaw us knowing that he was
[2:11:36] a
[2:11:37] savior
[2:11:39] self-existence there was no Angels no
[2:11:42] nothing just God L Elohim the
[2:11:46] self-existence one nothing but him alone
[2:11:49] but in him
[2:11:52] was a
[2:11:54] savior amen well what he go to save
[2:11:57] there's nothing
[2:11:59] lost knowing that then he know that this
[2:12:03] great attribute in him would project
[2:12:06] something out under that he could save
[2:12:09] then when he did that by four knowledge
[2:12:12] he looked down and he saw everyone that
[2:12:15] would accept it yes
[2:12:18] and then by doing so he said to save
[2:12:22] that the only way I can do it will be
[2:12:24] come down myself and be made flesh and
[2:12:27] take the sin of the man upon him and die
[2:12:30] for him that I might be the one that's
[2:12:32] worshiped because he is God the object
[2:12:35] of worship amen then he came down and
[2:12:38] taken up on himself and while he did
[2:12:40] that he did that that he might save you
[2:12:45] who wants to be saved
[2:12:49] praise the Lord do you see what I
[2:12:51] mean by for knowledge amen the infinite
[2:12:56] God who know all things saw the lamb and
[2:13:01] he slayed the lamb before the foundation
[2:13:03] of the world and he put your name on the
[2:13:06] Lamb's Book of Life and he seen the
[2:13:08] deceitfulness of Satan what he would do
[2:13:11] so he put your name on there and he said
[2:13:13] that the Antichrist would be so
[2:13:15] religious so good such a fine fellow
[2:13:19] such a smart man such a religious man
[2:13:23] that he would deceive that very elected
[2:13:26] if it was possible but it isn't
[2:13:29] impossible because her names were for
[2:13:32] ordained before the foundation of the
[2:13:35] world by election he chose them and by
[2:13:39] predestination they know where they are
[2:13:43] going there you
[2:13:45] are now who could doubt that that's what
[2:13:48] Paul said that's Paul's
[2:13:53] scripture that's Paul's writing that's
[2:13:56] what he taught his church the church
[2:14:00] positionally before the foundation of
[2:14:02] the world when God in his labor pain was
[2:14:06] bringing forth bringing forth you
[2:14:10] knowing what you would do he

[2:14:15] body amen to be a
[2:14:19] housewife to be a farmer to be a
[2:14:22] preacher to be a prophet to be this or
[2:14:25] to be that he placed you positionally
[2:14:28] then when we have come from the garlic
[2:14:31] lands of Egypt through sanctification
[2:14:34] and baptized into the promised land for
[2:14:37] the promise of God is the Holy Ghost
[2:14:41] amen Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the
[2:14:44] holy spirit of God whereby you are SE
[2:14:48] until the day of your Redemption

[2:14:55] church he said and all the peoples there
[2:14:59] will be Millions times millions that
[2:15:02] will walk very religious and be
[2:15:06] deceived the only ones that will not be
[2:15:09] deceived will be those that have come
[2:15:11] over into the promised land who before
[2:15:14] the foundation of the world had their
[2:15:16] names put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:15:18] and come over into the promised land and

[2:17:15] afraid that somebody would say now he's
[2:17:17] them tongues guys they're afraid to come
[2:17:20] to the church to be baptized in the name
[2:17:22] of Jesus Christ because they're ashamed
[2:17:24] of
[2:17:26] it
[2:17:28] oh somebody said I have to recall my
[2:17:31] tapes because I preached you been
[2:17:34] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I
[2:17:36] ain't recalling him I'm making more amen
[2:17:38] that's
[2:17:39] right making more that is the Bible if
[2:17:44] they don't like what we did yesterday
[2:17:45] this watch what we're going to do
[2:17:46] tomorrow that's the thing to do just
[2:17:50] keep on going there's no end to it
[2:17:52] because it is of the lord it's God you
[2:17:57] know what God did God looked down out of
[2:17:59] the heaven and said David you're a man
[2:18:02] after my own heart
[2:18:04] amen David wasn't
[2:18:07] ashamed he was a servant of the Lord he
[2:18:11] loved the Lord and he was so happy so
[2:18:14] Overjoyed though he didn't think about
[2:18:16] human pre
[2:18:18] you see as I said in my sermon this
[2:18:20] morning we are so much afraid that we
[2:18:23] want a Saul to teach us we want a saw
[2:18:26] from some Seminary to tell us how we
[2:18:28] must do our religion and how we must do
[2:18:30] it that is on the other side of the
[2:18:34] Jordan this side the Holy Spirit
[2:18:38] leads over here you're out of that M
[2:18:42] over here you don't care what they think
[2:18:45] over here you're dead in your life is
[2:18:48] hid in Christ suit and sealed by the
[2:18:50] holy
[2:18:51] ghosten you don't care you're living in
[2:18:56] Canaan you can stand good corn you're a
[2:19:00] new creature in Christ Jesus you're
[2:19:03] bound for the promised
[2:19:05] land I remember standing y brother
[2:19:09] Collins some 30 years
[2:19:13] ago when this church wasn't built yet
[2:19:16] there's a little tent meeting sitting
[2:19:18] here on the corner my first
[2:19:20] meeting I was preaching this same
[2:19:25] gospel same thing The unsearchable
[2:19:29] Riches of Christ water baptism in the
[2:19:32] name of Jesus Christ believing every
[2:19:35] word to be the truth baptism of the Holy
[2:19:37] Ghost Divine Healing the powers of God
[2:19:39] just like I preach it now never varied
[2:19:42] one inch from any of it God revealed
[2:19:45] more of it to me so as he reveals it I
[2:19:47] just keep bringing it on he never takes
[2:19:49] away from what has been he just keeps
[2:19:51] adding more on to
[2:19:53] it I stood down there when about 500
[2:19:56] people stood on the
[2:19:58] banks singing on Jordan stormy Banks I
[2:20:02] standing cast The Wishful eye to
[2:20:05] canaan's fair and Happy Land where my
[2:20:08] possessions lie When shall I reach that
[2:20:12] helpful Shore and be forever blessed
[2:20:14] When shall I reach be my father fathers
[2:20:18] and forever rest when they begin to sing
[2:20:21] that I was taking a boy out into the
[2:20:23] river to baptize him out there into the
[2:20:26] name of the Lord Jesus I said Heavenly
[2:20:28] fathers I bring this boy to you upon his
[2:20:31] confession just a boy
[2:20:34] myself got the pictures of it at home I
[2:20:37] said when I baptize him with water lord
[2:20:39] upon his confession in the name of Jesus
[2:20:42] Christ the son of God you filling with
[2:20:44] the Holy Ghost about that time something
[2:20:47] l out a whirl and hear it come whirling
[2:20:50] down the bright and morning Stars stood
[2:20:54] there there stood that light that you
[2:20:56] see right there on the picture there it
[2:20:59] stood it went around the world way up in
[2:21:01] Canada and around it that a Mystic light
[2:21:03] appears over a local Baptist Minister
[2:21:06] while he's baptizing a few days ago and
[2:21:08] Dr lsza come to me and never know
[2:21:11] nothing about that brought me a picture
[2:21:13] which Brothers got it there with him now
[2:21:15] if you got that picture if you got the
[2:21:16] Bible with you there is in your book all
[2:21:19] right there was a picture of the old
[2:21:21] ancient Hebrew sign of God just exactly
[2:21:26] that that existed in the days of job
[2:21:28] before the Bible was ever WR amen God
[2:21:31] and his three attributes not three Gods
[2:21:34] one God and three attributes Father Son
[2:21:37] and Holy Spirit three offices that God
[2:21:39] worked into not three Gods three
[2:21:43] attributes and there was that great man
[2:21:45] Dr LS of the translation of the lmes of
[2:21:48] Bible when he said that morning when I
[2:21:50] told him that I said I said what's that
[2:21:52] sign he said that's God's ancient sign
[2:21:55] the Hebrew God one God in three
[2:21:58] attributes I said such as Father Son and
[2:22:01] the Holy Ghost he stopped and he set his
[2:22:04] cup of coffee down he looked at me Jean
[2:22:07] believe you was there
[2:22:09] Leo said you believe that I said with
[2:22:12] all my
[2:22:14] heart he said last night standing in
[2:22:16] your meeting brother brandham I've seen
[2:22:18] that discernment I've never seen it
[2:22:20] before in America in my land he said
[2:22:22] these American people don't even know
[2:22:24] the Bible only thing they know is a
[2:22:26] denomination they don't even know where
[2:22:27] they're standing said they don't know
[2:22:30] nothing he said but when I stood there
[2:22:33] last night said I said I brother Gan I
[2:22:35] say this with reverence and love and
[2:22:39] such he said I said that must be a
[2:22:42] prophet but when I see that you believe
[2:22:45] that father Son and Holy Ghost ghost was
[2:22:47] no three Gods it was attributes then I
[2:22:50] know that you are a prophet of God or it
[2:22:52] wouldn't be revealed to you like that he
[2:22:53] said that's a perfect sign said I've
[2:22:56] never said you're not Oneness I said no
[2:22:58] sir I am not the Oneness I believe in
[2:23:01] God being the almighty God and the three
[2:23:04] attributes are only three offices that
[2:23:06] the one God lived in he said bless your
[2:23:09] heart he said someday you'll pour your
[2:23:12] blood upon the Earth for that but said
[2:23:14] prophets always die for their cause now
[2:23:17] said so let it be if it pleases my Lord
[2:23:21] the translation of the ls of the Bible
[2:23:24] oh it is so true how many times do I say
[2:23:28] to this church as Samuel said before the
[2:23:31] chose Saul before you go out and join
[2:23:33] some denomination now and get yourself
[2:23:36] all tied up in some kind of a religion
[2:23:38] why don't you let the Holy Spirit lead
[2:23:40] you why don't you take God for your
[2:23:43] leader let him bless you and forget
[2:23:46] about your denomination now I'm not
[2:23:48] saying don't belong to any denomination
[2:23:51] a church you belong to anyone you want
[2:23:53] to that's up to you but I'm telling you
[2:23:55] as an individual you let the Holy Spirit
[2:23:58] lead you you read the Bible and what the
[2:24:01] Bible says do you do it God bless you
[2:24:04] and I've waited a long time I wonder if
[2:24:07] there's any here that want to come
[2:24:08] through the prayer line to be prayed for
[2:24:10] if they are would they raise your hands
[2:24:11] just one two three all right yall come
[2:24:15] right up here and stand here and if you
[2:24:17] wish to at this time and and uh we'll
[2:24:20] have prayer and then we're I don't want
[2:24:22] you to leave yet I want to officially do
[2:24:25] something else here just before we we
[2:24:27] close how many likes the study of the
[2:24:29] book of Galatians oh I mean Ephesians
[2:24:33] now Wednesday night we're going to go

[2:24:40] morning we're going into the
[2:24:42] positionally placing the
[2:24:45] church all if we'll probably get in on
[2:24:49] that on this coming Wednesday night to
[2:24:52] you people here in Jeff positionally
[2:24:56] placing the church where they
[2:24:59] belong amen each one how we're called by
[2:25:03] the
[2:25:03] adoption God has adopted us Unto the
[2:25:07] Sons we are Sons by birth adopted and
[2:25:11] positionally placed by the Holy Spirit
[2:25:14] look they were every one Hebrews when
[2:25:16] the cross the river but Joshua divided
[2:25:20] the land and give each one his land
[2:25:23] according to the utterance of his mother
[2:25:25] at the birth where the Holy Spirit told
[2:25:27] him look at Jacob when he was dying a
[2:25:30] prophet
[2:25:32] blinded pulled his feet up into the bed
[2:25:36] said come forth ye sons of Jacob and
[2:25:39] I'll tell you where you'll be at the
[2:25:41] last day oh amen praise the
[2:25:45] Lord
[2:25:47] oh I know I may seem strange the people
[2:25:51] may seem strange but oh if you only knew
[2:25:53] the the Assurance the they're burning in
[2:25:57] the heart amen come forth and I'll tell
[2:26:00] you where you'll be in the last
[2:26:03] days and I can take that same scripture
[2:26:07] and take the map of where the Jews are
[2:26:10] setting today and prove to you they're
[2:26:12] exactly on the same spot that Jacob said
[2:26:15] they'd be in the last day
[2:26:18] and they never did there haven't been on
[2:26:20] that spot until they returned since May
[2:26:23] the 7th
[2:26:25] 1946 the night the angel of the Lord
[2:26:27] appeared to me up there and said for
[2:26:28] this Mission amen and I can show you
[2:26:31] that when they come back into the new
[2:26:32] land they struck exactly the spots where
[2:26:35] Jacob said they would be setting and
[2:26:36] there they are sitting there today glory
[2:26:38] to God
[2:26:40] oh my oh
[2:26:43] my we're one day near home is all

[2:27:10] said this morning David didn't have
[2:27:13] nothing but a little
[2:27:14] slingshot but he said I know what it'll
[2:27:17] do with the power of God on it see I

[2:27:38] ask my brother to come here and anoint
[2:27:40] him with all what you do that sir I'll
[2:27:43] ask the church if you bow in prayer I

[2:52:00] what an
[2:52:01] atmosphere what a moving of the Holy
[2:52:04] Spirit to follow the word of
[2:52:08] [Music]
[2:52:09] God through that star in the right hand
[2:52:12] of God in the person of his Prophet who
[2:52:16] took the scriptures and shun the light
[2:52:20] as revealed to him the son of man veiled
[2:52:24] in a son of man speaking words that
[2:52:26] through these words that are promised as
[2:52:30] seed we could be partakers of his divine
[2:52:33] nature and could have access to Divine
[2:52:36] Authority have access to presence have
[2:52:39] access to very deity himself being able
[2:52:42] to be present in our hearts can we thank
[2:52:44] the Lord one more time for his grace his
[2:52:49] mercy and I'm so blown away by how God
[2:52:54] and random said it on this side of
[2:52:56] Jordan is the holy spirit leading we
[2:52:58] have not been this way before but it's
[2:53:00] the Holy Spirit every service last
[2:53:03] Wednesday the pastor stood he couldn't
[2:53:04] even finish his message because the Lord
[2:53:06] had him to say certain things about
[2:53:08] anointing the word and then to see
[2:53:10] brother Kelly out speak last Friday
[2:53:11] brother Kelly God bless you I was so
[2:53:13] blessed
[2:53:15] to see God use you in such a mighty way
[2:53:19] and to see it all tie together from even
[2:53:21] the message last Sunday with Jeremiah
[2:53:23] into the message last Wednesday into
[2:53:25] brother Kelly and now to hear the
[2:53:26] prophet speaking about being
[2:53:28] positionally placed your part in the
[2:53:30] body whether it's a housewife whether
[2:53:32] it's a preacher whether it's a prophet
[2:53:34] whatever it's supposed to be God in his
[2:53:36] great riches and his mercy and his
[2:53:38] predestination and his for knowledge
[2:53:40] knew you'd be here and no demon could
[2:53:42] stop it no devil could stop it your past
[2:53:45] can stop it your mistakes can stop it
[2:53:47] nothing present nothing past that to
[2:53:50] come to separate you from that great
[2:53:52] High Calling oh what a joy to be a
[2:53:54] Christian in such a time as this and the
[2:53:57] atmosphere in the church as a tape being
[2:53:59] played but over it said back then they
[2:54:01] weren't shouting but in here this
[2:54:03] morning the shout of the king is in the
[2:54:05] camp and this word is just as real just
[2:54:08] as the Holy Ghost is just as real to us
[2:54:10] today this tape this word is alive and
[2:54:14] in the days of the voice of that seven
[2:54:16] Angel when he shall begin to sound the
[2:54:18] mystery is finished so we are worshiping
[2:54:21] knowing the mystery is finished knowing
[2:54:23] every mystery is revealed knowing our
[2:54:26] names are written and knowing that all
[2:54:28] is in order God is in control and the
[2:54:30] devil can't stop it I love something the
[2:54:33] prophet said he was speaking with David
[2:54:35] dancing with the Y coming and he said if
[2:54:38] you're bothered by what you see today
[2:54:39] wait till tomorrow oh God Lord help me
[2:54:42] this morning if what you see today as
[2:54:45] you worried wait till tomorrow because
[2:54:48] this Joy I have the world cannot take it
[2:54:50] away this peace I have and listen David
[2:54:54] had his ups and his downs and his
[2:54:55] victories and his defeats but when he
[2:54:57] saw the AR coming up the road he's oh
[2:55:00] mind what a joy in his soul and that's a
[2:55:03] joy we feel this morning give the Lord

[3:04:03] Germany conventions last year August and
[3:04:06] how the Lord moved Mally and just about
[3:04:08] two weeks ago to be in Germany once
[3:04:11] again and to see how God is
[3:04:13] using the church in Germany and how he's
[3:04:16] using with the stephanus and I know he's
[3:04:19] going to be a tremendous blessing to the
[3:04:21] church he has a true burden and he's
[3:04:23] coming with a burden and I know he's
[3:04:25] coming because the lord gave him
[3:04:27] something to come with he's not coming
[3:04:29] because he feeling to come or he just
[3:04:31] wants to come and but I know the Lord
[3:04:33] has spoken to his heart and these are
[3:04:36] this is the way that God moves with the
[3:04:38] body cuz it's one body and is a body is
[3:04:41] a universal mystical body body where
[3:04:44] each part of the body is supplying
[3:04:46] something for the body so we are so
[3:04:48] grateful to the love gifts that God has
[3:04:50] placed in the body that we could be
[3:04:52] blessed so I want to encourage you to
[3:04:55] stay in prayer stay in preparation and
[3:04:57] you know spread the word around that God
[3:04:59] is doing something he's doing something
[3:05:01] real in our hearts he's doing something
[3:05:03] real in our lives and he's in the
[3:05:05] process of transformation and we're
[3:05:06] looking for you know lies to be born
[3:05:09] into the kingdom and transformed even
[3:05:12] before that meeting but but I have great
[3:05:14] expectations for what God will do during
[3:05:16] those Easter meetings can the church say
[3:05:18] amen amen maintenance team group one
[3:05:21] please meet with brother popwell after
[3:05:23] the service and next week group three is
[3:05:26] carded to serve and there's a special
[3:05:29] note that we want all the team members
[3:05:31] who were part of the various teams to
[3:05:34] meet with your respective team leaders
[3:05:36] for a maintenance update and we really
[3:05:39] want to express our deepest gratitude to
[3:05:42] all of the Believers
[3:05:44] and you heard it from mother Kelly sa
[3:05:45] he's not even here but he's identified
[3:05:47] with the work because it is an important
[3:05:49] work making preparation for the word of
[3:05:52] God to be brought from the sacred desk
[3:05:55] we we really want to thank and extend
[3:05:56] our deepest gratitude to all of the
[3:05:59] Believers who are part of the various
[3:06:01] teams and the maintainers of the
[3:06:03] Tabernacle may God richly bless you this
[3:06:05] is from groups I believe 1 to five and
[3:06:08] we also solicit more support for the
[3:06:10] various groups um in whatever way you
[3:06:13] could contribute we invite you speak
[3:06:14] with brother Stephen oliv our
[3:06:17] administrative Elder if you're
[3:06:18] interested in being part of a group and
[3:06:21] sometimes with different schedules
[3:06:22] different ones can't make it on
[3:06:23] different things so we really solicit
[3:06:25] all of the support into making this body
[3:06:28] and this operation here moves smoothly
[3:06:31] so uh we also want to remind you of the
[3:06:34] upcoming convention uh in July we the
[3:06:37] countdown is own we just suff about
[3:06:39] about 4 months of being able to make
[3:06:42] contributions and an input before the
[3:06:44] convention in July so we continue to
[3:06:46] solicit both your prayers and your
[3:06:48] financial support so that we'll be in a
[3:06:51] position to have a wonderful time we
[3:06:54] truly don't know how much time we have
[3:06:55] left and there's something that's moving
[3:06:57] that is undeniable and the closer we get
[3:07:00] to that time we'll have different kinds
[3:07:02] of services knowing that God has to cut
[3:07:04] the work
[3:07:05] short he promis to cut the work short
[3:07:08] for the elect because if you don't cut
[3:07:11] the work short for the elect nobody
[3:07:12] going to make it I want us to process
[3:07:15] that for a minute he has to cut the work
[3:07:17] short for the elic because the devil the
[3:07:20] Bible said the devil knows that his time
[3:07:22] is short so we had a very short time to
[3:07:25] do all we could do for the kingdom of
[3:07:27] God so may God richly bless you may you
[3:07:31] practice the presence of God may you
[3:07:33] stay in the presence of God and and
[3:07:35] there are so many ways you know and um
[3:07:37] it's it's so interesting last communion
[3:07:40] service uh brother play the the table
[3:07:43] tape of the prophet and in that he made
[3:07:45] that reference to putting the cross in
[3:07:47] his car and I've always used that with
[3:07:48] the young people to say that if the
[3:07:50] prophet of God would put a cross in his
[3:07:52] car so that when the woman on the street
[3:07:55] around he would look at the cross he had
[3:07:57] his own system if I could use that to
[3:08:00] protect himself and this is this is not
[3:08:02] a man on the street this is a prophet
[3:08:04] not just a prophet but a messenger to an
[3:08:06] age not just a messenger to an age but
[3:08:09] the greatest since Paul was on the earth
[3:08:10] not just the greatest but a star in the
[3:08:12] right hand of God and he was put in
[3:08:14] mechanism in place to protect his walk
[3:08:16] on the earth so I want to encourage you
[3:08:18] practice the presence of God if you have
[3:08:21] the message app on your phone you know
[3:08:23] you could listen to it you could you you
[3:08:25] you could choose what music you listen
[3:08:27] to you could choose to listen to
[3:08:28] scriptures there time I'm driving and
[3:08:29] I'm listening to scriptures the time I'm
[3:08:31] driving and listening to the prophet's
[3:08:32] message it changes your hope your
[3:08:35] desires your thinking the Bible said be
[3:08:37] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[3:08:40] what you feed on what you eat on that is
[3:08:42] what you become so I want to really
[3:08:44] encourage you you want to see your walk
[3:08:46] change your talk change your life change
[3:08:48] eat differently feed your mind
[3:08:50] differently look at different things and
[3:08:51] you'll see it move from the inside to
[3:08:53] the outside so may the Lord richly bless
[3:08:56] you we love you we appreciate you and
[3:08:58] may God give you a blessed week brother
