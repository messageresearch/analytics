turn our Bibles now you may go Oh bless your the Internet man we want to turn over now to Genesis chapter 1 a man we want to read from verse 26 [Music] it also finds our marker Joshua chapter 13 and also Romans 8:15 demon all right Genesis 1:1 or each one who is 26 says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl he is and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and walk less than God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth amen so now tell him over to Joshua chapter 13 he mana was still in Joshua man please God and please God does the first three verses dear I'm gonna read in John 4:13 so from one it says now Joshua was old and stricken in years and the Lord said unto him thou art old and stricken in years and they remain it yet very much lamb to be possessed this is the land that yet remaining all the borders of the Philistines and all the fury from psy Hall which is before Egypt even unto the borders of ektron northward which is counted to the Canaanite five Lords of the Philistines and Gaza tights and the ash ash dog tags and Escalade lights and guitars and echo nights and also the events now telling lastly wanted to into rumors eat fries go pick up our anointing here on Romans 8:15 for his garden then we see another would pray so it's Romans 8 wanna read from verse 15 and it says for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God we got a blessing through his way let's bow hands one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you this morning Lord Father for your grease that has brought us true Lord we thank you for your knowing that you're pleased upon your sons in this hour Lord father the power about to release the load father to drive out the Philistines gone they're gone we pray this morning Lord that your anointing drop down and especially this morning Lord Mayor anoint your word Lord Lord you are the author of it Lord odda only you could do justice it this morning by your spirit Lord father breaking the word to each heart and life here today Lord it would be the most powerful thing if every individual in here this morning get a personal revelation of their mountain to possess so far we pray O Holy Spirit come down especially take me out of the way Lord father I am nothing in thy presence ooh God Lord take my vocal cords and use them for the honor and glory of God may no one leave the same way they come immediately with a personal desire Commission Lord

things I love about Joshua the Jordano set a murmuring and complaining an exodus you only hear any people mowers the people complain mood is titled off cause tell Moses the People Mover and they

many men who my wonderful deal of in this morning a man that was my of my background coat amen I'm not ready to preach a man praise God a man but I was thought I wanted to dwell on this word Dominion and then some thoughts that come out of these scriptures that we read especially concerning Joshua so am I now possession and if you look up the word possession it means the state of having owning or controlling something that's what possession means it's a state of heaven it's a state of owning it's a state of controlling something possession is not talking about it possession is not talking about the land you can't talk about the land please gonna do that you don't have you've got to have it to show it you've got to have it revealed so here it is here it is if you don't have that then

your key often is don't you stop don't turn around like love life don't turn around to the world I say the world's not only for you know you keep your eye on the prize but let your heart overthrow you but keep your eyes for what Evan let your pants lightly packet at the knees do some neologism cheek / Parapan said prayer without ceasing until one of these virtues are living inside of you when you

that's what it's about that's what it's about Amon my leman so we talked about overcoming what is overcoming to overcome definition is to defeat another in a competition or conflict to surmount the opposition and to be victorious so we know it's not against flesh and blood but again take it against principalities and it's against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places so Allah the devil does not want you to know who you really are he doesn't want you to possess your land because if you ever get into your position but a parent set
