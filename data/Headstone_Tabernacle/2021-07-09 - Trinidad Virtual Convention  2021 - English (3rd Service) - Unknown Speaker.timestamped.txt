[29:16] amen says god bless you we bring you
[29:19] greetings
[29:20] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[29:36] [Music]
[29:39] so so we give we all
[29:42] give god praise we give more times for
[29:44] the invitation
[29:46] it's a great privilege to be invited to
[29:49] say something
[29:50] in this virtual conversation the
[29:53] inspiration for the convention
[29:54] is ephesians and ephesians is out of
[29:58] alignment
[29:59] and in 53 or 325
[30:02] 52 the prophet says at the end of it
[30:06] ephesians paul is addressing ephesians 1
[30:10] directly straight to the shoulder
[30:13] to the church that's what he's doing
[30:16] this is not for babies
[30:17] this is for grown-ups not for babies
[30:20] so i want to use that a little
[30:22] inspiration
[30:24] for migrating here this afternoon
[30:27] directly
[30:28] straight to the shoulder not for babies
[30:31] so babies we are pumpers but
[30:36] [Music]
[30:38] in the beginning you say where were you
[30:42] when
[30:42] i had the foundation here you said good
[30:45] afternoons and talk to me like
[30:48] so paul is carrying a believer about
[30:52] ephesians 1 which talks about
[30:54] predestination before the foundation
[30:56] occurs
[30:57] so anytime you're going to foundation
[30:59] and predestination
[31:00] that is the right language and that is
[31:03] not for me a reason
[31:04] that uh you may know it intellectually
[31:07] when you commit a message
[31:08] but as you grow brother it becomes a
[31:11] more living reality and gives you the
[31:13] super faith and the super anointing
[31:15] to really handle situations like this
[31:17] part living
[31:18] and what is the community so the bride
[31:20] becomes a super racer super church as
[31:22] she nears the end soon
[31:24] this one in revelation of
[31:26] pre-destination before the foundation of
[31:28] the world
[31:29] and joe was called too good of himself
[31:32] good at his lawyers and much of goodyear
[31:34] who all said in the very feast of us
[31:35] we're good are we going to truth
[31:38] so looking into that direct straight to
[31:41] the shoulder the church
[31:43] brother we see that his shoulder there's
[31:45] a woman that comes in called
[31:47] in the bible in a picture with a bottle
[31:50] of water on her shoulder
[31:51] but abram has sent her away from him
[31:54] away from his house
[31:55] so she's going away from the promised
[31:57] land where ephesians is out of
[31:59] and enter she is going away from and
[32:02] look battle is for herself
[32:04] and her son she represents those in the
[32:06] message she has been there a long time
[32:08] she has a teenage son
[32:09] so that means she has she has had
[32:12] intimacy with abraham
[32:13] she knows the message and so on but it's
[32:16] not a message child she's carrying
[32:18] she's not invited so she is going away
[32:21] from
[32:22] but then there's another woman with a
[32:24] picture on her shoulder
[32:25] and whether she's coming
[32:26] [Applause]
[32:39] and the prophet says that he angel that
[32:42] was coming with
[32:43] eliezer entered for running his
[32:46] reach for the half hour before and he
[32:49] went to prepare rebecca's heart
[32:51] so that she know would make the right
[32:53] decision
[32:54] so you realize that when we talk about
[32:57] direct straight to the shoulder the
[33:00] shoulder
[33:00] cannot be an operation the shoulder is
[33:03] the strongest part of the body
[33:05] but the shoulder is ready when you
[33:07] release from the heart
[33:08] the sole
[33:18] [Applause]
[33:22] so you'll find that jesus when he went
[33:25] he left in 1909 and he went to see that
[33:28] lordship
[33:29] and they said i'm terrified so that
[33:31] shows love from
[33:32] her on terrifying and whatever that
[33:35] means he would go until
[33:37] even though he had an idea like that one
[33:39] meant something the last members comes
[33:40] in
[33:41] so when he got that last one when he got
[33:43] that last one he put it on his shoulder
[33:47] because uh his shoulder has struck his
[33:48] part everybody and came home rejoicing
[33:50] and called out his friends
[33:52] come and rejoice with me so the shoulder
[33:54] represents the abs
[33:56] right so you realize that
[34:00] that by the grace of god the shoulder
[34:03] represents
[34:04] in the heart not an intellectual
[34:06] faith
[34:07] but a faith that is brutally heard from
[34:09] a predestinated gene
[34:11] that you were recorded and that is why
[34:14] you are here now to
[34:15] express god and if he's happy so
[34:18] all the preaching we look we look at
[34:22] rebecca and her heart was prepared he
[34:24] probably said he came to us hooked up at
[34:26] a fair creator so with the pressure on
[34:29] her shoulder without this heart contact
[34:31] she would never give that old man that
[34:33] water but then
[34:35] she was prepared and the angel turned
[34:38] up terry well now when she goes anywhere
[34:40] the old man is there
[34:42] he made a request and brothers says
[34:46] you have to make up your mind who you're
[34:48] going to fellowship with
[34:49] so she decided the danger from the heart
[34:53] provider to have fellowship with his old
[34:55] mother that's how she end up
[34:57] swimming in the water so her bottle what
[35:00] her picture
[35:01] was to be put in service because eternal
[35:04] life is living forever
[35:05] it is a love gift whereas all works for
[35:08] herself
[35:10] and that perish all she ended up with is
[35:12] a natural will
[35:14] but uh
[35:16] [Applause]
[35:25] [Applause]
[35:35] [Applause]
[35:37] [Music]
[35:38] [Applause]
[35:43] so dwell between the shoulders when
[35:46] trustworthy
[35:47] is a lot of them in joshua 18 11.
[35:51] joshua says uh benjamin shall dwell
[35:54] between judah and joseph so judah joseph
[35:59] turned out to be his shoulders judah is
[36:01] the chief ruler
[36:02] and joseph is the one with the double
[36:03] person the genealogy not being reckoned
[36:05] after a good fight
[36:07] not return in the eyes so judah is a
[36:10] is
[36:12] [Applause]
[36:20] perfection before trump nation walking
[36:23] seven steps to perfection
[36:31] [Music]
[36:38] so it is between revelation and the
[36:40] other we live in their lives we have
[36:41] been
[36:42] was living at the end of it is attacked
[36:44] by the right that germany is in southern
[36:46] right now the brightest quarters have
[36:47] the right kind of world
[36:49] so ah what they
[36:52] see like
[37:00] so benjamin is delivered to dwell to
[37:03] dwell
[37:04] not to be just sometimes not to come and
[37:06] go and visit like a holiday but a dwell
[37:08] between
[37:09] judah and joseph so that is a revolution
[37:13] except
[37:14] uh when you look at the kenneth's in
[37:16] churches one the connects
[37:17] left and they were dwelling with judah
[37:20] and judah
[37:28] [Music]
[37:30] [Applause]
[37:35] came typing his squeeze and tribulation
[37:37] coming in that battle there
[37:39] in a judge's form brother yaya who is
[37:42] evan's wife
[37:43] who was a candidate was able to call him
[37:46] she wasn't afraid because
[37:47] judah goes forward
[37:50] [Applause]
[37:57] [Music]
[38:00] so she was dwelling with judah so
[38:18] turning their back on their father's
[38:20] nakedness and
[38:22] showing that from their heart they are
[38:24] turned away from immorality
[38:26] and pornography and they put the garbage
[38:29] on their shoulders so the shoulder come
[38:32] [Applause]
[38:45] so reference as i preach here in the
[38:47] name of the lord jesus christ
[38:48] the government is laid upon his shoulder

[48:51] lord jesus christ
[48:53] and we should definitely shake your
[48:54] hands after service
[48:56] praise god so first peter 4 verse 12
[49:02] he said beloved think it no strange
[49:04] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[49:06] try you
[49:08] as though some strange thing has
[49:09] happened to you
[49:11] but rejoice in as much as you are
[49:13] partakers of christ's suffering
[49:15] that when his glory shall be revealed ye
[49:18] may be glad
[49:19] also with exceeding joy if ye be
[49:22] reproached for the name of christ happy
[49:24] i.e
[49:25] for the spirit of glory and of god
[49:27] rested upon you
[49:29] and on their part it is evil spoke
[49:31] enough but on your part he is glorified
[49:35] but let none of you suffer as a murderer
[49:37] or as a thief or as an evil doer
[49:40] as a or as a busy body in other men's
[49:43] matters
[49:44] yet if any man suffer as a christian let
[49:46] him not be ashamed
[49:48] let him glorify god on this behalf
[49:52] praise god amen romans
[49:55] 8 15.
[49:58] for we have not received the spirit of
[50:01] bondage again to fear
[50:03] but ye have received the spirit of
[50:04] adoption whereby we cry our father
[50:08] praise god for the spirit is a bearers
[50:10] witness with our spirit
[50:12] that we are children of god oh what a
[50:14] blessed world
[50:16] the spirit better witness with our
[50:17] spirit that we are children of god
[50:20] praise god and if children then ask
[50:23] as of god and join us with christ
[50:26] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[50:30] may be glorified also together
[50:32] for i reckon that the suffering of these
[50:35] present times
[50:36] are not worthy to be compared with the
[50:38] glory which shall reveal
[50:40] in us praise god it's gonna be revealed
[50:42] in you now
[50:44] hallelujah for the endless expectation
[50:46] of the creature waited
[50:48] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[50:51] praise be the name of the lord in our
[50:55] last scripture reading is ephesians 5
[50:57] verse 13
[50:58] he said but all things that are reproved
[51:01] are made manifest by the light
[51:03] and whatsoever the word make manifest is
[51:06] light
[51:07] wherefore he said awake thou that
[51:09] slippet and arise from the dead
[51:11] and christ shall give the light see then
[51:14] that he walks conspectfully not as fools
[51:17] but as wise redeeming the time because
[51:21] the days are
[51:22] evil wherefore be not unwise but
[51:25] understanding what is the will what the
[51:28] will
[51:29] of the lord is praise god
[51:32] may the lord have a blessing to renew
[51:34] his word you may be seated this morning
[51:37] praise god so i want to take a title
[51:40] from what we have read
[51:42] amen because he's talking about
[51:45] something we should not fear trials
[51:49] we should not fear temptations praise
[51:51] god and we have not received the spirit
[51:53] of bondage to fear
[51:55] he's a special people now that this is
[51:58] talking to
[51:59] praise god amen but we have received the
[52:02] spirit of adoption
[52:04] whereby we cry our father
[52:07] praise god amen
[52:11] oh you love him today hallelujah
[52:15] praise god so to this morning i want to
[52:19] take a title sons
[52:20] of the original word hallelujah
[52:24] sons of the original word we have not
[52:27] received the spirit of bondage to fear
[52:30] those sons they are born sons they are
[52:33] filled sons they are tried sons they've
[52:36] overcome the enemy
[52:37] they've overcome every trial that is put
[52:39] on their way
[52:40] because god gave them power to overcome
[52:43] and we have received a spirit of freedom
[52:46] a spirit of liberty
[52:47] because whosoever the son of man are set
[52:50] free is free indeed
[52:52] and we are free indeed today we are sons
[52:55] of the original world
[52:56] so what that word was in that ephesians
[52:58] church age we shall produce the same
[53:01] power
[53:02] we shall produce the same life we shall
[53:04] produce the same spirit
[53:07] oh blessed be the name of a living god
[53:10] hallelujah so we are sons of the
[53:12] original word
[53:14] and my subject is by me praise god buy
[53:17] me gold
[53:18] tried by fire because these sons must be
[53:21] tried
[53:22] they must be tested they must be proven
[53:25] praise
[53:26] god but peter said behold think it no
[53:29] strength containing those fiery trials
[53:32] brother they are going to come in double
[53:34] portion but we are standing by the
[53:36] dynamics of the holy spirit
[53:38] we are not afraid because we are called
[53:40] and tried by fire
[53:42] praise be the name of a living god amen
[53:46] and i want to take my inspiration with
[53:47] the inspiration of the meeting
[53:49] amen the dispensation of ephesians the
[53:52] bride's journey to perfection
[53:54] praise be the name of a living god amen
[53:58] amen
[53:59] we thank god for his grace so many
[54:02] couldn't see this day
[54:04] but god put us here for the papers not
[54:06] just to walk the world
[54:08] but to prove his word because ephesians
[54:11] is that proven seal of the bride
[54:13] whatever you might do you might speak
[54:15] with tongues
[54:16] you might jump and shout but you've got
[54:18] to come to ephesians
[54:20] where the love of god must be your heart
[54:22] it must be expressed
[54:24] by this will all men know that you are
[54:26] my disciples
[54:27] because the love of god is in you praise
[54:30] god amen
[54:31] the bible says that how can you say you
[54:33] love god that you don't see
[54:35] praise god you maybe see it you say you
[54:38] love god you don't see
[54:39] him praise god and yet you cannot love
[54:42] your brother you cannot love your sister
[54:44] no it does seem spirit that raised
[54:47] christ from the dead
[54:48] if that same spirit dwells in you is
[54:51] going to quicken your mortal body
[54:53] praise god it will quicken you to love
[54:56] it will quicken you to forgive
[54:57] it will kick you to hold on to the faith
[55:00] praise
[55:00] be the name of a living god amen so i
[55:04] certainly want to see what we can do by
[55:07] the grace of god on our part today
[55:09] amen and i certainly want to salute all
[55:11] the ministers that have gone before me
[55:14] those that are greeted and those that
[55:15] will greet and preach
[55:17] god richly bless you for your messages
[55:20] praise god
[55:21] amen now the inspiration of the
[55:25] convention is another
[55:26] disposition of ephesians and we are
[55:29] promised that there's going to be an
[55:30] official to this journey
[55:32] praise god every promise in the world
[55:35] belongs to the bride
[55:38] hallelujah every promise not one will
[55:41] fail
[55:42] when god told noah there's going to be a
[55:44] rain
[55:45] he instructed him to build the act
[55:48] hallelujah
[55:49] now the act was not the rain but the act
[55:52] was the evidence that
[55:53] was coming for the rain praise god
[55:56] and the promises today are evidence that
[55:59] there's going to be a bride
[56:00] there's going to be perfection there's
[56:02] going to be adoption
[56:03] that we shall be quickened oh blessed be
[56:06] the name of a living god
[56:08] so i don't care where you are being this
[56:10] morning i want to challenge your fate
[56:12] i want to stimulate you today to know
[56:15] that you are sons of the original word
[56:17] praise god peter had an attitude
[56:20] peter had a nature peter had a spirit
[56:23] upon him
[56:24] but jesus said when there are convicted
[56:27] strengthen the brethren
[56:28] peter said come on now do you doubt my
[56:31] faith
[56:32] lord you know i love you i will go with
[56:34] you to the death
[56:35] but jesus said strengthen thou the
[56:37] brethren when thou
[56:38] are converted praise god and jesus said
[56:42] before the cockroach you will determine
[56:44] three times that was believing peter
[56:47] that was check member peter praise god
[56:50] that was a disciple peter
[56:52] praise be the name of a living god but
[56:54] when peter received that spirit
[56:56] when he received that efficient
[56:58] experience when the baptism of the holy
[57:01] ghost caught ahold of peter
[57:02] peter became a new man he stood on the
[57:05] day of pentacles
[57:06] he said this is that this is that that
[57:09] was spoken by the prophet joel
[57:11] they had their ephesians hallelujah and
[57:14] the church was born on that day
[57:16] on the day of pentacles they received
[57:18] another spirit
[57:20] not a spirit of bondage to fear but a
[57:22] spirit of power
[57:23] or spirit of power where they could
[57:26] proclaim the word
[57:27] they could speak the word oh without
[57:29] fear without favor
[57:31] all glory be to the living god sons were
[57:34] born
[57:35] back to the original word sons were born
[57:38] back to the original faith praise god
[57:41] they were not afraid
[57:42] and we are not going to be afraid as
[57:45] long as noah saw the ark he knew the
[57:47] rain was coming
[57:48] the act was a testament that rain was
[57:50] going to fall that god had spoken
[57:53] the act was evidence that noah was
[57:56] already saved
[57:57] and the word of promise is evidence that
[58:00] is coming for the pride
[58:01] that's coming for the pride our pride to
[58:04] perfection
[58:04] our pride to adoption as long as the
[58:07] promise is there
[58:08] there's gonna be a rapture there's gonna
[58:10] be a perfection
[58:11] there's gonna be a pride without spot or
[58:14] wrinkle
[58:15] i don't care where you are paying i
[58:16] don't care what the devil has brought
[58:18] upon you
[58:19] you are under a promise oh hallelujah
[58:23] hallelujah and no devil out of torment
[58:26] can stop the bride
[58:27] we are predestinated not according to
[58:30] our will
[58:31] but according to the will of the father
[58:34] and all those who knew
[58:35] all those he knew he called all those he
[58:38] called it justified
[58:39] all those he justified he was already
[58:42] sanctified
[58:43] he's already glorified he's already
[58:46] perfected
[58:47] by his spirit oh i feel good this
[58:51] morning
[58:52] the shot of the king is in the camp the
[58:55] devil lost the bottom
[58:56] the fire the holy spirit is here you can
[58:59] receive your promise
[59:00] you can receive your feeling you can
[59:02] receive your healing
[59:04] we are sons of the original word the
[59:06] spirit is here today
[59:08] we have not received a spirit of bondage
[59:10] to fear i don't care what the devil has
[59:13] put on your trail
[59:14] the word of god is here to break it
[59:16] jesus break every shackle
[59:18] he breaks every feta i don't care what
[59:21] your problem
[59:21] i don't care what the devil is used to
[59:23] bind you this morning
[59:25] the jubilee trumpet of officials are
[59:28] sounded
[59:29] you can go free this morning the jubilee
[59:31] trumpet is sounding
[59:33] freedom praise be the name of the living
[59:36] god
[59:37] oh you maybe see that today hallelujah
[59:41] we are under a promise and heaven and
[59:45] ever pass away
[59:46] but the word of promise will never pass
[59:48] away
[59:49] praise god oh
[59:52] glory to god amen
[59:56] praise god we are not praised god we are
[1:00:00] not going to be
[1:00:01] cowed praise god we receive a spirit
[1:00:05] and when peter received that spirit he
[1:00:07] was no longer afraid
[1:00:09] he stepped out of the upper room by the
[1:00:11] gate called beautiful
[1:00:13] here was that layman laying there praise
[1:00:16] god
[1:00:17] peter said silva and gold i don't have
[1:00:20] pray what i have is not of this world
[1:00:22] not the riches of this world
[1:00:24] not the case of this world they will all
[1:00:26] perish brought up hallelujah
[1:00:29] oh but i received something such as i
[1:00:33] have
[1:00:34] the holy ghost itself such as i have i
[1:00:37] give unto you
[1:00:38] that was a son of the original word the
[1:00:41] word was in him
[1:00:42] the word was not just the letter but it
[1:00:44] was power
[1:00:46] praise god is spoken such as i have i
[1:00:48] have the word in me
[1:00:50] the dynamics of the holy spirit rise up
[1:00:53] and walk
[1:00:54] and that lame man rose up and walked he
[1:00:56] didn't sit back there
[1:00:58] because power was speaking to demon
[1:01:00] powers
[1:01:01] the physical eye saw him as a crippled
[1:01:03] man but in the spirit realm it was demon
[1:01:06] powers so the power the holy spirit
[1:01:08] spoke back there
[1:01:10] is signing the original word spoke back
[1:01:13] like adam
[1:01:14] spoke back like jesus christ oh and you
[1:01:17] are going to speak like that today
[1:01:19] because we are promised another
[1:01:21] ephesians
[1:01:22] oh pleasing
[1:01:27] praising oh hallelujah
[1:01:30] and i love ephesians ephesians is the
[1:01:32] proven seal
[1:01:34] hallelujah if you are not in the spirit
[1:01:37] you can't come to ephesians
[1:01:39] hallelujah or if you are not bad by the
[1:01:42] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:43] itself you can't come to ephesians
[1:01:46] because ephesians is the same spirit
[1:01:49] ephesians is the father working through
[1:01:51] the sun oh hallelujah the sun can do
[1:01:53] nothing but what he sees the father do
[1:01:56] so doing the sun
[1:01:57] likewise so ephesians is heavenly places
[1:02:01] it is time to get to heavenly places
[1:02:03] because the pride is promised heavenly
[1:02:05] places
[1:02:06] and we are in another disposition of
[1:02:09] ephesians where we look we walk not
[1:02:11] after the flesh
[1:02:13] but after the spirit praise god
[1:02:16] so is the time the church members are
[1:02:18] going to be fleshed
[1:02:19] out this is only the time for the pride
[1:02:22] the time for the seed
[1:02:23] the seed must come alive the seed must
[1:02:26] produce the power
[1:02:28] must produce the life must produce the
[1:02:30] spirit
[1:02:31] must produce the nature of the seed oh
[1:02:34] glory be to the living god
[1:02:36] so it is time to pick faith in the word
[1:02:38] whatever has been promised belongs to me
[1:02:41] the holy ghost is your promise
[1:02:43] perfection is your promise
[1:02:45] hallelujah and sons are here to prove

[1:03:52] is being supplied is working to the
[1:03:54] effectual working
[1:03:55] of the body of christ there will not be
[1:03:58] jealousy
[1:03:59] they will not be envy they will not be
[1:04:01] about biting don't know but evil
[1:04:02] surmising
[1:04:03] they will not be hatred but there will
[1:04:05] be one love one joy
[1:04:07] and when we come together then we can
[1:04:09] see the spirit of god moving among us
[1:04:12] hallelujah hallelujah oh

[1:07:50] [Music]
[1:07:51] to walk with you hallelujah
[1:07:55] so the prophet said now let's watch it
[1:07:57] let's watch and see
[1:07:58] unfold he said the mystery rider watch
[1:08:01] what he does now
[1:08:02] opposed refuse to repent and go back to
[1:08:06] the original blood world
[1:08:08] the world became blood and fleshy he
[1:08:12] refused to go back to it
[1:08:13] is the antichrist the true red bride
[1:08:16] he is opposed to the two where pride so
[1:08:20] that antichrist spirit
[1:08:21] is opposed to the true word pride
[1:08:24] hallelujah
[1:08:26] oh glory be to the living god he is
[1:08:28] opposed to the true wet bride
[1:08:30] takes his own bride so this
[1:08:34] devil takes his own bride and this bride
[1:08:37] supposedly bride is still in church are
[1:08:40] you following me now
[1:08:41] but we are coming to the ephesians where
[1:08:44] the spirit will be there
[1:08:46] to prove our character praise god
[1:08:49] because adoption is not faith believing
[1:08:52] the word
[1:08:52] adoption is your character the holy
[1:08:55] spirit reporting to the father
[1:08:57] about how you are behaving how you are
[1:09:00] responding to the instruction
[1:09:02] of the father praise god that is what
[1:09:05] places you
[1:09:06] your character your conduct and behavior
[1:09:09] places you
[1:09:10] as a son when he praise god of adoption
[1:09:14] are you with me now praise god he takes
[1:09:17] his own pride
[1:09:18] and brings hair to him in a form of
[1:09:21] religion
[1:09:22] called creed and dogma that's why we
[1:09:25] have to come to ephesians
[1:09:27] because in corinthians though i speak
[1:09:29] with tons of men and of angels
[1:09:31] that is in church now and have no
[1:09:34] charity
[1:09:34] nothing praise god do i give my body to
[1:09:38] be
[1:09:38] my my body to be pain do i feed the poor
[1:09:41] without charity nothing we are looking
[1:09:45] for efficiency
[1:09:46] where the world will be in the pride and
[1:09:48] the pride will know what to do with that
[1:09:50] word
[1:09:51] and no man will let that pride do
[1:09:53] otherwise because she's established
[1:09:56] like that ephesians church she's
[1:09:58] established
[1:09:59] word of his word spirit of his spirit
[1:10:02] praise god hallelujah
[1:10:07] and he takes his own bride and brings
[1:10:09] her to him
[1:10:10] in the form of religion called chris and
[1:10:12] dogma now
[1:10:14] seeing the holy bride he is against her
[1:10:17] he forms his own bride called antichrist
[1:10:20] by
[1:10:20] antichrist teaching
[1:10:24] which is contrary to christ
[1:10:28] hallelujah which is contrary to christ
[1:10:31] that is why in ephesians 4 11 is that he
[1:10:34] gave some apostles
[1:10:36] some prophets some teachers some
[1:10:39] pastors some evangelists for what for
[1:10:42] the perfecting of the saints
[1:10:43] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:10:46] edifying of the body of christ
[1:10:48] outside of that you can't wait for the
[1:10:50] ministry
[1:10:51] outside of that you cannot edify the
[1:10:53] body outside of that you cannot bring
[1:10:55] the pride to perfection
[1:11:02] he didn't say he gave some to play tapes
[1:11:05] praise god i've still got ministers on
[1:11:09] the earth to preach the word
[1:11:11] if they will hear they will hear them
[1:11:13] but it's got to come from the prophet's
[1:11:15] prophecy
[1:11:17] praise god back to ephesians again
[1:11:21] oh hallelujah and now praise god amen
[1:11:26] which is contrary to christ he
[1:11:28] how he how should he is and now instead
[1:11:32] of having a unity of love
[1:11:34] controlling worship under the blood he's
[1:11:36] got a denomination
[1:11:38] instead of having the word he took
[1:11:40] creeds
[1:11:41] dogmas and so forth hallelujah
[1:11:44] but thank god for the original word and
[1:11:46] there's an original bride
[1:11:48] sons of the original word to respond to
[1:11:51] that word
[1:11:52] that would be the pride of jesus christ
[1:11:54] for this day fulfilling every scripture
[1:11:57] that is written praise god
[1:11:59] hallelujah oh i love the word man
[1:12:03] amen amen the resurrection of lazarus he
[1:12:07] says
[1:12:08] them theories don't change god's word
[1:12:12] so your idea of the word don't change
[1:12:14] the word
[1:12:15] it's gonna rain in noah's day they
[1:12:18] laughed at him
[1:12:19] because the geology said it will never
[1:12:21] happen
[1:12:22] the rock formations don't look like they
[1:12:24] can even do anything to attract rain
[1:12:27] praise god and all the scientists of
[1:12:30] that day disproved it but they are
[1:12:31] curious
[1:12:33] but your theory don't change god's word
[1:12:37] the word said there's going to be
[1:12:39] another efficiency to this journey
[1:12:41] that is thus save the lord so you've got
[1:12:44] to look for that efficiency
[1:12:45] you've got to look for your place you've
[1:12:47] got to be in love
[1:12:48] you better be in heavenly places you
[1:12:51] better know that you know that you know
[1:12:53] that you are predestinated unto adoption
[1:12:56] because that's what the word says praise
[1:13:00] god
[1:13:01] them theories don't change god's word no
[1:13:03] sir god's word is eternally true
[1:13:06] and it is right our faith is based on
[1:13:09] there
[1:13:10] i am not saved because i got down at the
[1:13:12] altar and cried
[1:13:13] i am saved because the word of god tells
[1:13:15] me so
[1:13:20] the word tells me so and when i go to
[1:13:23] ephesians 2
[1:13:24] is that a you had he quickened who were
[1:13:28] dead in sin and trespasses
[1:13:30] hallelujah there was no hope for me but
[1:13:33] thank god for the original word he had
[1:13:36] quickened me
[1:13:37] i was dead in sin i was dead in
[1:13:39] trespasses
[1:13:40] but he has quickened me onto life
[1:13:44] because one man brought sin to me
[1:13:47] but one man took away sin from me
[1:13:50] and brings me into the perfect
[1:13:52] fellowship
[1:13:54] of himself which is christ jesus himself
[1:13:57] he said wearing ye in time past work
[1:13:59] according to the course of this world
[1:14:01] according to the priests of the power of
[1:14:02] the heir the spirit are now working in
[1:14:05] children of the disobedient
[1:14:07] praise god among whom also we all had
[1:14:09] our conversation in time past
[1:14:11] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[1:14:14] desires of this flesh
[1:14:16] praise god and of the mind and we're by
[1:14:19] nature
[1:14:19] children of rock even as others but god
[1:14:23] not your pastor not your church not the
[1:14:26] system
[1:14:27] but god who is rich in mercy
[1:14:31] praise god so it is not by your own
[1:14:34] righteousness that any man should pose
[1:14:37] but god who is rich in mercy for this
[1:14:40] great love wearing he has loved us
[1:14:43] even when we're dead in sin has
[1:14:45] quickened us together
[1:14:48] praise god they are squeaking us
[1:14:50] together
[1:14:51] oh glory be to the living god that's why
[1:14:54] we are baptized by one body
[1:14:56] by one spirit into one body while christ
[1:14:59] picking us together praise god so when i
[1:15:02] travel to lagos i
[1:15:04] is in same spirit i travel to ivory
[1:15:07] coast the same spirit
[1:15:08] prana we don't look funny we are hooked
[1:15:11] into heavenly places
[1:15:13] because we are in ephesians again the
[1:15:15] dispensation of ephesians is here
[1:15:18] oh hallelujah god that is reaching mercy
[1:15:22] for his great love wherein he loved us
[1:15:25] even when we were
[1:15:26] dead in sins praise god
[1:15:30] so don't tell me i can shout don't tell
[1:15:33] me i cannot praise
[1:15:35] don't tell me i cannot rejoice don't
[1:15:37] tell me i cannot be on fire
[1:15:39] because i know i overcome the wicked one
[1:15:42] that's why when i come to church i get
[1:15:44] on fire
[1:15:45] when i come to the presence i am in
[1:15:47] heavenly places
[1:15:48] i've got to praise him i've got to
[1:15:50] worship him because i've escaped the
[1:15:52] antichrist
[1:15:53] spirit oh give him praise
[1:15:57] give him praise hallelujah
[1:16:01] praise be the name of the living god
[1:16:04] and us raised us up together
[1:16:07] and made us to see together in heavenly
[1:16:09] places in christ jesus
[1:16:11] that in ages to come which is now
[1:16:15] he might show the exceeding riches of
[1:16:17] his grace
[1:16:18] in his kindness towards us through
[1:16:20] christ jesus for by grace
[1:16:22] are ye saved through faith praise god
[1:16:25] that is why i rejoice
[1:16:27] i didn't save myself hallelujah
[1:16:30] and you did this yesterday thank god
[1:16:32] christ died
[1:16:34] quicken me from sin praise god
[1:16:37] to sit in heavenly places that is why i
[1:16:40] cannot hold my peace
[1:16:42] i've been redeemed by the blood of the
[1:16:44] lamb
[1:16:46] shown that my name is in the book
[1:16:49] predestinated brother
[1:16:50] and i've got a testimony now i'm a son
[1:16:53] of the original word
[1:16:55] oh glory be to the name of the living
[1:16:58] god
[1:17:00] amen hallelujah
[1:17:03] so i am not safe because i got down at
[1:17:05] the altar i'm saying because ephesians 2
[1:17:07] tells me so
[1:17:09] praise god you got to speak back to the
[1:17:11] devil anytime he brings you a mind
[1:17:13] battle
[1:17:14] let him know that you are a son of the
[1:17:16] original world
[1:17:17] heaven and head will pass away but that
[1:17:19] word will never never never
[1:17:21] pass away praise god you shall be
[1:17:24] adopted
[1:17:24] that is a short word of prophecy you
[1:17:27] shall be sealed
[1:17:28] that's a short word of prophecy you
[1:17:30] shall be perfect that is a short word of
[1:17:33] prophecy cannot fail praise
[1:17:36] god alleluia
[1:17:40] amen you maybe see that praise god
[1:17:44] hallelujah see he said i'm sick because
[1:17:47] the word of god tells me i am saved
[1:17:50] satan can whip me around anywhere
[1:17:53] on how you feel praise god
[1:17:57] the devil cannot whip you around
[1:18:00] when you know who you are is god so
[1:18:03] satan cannot whip me around anywhere on
[1:18:06] how
[1:18:06] you feel i believe it because god said
[1:18:09] so and i accept him upon the basis of
[1:18:13] his word
[1:18:14] that is how i was saved i believe it and
[1:18:16] confess it
[1:18:18] then it works the results the first
[1:18:20] thing
[1:18:21] i am saying because god goes with
[1:18:23] teaches i am saved that is how you are
[1:18:26] saved if you are saved
[1:18:28] satan can whip you on your ideas and
[1:18:30] things
[1:18:31] but he can go around on the word of god
[1:18:35] jesus said it is written and that
[1:18:37] settles it and it is written
[1:18:39] in the scripture
[1:18:46] hallelujah it is written where in
[1:18:49] the scripture and the scripture is
[1:18:52] written for what our
[1:18:53] learning that by the scriptures we might
[1:18:56] find
[1:18:56] comfort in the scriptures to believe the
[1:18:59] word
[1:19:00] that whatever promise is in there
[1:19:01] belongs to me
[1:19:03] the devil can't beat me around the devil
[1:19:06] can't kick me around
[1:19:08] praise god my name is written there
[1:19:12] praise god oh you believe that
[1:19:16] hallelujah praise god
[1:19:20] now why must god look for you why must
[1:19:23] the spirit of god work in you
[1:19:25] because the brother said that he is
[1:19:27] filled in a man
[1:19:29] god you cannot see god but god manifests
[1:19:32] himself
[1:19:33] every day this word is written
[1:19:36] it cannot speak it needs a body to speak
[1:19:40] true
[1:19:41] praise god so he is filled in a man
[1:19:46] so if god is building you god is what
[1:19:49] god is
[1:19:50] love
[1:19:54] and if god is love and he's building you
[1:19:56] you must be what
[1:19:57] love
[1:20:01] so the world want to see god they've got
[1:20:02] to see you
[1:20:04] they want to see love they've got to see
[1:20:06] love in you

[1:21:40] key bodies
[1:21:41] he's building the guitarist he's
[1:21:43] building the deacon

[1:22:09] here was god those greeks saying we
[1:22:12] would see him
[1:22:14] and jesus said a corner of wheat has to
[1:22:16] fall and die
[1:22:22] we don't see the power of god because we
[1:22:24] are too alive
[1:22:26] praise god when the word comes forth
[1:22:28] instead of
[1:22:29] dying we are too alive
[1:22:33] [Music]

[1:22:43] praise god so when the spirit has need
[1:22:46] for the church
[1:22:47] he speaks through the local elder
[1:22:50] that is god speaking because he's always
[1:22:53] failed
[1:22:54] and this is the dispensation of
[1:22:55] ephesians where the manifestation of god
[1:22:59] must be unveiled before the people
[1:23:01] praise god so the prophet be real
[1:23:03] careful now because he's the same
[1:23:05] yesterday today
[1:23:07] and forever oh
[1:23:10] are you with me today is that those like

[1:23:16] body and drinking in his blood see
[1:23:18] but they had done died to those things
[1:23:21] they were
[1:23:21] dead to a principle they were dead to
[1:23:24] christ
[1:23:25] no matter what it is or how might defeat
[1:23:28] light look like he had they still
[1:23:30] believed it anyhow
[1:23:32] see they could see it in that man
[1:23:35] a man that eat drunk and fish slap
[1:23:38] everything else
[1:23:39] was born on the head walk with them talk
[1:23:42] with them
[1:23:42] wore clothes like the rest of them but
[1:23:44] that was god
[1:23:49] and the world be looking at a bunch of
[1:23:51] people praise god
[1:23:53] hallelujah that the world knows nothing
[1:23:55] about but that is god
[1:23:57] walking on the earth
[1:24:04] let me say something that would choke
[1:24:05] you he said man is omnipotent
[1:24:09] praise god hallelujah it's not your
[1:24:11] flesh now
[1:24:12] but there's a seed gemini man some seed
[1:24:15] jamming some
[1:24:16] sons and sisters on daughters that came
[1:24:19] from
[1:24:19] god and they are going back to god oh
[1:24:22] you say but why am i
[1:24:23] suffering why am i going through trials
[1:24:25] and temptations
[1:24:26] because you bypass your giovanni praise
[1:24:29] god
[1:24:30] in order to be tried in order to be
[1:24:32] tempted in order to be proven
[1:24:35] that you come from the original world or
[1:24:37] you came from god
[1:24:39] so you overcome praise god how do you
[1:24:41] overcome
[1:24:42] by the word you overcome by the word
[1:24:45] jesus
[1:24:46] come by his power he overcame by the
[1:24:49] word
[1:24:50] it is written it is written it is
[1:24:52] written satan it is written
[1:24:54] today we've got to overcome
[1:25:00] so paul said praise god
[1:25:01] [Music]
[1:25:03] think it's not strange because god is
[1:25:06] building you
[1:25:08] he must be expressing you hallelujah
[1:25:12] so we are not careful we are not
[1:25:14] wondering
[1:25:16] we are not waking up surprise why are
[1:25:18] these trials
[1:25:19] why are these false doctrines flying all
[1:25:21] over the place
[1:25:22] we are not shaken because we are built
[1:25:26] upon the doctrine of the apostles and
[1:25:28] the prophets
[1:25:29] our foundation standards sure we are not
[1:25:32] as children toast to and fro
[1:25:33] by any wind of doctrine but we are
[1:25:36] established upon the foundation
[1:25:38] of the word of the living god we know
[1:25:40] who we are
[1:25:42] we are sons of the original word oh by
[1:25:45] me of gold tried by
[1:25:46] fire oh not try by water but try by fire
[1:25:50] oh we want to see our reflection in the
[1:25:53] image we want to see our image is
[1:25:54] reflected
[1:25:55] in the image of christ we walk the
[1:25:58] images of christ
[1:25:59] on the earth reflecting faith all the
[1:26:01] way to charity
[1:26:02] praise be the name of the living god
[1:26:06] so we are not ashamed of the reproach
[1:26:09] we better reproach anyhow because god
[1:26:13] is unveiling himself praise god
[1:26:17] in some two sons some born sons
[1:26:21] some filled sons oh hallelujah
[1:26:24] one of these days they are going to look
[1:26:26] for those sons they will not see them
[1:26:28] because they risen to their body change
[1:26:31] hallelujah and we shall be
[1:26:33] caught up to be the lord in the air it
[1:26:35] wouldn't be long bride
[1:26:37] oh praise god
[1:26:42] hallelujah praise god
[1:26:46] hallelujah the prophet season the seed
[1:26:49] is not aired with a shock
[1:26:50] is that god vindicates it to be true
[1:26:52] sure
[1:26:53] it is fulfilling this age
[1:26:56] when the seven seals or just proving
[1:27:00] that
[1:27:00] the denomination has just been carriers
[1:27:02] that's another one of the father's
[1:27:04] business to prove
[1:27:07] the denominations have been carriers is
[1:27:10] one of the father's business to prove
[1:27:12] that they are not the original seed
[1:27:15] they were just carriers
[1:27:19] but the father has to prove that
[1:27:22] huh and they had to die out
[1:27:26] for the life to come back into the
[1:27:27] original psalms
[1:27:30] are you with me today praise god
[1:27:33] if that's just another one of the
[1:27:35] father's business to prove
[1:27:36] that's the father's business now is to
[1:27:39] show that
[1:27:40] you that then denominations is not his
[1:27:49] do you understand is to show you
[1:27:52] that their denomination is not his they
[1:27:55] are man-made systems that deny the word
[1:27:59] of god
[1:28:03] so everything that the prophet revealed
[1:28:05] about that pride
[1:28:06] you better grab it
[1:28:08] [Music]
[1:28:11] so when he says that the true church
[1:28:13] will be the continuation of another book
[1:28:15] of acts you better grab it
[1:28:17] go back in there and see what the spirit
[1:28:19] used them to do
[1:28:21] you better get into that spirit because
[1:28:23] anything outside that he said is the
[1:28:24] antichrist spirit
[1:28:26] coming into the church to defile the
[1:28:28] church
[1:28:29] oh come on now by making it lukewarm
[1:28:32] by making it former by making it praise
[1:28:36] god
[1:28:36] dead praise god but by me of god try
[1:28:40] by fire when you come here your
[1:28:42] character must reflect the world
[1:28:44] and fishes must be on display oh
[1:28:47] then we will know that the spirit that
[1:28:49] raised christ from the dead
[1:28:51] is dwelling in you and is quickly your
[1:28:53] mortal body
[1:28:54] it quickens you to praise it quickens
[1:28:57] you to worship
[1:28:58] it quickens you not to be dead oh come
[1:29:01] on now
[1:29:01] come on now if i walk into a message
[1:29:04] check i must be identified
[1:29:06] i must be identified because the spirit
[1:29:08] that is ruling that church
[1:29:10] proves to me that they are in heavenly
[1:29:13] places
[1:29:15] [Applause]
[1:29:22] praise god hallelujah
[1:29:25] i feel good this morning oh hallelujah
[1:29:29] we must rock you by the word we have no
[1:29:32] other thing to teach but the word
[1:29:34] the prophet said a change that is that
[1:29:36] has no noise there's no god
[1:29:38] you better get on fire it is not the
[1:29:41] preacher wanting fire
[1:29:42] you are identifying your seed that you
[1:29:45] are of the original word
[1:29:47] you know the preachers are not lecturers
[1:29:49] we don't come to lecture you
[1:29:51] will come to put fire on the word to
[1:29:54] quicken that word to you
[1:29:55] praise god oh
[1:29:59] an emotionless religion is the powerless
[1:30:01] religion represent a religion that has
[1:30:04] no emotion needs to be buried i'm not
[1:30:06] saying come and act religion
[1:30:08] but let the spirit quicken your mortal
[1:30:10] body into praise
[1:30:12] into worship into saying amen to the
[1:30:14] world into a revival
[1:30:16] because we have come to the revival of
[1:30:18] the just
[1:30:20] praise god hallelujah
[1:30:23] it is his business to prove that them
[1:30:26] denominations are dead
[1:30:27] it is his business to prove that the mr
[1:30:30] churches that reject the head part
[1:30:33] hallelujah oh glory be to the living god
[1:30:36] are
[1:30:36] dead praise god
[1:30:40] you've got to accept the full word all
[1:30:43] of the word or none of the word
[1:30:45] oh glory to god amen
[1:30:48] the first son was a spoken word seed of
[1:30:50] god he was given a pride
[1:30:53] how the problem says i'm just reviewing
[1:30:55] the spirit is not picking up what i said
[1:30:57] see
[1:30:57] to produce himself she fell the bread
[1:31:00] was given to produce himself
[1:31:02] again another son of god but she fell by
[1:31:05] high breathing
[1:31:15] like some people say when you call the
[1:31:16] prophet you are what
[1:31:18] literature reviewing that's
[1:31:20] intellectuality
[1:31:22] that's blaspheming the holy spirit
[1:31:24] because we cannot
[1:31:25] feed on nothing else but the revealed
[1:31:27] word for our day
[1:31:29] the world is the blood for your day
[1:31:35] this is a closed book
[1:31:38] it takes the prophet's message to open
[1:31:40] up this book
[1:31:43] outside of the prophet's message is a
[1:31:44] closed book
[1:31:46] no wonder they say the seals are not
[1:31:48] open because they reject the head part
[1:31:50] of it
[1:31:52] oh come on now let me not get there
[1:31:53] praise god
[1:31:55] hallelujah but there's a pride on the
[1:31:58] earth
[1:31:58] the pride was given to produce him
[1:32:00] himself again another son of god
[1:32:03] but she fell by hybrid and she produced
[1:32:06] himself but she fell
[1:32:07] caused him to die the second son is
[1:32:11] spoken seed word of god
[1:32:13] was given a brand like adam but before
[1:32:15] he could marry her
[1:32:16] she fell she had fallen also
[1:32:20] for she was put to a free moral agency
[1:32:23] like adam's wife was
[1:32:25] and to believe god's word and leave or
[1:32:27] doubt it and die
[1:32:29] are you following me now but from a
[1:32:31] little group
[1:32:33] of the true seed of the world god will
[1:32:36] present
[1:32:36] christ a beloved bride a virgin a vision
[1:32:40] of his word
[1:32:41] and through them and by them through
[1:32:44] these sons
[1:32:45] and by the sons of the original word
[1:32:48] or through them and by them will be
[1:32:51] fulfilled all that was promised
[1:32:53] for the his word in the virgin who knows
[1:32:56] no man made credo dogma
[1:32:58] the word of promise in himself like it
[1:33:01] was in mary
[1:33:02] god himself made manifest he will act
[1:33:05] himself he will act himself
[1:33:09] he will act in worship he will act in
[1:33:12] praise
[1:33:13] he will act in believing he will acting
[1:33:16] loving
[1:33:16] he will act in forgiving he will add the
[1:33:20] word
[1:33:22] hallelujah hallelujah sons of the
[1:33:26] original word
[1:33:27] when the trials come you will stand
[1:33:29] there as a son
[1:33:30] you will forgive us the son because you
[1:33:32] are being tried by
[1:33:33] fire oh glory to god a man that the
[1:33:36] character of himself
[1:33:38] will be produced when they hang them to
[1:33:40] the cross
[1:33:41] they knelt the nails into his hand they
[1:33:44] pierced his side
[1:33:45] he said father forgive them forgive them
[1:33:48] for they know not what they do he just
[1:33:51] didn't say them
[1:33:52] he meant them and those words went to
[1:33:56] fulfill the purpose
[1:33:57] for which they were spoken they were
[1:33:59] truly
[1:34:00] forgiving because jesus requested father
[1:34:03] forgive them
[1:34:07] that the scripture might be fulfilled he
[1:34:10] had to be nailed to the cross
[1:34:11] somebody had to do it
[1:34:15] somebody was predestinated to nail that
[1:34:18] nail there
[1:34:19] to pierce his hand there but he stood
[1:34:21] there
[1:34:22] father forgive them
[1:34:28] think it not strange and the pastor is
[1:34:30] against me
[1:34:31] lord help me to hold on and the brothers
[1:34:34] don't like me
[1:34:35] and this church is not something that
[1:34:37] has all kinds of things that are like
[1:34:39] stand still and believe the word
[1:34:42] oh god is proving you he is trying you
[1:34:46] he's testing you to prove your seed
[1:34:50] [Applause]
[1:34:55] praise god hallelujah
[1:34:59] oh they know no man with creed the
[1:35:01] promise the word of promise in himself
[1:35:03] like it was in mary
[1:35:05] god himself made manifest he will act
[1:35:08] himself
[1:35:08] by his own word of promise so to fulfill
[1:35:12] all that is written of him as he did
[1:35:14] when he came from the virgin womb
[1:35:17] type of merry womb now so will the
[1:35:19] virgin now accepting his word
[1:35:22] beat unto me as thou has said
[1:35:25] though it was said by an angel while it
[1:35:27] was just written in the word in isaiah 9
[1:35:30] 6 they will love him who
[1:35:33] those in the bride those original sons
[1:35:37] of the word
[1:35:38] they will love him
[1:35:52] to trust in jesus not to trust in your
[1:35:54] church not a trust in your family
[1:35:57] but to trust in jesus the word they will
[1:36:00] love him
[1:36:02] sons of the original world will love him
[1:36:05] they will love his so you cannot love
[1:36:08] him and hate me

[1:36:25] wife for weeks you won't talk to him
[1:36:27] that's not the son of god that's not the
[1:36:29] spirit of god
[1:36:30] hit the altar and ask for salvation has
[1:36:33] to be retained praise god
[1:36:35] husbands love your wife they will love
[1:36:39] him

[1:36:47] subject subject to his head headship of
[1:36:50] christ
[1:36:51] is his
[1:36:54] [Applause]
[1:36:56] come on ephesians bright hallelujah
[1:37:00] and what would that produce when the
[1:37:03] head and the body are together it
[1:37:06] produces
[1:37:07] a harmony the oneness of christ and his
[1:37:10] church
[1:37:12] jesus never did anything until he see
[1:37:14] the father
[1:37:15] the father showed him first harmony
[1:37:17] between god and christ see
[1:37:19] john 5 19 so will the bride
[1:37:23] and he shows her his word of life he
[1:37:26] shows her she receives it
[1:37:30] by just hearing the quote but you
[1:37:32] receive it you hear it
[1:37:35] you recognize it you hear it and you act
[1:37:38] upon the world
[1:37:42] so create that atmosphere of love create
[1:37:46] that atmosphere of joy
[1:37:48] create the atmosphere of peace in your
[1:37:50] home in your church
[1:37:52] [Music]
[1:37:58] all those groupies all those sectarian
[1:38:00] groupies in the church
[1:38:02] break them down because by one spirit
[1:38:05] are we baptized
[1:38:07] into one body
[1:38:13] if the bride gets to know who she is the
[1:38:15] rapture will be gone
[1:38:18] praise god notice
[1:38:22] christ never did anything so will the
[1:38:24] bride
[1:38:25] and he shows her his word of life he
[1:38:28] shows her and she receives it
[1:38:30] she never doubts it nothing can harm her
[1:38:33] not even death for if the seed be
[1:38:36] planted
[1:38:37] the water will raise it up again come on
[1:38:40] now
[1:38:41] and the seed of the world has been
[1:38:43] planted in the original sons of the
[1:38:46] world
[1:38:47] nothing can take that seed away from you
[1:38:49] you will produce the life of jesus
[1:38:51] christ
[1:38:52] you will produce the power of jesus
[1:38:54] christ hallelujah
[1:38:56] oh he raised up again the prophet said
[1:38:59] here is the secret
[1:39:00] the word is in the bride
[1:39:04] and the mind of christ to know what he
[1:39:07] wants done
[1:39:08] with the word so she does it in his name
[1:39:12] she has does serve the lord then it is
[1:39:14] dramatized
[1:39:16] so the holy spirit waters it until it is
[1:39:18] grown
[1:39:19] and serves his purpose
[1:39:23] so you are here to serve the purpose of
[1:39:27] god
[1:39:29] and the prophet said in expressions he
[1:39:31] said anything that said the purpose of
[1:39:33] god has a resurrection
[1:39:41] in the dry season they put fire in the
[1:39:44] fields
[1:39:44] bend all the grass but let the rain come

[1:42:35] then
[1:42:35] they do the works of god for it is
[1:42:38] himself
[1:42:38] in them continuing his word to fulfill
[1:42:42] as he did not complete it in his days so
[1:42:45] you are here now
[1:42:47] to fulfill the word oh don't let the
[1:42:50] devil stop you
[1:42:51] don't let circumstances stop you you
[1:42:54] might lose your job that doesn't stop
[1:42:55] the word of the living god
[1:42:57] the conditions of this world will not
[1:42:59] stop the word of the living god
[1:43:01] but realize that you have a purpose to
[1:43:03] fulfill your purpose is to fulfill the
[1:43:05] word for your day
[1:43:07] praise god you are part of the body you
[1:43:09] have a function to perform
[1:43:11] hallelujah if yours is to clap your
[1:43:13] hands clap your hands
[1:43:15] if yours is to play the tambourine play
[1:43:16] the tambourine
[1:43:18] do it with all your strength do with all
[1:43:20] your might
[1:43:21] if your word is to preach the gospel
[1:43:23] preaching without fear
[1:43:24] or favor don't care who stays who goes
[1:43:27] stand there and preach that word oh
[1:43:30] because your
[1:43:31] faith is being tried even as you preach
[1:43:34] the word
[1:43:38] yours is to sit there and believe it but
[1:43:40] leave it with all your heart
[1:43:42] oh blessed be the name of the living god
[1:43:47] hallelujah oh
[1:43:50] yes sir brother abraham says in the
[1:43:52] london church age
[1:43:54] he said yes sir the church is no longer
[1:43:56] the mouthpiece of god
[1:43:58] it is his own mouthpiece so god is
[1:44:00] turning her
[1:44:01] on praise god that's why god bypassed
[1:44:06] the church
[1:44:08] picked up individuals to his name that
[1:44:11] can
[1:44:11] take the word like shadrach meshach and
[1:44:13] abednego
[1:44:14] god can take the word like joshua
[1:44:16] standing there
[1:44:17] praise god ask for me and my house in
[1:44:20] this pandemic we will save the lord
[1:44:22] i will not be dead because there's an
[1:44:24] antichrist spirit
[1:44:26] flowing in to defile the church but i
[1:44:28] will not be defiled
[1:44:30] by that lukewarm spirit by that dead
[1:44:32] spirit but
[1:44:33] a powerless spirit i will not be
[1:44:35] conquered
[1:44:40] so god is standing here on he will
[1:44:43] confound her through
[1:44:45] the prophet and the bride oh come on
[1:44:48] sons of the promised world
[1:44:50] sons of the original word god will use
[1:44:53] you to confound the world
[1:44:55] hallelujah yes it is for it says in the
[1:44:58] last chapter of revelation 17
[1:45:00] the spirit and the bright sea come once
[1:45:03] more the world will hear direct from god
[1:45:06] as a pentecost
[1:45:07] but of course that wet bride will be
[1:45:10] repudiated
[1:45:11] as it is in the first age
[1:45:17] so that efficient church age they were a
[1:45:20] little bitty tiny minority
[1:45:22] but there were all kinds of false
[1:45:24] prophets flying all over the place
[1:45:26] all kinds of false doctrines flying over
[1:45:28] the place but they stood there
[1:45:30] and they checked the dog trees by the
[1:45:32] word and when those apostles got among
[1:45:34] them
[1:45:35] they found them to be liars and they
[1:45:37] stood on the weather and declared it to
[1:45:39] be so
[1:45:39] that is why the prophet said praise god
[1:45:42] this pride will be like the first church
[1:45:45] age will be like that ephesians church
[1:45:47] will build another christian church they
[1:45:49] were there with signs
[1:45:51] wonders and miracles they were
[1:45:53] established on the world
[1:45:55] they forsook the world 13 year olds were
[1:45:58] shaking this world
[1:45:59] under the impact of the holy spirit and
[1:46:02] we have promised another efficiency
[1:46:04] that mysteries are being unfolded the
[1:46:06] seven seals has been broken
[1:46:08] balakai 4 was sent to tie up ever loose
[1:46:11] and hidden in the world
[1:46:12] now we have no excuse the holy ghost has
[1:46:15] been released to the church
[1:46:17] the spirit of adoption was declared
[1:46:19] released to the pride
[1:46:21] we've got to come to that perfection
[1:46:23] we've got to come to that adoption
[1:46:25] but we can all come to it just by
[1:46:27] knowledge of the world
[1:46:28] we've got to come to it by the spirit we
[1:46:31] must be tried by the spirit
[1:46:32] we must be proven by the spirit the
[1:46:35] spirit itself must bear witness with our
[1:46:37] spirit
[1:46:38] that we have believed the faith that we
[1:46:40] are holding on to the word of malachi 4
[1:46:42] praise be the name of the living god the
[1:46:45] spirit itself today
[1:46:48] must vindicate the pride
[1:46:51] hallelujah oh bless said be the name of
[1:46:55] a living god
[1:46:56] oh you love him today oh hallelujah
[1:47:01] hey amen oh
[1:47:04] glory glory glory glory hallelujah
[1:47:08] brother brown said my brother my sister
[1:47:11] today we are trying to make
[1:47:12] denominations
[1:47:15] that ephesians church at ephesus
[1:47:18] it wasn't a big church it was twice this
[1:47:22] church is twice in size
[1:47:25] or more 13 people i guess there were not
[1:47:29] many
[1:47:30] they were not up to 20 people
[1:47:33] but they believed the world they took
[1:47:36] god's word as it was
[1:47:37] written when paul heard about them
[1:47:41] praise god oh paul was so shaken about
[1:47:44] their faith
[1:47:49] i couldn't wait to be among them
[1:47:53] not like the romans every spirit that is
[1:47:57] on the head has existed before
[1:48:00] so let us go back to the world because
[1:48:02] it is written for our learning
[1:48:07] [Music]
[1:48:10] those corinthians that will come to show
[1:48:12] off
[1:48:14] i got a new tie i got a new suit i got a
[1:48:17] new dress
[1:48:18] i got a new shoe that's not why we come
[1:48:21] to church
[1:48:25] i got a new car
[1:48:28] they don't see you in church the day you
[1:48:30] release a new message is
[1:48:32] e-class that day you are first to be in
[1:48:34] church
[1:48:36] shining your car that's not why we have
[1:48:39] come that cannot be vindicated
[1:48:41] that can be manifested that cannot be
[1:48:43] displayed to the world
[1:48:46] because the world has more than you have
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:57] praise god is that my brother
[1:49:00] sister today we are trying to make the
[1:49:02] nominations we are trying to build new
[1:49:05] churches
[1:49:05] we are trying to organize people educate
[1:49:08] them it's all in vain
[1:49:13] until we come back to the original world
[1:49:17] that the spirit can bear witness with
[1:49:19] our spirit
[1:49:20] that we are sons of god is all in vain
[1:49:24] until the love of god comes in you want
[1:49:26] to speak with pants
[1:49:29] you want to be like the corinthians you
[1:49:31] want to clap your hands
[1:49:32] you want to jump you want to dance you
[1:49:34] want to do certain things to make
[1:49:36] yourself a christian
[1:49:37] you will never be
[1:49:45] you will never be until the love of god
[1:49:48] takes over
[1:49:49] in your heart tears down that middle
[1:49:51] part out
[1:49:53] makes you feel for your brother that
[1:49:55] will make you act like a man
[1:49:57] like a child of god and put christ in
[1:49:59] you the hope of glory
[1:50:00] until the chat comes to that she is
[1:50:03] still
[1:50:04] a total failure and will always be
[1:50:11] praise god except the corn of wheat
[1:50:14] falls to the ground and dies

[1:50:22] hallelujah oh
[1:50:24] glory to god amen
[1:50:29] hallelujah let me close our praise god

[1:50:35] you can prove
[1:50:36] this god the only way you can come and
[1:50:39] manifest another ephesians
[1:50:41] is for him to express himself
[1:50:46] so it means that you must get out of the
[1:50:48] way
[1:50:50] and let him express himself
[1:50:53] and then when he came to a place of the
[1:50:56] coming age
[1:50:57] the father seen that the sun had
[1:50:59] progressed
[1:51:01] so you must progress
[1:51:06] the child cannot just be at one place
[1:51:09] they had to come out of
[1:51:10] egypt there was a racy but they were
[1:51:12] marching there
[1:51:13] because that was the route to progress
[1:51:16] they
[1:51:17] faced that red sea didn't care the fiery
[1:51:19] trials that were there
[1:51:20] praise god there were some chicken
[1:51:22] believers there
[1:51:24] moses having brought us here to die and
[1:51:26] then see
[1:51:27] praise god but moses says stance tale
[1:51:29] and see the salvation
[1:51:31] of your god and i say today stand still
[1:51:35] and see the salvation there's got to be
[1:51:38] another efficiency
[1:51:39] to this prize journey stand still
[1:51:49] and this is not going right for me
[1:51:51] everything is going wrong
[1:51:52] stand still
[1:51:56] it is god that is riding the ship he is
[1:52:00] selling the ship
[1:52:01] oh he's going to roll that boat ashore
[1:52:04] the river may be deep
[1:52:05] the river may be wide hallelujah but
[1:52:08] there is honey on the other side
[1:52:13] come on now glory to god amen
[1:52:18] hallelujah and the father seen that the
[1:52:21] son had progressed
[1:52:22] and he was where he was a wedding boy
[1:52:25] everything he did was right
[1:52:27] and right up with his father's business
[1:52:32] you've got to be about the father's
[1:52:34] business when you progress
[1:52:36] huh he wanted everything just right for
[1:52:39] the father
[1:52:39] he had no selfish motives
[1:52:46] i'm dressing to cut the eye of a sister
[1:52:48] in the church you have no selfish motive
[1:52:51] you are dressing as the son of god
[1:52:58] no selfish motives then the father
[1:53:01] taking their son out to a public place
[1:53:03] huh and the father taking the very son
[1:53:06] that was born in his family
[1:53:08] and adopted his own son that is what
[1:53:11] ephesians said we are adopted
[1:53:13] predestinated to adoption by sons by
[1:53:16] christ
[1:53:17] now that son in other words he adopted
[1:53:20] him
[1:53:20] and by this by this may he
[1:53:23] he place his son traditionally by this
[1:53:27] he placed his son
[1:53:28] positionally how did he do it then that
[1:53:31] son's name
[1:53:32] on the check was as good as the father's
[1:53:35] because he was in position the father
[1:53:38] had
[1:53:38] vindicated that that place that that
[1:53:42] had placed that sun in position and i
[1:53:45] hope you are getting it
[1:53:46] now then that son was heir to what the
[1:53:49] father had
[1:53:51] [Applause]

[2:00:21] big thing no it's sons and daughters in
[2:00:23] their place what we need is adoption
[2:00:28] too many sick people among us they need
[2:00:31] to be healed
[2:00:33] and you must speak to them

[2:00:39] them
[2:00:40] what we need is adoption
[2:00:45] are you with me now sons and daughters
[2:00:47] need
[2:00:48] adoption how many want adoption
[2:00:52] everybody wants adoption okay let's find
[2:00:55] out i'm done
[2:00:56] but how can the church
[2:01:00] we need adoption for the sick to be
[2:01:02] healed
[2:01:03] we need an option for the power to be
[2:01:06] set free
[2:01:07] we need adoption for power to come into
[2:01:10] the church
[2:01:14] but how can the church the pentecostal
[2:01:16] church
[2:01:17] the methodist church the baptist church
[2:01:19] and the message changed
[2:01:21] i'm putting that one right now and the
[2:01:23] message church
[2:01:28] be adopted until they come to discipline
[2:01:39] not mystery if it was mystery the
[2:01:42] corinthian church would have been
[2:01:48] adopted
[2:01:50] was just to be justified the roman
[2:01:52] church would have been
[2:01:53] perfected by justification
[2:01:58] praise god but it had to wait till
[2:02:02] ephesians
[2:02:04] where god had to place the body in his
[2:02:06] position
[2:02:07] but the problem said how can we come to
[2:02:09] that adoption that we need
[2:02:11] praise god hey until we come to what
[2:02:16] discipline
[2:02:21] the pastor will preach all his heart out
[2:02:24] by the word
[2:02:25] i won't act upon the prayer
[2:02:28] yeah you want adoption
[2:02:32] young people will not surrender to the
[2:02:34] word fully and be sanctified
[2:02:38] and yet you want adoption
[2:02:45] when the trials come in school they are
[2:02:47] coming to try you
[2:02:49] blessed is he that one over comment
[2:02:56] when those slick jesse bells come your
[2:02:58] way they are coming
[2:03:00] to dry you when those
[2:03:03] funny movies on your mobile phones come
[2:03:05] to try you
[2:03:06] they come to try you for you to overcome
[2:03:18] some of you will not fornicate and
[2:03:20] commit adultery but you watch them on
[2:03:21] your phones
[2:03:24] you are worse than the one that did the
[2:03:26] act
[2:03:33] we must come to another ephesians what
[2:03:36] is a disciplined son
[2:03:38] holy spirit takes the report back to the
[2:03:40] father you know these quotes
[2:03:42] praise god so what do you come and
[2:03:45] you're lying on your bed sleeping he
[2:03:46] takes that report back
[2:03:50] they stream a message for you to be in
[2:03:52] service you need to dress
[2:03:54] right sit at home in the spirit as if
[2:03:57] you were in the church
[2:04:00] under expectation
[2:04:03] some will sweep their mobile phones on
[2:04:05] and be sleeping on the bed and listening
[2:04:09] discipline the pastor is not there to
[2:04:12] see
[2:04:13] the dickies are not there to see some of
[2:04:15] you stream it off and you are roaming
[2:04:17] about in time
[2:04:20] who are you deceiving we've got to come
[2:04:23] to discipline
[2:04:30] it's an abomination for the woman to
[2:04:31] wear a command opportunity
[2:04:34] some of you will sneak through the jeans
[2:04:35] trousers in your bags you get out of
[2:04:38] here
[2:04:38] out of home in town you are in trousers
[2:04:41] to conform to the world
[2:04:52] god he that doesn't let him hear what
[2:04:55] the spirit
[2:04:56] is saying to the churches not the church
[2:04:59] the churches
[2:05:00] praise god oh my
[2:05:05] god could not trust this power with the
[2:05:07] church it's hard to tell what you would
[2:05:09] do with it
[2:05:10] how could the father trust his business
[2:05:12] with a boy that might simply pollute the
[2:05:14] whole inheritance
[2:05:15] he couldn't do it the church has got to
[2:05:18] come to a place where

[2:10:08] really born again of the spirit of god
[2:10:10] what we need tonight is that type of a
[2:10:13] church

[2:10:17] believed it it had to be
[2:10:19] that is what the father's word was he

[2:11:02] not looking for the mysteries you
[2:11:03] believe
[2:11:04] you can explain he's looking for one
[2:11:07] character
[2:11:09] a vision had to do with the character of
[2:11:12] the church
[2:11:13] they stood pulled on the world and the
[2:11:16] power was pleased
[2:11:17] to vindicate them

[2:11:37] million miles because they denied this
[2:11:39] to be the truth

[2:11:43] the day
[2:11:44] for that drive to be formed

[2:16:12] inside
[2:16:16] sons of the original word we only
[2:16:18] produce what is on the
[2:16:20] inside so we are not on the outside
[2:16:24] looking out we are on the outside

[2:16:26] in and the inside now brings
[2:16:30] out see
[2:16:33] oh our character is murdered by what is
[2:16:36] on the inside of us
