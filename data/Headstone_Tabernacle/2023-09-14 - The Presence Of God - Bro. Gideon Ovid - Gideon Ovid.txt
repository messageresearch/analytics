to open the scriptures open the Bible to just a short scripture we want to read tonight from The Book of Psalms reading from chapter 51 just a few verses there first 10 to 13. hope everybody feeling fine okay and the scripture says created me a clean heart o God and renew our right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not the Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will I teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee may just bar heads oh Heavenly Father we deemed such a privilege to

pray that you anoint my thoughts and my words Lord puts it together like only you can Lord and we want to be careful to give you all the honor all the glory all the praise all the worship all the Adoration in Jesus name we pray amen amen just before you have your seats um we have a prayer request here just like to deal with it quickly and it's from Brother Sabu he said God bless you Saints please pray for my boss who was held up today and beaten please pray for his healing and may God speak to his heart for his salvation amen what a noble request Lord let's just buy heads once more oh Heavenly Father Lord you know the condition Lord of brother sabu's boss right now Lord Lord you know exactly what have transpired Lord Lord you know every ache and pain Lord you know every Affliction that might have been incurred Lord Lord I pray even now that your hand of healing and and deliverance will go and reach out and be upon him Lord I pray that you would would mend whatever has has been thrown out of joint Lord Lord any Affliction I pray that you will completely heal it that you were transforming that you would renew his mind Lord speak to his heart right now wherever he is Lord whether he's home whether he's in hospital wherever he is I pray that your Holy Spirit Will Minister unto him tonight Lord and raise him up and deliver him in Jesus name we pray amen blessed be his name you may have your seats so it falls on my lot to share a few words a night I pray that that you ride with me amen just for title it's the presence of God sounds simple but the presence of God far too often you know we we get caught up in going to church and and and we get caught up in going through the emotions but I just want to take a few moments to consider the presence of God and what it is and what it means and how we interact with the presence of God and what happens when we could recognize and acknowledge the presence of God and I want to say that the presence of God causes things to happen you can't enter the presence of God and experience the presence of God and and come back out the same way once you go into the presence of God something has to change you can't be the same you may have come here in a particular way but once you experience that presence there is no way you could walk out the same way once said he said you know sometimes you come to church and when you leave you're either better or worse but you can't remain the same way and his presence is so powerful the presence of God is so awesome and amazing it has some such fantastic attributes now tonight I want to delve into it a little bit and show and prove and realize and recognize that if we could only get into that presence and recognize the presence of God all things are possible there is nothing that's going to stand before you and your faith amen so I wondered why would would it be so important for David to see he said cast me not away from your presence no matter what he was going through it was so important to him that he said you know create me a clean heart and renew a right spirit in me the next line said in verse 11 he said cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me so he saw it having a great level of importance it was meaningful to him because he understood what the presence of the Lord meant it wasn't just something to say it wasn't just a a nice tagline some something that sounded good but it was very very important to him and in light of that for us in for a sub a subject I say it changes everything there's nothing that could remain the same so I want to look at recognizing his presence for a little bit and brother Branham in a message bid pins paragraph 29 you say Divine Healing is minor in the gospel he said you could never measure on a minor anyone knows that but it's bits it's used to get people to believe in the Supernatural presence or God the Supernatural is present and then by that if they can recognize his presence then they are healed see by faith believe it so when you recognize whose presence you are in your attitude changes you know in a natural sense if you realize you're somewhere and you see somebody that you deem of a high level of importance walks in you're kind of and adjust yourself a little bit you probably fix your clothes you want to look right you want to stand up straight you want to give them that level of respect because you realize that person is deemed to have a great level of importance now just think for a second that's what we do in the natural in the spiritual when you consider the presence of almighty God what would your attitude be like if you could just understand and recognize that that right now in the presence of God how much more would you worship if you knew in the presence of God how sincere would you be how open and honest and transparent and vulnerable you'll be if you know you're in the presence of God so I said when you recognize whose presence you're in your attitude will change and your mindset will be different it's no longer a going because no because I'm in the presence of God it's so important to me that I have to act right I have to live right I have to to do right because you give it or it's deemed to have that level of importance amen now with your mindset different your perspective your approach everything will change the way you see yourself will change because you understand that this is not easy going every day Everything is Everything no but I'm now in the presence of God and I know in the presence of the of God Anything is Possible my faith could could lock onto anything right now because with the presence of God it's not just we alignment on the road I'll be talking and laughing once you recognize you're in the presence of God all your trials that's a lot different you know all your challenges only difficulties only mind battles all these things that you think are obstacles and and it's big and you don't know how to wrap your mind around this In God's Presence it becomes so small so mind you it's so little because you realize he is so great he bigger than all that and his presence is all encompassing it kind of surrounds us and surrounds you he fills you with your love with his love with his Holy Spirit and you realize that I am nothing and he still worries me I'm undone what I could do because I'm the presence of such a holy God Amen like the woman with the blood issue all them people passing by and all of them standing up saying there goes the rabbi that's that's the guy that claims to be a prophet that's a fanatic and all such as that but what happened this little woman had an issue of blood and she had heard about him and when she came down there regardless of what anybody said she recognized what I would understood and she recognized who he was and she said if I could only touch His Garment you know the story see if I can only touch His Garment and when that genuine fit in God became a positive thing to her what did it release it released his power to heal her it touched him in such a way he turned around and told her what was wrong with her said your faith had saved you what did faith others and India might have been sicker than she was people are wrong you your neighbors your co-workers your friends your loved ones they may have more challenges and more problems than you but because you could recognize the presence that you're standing you realize your faith have a different kind of talking technology your faith could call out right now once more despite what the doctors say which reminds me and I just want to touch this briefly I don't know how many of you could remember there was a prayer request Sunday versus the popwell and I sat and I remembered it very very clearly the prayer request said from husband you know he prayed that they wouldn't have to do any operation any surgery and when I saw the message today I said you know surgery was scheduled and then the other message that came and said it wasn't necessary I say look at God he just liked to show off that was exact he didn't pray that she go through it you know with little pain or discomfort pray that she didn't have to undergo the surgery and and the doctors came and said listen we believe this could take care of itself the God we serve is so amazing that we can see it right in front of us I mean talk about Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's present tense as present tense as you could get no Jesus said your faith has saved you what did Faith understanding there may have been sicker than she but see she recognized his presence she knew that was her opportunity if we could only do that tonight people this brother Brandon was speaking if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us what we've got to recognize his presence is a common theme we need to recognize it we can't just exist and we don't know he's passing by right now and we don't reach out we have to recognize his presence his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest because he asked how do you recognize it when the promised word for this age is made manifest not the promise word for Moses age or any other Age The Promised word for this age now that's in a message called the presence of God unrecognized those things but you know today we have so many distractions we have so many things as a matter of fact in that message as the Eagles stirth he said you know some something you see I don't want to school here he said but I want you to know one thing we got too much television in our lives I don't know why I'm saying this tonight I just think it needs to be said we have too much television in our lives we want entertainment say God is not showing these things to entertain you is not to say you know somebody get healed as a good story that song was awesome we want you to recognize his presence that he's a present tense God that his presence is here right now that you could be filled today you do have to wait till tomorrow for your scenario to change when you go back home your situation could be different because he is just that kind of God but we have so many distractions we like to be entertained we like good stories we like to to talk about stuff to be cool Television Internet whatever is it distracts us from sometimes recognizing that gorgeous weaving right here a little flag a still Small Voice trying to speak to you but you're not hearing it because you're too busy too distracted by all the noise around you know I want to move forward a little bit so somebody attributes of his presence because I think if we understand just that phrase the presence of the Lord the presence of God if we could understand how powerful that is right then we will look at everything different we will speak different we will pray different we will operate the front because we know it's not a natural thing it's not just a hope and a prayer no we have such a faith and such of an assurance that he is here that he is a reward of them that diligently seek him then the very words we speak will have a certain power behind it we'll have a certain kind of knock we're not just Lord Lord open open the door we don't want to just search because he says sick and you shall find knock on the door will be opened you know so who when we have that kind of fervent effectual prayer and we pong as we know in his presence this thing has to happen tonight then nothing could stop us in the message a hidden life in Christ cargraph 18. he said now in the Old Testament there was what we call the outer courts we watch what was in the outer Court then there was a holy place or the first Veil and then inside the holiest of holies and what furniture was in the outer Court what was in the unveil the holy place and what was in the holy of holies now we're going to speak tonight on the holiest of holies the dwelling place where God himself dwells damn Daisy dwelt in his Tabernacle and today he dwells in you as his Tabernacle but we must make this place a dwelling not an outer Court place or the first holy place but we must live with God in the holiest of holies are consecrated hidden life alone quiet with God and here's what he said he said we become too excited upsets about too many things and in this day we say stressed out things bothering us all the time we can hardly think straight but he said we do too much too much of this it shows there's something like in the church ought to be a million miles up the road to what it is now we still back down in the Adolescent age fussing and fighting and quarreling and stewing when we ought to be consecrated hit away in the holiest of holies with God it's better that we come easy take our time see where we're going now and just like God living on those three courts he surely lives in the court of the congregation he lived you know here in the Holy place but his Abiding Place this was just attributes of his presence from the holiest of holies you know and when you think attributes one of the first I could think of is in Psalms psalm 16 11. when you say thou will show me that part of life in thy presence and you know a scripture there is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forevermore so it means his presence is not a not a bad thing you know you want to be there how many want your joy to be full to have fullness of joy you have Liberty to worship and to praise know when you're in his presence this is not because Cricket going on you know tkr win no this is because you're in the presence of God look at bask in his presence I know yeah the joy of the Lord is your strength there's healing in his presence there's healing in this presence often times you would see those he killing lines where brother Brown would say listen that's just the presence of God but once you step into the presence of God you don't just walk back out you know you don't just come for it's not at all it's not a guided tour come any presents and feel your presence and walk out no you come any presence because you want to change and you will leave changed yeah there is power in his presence in Psalm 68 8 he said listen listen he said the Earth shook the heavens also dropped at the presence of God even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God God of Israel so yes fullness of joy right but listen for transgressors for unbelief for sin for doubt is a shaken time the presence of God is Judgment unto them you know so you have to choose if you want to be on the side of joy and healing and power and strength deliverance and the presence of God too you just have to reach in the presence of God and you can see bands broken you could see chains loose in the presence of God in the presence of God listen even the weak they say they're strong there is strength in his presence you might be weak on the outside but in his presence you're like Samson the kind of strength is unparalleled it's paradoxical you can't even conceptualize or imagine this kind of strength this kind of power listen in his presence is life life forever more listen you know some folks says One Life to Live listen in his presence is where you have true life you have real life that's where you could live live in the presence of the almighty God also say in his presence there's Clarity is the reason why on the platform by the problem continue to answer the sun your name is so you live so you're suffering from Soul your father is so it's so clear it's so transparent there's no secrets in his presence in his presence everything become illuminated everything becomes bold everything becomes clear and it sounds like his presence is a great place to be amen that's where you want to be that's where we want to be but we know how these things go as great as it sounds there's always somebody look contrary while it sounds great somebody always want to duck the presents a little bit run from the presence a little bit disappear from the presence and we know it yeah there are times there's certain church and you dock any presents a time just stay home and and you call it you're taking a rest your back slitting a little bit but you're duck any presents you're doing the presence exposure so you're just running a little bit so I just want to touch on scenarios of people who run from the presence yeah from the beginning and I like examples in the beginning because they say nothing is strange to man nothing is foreign nothing is is is is new you know so in the Book of Genesis chapter 3 verse 8. and they say and they heard listen to this the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day so this is Adam and Eve they heard he was walking they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves not from God you know from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden the reason I say that it's instructive to see how it's written they were running from the presence from the very presence because I remember I said in the presence is Clarity you don't have secrets it's very clear it's very bold it's plain this is where your faith could reach out and you can ask what you will in his presence and and be familiar with this one in Jonah's case Jonah is famous for running from the presence of God In Jonah chapter one you'd have to find it from verse one to four it says now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amitai saying arise that great City and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me listen to verse 3. but Jonah rose up to flee on the tashish from the presence of the Lord and went down to Joppa and he found the ship going to chat to tashish so he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to go with them onto tashish from the presence of the Lord so he wasn't running from his country the state wasn't after him they didn't have a warrant of arrest they didn't have a summons to him but he was simply running from the presence of the Lord because the presence of the Lord there convicted him so much pressured him so much bothered him so much that he tried to run away that he tried to knock it and we know what happened in verse 4 but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty Tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken and in verse 10 if I drop down there you got then with the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him why has thou done this for the men knew he fled from the presence of the Lord because he had told them so he didn't tell them listen I run in from Home Alone I run in from my parents house I run him from that wasn't his story you know he was very sincere at this point he said listen you see me this is me I am running from the presence of the Lord because I currently stand to be in our presence because what I'm being assigned to do what I'm being commissioned to do what I'm being appointed to to do I don't want to do right now so I run in from the presence of the Lord and we saw where where that led you know I want to shift gears a little bit and I want you to bear with me a little bit because I want to reiterate that getting in his presence will change you there's no question about it there's no doubt about it I'm not making a suggestion to you tonight and declaring a fact if you could only get in the presence of the Lord you will be completely changed and I have proof that this is a hundred percent truth no I'm just going to read a little bit when we come into His presence we'll change never to be the same look all down through the ages of every Walk of Life at man look at Abraham you say well the change life is just for ministers oh no the change life is for everybody see now Abraham was a farmer but when he heard God's voice speaking to him and saw that Vision he was a changed man from that time on he separated himself from his Kindred from his associates and worked as a pilgrim and a Stranger in a Strange Land the rest of his life dwelling in tents because he clearly confessed that he was seeking a city whose Builder and maker was God he knew there was a God and there was a city somewhere whose building maker was God that's what Hebrews 11 tells us and he was seeking a city right whose building maker was God he was a changed man yet he wasn't nothing more than a mere farmer amen but he saw a vision and came into the presence of God and this is where Everything Will Change and he was a changed man from then on Moses was a shepherd but he was a changed man when he came into the presence of God he was a coward he was running from Fear after killing one man with a whole Army behind him but with a stick in his hand he went back and took the whole nation see why he came into the presence of God he was a changed manner Shepherd now this one Peter a fisherman he didn't know anything about God he knew about fishing right he knew all he knew how to do was to catch fish but when he came in the presence of God and you see the great Creator who could create fish when he told him and we heard it on Sunday to let down your nets and he had just pulling nuts up and and in the scripture he was washing the Nets was washing it off when he did that to pack up shop and God said listen castianet on the other side do it again because we're here now I only reach now we know I wasn't around before you were doing it on your own your way but now I am instructing you and in this presence here when you put your net down we know the end of the story you need help and even the help need help because these boats go and start to sink because you will see exceedingly and abundantly above all you could ask or think he said at Thy word Lord I believe that you're the Son of God and if you left if you let down your net you told me do it at your word because you and your word are the same I let down the Nets and when he began to pull he said depart Lord I'm a sinful man see a fisherman after Peter met Christ he was never the same anymore he after Wards was so true to God he was given the keys to the kingdom we are still listen to Paul Paul a cell style Pharisee educated and trained in all the religion there was in the world come before the pillar of fire one day and God that he had persecuted ignorantly he was a Pharisee he didn't believe that God was a man he knowed God was a pillar of fire it led his people out of Egypt it had been with them all along and when he saw this Pillar of Fire he fell on his face and he heard a voice saying Saul why persecute us down me he said who are you Lord he said I am Jesus he was a man that said how have you been baptized he had been in the presence of God he was a changed man from then on he had been in the presence you see it changes a man this is proof that you can't enter his presence or encounter his presence and be the same that's from a message in his presence I want to go on a little more to present tense Charles Finney he was a lawyer a great Philadelphia lawyer but when he came into the presence of God he dropped his law study and became a mightiest preacher the nation had ever heard he was a preacher because one day he came in the presence of God he taught he studied a Ministry you know his book he got his autobiography he went out to pray and and in short he he really felt he had an interesting gift he thought he could just go and he had some sermons and he will preach and he would go and hide and pray in secret but there were some ladies at the church I said listen you need to be filled with the Holy Ghost you need to be filled you need to have an encounter with the presence of God and you know what he said he was a lawyer he said listen you can't tell me anything I'm an educated man I'm qualified I have my sermons here I know I'm called to preach you are a liberals you can't tell you praying for me well bless God for you but I don't need anything he will go and pray until one day he went to pray he went aside and his boss came when his boss came he was praying he kind of jumped up surprise and he realized what he actually was was ashamed of God he was ashamed to be caught praying right so when that happened he remembered what these ladies were saying about him being filled with the Holy Ghost and being in the presence of God and that caused such a depth of sincerity in his heart that when he came back he started to cry and I don't know if I'll get to it but let me see if I could touch it a little bit you know so these ladies said we're praying for you sweet little woman he went on so every day he'd go behind his office his boss and all them there that you worked he'd go out behind the law office and go out there and pray and one day he was out there praying and he heard a bush break coming up yeah hunting him he jumped up real quick he was saying Lord God I believe you but when he realized the boss was there he said raise up and said looks around he recognized it was he the bush that broke and he said he realized that bush had broke for a purpose he stood there tears running down his cheeks and he said maybe them woman's right I'm ashamed for somebody to see me talking to my God but I think it was an honor for somebody to see me talking to my boss how much greater is my Lord than my boss said Lord forgive me and fill me with the Holy Ghost started screaming and shouting he was in the presence of God he run downtown real quick to his office he got screaming so hard he had to go behind the door said Lord I'll bring this Grace upon you hide me back here till I get over the spell why he had come in the presence of God he was a changed man the sermons that he used to preach he preached them same sermons and souls came to the altar it was more meaningful at that time see he had been in the presence of God amen I want to go on a little more Moody a little shoe cobbler hardly know what his ABC today we'll call him illiterate he hardly know this ABC that's right his grammar was poor somebody told him one day your grammar is awful poor Mr Moody he said but I'm winning Souls with it with my poor Grandma I'm winning Souls so don't worry about my grammar Our Winning Souls that's a man in the presence of God you'll see what I mean in a minute somebody told him one day a grandma's so poor you see a winning Souls wanted a newspaper editor went to write any newspaper he went over to see how could this man hold crowds of people under any conditions little old guy this is his description little old guy ball head and everything Whiskers hanging down kind of pot-bellied and he was a horrible looking man to look at so this newspaper really gave him a write-up they didn't see what in the world would anyone see in Dwight Moody he had all the characteristics of a failure yet he was pulling a crowd and holding a crowd and using bad grammar and still winning Souls they said he's ugly his voice is squeaky he's got whiskers plumbed down to his waistline he's a ball-headed as a pumpkin they said how in the world would anybody ever go to see anything in Moody so Moody's manager happens to see the newspaper and this is where he becomes interesting because this is when you understand where you are within the context of the presence of God when his manager saw it he said look Mr Moody I'll read this to you because Mr Moody couldn't read for himself Mr Murray couldn't read so he said I'll read you the editorial and he you know he read it for him and Mr Moody as I could only imagine right now shrug her shoulders and said in essence as we will say now I don't care what they say the people not coming to see me they come to see Christ and attacks and the story this is a man who understands his role position and who he is you know so he moved from a couple of making shoes for people to wear to to shorten Gospel of preparation why he was in the presence of God you know a little woman came one time come in the presence of God as guilty as she could be in a moment when she realized she was in the presence of God every sin was forgiven she was as pure as and white as a lily oh my how many more I could call off here of people time wouldn't permit but brother Brandon say I want to talk about myself I don't know who this is for tonight but I think this is such a blessing and was such a blessing to me I want to read it you say I want to talk about myself a little bit he said what could be any lower than me where was I come out of a family of drunkards come out of a family of murderers come out of a family of bootleggers and you know that every one of you know it know what kind of name we had here people didn't speak to us on the street I go downtown start to talk to somebody nobody would want to talk to me unless somebody wasn't around they were all embarrassed to talk to him they talked to me if somebody else comes up they would leave this is the prophet speaking now and I'd stand there and cry no they're saying so it can be this is so wrong but one day I come into the presence of God he changed me and made me another kind of son his grace brought me into his presence I've never wanted to leave it I'm now here 30 something odd years I don't want to leave it I've got the assurance that I'll always be there even death itself will never separate me from his presence no I'll be with him forever when I seen his presence the first time I cried like Isaiah what is me then he touched me with his grace I was a changed person consistent theme there is no way you could enter the presence of God and be the same and remain the same something has to change something has to break something has to happen said a little Renegade that used to get out here and carry on and everything must change and since then I have been his child since then I've desired to give my whole life first service only wish I had ten thousand more lives to give for him this one's getting pretty well wore out 53 years have passed about 33 of those and I just scroll up a little bit you know he said I never desire to leave this heavenly Place do they tempt her to persuade me after I've tried but I'm safe in God's Pavilion and happy in his love and grace I'm living on the Hallelujah side my it makes my heart Rejoice I'm recommending him to every weary person I'm recommending him to you that have no hope you that's never been in his presence the only thing you have to do is confess your sins and realize that you're wrong and God has that angel ordained tonight called the Holy Ghost that'll take all your sins away then you'll cry Lord here I am am I send me then you'll raise your hands and sing I will praise him I will praise him praise the Lamb for Sinners slain give him glory only people for his blood has washed away each thing I love him don't you living in the presence of God Amen that's from the same message in his presence I mean it just goes to show if we could only understand his presence if we could recognize this presence if we could acknowledge the power and purpose of his presence then no one will be the same way they came no one will be able to operate at the same level they operate now your your attitude your perspective your system your sight the way you see things will change if you could only listen to that still Small Voice let go and let God it changes everything his presence is everything brothers and sisters the Holy Spirit the presence of God the anointing of God the power of God is here to drive you to guide you to take you up to another level
