[8:32] and this is jesus speaking he said i
[8:35] have given them thy word
[8:37] and the world had hated them because
[8:40] they are not of the world
[8:41] even as i am not of the world i pray not
[8:45] that those shoulders take them out of
[8:46] the world
[8:47] but that doubt should escape them from
[8:50] the evil
[8:51] they are not of the world
[8:56] even as i am not of the world sanctify
[8:59] them through thy
[8:59] truth thy word is truth
[9:03] as thou has sent me into the world even
[9:06] so
[9:07] have i also sent them into the world and
[9:10] for my sakes
[9:12] for and for dear six i sanctify
[9:15] myself that they also
[9:19] might be sanctified to the truth neither
[9:22] pray i for these alone
[9:24] but for them also which shall believe on
[9:26] me through their word
[9:28] that they all may be one as thou father
[9:30] out in me and indeed
[9:32] that they also may be one in us that the
[9:34] world men believe the thou has sent me
[9:36] and the glory which thou giveth me i

[10:01] have your bibles or whatever
[10:03] sent it first thessalonians chapter four
[10:06] on verse one
[10:09] furthermore then we beseech you brethren
[10:11] and exhort you by the lord jesus
[10:13] and as you have received of us how he
[10:16] ought to walk and to please god
[10:19] so you would have bond more and more for
[10:22] you know
[10:23] what commandments we give you by the
[10:24] lord jesus
[10:26] and for this is the will of god even
[10:29] your sanctification
[10:30] that you should abstain from fornication
[10:33] that every one of you
[10:35] should know how to possess his vessel
[10:39] in sanctification and honor
[10:42] not in the lusts of concussive sense
[10:45] even as the gentiles
[10:47] which know not god that no man go beyond
[10:50] and before his brother in any matter
[10:53] because that the lord is the avenger of
[10:54] all such
[10:56] as we also have forewarned you
[10:57] untestified for god
[11:00] had not called us unto uncleanness but
[11:03] unto holiness
[11:04] he therefore that despise it he
[11:07] therefore that despise it
[11:08] despise it not man but god but also
[11:11] given us
[11:12] unto us his holy spirit and as touching
[11:15] bloody love
[11:16] you need know that i write unto you for
[11:18] ye yourselves are
[11:19] taught of god to love one another may
[11:22] god bless
[11:23] this world so god bless you tonight and
[11:25] tonight
[11:27] i haven't thought i'd like to share with
[11:29] you tonight
[11:30] uh taking this from the scripture of
[11:33] first thessalonians 4
[11:35] and um this particular verse we hear
[11:38] for this this is verse 3 for this is the
[11:41] will of god
[11:42] even your sanctification that's what i
[11:45] want to share with you this
[11:46] is the will of god even your
[11:48] certification
[11:49] is a bible study tonight what i'd like
[11:52] to do
[11:53] at this point is to read for you the
[11:55] amplified of that same scripture
[11:57] first thessalonians 4 verse
[12:00] 1 and he was talking about verse 3 for
[12:02] this is the will of god that you should
[12:04] be consecrated
[12:06] separated and set apart for pure and
[12:09] holy living
[12:10] and you should abstain and shrink
[12:13] from all sexual advice that each one of
[12:16] you
[12:17] should know how to possess
[12:21] control manage
[12:24] his own body in consecration
[12:28] purity separated from things profane
[12:31] and honor not to be used in the passion
[12:35] of lust
[12:36] like the hidden who are ignorant of the
[12:39] true god
[12:40] and have no knowledge of his will that
[12:43] no man transgress and overreach
[12:45] his brother and before him in this
[12:47] matter or default his brother in
[12:48] business
[12:49] for the lord is an avenger in all these
[12:51] things as we have already warned you
[12:52] solemnly until you blame me
[12:54] for god has not called us to impurity
[12:57] but the consecration
[12:58] to dedicate ourselves to the most
[13:02] thorough purity wherefore whosoever
[13:05] disregards
[13:06] or set aside and reject this disregards
[13:10] not
[13:10] man but god whose very spirit
[13:14] who he gives to you is holy chaste and
[13:16] pure
[13:17] and concerning verbally love for all
[13:20] other christians you have no need to
[13:22] have anyone right you
[13:23] for you yourselves have been personally
[13:25] taught by god
[13:26] to love one another okay so let's go
[13:29] tonight
[13:30] praise god to be sanctified to sanctify
[13:34] something is to set that personal thing
[13:37] apart
[13:38] for use sanctified is to be cleansed
[13:42] and separated for service
[13:46] and he said you know when we were born
[13:48] in the body of christ
[13:49] and christ died he said that really
[13:51] meant to bring our booth
[13:52] and that's the three elements that came
[13:54] out of the life of christ when he died
[13:56] there's water there is blood
[13:59] and there is spirit three elements that
[14:02] go through
[14:03] when we are born again justification
[14:06] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[14:08] spirit
[14:10] now hear what he says no that can
[14:13] all be in one act so in other words
[14:17] he is saying that a man could get that
[14:18] holy ghost justified sanctified
[14:20] several day goes in almost one act but
[14:23] you can be
[14:25] in a justified state which is as if
[14:27] inverted sin
[14:28] without being sanctified you can believe
[14:31] on the lord jesus christ and still
[14:34] carry your filth with you but you can
[14:38] absolutely live a justified
[14:41] and clean holy life and with all the
[14:44] holy ghost
[14:45] so they are treated at their record in
[14:46] heaven the father son of holy ghost
[14:48] trees are one
[14:49] and they're treated their record on
[14:51] earth water blood and spirit
[14:53] and they agree in one so if you have
[14:55] your bibles
[14:56] uh yokotan the second thessalonians
[14:58] chapter two and we want to look at the
[15:00] scripture the second thessalonians
[15:02] chapter two
[15:02] reading from verse thirteen to seventeen
[15:06] second thessalonians chapter two
[15:08] it's so good for you to be able to go to
[15:10] the scriptures
[15:12] and this is paul he said but we are born
[15:15] to give thanks
[15:16] always to god for you brethren beloved
[15:19] of the lord
[15:20] because god had
[15:24] from the beginning choosing you to
[15:27] civilization
[15:29] through sanctification of the spirit
[15:33] and belief of the truth i'll read that
[15:35] one again
[15:36] god hurt from the beginning chosen you
[15:40] to salvation
[15:41] how through what means through
[15:44] sanification of the spirit and the
[15:47] belief of truth well
[15:48] i until he called you by our gospel to
[15:51] the obtaining of the glory of our lord
[15:53] jesus christ
[15:54] therefore brethren stand fast and hold
[15:57] the traditions which you have been
[15:59] taught
[16:00] whether by word or or or epistle
[16:04] now our lord jesus christ himself and
[16:06] god evil father which had
[16:08] loved us and had given us everlasting
[16:10] consolation and good hope to greece
[16:13] comfort your hearts and establish you
[16:17] in every good work so you could see that
[16:20] paul here is establishing the fact
[16:22] that you have to be in word and work
[16:25] growing
[16:26] maturing established steady
[16:29] you're making progress so i don't want
[16:32] to see this as certification
[16:34] wesley certification a past age
[16:37] certification we passed that long time
[16:39] i don't you see that i want you to see a
[16:41] new view a fresh view of
[16:43] signification tonight so we're not
[16:45] talking about past age and john wesley
[16:47] no i want you to see this as a
[16:50] necessary part of the journey
[16:54] of sons and daughters on their way to
[16:56] adoption
[16:58] now the justification part you cannot do
[17:00] that yourself
[17:02] it is god that justified and if you want
[17:04] to suit the bible's roman 8 28 we could
[17:06] look at that
[17:07] romans 8 28 23 we want to read that
[17:11] that part you can't justify yourself
[17:14] let's see what the bible says
[17:15] in romans 8 28. for we know
[17:18] that all things work together for good
[17:20] to them that love god
[17:22] to them who are they called according to
[17:24] his purpose for whom he did for know
[17:27] that is his full knowledge now he also
[17:29] did predestinate
[17:30] or predetermined to be conformed to the
[17:32] image of his son
[17:33] the destination is to get you to the
[17:36] image that he might be the firstborn
[17:38] among my new brethren so jesus will be
[17:40] like big brother to us
[17:42] okay so verse 30. moreover
[17:45] whom he did predestinate demi also
[17:48] called
[17:49] now comey called demi also
[17:53] justified and whom he justified
[17:56] them he also glorified what shall we say
[18:00] to these things
[18:02] if god before us who can be
[18:05] against us he who speared not his own
[18:08] son
[18:08] but delivered him up for us all how
[18:11] shall he not with
[18:12] him also freely give us all things who
[18:15] shall lay
[18:16] anything to the charge of god's elect it
[18:19] is god that justified
[18:23] so i want you to know that this
[18:25] justification that picking up that dirty
[18:27] blast that's picking up duty you and i
[18:29] that picking up duty us it is god that
[18:32] did that
[18:33] and he did that based upon his full
[18:36] knowledge
[18:36] his foreknowledge is what constrained
[18:39] him
[18:39] to predestinate us to be changed to be
[18:43] transformed
[18:44] that is why god have no problem picking
[18:47] up prostitutes
[18:48] drunkards drug addicts all kind of
[18:50] cuckoo people
[18:51] and bringing them and cleaning them up
[18:53] and taking them and sanctifying them and
[18:55] fill them with power and spirit and
[18:57] presence
[18:58] and use them for his own glory now let's
[19:00] reflect back on something here
[19:02] whom he justified yet already glorified
[19:05] when we justified then he also glorified
[19:09] now in description text it says nothing
[19:12] about sanctification
[19:13] so sanctification is the labor and the
[19:16] struggle
[19:17] between justified and glorified
[19:21] it's the proven time it's tutoring
[19:24] it's behavior it is testing time
[19:27] or place of trial no signification could
[19:30] be
[19:30] viewed in two phases before you receive
[19:34] the holy ghost
[19:35] and after you receive the holy ghost
[19:37] because after receiving the holy ghost
[19:39] you still have to go through tutoring
[19:41] testing
[19:42] child child training behavior
[19:46] as we said that adoption is not based on
[19:50] a minister simon or minister's a teacher
[19:54] or the minister the office that he holds
[19:56] as a teacher or pastor
[19:58] that's not the basis of adoption the
[20:01] basis of adoption is behavior
[20:03] i want to say it again the basis of
[20:05] adoption
[20:07] is behavior and he says that is why the
[20:09] seven seals has been
[20:10] opened up revealed unfolded the mystery
[20:13] of god
[20:14] that we could see the plainness of god
[20:16] that we could know
[20:17] how to behave ourselves now
[20:21] you will get this now in galatians four
[20:23] if you turn your bibles to galatians
[20:24] four
[20:25] you would see what we're talking about
[20:27] tutors and governors
[20:29] and how is no game it's a program of god
[20:33] so if you go to galatians 4
[20:35] and we go to verse 1 you would see how
[20:37] paul
[20:38] shared this this thing about inheritance
[20:41] and what your predestination on 2
[20:43] and verse 1 of galatians chapter 4 we
[20:45] read
[20:46] now i see that the ear as long as he's a
[20:49] child
[20:49] different nothing from a servant will be
[20:51] lord of all
[20:53] so it means to say that at the child
[20:56] level
[20:56] inheritance is so distant so therefore
[20:59] the burden of god
[21:00] is to bring us to maturity and the law
[21:03] of these seeds still apply
[21:05] if you look in nature you look around
[21:07] life every plant you see
[21:09] human beings animal life the law
[21:12] of the seed still applies in which
[21:16] this seed doesn't look anything like the
[21:18] fruit
[21:19] but the seed has to go into the ground
[21:22] and through processes
[21:24] it comes back to the original life this
[21:26] is what this gospel is all about
[21:28] god put a seed in you you are the earth
[21:30] you like the shock of the earth
[21:32] are you like that dude that ground you
[21:35] are that ground that god put the
[21:36] treasure in
[21:37] you might not feel like a treasure you
[21:39] might not uh think you are treasure but
[21:41] god see you as a treasurer
[21:42] and because you see you that way he for
[21:45] knew you
[21:46] he called you and that treasure gotta
[21:48] work its way out
[21:49] something has to work it way out so god
[21:51] doesn't look at conditions so much
[21:53] you look at the predestination so let's
[21:55] read galatians four voice one now i see
[21:57] that the ear
[21:58] which is you as long as he's a child
[22:00] different nothing from a servant
[22:02] do he be lord of all but is under tutors
[22:04] and governors
[22:06] until the time appointed of the father
[22:09] even so we when we were children
[22:13] listen listen we're in bondage
[22:17] under the elements of the world but when
[22:19] the fullness of time
[22:21] was come god sent for his son
[22:24] made of a woman made under the law to
[22:26] redeem them that were under the law
[22:28] that we might receive the adoption of
[22:31] sons so don't go down that road you're
[22:32] not worthy
[22:33] and you're not worthy and you're not
[22:34] worthy don't go there don't go there
[22:35] just listen to what god's saying tonight
[22:37] and because your sons
[22:40] god has sent forth the spirit of his son
[22:43] into your hearts crying abba father not
[22:46] abba pasta
[22:47] apostle prophet but our father okay
[22:52] because your son because you are seed
[22:55] you can be reborn
[22:57] because you are son you could get that
[22:59] breakthrough you could get that
[23:00] victory you could get that overcoming so
[23:02] because your son
[23:04] god has sent forth the spirit of his son
[23:06] into your hearts
[23:07] crying out the father wherefore there
[23:09] was no more servant
[23:10] but a son and if a son than an ear of
[23:13] god through christ
[23:14] how be it when we knew not god you did
[23:17] service unto them
[23:18] which by nature are no gods but now
[23:22] after so then he's talking to believers
[23:25] now that come true
[23:26] but then they acting up a certain way
[23:28] but now after you have known god or
[23:30] rather
[23:31] unknown of god how to me again
[23:34] to weak and beggarly elements
[23:38] where upon you desire again to be
[23:40] bondage
[23:41] you observe these months
[23:44] times years i'm afraid of you at least
[23:47] are bestowed upon you labor
[23:49] in meme so paul was telling them oh gosh
[23:52] man
[23:53] god bring you out god call you
[23:56] god pull you so far you ain't pull
[23:58] yourself out you didn't justify yourself
[24:01] why are you going back why are you going
[24:03] back to begley elements
[24:05] why are you going back into that kind of
[24:07] bondage again
[24:08] of the law of legalism and so on you're
[24:11] observing days and months and times and
[24:13] years i'm afraid of you
[24:15] for less i have been stowed you leave
[24:18] her in vain
[24:19] now the scripture you read jesus said i
[24:22] sanctify
[24:23] myself for their sake
[24:26] so christ our example seed
[24:31] he choose to sanctify himself
[24:36] that means he give up certain things
[24:39] he pushed himself he kept himself
[24:43] for a higher order for for
[24:46] those disciples to get their break and
[24:48] he said lord
[24:49] sanctify them by thy truth thy word is
[24:52] true
[24:53] now listen our bibles now i want to show
[24:55] it in the old testament to joshua
[24:57] chapter 3
[24:58] and you want to read from verse 1 to 5.
[25:02] joshua chapter 3 verse 1 to 5.
[25:07] familiar scripture and joshua rose in
[25:09] the morning
[25:10] they removed from him and came to
[25:12] jordan he and all the children of israel
[25:14] lodged there before the passover and it
[25:17] came to pass after three days
[25:19] that the officers went to the host and
[25:22] they commanded the people
[25:24] saying when you see the ark of the
[25:26] covenant of the lord your god and the
[25:28] priest
[25:29] and the levites bearing it then he shall
[25:31] remove from your place and go after it
[25:34] yet there shall be a space between you
[25:37] and it
[25:38] about two thousand cubits by measure
[25:40] come not near to it
[25:41] that you may know the way by which you
[25:43] must go
[25:44] for you have not passed this way here
[25:48] before
[25:49] now watch so he's saying now
[25:52] there ought to be a distance between the
[25:56] act
[25:57] the word that the priest was bearing the
[26:00] ark of the covenant
[26:01] and the people and this is to let you
[26:05] know that this is the way you must go
[26:08] so all you have to do is to follow the
[26:10] ark
[26:11] because the priests are being directed
[26:14] if you follow the word
[26:15] it will take you to where you're
[26:16] supposed to go okay
[26:19] that is the first statement but look at
[26:21] verse 5 now
[26:22] and joshua said unto people sanctify
[26:26] yourself
[26:27] yourselves for tomorrow the lord will do
[26:30] wonders among you
[26:32] so even though the ark is going forward
[26:36] the people of the distance behind they
[26:38] know the ark
[26:39] the word they're gonna take them where
[26:40] they're supposed to go god
[26:43] demanded of them a certain behavior
[26:47] a certain thing they have to do in order
[26:52] to be ready for the signs that was god
[26:55] was going to do
[26:56] among them on the morrow and brother
[26:59] branham
[27:00] he types out an adoption and i want you
[27:03] to notice so
[27:04] this will anchor and get the right
[27:06] picture of this sanctification we're
[27:07] talking about
[27:08] all right you're talking about israel
[27:10] was brought over egypt
[27:12] and there were three stages of the
[27:13] journey one stage
[27:15] was leaving egypt the next stage
[27:18] was the wilderness and the next stage
[27:21] was kena
[27:22] now this three steps or three phases
[27:27] or whatever they want to put it in trees
[27:29] is everywhere
[27:30] you could find this type water blood
[27:33] spirit justification signification
[27:35] button holy ghost everywhere you can
[27:38] find these three steps
[27:39] two stages let's continue now canaan
[27:44] does not represent the age of the
[27:45] millennium it represents the own age of
[27:48] the overcomer
[27:49] now another things it brings and he yeah
[27:51] he's bringing it along
[27:52] justification by faith after believing
[27:55] moses and left egypt
[27:57] here we go sanctification was to
[28:00] follow under the pillar of fire
[28:04] and the atonement of the sacrificial
[28:05] lamb in the wilderness
[28:07] and then entering into the land that
[28:09] have been promised
[28:11] so friends is just really three steps
[28:13] then your problem was three steps
[28:14] justifications justification
[28:15] certification
[28:16] and holy ghost fill them and adopt them
[28:18] they were they were sealed inside out
[28:20] in the upper room restoration is four
[28:23] steps
[28:24] because the word fell into the ground in
[28:26] nicaea god
[28:28] took four steps to bring us back
[28:31] which is justification signification
[28:34] the baptism of the holy ghost by the
[28:36] pentecostals and then the word that came
[28:38] to the prophet
[28:40] malachi 4 william brown so then it
[28:43] needed four steps
[28:44] and that ties into what was said in
[28:46] jewelry i
[28:47] restored to you the years of the
[28:49] cankerworm the catabol
[28:50] the counter the kangaroo the caterpillar
[28:52] the palm oil
[28:53] and the lucas i i'm going to restore to
[28:55] you the years that they have eaten
[28:56] myself
[28:57] so that that is what that is about the
[28:59] bible identify those four beetles those
[29:01] four
[29:01] are worms and therefore god put four
[29:04] steps
[29:05] the scriptures cannot be broken
[29:08] so therefore sanctification is to follow
[29:12] under the pillar of fire and then the
[29:15] last part is entering into the land
[29:18] this is what he broke in to know what is
[29:20] the land
[29:21] promised to the new testament believer
[29:24] the promise is the holy spirit
[29:28] for it shall come to pass in the last
[29:29] days joel 28 that i poured my spirit
[29:32] upon all flesh
[29:33] your sons and your daughters shall
[29:34] prophesy and upon my hand minions
[29:37] and my made servants will i poured my
[29:39] spirit they shall prophesy i show
[29:41] wonders in the heavens above
[29:43] in the earth pillars of fire and smoke
[29:44] and vapor and peter said in their
[29:46] pentecost
[29:47] repent every one of you right and and so
[29:50] on right
[29:51] now did you notice joshua
[29:54] before they crossed jordan joshua said
[29:57] go to the midst of the camp
[29:59] and clean your clothes sanctify every
[30:02] one of you
[30:03] let no man come at his wife for within
[30:06] three days
[30:07] you will see the glory of god
[30:11] here we go are you ready say amen you
[30:14] just believe you're ready
[30:15] it is a process of getting ready
[30:20] to inherit the promise now i know church
[30:22] that if
[30:23] we see this tonight if we understand the
[30:26] person because the process is what
[30:28] people duck
[30:29] they don't want to go to the process of
[30:30] studying their exams two five years in
[30:34] school they end up with no papers
[30:36] because they fail that process
[30:39] their job opportunities become limited
[30:41] and if they do get a job
[30:42] it's not paying them as they would like
[30:45] all things in life have this part called
[30:47] process
[30:48] sometimes it takes 30 years you see they
[30:50] become an overnight success
[30:52] sometimes you take years in drilling and
[30:55] grinding to get that breakthrough
[30:57] it is the process the seed the plant in
[31:00] the ground to before the harvest
[31:02] you have to wait until the seed life
[31:04] unfold
[31:05] until it flowers until it be a fruit
[31:08] and delicious mature that you could have
[31:11] is that true
[31:12] it is the process of life we can't get
[31:15] around it
[31:16] you cannot expect a four-year-old to be
[31:18] mature before you have to go to five to
[31:21] go to ten
[31:22] fifteen eighteen you cannot adopt a
[31:24] four-year-old
[31:25] and tell them you're only business it
[31:27] doesn't even make sense
[31:29] the scripture doesn't have that it's
[31:31] their childish and the tutors and
[31:33] governors
[31:33] until the time appointed by the father
[31:35] so i want you to see
[31:37] even though the language promised even
[31:39] though joshua
[31:40] was in front of them and go tell them
[31:42] take the people over there was still
[31:44] a process and this is what the prophet
[31:47] said he's talking about our goal again
[31:48] go to the midst of the camp clean your
[31:50] clothes
[31:52] sanctify every one of you let the man
[31:54] come at his wife
[31:55] for within three days you will see the
[31:58] glory of god
[31:59] it's a process of getting ready to
[32:02] inherit the promise
[32:03] now the promise to israel was god gave
[32:05] the abraham the promised land of
[32:06] palestine
[32:07] and it was to be their possession
[32:09] forever and they was to remain in that
[32:11] land
[32:12] and they come through three stages
[32:14] coming to this promised land which is
[32:16] perfectly tight in the new testament now
[32:19] there are three
[32:20] stages of the journey and there are
[32:22] three stages of
[32:23] this journey so now we come up to earth
[32:26] we are justified by faith
[32:28] believing our lord jesus christ forsaken
[32:30] the land of egypt that is only coming
[32:32] out
[32:32] and then you are sanctified through the
[32:35] offering of his blood
[32:37] washed from our sins and become pilgrims
[32:40] and sojourners claiming that we are
[32:44] seeking a land
[32:45] a city that's coming over promise now i
[32:48] know a lot of people do like to think
[32:50] and come in and come in they say and
[32:51] comment like it postpones and leave it
[32:52] that is irrelevant
[32:54] this is the program of god they are only
[32:57] three stages not 55 stages
[33:01] three stages coming out
[33:04] wilderness land so they were sanctified
[33:08] to the orphan of his blood
[33:10] wash from sins and you become a pilgrim
[33:14] as a journal claiming that you are
[33:16] seeking a land
[33:17] a city that's coming or a promise so
[33:20] that israel in the wilderness
[33:21] sojourners no place to rest traveling
[33:24] night after night
[33:26] following the pillar fire but finally
[33:28] they come
[33:29] to the promised land where they settle
[33:31] down so that is where you settle down
[33:33] there's no settling down and if you
[33:35] reach promised land yet
[33:36] come on pack up and keep on journeying
[33:38] pack up and keep moving
[33:40] so there is where the believer comes he
[33:42] first comes to recognition
[33:43] the sinner he's separated by the waters
[33:45] washing of the water by the blood
[33:47] by the wood believing the lord jesus
[33:49] being justified by feet
[33:51] he become a partaker and peace with god
[33:53] through christ baptized in the name of
[33:55] jesus christ
[33:56] and on to the journey you get it into
[33:58] the journey
[33:59] then he becomes this agenda on the
[34:01] pilgrimage he's on his journey to what
[34:04] this is what a on journey to what a
[34:06] promise
[34:07] that god need israel here we go
[34:10] have not yet received the promise but
[34:13] they were on the journey
[34:15] have you received your promise if you
[34:17] have not read you received your promise
[34:19] you are on your way you are in the
[34:21] journey he said please
[34:23] do understand that's where the nazarene
[34:26] and peregrine willingness fell because
[34:28] israel
[34:29] when they come to the spot of kingish
[34:31] baniya when the spies aren't over
[34:32] understand the land is great but some of
[34:34] them come back and said
[34:35] we can't take it because the cities are
[34:36] walled up but joshua and caleb stood out
[34:38] and said
[34:39] we are more than able to take it because
[34:42] of their already signed up documented
[34:44] statement they believe in two works of
[34:46] grace
[34:47] justification and signification but
[34:49] could not go any further
[34:50] and listen the whole generation
[34:53] perished in the wilderness but two that
[34:56] went over to the promised land and
[34:58] brought back the evidence
[34:59] that was a goody line we are more than
[35:01] able to take it
[35:02] because it was god's promise then here
[35:04] we go instead of people
[35:06] going on receiving the holy spirit
[35:08] speaking with tongues
[35:10] receiving the power of god or baptizing
[35:12] the holy ghost and one of the miracles
[35:14] they felt would break down tradition
[35:15] what happened they perish
[35:17] in the land i wonder if this message
[35:20] works at a junction right now
[35:23] a jordan junction a junction where debt
[35:26] is required
[35:27] sanctification is required a preparation
[35:30] a preparation is required
[35:32] a process is required here it is
[35:36] the whole world under this corner virus
[35:38] anointed if it is that good
[35:40] everybody lock in shot in things are not
[35:43] normal things are not the same
[35:45] and after coming out of this it will not
[35:46] be everything but it changes
[35:48] the whole change but out of this
[35:52] there is a people in the land will see
[35:56] what is promised and they will go after
[35:58] it
[35:59] they will prepare their hearts for it
[36:02] they will press to watch it
[36:03] because that is the people that are
[36:05] going to have a vision you know without
[36:07] a vision
[36:07] the people perish because without a
[36:09] vision you have no focus
[36:10] away think about that if your vision is
[36:13] from islam
[36:14] you raise your staff you're moving on
[36:16] somebody say hello good morning good
[36:18] morning but you are so journal
[36:19] you're a pilgrim come here and come here
[36:22] i can't stop here
[36:24] you know why you're moving on so then he
[36:26] said hear this
[36:28] he said but the believers and caleb
[36:29] joshua outfit that was going on to the
[36:31] promise
[36:31] they moved over into the land they took
[36:34] the land
[36:35] settled down in the land as a possession
[36:38] so right now this message is a
[36:40] profession
[36:42] but it has to become a possession it's
[36:44] not a profession of what you believe
[36:46] i believe this doctrine i believe that
[36:48] doctrine i don't believe this doctrine
[36:50] they want people out
[36:51] and you never only laugh and because
[36:53] nothing is doctrine thing
[36:54] the doctrine has to be a vehicle or
[36:57] conduit
[36:58] to bring us into the channel of power or
[37:00] presence
[37:01] if the doctrine or teaching don't bring
[37:03] us dear something is wrong
[37:05] and that is why we talk about his sick
[37:07] seal ties up the
[37:08] loose ends which is all the doctrine so
[37:10] we can have a clean
[37:11] clear understanding of what took place
[37:14] and come face to face with our promises
[37:16] because from from malachi to matthew
[37:20] all those years where pharisees and
[37:21] scribes and strategies dominated
[37:23] the religious world at that time with
[37:26] olin scrolls and prophecy
[37:28] is only when john came it come to a
[37:30] focus point
[37:31] that there is somebody here talking
[37:33] about becoming messiah
[37:35] and john talking about there is one
[37:36] standing among so john shook up the
[37:39] place
[37:39] for hundreds of years they were in
[37:41] tradition that was left by the four
[37:43] fathers and the elders
[37:45] here it is a man no signs no wonders
[37:48] no miracles nothing special about him
[37:51] just a man commodity willingness i'm all
[37:53] repent repent and be activated
[37:56] to the trees a man talking that kind of
[37:58] talk and all of a sudden say there is
[37:59] one standing among you
[38:01] and you begin to identify the promise
[38:04] that was
[38:04] looked for in the old testament it is
[38:06] here
[38:07] it is present it is now that what john
[38:11] did
[38:12] so he said now the joshua and caleb
[38:14] outfit they went into the land and took
[38:16] it as a possession
[38:17] then he said we never stop at
[38:18] justification signification
[38:21] let us go on to the baptism of the holy
[38:24] spirit
[38:25] let us not stop at believing in lord
[38:27] jesus being baptized
[38:28] let us not stop because he cleaned us up
[38:30] from the life of sin but
[38:32] no no no i talk about tonight now we
[38:35] press on into opposition to a promise
[38:39] of the baptism of the holy ghost what
[38:41] peter said
[38:42] promises unto you and your children and
[38:44] then that are far off
[38:45] he must made the lord of god charcoal
[38:48] so sanctification of your human spirit
[38:54] this is is a good one and preparing this
[38:56] tonight
[38:57] i put on some stuff how can you be
[39:00] sanctified
[39:01] and you can't forgive think about it
[39:03] sanctification is the blood right
[39:05] and the blood for this age is what
[39:07] forgiveness so how
[39:09] bad how could people be sanctified
[39:13] and they can't forgive how could these
[39:15] people
[39:16] uh having odds and crutches and hate in
[39:19] this one and eating that one
[39:21] and talking this one and cutting down
[39:23] that one
[39:24] oh in the name of god could they really
[39:27] be satisfied
[39:29] in this message they can't forget
[39:31] because with sanctification
[39:33] and forgiveness you can have your
[39:34] healing once
[39:36] you're sick once you're looking for a
[39:38] healing you're in touch
[39:39] check your heart see if there's any
[39:42] unforgiveness there
[39:43] see if there's any oughts to you see if
[39:45] there are people that still
[39:47] bugging you and hit in your heart ask
[39:49] god to help you tonight
[39:51] to cleanse your heart and let it go
[39:54] don't hold it it will be a cancer tumor
[39:56] all kind of diseases will hit you
[39:58] when you have those things in your
[40:00] system bitterness it will put a boil in
[40:02] your system and
[40:03] put some chemical reaction or some demon
[40:05] jump in there and put some kind of
[40:06] friction in your body at you
[40:08] what do you expect so listen what the
[40:11] prophet said
[40:11] you can't repent for what adam done you
[40:14] never did it
[40:15] you just get forgiveness for what you
[40:17] have done but the old nature
[40:19] is still there so that's when somebody
[40:21] gets justified right
[40:22] you talking about in the human heart
[40:24] have a snake in it that is the sin
[40:26] that has a life okay and that
[40:29] sneak is what causing you to behave or
[40:31] you behave
[40:33] the other one have holy spirit and a
[40:35] different behavior with love and joy and
[40:37] long suffering
[40:38] the other one would sneak up malice and
[40:39] hatred and envy now
[40:41] when you ask or you are forgiven of your
[40:43] sins you only done this you're taking
[40:45] that away but the thing that made you do
[40:47] it is still dear
[40:49] that is the old root of evil so somebody
[40:51] coming to church
[40:52] doesn't make them a scene because they
[40:54] get baptized in jesus name and they are
[40:55] justified
[40:56] and god which we should you know justify
[40:59] them and
[41:00] save them and so like that he said the
[41:02] thing that causes you to disbelieve and
[41:04] bad behavior
[41:05] is still there it's the old root of evil
[41:07] he said no
[41:08] god forgive every sins and then secondly
[41:11] here we go
[41:12] secondly comes sanctification which sets
[41:15] our mind
[41:16] in order for holiness to think right so
[41:20] tonight
[41:21] i want to revive that i want to revive
[41:24] your
[41:24] thinking your mind in order for holiness
[41:28] you know i remember years ago people
[41:30] anytime you can't curse you
[41:34] and when people see you they change your
[41:36] language because there's
[41:37] no question coming up
[41:40] no people get insensitive to that people
[41:43] cussing you're not saying nothing
[41:45] that is not right you should see
[41:47] something you know i mean i
[41:49] i i'm not comfortable with this you know
[41:51] you have to reject certain things you
[41:53] want your spirit to be
[41:54] clean you want your spirit to be pure
[41:56] you want sanctification not for flesh
[41:58] just for flesh
[41:59] but the sanctification of your human
[42:01] spirit
[42:03] sanctification means uh sets our mind in
[42:06] order for holiness to think right
[42:08] and simplification is a compound greek
[42:09] word which means cleaned
[42:12] and set aside for service silly password
[42:14] tonight was clean
[42:15] so you can know where i go clean and set
[42:18] aside
[42:19] for service and the next comes the
[42:21] baptism of fire and holy ghost
[42:23] that god might dwell in us the fire of
[42:25] god
[42:26] cleanses our heart from sin and puts the
[42:29] holy ghost
[42:30] inside then we have we bring forth the
[42:33] same life that he did
[42:34] because he's in us so this is not you
[42:36] put another message quote
[42:37] and you put another message talk and you
[42:39] mentioned so many messages really
[42:41] message you
[42:42] god bless god bless you know what you
[42:44] may say performance you're not
[42:45] an actor you're not in hollywood what
[42:47] you want is fire
[42:49] fire from god to burn up the snake in
[42:51] your heart and your mind your spirit
[42:53] you want sanctification which is the
[42:55] will of god for your life
[42:57] okay so brother branham let's continue
[43:00] and i want to talk about the courts
[43:01] right
[43:02] you know the court it had the the the
[43:05] altar you had you walked off separation
[43:09] and you approached the courts and so on
[43:11] and the court was three parts
[43:12] outer court the holy place an emotional
[43:15] replace that's what i'm saying
[43:17] this three steps or three phases or
[43:19] whatever they want to call it
[43:20] it is everywhere so you have the outer
[43:22] court
[43:23] and under the outer court he says you
[43:25] live by justification
[43:27] and that's the sun out there the moon
[43:30] the light
[43:30] wherever moon last night under darkness
[43:34] and right now that's justification that
[43:35] altar some vacation now
[43:37] you were inside the holy place had seven
[43:40] golan kansas now this part is very
[43:42] important
[43:42] because i wanted to show where those
[43:45] seven golden campsites were
[43:47] they were in the holy place and of
[43:49] course in the most holy place
[43:51] was the sheikah in the glory and he said
[43:53] no at the altar
[43:54] that that that represented signification
[43:57] you didn't turn up on the sunday
[43:59] or the moon stars because they had seven
[44:01] candlesticks that gave them light
[44:03] but many a time they smoke up and they
[44:05] went out
[44:06] and that's the way people do okay so
[44:09] when
[44:09] they went into the holies of holies and
[44:11] those they dropped behind aaron once a
[44:14] year
[44:14] they didn't have living no moonlight
[44:16] starlight or gold and stuff a golden
[44:18] candlesticks under the interlock wind of
[44:19] the german
[44:20] the ship kind of glory was there they
[44:22] live in the light which never diminished
[44:24] a world
[44:24] they live on by the part of the manner
[44:26] they could eat anytime they wanted to
[44:28] it never got old what a life to live
[44:31] and that's the kind of life abraham was
[44:33] living a complete surrendered
[44:37] sold-out consecrated dedicated life to
[44:41] the lord
[44:42] and we call it sanctification they
[44:44] thought when they shouted they really
[44:45] had it the methodist
[44:46] nazarene boy as soon as i should shout
[44:49] the front road he didn't have it
[44:50] the pentecostal boy they spoke in
[44:52] tongues they already had it
[44:54] but if i know they didn't it doesn't lie
[44:56] upon shouting and speaking with tongues
[44:58] those things are all right but to have
[45:00] him is different
[45:01] that is attributes of him it means a
[45:04] sold out consecrated
[45:08] daily hourly life
[45:12] in the shekinah glory with him all the
[45:15] time
[45:15] that's right not as i am saying things
[45:19] against shouting and speaking with
[45:20] tongues
[45:21] that's fine that's the attributes of the
[45:23] holy ghost and so forth
[45:25] we need those things yet that's not it
[45:27] that's not it
[45:28] it's the hidden consecrated life
[45:32] remember those people out in the courts
[45:34] was eating the same kind of manner as
[45:36] was in here
[45:37] behind the golan uma because in the
[45:39] holiest of holies
[45:41] and there was lot walking right along
[45:43] with abraham was a believer too
[45:45] but he didn't have that
[45:49] constant abiding presence of god
[45:52] what not didn't have constant
[45:56] abiding presence of god one more time
[45:58] what not enough
[46:00] that constant abiding presence of god
[46:04] so when the husband got an argument
[46:06] abraham said we are brethren let's not
[46:08] have any arguments you take the east
[46:09] take the worst take the rest of the east
[46:11] wherever you want to go
[46:12] isn't that something though i find this
[46:14] is very uh noteworthy because
[46:17] you see the seven golden candlesticks
[46:20] represent
[46:21] the seven ages so therefore when you're
[46:25] talking about seven steps
[46:27] are you talking about the blood you're
[46:30] talking about this
[46:31] sanctification but the original
[46:33] comebacks to the
[46:34] end okay i'll say this way alpha
[46:37] omega and the processes in between
[46:41] i'm alpha ephesians church
[46:45] i'm omega in another ephesians church
[46:49] in between seven church ages
[46:52] so the seven church ages is the process
[46:55] well let's see it's a different way
[46:56] the seed go through processes
[47:00] which is the seven ages comes back again
[47:02] fruit
[47:03] come back to the original life at the
[47:05] end of that process
[47:06] so this is what this certification
[47:09] represent
[47:10] the blood theme future
[47:13] knowledge temperance patience codiness
[47:17] burly kindness it represents
[47:20] process what's the third step
[47:24] charity shekinah
[47:27] adoption glory and i could place it
[47:30] right here
[47:32] and you're familiar with this from the
[47:33] second coming of the lord the prophecy
[47:35] he's talking about the housewife that
[47:37] lost her coins and she swept all
[47:39] and she bought the cupboards until she
[47:40] found that she was lost and when she did
[47:42] she called her little sister churches to
[47:44] come now i don't care
[47:46] if your methodist baptist and because
[47:48] her presbyterian
[47:49] that was what he had said at that time
[47:52] of course
[47:52] but our time is sexy no seal half ceo
[47:56] left seal
[47:57] whatever condition is in this message
[48:00] when that time comes so this is the
[48:01] prophecy
[48:02] when the church finds watch is broadly
[48:05] love
[48:06] okay when the church finds its
[48:09] holy decency now this word here holy see
[48:12] you don't hear much about it
[48:14] and then you find the third part now
[48:15] when the church finds its place in
[48:17] christ
[48:18] it will call to the other members of the
[48:19] body come and rejoice with us
[48:22] god wants you to love him so again we
[48:25] find these three steps
[48:27] even in prophecy for our time when the
[48:29] church comes when the church finds one
[48:31] it's broadly love now faith to connect
[48:35] with charities based upon forgiveness
[48:37] if you want to pull along the camp if
[48:39] you want to have love
[48:40] if you want to have god's blessing you
[48:43] have to forgive
[48:44] because you need that fear that is based
[48:46] upon forgiveness so god wants you to
[48:48] love him
[48:49] so i wanted to show you again these
[48:51] three steps very love
[48:52] and what we're emphasizing that
[48:54] sanctification is this slot called
[48:56] holy decency and then you're going to
[48:58] find
[48:59] your place in christ so i believe we
[49:01] have to go back to sanctification
[49:03] the message has become polluted that
[49:05] people can live
[49:06] any kind of life and be in the message
[49:08] and be in and call is a christian
[49:11] that kind of good friends that cannot
[49:14] work
[49:15] that is how it has been for years if
[49:17] going forward it can't work
[49:20] this is time to tie up your loose ends
[49:22] this is a
[49:23] exhortation uh in line with what was
[49:26] spoken on sunday
[49:27] even and i was even thinking i know what
[49:29] i was going to share this evening but
[49:31] this is what
[49:31] i put in my heart to share god
[49:34] wants us to have a life god want
[49:38] what god wants is not examiners of
[49:40] doctrine somebody sit down with like
[49:42] some long beard
[49:43] tall hats and then this falls that falls
[49:45] that falls that off that off and they
[49:47] know everybody off and they
[49:48] sit down there as office could be
[49:51] dogwood here
[49:52] don't do that god don't want us
[49:54] examiners of doctrines or disputed of
[49:56] texts
[49:57] but of course desire is really seven
[50:00] live voices
[50:02] a light that thunders
[50:05] hebrews 13 12. you can find it if you
[50:07] want to find it he boosted into
[50:10] everlasting
[50:13] this is a good one beautiful scripture
[50:17] hebrews 13 12 way for jesus
[50:20] also that he might sanctify the people
[50:24] with his own blood suffered without the
[50:27] gate let's read it again
[50:28] wherefore jesus also that he might
[50:30] sanctify the people with his own blood
[50:33] suffered without the gate and this is
[50:35] what it has in the amplified
[50:38] therefore jesus also suffered and died
[50:41] outside the city's gate in order
[50:45] that he might purify and consecrate the
[50:49] people
[50:50] through the shedding of his own blood
[50:52] and set them apart as holy for god
[50:55] that's why sometimes i like to read
[50:56] the amplified it gives a fuller
[51:00] a view of the scripture the text this is
[51:02] so beautiful
[51:03] that uh he shared his own blood
[51:07] he went and suffered and died outside
[51:09] the gate the purpose of him shedding his
[51:11] blood
[51:12] is that we can become holy unto god
[51:15] and um about the bible say we believe in
[51:19] justification by faith romans 5 1.
[51:21] we believe that after a person being
[51:22] justified by faith
[51:24] he has peace with the lord jesus but
[51:27] it's possible
[51:28] that the same person could have habits
[51:29] such as drinking smoking
[51:31] and doing things that they would do
[51:33] filthy habits of the flesh then
[51:37] we believe that the blood of jesus
[51:39] christ
[51:40] sanctifies this person for the service
[51:42] of the lord
[51:43] we believe in sanctification and he read
[51:45] the scripture hebrews 13 12
[51:47] where jesus also he might signify with
[51:50] the people with his own blood suffered
[51:51] throughout the gates
[51:52] and we believe that sanctification is
[51:55] taught in the new testament
[51:57] and meant for the believers through the
[51:59] new testament age
[52:00] which we are now living so this is not
[52:03] where it's reminded we pass an eviction
[52:05] we have seals is that right
[52:09] let's continue but we also believe
[52:12] that after the person has been satisfied
[52:16] the unclean habits has gone from the
[52:18] person he is a believer
[52:20] on the lord jesus christ his habits are
[52:22] gone we believe that then he is a
[52:24] candidate
[52:25] for the baptism of the holy spirit which
[52:28] come
[52:29] as a filling of the believer so all the
[52:32] bad habits on clean habits filthy habits
[52:34] get fire bombed
[52:36] and your life gets sanctified you cry
[52:38] out to god to get cleaned up
[52:40] you get your illusions tied up your
[52:42] candidate
[52:43] to be filled with the holy ghost it's
[52:45] just as many times i've taught
[52:46] by picking up a glass out in the chicken
[52:48] yard justification
[52:50] is picking up ready to use it with a
[52:52] purpose in heart
[52:53] that's what god does to a sinner he's
[52:55] still filthy then he cleansed by the
[52:57] blood of jesus christ
[52:58] and the word sanctifies a compound word
[53:01] which means
[53:02] clean and set aside for service and in
[53:05] the old testament the altar
[53:06] sanctified the vessel and it was set
[53:08] aside for service
[53:09] we believe that the holy spirit is
[53:13] the same vessel in service that the holy
[53:16] spirit is not another step of grace
[53:18] but more of the same grace that fills
[53:21] the believer
[53:21] to the extent where signs and wonders
[53:25] such as the apostolic gifts spoken in
[53:27] first corinthians 12
[53:28] manifest themselves truly believers when
[53:31] the holy spirit comes in to take up
[53:33] the gift so root servant
[53:37] is the sanctification part the labor
[53:40] part
[53:41] you're working out your own salvation
[53:43] and fear and trembling part
[53:45] the getting rid of the filth and the
[53:47] sanctification of the human spirit
[53:49] which is the legalistic part of the
[53:52] things that you can do
[53:53] you see we talk about who he called he
[53:55] called it justified you just fired or
[53:57] glorified
[53:58] already glorified and in between he said
[54:00] nothing about sanctification
[54:02] because with your appreciation of god
[54:03] justifying you shall give you a love and
[54:06] a praise and worship to god
[54:08] that you willing to do the necessary
[54:10] cleanup acts
[54:11] the necessary separation the necessary
[54:14] sacrifice
[54:15] and turning eyes on woman you know to
[54:17] keep yourself sanctified to pray every
[54:19] day and
[54:19] read your bible are you doing things
[54:22] that were going on please squad
[54:24] and brother branham said this right here
[54:26] that's what the church
[54:27] is in order it's got the mechanics ready
[54:29] it only need the dynamics tonight
[54:31] if we can get the mechanics ready and
[54:34] the first thing he said
[54:35] get our hearts right you know in one way
[54:38] we could talk about mechanics all the
[54:39] wooden the seeding and the seed and the
[54:41] wood in the bride and so on
[54:42] but this part is so important to get our
[54:45] hearts right
[54:46] it's about the things that we
[54:50] can do follow every word
[54:53] follow him in baptism follow him in
[54:55] every order that he told us to do
[54:57] every mechanic ready and stand here then
[55:00] we are ready for dynamics
[55:02] to be lit off and only god can do that
[55:04] that's to drop into your heart
[55:06] that feet that says i am now healed okay
[55:09] so let's take a slow walk right through
[55:12] this here now let's take a slow
[55:13] spin on the car and let's drive over
[55:15] this you know
[55:16] tonight if we get the mechanics ready
[55:20] get our hearts right the things
[55:24] that we can do are there things that you
[55:27] have to do
[55:28] are they things that still outstanding
[55:30] are these things that still need to be
[55:32] corrected
[55:33] other things still need to repent of
[55:34] editing still to work on or whatever
[55:37] stitch up you have things to do then
[55:39] your the mechanics are ready yet for you
[55:41] so so you are limited to have faith for
[55:44] dynamics because
[55:46] your condemnation or your heart doesn't
[55:48] allow you
[55:50] the full freedom of faith to believe god
[55:52] for all things
[55:53] so you wouldn't have the confidence to
[55:56] say lord
[55:57] i've served you all my years you know
[55:59] that man who god did notice that he was
[56:00] going to die
[56:01] god i saved you all these years you know
[56:03] god spend my life giving and god
[56:05] send back a word to the prophet i've
[56:06] heard it i've heard it
[56:08] i can't say that all pull some more time
[56:11] that man knew he had access at my new
[56:16] this is how you ought to be this is how
[56:19] we are ought to be
[56:20] to know that it is well with my soul
[56:26] i just a little more again um
[56:30] this one is a big one satisfication
[56:33] is when your name goes on the book as a
[56:35] believer
[56:36] your name is wrote in blood this is from
[56:40] question and answers signification does
[56:42] that
[56:43] you come up and say and when he trusted
[56:45] you up this far then come
[56:46] and say well you would he know it yes he
[56:48] know that he
[56:49] know you wouldn't do it from the
[56:50] beginning he know judas wouldn't do it
[56:52] but he know what you will do
[56:54] he says satisfication is when your name
[56:56] goes on the book as a believer
[56:58] so when you live a sanctified life oh
[57:01] glory hallelujah
[57:03] you're only proving the name of the book
[57:05] could i hear a show
[57:09] oh is there anybody shouting there
[57:10] tonight or give
[57:12] some god some glory how is this
[57:14] wonderful tonight
[57:15] glory signification is when your name
[57:17] goes on the book as a believer right
[57:19] the name is root in blood let's turn to
[57:22] hebrews 4 12
[57:25] and let's read from this one it's a
[57:27] familiar scripture
[57:29] the scripture that i love uh
[57:32] let us therefore fear lisa promise being
[57:35] left us of entering into his rest
[57:37] any of you should seem to come short of
[57:39] it this is hebrews
[57:40] chapter four verse one verse two week
[57:42] off for unto us was the gospel preached
[57:44] as well unto them
[57:45] but the word preached did not profit
[57:46] them not being mixed with feet in them
[57:49] that heard it
[57:50] let's pause your minute holy page molesk
[57:52] first right there
[57:53] so think about it now somebody messaged
[57:56] 40 years and they're
[57:57] mixing it with their feet somebody just
[57:59] come in last week
[58:01] and yeah their feet are mixing with up
[58:03] with it watching happen
[58:04] that 40 year old some good day 40 years
[58:07] and being left behind you know
[58:08] somebody backs in 20 years and somebody
[58:12] did in church for 40 years
[58:13] and he backs it in person 20 years walk
[58:15] into the church and begin to receive the
[58:17] word and mix it with faith you see you
[58:18] going on there right now
[58:19] that person without faith is left back
[58:21] here because all things of god is a
[58:23] faith
[58:23] it's not your feeling it's not the ears
[58:25] is that not getting old
[58:27] it's not that so let's go again those
[58:30] two for under us was the gospel preached
[58:32] as well unto them but the word preached
[58:33] did not profit them
[58:35] not being mixed with faith in them that
[58:36] hood so if you want to profit with what
[58:38] you're hearing
[58:39] you have to mix it with faith faith have
[58:41] action with it faith is not just saying
[58:43] amen oh that was a good exaltation of
[58:44] the night i like it no
[58:46] that's not it if you recognize the word
[58:49] coming to you you have to act on it
[58:51] to sink it in the nail it in for verse 3
[58:53] now for if
[58:54] we which have believed do enter into
[58:56] rest as he said
[58:57] i've sworn in my heart if he shall
[58:59] entered in my rest although
[59:01] the works has finished from the
[59:02] foundation of the world for he speak in
[59:05] a certain place of the seventh day and
[59:06] this wise for god
[59:07] that rest the seventh day from all his
[59:09] works and in this place again
[59:11] if they shall enter into my rest not
[59:14] yours his rest
[59:16] seeing therefore it remained that some
[59:19] must enter therein
[59:20] and data who was first preached entered
[59:22] not in the cause of unbelief
[59:24] we sever again he limited a certain day
[59:27] same and david today
[59:28] after so long a time as it said today if
[59:30] you will hear his voice
[59:32] had not your hearts for if jesus had
[59:34] given them rest
[59:35] then would he not have after what i
[59:37] spoke with
[59:38] then the verse nine the bomb they
[59:40] remained therefore arrest
[59:42] to the people of god for he
[59:46] that is entered into his rest
[59:49] he also has ceased from his own work as
[59:52] god did from his and this is the verse i
[59:55] want to get to
[59:56] let us labor therefore
[59:59] to enter into that rest at least any man
[1:00:03] fall after the same example of unbelief
[1:00:06] and if you have your bible in front of
[1:00:07] you let's say together let us
[1:00:10] labor therefore to enter into that rest
[1:00:14] least any man fall after the same
[1:00:18] example of unbelief so that laboring
[1:00:21] part
[1:00:22] is the work part is the effort
[1:00:26] it is the pushing it is the legalistic
[1:00:29] part
[1:00:30] it is the sanctification part it is
[1:00:32] depression
[1:00:33] to what that is what that is about so
[1:00:37] faith is the start
[1:00:40] and charity is to rest
[1:00:43] and in between you're adding virtue your
[1:00:46] portion for knowledge
[1:00:47] you're pressing for temperance and
[1:00:49] patience and godliness
[1:00:51] and broadly kindness and as you head up
[1:00:54] at his
[1:00:54] narrows you're getting to be more like
[1:00:57] jesus
[1:00:58] not less like jesus not more arrogant
[1:01:00] and your bad behave
[1:01:02] and you want to explode and you're
[1:01:04] carrying on
[1:01:05] and the same way you behave and answer
[1:01:06] about 15 years ago
[1:01:08] he's taken the same as it was 15 15
[1:01:11] years and you see him today that makes
[1:01:12] no sense
[1:01:13] you ain't grow just get old stop getting
[1:01:16] old grow
[1:01:19] grow so this message really
[1:01:22] the message of they are this seven
[1:01:24] thunder blood message
[1:01:26] supposed to bring on whole recency
[1:01:28] should bring on a
[1:01:29] sanctified bunch of people so hear what
[1:01:31] the prophet said almost done
[1:01:33] the holy spirit you are believing unto
[1:01:34] eternal life but when the holy spirit
[1:01:36] comes in
[1:01:37] it is eternal life you are begotten
[1:01:41] of the spirit at sanctification
[1:01:44] so that is why he said the pentecostal
[1:01:48] the mysteries couldn't be given to them
[1:01:51] because they were begotten so he was
[1:01:54] showing the pentecostals really was in
[1:01:56] the womb
[1:01:57] they didn't come true yet because they
[1:02:00] were in the womb
[1:02:01] so when you claim he's your claim is
[1:02:03] only a begotten son i claim this
[1:02:05] i claim virtue and i claim knowledge and
[1:02:07] i claim and have this revelation and
[1:02:09] you're making all your claims
[1:02:10] that is just the baby on the inside
[1:02:12] they're very big maybe
[1:02:14] bunching punching and maybe moving and
[1:02:16] so on word on top of word of a word
[1:02:18] begotten sign
[1:02:19] but born means it may become true okay
[1:02:22] and if i really come true
[1:02:24] the a woman don't just have a big belly
[1:02:26] and then the baby oh god the guy baby is
[1:02:27] okay
[1:02:28] oh it reached no that's something called
[1:02:31] labor pains
[1:02:32] that's a reach it have labor
[1:02:36] and you talk about when the church is
[1:02:38] groaning under the persecution of the
[1:02:41] outside world that the holy ghost is
[1:02:42] real and how they groan
[1:02:44] how they cry and the labor pains when
[1:02:46] they are born and positionally born
[1:02:48] then god says in the church okay people
[1:02:51] don't want to talk about the old
[1:02:52] old-time holy ghost now
[1:02:53] they like to talk about the holy ghost
[1:02:55] translation which is fine
[1:02:57] like to talk about we are the holy ghost
[1:02:58] all kind of different
[1:03:00] same baptist doctrine you don't have the
[1:03:02] holy ghost you don't need nobody
[1:03:04] that is doctrine and steroids but this
[1:03:07] what we're saying here now
[1:03:08] is that you are begotten of the spirit
[1:03:10] of signification but never
[1:03:12] born of the spirit until
[1:03:15] the holy ghost comes down he said that's
[1:03:17] correct a baby got life in the war of
[1:03:19] the mother little mother quivering it's
[1:03:21] a life
[1:03:22] but it's a different life when it breeds
[1:03:26] the bread of life
[1:03:27] into its nostrils so first corinthians
[1:03:31] 12 2
[1:03:32] i'll read this one under the church of
[1:03:35] god which is a current
[1:03:37] to them that are sanctified in christ
[1:03:40] jesus
[1:03:40] called to be saints oh glory hallelujah
[1:03:45] who is sins them that are sanctified in
[1:03:48] christ jesus
[1:03:49] one more time who is saying again you
[1:03:51] know people talk about because it
[1:03:53] doesn't mess with it because it and if
[1:03:56] you're not satisfied you're interested
[1:03:58] saint is sanctified one
[1:04:01] okay so he says to them that are
[1:04:05] sanctified in christ jesus called to be
[1:04:08] saints
[1:04:08] but all that are in every place call
[1:04:11] upon
[1:04:12] the name of jesus christ our lord both
[1:04:14] tears and ours
[1:04:15] i want you to find this one ii timothy
[1:04:18] 2 15. we're almost there i hope
[1:04:22] i hope you really enjoy this session
[1:04:24] tonight uh second timothy two
[1:04:26] you want to read from verse 15 and this
[1:04:28] is exaltation i trust it inspires you
[1:04:31] tonight
[1:04:31] it is study to show itself approved unto
[1:04:33] god a workman that near not been ashamed
[1:04:36] and this is what we share in the
[1:04:37] nineties to help you
[1:04:38] uh be that kind of workman rightly
[1:04:41] dividing the world of truth because the
[1:04:42] word of truth could be wrongly divided
[1:04:44] so the word of truth need to be right to
[1:04:46] divide sean profane and vain babbling
[1:04:49] but they were increased unto more
[1:04:50] uncoordinated then talk
[1:04:53] old talk long talk have no profit on it
[1:04:55] kill it
[1:04:56] walk away from watch they will
[1:04:59] increase the moon goddess and their wood
[1:05:01] will eat us as dr kanka
[1:05:03] of whom hymenias and philitus who
[1:05:06] considering the truth have heard these
[1:05:08] are virgins who went off track
[1:05:10] saying that the resurrection is passed
[1:05:11] already and overture overthrow the fate
[1:05:14] of some
[1:05:15] so these guys who have some cocoa
[1:05:17] revelation
[1:05:18] to some people paying off the foundation
[1:05:21] 19.
[1:05:22] nevertheless the foundation of god's
[1:05:24] standard show the consolation
[1:05:26] having the seal the lord knoweth them
[1:05:28] that i is
[1:05:29] and tonight that everyone can name it
[1:05:32] the name of christ
[1:05:33] depart from iniquity and inequity is you
[1:05:36] know better you know right and doing
[1:05:37] wrong that's
[1:05:38] inequity cut it out stop it this is the
[1:05:41] order from the word here now
[1:05:42] that everyone that name it the name of
[1:05:44] christ depart from inequity
[1:05:46] and here we go but in a great house they
[1:05:49] are not only vessels of gold
[1:05:51] and silver but also of wood and of earth
[1:05:55] some to honor some to this honor if a
[1:05:58] man
[1:05:59] here we go therefore purge himself
[1:06:02] from these hallelujah
[1:06:06] so they have men
[1:06:09] they have everybody hearing what is
[1:06:10] being said tonight and what the prophet
[1:06:12] said on the books on the teams
[1:06:14] but this is the partner where
[1:06:17] the things that you can do at your heart
[1:06:20] right
[1:06:21] but the things that you can do if a man
[1:06:25] therefore pulls himself from these
[1:06:28] he shall be a vessel of the honor
[1:06:32] sanctified and meet for the master's use
[1:06:37] and prepared unto every good work verse
[1:06:40] 22
[1:06:41] free also youthful lust and follow
[1:06:44] righteousness
[1:06:45] faith charity peace
[1:06:48] with them that call on the lord out of a
[1:06:51] pure heart
[1:06:52] follow these things but foolish and
[1:06:55] unknown
[1:06:56] questions avoid knowing that they do
[1:06:58] gender strife
[1:07:00] there are some people like to say
[1:07:01] something make sure you see about
[1:07:03] something too and if you are sure what
[1:07:04] you're talking about
[1:07:05] is a whole big melee a whole big stuff
[1:07:08] kill it i can say frankly i don't know
[1:07:10] everything
[1:07:12] but what god show me i could speak what
[1:07:15] god revealed to me i have authority with
[1:07:17] and anointed with and that is what i
[1:07:19] could go by
[1:07:20] every man have their own measure of
[1:07:22] grace and faith i don't
[1:07:24] want somebody else's measure i want to
[1:07:26] work with the measure that god has given
[1:07:27] me
[1:07:28] so i if i don't know i would say that
[1:07:30] above my paid grade i don't know
[1:07:32] i don't know i don't know everything i'm
[1:07:34] not good see
[1:07:35] foolish i'll learn questions avoid
[1:07:37] knowing that it's gender strife
[1:07:38] but the servant of the lord must not
[1:07:40] strive but be gentle unto all men
[1:07:43] up to teach and patient in meekness
[1:07:46] instructing those that oppose themselves
[1:07:48] if god power adventure will give them
[1:07:49] repentance to the acknowledgement of the
[1:07:52] truth
[1:07:53] and that they may recover themselves out
[1:07:54] of the snare of the devil
[1:07:56] who has taken them captive by him at his
[1:07:58] will
[1:07:59] oh my you love him tonight and this

[1:08:40] of time the sacrifices which can never

[1:08:47] offered
[1:08:47] one sacrifice for sin forever sat down
