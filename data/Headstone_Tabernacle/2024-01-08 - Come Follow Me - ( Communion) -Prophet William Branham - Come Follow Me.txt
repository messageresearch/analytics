bless you you may be seated you kids let's just uh let's have a little word of prayer Lord Jesus we are grateful for this time to know that we're assembled here the young and old and the middle-aged and we have assembled the side of Eternity once more to speak about you and about the things that pertains to everlasting life these young ones sitting in here tonight some of them are graduating some is already graduated but I realized Lord something had happened just a few hours before that great shock or great blast had taken place in the mountain up there north of Tucson when the angels of the Lord came down I remember what was said and and especially about the young people I pray the Lord help us to understand and may I'll be able to say something to these young folks tonight that'll help them along the journey for Lord we all need that help at this time bless us together forgive our sins and if anything that we've done since we've been out here that's displeased you we pray you forgive us for it for we realize today that we have no no guarantee of Tomorrow we don't know what tomorrow brings we must be prepare today to meet tomorrow and father God there's only one way that we know to do this that's to prepare to see you for by and by we realize that we are all going to do it and we've got to meet it some sometime either in peace as a friend or child or as an enemy far be it Lord that we be anything else but your own beloved children Grant these things we ask in Jesus name amen today while I was chopping weeds really early this morning I found a place in the Bible I thought would be a good thing to read at this time and it's uh may not be too dashing appropriate but I thought this for just a just a few minutes to talk and we'll read this out of the 18th chapter of St Luke all four gospel writers right of it the 18th chapter and the 18th verse and a certain ruler asked him saying good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save one that is God th knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and mother he said all these have I done and kept them from my youth up now when Jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lackest thou one thing sell all thou has and distribute unto the poor Thou shalt have Treasures in Heaven come follow me I think the word come follow me that' be the best advice I could give if I was talking to 10,000 kids or if I was talking to just what I am it's a command and the greatest thing that I think was ever offered anybody and especially a young person follow me you're going to follow somebody uh you just can you remember that you're going to follow somebody and the way you follow the person be sure that who this person's following see we Paul one time said be followers of me as I am of Christ another word just as I follow Christ you follow me and now at this turning point this this stage of life where we all come and many times you've heard me holler Ricky Retta and things that it's the age it's the age that we're living in it really isn't those people those people are people like we are those kids out here these hot rods running up and down the street and carrying all the way they are smoking cigarettes and drinking liquor girls dress in Marley and thing them girls and boys like we are see they're human they love they eat they drink they sleep they breathe they got to die they people just like we are and yet they have been uh they've been possessed of an evil spirit they don't know it not because of of the people but because sometimes some leader that they've been following have let them in the wrong road now you girls and boys know better than that you know you've been taught better than that got better parents Sounder training and to do a thing like that you know better but they don't see because the church that they go to uh are modern churches modernistic and they they just live for the day more poer and oh my what's the morals become virtue to them see so they what is it said one time in a play that I seen down here not long ago of Sodom and Gomorrah that uh evil possessed woman said to the lot what you call uh immoral I call virtue Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so will it be at the coming of the son of man so we're back to that place again let's look at this fell for a few minutes that we read about no doubt that this kid was born in a good home like you kids are he's brought up with good parents because it proved it when Jesus uh presented to him the Commandments of God he said I've kept these s of Youth it showed that he had he had been he had been brought up right he wasn't just a snatch out and you know he he had been brought up to know what right kids like you all are probably come up under a God-fearing Mother and Daddy to tr to to teach him right when he was a kid well that's good maybe he a a little baby his mother uh had high Ambitions of him being a great man Som days his father's worth money that could School him and and get him an education that he could he'd come out with with a good education to be able to be something in the world and with the sincerity of this mother and dad uh educating this kid and perhaps come to his graduation time like you are see the time when he passed through his school and had his education no doubt it perhaps was a pride and joy of of that mother and daddy's life no doubt in them days he had a fine horses like you have automobiles a good dad and mother like you all got that cease toat you got a good clothes and and a car and can just enjoy life just something like you have today and the father and mother with the praying constantly that that their son would not turn out just an ordinary man that he'd be an extraordinary man all parents want that did you hear Jesus refer to that commandment honor the father and mother and stop and that's the ambition of any parent to do the best for their children to can educate them give them things maybe they wasn't able to get that's what I feel about my children I think sometime in going to school I think send Becky and Sarah and Joseph into these high schools and things were all this go on that I think I'll take them and get back into the mountain and and and raise them up there they like the Indians live but here's what it is what's in the kids going to come out no matter where it is it's got It's going to come out if it's evil in there it'll come out in the Indian Camp is good in there it'll come out in any Camp see it's what's in the kid the makeup of the kid what's on the inside of you and what you are now is what you probably be the rest of your life you're on the changing spot do you know one 86% of the conversions to Jesus Christ is done before 21 years old shows the statistic shows it 86% that come to Christ come before they're 21 you if you pass that age you become more molded or set in your ways well it's possible sure they come 70 and 80 years old but it's very rare you make yourself when you're young you set your Ambitions to what you want to do do and what you're trying to achieve in life you think of it and as you think of course your mind is presented into your mind by an unknown something and it dominates your mind and then when it becomes in your mind then you speak it that you're going to do it then your Ambitions drive you to it so mother and father expecting this young man to his Ambitions to be great enough money to carry it out and then no doubt prayed that this this young lad would would get that opportunity you see they they had done all they could do he'd maybe having fine horses and and maybe he very popular amongst the women and if what would go for a man would be for woman vice versa see because we're talk by human life Souls both men and women and then after all this opportunity the boy had see he become on Easy Street we' call him on a place where he he didn't have to worry about too much his parents had money he had he has very he become a ruler the Bible refers to it here the as a Young Rich Young Ruler and we see at a young age maybe in his teenage just out of school just out of graduation maybe a few weeks before something he become a he's a ruler and uh he had all it Hearts could desire and the boy wasn't no modern Ricky he's a fine kid I believe when Luke wrote about it or Mark I believe it was Jesus looked at him inside because he loved him there's something about the kid there was a nice personality hook with his kid where didd he come from out of a nice family who had taught him the Commandments of God and seen that he kept him and he did it from his youth up and the boy had an ambition he wanted eternal life he said a good Master what could I do to inherit eternal life see with all you got in the world yet the Soul on the inside of you tells you there's something that you need that you haven't got just by wealth or it always had to be wealth it could be popper some pretty girl she's got her beauty that she can think of maybe she's very popper in school maybe the boy can get any girl he wants he feels it he's kind of secured that's not security that'll fade just like like the flower in the field See it'll go won't be long just a few turns of sun that's gone then you got a soul that has to live eternally and this young kid must had a nice personality because he presented himself to the Lord Jesus name he bow upon his knee he said good Master what could I do to have eternal life he said why do you call me good said when you know there's only one good and that's God see what the young man Express in this that he was God see he said you thou knowest the Commandments keep them said say what Commandments Master he said the Commandments of honor the father and mother and so forth he said this I've done from youth up see I've did this he said yet you're liking one thing go sell what you have and distribute to the poor and follow me what an opportunity that could have been Peter James or John on the lamb see the kid have been trained and brought upright and and been presented to Christ to use him and all the potential that he had in him to use probably educated Young Rich influenced where he could have presented the gospel and yet turned it down what a what a rational thing that was for that young boy see follow me I see you had to follow someone now he had to either follow the influence of the people he's associated with the influence of some young lady the some influence of a gang of boys that he has associated with his colleagues in school or follow Jesus Christ and all of his goodness yet he knew he didn't have eternal life kids that's what you got to think about see now look at the boy tonight what he could have been and what he is what he is tonight he's somewhere he's a man he he's somewhere he's waiting a judgment he's waiting to face the Judgment at that day turning down the same opportunities presented to you kids almost under the same circumstance fine kids good personality fine fathers and mothers what you have don't even have to workless you want to see but there's something else that goes with that that's something goes with that that word tonight Never Dies it's still a challenge to every young man every young woman follow me see words don't die whenever you speak anything you just remember whether it's in your car in the secret whether it's in the pull pit whether it's down the street corner with your boyfriend or girlfriend wherever it is it never dies it's it's got to live forever and I seen that girl that I other night in the vision young pretty girl a Hollywood actress and I seen her dying reaching trying to get the help and she died in a heart attack Miss Monroe and then that's been two years ago and I seen her dying and 2 days later she did die and then the other night have heard that girl's voice how the kids have been telling me Daddy you go down that River no return all time said they got a play like that on tonight they told me a certain night it would be on a week or two ahead of time and I thought well I want to see that cuz I've been down that River two or three times about five times I think but I I went to see it and miss m Monro acted that out well that was the girl I saw in the vision and there she was in picture and the actions the very act that she made on the River of No Return would you took that picture perhaps 15 years ago there an old picture maybe 20 years ago and she's been dead two years and There She is again alive every action and every word see it's still so caught in Magnetic Tape until it's alive again not only that but everything that we say is alive every word that we speak cannot die coming through the room is words now forms of people television picks it up you can speak right here and then hear you around the world that same second even before you can hear it in this room it goes around the world by electronic and God's Great screen picks that up and never move and every act that you make you've got to meet it at the Judgment see so young fell it's a good thing to stop think about these things see because you going to meet it again let's trace this young man the opportunity he had and put yourself in his place and know girl this same as is Becky Maryland just like just the same as you stand in his place and you can hear that voice which is still alive it's still alive it's still moving science says in 20 years now they pi up his literal voice that he spoke 2,000 years ago it's still alive like a pebble Dr in the ocean the wave never ceases it goes to the shore thousands of miles and turns back when a voice is once spoke into the air like that it never dies there ain't nothing you can say the judgment is right there there will be the voice of Jesus Christ bidding that young man follow me and him turning away on the screen sorry because he had great possession see we might not be always has to be money it can be other things see anything we hold dear then we do that call see it becomes lack of money to us it becomes something that corrupts us now let's follow him a little bit what happens when he turns away he didn't listen to that voice of Christ he want with his friends which you kids you're all fine kids and you bound to have friends but watch what kind of friend you have if that friend's following Christ go with that friend follow Christ too but if it don't don't do it let's look at him we find out he perhaps kept his friends he become a great ruler he was a ruler then later we find him so prosperous until he he had to build extra barns to put his stuff in and then he said to himself after he got old and he cares of young life and things has P all he done maybe was entertain and when an old man or an old woman like me my wife your mothers and dad there isn't hardly anything that they can think of they can't don't want to get out and and run up and down the streets you know as young fellas would young women dates and who's going to be your wife or your husband or see they don't have that in their mind they they got children they're interested that's going to be you all tomorrow if there is a tomorrow and uh see the fellow then with maybe maybe he never even got married and however he was a great ruler and he set up on and as is in Jerusalem yet today they eat on the housetop this time of day when it gets cool out the evening and we find another character pictured with him a beggar and the man from being raised uh to honor the neighbor and do un others is have others to do unto you see by rejecting that call of Christ finally look like a boy been raised in a home like that that would never got away from him but it did it did and there laid a man at the gate by the name of Lazarus begging him for food and vainly he would have eat the crumbs that he swept off not even to the beggar but to the dogs and was full of sores but the man had been so Polished in society then he had no more feelings he become numb because he' rejected that offer of Christ and maybe one evening this time making his toast with Fine Wines and lovely women's jeweled around him and things like that with all his Hearts could desire and toasting a bler laying at the gate and before daylight dawned the next morning he was in Hell screaming for that Lazar to come put water on his tongue the Chang of the scene and you know Noti when he said Father Abraham now he still remembered that Abraham was the father of the Jews he said Father Abraham sand that beggar Lazarus down here's a little water on his fingers to put on my lips these Flames are tormenting and he said uh and Abraham said it's I can't do that in so many words and besides all this you see you had your opportunity in life when did he have it when Jesus said follow me but he turned it down he went the way that he could make money and that's all right nothing wrong with making money but follow Jesus while you're doing it see and he'd went the other way with a crowd and you find out he said Abraham said and besides all this there's a gulf fixed between you and he that no man has ever crossed over and never will them that are there cannot come here and these here cannot go there it's been fixed no man has Cross or will cross now listen to him he wants to be an evangelist then the call that Jesus had given him to to follow him had and to be a soul iner as a Young Man returned to him again he remembered it that he had five brothers and back on Earth and he didn't want man in that place he said send Lazarus then back to tell my brothers not to come this way in other words accept the call of follow me but he said they they won't do it he said yes if one would raise from the dead like Lazarus and go back and tell him you see it shows that after we die you're still conscious he remembered Abraham said Son remember in your days see you still remember you don't lose your memory you remember and the me memories that man could have and still in the same place remembered the opportunity he had of hearing Jesus say follow me but he followed the wrong person the wrong crowd he got in the wrong crowd and went to the wrong place end up in the wrong eternity be annihilated at that day from God forever Jesus also said a great striking word though one raised from the dead and go back yet they would not be persuaded because they've got Moses and the law and if they won't hear that then they won't hear though one would be raised from the dead they will not be persuaded why why do the law speak something like that yes do to others as you'd have them do unto you and he had lived under the law but he let the beggar die at the gate see he he had lived under the Commandments of God and yet failed to see that great eternal life kids each one seem like mine you each one seem like it's my sons and daughters in one way you are spiritually speaking that's right the Lord God has has put your souls into my care because you come listen to me you believe me and in one sense words you are my sons and daughters that's right and always remember keeping the Commandments of God is a great thing being raised in a good home is a Heritage from God and to be fine kids with personalities as you have good wonderful to have an education it's wonderful to even live in this free land we got a many things to be thankful for but there's one thing that you just don't inherit you've got to accept it that's eternal life and you only do that by following following Jesus by a born again experience don't neglect that a little story one time I heard of a man who was all he was poor and he he always wanted to it's a little fairy story like always stuck with me though and one day he picked a flower and the flower was magic and the flower answered to him and said you've been poor all your life he said now um ask what you will and it'll be given to you he said that yonder's mountain would open up and I could go there in and find the gold in the mountain well the he said you'll have to take me with you wherever you go see you'll have to take me with you so wherever I am then you can ask what you will he walked to the mountain and the mountain opened up and he went in the shells was full of gold and diamonds as the little fairy story goes he laid the flower down on a on a table or a rock and he run and grabbed a great big Gem and he um said I must go show this to my friends and now I'm a rich man I have everything now I must show this and so the flower spoke but said you have forgot the main thing so he runs back and picks up said well uh maybe I'll I'll get a piece of gold I get a piece of silver and so he said uh I'll uh I'll hurry out to tell the people how rich I am what all I've got and he got to the door and the flower said but you forgot the main thing so he runs back again he said in here we find all kinds of materials so he picked up a stone he he said I'll go take this Stone and show the people what kind of a stone this Mountain's made out of so I can find my way back to it see and he started out the door and the flower said for the it's final time you have forgot the main thing oh he said oh shut up see he didn't want to hear it anymore forgot the main thing and he ran out the door and when he did the door closed behind him with the flower on the inside the main thing was the flower see the main thing was the flower years ago as a kid as you all are here cattle ranch above here above Phoenix I was reading a piece of prospect a paper about a prospector then there was no rades through here then this little sand path they still do a lot of prospecting in here you know but this prospector had come in and he found a lot of money and he struck a lot of gold and on his rode in he stayed in a cabin he' found and he had a dog with him and uh the dog tied up on the outside and that night had been an out fony to get this gold he picked it up from the old Spanish mindes and he was um coming in with it and uh the dog started barking and the man didn't want to be bothered with that dog he said uh shut up he said tomorrow I'll take this into to to the city and morals the story was this and I'll have it uh weighed up and I'll be a rich man and I'll buy great cars and I'll have all kinds of women and big parties and I'll be a rich man because I've already struck the claim I've got the gold here much of it and said ah and while he was trying to go to sleep the dog kept barking because the dog seen the outlaw coming up spping up waiting for the prospector to go to sleep he raised up again and screamed at the dog again said shut up the poor dog whin and tried to warn his master the danger was aler lurking and when he the next time when the dog started barking the prospector had a shotgun he didn't want to be bothered so he just raised up and shot the dog and the prospector was killed that night by the outlaw all his fancy dreams done him no good why he still the voice that was warning him there's nobody can try to do anything your kids would never be able to do anything wrong after being raised the way you are unless you feel something tell you not to do it I don't never steal that voice that's warning you and always remember accept that voice that said follow me and you'll always come out right I believe you will I got confidence in you but just always remember at Jesus that voice is alive in the Earth tonight just the same as every voice and every word we spoke is still alive when that voice goes out on that ether wave of the air the see you got a transmitter here that sends it out you are the transmitter that sends it out now it takes a station to pick it up and Jesus was a transmitter of God's word for he was the the triun of God manifested in one man he was complete God and complete man and the Trinity of God the Trinity of the attributes of God as being Father Son and Holy Spirit was represented in that one man Jesus Christ so there he was the word and he was the transmitter that said he that heareth my word words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life see verely I say unto you he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life now that words went out from a transmitter he said one day verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said now if you can just be the station to pick that up by the some control inside of you by faith it'll move you right into the cycle of God to the new birth and be born again then you'll always be in contact to hear that voice that'll always warn you when dangers along when things are wrong going wrong it'll always be a warning to you and then instead of someday being like that rich young boy that we're speaking of be a man like Apostle Peter Paul or somebody that one souls for Jesus Jesus Christ you do that kids can we pray Lord Jesus youth men and women for tomorrow if there is a tomorrow we must train them Lord we feel that burden to train them like there will be a tomorrow if there is not then today is the day and then father we know that no one is accepted in your sight no flesh can Glory no education although as good as these things may be no good works no religious institution no psychology no nothing can confirm God but the Holy Spirit he's the instrument God himself in a form of eternal life that can come to us as an individual we're thankful for this truly is expressed when Peter made the confession Jesus said to him flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you never learned it in a seminary you never learned it in some school it's a personal thing something that each individual has to receive you said up on this rock I build my church and the Gates of Hell will not be able to overcome it we're thankful for that Lord that voice is still alive tonight and there are still post outposts listening posts receiving stations of faith that can accept it we pray that each one of these children will receive that Lord in their hearts and remember that not what they do to be good but they God does not judge us but what we do but by what we have accepted we are saved by our faith and not in our works so we pray heavenly father that they'll catch the vision now and see and hear that great uh Eternal uh invitation of come follow me May each one of them Lord turn aside from all the things of the world this Mortal fringy life as they he tonight in their golden blonde hair and some of them with their black hair and dark eyes and blue eyes and setting in their very best of that they'll ever be and as a great writer said remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nigh then Thou shalt have no pleasure in them how Lord Jesus you said to Peter when you were young you got up and went where you wanted to but when you get old someone packs you where you would not go let them remember now is the day this is the time granted father I claim every one of them for my own child here tonight to every child in here I feel that you've put in my hand to watch them I claim them all from Satan and from Death to life in Jesus Christ amen bless you kitties really nice say a few words to you and I'll get back along really fine kid appreciate you bless praise the Lord let's all stand amen many
