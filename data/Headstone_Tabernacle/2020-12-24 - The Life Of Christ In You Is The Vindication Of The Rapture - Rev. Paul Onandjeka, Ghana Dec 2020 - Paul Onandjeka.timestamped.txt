[31:34] pastor solomon god bless you for
[31:38] the opportunity to
[31:42] ask me to greet the brother jesus christ
[31:46] in your local area and also for the
[31:55] the convention that you have
[32:00] it's an honor i want to thank you for
[32:01] your heart and what you do for god's
[32:03] people
[32:04] uh because you said that the theme is
[32:07] centered around
[32:08] the manifestation of the sons of god
[32:12] i want to read romans chapter 8 and from
[32:15] verses
[32:16] 14 to 23
[32:19] and just to greet you all in jesus name
[32:23] as various are led by the spirit of god
[32:27] they are the sons of god for you have
[32:30] not received the spirit of bondage again
[32:33] to fear
[32:34] but you have received the spirit of
[32:36] adoption
[32:38] whereby we cry over
[32:42] the spirit itself beareth witness
[32:45] with our spirit that we are the children
[32:47] of god
[32:48] in children then as as of god and joint
[32:52] as the christ
[32:53] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[32:56] may be also glorified
[32:58] together for i report that the
[33:02] sufferings of this present time
[33:04] are not worthy to be compared with the
[33:07] glory which shall
[33:08] be revealed in us for the earnest
[33:12] exploitation of the creature waited for
[33:15] the manifestation
[33:17] of the sons of god for the creature
[33:21] was made subject to vanity not willingly
[33:24] but by reason of him was subject to
[33:27] saving hope
[33:28] because the creature itself also shall
[33:31] be delivered from the bondage of
[33:33] corruption
[33:34] into the glorious liberty of the
[33:36] children of god
[33:38] for we know that the whole creation
[33:40] growth
[33:41] and travail in pain together until now
[33:45] and not only they but ourselves also
[33:48] which are the first fruit of the spirit
[33:50] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[33:53] waiting for the adoption to witness the
[33:56] redemption
[33:57] of our bodies god bless you all
[34:01] um just uh send ingredients to you from
[34:03] canada
[34:04] uh
[34:09] the lord bless you all church and the
[34:11] topic your
[34:13] your pastor was selected is looking for
[34:15] the manifestation of the sons of god
[34:18] when god stands will will be revealed
[34:21] will be manifested
[34:22] and they will be in position to enter to
[34:25] be in charge
[34:26] now the scripture is here that as many
[34:28] as are led
[34:30] by the spirit of god they are the sons
[34:32] of god we need god's leadership
[34:34] and that leadership can only come when
[34:36] we have accepted the holy spirit
[34:39] when the power of god comes into our
[34:41] lives
[34:42] it does something either with us not
[34:45] only that
[34:46] it said that we have also received the
[34:48] spirit
[34:49] of bondage to fear
[34:53] fear brings doubt
[34:56] when fear is gone it brings faith
[34:59] and in the absence of fear we need faith
[35:02] in our lives that the word of god will
[35:05] be able to be received
[35:06] it also speaks that we have also
[35:09] received the spirit of
[35:11] adoption whether we cry our father
[35:14] and so this is where we are now
[35:18] we are not only cells of god but we are
[35:20] adopted sons of god amen
[35:22] what does it mean it means that
[35:25] not every son that is born
[35:29] has a right for inheritance you got to
[35:32] end that
[35:34] and god places two tests
[35:38] with that child a paul speaks english is
[35:41] for
[35:42] about a child going through two days
[35:45] and god has sent us a message of
[35:48] child training in a child figure out
[35:52] that daily cause is in the family
[35:54] he can do whatever he wants he'll be
[35:56] seeing everything
[35:57] but to be adopted means this it doesn't
[36:00] mean that god
[36:01] has to look for somebody who's not his
[36:04] child
[36:05] and bring him into the kingdom and that
[36:06] don't pass his child that's no good the
[36:08] way adoption works
[36:09] if god's kingdom in god's kingdom would
[36:11] be their
[36:12] very son that is born in the family
[36:16] had been adopted by his own dad amen
[36:19] therefore
[36:20] god puts those children
[36:24] under the hands of truth and that
[36:27] teacher
[36:28] is a resolve between the father
[36:31] and the son the father is asking for
[36:33] reports
[36:34] the progress of how the boy is behaving
[36:37] how he's doing
[36:38] why because someday he is going to leave
[36:42] all his inheritance into that child for
[36:44] him to manage his properties
[36:46] and if the boy is going to take it and
[36:48] squander the whole thing is nothing to
[36:49] rule
[36:51] and so for us to be manifested at the
[36:55] sons of god
[36:56] we gotta pass the test of adoption
[36:59] god has to trust us
[37:02] he has to believe that the world cannot
[37:05] do what they are doing now
[37:07] we us as children should be able to do
[37:10] what they cannot do
[37:11] they are liars their teeth they don't
[37:13] feel the truth they they satisfied one
[37:15] another
[37:16] we can be in the same world our spirit
[37:19] is not a spirit of the world
[37:21] and so i am beating you all in the name
[37:24] of the lord jesus christ
[37:26] that we need to come into adoption
[37:30] it means then that we have been trained
[37:34] properly our characters have been molded
[37:38] we have received the message and it has
[37:41] done
[37:41] something within us and that what it has
[37:45] done
[37:45] we are seeing an effect of what the
[37:47] world is going through
[37:50] the politicians can't keep the world
[37:52] they are trying their best but they
[37:54] can't keep it
[37:55] look whatever they are doing to make
[37:57] this work
[37:59] has side effects is that they give you a
[38:01] medicine to heal you from something it
[38:03] has side effect on the other side
[38:05] if you take it too long you develop
[38:07] something else they gotta give you
[38:09] something else to go on
[38:10] and that's what they're doing they're
[38:11] changing from one thing to the next
[38:13] hoping that this will work and this will
[38:14] not work but someday and it does cost
[38:17] their own earth to grow
[38:21] things are out of shape nature is
[38:25] blowing
[38:26] we are receiving all kinds of hurricanes
[38:28] and drugs
[38:29] and and shortages of
[38:33] life upon the face of the earth all
[38:35] because
[38:36] the ecosystem is changing
[38:40] a man is part of that because god says
[38:42] that he will destroy them who corrupt
[38:44] the earth
[38:46] and they are all waiting for the
[38:48] glorious liberty
[38:50] of the sons of god they want adam to
[38:52] come back and run again
[38:54] because when adam was ruling them it was
[38:56] at peace

[58:12] his spirit is united with us
[58:16] our physical eyes cannot see him
[58:19] because they are still physical

[58:26] so that we can see the vision but he's
[58:30] here
[58:32] as a principal as real
[58:36] that he was in the day when he spoke to

[58:53] cannot see him the holy spirit
[58:57] is in a dimension that your physical
[59:01] eyes

[59:08] always used to say
[59:11] no church no group
[59:14] [Music]
[59:16] can contain the holy spirit
[59:19] and say we we are the ones the holy

[1:02:14] with the holy spirit and the holy spirit
[1:02:22] it is a direct fellowship with your
[1:02:25] creator
[1:02:27] no group can say
[1:02:33] we are the only one keeping the holy
[1:02:35] spirit
[1:02:37] it means that you don't understand you
[1:02:40] cannot
[1:02:41] bound god you cannot
[1:02:44] say no god the holy spirit
[1:02:49] is in a dimension and when your soul
[1:02:54] is in this very dimension and then you
[1:02:57] have fellowship with your father
[1:02:59] and this is the communion that adam had
[1:03:04] this is the communion that the apostles
[1:03:08] have
[1:03:09] come this is the communion
[1:03:12] for which god sent malachi foreign

[1:03:28] as in the time as in the days where
[1:03:32] he was at the grave of lazarus you
[1:03:35] cannot see him
[1:03:36] but he is present in a dimension
[1:03:40] and if your soul is caged you know that
[1:03:42] is hearing

[1:04:36] as sure that there is a heaven and hell
[1:04:41] jesus christ is present at this very
[1:04:44] moment
[1:04:46] but the problem is in an invisible
[1:04:48] dimension
[1:04:50] we cannot see him
[1:04:53] but there is something in the soul of
[1:04:55] the christians
[1:04:57] that make it that make him
[1:05:00] to be aware when this process
[1:05:04] is done
