[18:51] ezekiel nine reading from verses one

[18:58] cause
[18:59] them that have charged over the city to
[19:00] draw near even every man with his
[19:03] destroying weapon in his hand
[19:05] and behold six men came from the way of
[19:07] the higher gate
[19:08] which lied towards the north and every
[19:11] man slaughter weapon in his hand
[19:13] and one man among them was clothed with
[19:15] linen with an ink on right
[19:16] uh writer's ink on by his side and they
[19:19] went in and stood beside the brace and
[19:20] altar
[19:21] and the glory of the lord of the god of
[19:23] israel was
[19:24] gone up from the chair where upon he was

[33:59] picture to abraham
[34:02] he just told him that his people would
[34:04] sojune in a strange land
[34:06] and then he told him with a mighty hand
[34:08] he bring them out he didn't tell them
[34:10] how long it would take he didn't tell
[34:14] him how bad it would be
[34:15] he just told him i overview
[34:18] gave him a kind of skeletal frame of
[34:20] what was supposed to happen
[34:23] oh hallelujah but the details were
[34:25] stretched out through the process of
[34:26] time
[34:28] isn't that right abraham we got isaac
[34:31] isaac we got jacob
[34:32] jacob he got joseph and so it went on
[34:35] until joseph ended up in egypt
[34:37] and then the whole scene played out and
[34:40] then the children of israel ended up in
[34:42] egypt
[34:42] and then they raised up a pharaoh that
[34:44] knew not joseph
[34:46] oh hallelujah things seem to be all
[34:49] right
[34:50] until they raise up a pharaoh that knew
[34:52] not joseph
[34:54] oh hallelujah hallelujah you rose up
[34:56] somebody that didn't know this god
[34:58] that didn't know the court of miracles

[36:26] amen praise god hallelujah amen oh do
[36:29] you love him this morning
[36:30] praise god okay he said it didn't said
[36:34] a thunder head of fire now he said it
[36:36] was a pillar of fire
[36:38] and where it stopped they stopped and
[36:41] then priests watched it
[36:43] and whenever it moved they sounded the
[36:45] trumpets
[36:46] if it was midnight three o'clock in the
[36:48] morning 12 o'clock noon
[36:50] you see they all packed and went packed
[36:52] and away they went
[36:54] they uh followed the pill of fire
[36:57] they kept in the will of the lord by
[36:59] doing so
[37:00] oh how beautiful he said if they ever
[37:03] lost that pill
[37:04] of fire in the new testament he said uh
[37:07] i mean in our age he said through 1500
[37:09] years of dark ages he said they failed
[37:11] to see it
[37:12] but there was a fellow one day by the
[37:14] name of martin luther
[37:16] and he saw the pillar fire and away he
[37:19] went on the first reformation
[37:21] you see you have to follow this pill of
[37:23] fire wherever it's leading you've got to
[37:25] go
[37:26] praise god we are in the army of the
[37:27] lord this morning and if they wake us up
[37:29] at all 500 hours we've got to move
[37:32] we've got to run and if we don't run we
[37:34] get left behind
[37:35] praise god isn't that right so keep on
[37:37] running this morning
[37:38] we're running away from the world and
[37:40] we're running into christ
[37:42] we are running away from the lld earth
[37:44] and running into rapture
[37:46] into glory priests connie man isn't that
[37:48] right
[37:49] so here he talks about martin luther
[37:51] says he saw the pill of fire
[37:53] and the way he went on the first
[37:54] reformation he said but you know what
[37:57] he organized his church so tight it
[38:00] began to be it was only the lutheran
[38:02] church
[38:02] he was either lutheran or he wasn't it
[38:04] and the pill of fire won't hang over
[38:06] nothing like that
[38:08] oh so you mean there's no it group
[38:14] we are it you are not it the pillar fire
[38:17] by bernab said won't hang over that
[38:20] he don't want no association with that
[38:22] you are not it
[38:23] the pillar fires it if you follow the
[38:26] pill of fire
[38:27] you'll be all right if you are it then
[38:29] you stay with your it
[38:31] but it may not make into the rapture it
[38:33] may not make it into the wedding supper
[38:35] but if you call it a fill of fire oh he
[38:38] will lead you out
[38:39] and out of this pilgrim land hey
[38:43] many many men hallelujah
[38:46] praise god in many man or something huh
[38:50] amen
[38:51] said if he wasn't it see pillow fire
[38:53] wouldn't hang over nothing like that
[38:55] so a wade went and luther couldn't
[38:57] follow it because he
[38:58] uh luther had been uh dead for years and
[39:01] another round of servants of apostles of
[39:03] church and another round another round
[39:05] and just got weakened
[39:06] just like your disciples okay and then
[39:08] the pillar fire moved away from the
[39:09] luton church
[39:10] luther couldn't go because he had all of
[39:12] his rituals and everything wrote up
[39:14] and then there was a little fellow by
[39:15] name of john wesley in england
[39:17] and he saw it and away he went and he
[39:20] had a revival
[39:21] that saved england us in the united
[39:24] states and
[39:24] an english known world in that day isn't
[39:26] that right praise god honey another
[39:28] great revival but then the first thing
[39:30] you know
[39:30] they got so organized down till they
[39:32] begin to get after a few rounds just
[39:34] cold starchy as they could be
[39:35] that's right the pillow fire won't hang
[39:37] over that so a way it went
[39:39] and a bunch of people called pentecostal
[39:41] seen it and away they went after it
[39:43] it is receiving the holy ghost and then
[39:46] they
[39:47] built them a church order but you know
[39:48] the sad part the pentecost is so
[39:50] organized that the pillar fire move out
[39:52] again
[39:53] and they can't go that's right the
[39:54] pillow fire is moving
[39:56] anyhow oh isn't that right
[39:59] god said it would that's right they had
[40:01] the sign of the fire by night and cloud
[40:03] by day that led them
[40:04] he said now tonight here in god's house
[40:07] where that same pillar of fire harlan is

[40:19] lives forever more
[40:20] he promised the things that he did we
[40:23] would do also
[40:24] isn't that right and greater for he went

[40:40] with the original seed to water the seed

[40:44] to bring forth another revival to bring
[40:47] forth a manifestation
[40:48] of what the prophets prophesy hallelujah
[40:52] isn't that right
[40:53] praise god amen isn't that right
[40:56] hallelujah isn't that right
[40:58] said okay now it is there today that
[40:59] same pill of fires here
[41:01] because it was the angel of the covenant
[41:02] the lord jesus christ when he died he
[41:05] rose again
[41:06] and he lives forever more he promises
[41:08] the things that he did
[41:09] amen um that we will do also and greater
[41:13] for he went unto the father he said is
[41:14] that right amen any man amen hallelujah

[43:43] about jesus and they started talk
[43:46] something about
[43:46] jesus and decided to do some things and

[43:50] could have argued a point he could have
[43:52] made his point valid he could have came
[43:54] and
[43:54] made a whole scene of it but he chose to
[43:56] move away the bible said

[45:43] they weren't very much in relations amen
[45:45] is not right
[45:46] and even more than that this woman was
[45:48] living a contrary life
[45:50] isn't that right so her situation seemed
[45:53] very bleak
[45:54] and nobody wants to talk to her and
[45:56] nobody wants to fellowship with her
[45:57] but there was somebody who wanted to
[45:59] speak to her more than anyone else
[46:02] because this person knew who she was the
[46:05] world
[46:05] thought they had an interpretation of
[46:07] who this woman was
[46:10] you see the devil cannot really tell you
[46:12] who you are
[46:14] even the devil didn't know who jesus was
[46:16] he said if thou be
[46:18] if thou be the son of god do this and do
[46:20] that
[46:21] but jesus gave him the word it is
[46:23] written
[46:24] it is written and it is also written
[46:27] that was his identification oh
[46:30] hallelujah so the devil
[46:31] can't tell you who you are you can't go
[46:34] ask the devil who i am no
[46:36] but there's somebody who knows or a
[46:39] world to
[46:41] oh count hallelujah hallelujah

[46:47] i'll ask her for a drink of water
[46:49] isn't that right oh holla she could
[46:50] begin to hunt a spirit
[46:52] she had a question she said when the
[46:54] messiah comes
[46:55] they say that he will do these things
[46:57] these earned hearts and whatnot he said
[46:59] woman

[54:28] to our first created image amen isn't
[54:31] that right
[54:32] babana speaking i love this part he said
[54:35] when god created me
[54:36] william branham he said i was before the
[54:39] foundational world
[54:41] he made my being my spirit he said i
[54:44] wasn't conscious
[54:45] of anything as far as i know of but he
[54:47] said i was there
[54:49] and he said he said oh i don't believe
[54:50] you're getting it oh
[54:52] he said but now just wait a minute he
[54:54] said jesus told the disciples
[54:56] that he knew them before the foundation
[54:58] of the world
[54:59] isn't that right hallelujah when you
[55:02] wanted a fig tree
[55:03] hallelujah amen isn't that right philip
[55:05] i called you i done already hallelujah
[55:07] praise god seeing you amen in the book
[55:09] isn't that right jesus said and said
[55:12] paul said there
[55:13] that he chose us in him before the world
[55:15] began
[55:17] isn't that right he said and i was some
[55:19] part of me
[55:20] all my never and the rest of you all
[55:21] here that is in
[55:23] jesus christ before the world ever began
[55:27] he said and here's to my analysis of
[55:29] that
[55:30] he said he said and i think that people
[55:32] that the people today are possessed with
[55:33] this spirit
[55:35] or the spirit a part of these angelic
[55:38] beings
[55:39] which are spirits okay let me read that
[55:41] back again
[55:43] i don't want you to miss it he said and
[55:45] here's to my analysis of that
[55:46] he said i think that the people today
[55:49] that are possessed with this spirit amen
[55:53] or or these spirit a part of these
[55:57] angelic beings spirits which rotated off
[56:01] of god
[56:04] do you know who you are now you are not
[56:06] just anybody
[56:07] but you are angelic being a spirit that
[56:10] rotated off of car
[56:12] that's why when you heard the message
[56:14] something inside of you connect
[56:16] something inside of you connect you
[56:19] can't help but say amen
[56:21] because your spirit bear witness with
[56:23] that spirit
[56:24] that you are the son of god praise god
[56:27] hallelujah hallelujah oh
[56:30] holy what can separate us from the love
[56:33] of god
[56:34] that is in christ jesus he said i am my
[56:36] father and one
[56:38] at that day you shall know i am in the
[56:40] father
[56:41] he and me and i and you and you and me
[56:45] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[56:48] oh hallelujah that's why
[56:52] we could have faith for the holy ghost
[56:53] because if we look at ourselves
[56:55] we can never have faith we have too much
[56:57] fallings we have too much shortcomings
[56:59] we made so much mistakes
[57:01] we've done so much sin and we feel like
[57:03] we can't talk to god
[57:04] but if ever you get back connected to
[57:07] your real father
[57:08] i'm not talking about your earthly
[57:10] connections no no no i'm talking about
[57:12] your spirit
[57:13] that rotated off of elohim from before
[57:16] the beginning
[57:17] that same spirit that drew his sword and
[57:20] fought with the dragon that same spirit
[57:24] that kicked lucifer out of heaven when
[57:27] you connect
[57:28] back to that same spirit then you could
[57:30] call for fire in your life
[57:32] because that fire belongs to you
[57:36] that's your fire that's my fire that's
[57:40] our inheritance
[57:41] that belongs to us the holy ghost
[57:44] belongs to us this morning

[1:01:41] that's daniel 12. and i always talked
[1:01:43] about that scripture
[1:01:44] that it'd be a great time of trouble
[1:01:46] such as never was since there was a
[1:01:48] nation
[1:01:49] even to that same time but the bible
[1:01:51] says at that time
[1:01:52] when things get messed up at that time
[1:01:55] when it seems like there's no hope for
[1:01:56] the world
[1:01:57] when it seems like satan's got
[1:01:59] everything covered under his thumb
[1:02:01] when he's got everything under his power
[1:02:03] under his control
[1:02:05] when it seemed like the devil is sitting
[1:02:06] pretty at that time
[1:02:08] is when michael shall stand up listen
[1:02:12] the word stand doesn't just mean
[1:02:15] physically stand
[1:02:16] i'm not talking about physically
[1:02:18] standing up but that word stan
[1:02:20] means to take up a position that word
[1:02:23] stand
[1:02:24] means to take up an authority on the
[1:02:26] matter
[1:02:27] that word stand
[1:02:28] [Applause]
[1:02:31] glory to god hallelujah oh standing for
[1:02:35] having done all to stand this morning
[1:02:38] glory to god hallelujah
[1:02:40] [Applause]
[1:02:44] oh you catch what i'm saying this
[1:02:47] morning
[1:02:48] so in the beginning when we were
[1:02:50] fighting with biker
[1:02:52] michael recognized that we took our
[1:02:54] stand
[1:02:55] with him we took up our position in the
[1:02:58] matter
[1:02:59] we resisted the devil's lie we resisted
[1:03:02] the devil's confusion
[1:03:03] we resisted the devil's interpretation
[1:03:06] we took the word
[1:03:07] and we fought the devil out and michael
[1:03:10] recognized your stance
[1:03:11] and michael is here this morning to
[1:03:14] stand for you
[1:03:15] you're all confused i don't know if i
[1:03:17] get the holy ghost
[1:03:19] but michael is here to stand for you
[1:03:22] you stood at me i'll stand for you
[1:03:24] praise god
[1:03:26] stand still and see the salvation of our
[1:03:29] god
[1:03:30] [Applause]
[1:03:56] we got the victory this morning oh the
[1:03:59] devil thought he had us
[1:04:00] oh the devil don't have us we got the
[1:04:03] devil
[1:04:03] because when we get to realize who we
[1:04:06] are
[1:04:07] who god is and who the devil is brother
[1:04:09] the rapture could go at any minute oh
[1:04:12] hallelujah
[1:04:13] because you recognize your position in
[1:04:15] christ
[1:04:18] isn't that right you are in heavenly
[1:04:21] places
[1:04:22] and brother branham said heavenly places
[1:04:24] is the position in christ
[1:04:27] and when you find your position then god
[1:04:30] could speak to you
[1:04:31] he told abraham to come out i'll show
[1:04:34] you a place
[1:04:35] i'll show you a city i'll show you a
[1:04:37] land
[1:04:38] abram began to walk but lot was written
[1:04:41] it's only when he separated from lot

[1:06:41] the tent
[1:06:42] and there's syria in the back
[1:06:46] and she's doing her thing and part
[1:06:48] ventures she's hearing them
[1:06:49] she's eavesdropping isn't that right and
[1:06:52] the holy spirit
[1:06:53] amen to this man rather speaks to
[1:06:56] abraham and says
[1:06:57] surely say we'll have this son and sarah

[1:07:08] there's a loud laugh
[1:07:09] everybody knows a loud laugh you're
[1:07:11] happy excited

[1:07:17] this was a hidden laugh not even abraham
[1:07:19] heard this laugh
[1:07:20] he was talking to the man in the tent
[1:07:22] and she laughed within herself
[1:07:25] her siblings didn't hear it the people
[1:07:27] around didn't hear it
[1:07:29] this was her silent interpretation of
[1:07:31] what that man was saying
[1:07:34] and while she laughed the holy spirit
[1:07:37] picked it up
[1:07:38] and a man spoke and said why therefore
[1:07:40] did sarah laugh
[1:07:44] and i could believe at that moment her
[1:07:45] eyes popped open she was surprised
[1:07:47] she didn't think that anyone had heard
[1:07:49] her
[1:07:53] she ran outside she said no no no it
[1:07:56] wasn't me she tried to deny it
[1:07:58] but god said i know that you left i
[1:08:01] heard it when you laughed praise god
[1:08:03] isn't that right
[1:08:04] the bible talks about a father which

[1:08:35] but god had a different plan god have a
[1:08:38] different thing
[1:08:39] and it didn't matter how much unbelief
[1:08:42] sarah had in her heart
[1:08:44] god said that he would bring through
[1:08:46] sarah
[1:08:47] the promise of isaac and through you
[1:08:51] god will fulfill all i was promised
[1:08:54] you are the one that god has been
[1:08:56] looking for
[1:08:58] all this time you might doubt yourself
[1:09:01] but don't you worry god is able to do
[1:09:04] exceedingly
[1:09:05] abundantly above all you could ask
[1:09:09] oh hallelujah

[1:09:34] men
[1:09:35] and his sages prophets and asked them to
[1:09:38] reveal to him the dream
[1:09:39] and they can't do it and he gets
[1:09:41] frustrated
[1:09:42] and he goes to daniel and tanya says go

[1:10:31] and entertained her mind
[1:10:33] isn't that right he slipped down in

[1:10:37] adam's back was turned and
[1:10:39] didn't know what was going on the devil
[1:10:41] was slipping into the picture
[1:10:43] when god came back to the garden of eden

[1:10:48] he found a big corruption that was there
[1:10:50] in so much that he cried out adam adam

[1:20:28] another and so forth and fighting around

[1:20:51] but
[1:20:52] the holy spirit took ezekiel up into
[1:20:54] another realm
[1:20:55] into our vision realm it was between
[1:20:58] heaven and earth
[1:20:58] can say where he could see all that god
[1:21:01] was seeing
[1:21:02] and god took him up into a place and
[1:21:04] showed him a hole
[1:21:05] and told ezekiel dig the hole and he
[1:21:07] will see a door
[1:21:08] and when he saw the door but the god
[1:21:10] told ezekiel open the door
[1:21:12] and he will see all the abominations and
[1:21:14] i begin to think to myself look
[1:21:16] at what god had to do to show ezekiel
[1:21:19] all the hidden things that were being
[1:21:21] done in the city
[1:21:23] god had to take him to a hole take him
[1:21:25] through a door
[1:21:26] to see things that god had already seen
[1:21:29] amen isn't that right so people coming
[1:21:31] to church and hiding
[1:21:33] but they don't know that god has already
[1:21:34] seen you god is seeing what you are
[1:21:37] doing praise god
[1:21:39] he's seeing your attitude he's seeing
[1:21:41] what approach you have into the gospel
[1:21:43] he's seeing how you're praying he's
[1:21:45] seeing if you are searching for god
[1:21:47] he is seeing if you are really genuine
[1:21:50] about this gospel that we are preaching
[1:21:52] he wants to know what is in your heart
[1:21:54] he wants to know that you are making
[1:21:56] things right
[1:21:57] that you are doing all that you could do
[1:21:59] to be ready when he comes
[1:22:01] isn't that right he said i come quickly
[1:22:04] and my reward is with me to do what
[1:22:06] to give every man as his work shall
[1:22:09] be isn't that right oh
[1:22:12] hallelujah hallelujah so you'll be
[1:22:15] rewarded according to your work isn't
[1:22:16] that right
[1:22:17] okay hey man i'm gonna write the wrongs
[1:22:19] up said now when i was here the other
[1:22:21] time
[1:22:21] i tried to tell you um god's confirming
[1:22:25] the word with signs one doesn't miracles
[1:22:26] and so forth
[1:22:27] okay i'll skip back marquee you know he
[1:22:29] said
[1:22:30] he said now look at the age we're living
[1:22:31] in you know he said now to my opinion
[1:22:33] this is the age of the turning time
[1:22:37] it's a time when men are either will
[1:22:39] come into the kingdom of god
[1:22:41] or be sealed out of the kingdom of god
[1:22:44] he said and i believe that the
[1:22:45] antichrist
[1:22:46] seals a person he said we're taught in
[1:22:48] the scriptures in the book of revelation
[1:22:50] if any man receives his seal or his mark
[1:22:53] or the letter of his name
[1:22:54] and so forth is doomed is sealed out of
[1:22:57] the kingdom of god
[1:22:59] and the spirit of christ come on now
[1:23:01] when once
[1:23:02] sealed with that you are sealed into
[1:23:05] the kingdom of god oh
[1:23:08] that's what i want this morning not to
[1:23:10] be sealed out
[1:23:11] but to be sealed in to the kingdom of
[1:23:14] god
[1:23:16] hallelujah isn't that right when noah
[1:23:19] and all of his family went into the ark
[1:23:21] the door was shut
[1:23:22] at the shutting of the door they were
[1:23:24] sealed in the world and everything else
[1:23:26] outside was sealed out
[1:23:28] the animals were in everything were
[1:23:30] packed in and ready there was no more
[1:23:32] names to be called that was it judgment
[1:23:34] was set

[1:23:38] and all who was out is out
[1:23:39] isn't that right what does that mean
[1:23:41] filthy filthy still
[1:23:43] holy holy still there is coming that
[1:23:45] time friends
[1:23:46] where the tide will turn over to the
[1:23:48] jews and where there were no more blood

[1:23:54] morning
[1:23:55] that you are sealed in oh honey make
[1:23:58] sure that you are sealed into the
[1:23:59] kingdom of god

[1:24:06] are applying this token
[1:24:07] that you are living praise god this life
[1:24:09] of jesus christ

[1:24:20] hallelujah but it's been being real with
[1:24:22] god honey being real since saying your
[1:24:24] heart
[1:24:25] one time one a man came up to brother
[1:24:27] branham and he said brother branham they
[1:24:29] told me to come and talk to you but
[1:24:30] rather said what's what's wrong
[1:24:32] so the man said well i wanted to receive
[1:24:34] christ in my heart
[1:24:35] he said and i used to go to church with
[1:24:36] my wife and so on and he said but i
[1:24:39] wanted to receive god in my heart and i
[1:24:41] didn't know how
[1:24:42] he said and i saw a piece of paper
[1:24:44] written somewhere about
[1:24:45] uh where will you spend eternity and he
[1:24:47] said right there the man
[1:24:48] he got a conviction and he decided he
[1:24:50] wanted to serve the lord
[1:24:52] and he said he was wealthy he had money
[1:24:54] he said he started to sell out his
[1:24:55] business and his cars and
[1:24:57] he just wanted to know god's will for
[1:24:59] his life and he said he went to
[1:25:00] bethlehem's church
[1:25:01] and the methodist church told him do
[1:25:03] this thing and he'll be all right
[1:25:05] and he did it but he wasn't satisfied he
[1:25:07] went to the baptist church he went to
[1:25:08] this church he went to that church
[1:25:10] and he still wasn't satisfied and the
[1:25:12] brother of the brother said i come to
[1:25:13] you but about him because i don't have
[1:25:14] an answer
[1:25:15] i want to find christ and brother
[1:25:18] branham said listen
[1:25:19] let's go back to the story let's go back
[1:25:21] to the beginning of this story
[1:25:23] he said what made you want to serve god
[1:25:25] he said well i looked at a piece of
[1:25:26] paper he said that was it
[1:25:28] he said right there something in your
[1:25:30] heart began to ask a question
[1:25:32] and right there you started searching
[1:25:34] for god he said it doesn't matter what
[1:25:36] church you go to
[1:25:37] it doesn't matter how much you jump
[1:25:39] doesn't matter how much you shout
[1:25:41] please go but it's the life it's it's a
[1:25:43] praise god it's that thing in your heart
[1:25:46] that's crying out for a reality he said
[1:25:48] that's the thing
[1:25:49] that is connecting to god not the tides
[1:25:52] you pay come on now
[1:25:54] that's fine that's all right all that is
[1:25:56] church order
[1:25:57] hallelujah but more than that there's a
[1:25:59] deeper desire within
[1:26:01] to want to know god to want to be with
[1:26:04] god
[1:26:05] to want to have that seal that mark of
[1:26:07] the holy ghost
[1:26:09] in your life to want to have that
[1:26:11] witness of his spirit
[1:26:12] oh halal where he go you go where he
[1:26:15] lead you
[1:26:16] follow that's what we want this morning
[1:26:18] enoch walked with god and was not
[1:26:21] but god took him and he had a testimony
[1:26:24] that he pleased core not his mother
[1:26:28] not his father but it was about god what
[1:26:30] he was doing
[1:26:31] for the kingdom isn't that right oh my
[1:26:34] my
[1:26:35] hallelujah amen praise god
[1:26:38] he said now if you come tonight uh this

[1:26:48] tonight and said i had the spirit of a
[1:26:49] criminal
[1:26:50] john dillinger and john jillian just
[1:26:52] prayed us on me he said you'd expect me
[1:26:53] to have big guns
[1:26:55] and be a big outlaw like he was and if i
[1:26:57] had his spirit that's what i would do
[1:26:59] he said you know god never takes his
[1:27:01] spirit from the earth
[1:27:03] god takes his man but never his spirit
[1:27:06] he said do you know what
[1:27:07] say for he took elijah a double portion
[1:27:09] of elijah's spirit come upon elijah
[1:27:12] is that right and several hundred years

[1:27:19] come out on the last day is that right
[1:27:21] god takes his man but not his spirit his
[1:27:24] spirit remains here
[1:27:26] and when his when the spirit's gone the
[1:27:28] church is gone then

[1:27:31] salvation no more care
[1:27:33] mercy's over then the spirit's gone he
[1:27:35] said the holy spirit was upon the
[1:27:37] apostles that was upon the apostles

[1:27:49] told you i had the spirit of this famous
[1:27:51] outlaw

[1:27:53] anointed like him
[1:27:55] and if i told you i had the spirit of
[1:27:56] some famous artist you'd expect me to
[1:27:58] stretch your canvas out here
[1:27:59] and catch waves of the ocean and things
[1:28:01] like that he said if i had a spirit
[1:28:03] and if i confess to have the spirit of
[1:28:05] jesus
[1:28:07] on us then we should do the things that
[1:28:09] jesus did
[1:28:11] jesus said he could do nothing but what
[1:28:13] the father showed him
[1:28:14] amen isn't that right he said now when
[1:28:16] the angel of the lord appeared to moses
[1:28:18] it wasn't moses
[1:28:19] it was the angel of god and when he when
[1:28:22] he appeared

[1:28:25] of fire isn't that right

[1:28:29] then his scholar knows that that was the
[1:28:31] angel of the covenant which is christ

[1:29:33] calco and cut it out

[1:30:24] comes from rome throughout the world
[1:30:26] catholicism with protestant
[1:30:28] protestant uh protestantism joined into
[1:30:30] it organized religion
[1:30:32] they're going to unionize the churches
[1:30:34] till every church will have to bow to
[1:30:35] that thing
[1:30:36] or enter the nominations up or kick to
[1:30:38] the sideline isn't that right
[1:30:40] revelation 9 chapter he said and it was
[1:30:42] commanded
[1:30:43] that it should not hurt the grass or the
[1:30:45] trees neither any green thing
[1:30:47] neither any tree but those men which
[1:30:49] have not the seal of god in their
[1:30:51] forehead
[1:30:51] he said when the plagues was coming only
[1:30:53] thing that was protected
[1:30:55] was those who were sealed away into the
[1:30:57] kingdom of god
[1:30:59] he said this is the investigating
[1:31:01] judgment
[1:31:02] when men and if god helped me he said uh
[1:31:04] with the word of the lord
[1:31:06] that is at the time of the sealing of
[1:31:07] the plagues and those things are
[1:31:08] rejected
[1:31:09] there is nothing left but eternal
[1:31:12] punishment
[1:31:13] hey many men hallelujah do you love him
[1:31:15] he could begin to please something
[1:31:16] softly
[1:31:17] hallelujah i'll end this off here with
[1:31:19] his quote
[1:31:20] the seal of god 11 this morning let's
[1:31:22] talk about that seal and we closed he
[1:31:24] said well did he ever see a railroader
[1:31:25] loading cars
[1:31:27] he said he'll go out and set so much
[1:31:29] hair and so much there
[1:31:31] the inspector comes by he looks in he
[1:31:34] said and if this is a little loose
[1:31:35] it shakes nope he said i won't seal it
[1:31:38] got to tear it out and do it over again
[1:31:41] next thing he'll do is try to load it
[1:31:42] again
[1:31:43] he'll get this wrong the inspector will
[1:31:45] come by
[1:31:46] wrong do it over again and that's what
[1:31:49] god has been doing with his church for a
[1:31:51] long time
[1:31:53] you load up and you're going to heaven
[1:31:55] you're taking everything with you your
[1:31:57] card games huh
[1:31:58] every other thing that you can load into
[1:32:00] the church you're trying to take it with
[1:32:01] you
[1:32:02] god just condemns it ain't ready for
[1:32:04] sealing
[1:32:06] but when god sees a man contract broken
[1:32:09] spirit
[1:32:10] sincere in heart down at the altar
[1:32:13] god closes the door of the world to him
[1:32:16] and seals him in there by the baptism of
[1:32:20] the holy ghost
[1:32:21] and it lasts until jesus comes
[1:32:24] not from one revival to another but
[1:32:27] until the day
