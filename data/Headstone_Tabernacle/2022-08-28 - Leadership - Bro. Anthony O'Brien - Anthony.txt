upon your people in Jesus amen God bless you [Music] praise the Lord God bless you and Welcome to our Sunday morning service it's so good to be in his presence is the most important thing for our lives to get into God's presence amen and you know Only God know Eden when man got kicked out he put angels to God the we got that tree so that man cannot partake of that life that tree of life in that condition but now the angels are driving and striving to get us back into that position you the angel of the more for you than against you you don't know how much God working day and night to get you back in your position and please how much accidents how much disasters how much things God has protected you from praise God things seen unseen praise God and God has been blessing and helping you to get back because we are in Satan's Eden make no don't make no bones about it we are incident Eden hell is on the earth and I was thinking about um about what the devil is using now and I see using the music in particular every time music behind it everything in the movies the music social media and it's all that four-dimension realm the prince of the power of the ear and the worst thing the devil have for the Church of deception to see if he could deceive you because once you see it get off the word it's like the hung of hell because remember remember with the battle not against flesh and blood it's not flesh and blood it's not your family and your friend no it's principalities and Powers coming upon family and friends praise God is the devil coming upon them and you you have a battle in your hand and once you understand that you fight every day every single day you fight not weekly every single day you want to be a Christian every day you want to fight every day praise God you want to give God a witness that you'll have a testimony like Shattuck Michigan and then they go you'll have a testimony like Daniel you will have a testimony like all the heroes are fake out there oh praise the name of the Lord so something else is she called the Liturgy of the message and the hug and stay close to this word because heaven will pass away but what is those cannot pass away and the only thing the devil cannot deceive is the word you cannot mess up with the word and if you become a word break you cannot be deceived you will begin to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks and when we begin to recognize listen to these words now when you begin to recognize the devil is then you will effectively start to overcome because if Satan is not coming up to you and all I am the devil no he's you know that he slowly does things he does things in a slow way to pull you into his web he don't just drop down and do this you know it's a slow way you stop praying you slow you stop praising it's very slow you stop coming out you're very slow and it's just taking you over oh praise God but we are here to resist the devil he said resist the devil he shall flee that's our order from God resist the devil and you can flee your tolerated resist him let him know you are against him let him know you're still standing with him praise God let him know that you're standing with God you're standing with the word Oh Glory to God presents the devil oh Hallelujah he shall free from you he many men put up a resistance they'll just give in don't just let go praise God one shall let go he likes that when you let go and you're easy you let go oh praise God and you come here to say all of this praise God hallelujah you may be seated praise God Amen so the devil will drop you from hot to cold no he doesn't drop from Port to call you on fire and you just get cold cold cold no you're gonna drop it to lukewarm and to do that he had to turn down the temperature turned on the fire in your life turn on the seal and the enthusiasm slowly like a fire burning bright and he's just blowing it down lowing it down until I come from heart praise God halfway hot and then you get a kind of warm then they get lukewarm you head into cold so you're back sitting but you're in church you're baxton but you're not praying as you ought to be and you're not saying help me Jesus like I'm sinking but praise God you come here today to humble yourself only with overcome is when you could humble yourself I'm wrong I'm sorry I ain't no good I need help oh Pray For Me Oh pray is God lift me up in prayer Give the Lord some praise to somebody we have no break we have no authority to talk about one another we have not authority to slander one another we have no authority to pull somebody down a brother don't pull them up I put a backside restore him about them they have not seen him pray for him say God have mercy your home the hell is after him but I come in the name of Jesus I come to claim him I come to claim her okay the Lord some Praises Hallelujah that is what we're here for to encourage one another not to be read self-righteous over somebody else not to say that you more spiritual than somebody else we not here for that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God let me see them do you understand that blue corn is dangerous how God interpret Luke I'll spill you out of my mouth is that they are hotter your cold if you call your dead but if you lukewarm you're halfway halfway you're not always in sell all and bite that for you you have to be all the way in Oh Glory the goddess worth it this is put it tear not him who can destroy the body but tell him who can destroy your soul this is worth it what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul oh praise God Amen I want to read a thank you from the kiru family good morning Saints and greetings in the precious name of the Lord I just want to take this time to thank

God email and Sydney feel the presence of God this morning with us so we thank God for everything so without further Ado uh like to go to our Bibles and uh read from the scripture this morning amen we have a few thoughts to share I pray that to be a blessing to you this morning amen so three portions of scripture we want to read from actually first from Matthew uh Matthew chapter 8 on Books five I'll go back to Psalms we just read from Psalms one and then I'll go back to sync Loop in the New Testament 24 Okay so praise God it's just the order of it I uh just how it come to me so Matthew chapter 8 um and who's five right so he says that when Jesus entered into Capernaum they came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant liar at home sick of the policy grievously tormented and Jesus said unto him I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou has come under my roof but speak the word only my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me I say to this man go and he goes unto another come and he cometh unto my servant do this he doeth it when Jesus heard it he modeled and said to them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel amen and now Psalms chapter 1 we just want to read through there Psalm chapter one okay and it says blessed is a man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners or sitted in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and bringeth forth fruit in his season his leave also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but I like the chaff which the wind driveth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment no sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish amen lastly we want to read from Saint Luke 24 amen and then we you know we see it's after we pray one more time amen so Saint Luke 24 and we want to turn to um 50th birthday amen just last portion of Saint Luke and says and he led them out as far as to Bethany he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was pointed from them and carried up into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God amen amen amen praise God he had a blessed God this morning amen religious power heads now as we want to pray one more time Heavenly Father Lord we've read your word this morning and Lord It's a sacred thing Lord we do father Lord when we come behind this desk to speak to your purchased lawn so father we want to reverence this moment father Lord and understand it with Godly fear Lord and approach your word Lord father with fear and trembling knowing oh God at the time drawing closer god father Lord that you're you're soon coming o god father to give a reward to them Lord father who have worked Lord father Lord who did a measure of feet that you've given us father Lord may your Holy Spirit come down on a special way now Allah May a bless your people Lord father and anoint us as we Endeavor not to to to to dive into these scriptures Lord we pray that you bring it to life Lord father I pray to come along in a special way and touch Lord my voice Lord touch what I have to say Lord take complete control of it Lord father you take charge this morning and may you speak your word only Father Allah lift it up Lord father and edified Lord strengthened in some way Lord Lord that our living will not be in vain but maybe be able to help one another by the ministry of the word father Lord may your Holy Spirit Come on minister a day every heart in life now we pray take charge of the service now father in Jesus name we pray and ask it amen any man you may have your seats God bless you thank you so much amen amen and amen blessed be the name of the woman are you happy to be in this house this morning amen praise the name of God will have a title this morning titled by message is leadership and the subject of my message is in authority under Authority amen and I would before I even get into this message this morning I just certainly want to appreciate the leadership of the holy spirit this morning and the leadership of God we want to acknowledge God in our lives as much as we see him moving and and working things out for us we couldn't have done it without his grace how many appreciate God this morning hey man let's give him a praise offering right now and just thank the Lord father we thank him we praise your father for your goodness and your mercy Lord amen Sydney wanna appreciate uh just an auspicious thing here but I appreciate our pastor but over and our leadership we appreciate the Lord appreciate these men of God also Reverend is like a woman and uh we thank God for the leaders Among Us who who who have inspired the word and stay with God's word to keep on because there's a vision of a church coming to perfection praise God and we believe with all our hearts that that God has called us to this vision and all of us have a part to play in it praise God somebody will have a small part some might have a great part but they all have to work together and every piece is connected amen we're all very important to the kingdom of God just like brother Branham said he said I want every part of my body I want my little talk and my little finger is important to me it might look like much to you but it means a lot to me and that's the way God sees all of us amen every single part of us must be able to work to the effectual working of his power praise God and a place there for a reason amen isn't that right so we thank God for every little part for every brother for every sister for every prayer for every stand for every word of encouragement for every amen a shoulder towed a wheel we thank God for all of it isn't that right amen and amen so praise the name of the Lord so so that's my theme today and that's my general thought wanted to speak on leadership and God you know I could probably just reflect on this but you know God has kind of been showing me a lot of things for the past few years in particular and I've seen the hand of God in my life in a special way uh showing me things uh instructing me in things uh educating me in things and it's so important to have a spirit of willingness to be willing to learn uh you know learn of me then see God God speaks to us and um you know it's it's so important even no matter how much older you get you know we tend to think we're like the prophet said we get self-secure you know uh in our ability to know things or understand things maybe we come to a point where we even opt to teach younger ones still even in that condition we have to be in a place that where we could learn things I genuinely believe that that's where we're coming to because we're going to a place where we we haven't been before and it take God to lead us by inspiration amen and by Revelation to show us where he wants to go isn't that right look at Joshua Joshua when they were Conquering the land God told Joshua meditate on a word day and night and you'll have good success now every city required a different strategy or required a different tactic in order to take it it's not right the way they conquered Jericho was not the same way they conquered the AI isn't that right and the way they conquered eye is not the same way they conquered the other city and the other city and so forth and the jebusites and the parasites they all require different plans and strategies as God moves forward but as long as Joshua was willing to listen to his Captain's instructions as long as he was willing to be led then he was willing to follow then they had the victory every single tongue as long as they followed God's instructions they got the Victory and as long as you are willing to follow God's leadership oh somebody say Amen as long as you're willing to follow God's instructions you will get the victory in your life over every trial over every test over every table over every enemy over every opposition or there shall no evil be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life and as I was with Moses so shall I be with you God's Gonna approve you hallelujah amen if you're willing to be lame amen to have the right attitude I was in a class I think I might have said this before anyway I was in a class learning about graphic design and stuff and the uh the lecturer put on a video for us and he was like you know you'll watch this video uh about one of the one of the courses it was so sad I saw turn around I saw one of my classmates uh and he made a remark he said you know I know this already you know I've seen this before and then he pulled out his cell phone and scrolled through into account or something and it was just so sad because here it is he has an opportunity to get maybe a refresher or maybe he has something he never heard before but because he took that attitude he shut down his opportunity to learn something and to clean something new the human brain is interesting I learned about something recently called habituation and habituation is when your brain begins to learn your environment and it habituates it and it becomes habitual meaning that your brain gets comfortable with seeing the same images all the time right so after a while you tend to not notice certain things you know it tends to bypass your your your your brain kind of thing you know um so you might have walked in the the building this morning and probably not noticed there was a bottle on top of that ledge there you didn't turn to look at it it's there but your brain habituated it because maybe you saw it before and your brain said well I you know I'm trying to learn new things so I'll disregard the things I've seen before and sometimes this can be an enemy to you to your progress because when you get so used to something you don't notice when maybe there's a subtle change in your environment that might actually be a danger to you but you don't notice it right away you know sometimes some people on the show and they see the water go back and they say oh maybe a wave's coming in maybe it's not going back in more what they don't even realize that maybe a title is coming but they get so used to seeing the ocean they drive by and say well it's not the ocean they don't even realize when something unusual is happening isn't there a tsunami or some warning you see because he habituated it and so it's a really bad approach to take and so what we want to do especially when when we're in the presence of gone is to take every opportunity we can to learn of God and to learn it because sometimes you haven't heard it until you heard it sometimes you have to hear it again praise God and sometimes when you hear it again your brain picks up something new that you probably didn't hear before amen amen isn't that right and sometimes that's God speaking to you praise God because yeah I hadn't heard it until you heard it until it's resonated in there until it's become solid in me until that seed is sewn in there and then when it's sown God can pour His Revelation upon it and reveal what is being spoken and reveal to you personally what is being said because once it's revealed to you you could now have it you could possess it you could walk in it it could materialize for you this morning oh so if God revealed to you this morning that you're gonna be healed maybe you heard it before but this morning in the presence of the Shekinah he's gonna make it fresh to you this morning fresh Manna Hallelujah he can anointed afresh he can Inspire afresh to your heart and life this morning to make you know that you're going to be healed that you're going to be delivered that you're going to be restored that you're going to be sealed oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah so let's get into spirit this morning praise God let's get on the expectation this morning to hear what God will speak amen because I am under expectation you're an expectation praise God Amen to hear what he will sing amen praise God I'm just as excited as you amen praise God so God bless you leadership now I just found it was a foundational principle teaching of Life see this theme and subject of leadership and there was a zoom uh meeting that we had quite a while back about parenting but Ovid had hosted so graciously and loved what he brought out one of the most pivotal things I thought that he brought out was a how he connected parenting to leadership you know uh and how being a parent is really being a leader in that capacity you know uh like a parent caring for a child and even God Likens himself to a parent he Likens himself to a father he's called El Shaddai the breasted one nurse upon his breast nurse upon his promises he he Likens himself unto a a parent a father caring for his children consumed for his sons concerned for his daughters concerned that they would that they would make it that they would overcome concerned that their needs would be met all the time he's concerned about you this morning even when you were lost and undone even when you were in sin even when you were away from his presence even when like The Prodigal Son maybe you took your little inheritance and went away to a far country even then he was concerned about you because always then the portals waiting and watching praise God watching for you watching for me come home oh all you are wearing come home all you are struggling Oh Come unto me all you do a heavily Laden and I'll give you rest or do you need rest this morning oh do you need guidance this morning he's here to lead you this morning oh to lead you oh to your trial through your tests through your Wilderness through the dry places he's here to lead this morning oh Hallelujah I'll follow leave me Lord I'll call you have called me and I will answer the call this morning oh how many want to be led I caught this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah amen so I have kind of two I kind of split it into two the thought today talking about in authority and under Authority yeah so we're gonna look at leadership in two ways in that sense and of course to be under Authority is to be under God is your leader right so if you're under Authority then you're under the leadership of God you're under his command amen and if you're in Authority then I mean God give you Authority and God makes somewhat of a leader out of you yourself then you are carrying the light that he has imparted to you as a leader in Your Capacity and you are leading others to that same Christ to that same word to that same Jesus isn't that right praise God so you want to look at it like that at the end and so on Amen so let's go leadership is very important it's a very important part of our life's journey amen I believe that with all my heart and almost everything about who we are and what we do and the choices we make and the atmosphere we create around us and what we allow to inspire action involves leadership amen and we can see that the purpose of God since the beginning was the established leadership himself then as you keep coming down he created angels He created the Earth and everything else there coming all the way down to Creation itself coming all the way down to a man itself then he established man as a leader over the Earth isn't that right a man in his own image I like this a creature isn't that right to reflect him because the monkey didn't look like him the trees didn't look like him praise God the sky the sea something had to reflect him on Earth to manage this this this this Earthly realm that he had created this domain that he had created it needed a leader praise God and God establish a son praise God and said have dominion he gave this man Spirit man in the beginning Genesis one man he said have dominion over every creeping thing over every fall of the air over every fish of the sea and over everything that creeped upon the Earth he gave that man no minion he gave that man leadership by position by Authority and of course he had the character in nature like gone you see but this leadership was given you see he never did what we are going through now coming through all these hard stuff and having the world toss us about to and fro he didn't have to go through all of that as yet you see it was just given to him this Authority and this power and even in that condition we see that man fail it's not right please go any man praise God so don't feel too terrible this morning you made a mistake he was a man given a position and he fell from that estate but God promised to restore us he promised to bring us back to a place of power to a place of authority but this time he's going to establish leadership he's gonna she's gonna lead you and he's gonna make you a leader yourself praise God so that you could lead by example oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen amen isn't that right so it could be the right kind of a leader amen because if we see in today's world there's a lack of leadership there's a lack of genuine leadership amen isn't that right people who are willing to go the extra mile praise God willing to see the problems that are out there and find a way to fix them amen isn't that right and to make it better create a better system amen that's what it's all about so since the beginning we see that God wanted establish this right so leadership then actually isn't about position it's not about power it's about the ability to act in a positive way that uses the powers or abilities that one possesses in order to advance a cause to pursue a vision or to achieve an objective okay that's what leadership is praise God it's not right so because the truth is any one of us can be a leader at any level a parent can be a leader student can be a leader a teacher can be a leader a policeman can be a leader a prisoner can still be a leader in his environment he has the ability he can create a positive environment around him so your environment doesn't necessarily have to declare how you behave and act you could take up the the the the mantle you can choose to be somebody that influences others in a positive way isn't that right even Joseph was a leader when he went to prison amen he acted and behaved in a way that gave him a certain level of recognition to the point where he became one of the head of the of the people in the in the in the prison cells there isn't that right he was going around feeding different prisoners and they were so confident in his abilities praise God that they Place him in a position of leadership because he acted in a transparent way that brought all of the all everything together all that he had learned all that God had taught him all that he was praise God isn't that right amen see so we find leadership in different positions see so uh because there are people in in higher powers of society who aren't leaders at all you know we do what they tell us because they might have power over us but they're not very good leaders isn't that right they don't possess the qualities of true leadership so this leadership thing is really important and really truly when you look at the Bible and you see how God acts and behaves and we see his motive his objective his nature and how he treats with others and how he speaks to others uh and how he expresses himself we see the true traits of a genuine leader in God Almighty isn't that right uh Matthew 15 7 I want to read this here uh Jesus uh then came his disciples and saying unto him so Jesus would just finish blasting the Pharisees um you know concerned in the washing of hands and pots and stuff like that so they said no it's down uh that the Pharisees were offended after they heard the same and he said and he answered and said but every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up he said let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind boat shall fall into the ditch yeah isn't that right so the people are suffering for a lack of leadership and the leaders need a vision to cling to because without a vision of people perish you see so we thank God for our vision a vision of perfection a vision of Holiness a vision of a pure Church Without spot without wrinkle washed in the blood of the lamb and we believe in that vision and we are pressing towards that Vision this morning by the grace of God because God's word cannot fail his word is just as sure as we are in this Tabernacle this morning he's gonna send a Revival he's gonna pour out the Holy Spirit he is going to heal the broken heart him he is going to set the captive free he's going to break the bands of wickedness and evil upon your life everything that you're struggling with there is a mighty spirit this morning that's about to be released upon the children of God for you who have been steadfast for you who have been faithful to your leader the Holy Ghost God it's gonna reward you with your glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire that will sweep over your soul oh Hallelujah it will mend a broken hearted or it'll bring Liberty to the captive oh that is a vision and that is what we believe this morning oh can we give the Lord a shout of praise hallelujah oh Hallelujah I feel him in my hands I feel him in my feet I'd feel him all over me this morning the prophecy is true it is real God is just as real as he ever was and he promised by his word that he's gonna deliver you that he's going to restore you that he's gonna heal you that he's gonna lead you put your trust in him this morning oh put not your trust in princes or in Horsemen where there is no help David said I looked onto the hills from whence cometh my help my help coming from the Lord the Lord which made heaven on Earth he shall not suffer thy foot to be moved the Lord I keep it till thee will not Slumber he is not asleep this morning he is looking at you he is watching over you he is your leader this morning he is your guy he is your shelter he is your rock he is your protector he's the reason why I'm living he's the reason why I'm breathing he's the reason my son is living he brought me out he brought me through too much and I can't praise God I don't care if you call me crazy but I love Jesus I love Jesus because he led me this far somebody give God a shot of praise Hallelujah glory to God oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah oh I'm gonna let the devil know he's still a Healer he's still a deliverer he's still a restorer priests till a baptizer he can make a way for you out of no way cause he's a true leader and he will lead his people out of the darkness and into the light the light of Jesus Christ hey get a lot of shout out praise oh Hallelujah [Applause] excuse me man oh praise God are you loving this morning amen Hallelujah just an encouragement this morning amen yes sir so that's the vision and we're looking too and Jesus made a way for this to come to pass to the Cross he bridged the gap bring us back into himself God's Gonna reconcile you back to himself praise God because we are lost Adam who had the first estate God established him as a leader he fell from that he didn't have the the you know he didn't uh he didn't do the right things to continue his leadership so we just fell through isn't that right but God knew all things and he put all things in place and and even though the title he acts the title deed to the Earth the devil wanted to grab it when it left Adam's hand he wanted to grab it on his way up but his hands were too slippery he doesn't have the character or the nature that it takes a beer a real kind of a leader so it went back to their hands to the original leader uh which is which is God Almighty man which is the one on the throne waiting for the time that we could be reconciled where we could take back the leadership take back the control Take Back The Authority praise God hallelujah of the sons of God on the earth isn't that right oh my isn't that right praise God so God is concerned about who we are it's not right because Who We Are is how we lead say that again who we are is how we lead ership is tied to the individual it's tied to the character it's tied to the person so because that is that way God is very concerned about Who We Are because on our nature and how we conduct ourselves our Behavior our attitude because power without character is satanic amen it's not right and he's very concerned about us because if we not in the right place in our hearts and our minds we can really mess things up all right let's read a quote here from the prophet Simon and church age Prophet said unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him he said you have to suffer oh my God this is big this is not conflicts amen you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering hey glory to God you gotta suffer to make it you gotta go through something praise God honey you gotta compare the marks of past experiences that taught you how to walk right how to talk right how to love your neighbor as yourself you got a better marks that shows that you've been through something that was real this cars remind us that the past is real that you went through something when Jesus appeared to his disciples he said look at my hands look at my feet touch me handle me see that it is I Jesus I died I suffered but I also rose again I am victorious oh Hallelujah and I made it and because he made it you're gonna make it too oh he came back as a witness oh to show you that you are gonna make it and even as my father had sent me even so sin are you go and preach the gospel see it's them compel them my table shall be full oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen amen Glory what a thought experience he went through something it was real but he come out to testify to let them know that I'm alive that I made it through the pain that I made it past the cross Jesus told his own disciples he said a servant is no greater than his Lord so he said if I hated the world hated me then they're gonna hate you also but he said don't you worry not a hand your head shall be touched oh Hallelujah I will give you a mouth to speak and you will speak my wisdom and confound them that are wise oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God he put his power in you he put his glory in you as a witness oh Hallelujah of his resurrection his resurrection power that it is true I am a true witness and that's what we need in this message not too much talk people saying all kinds of stuff people making up all kinds of stuff forget about it praise God hallelujah we're not here to make up anything pre-charital is our Victory and we are here to fight oh we are not entitled to anything we entitled we are supposed to die we are supposed to be slain we are supposed to be hanging across like he did but he took our place so that we could have the victory oh I don't know if you hear me this morning oh I feel so excited now I feel so happy now oh Hallelujah because I'm gonna have victory over myself [Music] you know what that is the greatest enemy is not out there somewhere the greatest enemy is not Putin it's not Trump it's not this one it's not that one no the greatest enemy is me I am my greatest enemy my greatest hindrance if I can get William Branham out of the way then God could take a hole then God's spirit could flow through oh Hallelujah so his greatest mission was to get out of the way he said you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on the Holy Spirit and he's there talking and he said you know Jesus one time and then all of a sudden suddenly move in the building and he said he is here or the leader just stepped in the leader just came by oh and he said I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God he was under Authority he was in authority to speak to the devil not a spirit move until I say so praise God you are frozen you have been arrested by the voice of God oh Authorities on the Earth oh once more once more this world will hit direct from God there'll be a bride on the earth that will speak those voices then she will have that Authority and it will Thunder it will shake the devil it's shaking the devil this morning or the leader is here our captain is here our King is here get out of here devil Make Way bring down

[Applause] okay watch my time but praise God we love the Lord we feel this present too much cactus of victory not a gift let's get back to this here a man without character can't Reign Prophet said because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule oh Hallelujah and since he wants us to share even in his throne hear these words now huh on the same basis that he overcame and is sat down in his father's room see to her Dominion in his room right that's what it means and then we have to overcome to sit with him so in order to sit with him you have to overcome and you can't overcome until he had some tests that was give to you oh that makes it real oh then you know God Is A Healer because he went to a test and he proved himself to be a Healer you know Hallelujah he's a deliverer because he went through a test and he delivered you oh and if God could do it for that brother he could do it for you this morning we've got to do it for the sister he could do it for you this morning don't you fail don't you fail oh God is able he doesn't give us more than he could bear but in every Temptation he has made a way of Escape for us oh hallelujah

it's not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that we revealed in US when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation amen praise God with Glory I think we got the message all right so let's move on now amen Hallelujah glory to God so a leader is someone who cares they show what our actions that they prove that their actions prove that when necessary they will put their life recklessly on the line to save people they care about that's what a leader does to advance at just cause that they completely believe to be the truth they'll do whatever it takes to make sure that cause is advanced because it's not about them it's about the cause pray he's going on whoever's got the ball then let's defend like we're crazy but get that man today to the goal get that man to the end zone I don't have to have the ball maybe run over it has a ball maybe but Isaac has a ball maybe somebody else has a ball then defend like

to Everlasting shame and contempt oh Hallelujah but at that time God promised at that time Michael is going to stand up and begin to deliver every name that is on the book because there's a life behind that name there's a person behind each name in the book there's somebody God had to find or that somebody God chose God elected God predestinated oh Hallelujah to be conformed to the image of his son and God will need the 99 and he'll go after that one this morning because he is a good shepherd He is a good leader not leaving the 99 and go after the one sheep oh blood is lost that sheep that has lost their way he is able this morning to go after you and to help you and to lift you put you up on his shoulders are you home [Music] [Applause] oh Hallelujah that's the kind of leader that he is amen the father who cares isn't that right uh where was I right see he empowers others that's what he does that's language he speaks see that's why Jesus said because I live you shall live also it's not right told his disciples he's speaking over them they don't have faith to catch it praise God they're hearing it like words you know like water of our dogs back they say just kind of rolling off it seems but he's still speaking over them because he knows that in that Resurrection Ministry he's going to come back and recycle these things back to them and tell him didn't under uh did not remember when I spoke these things to you and began to bring back the word and open their understanding to the scriptures to make them understand who he is and what he was sent to do and by revealing it he could reveal what they were sent to do and what their lives were about oh hallelujah hallelujah oh I'm so glad I decided to follow Jesus I'm so glad I decided to follow Christ some people say I'm crazy some people say what a 33 year old young man doing so passionate about church but it's not about church it's about a supernatural experience it's about an encounter I had with something that

want that's what I come for I can't settle for nothing less oh Hallelujah by that field [Music] what a glorious inspiration notice when God speaks it's always like it's radical that's good it's always you know it always challenges the human thinking because yeah you know myself and then brother ask him for bread so I'm gonna do that you know and you try to reason it out but God is faithful and just to supply all your needs according to his riches and Glory you say consider the birds consider the lilies of the field they don't have a worry for tomorrow as soon as they wake up they start to praise God as soon as the birds wake up they start to sing the Morning Glory Hallelujah Point their fist the mother dust romance they come we're gonna sing with all their hearts oh hallelujah hallelujah

too early why but too late but he's always on time in your situation in your circumstance he knows just when to do it and he does it and we thank God for it oh Hallelujah and we say this is the day that the Lord has made and we will rejoice and be glad in it the Lord has chased on his soul but he had not given me over unto death I am alive this morning and I am in the house of God to give God

strength to the weak he could give a bread to the faints amen and those that wait upon his name amen do you believe it this morning amen so I just had a few things here treats of a good leader cares for others caring person you know Roman Centurion he cared for a servant just think about it Roman Centurion he's got it all set up praise God he got government benefits checks um his house comes probably with a salary you know people actually draw salary from working in his house like and he has servants you know and he cared enough for his servant to go and seek help for him there's some leaders who would say so one sick all right tell HR you know that um that's the end of that I'm gonna find somebody else you know sick boy yeah that's not convenient let's get somebody else or something you know but no it's Roman Centurion I had a heart for a servant so much so that he went about the streets looking for help for him went to Facebook Marketplace for somebody a poster sign anything look at to see who we could get to help his children and somehow or another He Came Upon Us came across Christ my Ministry someone testified maybe I don't know how we came across it but but the fact that he was looking for him oh I admire that he's a good servant he was concerned uh he was a good uh leader he's concerned for his servant it's not and when they saw Jesus song said Jesus heard about you praise God and have a servant of sick but I love what he said he said I'm a man in authority and I am under Authority and I say don't go and he go I said don't come and he come I said to one do you do it so I know if I have authority and I could do that then I see you have authority oh sickness because you say a sickness go and you go in you say healing come and he come in you say do and he doing you said pick up your bed and walk and they're getting up so it had to be something about that oh and that Marvel Jesus That Shook Jesus because he hadn't seen Faith like that oh not in all of Israel we hear the man with a natural understanding who understood who Jesus was praise and the Pharisees couldn't see him on the sadness he's couldn't see him oh Hallelujah I was so sad you see how they couldn't see him oh hallelujah hallelujah but God reveal himself to whomsoever he will oh and he give Revelation oh it's even the smallest person even the most illiterate person oh honey you don't have to read all right but God can speak to you this morning God can show you his glory god can show you his power God could show you something to help you get what you're looking for amen a real leader is fully persuaded and really they will risk his own life for others it's not right look at Moses when God wants to judge the people God throw himself in front and said no no take me instead that's a real leader he acted out like Christ would amen when he came on a cross and he died taking on the sins of man did the same thing what was it christ-like leadership amen leaders go first Into the Danger praise God hallelujah just like David praise God hallelujah said who is this uncircumcised Philistine they will not wait for anybody to do it you know they would have went get went and get five smooth stones and fill his little script Pride he going down to meet the enemy on any ground he comes upon why because God had trained David on the back side of the desert he might have been a mighty warrior he might not know how to handle a sword but he was trained by God and he saw a picture God taught him through his backside of the Wilderness experience to his desert experience a little boy dressed in dear skin and playing a harp didn't look like much but God was with him or teaching him how to fight the bear teaching them how to fight the lion teaching them how to take care of his sheep oh how to be a good shepherd that's what it takes to be a great leader oh hallelujah hallelujah no wonder a man like that could become king over Israel is that right it was taught how to lead by the best leader we know how God himself isn't that right amen leadership inspires pulse amen praise God leadership understands civitude not self-service but service others focuses on the solutions and not the problem it's not a good leader listens is that right Jesus said he doesn't keep on my Commandments and do with them he it is that love with me not just hear him but you're doing something about it you're listening willing to learn willing to put what you've been taught into action to get a result good result a good report that's a leader amen always willing to learn could be 99 years old still willing to learn something new that's right that's a real leader one of the most important things is that they understand their Rule and function and they understand what part they play in the program of things so they're really knows how to do that because they understand what their part does for the overall achievement of the vision objective of what is trying to be achieved isn't that right understand how they fit in and make the most of the time that is given to them to play their part that's what a leader is Luther played his part he was a leader when he saw that the people who didn't were ignorant or did not know of the great promise of God for their day he ripped a page out of the Bible and marched down the road that morning with a nail and a hammer in his hand and he pounded a note upon the upon the uh and upon the church door it's not right upon the door praise God the just shall live by Fate praise God let the whole world know praise God what God is saying here pray God what God is revealing here pray God he's convinced he was concerned or not only for himself but for the people and he preached a message and he preached them praise God out of that Catholicism praise God into the new move that God was moving which justification and there came a people out under that leader oh Hallelujah under the messenger oh Hallelujah and they lived justification and they did what they were supposed to do and they played their parts unlike a great relay race when their part was finished and handed over to Wesley and he played his part and he ran his race and he said you might not only Justified but you must live a Sanibel life amen you must never signify life clean up your act clean up your life clean up your house clean up your spirits get all the trash out get all the stuff out of here prepare yourself to be a tabernacle for the most holy God most holy God be a dwelling place oh Hallelujah and the people are so Sanctified oh Hallelujah that the Holy Spirit wanted to come upon them because they were playing their part oh hallelujah hallelujah they run their race and when they finish running the race the battle was handed over to the Pentecostals and here they come praying staying in the atmosphere Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ not the same promise he gave to Peter and Paul and Mary and the apostles on them he could give to them also that same Penny you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and they prayed all night and they wept and they prayed and they cried until they started a Revival until Holy Ghost compound oh and they ran to hear and they ran there or they were persecuted but they kept on running and as they run the fire spread the fire spread it kept spreading the devil couldn't stop it it was too late God had already started his great relay race hallelujah oh do you believe it this morning over to William Marion Branham and that might Eagle Prophet stood there and said there shall be a bride or that little freak that little woman she's got faith a little remnants she's waiting for her spirit out there she knows oh Hallelujah time is coming he prophesied he prophesied that there'd be a Revival not those seven Thunders that's not even written at that time will be made manifests he went through trials he lost his wife he lost his daughter he almost gave up but he kept on running he kept on running he got to get to us we have the last leg this morning we see the finish line coming into view we see Christ coming into view we can't slow down now we gotta keep running gotta keep pressing gotta keep praying gotta keep pressing gotta keep striving with all that is within us Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] amen Lori we have to understand our rule prophets preached light and said recognize your day and its message recognize your day recognize your message then go and not just go but go and tell something that he's the same yesterday today and forever that Messiah is on the earth now fixing things around for the coming of the Lord and at that time a voice I've got to be in you a little anoint revelation 22 17 the spirit on the battle say come come to your loved ones come to your family let don't let us worry come let him who's whoever will let him take up the word of life really when that time come oh might there be a bride on you the final voice to the final age amen oh wonderful and let me run on quick can we take some more amen I I don't want to be too long with you yeah stretch you out too much but there's just so much here and I just want to get the mean thing things in and then we could shout and praise again but he's gone amen so a few things about bad leadership see they obsessed with power see they love to control they focus on problems and not the solution they had the flip side focus on the solution the bad leaders focus on the problem too much see love recognition but they don't give it back love to be respected but they don't return it suffer from but over entitlement they have entitlement syndrome I kind of coined that phrase I feel like I believe I believe this belongs to me see they have a false sense of permanence always this is weird psychotic thing that happens with crazy leaders they always feel like they're supposed to be there forever yeah if they could transplant their brain and a heart into a new body it's our 21 year old body they would do it to live 70 years longer you know yeah it's just weird it's so it's crazy they just they obsess with permanence feel as though it's supposed to be like that for all the time not knowing that like yeah you don't have much time left you have a number of days and then that's it regardless of where you reach at that point you have to stop it's finite insurance no it's finished the game is finished out and normally what they do with that game is that they take all the dice they take all the cards and they pack it up in a box foreign box away okay the game is over everything they put it in a box nice little box fit perfectly three frame to put everything in the game is done finish everybody going home people take a little box of food and they're going home the game is finished so what what what race are you running this morning Hallelujah we got all these natural things they're gonna fade away that's why we've got a thing that cannot change everything around us changes but God Remains the Same he says I'm God and I change not and what he required for Moses he cried for Abraham he cried for Paul Peter who requires the same of you this morning a surrender life oh dedicated to God that is what could bring Jesus Christ into present tense amen amen do you believe it praise God one more thing here bad leaders they stand to win whole informational Knowledge from others in an effort to retain power I I find that really amazing and even you see it sometimes in a message world or something you know and then sometimes somebody would bring sometimes they bring a complicated thing and you wonder should I brought her uh should I have brought the checkered line copy book The Church to figure out what is being said I mean when God is trying to make it so simple because at the end of the day when you get this vision and you read it it's supposed to have one action you suppose he wasn't running to be able to run is not walking walking is one thing but to run means you have confidence Just Like Old David ran to me Goliath when you see a vision that inspires you to run then that Vision had to be made plain it had to be so simple that our baby could understand it because when you see it you have to be able to run to run this race oh and to seek his face and to turn aside from everything else every other distraction but Paul said lay aside every witch that so easily beset us and run the race with patience the race that is set before us oh Hallelujah [Applause] you see so it's interesting yeah man sometimes you see it in the workplace sometimes somebody teaching somebody yeah but they're telling them you know hyperbole you'll do something and the existential crisis of the and you can tell that they don't want to impart knowledge to the younger ones because they feel as though they're coming to take their job but a true leader knows how to empower others how to help others how to build others up how to share the light so that others can have it too because some when he's a little down maybe he could go to somebody else and get a little life for the journey because he shared his light he could get it back when it makes the full circle when it comes back around again this morning spread the gospel freely as you have received freely give and that's the Gospel of Jesus Amen amen amen so we are what we consistently do we have to be consistent about it not intense but consistent intensity is when you have a problem and you fight to solve it you spend two days fighting solve the problem as soon as you finish fighting solve any problem you go down to default mode what you used to do before the problem arise not so yes that's human nature but consistency behavioral habits amen that's what we want to form and if we form good habits praise God we can continuously do good things consistently and I genuinely believe that God wants consistency with our spiritual on daily living and daily practice oh is that right Paul said in Corinthians that I Die daily daily doing the will of God isn't that right and if we have profitable days then we can have profitable weeks if you have profitable weeks get our profitable months if we have profitable months we get our profitable years and if we have profitable years we can live a profitable life amen amen you could be a profitable servant praise God hallelujah amen who spent his Masters treasure with usury and gave interests amen isn't that right oh my see so God is an authority we honor his authority and I'm still gonna wrap this up here in about 10 minutes but he's gone under his Rule and under his leadership even the highest person in the land is under God isn't that right we believe that see Colossians 1 16 18 says for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible isn't that right it's the word here said whether they be troons or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and before it hit and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence isn't that right you believe it this morning amen Prophet said he own respects he said if you can't respect a man respect the office he holds in God that's exactly right he said see respect him if a minister comes up you're a pastor he said always respect him isn't that right and this respect is not only for the pastor now goes both ways see but uh the Bible said here Psalms 130 138 number six says though the Lord be high yet he had respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth afarov isn't that right on respect again the prophet said Ecclesiastes the 12th Chapter 13 Verse it's written like this he said see Let Us hear the conclusion of the whole matter he said fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the full duty of man the conclusion of the whole Mata is to fear God and when you cannot have his he said you cannot have respects until you have fear said you've got to have to fear God see Solomon said also in Proverbs that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom said no that don't mean that you're afraid of him Prophet said he said but that means that you're giving him respects and reverence when you respect God you fear God you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear that you would lest you do something wrong that you wouldn't want to see no hear this part this is a bomb no because he said I fear my mother I fear my my wife he said I fear my church I fear all of God's servants unless I should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way he said I fear the people oh wow what a prophet what humility you hearing is here now he said I fear the people of the city unless I should hear do I should do something wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what a respects huh praise God Amen what a respect you see somebody doing something we respect them in the office praise God we respect them for what they're doing for the kingdom of God isn't that right if I see somebody cleaning the carpet downstairs after church respect that brother say brother can I pass around but is it okay can I pass here always give them that respect they're doing something for the kingdom of God giving their respects it doesn't matter what they're doing whether they're cleaning washing cooking praise God hallelujah they're doing unto the Lord then give them their respects praise God amen amen hallelujah praise God see you've got to have respect before the uh before you've got see you've got you've before you can have respects sorry before you can have respects you've got to have fear he said I'm gone demands it he demands respects as a requirement no yeah yes God does he demands it and fear brings it and we know that fear brings respect see every Power every office is under God God is an authority by position and power isn't that right and he's a loving leader isn't that right praise God because he is love he can love and he could lead by love because that's who he is and who he is is how he leads and because he has Mercy he could merciful he could extend Mercy because he's a god that is rich in Mercy oh therefore he's a merciful leader praise God isn't that right we are his children and he is Father over us isn't that right Psalms 103 said the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in Mercy he will not always child neither will he keep his anger forever the life that he had not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as high as the heaven is above the Earth so great is his Mercy toward them that fear Him and as far as the East is from the West so far that he removed our transgressions from us oh somebody give God praise this morning and lack of power pity at his children so the Lord pity at them that fear Him oh he delivered them that fear him this morning oh Alias Mercy towards you if you need strength he's here to give you strength this morning if you need healing he said to give you healing this morning if you need Deliverance he's here to deliver you this morning he knows what you have need of he came in our body he came in a man called Jesus and he walked the streets of Galilee oh he was sick he had headaches he had things he went to trials he knows what you're going through this morning oh he knows what you had in need of oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my see merciful that's foreign so he flourish it but for the wind passed it over then it's gone and the place thereof shall know it no more but the mercy of the Lord is from Everlasting to Everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto his children children amen and amen praise God all right getting ready to wrap up here wow what a run amen oh man just a few more leadership see Prophet saying 965 he said remember that the first step in the universe made somebody let us your mother's your mothers remember the first steps that Junior the little bill made they don't remember it no more but somebody LED you to your first step Prophet said I remember when Billy Paul made a full step Joseph and all of them when they made their first step he said it's usually a mother that gets to lead the children to its footsteps usually because she's home while the dad is not working trying to make a living but it's when they made the first step at night time Daddy come home said he said oh Dad see Johnny and Mary little boy can walk little girl can walk see come and look and so on like that says he said no he said no somebody somebody helped you when you made your first step and he said and your last step that you ever make in this life somebody will be leading you see that's right I want you to remember that Prophet said your first step somebody LED you is that on your last step somebody will be leading you we have to be led you know he said God likened us unto sheep and did you know a sheep can't lead itself he'll wander away and stray away he just can't lead himself so he has to have somebody to lead him and sometimes the shepherd is supposed to lead the sheep and now that was back in the days of Lord Jesus he was the Good Shepherd he said but today you see we're living in another day and everything is changed and perverted is that right he said you know what man has to lead the Sheep today he said a goat he said you know where that goat leaves them right into the slaughter them little sheep don't know where they're going so the goat goes up into the pen of the slaughter and the Sheep don't know no more than to follow a leader so it just leads them right up into the slaughter and then the goat jumps over the track and the ship goes in and gets killed oh Hallelujah you see and he says see the goat a wrong leader amen so be very careful this morning who and what is leading you praise God what are you being influenced by is it influence on above or is it influence From Below judge it by the word of God how many men judge it by the word of God whether what kind of influence you're under what kind of leadership you're under amen Saint John 10 he said very nice saying to you he that entered not in by the door into the Sheepfold but climb it up some other way the same is a thief and a robber but he that enter in by the door is The Shepherd of the Sheep and to him the portal openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name and lead them out and when he put it for his own sheep he good before them and the Sheep follow him because they know his voice oh a stranger's voice they will not follow they will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers oh we have not followed a voice of a man this morning but we have been following the voice of our master of our Lord Jesus Christ who is the Good Shepherd and he loves you this morning and his voice is calling you home his voice is calling you to Healing his voice is calling you to Deliverance his voice is calling you to Restoration his voice is calling you to the Holy Ghost his voice is calling you this morning oh the day you hear my voice how to nod your hearts as in the provocation in the wilderness oh don't be like that now we're tempted but the day is voice Harden at your hearts hearken to his voice this morning and he had a Shepherd calling you this morning oh Hallelujah musician can get ready to call me man I'm getting to close out hey many men I watched a video one time of a man they said they had a whole bunch of sheep out there and they got people to go and call the Sheep people went to the heckling sheep scholarship nothing they didn't even look up this bad whatever but as soon as the Shepherd come he gave us a call yeah and all of them just sat around and come straight in front of him the Good Shepherd they know his voice and that's what God's voice is to us the devil has come come come come and look at this come and look at that come and get distracted come and look at this but we can't hear that praise God no no no no we've received a seed we're already impregnated with something something more than gold in our soul there's something in us this morning something brought you to church something brought you to that trial something brought you to that test something brought you to that persecution and though the devil tried to sift you like wheat oh but something in your heart like a stream running down it makes me feel so happy as happy as I can be and when I think about Jesus and all that is done for me oh I know something in my heart something is what holding the reins there's something within me oh that's a hole in the reins it's Jesus Jesus and my soul and oh I've touched the aim of his comments and his blood had made me whole I have a reason to shout I have a reason to lift my hands I have a reason to worship God this morning I Heard a Voice of the master the Good Shepherd and he is calling me home he is calling you home this morning home home never more to Rome oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen and amen praise God hallelujah but he that is in a higher link see bad bad leadership and not the shepherd whose own cheapest are not seen the World Cup and leave at the sheep and flee it and the Wolf captured them and Scattered them the Highland flee because he's a hireling and careth not for the Sheep Jesus said I am the Good Shepherd and I know my sheep and they are known of mine amen and amen praise God you're gonna get placed on Me Softly and get ready to move out here now amen so God is our leader and he wants to make leaders out of us it's not right I'll read something from adoption set adoption the truth is supposed to be predestinated onto the adoption of children where man God could take a man and adopt him into the family give him something that and first try that after he given something he said try it and see if it is right this is the approach you know the Bible said try the spirit this man claims a certain thing try it see if it's right and if it says right then move right with it then say Lord send us something else because he's leading you you're moving you're not standing still he said send us some more he said and just keep moving you see just keep moving until every fella take his place then you're going to see the Church of God begin to get into his place when the Philistines will go to backing up the shocks will go off hair will grow down faces will be washed cigars would be missing that's right oh Hallelujah then the church began to get into its Mighty power when we have an anania sense of fire and a few of them oh that's gonna happen again when you see one day yes sir but you see when that Holy Church stands together in his power positionally placed our sons of God adopted into the family of God powerful Church standing there in his glory oh that's what he's coming for oh hallelujah what do you look like what are you following he said what we have done he said you must chose your leader choose today the prophet said you choose life or death and your choice will determine your Eternal destination what you choose you can understand he said remember Jesus said follow me and you're invited tonight to do so and to follow him to eternal life you must come on his terms that's right the word not upon the Creed not upon the public opinion not upon what anyone else thinks about on what God said about it you say well brother Brown am I Noah I know a woman just as good as she can be does this or oh no a man went through this he said I can't help what they've done God's word said let every man's word be a lie and mind be truth you've got to come on his terms come on his conditions the word you can't come to a Creed you can't mix it like that see there's only one thing you could do just accept it on his tombs praise God it's not right he said I know it's a stone cutting message brother he said but get rid of all things of the world and follow me he said but I didn't come here to choose a message to the people just to make him sing or holler I've been in Hidden meetings where they've done the same and he said but I'm interested in your life I'm a servant of God that's got to answer someday and the ministry that the Lord has given me a Vindicated itself thousands of times before he said remember Jesus Christ said follow me follow me get rid of what you've got and follow me that's the only way to have eternal life that's the only remedy he gave this man talking about original ruler that was the only remedy he gave his businessman that's the only remedy he gives anybody his choice he makes his decision and it's perfect every time but we must follow him it's the only way to have eternal life and so the leadership God of God is to follow the Vindicated whatever by the Holy Ghost to be led by a spirit praise God Amen through everything give him thanks amen we praise God his brother Stephen gets ready to come forward and seeing God richly bless you hallelujah amen glory to God [Music] for you Lord prepare me this morning oh Lord prepare

prayer request from Ali Hugh Williams for his nephew I think a team and his wife they had twin daughters on August 9th earlier this month and one of the babies died this morning the other one that survived is feeding via a syringe she's not strong enough to fall from her mother thanking God in advance very Noble serious request this morning and we also want to keep remembering our sister Grace

goals our Visions our dreams our aspirations to you father Lord when we look back at our lives every time we try to do our own thing it feels it's only when we followed your leadership things worked out if we'd be so bold and so brave to acknowledge that is only when we walk in the steps that you have ordered for us things work out right so we thank you for your leadership and we thank you for putting a seed in our hearts Lord to be receptive to that still Small Voice that despite the condition we may have walked into this house this morning they're still pulling our souls that brought us here to hear from our theophany to hear from another dimension to hear from another realm Lord to remind us that we are more than our problems our situations we are more than the bills and the obstacles and our failures and the moments we did wrong and we did bad father we are challenged to pick ourselves up and to keep walking to keep following Lord and those footprints that you have laid for us Lord we have read notes of praises today and so many other days where we have seen your wonderwork in power and your grace that has always been sufficient for us and now this morning we come with a great need Lord for a family Lord that had the Lord Twins and one has already passed but another is holding on we pray dear God even now the angel of the Lord will walk into that room wherever that long lady is father and the angel of the Lord would step in and intervene and Lord the behalf of that child on behalf of that family oh God how hard and difficult it is at this time for them but Allah that's why you came may you minister to them and give them a strength that's deeper than their own strength rather merely learn to trust you and hold on we unite in faith as a Church of the Living God to bring Lord relief in this situation in the mighty name of Jesus Christ father Lord our preciousness degrees downstairs Lord may you continue to touch her love may all be normal in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and throughout this Tabernacle Lord hands will raise situations identified him the silent cry in the hearts of the people with situations they can articulate and those they cannot declare Lord may you move through the camp this morning and begin to make everything wrong right father may you touch the sick in our midst may you touch those that are broken hearted me you

Father Lord may we come to realize the fullness of joy because the joy of the Lord is our strength of Mayor is taught Joy be restored peace up may restore strengthen may you restore the passion to know the word up to cry to get into the spirit the fervent desire to please you Lord to make a church I will make a Revival Lord help us to step out of ourselves our situations our challenges and look up for Redemption draw it now hey lord it's so easy to get caught up in the situations around us but Lord we are challenged by the word Lord to look to you as our leader Lord to look up for Redemption draw at night you are our source you are our strength you are our peace you are our club you are rewarder you are our defensive you are our door you are away maker you are El shataya you are Jehovah

you have your way upon your people may you bring us back at your appointed time and Lord may you love me when I see a special prayer at this time father Lord for the backsliders for those that are struggling we see the enemy on a deliberate strategy to pick off one here and one there and one there and one there Lord and Lord but always talking about that fire being dimmed ever so slowly until you don't even realize your fire has gone out you don't even realize your lamp has gone out but oh God we want to unite as a church Lord if you said two shall agree touching anything we can have what we ask for so Lord we want to forget about ourselves and how we feel and unite and Faith as a church one agree with the other and agree with the other and agree with the other all over the building all on the internet we want to unite and fit because there's power in the Church of the Living God lord you stood at the grave of Lazarus a man who was dead for days and you said Lazarus come forth so we know there's no situation there's no problem there's no backslider who's in the realm of the living that you cannot deliver because you delivered a dead man so father God in the name of Jesus we pray for the backsliders for the weaker ones up for those that are struggling that are in the building that are awesome in the mighty name of Jesus we lose the Bloodhound but after them today to arrest him and to bring them back under the leadership of the Holy Ghost House of Hell give way to the name of the mighty name The Wonderful Name the Glorious name of the Lord Jesus Christ of and a dimension of that name every knee will bow every tongue has a confession that Jesus Christ is Lord we lift your name higher today we give you the glory we give you the honor in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says and the church says Give the Lord a handle praise [Music] you may be seated for a few announcements [Music] something else when you catch a burden and the burden is bigger than you Vision has to be bigger than you purpose has to be bigger than you the desire for God to be made manifest in and around your life has to be bigger than you you have to look Beyond you because sallam is not just for you there's somebody depending on your prayer somebody depending on your worship somebody depending on your sacrifice and we bring that sacrifice of praise this morning into the house of the Lord our next service continues on Wednesday night it will not be a physical service here at the Tabernacle it will be a live streaming service as you know Wednesday night is Independence there's a lot of different moving pieces around that so we will have a live stream service only on this coming Wednesday night at 8. p.m so be on a great expectation and set aside that time friends when you really look at how you spend your time and how you use your time and the value of your time we do not give God enough we don't the very best effort you could put on a daily basis is not enough for the one who made you wake up in the morning we have the best plans to achieve this and do that and accomplish this and if God don't wake you up nothing happening so the first thing when you wake up you say Lord thank you good morning [Music] I'm in the land of the living I have an opportunity to do something if he didn't wake you up this morning you could do nothing so I challenge you and there's an opportunity to worship to praise to be in the house of the Lord to connect and and in your own time you make time for the business of God so I want to encourage you connect the service on Wednesday night and this coming Friday it's the first Friday of the month so it's our prayer and our fasting day and fast during the day and at night at 8pm we come together in a zoom prayer meeting make it your priority on that day we don't know how much time we have left Lord teach me to number my days we don't know how much time we have left so every day every hour every minute there must be a consciousness of deity a consciousness of God can the Church Say Amen so again this coming Wednesday live streams if it's only this coming Friday time of prayer to be culminated by a zoom prayer meeting at 8pm on Friday and of course this coming Sunday we're back in the house of the Lord I also want to make mention that as we approach this month of September that we are going into there are four things that we are going to be I guess reactivating in a certain sense I just want to put you on notice of it the exact dates will follow but Sunday school will begin once again in September the date will be announced officially we also looking to have one special youth service and fellowship in September as well so you want to put you on notice the date to be confirmed we also will be having the Lord's Supper in September so we'll let you know which service that will be and finally we'll be certainly looking to get some Bible studies in in September as well so be on notice you know we want to try to fit all these things in and and really sort of see how best we can help and put our shoulders to the wheel as it were so we can grow in every area of Our Lives but ernstein was so tremendous and speaking about God's concern as a father God's concerned in our well-being and when you read the message and you see how the prophet laid it out God is interested in every single aspect of your life not just your spiritual work but every aspect he's interested in your marriage he's interested in your business he's interested in your job he's interested in how you get to work he's interested in your happiness he's interested in your well-being he's interested in your mental state God is concerned as a father about every single aspect of your life and the challenge for us is how much are we willing to surrender to that leadership that brother Anthony spoke about because where he leads us once we follow then everything falls into place he said seek first the kingdom and his righteousness and every other thing that you ever could ever desire will just fall in place because you're under leadership God help us to come on the leadership of the Holy Ghost not leadership of a influence on social media or family member or a neighbor or relative or something you read any newspaper that's leading you here because they're only two influences you've been influenced from above or From Below but the leadership of the Holy Spirit would always take you into the right place you can never go wrong surrendering yourself to the leadership of the Holy Ghost never ever ever ever go wrong but there are a million ways to go around with all of the other voices that are being driven by that architect in Hell who is designing and redesigning ways to attract people into his world but God has only one way it's true that blood through that blood through that blood and through that baptism of the Holy Ghost That by one Spirit we are baptized into that mystical body can the church say Amen anybody love the Lord we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth every single day come what me how's it going all is well I lost my job how's it going all is well because you know where your source is you know where your strength comes from and you know that God is leading you [Music] finally maintenance group three please meet with brother Anthony Henry after the service and next week Lord willing group five for the Blackman's group is carded to clean may the Lord [Music]
