[9:14] amen God bless you so this evening we

[9:22] amen so you amen take be a part of the
[9:25] the word amen by by the grace of God God
[9:28] bless you amen
[9:30] and then maybe speak on the word just
[9:33] for a few moments in my own oldfashioned
[9:36] sass R way of doing it and so uh over in
[9:40] Hebrews the 10th chapter and the 19th
[9:42] verse we read this having therefore
[9:47] Brethren boldness to enter into the
[9:50] holiest by the blood of
[9:54] Jesus let's ask our lord to bless his
[9:57] word father we are so grateful to have
[10:01] the word for Faith cometh by hearing the
[10:05] word and we as your servants today as
[10:09] men and women sitting here coming out of
[10:13] the field to refresh ourselves in this
[10:17] convention we pray heavenly father that
[10:19] you'll come to us again this afternoon
[10:21] as thou has always done for you promised
[10:24] you would and would bless us together
[10:28] today and let Thy word find its resting
[10:31] place in every heart for we ask it in
[10:34] Jesus name
[10:37] amen I would thought maybe just knowing
[10:41] last evening and never prepare anything
[10:44] because it's usually something else when
[10:46] I get there but just happen to think on
[10:48] this having boldness to enter into the
[10:51] holiest of holiest by the blood of Jesus
[10:56] Christ I thought we might take a little
[10:58] text to say afternoon for a few moments
[11:01] on a hidden
[11:03] life now most all of us are in these
[11:06] conventions and so forth to try to find
[11:08] out how to have a closer walk with God
[11:12] I'm sure that's your brother's uh uh I
[11:15] um way this afternoon I I was thinking
[11:20] maybe I'd talk about the Supernatural
[11:24] and I don't know how to approach that
[11:27] it's just as much mysterious is it is to
[11:30] you and um well then a hidden life with
[11:35] Christ some way that we could hide away
[11:38] and get away from all of it and live
[11:39] with
[11:41] Christ am I looking at Henry
[11:44] Gro God bless you brother Henry I
[11:46] haven't seen you for a long time and
[11:48] brother I just happen to look back and
[11:49] seen dad and recogniz him when I had my
[11:52] great breakdown or come off the field
[11:56] for about 8 months they were real
[11:58] brother and daddy to me they stayed
[12:00] right with me all the time I know we'll
[12:02] forget the day that brother Grill up
[12:04] there we went out in the cornfield to
[12:05] pray I was so nervous I stayed in the
[12:08] vision so long I couldn't tell whether
[12:10] it was in or out I never will forget
[12:12] brother gr when he knelt down to pray
[12:14] with me put his arms around me just
[12:16] simple like said now Papa God will you
[12:20] come help brother Brandon Papa God will
[12:23] you come help brother
[12:25] Brandon that's always stay with me
[12:27] brother Co
[12:31] oh what will it be brother gr someday I
[12:33] hope I have my arm around you sit down
[12:36] with the evergreen trees where The
[12:37] Fountains of the Waters of life is
[12:39] Flowing from another Throne we have be
[12:42] in the presence of our Papa God then
[12:44] forever and forever to live in his
[12:48] presence now God has made it so
[12:53] simple and of the Bible and to make the
[12:57] gospel so simple to even a person like
[13:01] myself that's
[13:03] uneducated uh would have an opportunity
[13:06] to
[13:07] speak uh and preach the
[13:10] gospel and uh I was saying to the
[13:13] Brethren coming over how funny I feel to
[13:16] get up there today and know that before
[13:19] Scholars and some of the smartest men in
[13:21] the country sitting here and how my
[13:23] grammar how poor it is and how all
[13:28] unqualified but but you
[13:30] know probably you all feel this like I
[13:33] do if you had to set before some Bishops
[13:35] and so forth but you know Brethren God
[13:38] doesn't dwell so much in theology he
[13:41] dwells in love and humbleness where you
[13:45] can really everybody can get acquainted
[13:47] with him and know him I'm so glad that
[13:49] he's he hasn't selected just a little
[13:52] handful or certain
[13:54] denomination he said whosoever
[13:57] will and so that even gives me and you a
[14:00] chance to come in and have fellowship
[14:03] and speak of
[14:05] him now God has made it so wonderful
[14:08] that in the Old Testament he where
[14:11] usually I go to for refuge for a text
[14:14] once in a while he's made the Old
[14:16] Testament in
[14:18] Parables and in symbolic forms to
[14:22] express itself and his doings that the
[14:26] simple-minded might be able to have a
[14:29] conception of his will and what he's
[14:31] done many times in the Old Testament how
[14:35] I have went back to find the old typing
[14:38] the new always God did in what he's
[14:42] doing now in the New Testament he
[14:45] foreshadowed it in the Old Testament and
[14:48] all of those who neglected God and
[14:50] forsaken God in the Old Testament we can
[14:53] see by example what become of them and
[14:56] those who Dar to have faith in Jehovah
[14:59] and stepped out in the Old Testament we
[15:01] see what happened to them now we make
[15:04] our choice that's right and we are thank
[15:08] God for a free nation and a place of
[15:12] worship to where we each one can set our
[15:16] sails in the faith of God and fly away
[15:19] from this Earth I'm glad of that today
[15:21] for there's plenty places you couldn't
[15:23] do
[15:24] that now for instance in the Old
[15:26] Testament how God gave all of his
[15:29] uh Parables back there and set forth his
[15:32] his um things that would be a shadow of
[15:36] today then that's the only way that I
[15:38] can teach the Bible they talk about Big
[15:41] Greek words and so forth they just tie
[15:43] me in all kinds of places but if I look
[15:47] back and see what God did back there as
[15:49] a foreshadow then I have some general
[15:52] conception of what he's doing today
[15:54] because that was a shadow if I'm going
[15:57] to the
[15:59] uh to the west and my Sun's rising in
[16:02] the East and My Shadow is before me and
[16:05] if I never seen myself or never know
[16:07] what I look like or a human being I'd
[16:09] have some conception of my form when I
[16:12] seem a shadow and the old testment is
[16:15] the shadow of the coming of Christ and
[16:18] everything foreshadowed the cross and in
[16:22] Christ all God's Redemption all these
[16:26] plans all the Plan of Salvation
[16:29] all was met at
[16:32] Calvary now how beautiful in the Old
[16:35] Testament how God foreshadowed this holy
[16:37] spirit that we're enjoying
[16:39] today how that he foreshadow the order
[16:41] and these conventions and how we could
[16:43] come together in
[16:45] fellowship and have a a fellowship
[16:49] together back there we see how in the
[16:53] early beginning of the of the church
[16:57] that how that God Force shattered the
[16:59] place today where I think Brethren that
[17:01] we're entering now for this next
[17:05] blessing everyone knows that we're just
[17:10] on a bar Tim like the great blessing of
[17:14] Divine Healing and the powers of the
[17:17] supernatural it's gone out that's
[17:19] brought about a Revival that's actually
[17:22] shucked the world the hardest that's
[17:24] ever been shucked in all the all the
[17:26] time there has never been time in any
[17:29] age that Christianity shuck the entire
[17:32] world like it has in the last five or
[17:34] six
[17:34] years right and every nation under ever
[17:38] Place through radio through by
[17:40] evangelist by uh we go into a place in
[17:44] different countries where they don't
[17:45] believe in God and there they find where
[17:48] the ordinary missionary had passed out
[17:50] some tracks which is fine but when they
[17:52] see the operation of the supernatural
[17:54] tens of thousands of heathen fall at the
[17:57] cross
[17:59] and serve the Lord Jesus it's been a
[18:01] mighty move now we've held this ground
[18:05] so long and I believe with all my heart
[18:08] that we're on the threshold of stepping
[18:10] into another Veil y somewhere the were
[18:14] the greater mysteries of God will be
[18:16] known to the church and me for one I've
[18:19] got both ears and eyes and heart open to
[18:22] hear the message when it
[18:24] comes examine it for Satan will put out
[18:26] on many a false Runner but just lay it
[18:29] aside remember it's only signifying that
[18:31] something real is going to take place
[18:33] when you see it for Satan will do
[18:35] everything as I said last night to
[18:37] blockade the real Jewel of God when it's
[18:40] coming forth you'll you'll hear it he
[18:44] put out a blockade to catch Abel he put
[18:46] out one to catch Joseph one to catch
[18:48] Jesus and so forth and he'll do it one
[18:52] to get Moses for you can notice those
[18:55] things that Satan will try to block it
[18:58] and now for I believe that the many
[19:00] Cults and things as we see rising over
[19:02] the nation is only a light post to say
[19:05] look out it will be here
[19:07] soon I've noticed among our
[19:10] Brethren that many of you as coming into
[19:12] to you as Full Gospel people coming from
[19:14] the Baptist Church myself and accepting
[19:17] the doctrine of the baptism of the holy
[19:20] spirit being a separate uh work of the
[19:24] Holy
[19:26] Spirit and I thought then when we when
[19:30] the Martin Luther reached justification
[19:33] by faith he thought that settled it that
[19:35] was a light for his day and he preached
[19:38] it and believed it and held on to it and
[19:40] it was the light of that day then he
[19:44] entered another Veil a man John Wesley
[19:46] when Calvinism begin to sweep the nation
[19:48] and it settle down to saying what God's
[19:51] going to do he'll do and does is no good
[19:52] to have a Revival God raised up John
[19:55] Wesley and he certainly smashed
[19:57] Calvinism to the ground
[19:59] to the place where it ought to have its
[20:01] right bounds Under The Works of
[20:05] sanctification the second work of
[20:08] Grace nazarenes carried it on and Along
[20:10] come the Pentecostal then next in the
[20:13] baptism of the Holy Spirit moving on up
[20:16] into the higher Heights and now when the
[20:20] Brethren received the baptism of the
[20:21] Holy Ghost they said this is the summit
[20:24] this is all of it but Brethren that's
[20:26] wrong
[20:29] there is no Summit to God's power we
[20:32] move on and on and on it's the
[20:35] unlimited resources of God has never
[20:38] been tapped yet blessings and powers
[20:41] that we know nothing about has never
[20:43] been even revealed to Arch Angels is
[20:45] laying just ahead for his church that
[20:47] will
[20:49] believe for Eye Has Not Seen ear is not
[20:52] heard either has it enter the hearts of
[20:54] men what God has for them is story that
[20:55] love him so let's move up and claim name
[20:58] our rights as God opens the gates and
[21:00] swings out the welcome that let's move
[21:03] on up into deeper depths and never
[21:05] colonize ourselves to organize ourselves
[21:08] and to get into a place where this is we
[21:10] believe this and that's all let's
[21:12] believe this plus how much more we can
[21:14] hear from
[21:15] God I think that ought to be the motive
[21:17] of every man and woman that loves the
[21:19] Lord Jesus they'll receive all that you
[21:22] can from the hand of his Bountiful
[21:25] mercies ah it's my heart that's the
[21:28] reason I never JN any organization or
[21:30] tuck sides with any groups because I
[21:32] wanted myself wide open for the love of
[21:35] God and for what he could give to
[21:38] me I noticed in the Bible one time
[21:41] assembly as we're Church of God we are
[21:43] to be alone in that quiet Stillness with
[21:48] God don't you believe
[21:51] it certainly we ought to be notice when
[21:55] the high priest once the year entered in
[21:58] the first Veil then the second
[22:01] Veil on the outside of the levers where
[22:04] they wash the sacrifice then the
[22:05] sacrifice was killed put on the brazing
[22:08] Altar and the
[22:10] blood was put in a
[22:13] charger and the high priest once the
[22:16] year walked in behind the
[22:18] veil to make an atonement and notice of
[22:22] dressing of this high priest before he
[22:24] could enter the veil he had to be
[22:27] stripped and dressed right to go
[22:30] in that's what the church is today what
[22:33] it needs is a stripping off of all these
[22:35] little Cults and things and dressed in
[22:38] the righteousness of Jesus Christ and
[22:40] ready to enter
[22:42] [Music]
[22:43] in Hallelujah his walk must be different
[22:47] every along the hymns of His Garment he
[22:50] had a pomegranate and then a bell and as
[22:53] he walked his walk was so perfect until
[22:57] the bells played holy holy holy unto the
[23:01] Lord what we need today is not whether
[23:04] we are assemblies or Church of God or
[23:06] oness or whatever it might be our walk
[23:09] ought to be playing to the public holy
[23:12] holy holy unto the
[23:14] [Applause]
[23:16] Lord another thing he must be anointed
[23:20] before he goes
[23:21] in the anointing oil was made with the
[23:24] rose of
[23:25] Sharon and the crushing of the Rose
[23:27] brought forth the perfume and they put
[23:29] it on the or it run on Aaron's beard
[23:32] Plum to the hems of his skirt covered
[23:35] all over with the anointing or walking
[23:39] right living right moving right dressed
[23:43] right there he went taking before him
[23:46] the blood and as he went behind the
[23:50] curtain into the third room there was a
[23:53] veil that dropped behind him that the
[23:56] outside world could not see him no more
[23:58] more and every man or boy or woman or
[24:02] girl that ever is Anointed of God and
[24:05] Walks Behind that Temple the veil of God
[24:08] the Holy Ghost puts him in a secret
[24:11] place the veil drops behind him and the
[24:15] world and all of its things are cut off
[24:17] behind him that's the reason Brethren
[24:20] that we're holding up the adoption of
[24:22] God is our difference of life and
[24:24] fussing and quarreling amongst one
[24:25] another is a reason the veil can't drop
[24:27] behind us and we can go into that
[24:29] presence of God that's right we're so
[24:33] interested in our denominations we're so
[24:35] interested in what the next fell what's
[24:37] what is that to thee follow thou
[24:41] me it's an individual Affair between
[24:44] every Minister how a minister ought to
[24:47] always get along to himself even before
[24:49] he preaches before he prays before he
[24:52] does anything he should get alone with
[24:54] God in that quiet place hid away with
[24:58] God
[24:59] go how that that Veil once coming
[25:03] down now the furniture in this inside
[25:08] this veil was different from the
[25:10] outside way back in the congregation the
[25:12] lever that washed the Beast and the next
[25:16] veil was what it was the um the burning
[25:20] of the beast's body and in there was the
[25:23] seven golden candlesticks on the that
[25:26] represented the lamp
[25:29] and give the light and out into the
[25:32] outer courts was sunlight in the first
[25:34] veil was artificial notice and when they
[25:39] walk in here by this lamp then they go
[25:42] into the next court which was the
[25:45] holiest of holies as they walked in
[25:48] their
[25:49] anointed how that God has so planted out
[25:52] it's such a beautiful thing for us as we
[25:55] see the great plan there of God's
[25:58] Eternal
[25:59] salvation how that his ministers should
[26:02] walk in this how they should prepare
[26:04] themselves to enter into this now on the
[26:07] inside of this ENT Court the called the
[26:10] holiest of holies there was a piece of
[26:12] furniture sitting there called The Mercy
[26:15] Seat and the Covenant was in the ark and
[26:19] the Ark had two
[26:21] cherubin and it was on the inside that
[26:25] was a Furniture inside of the Holy place
[26:28] next coming out was the golden
[26:29] candlesticks then on out to the
[26:32] Laver now perfectly represents the age
[26:35] of Luther Wesley and Pentecost exactly
[26:40] the three steps are dispensations of his
[26:43] grace that's been given to Mankind we
[26:45] are in the last dispensation I believe
[26:49] that with all my heart see now
[26:52] notice then also in this great move how
[26:56] God brought them in there in this great
[27:00] uh Place Moses one time was told by God
[27:05] when the Mana Begin to Fall the Mana was
[27:07] a type of Life Christ coming down from
[27:12] heaven and perishing here on Earth that
[27:14] he might give us life the Mana Came From
[27:17] Heaven laid on the earth and the people
[27:19] eat it to sustain life Christ came down
[27:23] from heaven and become Mana that we
[27:27] might live
[27:29] by
[27:29] him and notice now the people eating the
[27:33] Mana they had to get it quickly and eat
[27:36] it because when the sun rose it wasn't
[27:40] long till it was perished the type there
[27:44] of Christ the Holy Spirit the Mana was a
[27:48] type of the Holy Ghost today as God
[27:51] brought the church in natural with
[27:53] natural manner he's bringing the church
[27:55] today spiritual on spiritual manner one
[27:58] the church had first overcome come over
[28:00] the Red Sea type of the blood passed
[28:03] over into the journey on the road to the
[28:05] promised land Mana rain the first
[28:07] night amen and when the church was
[28:11] passed over from Life unto death on the
[28:14] day of Pentecost God reigned the
[28:17] spiritual Mana Out of Heaven that
[28:19] sustained the church until Jesus comes
[28:22] again or we pass into the Millennium
[28:24] into the promised
[28:25] land amen
[28:28] oh when they picked it up and they would
[28:31] eat it they said it was sweet it tastes
[28:33] like Honey in the Rock they said tastes
[28:36] like honey David Called It Honey in the
[28:39] Rock and that's what it is now notice a
[28:43] tip the Mana never did cease to fall
[28:47] until the day they entered the promised
[28:50] land for 40 years the same Mana fell
[28:53] every day
[28:55] hallelujah how are you going to take the
[28:58] Holy Ghost and leave it at Pentecost
[29:00] brother it's been one continually
[29:01] Pentecost that cause the hardness of
[29:04] man's heart to fail to eat the Mana
[29:06] that's right notice that it was a tipe
[29:12] now on the day of Pentecost when our
[29:14] Mana as soon as the people had went into
[29:18] the upper room and obeyed the
[29:19] Commandments of the Lord Jesus and
[29:21] carried waited at the city of Jerusalem
[29:24] for the going forth of the Holy Ghost
[29:26] the first time there came from the
[29:28] heaven a sound like a Russian Mighty
[29:30] Wind that filled all the house where
[29:32] they were setting clothing tongues set
[29:34] up on them like fire they were all
[29:36] filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to
[29:38] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[29:39] gave them utterance out into the streets
[29:42] they went a cowardly little bunch of
[29:44] preachers hid away in an upper
[29:48] room but all of a sudden there came the
[29:52] mana come pouring down to sustain their
[29:55] souls and out into the streets they went
[29:57] with an experience that they had never
[29:59] had
[30:00] before a beautiful type of God
[30:05] sustaining his church through this
[30:06] journey to the promised land notice
[30:09] Brethren then how long was this Mana to
[30:13] last it lasted the entire Journey until
[30:16] they hit into another dispensation over
[30:19] into the promised land how long is this
[30:22] to last until Jesus
[30:25] comes Peter said repent every one of you
[30:28] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[30:30] Christ for the remission of your sins
[30:32] and you shall receive the Holy Ghost for
[30:35] the promises into you and to your
[30:36] children and to them as far off even as
[30:38] many as the Lord Our God shall call how
[30:41] long was it to last as many as the Lord
[30:44] Our God shall call and as long as the
[30:47] dispensation of Grace last God will
[30:49] still call men and women to his
[30:52] service so the Holy Ghost is just as
[30:55] real today now he never said now when
[31:00] they eat this Mana
[31:03] remember if they eat it many people eat
[31:06] it and said this is it they had to
[31:09] gather it fresh every day that's right
[31:12] that's right they had to gather the man
[31:14] fresh every day because along about
[31:16] 9:00 on their second step it would go to
[31:20] Melton it would perish and many times
[31:23] people living in God's second room even
[31:26] in communion after they've already
[31:28] received the word and come into the
[31:31] second step of receiving Christ into
[31:33] their life and never yet know what that
[31:36] secret room is what that bedroom what
[31:38] that rest place is they eat the
[31:41] Mana but did you notice if they let it
[31:44] lay too long it finally melted out there
[31:50] was it perished away and I think a lot
[31:53] of people has had a lot of Campground
[31:56] cramps anyhow that when they go and eat
[31:59] of the Lord on the campground and before
[32:01] another revival can come along they're
[32:03] all back and twisted up in some kind of
[32:05] cult or something else what's the matter
[32:08] brother you've never walked in somewhere
[32:10] else God said Moses make you golden pot
[32:16] Hallelujah and in there place this mana
[32:19] and remember that a Believer when he
[32:22] walked in there that Mana never did run
[32:24] out it was always fresh and new and
[32:27] sweet as the days went by as the years
[32:29] went by and any man who comes to Christ
[32:32] and hides away in the veil falls behind
[32:34] him he's in the presence of almighty God
[32:37] eating the Mana day and night from one
[32:39] hour to the other it's always just as
[32:42] sweet as it was the first day fell into
[32:44] your soul Hallelujah that's what we need
[32:47] today is get in where the things are
[32:50] at not stand off and pretend or not
[32:53] stand off and act but actually get in
[32:55] there amen
[32:57] thank God the man once now remember only
[33:02] Believers only the elect comes into that
[33:05] that God has chosen you I believe in
[33:08] Revelations 2 said he that
[33:11] overcometh so it's promised to
[33:13] Overcomers you said oh I overcome
[33:15] smoking that ain't what he's talking
[33:17] about the whole lot more goes to this
[33:19] Christianity besides not smoking
[33:21] cigarettes or drinking
[33:23] whiskey he that
[33:26] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[33:28] he'll be my son I'll be his God and
[33:33] listen I will give him of the Hidden
[33:38] Mana
[33:40] hallelujah
[33:42] amen I'll hide him
[33:45] away and I'll give him the hidden things
[33:49] the world on the outside of the curtain
[33:50] don't know nothing about it
[33:55] Hallelujah though they eat man but they
[33:58] don't know about
[33:59] this I'll give to him the hidden Mana
[34:04] I'll give him a stone with his name in
[34:07] it you get what I mean entering in to
[34:12] the adoption are the hidden place with
[34:14] God Ministers of the Gospel don't care
[34:18] about your denominations and what the
[34:19] world thinks but seek to enter in to the
[34:23] hidden Mana hallu for the full
[34:26] revelation of God is made love perfect
[34:29] in your heart and you and God and
[34:31] everything else is at rest let anything
[34:34] come what may your hidden away what a
[34:37] place to
[34:38] live oh that's let me abide
[34:43] there as a song said let me rest neath
[34:47] the
[34:47] tree where the so freely flows where the
[34:51] lamb is the
[34:52] light and the soul of the saved never
[34:56] die amen
[34:58] sure they ate man out there but they
[35:00] didn't know about
[35:01] this they've never been in there have
[35:05] you my dear
[35:07] brother don't despise my ignorance but I
[35:10] want to ask you something Have you ever
[35:12] come to the place in life where Christ
[35:14] meant more to you and all the arguing
[35:16] you could do about your
[35:17] church has Christ meant more to you than
[35:20] all the world I don't mean from any
[35:23] emotional or mental workup I mean from
[35:25] the depths of your heart that something
[35:26] settled in there at something's taking
[35:29] place that you don't know how it come
[35:31] but you're hid away and your whole
[35:32] motive is to serve Jesus Christ have you
[35:36] entered that place my dear brother have
[35:38] you come into that place where you don't
[35:40] care what anyone says not to go out and
[35:43] act smart but the little love of God Is
[35:46] So anchored into you that you can't see
[35:48] nothing else your whole motive is to do
[35:51] the will of God love for everybody
[35:54] flowing free from
[35:56] everywh a place to
[35:59] live that's the hidden place that's the
[36:02] place where we got to come to my
[36:04] brethren that's a place where God
[36:06] Reveals His secret things that's a place
[36:09] where God does a placing in the calling
[36:12] you get what I
[36:13] mean in this same place we don't have
[36:16] much time cuz I got to hurry but just
[36:18] for another thought in this same place
[36:21] they put Aaron's
[36:25] Rod to make a decision who God had
[36:28] chosen who he
[36:30] hadn't and that
[36:32] Rod that was a dead
[36:35] stick and one night's time come to life
[36:40] brought buds brought flowers and brought
[36:44] arms it both come to life brought
[36:48] blossoms and yielded
[36:51] fruits a very
[36:53] [Music]
[36:55] typical pattern
[36:58] of The
[36:59] Sinner being brought to God into the
[37:03] holy Place remember that Rod passed over
[37:06] every one of those other elements and it
[37:09] got inside the holy place still
[37:12] dead but to
[37:15] abide it never come to life when he
[37:17] brought first brought it in
[37:19] there that's the reason the holy
[37:21] spirit's watched you since you receive
[37:23] the Holy
[37:24] Ghost see your attitude towards his King
[37:28] Kingdom if it's been selfish motives if
[37:31] the things that you thought of is in
[37:33] farther denomination or if it's to in
[37:35] farther better you your position if to
[37:39] make you a man looked up to in the world
[37:41] if it's to build you a big church
[37:43] somewhere or some popularity or some
[37:46] other thing
[37:48] outside of increasing or EMB bettering
[37:51] the kingdom of God brother something's
[37:56] wrong amen
[37:59] now when that old dead Rod was brought
[38:02] in there and laid in the presence of God
[38:05] himself what happened it
[38:09] budded it
[38:11] blossomed and it yielded fruit
[38:15] right showing that we borned in that Rod
[38:20] was off of an alond
[38:22] tree and when it was cut off it died and
[38:26] when man was cut off from God he died
[38:30] spiritually but once brought into the
[38:34] place of God before the presence of God
[38:38] he comes to
[38:40] life and he yields life he yield
[38:44] blossoms he yields
[38:46] fruit Jesus come to the tree to look for
[38:49] fruit on it it had everything but fruit
[38:53] that's right and that's what's the
[38:54] matter with our churches today we got
[38:56] everything but fruit
[38:58] we can shout we can speak with tongues
[39:00] we can argue the scriptures we can teach
[39:03] our theology but when it comes to fruit
[39:05] bearing the tree is very
[39:08] lean what is the fruits of the spirit
[39:12] love joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[39:16] goodness patience
[39:19] that's it shows many is still
[39:23] outside on the first altar you're still
[39:27] open to the public you're still
[39:29] listening to hear what John's got to say
[39:31] about it what the neighbor will think or
[39:34] something for yourself but once behind
[39:37] the bail and the curtains has dropped
[39:39] you're hiding God to
[39:43] Christ
[39:45] see notice what a beautiful picture of
[39:48] the
[39:49] cner laying in the presence of God now
[39:53] this Rod laying there it was refreshed
[39:58] it was fragnant brought the fragrance of
[40:01] the Blossom and it yielded fruit the
[40:05] buds came forth now a beautiful type of
[40:09] that is given Earthly speaking the first
[40:12] thing that we have to do before we can
[40:14] have a crop we have to have
[40:17] seed and the seed placed in the ground
[40:20] will yield its fruits is that
[40:24] right now the first thing we have to do
[40:26] is to receive receive
[40:29] Christ now the tree had to be an almond
[40:32] tree to start
[40:34] with and Christ you have to receive him
[40:38] before you come into this
[40:40] place and then in the presence of
[40:44] this great God then these things take
[40:48] place what see the word Christ was the
[40:52] word in the beginning was the word and
[40:53] the word is with God and the Word was
[40:56] God
[40:57] Christ comes into the life of the human
[41:00] being now notice the first thing was a
[41:04] refreshment what makes a sea grow did
[41:07] you ever get up of a
[41:09] morning and find the Dew that's fell
[41:13] down from heaven and refreshes the Earth
[41:16] how does it refresh it when it's at
[41:20] peace the D don't fall in daytime the DW
[41:24] falls in the night time when everything
[41:27] is is at
[41:28] peace the D can never fall on you my
[41:31] brother as long as you're fussing and
[41:33] arguing and stewing about the things
[41:35] you're on this Earth get along with God
[41:39] and let the D Drops of Mercy P upon on
[41:42] you in the
[41:44] Stillness Precious Memories how they
[41:49] linger how they ever fill my
[41:52] soul in the Stillness of the midnight
[41:56] Secret Secrets
[41:58] unfold how that God can get his believer
[42:02] with the curtains dropped around him
[42:04] alone to
[42:05] himself he'll bring down a refreshing
[42:08] from Heavens that there's no other
[42:11] person or no other way in the world to
[42:14] ever know it only he that's laying there
[42:16] did you ever walk out of a morning that
[42:18] real fresh School
[42:21] feeling God has refreshed his Earth
[42:28] fragnant did you ever go into a rose
[42:32] garden down my place that got a lot of
[42:36] honeysuckles the honeysuckle don't smell
[42:38] much along In the Heat of the
[42:40] day but it's early of the morning when
[42:44] all the air has been
[42:47] purified then that Romeo of the
[42:52] honeysuckle let a man be out fussing
[42:55] fighting stewing
[42:57] and you'll never get much of a Roma from
[42:59] that of the Gospel but let him get alone
[43:02] one time in the Stillness of God every
[43:05] man that comes to the pulpit ought to
[43:07] dwell alone
[43:10] first then comes the
[43:13] fruits yielding forth its
[43:16] fruits every man that stays in the
[43:19] presence of God into this great secret
[43:21] place hid away will yield the fruits of
[43:25] righteousness peace love joy
[43:29] longsuffering goodness gentl
[43:31] patience don't fuss about these other
[43:33] things get that in your life and you'll
[43:37] never get it till you hide away with
[43:40] God into that land of
[43:43] adoption another thing we'll call your
[43:45] attention just before we
[43:47] close look at the
[43:51] light on the outside in the courts it
[43:54] was the fervent that Lit it up sunlight
[43:57] and so forth some days was cloudy some
[44:01] days the sun didn't shine at all some
[44:03] days it was
[44:05] dark now that's in the outer Court the
[44:08] next court was the lamp of God where the
[44:12] Justified stands and it was lit by human
[44:16] hands that's where we argue our
[44:19] denominations where we argue our
[44:21] differences split hairs and oh I don't
[44:23] believe in Divine Healing I don't
[44:24] believe them Visions come from God I
[44:26] don't believe this I don't believe that

[44:28] arguing because you're living yet you're
[44:31] eating Mana but you're living under
[44:34] artificial
[44:35] light that's right sometimes the lights
[44:38] goes out sometimes your lamp gets smoked
[44:42] up but to he who desires to hide away
[44:48] walk into the next place there's no
[44:50] artificial life
[44:52] anywhere but down in between the arch of
[44:55] the wings of these Chans was a
[44:57] supernatural light hanging in there

[58:44] 23 for I have received of the Lord that
[58:48] which also I delivered unto you that the
[58:51] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[58:54] was betrayed took
[58:57] bread and when he had given thanks he
[58:59] broke it and said take eat this is my
[59:03] body which is broken for you this do in
[59:07] remembrance of
[59:08] me after the same manner also he took
[59:11] the cup when he had stopped saying this
[59:15] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[59:17] this do ye as often as he drink it in
[59:20] remembrance of me for as often as he eat
[59:24] this bread and drink this cup ye do ye
[59:27] do show the Lord's death till he comes
[59:30] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[59:34] and drink this cup of the Lord
[59:35] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[59:38] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[59:41] examine himself and so let him eat of
[59:44] that bread and drink of that cup for he
