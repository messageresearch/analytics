[48:54] talking about acts we're talking about
[48:56] the word being made manifest
[49:04] but mom read a scripture from
[49:06] Deuteronomy chapter 16 observe the month
[49:09] of added keep the Passover a month out
[49:12] of the Lord I got brought out of Egypt
[49:14] by night though shall therefore
[49:16] sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy
[49:18] God of the flux from the herd in the
[49:21] place where God has chosen to place his
[49:24] name there where I'm gonna teach that
[49:27] God will meet mane anyw anywhere
[49:29] he always choose the place he's the boss
[49:31] we can't choose the pace a lot meet me
[49:34] here yes
[49:34] no he choose the place I went to choose
[49:37] the base I'll meet you there he wanna
[49:38] meet you there so God choose the place
[49:41] and in that place I will put my name
[49:43] there and you know who his name is right
[49:45] his name is Jesus so he I will choose
[49:48] the place of my worship I'll put my name
[49:50] in it and that's the only place that God
[49:52] would ever meet anybody was by his own
[49:54] choosing
[49:55] isn't that right Deuteronomy mean two
[49:57] Lord's law of debt and the law of life
[50:00] to follow him and serve Him and worship
[50:03] Him his life to reject it is dead you

[54:14] not the only world so we just passing
[54:16] through
[54:17] I know some of you have to be nice to me
[54:18] because you see you're looking to stay
[54:20] but you have to prepare to leave
[54:23] praise God something you only preparing
[54:25] to stay but you have to understand in
[54:27] your preparation and living you have to
[54:30] prepare to leave because we have to
[54:33] leave hallelujah some living in the
[54:36] rapture some leave into the grave and
[54:37] some leave into the deck in the
[54:39] tribulation period but you have to leave
[54:41] anyhow Oh glory to God hallelujah
[54:45] hallelujah
[54:46] you take praise and honor jumping he's
[54:48] leaving he still feels oh you think
[54:51] President Putin things he'll even you
[54:52] think all and premise anyone in a
[54:54] thinking that they thinking no I'm in
[54:56] power and the only see in short distance
[54:58] I'm poor forever but you don't
[55:00] understand is God put them there I went
[55:03] all right to pull the plug he pulled it
[55:04] over for them you're gonna cut them off
[55:06] here and cut them off there so I know
[55:08] what ok the devil after you did ever
[55:09] doing this devil you nut but if God want
[55:11] he could just cut it off but it's the
[55:13] part that you have to play to apply his
[55:15] word to apply that blood so here we go
[55:19] God choose to meet man not in a church
[55:22] not in a denomination not in a creeper
[55:26] tin Christ that's the only place that
[55:29] God meets a man and he can worship God
[55:32] is in Christ no matter if you are
[55:34] Methodist Catholic protester whatever
[55:36] you might be there's only one place that
[55:38] you can correctly worship God as in
[55:40] Christ and it gives descriptive elements
[55:42] each one there's no condemnation to them
[55:45] that are in Christ Jesus that walk not
[55:51] after the flesh but after the spirit
[55:53] because data the after the flesh cannot
[55:55] please God so you are challenged to walk
[55:58] in the spirit
[56:00] so if you walk in the spirit the other
[56:02] reader writings you have to listen to
[56:04] the right things you have to look at the
[56:06] right things you have to get the right
[56:08] friends and the right environment
[56:10] because you want to walk in the spirit
[56:11] you have to fight what is trying to pull
[56:14] you down to the flesh because you were
[56:16] born in sin to have a natural magnetism
[56:18] to what this world so the spirit come to
[56:20] give you a higher law to bring you above
[56:23] the world system and once you break
[56:26] through to get above the world system
[56:28] you recognize you are power to walk you
[56:31] hell and not be touched by hell yeah or
[56:35] give the Lord some praise this people a
[56:39] [Applause]
[56:40] man called me little long ago in boomin
[56:43] Texas a mr. Brannon this is if your name
[56:47] is not an oil change book you cannot go
[56:52] to him that's a pool the first man
[56:57] that's a big one that's not like Saban
[57:02] sake would you ever think of that
[57:03] don't you believe such a thing as that
[57:05] do you think you have to belong to that
[57:08] certain group or you cannot go to heaven
[57:11] that's wrong
[57:12] listen it is to believe that is
[57:15] Antichrist and I will say this if you
[57:18] believe such a spirit you are lost even
[57:23] wrong deeper that's a good thing you are
[57:24] lost because it's taken away from what
[57:27] God said God never put his name in any
[57:29] Church
[57:31] do you get it now so anybody said yeah
[57:35] yeah no here
[57:38] [Applause]
[57:41] no we call it all right dog yeah say it
[57:46] out loud
[57:47] liars Jesus let every man will be alive
[57:52] I will be true all right all right so we
[57:56] get known as something now so he put it
[57:57] in his son Christ Jesus when he and his
[58:00] son became one that's a genuine place of
[58:03] worship no other foundation was laid not
[58:06] a rock the lamb was a type of Christ for
[58:09] Shadrach Christ because he was the Lamb
[58:10] of God John introduces that takes away
[58:12] the sin of the world we find Jesus
[58:14] coming at the view XS the 12th chapter
[58:16] and he's breaking it down now and
[58:18] switching it back to strip each other
[58:20] really notice it is the only place that
[58:26] could not strike when death was about to
[58:30] strike the land they had to be a certain
[58:33] place all from under this died only one
[58:36] place it didn't mean it was one house
[58:38] but it was one place that's where the
[58:41] lamb was killed where the lamb blood was
[58:44] that that angel could not strike because
[58:47] it was the one place that God put his
[58:49] name and that lamb was named back there
[58:52] a lamb it was in one place he could not
[58:54] strike and no today is the same there is
[58:58] one place that spiritual death cannot
[59:01] strike and that's the word that can
[59:06] strike the word because it's the Living
[59:10] Word of God get rest right every
[59:12] interpretation every man's idea every
[59:15] false prophecy every false prophet but
[59:18] death cannot strike the Word of God
[59:20] that's right the bride becomes the word
[59:22] what you want to know is if it's a word
[59:25] or not you don't want to know what this
[59:27] one doing or that one doing you want to
[59:29] know what is the world
[59:30] what does the word said what about my
[59:33] attitude what does the word say I want
[59:36] you in the world the devil can watch for
[59:38] the Yap touch you have to get permission
[59:40] to do anything with you
[59:42] oh give the Lord some praises do you
[59:45] understand that we have confidence in
[59:47] God who is the word who wants to meet
[59:51] you become the word and I say receive
[59:53] the world you become the word and as a
[59:56] receiver when you receive the anointing
[59:57] with the word the world after tough was
[1:00:00] verse then the anointing come behind the
[1:00:02] word if you receive this well this
[1:00:05] morning we will receive the anointing
[1:00:07] that is behind the word think about that
[1:00:11] the word is of this God
[1:00:13] [Applause]
[1:00:21] notice the decision was not forbidden to
[1:00:24] strike Egypt's great intellectual people
[1:00:26] it wasn't forbidden to strike the secret
[1:00:28] lands its grease building these Pharaohs
[1:00:30] the priests of the land the engine was
[1:00:32] not forbidden to strike it was like any
[1:00:34] building any place anybody but it could
[1:00:36] not strike where the lamb was where that
[1:00:39] blood was applied strike
[1:00:42] wherever's feet on virtual where there
[1:00:44] is knowledge and temperance where it
[1:00:46] stations and coordinates where the blood
[1:00:48] of the lamb is printed upon a people
[1:00:49] when I see the blood I'm gonna pass over
[1:00:53] you it has to be a flag hallelujah you
[1:00:57] have to be operational for this display
[1:01:00] of the token because you have to see
[1:01:02] something not when your mother see not
[1:01:05] when your wife see when I see when God
[1:01:09] you have to see something you're not
[1:01:12] here to impress the pasta nothing P

[1:01:16] the will of God and the program of God

[1:01:33] about the fear hidden the camp do you
[1:01:35] know what you have to go and get this
[1:01:36] round think about where and talk about a
[1:01:39] priests say you know what I asked you to
[1:01:41] get Islam
[1:01:41] I am a long-standing priests he died
[1:01:46] Joshua died some people have all kind of
[1:01:49] cuckoo attitudes and trainer is so
[1:01:50] disrespectful that's why some things
[1:01:53] were jumping because I'm not gonna that
[1:01:56] disrespect I'm gonna fight it with all I
[1:01:57] got
[1:01:58] go bring a designer here because smokey
[1:02:01] oh is that disrespectful please country
[1:02:05] that's right so when Moses give that
[1:02:08] instructions it's a fighter priests
[1:02:10] whoever it doesn't matter who that was
[1:02:14] not Moses instructions that was court
[1:02:16] gave Moses words because Moses got back
[1:02:19] this is your family oh no no family no
[1:02:24] family take the blood apply it I don't
[1:02:28] care you're just painted white the day
[1:02:31] before is Moses come and said take blood
[1:02:34] dick and splash it up opposed doorpost
[1:02:39] put it because everybody fanatic look
[1:02:43] like that blood on it all the laughing
[1:02:46] let angelicum yet but the blood is on
[1:02:49] display
[1:02:51] [Applause]
[1:02:54] dynamics that come yet because when
[1:02:57] dynamics come they're coming onshore
[1:03:00] [Music]
[1:03:02] everybody I know it's dynamic spring on
[1:03:05] every seed that's inside your system so
[1:03:08] be careful be careful that you're not
[1:03:13] hearing you think a hearing for my money
[1:03:14] here on board be careful that cannot
[1:03:22] strike where this provided place of God
[1:03:26] is that is in the lam church what a
[1:03:30] brown speaker wherever you are
[1:03:32] what you belong to makes me no
[1:03:34] difference but one thing you must know
[1:03:37] you must be in Christ or you're dead in
[1:03:45] the Old Testament was dead to go in now
[1:03:48] is dead to steal you have to be in
[1:03:51] presence I would have money house and
[1:03:54] home and job and and the street to get
[1:03:56] you out of the atmosphere out of the
[1:03:59] atmosphere that's what it ever was he's
[1:04:00] shamming you to shake your the
[1:04:02] atmosphere but if you could hold steady
[1:04:05] maintain the atmosphere the devil
[1:04:08] laughter regroup and rethink and
[1:04:10] restructure guys hope to try to get you
[1:04:13] on track because once again all the
[1:04:15] atmosphere you will say things and do
[1:04:17] things outside the program of God but if
[1:04:20] you stay that's why David said I have
[1:04:22] the right of the Lord the right hand
[1:04:23] rose before me I shall not be moved
[1:04:25] keep the Lord in his thoughts keep the
[1:04:27] Lord in his thinking keep him right
[1:04:29] before you and they're gonna go right
[1:04:31] because you want to follow the leading
[1:04:32] of the Lord and that's why I said all
[1:04:34] tied together with humility you have to
[1:04:37] be able to humble yourself yes some
[1:04:39] people don't like to be corrected you
[1:04:41] like to be spoken to yes some people
[1:04:42] don't accept blame for nothing they will
[1:04:46] never hear these words I accept
[1:04:49] responsibility for this know me then who
[1:04:56] who stole the cookie from the cookie jar
[1:04:59] and always somebody else my friends we
[1:05:03] have to come to terms with who we are
[1:05:06] who we are because Jesus learnt look
[1:05:10] like I would not learnt obedience by the
[1:05:13] things he suffered but he humbled
[1:05:17] himself and became obedient Oh glory to
[1:05:21] God you have to humble himself to put
[1:05:25] himself in subjection to the Word of God
[1:05:30] this is the problem there are people who
[1:05:33] are what you call free thinkers because
[1:05:36] they could read and listen to what the
[1:05:38] prophecies they figure they have a free
[1:05:40] thought of opinion of whole thing's
[1:05:43] supposed to be what is supposedly said
[1:05:46] and taught they are free thinkers now
[1:05:49] the free thinkers is derailment when the
[1:05:52] woman cut the cord when you put the
[1:05:54] pattern on the Word of God
[1:05:56] the free thinkers is the remnant of that
[1:05:59] same code the wise virgins is the
[1:06:02] elective that is cut according to the
[1:06:05] program of God or do you hear me this
[1:06:08] morning don't be a free thinker
[1:06:13] same court
[1:06:17] that's right scrap and the karate woman
[1:06:21] is dropping in wrong makalah's cutlet
[1:06:23] kadai is not a dress it's faster the
[1:06:26] court but it's not the elected part that
[1:06:30] she goes so up and seal the job that's
[1:06:34] not that bad
[1:06:35] June the bride is the path cut off
[1:06:37] everything she appointed loses her going
[1:06:43] on do that is that right did you consult
[1:06:45] God did you ask the Lord and you're
[1:06:50] going down the road going down the road
[1:06:52] and there's some you brought under some
[1:06:53] donkey something to show you off or
[1:06:56] something like that
[1:06:57] because you didn't consult to God but to
[1:07:00] elect he will cut off what is not like
[1:07:04] him Oh glory to God I said cut off you
[1:07:11] ever get caught yet oh my

[1:33:45] spirit who spoke the world existence on
[1:33:47] the very earth you said none tonight was
[1:33:49] the Word of God materialized and a man
[1:33:51] that's born of that same spirit believes

[1:34:31] like that what was it spiritually minded
[1:34:33] by election knowing that the earthly
[1:34:36] thing doesn't please God he offered life
[1:34:38] and blood so KML was was reflecting back
[1:34:42] like it taught me which is the blood
[1:34:45] which is Calvary which is the cross he
[1:34:47] was reflecting that by bringing that
[1:34:49] lamb onslaught in the before God brother
[1:34:52] praise be to Jesus I want to skip down
[1:34:54] notice oh I'm gonna skip that dog I
[1:34:57] believe in the battle already goes I
[1:35:00] believe in the restoration of the gifts
[1:35:01] when Israel began to move there's a
[1:35:03] pillar of fire when the fire move Israel
[1:35:06] move with it if it was to lock in the
[1:35:08] morning it was father's not gonna even
[1:35:10] whatever is the priest song the trumpet
[1:35:13] and we when the pillar of fire is
[1:35:14] removed what do I follow it pillar of
[1:35:17] fire hallelujah
[1:35:19] so you can't move and you feel to move
[1:35:21] no the pillar of fire move it you fall
[1:35:22] in the pillar fire Oh glory to God are
[1:35:25] you at me now
[1:35:25] that fire was hid for a while to the
[1:35:27] dark ages and the first one solar pillar
[1:35:29] fire was Martin Luther he song the
[1:35:31] trumpet out of the Catholic Church you
[1:35:34] know what I'll create revival the next
[1:35:36] thing they got to organize in and they
[1:35:38] organize so tight until the pillar fire
[1:35:39] moving in
[1:35:40] so once the groups or churches or
[1:35:42] whatever or a nice Villa fire move out
[1:35:45] when drunk to England Wesley went on to
[1:35:48] Pentecost is not right the tentacles of
[1:35:50] people saw it a way they went right out
[1:35:52] under a pillow fight when Shelton and no
[1:35:54] I belong to the Assemblies I belong to
[1:35:56] this you're organized so tight God is
[1:35:58] moving the pillar fire I thought again I
[1:36:00] will restore restore what what was in
[1:36:04] the beginning or glory what we have to
[1:36:07] ask for that we have to demand that we
[1:36:09] have to want that what what what was in
[1:36:11] the beginning because courts and the
[1:36:13] prophets do not ask back to the faith of
[1:36:16] the fathers
[1:36:17] they had the faith in the beginning so
[1:36:20] we have the 1 pick up that faith and
[1:36:21] then tomorrow we can't go forward
[1:36:23] without work without picking up the
[1:36:25] faith and I say that signs in it that's
[1:36:28] it that that was raised that's it demons
[1:36:31] were cast off that fit the SEC was
[1:36:33] healed
[1:36:33] Oh Chloe now give the Lord a shout in
[1:36:35] the hood that's the faith
[1:36:42] whether we want to see that because one
[1:36:46] put and equality bonnet it I hear a
[1:36:48] round prefer this one and all these
[1:36:50] testimonies all that was in the profit
[1:36:52] but he's not talking about that he's
[1:36:55] talking about now Jesus Christ not the
[1:36:59] same yesterday only he's the same today
[1:37:02] if he's the same today he can heal he
[1:37:06] could seal he could deliver because
[1:37:08] they're free they can restore because
[1:37:10] he's the same yesterday today forever
[1:37:13] [Applause]

[1:40:42] hallelujah Oh My isn't that right the
[1:40:47] whole Bible is the revelation of God the
[1:40:51] whole church is built upon a revelation
[1:40:52] of God now if you understand that when I
[1:40:56] look to some man when you need to get
[1:40:59] revelation from God because revelation
[1:41:02] is revealing power and if you pray and
[1:41:04] ask God to reveal the word to you he's
[1:41:06] going to reveal it to you and that will
[1:41:09] give you inner strength I thought that

[1:41:22] this environment of kingship and print
[1:41:24] shop and throne and the day it opened up
[1:41:28] to him by revelation that was mud
[1:41:31] daubers his people and he ever zero

[1:41:38] Branham said when he looked on through
[1:41:40] that window he seemed a double when
[1:41:42] Moses look down to that same one no more
[1:41:45] they see the elect of God Oh hallelujah
[1:41:49] all the time Moses looking to graduate
[1:41:53] to be the next great great Prince of
[1:41:56] Egypt but when the revelation broke of
[1:41:58] who he is and who those people are he
[1:42:03] chose to be identified with them what
[1:42:06] the palace what god of riches what the
[1:42:09] power what are the physical and natural
[1:42:12] and worldly blessing was away from the
[1:42:14] woman the wine and the song to be
[1:42:17] identified with a bunch of fanatics

[1:55:10] eternal if he is some kind of agent of
[1:55:16] God is on the library blind I mean do
[1:55:23] you understand the wheels are turning to
[1:55:26] bring on the mark of the beast system
[1:55:28] under shutdown future do you understand
[1:55:30] the give them liberty know to prove
[1:55:32] joint political groups on what that and
[1:55:34] still keep the tax free on what in
[1:55:35] America the creeping in upon the
[1:55:38] churches do you even know them I think
[1:55:39] they get them more but do you understand
[1:55:41] the green diecut hijacked our
[1:55:43] constituents and who rests on the United
[1:55:46] Nations the do you understand that
[1:55:47] here we are because of of course on a
[1:55:50] profit to bring clarity of the vision of
[1:55:52] where we headed and spiritual death nor
[1:55:55] moving in a way yes
[1:55:57] and the Bible says that the ancient men
[1:55:59] were before my house goes bless and see
[1:56:03] you only those who sigh and cry
[1:56:05] something like to strike your spirit
[1:56:07] something had to touch your heart that
[1:56:09] you can get behind a bootie dozen Lord
[1:56:12] this can't be right this is not me this
[1:56:15] is what I want and desire I want more of
[1:56:18] you on the begin to hunger and tells the
[1:56:20] world walking behind you see it and
[1:56:22] watching it every move to see if you
[1:56:24] really believe what you're hearing that
[1:56:25] Devlin outside this kyle aachen he's
[1:56:28] looking at you
[1:56:29] because we want to see if you really
[1:56:31] believe if you truly believe I think tis
[1:56:34] they'll talk about a woman she was a
[1:56:36] housewife and the man came on some
[1:56:38] friends and they joined all the drinks
[1:56:40] and trained on the pizza and I think
[1:56:41] fall on the ground I would not buy what
[1:56:43] early woman this humming nicely and
[1:56:45] sweetly and mopping up what a mess the
[1:56:47] making and everything else cleaned up
[1:56:48] and nice Christian behavior and whatnot
[1:56:50] and if I any husband telling the
[1:56:53] Christian she's a Christian know what is
[1:56:58] afterwards doing the carrying on no she
[1:57:00] felt up ruling pin on the head I said
[1:57:03] get off my house and we ever bring them
[1:57:05] in back in my home sack kill them a
[1:57:07] rascal friends they bring a what a manga
[1:57:10] see a torch she was a Christian so so so
[1:57:17] the thing about you know when the test
[1:57:19] comes on it has to bring out a display
[1:57:22] it has to bring out something that you
[1:57:25] have on the inside has to come out on
[1:57:28] the outside and going to bring the test
[1:57:31] so it comes out automatically if you
[1:57:33] have angered it it's fit so you have
[1:57:35] tempered it it comes out - it would have
[1:57:37] hurt you that it comes out it's our
[1:57:38] faith and courage
[1:57:39] it comes out enough kindness it comes at
[1:57:41] all so you have to choose to be kind you
[1:57:44] have to choose to be loving to be
[1:57:45] careful to be caring you have to choose
[1:57:47] that and and listen deny the excuses
[1:57:50] where my boss make me do this maybe I
[1:57:53] can let me do this what you deny all of
[1:57:55] that shake all that off and accept
[1:57:57] responsibility for your actions
[1:57:59] oh my could we take some more Wow yuck

[2:11:01] then that was the state he was in when
[2:11:04] he met Abraham he was calm as Jesse dick
[2:11:08] he was in the form of a theophany after
[2:11:11] often is something you could not see it
[2:11:13] could be right here no yes you cannot
[2:11:15] see it like television which is another
[2:11:19] dimension people are moving right along
[2:11:21] to this room right now
[2:11:22] singing colors but the eye is only
[2:11:24] subject in five senses your whole being
[2:11:27] is submitted five senses television
[2:11:29] doesn't manufacture a picture a
[2:11:30] television channels it into a circuit
[2:11:33] and the television screen picks it up
[2:11:35] and the picture is yet to begin with
[2:11:36] television was here when Adam was here
[2:11:39] television was here when he Leiter was
[2:11:41] an on camera television was here when
[2:11:43] she has a Nazareth Walker shot of
[2:11:44] Galilee but your know discovering it
[2:11:46] they wouldn't have believed it back
[2:11:48] there you've been crazy to sell
[2:11:49] something like it but now it becomes a
[2:11:51] reality so he reveals himself in his
[2:11:56] great form of what he claimed as he and
[2:11:58] Morpheus himself into his sylvans and
[2:12:00] proves himself he has their morphe
[2:12:04] himself into his servants and proves
[2:12:06] himself now he is in the form of spirit
[2:12:11] and then he comes and he appeared to
[2:12:14] Abram and morphe and when Abram returned
[2:12:17] to the stall of the Kings here come
[2:12:18] mezack talk to him no we see here we go
[2:12:21] this is important right let me know
[2:12:25] we see are you ready the attribute sons
[2:12:30] of his spirit have not yet entered into
[2:12:33] this word form body you attribute sons
[2:12:41] have not yet entered into your word
[2:12:44] buddy
[2:12:45] if this tablet can be resolved we have
[2:12:48] another body waiting for us Oh
[2:12:51] hallelujah if this fish tamatha be
[2:12:54] resolved the one in the box is not the
[2:12:56] body we don't move on already
[2:12:58] hallelujah are you at me so we see a T
[2:13:03] often in this body is subject to the
[2:13:05] wood and illness waiting for the change
[2:13:08] of the body now the difference between
[2:13:10] him and you as a son he was at the
[2:13:13] beginning the width and in Morphy buddy
[2:13:16] he came and lived in that person
[2:13:19] Melchizedek then later we never heard
[2:13:22] what matches the deck because he became
[2:13:23] Jesus Christ Myrcella was a priest and
[2:13:27] he became Jesus Christ but you bypassed
[2:13:30] that because in that form
[2:13:33] he knows all things you have never been
[2:13:35] able to know that yet you come like Adam
[2:13:38] like me you came from attribute the
[2:13:42] flesh to be tempted
[2:13:47] taught the flesh to be tempted
[2:13:52] so temptation is legitimate like the
[2:14:00] minds blown

[2:18:07] finishes there are no shortcuts you are
[2:18:11] disqualified at the end of the race no
[2:18:14] shortcuts
[2:18:15] oh my hallelujah some time I was readin
[2:18:20] over mom's any reason that the people
[2:18:23] looked so much to the preacher in that
[2:18:25] kind of a way is because the people
[2:18:27] don't want to surrender to God so really
[2:18:29] what they want is a priest that minister
[2:18:32] intent on their behalf that is what they
[2:18:35] want so they love the personal love this
[2:18:37] man and they're behind the man in the
[2:18:39] balcony manages God feel caught in flesh
[2:18:41] not God in them you know going in mind
[2:18:43] an evil but if you couldn't in the word
[2:18:46] what Ron said cortázar go to the
[2:18:48] audience I'm in the beginning in the
[2:18:51] early church goers among the people and
[2:18:53] they get caught from the people and put
[2:18:55] it in a man and that's how we end up a
[2:18:57] Depot do you get it now
[2:19:01] God want to be the core of the audience
[2:19:07] so then the pasta the fivefold ministry
[2:19:10] becomes channels of God to bring God to
[2:19:13] the people not for God to remain behind
[2:19:16] here
[2:19:16] no forgot to come down there but we get
[2:19:20] a lot of shout
[2:19:21] [Music]
[2:19:24] it's never God's will for man to rule
[2:19:27] man read available have power over the
[2:19:30] fish over the birds over creeping things
[2:19:33] he never say how pole another man or
[2:19:36] give the Lord some praise these people
[2:19:37] give the Lord some shouts give the Lord
[2:19:40] some praises God never said that
[2:19:44] [Music]
[2:19:47] you cannot follow all the others until
[2:19:50] the power over yourself so don't try to
[2:19:53] get Paulo only anybody do you love
[2:19:55] yourself Mac the perfect man he can drag
[2:19:58] his tongue not the perfect man
[2:20:00] he'll temperance will give the Lord some

[2:20:14] muslin seal like I'm like Liam as well
[2:20:18] as a joke you can't do that
[2:20:22] you have to be able to humble yourself
[2:20:26] many people don't want to humble
[2:20:28] themselves yeah take the right when they
[2:20:31] did wrong humble yourself why would go
[2:20:35] up with a minister as a minister
[2:20:37] why would go up with a watchman in the
[2:20:38] tower just see what you see the enemy
[2:20:41] you can be your own private pasta the
[2:20:44] private Revelator you can t up again

[2:20:53] material hallelujah you have to get into
[2:20:57] leadership and guidance that my god sent
[2:21:00] gift some places to bring guidance to
[2:21:02] bring leadership by the Holy Ghost
[2:21:05] by the Holy Ghost not here at starts
[2:21:11] either finishes many start the race but
[2:21:15] has one finish it there'll be many
[2:21:17] judges start many groups of people there
[2:21:19] will be one group finish that's the
[2:21:21] overcomers isis eyeliner send me a coat
[2:21:25] dear was really a blessing to me because
[2:21:27] i had this prepared hadees and i will
[2:21:29] just take this one is that a year and
[2:21:30] it's on me same message ok i overcome
[2:21:32] now we're speaking of overcoming the
[2:21:34] would overcome of course you know what
[2:21:35] it means
[2:21:36] you've got to have some need overcome
[2:21:37] and this church age that holy ghost was
[2:21:39] speaking about here biodiesel you teach
[2:21:41] has always been true it needed a
[2:21:42] rebuking quite early outside but notice
[2:21:45] his calling as not just to the church
[2:21:47] he not overcome it not the church that
[2:21:51] would be she but is he over commit the
[2:21:54] individual that will overcome so this
[2:21:57] group is that a church group is a bunch
[2:21:59] of individuals that will be overcome and
[2:22:02] that will make up that group he commits
[2:22:05] oh praise the name of the lord are you
[2:22:07] with me all praise be to Jesus thank you
[2:22:10] Lord notice each son out of each church
[2:22:13] age overcome the temptation of that age
[2:22:15] along along with you as I said in the
[2:22:17] beginning you are born defeated and put
[2:22:19] that that bit can never bring it to life
[2:22:20] because your Pony fitted you are the in
[2:22:23] a defeated world among a defeated people
[2:22:25] among if he decrees fifty nominations
[2:22:27] you've got to come to victory
[2:22:28] somewhere that Lily presses his way
[2:22:31] through the muck and the mud
[2:22:33] and to bring an express what it has been
[2:22:35] and God by predestination has brought
[2:22:37] the seat in life and expresses itself to
[2:22:39] life isn't that right oh praise God so
[2:22:42] for the Branham let's continue I have to
[2:22:44] continue my Jesus give us the example
[2:22:48] how to do it how we know how to overcome
[2:22:50] Jesus told us how to do it humility he
[2:22:54] could himself took a towel washes at his
[2:22:57] feet the very court of heaven humiliated
[2:23:00] himself we told one to be humiliated we
[2:23:04] want to show we better than we have more
[2:23:06] than we could better than there whatever
[2:23:09] it is but God wants you to be humble
[2:23:12] Jesus
[2:23:13] humble himself and become common
[2:23:17] obedience to God to the cross we don't
[2:23:19] want to be humiliated that's a reason
[2:23:21] woman don't have to grow out the reason
[2:23:23] they dressed like ladies should it's the
[2:23:25] same thing they don't want to get
[2:23:26] humiliated greatness is expect it
[2:23:28] greatest is humility don't forget that
[2:23:30] church greatness is expect
[2:23:32] expression humility overcome means a
[2:23:34] standard test just like the old scenes
[2:23:36] did just like Jesus did I miss all the
[2:23:39] enemies he stood the test overcome means
[2:23:43] to recognize that develop every one of
[2:23:46] his tricks a real devil you must
[2:23:48] recognize him real you must know he's a
[2:23:50] devil then the one you recognize him I
[2:23:52] know he's a devil he's against you then
[2:23:54] overcome you must recognize that the God
[2:23:56] in you is greater and mightier he that's
[2:23:59] trying to overcome him isn't that right

[2:28:14] time can be dissolved listen rhetorical

[2:28:18] that to come straight from God the
[2:28:19] attribute to the flesh to be tempted and
[2:28:21] tested by sin like Adam but when that
[2:28:23] testing of his word is over then we are
[2:28:26] taken up to his body
[2:28:28] that must be paired for us before the
[2:28:29] foundation of the world it is the word
[2:28:32] dear that we skipped to come write her
[2:28:35] on to be tested and tested and if we had
[2:28:37] come to that there'd be no temptation
[2:28:39] with normal things that's the reason
[2:28:42] Jesus not all things because he was the
[2:28:44] word before he become flesh then we
[2:28:47] become the word and here about here
[2:28:50] right here we are formed to the one
[2:28:53] image to be a partaker of the word feed

[2:34:14] speed back to the earth that's a
[2:34:15] covenant send back the holy spirit to
[2:34:18] live in the church to prove he seemed
[2:34:21] yesterday than forever when the Holy
[2:34:23] Spirit fell on Pentecost it produced a
[2:34:25] church and brother I don't care what he
[2:34:27] nomination you've got talk to you accept
[2:34:29] that spirit was taught or the crisis put
[2:34:31] in time and he'll be left in the other
[2:34:32] rapture so that rapture connection is
[2:34:35] connected with the spirit of price
[2:34:37] itself which is the token so he is
[2:34:41] seeing to go in the rapture you have to
[2:34:44] have his sin spirit
[2:34:47] and that same spirit must be on display
[2:34:50] you can hide it at all our experimental
[2:34:54] nobody he will pull the mask off for you
[2:34:59] this is my beloved son look at me look
[2:35:01] at me you can find this thing you can
[2:35:05] hide Christianity you can hide the blood
[2:35:07] the blood has to be applied you can hide
[2:35:09] it stop hiding understand you have to
[2:35:13] step out now come on now come on now
[2:35:16] because I have to see that but when I
[2:35:18] see the blood I'm gonna oh my so he tore
[2:35:23] my parts and holy goes on to live in us
[2:35:26] straight of Christ
[2:35:28] therefore the only kind of true spirit
[2:35:32] that can receive the word that can
[2:35:34] receive Christ wrestle number try put
[2:35:36] the spreader call upon a wolf it angered
[2:35:38] mean it won't stay there the whole
[2:35:40] spirit just flies away it won't do it if
[2:35:43] that dove a compound if it does come
[2:35:45] down instead of being lamb with a wolf
[2:35:46] summarising mother couldn't see dog let
[2:35:49] the lamb notice it let the lamb to
[2:35:51] slaughter now this is where if you don't
[2:35:55] have a humble heart you will end up in
[2:35:57] trouble because leaden have to do with
[2:36:01] leaving where you don't want to go we
[2:36:05] have all kind of things to do in the
[2:36:06] church some people might like to do this
[2:36:08] I'd like to do that but we may not want
[2:36:10] that done no see I enter in that and win
[2:36:13] that ok you're not doing that see in
[2:36:15] life we could act like way but when you
[2:36:18] are being led you have to have a heart
[2:36:20] to lead to follow where you are being
[2:36:23] led by the spirit because Jesus was led
[2:36:27] by the spirit into the wilderness nobody
[2:36:30] goes in the wilderness the wilderness do
[2:36:33] have a coke Stan you know coca-cola and
[2:36:36] Pepsi under the witness offer ice
[2:36:39] buckets with cold juice and sandwiches
[2:36:42] you know it wilderness is dry the
[2:36:45] wilderness is beer the winners have no
[2:36:48] one knowing tune in it it is desert
[2:36:51] nobody walks the car gets it up since
[2:36:53] I'm gonna die anybody talking away you
[2:36:57] know something wrong you have to be led
[2:37:02] Jesus humbled himself and became
[2:37:06] obedient Church it is very important if
[2:37:10] all what you we hear a lot of stuff
[2:37:12] today but this is checked out check ours
[2:37:15] for this today's important French was
[2:37:17] the trans important very important you
[2:37:21] have to have a humble heart for this
[2:37:24] period of God to guide you especially
[2:37:27] where you do want to go if you don't
[2:37:32] have a humble heart and his bracelet
[2:37:33] Google say hi yeah dude I understand
[2:37:36] that no it can't be led can be directed
[2:37:42] but a Branham the dog led the lamb
[2:37:45] notices leather lamb to slaughter lamb
[2:37:47] was obedient to the dog no matter where
[2:37:49] delayed he was willing to go I wonder
[2:37:50] today when God leads a life every go of
[2:37:53] compensator and service to Him
[2:37:56] I wonder if I was bridge don't repel
[2:37:59] shooing if he allows a llama is obedient
[2:38:02] a lamp is self sacrificial it doesn't
[2:38:05] claim its own it can lead oh my I think
[2:38:09] I'll stop here music on please whoo-hee
[2:38:12] I continue next week but I instead get
[2:38:14] to my text really about the blood you
[2:38:17] identify in your life by the sacrifice
[2:38:18] you make then the plan was a token or
[2:38:22] identification the blood identified that
[2:38:25] the worshiper had slain accepted alarm a
[2:38:27] pilot talking to himself he was not a
[2:38:29] shame he didn't care we saw it he wanted
[2:38:31] everybody to see it it was placed in
[2:38:34] such a position that everybody could see
[2:38:36] that too many people wants to be
[2:38:39] Christians they want to like it secretly
[2:38:42] nobody could know they're Christians he
[2:38:44] said well I want to be a Christian but I
[2:38:47] do want you also to know about it but
[2:38:49] that's not Christianity even the
[2:38:51] governor's not me think Christianity are
[2:38:55] clueless hasta display its token
[2:38:59] publicly in public lights at the office
[2:39:04] on the street when trouble is around
[2:39:08] anything in church everywhere else
[2:39:11] the blood is are talking the talk must
[2:39:13] be applied or even a covenant is not in
[2:39:16] effect
[2:39:16] oh my so I'm gonna close I want to just
[2:39:20] let escape lately thus shall you eat it
[2:39:24] with your loins girded your shoes and
[2:39:28] your feet your stuff in your hand you

[2:39:36] attitude like it's just you know in the
[2:39:39] old time when you're moving no no no

[2:39:49] know taking your time I'm taking my time
[2:39:53] you've got to get them with potential
[2:39:55] comment you have to prepare to leave

[2:40:03] want to leave leaving is guaranteed you
[2:40:07] will leave here but it's home if you
[2:40:11] want to leave this rapture way it's the
[2:40:13] attitude of applying this blood for I
[2:40:17] will pass to the Egypt this night and
[2:40:19] smite all the firstborn of Egypt but man
[2:40:22] and beasts and against all the gods of
