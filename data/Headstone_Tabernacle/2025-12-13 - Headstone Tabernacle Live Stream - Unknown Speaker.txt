HIS PART WAS TO FINISH IT. BUT YOUR PART IS TO IDENTIFY WHAT IS FINISHED. HALLELUJAH. YOU SAY, "IS THE WILL OF GOD TO HEAL ME? BY MY STRIPES, I AM HEALED." IS IT THE WILL OF GOD TO SAVE ME? THIS GOSPEL IS FOR THOSE WHO THE LORD SHALL CALL. Come on, I'M PREACHING TO YOU. IT'S TIME TO GET UP AND STAND ON THE WORD OF GOD AND ROLL THE STONE AWAY. [cheering] TELL THAT DEVIL RIGHT NOW, NERVOUSNESS IS FINISHED. Unbelief is finished. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER THE DEVIL IS HANGING OVER YOUR LIFE, [screaming] DO YOUR PART TODAY. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; It is finished. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Can I say it to you today? Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the unlimited generation. &gt;&gt; You're not just walking around limited with an intellectual conception, &gt;&gt; but you have been given &gt;&gt; the revelation, &gt;&gt; the revealed will of God, &gt;&gt; now. What are you going to do with it? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; What What are you going to do with it? &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ander, I'm limited. I defy that devil. &gt;&gt; I rebuke that devil. [applause] You're not limited. &gt;&gt; You're unlimited. [applause] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what's limiting you is what you're &gt;&gt; This is okay. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what's limiting you is the way you're thinking about God. &gt;&gt; And the way you're thinking about this word, &gt;&gt; you're thinking you got to get it all figured out before it can work for you. And you're thinking you got to be able to cross all the tees and dot all the eyes. YOU KNOW WHAT? MY BIBLE SAID ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. [cheering] TO THEM THAT can believe. If you can believe it, [cheering] if you can BELIEVE IT, THEN YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT TO POSSESS IT. COME ON, CHURCH. YOU'RE UNLIMITED. COME ON. THE DEVIL IS LIMITED. BUT OUR GOD IS UNLIMITED. HE'S GOT UNLIMITED POWER. HE'S GOT UNLIMITED MERCY. HE'S GOT UNLIMITED GRACE. HE'S GOT UNLIMITED REVELATION. LISTEN, THERE IS AN UNLIMITED REVIVAL. THERE IS UNLIMITED JOY. THERE IS UNLIMITED ANOINTING. THERE IS UNLIMITED AUTHORITY. THERE IS UNLIMITED REALITIES OF THE NEVER FAILING PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST. You're unlimited. &gt;&gt; You're unlimited. Let me say this to you today as the musicians come. You're unlimited. &gt;&gt; Tradition tradition will limit you. But this message will unlimit you. &gt;&gt; The other day I was speaking [snorts] on some thoughts along the lines of limitations. And I was praying and I said, "Lord, here I am speaking to these young people and I'm telling them they're unlimited. &gt;&gt; They're unlimited. You're unlimited in God. You're unlimited in his power. You're you're unlimited in his anointing. You're unlimited in his authority. You're un you're you're you're an unlimited generation. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you what? You also have unlimited expectations. [applause] &gt;&gt; There's no limit on the expectations of a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Unlimited. &gt;&gt; Unlimited. And I got to thinking on that and I was riding down the road and I was just meditating and praying and I said, 'Lord, that young people are unlimited. I said, I'm just praying, Lord, show it to me. Make it more real. And as clear as I'm talking to you, spirit Lord spoke to my heart and said, go tell my young people the only place they're unlimited is in this message. &gt;&gt; And you know how you just start fellowshipping with the Lord? I said, Lord, that's powerful. I said, "Lord, then where are they limited?" And it just come to my heart so clearly. Do you realize in sports you're limited? &gt;&gt; Do you realize you can start out as a kid playing and you can climb all the way up to the top and you can reach the majors &gt;&gt; or whatever they have here, the the highest league, &gt;&gt; and you're limited. You can't go no further. &gt;&gt; You're capped off, &gt;&gt; finished. Done. I said, "Lord, where else?" Spirit of the Lord brought it to my heart. Education, &gt;&gt; not preaching against education. I believe in it in its place. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; But do you realize you can start off in grade school and climb all the way to the highest degree you can get in college and you can't go no further? &gt;&gt; But in this message, [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; IN THIS MESSAGE, THERE'S NO LIMIT. THERE'S NO LIMIT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO LIMIT TO WHAT YOU CAN DO. THERE'S NO LIMIT TO WHERE YOU CAN GO. COME ON. YOU SAY, "I CAN ONLY GO SO FAR." NO, YOU CAN GO ALL THE WAY TO HEAVEN. YOU CAN GO ALL THE WAY TO GLORY. YOU'RE NOT JUST CLIMBING UP TO ONE AGE. YOU DIDN'T JUST CLIMB UP TO THE AIRPLANE. YOU DIDN'T JUST CLIMB UP, AMEN, TO THE HORSE AND BUGGY. YOU CAN CLIMB ALL THE WAY UP INTO THE REALMS OF THE ETERNITIES of God. You're unlimited IN THIS WORD. RELEASE YOUR FAITH. RELEASE YOUR FAITH IN THIS PROMISED word of God. Stand on your feet with us today. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Stand up &gt;&gt; and let that word &gt;&gt; become your word. &gt;&gt; Believe it. &gt;&gt; Don't reason it. &gt;&gt; Just believe it. &gt;&gt; Don't reason it. &gt;&gt; Just believe it. You said, "But Andrew, what are you getting at?" I'll tell you exactly what I'm getting at. There is a people on the earth today who has not rejected the revealed will of God. &gt;&gt; But they have received the revealed will of God. &gt;&gt; And today there is an authority in this building. There is a power right here in this building today &gt;&gt; that every young man, every young woman, every man, every woman can be delivered today &gt;&gt; by the will of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know the will of God. &gt;&gt; Now, we're here to do the will of God. &gt;&gt; How many say, "Lord, today I want to do." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to carry out your plan. &gt;&gt; I want to carry out your will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, it's not my will, &gt;&gt; but thy will be done. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want today I want to lay my life on the altar. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to self-sacrifice. &gt;&gt; I want to sacrifice my ideas today, Lord. I want to sacrifice the new cart. I want to lay it on the altar. I'm tired of trying to live live this message on the new cart. [music] I want to come back to God's ordained way. Said, "Brother Andrew, I'm nervous and can't overcome these things and [music] can't overcome it." I tell you, the power of God is in this building today. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of new carts around, but there's only one ordained way, &gt;&gt; and it's the Holy Ghost and fire. &gt;&gt; It'll clean a man up. &gt;&gt; It'll transform a life. I believe right here today, you've been given authority. &gt;&gt; God has done his part. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God has done his part. God has sent his word. God has revealed the message. &gt;&gt; The angels of God are in the building. The presence of the Holy Spirit is here. God has done his part. Now I say unto you today, will you do your part? Will you roll this stone away with every head bowed eye closed right now? Whatever you're facing, I believe the Holy Ghost is right here in this building today. I believe he's here to roll that stone away. Will you let him do it right now? I believe he's right here to give you the strength to [music] say, "Satan, I'm rolling this stone away. The Holy Spirit, the resurrection is right here in this building. The resurrection is here to call forth these things the enemy has tried to bury in my life. He's here calling you forth. Almighty God in this building today is standing your sons and your daughters. Now, Father, there's one thing I know. I know that we're two or three are gathered together in your name. [music] You made a promise that you would come and you would be in our midst. Now, Lord, I look around and there's more than two or three here today. But Lord, there's a room here full of believers that are believing you. Father, they're ready for that transforming grace and power of your life and your word to come into their heart. Now, Father, I bind the hand of Satan right now that would try to paralyze their faith, that would try to paralyze the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Father, I believe you're right here tonight, this morning, Lord, this evening, rather. I believe you're right here walking the aisles of this building, Lord. Father, we've preached your word today, telling the children of God, you've done your part. Now, Lord, you're not looking [music] for us to figure it out. That's not our part. Our part is not intellectually understanding all these things. Our part is to believe. Our part is to believe what you've done. Our part is to accept it by faith and let it become a revelation to our hearts. Now, Father, if there be one here today that the devil's in a great battle with them, I pray the grace of Almighty God would usher that revelation into their hearts, Lord, that they would see and understand and know who they are in your word. They would know the power that rest upon their lives. Father, I'm asking you today, come by this way, Lord. Father, your word is gone [music] forth now. I pray that shackles and the chains would fall off, oh God. Lord, the demons of hell, the demons of Leodysia, the spirits that are attacking the homes and attacking the [music] mamas and daddies and attacking the children, attacking the family. Father, I stand here today as a voice against it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Satan, you've come against the world. You've you've claimed homes. You've claimed nations, but there's a little faith woman who's rising to the challenge. HALLELUJAH. WE'RE RISING TO the challenge and we're drawing our sword and we're going to fight for the original structure that the word is given in this hour for a home and for a family. Father, I pray for these young men. Lord, I pray you would baptize them with the Holy Ghost and fire. I pray the realities of Jesus Christ would become their portion today. Father, I pray, Lord, you would give them the courage of Joshua. I pray you would give them the strength of [music] Samson. I pray you would give them the wisdom of Solomon. I pray you would give them the the anointing, [music] oh God, of David. Father, I PRAY YOU WOULD GIVE THEM THE things you would have for them, Lord. Not to just be sissies, not to just be young men led around by Leosa, BUT FATHER, I believe [music] you're calling for real men that are going to become husbands will become fathers. Lord, if you should terry, they'll become the leaders of the church. Lord, you're not looking for compromisers. YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR LAZY CHRISTIANS. You're looking for evils that are willing to hunt. They're willing to dig. They're willing to pursue the things of God. Father, I pray for every young lady. Father, may you give her the grace, Lord. May you give her the grace of Sarah. Father, may you give her the grace, Lord, to be a h to to be a Holy Ghost fil lady, to be a Holy Ghost fil daughter of Abraham. Lord, when Leosa is trying to dress our young ladies in Hollywood, it's trying to claim their lives and their bodies for their own fulfillment. I rebuke every devil in the name of Jesus [music] Christ. May the power OF THE HOLY GHOST, may it surround every young lady. May you give her the power to overcome, Lord. May you make her a Holy GHOST FILLED WIFE. MAY YOU make her a Holy Ghost filled mother. Lord, [music] if the time cherry, there'll be the Sunday school teachers. There'll be the there'll be the fifth gospel leading the young people. Oh God, I believe this message has come [music] to restore back people who is doing the will of God, not on the new cart, but in God's [music] ordained way to do it. Father, if there be one here today in the valley of decision, I pray the voice of omnipotence would [music] speak across this service today and may you give them direction, Lord. [music] Father, if they're moving under the inspiration of a man, may they come under the inspiration of [music] your word. Father, if they're viewing this message through the filter of a man, may they lay [music] it aside and take a thinking man's filter. May they lay aside theories, Lord. May they lay aside ideas and traditions and may they lay aside everything to receive you [music] and to receive you fully in the name [music] of Jesus Christ we pray. In the name of Jesus Christ we pray. I [music] wonder if you just raise your hands to him right now. Say, "Father, I believe it. Father, I believe your word. Father, I believe you're calling some children right here today to do your will." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There [music] is power. There is power in the name of Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is power in the name of Jesus today. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
