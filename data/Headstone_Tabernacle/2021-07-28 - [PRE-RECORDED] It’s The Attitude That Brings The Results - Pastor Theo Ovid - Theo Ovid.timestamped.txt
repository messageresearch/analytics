[25:34] words in verse 49 it's read
[25:38] luke 24 49 and behold i send the promise
[25:41] of my father upon you
[25:43] retiring the siege of jerusalem until
[25:46] you be endured power from on high
[25:49] and you led them out as fast as bethany
[25:51] and he lifted up his hands and blessed
[25:53] them
[25:54] and it came to pass while he blessed
[25:56] them he was parted from them
[25:58] and carried up into heaven and they
[26:00] worshipped him
[26:02] and returned to jerusalem with great joy
[26:05] and we're continually in the temple
[26:07] praising and blessing god amen may god
[26:09] bless his word
[26:10] you may be seated oh praise the name of
[26:12] the lord
[26:14] thank you lord jesus tonight
[26:18] our title is the attitude that brings
[26:20] the results
[26:22] is the attitude that brings results
[26:25] and i have an inspiration the atmosphere
[26:28] of
[26:28] judah perfection i want to encourage you
[26:32] tonight
[26:32] to stay in the woods
[26:38] in the atmosphere of the world
[26:42] if you're in the wrong atmosphere you
[26:44] cannot get the results
[26:46] that you're looking for so we want to
[26:48] share some things with you tonight that
[26:50] we feel upon our hearts
[26:51] that would help you and strengthen you
[26:53] and edify you
[26:54] and the prophet was spoken about a
[26:56] message a personal experience with god
[26:57] 1954
[26:59] and he was chained about moses how moses
[27:02] has been a bit had been a bitter failure
[27:05] for yet knowing that god is going to
[27:06] deliver the children of israel by him
[27:09] yet trying to do it within himself
[27:12] 40 years before that become a failure
[27:15] had
[27:15] lost all the vision of victory and of
[27:18] the freedom of the people enslaved
[27:21] see when you lost the vision you you
[27:24] just does not be
[27:25] burdened anymore to do what needs to be
[27:28] done
[27:29] because if god called you qualified job
[27:32] he called you to enlist you into his
[27:34] program
[27:35] his plan of redemption isn't that right
[27:37] and the prophet i wonder sometimes if we
[27:39] the church knowing that god is promised
[27:41] to deliver the church from its sin from
[27:43] its sickness
[27:44] and to make us a people our salty people
[27:47] that the earth will
[27:48] hunger and taste after i wonder in our
[27:51] human efforts
[27:52] in our theologies and so forth our great
[27:54] fine buildings and so forth
[27:55] as we try to present the people many
[27:58] years ago we found it has failed
[28:00] because we took it in ourselves to do so
[28:02] we took it upon ourselves to have new
[28:04] schools
[28:05] educate ministers we left off the real
[28:07] principle
[28:08] the real thing that god told us to
[28:10] receive was to let
[28:11] the holy spirit lead the church
[28:14] we have left that off we have lost our
[28:16] divine joy
[28:17] and the vision is dull now so when that
[28:21] joy is there you can't wait to come to
[28:22] church
[28:23] you can't wait to be in service you
[28:24] can't wait to be in the presence of god
[28:26] because this is your source this is your
[28:28] inspiration this is where you're getting
[28:30] your drawing from
[28:32] isn't that right people are not looking
[28:34] for the coming of the lord yet atomic
[28:35] bombs hanging everywhere
[28:36] people have lost their vision of the
[28:38] lord because they have set times
[28:40] that the lord will come a certain time
[28:42] and have done all these things how can
[28:44] we do those things without the holy
[28:45] spirit
[28:46] moses have been a bit of failure but oh
[28:49] dear we see the tension attracted to a
[28:51] burning bush
[28:52] isn't that right fire attracts the
[28:54] people now watch
[28:56] fear tick a hole right quick when moses
[28:58] stood aside to consider this burning
[29:00] tree
[29:01] god spoke to him a fresh vision by an
[29:04] angel
[29:06] so when the vision get dull sometimes
[29:08] god had to give you a fresh word
[29:10] a fresh anointing a fresh inspiration
[29:13] a fresh fire amen that still you up
[29:16] again
[29:17] to the vision of god that god has put
[29:20] inside your soul
[29:22] that's what the church need tonight
[29:23] watch watch watch now watch faith take a
[29:25] hold right quick
[29:26] the old things passed away moses no has
[29:29] a new vision
[29:30] he has a revelation he has an experience
[29:34] vision revelation
[29:37] and experience he had met god
[29:40] he had talked to god before that he had
[29:42] not met god
[29:44] he only read and knowed what his mother
[29:46] had told him
[29:48] by hearing what his mother told him by
[29:50] what the pastor said
[29:52] but now moses had a personal experience
[29:55] so you read the spoken word books you're
[29:57] not glossing a prophet be all i send you
[29:59] elijah like what you read
[30:00] that's what you receive that's what you
[30:02] understand but now you have to get your
[30:04] personal experience
[30:06] with god not reading a book not
[30:09] listening to a tape
[30:10] but with the same pillar of fire oh
[30:13] glory to god because that filler fire
[30:15] come to activate the sons of god
[30:19] oh glory to god couldn't somebody say
[30:22] amen
[30:23] that pillar of fire come to activate the
[30:25] sons of god
[30:26] so you should want to be god activated
[30:30] oh not intellectually activated god
[30:33] every scripture is god bleed the breath
[30:36] of god is upon this word
[30:39] oh hallelujah that's what the church
[30:42] needs tonight
[30:43] is stop studying so much theology and
[30:46] get down to the altar
[30:47] and pray until a personal experience
[30:51] burned down in the human heart and burns
[30:53] out all the dullness
[30:55] and gives a new vision oh glory to god
[30:58] we need a fresh altar call
[31:00] every man at the altar every man
[31:03] repented
[31:04] every man crying out whatever said enjoy
[31:07] let the priest hold on to the horns of
[31:09] the altar
[31:10] let him cry for the wine and cry for the
[31:13] oil
[31:13] and then god said enjoy you and i will
[31:15] restore to you
[31:17] the years that the locals had eaten the
[31:20] palmer woman eaten
[31:21] when after they cry out oh glory to
[31:24] god he said what releases the prayer
[31:27] meeting
[31:27] they say lord send on the adoption oh
[31:31] glory to god we are teaching for 40 plus
[31:33] years
[31:34] it's time for fire it's time for power
[31:37] oh glory to god we have to create the
[31:40] atmosphere
[31:42] because the atmosphere is what you're
[31:44] gonna
[31:45] get the results
[31:46] [Applause]
[31:48] hallelujah glory to god amen
[31:52] may be seated praise god praise god
[31:56] amen faith in god
[31:59] it's a staggering to many people and we
[32:02] ought to be ashamed of ourselves to
[32:03] confess
[32:04] we don't have faith in god first there's
[32:06] cowards who die ten thousand nets
[32:09] while they're hearing it a hero never
[32:11] dies his memory lingers on for his
[32:13] heroic deeds
[32:15] and usually here we go people who have
[32:17] faith
[32:18] are people who have experience
[32:21] experience brings faith
[32:23] oh glory to god you hear what you hear
[32:25] that
[32:26] experience brings fate so when moses met
[32:29] that pillar of fire
[32:30] nobody could stop moses to tell him
[32:34] and talk him out to going back to egypt
[32:36] and if you ask well this is where you're
[32:38] going
[32:39] he's here to take over oh glory to god
[32:43] what he couldn't do in 40 years he was
[32:45] doing instantly
[32:47] because he met the pillar of fire and
[32:49] barabba
[32:50] stood and prophesied he said god
[32:53] will do in one year what all theologians
[32:57] fail to do in two thousand years
[33:00] you wait till that little remnant
[33:04] that god's gonna give that elijah wait
[33:07] till they go to the corner of god
[33:14] before you wait it's coming it's coming
[33:17] it's coming
[33:21] oh glory to god these are not plain
[33:24] words
[33:24] every word is a seed he said wait till
[33:27] them
[33:27] seven times after their voices that that
[33:30] people who can take the word and hand
[33:32] the deer
[33:33] oh glory will slice and cut they can't
[33:35] shut the heavens
[33:37] they have to do whatever they want to do
[33:40] [Applause]
[33:44] we don't have to ask permission for god
[33:45] to deliver your family we letting your
[33:47] family go
[33:48] we say pharaoh let them go
[33:52] you are free tonight lose them and let
[33:55] them go
[33:55] [Music]
[33:57] oh glory to god hallelujah
[34:00] praise god hallelujah
[34:04] hallelujah not the preacher experience
[34:07] is your experience
[34:09] you have to get your own experience i
[34:11] need experience being fit
[34:12] when then gossiping our prophets is one
[34:14] of us back to the faith of the fathers
[34:16] that when we have go back to an
[34:17] experience that the father fathers had
[34:19] because they had an experience
[34:21] hallelujah and jesus sent them in the
[34:24] upper room
[34:25] they gave them the promise of the father
[34:27] and the bible said they were in the
[34:29] upper room
[34:30] they were praising and blessing god
[34:31] continually
[34:33] what were they doing they were creating
[34:35] an atmosphere
[34:37] and they were staying in the atmosphere
[34:39] it all depends upon your attitude
[34:41] that's going to bring the results but we
[34:43] have to create an atmosphere
[34:45] the atmosphere is what makes a
[34:46] difference oh the song leader was
[34:48] singing tonight
[34:50] and he didn't know what to do the
[34:51] anointing and building
[34:53] is the atmosphere it take away the blues
[34:56] it removes your frustration it affects
[34:59] the bad day you had corrects all of that
[35:02] what this does it is the atmosphere the
[35:05] atmosphere of the holy spirit
[35:07] that will say our power the opposite of
[35:09] god
[35:10] we need that atmosphere you want that
[35:12] atmosphere
[35:13] you want it in your house you want it in
[35:15] the kitchen you want it when you leave
[35:17] out
[35:17] when you leave the home you want that
[35:20] [Music]
[35:23] [Applause]
[35:25] [Music]
[35:28] atmosphere
[35:30] you want to bring your home under the
[35:32] atmosphere let's continue
[35:33] the wood is a seed message called
[35:35] fellowship 1955
[35:36] and the seed won't grow unless it's
[35:38] placed in the right kind of ground
[35:40] so the sea is not the is problem
[35:43] atmosphere or the ground right ground
[35:47] if the policy sit on top of here it's
[35:48] not growing at all because that is not
[35:50] for seeds
[35:52] that that is something else see that to
[35:54] go in the right

[48:48] [Applause]
[48:51] [Music]
[48:51] [Applause]
[48:54] the reason here but around the reason
[48:57] are pentecost
[48:58] they had to go in an upper room and pray
[49:01] until the holy ghost came because they
[49:04] got in one place and one accord
[49:06] it's the atmosphere that brings the
[49:08] results
[49:10] aha all right attitude bring the results
[49:13] and the atmosphere bring the results
[49:15] so god send them there to wait until
[49:19] they have the right atmosphere because
[49:21] holy ghost comes
[49:22] and dry holy ghost got coming on a dead
[49:25] church
[49:26] they take an atmosphere to make that
[49:28] atmosphere
[49:29] [Music]
[49:36] listen listen when jesus died those guys
[49:39] were under depression and frustration
[49:41] and all kind of thing like that
[49:43] because the master gone who crying who's
[49:45] sad and all kinds of things like that
[49:47] even the woman and the sisters had more
[49:49] revelation inspiration than some of them
[49:50] brothers
[49:51] because the angel tell them sisters go
[49:53] and tell them i'm not dead
[49:55] telling me raise from the dead them them
[49:57] running with message
[49:59] and brothers saying if except a touch
[50:01] and i feel
[50:02] i will not believe you know what i'm
[50:03] talking about
[50:06] i believe you know who following jesus
[50:08] you know except i touch and feel says
[50:10] they feel nothing
[50:12] they say we've seen him he's risen we
[50:14] see him
[50:16] they still i believe daryl when jesus
[50:19] appeared to them he said come come you
[50:20] want to touch come and touch come and
[50:22] touch
[50:22] don't run now come and touch they say
[50:24] die be afraid
[50:27] so when you meet them talking the
[50:28] negative talk and jesus
[50:30] he said rebuke them he's all fools and
[50:33] slow of heart to believe all what i said
[50:35] this is what's showing you all the time
[50:37] that i have to suffer these things i
[50:40] even tell you if i don't go recover that
[50:41] will not come
[50:42] know that i'm here i'm showing you now

[50:51] promise of my father
[50:52] they knew exactly what they was going to
[50:54] receive
[50:55] power power power you shall receive the
