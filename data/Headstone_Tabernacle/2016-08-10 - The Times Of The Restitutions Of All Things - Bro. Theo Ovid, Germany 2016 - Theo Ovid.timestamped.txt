[21:04] praise unto thee.
[21:06] I will worship toward thy holy temple
[21:09] and praise thy name for thy loving
[21:11] kindness and for thy truth. For thou
[21:15] hast magnified thy word above all thy

[21:21] answerest me and strengthenest me with
[21:24] strength in my soul. All the kings of

[21:51] the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive
[21:54] me. Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand
[21:58] against the wrath of the mine enemies,
[22:01] and thy right hand shall save me.

[44:11] uh I just wanted to ask you to forgive
[44:13] me just to greet the ministers
[44:15] collectively because the time I will
[44:18] take will be very short. Our friends and
[44:20] brothers and sisters, we just want to
[44:22] say the greatest three words on earth.
[44:25] God bless you.
[44:27] [Applause]
[44:29] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[44:34] Since I've been in these meetings, the
[44:36] the ones I've been able to come to, I've
[44:39] been so greatly moved by the atmosphere.
[44:43] The services I've heard thus far have
[44:46] been tremendous. And I would like to
[44:48] greet you with the great words of David
[44:51] in Psalm
[44:53] 119 and verse 59 which says, "I thought
[44:58] on my ways
[45:01] and I turned my feet unto thy
[45:03] testimonies."
[45:05] David made a great statement there and
[45:09] this is the atmosphere I feel which is a
[45:12] great victory at this time.
[45:15] David was not critical. He was not
[45:19] blaming. He was not uh pointing a finger
[45:22] to anything. He was simply self
[45:27] evaluating. He was self
[45:31] inspecting. He was self auditing and he
[45:35] was bringing to pass a personal manet
[45:41] techin in his life. He was weighing
[45:44] himself in the light of his
[45:48] circumstances. David was saying, "I
[45:51] thought on my ways." He was not pointing
[45:55] at anybody. He was saying, "No, I am
[45:59] looking at
[46:00] me."
[46:02] Accountability. Thank you, brother Puit.
[46:05] He was talking about himself. David
[46:09] decided that he had to talk to himself.
[46:12] And in these meetings, I feel this
[46:15] atmosphere even as Nathan had to talk to
[46:19] David in the one of the many times he
[46:22] had of trouble and Nathan had to force
[46:26] David to think upon his ways. And David
[46:30] would have forgotten perhaps but Nathan
[46:32] gave him a story and David had to reply
[46:35] to that story that man will
[46:39] die but he said you won't die. He was
[46:42] forced to think upon his
[46:45] ways. When we think of our lives we need
[46:49] to ponder what we're doing in this
[46:53] season. I think of Jonah.
[46:56] Jonah had an idea to take the easy way
[47:00] to Tarses, but God wouldn't let him
[47:04] escape. Jonah had to think upon his
[47:07] ways. He had to say, "What's more
[47:09] important? Is it my comfort or is it
[47:14] saving souls?" In Nineveh, we have to
[47:18] think upon our ways. Job had to think
[47:23] upon his ways. Amen. When he went
[47:26] through his trials and battles with his
[47:29] health and the loss of so many things,
[47:33] Jonah said by the time he came to the
[47:36] end of it, he said, "I abore myself. I
[47:41] hate myself." All his thoughts changed
[47:44] as he thought upon his ways. Samson
[47:49] thought upon his ways. He thought he was
[47:53] strong.
[47:54] He thought he could do anything with his
[47:58] strength, but he gave his heart in the
[48:00] wrong place. But when D when Samson came
[48:04] back, he said, "Lord, once more. I've
[48:08] thought about my ways. Once more. Give
[48:12] me that power. Just once more." Jacob
[48:15] had to be left alone. He thought he had
[48:18] the blessing, but there was more
[48:20] blessing to get. And when he was left on
[48:23] his own to wrestle with an angel, Jacob
[48:26] had to think on his ways. And Jacob
[48:30] wrestled until he was changed. Not just
[48:34] blessed, but changed. My mind goes on
[48:37] Peter who in a spirit of
[48:41] enthusiasm said, "Lord, I never deny
[48:44] you." But when Peter was finished in his
[48:48] failure, Peter thought on his ways and
[48:51] he realized truly I need the Lord. And
[48:56] as we ponder in this season now, even
[48:59] our ways, we start to say, Lord, I have
[49:03] no issue with
[49:04] anybody. I have no enemies anywhere. My
[49:08] biggest enemy is myself. I want to think
[49:11] on my ways.
[49:13] Paul was another one who had to think on
[49:15] his ways. He called himself the Pharisee
[49:17] of the Pharisees.
[49:19] But when he thought on his ways, he
[49:21] thought, "How did I miss Jesus Christ in
[49:24] the scripture?" And Paul had to just
[49:26] realize no, he had to surrender
[49:28] everything he ever knew to really give
[49:32] himself over to the Lord, our precious
[49:34] prophet,
[49:36] William Brandham. In a moment of stress,
[49:39] in a moment of pressure, he even told
[49:42] something that was not
[49:44] true. But he came back to the Lord and
[49:47] said, "Forgive me." And he thought on
[49:49] his ways. And the Lord says, "Don't even
[49:51] pray for that baby until you put
[49:53] everything right." He put everything
[49:55] right in his life and in his prayer and
[49:58] so forth. And things became well. Even
[50:00] our prophet had to think on his
[50:04] ways. As we ponder these things, brother
[50:08] Connor Bernard, this is how I feel in
[50:09] this meeting. The ministry has been so
[50:12] sincere. And indeed, friends, we have to
[50:14] be even more sincere to bind the mamba.
[50:19] We have to think on my my ways. I've got
[50:21] to think on my ways. You have to think
[50:23] on your ways. And we realize according
[50:26] to one Corinthians 7, time is short.
[50:29] We're living at the very breaking of the
[50:32] rapture. May God continue to bless this
[50:35] wonderful convention. I thank God for
[50:38] the atmosphere here. I've been touched.
[50:40] People have contacted me and said
[50:42] they've been so moved to tears by the
[50:46] atmosphere of this convention. Thank
[50:48] you, brother Conor Brena, for your
[50:50] burden for the bride of Jesus Christ.
[50:52] Thank every minister. God bless you
[50:55] richly. Shalom.
[51:05] Amen. You appreciate that this evening.
[51:08] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[51:10] brother Peter Chandler. Amen. You may
[51:12] stand at this time also. And you can
[51:15] just give me a key for you are alpha and
[51:18] omega. Amen. There were just a couple of
[51:21] things I had to read here before um the
[51:25] speaker comes on
[51:27] tonight. And
[51:30] uh Amen. Let's just bow our heads
[51:33] now.
[51:35] Amen. There are three prayer requests we
[51:37] just want to bring before the Lord
[51:38] before the speaker comes. And uh uh we
[51:42] want to pray quickly for just for
[51:44] Daniela

[51:50] Samuel Cav Cavilleri all from Italy.
[51:54] They are having a stomach trouble. Uh we
[51:56] would like to pray for them at this
[51:59] time. Amen. Every head bowed, every eye
[52:03] closed. All gracious and heavenly
[52:07] father, we pray dear God, father for
[52:09] these prayer requests Lord that have

[52:31] all the praise, all the honor, all the
[52:33] glory as you grant us these prayer
[52:35] requests in Jesus name. Amen and amen.

[52:41] Lord a hand of praise. Can we give the
[52:43] Lord
[52:44] a hand
[52:47] clap? Amen. Why don't you turn around
[52:49] and greet each other just one more time?
[52:51] One more time. Turn around. Greet your
[52:53] brother. Greet your sister.

[57:14] blood. Thank God for the lamb. Oh,
[57:17] praise God.
[57:24] Let us bow our heads for a word of
[57:27] prayer. Almighty God, we thank you for
[57:30] your presence and the divine love and
[57:33] the opportunity to be here
[57:35] today. Lord, your prophet when he was on
[57:38] earth, he said this is the best time
[57:41] that we have now. It going to get worse
[57:45] and worse and worse.
[57:49] Father, the prophet Isaiah told us that
[57:51] gross darkness will cover the earth and
[57:54] gross darkness the people, but you
[57:56] promise light in the evening time.
[58:01] Help us, dear God. We are living in
[58:03] dreadful times. But we ask that your
[58:06] Holy Spirit will come down in a special
[58:08] way and minister to us and meet our
[58:11] every need and help us. Help your sons
[58:14] and daughters. Help those ministers of
[58:16] the gospels, those shepherds, Lord, and
[58:20] that struggling with the sheep with the
[58:22] responsibility and
[58:24] accountability at the as the time is at
[58:26] hand. God, honor your word among us this
[58:29] morning, this night. In Jesus name we
[58:31] ask it. Amen. And amen. You may be
[58:33] seated. Oh, blessed be the
[58:36] name of the
[58:40] Lord. But we bring greetings tonight.
[58:45] uh from the headstone tabernacle
[58:46] Trinidad. Bring greetings to you in
[58:48] Jesus name. I want to thank brother
[58:50] Zigma's family and church for this
[58:53] invitation to be here. I want to greet
[58:56] also the fellow ministers, fellow
[58:58] laborers in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[59:02] I want to appreciate all the ministers
[59:04] that has spoke before. Brother
[59:07] Biscll, brother Puit, brother Conte,
[59:10] brother Isaac, brother Hildebrandt. God
[59:12] bless you all in your time of
[59:15] labor. I want to thank brother Ziggma
[59:18] for the courage to do what he has done.
[59:21] And I, you know, brother Bram taught us
[59:24] to look to see a man's
[59:26] motive and objective to see what he's
[59:29] trying to
[59:30] achieve if he's trying to do something
[59:33] for the kingdom of God. And I believe
[59:36] that is what it's all about. So sad
[59:39] today to see men establishing
[59:41] themselves, their kingdom, the
[59:44] empire and and so on. But friends, all
[59:49] this power play and empire building and
[59:52] stuff is just
[59:54] temporary
[59:56] because the train is in the
[59:58] block and the train picks up people
[1:00:02] along the way and exit others along the
[1:00:05] way. But the Brandham exited its train
[1:00:07] in 1965 and that train continues on this
[1:00:10] Rapture Express as a Rapture Express to
[1:00:13] glory. And we don't know if this is the
[1:00:16] last meeting we going to ever have. We
[1:00:18] don't know what tomorrow holds. And I
[1:00:21] try to approach the puddle pit what I'm
[1:00:24] saying as if this is my last
[1:00:26] service, as if this is my last sermon.
[1:00:30] What I'm going to tell God's
[1:00:32] people that's who you are. You are God's
[1:00:36] people. Sometime you don't know who you
[1:00:38] are and take something to reveal to you
[1:00:41] who you are. I don't want to know well
[1:00:44] she didn't know she was a daughter of
[1:00:45] God. She didn't know she was a child of
[1:00:47] God. She didn't know her name was in the
[1:00:49] book. But Jesus took time off to come
[1:00:53] her way. And he didn't want to talk
[1:00:55] about all what she did. He wanted to
[1:00:58] show her there was a seed inside of her
[1:01:01] that was more important than all what
[1:01:03] she did. And if she could get a
[1:01:05] revelation of what was inside of her,
[1:01:07] what God put inside of her, it'll make a
[1:01:10] whole difference alto together and
[1:01:11] change her very life. So this evening I
[1:01:17] have this message as a tribute to
[1:01:18] Malachi 4. This is uh what I have this
[1:01:23] evening uh upon my heart and I want you
[1:01:27] all to stand and we want to go into the
[1:01:29] scriptures.
[1:01:31] But this message is dedicated
[1:01:33] to the testimony and
[1:01:36] life a tribute to William Marian Brand
[1:01:39] of Malachi 4 Elijah prophet. And the
[1:01:42] scriptures we have this evening is
[1:01:44] Matthew chapter
[1:01:45] 17 reading from verse 8 to 12 and Acts
[1:01:50] chapter 3 reading from verse 12 to 21.
[1:01:57] The title of the
[1:01:59] message is the times of the restitution
[1:02:02] of all
[1:02:04] things. That's the title. The times of
[1:02:07] the restitution of all things. And I
[1:02:10] have an inspiration. I will restore
[1:02:13] saith the
[1:02:14] Lord. Reading Matthew chapter 17,
[1:02:17] reading from verse 8. This is after
[1:02:20] Jesus was adopted on the
[1:02:22] mountain. And when Peter got an
[1:02:24] anointing to try to build three
[1:02:26] tabernacles, the voice had to shut him
[1:02:28] up and tell
[1:02:31] him to do nobody with that. And then
[1:02:35] they had lifted up their
[1:02:37] eyes. They saw no man save Jesus
[1:02:40] only. And as they came down the
[1:02:43] mountain, Jesus charged them, saying,
[1:02:47] "Tell the vision to no man until the Son
[1:02:50] of Man be risen again from the dead.
[1:02:53] And the disciples asked him, saying, Why
[1:02:56] then say the scribes that Elias must
[1:02:59] first come? And Jesus answered and said
[1:03:02] unto them, Elias truly shall first come
[1:03:07] and restore all things. But I say unto
[1:03:10] you, that Elas is come already, and they
[1:03:13] knew him not, but have done unto him,
[1:03:15] whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall
[1:03:19] also the son of man suffer of
[1:03:22] them. Acts chapter 3, we want to read
[1:03:25] from verse 12. This is after Peter
[1:03:29] raised the man up that was crippled at
[1:03:31] the gate called
[1:03:33] beautiful. And the people was looking at
[1:03:35] Peter. And then Peter, this is verse 12.
[1:03:37] And then Peter saw it. He answered unto
[1:03:40] the people, ye men of Israel, why marvey
[1:03:44] at this? or why look so earnestly on us
[1:03:49] as though by our own power or holiness
[1:03:52] we have made this man to walk. The God
[1:03:54] of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob,
[1:03:57] the God of our fathers had glorified his
[1:04:00] son Jesus whom you delivered up and
[1:04:03] denied him in the presence of Pilate
[1:04:05] when he was determined to let him go.
[1:04:07] But he denied the holy one and the just,
[1:04:11] and desired a murderer to be granted
[1:04:12] unto you, and killed the prince of life,
[1:04:16] whom God had raised from the dead,
[1:04:18] whereof we are witnesses. And his name,
[1:04:21] true faith in his name, had made this
[1:04:23] man strong, whom you see and know. Yay,
[1:04:26] the faith which is by him had given him
[1:04:29] this perfect soundness in the presence
[1:04:32] of you all. And now, brethren, I what
[1:04:36] that through ignorance he did it, as did
[1:04:39] also your rulers. But those things which
[1:04:42] God before had showed by the mouth of
[1:04:44] all his prophets, that Christ should
[1:04:47] suffer, he had so fulfilled.
[1:04:50] Repent ye therefore and be converted
[1:04:53] that your sins may be blotted out when
[1:04:56] the times of refreshing shall come from
[1:04:59] the presence of the Lord. And he shall
[1:05:01] send Jesus Christ which before was
[1:05:04] preached unto you. And this is where I
[1:05:07] get my thought from. whom the heaven
[1:05:09] must receive until the times of the
[1:05:14] restitution of all things which God had
[1:05:17] spoken by the mouth of all his holy
[1:05:20] prophets since the world began. Let's
[1:05:24] bow our heads with a
[1:05:25] prayer. Kind father, I pray that your
[1:05:28] holy spirit will come down in a special
[1:05:30] way. May your pillar of fire drop on my
[1:05:33] shoulder and speak lip to air to your
[1:05:35] people. You promise once more the world
[1:05:37] will hear direct from God. Speak to our
[1:05:39] hearts. We are such a needy people.
[1:05:41] Father, help us, edify us, build us,
[1:05:44] strengthen us, inspire us, anoint us,
[1:05:48] pour out upon us, confirm your word with
[1:05:50] signs, wonders, and miracles. We ask in
[1:05:53] Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated.
[1:05:56] Praise God.
[1:06:11] Brother Brandham from five
[1:06:13] identifications. He said you cannot
[1:06:15] organize a kingdom of which Christ is
[1:06:17] the head.
[1:06:20] You cannot denominate a kingdom which
[1:06:23] Christ is the head because Christ is
[1:06:27] king and you cannot take the
[1:06:29] intellectuals of man and make an
[1:06:32] organization to which Christ will
[1:06:34] govern.
[1:06:37] Therefore, any
[1:06:38] companies, any peoples, any groups of
[1:06:42] men that tries to organize the kingdom
[1:06:46] of God is going contrary to the king.
[1:06:50] And if they're going contrary to the
[1:06:52] king, it would be against the king. And
[1:06:55] if it's against the king, it will be
[1:06:57] Antichrist.
[1:06:59] Now, that's pretty rough.
[1:07:01] Antichrist
[1:07:03] spirit tries to take a people and call
[1:07:08] them from organization to organization,
[1:07:11] organizing them together, which never
[1:07:14] was the will of God. People has always
[1:07:18] fussed at me because I struck so hard at
[1:07:21] organizations. It isn't the people in
[1:07:24] there that I'm striking at. It's that
[1:07:27] dominating spirit that makes the people
[1:07:31] think we are the
[1:07:33] people. God's people is a called out
[1:07:36] people. I believe they are in every
[1:07:41] denomination. They could be Catholic.
[1:07:43] They could be Protestant. That was that
[1:07:45] time. In this time, it could be
[1:07:47] disinterpretation, that interpretation,
[1:07:50] that group, that country. It doesn't
[1:07:52] matter. They could be Jewish. There
[1:07:55] could be kind of what kind of church but
[1:07:57] the real church here we go is the
[1:07:59] mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:08:04] and you cannot organize the mystical
[1:08:08] body of Jesus Christ by inspiration by
[1:08:12] doctrine by teaching you still can't do
[1:08:14] it because it's a mystery it's the
[1:08:17] mystical body of Jesus Christ and by one
[1:08:20] spirit we are baptized into that one
[1:08:23] body
[1:08:24] Hallelujah.
[1:08:26] Hallelujah. And once you go into that
[1:08:29] body, nobody could take you out. Oh,
[1:08:32] give the Lord some praises,
[1:08:34] people. God's church is
[1:08:38] free. God church is bound by no
[1:08:42] boundaries. Every human being on earth
[1:08:45] belongs to him. Whether he is Catholic,
[1:08:48] Protestant, whatever he is, God seek
[1:08:52] those with an honest heart and we are
[1:08:55] saved by faith. Believe in him. Now you
[1:08:58] see the church is not an
[1:09:00] organization. I people ask he asked are
[1:09:03] you a Christian? Answer I'm a Baptist.
[1:09:07] That don't answer the question at all.
[1:09:11] Are you a Christian? I am Pentecost.
[1:09:14] That don't answer the question. If you
[1:09:17] are a Christian, you are a born again
[1:09:20] creature, you are a mystic kingdom of
[1:09:23] God, your eyes are not on the things of
[1:09:26] this world but on the things above. And
[1:09:29] that is the church. It is not an
[1:09:32] organization.
[1:09:34] It can never be an organization.
[1:09:37] This is the prophet. Take me on record.
[1:09:41] The church of the living God can never
[1:09:44] be any certain group.
[1:09:49] I want to say it again. The church, I'm
[1:09:53] not talking about your church. I am
[1:09:55] talking about the church of the living
[1:09:58] God. Jesus said, "Upon this rock, I will
[1:10:03] build my church and the gates of hell
[1:10:08] can't prevail against it." There is
[1:10:10] going to be a church, hallelujah,
[1:10:13] universal,
[1:10:15] international,
[1:10:17] governed by God, ruled by God, not
[1:10:21] message popes or bishops or potentiates
[1:10:25] and powers. Oh, hallelujah. A people
[1:10:30] that God has called out. Oh,
[1:10:33] hallelujah. Praise God. So, I say they
[1:10:37] take me on record. The church of the
[1:10:40] living God can never be any certain
[1:10:44] group. I don't care what that group
[1:10:46] teaches, what doctrine they have. It
[1:10:49] cannot be a certain group. It cannot be
[1:10:52] I have it, you don't have it. It cannot
[1:10:54] be this group here have the angel and
[1:10:56] this group don't have the angel. It
[1:10:58] cannot be this group is right and this
[1:11:00] is wrong. No, it's one spirit, one
[1:11:04] spirit, one Lord, one baptism, one God,
[1:11:09] one
[1:11:12] Elijah, one
[1:11:16] message. You may be seated.
[1:11:20] Restitution. The word it means the act
[1:11:25] of restoring to the rightful owner
[1:11:28] something that has been taken away,
[1:11:32] lost or surrendered.
[1:11:35] It also means a return to or restoration
[1:11:40] of a previous state or position. That's
[1:11:44] what the word restitution means.
[1:11:47] restoring to the rightful owner.
[1:11:49] Hallelujah. Now, brother in the south
[1:11:52] southeastern church age, I want to bring
[1:11:54] a backdrop here. He was speaking about
[1:11:57] Martin Luther was not the only one
[1:11:59] protesting the Catholic Church. There
[1:12:01] were others. God time was ripe for a
[1:12:05] definite move of the restoration of the
[1:12:08] church to an outpouring of the Holy
[1:12:11] Ghost at a later date. Watch. They had
[1:12:14] the written word but not the revealed
[1:12:17] word. This was the reformation period.
[1:12:21] God was about to take the church out
[1:12:25] from the depth of Satan of the dark ages
[1:12:29] into the depth of God. So God was doing
[1:12:32] a work to bring the church back because
[1:12:36] the heaven must receive Jesus until the
[1:12:40] restitution or the restoration of all
[1:12:43] things. So based upon this scripture, I
[1:12:46] am convinced that all things that has to
[1:12:50] be restored, all what the canker worm,
[1:12:53] all what the caterpillar, all what the
[1:12:56] locust, all what has been broken up,
[1:12:59] messed up in this message, God said I
[1:13:04] will restore. He didn't even ask you if
[1:13:08] you interested in restoration. It's not
[1:13:10] about you. It is his word. He said, He
[1:13:16] said, he said, I going to restore. Oh, I
[1:13:22] feel good
[1:13:23] tonight. That the restoration is
[1:13:26] on. The move for the bride is on.
[1:13:31] Hallelujah. Glory to God. From Lou
[1:13:34] Church, Brother
[1:13:36] Brham. Now watch the seventh eighth
[1:13:38] messenger. He's a prophet. Not only do
[1:13:41] we see this messenger coming here in
[1:13:42] Revelation 10:7, but we find the word
[1:13:46] speaks of Elijah before Jesus returns.
[1:13:49] And brother Brandon read the scripture.
[1:13:50] We read and the disciples ask him, "Why
[1:13:54] say the scribe, Elias must first come?"
[1:13:58] Because the teachers and the preachers,
[1:13:59] they preaching this. Elias must first
[1:14:02] come and watch and restore all things
[1:14:07] before the coming of our Lord. Elijah
[1:14:10] must come back for a work of restoration
[1:14:14] of the church. Then he quote Malachi 4
[1:14:16] scripture. Scripture we familiar with.
[1:14:18] Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[1:14:19] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:14:21] and dreadful day of the Lord. And he
[1:14:22] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[1:14:24] the children and the hearts of the
[1:14:26] children to their fathers. Least I come
[1:14:28] and smite the earth with a curse. There
[1:14:30] is absolutely no doubt
[1:14:34] Elijah must return before the coming of
[1:14:37] Jesus. He has a specific work to
[1:14:43] accomplish. That work is in Malachi 4:6
[1:14:47] that says he will turn the hearts of the
[1:14:52] children back to the fathers. So that's
[1:14:57] job. That's his job description. He
[1:15:00] didn't come for us to have message
[1:15:02] churches all over the world. He didn't
[1:15:05] come for us to give out books and tapes.
[1:15:07] He came specifically to turn the hearts
[1:15:10] of the children back to the faith of the
[1:15:13] fathers. So every book, every tape,
[1:15:16] every message, the objective of that is
[1:15:19] to turn your heart to turn our hearts
[1:15:23] back to the faith, not church. The
[1:15:27] faith, not a faith. The faith. There is
[1:15:31] only one faith.
[1:15:41] Let's continue. Amen. Loud and change.
[1:15:44] Now, this messenger of Malachi 4 and
[1:15:48] Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[1:15:51] things. Yes, sir.
[1:15:53] Amen.
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:15:59] Not 50 things,
[1:16:02] not a 100 things, two things.
[1:16:09] One, according to Malachi 4, he will
[1:16:13] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:16:15] fathers. Two, he will reveal the
[1:16:20] mysteries of the seven thunders of
[1:16:22] Revelation 10, which are the
[1:16:26] revelations contained in the seven
[1:16:29] seals. It will be
[1:16:33] It will be these divinely revealed
[1:16:38] mystery truths that would literally Yes,
[1:16:41] sir. Literally,
[1:16:44] literal more. Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:16:47] Hallelujah.
[1:16:49] Literally turn the hearts of the
[1:16:52] children back to the father.
[1:16:58] Amen.
[1:17:00] Exactly.
[1:17:01] So the prophet for the last age,
[1:17:05] here we go, must be bringing a message
[1:17:07] from God that will foreign the second
[1:17:10] coming of the Lord. Yes, sir. for his
[1:17:12] message will with the heart of the
[1:17:14] throne return back to the Pentecostal
[1:17:15] fathers. Here we go. Are you ready? And
[1:17:19] with the restoration of the word will
[1:17:22] come restoration the restoration of
[1:17:24] power. Yes, sir.
[1:17:27] Hallelujah.
[1:17:29] Amen. Hallelujah. May be seated.
[1:17:32] Remember
[1:17:35] the Pentecostal received dynamics,
[1:17:40] but it didn't produce the fruit of
[1:17:43] restoration because they didn't have the
[1:17:45] word.
[1:17:48] So you can receive spirit without word.
[1:17:52] Hallelujah. They had gifts. They had
[1:17:54] signs and wonders. Yes sir. They had
[1:17:56] miracles. But they couldn't go on to
[1:17:58] adoption
[1:18:00] which is what brother Brham come to
[1:18:02] introduce.
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:06] Amen. He came to introduce the age of
[1:18:09] adoption
[1:18:14] because this restoration is to return us
[1:18:18] back to Eden.
[1:18:21] This restoration is to turn us back to
[1:18:24] what Adam had.
[1:18:28] And Adam had the book.
[1:18:34] Adam had the book. But when Adam fell,
[1:18:39] he lost it.
[1:18:42] And that book went in the hands of the
[1:18:44] original owner. Yes, sir. So this is
[1:18:47] Genesis here. This is Adam losing the
[1:18:50] book here. And the book stays up there
[1:18:53] until the end of time. A Elijah
[1:18:56] messenger coming here to wait for the
[1:18:59] book. A mighty angel have to take the
[1:19:02] book, bring down the book, open the book
[1:19:08] for you to see your name.
[1:19:20] You may be
[1:19:21] seated. So I can't share with you just
[1:19:27] Bible stuff or or just you know
[1:19:31] information about the Pope about Time
[1:19:34] magazine about what happened in America
[1:19:37] or or Venus and Mars and the
[1:19:39] constellation and and Pluto means this
[1:19:42] and and this one and what could it be
[1:19:45] this and could it be this? I'm not here
[1:19:47] with could it be Abraham didn't come
[1:19:49] with could it be he come with thus
[1:19:51] sayeth the Lord.
[1:19:55] Hallelujah.
[1:19:57] Listen to what the Bible said. Behold, I
[1:19:59] send you Elijah before the great and
[1:20:01] terrible day of the Lord, and he shall
[1:20:03] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:20:05] the faith of the fathers. Oh,
[1:20:08] hallelujah. I say unto you, Elias is
[1:20:11] already come.
[1:20:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I say unto you,
[1:20:23] he has already come and he has done his
[1:20:26] job. So the restoration of the word
[1:20:29] means the restoration of the power.
[1:20:32] Before Elijah could come to his message,
[1:20:34] he had to tab the loose ends. That's
[1:20:36] what he said. The Malachi 4, Elijah, the
[1:20:39] seventh angel had no certain message,
[1:20:41] but his job was to tab the loose ends.
[1:20:43] So he said Elijah prophet had to open
[1:20:44] six seals because Christ was the seventh
[1:20:46] seal. Malachi 4, a son of man could only
[1:20:49] open six seals because Christ himself
[1:20:51] was the seventh seal. So Elijah come and
[1:20:54] tap the loose to talk about the pope and
[1:20:56] Catholic church and all these different
[1:20:58] kind of things. That's what he did.
[1:21:00] Isn't that right? Hallelujah. When he
[1:21:03] finished, he's ready for his message,
[1:21:05] which was the seventh seal. The first
[1:21:07] three seals history. Fourth seal is
[1:21:10] prophecy. Fifth seal is souls under the
[1:21:12] altar. Six seals in judgment. Where are
[1:21:14] you at?
[1:21:16] Hallelujah. So God take a bride, listen
[1:21:19] and slip her under the seven seal.
[1:21:21] Silence only for half an hour. Half an
[1:21:24] hour is fixed. Only half an hour, but
[1:21:26] that silence is about to be broken.
[1:21:28] Amen. And we will see the contents of
[1:21:31] what was under that seventh seal. Oh,
[1:21:33] hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus. Oh,
[1:21:36] blessed be the name of the Lord. So,
[1:21:38] let's continue. The age started off in
[1:21:40] the 20th century as it was the age but
[1:21:43] as it was to be the age in which the
[1:21:46] true church would return to being the
[1:21:49] bride she was at
[1:21:51] Pentecost. We know that there must be
[1:21:54] necessarily a return to dynamic power.
[1:21:56] We know that we have to go back to
[1:21:58] dynamic power. That's that's the
[1:22:01] promise.
[1:22:03] Watch the believers sensed this in their
[1:22:06] spirits and began crying to God for a
[1:22:10] new outpouring in the first
[1:22:13] century. What seemed to be the answer
[1:22:16] came as many began to speak in tongues
[1:22:19] and manifest gifts of the spirit. It was
[1:22:22] then believed that this was indeed the
[1:22:25] long awaited restoration. It was not for
[1:22:29] here we go. The latter rain can only
[1:22:33] come after the former rain which is the
[1:22:37] spring or teaching rain. The latter rain
[1:22:41] is the harvest rain. How could this be
[1:22:43] the real thing when the teaching rain
[1:22:46] had not come? The prophet messenger who
[1:22:51] was to be sent to teach the people and
[1:22:54] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:22:57] Pentecostal fathers had not yet come.
[1:23:01] Thus what was thought to be the
[1:23:04] restoration. Here it is. Here it is.
[1:23:06] Here it is. What was thought to be the
[1:23:10] restoration and the final quickening
[1:23:13] unto the rapture
[1:23:15] had not come.
[1:23:18] In it was a mixture of the unrighteous
[1:23:22] partaking of spiritual blessing and
[1:23:25] manifesting in the Holy Ghost. It is
[1:23:28] also devil power as men were under the
[1:23:32] controls of devils yet no one seemed to
[1:23:35] realize it. Then to prove it was not
[1:23:39] real. These people second generation
[1:23:43] organized and wrote on scriptural
[1:23:45] doctrines. Here we go. And build their
[1:23:48] own fences as every other group ahead
[1:23:51] have done. And this is what doctrine
[1:23:53] does. It builds
[1:23:56] fences instead of bridges. It build
[1:23:58] walls. We believe this so we can
[1:24:01] fellowship with you. We believe this so
[1:24:03] I can come to your convention. We
[1:24:05] believe this. That's what doctrine does.
[1:24:07] It build walls. And God promised to send
[1:24:10] some rain. And that rain going to fall
[1:24:12] so much the ducks will begin to swim and
[1:24:16] they're going to raise above every wall.
[1:24:18] I will
[1:24:20] restore sayeth the Lord. Not by might,
[1:24:25] not by power, but by my spirit. Sayeth
[1:24:29] the Lord God
[1:24:30] Almighty. Hallelujah.
[1:24:34] Glory. So then Joel 2 said, "All the
[1:24:37] floor shall be full of wheat. Fat shall
[1:24:40] overflow with wine and oil." Oh, this is
[1:24:41] a prophecy. All the time was barren. All
[1:24:44] the time was hardship. But God said,
[1:24:47] "The fat shall overflow, and the wine
[1:24:49] will overflow. And I will restore to you
[1:24:51] the years. The locust had eaten, the
[1:24:53] candle worm, the caterpillar, and
[1:24:55] palmer, my great am I send among you,
[1:24:57] and you shall eat in plenty, and be
[1:24:59] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:25:01] Lord your God that I dress want to sleep
[1:25:04] with you, and my people shall never be
[1:25:06] ashamed." Now, it says God is going to
[1:25:08] restore. The Lutheran church did not
[1:25:10] restore. It started reformation. The
[1:25:13] Wesian age did not restore. The
[1:25:15] Pentecostal age did not restore. But God
[1:25:18] has to restore. This is not the
[1:25:21] resurrection of the church. It is the
[1:25:24] restoration. God, here we go. Will take
[1:25:27] the church right back to Pentecost.
[1:25:30] I believe that. Do you believe that?
[1:25:33] Hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus. Now,
[1:25:36] watch. Remember Malachi 4, the message
[1:25:39] cometh before the terrible of the Lord.
[1:25:41] He said all denominations and creeds eat
[1:25:44] it down. God said, "I will restore it
[1:25:46] again in the last days and it will be
[1:25:48] restored." Here we go.
[1:25:51] God shall send the Holy Ghost
[1:25:55] in such a way. Note, he did not say God
[1:25:59] shall shall send doctrines
[1:26:02] and teachings in such a way. No, he did
[1:26:05] not say that. We have a lot of doctrines
[1:26:07] and teachings. He did not say that. He
[1:26:09] said God will send the Holy Ghost in
[1:26:14] such a way upon planted word
[1:26:19] that will restore.
[1:26:22] What's the secret? The word is in the
[1:26:26] bride. That's the secret. That was
[1:26:30] always the secret.
[1:26:31] God was always putting the word in the
[1:26:34] bride by books, by tips, by preachers,
[1:26:37] by messages. The word coming into the
[1:26:39] bride because the mystery of God come
[1:26:41] down from God as the word of God. So as
[1:26:44] you receive the word, you receive the
[1:26:45] mystery.
[1:26:47] I am not hearing you. I will say it
[1:26:49] again. The mystery of God comes down
[1:26:53] from God as the word of God. So as you
[1:26:56] receive the word, you receive the
[1:26:59] mystery and Christ is the mystery.
[1:27:03] Oh, give the Lord a shout. Give the Lord
[1:27:06] some praises.
[1:27:14] And we will always know when people get
[1:27:18] revelation. You see when it's just
[1:27:19] intellectual, shake your head, do like
[1:27:22] that. Amen. Glory.
[1:27:24] But when revelation breaks, it brings
[1:27:26] stimulation. You see, revelation is
[1:27:29] whine. Revelations make you stagger.
[1:27:32] Revelation make you shout. You can't
[1:27:34] cross your leg with revelation. That's
[1:27:36] that's no revelation. That is no
[1:27:39] revelation whatsoever. But once you get
[1:27:42] revelation, when Jesus told that woman,
[1:27:45] go call your husband, she said, I have
[1:27:47] none, but the one he said you want to
[1:27:49] live with is not yours. And when Jesus
[1:27:51] finished with her and said, "I am he,"
[1:27:54] she ran. She couldn't walk. Okay, Jesus.
[1:27:58] Okay. Thank you, Jesus. No. No. No. No.
[1:28:00] No. No. No. She couldn't do that. She
[1:28:02] began to run. Come see a man.
[1:28:06] Come see a man. Come see a
[1:28:13] man.
[1:28:17] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:23] Glory to God. But you know what wrong in
[1:28:26] this message? The Bible said knowledge
[1:28:28] shall increase. Knowledge shall
[1:28:30] increase. It's so much of books. It's so
[1:28:33] much that tapes. It's so much
[1:28:34] information that people don't get in the
[1:28:36] spirit. But when John got in the spirit,
[1:28:39] Bible said John said I was in the spirit
[1:28:41] and suddenly a door open from heaven.
[1:28:43] When John when they get in the spirit
[1:28:45] and that's what the worship is for.
[1:28:47] That's why the devil hate worship.
[1:28:49] People intellectual want information
[1:28:51] writing down notes. Throw your note
[1:28:52] cards aside. Forget about the notes. You
[1:28:56] don't need to
[1:28:57] note. You don't need to write nothing
[1:29:00] down. You need to worship.
[1:29:04] Honor, glory, might, power, dominion
[1:29:09] unto the Lamb
[1:29:11] [Applause]
[1:29:15] forever.
[1:29:22] Feel like dancing now. Feel like dancing
[1:29:25] now. My God. Hallelujah.
[1:29:28] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:29:31] Yes, sir. May be seated. Praise God. My
[1:29:34] Lord, when when when Peter told that man
[1:29:37] he was lame. Silver and gold have I
[1:29:39] none. That's the faith, you know.
[1:29:43] It didn't say and Peter was walking the
[1:29:45] gate called beautiful and he hand him a
[1:29:47] book and say read
[1:29:50] that. It didn't say play a tape. Listen
[1:29:53] to that. No, that wasn't the faith. The
[1:29:56] faith was silver and gold. But I don't
[1:29:58] have I don't have that. But I've got
[1:30:00] something such as I have. I could
[1:30:02] release it. I could give it. Yes. Yes. I
[1:30:05] could give it. Rise up and walk in the
[1:30:08] name of Jesus Christ. That's the faith.
[1:30:10] And you know what that man begin to do?
[1:30:12] He begin to jump and leap and praise
[1:30:15] God. Maybe you never sin enough. Maybe
[1:30:18] you never was down in hell. Maybe you
[1:30:20] never was in trouble enough to begin to
[1:30:22] praise and thank your God.
[1:30:27] One of one of the sickest thing to see
[1:30:29] is ministers that don't want to worship.
[1:30:32] That's one of the sickest things to see.
[1:30:34] Ministers that can't praise God and
[1:30:36] can't worship and can't thank God. You
[1:30:37] get trouble in heaven. You get trouble
[1:30:40] across there. You know about raptoring
[1:30:42] condition. You may be seated. The
[1:30:44] astronauts what brother Isaac was
[1:30:46] talking about before they go up there
[1:30:49] they have to rehearse down here. They
[1:30:51] have to go in the atmosphere of where
[1:30:53] they are going. And if you want to go to
[1:30:56] heaven if you want to go to up there you
[1:30:58] have to rehearse down here.
[1:31:04] Thousands time thousands.
[1:31:06] Amen. Angels worship the four beasts.
[1:31:10] Worship living creatures worship the
[1:31:13] elders worship. Angels worship.
[1:31:28] Hallelujah.
[1:31:29] You can't expect to go over yonder
[1:31:31] without any atmosphere. Even the
[1:31:34] disciples have to wait for an
[1:31:35] atmosphere. They were in the upper room
[1:31:37] creating atmosphere because Holy Ghost
[1:31:39] can't come on dry. Holy Ghost can't come
[1:31:41] on dry. They were praising God
[1:31:43] continually. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:31:46] Hallelujah. Hal. They were praising God
[1:31:49] continually. They were praising
[1:31:52] God. If it don't feel like it, praise
[1:31:54] God. Your hand don't want to go up, push
[1:31:56] it up. Say hallelujah. Praise. Glory to
[1:32:00] God.
[1:32:13] I'm not hearing you.
[1:32:16] I'm not hearing you.
[1:32:18] I'm not hearing you. I want to hear
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:27] you. Let me be seated.
[1:32:30] Amen. How you going to sing the song of
[1:32:32] the redeemed
[1:32:34] thou has redeemed us by thy blood. A
[1:32:38] holy ghost fil man John he wept because
[1:32:42] no man was found worthy. Angel was
[1:32:44] worthy but he needed a man a kings man.
[1:32:47] All of a sudden out of eternity the lamb
[1:32:50] stepped forward and took the book not
[1:32:54] for himself nor for his wife. He took
[1:32:58] the book and he begin to release that
[1:33:00] book and begin to break the seals. And
[1:33:02] John say all in heaven, all on the
[1:33:05] earth. All John start to go in different
[1:33:08] dimensions. His voice, his worship, his
[1:33:12] praise start to break in different
[1:33:15] dimensions. All on the earth. All under
[1:33:18] the earth. heard. I praise God when the
[1:33:21] lamb took the book because we shall
[1:33:24] reign on the earth. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:33:35] [Applause]
[1:33:46] Wow.
[1:33:51] You believe that all those believers up
[1:33:53] there want to stay up there? That is not
[1:33:55] their promise. Their promise is back to
[1:33:58] the earth. And if we have to reign up
[1:34:00] there, we have to demonstrate it down
[1:34:02] here. That's why God put Adam to control
[1:34:05] the beast of the field and everything
[1:34:07] else. And to show the book has been
[1:34:09] restored, God led brother Brandham to
[1:34:11] face a killer bull out in the field. He
[1:34:15] got his gun is a killer bull. The bull
[1:34:17] had a reputation. It's not a a waving
[1:34:20] bull. It's a killer bull. That's right.
[1:34:23] And brother Brandon fought him caught
[1:34:25] found himself caught in that field
[1:34:27] dealing with this killer bull. And he
[1:34:29] says something came over him. It wasn't
[1:34:31] doctrine came over him. It wasn't a
[1:34:33] teaching came over him. No, something
[1:34:36] came over him. It was love. It was the
[1:34:39] spirit of God. Something came over him.
[1:34:42] Something. This something is what we
[1:34:44] talking about. Though I know all
[1:34:46] mysteries, though I understand all
[1:34:48] mysteries, though I have all knowledge,
[1:34:50] though I give my body to be burned, I
[1:34:52] could know new name mystery, seven
[1:34:53] thunder, mystery, mystery of the trump,
[1:34:55] mystery, the vile, the plagues, the
[1:34:56] woes, every mystery, hidden mystery,
[1:34:58] written hidden mystery, all kind of
[1:34:59] mystery. If I don't have the love of
[1:35:01] God, I am nothing. It will take perfect
[1:35:03] love to go across there.
[1:35:05] Glory to God. You may be seated. And I
[1:35:08] have news for you. The killer bull is
[1:35:11] not found in church.
[1:35:15] You don't find the killable getting in a
[1:35:16] seat in church. No, you find the killer
[1:35:18] on the outside. So what you come to
[1:35:20] church for is to equip you to deal with
[1:35:22] what is on the outside. God going to
[1:35:25] have a powerful bride. A bride going to
[1:35:27] be restored back just like the day of
[1:35:29] Pentecost. An original bride. There were
[1:35:31] cowards in the upper room. But notice
[1:35:33] what happened when the Holy Ghost came.
[1:35:34] Peter slammed the door open. Hallelujah.
[1:35:37] My God. They can't wait to get outside.
[1:35:40] They can't wait to testify. You know
[1:35:42] why? Jesus said, "You shall receive
[1:35:44] power after the Holy Ghost come upon you
[1:35:47] and
[1:35:48] you shall be witnesses unto me."
[1:35:53] Amen.
[1:35:55] So when the Holy Ghost came, it brought
[1:35:57] witnessing power. Power to declare God,
[1:36:01] present tense. Oh, glory to God. So you
[1:36:05] stand there and say, "Peter, you're
[1:36:07] cursed." That's right. You deny Christ.
[1:36:09] That's right. But I have something you
[1:36:10] don't have.
[1:36:13] Because I just come out the upper room.
[1:36:16] So you can talk about me all that you
[1:36:18] please. I will talk about you on my
[1:36:21] knees because my sins are under the
[1:36:24] blood. I've been redeemed. Oh, give the
[1:36:27] Lord a shout in the house. Let the
[1:36:30] redeemed say so. Oh, glory to God. Let
[1:36:33] the redeemed say so.
[1:36:40] God will send the Holy Ghost in such a
[1:36:43] way. You see the prophet say you could
[1:36:45] get enough Holy Ghost to say I'm saved
[1:36:47] and if I surrender now you can get more
[1:36:49] Holy Ghost until signs and wonders till
[1:36:51] God begin to come out your very body.
[1:36:54] That's the power of virtue because you
[1:36:56] see brother Brandham restored
[1:36:58] back. Wow. He released the spirit of
[1:37:01] prophecy. Isn't that right? We have
[1:37:04] received the testimony of Jesus which is
[1:37:06] the spirit of prophecy. Isn't that
[1:37:08] right? What brother Brandon brought was
[1:37:10] a prophetic vision. Many ministers and
[1:37:12] many people haven't caught that. He
[1:37:14] brought an actual vision. The vision is
[1:37:16] what makes the difference. The vision
[1:37:18] gives you an oversight, a complete
[1:37:20] picture. And the vision means a
[1:37:22] restoration of the ministry of Jesus
[1:37:24] Christ. Not man ministry, this brother
[1:37:27] ministry, that brother ministry. We're
[1:37:28] not talking about that. We had it for 50
[1:37:30] years.
[1:37:31] We want the ministry of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:35] Oh, could we get a shout in the house?
[1:37:38] That's the promise. The prophetic vision
[1:37:41] identifies the restoration of the
[1:37:43] ministry of Jesus Christ amongst the
[1:37:45] people.
[1:37:47] When Baram says the world will hear
[1:37:49] direct from God. He said, "How shall we
[1:37:51] know it's the voice of God? Back then it
[1:37:53] wasn't a vindicated prophet. How shall
[1:37:55] we know the voice of God today?
[1:37:58] It will be a manifestation of the
[1:38:01] prophet's word. So we are supposed to
[1:38:04] say this is that that the prophet
[1:38:07] William Brandham spake of
[1:38:12] not what we speak what the prophet
[1:38:15] spoke. That's what Peter did. This is
[1:38:17] that the prophet Joel.
[1:38:22] Yes sir. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:38:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:38:30] Listen friends, we are promised a seven
[1:38:32] thunder revival. You may be seated. He
[1:38:35] said the bride hadn't had a revival yet.
[1:38:39] It will take those seven thunders to
[1:38:43] wake her up again. It will take
[1:38:47] amen. Amen. Who said that? Brother
[1:38:50] Brandham said that. You thought a man
[1:38:53] from somewhere else said that. No. The
[1:38:56] prophet said seven dolls give faith. I
[1:38:59] didn't say that. He said say what the
[1:39:01] tape say. He said the seven dolls will
[1:39:03] gather the bride together. That's not my
[1:39:05] words. That's his words. He said the
[1:39:08] seven thunder will show the right how to
[1:39:09] prepare. That's not my word. That's his
[1:39:11] word. He said wait till them seven
[1:39:13] thunders utter them voices to that
[1:39:15] group. They're going to shut the heaven.
[1:39:17] They could open the heavens. Oh yes.
[1:39:19] Heaven could open up tonight.
[1:39:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. heaven could
[1:39:25] open up tonight.
[1:39:30] Those are not my words. Those are his
[1:39:33] words. Oh my. Praise God. What has to be
[1:39:39] restored? Amen. What was lost to begin
[1:39:42] with? Brother preach. When Adam lost his
[1:39:46] life, he lost his inheritance in life
[1:39:51] because he had supreme control of the
[1:39:52] earth. He was a god of the earth, small
[1:39:55] G. God was the god of the universe, big
[1:39:58] G, and everywhere. But his son had the
[1:40:02] earth under his control. He could speak,
[1:40:06] he could name, he could say, he could
[1:40:09] stop nature, he could do anything he
[1:40:11] wanted to. Let's go back to the bull.
[1:40:13] When B say bull go and slide down there,
[1:40:16] that was Adam again
[1:40:18] having power over the beast of the
[1:40:20] field. Amen.
[1:40:22] So that has been vindicated.
[1:40:26] Amen.
[1:40:28] Hallelujah. So Adam just not only lost
[1:40:30] his life, he lost his inheritance in
[1:40:32] life. So when Adam when Adam fell and he
[1:40:35] tried to access the power, he saw
[1:40:38] something on the screen mark access
[1:40:39] denied.
[1:40:45] Access denied all the time. I am yet
[1:40:49] free access but now access denied.
[1:40:52] Angels guard the tree of life. Adam
[1:40:55] escorted out of the garden of Eden.
[1:40:59] That was in the beginning. But in this
[1:41:02] last day, angel escorting the bride back
[1:41:06] to Eden.
[1:41:08] You're getting full access.
[1:41:12] Did you get that? The same works I do
[1:41:16] shall you do also. That's full access if
[1:41:20] you shall say to the mountain be moved
[1:41:23] and don't doubt. That's full access. The
[1:41:26] bride going to have full access to all
[1:41:28] what Jesus had. Hallelujah. So Adam lost
[1:41:33] his inheritance. Brother adoption.
[1:41:36] Somebody has to leave you something to
[1:41:39] inherit it. Is that right? An
[1:41:41] inheritance do we have? What inheritance
[1:41:43] did I have? I didn't have any. But God
[1:41:46] left me an inheritance when he put my
[1:41:48] name on the lamb's book of life before
[1:41:50] the foundation of the world. You say,
[1:41:52] "Now wait a minute, brother. Jesus did
[1:41:55] that when he died for me." No, he never.
[1:41:57] Jesus come to purchase that inheritance
[1:41:59] from me. Read the next verse. In whom we
[1:42:03] obtain an inheritance being
[1:42:05] predestinated according to his own
[1:42:07] goodwill. Look, predestinated us unto
[1:42:10] his inheritance. If I'm a right
[1:42:13] inheritance of something, if God is
[1:42:15] knocking on my heart and say, "William
[1:42:16] Brandham, I called you a long time ago
[1:42:20] before the foundation of the world to
[1:42:22] preach the gospel. I have an
[1:42:24] inheritance, an inheritance of eternal
[1:42:26] life. God sent Jesus to make that
[1:42:31] inheritance real to me because there was
[1:42:34] nothing I could inherit it. It was
[1:42:36] blank. But Jesus the lamb slain. Here we
[1:42:40] go. From the foundation of the world,
[1:42:42] his blood was shed that I may go to my
[1:42:45] inheritance to be what? What
[1:42:46] inheritance? To sunship.
[1:42:49] To be a son of God. To be a son of God.
[1:42:52] Not not what we are right now. This is
[1:42:54] fallen man. Son of God is attribute sons
[1:42:57] of his spirit. That way son of God is
[1:43:00] Jesus Christ. So he came to call other
[1:43:02] sons that didn't even know they were
[1:43:03] sons. Peter come. John come. James come.
[1:43:07] He was calling them. They didn't know
[1:43:08] what they were being called unto, but he
[1:43:10] was calling them. He was calling them to
[1:43:12] positionally place them for a manifest
[1:43:15] manifestation. God called you not just
[1:43:18] to sit on on a church bench, not to sit
[1:43:20] into church. God called you to be a
[1:43:22] manifested son.
[1:43:28] There you may be seated. The five-fold
[1:43:31] ministry is temporary. You know,
[1:43:34] I hear so much about fivefold and
[1:43:36] fivefold and fivefold and who in the
[1:43:38] fold, who not in the fold, and
[1:43:39] everything else. But that five-fold
[1:43:41] ministry is until we all come.
[1:43:45] Hallelujah.
[1:43:47] To the unity of the faith, to the
[1:43:49] knowledge of the son of God, unto a
[1:43:51] perfect man. In other words, you going
[1:43:53] to know who you are.
[1:43:56] You're going to know where you come
[1:43:56] from. You're going to know where you're
[1:43:58] going. Then afterwards, they don't know
[1:44:00] man to teach you. Afterwards, all the
[1:44:02] ministers going to edify the body
[1:44:04] because you will come into a perfect
[1:44:05] realization of where you come from and
[1:44:08] where you're going. You'll be in a state
[1:44:09] of perfection. What man you need over
[1:44:11] your life? What man do you need to rule
[1:44:14] you? When you come into that perfect
[1:44:16] oneness with God.
[1:44:23] So what man lost was his sunship, his
[1:44:27] inheritance. That's what the book is all
[1:44:29] about. So it's not a difficult message.
[1:44:31] Ministers sometime make it complex. Not
[1:44:34] God in complexity. It's God in
[1:44:36] simplicity. That book held the mystery
[1:44:40] of our names. That book held the mystery
[1:44:43] of our inheritance. All was sealed up in
[1:44:45] that book. Oh my. Watch. This may just
[1:44:50] choke you. But did you know that that
[1:44:52] men that are sons of God are amateur
[1:44:54] gods? How many knows that? Watch. They
[1:44:57] were gods. They had full domain,
[1:44:58] dominion over the world. He gave them
[1:45:00] dominion over all things. He lost his
[1:45:02] godship. He lost his sunship. He lost
[1:45:05] his domain. And Satan took it over. But
[1:45:07] brother, here what we're waiting for. We
[1:45:08] are waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:45:11] sons of I love that. You are waiting for
[1:45:13] for conventions and churches and groups
[1:45:15] and so on and notices of what we have.
[1:45:17] No, no, no. You're waiting for the
[1:45:19] manifestation of the sons of God. Who
[1:45:22] are they? They are around the world.
[1:45:25] Did you hear that?
[1:45:26] They are around the world. So if
[1:45:29] somebody think they are the only pebble
[1:45:30] on the beach, something is wrong. I am
[1:45:33] the only man of the man of the hour.
[1:45:35] Forget about it. Forget about it. Get
[1:45:37] next to yourself, brother. Brother
[1:45:38] Brandham said God could only find one
[1:45:42] man in the day of Elijah. One man. But
[1:45:47] because here we go. Because it's harvest
[1:45:50] time, he has to find many men. Because
[1:45:53] it's harvest time.
[1:45:56] So we don't need less men. We need more
[1:45:59] men. We need more sons. We need more
[1:46:03] preachers. We need more sent ones. We
[1:46:06] need more anointed man of God.
[1:46:09] Hallelujah. We need men that heard from
[1:46:12] God that will go to the angel and take
[1:46:16] the book and eat the book and prophesy
[1:46:20] from the book.
[1:46:22] [Applause]
[1:46:28] But see, it's hard to deal with that
[1:46:29] that way. You see, because we gone
[1:46:31] through 2,000 of the national years. So,
[1:46:33] what people know is church pastors and
[1:46:35] preachers and people teaching Bible
[1:46:36] night stories and whatnot. The Bible was
[1:46:38] a sealed book until brother Brandham
[1:46:41] come. All the years people preaching,
[1:46:43] they were preaching from the book was
[1:46:45] sealed. It took a prophet to unseal it.
[1:46:48] That's where we get our message from. A
[1:46:50] book that has been unsealed. The mighty
[1:46:53] angel brought down the book. Not closed.
[1:46:55] It brought down the book open. That
[1:46:58] means all seven seals were ripped off.
[1:47:01] Down come the angel with the book open.
[1:47:07] Hallelujah.
[1:47:09] Hallelujah. The book is on the earth.
[1:47:13] [Applause]
[1:47:14] Adam is on the earth.
[1:47:20] The sons of God are coming back.
[1:47:23] The sons of God are coming back. The
[1:47:26] sons of God are coming back. Amen.
[1:47:33] Amen. Brother, he demonstrated what we
[1:47:36] have for the journey on our way to the
[1:47:38] rapture. He demonstrated it. Son, come
[1:47:42] out and shine four days.
[1:47:44] Power over the element before the
[1:47:46] doctors and touches my wife the tumor
[1:47:48] will go down. Spoken word healing.
[1:47:50] Sister hearty right. I give you your
[1:47:52] boys. Spoken word salvation. He
[1:47:55] demonstrated little fishy. I give you
[1:47:57] back your life. Resurrection power. He
[1:47:59] demon. Listen. This is already
[1:48:01] vindicated. Lord. We don't need nobody
[1:48:04] to say it is. It's wonder if it's so. It
[1:48:06] has already been vindicated.
[1:48:10] That's a vindication. The book has been
[1:48:13] restored.
[1:48:16] I will restore.
[1:48:22] So what Barra did, he restored the bride
[1:48:25] to the full word, the token by prophecy.
[1:48:34] Hallelujah. Elijah already, you know,
[1:48:36] human be sees it. It come like a
[1:48:38] computer program. The program is
[1:48:40] written. It just waiting to press
[1:48:43] run at the appointed time. You just
[1:48:45] click and everything begin to unfold out
[1:48:48] of that program. When Adam was when Adam
[1:48:51] was in the earth, God was so pleased to
[1:48:53] get somebody to talk to, somebody to
[1:48:56] fellowship with. God was so happy, so
[1:48:58] pleased. Brother Ziggma, at last he had
[1:49:00] a son expressed in his image and
[1:49:02] likeness. Every evening come down with
[1:49:05] cool in the evening, talk to his son,
[1:49:07] Adam, how was your day? Father, it's so
[1:49:10] good. I shifted this mountain 30° to
[1:49:13] this way. And I sent that river 10 miles
[1:49:15] down to the left. Adam was having a
[1:49:18] great time shifting things around and
[1:49:20] moving things around and naming things
[1:49:22] around, having power over this and power
[1:49:24] over that. And God say, "It's not good
[1:49:26] for you to be alone, man. You need
[1:49:27] somebody with you. I'm going to get a
[1:49:29] wife for you. I'm going to get a bride
[1:49:30] for you. I'm going to pull something out
[1:49:32] of you, man." And God put him to sleep.
[1:49:34] He put silence. He put him in silence.
[1:49:36] And for half an hour, just making a
[1:49:37] type. And afterwards, he pulled
[1:49:39] something out of there. And when Adam
[1:49:40] saw her, he said, "You are flesh of my
[1:49:42] flesh. You are bone of my bone. You
[1:49:44] shall be called woman because you would
[1:49:45] take me out of man." Oh, hallelujah.
[1:49:48] Praise God. What a beautiful picture in
[1:49:50] the Garden of Eden. I let I want you to
[1:49:52] notice that man fell.
[1:49:58] It wasn't a boy he put in the Garden of
[1:50:00] Eden. He put a man and the man fell. So
[1:50:05] God said, "I'm going to reboot.
[1:50:09] I'm going to reboot this whole system.
[1:50:11] I'm going to bring babe. I'm going to
[1:50:13] bring on something called the process of
[1:50:15] character development.
[1:50:19] Because I don't need no test to get what
[1:50:21] he got. I don't need no trial to get
[1:50:24] what he got. God just give him and place
[1:50:26] him and it didn't work. Oh, give the
[1:50:30] Lord a shout. Give the Lord a shout. God
[1:50:34] just placed him and it did not work.
[1:50:38] That man fell. So God say, "You know
[1:50:40] what? I'm going to reboot. I'm going to
[1:50:42] bring a babe. I'm going to bring
[1:50:43] testing. I'm going to bring child, the
[1:50:45] child of your faith. I'm going to bring
[1:50:47] testing to give you character. Character
[1:50:49] is not a gift. Character is a victory.
[1:50:52] So I'm going to send you process."
[1:50:57] So here come Jesus. Here come Jesus.
[1:51:01] Holy Ghost fell on
[1:51:03] him. Full anointing fell on him. And
[1:51:06] immediately, first phase, first move,
[1:51:10] first thing, print some business cards
[1:51:12] to say, "I am Jesus." No, no business
[1:51:15] cards yet. First thing was to send him
[1:51:18] into the wilderness to overcome the lust
[1:51:21] of the eyes, lust of the flesh, pride of
[1:51:24] life. In other words, send him in the
[1:51:26] wilderness to overcome himself. Before
[1:51:30] God could give you power over others and
[1:51:33] other things, you must have power over
[1:51:43] yourself. I think that worth
[1:51:46] repeating. I think that worth repeating.
[1:51:50] That's why God not releasing power just
[1:51:52] like that because it's trouble. If it's
[1:51:54] so much trouble, no. Much as if God give
[1:51:57] people power, they might speak others
[1:51:59] out of existence. They will do a
[1:52:00] politics.
[1:52:03] This one don't like this one. This one
[1:52:04] not fellowship with this one. This one
[1:52:06] can't talk to this one. It will be
[1:52:07] trouble. So God can't do that. He No.
[1:52:12] No. You got to forgive me tonight. I'm
[1:52:15] I'm jumping all over. You may be
[1:52:18] seated. Jesus called his disciples.
[1:52:21] Peter, come. John, come. He didn't say,
[1:52:23] "Peter, bring some of your friends and
[1:52:25] bring them. let them come. So Peter have
[1:52:27] a group, a clique coming with him. No,
[1:52:30] Jesus called this one, that one, that
[1:52:31] one, that one. Whether they talking to
[1:52:33] each other or like each other, that has
[1:52:35] nothing to do with it. Amen. Christ
[1:52:37] called all of them. They had to work it
[1:52:40] out. Fight it out. Battle it out. But
[1:52:44] they are all called of God. And that's
[1:52:47] the respects we must have for men that
[1:52:50] are called of God. Cuz no man didn't
[1:52:53] call me and no man can't uncall me.
[1:52:59] I want to say it again. No man didn't
[1:53:01] call me and they can't take the calling
[1:53:02] off of me and they can't take the
[1:53:04] calling off of you. So forget it. Don't
[1:53:07] even think about it. What I am called to
[1:53:10] do, I've got to do it. Praise God. I'm
[1:53:12] anointed to do, I've got to do it. I can
[1:53:14] only preach with the measure that God
[1:53:16] give me. Oh, hallelujah. That's all I
[1:53:19] have. All I have is my sling.
[1:53:21] Hallelujah. And what God gives me,
[1:53:23] that's what I'm going to use. Oh, praise
[1:53:25] God. So, we are waiting for the
[1:53:27] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:53:29] Listen, who would come back and take it
[1:53:30] over again? Waiting. Here we go. For the
[1:53:33] fullness of time. When the pyramid gets
[1:53:37] to the top, when the full sons of God
[1:53:40] will be
[1:53:41] manifested. When what? The pyramid comes
[1:53:45] to the top. And on top there, as far as
[1:53:48] I remember, is brotherly kindness, which
[1:53:50] is spirit of forgiveness. And brotherly
[1:53:52] kindness is a killer. And I love what
[1:53:55] God has done. He put brotherly kindness
[1:53:57] in the right spot because God know
[1:54:00] you're going to have feuds and quarrels
[1:54:01] and fusses. And God will see if you, not
[1:54:04] them, not the other one. If you will
[1:54:06] drop your OS, if you will forgive, if
[1:54:10] you will overcome by the spirit of
[1:54:12] forgiveness by putting yourself in your
[1:54:14] brother's place on the matter.
[1:54:19] So people talk about faith and they have
[1:54:20] faith and have faith but faith is based
[1:54:22] upon forgiveness. So if there's no
[1:54:24] forgiveness, what faith you talking
[1:54:25] about? Not even faith. I pray for a
[1:54:27] headache.
[1:54:29] So it has to be the spirit of
[1:54:32] forgiveness that brings out the faith in
[1:54:34] someone. Oh my. Even if you are right
[1:54:38] and they are wrong, are you willing to
[1:54:40] take wrong for Christ's sake and forgive
[1:54:44] and have that honey and have that
[1:54:46] brotherly kindness because it got to be
[1:54:48] it got to be. That's what God put for
[1:54:51] our age. Our age is not books and tapes
[1:54:54] and to manifest. If that we win already
[1:54:56] we we we have arrived. We had to hold up
[1:54:59] our
[1:54:59] book as a token for the age. We have a
[1:55:02] spoken book. Max spoke
[1:55:04] book. Sorry. It got to be brotherly
[1:55:07] kindness across our chest. It's got to
[1:55:10] be the life for this age. Do you believe
[1:55:13] that? So, brother Brandham says,
[1:55:15] "Waiting for the fullness of time when
[1:55:16] the pyramid will get to the top when the
[1:55:18] full sons of God will manifest it when
[1:55:20] the power of God will walk out and take
[1:55:23] every power that Satan got away from
[1:55:25] him."
[1:55:26] Notice some feast of the trumpets.
[1:55:28] Revelation
[1:55:29] 10:1-7. All the
[1:55:32] mysteries are to be revealed to the
[1:55:35] bride by the messenger of the lavishian
[1:55:37] churches.
[1:55:44] All not some.
[1:55:49] All all.
[1:55:52] Not somebody else have to come and get a
[1:55:54] re. No. All has to be
[1:55:57] revealed by the prophet of Malachi 4.
[1:56:02] It's in the books. It's in the tapes.
[1:56:05] But all has been revealed. There is no
[1:56:09] eighth messenger. There is no next
[1:56:11] messenger. Hallelujah. There is only one
[1:56:14] messenger. That's Elijah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:18] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[1:56:21] his message is what foruns the second
[1:56:24] coming of the Lord from the seventh seal
[1:56:28] brotherham. He said
[1:56:31] notice here we go for the end of time
[1:56:35] message. This seal talking about the
[1:56:39] seventh
[1:56:39] seal for the end time of message. This
[1:56:43] seal he revealed all six seals but don't
[1:56:46] say nothing about the seventh. And the
[1:56:49] end time seal, that's what he called the
[1:56:52] seventh seal. The end time seal. When it
[1:56:55] starts starts, it's a total secret
[1:56:59] according to the
[1:57:01] Bible. Total secret. At the end of the
[1:57:04] seven angels message, all the mysteries
[1:57:07] of God will be known. We are at the end
[1:57:10] time. The opening of the seventh seal.
[1:57:14] So the seventh seal, that seal with
[1:57:16] silence under it, that's the end time
[1:57:17] seal. That's where we are at the opening
[1:57:21] of the seventh seal. He said when it
[1:57:23] started silence now that was in
[1:57:26] Jessville 24th of March
[1:57:28] 1963. Brother Brandham speaking and
[1:57:32] guide. This is after he preached statue
[1:57:34] of perfect man. The night was the guide.
[1:57:38] He said now the holy spirit always
[1:57:39] speaks his word. I've got many things to
[1:57:41] tell you. You cannot understand it now
[1:57:43] but when he comes he will guide you
[1:57:44] through it. Here we go. That's the
[1:57:47] reason the coming of the
[1:57:49] seals at the finishing. Now then he said
[1:57:52] when it starts it starts in silence. Now
[1:57:55] listen to his words. Amen. At the
[1:57:58] finishing of the seventh seal. Yes sir.
[1:58:02] The mystery of God should be finished to
[1:58:05] know who God is, what he is, how he
[1:58:10] lives, his nature, his being. You are
[1:58:14] supposed to be all the way up there. By
[1:58:18] that time, he's referring to the statue
[1:58:21] of a perfect man. He was saying at the
[1:58:23] finishing of the seven shield, you're
[1:58:26] supposed to have faith, virtue,
[1:58:29] knowledge, temper. That's supposed to be
[1:58:31] in you by that time.
[1:58:40] You're supposed to be way up the way by
[1:58:41] that time to see bring us into the full
[1:58:44] stature of sons and daughters of God. Oh
[1:58:47] hallelujah. From unveiling of God.
[1:58:49] Brothers and sisters, are you catching
[1:58:50] it? Those seven seas will be broke. The
[1:58:53] full thing will come into view. What
[1:58:55] took place all along? The hour of the
[1:58:57] seventh angel's message. All the
[1:58:59] mysteries of God should be made known in
[1:59:02] that Elijah. How and then he's revealing
[1:59:05] this Christ is put out of his church.
[1:59:07] How he's revealed a son of man again.
[1:59:10] How the church is to be put in order for
[1:59:13] the last day. There we go. No creed, no
[1:59:16] denomination, just the word living in
[1:59:19] the individual. I will take one. I would
[1:59:23] leave one. No strings, no denominations,
[1:59:27] no binding. is the heart and God alone.
[1:59:31] No group, no club, no grouping, no camp,
[1:59:36] nothing like that. Just sons of God on
[1:59:40] the earth. Hallelujah. The word living.
[1:59:44] The word living. The word living. That
[1:59:47] is what God promised.
[1:59:53] I'm almost finished this part here.
[1:59:58] Remember the seventh seal is the end
[2:00:01] time of all
[2:00:02] things. The things written in the seven
[2:00:05] sealed book. It is the end. It's the end
[2:00:08] of struggling world. It's the end of
[2:00:10] struggling nature. It's the end of the
[2:00:12] trumpets. It's the end of the vials.
[2:00:14] It's the end of the earth. It even ends
[2:00:17] time. Time runs out. Now when the angel
[2:00:22] came down, the angel swore time shall be
[2:00:25] no more. We are about to break from time
[2:00:27] into eternity. That angel already swore
[2:00:30] that
[2:00:34] we are on borrow time. And one of the
[2:00:37] brothers I think is a pur one of them
[2:00:38] said there is no way out. Think about a
[2:00:41] biscll. And that struck me in a way like
[2:00:45] it never struck me before. You can't pay
[2:00:47] your way out of this. Amen. You can't
[2:00:50] dig down and put some house under the
[2:00:52] ground out of this. You can't hide from
[2:00:55] this. Ready or not, it's coming.
[2:00:58] There's only one way. That's up.
[2:01:02] What's coming up on the earth, nothing
[2:01:03] could stop it. Oh, glory to God. The
[2:01:06] judgment's already set. Nothing could
[2:01:08] stop it. Hallelujah. This Seven Thunder
[2:01:11] Raptor Express train is stopping at
[2:01:14] Hessenhoff. Praise God. We on our way to
[2:01:16] the rapture. Oh, glory to God. Get on
[2:01:19] board. Get on board. Get on board.
[2:01:27] Hallelujah.
[2:01:29] Yes. One day this same train have a few
[2:01:32] more stops and one day the last
[2:01:35] passenger going to get on the train.
[2:01:38] There'll be no more stations to stop at.
[2:01:41] No. Him that is filthy be filthy still.
[2:01:43] Him that is righteous going to be
[2:01:44] righteous still. No more stopping. the
[2:01:47] final name in the book going to be
[2:01:50] redeemed. Oh, glory to God. He redeemed
[2:01:53] your soul. He redeemed your spirit. Now
[2:01:56] he's about to redeem your body by a
[2:01:59] baptism of fire. Oh, glory to God. We
[2:02:03] are going to leave here.
[2:02:08] Oh,
[2:02:09] hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen.
[2:02:13] Thank you, Lord. Time shall be no more.
[2:02:16] Everything runs out the end of this
[2:02:19] seventh seal. Hallelujah. Brother
[2:02:22] Abraham said redemption is in two parts
[2:02:25] coming out of going into and Ephesians
[2:02:29] parallel the book of Joshua and he said
[2:02:31] now in God rich mercy now then we find
[2:02:33] out we have come to another Ephesians
[2:02:35] another Ephesians now where our
[2:02:37] intellectual denomination and so forth
[2:02:40] all our educational programs has come to
[2:02:42] its Jordan. We must have an Ephesians
[2:02:46] again. We must have an Exodus to come
[2:02:50] out and go into the rapture. Now listen
[2:02:53] to this because this is a hidden
[2:02:55] mystery. The Bible only talk about seven
[2:02:57] ages up to Laudisha. But the br
[2:02:59] introduced a hidden mystery of a age
[2:03:01] called the bride age
[2:03:04] or the horned age or the eagle age or
[2:03:09] the age that there's going to be another
[2:03:11] Ephesians. What is he talking about?
[2:03:13] Let's find out.
[2:03:16] So the church world to this day come
[2:03:19] along, played its part, but there is
[2:03:22] coming a time where it must
[2:03:24] cease. It must do it. There has got to
[2:03:29] be an Ephesians of this journey. There
[2:03:32] has got to come an Ephesians, an Ephesus
[2:03:35] of this journey. Yes, sir. We are
[2:03:37] promised. Here we go. Are you ready?
[2:03:38] Amen. According to Revelation 10,
[2:03:42] according to Luke 17:30, there has got
[2:03:44] to come an Ephesians to this. Who could
[2:03:48] reveal that? Who could show us that? It
[2:03:51] take a prophet to come to prophesy.
[2:03:55] That we could expect not a Corinthians,
[2:03:58] not a Galatians, not a Hebrews, but an
[2:04:01] Ephesians. You will see why. Watch.
[2:04:05] There must come an Ephesians to this.
[2:04:07] There is promise friends that these
[2:04:10] sevenfold mysteries of the word of God
[2:04:13] must be unfolded and it's in this
[2:04:15] laudicia that this takes place. So
[2:04:19] therefore we Luther couldn't get to it.
[2:04:22] Wesley couldn't get to it but now in the
[2:04:24] last days we are given to understanding
[2:04:26] by the word that we are going to
[2:04:28] understand it because it will come in
[2:04:30] Ephesians age to it. So our Ephesians
[2:04:32] age will bring clarity to the word. But
[2:04:36] Abraham had to shout and he said, "I
[2:04:38] wish I had the voice of the archangel to
[2:04:40] bring it to a place where you could see
[2:04:42] it." So we are promised the voice of the
[2:04:44] archangel to drop down to bring clarity
[2:04:48] to the vision that the prophet brought.
[2:04:51] Habac said, "Write the vision and make
[2:04:54] the vision plain." The brother of
[2:04:56] Brandon brought a prophetic vision that
[2:04:58] a faithful ministry was supposed to make
[2:05:00] plain to the people.
[2:05:02] [Applause]
[2:05:07] So friends, we don't have our own
[2:05:09] message.
[2:05:12] Write the vision and make it plain that
[2:05:15] he that read it may run. It may have an
[2:05:18] effect upon your life. Hallelujah. So he
[2:05:22] said you're going to you're going to
[2:05:24] you're going to have it. When he comes
[2:05:25] in the scene to prove, watch there had
[2:05:27] been many men raised up and the time of
[2:05:29] Malachi and Matthew 400 years had been
[2:05:32] great men. There was no prophet talking
[2:05:33] about John the Baptist and to prove he
[2:05:36] was that Ephesians made manifest. John
[2:05:38] announced it. So Jesus but call him the
[2:05:42] Ephesians made manifest was Jesus
[2:05:45] Christ. He was the word manifested
[2:05:48] itself. Oh blessed be the name of the
[2:05:50] Lord. And this is brother Brandon here
[2:05:53] in paradox. He said how do you do sir?
[2:05:55] We are strangers to each other. I don't
[2:05:56] know you both of us. He says, "Now it
[2:05:59] would be a paradox for something to
[2:06:00] happen to know what was wrong with you
[2:06:02] or something you had done or something
[2:06:04] you ought not to have done." He said, "I
[2:06:07] cannot know it. It would have to be a
[2:06:08] paradox cuz there was no way for anyone
[2:06:11] to know that outside of some revelation
[2:06:12] of the unseen." That's right. So, here
[2:06:16] we go. So that the audience, not a show,
[2:06:20] but they might see. Here we go. That the
[2:06:23] Ephesus is here. And this is the thing
[2:06:27] that bridges between denomination and
[2:06:30] glory land.
[2:06:32] He promised it. So in discernment, Bram
[2:06:36] says not for sure but to prove that the
[2:06:39] Ephesus is here. Uh this is the thing
[2:06:42] that bridges between denomination and
[2:06:45] glory land. So before we go to glory
[2:06:48] land, we have to cross a bridge called
[2:06:50] Ephesians. You see in Ephesians there's
[2:06:53] only one Lord. There's only one faith.
[2:06:56] There's only one baptism. In Ephesians,
[2:06:58] husband love their wives. In Ephesians,
[2:07:00] children listen to their parents. In
[2:07:02] Ephesians, you put on the whole armor of
[2:07:03] God. In Ephesians, you are predestinated
[2:07:06] unto adoption. In Ephesians, there's the
[2:07:08] five-fold ministry. In Ephesians, it's
[2:07:10] your perfection. In Ephesians, you're no
[2:07:13] longer strangers or pilgrims, but you
[2:07:15] are fellow citizens. Amen.
[2:07:19] Amen.
[2:07:24] Hallelujah.
[2:07:25] And Moses only take them up to the
[2:07:28] promised land. But Joshua took them
[2:07:30] over. And Joshua is Ephesians.
[2:07:36] So to fight for ministry, you have to
[2:07:37] take the bride into Ephesians.
[2:07:43] Yes, sir. Oh my. Okay, let me just go a
[2:07:46] little further here now. Oh, glory to
[2:07:48] God.
[2:07:50] Hallelujah. Jesus in Luke 21:24 says,
[2:07:53] "And they shall fall by the edge of the
[2:07:55] sword that shall led away captive unto
[2:07:57] nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden
[2:08:00] down by the Gentiles until the times of
[2:08:04] the Gentiles be
[2:08:06] fulfilled." Friends, the Gentiles, what
[2:08:10] Abraham says, doesn't have a loted time.
[2:08:12] He said the time of the Gentile is a
[2:08:14] mystery.
[2:08:16] All the Bible speaks about is the times
[2:08:18] of the Gentiles and it also speak about
[2:08:20] until the fullness of the Gentiles come
[2:08:23] in. But the Revelation chapter 7, I
[2:08:27] believe it is seven angels uh angel
[2:08:30] angel arrive from the east having the
[2:08:31] seal of the living God to seal the
[2:08:33] 144,000 going to the Jews. But before
[2:08:36] God returned to the Jews, he have to
[2:08:38] close off the Gentile dispos
[2:08:40] dispensation. Where are we at tonight
[2:08:43] when the seal of God is about to go
[2:08:45] across to the Jews? There's got to be a
[2:08:47] sealing for the Gentile bride. There's
[2:08:50] got to be a closing time out for the
[2:08:51] Gentiles. Brother Brandham, he says
[2:08:55] Romans 11:25, I'll read a scripture. I
[2:08:58] would not, brethren, be ignorant of this
[2:09:00] mystery, least he be wise in your own
[2:09:02] conceits that blindness in part is
[2:09:04] happen to Israel until the fullness of
[2:09:07] the Gentiles come in.
[2:09:10] Now from recognizing today's message,
[2:09:11] brother Bam, the seventh angel's message
[2:09:14] is to open the mystery of the
[2:09:17] seals calling the 11th hour gentile
[2:09:20] workers to receive the same pay the
[2:09:24] first hour workers got. That was the
[2:09:26] purpose to come back to same pay, same
[2:09:29] signs, same wonders, same life, same
[2:09:33] power. That is the promise. That's the
[2:09:36] purpose of the seals going open up to go
[2:09:38] back. You see, before we go to rapture,
[2:09:40] we had to go back.
[2:09:44] They were adopted, but rapture time
[2:09:46] wasn't yet. So, they went into the
[2:09:48] ground. We can't go forward without
[2:09:51] going back. That's why he said the
[2:09:53] prophet was to go back and pick up the
[2:09:54] faith. Then we could go forward. Amen.
[2:09:56] For rapturing faith, rapturing
[2:09:58] condition, we have to pick up the faith
[2:09:59] that they had. And the faith that they
[2:10:01] had wasn't debates and arguments and
[2:10:02] discussion on doctrine. That wasn't the
[2:10:04] faith that they had. that a genuine
[2:10:06] power that was permanent and resident.
[2:10:10] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[2:10:15] It wasn't temporary power. It was
[2:10:19] permanent residing power, virtue power.
[2:10:23] Hallelujah. Glorious power, apostolic
[2:10:26] power. They had power. They received
[2:10:29] power. Jesus promised them power and
[2:10:32] they had it.
[2:10:34] This bride will have nothing less than
[2:10:36] that.
[2:10:41] Oh, hallelujah. Give the Lord a
[2:10:51] shout. Say what? There was a dark age
[2:10:54] that blocked them out. Then in the
[2:10:55] middle of the age, Luther Wesley and
[2:10:57] there's been an evening time message to
[2:10:59] receive the same thing. The even time
[2:11:00] message is to restore back again or
[2:11:03] bring back the same thing. Oh brother,
[2:11:05] give me a church full of the Holy Ghost.
[2:11:07] God will do in one year what all
[2:11:10] theology fails to do in 2,000 years. You
[2:11:12] wait till the anointing of the church
[2:11:15] strike home. After the doors of the
[2:11:18] Gentile is closed. Amen. God will anoint
[2:11:22] the church. Then him that is filthy be
[2:11:24] filthy still. Him that is righteous be
[2:11:26] righteous still. Him is holy, be holy
[2:11:29] still. What all is coming upon us. And I
[2:11:31] picked it a picture being snapped.
[2:11:33] You're caught filthy and snapped. And
[2:11:35] that's the picture. Freeze right
[2:11:38] there. You're caught righteous. Freeze
[2:11:40] right there. Righteous still. Filthy
[2:11:43] still. Holy still. Go just take a
[2:11:45] picture and that. That's it. Whatever
[2:11:46] condition you're caught in, that's it.
[2:11:49] What are we living in? Daniel Baron say
[2:11:52] he wasn't a gentile. He wasn't a
[2:11:54] gentile, but he saw the gentile age rise
[2:11:55] and fall. He wasn't a gentile, but he
[2:11:57] saw the gentile dispensation from start
[2:12:00] to finish from the head of gold end up
[2:12:02] to the feet of iron and clay. And he
[2:12:05] said Daniel was reading what the same
[2:12:07] words we're reading this morning. And he
[2:12:09] took words from Jeremiah the prophet.
[2:12:12] And Daniel began to realize it's just
[2:12:14] two more years left to get out. And he
[2:12:17] set himself in order to pray. And
[2:12:19] brother Bram says and I pray love
[2:12:21] brother Zigma inspiration about praying
[2:12:24] God if there ever was a time we ought to
[2:12:25] set ourselves to pray as we his true
[2:12:28] servants we see by letters of the
[2:12:30] apostle by the warnings of the Holy
[2:12:32] Spirit in the last days the Holy Spirit
[2:12:34] speaks that in the last days men shall
[2:12:37] be heady highminded lovers of pleasures
[2:12:39] more than lovers of God we understand
[2:12:40] that there'll come scuffers in the last
[2:12:42] days I understand nation shall be
[2:12:44] against nation I understand women will
[2:12:46] bub their head off and wear short
[2:12:48] clothes and high he shoes. I understand
[2:12:50] moral will be so low in the last days. I
[2:12:53] understand preachers will be false
[2:12:55] shepherds in the last days that will
[2:12:56] compromise will not feed the people the
[2:12:59] word of God. Go after creeds and things
[2:13:01] instead. But I understand there'll be a
[2:13:03] voice come in the last days crying out
[2:13:06] to go back to the original message back
[2:13:10] to the things of God. I understand here
[2:13:13] we go that there will be a famine. The
[2:13:16] churches will be so organized like they
[2:13:18] are today in this message that in the
[2:13:21] last days there'll come a famine. It
[2:13:23] will not be for bread and water only but
[2:13:25] for the hearing of the true word of God.
[2:13:28] He's not talking about books and tapes
[2:13:29] that have tons of that. So he's not
[2:13:32] talking about that. He's talking about
[2:13:34] hearing the true word of God. And people
[2:13:36] will go from the east to the west north
[2:13:38] south to hear the true word of God. And
[2:13:40] they are so organized and tightened up
[2:13:42] that they will fail to hear it. I
[2:13:44] understand by book. I understand that
[2:13:47] that will take place just before the
[2:13:50] spirit leaves the gentile church to
[2:13:54] return to the Jews. Hallelujah. Are you
[2:13:57] with me? Could we take a little more
[2:13:59] tonight? Almost through. The law failed.
[2:14:03] Moses failed. Joshua took over. And the
[2:14:06] Holy Spirit will come into the
[2:14:10] church. This is the promise.
[2:14:13] Not men,
[2:14:15] not organization, he says, but the Holy
[2:14:18] Spirit will get among the people and
[2:14:22] make her ready to go up and cross
[2:14:25] Jordan. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Do
[2:14:29] you believe that? Hallelujah. Praise the
[2:14:32] name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of
[2:14:35] the Lord.
[2:14:36] So
[2:14:38] God blinded Israel purposely but Abraham
[2:14:41] says for you and I. They cannot see
[2:14:44] because God blinded them
[2:14:47] to finish the transgression. God cut
[2:14:50] them off purposely and blinded their
[2:14:51] eyes so we could get a chance to see and
[2:14:54] give us an opportunity and we walk
[2:14:56] around like we are somebody. Paul tell
[2:14:59] them here take heed. How you do that?
[2:15:01] Take heed. For if God spared not the
[2:15:04] natural branch, how will he have any
[2:15:06] more mercy on the wild branch? And we
[2:15:08] walk around say, I'm Presbyterian. I am
[2:15:11] Methodist. I am Baptist. I am
[2:15:13] Pentecostal. That don't mean nothing to
[2:15:16] God. You have got to be born again by
[2:15:19] the Holy Spirit. Oh Daniel, shut up the
[2:15:22] words and seal the book till the time of
[2:15:24] the end. Seal it up till the time of the
[2:15:25] end. Close up the words and seal the
[2:15:27] book. What did he do? He sealed up the
[2:15:29] vision and prophecy. But Abraham said
[2:15:31] that now the Gentiles wasn't loted any
[2:15:34] time. He just said the time of the
[2:15:36] Gentiles. And we find out that Jesus
[2:15:39] didn't even lock them a time. Oh my.
[2:15:43] Hallelujah. For Jerusalem shall be dred
[2:15:45] down of the Gentiles until the time of
[2:15:48] the Gentile be fulfilled. Then there is
[2:15:50] a lot of time, but nobody knows when it
[2:15:53] will be. It's a mystery.
[2:15:55] Remember in the time of the persecution
[2:15:59] there will be millions of Gentiles will
[2:16:01] die. That rejected bride, the remnant of
[2:16:05] the woman's seed, the sleeping virgin.
[2:16:08] Many places but say millions will die.
[2:16:12] Oh hallelujah. Praise God. You know what
[2:16:15] Daniel saw right? A stone cut out
[2:16:17] without the hands of man. Man it not
[2:16:19] going to bring in that stone. That stone
[2:16:21] came out without the hands of man. And
[2:16:23] Boram said, "What happened at that
[2:16:25] time?" He said, "Daniel's he watched the
[2:16:27] gentile age until the stone out of the
[2:16:29] mountain that wasn't cut with hands.
[2:16:31] They never put a capstone pyramid." So
[2:16:33] he's tying it in with a capstone now.
[2:16:34] Ah, are we getting somewhere? But Ram
[2:16:36] tying it with a capstone to close off
[2:16:38] the age. We're looking for power. We're
[2:16:39] looking for a capstone. We're looking
[2:16:40] for dynamics. But here's all together.
[2:16:42] He said, "Watch." He said, "Now the
[2:16:44] stone, they never put a capstone on that
[2:16:45] pyramid. It wasn't cut up by man's hand.
[2:16:48] It's God's hand that cut that stone."
[2:16:50] What did it do? It hit the image right
[2:16:52] smack in the feet and broke it up to
[2:16:54] pieces. What happened at that time? The
[2:16:56] coming of that stone up when the church
[2:16:58] into glory at the rapture caused it
[2:17:00] ended the gentile dispensation. God
[2:17:04] ended it up with the coming of that
[2:17:06] stone. So the coming of dynamics to the
[2:17:08] mechanics, the coming of the capstone
[2:17:10] that going to end the gentile
[2:17:12] dispensation. The baptism of the Holy
[2:17:14] Ghost with gifts cannot move the bride.
[2:17:17] It will take charity. It will take
[2:17:20] dynamics. It will take the power. It
[2:17:22] will take Christ the person of the Holy
[2:17:24] Ghost himself. Oh hallelujah.
[2:17:27] Hallelujah. He Christ is that stone. He
[2:17:30] he watch and the church calls the
[2:17:33] strength of the headstone run through
[2:17:34] the church like a magnet. And the
[2:17:35] headstone is the Holy Ghost. What the
[2:17:38] headstone is? It's the Holy Ghost. And
[2:17:41] every one of us that have the here we
[2:17:43] go. the magnetism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:17:46] When that stone strike the image, it
[2:17:48] will flee to it and will be taken back
[2:17:50] into glory. So, you have to have
[2:17:52] something in you that the Holy Ghost
[2:17:54] could connect with. He didn't say what
[2:17:56] doctrine you have. He said the magnetism
[2:17:59] of the Holy Ghost, it's got to be in
[2:18:02] you. When that big magnet begin to sweep
[2:18:04] over the world, it must pick you up
[2:18:07] because you are magnetized. Hallelujah.
[2:18:09] With the magnetism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:18:12] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:18:15] Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:18:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:18:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hal that magnet
[2:18:25] is coming down. That magnet coming down
[2:18:28] to you, pick you up. Oh, glory to God.
[2:18:31] Hallelujah.
[2:18:32] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Brother
[2:18:35] Brandham, he is the dynamics of the
[2:18:38] mechanics. The mechanics of the church.
[2:18:40] What is it? apostles, prophets,
[2:18:42] teachers. Five for ministry becomes God
[2:18:44] mechanics on earth. And he could work
[2:18:46] that mechanics because God couldn't use
[2:18:48] the Pentecostal because we're just
[2:18:50] spirit upon men flesh. But God changes
[2:18:53] operations. He said, "I'm going to use
[2:18:54] the word in men." So he put the word in
[2:18:56] men and men become a channel of God that
[2:18:59] the fire of God could flow through them.
[2:19:01] Adoption time. I don't have the quote
[2:19:03] fit or says where you could say there is
[2:19:05] my spirit flowing freely. Not doctrine,
[2:19:07] not teaching. We had teachings for
[2:19:08] years, mechanics for years, explanation
[2:19:10] for years, testimonies for years. He
[2:19:12] He's not talking about that. Talking
[2:19:14] about a man so died out. A channel of
[2:19:16] pipe of God, a channel of communication
[2:19:19] for inspiration to flow through, fire
[2:19:22] coming out the man's mouth. How Peter
[2:19:24] spake these words. Holy Ghost falling
[2:19:26] upon them that heard the word. What
[2:19:27] happened? Peter is in the body. He's a
[2:19:29] channel of God. He's a branch of God
[2:19:32] connected to the vine of God producing
[2:19:34] the fruit of God being glorified
[2:19:40] God.
[2:19:42] Hallelujah. Glory to God. My Lord. My
[2:19:46] Lord. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:19:49] Hallelujah. Wow.
[2:19:52] Now the
[2:19:53] spirit, the dynamics of the promised
[2:19:56] word to get into his church and drive
[2:20:00] them to Calvary yonder until the
[2:20:02] rapture. There you are. So before you go
[2:20:04] into the rapture, there's a cross.
[2:20:09] See, it's so quiet to
[2:20:11] get the cross. Super church, super race.
[2:20:14] Everybody on fire and so on. But the
[2:20:16] dynamics
[2:20:18] going to drive you. You have got to die.
[2:20:22] I don't care how long in the message. I
[2:20:24] don't care how much books you have, how
[2:20:25] much you're going to die.
[2:20:30] You're all going to die. Drive us to
[2:20:32] Calvary. Oh, hallelujah. And then into
[2:20:36] the rapture. A man is permitted to
[2:20:38] travel so far, but is a separating line
[2:20:41] between life and death he must never
[2:20:42] cross. You can go on with a little
[2:20:44] foolishness for a while, but you better
[2:20:47] know where that line is. Did the Lord
[2:20:49] ever check you on anything? Pull you up
[2:20:51] on anything? Say that's far enough. Oh,
[2:20:54] hallelujah. You better be careful. Oh,
[2:20:57] blessed be the name of the Lord. So God
[2:21:01] never did God use a group. Every time
[2:21:03] any group organized, God left it. Praise
[2:21:06] God. Therefore during the reformation
[2:21:08] they come reform reformers as the 7c
[2:21:11] prove we find in the scripture in
[2:21:12] Malachi 4 this feast of the trumpets
[2:21:14] that there is to be an anointing come
[2:21:17] down to restore again the original faith
[2:21:20] to bring faith to the people to the
[2:21:23] original Pentecostal that anointing have
[2:21:25] to come down and I believe that the age
[2:21:29] has come now where the miraculous the
[2:21:31] phenomenal the baptism of the spirit the
[2:21:34] power the signs the wonders this great
[2:21:38] pouring out of God's spirit in the last
[2:21:40] days. That's the thing that will bring
[2:21:44] faith into the people that will take a
[2:21:47] rapture in faith and take the church
[2:21:49] into the glory. So we could cry, we
[2:21:52] could sigh, we could sing. That's not
[2:21:54] what the prophet said. He said this is
[2:21:56] the thing. The Holy Spirit, the spirit
[2:21:59] have to begin to move. The spirit have
[2:22:01] to begin to fall. This is what God
[2:22:03] promised. All I could preach is
[2:22:05] promises. This message is a message of
[2:22:08] promises. I didn't come to bring my
[2:22:10] feelings to you. I didn't come to bring
[2:22:11] a dream to you. I come to bring a
[2:22:13] dossier of the Lord. Promise from a 20th
[2:22:16] century prophet to you.
[2:22:23] You see, even if you don't see it the
[2:22:25] way we it said, it still doesn't change
[2:22:26] what he said.
[2:22:29] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:22:31] Question. Okay. Wow.
[2:22:36] question and answers. If the church is
[2:22:38] saved, even though she doesn't go to the
[2:22:40] rapture, and I believe you taught she
[2:22:42] must go through the tribulation for
[2:22:43] purifying, what about these that are
[2:22:45] dead? How will they be purified? The
[2:22:48] bride don't need no purification. She's
[2:22:51] already purified. Those that are dead
[2:22:54] back there, they never receive the light
[2:22:57] that this church up here has received.
[2:22:59] They live by justification and
[2:23:01] sanctification like that. They live to
[2:23:04] the light that they had. Maybe in a way
[2:23:07] they suffered whatever they went through
[2:23:09] with their persecutions. Here we go. But
[2:23:14] now in this rapturing time like
[2:23:18] this, there will have to come a time now
[2:23:21] that this bride that reject the head
[2:23:24] part of the bride. Now he's talking
[2:23:26] about the church.
[2:23:28] He's talking about the church in this
[2:23:29] message that reject the head part of the
[2:23:31] bride. Listen, listen.
[2:23:34] In this rapturing time, there will come
[2:23:37] a time that the bride that reject the
[2:23:41] head part of the bride will have to
[2:23:43] suffer for her rejection because the
[2:23:46] gospel wasn't made plain back there like
[2:23:48] it being made plain to you. You see it
[2:23:51] so plain. You have had all these years
[2:23:53] examples. The sea is open. The church
[2:23:55] age is laid out. everything else. It's
[2:23:57] so plain, you can't miss it. So then if
[2:23:59] you fully reject it, there's only one
[2:24:02] thing to do, suffer for it. So after the
[2:24:05] bride is raptured, will any of the
[2:24:08] foolish virgin be saved or will they be
[2:24:10] lost? No. Everything will be finished
[2:24:12] for the Gentile church when the bride is
[2:24:15] taken off the earth. The spirit of God
[2:24:20] leaves the earth. He that is filthy be
[2:24:23] filthy still. He that is righteous is
[2:24:25] righteous still. He that is holy is holy
[2:24:28] still. In other words, the sanctuary
[2:24:30] becomes smokeoky. The attorney stands to
[2:24:33] plead a case. Christ leaves the
[2:24:36] sanctuary. His day of material work is
[2:24:39] over. The rapture comes and there is no
[2:24:43] more material work. Christ comes to
[2:24:46] claim his material work. Now just wait a
[2:24:48] minute. Will the foolish virgin be
[2:24:50] saved? No. Whatever happens now after
[2:24:55] that she will have to go through the
[2:24:58] tribulation
[2:25:00] period and this is the bomb and the
[2:25:03] reason of it is because she has rejected
[2:25:08] the atonement in its fullness.
[2:25:12] Now this is very important. These words
[2:25:16] are very important. He didn't say that
[2:25:18] she rejected the atonement. No, she
[2:25:21] rejected the atonement in its fullness.
[2:25:25] Let's continue. She is a professed
[2:25:27] believer,
[2:25:29] but she will have to go through the
[2:25:31] tribulation period. Brother recognizing
[2:25:34] Ya's message talking about Moses and
[2:25:37] Elijah same condition. He said debt
[2:25:39] doesn't do anything to a man but change
[2:25:41] his dwelling place. Debt doesn't change
[2:25:44] your nature. Doesn't change your It
[2:25:47] doesn't change your fate. It doesn't
[2:25:48] change nothing in you but your dwelling
[2:25:51] place. So which way your nature is this
[2:25:53] morning, if you're a doubt of God's
[2:25:55] word, you won't be a would be a doubt
[2:25:56] over there. I don't care if holy you
[2:25:58] are, how you live, how good you live, it
[2:26:01] wouldn't change you one bit to die just
[2:26:03] your dwelling place. And if you can't
[2:26:06] accept the whole word of God, the way it
[2:26:09] is written, you wouldn't do it over
[2:26:10] there. Don't worry, you won't be there.
[2:26:13] You have got to accept it in its
[2:26:15] fullness, in the power of its
[2:26:17] vindication and the revelation of what
[2:26:20] it is. Then you become part of it. You
[2:26:23] have to accept it in its fullness. In
[2:26:26] its vindication and its revelation, then
[2:26:29] you are part of it. Oh, hallelujah. Oh,
[2:26:32] glory to God. Let's continue. Feast of
[2:26:35] the trumpets. It's the end time. The
[2:26:38] great day of the Lord is at hand. The
[2:26:40] feast of the Messiah. Now in Revelation
[2:26:43] 11 talking about Moses and Elijah
[2:26:45] calling Israel out of Jewish tradition
[2:26:48] just as the seventh angel's message
[2:26:50] called the bride out of Pentecostal
[2:26:52] tradition. Moses and Elijah is to call
[2:26:56] Israel out of the old atonement of lamb
[2:26:58] and sheep unto the real living sacrifice
[2:27:01] to the word. And the seventh angel's
[2:27:05] message under the same trumpet, same
[2:27:08] every same seal is to call the people
[2:27:11] the bride. Here we go. Out of the
[2:27:14] Pentecostal world tradition to the
[2:27:16] genuine atonement, the word
[2:27:20] Christ impersonated in his word, made
[2:27:23] flesh among us. Amen. Now, here we go.
[2:27:26] He's repeating himself. The same as
[2:27:28] those two prophets did. Remember the
[2:27:31] gentile bride is to have a prophet
[2:27:33] called Elias. Elijah to call them out of
[2:27:37] their tradition the bride just the same
[2:27:39] as these prophets called the Jews out of
[2:27:42] Judaism to Christ the atonement. And the
[2:27:45] Gentiles here we go the
[2:27:47] Gentiles already knows the
[2:27:50] atonement. So the atonement is not the
[2:27:53] issue. That's why I told you note he
[2:27:55] used the word fullness of the atonement.
[2:27:58] The atonement is not the issue. He say
[2:28:00] it is to call the bride back to the
[2:28:02] original atonement.
[2:28:04] That's the difference. All the Pentecost
[2:28:06] know Jesus died for my sins. Christ is
[2:28:08] the atonement. He's not talking about
[2:28:10] that. He's talking about the original
[2:28:11] atonement back to the day of Pentecost.
[2:28:16] Hallelujah.
[2:28:17] The fullness of the atonement. Speaking
[2:28:19] about the bride she spitt from the
[2:28:21] church, from the church body. They cut
[2:28:23] her off. spitting from a master. Just
[2:28:25] like Joseph was spitting from the
[2:28:26] brethren because he was the word. Jesus
[2:28:29] was spitting from the brethren because
[2:28:30] he was the word. The church is spitten.
[2:28:32] The bride is spitten from the church.
[2:28:35] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, blessed be the name
[2:28:37] of the Lord. From invisible union and
[2:28:39] the bride, he said, you remember the
[2:28:41] grain begin to ripen. You find before
[2:28:44] the grain can ripen, everything in the
[2:28:46] stalk has to be dead. Can't you see
[2:28:48] where you're standing? Life is in the
[2:28:50] grain again. The same word sucked up
[2:28:53] these come through here up to our head
[2:28:55] and all the life. Oh, I love this. All
[2:28:58] the life, not teachings, not doctrines.
[2:29:02] All the life that come through here
[2:29:05] picked up its people. So the life of
[2:29:07] Paul, Arinus, Martin, Columbus, Luther,
[2:29:10] the life, you see that magnet coming
[2:29:12] over to pick up its people. Oh, glory to
[2:29:14] God. What they picking up for for the
[2:29:15] rapture? Oh, hallelujah. It is forming
[2:29:18] into a head for the rapture. Oh, blessed
[2:29:21] be the name of the Lord. And Bram is
[2:29:23] praying here. May there come forth a
[2:29:25] revival of the just and a great power
[2:29:27] come among the church just before it's
[2:29:28] going. It's not too hard to pray that
[2:29:30] because we promise that we are looking
[2:29:32] for that for that third pull that we
[2:29:34] know will do great things among us.
[2:29:36] Well, he's talking about a great power,
[2:29:38] a great revival, a revival of the just.
[2:29:40] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. So,
[2:29:42] this restitution, I'm almost done. This
[2:29:45] restitution, the act of restoring to the
[2:29:47] rightful owner what has been taken away.
[2:29:49] And brother Ram said if a man lost his
[2:29:52] inheritance and a squatter come on his
[2:29:54] land he could not hold it any longer
[2:29:57] until 50 years. After 50 years a jubilee
[2:30:00] came by and the year of jubilee when the
[2:30:03] year of jubilee come everything went
[2:30:06] back to the original the beginning at
[2:30:08] the beginning all slaves they went back
[2:30:11] to the original beginning. If a man was
[2:30:12] hoing in the field and the trumpet sung
[2:30:14] and he heard it, he threw down his hoe
[2:30:16] and say, "I'm no more a slave. I'm going
[2:30:18] back to my family. Everything that he
[2:30:21] had had to be given back." Oh, praise
[2:30:23] God. Do you believe that? Now, if some
[2:30:27] individual lost inheritance that was
[2:30:29] given to them by God, there come a year
[2:30:31] called the Jubilee year. Isn't that
[2:30:33] right? And in this Jubilee, every man
[2:30:35] that lost his inheritance, he was a
[2:30:38] freeborn, a trueblooded Israelite. No
[2:30:40] matter, listen, no matter who held the
[2:30:43] possession. It had to come back to him.
[2:30:46] He had to go free. He didn't have to pay
[2:30:48] a thing. He just had to stop what he was
[2:30:50] doing and go back to his inheritance.
[2:30:53] Listen, he has a right to it. It was a
[2:30:55] God-given right because by grace he has
[2:30:58] inherited it and it would be given to
[2:31:00] his fathers and hanging on year after
[2:31:02] year. No matter what taking place, if he
[2:31:04] lost it, he must go free. It meant grace
[2:31:08] has provided a way for each individual
[2:31:10] to return to their rightful inheritance.
[2:31:13] And the Jubilee was God's manner of
[2:31:16] expressing grace to his people for
[2:31:19] restoring or bringing back one to their
[2:31:22] rightful condition. So when you can't
[2:31:24] make it through, God have a jubilee year
[2:31:26] just for you. Brother Brandham said the
[2:31:29] power of God was taken back to the
[2:31:31] original 50th day, the year of Jubilee
[2:31:32] when all things went back. Are you
[2:31:35] ready? Amen. For the prophecy. Are you
[2:31:38] ready for the prophecy? There will come
[2:31:42] another year of jubilee.
[2:31:46] Oh, hallelujah. Listen to this. Watch.
[2:31:50] And we have had it. If you notice,
[2:31:52] Pentecost has been failing in America
[2:31:53] for 50 years. And about 50 years,
[2:31:55] Pentecost begin to fall. Now, what's
[2:31:57] happening? The church is receiving the
[2:32:00] seven seal book of the revelation of
[2:32:01] Jesus Christ. And not one ten of them
[2:32:03] can receive it. But hear the prophecy.
[2:32:05] But when you see, you begin to see the
[2:32:08] year of Jubilee where you don't have to
[2:32:11] fuss and strain and pull. But we already
[2:32:15] secured in Christ. We already have the
[2:32:18] baptism in the name of Jesus. All the
[2:32:20] mysteries have been revealed. We are
[2:32:22] going to bring the seven seas and prove
[2:32:24] that it has been received from the eyes
[2:32:26] of the people. Oh, glory to God. I'm
[2:32:28] almost done. So what God promised that
[2:32:30] his grace that's why when the headstone
[2:32:32] come it will come with shoutings of
[2:32:34] grace not your works people try to beat
[2:32:37] people into it legislate people into it
[2:32:39] doctrine them into it and it's the grace
[2:32:41] of God think about it now think about it
[2:32:44] this book have something called
[2:32:45] redemptive rights not wants rights you
[2:32:49] have a right to be healed you have a
[2:32:51] right to be delivered when the lamb took
[2:32:53] the book he took the book from for you
[2:32:55] so you have a right to access the power
[2:32:58] of God. You have a right for the baptism
[2:33:00] of the Holy Ghost. You have a right for
[2:33:01] re revival. That's your right. Oh, glory
[2:33:04] to God. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, praise
[2:33:08] God. I'm almost done. Music, come up,
[2:33:10] please. Jesus in John 4 told the woman.
[2:33:15] The woman said, "Our fathers worship in
[2:33:16] this mountain, and ye say, Jerusalem is
[2:33:19] the place where men ought to worship."
[2:33:21] And Jesus said unto the woman, "Believe
[2:33:22] me, the hour come when you shall need in
[2:33:25] this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem
[2:33:27] worship the Father. Ye worship, you know
[2:33:29] not what we know what we worship for
[2:33:31] salvation of the Jews." The hour come,
[2:33:33] and now is, when the true worshipper
[2:33:35] shall worship the Father in spirit and
[2:33:37] the truth. For the Father seeketh such
[2:33:39] to work, worship him. God is a spirit,
[2:33:42] and they that worship him must worship
[2:33:44] him in spirit and in truth. Oh, glory to
[2:33:47] God. So when Hallelujah. Praise the name
[2:33:50] of the Lord. When John when John took
[2:33:53] the when when the lamb took the book and
[2:33:55] John begin to rejoice and shout. Oh,
[2:33:57] praise God. But Abraham says, he said,
[2:33:59] now watch. Hallelujah. From 8 from the 8
[2:34:01] to the 14th verse, he says it was the
[2:34:04] lamb to be worshiped both in heaven and
[2:34:05] earth. He said from the 8th verse to the
[2:34:07] 14th verse, angels worship him, elders
[2:34:10] worship him, living creatures worship
[2:34:11] him, John worship him so much till he
[2:34:14] say every creature in heaven and earth
[2:34:16] under the earth worship and and blessing
[2:34:17] God. the worship time for the king lamb.
[2:34:19] Are we going to have that kind of time?
[2:34:21] You got to get a revelation of your name
[2:34:22] in the book. Notice, notice, notice all
[2:34:25] this talk about seven seals. Boram says
[2:34:27] when John saw his name, John begin to
[2:34:30] shout and worship. Have you seen your
[2:34:33] name? Because when you see your name,
[2:34:35] you're going to have to shout and
[2:34:38] worship. May the Lord bless you. There
[2:34:41] is Jesus. Listen. He has to remain until
[2:34:45] everything be restored. Eve have to be
[2:34:48] restored. Power have to be restored.
[2:34:51] Perfection have to be restored. And a
[2:34:53] Pentecostal bride have to be restored.
[2:34:55] Another Ephesians restored. The power in
[2:34:57] the church restored. May the Lord bless
[2:34:59] you.
