quickness to your promised word make us alive this morning unto you we're here to serve you not a church we're here to love you not a church we're here to become like you father because that's what you pray that we be ones you and the father are one and the father went in you by the spirit now lord come this morning and baptize hearts and souls and lines with your holy ghost lord the life be changed lord that's what we come here for a change for our transformation granted father and jesus and we ask it amen oh god bless you hallelujah it's good to be here this morning amen and if your bibles i'd like you to turn the one portion of scripture matthew chapter 16 thank you musicians reading from verse 13 to 20 matthew chapter 16 oh blessed be the name of the lord it's good to be in his presence amen when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men see that i the son of man am and they said some see the dawah john the baptist some elias others jerry mars or one of the prophets he says unto them but whom say ye that i am and someone peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed are the dogs i'm about jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee the dow at peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be born in heaven whatsoever shall loosen earth shall be loosed in heaven then charge his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ may god bless his word you may be seated o blessed be the name of the lord is good to be in god's presence and in the house of god so this morning i have a title i will build my church upon this rock revelation fate that's the title of this morning i will build my church upon this rock revelation fate i have an inspiration look on this have a subject godly spiritual fate only recognizes the word godly spiritual faith only recognizes the word you know the bibles talk about uh all heard the word but with many it wasn't mixed with faith to them that heard it so it comes right back to everybody could hear the same thing but what they're possessing could be different and um we talked about it in the exhortation we give on friday about the eagle and the chicken and one man hearing the same story eagle laid the egg among chickens hatch chicken stock the eagles had to be like a chicken then a mother eagle passover and the eagle recognized is one like himself and fly off and and somebody hear that story and one person said but that man called me a chicken and the other person said that man call me an eagle so it all depends upon what you have as your processor or what you interpret on the inside so if you are negative on the inside you tend to pick up negative things you will even think that the pasta train waits for you you would even think all kinds of things come to your mind because of what on the inside see so we need to deal with the inside before you try to deal with somebody else try to work on you try to deal with you okay let's go are you ready so you want things compact tight and underwood this morning all right nobody going to escape this word now this would okay already no one here will escape nobody going to escape this morning here we go there are three elements that a man follows first is humanistic second is divine revelation third is a vision oh that's dusty at the lord many times we are dung in here and never climb into this if you're not dung in there cast your hopes through the veil to see the lord all right now here it is now so there's three realms so this morning either in humanistic divine revelation or vision let's not talk vision just yet because vision is dusty at the lord so to us at this level is just true humanistic and divine revelation now all of us stats are humanistic because that's where we are at we're dealing with five senses we're dealing with see touch smell taste sight and what we hear and what we feel and our emotion and this will get us hurt all that is humanistic but divine revelation takes you above that and that's why jesus asked his important question who do men say i am in other words who do the humanistic realm out there who say i am because they don't know who i am so tell me what they're saying about me tell me what they're talking about me and they say some so you're elijah some say you're this some say you had that he said who do you say i am i'm coming down to home now who do you say i am and they didn't know after following jesus for three plus years they didn't know who he was all of a sudden peter stepped forward he said that by the christ the son of the living god then jesus used these words flesh and blood hath not revealed unto you but my father hath revealed unto you and upon this rock i will build my church it was a revelation it was a rock it was a faith that he built his church horn he's not building his church with cement and gravel he's done building church upon flesh and blood he is building his church today upon revelation do you have a revelation today because a revelation puts something inside of you a revelation you can't explain it a revelation is something you can't explain it you don't even know why you're here this morning but something told you you've got to be here god wanted you to be here this morning you know what brought you here this morning fate oh glory to god by faith you put on your clothes this morning you say you're going to church this morning all the devils in hell was shining into you all the devils in here trying to stop you but you made it don't give the lord a praise offering glory glory glory let me see that faith is what has distinguished the believer from the unbeliever you don't know why you're doing certain things like that one time a woman praying she was hungry she was poor and she prayed oh god send some food send some bread send something and somebody passing back here and i'm praying and they say and they say we go go and buy bread and put it back she don't she will think goats in it and she pray oh god would you bless me help me hungry and food and the person by i said that full stuff from president and she said oh god thank you lord and they're laughing at her they don't even know god put it that they will buy this stuff and put it right there that is faith that is faith when you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow but you step out oh glory to god that is faith glory to god hallelujah glory to god that's his faith glory to god old man abraham god said i have a son sarah old passage age of childbearing and the bible said abraham believe god so sometimes you are challenged to believe not your feelings not your senses i didn't know i'll be here this hour i didn't know after all these years going to school and what you do you think we you think we expected to be hearing this over here now absolutely not but we walk by faith pick up a wife walk by faith pick up three sons walk by fit we still walk in my faith where you're going you seen a city you're seeking a situ who's making believers god oh glory to god hallelujah praise god hallelujah coronavirus sickness disease all kind of stuff will be walking by faith we know no devil can't take your death god i say no weapon form against you could prosper lord the devil is alive god i don't need to be on this earth no corona virus no accident no disease no cancer nothing could take you out oh give the lord a shout out praise god break foot break hand but he can't take your life oh glory to god lying on the bed but he still can't take your life hallelujah sit on the oxygen but he can't take your life glory to god give god some praises hallelujah hallelujah you maybe see that david said i was young now i'm old i have never seen the righteous forsaken or a seed-backed bread i have no promise to beg no bread i have no promise to be lying like a vegan to the side of the street that is not your promise if there is one job left in trinidad you're gonna get it oh glory to god give the lord a shout in the house i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you even in you trust god this morning [Applause] hallelujah singles yesterday also had an earthquake and i was stepping on the house and he said did you feel it but she was by the kitchen and she was maybe there's somebody kitchen there and she was standing so i was not stepping out of the house um to go to the car and i didn't feel it people felt it it was really a hard one you know earthquake is very interesting you know you're not like if you're even coming or storm coming you could you could knock up your board and and and tell yourself you're getting nails and put your plywood and knock it but when you heard shake it when you're footing you the president shaken doctor's shaking lawyers taken ceo shaking everybody shaking you know why they're not in charge that's what i shaken does a shaken shows that you come on now put it back to me you are not in charge cognizant are shaking oh god he gonna show who's in charge oh god your big mouth not in charge your pride not in charge your bad attitude that church god is in church oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god we are more bombs in america what the ammunition we have is greater than all the nuclear power that that them have that putin have on russia because the sons of god have the power to go back before the fall to tap into the power that was before the fall and come back and stop cancer and stop diseases and stop this and stop that oh glory to god they don't have the power to do that they have the power to blow up one another oh but we have the power to get back to our joy to get back our peace we have the power to go back in the enemy camp to go in and take back what the devil took from us oh god the devil wants you frustrated depressed sick ill hallelujah feeling bad and upset wanting to give up but i say this morning don't give up oh god don't be wary oh god the vision is true but the time is long wait for the vision it shall surely come to pass or give the lord a shout there's going to be dynamics to the mechanics he is still a waymaker when lassen heard that this morning he's a waymaker where there is no way god makes a way i am preaching in vain i am shouting asleep we're not insanely granny and then oh glory to god this tabernacle is not in trinidadian oh give the lord a shout he said upon this rock i will build my church there is a church at jesus building and i believe this morning that you are part of it let me see oh boy all right there are three realms okay first is humanistic we don't hear say i'll pray for that person i'm hoping that they get well as humanistic you're hoping they get well next is divine revelation that is when something done in your heart anchors it and say it is going to happen there is something going to happen then the third element is vision or the word of the lord made manifest when you see it's thus saith the lord oh glory ago just three realms humanistic that you and your flesh right you're in your flesh you're staying home you're looking for a walk and coming to your house you've got to get off your bed early [Music] people waiting inside the house for things to happen it's not coming soon you step up by faith today i'm going to get a job today i'm going to get a breakthrough yes you have to act that's the problem today people are sitting and staring they're not acting isn't that right i appreciate nothing new you know they're the same egg fried boil stew whatever it is the same it will rain you know don't come i ain't coming on your doctrine and teaching you know no one come with that send my wife something but isaac talk about uh uh that they will not come until they are falling away until the man is saying be received and the bible speaks about because they love not the truth god will send them a strong delusion that they will believe a lie and be done by it and you know never zeroing better exact on that word delusion and delusion is when you believe something that is fake in the face of facts in the face of truth you choose to believe something different that is a delusion oh hallelujah and because people don't love the truth god not giving them just a delusion you know but a strong delusion that they actually believe is a lie they believe a lie as if it's the truth oh glory to god that's why we have to be careful we have to be careful because when something in somebody's heart you can't take it out you can't change your mind you can show them quotes you can show them scripture because the heart register something else so i said if somebody don't like you they don't like you know you can get them fig a house land cat they still don't like you because that don't like it's in the heart even in head it could be it would blow away you could get that out but when it's in the heart it is registered that's why you have to take it how you're here and what we said i think two sundays ago but the prophet said he said when you say the thing over and over and over and you believe it after a while a lie your pong allah your pong allah your you beat it until it dropped down from here to here and after what is in your heart that's no good so god that's why you keep hearing things over and over because god's seed must drop into your heart god's thought must drop into your heart that your words change and then your life change as you speak different you talk different you act different your whole life completely transformed and that is why the bible said be transformed by what by the union of your mind if your mind has changed you're not going to change oh give the lord a shout let me say that again if your mind don't change you're not going to change you have to have an intent to do good you have to have an intent to do better you have to have an intent to press on from that mediocrity to some level of perfection or some place that is better than you higher than you that place that challenges you or give the lord a shout you don't want to bring people down to where you are you want to go to where others are in the sense of if there's a better place i want a better place we'll give the lord a shout amen [Applause] too many people like to and encourage people in their realm so if their realm is one one friend they want to stay with one friend and if this person talks to somebody else they say no don't go there i want you to be my one friend because i am one on one and that's not christianity christianity you have to reach out you have to go beyond your family listen look your mother do you say who's my mother who's my mother he said all i'm doing i will love my father my mother brother sister you see if i come out i'll give your brothers and sisters your family give you up go get their new family oh gloria you are my family you're my real family my natural family we call mother and father and jean and resemblance and what is natural but this is spiritual now because the blood of jesus make us get connected we join from the same blood the same blood for you is the blood for me you hear what i said the same blood for you the same forgiveness god gave me is for you too we'll give the lord a shout in the house it's one blood by one blood hallelujah the price to redeem all of us therefore all of us have a right to have access to his presence that's why you bust a veil from the top to the bottom you don't have to be as you are you don't have to live as you are your life can be changed and transformed my life has been oh glory to god and some of you here your life has been also and i trust this service be a transformational service to you today oh give the lord a shout amen so divine revelation is when you know in your heart it is going to happen there is nothing but just revelation oh praise god now in the humanistic is where this one hurts your feelings and you're feeling bad where you can't even connect to romans 8 28 and you and you and you know this happened and instead of you drop back on your word that is what the word does you know you see when you rock back on your word because who prays the name of the lord let me get it here the spiritual faith only recognizes what the word so when something happened your life is hidden you know i know all things work together for good see your sister do you something your brother do something it's not your sister brother you know is the devil that jump on your brother and sister it's not your brother or sister and the devil say hit them now let them know do it no do him no and they in a spirit and they do you something and you are to forgive them because god watching you look not watching them you know you've been tested because you have the right attitude so he could put the test on you he could put charge on you you know what he consider you qualify to take it to the next level oh give the lord a shout you see you're qualified to take it to the next level your pastor's test next test your pastor's test next test your pastor's death next test don't stop studying oh because the test is coming oh glory to god give the lord a shout don't stop learning because the test is coming you'll be left behind if you don't keep up you've got to keep up the keep up in god's university and what i love about god's university you don't even have to be able to read all right oh god because peter couldn't read all right but they had to take note you have been with jesus you see revelation glory glory glory hallelujah you see when somebody speaks something people take it this way like i put that glass here with half the water inside what somebody see some people say half full some people say half empty you see the negative people will say it half empty version the positive person said half full it's the same glass same level but two different pictures being seen but when revelation comes it's the same picture so what god does when god brings revelation by the cliff he bypass the intellect and it comes from heaven straight to the heart so there is no interpretation in between there was no man in between there was no senses in between when the revelation hit abraham our old man oh glory to god he said i'm gonna have a son the doctor tell him you're crazy he said i'm gonna have a son he said you're more crazy i'm going to have a son he said why are you saying that abraham he said because god said so and once god speak it he said my word come on now shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish oh god you could hang your soul upon the word of god there's going to be a revival there's going to be a mightier point of the spirit hallelujah hallelujah glory to god real spiritual faith only recognizes the word so it's not my father do this i'm i'm cooking with that i'm a brother cutting off here i'm a sister doing that forget that forget that hold on to romans 8 28. and we know all things work together for good to them that love god glory to god this one walk out every life let them walk this won't do this let them do let them do whatever they want to do god said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you even in you [Applause] god has something to prove with his children let me see it good god have something to prove with his children you think god will have a devil slap you up and tap you up and match you up and you are son and daughter of god the devil crazier what is it touched up my anointed do my prophets know him do you know that you are anointed do you know the anointing come to catch you oh glory to god whose son are you now glory to god godly spiritual faith only recognize the family no family or no family friend or old friend godly spiritual faith only recognizes the word [Applause] satan has come upon wife sit in a stomp on husband sit in a stomp on children people don't believe that i see people saying we don't believe right after peter said that what the christ jesus said are gonna have to be crucified he said nah and she said get behind me satan same brother who said the word of christ same brother girl what rebuked you the same same chapter you know who the body christ get behind me satan thought when the christ get behind me satan jesus said blind jesus only devil trying to bring peter in the atmosphere to throw him in a human instagram that he'll get a big piece of problem to head to calvary [Music] nobody wants to go to calvary jesus heal the sick raise the dead cast out devils my god everybody coming in messiah they're looking for the liver they're looking for a modern person that control the roman government and so on the anti-government and the anti-rome olu them with bread and fish now everybody following them one time just say he said only come from the world you know we're looking for a better fish i catch earlier better than fish he exposed them after five thousand seven thousand people and he had the and he gets them in the corner sitting there he said i've heard in all times hate your enemies i say love your enemies do good to them that do evil to you oh good when they thought the man converted sword and fight and fight roman covenant and i hate them back in the hate never hit them back he said no you don't know i fired for truth that was moses say that but i say unto you oh glory to god and the one who said i say unto you he said upon this rock i will build my church so where did your pastor come inside that where did the pastor come inside where the prophet coming inside that very evangelist and the pastor coming inside that when jesus i will be my church don't you understand that we could speak from now until 10 hours from now except the spirit revealed to you unisa revelation same condition so the first thing the devil does is to fight you from being in the spirit because this is not kingdom hall there's no give a witness this is not a lecture this is not a talk show there's not entertainment this is the word have to go forward and the spirit have to take it up and drop it inside of you that is anchor in your soul your mother can't take it out after that your father can take it off get a big one and lucifer himself big bad wolf he can't take it out also okay the lord a shout in the house listen to this to show you how powerful this thing is when god told abraham to offer up his 10 12 year old son isaac upon the mountain and abe and listen what got telling on the mocking i shall show you go and even tell them in advance so you expect god to tell everything in advance it doesn't work so you know you just hold back a lot of things you know to see how you're going to walk by faith how you're going to make them walk by fight them step by step you just hold back a lot of things you know and let your trend and walk by faith and you're staggering and you don't know what you're going but you're moving and when abraham reached what's at this mountain now and all about men are wrong him hear what abraham said i and the lad we go up and and the lord be coming back down oh glory to god that we tell the man that's not what he tell god you know you have to offer by zach okay so he come to the altar now he comes isaac is that guy stripper i think he's 12 but he's sharp and he's smacked he said daddy i see the wood i see the old table i see no offering and then the father is even wiser he said god will provide for himself a sacrifice and although he's telling his son that he'll hold isaac tie up his hand drop him on the altar tie him on the altar come along with the knife and when he come in with his night god saying stop it hold him in i know you love me i know you believe me oh glory to god i remember the stephen and when when god tell him that there was a ram tied up already [Music] you know it tied up a tangle up it'd wrap up it's right there to be sacrificed or give the lord a shout and if you want to get to that ramp you better get up the mountain oh give the lord i shout hallelujah and when abraham saw that realm he called that place brother isaac jehovah jireh isn't that right god has provided god will provide you've got to get an experience of this jehovah jireh that he's a provider oh glory to god there was no ram and now there is a ram oh give the lord i shout he could provide you with food he could provide him with shelter people could provide you with comfort he can try there with blessing oh he's a provider this morning come on you young people go to the provider oh glory hallelujah thank you jesus [Applause] let's continue by faith you are saved is that right but listen in accepting of your faith god confirms your feet by the baptism of the holy ghost if you say you believe and you don't get the baptism of the holy ghost then it's your faith isn't accepted in the sight of god you've got a mental feet instead of a hard feet oh brother of it there's two kind of faith yes there is one is a mental fate and one is a heart feet or spiritual fate when you truly believe god god is under obligation to pour the holy ghost on you on you not you are the holy ghost that's a lie on you he's gonna pour it on you like he pulled on peter you see we don't have power in ourselves unless god gives it god have to give you power and they have to have a promise of power coming to you and he said you shall receive power acts 1 8 after the holy ghost come upon you your mother can't give you that power your father can't give you that power the pastor cannot give you that power only god himself could do it oh give the lord some praises people [Applause] [Music] if you look and live you hear the gospel preached on the basis of the word that settles it you are here right there but here we go you cannot be healed by mental faith you have got to be healed by a real living faith from your heart remember the man that was blind came in the prayer line with the brown and pray for him he said you are healed and you walk out there like blind as ever he said but i'm not here he come back again and make her next runs back in the prayer line he said i told you you're healed but he was a catholic and his faith had nothing to rest on you see so god have to give him the word he said go and say by stripes i'm healed now what's that that's the scripture as you would know that's the word that god could ride on that's the conduit that the spirit could move through that like a pipe not like a wire that's where the current can go through the current could pass through the wood so here it is he's selling newspapers at the side of the road extra extra by shrapnel heal extra extra buy it by ship i'm here people mocking him people laughing him he is bearing the reproach for the world by his stripes i am healed he's speaking that coming out of his mouth he's going to get the haircut so he's in the barber chair and he's staying by stripe i'm here and the baba making fun of what all of a sudden his eyes pop open what happened that mental fate dropped the inside of his heart and it produced a manifestation of his actual healing all glory that god had dropped from head to heart all glory to god and the healing was produced it was no longer mental something it was a living reality oh glory to god do you believe that hallelujah my you said no you cannot be healed by mental fate you've got to be healed by reliving faith from your heart no matter how much you woke up here no matter how much you disbelieve up here if something down here tells you it's over it is over that settles it there is no more fear at all nobody could tell you any different you don't know why you believe it it's not reason it is faith you just believe it and that's the way it takes place you believe it and go on no matter what your sense of knowledge would say it's not in reasoning remember the woman couldn't have a baby and the prophet dustin lori have a child and she went among some friends and some you know women talk gossipers and whatnot and didn't believe it after a while and whatnot she came back to brother branham and says you know barbara my you know i went among friends and didn't believe it and what that he said what did he say because when he said thus say lord that's the third level that's his vision that can't fail he said what did he say he said whether i believe it or don't believe it it's still happening why because thus said the lord at that third level you don't even count in the picture oh glory to god it's thoughts here the lord what give the lord some praises when lazarus was dead and jesus said lazarus comfort lazarus can't say i ain't coming are you feeling left to come that was vision there when that word the voice of the archangel went on to get lazarus strike his soul bring it to the spirit bring it back into the body he had us to raise from the dead and when god break vision all your family all your loved ones anybody that you were connected with glory to god happy right i give you your two sons oh give the lord i shall that's the realm the bride will be going into that's the rate i'm adopted son you'll be going into oh the spoken word oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus all right let's continue he's talking about patience and so forth he said the biggest part of our fate is mental fate say faith is a big circle the biggest part is mental right and that faith here watch by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of god you see people like to say fake my hair here in the wood but when you look at it deeper and you slice it neatly you recognize there's two things there faith come here and hearing with the word mental fate mental fit here in the world but that mental fit is to become a spiritual faith here is how this service today is important it is very important oh this means more to you than you think because a lot of people don't have the revelation they think they have they have an understanding they have a knowledge they read it they know it but do you have a revelation of it because revelation is prevailing power shelter prevailing power revelation is prevailing power you know what faith is this is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but it will be oh give the lord a praise glory not your feeling to work out not your opinion gonna work out it's revealed [Applause] and if it's revealed you can't miss it if you try [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's revealed next example jericho walls first thing god tell them take jericho walls the hardest thing how do you take very good words bunch of people with fork and who and cutlass and broom and this thing will cherish run on the wall and go say ticket how are you taking that and go chase joshua and say whatever i guess the chest is it i i going back yes i i go and take give by the commission if god said take it or take in it sharpening saw but in london he said i don't know how but i've taken it and he is sharpening his sword i don't know how i partake in it because god said so he said every place i put my foot on that idol he can't find his sword he can't let us read the bible and what no no no he's shot in his sword he's in the wood oh glory to god and one night he's sharpening his sword looking at the edge make sure it deadly shot because he ties the cut jeb beside the cut oh glory to god all kind of parasites and all kind of ice and ice and parasites and you name them ice we had to chop them up to pieces wasting time with a dull sword so while these sharpness saw here rustle and when he rustled he showed his sword are you for us are you against us he was an angel he said i'm the captain of the host i have a higher rank than you oh give the lord a praise offering glory to god and joshua fell down to the captain the captain said i come to give you instructions how to take jericho walls oh what if adam and eve had wait for further instructions how to multiply oh get the lord i shall know so we will make this trouble but what joshua waited for instructions and when he got the instructions he give it out next day he said here what are we going to do that's leadership you know joshua come and say saints you know why angel talked to me last night and you wouldn't just say hello woo angel joshua he said listen here we're gonna do i want to let you all know that from tomorrow we walking around jericho once every day and on the seventh day we're gonna walk around seven times and only when i beat you to shout you're gonna shout don't feel led to do your own thing sit down and shut up and wait till you get instructions oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god i'm getting excited inside of here oh i feel led always and i'm cuckoo sister some cuckoo somebody with some cuckoo thing they feel late to do this and they want to do this and girly goddamn you do nothing you need to hear the word to get instructions and until you get instructions stay put keep still wait on the lord oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah and here they're going once every day and the people under on the on the walls laughing at them hallelujah but guess what on the seventh day something different happen one spin next spin next turn this is something different today boy think about it all them people walking and they don't have a clue what's going to happen then tell them the world is coming along bring that kind of away another seven trumpet praise god and the trouble begin to sung walls come down oh glory to god a little sister inside a deer his name was rahab hallelujah she hit two of joshua spies and she asked for true token because she know that that angel coming she know destruction is coming she knows all kind of things coming she said i hide all you pray i lie for all you i do all kind of things for only i feed all you i want a true token i want it for me and my family i love rehab she wasn't religious you see religious people they ain't care nothing about their family but rahab said i want for me an uncle miserable hallelujah canty gossip oh glory to god she began to bring them inside the house because they're talking at the hound there hallelujah those brothers who come in with this sword they don't know who rehab is all they get is instructions you're gonna see a house in the wall with a with a red cord hanging down don't touch it that come like the blood when i see the blood i'm going to pass over don't touch it whatever in that house don't even touch it oh give the lord a shout and god will take you under covering and when you bring your loved ones and you can stab today you could start now you can start claiming them under the blood claiming them in spirit claiming wrong in prayer and when you bring them under the blood the devil can't do them no harm they could watch them but they can't touch them because deliverance gonna come to your house deliverance has come to your house deliverance coming to your house i am talking about deliverance deliverance glory glory glory glory glory hallelujah let me get one more before i go further you may be seated they had to cross the land to go over go tell joshua instructions take the people over the land between you and the land jordan river high water the elders tell joshua let's wait till april that the water go down low are we going to wade over jordan we'll be low water wait over jordan doesn't say thank you brothers are going to pray tonight when joshua finished praying he said here tomorrow we crossing over he said tomorrow we crossing over everybody watching water high but the man of god stepped forward to give instructions that tomorrow we are going to cross over and then them levites those priests are questioning nothing those are men that is in order they take up the act and they start to move with the act oh glory to jordan still high but the moving maniac they walk all the steps going on to the jordan and when they've attached to jordan touch the jordan the jordan open up they knew the same god that opened the red sea the same god oh glory to god could open up jordan that same god could make a way for you this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever okay the lord i shout i don't care what your problem is i don't care what is covered in front of you the god hallelujah of yesterday is the same god of today oh hallelujah [Applause] glory [Music] that's what spiritual faith does if you don't have a spiritual fate and your eyes see the high water the eye will make your pores right there if those birds wasn't in the spirit when they see the jordan river they said oh god no no no i can't even swim i got drunk in that water there i am moving but then brothers wasn't in the flesh they was out of the humanistic realm they were the realm of divine revelation so even though jordan was high there are no instructions what god said is the most important thing all you want to hear is from god the first thing is to hear from god the second thing is to obey his instructions oh glory to god you will be seated i'm excited this morning many people not hearing from god the hearing lies their interpretation the young men's idea they again long long drawn out intellectual sermons they are not hearing from god but he said there is another people on their land under their messenger they're gonna be the final voice to the final age once more the world will hear direct from god you have a promise that the same god that coming among china that same god gonna come among us he's gonna speak to his people saying fire say in power [Applause] glory glory glory [Applause] in the spirit this morning i fear the fear of the feeling in the spirit this is what you have to be in for revelation to break that's why god reject their churches god reject lukewarm churches god reject the intellectual churches he rejected nothing like it no he rejected are they hot or you're cold there's a cold i know you're dead or because you're lukewarm you call me the half how did it get anything [Music] in the house i'm not loved like something other than i like that strong liking i rather you're hot or you're cold hurt for god you love god you're not ashamed of the gospel i am not ashamed of the gospel not ashamed of the son of man or his words [Applause] not a shame wanted to stand for something years ago god taught me my experience people people don't respect you for what you're given to people respect you for what you stand for they get into this they're giving to that and afterwards like a dish rag people take and just wash and wipe the table over with you when they start to stand for something say no like the first place is sadness and when you could say no no it's a powerful thing here that much yes people are wrong tonight yes are you going for a drink yes i go to the party yes you see where they said no you can say no yes i said no i remember when i came to the lord i did my brothers every night here i see my brother and and take me he rest in his bring some cricket match my brother wanted me to go and buy a butler liquor for him to rejoice are you telling my child he said you stand by me are you minding you i say i'm a christian now i can't support bulls i ain't buying no booze and he watched me well no he baptized in jesus name it's better terrier talking about you oh give the lord a praise over i was younger than him i'm his younger brother but i'm standing for something i ain't buying your booze whether you're minding me helping me you're giving me it doesn't matter god say drink don't go drinking oh give the lord a shout i am smoking i am drinking i am running around i knew none of that i called to serve the living god the one that answered by fire oh glory to god that's a call to be served this morning not no paper god not no paper testimony dear brother we don't want to hear that oh give the lord send your testimony [Laughter] oh praise the lord hallelujah all right so what if ever there's a godly spiritual faith what does this faith do that faith recognizes only the word no matter what anything else says it's only recognized the word so when you see you have that something in your heart and people talking foolishness and false doctrine it only hit to the top of your head yeah it can't go down further you know because you see in your heart have a fate you can't explain it but you know something cuckoo was being spoken there you can't explain it because you see you in touch with the original dollar you have the real dollar did you write the whole train that changed the dollar change and have the certain kind of money now or kind of thing knit is somebody printed and make a counterfeit and bring something blue and you put the light in it just say i didn't see the bird i didn't see this i didn't see that hold back your dollar money please that can't work that's a counterfeit you're looking for get in prison for that god don't want to count your feet god don't want to come to viet christian god don't want no photocopy he want you original the original is you oh glory to god you see how they have gospel now they want people to be of their better selves same old self but a better version of it that's not what god comes more for he said you must be born again here i want to better you a better version of you and improve you we're not talking about you we don't want christ coming into you by a new birth by fire burning the snake out your life you'll come here get one one way and you'll leave you're different oh glory to god don't tell me the snake now dear the snake is there fire is here this morning to burn it out if you want it burnt out if you want to change you have to want to change [Applause] so watch he said upon this rock i'll build my church see not upon mental conception of church joining a mental conception of that but upon the revelation when the streams of grace has poured into that mental faith that you got upon this a spiritual revelation i'll build my church one two and the gates of hell so hold your backslidden and the gates of hell oh you get the fight and leave the church and the gates of hell and the kingdom of revelation you have no revelation because the bible said true revelation the gates of hell not mental fate the case of hell cannot prevail against this rock revelation seed oh give the lord some praises upon this rock this rock oh glory to god well you have to know the seals you have to know the fires and the plagues i don't know about dr fauci and the united nations i want putin doing in russia is that right i have no time for them vaccine and what's inside the vaccine you know what in tomato ketchup do you know what in condensed milk you have a really label of them thing with them long long right now they can explain and can't pronounce you know what any soap that you're putting in your clothes if i start something right now a rumor goes you know supposedly stop getting cancer you will stop washing the clothes forget that statement just there going you know i have no evidence soap give any cancer you don't want the bed not supposed to water giving your germs any good stuff bleeding i don't go to hell that's how things are starting people instead of believers everything in the head oh hallelujah praise god god wants you to believe his word glory to god we talk about abraham when lord get blessed if i was a rich man you know even wasn't abram wasn't the poverties of holy spirit the bible said abram was very original and gold and this and that understand that his cousin is family lot get blessed also until they've heard this master the fight you wanna and abram two christian gentlemen say brethren here we are bedridden you have i have babies it was too great it's too great monday the land was too small for them it wasn't doctrine was the issue his size of influence and business and auditions and so was too great you say yeah what if you take left i take right everybody right there take left make your choice and lot use his eyes put your stem to watch sodom end up in sodom where you're leaning that's where you fall you say that my friend but he's a drinking smoking party and friend and you're leaning in the show he's only a bartender you go drinking because that's your friend a bartender he must invite you over his drinks he drinks here he don't do cocaine he's only doing marijuana so he is so bad you know let's make you smoking you know the way a tree leans that's the way you're going to fall so you want to lean the right way hallelujah and once you're in the right way you're going to come out right oh give the lord a shout so then the church is built faith virtue knowledge temperance this was a hidden mystery the devil didn't know god of restoring evil another eve but this one can't fall or can't fail because she's built upon a rock so all through the church ages god is really restoring the statue of a perfect man but he takes seven ages and disguise it under the nose of satan so satan couldn't understand the mystery of what was being lived out and in this age he take a light and shine on it and said this is what happened back there and what happened back there is supposed to happen in you so and you have to have a faith a spiritual fate a rock revelation that is what he's building his church on he put a slab of faith inside your soul and upon that he put virtual power upon that he put knowledge upon that he put temperance upon that he put patience upon that he put codiness on top of that you put broadly kindness and you're standing there like you're back in the garden of eden waiting for holy spirit waiting for charity breathing for the pride's absolute then the holy spirit comes and cements it together so when you have all these virtues here love of god paul call it a bund of perfectness that cement the whole time because if you're doing it if you don't get it cemented you've got leaks leaks in your patients leaks in your knowledge leaks leaks leaks but when god seal it it becomes waterproof seal proof devil proof oh glory to god that come like when god gave abraham not abraham noah the revelation to get by some would and people laugh and they said boy are you expecting rain and that what's so soft that would so pour us god doesn't give all the revelation one time so abraham um noah build the act with this soft word and then god gave him a foot of revelation get pitched and seal it up you know we are pitch right if you go down that road no you're gonna say we've got no revelation i'm not going there but god tell noah take pictures and seal this up and the porous wood was the right material to absorb the pitch and make it waterproof so god is no fool he's the function of wisdom if he said pass some wood software don't ask him and fight up with that just do what he said more revelation coming oh gloria god gave the lord a shout after he built the act and the revelation come to seal the whole thing that back was waterproof and noah could withstand 40 days 40 nights hallelujah praise god so say when these things come then the capstone come the holy spirit cemented together dear is the baptism of the holy spirit that is why it is so short today now here we go now coming down from the holy spirit what has come he will give you here we go supernatural faith spiritual faith here at the bottom so this bottom here is not mental fit are you with me church the bottom here he's not building his church upon mental fate he's building his faith i see mental fit all these guys with the quotations and so on all these um you were nice you were good i'm strong all them things they're just working up the human mind and they're like that kind of preaching you're good amen you're lovely you're beautiful you ain't you need deliverance you need fine your soul see you don't want my god i bounce up a scripture dear oh god have mercy they're actually telling the prophets speak to them nice words they don't want to hear the real word they're asking for a different kind of good thing i will get to it sometimes sometimes not not today today is not that day now that's spiritual faith watching so you'll give your supernatural faith here at the bottom then here we go that spiritual fate recognizes only the word no matter what anybody else says it doesn't do no good that only knows the word if somebody says that this is a miracle is fast that's it only knows the word okay so watch number one coming to you your mental fate right here comes the holy spirit coming down into your mental fate making it a spiritual fate so that is the operation now real faith comes by what the holy spirit coming into your mental fate bring it into a spiritual fate and watch the sound and then the spiritual fate recognizes only the word because that spiritual faith is to take you all the way up remember you're not the instant you are as many as receive him to them give what power to do what to become power to become the sons of god so what god gives you is to become glory glory hallelujah so when you go on a job you don't have it right all the time you just be a teacher grows after a while the teachers just know the class they know the lessons but you start off a certain way that is how life is that's how like a marriage is that's how like how adam was in the garden of eden praise god you have to grow in grace and knowledge the bible says you grow in what you're doing you grow and that's how you learn and if you're not growing you're not learning if you're not learning you're not growing you have to learn and grow you have to get the knowledge you have to get the understanding you have to get the wisdom all of that is learning and growing you come here to learn this morning jesus said learn of me i'm meek and lowly in her learn of me you come here in the learning of the world then you get to understand about god or give the lord some praises when they came out of ish is of egypt they didn't know god they saw powers they saw frogs and flies and pharaoh select them go and everything else but they didn't know that god was and that is why god tell moses bring them to this mountain that i could reveal myself oh glory to god and when they get on the mountain so and the mountain begin to rock and shake and earthquakes and lightning and thunders the people say don't let god speak let moses speak otherwise we don't want to hear from that fire we don't want to hear from that mountain oh glory to god and god said okay i'm going to come down in that right now i'm going to avail myself in prophets and i'm going to speak so god take all the lightning and the thunders and the voices and the earthquake and rumbling and bring it into a voice speaking to a man and when jesus came on the earth he quoted the scriptures man shall only rebread alone but by every word which proceeded out of the mouth of god god mult are his prophets so god sent a prophet in the last days to bring the word of god to call you as a bride elect of god hallelujah so you're not called by a man a man didn't call you some pastor didn't call you is god almighty call you or give the lord a shout in the house and if god call you he is able to keep you if you are called of god he is able to keep you let me rap again somewhere hallelujah number two number three then you'll have spiritual faith the holy spirit will seal all these things into you as the holy spirit covers this from your faith up to the holy spirit seals you in with christ then you become one and that's a sealed unit of the lord god sealed unit oh glory to god not church but individual sealed unit of the lord god and that and then they are vindicated and placed when that time takes place prophecy they become vindicated sons and vindicate the daughters of god right now we are sons and daughters but when that time comes we are vindicated sons vindicator daughters wit the same signs same wonders say miracles all right let's continue god what okay god alone holds the key the key to what the revelation so mankind gave you revelation devil job is that what keep your holy spirit if you're not in the spirit you can't get nothing so upset anger quarrelling fasting you're not in the spirit hallelujah praise god devil job is to keep you out of the spirit hallelujah amen and when that maniac man coming up to the platform to kill brother branham to beat him up he's on the platform standing there isn't that right i went and 300 um preachers behind him saw the man coming call your custom beating up preachers you hear what i said the man had a reputation the man has come through the service when you're snaking the ground i'll go beat you up coming for this small man there in the pulpit the minister's behind instead of cigarette they block the man they run over the platform so they're looking at eyes fear feelings and they don't want to get licks so they run off the platform but the banana is stood up there so the devil now by words no we pumping words you hypocrite if you take that on you somebody call it a hypocrite how are you feeling about that they get weak they can't go to work because somebody called hypocrite you're out of the spirit already you're in your flesh because you take that personally you're not even seeing like another person talking are you devil talking so but abraham didn't shake up the spirit he sustained the spirit and then something dropped down he said because you challenge the spirit of god you will fall over my feet so he has because you have challenged the spirit of god you shall fall over my feet and a man walk up straight up there right there turn around and fall straight over his feet and the police how does it come and take the man out hallelujah when they say call the police this is another flesh and blood of fear somebody asked brother branham if that man was delivered he said no because you worship that spirit some people love how they are they love argumentative they have arguments with spirit love gossiping gossiping is their thing self when they're not god's appending problems that's why they ask this for the news they're not seeing about the house or home or what they have to do they don't mind their own business the gossip get their mind off your business your ears have to be on the ground it's yours and you're going to pick yours up please get your ass off the ground and start to listen to hear from god stop having your hands on the ground hearing this hearing that oh glory to god try to hear from direct from god here hear god oh glory to god my ex not only wrong you know i'm trying to mind my own business my business is the will of him that sent me and to finish the work oh glory to god i have bought my fattest business i have nobody has business to find oh give the lord a shout and my business my father's business is a starter revival a seven thunder holy ghost sealing spirit of porn revival that's what i'm fighting for every service building after that every go in a journey you know we go into the land of promise this land is the land of the holy spirit there's not humanistic we're going into thus share the lord all right here we here we go oh god holds the key then he said peter said there were the christ the case the version of people against it right so therefore here we go are you ready there is no school no theologians no teachings of the bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it it's impossible for them to know anything about it god has hid the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers and everything else so man studying theology have doctor degree in theology and information and all kinds of things like that and he knows nothing about god that's letter that's the information guys think people study and have their good brains and recall and say it back that is not this we're talking about here when that pillow fire knock knows his music talk he said i know that's why i make moat oh give the lord i shout more they said this more they had this excuse when god finished with moses what they say are going oh glory to god when moses talked to his wife he said

with him she had a little temper to keep him in check but she was riding with her husband where they're going they're going on the egypt to do what they take over oh glory does god hallelujah praise god you talk about faith you talk about faith don't talk about faith that i warrant raise arrests because he killed a man 40 years ago oh glory to god and he didn't even come with that thought in mind he ain't thinking about 40 years ago when they say where i come from he said i come i come to represent the kingdom of the most high god he said what you're bringing for pharaoh i bring in a word for pharaoh everybody bring in cloth and silk and gold and all kinds of stuff but moses here come with a word he said what word he let my people go and i say this morning devil let my people go that devil

right back out but moses just stood there and watched his snake eat up them two snakes and then take up the road and in his mind he said this is wrong number one this only first wrongs tomorrow are coming back oh give the lord a shout let the battle begin and one of these days let's get ready to rumble because the patagonia about to start that is only wrong number one okay the lord i shout devil have your bone in sickness and you're feeling this way and feel that's wrong number one but the bible tell me in my name they shall cast out devils they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover we go in toe to toe run after wrong he hit him with sickness we cast it out in the name of jesus christ oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah my god hallelujah so it's impossible for them to know anything about it god has hid the senses of knowing it from the elected teachers and everything else here's why by the punch it's a personal individual of with the person that christ is revealed to them what fightful are you talking about so fifo ministries stand between god and the people that's a that's that's not the gospel now that's nobody by petition because they're men trying to take the place of god between you and god because god is the god of the audience he wants to speak directly to his people by his spirit right now we're speaking words but the spirit will take the words and reveal it to you as his son our eyes daughter and you leave here with revelation in your heart that your husband no no your wife don't know your children or your family you know the person sitting in front to the side to be behind you don't even know but a rock a faith a revelation is inside your soul [Music] listen not even the pastor could know think about that if he could do anything about that not even the pastor could know because he's not revealing truly pastor in that sense he's revealed by the spirit jesus didn't call peter's side and said peter say say i'm the christian the christ i favor you peter peter peter then brothers don't know you know you see the other guys no peter said that was the christ and jesus said oh flesh and blood didn't give that to you you and what's up you ain't get out in a story you read this in a book that is nice inspiration that is revelation and is my father who give that to you this is what i'm going to build my church on revelation from heaven that was the key peter heard from heaven you have to hear from heaven not your mother not your father not the pastor you have to hear from heaven oh glory to god and your lord the lord himself be saddened from heaven with a shout the angel is on the earth [Music] [Applause] my lord if you say he has been revealed to me then the life that christ produced here in the bible that same life is in him does not produce itself in you then you got a wrong revelation so a man came to be mr mystery [Music] a man came to me mr message pope have all the revelations and everything else no after they appreciate mysteries i want to see the life your life is not useful so we hear a new sermon but life is your life that's why i said it ministry which is perfection when christ is reproduced in natural among human beings so it's not how much word a man could talk i want to see his walk i want to see his life i wanted his attitude to poor people to rich people to this people our aptitude towards this adapt attitude towards issues and problems when things go wrong how you're managing it conflict will always come you heard that teaching praise god it's how your manager conflict how your managing issues how you manage your challenges will show evidently if you have knowledge if you have understanding or if you have wisdom or give the lord some praises hallelujah if you don't have knowledge get it you don't have wisdom ask god oh glory to god that's good for understanding but all these things are there for you let's see i can wrap up here if the life of jesus ever puts out another body of believers it will be the fruit that the first one did they will write a book of acts behind it so we don't have to say this church is it anytime anybody say that you know that is off he said if the life hit a body of believers what would happen where's the fruit of that i know tracks are not books and no tips no it will produce another book of acts you know what happened in the book of acts hallelujah philip 20 if you're on you knock this one one there this one gets stoned this one gets shipwrecked this one get this and that and all can happen in the book of acts people have gone to the corners house that's another book of acts you are led by the spirit of god oh glory not not led by no man you led by the spirit of the living god because the word is anew the secret is what the word is in the bride and she has the mind of christ and oak what to do with the word or what he wants done with the word oh give the lord a shout god want you delivered this morning hallelujah praise god god wants you free this morning hallelujah here we go god is known by simplicity and of revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person a person can read and call right and god could give them revelation oh i love him this morning so he cancelled the university degree cancel the doctorate cancel all the education thing he can bypass all education and give you revelation in your soul and no man could take it out education can't take it out intellectual caretaker though it has to go past your intellect oh glory to god hallelujah my god listen it's not your theology it's a revelation of jesus christ upon this rock i'll build my church no other rock accepted no other things accepted no other roman rock no other protestant rock no other school no nothing but on exactly the revelation of jesus christ through the new birth he's born in there and he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminences to the people that they see the very life and works we're not talking about sermon we're not talking about message we're talking about seeing the very life and works praise god and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest of it not even called to at all watch god's great revelation unfolding here we go are you ready by lack of this revelation is why we have so many divisions among us it's not by revelations we have divisions it's the lack of it it's intellectual men humanistic realm aha it's just three realms daily humanistic realm preaching the gospel you're watching a man who have complexes behind the pulpit you bring them complexes to the people you know a man who insecure behind the pulpit as a pastor minister that insecurity will manifest with how we handle the people they want to leave you he had hurt and he's fighting others and he's fighting like he saw like sword fighting and they're doing a lovely church more than jesus [Music] by lack of this revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us and so much mockery so much division among us is because the people lack that revelation they lack the revelation the teachers but obama said the teachers the very elected teachers in this message lack revelation of jesus christ that is why we have divisions it's not so much his body like this mother and that brother likes but you know they lack revelation because if i go to the blood and i get the experience of the blood and calvini cross and i see where god pardon me my sins and calls customer my sins and perch me deliver me you'll tell me our next minister he heard the blood yet so he can't say i'm his brother the same blood for me is for he too he do like if he owned the blood i owned up jesus blood i owe jesus blood one day when jesus up on the cross he give it to me and you are lost i just made that offer thank god these people not controlling heaven thank god they're not standing as the gatekeeper to openly get a letter and because when they see your soul they call the legit thank god they're not the gatekeeper oh glory to god i thank god i'm free this morning and for the praise him if you don't want to shout i'll shout for you if you don't want to praise god i praise god for you too oh god have mercy go take a rest like me praise god shake me up turn me upside down flip over my life oh god when i settle back dog i serve in jesus glory to god i want to serve him i love this way is it hard away glory to god you're going to save where you're going when you're serving god you're going to save it you'd rather buy smokes you never buy drinks you'd rather buy gifts or extra outside woman get out of a normal woman you have nothing extra to pay for oh god there's plenty savings when you're saving jesus oh god the liquor store can't get you my wanna sell i can't get you the drug dealer he can't get you no i'm getting here oh give the lord i shout glory to god hallelujah praise god glory listen to this now there are two different types of christianity seems strange but i'm not saying two different types i'll say two different phases with a better word two phases one of them is an intellectual or mental conception of what god has said in his word and jesus christ by way of knowledge and the other is an experimental experience that god give the man in his heart there's two different things don't let let's collect two different ministers two different pastors one is intellectual by knowledge and one have an experience of god in the heart there's two different ministries there my student from influence is there there's two different effects there now one with knowledge the devil could write that the one with experience in the heart god could write yeah that devil is an intellectual part don't you know that 99.9 correct but there's no spirit behind that god's spirit has to be behind it see so when david david handled bay and lion and he come to bring victoria's and bring a mama lead on whatever it is from his father for his brothers because you know the battle hut she brought a little delicacy and thing fish brothers the brothers attitude towards david see where you come for you come and see the battle for so much knights gulag coming every day send me a man they may move in the only shopping store in here do you want to put the big mufflers on the ears because they want to hear goliath so they stopped listening to god no they need sharpening sword polishing boots shining shield and spear and whatnot sent me a man david come and when them brothers rough up david like david about to leave all right they're going and then go out say send me a man who is that uncircumcised david reaction was immediate you know david again look at his size i wonder how we make those shoes for him who developed that spear look at the size of that now anytime they started go that way you're finished david wasn't watching seize you know he said what are you doing here who's that uncircumcised philistine defining army living god so he was just either trying to present himself you know he was just saying who is that and then he said a talk but but i was in the backside of the desert and a lion come and i kill him and a bear come and i kill him he's got to testify and when he's had a test nobody had no testimony at all everybody watching this spoke on the books and reading nobody reading everybody fellowship in the first around the world no testimony so when they hear this young man with this testimony they say we had to hear this in seoul when saul here he's a gunfight gunfight gunfight cause you feeling shame nobody's stepping forward the fight he said i'll give him a daughter if you fight my daughter the one with the protocols my daughter have money division come here for that keep your daughter hallelujah keep your money i'm here for the kingdom of god so i was so desperate for a man to step for the fight even tell god david this armor just mint this is a special armor this this are my ignition on it put it on and david is mind telling him to say but you can't even fight you give me your armor a loser give me um i wonder i didn't want to put on a man he said he said put it on you know you take it off he said i can't praise god and listen you're too stiff you're like doing breakdancing doing that kind of thing so he he can't move he's going like a robot do you say kakao worship god like that david took of all the armor and when he finished he said my god he said exercise himself like that or when he seek or like he ran to me go like that is fit you're not walking you know i'm trembling you know no no you ran down to me good luck then goliath see them so glad get shocked am i a dog this is no respect i'm a big man there's a little boy who sent me yeah that's what god does he'll take the foolish things to confound the jesus the weak things that confront his neither the strong oh yes glory to god hallelujah yes we know the story the lad lose his head and you know what was very unique israel moved when goliath for along with that big stone because you see if they get started going to the rest where david's at the swinging stone like this and he was getting started and then the holy spirit the rhythm of his hands the holy spirit pick up with his swing and it was a guided missile straight to his forehead when goliath for a long israelite move you know i am moving we're going to make sure he did i am moving you have a good light in your life so intimidating when goliath when david tickles what is also one big massive thing you have to take two hands hold it and cut his head off then start about we win just had a shout that's how the praise god because one man had revelation one man had spiritual faith one man who was not afraid because revelation will take faith out to you oh give the lord a shout revelation has put faith inside your soul oh glory hallelujah my jesus prayed that we be one right god was the life and spirit in him and we are one with him we will be life and spirit of him will be in us then earthly carnal intellectual conception and creeds and dogmas will fade out and a new generated born-again virgin experience of the baptism of the holy spirit will take place in the human heart then you'll be one then brother will really be brother then sister will be sister your objectives and your motives and all that you are all that you ever want to be or try to be will be for the kingdom of god no matter what church you represent where you go and what you do oh glory to god there are so many people today who say the holy spirit is not real today when tens of thousands of them are saying it's not so it's mostly poor people people who have been dejected and rejected by the world enjoying the blessing oh glory to god people here we go you know getting the holy ghost people who have been thrown out of the churches because they believe god to be god and they have been filled with the spirit when the church just kicked them out god said good hallelujah they come out of the intellectual group and god will send fire on them some of them have to leave their churches they get fired because that church will finish kill them oh glory to god that immortation is there to fix the body good oh hallelujah the dead angels standing right there pulpit and checking them every sunday morning they're dying slowly oh ken gray dying slowly in the church good lord have mercy similar to a blind poor man he had a revelation he will not see death till he sees the lord's christ the gay my retirement chair for holiday to keep him relaxed at home he's still going to church because he know that christ are coming inside his house the christ had to be offered in the temple so he know he can't miss it he i want to miss a service every time he gets opportunity he is in the temple of god knowing one day the messiah gonna come they say see me and your old man who talked to you who tell you why don't stay home i see you walking slow that doesn't matter i see you looking like you're crawling up to get there but that doesn't matter he said the lord told me i shall not see that till i see the lord's christ no devil can't take me no chariot can run over me no cancer can't kill me nothing can happen until i see the lord's christ oh give the lord a shout here come mary one day see me on rocking outside the temple and as mary pass him the same court that revealed to him he shall not see death the spirit move upon him until he moved now and simeon move his hundreds of women with their babies coming to offer that day but simeon would define revelation he passed this woman he passed this church he passed this woman he passed this church and when he come up to mary he said lord let the silvery part in peace for my eyes i've seen him oh give the lord a shout i was in revelation okay so let's see musician come on please [Music] people who have been thrown out of the churches because they believe god to be god but they have been filled with his spirit they are one and purpose they are one in heart hallelujah who are these people methodists baptist presbyterian catholic jew witness orthodox jews all together they become one not the one creed not the one denomination that's the working of the devil through intellectual conceptions but the working of the holy spirit the kingdom of god in you god sets on the tone of your heart in his control room controlling your emotions are you ready controlling your powers controlling your conceptions making you one with him in fellowship and in love god fills you with love he fills you with power he fills you with the spirit he fills you with his own divine nature and he changes your carnal nature into his nature then you become a new creature in christ jesus we are one not the further our denomination not the further occult or some creed we are one to further the kingdom of god oh glory to god and when you get that kind of change the birds seem different oh everything seemed different you have no enemies they all look sweet you can forgive everything that they have ever done i think that would say sit reading slowly again you can forgive every is everything yeah i think i think i think everything i see in there everything that ever done the bitterest of enemy you could pray for him on the street and put you so all the people on every homie and crossing the street damn trouble you could you could pray for him on the street and put your arm around him and lift him up no matter what creed what denomination he belongs to he's a creature that christ died for [Applause] all right we're in home church here now all christianity all you are all you ever will be is based upon faith in the word all you are and all you ever will be is based upon faith in this world oh my hallelujah oh my then we can have this kind of faith the faith that jesus had christ had and christ's fate was not based in those pharisees or sadducees all those spots and petals and pans and their washing it was based upon the word of god amen so much still christ was the word the word was made flesh and then we can get so transfused by his power that we die to our own thinking and our faith becomes a genuine feat then the life of christ is transfused into us we become a living creatures of god a dwelling place where the holy spirit can send this radiant blessing down through here and win the statue of christ oh my what is faith oh praise god faith is something revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of god so by revelation and the churches today don't even believe in spiritual revelation they don't they believe in the past man they believe in apostle man they believe in pope man they don't believe in revelation that the word could be revealed to you watch the church today don't believe in spiritual revelation they believe in dogmatic teaching of some system we believe it's so this is how we believe it and you nail it down we nailed it on this morning and the people kneel not the christ they nailed not to the holy ghost they nailed our system and when it says that nearly you can't move frozen hallelujah the church's build up so much systems around the world until he shook her off the rocker dumped christ john the baptist right she had burpees once a prophet come bring bull pains what was it back to the word back to the life systems doesn't have a life it's only god's word has life systems are built around it but it doesn't have life oh my hallelujah praise peter jesus oh my thank you lord let me see wrap up here now we know this one remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts and the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless look at today it exposes satan revealing his works okay watch he fight he cannot stand that he knows he knows they would develop if the people get the true revelation of the true church what she is what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits working within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit which stand he sinner withstand the antichrist spirit satan will power us before her he will be as definitely taught today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over in the desert satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot reveal against us but we will prevail against them oh my hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah glory hallelujah watch he said we'll not take just an ordinary study to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the holy ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from god it will require supernatural instructions not just student comparing voice with this do that is good praise god as i said already this book of revelation is the confirmation of the scripture it is even placed exactly right in the canon of scripture at the end you know why it says that anyone who reads it or even hears it is blessed it is the revelation of god that will give you authority over the devil and you can see why they who would add or take from it would be cursed it would be so for who add or take over from the perfect revelation of god and overcome the enemy it's that simple oh my blessed be the name of the lord praise god so i'm gonna my god where do we go from here i've got to wrap up thank you jesus but i didn't get to one of the key things that i have here maybe on next week or so i'll see what law will do but but one person had a dream and we know the dream and there was this rock and with writing on it and then take a crowbar and rip off the writing and he tell him look on this and he was going west to get the opening of the world the seas and so on he said look on this and the ministers was looking at this and when they recognized he was going up and down and disappearing they move away you see very few state and look on this look on this on that pyramid look on this hallelujah nothing has been written there unwritten word it was called i wouldn't get an unwritten word look on this can you find it written oh what is it look inside and see what inside that it's a lie that will thunder oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god praise god blessed be the name of the lord all right i'll wrap up here you're gonna pray something he was praying raise up mighty men raise up mighty wires of the fate open this year law that hidden manner that rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of god cap off the pyramid of our life lord put the caption in christ jesus upon each and every one of us oh my hallelujah then he said pray may all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age lord be unveiled to us that we will see the plainness of god so we will know how to behave ourselves wait a minute you mean the mysteries is to show god in his plainness that we can know how to behave yes because your behavior is what sets you up for adoption god only looking at how you will behave how you behave watch and correcting ourselves and bringing the members of bodies into discipline to it matthew 20 for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man went on early the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard and when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day he sent him into his vineyard he went out about the third hour and saw others standing island in the marketplace and said go ye into the vineyard whatever is right i will give you and they went their way again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise about the eleventh hour he went out found others standing idle said unto them why stand here idol they said unto him because no man had had us he said to them go ye into the vineyard whatever is right shall we receive and when even was come the lord of the vineyard said this george call the laborers give them the higher beginning from the last unto the first and when they came that were had at the 11th hour they receive every man a penny but when the first came they suppose that they should receive more and they likewise received every man a penny and they had received that they murmured against the good man of the house saying these lasts have woke for one hour that was made them equal unto us which i was born the burden of the heat of the day but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong this does not agree with me to work for a penny take that is dying and go thy way i will give unto this last he was unto thee is it not lawful for me to do what i want with my own is dynamic evil because i am good so the last shall be first and the first shall be last and drop the bomb for many be called but few are chosen the seventh angel's message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11th hour gentile workers to receive the same p oh my my my my my my and this is it finally watch the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now i am not talking about this book of revelation and you i am talking about all revelation it is tremendously important to the church do you remember in matthew 16 when he said huru men say the son of man watch the watch it wasn't upon peter it was the revelation read it this way flesh and blood had not revealed it but my father had revealed it upon this rock revelation i will build my church the church is built on the revelation on thus saith the lord may the lord bless you could we stand and give god some praises father god i thank you for your word today may the holy spirit take it and reveal it to your people lord give them prevalent power give them strength lord may they understand that all revelation means
