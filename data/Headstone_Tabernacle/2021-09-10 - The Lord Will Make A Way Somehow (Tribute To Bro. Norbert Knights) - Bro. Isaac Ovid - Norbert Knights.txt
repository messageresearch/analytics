to the other shore and brother knights was a person who had a passion for to serve the saints duplicating the tapes have a passion for the library to make sure that there's food in the storehouse and it was that the library was effective and he served and you know in the midst of his faults and he had them the midst of his failures and he had them in the midst of his weaknesses and he had them in the midst of all of that he was humble and sincere and honest and i admire that and his reputation of his honesty i know it it was all on his job he reconducted himself and so on and he was somebody quick to admit his false quick to correct things he was a willing school and i want to say tonight we salute him as one who serve god's people may the lord comfort bless inspire protect his family until we meet all meet so let's bow ahead as we won't have a word of prayer even now heavenly father we thank you lord and this was not something that we planned or prepared but you know the boundaries that you have set that we cannot cross and tonight i pray that in this virtual room that every soul here be inspired that their hearts could be prepared to see you lord because we don't know what they what our when our name or number will be called we thank you for spending our lives that we could be witnesses lord of souls go into glory people that have passed through our lives and you have allowed them to somehow walk into our lives and bless us and bless our homes our families and even up to yesterday one brother lyndon sharing home just three weeks ago he helped to pass him by brown eisen he was so kind and helpful and offering tea and you know the cool conversation and atmosphere after recently talking with him he's telling me he lost all the desire for the things that he's so interested in he loved electronics he loved the duplication he'll have all these different things and all the desire just left god may we take note that all what we think so dear to us so close to us all the material things soon someday we'll just feed lord as we see time blending into eternity his book is closed there's not a comma a full stopper exclamation mark could be added his

christ bless the family father come for them strengthen them bless all those in this room tonight father god may have visited them with your love your presence and power and most of all with your grace because there's grace that we are saved by all works a lot of one knowledge but by your grace lord and we thank you for the grace you have extended to but i know what the life and time that you placing me on the earth the grace that you're extending him to sleep as a hell in the church the grace you you give him to serve your people the laughs the joy the things he shared and he could be a real funny guy but lord we thank you for his life we pray a bless this evening session in jesus name we ask it amen at this time i want to turn it over to the co-pastor with isaac and he would assist us and guide us to the rest of the service tonight isaac amen god bless you thank you so much uh brother certainly want to greet one and all for being with us here tonight special greetings to uh but anton who's here their family and their well-wishers from near and far and i'm also seeing we have a number of international visitors here with us as well from new york from lagos nigeria so we greet you all in the precious name of jesus christ and we do have a sort of short program tonight um so i will reserve what i want to say until later on when i am scheduled but we do want to invite a few brothers suggest share a few words uh about brother knights unto the family and unto the church and we want to start off tonight with our brother terence uh ovid so brother terry um if you would something great good night saints greetings in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ you know myself from our nights we went we go back a real long distance in the 70s we were in enterprise in the 80s we passed through for a spin city in the 90s we went to san diego you know he was living up upper said babs i was doing western vibes i just want to share a few things that stay in my heart with the nights and his experience you know when he wanted to make a future in the police service he went into the barracks and after a couple of weeks he couldn't stand the treatment was given to recruits they were insulting them dehumanizing them kids and different things and he said this is no place for a son of god to be in you know and he tell me he said one morning he got up and he got done in prayer and he prayed and cry to god and we had to leave when the inspector came in the back that morning check on recruits all his baggage and stuff was all packed ready to leave and they expected what is wrong with you he said i no longer belong to this institution he shocked the inspectors of christ he said no longer we've taken this humiliation and he's leaving and they took him to receive the superiors and he spoke to them and his but what is your future what you will do and you send the lord to make a way you know and that was so significant because he had his wife and his family and he made that stand for the word of god it so happened that we went south and my father was a licensed inspector he had some serious condition for the nights and it shocked him over the job and work and i applied for the job as a licensed specializing officer and he got the job and his future went that way i know he was a brother that never compromised and i could remember that when one brother from the church was going for his license and he went to the office he met by the night he was happy that but the knights going to be the officer taking him out on the road so robert took him on the road brought him back inside when he came in i told him he failed several nights he failed me say yes i have no choice so say not ready for the road yet something so i spoke about a night i said so you feel with jason you say yes he said he is not ready he can drive but he's not ready to go on the road because he will be one of those that would be causing accent but he's not disappointed but he learned his lesson but nice never compromised was a brother or not a brother he had to pass the test and later on jason passed the examiner on but the night was one guy never ever compromised when they spoke about all these licensing officers always said there's one person like officer that is not taking bribe he's standing firm when that corruption from parts of the institution the center arima the correctly introduced centered chagonis and different things because of a stand for the lord and stand as a brother not a compromise i remember when the young people was having our first young people meeting he decided to have it in his father's house and that was a momentous decision and a history this historic decision also that when we went here and we got it for the first time the young people the pillar fire came down the holy ghost came and it just came to the window and tackled all these young people and it was such an experience when nobody father came he didn't look in the room he was amazed he was scared he said my god what have they done to these young people they were all spread out on the ground and people are coming from different parts of belmont because it's on a hill and the noise was recognized in the valley and one sister began to sing and she was hardly moving her lips but she was singing like an angel and we were hearing organs and abs coming through the windows and filling the whole house it was a real tremendous experience for the young people and that started revival among the young people and you know a couple years ago about two years ago i know but he i've got an archivist he always has things from way back he wants to know but remember the step you say yes and you get the fear all old messages and different things about two years ago after a series came when he had a piece of paper a piece of copybook page and he was folding it up he said read that when i opened it out it was some prophecies from since 1982 amongst the young people that he just brought and hand me and one of the prophecies was that god was speaking he said do not follow your friends your friends do not know the way i am the way and i will baptize you with the holy ghost that was in 1982 in 1983 the baptism was also poured and the revival started and you know we've been together he'll even opposite bobs and iron my rifling horse and babson different places together so we had a real tremendous time and then coming down in life when about 15 years ago his wife died and you know he was going through a time of depression and different things and we've got to them myself i've got a clown's clock and one day we went to the mall to fellowship and the satanist and he is talking about you want to go with the lord and this that he does not happy time to eat and clarence turned to me he said terry we have to get a wife this brother are we going to lose him so god by the way i'm going to my wife and sister grace and says the grace praise the lord thank you for the service that you have done for our nights over the years with all his faults and all that he's been through and the part of his sickness you know and then coming down when he started to get sick you know i have this similar problem with pee inside pain she used to lean on me but then he started having more pains and more suffering than me and different things so i started to answer nobody have to fight the opinions and do not live on the anti on the um painkillers because you get a custom thing and be a bad thing for you because this is one of the things that happens a lot of people that they get hooked on the painkillers we started to ease off the painkillers and will bear the pains and then when they say battery i have so much painkillers toward them send me two cards of being pleased to help me because he was taking it on and off on different things you know coming down later on he told me that they want to operate on his back let me tell them not his back he's too old and last year he said god give him the allotted time of three scores and ten and he is going to make it nothing going to stop him from seeing his allotted time that one different treats wasn't 10. so he made the streets close and 10 last year he said everything after that is running up so i believe that but a nice new he was about to leave because he tell me that he have decided to take this surgery on his posture he was seeing it as a way out and on friday when i spoke with him told him he shed you for tuesday and just to pray for him he was so positive about this surgery that he's going to take that he was seen like it was relieved about all his pains and was affliction so i believe in my heart he was prepared he made certain things right and ready for his family different things and he was prepared because after he came out of the surgery he asked his daughter he said i am alive she said yes you're alive so it was something like if he didn't expect to come out of his life he expected to go with the lord so nothing is altercated you know god gave us boundaries we just cannot pass we'll all miss our brother he has shown tabernacles one member shot today we'll miss him for his styles that he has taken over the years to give counsel advice to pray for the sick and the things that he have done amongst us as an elder i will miss him and we'll be fellowship and give me some good advice and different things and i would like to say to the family that be strong because he stood and faced all the challenge in his affliction and in his suffering he stood he's still tall standing on the lord's side he has fought a good fight of faith he has finished his course now he has gone on to his reward it fellas what among us and with his first wife and all the saints that has gone on before so i want to say to sister grace and to all the children may the lord which is a blessing be upon you all may the power of god overshadow you and strengthen you in this time of grief may he comfort you as only he could comfort you with his comfort of his love and may you be strengthened in the lord to know that your father has gone on your husband has gone on to be with the saints no more suffering no more heartache and more pain and to all the members of the headstone family tabernacle family may god richly bless you and pray one father and pray for the nice family i will lift them up and pray and see them through in this time god richly bless you hey man thank you so much brother terrence at this time i'd like to invite uh brother michael blackman uh to say a few words god bless you brother mike goodnight brothers and sisters and in the lord tonight i just want to share a few of my memories of my precious brother i called him more than a brother he was my buddy he was my friend and uh like like brother terry we lived for a while close to each other he until we lived in saint bob's and i was going down in belmont no one became my friend i mean we shared a special friendship which was based really on the fact that we kind of helped each other carry all burdens noble and i became very close when i was going through a rough patch in my life and uh he would come and visit me guy was working you know and i have free time and so on and you'll be on the road as a licensing officer uh and he would be out on the road and he would pop in to this school where i would um in order to understand he'd sit down on fellowship and you know he really strengthened me he really strengthened me um he was somebody that i could share my innermost fears and feelings with and um he did the same so there was that that mutual respect for each other that mutual love for each other that mutual understanding that sometimes we need somebody to help us carry that that load we know that jesus is there but sometimes jesus needs hands and feet that are real so that no one was was was that that brother who stood shoulder to shoulder with me and that is when our our closeness grew and as a story with with let's see um unnecessarily said there were times when and nobody would um you know with a little depression a little negativity about a situation or something and you know i would encourage him i would tell him something you know um based on the scripture and then he would you know his responsibility you know i never saw it like that mike you know never i really never said like that thoughts you know and he would get changed man that was the nice thing about nobody know that once you could show him something from the scripture he would hold on to it and he would he would write that and that would strengthen him so tonight i really want to tell you lord thanks for having had the experience of having somebody like brother knights um you know he had his wheeze he had he was he was a stickler but doing things the right way so i would say that he he was always seeking excellence uh even in terms of the the church with the videotaping and so on we will talk about that many times you know i'm training up the young people behind the cameras and the the library and stuff you know so he was always reviewing what was being done with an eye to doing it better so he was never content with just being good and you know i remember saying that good is the enemy of excellent of being excellent and nobody wasn't content with being good nobody strove for excellence and you know sometimes that might have made him seem like a hard task master but um if you understood what his motive and objective was then you know it gave you decrease to deal with um with him at times when he wouldn't settle for what somebody else was quite content and happy with and it might have seemed like he was nitpicking or finding a fault but really what he was doing was pushing someone or pushing an operation or something that was being done he was pushing it to to get into that that that level where it would be they would move from good to excellent as brother who said a funny side i remember uh several several meetings and you know fellowships and so on then we might be celebrating somebody's birthday or something like that that time the trip was very small and we were donald for the supreme brother nathan as our pastor and you know we would we were small churches at the time when everybody lived in the same community so we would be what we would get together very very often each other's houses all the time and um no one was the one who would with the tell a little joke or a snippet from something that happened in his life you know um all nice looking fun and i would be his rival so i remember a particular birthday at a brother what was going on to build the lord and so on you know where we were trying to all do each other but you know little jokes that had everybody you know laughing and rolling so as much as he was a very uh you know very serious person in terms of how he executed um how he's he functioned in his role whatever whatever you gave him or what to do you know if he was in charge of something and similarly with his family you know um the bible speaks about how and how a person who wants an officer in the church how they should run their family or they should rule over their family and nobody took that to her but he also had a very light and juvenile side which we also enjoyed and um nobody was one who has terry said he never compromised on his integrity i after a while you know people had his reputation group people knew who he was his reputation preceded him so that um i could remember more than once walking with nobody through the streets i think he would have visited come on by me maybe like you know sometime after school and let's move on we'd be walking back to tom for something and all no one would after they stand up on a corner and look at the taxi drivers breaking the law and they all knew that man from the time he stood there you know you will see people straightening up getting in line doing whatever they have to do so he had a reputation for for being a no-nonsense type of person as well you know he believed what that you should always do what was right and that you should always be doing the right thing as terry said i've been relating to me that they had sent him to san fernando he salted the island because they wanted him to clean up some of the current practices that were going on going on up there and he was telling me how some of the people would have collaborated to try to keep him away from from doing just that you know but he was a fighter and um no but like i said you know we shared each other's mood and of course there was a sense of sadness on my part uh where we moved apart for a bit because he lived in the east of the island and i was in the northwest uh so that i couldn't visit him as often as i would have liked to um of course there was always a sense of sadness in that this last leg of his journey i could not have been there to give him the kind of support i would have wanted but i always felt comfortable in the fact that there was a brother popcorn cruise by it was clara exclusive and um actually when we when i found out when his daughter um told me his condition with his septic shock and i was praying i was saying to the lord you know well you know if you want to take him you know there's nothing we could do but i mean we really would like to have him around a little longer and i was sharing with somebody that i was actually sitting down and seeing myself spending a couple days in a week by nobody while he was comparison you know see if he came out of it that was my intention you know to spend some time with him because i i knew that if he came out of it we will have to to support him in order to strengthen his mind strength his spirit and that kind of thing so that is what i would like to to leave with with with with the brothers and the sisters tonight that nobody was what you call a brother's brother he was someone who would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you who would go with you through thick and thin with all compromise as terrorism but he was always there he was always supportive he was always there to create and whenever whatever rule or function that nobody took up he's true for excellence and i remember where the corporate shame with me that nobody would have said to him if anything happens during this operation remember that i have run my race i have finished the course and i think he would have and incidentally he was quite wrong he shot the church several times by winning the fun video dash and family days nobody knew he was so free to foot but yes no one has run the race and he has finished his course and it was a pleasure to have had a brother like this so close to me and as an older one and an elder of course i would have learned a lot from him but he was never never too too big or never so far above anyone that you could not share with him that he could not learn from you all he asked is that you would have some ground some grounds some foundation based on scripture for your advice and he was open to it so to the family to the family to his wife and his family i just want to wish them all god's blessings and grace and i just wanted this drop this year a couple days before nova pass my wife told me she had a dream she just woke up at like four o'clock in the morning she asked me how is normal i said well he's okay he's preparing for an operation she said you know i had a dream that he passed and she was sharing with me afterwards that he looked very happy when he was leaving so you know there's a scripture which says that you know we sorrowed not as the others in the world sorrow because of what we know where we know they are and nobody was looking for a certain quality of life after the operation and if god chose to take him it means god lose them from that word that quality of life that he definitely was not enjoying on that last day because of his health issues so we in a way we can be thankful that he's now in a better place no more pain no more sorrow and he's living a much better life so god bless you all saints god bless the family may they be strengthened may god give them grace and your may they do all that love they know nobody would have wanted for them as they continue along their julian life god bless you thank you so much uh brother blackman we really appreciate that at this time i'd like to invite brother george congoley to say a few words i wanna extend greetings to everyone listening especially the immediate family of baronites wife and children and in-laws nieces nephews wherever they may be tonight i really don't know what to say tonight so i have decided i'll i'll read a little something here and trust that it may be a comfort to everyone and it goes you say here not long ago about 150 years ago there was a great christian in the southwest united states his name was daniel quarry a wonderful man a godly man a sainted man a real christian a man that everybody taught so much of a wonderful person the story goes that he died where he went into a trance and he said as he went up to heaven of course when he died when he got to the pulley gate the caretaker came to the door and said who are you and he said i am the evangelist daniel quarry i've won thousands of souls to christ and i want to come in this morning my life's journey has ended on earth i have no place to go now so when daniel curry came there to the gate they went in said well we'll see if you got your name here they looked all wrong and they couldn't find any name he said there's no daniel curry here he said oh surely i am an evangelist he said i want soul surprise i've tried to do the thing that's right the caretaker said sir i'm sorry to tell you but there's no daniel quarry here he said but do you want to appeal your case you can't appeal it to the white throne judgment if you want to but he said we have no mercy for you at all because you don't have you you don't have your name here there's no mercy for you he said do you want to appeal your case he said sir what more can i do but appeal my case he said well then you can go at the white rune judgment and appeal your case there daniel curry said that he felt himself going through the space for about an hour said he came into a place it got lighter lighter lighter lighter he said farther he went the lighter it got it was a hundred thousand hundred thousand times brighter than the sun ever shined and he said he was trembling trembling and he said when he got into the middle of that light he heard a voice say were you perfect on earth he said he just came out of the leg he said no i wasn't perfect he got trembling said did you always play honest with everybody he said no said a few things came into my mind that i wasn't exactly honest about said no i guess i wasn't honest he said did you tell the truth in every case in your life he said no i remember some things i have told that was shady i never exactly i was never truthful just exactly he said then did you ever take anything that did not belong to you anything money anything else that didn't belong to you said he taught a note he was a pretty good fellow but he was condemned he said no no i took things that didn't belong to me he said then he wasn't perfect he said no i wasn't perfect said he was looking any minute for the blast to come from that great light from where the dove rested condemned he said this then he heard a voice behind him that was sweeter than any mother's voice he had ever heard said he turned to look and the sweetest face he had ever saw sweeter than any mother's face was standing before him and he said father daniel quarry stood for me down on earth it's true he wasn't perfect but he stood for me he stood for me on earth now i'm going to stand for him in heaven take all of his sin and put them over on my account and you know tonight we [Music] we have made a stand for christ we have stood for christ and none of us are perfect we have our faults but the thing of it is that we stand for christ we have taken a stand for christ here on earth and he has taken a stand for us there when we get there the scripture tells us that absent from the body is to be present with the lord when we leave this body behind and we enter into that presence thank god for the stand we made here we'll have someone there who makes us stand for us and may god bless the family may god bless the spiritual family the natural family may god bless all who listening and may god bless us all as we continue with the program god bless you guys thank you so much brother kindly we appreciate that there's some i'd like to invite brother clarence clark to say a few words good night god bless um i just want to read through the scriptures first this is taken from saint john chapter 11 verse 11. these things said he and after he said unto them our friend lazarus sleep it i go with him that i may awaken out of sleep next script is thessalonians 4 for this we say unto you by the will of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself descend from heaven with a shout our voice the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and we men shall be caught up together with them in the air in the cloud to meet the lord up in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these weights i'll take this these scriptures you know to kind of bring it in the context of bella knights in the sense of well nice was a brother he was a father he was a friend and there are so many things you know all the brethren testify of all that he used to do his is his jovial his his his excellence in in trying to get things done is stickler for being right and you know trying to get things in order and that is true and like i said as a brother i i had i have added or now the privilege to his last legs of this race in that um as a brother despite of the conditions he was in and the pain he was in many times you know we carrying carry him down to the hospital or whatever and we will be talking and or something he come across by me or i go our cousin and we will talk and many times as you see conditions of life comes and we will share things with each other and as a brother many times i learn and receive so much comfort from his wisdom not just his knowledge his wisdom because the he had a way of you know taking the knowledge and putting him in potential context that you know the timings be right so i recognize that there was a wisdom about it and as a brother i learned a lot as a uh as brothers we share things as a father sometimes i and all sometimes we will talk and we most of the time we talk about each other and you know i know there are some inner parts of him where he will be so ingrieved you know because he wants so much first children he really loves sure and he tries best to be a certain way and i know sometimes as you know we know that many times he he do things a certain way as brother uh black one say he was just trying to strive for excellence and sometimes it is misunderstood you know and i know manchester you know children maybe think he was a bit hard but is that is his love and trying to be the to get them to be the best that they could be as a result of that i know many times in the painting and we will pray we will talk we will laugh you know and like i said there was so many things that we we cherish together as you know and i i received from him from our fatherly context as a friend well i couldn't ask a better friend you know i mean uh you know i will miss him i i know i mean you know the things that we go through the things that we share um yeah so much and it it it you know there's a song that say um when we are sunday party give us inward pain but we shall be joining heart when we meet when we meet again and it's something like that because you know as a friend like i said so many things that he taught me so many things that many times you know i know sometimes i go down in a kind of depth of depression in that you know in our way you know things burning you know and when you talk to him the way he have a way he will just say things comforting he might make a joke and bring it in such a way and you know so [Music] i just want to say to the wife sister grace keep strong brother nice as everyone say he run his race his final legacy to the children i just want to tell you that your father really loved you and he constantly pray for you and one time brother where to your preacher mentions that um not because somebody sleeping i i i try not to i did for this for him i wouldn't say he's dead i say he's sleeping because i i wouldn't say goodbye i would say until so as he sleep at now you know i wanted to try and remember those things that he tried to pass on to you try and remember the wisdom that he had to share because i know a lot of a lot of times it was misunderstood but i'm sure if you look back now you can see a lot of things that he would have told and share with you uh when you go contrary later on you see it woke up if you didn't do it so i i just want to say it to the children try and remember the wisdom that your father showed and the things that he tried to get to you all and remember he he have prayed and i know god will answer this prayer to the church i want to say that as one brother say we'll miss her so there but i take these conditions to show that you know when one go down to the dust and go to sleep it should give us some encouragement for us to recognize that they are waiting on us we have something because they they they will love to be here but for we for them to be here we had to bring them back so these this this this this this to get us you want to put it but as you say we sleep it he's sleeping it's something that we should realize that listen this is only giving us an incentive it's not something that we should we will get paid we will feel good but it is something that is to remind us that listen they are waiting on us we need to come to that to that point we have to get the holy ghost we have to get to that point that we could become what we need to be so the voice of that resurrection could be true us because as i read this script here jesus said i go wicked and at some point in time that same jesus must be in us we've got to find that place these are encouragements this this this passing on is to just provoke us to recognize hey we got to do something because they depending on us so i want to say that am happy and thankful for the time that the lord has crossed our paths and give me the opportunity the vibrant night's friend brother and he being a part of me and i want to just thank everyone and those that are listening uh just just just know that we have something to do and better night is waiting on us all the rest of bridging are within us so come on let's rally wrong together where the world is concerned get our lives together clean up and get prepared because they will cheer on us god bless you thank you so much uh brother clarence courage you bless you so uh give me once again friends and on behalf of our pastor and the ministry we really want to express our deepest condolences to the family but the night was very special to us and it has fallen my lot to also say a few things and to give a very brief exhortations in church so i just want to read one scripture before i start tonight and if i found a scripture that i believe describes by the night's life and his testimony and you'll see where i go with it by the grace of god is it'll be this in isaiah 43 and reading from verse 1 but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine when thou passes through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers thou shall not overflow thee when the walk is through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy savior i give egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and saba for thee sins that was precious in my sight thou hast been honorable and i have loved thee therefore will i give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for i am with thee i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west i will say to the north give up unto the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth even everyone that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him yea i have made him may the lord bless the reading of his word shall we just pray heavenly father we thank you tonight for this body of believers friends family well-wishers who have gathered lord not because they have nothing better to do but because of a life well-lived a life of purpose a life that has touched us in so many ways that we feel compelled tonight to pay respects to honor his life and to take something from him that we can remember so may you bless the reading of the word may you bless this short word of encouragement exhortation lord and may you bless the family in a special way may you you comfort him may you be with them may you bless the church and may you be with us we commit this lord time into your hands in the precious theme of jesus christ amen and amen for as long as i've known myself i've known brother nobod knights he was not someone i met as i was growing up he was just someone who was always there so much has been said and quite honestly we could go all night speaking about brother knights but i would just like to share a little about his dedication to the service of the lord i remember services in arima where the knights would come with the video camera to set up to record these services he pioneered video recording for the church as we have today his are the shoulders that our tech team still stand on until today as has been said he had a desire to see things done a certain way he captured understood and embodied the vision of a ministry of perfection he would ask questions that would seem critical not out of a desire to criticize but to ensure that we were constantly working to find a better way and ultimately the perfect way but a knight served in almost every office in the church he was an usher he was a deacon he was a trustee and for most of his later years he served in the highest office he could as an elder in the church standing shoulder to shoulder with the other elders he stood watch over the affairs of the church and was an elder with oversight over the library and most importantly he operated as the aide they come to the pastor his was the duty to help manage who would see the pastor after a church service a position that he took very seriously when a visiting minister would come to minister it was by the knights who was charged with ensuring that the minister had everything he needed when we hosted our annual conventions it was by the knights who had the great responsibility of overseeing the logistics of getting the minister to the tabernacle he was reliable trustworthy committed diligent disciplined and above all else he was a believer he believed in jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he believed that god sent a prophet with a message of deliverance and restoration that would take us back to the bible to the rapture to the resurrection he believed that no matter what you were going through the lord would make a way somehow if you really knew brother knights you would know that was one of his favorite songs the lord will make away somehow you don't have to take my word for it we can go back to the permanent record of his life and find where he testified that the lord would make a way somehow so for a few minutes i would like to take a title the lord will make a way somehow and before i speak just for a few minutes on it i would like to take us back just for a few minutes for another night if you would come up please amen and just grace us to the stage you appreciate our brother tonight amen amen first tonight [Music] people happy to be in the presence of the lord tonight let's give another shout out praise amen a ship that tossed and driven batted by an angry sea when the storms of life origin its fury falls on me [Music] i wonder what i have done to cause the lord will make a way he will take away his sorrow so let him have your burden sometimes the lord bears long so heavy [Music] the lord will make [Music] i try to do the best i can but when i try to do the writing [Applause] he was present on every hand so many [Music] [Music] courage cause the lord will make away somehow the lord [Music] [Music] so let him have your builders now but i find [Music] often there's misunderstandings [Music] all of all the good i do i go to friends for consolation [Music] i find them complaining too i look up and i wonder why more good fortunes pass me by [Music] [Laughter] the lord will make my god so let him have your burdens now sometimes the lord becomes so heavy the wind [Music] the lord will make a way [Music] he works in ways he will be [Music] with love and strength for each new day he [Music] god bless you [Music] amen you appreciate that song this evening and uh brother nice really really really really believe that and you know it's one of the first uh thoughts that came to me the lord will make a way somehow and but the knights really believe this and he sang it and when i believe this that the law will firstly make a way because he is god he could make a way where no way exists he can make a way when you cannot find a way he could make a way but this song which is a message in song is not just that god could make a way but that he will make a way it is a positive declaration that should inspire us all that god will make a way god through his word has made promises that have been fulfilled he made a way then he's making a way tonight and he will make a way he made a way for noah he made a way for abraham he made a way for david he made a way for joshua he made a way for paul he made a way for daniel he made it away for brother branham he made a way for peter he made a way for brother knights and he can make a way for you and i tonight because he's the same yesterday today and forever it is not just what he did but tonight he is making away we had a zoom room tonight and through this a way is being made right now for somebody but the knights found the way that god made for him somehow tonight a way is being made a way to salvation redemption perfection holiness peace away is being made to the holy ghost the revival tonight is part of somehow because god could use anything he could use anybody and he could use any meeting to make it possible for us to be reconciled with him i believe and brother knights believed that the lord will make a way somehow for us to have fellowship again i believe and very nice believe that the lord will make a way somehow for this church to come to perfection to bring on the resurrection somehow the lord will make a way somehow to restore your joy the lord will make a way somehow to restore peace the lord will make a way somehow to heal families the lord will make a way somehow to mend the broken pieces of our lives if you're backslidden tonight i can guarantee the lord will make a way somehow to restore the fact that you are here tonight is the lord making away somehow he is still using brother nice somehow brother knights like samson is doing more damage to satan's kingdom in his death than in his life because somehow i believe that there's someone on this call tonight that the lord wants to make a way for you as well the life that by the knights lived the testimony of his life the fact that you are here tonight and that pulsation in your heart is all by divine design tonight but the night is testifying not just that the lord will make a way but the lord made our way somehow because where he is he is testifying there's no more pain there's no more sorrow no more sickness no more sadness little did we know that but among us brother granville and so many others would have gone before to be there to welcome him now he too has joined the ranks he has been promoted to that group of believers who are waiting for the resurrection waiting for us to come to perfection somehow and i believe that the lord will make a way somehow for each one tonight i want to see by the nights again and i've said this so many times when i've been asked to say a few words at homes and at families and if it were not for the pandemic we would have been at that house tonight and it's the bible said it's better to be in the house of mourning than in the house of laughter in the house of mirth because it brings a deep level of reflection contemplation it really shuts you down to what really matters to what is really important and when i heard it i reflected and i said look how this pandemic denied the fellowship we would have normally had and the cadence of what happens when you meet in church and in a certain rhythm and i was saying to brotherhood at the end of this whole journey you know the the form of the army would have changed because we would have lost some and gained some but i made myself a promise that i want to see by the nights again and in order to see by the night again the word tells us only perfect love could get us there so somehow the lord has to make a way not just has to do it but he will make it so i want to encourage you tonight as i get ready to close out there is a way god has a provided way i feel so positive to have known a man who found the way it was all around him it was inside of him and as the words of that song said trying to do the best i can that was his life that was his testimony that was his declaration and for each of us tonight we could leave this meeting when it is over with a commitment to live the best we can and to acknowledge is not just our strength but it is the lord to make a way somehow he will make a way for you to connect to that provided we i encourage you friends let the life that brother knights lived be an inspiration to us all don't turn your back on god but a knight stood for something he had principles that could not ever be compromised so i encourage you family friend neighbor well wisher believer the lord will make a way somehow can we bow our heads a word of prayer we want to pray a special prayer for the family tonight our gracious heavenly father lord we have come together as a body of believers lord and to hear the words from all that i've spoken and shared and lord encouraged and brought just snippets lord of a life well-lived lord as but a black man said we sorrow but not like the world we will miss our brother but we know that he's in a better place but he's also dependent on us to get into a place that we could connect to that place and lord through your word you have said that lord you're gonna make a way lord because when we come to the end of our strength our efforts our abilities it takes you to take us to where we need to be so we come tonight lord with a burden on our hearts lord for his wife sister grace for all of the children for all of the family members the grandchildren the cousins the nieces the nephews lord is his his his sib lord everyone that's connected to him lord and even lord as whether george said his natural family and his spiritual family that you would comfort each one lord and he would place into each heart lord not just lord of passing comfort but the comfort to know lord that he lived for you and lord and you made a way for him he found that way and he walked in that way may you bless each one tonight lord who made the sacrifice to come to the meeting lord may you be with the family in a special way as they go through what needs to be done to prepare for lord or the funeral and lord all the needful responsibilities that need to be put in place even considering this pandemic and the various lord situations and restrictions and the dynamics of all of this so father may you be with them and lord be a comfort me a special blessing lord go upon the family knowing how are the nights lived for you and sacrificed and dedicated for you may you pour out a special blessing upon them may you bless everyone in this room tonight lord maybe there's someone who lost their way can't find their way may they leave with the confidence and the fate that lord you will make away somehow it doesn't matter how far they have gone it doesn't matter what has gone wrong you are still able to take the broken pieces of our lives and put it back together again lord we can't explain lord what your great plan is and how this unfolded in this way lord because your word teaches us that your thoughts are above our thoughts and your ways above our ways but we know within your divine plan we were all supposed to be here tonight because you are a deliberate god there's no haphazard nature with you there's nothing by accident so father may these words and every encouragement that will resonate in the hearts of your people be with each one lord and touch each one in the precious name of jesus christ as we sing a few songs with anthony has to close out tonight near the law ritual bless you with anthony amen praise god amen do you love him tonight hallelujah appreciate the message [Music] amen let's give him praise tonight [Music] but you hallelujah it you made a way standing here not knowing how we get through this test but holding on to faith you know that [Music] that nothing can catch you by surprise you got this in control and now you know that you you made my way when our backs were against the wall and and we're standing here only because you and now we're here [Music] and looking back on where we come from because of you and nothing we've done to deserve the love and mercy you've shown your grace was strong enough to pick us up and you you made her away whoa when our backs were against the wall and it looked as if it was over you you made a way oh and we're standing here only because [Music] [Music] and we're standing here only because [Music] wrinkles there's nothing oh
