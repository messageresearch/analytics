granted father in jesus might ask it amen and amen at this time i want to turn it over to brother gideon who would uh let us know of the proceedings god bless you brother gideon good evening everyone you know truly it is a blessing and a privilege to be guarded here and you know for the last week we have been hearing about this special service that we want to have tonight and this was a level of excitement that i i'm really really in anticipation to see what the lord will do we have put some things in place we've actually had some presenters engaged that we really believe will be a blessing and an inspiration to us tonight and i want to invite you to really tune in and listen and see how god will work and how you will be impacted before we do that however there's a little um quote a little excerpt of the prophet's message that we like to just listen to briefly and then we'll get into the proceedings right so i invite you to listen with us exactly right then these children of israel these shadrach and initiative and ego gods witnesses god's never been without a witness he's always now here i want you to get this real post god has never at any time been without a witness on earth amen he's always had at least one man he could put his hands on and say that's my witness it's come down to one man one time job was his only witness abraham in the in the land but god had a witness somebody's going to witness for god somewhere now after a while we want to find out what a witness really is at this day all right notice these men as they went down there they refused to eat the king's meat drink his wine and they refused to bow to his image they were a genuine true witness of god then there are sometimes a penalty goes with the witness sometimes when you witness for god you have to suffer a little bit remember when the mother told you that you couldn't stay around home as long as you read the bible and carry it on or some of the neighbors said of the children said at school you was a fanatic or something because you was a true witness remember on the job how old a man laughed at you because you was a real how on the streets you were made fun of when you give a testimony but that's a genuine sign of a real true witness god wants witnesses not some people say our testifying church that's good but brother let your light shine in the dark places out in the high edges and the highways in the bar rooms out down the street everywhere you're at let your light shine as a witness amen notice then the fiery trial come on and every man that will witness for god will have to go through fiery trials isn't it strange how god leads his people very strange just as soon as jesus was baptized he went into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil just as soon as israel come out under the blood circumcised the holy spirit leading them in a form of a light right straight up to the red sea and there hard mountains on one side desert on the other pharaoh's army coming and the red sea cutting them off his name god led him right after that place want to get glory then moses prayed and god told him to step right on down towards your red sea holding his stick out in front of him and as he walked the red sea move from one side to the other right across the red sea why god's path led through as soon as it come out right into the wilderness of sin strange god's path led right through that great temptation there when they murmured against god they went from their own from one murmur to another from one trial to another as the old song says some to the waters sun through the floods some through deep trials but all through the blood that's god's way of leading leading his testimonies his witnesses now when it comes time to test of the fire shadow rightly shackly beneagle said our god is able to deliver us from the fire furnace but nevertheless if he doesn't we're not bowing down we're going to die [Music] i like that i like that old courage like old buddy robinson he said lord give me the backbone like a solo that's the kind of witness to thee courage god likes us to be courageous he told joshua before he crossed or said be thou very courageous for the lord thy god is with thee where so ever without god you say what if god would tell me like it did joshua i'd have some courage to he's told every believer the same thing amen i'll be with you always even to the end of the world i'll never leave the norfolk station courageous let's go take the promised land god gave us a promise let's be a real witness so amen so we appreciate that clip we appreciate those quotes at this time that you know that just put things in context for us so we would be inviting a couple witnesses to share with us their personal testimony of sorts you know things that they would have gone through the way that god would have inspired them things that that they would have been able to overcome and however they presented i want you to listen and see how you could learn how you could absorb it and how it could impact your life god could use anybody tonight right so with that said i'd like to invite uh a brother a deacon in the house of the lord none other than brother andy henry to start things off do you appreciate brother andy let's put our hands together for him right so good night everyone y'all hear me fine right all right good so i am i'm deeply honored tonight that i was asked to share a little bit and i'm gonna do my best a little nervous another custom to this forum but nonetheless got the praise right so i tonight i want to speak about um something that happened you know in the life of my wife and i about approximately two years about and um i believe that most people would have known about it as when our son alexey got sick in church and we had to rush him to hospital and all that and is is is so fit in the the um the excerpt that they played that scripture branham uh mentioned as well to his one is actually the same scripture that i have here that i wanted to start off with it's it is it um joshua chapter one and verse nine it says have not i commanded thee be strong and offer good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whether so ever dog is there's another um portion of scripture i want to share with you guys as well too is psalms 139 from verse 7 to 10 and it says where shall i go from thy spirit or whether shall i flee from thy presence if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell thou are there if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall i hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me and i just want to start this all saying that situations will happen in our lives that we wouldn't understand we wouldn't know why or what's going on but once we trust that god is in control we needn't worry about anything so is so before the convention this was in 2019 um i think was a couple of weeks before i was praying and asking the water i said lord i want to draw closer to you i want to move that deeper level with you and you know sometimes we see things and we don't really think about it or we don't really have any idea of how it gonna materialize in that sense but sometimes when we ask god for something he grants it onto us according to his will and it's also important to ask in god's will right so the convention weekend came about and we were having a good time in god's presence and all this on on sunday afternoon after the first service the morning service um alex fell in love we had to rush him to hospital and with all the commotion and the chaos and and all these things was it was very overwhelming and at that time we didn't really we didn't understand what was happening like why this this this was happening but god knew god knew what he was doing with us and in our lives so we just we just we just had we just have to to trust him trust the process that he's taking us through you know and sometime before all this had happened i sat down and i was thinking to myself i was like what what is really going on in my life you know like why isn't why nothing not happening because everything you know now i seem like a crazy question right because everything was going smooth you know you're not getting it nobody harassing you yeah you know and as christians we we must be mindful of these things when we when things going too smooth because let's let's use a literal example right and i won't be too long with you guys just a few minutes people don't throw stones at that tree with no fruit you ever see somebody throw in big stone mango tree i don't have no mangoes on it it don't make sense it's like some kind of crazy puss know something right and god doesn't give you more than you could bear if he allows whatever situation to come your way he is more than able to see your truth and we were so fortunate at that sunday that these things happen in church because god god has put the right people around you at the right time you know so is it there's either either to help you a long way or the tessier to see but either way god knows what he wants to bring out of us through every situation and every trial every test that he sends our way because god says it says in romans 8 20 that for we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are the call according to his purpose so sometimes we might feel that i i i'm not really that important i'm not really you know what can i do to help god's people or to help the kingdom of god it's sometimes it would amaze you the kind of things that god will use little not not so much little but so-called insignificant people to do in the time in the right time basically so for example um that's sunday and and just for the record i'm not seeing anybody in signatures just join our reference right that sunday um i think a number of pastors were there and that um with alex he was unresponsive for a certain amount of time no pulse no wasn't getting no no blood oxygen levels all these stuff that they tried he wasn't getting anything and brother ullu and all him all the ministers and they were there and they everyone gathered outside by the gate and the parade for alex all the time he was unresponsive and on the way to on the way to the hospital sister donna was with us and she being a nurse she would do what she was trained to do in that sense and my wife was telling me that there's she was she was doing something called cardiac massage which is sort of like cpr for children in that sense and she was doing it she's just she kept doing it but after like i said after i think was two minutes or so with no responses then when you're yeah you stop basically but she kept going she kept going she kept going she kept going until i think was about halfway into the journey to the hospital alex he actually started to cry which he wasn't doing before he was just lifeless and all that so i mean [Music] even though it was i myself i was totally out of it i was just trying to see yes or i could get to the hospital as fast as possible but all in all god knew what he was doing in our lives because of that's very sad incident we have drawn closer to god the same thing i was asking god for lord i want to draw closer to you i want to move to a deeper level with you spiritually this situation he used this situation to bring that request to pass you know so i just want to say that despite whatever we may be going through we may not know or see or understand why things are happening now but later on the road we could look back and say this is why this happened because god wanted this in this place god wanted me to become better god wanted me what wanted this to happen he he knows everything that happens that is happening he knows the end from the beginning you know and i just want to do just want to say one more thing before i close off here is um like sometimes this this holy spirit leads us to do certain things and sometimes we listen sometimes we don't listen i just want to use one example that after this whole incident um we we had a i think was about either a week or two weeks after we had pre-meeting in church that was before the whole covert thing and i my wife and i we went we took alex we took the boys and we went down and i knelt by the by the bench and i was praying and i said lord i need your strength i need you to help me i need some sort of i need something real something genuine that i could use to push on through to move on and while i was on my knees there praying brother terry he came i'm right there you know he can't see so good he came and he found me where i was i don't know how he did that he laid hands on me and he prayed prayed for me for alex whole family and when i asked i asked him afterwards i said bro terry how how how you knew that i needed prayer he said i heard you in the spirit i heard you're growing in the spirit and i know that they needed some assistance so i just using that as an example that sometimes you know god might speak to us and we may not act upon it but if when we listen to the holy spirit and we obey sometimes that could be you could be the answer to someone's prayers that they're asking for the blessing that they they so desire need and seeking god could be using you to fulfill that request in their lives yeah brothers and sisters so that is my contribution tonight is not much but i hope it was a blessing to you guys god bless you all take care amen awesome or some tremendous brother andy i mean i i am astounded i am excited i don't know what to say if we were to close off right here i have been tremendously blessed already and you know life is so interesting i have known andy for a very very long time and i'm sure a lot of us in this room could say the same you know and you see andy we know his wife and his children and stuff and i remember that incident so clearly when in my mind i would say i know something happened to alex and he had to be rushed to the hospital i i didn't know all the details but hearing him express this present tense first hand as a true witness there i feel a sense of empathy i feel as if i was there i feel as if i know andy and sister victoria so much more and could relate to them so much better having heard what he expressed tonight and i'm sure a lot of us would be very very appreciative and and all of what you shared i think was fantastic i think it was really really holistic and things that we could take and apply i see where life and debt is really the power of the town because we've been saying since last week that today is a special service special service special service not knowing quite how things will truly unfold and here just by this start i think my god god has beaten all our expectations already so i just want to say that we really appreciate you andy that was tremendous at this point i want to invite um and it's my song coincidental but i would like to invite at this time none other than that news that he spoke about sister donald that was so instrumental there to be able to share with us a little bit of her personal experience in her own way what she chooses to to share with us tonight and i'm sure i know it would be a blessing in advance and without much to do i want to invite her to to to share share with us tonight god bless you good night everyone right because on my sins i was asked to share my testimony with you and encourage you in the lord brother gideon told me um i'm not happy brother so i had to write everything down and brother gideon told me it's okay to come off script but i'll try my best to stay on script tonight since i am in no wise perfect or good i see myself as the chief of sinners who i know me but god's mercy has spoken over me and because of that i stand before you today to boast of god's grace and mercy of which i am a living testimony i was introduced to the message by my husband when i met him coming from my seventh-day adventist background it all sounded like you know a different or like a cult because of what was indoctrinated into me we had plenty arguments on the word but he never gave up on me he continued leading and guiding me and god continued to use him that way and eventually i believed that before the foundation of the earth god knew me i enjoyed building services with him because we were together as a family one day he showed me where the church her son tabernacle was located and he told me the name of the pastor for he used to visit them when they were in arima one night that shiren and i were laid to go to the citizenship bonus and i decided to drive to grandy to see if headstone tabernacle if they were church there after service where there was ships and after service sister over approached me and with her greeting i felt very comfortable and one time i began barging her with a lot of questions and she was kind and gentle and she answered them all i continued with the 10 headstone tabernacle on and off the years one thing i took from my meeting that night is that i always wanted to make people feel as welcome as i felt that night helped hence my reason for god bless and a smile after many years i was baptized in the name of jesus christ and even though i didn't get the support of my natural family and cried a lot that day my new family here the tabernacle filled the gap and continually do and today is a special and today there's a special bond between my two families the church family and my natural family my husband tries his best to teach me the word at home for which i'm grateful and each time i enter the gate the church doors and hear the word of god i become more hungry for food as an adventist i knew about god no i know who god is i know who i am he is real to me and i have developed a relationship with him after i heard brother ovid preach word made flesh i knew that that is what i wanted to become when i heard rapturing faith is needed to leave here i began trying to live by faith and believe the more i exercise faith the closer i would be to leave here you see in the early years i hadn't i taught i had enough faith and was excited and ready to go and meet my tea opening i would often tell my family i am leaving just now i know i gonna meet my teopony little did i know that the journey was only beginning i have been quite a fanatic by some and maybe i do this plate at times but i am not taking any chances if god said it i believe it through the years i have had mountain top valley experience and plenty of dead man won but god has always kept his will concerning me and never left me when met with criticism i remember that i am justified and i shall conform in god's image so even though i may not look like much love i shall become just like him there are many testimonies i can share of god keeping his word concerning me but i know that time won't permit me to share all but i can share some of what i learned after my many many trials and testing even though the journey now starts i will stop here and come on script and talk a little about like um what brother andy shared from a nursing point of view with brother alex and how it changed my life also um that day after um alex became unresponsive you know you're trying everything you can and i recognize you know nothing you know and i couldn't believe you're safe i don't know that ca that could happen alice and go gesso you know and i you know i just grabbed him when i recognized he was responding and i started to run outside and um by the gate we you know the fastest pain and you know in my naturalness and self i tell myself why they keeping me back for they holding me back i need to get in the hospital and they're holding me back and thank god that they held me back because what they did they prayed for alex and because they prayed for alex is why alex is here today nothing else and because of that it changed my whole perspective so since the doctors can say what but god's word is true he believed then and have faith now go back to my spirit brother gideon i am never ashamed to ask the believers to agree with me in prayer because he said two or three it shall be done i love to embarrass the devil so anytime i become fearful and i wonder how it goes look i wonder this i wonder that i embarrass the devil i try it out to the group please pray for me the devil is not to have nothing on me god is faithful do i feel him and do i feel him his word does not go back void i do face the consequences of my decision but it's because he loves me be respectful be respectful to his servant if we believe that god is using brother over from the pulpit lord would use them in every situation of our lives yes there were times i didn't listen to god's giving advice from buddha over and i faced the consequences of it i had to repent and i had to apologize god is a jealous god and he will test you with what you love more than him when you hear me shout glory hallelujah i am just trying my best to catch or receive all the promises passing by i always tell the children you know when brother or whoever preaching i say mine so every time i say mine instead of saying mine are looking like a mad person in church i will say glory hallelujah that is mine right i am always trying to respond quickly if god asks you to separate yourself like abraham allah just do it because he will mash up the scene the whole scene but it's for your good i know that i can have faith and still be nothing but i but i have faith in who god say i am and who i would become so i would continue to be obedient to the whole world i am still being molded when things are going bad praise god anyhow it means some funny in your ear but eventually a peace will come in your soul sometimes hardship and trouble comes like waves one after the other tumbling you all over the place they crack at your breath please know that god is in control i used to try to fix my family by pounding them with the wood and worrying always currently never the word the word city would say and i began to get weaker because i was trying to fix them and not fix myself so i decided when i become wood made flesh i shall be able to manifest revelation 22 17. until then i can only dispatch the angels after them i love praising god anywhere anytime and now i'll come on script again a few weeks ago um a while ago i actually church to pray for one of my dear colleagues who had the bleeding her brain so one friday night during prayer meeting i got a call that they said that the doctors called her relatives to say their goodbyes so you know during prayer meeting i can't remember not what number of it said continue you know and he spoke directly into that situation and i told myself if god because he was brought up he didn't even know what was happening because i couldn't call anybody and he spoke directly into the situation i began praying praying we got and everyone was agreeing and pray began praying for her the morning and it's very hard it's not easy to pray no you know why because i don't know telling yourself that is it that is it so every time you talk calm i don't keep saying she does research research trying to draw all the noise of what i know in the morning i got a call and her husband said to come over the top so my thing is how to go visit her when the news regarding night but i say father you chasing me i went across i'm talking my mom so my mom say you gotta go with odd wavering go down i say yes lord get up yeah i wasn't thinking about her then i was just thinking about me because if i prayed one night i would agree and pray that boy would turn it down wrong for her because he did it before how can i not go down to the hospital and expect go to work america so i told my mom i said i'm going down even if i reach by the hospital ward and they say i can't go in what will honor my feet so she said go down and bite go dog and feet so kids and i went down i went to the war they said show the night to you ring and ring in the bell the nurses weren't answering so i looked across the hall and i saw a world wide open so i say lord i'm going across it was high dependency unit when i went across um i went inside and asked him this if she have a look i call her name if she's there selena said yes she is so you know i said go right there so i saw some as she did you know they buying clothes and thing i said there's like half people there she said no she right there so when she i seen her not seeing her so the nurse walked with me latoya was lying down on the bed all she had was up to jen therapy in her nose but no i never had a short glory i'm not a shame i'm not ashamed anymore to death god do that i am not ashamed for no that is them doctors start to move or no but let them move what can i do is for security to put me out you understand so i've had a short glory hallelujah i said good morning latoya you know who is there she said yes i see what it is she say cracky right and then she held my hand so the hand moving foot moving so we start to pray i am not a person who you know she doesn't know where the where god is getting worse just have to pray and then break out and praise our worship rather see the doctors and the father move and give us room you know and you know when i open my iphone praying i see latoya hand up in the air giving god glory that made me shock even more because here you're saying that there's a person on her dead bedding night and goddess come on tonight no man i cannot sleep that wart with my more clothes i had a shot one time i left the whole world but i wanted to reach back and he got the turkey that was going to do i started a shop straight to the wall glory i didn't care they thought i was mad because they told the prophet was my suicidal business you understand so i walked through the whole down the elevator shouting glory hallelujah walked through the hospital or the car park short into the top of my lungs glory hallelujah he i had to calm down before i entered the car since god is real when we agree and it is not one person prayer all of us were praying together a collective prayer we were praying on a green and heartbeat and god answers pray and if and she's still in hospital but god will continue to do what he started okay since the road back to script brother gideon since the road is hard but but um sorry the road is hard but god does not want it any other way we are being perfected apologize quickly because you may never get a second chance ask what each year to teach you to love for love does not come naturally examine yourself often to ensure that you are not hindering yourself an example that i have on script the other day um i had to apologize to someone i love and tell them that i had hatred in my heart for that it's a service that brother uh premier tonight brother can't brother i supposed to talk about examining yourself and i had to examine myself and um i recognized i had hatred i never knew i had that before and i had to apologize to the person to let them know that i had hatred in my heart towards them and to ask for forgiveness and now that relationship is much better by jesus in jesus name sadly when you stop praying and reading your bible daily things start to fall apart even your family life so keep praying up stay with the wound and stay blessed thank you very much thank you very much sister donna kay i think that that was nothing short of tremendous i mean i i'm sure you could see the excitement on my face i have been blessed above and beyond my expectations i keep saying but i don't know if you all see a consistent theme you know we've heard it many many times if you could only get started god will do the rest and you saw in brother and this scenario he was there praying specific prayers he had something to do and he saw those prayers answered in different ways but he did something specifically you know i just want to give two examples of that in a message and in the bible as well the prophet also gives uh an example in which and i'm sure you know you know this story he was at the airport and something told him to start walking and he started to walk and voiceover keep walking and he walked and he walked and walked and he walked until he came up to a house a simple humble room with a colored woman in the porch and right there you know she turned to him and she acknowledged him and said good morning person and he turned back to her and said how did you know i was a pastor and she would have responded and said you know what i was praying i was doing something i was doing my part and waiting for god to show up and we see it over and over again so i feel so excited i feel inspired by it i'm also reminded of this story with the man that stood outside the pool and um he needed assistance to be placed inside the pool in order to be healed and you know the people at the time came and said you know jesus is on the next street that's why you know there's no action here the commotion is on the next street and if you read in scripture it says when he heard that he cried all the more he didn't stop doing what he was doing because it seemed like it was a challenging scenario he took that as a motivation and drive and impetus to do even greater than he was doing before and then he could have seen the power of god blessing him i just want to say we appreciate you very much sister donaghy your words i think we're really really inspiring to us we know that it's heartfelt and sincere and god bless you richly at this time i want to invite a veteran uh a veteran in the field a man who has seen a lot a man who has done turned on quite a bit and a man who i believe we could learn all that from without much to do he needs no introduction he's none other than brother clarence clarke god bless you i hope that you hearing um gideon introduce me or something i i try to figure out who is that what's he talking about you know because i i don't see myself that way it's just a little brother um a little glass that god take up and decide to clean and pour something in him so he could use either you know so uh that that to me well um uh well i could see i think i would just uh start off with a little bit of advice because we don't have much time i want to say that um i came to the message in the 70s 1971 to be exact i [Music] grew up as a little catholic boy you know and um they know anything about message i know about god at the time that god decided to work on me as a teenager coming up young young man there was a two pentecostal people which i was i used to refer to the second mother and father with mr smith they used to be always encouragement to come to church with them but i grabbed as a catholic well you know and they started to kind of coach better be a collider thing like that so i didn't know about this pentecostality so i happened to uh yeah one of their sons was a very is a very good friend of mine and has uh decided to take up the invitation one day that all right assessment i will come to the pedicle church i did that but before going to the church but friend this is a robot which i pray that would save him and pray that your prayer that i say robert listen because i always heard that when you go to these pentecostal church somehow something that's happened you just end up going by the altar there's there's come to the altar something is up so i say i told her about ceremony if you see me going up by that altar hold me back all right because i'm not saying that you know so i said okay so it happened that we ran this sunday and i made sure saddam read to the back of the church they wanted to put me i said no i said on the last bench back in the church uh so this was mighty that is a pastor alexander the giant remover and so happened that i didn't work for the author but it had me thinking and a few days after we started to think i end up going by my nephew this is uh brother lincoln he was working lungs and service and i used to go down there and just lying sometimes you know done work or something and i meet some graduating down there and they were talking about scriptures that thing i didn't know anything about you know bible but in talking to them i was a better thing and they were talking about this profit of this message but i just sit down listening because i had no input as a result of that somehow i started doing a little more and listening to them and where the best decision listens come to mind they come and listen to this this brother that you know in in our school i just hear this manners all right so at first a couple of times i had to say i wasn't going and then one day i say all right i'll go and i remember well it was a friday i well i changed my clothes i remember changing clothes and singing my life and i going to church but i left home walk down mover all right rex and i have to be passing by am i walking down and when i look on the billboard i saw a movie the movie named she now i wanted to see that movie for a long time so when i saw the movie i said what the show tonight i said okay i'm going theater because men go in church again now um back there you know when you're uncomfortable so the first thing you're early so my first attempt is at a storm detail because we have a at that time you know at that time said lamar had treated picture house and balcony so i decided well i know exactly how to escape and stop me now since i always tell this and this is the part may seem strange it is also strange to me in that i knew i went up to go into the cinema i could see myself now going going in trying to judge a fella named jacko to go into the city mata high you know to make sure i stopped the only thing and i can see it now the only thing that i remember is going there the next thing i was conscious of i was walking down in school i mean like i said i don't know what happened that is a blank i don't know if i was translated i don't know if my mind went i don't know i get no memory of what happened there i know i was going and the next thing i remember i find myself walking going on a school looking for this building i don't know what happened it is a mystery to me even up to now all these years but that is all i could tell i don't know what happened now when i reached long uh at school i did saw this little place it looked like with that conversion shop and i saw this guy preaching i decided well look i saw a lady outside and she was peeping and she said become so sorry i it's okay so she said well let me take it before i say no let me say don't take it back so i just sit down and after that i listened what i heard again had me thinking and something happened on the end it's still me and they say well come back to silver sunday i did i was in december and that sunday after that service i got about that in the name of jesus christ and from then that was it now after i got baptized i don't know you felt good i i mean you're lucky on clock night i i like i said at that time you're on fire you know now i've feel i honestly believe that after getting baptized starting to read the messages and things like that i believe that i really was among angels and there was no way i was thinking that you know people could do wrong i maybe myself was naive at the time but when i listened to the word of god this is the barbara message and i started taking and god said to do things to me i really thought that among angels people don't lie and i was going on that road but it take her while then i started to understand the message then i started to understand there are two kinds of believers i didn't understand that at all and as a result of that things start happening you start you start going through certain things and in going through certain things you i realize that people uh start your certain behaviors and you start hearing things in my melting i said what is happening here but somewhere inside there i recognize the lord keep showing me look at my word don't look at anything else look and see what i tell you now i said just to show you this is how god helped me come true all the time i mean you said uh there was a lot of things i meant to bring i can't really talk but that was my first understanding what happened here and then he saved him just look at my wound and i started looking at one word now you start seeing all kind of funny thing going on you're hearing all kind of thing but then you see miracles you see this so in it you start to recognize i started what how i could put it it's like god starts showing me in reality the message in other words i will reach about three kind of believers i will read about certainty and then you will see it you will see these things happening and you realize which i mean this is that but then as there are people that who was around me at the time they see the same thing they fell off the garlic cup and but god keeps telling me keep watching my will forget what's going on at the end of it a lot of things keep happening i'm going to but in it all coming through years of getting that kind of uh now i can see that kind of training to see a lot of things happening take some of the people take something to say and sing something like this but you yourself you you can see the effects of it you can feel the effects of it but for you to stay there you have to keep looking at the world you have to keep looking and after a while you start to realize it's a training and it comes like many times talk about the thing it's like do not look at the tools that god used to train you with look at the trainer and and look to hear what he is telling you and obey what he sees because you can look at the tools because i keep you lifting higher and you put more weight now you will see this i am real heavy but if you keep looking at the tradition the trainer will be telling you what to do how to do it you do not look at the tools because you can go back to the tool you don't look at the the things that is happening and the people you might see you've been used a certain way to get you in a certain way the idea behind just stay focused looking at the world stay focused looking at the trainer listen to what you see it is the oh and i took that principle and that is what kept me all these years that is one of the things that kept me motivated that kept me all these years so i have recognized that as you grow the test get more the trials get more i understand also i started looking at tests and trials and change it to training because at the end of it god is training you for something he's not training you just to be no no he pick you up here justify him wash it out pour something because he want to use you and i realized that listen to do that you have to stay focused so in in here is where i'm saying because of these things that i have learned i am i am just sharing this with maybe it might help some brother some sister some young people in that you're going to be coming through with all kinds you're going to see organic people might be doing all kinds of things if you keep looking at the tool that that is being used because you but you always say the test is always for you the training is for you whatever however however much weight has come upon you that is for you do not look at the two look remember the words that the trainer keep focus on between yeah i focus on the treatment and this is what has brought me to this point this is what has kept me and it's still keeping me yeah there are other things that i learned as i grow but i just want to say this man so that it will encourage somebody that who might be going through certain things who might can't understand what is happening with them [Music] don't do that look at the trainer look and see what he is telling you and obey it is the only way you're going to get up if you're chill from there this is what it takes for us to get optimistic look at the world continue look at it keep your idea and follow the instructions it might take long it might take it it might take whatever but as as as the little excerpt was said god promised he will never leave he will be always there so once he is always there no for a fact that listen that's it if he will accomplish he will finish it and this all you have to do is suggest submit yourself and keep looking at the trader so i i don't want to take up much time again all i am saying at the end of it look keep looking at the trainer keep looking and listening to what he said it is the only way to get out so or whoever going through the little problem forget what you see you know forget who's doing this stay keep your eyes on the trainer keep your eyes on what he's saying do not look at the two god bless you god bless you brother parents we really really appreciate the words that you've shared really appreciate the personalized story starting from from i don't want to see the beginning but starting from a point that we could relate and understand right and even as you reference the excerpt you know i just want to come back to the points one of the things he highlighted and it was shown in the exclusives as well where all the things we go through good bad and different all the ups and downs the challenges the trials the things we made not understand what he actually says is that it's all meant for the glory of god even the stories we hear the witnessing we hear the testimonies we hear as we share it is not because we're trying to turn ourselves into celebrities it's not like we're trying to find out who has the best story it reminds me of the three wise men they came inspired of god they came bearing gifts they didn't necessarily compare notes and say you know what gold seems more more important so it seems more precious than frankincense or move but at the end of the day they brought their gifts came bearing gifts for the glory of god and tonight i think it was so tremendous i want to personally thank brother andy henry sister donald k clark brother parents clark i mean they really shared they really gave they really expressed in their own personal way the way that god has impacted their lives and i think it is not just deserving of a round of applause but i think it's really impactful and i think and i hope that somebody listening whether listening now or may listen afterwards would be helped with would be able to relate and would be impacted positively at this time we want to wind things down i know if you feel like i feel we could go for another two hours i i know you probably feel like we could call four five six persons again but i think we have to take it in bite size chunks we have to internalize that which was said and we have to to use with use wisdom as well at this time i want to invite brother stephen oliveira to close us out to bring bring it to our clothes and we will close our program for tonight on this friday so without much to do let's welcome brother stephen olivery praise the lord bless you hear me amen uh god bless you i wanna really um endorse what brother gideon

is going on around you we want to be able to look at the word stay focused on the word things will be happening around don't don't lose your focus since we want to stay focused on the word by the grace of god it's a training process though look at it the trials has problems but we are in a trade and it's a trade part of the trading process and we want to be obedient to the trainer and grace of
