[52:09] unto you verse 21 whom the Heaven Must
[52:15] receive until the times of the
[52:20] restitution of all things which God had

[52:26] since the the world be may God bless his

[52:36] the time here in worship and singing and
[52:39] music God bless
[52:41] you right let's go so today I have a
[52:45] context scripture and this context
[52:46] scripture is from Matthew chapter
[52:49] 17 verse 10 it says and the disciples
[52:51] asked him talking about Jesus why then
[52:55] say the Scribe
[52:57] that Elias must first come this was the
[53:00] issue Elias Elias Elias and Jesus
[53:03] answered and said to them Elias truly
[53:06] shall first come prophecy and restore
[53:10] all things but I say unto you Elias come
[53:12] already which is John the Baptist so
[53:15] they knew him not but have done unto him
[53:16] whatsoever they listed likewise shall
[53:18] also the son of man suffer of them
[53:21] suffer of them so therefore the prophecy
[53:25] was Elias would come am this Elias which
[53:29] we know is William Marian Branham
[53:31] Prophet Branham he was come to come this
[53:34] Elijah Spirit to restore all things the

[58:27] blessed be the name of the Lord
[58:29] hallelujah Daniel 10:1 in the third year
[58:32] of Cyrus King of Persia a thing was
[58:35] revealed unto Daniel whose name was
[58:37] belti shaza called belti shaza and the
[58:40] thing was true but the time appointed
[58:42] was long and he understood the thing and
[58:46] had understanding of the vision so when
[58:49] there's a prophecy or a word from the
[58:51] Lord you have to seek God or ask God to
[58:56] understand the thing and to get an
[58:58] understanding of the vision so the
[59:01] prophet William Branham he came to bring
[59:03] a prophetic vision for this bride he
[59:06] didn't just come to bring just a way of
[59:08] life because we're living under prophecy
[59:10] and we are living under the closing
[59:13] times of the end of the Gentiles we sit
[59:16] here talking about Jesus and the cross
[59:18] and Calvary but we have to understand
[59:20] clearly why we have that now is because
[59:23] he came unto his own and his own
[59:25] rejected him
[59:26] and turn him down and then God turned to
[59:28] the Gentiles but in the context of how
[59:31] God sees it they were blinded that we
[59:34] might see do you get what I'm saying the
[59:37] Jews were blinded that we get this
[59:39] opportunity to come to Christ as a bride
[59:42] for Jesus Christ oh blessed be the name
[59:44] of the Lord so when God is about to
[59:46] close off this Gentile dispensation that
[59:48] he must do then he must go back to the
[59:50] Jews so under so I want to remind you
[59:53] again the end time is here now brother
[59:55] Bram said say prophesying here now this
[59:57] from God has a provided way now we are
[59:59] moving on into another great age coming
[1:00:02] for the Rapture of the
[1:00:03] church and in this we are living in the
[1:00:07] time of the restoration of the gifts you
[1:00:10] see how you hear tongues and
[1:00:12] interpretation here this morning that
[1:00:15] come back in the
[1:00:16] church when that come back in the church
[1:00:19] along with other gifts that will speak
[1:00:21] tongues and then things will come out I
[1:00:24] remember years ago early Christian
[1:00:26] experience went down to a service down
[1:00:27] San Fernando and somebody service tatan
[1:00:31] somebody being speaking tongues and the
[1:00:34] interpretation come and God was exposing
[1:00:37] sin and telling the ministers about
[1:00:40] covering up and whatnot and let this man
[1:00:42] testify and I was shaken like a leaf
[1:00:44] those days was something else because
[1:00:46] the spirit was speaking people were was
[1:00:48] just dropping on this one sometime they
[1:00:50] drop on on somebody and they're speaking
[1:00:52] tongues and somebody else quite in next
[1:00:53] Corner start to interpret the tongues
[1:00:55] that were spoken and the people couldn't
[1:00:57] deny it if truth come you can deny it
[1:01:00] but God going have a perfect Church the
[1:01:02] promise is the restitution of all things
[1:01:06] Hallelujah I want you to be convinced of
[1:01:08] that I want you to understand this is
[1:01:10] not a as I told someone this is not a
[1:01:12] Baptist Church this is not live any
[1:01:14] where you want to live and then drift
[1:01:15] inside the church this is not that let
[1:01:17] that stay in the Baptist Church this is
[1:01:19] the pressing on to become the bright for
[1:01:21] Jesus Christ Hallelujah and he want a
[1:01:23] virtuous woman he want a woman that have
[1:01:26] faith in him he want a woman that trust
[1:01:28] him he want a woman that trust in
[1:01:30] herself and as a bullhead woman or a a
[1:01:33] bulled woman that he can't talk to he
[1:01:35] must be able to talk to his bride and
[1:01:37] his bride must be able to respond to the
[1:01:40] voice of his word oh glory to God he
[1:01:43] can't have a woman doing she own thing
[1:01:44] she feels to go here she feels she go

[1:01:48] God you want a bride that will be just

[1:01:53] him that would worship Him to Big honor
[1:01:56] and glory to him oh glory to God
[1:01:59] hallelujah hallelujah that Pillar of
[1:02:01] Fire that was hanging by night and the
[1:02:03] cloud by day could you imagine when you
[1:02:05] look up you see the pillar Fray night
[1:02:07] could you look up praise God you see the
[1:02:08] cloud by day how you going in that
[1:02:12] bar how you going in the RM shop could
[1:02:15] we Night by they want to take a look up
[1:02:16] so you say you go back inside you
[1:02:19] know because there's an eye watching you
[1:02:22] oh Glory that eye going to be here that
[1:02:25] eye going to be that's how supposed to
[1:02:26] have it you know there's an ey watching
[1:02:28] you somebody is watching you isn't that
[1:02:30] right praise God so but says now watch
[1:02:33] watch we are living in the time of the
[1:02:36] restoration of the gifts it stumbled
[1:02:39] many fine churches it send nazarin
[1:02:41] backward it may Fanatics out of a lot of
[1:02:43] Pentecost but just the same God is
[1:02:46] moving right on bringing in the
[1:02:49] rapturing faith for his church so
[1:02:52] rapturing Faith have to come in he has
[1:02:54] to bring in the raptoran faith then he
[1:02:57] says that then he says this so
[1:03:00] tonight I represent that Faith sir the
[1:03:05] Fate that was once delivered to the
[1:03:08] Saints in the way of a Divine gift so he
[1:03:12] was saying this Divine gift that I have
[1:03:15] represent the fith because the faith is
[1:03:18] coming and the absence of the faith
[1:03:21] that's supposed to be there the gift in
[1:03:23] me represent that
[1:03:27] so if the faith is to be restored we
[1:03:29] have to see the restoration of the gifts
[1:03:32] back in the church because his gift was
[1:03:35] representing the faith that was to come
[1:03:38] oh the Lord I shout so no Minister can
[1:03:42] lay a set of mysteries on my head and
[1:03:43] tell me that the FI you have to come
[1:03:45] better than that oh give the Lord some
[1:03:47] Praises nobody can bring information and
[1:03:50] the faith because you're ring a ton of
[1:03:52] mysteries you can reveal all the ton of
[1:03:54] mysteries and I'll bring you back to
[1:03:55] Ians do I know all Mysteries have all
[1:03:58] knowledge and don't have the faith that
[1:04:01] comes by love I am nothing okay the Lord
[1:04:04] I shout in the
[1:04:05] [Applause]
[1:04:09] house a ton of people deceiving this
[1:04:12] message you know they dress longer than
[1:04:14] yours Bri you are
[1:04:19] not we not singing message song so we
[1:04:21] not in the bride we had to sing message
[1:04:23] song
[1:04:26] we're not preaching Mysteries not in the
[1:04:28] bride we not saying the apostles say so
[1:04:31] we not in the bride what kind of idiotic
[1:04:34] foolishness is that God have to speak
[1:04:37] and that is why every church is
[1:04:39] Sovereign why because it gives the man
[1:04:42] the opportunity to get access to direct
[1:04:45] inspiration to speak what God lays upon
[1:04:48] his
[1:04:49] [Applause]
[1:04:53] heart you can make the Bible say
[1:04:55] anything in but it has to be in
[1:04:58] continuity yes you could cut a scripture
[1:05:01] in the middle and make it say something
[1:05:03] different Judas hung himself go down and
[1:05:06] do
[1:05:07] likewise and join that
[1:05:10] together is
[1:05:12] that do you get what I'm saying so you
[1:05:15] can't just say things it has to be the
[1:05:18] word in
[1:05:22] continuity so tonight I represent that
[1:05:25] Fate The Fate that was once delivered to
[1:05:29] the Saints in the way of a Divine
[1:05:32] gift restitution that word restitution
[1:05:35] the act of restoring to the rightful
[1:05:39] owner something that has been taken away
[1:05:43] lost or
[1:05:45] surrendered to a return to or a
[1:05:49] restoration of a previous state or
[1:05:52] position that is what restoration is
[1:05:55] amen and you see God has to speak to us
[1:05:57] to give us the understanding of where we
[1:05:59] came from it is very important because
[1:06:02] if you start with your life as a sinner
[1:06:05] that is only part of it you have to go
[1:06:07] before the foundation of the world as
[1:06:10] God thinking about you because if you
[1:06:13] take your life as a sinner and stay on
[1:06:16] that point then you would find yourself
[1:06:18] unworthy which we are of what God has
[1:06:21] done for us which he did God cannot
[1:06:24] cancel what he has already done he
[1:06:27] slayed the lamb in his mind before the
[1:06:29] foundation of the world before he was
[1:06:30] even born he thought of you and he saw
[1:06:34] you it come like where we are right now
[1:06:36] since we were weighing K he saw
[1:06:41] here when I just I do at the altar God
[1:06:44] saw me having grandchildren I couldn't
[1:06:46] even see my own
[1:06:48] children but God could have see that

[1:31:28] [Applause]
[1:31:35] them
[1:31:37] brother also is the fact that the
[1:31:39] prophet for the last age must bring
[1:31:41] bringing forth a message from God that
[1:31:43] will forrun the second coming of the
[1:31:44] Lord by his message amen not by his
[1:31:48] message and a man in Trinidad not by his
[1:31:50] message and a man in America or or or
[1:31:53] Europe or anywhere else by his message
[1:31:57] will the hearts of the children be
[1:32:00] turned back to the Pentecostal
[1:32:05] fathers with the restoration of the word
[1:32:08] will come the restoration of power yes
[1:32:12] say after me with the restoration of the
[1:32:13] word rest will come the restoration of
[1:32:18] power that's God said so God said
[1:32:22] so so if we talk about the restitution
[1:32:25] of all things God s a prophet to gather
[1:32:28] all the word that was scattered Through
[1:32:29] the
[1:32:30] Ages the church ages as we say is the
[1:32:33] unfolding life of the cor tree when you
[1:32:36] put a seed in the ground it sticks up
[1:32:38] and it go up up up stronger and stronger
[1:32:40] leaves and whatnot and then it come get
[1:32:42] a corn the corn in the Cub the corn on
[1:32:46] the I forget I can't describe it with
[1:32:47] the all hating on top of
[1:32:49] it tle whatever call that that corn is
[1:32:54] the original seed that was put in the
[1:32:56] ground reproduced in multiplied
[1:32:59] form so you put one seed and you get a
[1:33:01] whole air of corn this is the history of
[1:33:04] the church ages the original seed and
[1:33:06] the end seed is the same seed the
[1:33:09] original bride and the end bride is the
[1:33:10] same bride he's Alpha and this is Omega
[1:33:14] he's the first this is the last the same
[1:33:16] power that was in the early church will
[1:33:18] be Alpha Church the same power the early
[1:33:20] church had the bride had the last bride
[1:33:23] going to have
[1:33:24] do you see it it's not a difficult
[1:33:27] message oh give the Lord a

[1:40:11] want this seat and you want this seat

[1:40:14] seat because you have a fire to come
[1:40:16] right inside of you special shower

[1:40:21] tap just over your head right where
[1:40:22] you're sitting now inside there nobody

[1:40:26] there and let the fire of God hit you oh
[1:40:29] this message nobody fire of God oh glory
[1:40:32] to God hallelujah all the know passor
[1:40:35] word word word word quotes word
[1:40:37] explaining Bible talking
[1:40:41] talking but when the day of pentec fully
[1:40:44] come there was a man bringing a
[1:40:46] scripture and a text no it didn't say
[1:40:48] that they were filled
[1:40:53] so what God did Luther justification
[1:40:56] Wesley sanctification Pentecost
[1:40:58] preparing the vessel to receive the
[1:41:00] spirit because God had to open a spirit
[1:41:03] door a door of the Holy Ghost no man in
[1:41:06] that age because the spirit I said
[1:41:08] before he had open door that was the
[1:41:11] Holy Spirit to the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:41:13] God open my Open Door anybody could go
[1:41:15] through that door the open door but the
[1:41:19] age of adoption came when God in a
[1:41:21] prophet because he bring the word to
[1:41:23] deal with the spirit that came through
[1:41:25] that open door so the Pentecostal
[1:41:26] introduced the birth with gifts but they
[1:41:28] didn't have the word to get listen
[1:41:30] listen to these words to get the
[1:41:32] discipline to mature them as
[1:41:36] Sons so you see when mothers in the
[1:41:39] natural spoil their sons or spoil their
[1:41:42] children they have no adoption for that
[1:41:44] it's a mommy boy you spoil she don't
[1:41:48] have the authority or the Revelation to
[1:41:51] bring him into full maturity trials and
[1:41:52] Tes and does that so when Mother's hand
[1:41:55] like helicopter parents land on top the
[1:41:57] on the children land whether his
[1:41:59] daughter or or son or whatever it is and
[1:42:01] they screw up their
[1:42:02] lives how they come to
[1:42:07] maturity so you can see I write unto you
[1:42:10] children I write unto you fathers I
[1:42:12] write unto you sons and so on what God
[1:42:15] trying to do get us to spiritual
[1:42:17] maturity that we can handle our trials
[1:42:20] maturely
[1:42:24] so when brother maning adoption he said
[1:42:26] he could he could take your wife he knew
[1:42:29] that because that was his experience he
[1:42:31] could cast you in a bed of
[1:42:33] sickness who doing that God doing that
[1:42:36] he could turn the whole church against
[1:42:38] you do you're straight of the
[1:42:41] church and nobody get nobody have that
[1:42:44] testimony the whole church but he say he
[1:42:47] could do that you but guess what if you
[1:42:49] a son you where you going if the word is
[1:42:52] being preached you don't know if all the
[1:42:54] people going against you church members
[1:42:55] and you are the
[1:42:57] bride if you are and you the bride you
[1:42:59] are to understand if people come against
[1:43:01] you it's church members it might be nice
[1:43:04] you know some people come um um I want
[1:43:06] to say anything but this this is
[1:43:07] constructive criticism you you conr they
[1:43:11] come to nail
[1:43:12] you because they're looking to pick
[1:43:14] fault this is constructive why you
[1:43:17] saying
[1:43:18] that this is constructive criticism you
[1:43:21] know muchis we get build in this
[1:43:22] building
[1:43:24] if I take on all the critics here still
[1:43:27] finish
[1:43:27] yet please do it so do it so do it so I
[1:43:31] had to come down and say
[1:43:34] so if you don't get the clarity and
[1:43:38] determination to do what God want you to
[1:43:41] do and how God want you to do it I
[1:43:43] remember that the time we build in here
[1:43:45] you know why I'm saying this this
[1:43:46] morning no I've never seen I saw no
[1:43:48] church with Upstairs
[1:43:50] Downstairs none look where we are
[1:43:53] we Sandy Grandy if we have a wedding or
[1:43:56] something where you going to have
[1:43:57] function you to go in the hall some
[1:43:59] Civic Hall and something like that I
[1:44:00] knew that that is why the vision was
[1:44:02] this there were brothers who are upset
[1:44:04] because they feel if we just do it flat
[1:44:06] it'll be fine and it'll save us money
[1:44:08] and everything else but that's their
[1:44:10] inspiration why they didn't build
[1:44:13] it but the vision given was to do it
[1:44:16] this
[1:44:17] way let the years Roll by and you'll see
[1:44:21] the effect of what a vision is
[1:44:24] and I will tell you this if the vision
[1:44:26] you could do it in your
[1:44:28] own that might be really a vision that
[1:44:31] might be just ambition most times a
[1:44:33] vision is bigger than you a real vision
[1:44:38] and that should have to be God for that
[1:44:39] to be done a real vision for the family
[1:44:43] for the home for your future most times
[1:44:45] real vision is bigger than you so when
[1:44:47] you speak it most time people ridicule
[1:44:49] it because they don't believe it I
[1:44:51] remember when we were in G there and I
[1:44:53] tell them we we God spoke to me and tell
[1:44:55] me we've been standing gr after a while
[1:44:56] brother Miss bir nobody believe is but
[1:44:59] God didn't speak to him or the other
[1:45:01] buddies so I said doesn't matter I say
[1:45:04] if God said it it will
[1:45:06] materialize that is my thing if God said
[1:45:09] it if I trying to say something that's
[1:45:11] one thing but if God spoke it it must
[1:45:15] materialize but George was there when I
[1:45:17] tell the church I said church this is
[1:45:18] Brother the kindest thing here I said
[1:45:19] this must be
[1:45:21] revealed I said this is some Revelation
[1:45:23] here when the church finds his bloodly
[1:45:24] love and I stood there and stayed there
[1:45:27] until it broke and when it broke it
[1:45:29] broke with Revelation it broke with wine
[1:45:32] it broke with oil it broke with the
[1:45:33] ooint of the spirit and there was no
[1:45:35] doubt it was the Holy Ghost that brought
[1:45:38] a revelation of Brotherly kindness and
[1:45:39] it hasn't changed from that time to now
[1:45:41] we still have access to the spirit slot
[1:45:45] just above that brotherly kindness
[1:45:46] window it have a big Skylight of Holy
[1:45:48] Spirit and you seen the rainbow between
[1:45:50] L and brly kindness there's a rainbow
[1:45:53] Mark Holy Spirit we inside of there we
[1:45:57] have access to what's inside of there
[1:45:59] the anointing that you feel come from on
[1:46:00] top of there oh give the Lord a shout
[1:46:02] that's the holy spirit that is to come
[1:46:05] into the church and here what he said
[1:46:07] the Dynamics of this church will be a
[1:46:10] refilling of the Holy Ghost that we have
[1:46:12] worked in a small measure we still work
[1:46:15] in a small measure this morning oh give
[1:46:17] the Lord some Praises so with the
[1:46:19] restoration of the word bring the
[1:46:21] restoration of power so how a church
[1:46:23] could say they have this and they have
[1:46:25] that and they have the other and zero
[1:46:28] power they have power to spray a mus you
[1:46:31] can get a flick for that you get spirit
[1:46:32] for that no power
[1:46:35] whatsoever so what the Bible says
[1:46:38] restoration of the word means
[1:46:42] restoration of power because you see the
[1:46:44] prophet gather all this kind of word to
[1:46:46] TI back into the word the object to
[1:46:48] bring down the Holy Ghost then he said
[1:46:50] the entire Holy Ghost has visited the
[1:46:52] church to make Luke
[1:46:54] 1730 to make son of man back again and
[1:46:57] once son of man come back he's a
[1:46:59] sore the office of son of man is to
[1:47:02] bring seed seed for who the Pentecostal
[1:47:05] rejected it seed for you so he seed you
[1:47:09] a seed seed coming to seed you are
[1:47:11] attribute seed and now the word seed
[1:47:13] coming to connect with you whether a
[1:47:16] beaten pan whether you're smoking
[1:47:18] whether adultery whatever the condition
[1:47:19] is the condition wasn't What mattered
[1:47:21] What mattered was the seed coming to you
[1:47:24] and once that seed would connect to you
[1:47:27] something begin to happen Oh Glory it's
[1:47:29] a Divine connection something begin to
[1:47:32] happen word connecting to word Spirit
[1:47:35] connecting to Spirit Oh Glory to God so
[1:47:37] now there's a prophecy hanging over you
[1:47:40] it's coming it's coming it's coming this
[1:47:43] bride will be Anointed God will anoint
[1:47:45] his sons God will anoint his ministers
[1:47:48] Oh Glory to God on behalf of this bride
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:55] all right but
[1:47:59] Brown I know this nothing in new but I
[1:48:02] trust that God refresh your heart and
[1:48:04] mind with the words that spoken this
[1:48:06] morning because this is what I got to
[1:48:07] bring this is started just after the
[1:48:10] turn of the 20th century and it was to
[1:48:12] be the age in which the true church
[1:48:14] would return to being the bride she was
[1:48:16] at Pentecost we know that there must of
[1:48:21] necessity be a return into Dynamic power
[1:48:24] the Believers sense this in their
[1:48:26] spirits and begin crying to God for a
[1:48:29] new outpouring such as was in the first
[1:48:31] century what seemed to be the answer
[1:48:35] came as many begin to speak in tongues
[1:48:37] manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then
[1:48:40] believed that this was indeed the long
[1:48:42] awaited
[1:48:43] restoration it was not for the latter
[1:48:46] rain here we go can only come after the
[1:48:49] former rain which is the spring or
[1:48:51] teaching rain the lattering then is the
[1:48:54] Harvest rain how could this be the real
[1:48:57] thing when the teaching rain had not
[1:48:59] come the prophet messenger who was to be
[1:49:03] sent to teach the people and turn the
[1:49:05] hearts of the children back to the
[1:49:07] Pentecostal fathers had not yet come
[1:49:10] thus here we go what was thought to be
[1:49:12] the restoration and the final quickening
[1:49:16] unto the Rapture had not come it was a
[1:49:20] mixture of the unrighteous partaking of
[1:49:22] spiritual blessing and manifesting in
[1:49:24] the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing
[1:49:26] out to you it is also was devil power as
[1:49:30] men were under the control of devils yet
[1:49:36] no one seemed to realize it then to
[1:49:39] prove it was not real these people even
[1:49:42] before a second generation appeared
[1:49:43] organized wrote unscriptural doctrines
[1:49:46] and built their own fences as every
[1:49:48] other group ahead of them did showing
[1:49:51] was the devil making a plan again
[1:49:53] to flip his burger and make some more
[1:49:55] denomination and the word continue on so
[1:49:58] when the Pentecostal rejected the
[1:50:00] prophet God come to the bride now come
[1:50:03] to sweep he said the the word will hunt
[1:50:05] them the word will find them so the word
[1:50:07] found you in Trinidad however it come to
[1:50:09] you if a drunk could bring it to you it
[1:50:11] was the way for it to come to you
[1:50:13] hallelujah praise God if somebody takes
[1:50:16] a B book and beat you in the head with
[1:50:18] it and leave you with it it was supposed
[1:50:19] to come there that way it doesn't matter
[1:50:21] how it come it was coming
[1:50:23] and if God could bring this spoken word
[1:50:25] to you the way he did what about the
[1:50:27] power what about the spirit what about
[1:50:30] the anointing that is to follow this
[1:50:32] word Oh Glory to God this word have a
[1:50:35] spirit to follow it oh give the Lord
[1:50:37] some Praises I I believe that with all
[1:50:40] my heart glory to

[2:07:52] Maybe Might first time might at 3:00
[2:07:54] this evening
[2:07:56] 12 keep laughing one when I run to 3:00
[2:08:00] no laughing already laughing
[2:08:04] go when Adam sinned by heing his wife
[2:08:07] reasoning instead of holding to God's
[2:08:09] word that's what Adam s his wife reason
[2:08:12] with Satan then produced a product to
[2:08:14] Adam and Adam turn lose the word so out
[2:08:17] he lost also his inheritance when he
[2:08:20] lost his inheritance and right to life
[2:08:23] remember the day you thereof that day
[2:08:24] you'll die when he lost his life here we
[2:08:27] go he also lost his inheritance in life
[2:08:31] because he had complete Supreme control
[2:08:33] of the earth he was a god of the earth
[2:08:35] God the god of the universe everywhere
[2:08:37] but his son had his Earth under his
[2:08:40] control he could speak he could name he
[2:08:42] could say he could sub nature he could
[2:08:44] do anything he wanted to but when he did
[2:08:46] that he lost his
[2:08:48] inheritance watch now the the Bible said
[2:08:51] in whom we have obtained inheritance
[2:08:53] this is where your faith get challenged
[2:08:55] because you might be right now you might
[2:08:57] be where you're supposed to be in God
[2:08:59] right now but this is still the truth
[2:09:01] remember this and I want you to remember
[2:09:03] this clearly tonight Jesus didn't wait
[2:09:06] for his disciples to catch the full
[2:09:08] understanding before giving them the
[2:09:10] promises during the Journey of him them
[2:09:12] following him he said the same works I
[2:09:14] do shall you do also he keep giving them
[2:09:17] promises that they didn't have the faith
[2:09:18] yet to handle note when he raised from
[2:09:21] the dead he opened the word and
[2:09:22] understand it to them because it bring
[2:09:24] Clarity because they were participating
[2:09:26] in his ministry but they was not yet
[2:09:29] converted they didn't have an inside
[2:09:31] change they had a holy ghost upon them
[2:09:33] giving them the authority to cast our
[2:09:35] devils and do stuff that is a measure of
[2:09:37] the spirit upon them it wasn't in them
[2:09:41] he said if I don't go the comforter will
[2:09:43] not come and he going to be with you
[2:09:46] even in you so the prophecy for them was
[2:09:48] this spirit Power was going to be in
[2:09:50] them not just upon them do you
[2:09:54] understand that so it could be upon you
[2:09:56] but not in you but the promise is for it
[2:09:58] to be in you do you get that now so he
[2:10:01] had to bring Clarity to the church and
[2:10:03] to the Believers that this thing we're
[2:10:05] talking about called the comforter or
[2:10:06] the Holy Ghost have to come inside of
[2:10:08] you but you have to wait and carry until
[2:10:11] you get power from on high oh glory to
[2:10:13] God I give them the word father they
[2:10:15] have received Thy word but powerful and
[2:10:17] high come in oh the Lord I shout Jesus
[2:10:20] pray that prayer they have received the
[2:10:22] word but Paul was coming and you have
[2:10:26] received the words of Malachi 4 you have
[2:10:28] received the word of the end time
[2:10:29] message but it's coming it's coming it's
[2:10:31] coming it's coming oh give the Lord some
[2:10:33] Praises Hallelujah Give the Lord some
[2:10:36] Praises it's coming it's coming it's
[2:10:38] coming
[2:10:40] Hallelujah the word is spirit Spirit is
[2:10:44] word the word is life all right but Bram
[2:10:48] an inheritance somebody has to leave you
[2:10:50] something to inherit is
[2:10:53] it you don't have an inheritance if my
[2:10:56] father or grandfather leave me a land or
[2:10:58] house that's an inheritance I can say my
[2:11:00] father left it for me or my grandfather
[2:11:02] or my great-grandfather this is my
[2:11:04] inheritance that have a right to it
[2:11:07] isn't not right so to get inheritance
[2:11:09] somebody to leave it for you an
[2:11:11] inheritance what inheritance do we have
[2:11:13] what inheritance did we have God left me
[2:11:16] an
[2:11:17] inheritance now this have nothing to do
[2:11:19] with whether you deserve it or not so
[2:11:21] it's not you know I could b a sin I fail
[2:11:25] I fall I don't deserve that that's not
[2:11:26] the way to think God left me an
[2:11:29] inheritance when he put my name on the L
[2:11:32] Book of Life you say wait a minute
[2:11:34] brother Jesus did that when he died for
[2:11:36] you no never Jesus come to purchase that
[2:11:40] inheritance for me he said watch obtain
[2:11:44] an inheritance look predestinated us to
[2:11:46] inheritance all
[2:11:48] right if God is looking at my heart and
[2:11:50] say will randam I called you a long time
[2:11:53] ago before the foundation of the world
[2:11:54] to preach the gospel I have an
[2:11:56] inheritance an inheritance of eternal
[2:11:58] life now God sent Jesus to make that
[2:12:03] inheritance real to
[2:12:06] me now once you talk about foundation of
[2:12:08] the world before sometime it's difficult
[2:12:11] to even grasp that or conceptualize that
[2:12:14] because you see in you now you are
[2:12:17] challenged to believe that you as a SE
[2:12:21] son existed in God's mind as a
[2:12:27] thought you have to believe that
[2:12:30] regardless of how you
[2:12:32] are now look at you you were in the
[2:12:36] loins of your is the
[2:12:40] great-grandfather you were on your way
[2:12:41] since then you know I'm not talking
[2:12:43] about your mother and your father you
[2:12:44] know I'm talking about before
[2:12:49] that you know was God is see Generations
[2:12:51] before I think the fourth or fifth and
[2:12:53] he see it coming down so you couldn't
[2:12:55] miss being
[2:12:58] here you are not a mishap and they were
[2:13:01] supposed to bought you no that that that
[2:13:03] that's not true you were ordained to be
[2:13:05] here however you come you have to be
[2:13:11] here now this egg and sperm thing is a
[2:13:16] mystery by itself how that does work
[2:13:19] out but yet you come
[2:13:21] so then when you multiply that number
[2:13:23] and see he thinking in God's mind he put
[2:13:25] you in Adam you are seed of God that
[2:13:28] come down through generations or
[2:13:29] whatever it is and here you are and God
[2:13:31] is telling you that this fall we call
[2:13:34] fall was given the opportunity to
[2:13:36] display his attributes and to to to
[2:13:39] display self but he's bringing right
[2:13:41] things back to even because God is just
[2:13:43] he just balanced the scales so this
[2:13:46] battle that of the devil is about to
[2:13:47] come to a complete end he come to finish
[2:13:49] it off so when he come to the Jews his
[2:13:52] people and they rejected it he said I
[2:13:53] will take that Gentile bride so he
[2:13:55] hunted you since that time and now we
[2:13:59] about to finish it off because we are
[2:14:01] the seventh age seventh messenger
[2:14:04] messenger got seven visions and one of
[2:14:06] them was this woman stepping in America
[2:14:09] to rule America Before Destruction and
[2:14:11] we see everything setting up now like a
[2:14:13] chess game H the queen coming into
[2:14:15] position right now Hallelujah coming
[2:14:18] into position and destruction lining up
[2:14:20] and Russia killing time and Ukraine
[2:14:22] killing time and Hamas killing time and
[2:14:25] Israel came in time they're waiting for
[2:14:27] things to get into position I wonder
[2:14:29] they wait for the Bri to come into
[2:14:32] position I didn't hear you I hear you I
[2:14:37] he we not watching them we are watching
[2:14:40] the word oh give the Lord a shout the

[2:14:46] us is inside when you could see what is
[2:14:49] promised
[2:14:51] glory to God then you will understand
[2:14:54] that the next step is for you to break

[2:22:00] meets the life in the spirit the life of
[2:22:02] the spirit it produces whatever the seed
[2:22:04] is so the word itself have a portion of

[2:31:45] order to pray it's now it's now I
[2:31:48] understand there'll come scuffers in the
[2:31:49] last days I understand Nation shall be
[2:31:51] nation in last days I understand
[2:31:52] there'll be tidal waves fearful sights
[2:31:55] flying sours mysterious sights
[2:31:57] perplexity of time distress among the
[2:31:59] Nations I read they were going
[2:32:00] organization I understand that the
[2:32:01] preachers will be false shepherds in the
[2:32:03] last
[2:32:05] days as much as they don't want to
[2:32:07] believe that it have that big churches
[2:32:09] night churches but they
[2:32:11] Falls that will compromise and will not
[2:32:13] feed the people the word of God they
[2:32:15] will use this message as condiments
[2:32:17] afterwards after they preach their own
[2:32:18] thoughts you like ketchup mustard and
[2:32:22] and pepper you open it and you just
[2:32:25] dwting on it so them have their own
[2:32:26] message and they they take butter BR
[2:32:28] thing thing
[2:32:31] you and the people so deceived they're
[2:32:33] sitting on accepting that
[2:32:36] foolishness I a come to hear another man
[2:32:38] message I a come to hear some CUO
[2:32:39] Revelation the go and a prophet he says
[2:32:41] say what he tape
[2:32:43] say because in the tape is laying
[2:32:45] Rapture in
[2:32:48] fith I understand the preacher said we
[2:32:50] for in the last days compromise go after
[2:32:51] Creeds but I understand there'll be a
[2:32:53] voice in the last days crying out in the
[2:32:55] wilderness calling the people back to
[2:32:56] original message back to the things of
[2:32:58] God I understand in the last days
[2:33:00] there'll come a famine the churches will
[2:33:02] be so organized so set and everything
[2:33:04] else in the last days there'll come a
[2:33:06] famine it will not be for bread and
[2:33:07] water only but for the hearing the true
[2:33:10] of God and the people will go from east
[2:33:12] west north south seeking to hear the
[2:33:14] true word but the churches will be so
[2:33:15] organized and tighten up they will fail
[2:33:17] to hear it hear this BM understand that
[2:33:20] he sent Elijah before that day comes at
[2:33:22] the end time he'll have a message that
[2:33:24] will turn the house of the children back
[2:33:25] to the fathers turn them back to the
[2:33:27] original go back to the end and start I
[2:33:30] understand that that takes
[2:33:32] place just
[2:33:35] before the spirit leaves the Gentile
[2:33:39] Church to return to the
[2:33:43] Jews do you understand church that the
[2:33:46] spirit we talking about going to leave
[2:33:48] the Gentiles yes sir to sign off the
[2:33:50] Gentiles and go to the Jews yes sir and
[2:33:53] that is how judgment come in with
[2:33:55] preaching to Eternal loss people who
[2:33:57] cannot be saved people who hear the
[2:33:59] message and play the fool for years that
[2:34:01] still have to come and hear it when it's
[2:34:02] out these signs and wonders now they
[2:34:04] come to church now they justay
[2:34:05] Hallelujah Glory door
[2:34:09] shut I always talk about the foolish
[2:34:12] versions word is spirit Spirit is word
[2:34:15] so even if they go to BU they didn't
[2:34:18] have the word in them to turn into
[2:34:20] spirit because the secret is the word is
[2:34:23] in the bride the kingdom is the word
[2:34:26] turn spirit and power in your life so
[2:34:28] when you come it might be dry it might
[2:34:30] be hard but you're getting the spirit

[2:34:41] is with thee blessed a d among woman
[2:34:44] she's singled out identified and
[2:34:46] confirmed that she is the Fulfillment of
[2:34:48] the prophecy from Isaiah
[2:34:51] shall con so when the word come the word
[2:34:53] to come to identify where you fit into
[2:34:56] the
[2:35:02] prophecy come back to the Homeland to
[2:35:04] the beginning back to the Pentecostal
[2:35:07] experience like it happened at the
[2:35:09] Pentecost when the part of the Living
[2:35:10] God changed those thousand of people and
[2:35:12] set their heart of flame with the fire
[2:35:13] of God God cut off the Jews purposely
[2:35:16] and blinded their eyes so we could have
[2:35:18] a chance to see given us an opportunity
[2:35:20] and we walk around like we are somebody
[2:35:22] Paul said take heed how you do that take
[2:35:24] heed for if God spared not a natural
[2:35:26] Branch how would he have more Mercy on
[2:35:28] the wild
[2:35:31] Branch M come on please page 12 of
[2:35:37] 17
[2:35:39] what talking about the
[2:35:41] Gentiles there's a lot of time nobody
[2:35:43] knows when it will be it's a mystery
[2:35:45] remember in this great time of
[2:35:48] persecution this is the yet to come
[2:35:51] there's millions of Gentiles will die in
[2:35:55] that do you understand this prophecies
[2:35:58] here just as weighty as Hol receiving
[2:36:00] the Holy Ghost he said millions of
[2:36:03] Gentiles will die in that that rejected
[2:36:07] bride that remnant of the woman seed
[2:36:10] sleeping virgin she goes right through
[2:36:11] that Hallelujah then he talk about the
[2:36:15] magnet the holy ghost that headstone is
[2:36:17] the Holy Ghost Christ and every one of
[2:36:18] us that got the magnet ISM of the Holy
[2:36:20] Spirit when that stone strike the image
[2:36:22] the church would flee to it the Jews are
[2:36:24] in the Homeland we in the end of the age
[2:36:25] ready for the Rapture the Rapture comes
[2:36:27] the church goes up we are caught up to
[2:36:28] meet him in the air we all know that the
[2:36:30] stone that was cut out of the mountain
[2:36:32] is ready to come at any time when it
[2:36:34] come what does it do it does away with
[2:36:36] the Gentile age so we talking about
[2:36:38] Dynamics right Stone cap Stone super
[2:36:40] Church were race but do you understand
[2:36:42] when Dynamics come finish in the GLE age
[2:36:45] the same rain that Noah is waiting on to
[2:36:47] float the boat has kill the people in
[2:36:50] do you get that the the the ark need
[2:36:53] water to float the rain is coming to

[2:37:10] mountain is ready to come at any time
[2:37:12] and when it come what does it do it does
[2:37:14] away with the Gentile age it is all over
[2:37:17] and God completely quits dealing with
[2:37:19] them
[2:37:20] let him that's filthy be filthy still
[2:37:21] what is the filthy that's the sleeping
[2:37:23] virgin that comes up for judgment we
[2:37:25] over here he actually called a sleeping
[2:37:27] virgins the filthy to restore means to
[2:37:31] return to the former owner to bring back
[2:37:33] to the former state of condition we can
[2:37:36] enforce a claim to be restored oh praise
[2:37:38] to restore is to bring back to claim a
[2:37:41] claim can be enforced so therefore you
[2:37:43] this morning could actually get a claim
[2:37:46] to be
[2:37:47] restored Hallelujah to means to bring
[2:37:50] back it right to his rightful owner and
[2:37:53] to restore is to bring it back to who
[2:37:54] really owns it praise God one more thing
[2:37:56] I'll
[2:37:58] close this is fast so the Jubilee means
[2:38:02] when the individual lost the inheritance
[2:38:05] every seven years had a Sabbath and
[2:38:07] every seven days had a Sabbath and seven
[2:38:09] years and seven years there a Sabbath
[2:38:10] and every seven Sabbath was 49 years and
[2:38:13] the 5 years was a jubilee and this
[2:38:14] Jubilee every man that had lost
[2:38:16] inheritance by some means he was
[2:38:18] Freeborn true blooded Israelite no
[2:38:20] matter who held the position it had to
[2:38:22] go free and what a picture of us tonight
[2:38:24] today in the church you see a man can do
[2:38:26] and when you see what God does What man
[2:38:28] does is failing and will fail and has
[2:38:30] fail but what God does is eternal and
[2:38:32] one of these days the kingdom of this
[2:38:34] world will fall they could hold back he
[2:38:36] said but when there will come a prophecy
[2:38:39] Another Year of Jubilee we have had it
[2:38:41] about this time if you notice Pentecost
[2:38:43] is fill in America but when you begin to
[2:38:45] see the Year of Jubilee when we don't
[2:38:47] have to fuss and strain and pull like
[2:38:49] that
[2:38:49] oh praise God I'll close with this final
[2:38:52] quote and the Bible said in the last
[2:38:53] days that Satan would go about like a
[2:38:55] roaring land he is gathering together
[2:38:58] all his enemies all his friends our
[2:39:01] enemies and congregating them together
[2:39:04] heaping them for a big head mark of the
[2:39:06] beast in the Ecclesiastes friend the
[2:39:09] Holy Ghost Revelation 156 there's one in
[2:39:12] white linen waving himself up and down
[2:39:13] the waters soring by him that they
[2:39:15] forever and ever when the things happen
[2:39:17] time shall be no more time shall be no
[2:39:19] more he swore when we see these nations
[2:39:21] breaking and things the mystery of God
[2:39:23] will accomplish and I believe that the
[2:39:26] age has come now that the miraculous the
[2:39:29] phenomenal the baptism of the spirit and
[2:39:32] power and signs and wonders this great
[2:39:34] outpour of the God's spirit in the last
[2:39:36] days okay this great pouring out of
[2:39:40] God's spirit in the last days that's the
[2:39:43] thing that will bring fate into the
[2:39:46] people that will take a rapturing fate
[2:39:49] and take the church into Glory that's
[2:39:52] the faith what is it this great big O
[2:39:55] point of the spirit praise God praise
[2:39:58] God let's get back that prophecy brother
[2:40:00] SE let's put it back on as we close with
[2:40:03] this hallelujah praise God I want to
