[1:43] says amen and amen and amen and trust
[1:47] everybody is feeling fine uh good to see
[1:50] you brother Clarence uh there's a big
[1:52] reason you have to give to our thanks
[1:54] and praise and it certainly grateful to
[1:57] see everyone of you tonight on a Friday
[1:59] evening there are so many other things
[2:01] that could draw our attention and I love
[2:04] it when you know the Holy Spirit turns a
[2:07] corner
[2:08] um you know go like to do sometimes the
[2:10] unexpected you know we have things we
[2:12] expect things and and tonight I believe
[2:14] that Lord has something special for us
[2:16] in a special way
[2:18] um so I'm encouraging you to get in put
[2:21] on your seat belt for a few moments as
[2:24] you get into the wood
[2:26] um we thank God for those that are here
[2:29] and if you know someone is supposed to
[2:31] be here send them a message and tell
[2:33] them we have him
[2:34] we're having a time in the Lord on a
[2:36] Friday evening you know it's easy to get
[2:39] distracted with the cares of life and
[2:40] it's important for us to take a pause
[2:43] and come back to the basics of what God
[2:46] has called us for
[2:47] so by the grace of God I really
[2:50] appreciate
[2:51] um what has been happening uh through
[2:54] the word uh the last few weeks in
[2:56] particular has been truly a truly a
[2:57] blessing and normally an aquarity we
[3:00] would have for anything and we will have
[3:03] a crime of prayer a bit different
[3:04] tonight after we go to the scripture on
[3:07] the with the night so I have a bit of a
[3:09] title
[3:11] if I might see it
[3:13] um are you speaking a language that God
[3:16] understands
[3:18] are you speaking a language that God
[3:22] understands you know and I'm lining up
[3:24] with many of the teachings of the world
[3:26] they would have done over the last you
[3:28] know few prayer meetings where we're
[3:30] really honing in on prepping and
[3:34] thriving and dying and crying and you
[3:39] know the approach to pray and the
[3:40] approach to communication and and really
[3:43] as we delve deeper into the night we're
[3:45] recognizing it's more about
[3:48] how we say what we say and why we say
[3:51] what we see than what we actually say
[3:53] you know many people pray because it's
[3:56] just a routine is something that you're
[3:58] supposed to do and you want to be so
[4:00] cautious in approaching God because we
[4:02] want to get a result from God and the
[4:04] reality is God wants to give us a result
[4:06] you know he wants to granted his eyes of
[4:09] your heart more than you even want to
[4:10] ask for it you know and the thing is
[4:13] that desire must have the right motive
[4:15] and the right objective so
[4:17] um I know it wasn't but if you have your
[4:19] Bible we're gonna go to the book of
[4:21] First Samuel that will be where our
[4:24] study will come from tonight before we
[4:26] have a time of prayer on me like we said
[4:28] we're gonna have a time to pray in a
[4:29] different way but I want to go into the
[4:30] book of First Samuel
[4:32] and we're going to spend some time in
[4:35] full Samuel chapter one uh into first
[4:38] Samuel chapter 2 and this is a teaching
[4:42] on prayer
[4:43] um that really blessed my heart
[4:46] um and for those who have never studied
[4:48] this uh trust that will be a blessing to
[4:50] you
[4:52] um as well
[4:54] so first Samuel chapter one and you know
[4:57] how we may not have had Bible study for
[4:59] some time in this way
[5:01] um so it's the revision class so we're
[5:03] gonna take it slowly to make sure we get
[5:05] this billion point from it so everybody
[5:08] feeling fine
[5:10] everybody focused and you're not doing
[5:13] this as a side thing and you're you know
[5:15] you need to pay attention to this to get
[5:16] the best out of it all right and I know
[5:18] it's going to be a blessing to you so
[5:20] the Bible says in first time you were
[5:22] chapter one now there was a certain man
[5:25] or from a famous zohim of Mount Ephraim
[5:28] so it gives his
[5:30] history his pedigree as it was he's from
[5:32] Ephraim and his name was elkano the son
[5:36] of jeroham the son of elohu the son of
[5:40] tohu the son of Zeus and Aphrodite and
[5:44] being an appetite thought
[5:47] in from Context to be tighter Ephraim
[5:49] but if you study this appetite some
[5:52] biblical Scholars May argue that to some
[5:55] extent it me some would have been a bit
[5:57] of a derogatory too
[5:59] to some extent and we understand a bit
[6:01] why because it's almost it's speaking
[6:03] that he's going against the Green
[6:05] going against the Green of what his
[6:07] people would have been in his approach
[6:09] to God
[6:10] and the Bible goes on in verse two and
[6:12] he had two wives the name of the one was
[6:15] Hannah
[6:16] and the name of the other penina
[6:19] antenna had children
[6:22] but Hannah had no children
[6:27] the stream and this man went up out of
[6:29] his City yearly to worship and I love
[6:32] that
[6:33] he went out of the city he made the
[6:35] effort
[6:37] every single year he was consistent
[6:39] to worship and to sacrifice unto the
[6:42] Lord of hosts in Shiloh
[6:44] and this is very special because
[6:46] first Samuel is at an interesting spot
[6:49] in Scripture
[6:51] this introduces the prophet Samuel who's
[6:54] of great significance because the
[6:55] prophet Samuel is the one who we know
[6:58] will anoint
[6:59] King Saul who is the first king of
[7:01] Israel
[7:02] he will also anointing David the
[7:05] rightful true king for the king of
[7:06] Israel
[7:08] but this point as well is between the
[7:11] reign of the judges and the
[7:12] establishment of the monarchy as it were
[7:16] and it's what during the monati on the
[7:18] Solomon that the Temple of Jerusalem was
[7:20] built
[7:22] but before Istanbul of Jerusalem which
[7:24] was the center point of Israel's worship
[7:27] and where the high priests and all of
[7:30] this was done the players that existed
[7:32] before the Temple of Jerusalem was
[7:34] Shiloh you could have chosen to given
[7:37] your sacrifice in Bethel
[7:39] you could have gone to Mid spot to offer
[7:41] sacrifice it's a special effort to go to
[7:44] Shiloh so this man elkana
[7:47] wanted to bring his sacrifice in a
[7:51] certain place in a certain kind of way
[7:53] because particularly unique to Shiloh
[7:56] was this was the place the Ark of the
[7:57] Covenant would have rested
[7:59] so this was a spiritual significant
[8:01] place so the story that is being built
[8:04] here through spiritual history is the
[8:07] fact that this man elkana was a no joke
[8:09] brother he wasn't he wasn't playing
[8:11] games he had options he had places he
[8:14] could go he had different churches
[8:16] different locations but he chose to go
[8:18] to Shiloh every single year to bring his
[8:22] sacrifice and to worship he was a man
[8:24] that was consistent he was a man that
[8:26] was dedicated
[8:29] and it goes on and the two sons of Eli
[8:32] host me and Phineas the priest of the
[8:34] Lord were there
[8:36] and this has impact as well because we
[8:38] will find out later that at Shiloh where
[8:42] the Ark of the Covenant erected That was
[8:44] supposed to be the epicenter of worship
[8:46] for the children of Israel at that time
[8:48] then was in the camp because half me and
[8:51] Phineas the sons of the priests were
[8:54] tearing down were living in sin
[8:58] they were in the place where you should
[9:01] be but they were not living the kind of
[9:02] life you should live in that kind of a
[9:04] place
[9:05] are you with me so it draws an immediate
[9:08] contract that elkana is coming to Shiloh
[9:11] because he wants something out of going
[9:13] there but yet you have two sons of the
[9:15] priest who also are Shiloh but they are
[9:17] mortal for being there is very different
[9:19] from elkana being there not only so so
[9:23] again this is bringing to the floor that
[9:25] you could be in the same place you could
[9:27] be in a room with your anointing you
[9:28] could be in a piece of spiritual people
[9:29] and what your motive in your heart is is
[9:33] what determines what you get out of it
[9:35] anybody with me tonight all right
[9:39] verse 4 and when the time was that
[9:42] elkano offered
[9:44] so he gave the soccer position offering
[9:47] he gave the planet his wife and to all
[9:50] of her sons and her daughter's portions
[9:52] so this is that professional me when he
[9:56] sacrifices sacrificial meat he will give
[9:58] a portion to opinion and to all of her
[10:01] sons and her daughters but Uncle Hannah
[10:04] he gave a worthy portion he gave her
[10:07] extra the Bible actually says to be
[10:09] Amplified that he will give her a double
[10:11] portion because he loved Hannah
[10:14] and that's that's not the powerful thing
[10:16] there but the Lord had shut up her womb
[10:21] the Lord had shut up her womb
[10:24] and I mean you come back to that and
[10:28] verse 6 and her adversary and her
[10:30] adversary her rival as it were
[10:33] This Is War
[10:38] and it's not so much that Hannah is the
[10:40] aggressor
[10:41] Selena is the aggressor because she is
[10:44] seeing the love that elkana has for
[10:47] Hannah
[10:48] are you with me tonight and this study
[10:52] we are going to touches them two things
[10:53] it talks about sovereignty and we're
[10:55] gonna get into the sovereignty of God
[10:57] the grace of God the favor of God and
[11:01] how God allows things to happen to us so
[11:04] that one he can get the glory but to
[11:06] show that he could bless you despite
[11:09] stuff that he allowed to happen to you
[11:10] because it is not it is not that Hannah
[11:13] shut up her own womb
[11:15] it is not that something happened that
[11:17] caused this the Bible tells me that God
[11:19] did it
[11:20] the Lord had shut up her womb the Lord
[11:24] talk I'm having children
[11:26] and sometimes we wonder why God don't
[11:29] allow things to work out for us
[11:31] anybody with me tonight
[11:33] but behind God allowing things to not
[11:36] recall for us there's a deeper plan
[11:37] because God wants to bring something out
[11:39] of us
[11:40] this Hannah is an important person in
[11:43] the story and Narrative of scripture
[11:45] because it is the mother of Carnival
[11:47] he would be instrumental in raising
[11:49] Samuel
[11:55] would change his trajectory
[11:58] what if she encourages whether she if
[12:00] she teaches him good values
[12:03] if she admonishes him whatever
[12:05] interaction because the a mother's
[12:08] ability to shape how their children live
[12:10] is critical anybody with me tonight
[12:13] so verse 6 says and her adversary also
[12:17] provoke her soul
[12:27] to not be able to have children it's one
[12:30] thing to know that your business
[12:31] struggling it's one thing to know your
[12:34] children give in trouble it's another
[12:36] thing in the face of you dealing with
[12:38] your own issues there's somebody else
[12:39] who is now making a mockery of your
[12:42] opinion of your struggle of your
[12:44] challenge
[12:45] so if one thing's behind it to deal with
[12:48] her barrenness it's it's adding shorts
[12:51] that you wouldn't if I could say that
[12:52] when in the midst of your barrenness
[12:54] somebody is provoking you about it
[12:56] pointing you about it trusting you about
[12:59] it adding fear to these fire as it were
[13:02] to make it worse
[13:04] all of us have stressed in our lives you
[13:06] know
[13:08] that that's the reality of it it's
[13:10] something else when in the middle of
[13:11] your stress something comes at you like
[13:13] you say well I don't really need that
[13:14] much stress right now you know because
[13:16] I'm dealing with enough stress as it is
[13:18] I dealing with enough struggle and
[13:20] dealing with enough pain I dealing with
[13:21] enough issues as it is and that is how
[13:23] Karma would have been he is dealing with
[13:26] the seeming reproach as it were of going
[13:29] to the temple every year to give
[13:31] sacrifice and you're walking with your
[13:34] husband as it were and you're walking
[13:36] and you're watching his other wife with
[13:37] only children and you're watching it and
[13:39] it would have an impact on you because
[13:41] you wish you could have that too but on
[13:44] top of that
[13:45] her adversary made it a business
[13:48] because
[13:58] unfortunately gets to a point where
[14:00] there's a response where are you
[14:02] freaking
[14:03] anybody with me tonight
[14:06] because this is like putting pressure on
[14:08] proper pressure
[14:09] from scripture that the Nina was already
[14:12] started to try until she no kind of
[14:14] spirit
[14:17] and I don't know what you want to make
[14:18] you ever felt like your spirit broken
[14:19] you're trying to do something and then
[14:21] everything and then on top of it
[14:22] somebody else does the the something
[14:23] that just throws over the air does it
[14:25] work
[14:26] whatever Joy you had and I want you to
[14:28] understand the context this is not
[14:30] happening in the room this is not
[14:32] happening in Easton this is she is
[14:35] waiting until they get to church
[14:37] she's waiting until there's a place
[14:39] where you can get strength and
[14:41] Redemption and relief and you can pull
[14:43] your heart out of the Altar and it's in
[14:45] that place at that time she chooses to
[14:48] come and drive you screw them to stress
[14:51] her out because walk her soul to make
[14:54] her fresh
[15:10] and they're coming at you
[15:13] but making people work
[15:16] worse than you were feeling before
[15:18] anybody with me tonight I don't know if
[15:20] this is this is a context maybe you
[15:22] haven't gone through some stuff
[15:24] where you went through something and
[15:26] then somebody actually make it worse for
[15:27] you in a place on a time when you
[15:30] expected to get released
[15:32] there's only so much Chef people can
[15:34] take so also want us to go on
[15:37] verse seven and as he did so year by
[15:41] year
[15:47] so it wasn't one experience of
[15:50] publication it wasn't one encounter she
[15:53] had with the situation it is as if every
[15:55] time she goes to church to get a
[15:57] blessing something happened to take the
[15:58] blessing away
[16:01] anybody with me as if she's trying to
[16:03] get a breakthrough and something always
[16:05] there him knowing the Breakthrough
[16:07] anybody with me tonight
[16:09] so I want to get a bit a bit deeper here
[16:11] though I'm not going to be too wrong
[16:13] with you this is just to kind of
[16:14] encourager because the reality of it was
[16:17] this constant stress on Hannah
[16:20] affected Hannah's life
[16:22] it affected her walk it affected how old
[16:26] look it affected and I want to get to
[16:28] this the even the way she prayed
[16:31] anybody with me tonight
[16:33] verse seven and as he did so year by
[16:36] year when she went up to the house of
[16:39] the Lord
[16:40] saw people welcome therefore she wept
[16:46] and did not eat
[16:48] now this is not trying to be telling the
[16:50] fact
[16:51] this is the pain and the stress of
[16:54] whatever word attitude action look
[16:59] whispered Behavior
[17:01] it is easy it is easy for us to say
[17:04] don't study what people saying about you
[17:05] know friends that's very easy to tell
[17:08] someone you know but if you know
[17:09] somebody talking about you if you know
[17:12] somebody running you down and you in
[17:13] that experience it's a whole different
[17:14] experience
[17:16] there are many things you shake off
[17:17] there are many things that come to us
[17:19] and we don't allow it to bother us
[17:21] however the Nina was inspired was so
[17:25] destructive to Hannah's life that she
[17:28] cried in the Bible said she what and she
[17:31] stopped eating in other words she'll not
[17:33] appetite I have had experiences where
[17:36] news came to me and stood in front of me
[17:38] and according to anybody leave the
[17:39] appetite
[17:41] Shiloh
[17:53] the city sacrifice the sacrificial me
[17:56] being shared and I dealt that point was
[17:58] in front of you you're about to eat
[17:59] somebody said something to you on a trip
[18:01] off your appetite you're crying and you
[18:03] can't eat anymore anybody with me
[18:06] that's a real rough existence
[18:08] in fact I can imagine that Hannah would
[18:11] have had a struggle after a while to
[18:13] even go up to silo
[18:15] because this continuing activity of
[18:19] being oppressed
[18:21] would have had a longer till effect on
[18:24] her anybody with me
[18:27] they should be voted therefore she
[18:29] worked and did
[18:31] not eat
[18:32] then said Air Canada
[18:35] why because now
[18:38] now this why we have to go is not a
[18:41] question of the subject
[18:45] it is not the question of why you're
[18:47] crying you know
[18:49] I wanted to appreciate this there is no
[18:51] way that Hannah would have withheld the
[18:54] reason she was crying from her husband
[18:57] the question why we both go
[19:00] is more of why you're crying about this
[19:06] versus why you're crying
[19:09] anybody with me in other words this
[19:11] doesn't want to cry
[19:12] this stuff you're crying about with it
[19:14] but the reality is I want to appreciate
[19:17] the emotions that honor is in the
[19:20] reality that we can too many people cry
[19:22] on and off until somebody will stop
[19:24] crying when they're going through their
[19:25] pain or their or their or their two of
[19:27] them or their heart ache anybody with me
[19:30] somebody who's Eng
[19:33] for you but they still have to resolve
[19:35] their grief because it's something that
[19:37] affecting their heart
[19:38] anybody with me tonight
[19:40] he says why with us now and why it is
[19:43] down
[19:44] in other words don't let it affect you
[19:46] so much that you're not even going to
[19:48] eat especially given in fact that every
[19:50] time I take all this food I've given you
[19:52] a double portion
[19:54] every time we take away food do you
[19:56] think about extra food for her because
[19:58] you love her so yeah
[20:01] because he keeping me the the waiting
[20:05] version
[20:06] for her eaten
[20:23] because she is using her appetite by
[20:25] virtue or it wasn't physical abuse
[20:31] and I wasn't being physically beaten but
[20:33] words are powerful
[20:36] Looks Could Be powerful
[20:38] suggestions could be powerful gospel
[20:41] could be powerful anybody with me
[20:43] tonight
[20:45] and yes
[20:49] she'll even go up to the temple to eat
[20:52] they went to this company to make
[20:54] sacrifice
[20:56] worship
[20:58] when you go to the when you go to Sally
[20:59] you're going to kill
[21:02] anybody with me
[21:04] so let's go in verse 8 then her husband
[21:10] why we push down and why he press down
[21:13] not and why is thy heart green
[21:17] the only word he's saying rise up above
[21:20] this stuff
[21:21] and I want to encourage us tonight this
[21:23] is
[21:27] out of a situation
[21:31] not like that
[21:34] because the people who you can still
[21:36] have the most in a situation because
[21:37] these words and and ask for the husband
[21:40] said why are you ever eaten why your
[21:42] heart grieved he threw enough people to
[21:45] talk you say I'm not I better today than
[21:48] temperament showing that he knows you
[21:51] know but he's saying that oh God you
[21:53] have me
[21:56] forget that woman you have me
[21:59] and I am what
[22:16] for you
[22:22] anybody with me tonight
[22:25] so the hospital is doing everything he
[22:26] could do to try to help his wife through
[22:30] the struggle that the reality is it's an
[22:33] individual of fear
[22:35] it's an individual struggle and while
[22:38] the world would have had the level of
[22:40] encouragement to her the reality is I
[22:42] want to understand you see it in the
[22:45] conversation later that during every
[22:47] visit to Shiloh I know would have had to
[22:50] pray
[22:50] because you're going up there to pray
[22:52] you're going up there sacrifice
[22:56] so here we go now verse nine anybody
[22:58] with me tonight
[23:00] so this is speaking now upon encounter
[23:02] in verse nine we don't know how many
[23:04] years
[23:06] with Hannah having to deal with this
[23:08] stress this is what I would call
[23:10] unnecessary stress this stress that have
[23:12] nothing to do with anything of real
[23:14] significance to her that she has to do
[23:15] with it so Hannah rose up after they
[23:18] have eaten in Shiloh
[23:20] and after they are drunk
[23:22] now Eli The Creep and that's why I'm
[23:26] getting the context are you speaking a
[23:28] language that God
[23:31] understands or God doesn't understand
[23:35] because you see it I'm not prayed every
[23:38] time
[23:41] the decrease he was praying was not the
[23:44] kind of prayer going on with it here
[23:47] oh anybody with me
[23:50] okay so the Constitution woman it was
[23:54] just the way she was praying
[23:58] because of why she was praying and how
[24:01] she was praying
[24:03] foreign
[24:09] and after they are drunk now Eli the
[24:12] priest
[24:13] sat upon a seat by a post of the Temple
[24:15] of the Lord
[24:17] and verse 10. so it's painting a picture
[24:19] Hannah is praying
[24:27] they said and she was in bitterness of
[24:30] soul and praise unto the Lord and wept
[24:33] so
[24:34] but this time this encounter was
[24:37] different
[24:42] and said oh lord of hosts
[24:45] if there was indeed look on the
[24:48] Affliction of thine handmaid
[24:51] and remember me
[24:53] and not forget that her need
[24:56] but will give unto thy hand made a
[24:59] man-child then I will give him unto the
[25:03] Lord all the days of his life
[25:05] and they saw no River come upon his head
[25:11] so somehow in this particular year year
[25:14] after year she was coming but this
[25:16] particular year she said something
[25:18] different and the Bible said she made us
[25:21] go she she wrote a vote she said
[25:23] something different this year than she
[25:25] had ever said every year before
[25:27] and it came to pass verse 12 as she
[25:30] continued praying before the Lord that
[25:33] Eli marked him out
[25:36] so Eli was watching her because
[25:38] even as the priest I'm sure he knows who
[25:40] comes consistently I'm sure you know and
[25:43] he's watching how he's Machina he's
[25:44] watching her mouth
[25:46] no this is where it gets interesting
[25:48] verse 30 now Hannah she's fake in her
[25:51] heart so this world it wasn't even worse
[25:54] that feel I could have heard
[26:03] therefore Eli thought she had been
[26:06] drunken
[26:07] verse 14 and Eli said unto her how long
[26:10] will thou be drunken put away thy wine
[26:14] from thee
[26:16] and Hannah answer them said no my Lord I
[26:20] am a woman of sorrowful spirit
[26:29] I'm a woman with a despairing spirit
[26:35] I have drugs neither why not strong
[26:37] drink that I've poured out my soul
[26:40] before the Lord
[26:46] called not thine handmade for a daughter
[26:49] of Belial
[26:53] so in other words this daughter of the
[26:56] reality and do not regard your meat
[26:58] server that's a wicked or worthless
[27:00] woman
[27:02] so out of abundance of my complaint and
[27:06] grief have I spoken either to friends
[27:09] that line right there is the key to this
[27:12] whole thing in other words
[27:14] in the other characters for I have
[27:16] spoken until now out of my great concern
[27:20] and better provocation
[27:23] you kept what do you think that Eli
[27:27] do you think that Eli all the prayers
[27:30] I've been praying all these years was
[27:32] because of bitterness
[27:34] and provocation
[27:36] in other words
[27:38] because what I just went through here
[27:41] was different than every time I pray
[27:42] before
[27:44] because I've prayed in my heart it
[27:46] wasn't a real world thing anymore it
[27:49] wasn't me trying to extract anymore
[27:59] last Sunday when I preach I talk about
[28:01] dropping your horse and in your heart
[28:03] you already don't want to see somebody
[28:04] blessed
[28:08] this is somebody who is praying this
[28:10] form of prayer but the prayer was a
[28:13] better friend
[28:15] the prayer had a wrong motive had a
[28:18] wrong desire
[28:19] because she's staying here was out of
[28:22] great control and better provocation
[28:26] now when you under business and you
[28:28] understand
[28:31] or upset or whatever in other words
[28:33] Karma was coming she lost her appetite
[28:36] she upset she climbed and she prayed and
[28:39] God said another prayer
[28:42] because you're approaching me out of
[28:44] bitterness
[28:46] provocation your approach me out of
[28:49] anger you're Fortune because you
[28:51] obsessed about the situation you're not
[28:52] any right Spirit about the matter and
[28:55] the reason your wonders child is to get
[28:58] back at this woman
[29:00] it is because she is provoking you
[29:02] you're praying to myself to win or you
[29:04] don't hear me tonight
[29:07] so she reach a point where she can come
[29:09] sensory please
[29:18] but before this moment I've been
[29:21] training business
[29:23] but something changed in that moment in
[29:26] prayer had a change
[29:29] or I I don't know if you get to miss
[29:31] them
[29:33] are you speaking a language that God
[29:36] could understand he was not just the
[29:38] activity of prayer because she has been
[29:40] praying for a child she need a child she
[29:44] wanted a child because a child would
[29:46] have put an end to her suffering
[29:48] is she could produce a child the
[29:51] criticism trampoline would have stopped
[29:54] immediately but God had her born year
[29:57] after year after year until she changed
[30:00] the way she prayed about the marker
[30:04] God could have answered the prayer any
[30:06] place here we could have answered the
[30:08] Plenty second year he could have
[30:09] answered yes but the way she prayed
[30:12] about the matter was not right it was as
[30:14] a response to what the Nina was saying
[30:16] all the time
[30:18] I'm going to want to to play out of
[30:21] dungeon brother wanted to play out of
[30:23] anger but I don't want you to play out
[30:25] of frustration what I want you to pray
[30:27] outcome and material and democracy or as
[30:29] a response to what other people do for
[30:32] you against you about you the pain has
[30:35] to be the right motive behind me prayer
[30:37] that the only language that God could
[30:40] understand
[30:44] anybody with me tonight
[30:51] I will do it again
[30:53] when Eli challenged
[30:55] because Eli are collect something
[30:57] different about her for him to intervene
[30:59] he's telling a report I would hate to
[31:02] believe I wouldn't want to believe the
[31:04] only person playing people are coming to
[31:06] these temples who sacrifice he is
[31:10] something about this woman catches his
[31:12] attention
[31:15] to her because he still lives moving on
[31:19] resonated
[31:38] and I said no my Lord I'm a woman of
[31:41] Sparkle spirit I'm drunk you know why
[31:43] not strong bring but I poured out my
[31:46] soul before the Lord
[31:49] for the Lord in that particular moment
[31:53] all she reached a point where the words
[31:57] of a prayer chained to say Lord if
[31:59] you're given the sun in other words put
[32:02] context it was not about Selena anymore
[32:11] days of his life
[32:19] I wonder somebody else different because
[32:22] I want to have a sound of the three of
[32:25] you oh Lord help us tonight
[32:31] have you been praying wrong
[32:34] Lord bless my business because
[32:37] I mean and the rest of that the real
[32:39] reason because despite the words you say
[32:41] God knows behind me or whatever
[32:46] I did a study some time ago I didn't
[32:48] even recall it when we talked about
[32:50] motives of the heart
[32:52] and the Bible says and I say people
[32:54] always miss interpreting scriptures he
[32:57] asked and receive not because you have a
[33:00] myth
[33:01] that you may consume it upon your Allah
[33:04] and then he amplify that to James 4 3
[33:06] you ask God for something and do not
[33:09] receive it because you asked with wrong
[33:11] motives out of selfishness or with an
[33:14] unrighteous agenda
[33:18] that's the scripture so born so Jesus
[33:21] touching on the issue that Hannah had to
[33:23] deal with because for 100 words of the
[33:26] prophet Samuel shall be a certain kind
[33:28] of mother
[33:30] foreign
[33:49] let's go
[33:53] then Eli answered and said
[33:58] one second
[34:08] then Eli answer and said go in peace
[34:13] and the god of Israel grant me by
[34:15] petition that thou hath asked of him
[34:18] and she said let that handmade find
[34:20] Grace and thy sight
[34:22] so the woman went away and they eat and
[34:25] her continent
[34:26] was no more sad
[34:31] so that encountered in prayer chainsaw
[34:34] from a woman who had
[34:36] an ask about her
[34:38] she couldn't eat all that have happened
[34:40] but now she had that breakthrough in
[34:42] prayer where she aligned a prayer for
[34:46] something that God can recognize God
[34:48] could understand a language God could
[34:50] say I like that and God got your favor
[34:53] Eli to give her a word of comfort a word
[34:56] of Solace a word of peace I said go in
[34:59] peace the god of Israel Grande by
[35:02] petition
[35:04] Hallelujah
[35:05] and they woke up in the morning early
[35:07] and worship before the Lord had retained
[35:09] and came to the house and Rama and
[35:12] elkana knew Hannah his wife and the Lord
[35:14] remembered her oh my God
[35:17] oh the Lord will remember us tonight if
[35:20] the Lord remember you he knows what you
[35:22] need to know he knows what to make you
[35:24] happy you know
[35:28] but if there's a wrong native along the
[35:30] desire around a German day God kind of
[35:33] bless it
[35:35] and more time it is your motive it is
[35:37] your intention it is your desire that's
[35:40] who only might be blessing a good one to
[35:41] give you all alone
[35:50] with Bridge be judges for the king oh my
[35:54] this is not just a Prophet this will be
[35:56] bridge between all the judges and the
[35:58] kings of a god of her were set by this
[35:59] prophet Samuel and it happened with the
[36:01] right kind of woman to raise this kind
[36:04] of come
[36:08] set up
[36:11] until she was provoked so much until the
[36:14] provocation drove us to go deeper to
[36:16] figure greater purpose than her
[36:18] frustration than her convocation than
[36:21] her grief oh you don't hear me tonight
[36:25] when anyway he was praying hasn't been
[36:27] working you need to check what you're
[36:28] praying for
[36:31] if you know there's any answers to the
[36:33] prayers that you've been praying you
[36:34] need to check what you're asking for
[36:36] because God could only bless you when
[36:39] you ask the right way
[36:44] there is a language that God understands
[36:47] he has so many Prophet was relating his
[36:49] experience with his killers and sister
[36:51] happy was right there as you heard it
[36:53] she said the right thing that language
[36:54] God understood
[36:56] he trust your property thank you for
[36:58] whatever you want she said the right
[36:59] thing I understand that language that
[37:01] language does open a blessing that
[37:03] language is open up favor anybody with
[37:04] me tonight
[37:05] the Centurion come to Jesus and say Mr
[37:09] want is sick
[37:20] you don't need to come
[37:24] just speak the word and the birth of
[37:27] Jesus marveled at the Centurion people
[37:30] the language different school that along
[37:32] with the faith triggers something and
[37:34] have money take home and I said what
[37:37] time is it here
[37:38] are you speaking a language
[37:41] that God understands
[37:45] you look through it when you read
[37:46] through scripture there are many
[37:48] examples because God speaks about the
[37:50] Centurion Street even the thief and the
[37:53] cross
[37:56] one thing dividing Jesus saying this
[37:59] about the other one just say remember me
[38:00] it wasn't a complex prayer
[38:03] but it was his sincerity it was the
[38:05] humility it was a language that
[38:08] resonates with God
[38:11] I heard somebody say recently I was
[38:12] showing everybody a few days ago
[38:14] God gets a lot of prayer requests
[38:18] millions and millions of people telling
[38:20] a prayer request
[38:22] and he asked yourself what makes your
[38:23] standout
[38:25] I love that question
[38:28] everybody
[38:37] is
[38:40] continuing and her continual
[38:48] request request request requests
[38:54] tonight
[39:02] that's Jesus only teaching you know
[39:03] Jesus
[39:06] results
[39:11] in the concept of your language that God
[39:14] understands is the frequency of Prayer
[39:17] because of what the system is
[39:18] persistence is about frequency
[39:20] continuous it's Earnest it gets freezing
[39:23] across the attracting God there's
[39:25] thankfulness in your prayer there's
[39:27] obedience in your prayer there's
[39:28] reverence in your prayers there's
[39:30] Contrition in your prayer there's
[39:32] submission in your prayers all of this
[39:34] forms are language and the language is
[39:36] not just about the words you're using
[39:38] because Hannah was at the point where
[39:40] she wasn't when he was at work she was
[39:41] in her heart and God understood that the
[39:44] language of the heart
[39:46] anybody with me tonight
[39:49] is this helping anybody
[39:52] to check your prayer life and how you're
[39:54] playing so it's not just
[39:56] what are you praying for and how are you
[39:58] praying for it let's go let's finish all
[40:01] this tonight
[40:06] verse 19.
[40:09] and the words of early in the morning in
[40:11] the morning
[40:12] and came to the house in Rama and elkana
[40:15] knew Hannah his wife and the Lord
[40:17] remembered her
[40:20] remembered would remember us tonight
[40:23] and I was thinking you know we're
[40:24] talking about continues in the New
[40:25] Testament there was the memorial
[40:29] in heaven because they come in your
[40:31] crime
[40:34] come back to that question about there
[40:36] are so many prayer requests
[40:38] is there any Corner if they were not a
[40:40] paper about you
[40:42] had a memorial
[40:45] well you don't hear me tonight
[40:51] Memorial
[40:55] cemetery and I see somebody
[40:58] I will cross somebody else have
[41:00] something bigger because I'm bigger this
[41:03] was gonna be a real great man there
[41:04] because there's a Memorial Day
[41:11] to speak about him even after he's gone
[41:14] that's a memorial
[41:17] celebrated the sacrifice of somebody's
[41:19] life
[41:22] foreign
[41:30] where's my where's my Memorial
[41:33] is
[41:35] you know
[41:39] you need to see us building up a
[41:41] memorial it is a sacrifice is a
[41:43] commitment it's a dedication it's the
[41:45] number of pieces coming together to
[41:47] create something real that speaks about
[41:49] you
[41:50] that you're preparing by all of your
[41:53] prayers I could remember the time
[41:55] Messiah remember the time you cry
[41:57] because depression is that frustration
[42:00] you'll go through that but there's a
[42:02] memorial because you put it through
[42:15] all the negativity
[42:20] I'm feeling less than I'm feeling
[42:22] inferior my feelings traveled and
[42:24] struggled and affected and depressed I'm
[42:27] going to depression and she had to
[42:29] overlook that and separate herself with
[42:32] the shorter for depression this woman if
[42:35] she wouldn't shut her mouth if she
[42:37] didn't stop talking about
[42:39] the amount of thoughts you have to
[42:43] overcome to reach a point to say I want
[42:45] a son now
[42:50] anybody with me
[42:52] but the government
[42:55] to say Lord I want something you know
[42:58] but you know what whenever back to you
[43:03] because there's nothing about me anymore
[43:04] I realized it was what I wanted but I
[43:07] really wasn't care about what you wanted
[43:12] even Jesus had to pray he says if it is
[43:16] possible then just go past that was his
[43:19] career though oh you don't hear me
[43:21] tonight
[43:22] the instinctive prayer Jesus had was if
[43:26] it were possible we are discard personal
[43:29] meaning if I can apply and keep a long
[43:31] time because
[43:37] it was impressed if it is possible let
[43:41] me get a new car
[43:43] but no one left nothing I will if you
[43:46] don't know
[43:47] or you don't hear me tonight
[43:52] can I say that one more time
[43:55] if it is possible no longer a new house
[43:58] nevertheless
[44:00] everything going to wear your new house
[44:02] but are you praying with a language that
[44:05] God will understand that put his will
[44:09] into the equation not only that you know
[44:12] when you go back to this vowel when you
[44:13] go to this ball
[44:16] I heard somebody say it doesn't Hannah
[44:18] make Gora shareholder in the style
[44:21] called camera
[44:23] in other words
[44:25] but you have ownership I've given your
[44:27] ownership I've given you I've given it
[44:29] back to you yeah everything is strong my
[44:32] life is not my own
[44:36] anybody Wiggly
[44:37] I hope this is an interruption to our
[44:40] Friday routine
[44:42] to of course life and prayer and always
[44:44] and our choices and our differences
[44:46] differently
[44:52] I guess every time I read that thing
[44:55] again
[45:09] let's go on
[45:12] therefore it came to pass when the time
[45:14] was come after that Hannah had to see
[45:16] that she bear son and call his name
[45:18] Samuel
[45:21] Hallelujah
[45:32] saying because I have asked him
[45:36] of the Lord
[45:38] and the man elkana
[45:40] and all his household went up to offer
[45:43] unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice and
[45:45] his vow
[45:48] that Hannah was not up so she said unto
[45:50] us but I will not go up until the child
[45:52] be wind and then I shall bring him that
[45:55] he may appear before the Lord
[45:59] and they abide forever
[46:05] senator
[46:07] do what she must be good carry until
[46:09] they have win him only the Lord
[46:12] established his word
[46:16] so they open about and give us some
[46:18] until she win him and when she had
[46:20] William she took him with her with three
[46:23] blocks and one ether a flower and a
[46:25] bottle of wine and brought him into the
[46:28] house of the Lord in Shiloh and the
[46:30] child was young
[46:32] and they saw a Bullock and brought the
[46:36] child to Eli and he said oh my Lord
[46:39] as thy Soul living
[46:41] my Lord I am the woman that stood by me
[46:44] here praying unto the Lord
[46:46] for this child I prayed
[46:49] and the Lord had given me my petition
[46:51] which I asked of him therefore also I
[46:55] have lent him to the Lord as long as he
[46:58] liveth he shall be lent to the Lord and
[47:01] He Worship the Lord there
[47:05] What a Mighty context without them just
[47:08] a few more verses in chapter two
[47:13] and I like that
[47:15] chapter 2 verse 1 starts and Hannah
[47:18] prayed so there's no questions
[47:25] so what I love about this as well this
[47:27] is not I guess what I want from God to
[47:29] our suffering
[47:33] and Hannah prayed
[47:35] and said and and this is our
[47:37] contribution prayer before we go into
[47:39] prayer we're still going to do things a
[47:40] little different I haven't played and
[47:42] said my heart rejoiced it in the Lord
[47:46] my wall is exalted in the Lord
[47:49] and that's why for this study just tell
[47:51] your prayer and the sovereignty of God
[47:52] and Hannah is actually almost speaking
[47:55] about the sovereignty of God in this
[47:56] prayer right my heart rejoices in the
[47:58] Lord
[47:59] my horn my horn in every part is like my
[48:02] strength is lifted up in the Lord
[48:05] so my heart Rejoice that your heart
[48:07] rejoice in the Lord tonight
[48:08] is he the thought of your strength my
[48:11] strength is lifted up in the Lord
[48:13] outside of the Lord there's nothing to
[48:15] lift me up
[48:17] that's what when people say they're
[48:19] struggling have you gone to the Lord
[48:21] because all the words I can say to you
[48:23] tonight is nothing compared to when your
[48:26] strength or your own is exalted in the
[48:29] Lord
[48:30] she goes and my mouth is enlarged over
[48:32] my name
[48:34] because I rejoice in thy salvation
[48:38] there is none actually as the Lord for
[48:41] there is none beside me neither is there
[48:44] any Rock like I work on
[48:46] talk no more so exceeding proudly less
[48:50] than elegancy come out of your mouth
[48:56] for the Lord is a god of knowledge and
[48:59] by him actions are weighed
[49:02] this is a woman who is praying who has
[49:04] been true from God
[49:07] the bones of the mighty men are broken
[49:11] and there that color are greeted with
[49:14] strength he's saying this strong the
[49:17] board of Enlightenment they are broken
[49:18] but they are stumbled you could talk
[49:20] about herself
[49:27] have hired out themselves for bread
[49:36] in other words God is shaking things up
[49:39] all that were down for them God let them
[49:42] up you know that was higher established
[49:44] go and bring them down we saw plenty of
[49:47] God see the customers I was a barren
[49:49] woman
[49:50] there was no hope for me yes
[49:53] but look at me now
[49:56] it wasn't out of the boss because he
[49:58] said it earlier that's not our country
[50:00] much about what the Monster exceeding
[50:03] crowd he is talking about the humility
[50:05] through the pain of the experience and
[50:08] the resolution of her issues was in
[50:10] prayer
[50:11] it wasn't counseling it wasn't therapy
[50:13] it wasn't imposter it wasn't a message
[50:15] it was in prayer she wrestled and she
[50:19] broke too she played true or something
[50:25] can you still hear me yeah
[50:31] can you hear me fine
[50:35] struggled and prayed through
[50:40] and still have many children with black
[50:42] people
[50:44] the Lord kill it and make it alive
[50:47] so she's drawing that contract of the
[50:50] sovereignty of God
[50:52] he bring it down to the Grave
[50:55] and bring it up in other words he take
[50:57] people down to the grave and he can
[50:59] resurrect you too
[51:01] he's so friendly of God
[51:03] the Lord make it poor and make it rich
[51:06] you think it's you making a sandwich
[51:10] anybody with me tonight
[51:12] what I do in this am I working hard
[51:13] Hannah is preaching a message to
[51:16] everybody yesterday
[51:22] get your order right and put it alone
[51:24] first because he's sovereignty of God
[51:26] will ultimately determine your destiny
[51:28] or you don't hear me tonight
[51:31] he bring it low and lift it up foreign
[51:55] to set them among printers who could do
[51:59] that only God to do it
[52:01] and to make them inherit the truth of
[52:04] Glory for The Pillars of the Earth are
[52:06] the Lord
[52:07] and he accept the world upon them if God
[52:10] could tell the world upon it you don't
[52:12] think he can set you up you think he
[52:14] could take care of you you need to pay a
[52:15] bill you need to heal you deliver you
[52:17] restore you baptize you adopt you
[52:20] perfect you change you change your home
[52:22] change your children change your life
[52:24] change the situation
[52:30] verse 9. let this be your comfort
[52:33] tonight he will keep the feet of his
[52:36] sins
[52:38] this is the prayer of Hannah
[52:41] he will keep the feet of the thing
[52:44] and the wicked shall be silent in
[52:47] darkness
[52:48] for by strength shall no man prevailed
[52:52] they say not by might nor my power
[52:55] for my strengths and no man preview it
[52:57] takes God the grace of God that's why we
[53:00] cannot underestimate the importance of
[53:03] meetings like this
[53:07] the adversaries of the Lord shall be
[53:09] broken to pieces Out of Heaven shall he
[53:12] summon upon them the Lord shall judge
[53:14] the end of the Earth and he shall give
[53:16] strength unto his King and exhort the
[53:19] whole of the strength of his anointed
[53:23] to his house and the child the minister
