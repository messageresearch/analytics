[59:49] Let's just bow our heads
[59:52] for a word of prayer.
[59:54] Our gracious heavenly father, we thank
[59:56] you this morning that we could be
[59:57] gathered one more time in your sacred
[1:00:00] house of prayer and praise, reproof
[1:00:02] [music] and correction, of admonition
[1:00:05] and training and teaching and healing.
[1:00:08] House of refuge, a house of peace, a
[1:00:10] house of safety, a house of God's bread,
[1:00:13] a house of comfort, Lord, a house where
[1:00:15] we could come and we could leave, Lord,
[1:00:18] different than the way we came. Your
[1:00:19] prophet taught us whenever we come into
[1:00:21] your presence, [music] we either leave
[1:00:24] better or we leave worse, but we never
[1:00:26] leave the same way that we came.
[1:00:28] Heavenly Father, may we leave this
[1:00:29] house, Lord, not just change, but change
[1:00:32] for the better. change in the inner man.
[1:00:35] Not just change in our feelings or our
[1:00:37] emotions or Lord just to feel good about
[1:00:40] ourselves but something on the inside
[1:00:42] that Lord a new creation has been
[1:00:44] activated. The seed in us has been
[1:00:47] quickened to life by the word of God
[1:00:49] that comes in contact with the spirit of
[1:00:52] God. Father we thank you for the grace
[1:00:54] and the mercy that you have Lord placed
[1:00:56] upon us. And we thank you in advance for
[1:00:59] the healing that's about to take [music]
[1:01:00] place. Uh breakthrough that's about to
[1:01:03] take place. Uh deliverance that's about
[1:01:05] to [music] take place. Uh captives that
[1:01:07] are about to go free because that's what
[1:01:09] you came to do to set the captives free.
[1:01:12] To Lord to put that liberty them that
[1:01:14] are bound to loose the bands of
[1:01:16] wickedness and [music] break the
[1:01:18] shackles that have held the people back,
[1:01:20] Father. Lord, and as we come to the end
[1:01:22] of another year and prepare for a new
[1:01:24] year, Father, Lord, where your word
[1:01:26] teaches us to forgetting the things that
[1:01:28] are passed and to look to the things
[1:01:30] that up ahead, Father, we come to your
[1:01:32] house, Lord. Lord, for this final
[1:01:35] service of 2025, of last Sunday, as it
[1:01:38] were, of the year, Father, we give you
[1:01:39] glory. We give you honor to your holy
[1:01:41] name in the precious, marvelous,
[1:01:43] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:01:45] And the church says,
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; and the church says,
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; amen and amen. And you may be seated for
[1:01:51] a few minutes [music] in the presence of
[1:01:53] the Lord. And certainly want to greet
[1:01:54] you, greet one and all in the precious
[1:01:57] name of Jesus Christ. And it's certainly
[1:01:59] a great privilege to be in the land of
[1:02:02] the living.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; It's not something to take for granted.
[1:02:06] It's not something that you could take
[1:02:07] casually because there are many people
[1:02:09] did not make it to this point. They
[1:02:11] didn't make it to this day. They didn't
[1:02:13] make it to this month. They didn't make
[1:02:14] it to this year. But God through his
[1:02:16] grace and mercy has seen it fit that we
[1:02:18] would be counted worthy to be present to
[1:02:21] see what we see and to hear what we hear
[1:02:23] and to be a part of what God is doing in
[1:02:25] this season and this hour. So we want to
[1:02:27] just give the Lord a hand of praise and
[1:02:28] thanksgiving that he who has started the
[1:02:31] work in us is more than able to bring it
[1:02:34] to pass to bring it to completion. He
[1:02:36] said I know the plans I have for you the
[1:02:38] thoughts I have for you to bring you to
[1:02:40] an expected end with an end that is
[1:02:42] expected. He knows the expectation of
[1:02:44] the end before you were even born. He
[1:02:45] had an expected end in mind of how you
[1:02:48] should look when you leave here. How you
[1:02:49] should look when you come to the house
[1:02:50] of God. How you should look when the
[1:02:52] Holy Spirit comes upon your life. So I
[1:02:55] want to greet one and all and salute one
[1:02:58] and all by the grace of God. It feels
[1:03:00] good in the house of God. It feels like
[1:03:02] you're here because you know who you
[1:03:04] are. You know where you come from. You
[1:03:06] know where you're going. You know what
[1:03:08] God expects of you. and your expectation
[1:03:10] should be rising by the grace of God. So
[1:03:12] I greet one and all those that are here.
[1:03:14] I know there are few people who are not
[1:03:16] well and they're downstairs. And I went
[1:03:18] to brother Hugh. I said, "Brother Hugh,
[1:03:19] why are there so many people
[1:03:20] downstairs?" He says, "Some people are
[1:03:22] not well." So as I left hearing those
[1:03:24] words, I say maybe as the word goes
[1:03:26] forward this morning, the people
[1:03:27] downstairs will be quickened to come
[1:03:29] upstairs because a healing power that's
[1:03:31] not limited to time and space and
[1:03:33] limited by four walls can reach
[1:03:35] downstairs and quicken and heal and
[1:03:37] transform and deliver regularize blood
[1:03:40] pressure. Come on. Destroy the virus and
[1:03:43] the flu and female condition, male
[1:03:45] condition, whatever condition it is.
[1:03:47] Destroy cancer. Destroy arthritis.
[1:03:50] Destroy leukemia. destroy every demon
[1:03:52] because every spirit, every principality
[1:03:55] has a name. And if we could identify
[1:03:57] what it is, we could call it out and
[1:03:58] deal with it. Can the church say amen?
[1:04:01] Even to reach users of the internet, to
[1:04:02] those that are connected online, may the
[1:04:05] quickening power of God touch you where
[1:04:07] you are. May your house, your home, your
[1:04:09] office, your desk, where you be, may the
[1:04:11] pillar of fire drop down because the
[1:04:13] spirit is promised to follow the word of
[1:04:15] the living God. Can the church say amen?
[1:04:18] So, by the grace of God, on behalf of
[1:04:20] the pastor, I'd like to thank the church
[1:04:22] for their commitment to this year 2025,
[1:04:25] for the grace of God, and for your
[1:04:26] faithfulness to the message of the hour.
[1:04:29] We don't preach our own message. We
[1:04:30] preach another man's message. Can the
[1:04:32] church say, "Amen." So, we salute you,
[1:04:34] the church, those that have made that
[1:04:36] choice to make this your home church.
[1:04:38] You know, the prophet said, "You ought
[1:04:40] to have a home church, a place you call
[1:04:42] your home, a place where you identify.
[1:04:43] There are many people who profess this
[1:04:45] message and have no home church. True.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; You know, we're going into a new season.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; So, we're not holding back on anything
[1:04:54] anymore. We we're not dealing with
[1:04:55] children. Brother Clarence, when I was a
[1:04:58] child, I spake as a child. I understood
[1:04:59] as a child. And but when I became a man,
[1:05:01] we put away childish things. So, we want
[1:05:03] to eat some real food.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; You know, people coming out of the
[1:05:08] Christmas season, they had all kind of
[1:05:09] food.
[1:05:11] But there's some real spiritual food.
[1:05:12] That's not cereal. That's not milk.
[1:05:14] That's not soy milk or this kind of milk
[1:05:16] or but it's a real food of the word of
[1:05:18] God that quickens us and strengthens us
[1:05:20] and prepares us for battle because
[1:05:21] there's a great battle that lays ahead.
[1:05:23] There's a war that lays ahead. There's a
[1:05:25] there's challenges that lays ahead. But
[1:05:27] by the grace of God, he has raised up
[1:05:28] another generation who under their
[1:05:31] messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:05:33] final age. I really want to salute Oid.
[1:05:36] You appreciate your pastor this morning.
[1:05:38] [applause]
[1:05:40] I'm moving by inspiration this morning.
[1:05:41] He doesn't know I'm doing this. But but
[1:05:44] we appreciate we appreciate you. We love
[1:05:46] you. We thank you for the vision. And I
[1:05:47] heard somebody say, you know, recently
[1:05:49] in the last few days, we are grateful
[1:05:51] for the ministry that we are under. And
[1:05:53] that is I could speak that from myself.
[1:05:58] There are God called men in this season.
[1:06:02] Ephesians says, "For God has set in the
[1:06:04] church." It's not man voting. It's not
[1:06:06] man electing. It's not man choosing. But
[1:06:08] when God sets and puts something upon a
[1:06:10] man's life that you be identified within
[1:06:12] and without, then you know it's the
[1:06:14] Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our
[1:06:16] eyes.
[1:06:18] And the random taught us you can't go
[1:06:20] where your pastor can't take you. You
[1:06:21] can't live higher than your pastor. So
[1:06:23] by the grace of God as we come to this
[1:06:24] end of this year, we want to keep
[1:06:26] praying for our pastor that the Lord
[1:06:28] would strengthen him and like an eagle,
[1:06:29] he would fly even higher so we could fly
[1:06:31] as a church. Hallelujah. to where the
[1:06:34] food is gathered and the where the
[1:06:36] carcass is there, the eagles gathered
[1:06:37] together to get strong meat so we could
[1:06:40] deal with the issues of life. Can the
[1:06:41] church say amen? So we want to salute
[1:06:43] our pastor and all the ministers and the
[1:06:45] elders in the church who stand faithful,
[1:06:48] who are committed, who are dedicated.
[1:06:50] Brother Anthony, Brother Steven Oliveri,
[1:06:52] Brother Gideon, the song leaders,
[1:06:54] Brother Jason,
[1:06:56] [applause]
[1:06:57] [cheering]
[1:06:57] all the elders, the deacons, the
[1:07:00] trustees, the ushers, the technical
[1:07:03] team, the Sunday school team, the
[1:07:05] kitchen team, the hospitality team, the
[1:07:08] parking attendants, the gardening team,
[1:07:11] the welcoming committee, the prayer
[1:07:13] warriors, the mothers, the fathers, the
[1:07:16] grandfathers, the children, the young,
[1:07:19] the old, the healed, those that are
[1:07:22] about to be healed, the delivered, those
[1:07:24] that are about to be delivered, the
[1:07:25] free, those that are about to be free.
[1:07:27] It doesn't matter. We give the Lord
[1:07:30] praise. He said, "Thank him." In the
[1:07:32] good time, praise his name. In the bad
[1:07:34] time, do the same. Hallelujah.
[1:07:39] Glory.
[1:07:41] I'm telling you, we have preached it
[1:07:42] many times before, but this season is
[1:07:44] different. We don't have much time left.
[1:07:46] When you look and see America has put
[1:07:48] their troops in this place and this
[1:07:50] army's in this place and all these
[1:07:52] things they are doing has to wait on you
[1:07:54] and I to come into position. [cheering]
[1:07:57] It is not up to some war room and some
[1:08:00] political debate to decide what happens
[1:08:02] next. What happens next is determined by
[1:08:04] the bride of Jesus Christ. She is God's
[1:08:07] authority on the earth. Oh, you don't
[1:08:09] hear me this morning. Nothing moves
[1:08:11] until we say so. Hallelujah. Elijah shut
[1:08:14] up the heavens.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; There'll be neither due nor rain until I
[1:08:18] call for it. And the bride on the earth
[1:08:20] will have the power to shut up the
[1:08:21] heavens. Nothing will move until we
[1:08:24] speak. Hallelujah. You've got to realize
[1:08:27] who you are. You got to realize the
[1:08:29] power that's locked up in you. And that
[1:08:31] power wants to come forth because when
[1:08:33] two omnipotent meet, the miraculous must
[1:08:35] take place. And there's an omnipotent
[1:08:37] this morning in the person of the Holy
[1:08:39] Ghost. That same angel that never left
[1:08:42] the earth when the prophet left this of
[1:08:43] the earth now fixing things around for
[1:08:46] the coming of the Lord. But there's
[1:08:48] another omnipotent here this morning
[1:08:50] locked up in the seeds of the elect. In
[1:08:53] that elect precious bride of Jesus
[1:08:55] Christ who will be washed by the word,
[1:08:57] washed by the blood, cleansed by the
[1:09:00] spirit that the Holy Spirit himself will
[1:09:03] make himself known.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; So, we want to salute the church.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; I want to appreciate my wife who has put
[1:09:15] up with me
[1:09:20] and my daughter Isabelle
[1:09:25] that the Lord has blessed me with that
[1:09:27] we could be of service and of fellowship
[1:09:30] to the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; And friends, it's later than we think.
[1:09:36] When brother Brandham said these words,
[1:09:37] he said, "It's got me scared that we
[1:09:38] haven't done enough. Have we done
[1:09:40] enough?" You know, and on
[1:09:43] December the 24th, just about 4 days
[1:09:46] ago,
[1:09:48] 60 years ago to be exact, 1965 to 2025.
[1:09:52] Has been 60 years since God in his
[1:09:55] wisdom took the profit of the earth.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; But the Brandon couldn't stay one more
[1:10:00] minute longer because his mission was
[1:10:03] finished. His purpose was finished.
[1:10:05] Every mystery had been revealed.
[1:10:07] Everything that this messenger was
[1:10:09] supposed to do had been accomplished
[1:10:10] because God will never take you off the
[1:10:12] earth unless your mission is
[1:10:13] accomplished. So if you are still here,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; can I say it one more time? God can
[1:10:21] never take you off the earth until your
[1:10:23] mission is accomplished.
[1:10:25] [cheering] So if those who are not here
[1:10:27] are not here, it's because their mission
[1:10:28] has been accomplished. But once there's
[1:10:31] still a mission in your life, God cannot
[1:10:33] take you off the earth. You could be
[1:10:35] sick. You could be tired. You could be
[1:10:37] walking this way, that way. But if
[1:10:38] there's a purpose upon your life, then
[1:10:40] you'll be in the house of God. You'll be
[1:10:42] fighting devils. You'll be dealing with
[1:10:44] the world. You'll be dealing with issues
[1:10:46] and challenges, but nothing's going to
[1:10:48] stop you because there's a purpose upon
[1:10:49] your life. Can the church say, "Amen."
[1:10:52] Turn to your neighbor and tell them
[1:10:53] there's a purpose upon your life.
[1:11:03] I'm just warming up this morning. It's
[1:11:04] the last Sunday, church.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; There are no more Sundays left.
[1:11:09] So, we want to put our all into it this
[1:11:11] morning. There are no more Sundays left.
[1:11:12] So, this is it. What you didn't do in
[1:11:14] the first Sunday, you'll do today. What
[1:11:16] you didn't do in the third Sunday,
[1:11:17] you'll do today. What you didn't do in
[1:11:19] the 15th Sunday, you'll do today.
[1:11:21] There's no more Sundays left in this
[1:11:22] year. So if you didn't get the
[1:11:24] opportunity to give the devil a knockout
[1:11:25] punch on a Sunday, then this is the
[1:11:27] Sunday to do it. You have no other
[1:11:29] Sunday left in this year to do it. Oh,
[1:11:31] you don't hear me this morning. If you
[1:11:33] didn't kick the devil, punch the devil,
[1:11:35] but the brand say booak. If you didn't
[1:11:37] do it in the whole year, then today is
[1:11:39] the only day you have left. Let us do
[1:11:41] what we could do while we could do it.
[1:11:44] We must work while it is day. [cheering]
[1:11:48] Everybody feeling fine?
[1:11:50] Hallelujah.
[1:11:52] Glory.
[1:11:54] You know, but you know, I'm still under
[1:11:56] mentorship.
[1:11:58] I'm still under training.
[1:12:00] But over to say, don't say I'll be I
[1:12:02] won't be too long with you.
[1:12:07] So, I'm taking instruction this morning.
[1:12:10] So, I'm not going to say that this
[1:12:11] morning. But by the grace of the Lord,
[1:12:13] when we come to the house of God,
[1:12:14] friends, it's to distress. But the Bon
[1:12:17] preacher say letting go of the pressure
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; because this year was a lot of pressure
[1:12:21] you know.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; So wait that was just for me.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; This year was a lot of pressure
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; and that how it's supposed to be. It's
[1:12:29] supposed to be a lot of pressure because
[1:12:31] the pressure is what proves the
[1:12:32] character in you. If there's no pressure
[1:12:35] there's no character to be proven. And
[1:12:36] we don't know who you are until the
[1:12:38] pressure comes. And when the pressure
[1:12:39] comes then we can see it that looks like
[1:12:40] a son. That looks like a daughter. Look
[1:12:43] at pressure. Look at stress and they're
[1:12:45] still standing. They should have given
[1:12:47] up but they're still in the house of
[1:12:48] God. They should have backslid but they
[1:12:50] dragged themselves into the house of the
[1:12:52] go. They maybe their mama brought them.
[1:12:54] Maybe their daddy brought them. I don't
[1:12:56] care but they're still here. So which
[1:12:58] mean the devil don't have them because
[1:12:59] they're still in the house of God. Can
[1:13:01] the church say amen? Glory. [music]
[1:13:05] Hallelujah.
[1:13:08] So I'm excited by the grace of God this
[1:13:10] morning. Can we stand to our feet just
[1:13:12] to read three portions of scripture
[1:13:17] for a little encouragement
[1:13:19] this morning from the word of God?
[1:13:22] I want to read Malachi 1,
[1:13:25] 2 Timothy 3 and Revelation 10
[1:13:30] by the grace of God this morning.
[1:13:37] Malachi 1 verse one,
[1:13:44] the burden of the word of the Lord to
[1:13:47] Israel
[1:13:49] by Malachi.
[1:13:52] The burden of the word of the Lord to
[1:13:55] Israel by Malachi. Reading 2 Timothy 3
[1:13:59] and reading verse 16.
[1:14:02] All scripture
[1:14:04] is given by inspiration of God.
[1:14:07] Not some scriptures, but all scripture
[1:14:10] is given by inspiration of God and is
[1:14:13] profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
[1:14:17] for correction, for instruction in
[1:14:20] righteousness,
[1:14:22] that the man of God may be perfect,
[1:14:25] thoroughly furnished unto all good
[1:14:28] works. And lastly, Revelation 10:7.
[1:14:33] But in the days of the voice of the
[1:14:35] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[1:14:38] sound, the mystery of God should be
[1:14:40] finished, as he had declared to his
[1:14:42] servants, the prophets. May the Lord add
[1:14:45] his blessing to the reading of his word.
[1:14:47] Shall we just pray one more time?
[1:14:49] Heavenly Father, we thank you to be in
[1:14:50] your house on this final Sunday of 2025,
[1:14:53] Father. And Lord, there are so many who
[1:14:55] did not make it into this day. And Lord,
[1:14:57] we pray a special blessing, Lord. and
[1:14:59] everyone that's here, Lord, in the
[1:15:01] sanctuary.
