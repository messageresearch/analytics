[5:33] your
[5:33] presence and I pray Jesus that you take.
[5:39] It's my first time in Ivory Coat.
[5:43] You have a beautiful
[5:45] country and it's good to be here. I want
[5:48] to greet all the ministers that are
[5:50] here, all the churches
[5:53] representing. God bless

[6:37] And and the thing of it is
[6:39] we were doing this

[6:44] We were shouting.
[6:46] We were praising
[6:48] God. We were
[6:50] worshiping. You may be seated. You may
[6:53] be seated. And Satan didn't like
[6:57] it. Satan didn't like it.
[7:02] Oh, glory to God.
[7:04] He wanted the worship.
[7:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He wanted this

[7:25] Where is that one? Oh, glory. Oh, glory.
[7:28] Be seated. Where was that? So, Satan has
[7:31] deceived
[7:33] people to believe they could worship God
[7:37] in
[7:40] silence. Satan has deceived
[7:44] people to believe. They should worship
[7:47] God in
[7:49] silence. But when Jesus was coming to
[7:54] Jerusalem upon a
[7:56] donkey, the disciples
[7:59] to palm branches.
[8:05] Hosana. Hosana. Hosana.
[8:08] Hosana. Hosana. Hosana. Hallelujah. Oh

[8:15] You may be seated.
[8:19] The Pharisees.
[8:21] The Pharisees
[8:23] asked Jesus
[8:26] to cool his disciples down.
[8:29] The Pharisees, the asked
[8:33] Jesus to tell them, "Stop the worship."
[8:37] But Jesus
[8:39] said, "If I stop them,
[8:42] the rock's going to
[8:46] [Applause]
[8:49] crown. No
[8:50] man will stop the
[8:54] worship. We worship the king.
[8:58] We worship the king.
[9:01] Glory to
[9:06] [Music]
[9:11] God. You may be seated.
[9:14] Oh
[9:15] my. If
[9:18] if he stops them,
[9:20] if Jesus stop his disciples,
[9:23] the rock's going to cry out.
[9:28] Let's turn our Bibles
[9:31] to St. John chapter
[9:34] 12. John chapter 15
[9:38] and uh in John chapter 21.
[10:03] Thank you Jesus.
[10:06] Today is good
[10:09] Friday. Today Christ is crucified
[10:14] and we want to bring special message
[10:16] this
[10:18] morning and I trust that you'll be
[10:20] edified and strengthened.
[10:24] Amen. Amen.
[10:27] Reading from St. John 12:20.
[10:31] And there were certain Greeks among them
[10:33] that came up to worship at the
[10:39] feast. The same came therefore to
[10:42] Philillip which was of Bethesda of
[10:43] Galilee and desired him saying so we
[10:45] would see
[10:50] Jesus. Philip cometh and tellth Andrew.
[10:53] And again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
[10:58] And Jesus answered them, saying, The
[11:01] hour is come that the Son of Man should
[11:03] be
[11:06] glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto
[11:08] you, except a corner wheat fall into the
[11:10] ground and die, it abide
[11:15] alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth
[11:17] much fruit.
[11:19] free. Let's go to St. John chapter 15.
[11:37] I am the true vine and my father is the
[11:39] husband man.
[11:43] Every branch in me that beareth not
[11:45] fruit, you take it away. And every
[11:46] branch that beareth fruit, he purchased
[11:48] it, that it may bring forth more
[11:55] fruit. Now you are clean through the
[11:57] word which I have spoken unto
[12:01] you. Abide in me and I in you. As the
[12:04] branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
[12:06] except it abide in the vine, no more can
[12:08] ye except you abide in me.
[12:18] I am the vine, ye are the branches. He
[12:20] that abideth in me and I in him, the
[12:22] same bringeth forth much
[12:27] fruit. For without me you can do
[12:30] nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is
[12:33] cast forth as a branch and is withered.
[12:36] And men gather them and cast them into
[12:37] the fire and they burned.
[12:46] If he abide in me and my words abide in
[12:48] you, you shall ask what you will and it
[12:50] shall be done unto
[12:54] you. And our last scripture from St.
[12:59] 21 18 and 19.
[13:05] Verily, verily I say unto thee, when
[13:06] thou was young, thou goodest thyself,
[13:09] and walkest whether thou wouldest, but
[13:11] when thou shall be old, and thou shalt
[13:14] stretch forth thine hands, and another
[13:16] shall thee, and carry thee whether thou
[13:19] wouldest not.
[13:30] This spake he signifying by what depth
[13:32] he should glorify God. And when he had
[13:34] spoken this, he said unto him, "Follow
[13:41] me." May God bless the number
[13:44] of Let us have a word of
[13:46] prayer. Almighty God, Lord, we're in the
[13:50] verge of the supernatural.
[13:53] Lord, we know your
[13:55] spirit is about to pour out.
[13:58] Father, prepare us,
[14:00] Lord. Prepare our hearts. Prepare our
[14:04] minds to receive this dynamics to your
[14:06] mechanic.
[14:09] Honor your word
[14:10] today. Confirm your word with signs.
[14:14] Wonder. May your word be glorified in
[14:16] our
[14:17] midst. In Jesus name I ask. Amen. And
[14:21] amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[14:23] [Music]
[14:24] [Applause]
[14:26] Have a title. The death of a mature
[14:30] ripened corn of wheat.
[14:36] Have a subject,
[14:38] the full maturity of the
[14:40] word turn into power by the death of a
[14:43] corn of wheat.
[14:47] [Music]
[14:49] I have an inspiration
[14:52] from the words Jesus told
[14:54] John to rather follow follow me
[15:00] to follow Christ the
[15:02] word. Now we have two major
[15:05] signs
[15:07] recently. The sign of
[15:10] Russia and the sign of the moon turn
[15:12] into blood.
[15:16] call it a blood
[15:18] moon and brother Brandham spoke about
[15:22] it that these are signs of the end time
[15:26] and the copper and the moon and so
[15:29] on make it turn into like
[15:32] blood and that happened on the
[15:35] 15th of this of this very
[15:38] week but I'm not going to talk about
[15:42] that I do want to bring something about
[15:46] Russia before we get down into the
[15:48] word. Now this is on my
[15:52] article 12 12th of March 2014
[15:56] [Music]
[15:58] written by Mike
[15:59] Whitney Whitney and he he was saying
[16:02] this
[16:04] we are witnessing a huge geopolitical
[16:10] gamer in which the aim is the
[16:12] destruction of Russia as a political
[16:14] force of the US.
[16:18] This is this is a Russian man saying
[16:23] that. Another man said, "History shows
[16:28] that wherever the US
[16:31] medals, chaos and misery are soon to
[16:34] follow."
[16:35] [Music]
[16:37] Following a 30-year rampage that has
[16:40] reduced large swats of Central Asia,
[16:47] [Music]
[16:50] and the Middle East are anarchy and
[16:52] ruin.
[16:53] [Music]
[16:55] The US military has finally met its
[16:58] match.
[17:04] In this in Ukraine that that serves as a
[17:08] small operating base for Russia.
[17:12] and Ukraine. And they went on to talk
[17:15] about how uh Russia come and seize
[17:18] control of of Cremia,
[17:24] but I will skip now.
[17:27] Now I know you will known by
[17:31] now that Russia has made a move and
[17:33] seize a
[17:36] Cremia and Cremia is now part of Russia.
[17:40] [Music]
[17:42] Now this is what brother Brandham said
[17:43] in the angel of the Lord
[17:48] 1951. He said now uh uh he said we are
[17:52] nearing that
[17:54] time things will get worse and
[17:58] worse when Russia goes down there
[18:03] to get that oil.
[18:06] Look
[18:07] out. That is all she needs.
[18:11] of United
[18:15] States 1954.
[18:19] You say, "What is it?
[18:21] It's the devil."
[18:23] The invasion is on.
[18:26] It is unclean
[18:28] spirits that are possessing the people.
[18:32] The the invasion of the United
[18:35] States. The church is overthrown by the
[18:38] devil.
[18:40] Please, he said, "Oh
[18:42] God, send us some oldfashioned
[18:46] men, who doesn't know it from
[18:50] me that knows the power of his
[18:55] resurrection, who will preach
[18:59] repentance and men and women to come to
[19:01] the
[19:03] altar who love
[19:06] Jesus." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's
[19:09] the kind of men we need right now.
[19:13] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[19:15] He said what this people
[19:17] before they preach every old
[19:21] thing besides repentance and
[19:25] sin and the old rugged
[19:29] cross. When you lay down the facts down,
[19:35] the people come to hear you in the
[19:37] service.
[19:40] You're trying to preach the
[19:42] gospel and get people
[19:45] repenting and they don't want to hear
[19:48] it. But
[19:50] brethren, they are going to have to
[19:53] repent or
[19:56] perish. Listen to
[19:58] brother. God,
[20:00] let me preach like never before.
[20:03] [Music]
[20:06] Let me preach to dying
[20:09] men as a dying man
[20:13] myself. Let me preach to
[20:15] people like I never have another sermon
[20:18] to
[20:19] preach. Let me persuade
[20:22] them. come to the
[20:24] altar to be like
[20:27] Christian to live in the
[20:30] neighborhood and stop blowing up at
[20:34] this. That's the
[20:36] devil. That's demon spirits upon
[20:40] Christian. Prophet talk about demon
[20:44] spirits upon Christian.
[20:47] We want to be real
[20:50] Christian. Oh, give the Lord some praise
[20:52] God.
[20:54] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Glory to
[20:57] God. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[21:01] Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[21:03] Everything is in order.
[21:06] Remember before the rain fell,
[21:10] Noah was in the
[21:11] ark, before the fire
[21:13] fell, Lot was out of
[21:17] Sodom.
[21:18] Listen. And I
[21:21] think that the angel of
[21:25] destruction is holding the hand of
[21:28] Russia
[21:31] with the atomic bombs
[21:35] until the church comes
[21:41] together as one great body of Christ.
[21:47] There is going to be a unity of the
[21:51] faith. Oh, glory to God. There is going
[21:55] to be a bright
[21:58] revival. Seven thunders is the bright
[22:02] revival. And Africa, Africa, you're
[22:05] going to have
[22:06] it. You're going to have
[22:08] revival. God said so. God said so.
[22:18] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. You may be
[22:21] seated. After this article came out.
[22:26] I read this on a
[22:28] Sunday. The next day there is a
[22:33] report from Russia where one person
[22:37] said Russia is the only
[22:40] country that can reduce
[22:44] America to atomic
[22:50] ashes. God has now positionally placed
[22:57] Russia. You're not hearing
[23:00] me. You're not hearing
[23:03] me. Put Russia in his place.
[23:09] He's going to put you.
[23:11] [Applause]
[23:20] Oh,
[23:21] that's your place. God bless please in
[23:25] Christ the bless adoption time adoption
[23:29] glory
[23:31] hallelujah
[23:32] [Music]
[23:34] you will be seated praise God praise God
[23:39] you will be seated from the baptism of
[23:41] the Holy Spirit
[23:45] he says again getting wicked and
[23:49] wicked he said we are living in a
[23:52] is till the people are born with evil
[23:57] spirits and the whole
[24:00] thing become a conglomeration of
[24:04] sin and that's the
[24:07] reason we are in the
[24:09] day and that's the
[24:12] reason Russia is playing
[24:16] exactly in the hands of
[24:19] God God is using communism
[24:24] and
[24:25] communism will destroy the entire thing.
[24:30] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah.
[24:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be
[24:34] seated. And the
[24:37] reason they some serpent
[24:40] seed the reason God has raised up
[24:45] Russia with the atomic bomb.
[24:49] to wipe her off like
[24:51] the like the
[24:53] flood. The Bible
[24:56] said Russia an atheistic
[25:00] country is playing in the hands of
[25:02] Almighty
[25:05] God. Just like King
[25:08] Nebuchadnezzar was to destroy
[25:11] Israel
[25:13] because they failed to walk with
[25:18] God. They failed to walk with
[25:22] God. And
[25:24] brother had seven
[25:26] visions in
[25:29] 1933. Seven visions set vision which he
[25:32] said must come to pass.
[25:35] Before the coming of the
[25:37] Lord and the seventh
[25:39] vision, there was
[25:43] destruction over
[25:47] America. The end is
[25:49] here. The end has
[25:52] come.
[25:54] Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet
[26:00] before that
[26:01] day. Elast has already
[26:05] come. Elast has already
[26:08] come. You are here.
[26:11] You are the
[26:14] [Applause]
[26:20] praise. Glory to
[26:22] God. You may be seated. Oh, hallelujah.
[26:26] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, praise God.
[26:35] Blessed be of the
[26:37] Lord. Brother Brandon, from recognizing
[26:40] today's message,
[26:43] Russia, Russia only receive a place in
[26:45] the world in
[26:50] science. No more than 40 years
[26:54] ago, the First World
[26:56] War, they ignore Russia.
[27:00] some big old Siberian
[27:03] with beard all all over the face.
[27:08] But Russia
[27:10] has recognized a place.
[27:13] She has to do
[27:15] it to fulfill scriptures.
[27:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[27:22] Notice man has the same six senses
[27:27] 6,000 years ago.
[27:30] Man has
[27:31] come. He said man has come from horse
[27:33] and
[27:35] buggy to
[27:38] astronaut because he turned away from
[27:44] faith. He he trust
[27:47] himself. Notice Russia come to
[27:52] herself and at the same time the bride
[27:56] has recognized the evening light.
[27:59] Just begin to
[28:01] recognize. The world has
[28:03] recognized. The nation has recognized.
[28:07] Science has recognized.
[28:09] The devil has recognized.
[28:12] It's time he can wreck
[28:14] [Music]
[28:17] women. Watch this. Watch this. The devil
[28:20] has recognized
[28:22] that he could wreck the
[28:26] church, wreck the people.
[28:30] And
[28:30] God has recognized
[28:33] that there's a people on the
[28:36] earth that he has predestinated to
[28:41] life. He
[28:43] recognized this is the
[28:45] time to send his message.
[28:50] What's the message? What's the message?
[28:53] He is not dead.
[28:56] He is raised from the dead.
[28:59] Go tell my
[29:01] disciples the dynamics is here.
[29:05] Oh, glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here
[29:07] we go. Are you ready? Amen. Amen.
[29:11] Brother,
[29:13] I'm going to say something.
[29:15] National force
[29:18] put Israel in a homeland.
[29:21] National force will put the
[29:24] church in the world council of
[29:28] churches. The power of
[29:30] God will put the people in the
[29:34] fire. The power
[29:37] of that means we have got to
[29:41] connect with the power of God. to the
[29:44] jail. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah.
[29:46] Hallelujah.
[29:49] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah.
[29:51] Hallelujah. God praise.
[29:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because here why
[29:57] she would recognize her position in the
[29:59] word.
[30:02] Hold it. Hold it. You mean I recognize
[30:06] my position in the word?
[30:10] [Applause]
[30:17] Hold it. 8 minutes. 8 minutes. The
[30:19] church members
[30:22] only go to church
[30:24] and follow pastors and follow churches.
[30:29] But the
[30:30] bride, she connects with her
[30:32] [Applause]
[30:34] husband and he is the way.
[30:38] The husband
[30:40] will tell you
[30:42] follow me.
[30:44] You are not following a man.
[30:46] You are following
[30:48] the unfailing body
[30:52] of the son of man. Oh, can we give the
[30:55] Lord some
[30:58] praise? Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah.
[31:03] Glory to God.
[31:05] You want me seated?
[31:07] So the bride would recognize her
[31:10] position in the world.
[31:13] Jesus help us to find his position in
[31:16] the
[31:17] word. He found the
[31:20] scripture. The spirit is upon
[31:23] me. John found the
[31:26] scripture. I am the voice of
[31:29] God in the wilderness.
[31:32] You have got to
[31:35] find. And when you find your
[31:38] strength, no man can take you
[31:41] up. No man can [ __ ] you
[31:44] up. You found
[31:49] [Applause]
[31:54] your seated. In other
[31:57] words, right now you may appreciate
[32:02] Somebody calling you
[32:05] out, acknowledging
[32:09] you, shaking your
[32:11] hand. Somebody tell you your testimony
[32:13] is
[32:15] good or your preaching is
[32:18] great or your special is such a
[32:23] blessing. But when you find your
[32:27] place, you don't need that.
[32:31] [Applause]
[32:38] You don't
[32:40] need man's
[32:44] approval. This
[32:46] is my beloved
[32:51] son. You don't
[32:53] need mine's approval.
[32:57] You are God's son.
[33:00] George's
[33:01] daughter, the devil can't do anything
[33:07] [Applause]
[33:15] about Glory to God. You are glad at you.
[33:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[33:21] You are free. You are free.
[33:25] You are free.
[33:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[33:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[33:32] Praise God. Praise God.
[33:36] [Applause]
[33:46] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah.
[33:50] Oh glory. Hallelujah. Oh glory.
[33:52] Hallelujah. Brother,
[33:54] now watch. He promised to send you
[33:56] heavenly light.
[33:59] Listen to ripen the word
[34:03] seed sown for this
[34:07] day. Sit down a minute.
[34:10] Oh hallelujah. Oh
[34:23] hallelujah. In other
[34:25] words, son of man was to bring
[34:30] seed because son of man is the swer of
[34:34] the seed.
[34:37] That seed must come
[34:38] [Music]
[34:40] mature. That seed must get
[34:43] right.
[34:45] You you have to get a
[34:50] revelation that
[34:52] you are a corner.
[34:56] You are not shocked.
[34:59] You are not shocked.
[35:01] [Applause]
[35:18] Listen, listen.
[35:28] The
[35:29] church can't take the word.
[35:35] The church wants emotions.
[35:41] The bride
[35:43] takes the
[35:47] word because the bride have a
[35:50] revelation and the word is
[35:53] God and God is the word.
[35:56] [Applause]
[36:14] What's the secret?
[36:17] What said what's the secret?
[36:20] The
[36:20] word is in the
[36:27] bread. So
[36:29] God put the seed word
[36:35] Christ the pyramid
[36:38] in
[36:39] you in word
[36:41] form. All the
[36:45] potential all the
[36:48] power all the
[36:50] glory is in the way.
[36:54] [Applause]
[37:01] Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[37:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[37:07] Hallelujah. You may be seated. That is
[37:10] why the devil
[37:13] job was to try to disconnect the bride
[37:16] from the
[37:19] word and bringing men's
[37:23] ideas, men's interpretation.
[37:26] Dumb. Men's opinion opinion
[37:37] dumb. You may be seated. So if you are
[37:41] the bride,
[37:43] you can take rebuke.
[37:47] You can take instruction.
[37:51] You can take
[37:53] correction. You can take every
[37:57] mystery. Take seven
[38:00] thunder. You can take place of
[38:08] trial. You can take
[38:12] Calvary. You can take the
[38:14] cross. Give the Lord some praises.
[38:19] [Applause]
[38:27] [Music]
[38:29] [Applause]
[38:32] All that was in God,
[38:35] he poured into Christ.
[38:40] The spirit.
[38:42] The spirit became word.
[38:46] And the word became flesh.
[38:56] And the
[38:57] word went to
[38:59] Calvary and say it's
[39:02] finished. It's
[39:04] finished. It's
[39:07] finished. You are going to be sealed.
[39:10] You are going to be f
[39:12] [Applause]
[39:22] So
[39:22] brother, he promised in the last
[39:25] day in the evening time, listen, the sun
[39:30] would come
[39:31] out to ripen that
[39:35] seed. Hold it now. So now we have son of
[39:39] man. Now we have
[39:42] seed. Now we have son of
[39:45] God, spirit
[39:47] to ripen seed.
[39:50] So if dynamics,
[39:52] if
[40:00] dynamics, if dynamic
[40:03] comes and you don't have the
[40:07] seed, you're going to
[40:08] [Music]
[40:11] get that will be going back to
[40:15] Pentecost. We don't want that.
[40:19] We don't want that.
[40:22] [Applause]
[40:32] So
[40:33] all the seven thunder bright
[40:38] promises had to come into you
[40:42] for you to come to this
[40:43] [Applause]
[40:45] day. This day.
[40:50] today that Jesus could
[40:53] say except
[40:58] fall into the ground and
[41:01] die you are going to
[41:10] [Applause]
[41:14] die. Oh glory.
[41:18] He said the seventh seal.
[41:20] Remember is the end of all things.
[41:24] It is the end. It is the end of
[41:27] struggling world.
[41:30] It is the end of struggling
[41:33] nature. It is the end of the trumpet.
[41:37] It is the end of the
[41:39] vials. It is the end of the earth.
[41:43] It even ends time.
[41:47] shall be
[41:48] known. The seventh
[41:51] seal right now. We are under the seventh
[41:56] seal. And the angel of the Lord
[42:00] is on the
[42:01] earth pulling back the
[42:05] war, back the
[42:07] wind, pulling back
[42:10] everything for you.
[42:12] [Applause]
[42:19] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Glory to
[42:22] God. Glory to God.
[42:25] Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah brotherham.
[42:28] Praise the name of the Lord.
[42:32] Watch age.
[42:36] Now in a moment
[42:39] he said the false vine came to full
[42:41] fruction in the
[42:46] her fruit would mature and
[42:50] ripen that evilspirited
[42:54] church full of
[42:59] iniquity. And if this is
[43:01] true, then it must also be
[43:05] true that the bright church will mature.
[43:12] [Applause]
[43:15] Brother
[43:16] Brham is defining
[43:20] this season and time
[43:22] that the bride church
[43:26] with
[43:28] mature and here we
[43:30] go. Her rightness
[43:34] will be an identification
[43:38] with her Lord.
[43:41] by means of the
[43:43] word. So when you can be identified with
[43:48] the
[43:50] word, it proves
[43:53] you are right.
[43:56] [Applause]
[43:58] Listen, listen. friend or no friend,
[44:04] [Applause]
[44:05] [Music]
[44:08] you will have to leave
[44:11] churches. You will have to
[44:16] [Music]
[44:17] leave for the word's
[44:20] sake. The word is your
[44:23] friend. The word is your
[44:26] husband. The word is good.
[44:30] Don't let no
[44:32] one cut you off from that
[44:40] [Applause]
[44:47] way. You may be
[44:49] seated. Brother,
[44:52] this is from God's provided place of
[44:53] worship.
[44:58] He said, "No matter how well we are
[45:00] taught, here we go now. How well we
[45:05] believe, how much of the Bible we say is
[45:08] true,
[45:11] it's got to be the dynamics have got to
[45:13] be
[45:16] there to set that word on
[45:20] fire and start it rolling."
[45:24] So we have the word. We have the truth.
[45:28] We believe the word. And it takes
[45:32] dynamics to get that word
[45:36] rolling. Watch.
[45:39] That's what the matter with the church
[45:42] today. We are lacking the dynamical
[45:46] power to press this
[45:49] word and make it live for the day. Steve
[45:53] Martin Luther Martin Luther at mechanics
[45:56] and dynamics
[45:57] John Wesley John Wesley at mechanics and
[45:59] dynamics what about our day
[46:03] the church should be fully grown
[46:10] the church should be fully grown
[46:14] ready to go and meet Christ
[46:16] with the manifestation
[46:19] of every
[46:21] blessing operating in that one body.
[46:26] Oh, glory to God.
[46:29] Are you with me? Let's go a little
[46:31] further.
[46:33] The Holy Ghost will always point to the
[46:36] word.
[46:37] [Music]
[46:39] Here we go. He
[46:42] died to confirm that
[46:46] word and make that word positive.
[46:50] positive. He died that he could come
[46:53] himself
[46:56] into the world.
[46:58] So God is not looking to use
[47:04] men to use the word in
[47:08] men. So
[47:10] God has to put the
[47:13] word in the man.
[47:16] Thank
[47:17] God the word in the
[47:21] man. Then the voice of
[47:24] the
[47:25] charity the spirit the spirit drops down
[47:29] the man speaks from the
[47:33] [Applause]
[47:34] throne. No more
[47:38] man coming down using his own
[47:43] words. Oh God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[47:47] [Applause]
[47:50] Now what?
[47:52] He is the dynamics of the mechanics.
[47:56] The mechanics of the church.
[47:59] What is it? Apostles, prophets,
[48:02] prophets,
[48:03] teachers. He is the dynamics that works
[48:09] that. Now watch. Now watch this. Listen
[48:12] carefully.
[48:13] Pastor is the word.
[48:17] You can read it in Ephesians
[48:25] 4. Evangelist is the
[48:28] word. You could read it in the
[48:34] Bible.
[48:36] Therefore, we have to
[48:38] connect with our word.
[48:50] Ephesians 4, everything that made fresh.
[48:56] [Applause]
[49:00] In other words, and go to them, the
[49:02] pastor, the pastor, the apostle, the
[49:05] teacher, the doctor, the evangelist, the
[49:07] evangelist, they become one with the
[49:08] world.
[49:12] Then they as it become a
[49:16] channel to release
[49:23] God. No longer amen.
[49:27] No longer. Amen.
[49:30] The word
[49:31] itself amen.
[49:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Now,
[49:46] Jesus, sit down a minute, make a little
[49:50] greeter. Jesus made a powerful statement
[49:56] in St. John
[49:58] 15:7. He said, "If
[50:01] he abide in
[50:03] me and my
[50:06] words abide in
[50:08] you, you can
[50:11] ask whatever you
[50:13] want and it
[50:16] shall it
[50:18] shall
[50:19] [Music]
[50:21] it." Hallelujah.
[50:27] Jesus, you will be seated. He said, "I
[50:30] am the
[50:32] vine and I need
[50:35] fruit." The vine don't bear the
[50:39] fruit. The branch is
[50:42] the fruit. He said, "I am the
[50:45] vine. You are the branch.
[51:02] The man don't make
[51:07] babies. Women make
[51:09] babies. So
[51:11] Jesus
[51:14] [Applause]
[51:19] prayed. He call you
[51:22] to be his wife.
[51:25] to produce Messiah.
[51:28] [Applause]
[51:41] Notice he put a
[51:44] condition upon
[51:46] asking and that condition
[51:49] is
[51:52] abiding.
[51:54] Abiding is not in today and out
[51:59] tomorrow. To abide is to
[52:02] stay to
[52:04] remain to stay focused focus
[52:09] not looking to the
[52:11] left not looking to the right. You are
[52:15] staying the
[52:16] course focus. Your eyes towards
[52:21] Jerusalem. Your eyes towards the
[52:24] cross, your eyes towards
[52:28] Calvary. See no man but
[52:39] Jesus. You may be
[52:42] seated. We're going good. Time is good.
[52:44] You
[52:46] see five. Let me just
[52:49] minutes.
[52:58] Listen to brother Brandham speaking
[53:01] about Moses.
[53:03] You see you see Peter denied
[53:07] Christ and that might look bad. He he
[53:12] cursed but he was the right
[53:16] man with wrong behavior.
[53:21] [Applause]
[53:23] So, so you are the right man.
[53:28] Your behavior may not
[53:30] [Applause]
[53:31] be the right man.
[53:35] You are the right
[53:36] [Applause]
[53:43] son. The devil is a
[53:46] liar. The devil is a liar.
[53:50] You are going to be free.
[53:55] [Applause]
[54:04] You may be seated. So don't you feel
[54:10] condemned. Don't let the devil torment
[54:13] your
[54:15] mind because this happened in your
[54:18] life that happened in your
[54:21] life is why Jesus died.
[54:27] [Applause]
[54:35] Jesus Jesus
[54:37] died that the blood
[54:41] that his
[54:42] blood could speak on your
[54:45] [Applause]
[54:46] behalf. Jesus tells the father, "I die
[54:51] for
[54:52] them. I pay the price for
[54:55] them.
[55:03] Listen, listen. Under the blood, God
[55:08] doesn't even see your sins.
[55:11] Under the blood, God doesn't even see
[55:14] your
[55:16] mistakes. When he looks at you
[55:22] [Applause]
[55:27] deliver
[55:32] blood of
[55:34] blood sprinkle
[55:39] sprinkle sprinkle upon
[55:44] [Applause]
[55:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[55:51] [Applause]
[55:53] When you understand
[55:55] that by
[55:57] revelation there is nothing against you.
[56:03] [Applause]
[56:14] Understand this.
[56:16] We we stand justified.
[56:20] Justified. And brother Brandham brought
[56:24] out the hidden
[56:25] mystery of justification.
[56:30] And the mystery of
[56:33] justification is you never did it.
[56:37] [Applause]
[56:39] You are so
[56:47] free. Your
[56:49] sins trapped in the sea of
[56:54] forgetful can't remember
[57:00] it.
[57:01] God is too big to remember.
[57:06] You remember what you
[57:09] did? So big.
[57:12] So great.
[57:14] He can't
[57:18] [Applause]
[57:24] forget. Remember the season but I'm
[57:28] talking about
[57:29] Moses. He said although his
[57:31] mother had thoroughly instruct him on
[57:34] what to
[57:36] do what he would do and God raised him
[57:41] up all this knowledge as good as it
[57:46] is yet it had to be set
[57:49] off because that was only
[57:53] mechanics. So
[57:56] Moses Moses
[57:58] knowledge of being a special child.
[58:02] His knowledge of being born to be a
[58:05] deliverer.
[58:08] His knowledge of his
[58:11] calling couldn't do
[58:15] it. All of that was
[58:18] [Music]
[58:19] mechanics. But one
[58:21] day fire
[58:24] Fire.
[58:25] [Applause]
[58:32] We talk about a cell phone.
[58:35] They could buy a cell phone.
[58:38] They could put in the SIM
[58:42] card. If it's
[58:45] noted, it will not work.
[58:51] It could be the best
[58:54] phone, but it has to be
[59:01] activated. It could be the most
[59:03] expensive phone
[59:07] and you you have to be
[59:13] activated. That's what the dynamics is
[59:15] for.
[59:19] activate
[59:22] you. Call your
[59:25] father. If he
[59:28] me and my ways
[59:31] are you are
[59:33] activated, you can call on
[59:37] glory. It's going to be
[59:39] healed. The pride is going to
[59:42] see the people is going to walk. You are
[59:46] activated.
[59:54] [Applause]
[1:00:00] I
[1:00:02] [Applause]
[1:00:10] release.
[1:00:20] Hallelujah. Heat.
[1:00:31] Heat.
[1:00:33] Yeah.
[1:00:43] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:00:47] [Applause]
[1:01:00] [Music]
[1:01:05] [Applause]
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:09] [Applause]
[1:01:13] Heat. Heat.
[1:01:16] [Applause]
[1:01:39] Heat. Heat.
[1:01:44] [Applause]
[1:01:56] You may be
[1:01:57] [Applause]
[1:02:03] [Applause]
[1:02:06] seated.
[1:02:11] Heat.
[1:02:12] [Applause]
[1:02:21] Heat.
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:40] Listen from world falling
[1:02:42] apart. Brother Brandham,
[1:02:46] he said we see
[1:02:48] nations, Israel awaken.
[1:02:52] We see the mechanical thing taking
[1:02:55] place. Now, here we go. The spirit,
[1:02:59] the dynamics from his
[1:03:03] word to get into his
[1:03:06] church and drive them to
[1:03:09] Calvary, then to the rapture.
[1:03:13] The spirit has to come to drive us to
[1:03:17] Calvary.
[1:03:21] Now listen, we are going
[1:03:24] somewhere. We on our way to the
[1:03:27] resurrection. We on our way to the
[1:03:30] rapture, but we have some steps to
[1:03:33] make. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We have some
[1:03:36] to
[1:03:38] make. This is one
[1:03:40] stop. Calvary.
[1:03:44] [Applause]
[1:03:50] Jesus.
[1:03:52] When these Greeks
[1:03:55] came to
[1:03:56] Jesus, they said,
[1:03:58] "Sir, we would see Jesus. We want to see
[1:04:02] him. Where is he? I want to see him.
[1:04:06] Show
[1:04:07] him. Show him to me." Hallelujah.
[1:04:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:04:12] Hallelujah. Show him to me. And when
[1:04:16] they brought Jesus,
[1:04:19] When they brought these
[1:04:21] Greeks, the
[1:04:23] disciples didn't call him
[1:04:26] aside Greeks
[1:04:29] aside. Explain this to
[1:04:32] them. Explain that to
[1:04:34] them. The
[1:04:36] disciples, the true
[1:04:38] disciples brought those
[1:04:40] men straight to
[1:04:44] Jesus. Yeah.
[1:04:47] He is the
[1:04:49] way and Jesus the first thing he said to
[1:04:54] them except
[1:04:57] we fall into the
[1:04:59] ground and die. In other words, you
[1:05:03] can't see me this
[1:05:07] way. You got to go to the
[1:05:14] cross. Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:05:18] You may be seated. We know there are
[1:05:21] three
[1:05:23] stages of the Christian
[1:05:25] walk at the cross. On the cross. And the
[1:05:30] third one is when the cross is on your
[1:05:35] back. Hallelujah. You come to Christ,
[1:05:39] you come at the cross. But then he just
[1:05:43] has to put you on the
[1:05:45] cross. Let them
[1:05:48] laugh. Let them
[1:05:50] talk. Let them
[1:05:52] criticize. You are on the
[1:05:54] cross. Father, forgive them.
[1:05:58] Father, you are dying to your
[1:06:01] sins. You are dying to the world. You
[1:06:05] are dying and Christ is coming to
[1:06:09] life. Glory to God.
[1:06:12] No man will get
[1:06:15] glory glory that belongs to
[1:06:18] God. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. No
[1:06:23] flesh to get glory.
[1:06:26] It's a death. It's a real
[1:06:29] death to come to that third
[1:06:32] step to carry the
[1:06:35] cross on your back. And Jesus told
[1:06:40] Peter, he said, "When you're young,
[1:06:44] you do what you want to do.
[1:06:46] You go where you want to go. You're
[1:06:49] doing your own
[1:06:50] thing. Come
[1:06:52] on. I can't do that no
[1:06:56] [Applause]
[1:07:05] more.
[1:07:07] [Applause]
[1:07:10] Has that hour arrived?
[1:07:12] Has the hour arrived
[1:07:16] where we are understanding?
[1:07:19] We can no longer do our own
[1:07:23] thing. You You can't be a
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:27] freethinker because
[1:07:31] the a free thinker. Okay.
[1:07:36] Because when the
[1:07:37] simstress cutting the dress, the sim to
[1:07:40] cut the
[1:07:42] dress she cuts it according to a
[1:07:49] pattern. What
[1:07:51] remain is the free
[1:07:55] thinking. So you have to be
[1:07:58] cut according to pattern.
[1:08:02] Your life is not your life.
[1:08:06] Your life become his life.
[1:08:10] His life begins to live through you.
[1:08:17] [Applause]
[1:08:28] Paul said death to me
[1:08:31] and life to the church,
[1:08:34] life to the body. Death I am dying and
[1:08:38] the church is coming to life.
[1:08:42] The ministers
[1:08:44] has got to die.
[1:08:46] Yeah.
[1:08:49] Going forward
[1:08:51] it'll be different.
[1:08:53] If we have to move into this great
[1:08:57] ministry, it will prove to be costly.
[1:09:02] It's more than a title of pastor
[1:09:06] or call card evangelist.
[1:09:10] It's a little more than that.
[1:09:13] It's if we're going to follow him
[1:09:16] all the way.
[1:09:19] The dynamics is to drive us there.
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:23] It's to push us there.
[1:09:26] Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:09:29] So, here we go. God has to reveal to you
[1:09:35] that you are a corner
[1:09:37] wheat. Isn't that right? than you
[1:09:42] revelation. Understand that you have to
[1:09:46] die to produce
[1:09:49] life to go forward.
[1:09:52] progressive genuine.
[1:09:56] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:09:58] God.
[1:10:00] Brother call it a total separation,
[1:10:06] not partial,
[1:10:08] a total
[1:10:11] separation from from
[1:10:14] unbelief. Now watch,
[1:10:17] we are not to go back in the world no
[1:10:18] more,
[1:10:20] but to cleave to God.
[1:10:24] He said Jesus is coming after a bride, a
[1:10:28] woman, a church that is separated from
[1:10:31] the children of the world.
[1:10:33] She is separated
[1:10:35] from the fashions of this mother of
[1:10:39] God. She is
[1:10:41] separated listen from the cares and
[1:10:45] tradition of the churches.
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:49] [Applause]
[1:10:50] That church do it this way.
[1:10:54] We have nothing to do with that.
[1:10:58] We want the way.
[1:11:02] [Applause]
[1:11:04] Yes, they're doing it that
[1:11:06] way. That's
[1:11:10] tradition. We are busting
[1:11:13] tradition. Breaking men's
[1:11:23] [Applause]
[1:11:24] ide fallen.
[1:11:27] Oh, glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here
[1:11:30] we go.
[1:11:33] As husband and wife
[1:11:36] is one,
[1:11:38] so does the bride and the word becomes
[1:11:39] one.
[1:11:41] Here we go. For the word
[1:11:44] is living through the
[1:11:48] bread. That's her
[1:11:53] credential. That's
[1:11:56] identification.
[1:11:59] Holy
[1:12:04] identification said the
[1:12:06] word living in the
[1:12:09] bride is her identification.
[1:12:14] Well,
[1:12:16] brother, are you identify with this
[1:12:18] brother?
[1:12:21] That's not what the prophet said.
[1:12:25] To identify
[1:12:34] withdification. Amen.
[1:12:42] I didn't come from
[1:12:46] Trinidad. I come from heaven.
[1:12:50] You are not from Ivory
[1:12:53] Co. from Ghana. From Nigeria.
[1:12:58] No. No. Your dust is from
[1:13:00] [Applause]
[1:13:02] here. You come from
[1:13:05] Ghana. You going back to God.
[1:13:08] at you.
[1:13:12] [Applause]
[1:13:16] [Music]
[1:13:18] Yes, brother.
[1:13:21] A separation.
[1:13:23] Watch this. from everything,
[1:13:27] anything, from church, from community,
[1:13:31] from a belief, from
[1:13:34] family, anything that would stand
[1:13:37] between
[1:13:38] you and leaving the entire word of
[1:13:44] God. If your
[1:13:46] soul not punctuate,
[1:13:50] every promise with of this God with an
[1:13:53] Amen.
[1:13:56] There is something
[1:13:57] wrong. Glory to God. So as the
[1:14:01] bride, every word is
[1:14:05] amen.
[1:14:07] Notice you're not bringing an
[1:14:09] interpretation to
[1:14:12] you. The word will interpret
[1:14:16] itself. The
[1:14:18] manifestation will be the
[1:14:20] interpretation.
[1:14:22] your word the Bible interpret itself.
[1:14:30] Now watch the
[1:14:33] churches build so much
[1:14:36] systems around the world.
[1:14:40] Watch it is back to the word back to the
[1:14:44] life system doesn't have
[1:14:47] life. It's only the word that has
[1:14:51] life. Systems are built around the word.
[1:14:56] System. The word have
[1:14:59] life. No man deceive
[1:15:02] you. We don't belong to a
[1:15:06] system. We belong to the
[1:15:09] capstone. We belong to
[1:15:12] Jesus. We are wife of the lamb.
[1:15:21] Okay, okay. Let me get a home
[1:15:24] sh message. So we receive
[1:15:29] Jesus talking about the disciples of
[1:15:33] old brought the
[1:15:35] seekers, the believers or the people.
[1:15:41] He brought them into the presence of
[1:15:44] Jesus, into the presence of some
[1:15:48] organization or doctrine,
[1:15:51] but bringing them into the presence of
[1:15:53] Christ.
[1:15:56] Hear what says, not bringing the people
[1:15:58] to some
[1:16:00] doctrine, bringing the people into
[1:16:04] presence.
[1:16:05] [Applause]
[1:16:09] That is genuine
[1:16:12] disciples. That is genuine
[1:16:16] fivefold, genuine ministers.
[1:16:20] Bring the
[1:16:22] people into
[1:16:25] presence. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:16:29] Watch Brother said, "It takes a humble
[1:16:34] heart dedicated to God
[1:16:38] to bring Jesus
[1:16:40] Christ into present
[1:16:46] tense.
[1:16:48] Listen, listen. Listen
[1:16:51] again. It takes a humble
[1:16:53] heart, not a big head.
[1:16:59] A humble
[1:17:01] heart, not a big head full of
[1:17:04] [Applause]
[1:17:05] knowledge. That's what Goliath
[1:17:08] had a big
[1:17:10] head. And David only had a
[1:17:15] rock, a
[1:17:17] revelation. He was excited
[1:17:23] about he ran to meet Goliath.
[1:17:28] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:30] And I am so excited
[1:17:33] because dynamics is going to fall.
[1:17:36] [Applause]
[1:17:46] You find Christ in
[1:17:48] death, not in a manger,
[1:17:52] not in a
[1:17:54] confession. A true servant
[1:17:57] takes you to
[1:17:59] him and he is the
[1:18:01] word. And then brother Brandham if
[1:18:05] Christ is on earth
[1:18:06] today a real
[1:18:09] servant take him to Christ. He said
[1:18:12] Christ is here in the form of the
[1:18:14] word and the word brings
[1:18:17] life. No he is the
[1:18:20] word. He is this Bible made living.
[1:18:25] And when you die to
[1:18:27] yourself, like Christ, like the corner
[1:18:31] wheat, then the word lives in you
[1:18:35] and brings forth the same
[1:18:38] results it did in the living
[1:18:41] God. The same
[1:18:45] results we will have when we die.
[1:18:51] Same
[1:18:52] result,
[1:18:55] same
[1:18:57] miracle, same
[1:18:59] power, same
[1:19:01] witness,
[1:19:04] same angel.
[1:19:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When
[1:19:11] we
[1:19:16] die,
[1:19:17] listen. This
[1:19:19] means that you have no enemy out
[1:19:25] there. There is no enemy church
[1:19:29] or enemy group.
[1:19:32] Jesus told
[1:19:34] you, whatever you do, do it
[1:19:38] quickly. It won't stop
[1:19:42] nothing. Oh,
[1:19:44] hallelujah. You understand what I'm
[1:19:46] saying?
[1:19:48] The hour has come for you to focus on
[1:19:51] your
[1:19:52] life. Focus on your
[1:19:55] work according with what that one is
[1:19:59] doing. That one is doing. God will
[1:20:02] vindicate
[1:20:05] you as his sons and daughters.
[1:20:09] [Applause]
[1:20:17] I'm about to
[1:20:19] close. He's talking about rising of the
[1:20:22] sun. Talking about a son of man is to be
[1:20:26] wave over the
[1:20:28] people. He said, "Who is the son of
[1:20:30] man?" In the beginning was the word. The
[1:20:33] word was with God. The word was God.
[1:20:37] Watch four. The word again is waved over
[1:20:43] the
[1:20:43] people that the dead traditions of
[1:20:47] man and the son of God is alive
[1:20:51] again with the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:55] Spirit giving us
[1:20:57] life as Christ was the first one to
[1:21:02] raise. He was the first
[1:21:04] fruits of those that
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:08] slept in the
[1:21:10] bride. It is to be a sheath waved
[1:21:14] again. Waving of the sheath.
[1:21:18] What was the
[1:21:20] sheath? The first one that come to
[1:21:23] mature.
[1:21:25] The first one that proved it was a
[1:21:29] wheat.
[1:21:31] So William Brham, he was the first one
[1:21:35] that was
[1:21:36] mature and God adopted him and he waved
[1:21:41] the message
[1:21:43] over
[1:21:47] uses
[1:21:49] sons
[1:21:51] mature sons going to become right. I
[1:21:56] believe on the earth
[1:22:03] today genuine
[1:22:07] corner ready.
[1:22:13] Listen to this
[1:22:15] prophecy. And the first
[1:22:17] time that there will come
[1:22:20] forth for the bride age for a
[1:22:23] resurrection out of darkness.
[1:22:26] resurrection. Listen to the
[1:22:28] prophecy will be a message that the
[1:22:33] full maturity of the
[1:22:36] word stand back in its full
[1:22:40] power and is being waved over the
[1:22:43] people by the same signs, same wonders
[1:22:48] he did back there. Oh, praise God. You
[1:22:52] love him. You may be seated. I want to
[1:22:56] close off with
[1:22:57] this. This was spoken
[1:23:01] by brother Coleman
[1:23:03] the 20th of
[1:23:05] June we received 2004
[1:23:08] for a message Elohim returning the
[1:23:10] power in this time of life. He was
[1:23:14] saying it takes a live
[1:23:17] voice brotherly kindness opens the door
[1:23:20] to charity.
[1:23:22] [Music]
[1:23:24] But you must live the word
[1:23:26] first. You must live with the word
[1:23:29] first. Now you know how to bind the
[1:23:32] devil because the elm
[1:23:35] revelation has exposed that religious
[1:23:38] spirit. The religious spirit will tell
[1:23:42] you what they did to you.
[1:23:46] I ain't do
[1:23:47] nothing. They have got to
[1:23:50] repent. That's a religious spirit.
[1:23:53] But you know better
[1:23:55] now you have got to do what?
[1:23:58] What they did to you? What that sister
[1:24:01] did to you?
[1:24:03] You forgive him.
[1:24:06] You forgive her.
[1:24:09] Otherwise, your heavenly
[1:24:11] father cannot forgive you.
[1:24:15] So therefore, you know how to bind the
[1:24:18] devil because he gets in
[1:24:21] here gets everybody
[1:24:25] hateful. So what does that
[1:24:27] do? That takes a
[1:24:29] debt. There we go. Listen
[1:24:32] carefully to know that you are
[1:24:34] [Music]
[1:24:36] right and the person is
[1:24:40] wrong and you forgive them
[1:24:44] anyway. That's a
[1:24:48] debt. You are
[1:24:51] right. They are
[1:24:53] wrong and you forgive
[1:24:56] them. That's a test.
[1:25:04] Now when you do that,
[1:25:07] you then
[1:25:09] understand what God wants you to do
[1:25:12] in Job 38.
[1:25:15] I hate
[1:25:17] myself and repent in dust and
[1:25:20] ashes. What is that? That's a horrenance
[1:25:24] of good self.
[1:25:29] not bad
[1:25:32] self because you're supposed to be a
[1:25:34] Christian.
[1:25:37] You're not even supposed to have a bad
[1:25:38] self.
[1:25:42] Now, Elohim
[1:25:44] revelation or Elohim
[1:25:47] inspiration is to let you know,
[1:25:51] who God is,
[1:25:53] who Satan is, and a secret
[1:25:59] revelation. How to get good self out of
[1:26:01] the way.
[1:26:05] I am not talking about bad self.
[1:26:09] I'm talking about
[1:26:11] you. You who pay your
[1:26:14] ti. You who
[1:26:16] shout. You who worship. I'm talking
[1:26:19] about you minister.
[1:26:22] You
[1:26:23] deacon.
[1:26:25] You
[1:26:27] elder, you song
[1:26:29] leader, you song
[1:26:31] man, you
[1:26:33] musician. I'm talking about you.
[1:26:36] I'm not talking about
[1:26:39] fornication. I'm not talking about
[1:26:41] adultery. I'm not talking about smoking.
[1:26:45] That's not even Christian.
[1:26:48] I'm talking about ministers,
[1:26:51] elders doing good
[1:26:53] deeds. You have got to
[1:26:56] die to good
[1:27:00] self. Oh glory. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:27:03] hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:27:07] God God is not interested
[1:27:11] in you parading around with good self.
[1:27:15] So you're a me own up like Jacob.
[1:27:18] I am Jacob. I'm no good.
[1:27:22] I need to wrestle with the angel.
[1:27:25] [Music]
[1:27:26] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:27:28] Glory to God. Hallelujah. So friends,
[1:27:31] I'm done.
[1:27:33] God hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are not
[1:27:37] shocked. You are
[1:27:39] seed. The life of the plant went through
[1:27:44] the
[1:27:45] stalk went through the
[1:27:47] shock up in the
[1:27:51] seed. All the life. There's no God up in
[1:27:55] you because you are that
[1:27:58] seed. You are going to
[1:28:00] die. May the Lord bless you.
[1:28:04] [Applause]
[1:28:12] Can we give a shout of praise this
[1:28:14] morning? Praise God.
[1:28:17] Amen. All you can give this morning.
[1:28:20] Thank you Jesus.
