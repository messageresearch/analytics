your hands we commit everything I would be said and done into your hands to Dean a precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says keep playing are you happy to be in a house of the Lord this morning so this morning we gonna do something a little different before we preach this morning you want to have a time of Prayer the strength of a church is prayer the strength of your walk with God is prayer so we want to take some time and praise I want to read a scripture then I want to read some prayer requests and some requests that we have we want to remember and also the services and the time up in me are over the next two days you want to take some time today to cry out to the Lord for that and after that we'll see what the Lord will do come and share would to encourage you on your journey I want to read from the Book of Jonah chapter 2 and read from verse 2 just to put this time of pray in context actually Jonah to and from this one then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of his of the fish's belly and said I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou hearest my voice for thou hast cast me into the deep in the midst of the Seas and the floods compassed me about all thy billows and thy waves passed over me and I said I am Castle to thy sight yet I will look again toward thy holy temple the waters can pass me about even to the soul that depth close me around about the weeds were wrapped about my head I went down to the bottoms of the mountains the the Twitter bars was about me for ever yet in the midst of all of that though has brought up my life from corruption o Lord my God when my soul fainted within me I remember the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into nine Holy Temple me the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word I just want to read some prayer requests you could begin to play something for prayer good morning since I'm asking for prayer for Frank Lord Oh a friend who lost his wife last Tuesday from cancer in our stomach please pray that God give him and his family strength and courage to that time of bereavement we have from sister Christine I would like to thank God for healing me and everyone for their prayer after the church prayed for me last week Wednesday I was able to walk the same night Amen [Applause] after I did the angiogram the doctor told me that two of my main arteries are blocked and my heart isn't getting enough oxygen and blood and they still believe my heart is only working 25% he said that there's nothing that they can do for me because there is no surgery or procedure that can help me I'm not considering the symptoms in my flesh and what the doctor said I'm claiming the promise that got me to me and by His stripes I'm healed I knew that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose so no matter what happens I have victory in Jesus in every situation like my brother job I know that the devil cannot touch me unless he gets permission from God though he slay me yet will I trust him through the pain and everything that I may go through I feel joy and peace when I think about job 34 where was now when I lead a foundation of the earth because I know I was there I am thanking God in advance for my healing all the blessing and victories in my life and all honor and

next two days that God will do exceedingly abundantly above what we could even ask for thing we are needy people this morning and the Bible tells us we have not because we ask not and God is waiting

Lord this morning a [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord amen you ready for the word this morning amen thank you but Anthony thank you musicians if you have your Bibles would you turn it me to three portions of scripture reading from Matthew chapter 5 verse 48 first Corinthians 13 and Ephesians 4:4 scripture readings this morning Matthew 5 and verse 48 be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect I drink from 1st Corinthians 13 reading from verse 1 first Corinthians 13 reading from this one though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal and though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I can remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing chap charity suffereth long and is kind a charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up that not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoice it not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never feel it but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but that part is temporary for when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away and our last reading from the book of Ephesians reading Ephesians 4 and reading from verse 11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all plural come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we hence bore henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carrier about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby the lay in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love meat alone and a blessing to the reading of his word can we pray Heavenly Father we thank you for the anointing that's in this place we thank you for the time of prayer that we have this morning we thank you for your grace for your love for your mercy your hand of protection we plead the blood on our home we plead the blood in our lives we thank you for the written word law that has captain been preserved through all the ages we thank you for the revealed word through your prophet messenger star in the right hand of God angel of Malachi for prophet William Branham who came to shed light on the written word as the revealed word that in that word you declare a rapturing faith is laying in there or protective rights and promises are laying in there what we have to access to leave this place is laying in there lomi you walk out the pages of the Bible this morning and speak to your children lift up Lord of feeble hands father take away the tiredness father may be in one mind and one accord because your prophet taught us if you could get into one mind and one Accord in five minutes there'd be not a feeble person in our midst father may we have that kind of a service that man can never design but your Holy Spirit could bring to pass may you speak lip to ear to your children this morning may you take me out of the way and maybe have a wonderful time in your presence today bless the reading of the word blessed a hearing of it in a precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says Amen and he may come and give the Lord a hand of praise Amen you may be seated this morning so I trust you are here to have a wonderful time in the wood have a wonderful time around the Lord the world is in the spirit of what they are in the spirit of the carnival and the festivities and the revelry and the bacchanal they are in their spirit this is this is their time this is their season here and the country this is what they look forward for they have been counting down to this they have been staying up at night going to parties for this time this is this is the world having their revival this is the world having their celebration they are celebrating what they don't know and Jesus said that they know not what they worship so they don't even know what they are worshipping but they are actually in worship because when you see the pictures their hands are lifted there they would seem that they are happy but they know not what they worship but we here this morning we know who we worship we know why we worship we have a reason to worship we understand that we are born to worship and worship has nothing to do with our tiredness or our feelings are our emotions our emotional always receiver so God doesn't value our emotions and emotions always cutting us in the trouble you may be seated it was Moses emotions when he was supposed to speak to the rock he got angry and his emotions got him to hit the rock our emotions have no place in the economy of God but when God looks at us he looks past our emotions and the promised word for our deed is what refreshes us and we can worship not because of what we expect from God but because He is God because worship worship worship is based on who God is it's not based on what he does it's based on the fact that he is God and God is the definition of worship so in this season the world they worship the music they worship the styles they worship the revelry they're worshiping but we also all worship a recent Lama we are worshiping a King of Kings we are worshiping a Lord of lords and we come to the house this morning to get reminded of the reason why we sing we come to the house of God to be reminded of the reason why we shout we come to the house of God this morning to be reminded of who we are in the economy of God we come to the house this morning to be reminded that our boss made a hit our daily task but God has a vision for our eyes that goes beyond what we do between 9:00 to 5:00 or it before or working on shift up that man's timing and God's timing are different that man's requirement and course requirement is different and one of these days the mortgage will be no more one of these days the rent will be no more one of these days the sickness has to be no more one of these days the problems will be no more one of these days that discomfort will be no more one of these days it was not real cranked up and I woke up and I warm up but we are always on fire because we know who we are and we know who's we are we know we belong to somebody we are God's property and he could do whatever he wants with us he can move us he could shape us he can mold us he could break us up he could take the pieces up and if he doesn't like what he sees he could crumple it together because he is the Potter and we are a clay and his job is a shaper shop until he is pleased and when he is well pleased he can say no I could put something inside of you nestlé's of Honor vessels that he could use and the church seamen can the church see hallelujah we ought to be so excited every once in our smile on their face I've seen some pictures of Carnival and I see not one sad face yet so don't bring your sad face up in here there's got to be the happiest place up that you can be this morning there are people in carnival with diabetes within and they forget that and they're jumping when they shouldn't be jumping because in the spirit of what will die they are in the spirit of atomic photo their destination is for the bombs to take care of but our destination is a place where God will exchange your pina gives you happiness he will exchange your old age and give you a new party even your tyranny somebody please flat to me this morning you may be seated this morning so I'm not here this morning to even preach you happy I'm not here this morning to make you feel good about yourself you are supposed to be feeling good about yourself all the time you shouldn't need a preacher to remind you of where you was because even drove on his a sheep corner to sit your where were you don't forget where you come from don't forget who raised you don't forget why I placed you on the earth where was now when a little foundations of the earth I'm the morning stars sang together hallelujah hallelujah somebody give God a soda breeze oh that's only 80 percenter somebody give God a shout of praise that's 82 percent somebody give the Lord a shout of praise that's 87 percent somebody give the Lord a shout of praise that's 91 percent of somebody I feel good when I can lift Jesus higher I love it when we can live Jesus higher I love it when we catch air the devil's Kingdom town and that's what we came to do this morning hallelujah oh we're gonna have a church on fire we're gonna have a people on fire

your responsibility to come on fire the son leader shouldn't have to encourage you and and work you up you ought to come already you ought to be ready you ought to be on fire you ought to be played up you should have read the Bible this morning you should have went to bed last night thinking about the people that know their God shall do great exploits there is no excuse there is no excuse there is no excuse you may be seated everybody feeling fine everybody feeling fine I heard a speaker say one time for every person who says they grew up in poverty I'll find someone else who also grew up in poverty and made it for every person who said my father didn't give me a long pants I'll find somebody else whose father didn't give them a long pants but there was a desire in their souls up to be somebody to do something that's why Jesus said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness because hunger and thirst is not a one thing hunger is that one hunger means you really have to get it first means you have to get it doesn't matter the cost so when you're hungry and you're thirsty for righteousness you are already blessed because that's a prerequisite to being filled so I don't know how you came this morning but I'm hungry and if you didn't come hungry you better get hungry because that's the only way that you're gonna get fill blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for this child somebody's his shot somebody's his child [Applause] give the Lord I have no praise you made me see them everybody feeling fine it's a real battle you know but it doesn't matter how much the lid of hell is opened and if hell had an evacuation plan and everybody's on the earth right now they are still no match for the seed in your soul because greater is He that's in you even without the Holy Ghost greater is He that's in you than he does in the world because a seed in you is Christ in Word form in seed form but it still has all the properties of what it will become that's why the Egyptians said kill the babies because even in beauty form it's a problem that's why God told Joshua kill their babies because when the pb's grow up they have the potential to become like their father and in you is a baby word see it doesn't have leaves yet but it's a seed that's now a fruit yet but it's a seed but in the right environment under the right anointed you can even help yourself every time you come to church you are water in the water you are water in the cedar even when you don't believe that seed is growing Sarah had doubts up but the seed that was planted when Elohim spoke her unbelief couldn't even stop it because the sea could only produce after its kind somebody say man Oh summers gonna go free this morning the devil cannot stop it your sickness cannot stop it your bills cannot stop it your problem cannot stop it your marriage problems cannot stop it what's going on on your job cannot stop it your mistakes cannot stop it your failures cannot stop it the car problem cannot stop it the host problem cannot stop it your roof could have wind last night that cannot stop it because your destination is eternal God is not measuring you on the natural things he's measuring you on the spiritual [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated so I have an encouragement for you a title this morning the journey to perfection the journey to perfection and I read three scriptures Matthew 5:48 Jesus says be therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect and he let that Skippy just hang there in an imperfect world among imperfect people because Peter wasn't perfect and James wasn't perfect and John wasn't perfect but Jesus in be therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect and a lot of people they read the scriptures and a lot of people even in the message here about his perfection thing and they say but but I'm human and I how could I ever be perfect and I and I make mistakes and there's no such thing as perfection but God requires perfection come the church say Amen so I want to speak about this journey of perfection because things were once perfect so this journey of perfection in sir take us back to what already was it is not as if perfection did not exist and we are trying to achieve what was never here before it was here before so whenever something has happened before it's actually going back to man is saying well we have now achieved this and we have now achieved this and and we're not talking about achieving one has not been achieved before we're talking about going back to what we already had because God is perfect can we accept that this morning God is perfect his plans are perfect his thinking is perfect there is no mistake in his thinking there is no mistake in his plans when he puts out something it's perfect but the balance said he cannot put out something and have to change his mind about it because when he put it out the first time it was already perfect so his foreknowledge is perfect and the Bible said who he foreknew he called so his calling is perfect and who he called he justified so his justification is perfect and who we justify he has already Gaurav hi it's already perfect so predestination is perfect there is no mistake with predestination he is not a hope in that it works out he's not there calling is fingers crossed a night I wonder if they're gonna make it I hope they're gonna make it I'm rooting for them to make it his predestination is perfect there has never been someone pretending for their purpose who did not make him because his predestination is perfect because his foreknowledge upon which he pieces his predestination is perfect somebody brings back to me you may be seated so what are you saying my Isaac you being here this morning is perfect [Applause] you couldn't be home try the Venona his plan came together for you to be here you had enough to put in your car to be here your situation had to walk out to be here because he is in perfect control [Applause] with God his control is always perfect so where your child is right now to you it might be a problem but he is in perfect control he may be seated so God exists in by himself he is perfect there's no mistake about him he is there but his be his perfection requires certain things and his perfection knows how to do certain things so he says let there be light and there was light and that light because he is perfect he can only create perfection so that light was perfect and he separated the darkness and he separated the sea and the water from the land and he made perfect animals and then there was no problems when he put the animals there when he put the sunday everything was in perfect harmony but about him creatures the animals were perfect what was in the sea was perfect that life was perfect and when God was finished he said it was good that word good in the Genesis is perfect because his definition of good can only be met is that relative to what we see is relative to his stature of perfection so on the first day perfect secondly perfect the deep perfect 40 perfect 50 and then God who is perfection because God is the world and the world is perfect God is spirit and the Spirit is perfect he said let us make man in our image and in our likeness and that manatee place on the earth was a perfect man when Adam walked out he was fit virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity because it was the attributes of the expression of God locked up in a man-made you may be seated in the image and likeness to things image likeness like his father talked like his father act like his father behaved like his father everybody feeling fine Adam could not have heard a message be therefore perfect that message couldn't apply to him because he was perfect Adam did not sin Adam didn't get sick what Adams said had to happen have to happen let me read something from you from the Prophet is that okay wonderful now it took God six thousand years it didn't take him that long with about music but he took that long meaning he didn't need to take that long he wants to take he's sick six thousand years because we are taught that one day in heaven is that the thousand years on it and it was six thousand years or 60 that God building it now it took God six thousand years to establish it planted with good seeds and to bring for everything after its kind everything must come for after its kind and I want you to just lock your seatbelts in and today you know tomorrow's no work right Jews there's no work so forget all of that today we in we don't have any places Troy your watch out trail arm oh yes we are in an eternity time and that those words really don't go together but you know what I mean all of his seeds were couldn't so it must bring forth after its kind and God took six thousand years finally when he got it all made and finally arrived with its headquarters or the earth on the earth it's beautiful spot laying in stuff even called a Garden of Eden God made the world headquarters in the Garden of Eden in Egypt right at the east end of the garden was air quarters and over the whole situation he put his son and his son's wife over all of it that's right that's what God did he put them in control they could speak to the winds and it would cease to blow they could spit to the tree and remove from here to there it sounds crazy to us now but he could speak to the trees and achieve itself move the lion and the wolf said together and the lamb laid down with them there was no evil it was perfect listen to it perfect peace perfect harmony everything in perfection and when God had it under his control he had all in operations God was satisfied I'm gonna Brandon went toward the top what even though let me read it some of young people never saw this good let me get it I think of me a blessed over but I'm but but I'm at but the banner millisiemens was done by the dinosaurs just walking around normal walking the wrong normal Raven everything was perfect perfect God had a perfect plan perfect situation so this perfection is speaking about this morning is not something we're trying to achieve that we've never had before it was already here so when we say go back to even with osteoma going back to perfection the marriage that Adam and Eve had was perfect perfect harmony it wasn't no discord it wasn't Adam coming home saying where do and Eve I'm saying backin it was imperfection Adam couldn't hear message husband love your wife because it was perfect love Adam come he had a message swag reverence your husband because it was a perfect marriage I don't did enough to hear message I've gotta go I'm free because in the cool of the evening he would spend time in fellowship because that's what prayer is prayer is fellowship with God prayer is communion regard prayers are conversation with God so every evening animals phone in fellowship and prayer in communication talking to God and good love to come down in the cool of evening to god that was perfection when he had that type of relationship so when we talk about going black to perfection I'm going back to the beginning and God dropping the seat he told Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect God has always been desiring that which was lost when Adam fell come the church say man since the time of Adam fall we have been on a journey to perfection and that's my title this morning from the time of Adam's fall we have banana journey to perfection because imperfection there's no sickness imperfection there's no old age imperfection there's no death imperfection there's no backbiting and no jealousy you know and Motiti animals get along together the lamb is lies on with the sheep and the Sheep lining with a lion and I'm I could walk imperfect how many can you trust a man and that's what we're looking for this morning and we are going to be perfect God to make sure we are puffing send a fivefold ministry God set in the church pastors apostles preachers teachers evangelists you know what it is for what for the perfecting of the seats because you want to see perfection and the church say Amen and Paul see right now we preach in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part is done away with so it meant that Paul was seen as even after Jesus came even after Jesus gives you right now where he's standing today we talking in part we prophesy in part Jesus had already come but he was still seeing in part because another work that was still continuing on this journey to perfection all along this journey God was fixing things around under Satan's eyes because he preached the message centers even the Surat sickness or quarter this evil age so God has been working behind the scenes away from the eyes of Satan confusing the devil every single time taking the most unlikely people and turning them into believers the most unlikely people and telling them enter preachers the most unlikely people on this journey to perfection because even was perfection he wanted to bring man to perfection you may be seated everybody with me everybody feeling fine I know something here anywhere perfection perfection you see but when you look at your own life some of us trying to be good some of us trying to be okie some of you think back about how you talk to your boss and some of us when we look at what we see with God requirement and where my best goal is not easy thing God doesn't want the best version of yourself I try my best corner actually try your best you know he demands perfection it's wonderful and I totally agree with his testimony I'm not what I used to be and I'm not what I'm supposed to be and some people use that as an excuse to justify foolish ism so because I'm improved you have to take my level of improvement so when we correct you say well I'm not what I used to be so this you're watching the improvement but God's requirement is still God doesn't want an improved version you know it's software and an unfallen says which on one version to version 3 version for god the 1d version number as you add to them he wants perfection there are a lot of people improving in the message they get them better they'd be even better but that is not what God is requiring he's not requiring a better behavior he's requiring a perfect behavior but I'm talking about faith and perfect fit I talked about perfect fit being peace in your position so over your journey your journey is to your position only when you get there could you say I'm standing perfect perfect standing and then a perfect seat can the church say Amen everybody but everybody feeling fine you see some of us we try to offer God our best and that's what he ended kidding offer a half-hearted thing you know he bought the best that he had but it was perfect because email brought what at that time he was a perfect revelation of the perfect sacrifice can the church salmon so and even brought the lamb and cut destroyed quartered blessed because he brought something simple it wasn't the best that he had but it was a perfect revelation of the perfect sacrifice and Gordon was perfect demands perfection somebody preached back to me can brought the best fruits anywhere I'll pick the best mango and the best banana and the best you enjoy and pick the best flowers he didn't bring second and eating or the second best thing he brought the best but he have no revelation I'm caught said to him he what your brother has a perfect revelation if you do what your brother do you will get the same kind of blessing the same anointing same inspiration same unction same mercy but what was him his hat was not a perfect seed in the first place because the Bible said he was of his father the devil so even in that condition he could not have received what a man had which was a perfect revelation cannot say man is everybody with me this morning I'll give you a secret you know but Abraham said the mind is the battleground but you know the devil already carries in your mind your heart because only the wood is the design of the toss of it oh come on somebody please back to me somebody please back to me so some of us be given too much credit to the devil because that's why under the Seventh Seal is silence because he said if the devil only hear what this thing is he could do great damage it takes us opening up to allow they're technically devil Terezin that's why the Bible said God AHA do you could protect your heart never car get dong in there you can't discern your torch he can't easily your intense only what you open up to him he could have access to but if you close him off this morning and shut out reasoning shut out doubt shut your pass out every window that the devil tries to get in you cut it off then the devil has no room to play in your mind he can't even get into your heart because your spiritual woman sealed up by a perfect wood by a perfect revelation by a perfect understand understanding can the church say man everybody feeling fine so we are on this journey of perfection so it had to start right there with Adam because Adam lost this place of perfection his position was one that was perfect and he fell from that perfection to a world of sickness to a world of discomfort to a world of pain to a world of sadness to a world of different situations it was not God's original intent for man to be in that way but God had attributes that he had to Express and we know that so forgot to express it man had to fall so he could express the actions that he had but because God is perfectly out of a perfect way of escape and a perfect plan of redemption that man knew if he could just get connected to that perfect way back to fellowship he could have access to a place for perfection once again come on somebody please back to me [Applause] and so that is not impossible to us as time progresses God has to unveil himself in pieces and right there on the earth we have Noah and we have Enoch but I Brandon said they were only at the same time and we know about Enoch what Aaron said ëno build the pyramids so Enoch had to had half court a revelation of perfection because he caught something that please God so much that God didn't even law allow him today he caught a secret he caught a revelation of this perfection and better balancing like this he's the one who build the pyramids so he left a sign of the secret to us that if we see this thing this this this structure this image that that there is the key to perfection the key to live in him and when the brother came and said this being when he is complete is the peanut mix into the rapture so God left his clues on this journey for us to pick up these clues and these pieces so that we would not be discouraged but we will be encouraged can the church say man we are on a journey this morning by the currents back to perfect fellowship with God before we leave this place we have to be perfect because but a Branham said only perfection can end up over there only perfect love could be there so before we leave this place we have to be perfect now what happens if a man in his house is perfect before you say it means his marriage will be perfect enough probably speaks in surely will be perfect in them if the cheering in the church end up in perfection what kind of houses will we have somebody preach back to me and the more you add the virtues is a nearer to perfection you become because this being one is completed on this journey it's a claim to perfection walking up seven steps to perfection isn't it right we know the song so when Adam fell he was actually walking down seven steps he reverse the trajectory so we are now commanded in this day to walk back up those steps walk back up the seven steps to charity to perfection to adoption to manifestation to God saying here is my spirit fluent freely notice not walking seven steps to church walking seven steps to the message we're walking seven steps to perfection can the church amen hallelujah somebody give the Lord a shout of praise we have to know our message we have to know the expected outcome we have to know what God requires from us so Enoch was there Enid had a testimony to please God I'm buddy but I'm dropped a mystery said Enoch and Noah at the same time we preach going into the Ark of safety but better Brennan brought out and that's perfect to preach but he said when Noah and Enoch were there to seem them and Enoch left he was raptured so he said that if Enoch was the one that was raptured and nor was the remnant and there are many who will be here who will have been in the message who would have known the truth and will find themselves in the tribulation but the bright elect the ones that come to perfection will be the one that create the resurrection and the one that make it to the rapture can the church say Amen from the message God's provide a place of worship remember when God speaks a word he can never take it back he has to really mean the same he can never see something I didn't say what I didn't exactly mean that so if he says he's gonna heal you he can't take it back you have to be healed and if he says I'm gonna judge somebody he can't even take it back because judgment is pronounced God can't take back his would can the church say man he knows the best to begin with we say things whatever Adam said that we think is the best then after I we take it back and we find we could I say it better we had a one shiny improvement away I didn't really mean it so sorry sorry about Jose the first time what Iranian meant to see was the food wasn't decent not good and then when you finish I have to say I didn't mean it I mean there's room for improvement and we tried to find ways to improve on the fact that the food wasn't good you know the piece could take a little work leather covered up and say well it have different ways to do fees your particular approach is not the approach and I'm used to people have different tastes from some people like coke and this is all an attempt for you to try to find a better way we are the ones who improve we are the ones who try to find and we always find ourselves in these situations trying to do things better but God is perfect there is no room for improvement all this perfect kind of church say Amen he knows the best typically we don't know the best to begin with we come into Christ coming to fellowship and we start to learn the word the word is preached to us and it opens our understanding to things we never understood things we never knew and then when you look back and say poet I already didn't know angel and it takes great wisdom to reach a point no to anything but the word in you is perfect that's why but I practice it a word is in the bride he's not measuring you based on knowledge because do you have all knowledge do you know all mysteries he's talking about the word seed in you because that's the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory in this temporal condition you can never come to a complete understanding of God his thoughts are higher than our tosses Ouisa higher than always if you can measure the distance between the heavens and the earth they say that the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways but grant you grace and mercy says those things are revealed belong to us and to our children the secret things belong to God but to His Messenger he allow us to get access to the mind of God and see things pertaining us and it's only by his grace we can get a revelation knowledge you could get from reading books but revelation you don't need a book to get revelation you can get revelation this morning because he is a God who can reveal and he is a revealer of the hidden things of God concerning you as an individual not just within the church but as an individual what God is calling you to to what God is calling you to achieve what God is calling you to become as we have formed into the word image can the church say man oh I feel religious this morning I feel excited this morning the devil doesn't know who I am he doesn't know my potential he doesn't know what I'm going to become kind of church hey man so God knows the best to begin with we try different jobs we try different careers we try what comes to us and say we'll give it a try with God there's no court giving it nothing oh try say give you a mighty man of Valor he wasn't trying he already by for knowledge so that victory already won he is calling his rewinding tapes and calling people this morning [Music] let me set up one more time you know trying because you don't know the future but God who knows the future rewinding tape and Sikkim God rewinding tipsy not even talking about everyone anything because his predestination is based on foreknowledge he's not powerful God knew all who were coming to the message he knew everyone who had come and he could Romney teams don't see who would make it and sell say all right but as he because not everybody's with us if Judas was given power you know and Jesus was also predestined to achieve his purpose in the perfect plan of God so the professional time Atacama test everybody think me impressed I'm talking about bright predestination that you cannot miss it you cannot fail you shall receive the Holy Ghost it is because God fast forward the tip of your lives and so when you cut the Holy Ghost he can rewind the tape from the moment you were born and send an angel over your life it is because he fast power the tape and saw your adoption he could dispatch an angel from the moon you were born is because God said flash forward the tape and see all your mistakes and still see when you are restored how do you rewind the tape and say I'm calling you you are gonna make it can the church Shaymin and we are here together joining this journey to perfection to knee to perfection we are all on this journey because perfection is the key to the bring on the resurrection deal without us cannot be made perfect so brother branham is waiting for this junior perfection to be complete so that he can be raised from the dead David is waiting on his journey of perfection to come to completion for somebody to cross this finish line for perfection because as we cross this finish line of perfection tell me a power put into the church that will bring on the resurrection somebody preached back to me perfect worship perfect bread perfect revelation perfect understanding perfect standing puppet state listen you can't be in professional until at the same time you have to have left sin somewhere along the journey on this way to perfection because of course where you get the perfection is the more you are Christ begins to look the same because with the problem said the reflection will be the perfection you don't hear me this morning [Applause] you may be seated I hope somebody gets this every day you're getting closer on this journey and you are under journey whether you act or not to know from the moment you are born you on a journey try to stop time now you know what time I had examined I was wishing the exam good like like like like it s pause a city wishing I just wish you could s pause just hit the pause button and just pause everything timeout stop it I want to get off this but no matter what Johnny is on the movement is on he comes he starts the enzyme it's a new D we were just talking about 2019 come in 2019 come in 2019 is here no in March the journey is happening what have you achieved for this year what have you achieved what progress have you made on this journey to perfection what have you accomplished in your prayer life on this journey to perfection how high have you climbed on this seven steps back to perfection have you crying have you made any move or are you still in the same squats are you content to see other people climbing around you and you are not moving anywhere because time is not stopping it's about to run out so it's a countdown to perfection it's a countdown to the finish on this journey to perfection the journey of life we shall not all taste death we shall not all sleep but as journey is bringing us closer to that spot where either God says our work has done and our time is up and we join those who will wait on perfection who will be raised up for those who will be the perfection that will raise the other is a kind of church say Amen just rip it self because corn is perfect so end quote set the parsing the perfect listen well he still imperfect because he doesn't make mistakes I will speak for itself and the fruits have to be his roots the site but be his size if when it's finished and at the end of a journey you see the fruit looking crumpled up and he leaves like a winner they need to wonder who Academy speak the truth this morning because by their fruits you will know who everybody is to them you know things mean nothing right everybody everybody [Music] listen Hansen but the measure is not on homicide Melissa honey message perfection and perfection is beyond what I could see has nothing to do with what we see here it's but quarter see how close are you to that perfection are you at in your life do you have the right attitude towards God right I teach you towards his house right I teach you towards you would and I write because because you're right mental attitude towards every divine promise of God is what brings it the pass now it is right and also much you know some tradition as a very disrespectful country and if you imagine you wish someone was operational naturally who he think he is telling me laughter I'm ticketing court not taking maximum you didn't ask me my ambitions you didn't know what I want to do what they wanna be come on what I want to achieve I wanna you think God asking you that well Adam look at Evy say you are flesh of my flesh you are born of my born life of my life when one looks at his bride she must be a perfect reflection she copy well and I saw what my husband's seeing a bowler said but I think it should be no it has to be this is what this is what is holy appearance because it to become one if Eve had a perfect revelation of her husband Adam Abid home Sheila tell the devil come back later but because he was the byproduct and God never spoke directly to evil or God spoke to Adam it was Adams responsibility to tell Eve how to conduct herself how to behave herself god never told Eve only tree in a city garden that was a to Adam Adam was posted at his time and break that down and clarify doesn't make it clear to Eve so I don't have Adam didn't finish the whole message to Eve but when the devil came and saw the weakness he said what God said because he never was imparted in meeting either he devil and all didn't know this whatever looking for opening if it was Adam Adam knew better I'm gonna balance said if Eve had steered behind the word never would have had no room and when you get in trouble you know why it's because he get out from behind the wood you are loved your own ideas you owning your own ambitions so the devil start to play on ambition alone if you take this suit you'll be just like good having knowledge having wisdom knowing right from wrong and you get caught up in that and we live in this easy people having itching ears you want to know this you want to note that and and we are trying to find the mind of Christ on every situation because the perfect God has a perfect answer to every situation getting back to perfection it means perfect order perfect Church order perfect harmony there is more up your outside of perfection you can have your idea it has to because perfect idea we make decisions and many of us become better madam said listen if you want to get married go to prayer gave you Holy Ghost because God has a thought on these things he has a thought on every matter but because we walk in imperfection we end up in problem because we walk away from the perfect will of God because we need an overall understanding when he personally not only all understanding but if God is a God of perfection and he by design structured things in a certain way to guide us to perfection that's why this church order that's why we supposed to be in church that's why we supposed to be prayed up that's the order he himself lit out and he passed away of perfection and he kept dropping the message Abraham walk before me and be perfect when Jesus himself came he said be therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect he dropped a promise on all of them and the Ministry of the five-fold is temporary because it until we all come into the unit's kept defeat until we reach perfection it's for the perfecting of the scenes so when the seeds are perfect the five-point ministries work is complete when we are all in the unity of the faith the minister the file is complete when we are all in a measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that ministry is complete you've ever seen it so the focus is nothing who is the faithful and that - the focus the focus is the perfection because God is looking for perfect bride you may be seated many of us we focus on activity and not productivity pastor said explain you know what some jobs and I'm calling anybody because I thought you have people doing things doing things that do anything do anything and we finna work hard and it's real activity but no productivity they're not added any value whole day your movie paper here back here you move it here move it here we were here to switch things up put it back here recording he moving it he moving into relativity you sweatin like I saw somebody recently a video somebody shoveling sand and they trying to throw it into a wheelbarrow meanwhile there's somebody else who do understand what's happening taken out on this wheelbarrow that he threw in in to try miss next pile I'm dead clearly didn't communicate and they never watch one another so as each row interview bury the other one taking all the wheelbarrow on to someone else you tell them guys all the a Wigner we say what can really only I take him out to do tomorrow and put them in here and say I taking it from here put them in a wheelbarrow activity and no productivity because at the end of the day you cannot equal the activity to a result not the result that gordon chism is not complicated for all these years since Adam fell you want relationship are you looking for a wife the bottom line for goes looking for a villain and this wife's will be making a cell ready a perfect Lord a perfect groom a perfect corner perfecting has been waiting all these years for perfect brain so every prophet every preacher every judge every cheap church leader from Genesis to know has been preparing and putting messages and love letters and trying to chance for the thoughts of God so that this bride could be making us ever ready by being formed with a wood image so she can measure up as a perfect pray for a perfect husband with perfect works perfect manifestation because there's a platter when Jesus read his personal orders upon me and when he left other party week later the day of judgment and these things in there it was not for him to fulfill it was for this wife of his who would be just like him who would have a perfect understanding and a perfect revelation and have a perfect approach because you know human Instagram you can never have a perfect approach and I two weeks ago I spoke about a woman I knew well I said if it was one of us I mean woman anywhere it might not have gone the same way go friend your husband and you say I have none I say well yeah yeah yeah I've known it's for a nice fight anyone anyway I even order not me today but whoever Jesus handled it did something in her soul that you realize deliverance had come my way some of us but yet is the grace of God that delivered us along the way some of us has wall other people - Oh a measuring rod which is not perfection and Oh a measuring rod or what experience somebody said to me recently well I lose because of how I came three messages speaking about themselves how what the experience was it looking at in a certain way you express it you experience I want to measure against you would experience and God call people from all kinds of walks of life and some to dewater some to refer some to great trials but all so because you went too far you have a problem and somebody you're going to flood they supposed to go through what I went through who say so I told this once we all go to the blood once we all go if likewise require me because once you go to the blood when God looks truly blood he sees perfection because it's by His perfect blood we could be perfect or somebody preached back to me I pray this help somebody I don't want to be too much longer with you but I'm enjoying this I don't know about you but I'm enjoying what I love talking about Jesus and I love to put a wave back to it back to fellowship the way back to retention the way back to how we are supposed to be in God in perfect order perfect harmony perfect worship can the church say men and through God's grace he made a way for us that broke us from the law and away from legalism can the church say Amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh hallelujah in Galatians 3:13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law the law was hard on him it was almost a curse upon mankind no one can be pure enough nicey law no one could it not be curly law seed how supposed to be here but people couldn't meet the measurement of the law nobody was holy enough to obey the entire law come on now let's get down to the issue you know your struggles you know your challenges you know your child's and if you look at it from a legal perspective you know you're not measuring up from a law perspective the law held men in bondage and showed every imperfection that manhunt but the blood of Jesus came to free us from this curse of sin death and the law with the law there was never a way of completion there was never a way it had to be repeated so every year you have to get a Salaam it was a permanent rehash regurgitation a redoing of the thing because the law was a temporary thing today's a lamb tomorrow's a dog next week is a goat there's a bull you're doing something else to try to make up it never stopped constantly trying to cover your sin cover your problem cover your situation and the priest would enter the Holy of Holies once a year every year the sprinkled blood on the mercy seat of the Ark of the Covenant to atone for the sins of the nation of Israel but when Jesus came it was not the law it was the perfect sacrifice evil started by revelation what was a temporary situation but when Jesus came to make a way to perfection he give us a perfect sacrifice can the church Shaymin that we don't have to be going back to do some act to access the Holy of Holies that when Jesus died of Eros ran from top to bottom to give sons and daughters access to perfection access to the Holies of Holies access to Christ himself he was the perfect atonement and that would perfect atonement is inside of us right now and the church came in and that's why we're gonna make it that's why we're gonna overcome that's why we're gonna receive the Holy Ghost that's why we're gonna be delivered that's why the virtues will live in us and the church amen and that ever cannot do anything about it hallelujah I'm not gonna be too much longer so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect son of God and I really want to nail this time because a lot of people who believe that without follow any message and I trying to live right and I'm doing my best and I'm doing water service and and that is not perfection so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect Word of God which is the waters of separation and washes us from our sins that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody would the would have God bleedin blood to wash the bride in she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place that some things that ought to be kind of a man surely and gossip about a piece of wood but about him said if God expects people to be perfect as Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect there must be some preparation somewhere in question and answers in 64 but Abraham said Paul said though I speak with tongues of men and angels and do I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice do I understand all the misuse of the wood do I give all my goods to the poor and all this thing and have not charity answer nothing I have feared that I can move mountains and so forth I'm still nothing then he said that which is in part will be done away with when that which is perfect is come or when that which is perfect is made known can the church say Amen so he said I went out with the public his comments also when that spoofing is made known and we know to the world I went Luther him he shone a light on the written word and when Wesley came he shot a brighter light on the written word and when Malachi spoke him he brought the full light on the written word and brought in as a full message of a perfect word of all the word that was required for us in this day to tie up all the loose ends for all it from Genesis to Revelation so that a perfect wood cedar could be planted through us that we don't come and preach our own interpretation of our own ideas of our own dreams our own vision but the Word of God that essentially is His Prophet to bring a wife to Isaac and to salmon so because we have a perfect word and we have every shield all of the seeds are open and every mystery is not reveal know we could have perfection so let us go up to perfection can the church but events have God's will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development how highly God has commanded these scenes of the Dark Ages kind of church say man everybody feeling fine in God provided peace of worship the church will come to justification to looter through scientific Asian true Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the Son of man that when a husband and a wife will be the same self persons God will be so manifested into his bride his church did they will be brought to seem they are one now you see where we are come the church say man so how could God forgive someone and give mercy to someone and you don't do the same you see it takes an experience for you to come to perfection to think the way he does and forgive the way he forgives that's why you can't judge anybody because you don't know God's mind on the matter you don't know courts thoughts on the situation you have to strive to put your thoughts on the subjects on your reasoning your affection your interpretation and allo God to deal with your life and you keep climbing seven steps to perfection can the church say man I hope this help somebody today that is not just coming to church it's not just a sure it's not just trying to be religious because they're religious spirits in on Sunday the kap-40 miss church because this religious bird our religious we will find himself in charge they're not gonna be playing Mass on Monday and Tuesday the religious spirit have to be in church realize a religious spirit but he related we're not looking for perfection the religious spirit just feeding on being in church is a spirit quick and anointed shaking everything but this religious spirit but what is Hannah talk about let us get to perfection because perfection no means your behaviors gone it means perfect character perfect behavior it means forgiven for crisis and God will send situations to make sure that presses the crack the development we don't everything geez have to learn obedience by the things he suffered and God brings innovations to you to fulfill that diode die out until there's nothing else to die out I said when they are dead money said dead man cancer back and it that money because give you you can say about listen you is no good your cook you can't do anything I think after while you're there take me take me there you see somebody go Percy listen listen listen cook yeah idiot because listen you know where you come from you know and there but those people can push in you and you behave yourself your behavior savvy be and then God knows what button to push your heart wasn't even as I say the hot button and when you're hot button get push people who say I overcome tempo intake because you can overcome temper ahead of it but real temper and return presenting and then because but Abraham said even it never let me tell test them with you what is your hot button no tell me what is your husband because Donna said Diana is only when he is dead you have no hot button so if you have our hot button this morning you know you know people see it not much as a bottom you know what I think that's suit me Jack is what after day I read a story of a lady one time came to her past sunset pasta I have to leave the church he said what what happened is a car take the hypocrisy the hypocrisy and he passed adizero hot but now he said here's what to do no problem I wanted to get a cup of water philately brim you say when I look around I see no can't he said okay good good good fill a cup of water to be Britain and I wanted a walk around each other with it so she fairly cup to the brim and you walk her into it when she come back to the office you say how much hypocrisy see she said I see not nothing because I just so focus on this glass of water that I even get to look up and see anything unless you realize that she was even looking at herself she wasn't looking at you would just spending time with everybody else oh the world public gospel it's the fame and plenty people come with her under the hot buttons some will have 20 unbuttoned somebody have 10,000 hot button but by the time you reach perfection the hot button supposed to be gone similarly a hot button is e.length the service sooo in service you're sitting time hug button start to get a warm if there is hot yet to them so they get warm and as the minutes pass but a clock is that they get hotter and hotter and hotter some hot buttons attack for service they find were to worship you this morning again hot right now somebody hot buttons defined by the antenna suppose in preaching and ice all your own understanding but God had us to speak about hot buttons this morning if we put them at tea something real hot button go on 110 boom hot button why we have a tip why he ministers than preaching some people hot button is where is silicon church only do no time I see we in the house this morning the assistant pastor in the house this morning I had a meteor assembly officers and I say when I knew usher comes it copied after lonely the seating arrangement at existing each it it has to be a girl can lead people to usher people where it's supposed to be led by the spirit you don't know who quad want to put you next to that you can any Holy Ghost some people hot-button listing they have troubled appetites anything is when God gave him a small salary Depina - no but I see sorry grody button similar hot buttons who do officers are in a church and we have fighting up with these things when this was going on to perfection are we here this morning you know some people kind of falling asleep without buttoning people rather hope and I do call the hot button you see it takes maturity to allow the wood to have an effect on our lives and that's a challenge after all these years in the message our behavior has to change because perfection is really about our behavior that's really what it is and God will find ways to test all of us all of us so you don't think I deserve my tests and trying to do timber over a versus a child and I use this some time ago I was preaching about overcoming and I said the Prophet under his experience through his trials came to the point he won to the comment suicide and if it wasn't for God jamming the guns is the jewel it would have been a different story today but God's purpose was beyond his own desire and his low point so we all have our low points we all have our up points we all have our victory and some of us everybody know we're in victory everybody knowing makes you anyway no engine you're shouting it jump in and when you're not ready nothing victory it is quietly is slipping it is slipping the church yes hi didn't buy them press him and your hot button is enough honest enough to say listen I'm in trouble and I need prayer because the whole point of coming to fellowship is to get strength from one another that bad is it encourage one another provoke one another confess your faults to one another or a descriptive went back to the Bible and back to the Bible is the journey to perfection there is no perfection outside no fulfillment of all the world even what we don't understand because my personal understanding is based on living what the Word says some of us our desires are corrupt and the devil is a great job of defining what our desires are and what our expectation of how God deals with situation even the Prophet that difference into every situations and healings one said Chico be sure than to identify what we say jump on a pulsar who is it tidy head with this and all kind of different things there's the one way one size with all this ultra deep blood and God we have to trust God that he gives us the wisdom to deal with the situations through perfection where there's all away and it's a perfect way and that's what we are striving for that way of perfection can the church say Amen so what do you preach them when you pick up a perfect you speaking about 11 feet I live in which you live in knowledge I live in temperance a little patience live in coldness a little crumbly kindness and charity itself to seal the whole thing so every step you make up and you go climb higher you getting closer that's like what a journey to perfection and we sing the song walking up seven steps to perfection receive the fullness of the Holy Ghost and people forget these some of the signature songs and recognizing it they miss any mark of what this thing is and as you go higher in these steps you're dying all to yourself but appearances you could have your own patients but the patient's of course the different regions you just naturally patient you there you just patient you supposed to be insurance for timber you patient you patiently waitin to get ready he did love me pp envisioned nine o'clock ten o'clock is still home your patient thanks boys visions some of our button is communication time I didn't write all you listen this wasn't my note sir in fact it really was going to hit this to cut buttoning here all right I have no list so I just say no need to put on my heart to see but are the energy they are know one thing that when we die out there should be no hot buttons Godman with the press and get no response no response no response no response no response and then when you can do that and then say fit and fit to respond virtue virtue good response come on somebody push back to me that being when he is complete is the pain that makes the rapture the reasonable coordinates you know in the school system if your door pass a certain green didn't make it repeat thanks of course is a visible because God has no grandchildren he has no shortcuts every son that comment to God must be tried so the pasta the LED country trust eater every man must be tried proven because power is coming and character must be there so the Prophet taught he could turn your wife against you he could turn your neighbors against you he could turn the church against you let's see how you will behave if you will have perfect poor fake love know how to put because some of us listen you made me see that I want that man telling us forgive who we want to forgive him we talk about forgiveness and may people it easy to forgive if if if but Anthony gave me upset but I think I have good friends I forgive him it easy to forgive him could I'm a friend but somebody's not number friend if it's my nature and this would give listing and when he would say forgiveness I forgive my brother 70 times Levin but that one that's what needs to die because he'll like me I forgive him a with a grudge and forgiving that's why he backed over for different for Christ's sake that dies where it goes beyond your sake so I really go along to inside our house that our lives and I think I finished which you know it's not a conversation I like having a conversation like Jesus we just talk to the people because at the end of the day we have to reflect Jesus not our version of Jesus or the things about Jesus that we identify with but all of him they beat him and he said not a word Jesus responded he could have brought them guys out of existence because he was God in flesh but he was not a word because he saw his purpose and his purpose was a perfect purpose so he walked in perfection perfectly as a perfect lamb to Calvary he could have called angels he said it he could have called the angels and they would have come because he was the perfect lamb he was God and flesh but his purpose of perfection and what he was God he came to redeem was more important than vengeance or revenge or dealing with the people around him he had a perfect purpose I hope this helps somebody this morning know before you can lead you have to follow you kind of leave until you follow so we have sisters who saying I want Jesus and Jesus requires certain behavior from us and God give us husband's the test the images dry people trying to cover up the hot buttons they say if you only know your husband you wouldn't talk like this but it is to test us how could you submit to Christ and God say wives reverence your husband and that reverence is as your Lord Sarah called Abraham Lord I always joke about my wife call me Lord just smile seesee lit no back to anybody but I didn't say I read in Scripture no he had a quality scripture but how is our conduct because understand this and I said this in a service indigo Martin awhile ago and see if your neighbors don't know you're Christian there's something wrong with your testimony if your friends in school don't know you are Christian is something wrong with your testimony because the Bible said they took North that had been with Jesus oh there was evidence in their lives that they were like Jesus and if the reflection is the perfection omission people see you there must see Christ you must do one nervous cry so it's like up is like parts of crisis in parts of Christ where the mother part is a trough it has to be really nice to be authentic and you have to know where you are in this journey towards God in this journey towards perfection and then cry to God and go and help me show me I want to change I want to do it I want to I want to spend the time I wanna pray I wanna cry on the sacrifice help me give me I'll give me something we're looking for reality not semantics not just knowledge about the reality not knowledge and no if I have all knowledge and all mystery and I could prophesy they give more to be put and have not charity I am nothing god help us this morning I'm trying to find a place to close out here hallelujah the church will come to justification to loser to scientific Asian to esli to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostals and go right on into perfection of the son of man not a new church so this is our church it's one body it's one church it's one people it's one bride so there's no division with Isis man ministry and who you believe and who and who group and gonna talk in that talk that's man foolishness who you identified with I don't wanna bareback with nobody I want Christ when in fact with me because I would say T is my spirit flowing freely that's what God is looking for Minds identification is nothing because man will fail prophecies work me but charity and he is charity never fail [Applause] and that's what I'm looking for for cherry to have a perfect work in our lives come the church seamen in the message who is just majestic where the balance of the stages of the eternal purpose he had in his secret has now been revealed now we read the scripture where the Branham said door we know impact and prophesy imply but when that isn't perfect is coming babe and I took that and said when that which is perfect is made known so perfect is come is also perfect made known as a reveal to us so he said here in 65 and who is just my Keshi that the stages of the eternal purpose he had in his secret has now been revealed that he has three stages of perfection so perfectionism in known to us through three stages just like he redeems the world the same way he redeems his church he redeems two people in three stages now look first is justification like muta preached second sanctification like where is he preached the baptism of the holy ghost that's right then come to rapture now most people come to the SIF occasion most people walking on sand indication or have phone away is true whatever means through the washing of the world or true discipline or whatever it is they are living a sanctified life just as they did under under Wesley but God's great purpose was to put the Holy Ghost in us that he takes residence in the control tower that we actually have to give up control we have to lose control that he is in control that he know the wreck that we speak when he wants us to speak we call where he wants us to go we act the way he wants a snack can the church team and we can't wait to be the house of God because the control tower could only drive us to the word could he drive a simple feel the word could only drive us to manifest the word because the Holy Ghost is in the control tower hallelujah but the Branham emergently Force 1965 God is ready if he isn't doing it now he is going to call a church to perfection by his word Jesus Christ the musician get ready I'm almost finished now listen if God is calling his church to perfection by his word do you understand now why it's so important to make sure what is said in the pulpit is on the word that you have your home Paul give the early church homework he said follow me as I follow Christ and he gave them homework so hold me accountable as I follow Christ so only follow me as I follow Christ we have too much blind followers in the message people have put all the work on the pasta when Paul never did that he said follow me as I follow Christ so if you see me not following Christ run for your life pass the silly ones I built if you go somewhere else there is you only place it has no other place this is the one please people take the quote but abarim said they'll be chosen should his Brides by churches price and it must be worn as it is the one church that's not what I was talking about miss appropriate all kind of coats it's one body it's one bride it's a international bride people call from all kinds but a better even would interdenominational God is doing the calling he is sovereign some of us give us the permission we tell God no no no don't choose him don't choose who are she coming because suddenly we know how he cut his maid I thought easy cutter but his sovereign grace and mercy could call anybody he wants he can call the prostitute he could call the criminal he can call the Evangelist he's with anybody and put them into position put them into shape as the Potter cut what he doesn't want and what you see the masterpiece that the Potter pull the sin out of your life pull the evil out of your life if you give him the permission you call the enemy out of your life if you are lying I stand at the door knock If any man hope Oh hallelujah daven knew he can do it himself he said creates and me a clean heart O God renew a right spirit in me I can't renew myself but I know who can renew me so creating me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me has been away from my presence O Lord take not thy Holy Spirit from me can the church say Amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now listen when in our last quote notice here the light that was in the husk in this talk and the tassel in the husk all carries in the sea hallelujah and the light I was in his talk went one went to make the other justification made aware for scientific ation Sandinista made away for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself that's the person of Jesus Christ the perfect God hallelujah not a measure but the Holy Ghost itself to come right down into perfection back to the word again to manifest itself Oh hallelujah what a joy to know that this is the season that we're in it couldn't happen in Luther's day it could not believe Wesley's day it couldn't happen in the Pentecostal state it couldn't even have remember the brand was here because he was a voice of this time pointing to the Sun pointed out Messiah is on the earth right now he said the same Holy Spirit was with the Lutheran's that sanctify the Wesleyan that baptized the penny causes is now setting in order for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that's a simile we said a manifestation of the Holy Ghost is that angel trying to gather people back to the word back to a perfect word back to perfection because once you get back to a perfect word it can only produce perfection and the church say man Oh hallelujah how many one a perfect Church where the passage is looking a perfect chiller to do that sin cannot stay in that church don't cannot stay in that church that's how they were in the Upper Room there was no doubt there was no unbelief they were in one mind they were in one Accord they had one expectation everything was in order everything was in the position and then all of a sudden nickimja song from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and fill the whole house and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost that's my expectation that should be your expectation that's my expectation for this two meetings this weekend are we gonna have any young people and decay labs on that Monday night and as the minister gets into the pulpit we could be in one minor one recorder and the Holy Ghost will drop down and fill everyone up with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire this is the season for it this is the hour peretta this is the time for it Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah give the Lord a shout of praise give the Lord worship give the Lord a shout out praising Santo feet I'm finished this journey to perfection we are seeing a finish line it's coming into view the
