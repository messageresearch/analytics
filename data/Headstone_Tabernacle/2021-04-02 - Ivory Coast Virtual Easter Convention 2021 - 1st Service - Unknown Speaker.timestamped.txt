[13:52] he knew his position
[13:55] he knew that he was born in this world

[48:56] the manifestation of the sons of god is

[49:12] cedar is hosted by our precious
[49:16] brother on enchika in ivory coast

[49:32] hallelujah and nothing can hold us

[49:40] and i have a for a short greeting
[49:44] a title come with me to a glorious
[49:47] eternity we all want
[49:52] such a breakthrough we all want that
[49:56] heaven opens is it true
[50:00] we once said jesus christ becomes such a
[50:03] reality
[50:05] said we have no other thought anymore
[50:07] just him
[50:09] and what he brings this is what we want
[50:13] and uh when we know the devil
[50:17] by his tricks how he can
[50:21] try to stop this
[50:24] to stop this when we know it then we can
[50:28] act upon
[50:29] what we know to defeat him
[50:34] so we break the curtains
[50:37] of unbelief now how
[50:41] can we get unbelievable this wall of
[50:44] unbelief
[50:46] is reasoning trying to understand the
[50:49] gospel
[50:50] by head knowledge education
[50:54] by explaining the gospel is a
[50:56] stimulation
[50:58] of heavenly thoughts out of
[51:01] eternal attributes expressed
[51:04] in an earthly language i'll give you an
[51:07] example
[51:09] jesus said in saint john 6 56
[51:13] in the synagogue in capernaum he said it
[51:16] is my flesh and drink as my blood dwells
[51:19] in me and i in him
[51:23] and continued in verse 63 the words that
[51:26] i speak unto you
[51:28] see our spirit and they are life
[51:33] how can we explain to our reasoning
[51:36] powers
[51:38] to drink the blood of jesus christ
[51:42] but if you believe it said he is came
[51:45] from heaven jesus came from heaven
[51:48] the bread of life and the life-giver is
[51:51] in him
[51:52] his life was in his
[51:55] divine blood and if you start to believe
[51:58] it
[51:59] and then we can we can take it in
[52:02] us like jesus said we drink it
[52:07] with our chest it and and it
[52:10] changes us it moves it starts to move
[52:13] us it starts to move us away from this
[52:16] world
[52:17] away from our sins away
[52:20] into these heavenly places where we come
[52:23] from
[52:24] and jesus is coming quick and the holy
[52:26] spirit is coming quick he passes
[52:28] he passes this reasoning this these
[52:31] thoughts that are coming
[52:32] he puzzles this and says here i am i am
[52:35] say i'm
[52:36] i'm your satisfying portion i'm your
[52:39] life
[52:41] so let's let's keep this the gospel is a
[52:45] stimulation of heavenly thoughts
[52:47] out of eternal attributes expressed in
[52:50] an earthly language
[52:51] so he breaks the curtains of unbelief
[52:53] reasoning head knowledge
[52:56] and start to think his thoughts it's his
[52:58] word we
[52:59] swear we we just believe it we don't we
[53:02] don't try to understand
[53:04] we just believe what he says i love you
[53:06] how can you understand it said he loves
[53:07] you
[53:08] what he says in his word he loves me so
[53:12] i he loves me i am a lovely one it takes
[53:14] all the fear out
[53:16] see just every word what comes from the
[53:18] bible
[53:19] and we confess our unbelief and we drink
[53:22] his blood and eat his flesh
[53:24] means receive his the bread of life from
[53:27] heaven
[53:29] and and the contents
[53:32] the divine life the divine nature
[53:36] it's a divine spirit and we drink it
[53:40] and we we get changed it transmits us
[53:43] from this world and we find immediately
[53:46] that said it brings us across that
[53:49] unbelief that wall that
[53:52] curtain said chasm that stands
[53:56] between us in the presence of the lord
[54:00] we want the presence of god don't we
[54:05] and and there's and if we can just
[54:09] overcome this wall of unbelief
[54:15] because in his presence
[54:18] as i said come with me to a glorious
[54:22] eternity
[54:24] stop thinking when you come in his
[54:27] presence
[54:30] bring your your burdens to him
[54:33] don't think about them oh how how bad it
[54:36] is
[54:37] just bring it to him and the blood
[54:40] transmits our sins away from us and
[54:42] brings us
[54:43] across that chasm into the presence of
[54:46] god and the prophet said and only then
[54:50] see jesus is only it's not an
[54:54] alternative way it's not an option
[54:58] it's the only way only sin
[55:02] we realize jesus christ is the same
[55:06] yesterday today and forever
[55:11] jesus is the same yesterday today and
[55:14] forever is an experience
[55:18] and when you have it you can speak it
[55:20] under this inspiration of this
[55:21] experience
[55:23] his peace his joy
[55:27] comes with me into a glorious eternity
[55:31] this heals the body of christ
[55:36] we are coming into eden condition the
[55:38] manifestation of the sons of god
[55:41] that's the subject in an eden condition
[55:45] waiting for us see these attributes are
[55:49] waiting for us
[55:51] when you when you enter this place
[55:55] sin it comes alive and you get a
[55:58] confirmation
[56:00] by an experience it is really so
[56:03] my soul comes from god
[56:06] and voice in god always and will always
[56:09] be
[56:09] in god god has ordained this glory for
[56:14] us and we are
[56:15] elected for this glory hallelujah
[56:19] from far before the foundation of the
[56:21] world
[56:24] paul said i am determined not to know
[56:28] anything see not any thought not
[56:31] anything among you
[56:33] you may tell me this said or that i am
[56:36] determined not to know anything
[56:37] save jesus christ and him crucify it
[56:42] because in in that realm
[56:45] he lived in the kingdom of god
[56:50] justified holy
[56:53] redeemed connected with eternity

[1:07:52] i'm i'm picking up on the inspiration
[1:07:59] amen the manifestation of the sons of
[1:08:03] god
[1:08:04] as it was in eden and i pray that these
[1:08:07] few words

[1:08:13] and uh translating me today we
[1:08:14] appreciate brother junior the vega
[1:08:19] and uh we know that uh the french will
[1:08:22] hear very well
[1:08:25] and i believe spanish is being done
[1:08:26] separately we appreciate
[1:08:28] those translators as well
[1:08:33] praise the lord so we just want to say
[1:08:35] back to eden
[1:08:37] and greetings to the convention at
[1:08:40] easter
[1:08:41] and we go straight away to genesis 3 9.
[1:08:46] and it reads and the lord god
[1:08:49] called unto adam and said
[1:08:53] unto him where are thou
[1:09:00] amen a great question amen
[1:09:04] romans 8 14 for as many
[1:09:08] as are led by the spirit of god
[1:09:12] they are the sons of god
[1:09:19] 2 corinthians 11 3
[1:09:22] but i fear lest by any means
[1:09:26] as the serpent beguiled eve
[1:09:29] through his subtlety so
[1:09:32] your minds should be corrupted from
[1:09:36] the simplicity that is in christ
[1:09:48] so this subtlety was not confined to
[1:09:52] eden paul said it's still going on
[1:09:57] keep it simple stay focused on jesus
[1:10:01] christ
[1:10:02] amen and 1 john
[1:10:05] 3 2. beloved
[1:10:09] now are we the sons of god and
[1:10:12] it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:10:16] be but we know that when he shall appear
[1:10:20] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:10:23] him as he is
[1:10:35] amen we start in genesis let's finish in
[1:10:37] revelation
[1:10:40] in chapter 5 verse 10.
[1:10:44] thou and hast made us unto
[1:10:47] our god kings and priests
[1:10:51] and we shall reign on the earth
[1:11:01] amen let's buy our heads in prayer
[1:11:04] lord in the name of jesus christ
[1:11:07] we thank you for this prophet that will
[1:11:11] take us further than azusa street
[1:11:15] and even further than pentecost
[1:11:18] right back to the garden of eden
[1:11:21] lord where we started
[1:11:24] how i thank you lord jesus for these
[1:11:28] promises
[1:11:29] and lord we receive them and we know
[1:11:32] that god cannot lie
[1:11:35] amen lord jesus we know that
[1:11:39] man doesn't seek god
[1:11:42] it's god that seeks man
[1:11:45] and throughout this convention lord
[1:11:49] may you seek your people may you
[1:11:53] call them wherever they are
[1:11:56] if they're hiding lord if
[1:12:00] they're running if they're backslidden
[1:12:03] may you call them and ask them where are
[1:12:06] you adam
[1:12:08] bless every heart in jesus christ's name
[1:12:12] amen and amen you can be seated saints
[1:12:15] and online god bless you so much
[1:12:18] amen eden what was eden
[1:12:21] we are left wondering
[1:12:25] uh concerning the geographical location
[1:12:30] but the the thing i'm talking about
[1:12:32] today
[1:12:34] what eden was in by way of his presence
[1:12:40] it was a meeting place of
[1:12:43] heaven and earth and when it got out of
[1:12:47] cater
[1:12:49] whatever was there just became
[1:12:53] ground it just became earth
[1:12:58] and that glory it separated
[1:13:02] eden was uh like a county
[1:13:06] you know uh brother brown said and and
[1:13:10] nod was another county
[1:13:13] next door so when you left
[1:13:16] eden and went to nod
[1:13:20] it was just like changing counties it's
[1:13:23] like changing from new york to new
[1:13:24] jersey
[1:13:26] it was just changing into different
[1:13:30] territories
[1:13:32] the real point is that god was in eden
[1:13:37] it was a paradise it was a mixture of
[1:13:40] heaven and earth
[1:13:43] and when you see heaven and earth
[1:13:46] coming together again a restored eden
[1:13:50] has begun
[1:13:52] praise the lord forever amen amen
[1:13:55] god be praised today let us go to some
[1:13:58] slides
[1:14:00] as we uh study the inspiration that
[1:14:04] pastor paul has brought to us
[1:14:07] god above us in the father
[1:14:12] with us in the sun
[1:14:15] cleansing his way condescending
[1:14:20] coming down making a way for me
[1:14:25] to get back and to bring
[1:14:28] his people that's all of us
[1:14:33] back to manifested sons of
[1:14:36] god like they had them in the garden of
[1:14:40] eden
[1:14:42] that's what we're talking about to bring
[1:14:44] that back
[1:14:46] amen not just back to the altar not just
[1:14:49] back to pentecost
[1:14:51] but back to eden praise the lord the
[1:14:54] whole world is groaning

[1:14:58] inspiration
[1:15:00] and we give god the glory that we have
[1:15:03] this hope in view
[1:15:05] that we can make it if we believe it
[1:15:10] praise the lord amen we're going to make
[1:15:14] it
[1:15:15] by his grace as many as receive him
[1:15:19] gave he power to become the sons of god
[1:15:24] blessed be the name of the lord it is
[1:15:26] that power
[1:15:28] to become that we are preaching
[1:15:32] we won't get there by legalism we'll get
[1:15:35] there by the power of the holy ghost
[1:15:38] what power transformation power
[1:15:41] amen let me explain how this is going to
[1:15:44] happen
[1:15:45] i thank god for this message because
[1:15:49] these are the seeds
[1:15:51] that we have in our hands we praise god
[1:15:55] that we are listening to them that we
[1:15:59] are hearing them
[1:16:01] that we are studying them amen listen to
[1:16:04] these great words now
[1:16:06] from satan's eden having
[1:16:09] faith in all his word
[1:16:14] and his seeds brought
[1:16:17] an eden
[1:16:20] amen of holiness love
[1:16:24] and eternal life that's what
[1:16:28] god's eden produced holiness
[1:16:33] it brought an eden of holiness
[1:16:37] love understanding
[1:16:40] perfection and eternal life
[1:16:45] amen does that sound right to you
[1:16:48] hallelujah that's what happens
[1:16:51] when you have faith in all his word
[1:16:56] but when you drop a word satan has
[1:16:59] beguiled you
[1:17:00] even if you don't understand it just say
[1:17:03] amen to it
[1:17:05] it will bring an eden blessed be the
[1:17:08] name of the lord
[1:17:10] and are you ready for the bombshell

[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:25] will be at the end
[1:17:28] if you believe that shout amen that's
[1:17:31] what his
[1:17:32] church will be at the end

[1:17:40] word
[1:17:41] blessed be the name of the lord amen god

[1:17:48] same thing

[1:17:56] to happen
[1:17:58] it's going to bring forth of its kind
[1:18:01] and there shall be more sons of god in
[1:18:04] fact the scripture says
[1:18:05] now are we the sons of god
[1:18:08] and i hope to show you eden is not
[1:18:11] something historical
[1:18:14] but it is very real it's when heaven
[1:18:18] meets with the earth let's talk about it
[1:18:21] today
[1:18:23] amen this is a very powerful quotation
[1:18:27] from the church age book it would take
[1:18:31] an hour to
[1:18:32] to unpack this quotation
[1:18:35] he says but god will prepare
[1:18:40] his holy mountain amen
[1:18:44] his new garden of eden
[1:18:48] for the bride and his and her attendance
[1:19:00] what a great thing this is how long did
[1:19:03] it take god
[1:19:05] it took him six thousand years to build
[1:19:08] his eden
[1:19:09] it took satan another six thousand years
[1:19:13] to build his eden but god said because
[1:19:16] you
[1:19:16] broke my eden i will break your eden
[1:19:21] praise be to god and uh for a thousand
[1:19:24] year honeymoon
[1:19:26] as adam and eve were in the garden
[1:19:30] and did not finish out the thousand
[1:19:33] years
[1:19:35] amen now jesus our
[1:19:38] last adam and his eve
[1:19:42] true church can we all say true church

[1:19:51] amen that last thousand years
[1:19:54] will happen by his true church
[1:19:58] blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:20:00] something is fixing to happen
[1:20:03] going to do it god's going to do it
[1:20:06] amen glory to god it is the lord's doing
[1:20:11] what happened everything back there
[1:20:15] obeyed item because
[1:20:18] everything obeyed adam because adam
[1:20:21] obeyed everything
[1:20:24] that's good he obeyed everything
[1:20:27] so everything obeyed him but when he
[1:20:30] stopped obeying
[1:20:32] he lost his power he lost control over
[1:20:35] himself
[1:20:37] and then the earth became infected
[1:20:40] amen and the ground was cursed
[1:20:43] everything obeyed adam
[1:20:47] that is the beginning of man
[1:20:50] that's what god give him power over
[1:20:55] everything on the earth now
[1:20:59] through the fall he lost that power
[1:21:03] amen and then he becomes
[1:21:06] unconscious of the fact
[1:21:10] after losing his relationship
[1:21:15] and his friendship amen
[1:21:18] fellowship with the father
[1:21:21] amen and that's what we're thirsting for
[1:21:25] fellowship with the father
[1:21:28] more than anything else more than even
[1:21:30] success
[1:21:32] we are thirsting for fellowship
[1:21:34] hallelujah
[1:21:35] with our god and our father he says
[1:21:39] he lost that he became
[1:21:42] unconscious of the fact
[1:21:45] after losing his relationship and
[1:21:48] friendship and fellowship with god
[1:21:52] all of his great channels
[1:21:56] they became clogged amen he couldn't get
[1:21:59] through
[1:22:01] and what adam was in god christ
[1:22:04] has redeemed us back to that
[1:22:07] amen amen he has redeemed us back to
[1:22:11] that
[1:22:12] now a redeemer
[1:22:17] to redeem anything
[1:22:21] is to bring it back to its origin
[1:22:24] hallelujah not just back to pentecost
[1:22:29] that's on the way but right back to eden
[1:22:32] does that sound correct amen that is the
[1:22:35] message
[1:22:36] blessed be the name of the lord amen and
[1:22:38] there are three
[1:22:40] uh foes that the prophet has revealed
[1:22:44] amen he says we are on our way back to
[1:22:47] the original eden

[1:24:38] hey man what do you want happy
[1:24:41] little fishy i'll give you your life
[1:24:43] this is speaking conditions
[1:24:46] as soon as he gets his church in
[1:24:48] speaking conditions
[1:24:50] to a place that he can flow
[1:24:55] himself and love and persuade
[1:25:00] and fellowship there will come
[1:25:03] an eden he'll take his church
[1:25:07] back to where it left him
[1:25:11] at eden again where it fell
[1:25:15] i love speaking conditions
[1:25:18] when you speak to that storm
[1:25:21] that's what you're supposed to do when
[1:25:24] you speak to that problem
[1:25:26] that is what you should be doing to
[1:25:29] bring you back to that
[1:25:30] blessed be the name of the lord that is
[1:25:33] that is where we're going
[1:25:35] and nothing can stop it nothing can
[1:25:39] block you i'm going to prove that to you
[1:25:41] now
[1:25:43] he says because he says when jesus
[1:25:45] ascended
[1:25:48] something happened and he says
[1:25:51] so little is spoken
[1:25:54] but his ascension when he went from
[1:25:57] earth
[1:25:58] up to heaven amen the ascension
[1:26:02] he says it's one of the greatest days
[1:26:06] when he ascended up because
[1:26:10] all over the earth
[1:26:13] since the day in the garden of eden
[1:26:17] that sin was committed since that day
[1:26:28] satan is the prince of the power of the
[1:26:31] air
[1:26:33] so where there used to be a connection
[1:26:37] now satan is the prince
[1:26:41] of the power of the air this
[1:26:44] channel became closed
[1:26:47] amen it was blocked amen
[1:26:52] all all since the day since that day
[1:26:56] in the garden of eden all heavens shut
[1:26:59] off
[1:27:00] he said that's right no man could see
[1:27:03] his
[1:27:04] glory no man could understand
[1:27:08] because the power is just above us
[1:27:11] heavens means atmosphere above
[1:27:15] and all these powers
[1:27:20] from mankind because of sin
[1:27:24] my there was a closure
[1:27:27] is closed you cannot go through there
[1:27:31] but then something happened
[1:27:33] amen when he rose from the dead
[1:27:38] that morning that was his own blood

[1:28:17] sprinkling his own blood
[1:28:19] hey man he went beyond as high priest
[1:28:23] he had his own blood he went beyond the
[1:28:27] veils
[1:28:29] he broke through every sphere because
[1:28:33] satan
[1:28:34] in times past he had men blocked
[1:28:38] from heaven no block
[1:28:42] block block blocked from heaven
[1:28:45] he could not get in contact with heaven

[1:29:51] upon high hallelujah oh
[1:29:54] what a day that was with his own blood

[1:30:56] corridors of heaven
[1:30:58] and hand and he used to come down
[1:31:02] and talk to man in the garden of the

[1:33:03] philadelphia
[1:33:05] this is not just pentecost the shock
[1:33:08] now we're at the evening time

[1:33:22] to enter into the heavenly
[1:33:25] and we now feel uh
[1:33:29] the strange call of god
[1:33:33] how many knows that strange call of god
[1:33:37] we may not understand it but it's a
[1:33:40] strange
[1:33:41] call of god amen samuel

[1:33:48] don't go to eli this is god calling you
[1:33:50] samuel

[1:34:00] amen a strange call of god
[1:34:03] to go to the street eden we

[1:34:09] word
[1:34:10] and we we feel like saying my family
[1:34:13] shall be saved
[1:34:15] the strange call of eden hallelujah
[1:34:19] strange call to go to this eden
[1:34:22] praise be to god it's a reality
[1:34:25] amen but but but man was blocked
[1:34:28] he was blocked by the sword according to
[1:34:31] the bible
[1:34:32] he was blocked why because if man were
[1:34:36] to eat
[1:34:37] the tree of life and not be right
[1:34:42] he would live forever in that condition
[1:34:46] so god had to block man and that sword
[1:34:50] he drove out the man and he placed
[1:34:53] it east of the garden of eden
[1:34:57] east of the county
[1:35:00] cherubims and a flaming sword
[1:35:04] which turned everyway
[1:35:08] east west
[1:35:12] south north whichever way you come
[1:35:15] i mean that sword will stop you that
[1:35:18] sword was in the middle
[1:35:20] east south north
[1:35:23] that would stop you coming to
[1:35:27] to turn every way
[1:35:30] to keep the way of the tree of life
[1:35:34] who is the way
[1:35:37] thank you who said i am the way
[1:35:41] to keep the way of the tree of life
[1:35:44] this ties in that great message called
[1:35:47] the throne
[1:35:49] brother branham taught it perfectly amen
[1:35:52] he said it all connects together judah
[1:35:56] ephraim reuben dan
[1:35:59] and all the tribes they all surrounded
[1:36:03] the ark amen and we know
[1:36:07] that the lion and the ox and the man
[1:36:11] and the eagle all surround the throne
[1:36:14] praise be to god but church let me tell

[1:56:07] of the love of god not just filial love
[1:56:11] not just human love i love you
[1:56:16] you want the love of god amen they had
[1:56:19] god's word

[2:09:35] he was veiled if abraham looked at his
[2:09:38] body
[2:09:39] he would say i would never have a son
[2:09:42] but abraham
[2:09:43] he was veiled he just saw victory
[2:09:48] god said so abraham considered not his
[2:09:52] own body
[2:09:53] now dead not even the the deadness of
[2:09:57] sarah's womb
[2:09:59] he did he didn't even think about that
