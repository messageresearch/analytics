[32:51] the lord of hosts
[32:53] the glory verse 9 of this latter house
[32:57] shall be greater than the former house
[33:00] says the lord of hosts
[33:01] and in this place will i give peace says
[33:04] the lord of hosts
[33:06] hallelujah and we have also a house
[33:08] hallelujah the prophet told us in the

[36:37] land of moabite
[36:39] hallelujah there was no salvation for
[36:41] her there was no redemption for her in
[36:43] this land
[36:44] hello but god has chosen her without the
[36:47] foundation of the world
[36:48] she should be in line of jesus
[36:50] hallelujah and he chose her
[36:52] hallelujah but one day she came into a
[36:55] reality
[36:56] healthy she came into a reality of a
[36:58] living redeemer
[37:00] of boas her redeemer at this day and she
[37:03] came
[37:04] forth hallelujah and gideon
[37:07] he was a fearful one he feared he was
[37:09] not sure
[37:10] will the lord do it and the lord gave
[37:12] him a sign hallelujah and he was
[37:14] changed from a fearful warrior he was
[37:17] changed into a warrior
[37:19] he was changed and he saw the god's
[37:21] overcoming power
[37:23] hallelujah in his life hallelujah all
[37:25] the enemies
[37:27] all the enemies that struck israel
[37:29] hallelujah they had to go away
[37:31] hallelujah and they were defeated
[37:32] hallelujah because there was a change
[37:34] going on
[37:35] and gideon he was walking in his
[37:37] adoption time hallelujah
[37:39] praise the lord hallelujah peter let's
[37:42] have a look at peter short look at peter
[37:45] peter he was trying himself he tried all
[37:48] he could
[37:49] hallelujah to get into this land to have
[37:51] this authority
[37:53] hallelujah but in all his trying he
[37:55] failed but he still loved the lord
[37:57] hallelujah but one day hallelujah he
[38:00] faced the reality of god hallelujah
[38:03] and he had a key hallelujah to open and
[38:05] to unlock
[38:06] hallelujah the realities of god
[38:08] hallelujah praise the lord and peter
[38:11] was a different person from that time on
[38:14] amen let's have a look at paul paul he
[38:18] had
[38:18] he had his own mindset he was really
[38:21] sellers about the lord
[38:22] but still he had his own mindset and how
[38:25] often have we our own mindset
[38:27] how things should be and how things
[38:29] should turn away and the way it should
[38:31] come
[38:31] but when it comes by the way of the lord
[38:34] jesus christ
[38:35] it's so different it surprised paul it
[38:38] surprised him on his way to damascus
[38:40] hallelujah
[38:41] and that being hallelujah it struck paul
[38:44] hallelujah and it set him in hallelujah
[38:46] for his time for what what was his place
[38:49] of adoption
[38:51] he says i'm a prisoner of the lord jesus
[38:54] christ
[38:55] what a place of adoption to be a
[38:57] prisoner
[38:58] of jesus christ hallelujah
[39:01] hallelujah so it's unfolding it's
[39:04] unfolding through all the time
[39:06] what is unfolding brother branham says
[39:09] it talks about jesus he says you are the
[39:11] same yesterday today and forever
[39:14] he says you are the word he says you was
[39:17] the word that was noah
[39:19] you are the word that was in moses you
[39:21] was the word that was in
[39:23] elijah and you was the word that was in
[39:26] david
[39:26] and you are the word made flesh and is
[39:30] among us today
[39:31] hallelujah so there's an unfolding of
[39:34] the word of god
[39:36] in our lives it has been in all the ages
[39:39] it was the word of god unfolding in paul
[39:43] in peter hello this was unfolding the
[39:45] word hallelujah
[39:46] and it unfolds in our lives hallelujah
[39:49] and one day
[39:50] hallelujah it's gonna come into plain
[39:52] view the unfolding
[39:54] of the reality of god hallelujah
[39:58] hallelujah when will it unfold when will
[40:01] it unfold
[40:03] we are waiting for it we are waiting for
[40:06] our adoption
[40:07] we are so much waiting we are longing
[40:09] for it there's something in our hearts
[40:11] that's striving for us
[40:13] that's striving to it brother branham
[40:16] in a code where i think pentecostal
[40:18] failed
[40:19] he said god will place in the church the
[40:22] place
[40:23] that he sees you in so god will prepare
[40:26] that place
[40:27] within the church where he sees you in
[40:29] after he adopts you into his family
[40:32] he says he will call you out someday in
[40:35] a little prayer meeting
[40:36] hallelujah there's a call going out
[40:39] hallelujah in a little prayer meeting
[40:41] hallelujah
[40:41] and the first thing you know and he
[40:43] plays a rope
[40:45] upon you hallelujah brother prem says

[40:48] is a rope of serenity it's a robe of
[40:51] reigning
[40:52] hallelujah it's a royal robe he says
[40:54] hallelujah and he puts that robe
[40:56] where does brother branham says it he
[40:58] says in a little prayer meeting
[41:00] hallelujah a little prayer meeting where
[41:02] we are shut up with god
[41:04] hallelujah in a secret place where our
[41:06] own thoughts are gone
[41:08] hallelujah everything else is gone but
[41:10] only he matters
[41:12] he matters all to us hallelujah and in a
[41:14] meeting like this hallelujah
[41:16] he can come down hallelujah and he can
[41:19] call you
[41:20] out hallelujah and he makes a ceremony
[41:22] upon you hallelujah
[41:24] hello he can be in a prayer meeting it
[41:25] can be in this meeting hallelujah
[41:27] where he's gonna call out but let's be

[41:34] is ready hallelujah and he will call you
[41:36] out
[41:37] hallelujah praise the lord brother
[41:40] branham says he says in this
[41:42] message the great warrior there david he
[41:45] says now
[41:46] we know it's god will it's god's will to
[41:49] save the lost
[41:51] we know it's god's will to heal the sick
[41:54] now if we can
[41:55] only positionally place ourselves
[41:58] in his will he says then it's over
[42:02] hallelujah if you think about adoption
[42:04] healthy brother branham says when we
[42:07] put our own will hell and we put it in
[42:09] the will of god

[54:01] us unto the adoption of children by
[54:03] jesus christ
[54:04] himself according to the good pleasure
[54:07] of his will
[54:08] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[54:11] wherein
[54:12] he hath made us accepted in the beloved
[54:16] and reading romans eight and reading
[54:19] from
[54:19] verse 14 romans 8 and verse 14
[54:23] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[54:26] god
[54:27] they are the sons of god for ye have not
[54:30] received a spirit of bondage again to
[54:32] fear
[54:33] but we have received a spirit of
[54:35] adoption whereby we cry our father
[54:38] the spirit itself buried witness with
[54:41] our spirit that we
[54:42] are the children of god and if children
[54:45] then ears
[54:45] ears of god and joint ears with christ
[54:48] if so be that we suffer
[54:50] with him that we may be also glorified
[54:54] together
[54:54] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[54:58] present time
[54:59] are not worthy to be compared with the
[55:01] glory which shall be revealed in us you
[55:03] believe that this
[55:04] morning tonight where whatever time zone
[55:07] you're in
[55:08] for the earnest expectation of the
[55:10] creature
[55:11] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[55:14] of god
[55:14] for the creature was made subject to
[55:16] vanity not willingly
[55:18] but by reason of him who had subjected
[55:21] the same in hope
[55:22] because the creature itself also shall
[55:25] be delivered
[55:26] from the bondage of corruption into the
[55:29] glorious liberty
[55:30] of the children of god for we know that
[55:32] the whole creation grown it
[55:35] and travail it in pain together until
[55:37] now
[55:38] and not only they but ourselves also
[55:41] which have the first fruits of the
[55:42] spirit
[55:43] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[55:46] waiting for the adoption
[55:48] to with the redemption of our body may
[55:50] the lord have a blessing to the reading
[55:51] of his word let's just pray one more
[55:53] time heavily father
[55:54] lord we have read your sacred scriptures
[55:57] lord and
[55:58] in this last service we pray that lord
[56:00] you would walk out the pages of the
[56:02] bible may you
[56:03] lord open your word to us may you bring
[56:06] lord understanding to your people may
[56:08] you raise the fate of your people
[56:10] may you encourage your people may you
[56:12] take me out of the way
[56:13] may you use me as a microphone me you
[56:16] speak direct to your sons and your
[56:17] daughters
[56:18] lord both here and around the world and
[56:21] wherever the tape may be played
[56:23] may the shout of the king be in the camp
[56:25] and let your people know that they are
[56:27] more for us than against us
[56:28] and let your people know that the season
[56:30] is here and the time has come
[56:33] and the always upon us may you bless the
[56:35] word bless the reading of the word
[56:37] bless the hearing of the word in the
[56:39] precious theme of jesus christ and the
[56:41] church says
[56:42] amen and amen and they mean well you may
[56:44] be seated
[56:46] amen and what a season what a time
[56:50] and by the time this service is played
[56:52] you would have
[56:53] seen all the all the services and all
[56:55] the meetings and
[56:56] we thank god that throughout this whole
[56:59] season of 2020
[57:01] that although we can't meet how we would
[57:03] normally have done
[57:05] god allowed a technology to be used to
[57:07] bring us together
[57:08] from around the world from the east from
[57:10] the west from the north and the south
[57:11] and we are grateful to god for his grace
[57:14] and his love and his mercy and his
[57:16] blessings
[57:17] that we could be looking at the last few
[57:19] days of 2020
[57:21] and looking forward to 2021 by the grace
[57:23] of god
[57:24] for our mighty climax of this great
[57:27] story of redemption
[57:28] that started way back there that we
[57:30] could be counted a part of that great
[57:32] story
[57:33] that god would leave the last chapter
[57:36] for a certain group of people
[57:37] who would form the last pages of this
[57:39] book and satan is mad
[57:41] but we are so glad and the inspiration
[57:44] of this meeting
[57:46] the manifestation of the sons of god the
[57:48] adoption
[57:49] time the placing of sons to think all
[57:52] these years
[57:53] has been leading to this spot has been
[57:55] leaving to this time
[57:57] has been leading to this season what a
[57:59] reason to shout
[58:00] what a reason to worship what a reason
[58:02] to shake yourself
[58:04] and forget about yesterday and forget
[58:06] about the things you cannot control
[58:08] and forget the things you cannot change
[58:10] and forget the things you don't have the
[58:12] power over
[58:13] but there are certain things that are
[58:14] within our power there are certain
[58:16] things that are within our control
[58:18] and the sons of god who are coming into
[58:20] view
[58:21] by revelation and manifestation where
[58:24] peter wants to push back the darkness up
[58:26] to push back the plagues
[58:27] not the plagues only but the devil
[58:29] himself up because we are getting ready
[58:31] for a final climax
[58:33] and a final showdown can the church say
[58:36] amen
[58:38] you may be seated i'd like to thank
[58:39] brother solomon china
[58:41] the host pastor uh for the inspiration
[58:44] to have this meeting and the
[58:46] and the and the theme of the meeting and
[58:48] may the lord richie bless him
[58:50] and live tabernacle in tamale ghana for
[58:52] the great
[58:53] fate and the great vision and the great
[58:56] passion
[58:57] to see what can be done in this time
[58:59] because there's a time coming
[59:00] when no man could work so while we could
[59:03] work while we could worship
[59:05] while we could pull on fire while we
[59:07] could hold on for our families
[59:08] we want to do it every day because
[59:10] they're going to shut the churches down
[59:12] you know that they're going to shut it
[59:13] down but listen before that time comes
[59:16] this pride will come into power i'm not
[59:19] talking about the church
[59:20] i'm not talking about church members but
[59:23] mrs jesus christ
[59:25] true sons of born sons filled sons
[59:28] will rise up and no devil no demon
[59:32] no principality no power nothing past
[59:36] nothing present will stop his pride
[59:40] from coming into view i see her rising
[59:43] up
[59:43] rising up in the east rising up in the
[59:46] west
[59:47] rising up in the north rising up in the
[59:49] south
[59:50] oh hallelujah you may be seated i know
[59:53] you've had wonderful preaching
[59:55] because that's how god is he rose up
[59:57] individuals in such a time as this
[1:00:00] a man of god i'm just a spare tire
[1:00:03] to close us out but you've already heard
[1:00:05] the word
[1:00:06] the word is in the pride the word is in
[1:00:08] you and that word cannot fail
[1:00:10] it must come to pass it will produce
[1:00:14] it will produce what malachi 4 spoke
[1:00:17] about
[1:00:19] a glorious church without spot
[1:00:23] without wrinkle sin we cannot stay in
[1:00:26] that church
[1:00:27] the holy ghost will be in that church in
[1:00:29] the individuals in that church
[1:00:32] you may be seated i'm trying to finish
[1:00:35] the greeting
[1:00:36] so i can get a little thought in this
[1:00:38] service so i want to greet all the
[1:00:39] ministers
[1:00:40] who would have spoken and all the
[1:00:43] various brothers who would have
[1:00:44] greeted and brought their greetings from
[1:00:46] around the world
[1:00:47] and the song leaders and the musicians
[1:00:50] the specials
[1:00:51] the churches the believers who have
[1:00:53] connected and will watch the service
[1:00:55] afterwards
[1:00:56] as we come together to end now the year
[1:00:59] 2020
[1:01:00] and if i don't see you may you have a
[1:01:02] wonderful blessed happy new year
[1:01:04] may god prosper your way may he grant
[1:01:07] the desires of your heart
[1:01:08] may he baptize you with fire may your
[1:01:11] cup run
[1:01:12] over if your child is in the world let
[1:01:14] me prophesy they are coming back up

[1:01:18] prophesy it's going to be fixed up
[1:01:20] if you need something restored this is
[1:01:22] the season of restoration
[1:01:25] hallelujah you may be seated oh
[1:01:28] hallelujah there are two kinds of
[1:01:30] miracles
[1:01:30] they are instant miracles so while
[1:01:32] you're in this service
[1:01:34] or you're watching this tape god could
[1:01:36] heal you instantly
[1:01:37] but brother branham also spoke about
[1:01:38] span of time miracles
[1:01:40] that takes some time so after this
[1:01:42] service is over
[1:01:43] the world that is spoken over you will
[1:01:45] follow you
[1:01:46] follow you to your car follow you to
[1:01:49] your home
[1:01:50] follow you to the plane follow you to
[1:01:52] wherever you go
[1:01:53] and anything now it's gonna come to pass
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:01:58] oh hallelujah may the lord bless you
[1:02:01] so for a title this morning
[1:02:05] this evening positionally placed
[1:02:08] for the final showdown positionally
[1:02:12] placed
[1:02:13] for the final showdown for a subject the
[1:02:16] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:02:18] and as an inspiration the great hour of
[1:02:21] charge
[1:02:22] is at hand what we have been waiting for
[1:02:25] with the terrorists
[1:02:26] what we've been waiting for brother
[1:02:27] kangali what we've been waiting for all
[1:02:29] these years
[1:02:30] this is it so this is just a layer
[1:02:32] background before i get to the text
[1:02:34] i'm not going to be too long with you
[1:02:35] right with me this evening in a message
[1:02:38] adoption
[1:02:39] but ibrahim said looks to me like we are
[1:02:41] the end time and god is adopting
[1:02:44] and i'm sure by the time this service is
[1:02:46] played you would have heard this in many
[1:02:48] different ways because this is the theme
[1:02:49] of the convention
[1:02:50] god is adopting setting positionally
[1:02:53] in church in the body of christ
[1:02:57] he said now there's not going to be too
[1:02:59] many
[1:03:00] i want you to catch this that he puts in
[1:03:02] there so it's not based on attendance
[1:03:04] it's not a numbers game it's not
[1:03:06] everybody who coming to the message
[1:03:08] it's just going to be a few people he
[1:03:10] said there's not going to be too many
[1:03:13] that he put in there so you got to make
[1:03:15] sure that you are one of them
[1:03:17] that's placed in there hallelujah and
[1:03:20] you will see throughout this meeting
[1:03:22] that god is differentiating between sons
[1:03:25] and play sons he's differentiating
[1:03:28] between being born again
[1:03:30] and being positionally born because we
[1:03:33] know
[1:03:33] that god dispatches a tutor oh to watch
[1:03:37] over your behavior
[1:03:38] to watch your conduct over this year
[1:03:41] 2020
[1:03:42] when the world is gripped by a pandemic
[1:03:44] the tutor has been dispatched
[1:03:46] to see how you would operate up when the
[1:03:48] pastor cannot see you
[1:03:50] to see how you would operate up when the
[1:03:52] deacon cannot see you
[1:03:54] because it's not about impressing the
[1:03:56] deacon or impressing the pastor
[1:03:58] it's the tutor he's giving a report he's
[1:04:01] giving a report right now
[1:04:02] he's giving a report on your attitude
[1:04:04] he's given a report on your worship
[1:04:07] he's giving you a report right now and i
[1:04:09] want that report
[1:04:10] to say hey i want that report to say
[1:04:13] pass
[1:04:14] i want that report to say overcomer i
[1:04:16] want that report to say he's making it
[1:04:18] he stood the test up he didn't give up
[1:04:21] he's not backsliding
[1:04:23] he might be tired but he made it in he
[1:04:26] might be wary
[1:04:27] but he made it in he thought of giving
[1:04:30] up but he's still here
[1:04:33] give the lord a shout our praise
[1:04:36] oh hallelujah oh
[1:04:40] hallelujah just a little background
[1:04:43] in adoption he said you think cancer is
[1:04:45] coming this whole
[1:04:46] virus had the whole world crippled shut
[1:04:49] down the airports
[1:04:51] shut down businesses shut down the
[1:04:53] streets
[1:04:54] lock people up all kinds of situations
[1:04:57] he said you think cancer is coming the
[1:05:00] bible said there's coming a time
[1:05:01] when men will rot right in their flesh
[1:05:05] oh you think this pandemic is something
[1:05:07] and the buzzers will eat off carcasses
[1:05:10] before they even die he said cancer
[1:05:13] is a toothache to what's coming but
[1:05:15] remember that horrible thing
[1:05:17] was forbidden in that day to touch those
[1:05:20] who had the seal of god that's what we
[1:05:23] are striving for
[1:05:24] now so god bless you brother solomon for
[1:05:27] bringing out this theme
[1:05:29] because this is what we are striving for
[1:05:31] to get in
[1:05:32] and be positionally placed into the
[1:05:36] kingdom of god before these horrible
[1:05:38] plagues strike
[1:05:39] not placed in the church but
[1:05:41] positionally placed
[1:05:43] in the kingdom of god in other words
[1:05:45] take your position
[1:05:46] take your rank hold your position take
[1:05:49] your
[1:05:50] rank why we are getting ready for
[1:05:52] warfare
[1:05:54] we are getting ready for warfare satan
[1:05:57] has run his course
[1:05:58] he has done everything he is supposed to
[1:06:01] do
[1:06:01] and he's at the end of his journey but
[1:06:04] now when it looks all dark
[1:06:06] here comes mrs jesus christ oh
[1:06:09] she has been preparing for a long time
[1:06:12] since the prophet was here she has been
[1:06:14] getting ready
[1:06:15] she's been getting ready but now
[1:06:18] now when we need it the bride hasn't had
[1:06:21] a revival yet
[1:06:22] but it'll take just oh hallelujah
[1:06:25] no manifestation of god to stir the
[1:06:28] pride
[1:06:29] he will send it he promised and i
[1:06:31] believe it's
[1:06:32] now hallelujah
[1:06:36] oh my you may be seated
[1:06:41] so we talk about being positionally
[1:06:43] placed
[1:06:44] for the final showdown so i just want to
[1:06:47] encourage you a little bit
[1:06:49] i want to talk about position about
[1:06:51] being in position
[1:06:53] i want to talk a little bit about
[1:06:54] positionally being placed
[1:06:56] i want to talk about the importance of
[1:06:58] order and position because god is a god
[1:07:00] of order
[1:07:01] he doesn't make a mistake you look
[1:07:04] through god's resume you cannot find a
[1:07:06] mistake
[1:07:06] he's a perfect god there's no mistake
[1:07:09] when he put your name on the book
[1:07:11] he didn't make a mistake he's not trying
[1:07:14] something
[1:07:14] he's not making up something he's not
[1:07:17] hoping something happens
[1:07:18] he's a god of order he said you are
[1:07:20] predestinated
[1:07:21] unto adoption not predestinated unto
[1:07:24] salvation
[1:07:25] predestinated onto adoption placing of
[1:07:28] sons
[1:07:29] where the authority and the power could
[1:07:31] come to you can the church say amen
[1:07:36] hallelujah and the reason placing is
[1:07:40] necessary it's because
[1:07:43] something is out of place
[1:07:46] if it was not out of place brother
[1:07:48] george there's no need to put it in
[1:07:49] place
[1:07:52] so this whole thing about getting in
[1:07:54] place is because it's out of place
[1:07:58] so i want to go back to the beginning
[1:08:00] i'd love to go back to the beginning and
[1:08:01] before the beginning
[1:08:02] because we know the devil hates genesis
[1:08:05] and he hates revelation
[1:08:07] so i love to go there because it puts
[1:08:09] pressure on the devil
[1:08:10] whenever the devil comes at you bring
[1:08:12] out revelation and bring on genesis
[1:08:14] and see the devil begin to tremble
[1:08:16] because he doesn't like the beginning
[1:08:17] and he doesn't like the ending can the
[1:08:19] church say amen
[1:08:22] so before the fall of man the sun was in
[1:08:25] its position
[1:08:27] the s-u-n the moon was in its position
[1:08:30] the animals were in their position
[1:08:33] nature
[1:08:34] was in its position nature wasn't
[1:08:36] groaning and travailing because
[1:08:38] it was in position everything was in
[1:08:40] order there was nothing needed to be
[1:08:42] fixed
[1:08:43] because everything was perfect god said
[1:08:45] it is good
[1:08:46] it is good it is good and each day that
[1:08:50] passed it was good
[1:08:51] it was good and when god brought man
[1:08:54] into the picture
[1:08:55] man was not born he was placed
[1:08:59] adam wasn't a little boy he was placed
[1:09:02] in the garden
[1:09:02] so he was a placed son he was just put
[1:09:05] there in the garden
[1:09:07] and there without any explanation the
[1:09:09] animals knew that a master
[1:09:11] had been installed the trees knew that
[1:09:14] the master
[1:09:14] had been installed the heavens knew that
[1:09:17] a master
[1:09:18] a placed son was in position can the
[1:09:20] church say amen
[1:09:22] and because adam was in position and
[1:09:24] nothing was out of order
[1:09:26] when eve came she was also in position
[1:09:30] there was nothing to be fixed there was
[1:09:32] nothing to be corrected
[1:09:34] everything was in order and that's just
[1:09:36] how god loves it
[1:09:37] he loves to see your life in order he
[1:09:39] wants your prayer life to be in order
[1:09:41] he wants your home to be in order he
[1:09:43] wants a church to be in order he wants
[1:09:45] your heart to be in order and god was
[1:09:47] good
[1:09:48] he felt good because everything was in
[1:09:50] order
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:52] everybody with me this morning this
[1:09:53] evening all manner of life
[1:09:56] recognized that the place sun was on the
[1:09:59] earth
[1:09:59] no introduction was necessary no
[1:10:02] explanation was necessary
[1:10:04] no conversation was necessary they
[1:10:06] recognized the
[1:10:08] the power that was locked up in adam
[1:10:12] he just had to speak and they had to
[1:10:14] obey
[1:10:15] can the church say man oh hallelujah
[1:10:23] eve had a position and it was behind the
[1:10:28] word
[1:10:31] once she stayed in position nothing
[1:10:32] could go wrong
[1:10:34] once she stayed behind the word in
[1:10:36] position
[1:10:39] the devil couldn't move i want us to
[1:10:41] realize that the devil was moving around
[1:10:43] but he was limited he had no ability to
[1:10:46] access
[1:10:47] nothing because everything was in
[1:10:49] position
[1:10:53] the position was physical they were in
[1:10:55] the garden of eden
[1:10:57] the position was spiritual they were in
[1:10:59] order perfect communion harmony with god
[1:11:01] nothing could have gone wrong because
[1:11:03] they were in position
[1:11:04] the position was there was an emotional
[1:11:06] element adam didn't know what fear was
[1:11:09] he didn't know what hiding was he didn't
[1:11:11] know what shame was
[1:11:12] so he was also in an emotional position
[1:11:15] he got the emotion that we know
[1:11:17] but he didn't know certain emotions
[1:11:21] and that position was in the word it was
[1:11:24] hiding behind the word
[1:11:25] it was protected by the word that
[1:11:28] position
[1:11:29] had rights that position had benefits
[1:11:33] that position had restrictions
[1:11:37] once he was impositioned by the currents
[1:11:39] there were rights that came with the
[1:11:41] position
[1:11:42] there were benefits that came with the
[1:11:45] he couldn't get old once he was in
[1:11:47] position he couldn't get sick
[1:11:49] once he stayed in position he couldn't
[1:11:51] die once he was in position he didn't
[1:11:54] know sorrow
[1:11:55] once he's in position he doesn't know
[1:11:56] heartache oh
[1:11:58] hallelujah anybody with me and that's
[1:12:01] the position
[1:12:02] that we are going back to oh god lord
[1:12:04] help me
[1:12:05] a position with rights a position with
[1:12:08] benefits
[1:12:08] a position with restrictions
[1:12:12] you maybe see that for a minute you know
[1:12:14] when they get a job
[1:12:16] your job is called a position so when
[1:12:18] you are uh
[1:12:19] uh uh uh administrator in a job
[1:12:23] that administrator has rights you have a
[1:12:26] writer salary
[1:12:27] yeah you have certain benefits you might
[1:12:29] get insurance you might but but as you
[1:12:31] go higher
[1:12:32] and your position changes you get
[1:12:35] different rights
[1:12:36] you get different benefits you also have
[1:12:39] different restrictions
[1:12:40] because the higher you go the more right
[1:12:42] you get you get a better salary

[1:12:47] certain other benefits
[1:12:48] they might give you a car they might
[1:12:50] give you a mobile device
[1:12:51] they might give you a computer and you
[1:12:53] have restrictions there are some things
[1:12:55] you cannot do
[1:12:56] the higher you go the higher
[1:12:59] the position you hold there are certain
[1:13:02] things you cannot do
[1:13:03] because you represent the position and
[1:13:05] you represent the office
[1:13:08] come on now anybody with me
[1:13:11] oh hallelujah i'm not a i'm not a deep
[1:13:14] preacher
[1:13:14] i'm a practical kind of preacher because
[1:13:16] this thing about position in christ
[1:13:19] because i have to understand it break it
[1:13:20] down simple to me this position has
[1:13:23] rights
[1:13:24] there are certain things i can access
[1:13:26] when i get into this position
[1:13:28] and the closer i get to this position my
[1:13:30] rights
[1:13:31] are going to increase my benefits are
[1:13:34] going to increase
[1:13:35] and my restrictions are going to
[1:13:37] increase because of this position
[1:13:39] there are certain places i cannot go no
[1:13:42] more because of this position
[1:13:44] there are certain words i can't use no
[1:13:46] more because of this position
[1:13:48] i can't hold any odds because of
[1:13:50] disposition
[1:13:51] i can't have any grudges because of this
[1:13:54] position
[1:13:54] i can't have any jealousy anybody with
[1:13:57] me this morning
[1:13:58] anybody with me this evening
[1:14:07] so adam fell and he fell
[1:14:10] and because they fell from this position
[1:14:13] things change
[1:14:16] i want us to understand how important
[1:14:17] this position thing is
[1:14:19] because it's position in christ it's a
[1:14:22] place in the body
[1:14:24] it's a ministry by the branham says he
[1:14:26] calls it five offices
[1:14:28] and there's a court that i'm gonna get
[1:14:29] to that god before the foundation of the
[1:14:31] world predestinated you to be a
[1:14:33] housewife
[1:14:34] to be a farmer god predestinated your
[1:14:37] occupation
[1:14:38] you think you chose your job god
[1:14:40] predestinated it
[1:14:42] oh come on now somebody preached back to
[1:14:44] me god wasn't leaving anything to
[1:14:46] accident
[1:14:47] he wasn't leaving anything to chance
[1:14:49] because this bride
[1:14:50] will be the one to give the final
[1:14:52] knockout punch can the church say amen
[1:14:59] hallelujah i'm building
[1:15:02] we're talking about positionally placed
[1:15:04] for the final showdown
[1:15:05] i want to even go before the beginning i
[1:15:08] want to go to
[1:15:09] the war in heaven because the war in
[1:15:11] heaven was a war position
[1:15:16] this issue of position is a big one
[1:15:18] because the devil wasn't satisfied with
[1:15:20] his position
[1:15:21] so he wanted to get a promotion
[1:15:27] he looked at where god was he looked at
[1:15:29] what god had
[1:15:30] he looked at the worship and he said i
[1:15:32] would like to be like the most high
[1:15:35] he wanted a change in position so you
[1:15:37] know what god did god demoted him
[1:15:41] there was war in heaven and michael
[1:15:43] fought and the angels fought
[1:15:45] and at the equal sign of that war
[1:15:48] was satan was demoted he was kicked out
[1:15:51] of heaven
[1:15:52] called the first emotion that's the
[1:15:55] first emotion
[1:15:57] keep opening that because we're going to
[1:15:59] get to his second emotion
[1:16:00] later in the service but the devil's
[1:16:03] aspiration for position
[1:16:05] led to his first demotion
[1:16:08] anybody with me this morning what is
[1:16:11] your position this morning
[1:16:13] i tell you young brother young sister
[1:16:15] mother father
[1:16:16] get right with god get into position
[1:16:20] your position is not playing around with
[1:16:22] the world your position is not being a
[1:16:24] good church member
[1:16:25] your position is not being in the
[1:16:26] message its place in christ
[1:16:29] adoption time manifestation of the sons
[1:16:32] of god
[1:16:33] can the chit say man can i encourage you
[1:16:36] a little bit
[1:16:38] your position affects what you can see
[1:16:42] when you're in the valley you could see
[1:16:44] less than when you're on the mountain
[1:16:48] your position affects what you can do
[1:16:51] in a war your position can determine if
[1:16:54] you have victory or defeat
[1:16:56] if you have to go into war you have to
[1:16:58] choose the battleground
[1:17:00] you have to make sure you know where the
[1:17:01] enemy is at so your position is
[1:17:03] important
[1:17:08] your position affects what you are
[1:17:10] exposed to
[1:17:12] so the higher you are in a company the
[1:17:13] more information you have the more
[1:17:16] knowledge you have
[1:17:17] your position impacts your
[1:17:19] responsibility
[1:17:22] so when you are not a father and you
[1:17:24] become a father your position changes
[1:17:26] so too do your responsibilities
[1:17:30] that's the problem today people don't
[1:17:31] realize that the
[1:17:33] change of position also mean change of
[1:17:35] responsibility
[1:17:36] when you become a father you need to
[1:17:38] pray more
[1:17:42] oh yeah oh yeah you gotta have more
[1:17:45] patience
[1:17:46] because a change opposition your
[1:17:48] position impacts your responsibility
[1:17:52] your position impacts the decisions you
[1:17:54] need to make
[1:17:56] so your position as a son means you have
[1:17:58] to make certain decisions of when to say
[1:18:00] yes i want to say no
[1:18:02] when to turn the tv off when to turn
[1:18:04] your head like the prophet did
[1:18:05] because of his position he didn't spend
[1:18:07] time with any and everybody
[1:18:09] because of his position he put a cross
[1:18:11] in his car
[1:18:12] so when he saw the woman on the street
[1:18:14] he would look at the cross in the car
[1:18:16] that was based on his position
[1:18:18] [Music]
[1:18:21] anybody with me your position means that
[1:18:24] there are some things
[1:18:25] you must ignore
[1:18:29] you can't let everything get to you
[1:18:31] because of your position
[1:18:32] you have a lot coming at you i'm trying
[1:18:34] to encourage you church
[1:18:36] because this year has been a rough year
[1:18:38] for many people and i've got news for
[1:18:40] you
[1:18:40] 2021 going to be harder it's going to be
[1:18:43] tougher
[1:18:44] but god will not give you more than you
[1:18:46] could stand and he promised to send
[1:18:48] power
[1:18:49] so that it will not be your strength it
[1:18:51] will not be your might
[1:18:52] but it will be the holy ghost it'll be
[1:18:54] god's power coming into you
[1:18:56] to meet the challenge of the hour so
[1:18:58] lift your head up
[1:19:00] square your shoulders back
[1:19:05] your position means that there are some
[1:19:07] things you must ignore
[1:19:08] your position means that there are some
[1:19:10] things you must act upon
[1:19:12] you can't just do as if it doesn't exist
[1:19:14] so you have to have wisdom
[1:19:15] based on your position
[1:19:21] because this isn't it's about a father's
[1:19:22] business you know it's about confidence
[1:19:25] so i'm speaking to ceos
[1:19:28] because the father has a business and
[1:19:30] he's adopting sons to take his place in
[1:19:33] the business
[1:19:34] so you can't tell me you don't know and
[1:19:36] you don't understand
[1:19:37] and you don't want to make the decision
[1:19:39] and you don't want to say no to the
[1:19:40] devil
[1:19:41] because your check your signature is as
[1:19:43] good as a father's signature
[1:19:46] so you got to get stronger that's why
[1:19:48] you say let the weak say i'm strong
[1:19:50] you gotta have confidence so when you
[1:19:52] say to one go he go it
[1:19:54] when you say come he comes
[1:19:57] this adoption is not playing games this
[1:20:00] adoption is running the father's
[1:20:01] business
[1:20:02] so we give you a little home a little
[1:20:03] house a little family you got to get
[1:20:05] experience
[1:20:06] managing that well if you want to
[1:20:07] graduate to manage in the kingdom
[1:20:09] business
[1:20:10] oh come on now you got to run a good
[1:20:12] business before you can manage god's
[1:20:14] business
[1:20:15] you got to run a holy life because you
[1:20:16] could operate in this thing
[1:20:18] he the tutor is seeing your conduct your
[1:20:21] behavior under pressure
[1:20:22] how you handle stress how you handle
[1:20:24] decisions
[1:20:25] that's who he's coming to adopt because
[1:20:28] it's about the father's business
[1:20:31] anybody with me is that just a shout
[1:20:34] and a jump no it's about your behavior
[1:20:38] under pressure oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:41] under pressure everybody operates well
[1:20:44] when there's no pressure
[1:20:46] but under pressure there's no money in
[1:20:49] the bank
[1:20:50] there's pressure you lost your job
[1:20:52] there's no food on the table
[1:20:54] there's this going on you have somebody
[1:20:56] in a family sick
[1:20:57] it's under pressure you can say i know
[1:20:59] my redeemer lives
[1:21:01] oh and you could be like job if the lord
[1:21:03] gives the law take it away
[1:21:05] or you'll be like jonah you just there
[1:21:07] you recognize that you are the wrong one
[1:21:09] and you say i'm out of position
[1:21:11] i should have been a nineveh but if i
[1:21:13] turn to face the temple
[1:21:14] and get back in position somebody help
[1:21:17] me this morning anybody in the house
[1:21:19] this morning
[1:21:24] you may be seated so the issue of
[1:21:27] led to the first war the war in heaven
[1:21:31] and this issue of position will lead to
[1:21:34] the end of all wars
[1:21:36] to the final showdown because god will
[1:21:38] place
[1:21:39] in position sons and daughters who have
[1:21:42] been seasoned
[1:21:43] out and the devil man you know that's
[1:21:46] why the devil is so mad
[1:21:47] oh hallelujah somebody give god a shout
[1:21:50] our praise
[1:21:53] our position in christ is our legal
[1:21:56] standing with god
[1:21:58] listen god don't have to explain to
[1:21:59] angels who you are
[1:22:01] when you are in position the angels know
[1:22:03] who you are oh you don't even know how
[1:22:05] you made it to church this morning
[1:22:07] how god was moving things around angels
[1:22:09] moving things around
[1:22:10] because you are a child of god and the
[1:22:13] fact that you are predestinated
[1:22:15] unto adoption meaning if you're not
[1:22:17] adopted yet
[1:22:18] because your trajectory is adoption
[1:22:21] because your destiny is adoption
[1:22:23] because adoption is within your reach oh
[1:22:26] god send angels to protect you to watch
[1:22:29] over you
[1:22:30] even the tutor himself to report on you
[1:22:33] you can miss this if you wanted to you
[1:22:36] can't lose this if
[1:22:38] you wanted to it's not even up to you
[1:22:41] you are predestinated
[1:22:44] cannot fail what devil what demon
[1:22:48] what principality satan you are finished
[1:22:51] in this meeting finish in this year
[1:22:54] finish
[1:22:55] in the church finish in your family
[1:22:57] finish
[1:23:00] the egyptians you see today you will see
[1:23:02] them no more
[1:23:03] forever forever this is your year of
[1:23:06] jubilee
[1:23:07] this is your year of freedom
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:10] no wonder the prophet said the moment
[1:23:12] the bride gets to know who she is
[1:23:15] all the devil could do is try to tell
[1:23:17] you you are somebody else
[1:23:19] but in this meeting you are a son you
[1:23:22] are a son
[1:23:23] as many as are led by the spirit of god
[1:23:25] they
[1:23:26] are the sons of god oh it does not
[1:23:28] appear what we shall
[1:23:30] be but when we see him we shall be like
[1:23:33] him
[1:23:34] [Music]
[1:23:35] born of his bone spirit of his spirit
[1:23:38] flesh of his flesh
[1:23:42] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:23:46] and when that time comes but abraham
[1:23:48] said right now you lay hands on the sick
[1:23:50] but when that time comes up you will
[1:23:52] command the demons
[1:23:53] right now you have trouble on your job
[1:23:55] but when that time comes
[1:23:57] your boss will not need an introduction
[1:24:00] he will not you need an explanation
[1:24:02] there'll be something about you that
[1:24:04] will give way
[1:24:05] to give glory to god because you are
[1:24:07] carrying the seed of the world
[1:24:09] that's going to become fleshly somebody
[1:24:12] help me this evening
[1:24:19] anybody with me oh hallelujah
[1:24:23] oh hallelujah the whole creation
[1:24:26] since genesis the whole creation the
[1:24:29] trees are growing
[1:24:31] because they knew what it felt like when
[1:24:33] adam was in position
[1:24:36] the trees knew what it felt like the
[1:24:38] animals knew what it felt like
[1:24:40] when a son said come the lion knew what
[1:24:43] it felt like
[1:24:44] to walk to adam and i didn't touch the
[1:24:47] lions yet
[1:24:49] but when adam fell the animals had to go
[1:24:52] to retreat
[1:24:53] the animals had to go into the defense
[1:24:55] the trees began to die out
[1:24:57] the nature began to get affected all the
[1:24:59] streams were gonna get polluted
[1:25:01] because sin had entered into the picture
[1:25:04] and since that time a groan
[1:25:06] a travail a cry for restoration
[1:25:10] started to affect the whole world from
[1:25:13] that time on
[1:25:14] the groan has been increasing it's like
[1:25:17] a mother
[1:25:17] a group getting ready to give put labor
[1:25:20] pains
[1:25:21] since genesis and as each decade and as
[1:25:24] the years come back
[1:25:25] the contractions keep getting closer the
[1:25:28] time be getting shorter there's a
[1:25:29] countdown going on
[1:25:31] because this earth is about to give
[1:25:33] birth again
[1:25:34] this whole earth is to be transformed
[1:25:36] because once
[1:25:37] more suns are coming into position
[1:25:41] you don't think the trees know it you
[1:25:43] don't think the trees got a revival
[1:25:46] oh yes somebody help me the trees had a
[1:25:48] revival
[1:25:49] the winds had a revival the seas had a
[1:25:52] revival
[1:25:52] when jesus was here anybody with me
[1:25:56] and the devil raised up a storm and
[1:25:58] jesus was sleeping
[1:26:01] and they said let's wake jesus jesus got
[1:26:04] up out of his sleep
[1:26:05] he looked at the disciples he looked at
[1:26:07] the weather he looked at everything
[1:26:09] he said peace be still and he went back
[1:26:12] to sleep
[1:26:13] he didn't even look to see what happened
[1:26:15] and the trees
[1:26:16] and the seas and the birds and the
[1:26:18] animals
[1:26:19] say you felt that this is what it felt
[1:26:23] like
[1:26:24] when adam was here this is what it felt
[1:26:26] like way back before the fall
[1:26:28] it means there's hope there's
[1:26:30] restoration somewhere
[1:26:31] there's restoration sometime
[1:26:35] oh i'm going to read it in a quote from
[1:26:37] the prophet how do you think the earth
[1:26:38] felt up
[1:26:39] when god's prophet william branham
[1:26:41] walked here and say
[1:26:42] storm move back and say little fishy i
[1:26:45] give you your life
[1:26:46] that fish went to tell all the other
[1:26:48] fish oh the suns are coming back up
[1:26:51] there's another one on the earth now
[1:26:53] somebody else is doing
[1:26:54] what jesus did or somebody else is doing
[1:26:57] what adam did
[1:26:59] go tell everybody it's close at hand
[1:27:03] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:27:08] and we have a down payment of that
[1:27:11] fullness
[1:27:12] the birth is a down payment healing is a
[1:27:14] long payment you know
[1:27:17] but everybody said how could y'all feel
[1:27:18] for the rapture if you guys are not fit
[1:27:20] for divine healing
[1:27:21] so it means divine healing is a forties

[1:28:08] a familiar quote you could take some
[1:28:09] more
[1:28:12] keep the motors coming you're only going
[1:28:15] to get out of it what you put into it
[1:28:18] oh so keep on worshiping keep on
[1:28:20] praising
[1:28:22] oh hallelujah get into position get into
[1:28:25] your position as a worshiper
[1:28:26] get into your position as a believer
[1:28:28] because god could only prove his word by
[1:28:31] believers so you have to be in a
[1:28:33] position where you throw doubt aside
[1:28:36] throw fear aside throw unbelief aside
[1:28:39] and recognize listen
[1:28:43] i don't have to take what the devil give
[1:28:45] me you know this is not my position
[1:28:48] like what over preach about a prodigal
[1:28:50] son
[1:28:51] the political son end up out opposition
[1:28:55] until he came to himself where he
[1:28:58] realized nobody told him
[1:29:00] it wasn't a preacher came to him he came
[1:29:02] to himself
[1:29:03] he's had to remember wait a minute wait
[1:29:04] a minute wait a minute
[1:29:06] i've had better food i've had better
[1:29:09] clothes
[1:29:10] there have been better moments than i go
[1:29:12] into right now so he came to himself
[1:29:14] and realized i have to arise in other
[1:29:16] words i have to change my position
[1:29:19] so you have to realize yourself you need
[1:29:21] to change your position
[1:29:23] if you not having a shout you're
[1:29:24] supposed to change your position
[1:29:26] you're not having a joy as opposed to
[1:29:28] change your position
[1:29:29] stop doing certain things start doing
[1:29:31] certain things and do it now
[1:29:33] don't wait till you go back home don't
[1:29:35] wait till the convention is over
[1:29:36] change it today claim it today
[1:29:40] you can't change yesterday you can't
[1:29:42] change last month
[1:29:43] but right now you can lift your hands
[1:29:45] and you could defy gravity
[1:29:47] you can lift your hands maybe you didn't
[1:29:49] lift your hands for a long time
[1:29:51] we're gonna lift your hands and defy
[1:29:52] gravity take a different position
[1:29:55] maybe you're sitting now for a long time
[1:29:57] but you could change your position
[1:29:58] and get to your feet and give it give a
[1:30:01] little movement
[1:30:02] let the devil know that you're down but
[1:30:04] you're not out let the devil
[1:30:06] know he still have a fight in you let
[1:30:08] the devil know i'm not gonna give up
[1:30:10] i'm not gonna backslide i'm gonna get
[1:30:12] into my position
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:16] positionally placed for the final
[1:30:19] showdown
[1:30:21] oh you may be seated we know this quote
[1:30:25] from adoption tell me my brother tell me
[1:30:27] my sister
[1:30:28] when was the time that the sons of god
[1:30:31] was ever to be made manifested outside
[1:30:33] of this time now you know this goal
[1:30:35] right
[1:30:36] when were there ever a time in the
[1:30:38] history
[1:30:39] there was to manifest the time to
[1:30:41] deliver all nature
[1:30:43] nature the nature itself is groaning
[1:30:46] waiting for the time of the
[1:30:47] manifestation now listen to it at this
[1:30:50] part why
[1:30:51] before the atonement was made one
[1:30:54] before the holy ghost was poured out to
[1:30:57] before all the old testament on down
[1:30:59] there
[1:31:00] there couldn't have been manifestations
[1:31:03] so but ibraham made it clear that
[1:31:05] throughout all the old testament
[1:31:08] throughout before the atonement was made
[1:31:10] before the holy ghost was poured out
[1:31:12] you couldn't preach this message
[1:31:17] so this messages tied to the holy ghost
[1:31:19] being poured out
[1:31:20] [Music]
[1:31:23] it had to wait till this time now
[1:31:26] all things has been brought now we talk
[1:31:29] about all things so
[1:31:30] this coat has so much laid in there
[1:31:31] because took on all things
[1:31:33] and it was every mystery every truth
[1:31:36] every loose end coming shaping up to a
[1:31:39] headstone
[1:31:40] so we're talking about now that that
[1:31:42] honing spot now
[1:31:44] that holy ghost to the
[1:31:46] manifestation of the sons of god coming
[1:31:49] back
[1:31:50] and listen and the spirit of god coming
[1:31:53] into these men so perfectly
[1:31:56] not not one day you're up when they are
[1:31:58] down you don't know if you believe you
[1:31:59] don't if you don't believe
[1:32:01] you don't if you're accepted no so
[1:32:03] perfectly
[1:32:04] until their ministry will be so
[1:32:07] close like christ till it will
[1:32:10] join him and his church together
[1:32:13] that's your prophecy that's what's
[1:32:15] unfolding and that's what's happening
[1:32:17] now
[1:32:17] can the church say amen oh
[1:32:20] hallelujah hallelujah so he said a few
[1:32:23] things he said before the atonement
[1:32:26] before the holy ghost through the old
[1:32:28] testament in other words
[1:32:30] when you read the old testament and you
[1:32:31] see different manifestations
[1:32:33] and different people having great
[1:32:35] miracles it was a taste
[1:32:38] of what adam lost but it was like a
[1:32:41] temporary job
[1:32:44] it's like you had it for a little while
[1:32:46] but it couldn't be permanent
[1:32:48] so that's why in the old testament they
[1:32:50] have to offer the high priest have to go
[1:32:52] every year
[1:32:54] because there was no permanent sacrifice
[1:32:57] but when the atonement anybody with me
[1:33:00] when jesus come no longer you have to go
[1:33:03] every year
[1:33:05] anybody with me this morning
[1:33:08] hallelujah getting into position so god
[1:33:12] is talking about moving from
[1:33:13] a temporary position of having a little
[1:33:16] experience and
[1:33:17] and having a little touch and and having
[1:33:19] and you feel something
[1:33:21] to this becoming a permanent thing
[1:33:24] could you imagine that think of the
[1:33:27] greatest joy you ever had
[1:33:28] as a word is coming to you and your
[1:33:30] spiritual experience
[1:33:32] and you went through where you you fell
[1:33:34] from that into into dealing with natural
[1:33:36] things of life
[1:33:38] think of not falling from that state
[1:33:41] think about being in the presence all
[1:33:43] the time
[1:33:44] think of the holy ghost moving through
[1:33:46] you all the time
[1:33:48] you're not taking no taught away you see
[1:33:50] because the holy ghost giving you the
[1:33:51] right words at the right time
[1:33:52] telling you where to go how to move how
[1:33:54] to live how to act oh come on now can
[1:33:56] the church say amen
[1:33:59] oh hallelujah
[1:34:03] i just want to you know i love bible
[1:34:05] studies so i want to touch two
[1:34:06] scriptures before
[1:34:08] i push forward have a too
[1:34:12] and verse one i will stand upon my watch
[1:34:17] that watch his position
[1:34:20] and i'm bringing this here because a lot
[1:34:22] of people this year in particular i'm
[1:34:24] speaking to young people
[1:34:26] maybe some old people too
[1:34:30] this year was a different year for
[1:34:31] churches
[1:34:35] people who were used to a certain normal
[1:34:38] approach have been forced to adapt
[1:34:42] forced to adjust
[1:34:46] the tutor hasn't stopped working
[1:34:53] the tutor has not been under quarantine
[1:34:57] the tutor is not social distancing
[1:35:02] so the tutor is operating and he's
[1:35:04] moving from house to house
[1:35:09] i don't know if you have stayed in your
[1:35:10] position in the word in the spirit
[1:35:15] have you been on watch have you been
[1:35:18] conscious that the tutor
[1:35:20] is still on his job
[1:35:23] anybody with me
[1:35:29] so when i saw this as like i would stand
[1:35:32] upon my watch
[1:35:33] or i was standing in my position i will
[1:35:36] haul ground i'm not going to backslide
[1:35:37] i'm not going to give up
[1:35:39] and set me up on the tower the tower is
[1:35:42] high because
[1:35:43] it allows you to see out there and see
[1:35:44] the uncommon storm
[1:35:46] the uncommon danger to your home to your
[1:35:48] family to the church to your life
[1:35:50] to your prayer life oh this is not the
[1:35:53] kind of convention
[1:35:54] words now
[1:35:58] because it's about conduct and order and
[1:35:59] behavior not your shout
[1:36:02] out not your attendance it's your
[1:36:04] conduct your behavior
[1:36:06] i will stand upon my watch singular
[1:36:10] when nobody else is watching you on your
[1:36:11] watch you
[1:36:13] in your position you at home on the
[1:36:15] internet
[1:36:16] you at home have the choice to connect
[1:36:18] to the service or not
[1:36:20] and set me upon the tower and will watch
[1:36:22] to see what he will say unto me
[1:36:24] and what i shall answer when i am
[1:36:26] reproved
[1:36:28] and the lord answered me and said write
[1:36:30] a vision
[1:36:31] and make it plain upon tables that he
[1:36:33] may run that read it
[1:36:35] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[1:36:37] time but at the end it shall speak and
[1:36:40] not lie doorway
[1:36:41] wait for it because it will surely come
[1:36:44] it will not tarry many people
[1:36:46] have gotten calm and relaxed in the
[1:36:48] message
[1:36:49] but the prophecy is here the time is
[1:36:52] here and the time is at hand
[1:36:54] oh give the lord a hand of praise
[1:36:57] [Applause]
[1:37:01] i'm not going to be too much longer with
[1:37:04] you
[1:37:06] i have a scripture here in chronicles i
[1:37:08] want to encourage you with
[1:37:09] before we move on second chronicles 20
[1:37:12] and verse 1.
[1:37:14] and it came to pass after this also that
[1:37:17] the children of moab
[1:37:19] and the children of ammon and with them
[1:37:22] other beside the ammonites came against
[1:37:25] jehoshaphater battle
[1:37:29] then there came some that told
[1:37:30] jehoshaphat saying they commit
[1:37:32] a great multitude against thee from
[1:37:35] beyond the sea
[1:37:36] on this side syria and behold they be
[1:37:40] in hazotama which is in gedi
[1:37:43] and jehoshaphat feared and set himself
[1:37:46] to seek the lord
[1:37:48] and proclaim a fast throughout all judah
[1:37:53] and judah gathered themselves together
[1:37:55] to ask help of the lord
[1:37:57] even out of all the cities of judah they
[1:38:00] came to seek the lord
[1:38:02] and in this meeting we have come from
[1:38:04] all cities and
[1:38:05] countries to seek the lord it's not to
[1:38:08] have a good service
[1:38:10] but we need to hear from the lord
[1:38:12] anybody with me this evening
[1:38:15] judah gathered themselves together to
[1:38:17] ask help of the lord
[1:38:19] they didn't look within they were
[1:38:21] looking to the lord
[1:38:22] even out of all the cities of judah they
[1:38:25] came to seek the lord
[1:38:27] verse 5 and jehoshaphat stood in the
[1:38:30] congregation of judah and jerusalem
[1:38:33] in the house of the lord before the new
[1:38:35] court
[1:38:36] and said oh lord god of our fathers and
[1:38:39] that's how i feel this evening
[1:38:40] oh lord god of our fathers are thou
[1:38:44] art not thou god in heaven
[1:38:48] is that how you feel and rulers not thou
[1:38:50] over all the kingdoms of the heathen
[1:38:53] so jehoshaphat begin to train again now
[1:38:56] and in this hand is there not power and
[1:38:59] might
[1:38:59] so that none is able to withstand thee
[1:39:02] you see where my faith comes from
[1:39:04] that no weapon formed against you can
[1:39:06] prosper
[1:39:09] verse seven add not thou our god who did
[1:39:12] is drive out the inhabitants of this
[1:39:14] land
[1:39:15] before thy people israel and gave us it
[1:39:18] to the seed of abraham thy friend
[1:39:20] forever
[1:39:21] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:24] oh that's how i feel this evening and
[1:39:26] they dwell therein
[1:39:28] and have built your sanctuary variant
[1:39:30] for thy name
[1:39:31] saying if when evil commit upon us as a
[1:39:35] sword
[1:39:35] judgment or pestilence or famine we
[1:39:38] stand before this house and in thy
[1:39:40] presence
[1:39:41] for thy name is in this house and cry
[1:39:44] out to thee in our affliction then thou
[1:39:47] wilt hear and help
[1:39:48] so he is reminding god of what god did
[1:39:51] he was reminding god of the promise he
[1:39:54] made
[1:39:55] he is reminding god of how you kept us
[1:39:57] through the years and
[1:39:58] how you took your sins the prophet left
[1:40:01] you took us through the 60s and you you
[1:40:02] took us through the 70s and you took us
[1:40:05] through the 80s and you you took us

[1:40:08] roads but you have
[1:40:09] always been there for us we have had
[1:40:12] tough moments but you have always been a
[1:40:14] deliverer
[1:40:15] and we have always stood with you
[1:40:18] anybody with me you have always stood
[1:40:22] with us
[1:40:23] after all of his reminding god he said
[1:40:26] your hand is not too short
[1:40:28] you know you have the power now he comes
[1:40:30] to bring his petition
[1:40:31] he comes to get a solution because he
[1:40:34] don't know what to do
[1:40:35] he don't have opposition he is not in
[1:40:37] his right place anybody with me is
[1:40:39] heathen
[1:40:40] and now behold the children of ammon
[1:40:43] and moab and monsieur whom the wood has
[1:40:47] not let israel
[1:40:48] invade when they came out of the land of
[1:40:51] egypt
[1:40:52] but they turned from them and destroyed
[1:40:54] them not behold i see
[1:40:56] how they reward us to come to cast
[1:40:59] us out of thy possession in other words
[1:41:02] jehoshaphat is saying these people how
[1:41:05] you
[1:41:06] did you didn't allow us to attack them
[1:41:08] you spared them
[1:41:10] you left them alone but no they repaid
[1:41:13] us by coming to attack us
[1:41:15] anybody with me oh

[1:55:24] of seer
[1:55:25] everyone held to destroy another

[1:55:32] groups that remain fight and kill one
[1:55:33] another
[1:55:37] you can't fight like that but the lord

[1:56:09] they went to the elevated position by
[1:56:11] the cannons they want to see the whole
[1:56:13] tapestry the whole plan of how it unfold
[1:56:16] when judah came towards a watchtower in
[1:56:18] the wilderness
[1:56:19] they looked unto the multitude and
[1:56:22] behold there were dead bodies fallen to
[1:56:23] the earth
[1:56:24] and none escaped not once
[1:56:28] just like the egyptian you see today you
[1:56:30] see them no more forever
[1:56:33] and when jehoshaphates people came to
[1:56:35] take away the spoil of them
[1:56:37] they found among them in abundance
[1:56:39] bought riches with their dead bodies and
[1:56:41] precious jewels
[1:56:42] which is stripped away for themselves
[1:56:44] more than they could carry away
[1:56:46] and they were three days in gathering
[1:56:48] the spoil
[1:56:50] you didn't fight the battle but yes
[1:56:52] collecting for three days
[1:56:54] you collecting for three days the reward
[1:56:57] of obedience
[1:56:58] the reward for worship the reward for
[1:57:01] obeying the prophets
[1:57:03] the reward for following the law's
[1:57:04] instruction the reward for having faith
[1:57:07] to take a position against all odds when
[1:57:10] the enemy is turning you in the face
[1:57:12] listen i'm reading scripture more than
[1:57:15] they could carry away
[1:57:16] and they were three days in gathering of
[1:57:19] the spoil it was so much
[1:57:21] when the bible tells you brother eclipse
[1:57:23] it was so much
[1:57:24] don't you want to shout and worship and
[1:57:26] obey god
[1:57:27] and follow his word because he will
[1:57:29] bless you he will fight battles for you
[1:57:31] he wants to place you so he can bless
[1:57:34] you you are his son
[1:57:35] you are his daughter you are his child
[1:57:37] he loves you
[1:57:38] he cares for you
[1:57:44] [Music]
[1:57:47] hallelujah my my
[1:57:51] and on the fourth day they assembled
[1:57:53] themselves in the valley of barakah
[1:57:56] for there they blessed the lord
[1:57:57] therefore the name of the same place was
[1:57:59] called the valley of barakah
[1:58:01] unto this day then they returned every
[1:58:03] man of judah
[1:58:04] and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the
[1:58:06] forefront of them
[1:58:08] to go again to jerusalem with joy for
[1:58:10] the lord
[1:58:11] had made them to rejoice over their
[1:58:14] enemies
[1:58:15] and they came to jerusalem with soul
[1:58:17] trees and harms
[1:58:19] and trumpets unto the house of the lord
[1:58:21] and listen to this last part this person
[1:58:23] finish it for me and the fear of god
[1:58:27] was on all the kingdoms of those
[1:58:29] countries
[1:58:32] when they had heard that the lord fought
[1:58:35] against the enemies of israel
[1:58:38] so the testimony went out that these
[1:58:40] children of israel
[1:58:41] have a god who fight in their battles
[1:58:43] with them so
[1:58:44] fear was on all the countries you talk
[1:58:48] about having nuclear weapons
[1:58:50] fear was on these countries the
[1:58:52] tournaments are just walking
[1:58:53] and countries are afraid they don't want
[1:58:55] to mess with these people
[1:58:57] because messing with these people means
[1:58:59] messing with their god
[1:59:00] the devil got to know he can't mess with
[1:59:03] you
[1:59:03] because when he messes with you he
[1:59:06] messes with your god
[1:59:08] can the church give the lord a shout out
[1:59:11] [Applause]
[1:59:14] praise
[1:59:17] i want to encourage your faith
[1:59:19] hallelujah i know you would have been
[1:59:20] preached through
[1:59:21] so i just want to encourage your faith

[1:59:24] out
[1:59:26] oh the musician can get ready hallelujah
[1:59:31] that's a running true scripture so eve
[1:59:34] adam
[1:59:34] fell out of position
[1:59:38] we talk about being positioned in place
[1:59:40] right we say it can be back in position
[1:59:41] or place in position
[1:59:43] if unless you were out opposition
[1:59:46] so eve was out opposition because of the
[1:59:49] fall
[1:59:50] joseph when joseph is dying he tell them
[1:59:54] listen
[1:59:55] take my bones with you right now we're
[1:59:58] out of position
[2:00:00] resurrection is coming where we are now
[2:00:02] so makes one carry my bones
[2:00:04] into position because when resurrection
[2:00:06] come
[2:00:07] even if i'm dead i want to be in
[2:00:09] position even if i'm dead
[2:00:11] i want to be in position oh god help me
[2:00:14] to get into my position
[2:00:15] by placing christ anybody with me we get
[2:00:18] into the home stretch now
[2:00:20] samson during the pandemic
[2:00:24] he lost his way samson during the
[2:00:27] pandemic
[2:00:28] he lost his eyes samson had a promise
[2:00:32] of how to live oh god but samson lost
[2:00:35] sight of the vision
[2:00:36] he lost sight of his purpose he fell
[2:00:39] from grace
[2:00:41] you remember we said it at the beginning
[2:00:43] with your position
[2:00:45] it has restrictions things you can do so
[2:00:48] there were consequences
[2:00:50] but his position pot was being
[2:00:54] restored while he was grinding at the
[2:00:56] mill
[2:00:58] hallelujah his luck was growing back
[2:01:02] so he was getting back into position
[2:01:05] but for his great ministry to be
[2:01:06] unfolded he said for the final showdown
[2:01:10] he said lead me into position
[2:01:13] lead me to the pillars that holding up
[2:01:16] this world economy

[2:01:24] happening here he said when you put me
[2:01:26] there i'll be all right
[2:01:27] and when he was in position it couldn't
[2:01:29] happen before
[2:01:30] he couldn't ask once more lord when he
[2:01:33] was in the dungeon
[2:01:34] but when he was in position he said lord
[2:01:37] once more lord once more lord
[2:01:40] oh come on now you see a why you need to
[2:01:43] be in position

[2:03:12] i can't just die here i've been in the
[2:03:14] message all these years
[2:03:16] why am i sitting down it's better if if
[2:03:19] if
[2:03:19] if i stay here i'll die if i go inside i
[2:03:21] die
[2:03:22] i want to change position i'm willing to
[2:03:24] go out and face the enemy
[2:03:28] [Music]
[2:03:32] oh hallelujah may your faith rise this
[2:03:35] morning
[2:03:36] may you take that kind of it not this
[2:03:37] way in other words if i'm going no not
[2:03:39] this way
[2:03:40] not this way i'm not going to let the
[2:03:43] pandemic take my joy and i'm going to
[2:03:44] let
[2:03:45] losing my job take my joy and i'm going
[2:03:46] to let what happened in my business take
[2:03:48] my joy
[2:03:49] i'm not going to like how many years the
[2:03:51] lord allowed this to go and to take my
[2:03:52] joy
[2:03:53] i'm getting into a position
[2:03:56] [Music]
[2:03:57] even god had to change his position
[2:04:04] he was up in glory and there was only so
[2:04:07] much vehicle if he could have done there
[2:04:11] he had 10 prophets he had placed kings
[2:04:14] he had fought battles for them just like
[2:04:17] what we read with jehoshaphat
[2:04:18] but for this battle for this showdown
[2:04:22] he had to get in position he had to get
[2:04:25] into place
[2:04:26] so he left glory and not only changed
[2:04:28] position but changed form
[2:04:30] he had to come as a man he had to go
[2:04:33] through a process
[2:04:34] he had to go to a place of trying he had
[2:04:37] to pass the tests up
[2:04:38] he had to be adopted this is my beloved
[2:04:42] son
[2:04:43] in whom i'm well pleased hear ye him
[2:04:46] he had to pass the same test you have to
[2:04:48] pass he had to pass the same test
[2:04:50] i have to pass he had to get the same
[2:04:53] approval you have to get
[2:04:54] he has to get the same approval i have
[2:04:56] to get
[2:04:59] and the countdown was on
[2:05:03] peace be still a place son on the earth
[2:05:07] an adopted son on the earth and then
[2:05:09] there was this calvary showdown
[2:05:12] where the atonement would be made you
[2:05:13] know we read the quote before the
[2:05:15] atonement
[2:05:16] before the holy ghost all through the
[2:05:17] old testament there couldn't be a
[2:05:19] manifestation
[2:05:20] until now i'm walking through it right
[2:05:22] now
[2:05:24] and after the victory at calvary we know
[2:05:27] it
[2:05:28] there was a showdown in hell this
[2:05:30] adopted son
[2:05:32] with full power full authority
[2:05:35] all that god was was in him he left this
[2:05:38] realm
[2:05:39] went down to hell he didn't have to ask
[2:05:42] he didn't have to have a negotiation
[2:05:44] there was no need for conversation
[2:05:46] he just took the keys of death and hell
[2:05:50] and in so doing he weakened satan's
[2:05:52] position
[2:05:57] this was satan's second emotion
[2:06:00] because he was kicked out of heaven and
[2:06:02] he was operating
[2:06:04] and he had keys he had locked up job
[2:06:08] locked up jonah locked up moses locked
[2:06:11] up david
[2:06:12] but when jesus came he took the keys
[2:06:18] you know how embarrassing that was with
[2:06:20] the devil you want to understand why
[2:06:22] satan's so
[2:06:23] mad now he's walking around he walking
[2:06:25] around hell with no keys
[2:06:27] even the demons who looked up to the
[2:06:29] devil start to look at him funny
[2:06:34] because keys represent authority keys
[2:06:36] represent power
[2:06:37] and all that the devil had left was keys
[2:06:40] of death and hell
[2:06:42] so no
[2:06:45] grave where is your victory because the
[2:06:47] mighty conqueror
[2:06:50] we took the keys what was god doing he
[2:06:54] was opening doors
[2:06:55] he was preparing for the manifestation
[2:06:58] of the sons of god
[2:06:59] he was making it possible for more like
[2:07:02] him
[2:07:03] give the lord a shout our praise
[2:07:04] [Applause]
[2:07:09] he may be seated i'm trying to finish
[2:07:11] the devil had to have an emergency
[2:07:12] meeting
[2:07:13] to figure out how to keep people in
[2:07:15] bondage because he couldn't lock them up
[2:07:17] anymore
[2:07:18] that's why i could see it tonight you
[2:07:19] can go free if you want to go free
[2:07:21] that door just look like it's locked it
[2:07:24] looks like it's locked
[2:07:26] but it's really open oh hallelujah when
[2:07:28] jesus walked through
[2:07:30] he unlocked those doors he unlocked
[2:07:32] those doors the devil can't hold you
[2:07:34] your sickness cannot hold you your
[2:07:36] unbelief cannot hold you
[2:07:38] no demon could hold you house of hell
[2:07:40] give way
[2:07:41] to the name of the lord jesus christ you
[2:07:44] have no power
[2:07:45] over the sons and daughters of the
[2:07:46] living god give the lord a shout our
[2:07:48] praise
[2:07:49] [Applause]
[2:07:52] you may be seated satan
[2:07:55] had witnessed many miracles over the
[2:07:57] years hundreds of years but nobody
[2:07:59] nobody had ever taken his keys
[2:08:07] nobody had ever walked in and walked
[2:08:10] back out
[2:08:11] oh my you wanna know i'm so happy
[2:08:15] that in the midst of my struggles to
[2:08:17] know that jesus said because i live
[2:08:19] you are gonna live also the same words
[2:08:21] that i do
[2:08:22] you are going to do also he said i go to
[2:08:25] prepare a place for you
[2:08:26] that that where i am you will be also
[2:08:29] he left and left a body and left out
[2:08:32] space
[2:08:33] for us that day without us cannot be
[2:08:35] made perfect
[2:08:36] to think that all of this has been
[2:08:38] leading up to this great climax
[2:08:40] to a final showdown where what abraham
[2:08:44] couldn't do
[2:08:44] and elijah couldn't do and the prophets
[2:08:47] couldn't do and jesus didn't want to do
[2:08:49] because he's going to leave his bride to
[2:08:51] give the final knockout punch
[2:08:53] in the final showdown to switch this
[2:08:56] whole world up
[2:08:57] because we are not going to reign in
[2:08:58] heaven we are going to reign on this
[2:09:00] earth
[2:09:00] this is our jurisdiction and the devil
[2:09:03] has squatted for way too long
[2:09:05] but i'm happy to know that the sons of
[2:09:07] god are coming back
[2:09:14] in the message who is god brother
[2:09:16] abraham said what adam lost in the fall
[2:09:19] christ restored in his debt and god
[2:09:22] allowed all these messages and these
[2:09:25] messengers
[2:09:26] and these church ages i'm closing to
[2:09:28] bring us to this spot
[2:09:30] that we can fulfill that quote that
[2:09:31] brother branham said now is the time for
[2:09:33] the manifestation
[2:09:35] of the sons of god at thy word he said
[2:09:38] after sons there's placing of sons
[2:09:41] or the adoption of sons so don't be
[2:09:45] satisfied friends so just be a son you
[2:09:47] want to be a placed
[2:09:48] son you want to be a son in position and
[2:09:51] that could only come
[2:09:53] by character that could only come by
[2:09:56] character development i have so much but
[2:09:58] i want to close out
[2:09:59] when i plot to close out but about him
[2:10:01] said what places you
[2:10:03] is your conductor whoa
[2:10:07] my my my my my hallelujah
[2:10:11] i just want to read that to close out
[2:10:13] and hear him with random said it's your
[2:10:15] character
[2:10:16] your conduct that gives god confidence
[2:10:19] in you
[2:10:20] the reason we haven't got the great
[2:10:22] church marching on today
[2:10:23] is because god can't find people listen
[2:10:26] to put his confidence
[2:10:28] in the holy spirits keep saying they're
[2:10:30] tearing up
[2:10:31] they're breaking up they're doing this
[2:10:33] they're off on the line
[2:10:34] stay with god's word that's god's truth
[2:10:38] that's the pattern that's the blueprint
[2:10:40] that's the reason the church today has
[2:10:42] got all kinds of isms
[2:10:43] and everything in it because they don't
[2:10:45] stay with the word
[2:10:47] if they won't listen to the holy spirit
[2:10:49] the holy spirit won't testify of
[2:10:51] one other thing but god's word what
[2:10:54] places you
[2:10:55] is your character oh let me find a place
[2:10:58] to close how do you begin to play
[2:10:59] something softly
[2:11:01] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah just worship
[2:11:05] him just worship him
[2:11:06] let's worship him just worship him oh
[2:11:10] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:11:12] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:11:15] oh my god and the greatest battle ever
[2:11:19] fought
[2:11:20] but abraham said
[2:11:24] in fact let me read from influence first
[2:11:26] he said the great battles back there
[2:11:28] had got the loose ends hanging out
[2:11:31] just over many battles he had a battle
[2:11:34] of jericho this battle all the way down
[2:11:35] to ecclesial battles
[2:11:37] had got the loose ends hanging out so
[2:11:40] now he's going beyond now
[2:11:41] he's going beyond just the atonement and
[2:11:44] and and the holy ghost pouring out and
[2:11:45] he's coming out to tanner these loose
[2:11:47] hands
[2:11:48] only after this great prophet comes down
[2:11:50] it ought to be all wrapped up together
[2:11:52] in this last age
[2:11:54] then when that sounds an angel come down
[2:11:56] and say time shall be no more
[2:11:59] whoo we are here brother sister we had a
[2:12:02] time
[2:12:03] let's let the holy spirit influence us
[2:12:06] to the word of god
[2:12:08] from the greatest bat level fought and
[2:12:10] the only thing that he's waiting for
[2:12:12] is for his army to get their position
