[53:35] upon his head and his face as it were
[53:38] the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire
[53:42] and he had in his hand a little book
[53:43] open and he set his right foot upon the
[53:46] sea and his left foot on the earth and
[53:50] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[53:53] roared and when he had cried seven
[53:56] Thunders utter their voices and when the
[53:59] seven Thunders had uttered their voices
[54:01] I was about to write and I Heard a Voice
[54:04] from Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[54:06] things which is seven tunders uttered
[54:09] and write them not and the angel which I
[54:12] saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[54:15] Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and
[54:18] swear by him that liveth forever and
[54:20] ever who created heaven and the things
[54:23] that therein are and the earth and the
[54:25] things that therein are and the Sea and
[54:27] the things which are therein that there
[54:29] should be time no longer but in the days
[54:33] of the voice of the seventh angel when

[58:31] coming back to me word and spirit word
[58:34] and spirit word and spirit and that just
[58:36] keep riding me riding me all week and I
[58:39] didn't know what it was so when I come
[58:40] in here Wednesday night I felt like God
[58:42] opened up a door even more in the word
[58:45] amen and so as it contined to roll on
[58:47] into the week word and spirit word and
[58:50] spirit I said God it has to be something
[58:51] about this I began to pray about it I
[58:53] said Lord show it to me I don't know
[58:56] what it is the Bible said If any man
[58:58] lack wisdom let him ask God so I asked
[59:01] him praise God but I didn't hear
[59:02] anything kept on waiting and believing
[59:04] on the Lord amen and then all of a
[59:07] sudden this is my testimony I was
[59:09] getting ready to take a bath at 10:18
[59:11] p.m. and the Holy Spirit spoke something
[59:14] to my heart he's praise God Amen this is
[59:16] Friday 15 March 2024 and the following
[59:19] inspiration came to me it said the true
[59:22] worshippers shall come forth from under
[59:25] the Seven Seals
[59:26] and when they do there will be a uniting
[59:30] of the word and the spirit together oh
[59:34] hallelujah oh the true worshippers
[59:37] that's you here this morning who under
[59:39] the seven seal under your messenger are

[59:47] the word and the spirit together oh
[59:52] hallelujah oh Luther at w at mechanic
[59:55] and Dynamics Wesley had mechanics and
[59:58] Dynamics but the bride today she's
[1:00:01] waiting on her Dynamics to take her up

[1:00:44] morning oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:48] hallelujah oh do you believe this
[1:00:50] morning
[1:00:52] amen amen so I thought well this is it
[1:00:56] this is the
[1:00:57] formula to to get to this revival that
[1:01:00] we're trying to get to to bring forth a
[1:01:03] true bride in the last day it has to
[1:01:05] come back to a formula it can't be
[1:01:08] Spirit alone the spirit fell in 1906 but
[1:01:12] the word wasn't revealed the word wasn't
[1:01:14] brought you a prophet yet so all they
[1:01:16] had was a baptism of the Holy Ghost all
[1:01:19] they had was the gifts all they had was
[1:01:21] speaking in tongues and falling on the
[1:01:23] floor praise God and receiving the Holy
[1:01:25] Ghost that's all right but the prophet
[1:01:27] said the baptism of the Holy Ghost made
[1:01:29] a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come
[1:01:33] down in Perfection and pick you up this
[1:01:36] morning and perfect You by his holy
[1:01:40] spirit oh by the word coming into you
[1:01:44] forming the word image and then the
[1:01:46] spirit is going to come and write that
[1:01:48] word in you and bring it to life it's
[1:01:52] not you that's a Believer it's a word in
[1:01:54] you that's a Believer this morning
[1:01:57] that's the reason why you shout that's
[1:01:59] the reason why you put on your shoes
[1:02:01] this morning you got up and you took a
[1:02:04] bath and you praised God for the day and
[1:02:08] you came in here it's a word in you
[1:02:11] doing that that's not you that's not
[1:02:13] your flesh there's millions of people
[1:02:16] have other things to do on a Sunday but
[1:02:19] you made it your business to come into
[1:02:21] the house of God because God has a call
[1:02:24] in your life and the devil is a liar
[1:02:26] this morning God is here the True Light
[1:02:29] is here to blast the Devils out of you
[1:02:32] and to give you the Holy Ghost and to
[1:02:35] pour his love pour his fire pour His
[1:02:38] presence somebody say Amen somebody lift
[1:02:41] your hands somebody praise God this
[1:02:44] morning let the redeem say
[1:02:47] so
[1:02:48] w hallelujah praise God the holy spirit
[1:02:52] is here and he's here to bless you this
[1:02:55] morning
[1:02:56] oh
[1:02:57] Hallelujah Oh
[1:03:00] my Jesus is
[1:03:02] speaking Jesus speaks to the woman of
[1:03:05] the well amen so let's write the word
[1:03:07] this morning amen let's get into it
[1:03:09] Jesus speaks to the woman of the well he
[1:03:11] keeps telling her about worship he keep
[1:03:13] telling her about true worship is coming
[1:03:15] forth in this scripture that we just
[1:03:17] read Jesus actually begin to connect
[1:03:20] truth and worship together do you
[1:03:22] understand that it's not just worship
[1:03:25] but truth and spirit have to come
[1:03:27] together in order for you to be a true
[1:03:29] worshipper it has to be the word and the
[1:03:32] spirit together mechanics and Dynamics
[1:03:35] together oh we had the word for over 50
[1:03:39] years in this message since a prophet
[1:03:41] died in 1965 and went on he revealed all
[1:03:44] of the word we have all of the word this
[1:03:46] morning but where is the spirit where is
[1:03:49] a supernatural where is the anointing to
[1:03:52] accompany that word right now you suffer
[1:03:56] the reproach of barness you are saying
[1:03:58] it is coming it is coming it's not here
[1:04:01] yet but I believe that it's going to
[1:04:03] happen but that takes the spirit of God
[1:04:07] the same God that move upon the face of
[1:04:10] the waters the same God that moved upon
[1:04:13] Sarah's Barren womb the same God that
[1:04:16] came to Mary and said Thou Art blessed
[1:04:19] and highly favor the same God he said I
[1:04:22] am the Lord I created a human bodyy and
[1:04:25] I can bring you back from whatever
[1:04:28] disease is afflicting your body I can
[1:04:31] raise you up for such a time as this the
[1:04:33] same God that God is here this morning
[1:04:37] that God is no respect to our persons
[1:04:39] the only thing that God wants to see
[1:04:41] this morning is when the son of man
[1:04:43] cometh shall he find faith on the earth
[1:04:46] do you have faith this morning then
[1:04:48] somebody say

[1:05:32] certain sound this morning it is not an
[1:05:35] uncertain sound it is not an accident it
[1:05:38] is not a floops it is not a VAP it is a
[1:05:41] certain sound and when you hear it you
[1:05:44] will know your name is on the book and

[1:06:17] worship oh my so stay on fire this
[1:06:20] morning
[1:06:22] amen God is a spirit he said he's a
[1:06:25] Spirit he's not your flesh he's not your
[1:06:28] friend in the corner he's not the
[1:06:30] Cornerstone manager no no no no no he's
[1:06:33] a spirit he's unseen by the naked eye

[1:06:39] see him with your eyes you can't smell
[1:06:41] him with your nose you can't touch him
[1:06:43] with your hand that's because he's a
[1:06:45] spirit so the only way to contact that

[1:06:51] that God give to the believer to contact
[1:06:53] the spirit out there it's faith faith is
[1:06:57] the only thing is the only currency that
[1:07:00] God will accept this morning and if you

[1:11:05] happen the truth of God's word had to be
[1:11:09] sown throughout all the Earth isn't that
[1:11:12] right all these years so that when the
[1:11:14] Spirit Fall it'll be a uniting of the
[1:11:17] word that was sown by Malachi for
[1:11:20] uniting with the spirit together to
[1:11:22] produce true worshippers which is you
[1:11:24] here this morning oh and you have
[1:11:27] received the word just like Mary did

[1:11:32] Lord bless and highly favored Mary said
[1:11:35] be it done unto me according to Thy word
[1:11:39] and that was it right there she received
[1:11:41] the word from the Angel and the moment

[1:12:39] destination it's got to make it to
[1:12:42] Perfection you see that's one
[1:12:44] destination not two and three and five
[1:12:46] and six no one destination it's got to
[1:12:49] go back to its maker again it's got to
[1:12:53] go back to its creator and the Creator

[1:55:49] we begin to see God's favor upon Joseph
[1:55:52] nothing against Joseph but it was God
[1:55:55] working his way out of Joseph God knew
[1:55:58] where he wanted Joseph he had to drive
[1:56:00] him out from among his Brethren Joseph
[1:56:03] had to be rejected he had to be despised
[1:56:06] he had to go through hard stuff oh but
[1:56:09] though he slay me yet will I trust him

[2:30:21] poor Irish heart one day he said I was a
[2:30:24] little old sinner he said how could it
[2:30:26] ever do for me he said but I believed
[2:30:30] that it was a certain sound and he said
[2:30:33] I accepted it and he said and I am a
[2:30:35] witness that it is true and many of you
[2:30:39] here this morning are witnesses that it
[2:30:42] is true that when the voice of God
[2:30:45] speaks to the individual you can never
[2:30:47] be the same again you can never come to
[2:30:50] church the same way again you can never
[2:30:52] be backslid the same way again because

[2:32:07] uncertain sound anytime Prophet said he

[2:32:37] for this morning is for the power of God
[2:32:40] to strike the church oh the prophet was
[2:32:42] so anointed till days after he had to
[2:32:45] pinch himself he didn't know whether he
[2:32:47] was in a dream or whether he was in a
[2:32:49] vision he said you know the blessings of
[2:32:51] God but you don't know the power of God
[2:32:54] when the power of this church Rises that
[2:32:58] is going to bring the Brethren the women
[2:33:00] won't be able to cook they'll turn over

[2:33:08] Ghost will sweep into the house and
[2:33:10] refill them with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[2:33:13] the little children on the ground
[2:33:16] screaming receiving the Holy Ghost

[2:47:18] how he does it but you're don't going to
[2:47:20] know why he does it oh because you were
[2:47:23] predestinated before the foundation of
[2:47:25] the world because God had a bride in the
[2:47:28] beginning and he's going to have a bride
[2:47:30] in the end to confirm the word that he
[2:47:33] gave to his Prophet Malachi 4 and when

[2:48:13] see what the prophet couldn't get to the
[2:48:15] experience what the prophet longed to
[2:48:17] see the word coming into view coming
[2:48:19] into reality he knew it would come to
[2:48:22] reality he just didn't live to see it
[2:48:24] but he knew it was coming and so do we

[2:48:31] for a fact just as sure as I'm standing
