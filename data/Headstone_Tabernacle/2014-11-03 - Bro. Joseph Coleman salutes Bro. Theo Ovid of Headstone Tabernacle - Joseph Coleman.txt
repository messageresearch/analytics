TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings to my precious friend and brother on the feel of it is wisest Amory and their precious family and all the elders deacons helps his stone tabernacle Trinidad that it has part in this appreciation to our precious brother behold the father says honor to whom his honor and misurkin take this time out to honor our brother and brother Michael my male asked me to say a few words and so for me it's a privilege to say a few words today half-brother feel so but I would like to invite you tension to st. John 13 verse 20 and I'll read it verily verily I say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever I sin receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me may the Lord of the blessing to the reno's war brother Theo well first maybe they read backward brother Brown said about this first scripture st. John 13 2007 to you he receives himself I send it sees me he never sees matrices him that sent me no I'm reading from a spoken word his original seed volume 3 number 2 page 53 and Jesus said he never sees them that I sin perceives me and now them that he sent and them that receives me raise him receives him that sent me wish we had time to laying on that now notice you can only serve God as you as you can only serve God as you do and believe the servants that God sent you the only sort of God on earth see as God's servants that set on earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you so therefore I believe it's self-explanatory it is a reveal word from the spoken word and of course we own all the prophet interpreted and so therefore I believe that to the headstone Tabernacle or that your pastor for the field is a man with divine inspiration for you look around the world and we knew for years that they would not be many that would have divine inspiration and I've been known as for years because brother Brennan has said so so that's why I need me such a privilege to know over the field brother Michael Mike mail brought in to me it was 1981 and Harris and he told me that brother feels a man that has a revelation of loving-kindness so when I heard that while I was very happy they have breakfast they'll be the world lunch and they sit with him and talk with him but you finally very few many would knowledge but very few that are humble and with forgiveness and brother kindness that's the only way you can read the priests seventh under inspiration so then the Lord spoke to me after I met him he told me - this is my testimony to get a hold of brother feel and start putting him into the convention meetings because I want to train him and I said he had to work for him to do so I did that and that's all as we as he preached and came over we became closer and closer and then and that was expanded and the truth as he began to us go out his ministry bless has blessed countless thousands go see the tapes on recopy in Africa in different places in America and so he's come over here to murder - the meetings and people Canada Africa South Africa South America Paula Rico and anyway else he has gone and so then these tapes of copy and his ministry with divine inspiration has blessed countless thousands as I've said belief that God has been preparing brother Ovid for the Ministry of perfection I won't dwell on doctrines and so forth because I know you are well instructed and what we believe so I just want to honor him and so therefore I really thank God for because all of you know me in Trinidad in 1974-75 I trying to bring the inspiration here and then in time of what came back and said be fine that's when well let's say it was rejected by the olive has a hold Trinidad but there were many individual believers later and so I met many medicines there I know many medicines there but I haven't seen anybody come up with dividing interpretation of the word as I have seen this gift in brother field so that's why I thank God for him and I take up this time - I am full stained with the word and straight on the word and he's a man that does not play his no foolishness comes in a pulpit equates to people he said now this open your Bibles and he's not afraid he'll stand alone if he has to and that's what I appreciate about it because I know because I had to do it myself it's just 1961 so therefore I really appreciated the quality they sent him was the gift and God put in appreciate his wife sister Ann Marie for standing by him and I know it's been hard to be there and to be ostracized and and reviled and so forth but the Bible says blessed or he when you are reviled my old man so it's really been countless blessings and so and I certainly appreciate his family and the lies it has been right in his father's footsteps been a blessing to many in Europe and also in Africa and here in America know he has something in land his heart so the morning dear bless you brother feel in your family in a mighty way and I appreciate the people in the headstone tabernacle ear and the brethren the way you stand behind your pastor and God will certainly bless you for this and I think it's a wonderful thing to give a man that deserves it a book he rolls is now rather than wait and give a wreath on is great so I think this is wonderful what you are what you are doing and right now I believe that this my words will be part of a tape of the lead from others so therefore I thank God again to salute him and this awareness no greater honor can die a savior of the stole about a man upon a man and other than to say that I feel that he's part of the ministries of perfection and that in itself wouldn't brother Brown he said many times why you maybe just hold his hand as an illustration you said there won't be no more than that winning then of the head in the fire for ministry and many rather not understand about the powerful ministry this is the the age of adoption so when we come into the age of the adoption the Apostles whenever they were taught by Jesus and when the Holy Spirit fell the person I'm talking about now not to birth like for Matthew no 6 but the person come down in the upper room and fill them with the Holy Ghost and not only fill them inside there's a birth but an quicken and mechanics as well the Grenaa brought up this truth and the rising of the Sun pays 31 days 30 and 32 and many have missed that little revelation and he dropped all and so therefore I feel that our brother here has in this age of adoption has been going about doing this work a pastor and going on the season doing the work over there and many medicine don't accept this fact but it is a fact because if you can find a church on earth today with the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ the original faith the D faith same life same signs same oneness same miracles as they had in the early bride more than us they show it to me if you cannot find it then therefore we have been contending for the faith restored back by Malachi 4 and that's why I say double honor to brother Theo open for standing and catching this revelation then you must contend for it fight for it is stand-in there are you for it and stand up and they'll think you mean you know you think they'll think this no you are contending for the faith not have the contentions but contending and so I just like to read what the Ministry of perfection is and perseverance South Carolina Southern Pines North Carolina 1962 now I believe that there's a church coming into that perfection that ministry of perfection were the officers we apostles prophets teachers passes avenges for the perfecting of the church then passes and teachers now on page 44 such of a perfect man brother bran was reading Ephesians 4:11 through there and he's saying he gets to the work of the ministry and he says the work of the ministry of christ and that's why i say all these different ministers around way as an entity of christ that i have not seen since brother brandon left that's why they were contending for it as Julie exhorted us to do and so therefore I feel that our brother has been contending for it and I feel that God is gonna richly reward him there and in Trinidad with dementia perfection and the man because your perfection will be there for perfecting of the saints well then working the ministry until you all come to get into that to one faith and the statue of the fullness of Jesus Christ and then bring the people from babies and bring them up by the word even unto the head and we all until we all come together with the same measure and when the offices were apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists for the perfecting of the church they have pastors and teachers and so forth and his alone I'm safe he's been trained in a word and he stayed right with the word a mini monk and say you have to read quotes and I've been through it and they don't understand that you you must bring back the reveal word from the prophet in all it for it to have an anointing on it many men will feel like that that's not a real minister that without real preacher that they can just preach and in the message but that's not so if the revealed word is what we are is bringing the anointing has done us it's a Revere word and so forth now brother grandma saying that he's prophesied here they will be sold with the word until the whole thing will work right up into the coming of the Lord and we already are in it the Morning Sun descended from heaven with a shout so we end the coming of the Lord and your pastor there has been working with the word and it'll work right up into the coming of the Lord I believe that unbelievably near that time now he's promised I'm back in 1962 I believe his soul you know we know that Jesus said and taught us all through this at the works that he did will be done also now my brethren I hope that if they disagree with me it would be on a friendly basis so I feel that the histone tabernacle when the Holy Spirit pours out the dynamics there will be a Messier perfection right there in your myths and the person of the field over put on a whole lot of God Santa Maria California 1962 now how does CalPERS and his army he bring us he presents his army in the form of five offices first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers all with the baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy with a word of God amen each one back in one one another up and that's what I appreciate about brother Theo and the other brethren that we've been with we back one another up we don't go around this way that's way in and stay a woman in the back when we back one another up with him the chief captain not out in front up here above all back be honey but in them that's the army sorry that's the army vindicating vindicating what his resurrection by the proof of his words so it comes right back to what I said before the the thing in the original faith will be the resurrection of Jesus Christ back in our churches and here brother Graham is placing the fivefold ministry right in there so that with Christ in each each one of the final menaces and then he said here vindicating what his resurrection it'll be Christ in the ministry they're vindicating his own resurrected resurrection by being in your faster there and the size and the one that some intervals following so therefore and not only that st. John 14:12 will he to believeth on me the works of that do she how to do also and greater works than these shall you do because they go to my father and that that sort of scripture that's twofold brother branham said it many have done the works of Christ the seventy the disciples without the Holy Ghost and then it was proven on down here our age and the 50s and all the great evangelists and so forth did the works of Christ right along but as brother Branham was doing the greater works and the works so now I feel that the greater words the prophets said will be given on eternal life so I'm leaving your pastor will be a vessel chosen by God given a medicine of perfection to stand up there like Peter and while he yet speaks the word the greater works will come out eternal life the baptism of the Holy Spirit from pouring out to the people there and therefore there by remaining assault of sins of their souls so brother Theo I salute you for the long battle and stand in the great stand that you have taken and I believe this and may God richly bless you the headstone Tabernacle for taking his time out to respect your pastor and to give him a day of appreciation for I believe is doing him and so I myself thank God to be part of this celebration which I could be there but this is my way of contributing something something to the appreciation so may the Lord bless you and may it be a great Memorial Day and made a holy spirit pour out on each one of you and if I may I like to just bomb ahead and order my head and word of printed my heads together and as we give thanks unto the Lord Almighty God just speak of a few words and behalf of your servant brother the feel of it and the work that he has done Lord and he's proved himself out there to stay with the word and bring back did these reveal quotes and things Lord where the fire is on them and many minutes that don't understand that they just want to preach a thought but we want but therefore if you want he wants to hide it and get out of the way that you might be glorified and this is what Christ is looking for and I know that he has found one such a man as brother feel of course the others there and but we are honoring for the field so I'll keep it there so I believe he is one of those that you're going to give the Ministry of perfection to as brother Graham said page 59 touch of a perfect manner that is our duty to friend the no friend sake a swim never die to stand there and portals virtues into the people to the coming of to a perfection of the coming of the Lord and that's what I believe is for according to ephesians 4 11 through 16 so Lord God may you pull out the Holy Spirit now upon the gathering near the group the church the friends the family whoever's there to honor your servant and truly give honor to whom honor is due and that's what we're doing today so may your blessing would a great mighty ministry Lord and bless his wife and his sons and be with them and may the church made the dynamics to the mechanics pour out there and all around or it may be a beacon of light all over trinidad and many finally realized that yes indeed a brother field did have a seventh under revelation which which is faith to bring on eruption grace so we pray lord you blessed them and gathering and all the festivities to speak into singing and all that will be done in behalf of his servant god bless you brother feel and may the Lord richest blessings be upon you Jesus name we ask the question amen and amen so I say the three words that the Lord spoke through the Prophet to me in 1964 is in my darkest hour June 14 and the message was the out ball and I had to go outside because the ministers wanted to as they say they want they had the only gang up on me and say something and I went outside to see brother Branham and brother read him turn and walk toward me damaging two parked cars in the dark and he's a brother Coleman I was looking for you and brought a hunt to call you out and I want to say to you God bless you and so like I said it I believe in the meaning brother Branham said to the minister that told him in February 1965 did brother Joseph Coleman get ahead of you because he preached cast out the bondwoman and brother Graham says no he says all you ministers are supposed to preached by a revelation and but it has to be in my message so I come back to what I've said but the RAM said here are you people but you believe was rather have have had the blessing of heaven God's servant with my divine inspiration interpret the word to you and therefore you can look around see you anointed you alive your Liberty Bissell's and there's more the greater part is yet to come so may the Lord which you bless all the Menace's that are there and and what they have said and so forth may it all be a blessing to you and me you continue on and mother feel but I'll be talking to you may the Lord of richly bless you and your wife and family and the entire church and so we thank you for all that you have done for us and blessed us so many blessings come back to you 104 god bless you is what brother Brown told me I say it back to you god bless you
