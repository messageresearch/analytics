[11:44] ham or or getting something ready or

[25:49] other way to do it science has found no
[25:51] other way they have created airplanes

[25:56] still don't know the Mystery of Life
[25:58] that is hidden in a blade of grass
[26:00] brother brandom said so isn't that right
[26:02] and they found no other way for a
[26:04] chicken to be born in this world than
[26:06] for him to pip his way out but the B
[26:08] said if you pick the shell of the eggs
[26:10] off of the baby you'll kill it he has to
[26:12] press his way he has to fight his way he
[26:15] has to struggle his way out praise God

[26:46] glorious manifestation of the Holy
[26:48] Spirit

[27:02] scientists theorists psychiatrists they
[27:06] all agree that once your mind has
[27:09] stretched to a certain Dimension it is
[27:11] impossible for you to go back to the old
[27:14] Dimension once you have experienced
[27:16] something new once you have experienced
[27:18] something different you can't go back to
[27:20] your old ways you can't go back to your
[27:22] old thinking to the old beat of how
[27:24] things used to be no no no away with
[27:27] that this is a new season this is a new
[27:29] day praise God we like Elisha this
[27:32] morning as long as I so live it I will
[27:35] not leave the I got my eye on the
[27:37] promise I got my eye on the prize I got
[27:40] my eye on the
[27:43] target
[27:44] [Music]
[27:45] [Applause]
[27:47] Hallelujah isn't that
[27:49] [Applause]
[27:51] right hallelujah hallelujah hallu we
[27:55] skip over here to Something in I had
[27:57] something about
[28:00] oh hallelujah oh here we go I was doing
[28:03] some research about a special kind of
[28:06] fish this fish is called a rainbow trout
[28:10] a rainbow trout remarkable creature it's
[28:13] a special kind of fish he said that when
[28:16] it's time for this trout to reproduce
[28:19] and lay it's young it cannot stay in the
[28:21] environment that it was accustom at
[28:23] wherever that fish used to live wherever
[28:25] that fish used to commute that fish
[28:27] can't stay stay there no more because
[28:29] he's pregnant with something he's
[28:31] embedded with something it is burdened
[28:33] with something it's burdened with
[28:35] precious seed and that seed have to
[28:37] bring forth and that burden is now upon
[28:39] the mother fish to go upstream and to
[28:42] lay her eggs she has to go against the
[28:45] tide she has to go against the current
[28:48] she has to go against the grain of the
[28:50] normal beat it's easy to go Downstream
[28:53] because you have the support of the
[28:54] stream and the stream is flowing in a
[28:56] certain direction and everybody is going
[28:58] in the same direction you don't even
[29:00] have to swim it's like going down a hill
[29:02] with a car you're not even mashing the
[29:04] gas you're just rolling going down but
[29:06] this Upstream thing is a different thing
[29:08] altoe this Upstream thing is against the
[29:11] current it's against the tide sometimes
[29:14] it's two steps backward sometimes one
[29:16] step forward but mama I got to make it
[29:19] because there's precious seed and that's
[29:21] how I feel the bride is this morning she
[29:23] has precious seed oh H the seed of the
[29:26] promise is laying in
[29:28] oh and she's going Upstream this morning
[29:31] flashes of rainbow trap this morning
[29:33] over doubt over fear over cont contrary
[29:37] Spirits over who don't want it over who
[29:40] sleeping over who tired forget about it
[29:43] you our rainbow trout this morning
[29:46] you've got to make it you've got to
[29:48] overcome we've got to get to Higher
[29:53] Ground hallelujah hallelujah they say
[29:57] she can't lay the egg
[29:58] in that lower stuff in that lower
[30:00] atmosphere the water is not clean enough
[30:03] it's all dirty with the debris and the
[30:05] drust that come down from the waterfalls
[30:06] and things like that so she goes all the
[30:08] way up the Rapids going up the higher
[30:10] stream what's she trying to get to the
[30:13] crystal clear water she's got to get to
[30:15] that crystal clear water that water of
[30:18] the Holy Spirit she's got to get to it
[30:21] she's got to make it there she's got
[30:23] eggs those eggs have must come to pass
[30:26] and that time and that season and I feel
[30:28] another season come around oh Hallelujah
[30:31] a season of manifestation whatever seed
[30:33] is inside of you the rain is about to
[30:36] bring it to life and those seeds must
[30:38] come to pass in their hour in their
[30:41] season hallelujah hallelujah

[31:01] the
[31:01] obstacles that may be in your way in
[31:04] order to attain a certain goal that is
[31:07] set before you the definition of the
[31:10] book d uh dictionary says to move in a
[31:14] specific Direction by pushing the only
[31:18] way to move is to push the only way to

[32:26] time getting it just right but here it
[32:29] is that they just push a button and you

[33:10] if your treasure is in the thing or if
[33:12] the treasure is in the thing you can't
[33:14] see that's where he tests you on praise
[33:17] God to see what you really made of to
[33:19] see if you're really willing to go on
[33:21] even without this thing
[33:31] that's why the Tre Hebrew boys were so
[33:34] inspired it wasn't about life or death

[33:46] down and testimony as the ones that took
[33:49] their stand against the king and what he
[33:51] had to say and they gods and their Idols

[33:57] to bow down and even if our God does not
[34:00] deliver us we still not going to bow
[34:03] down it's not our living it's not about

[41:33] that right his kingdom is set up a
[41:36] certain way he set up the earth a
[41:38] certain way the Earth right now is all
[41:41] corrupt and he has it in that condition
[41:44] to test the bride why would God put a
[41:47] bride in this evil hour it is to test
[41:49] her to try those seven virtue spirits

[42:15] now so the kingdom of God is set up a
[42:17] certain way isn't that right it's set up
[42:20] in this way watch that God can
[42:23] do what you cannot do amen amen but then
[42:26] you have to do what you have to do amen
[42:30] that's how it set up Hallelujah isn't
[42:32] that right only God can fill with the
[42:34] Holy Ghost isn't that right only God
[42:37] could seal only God could deliver only
[42:40] God could break the chains only God
[42:42] could do that we know that we are
[42:43] waiting on him to do that but while we
[42:45] are taring while we are waiting we've
[42:48] got to do what we have to do to get
[42:50] ready for when that breaks out for when
[42:53] those Miracles begin to break out that
[42:55] your heart would be right he said behold
[42:57] I come quickly and my reward is with me
[43:00] to give every man according as his work
[43:03] shall be there's always a work for you
[43:05] to do there's always something that you
[43:08] have to do praise God in God's
[43:13] kingdom Bible says he is a rewarder of
[43:16] them that diligently seek

[43:23] not under haway I give up yes no that's
[43:26] not the attitude you got to seek until
[43:28] you find like that woman who lost a coin
[43:32] she swept the walls she swept out the
[43:34] cobwebs she dusted the house she went on
[43:37] all night long until something happened
[43:41] it was getting dark she lit a candle she
[43:44] had a boom in one hand I'd imagine it's
[43:47] very difficult to sweep with one hand
[43:49] and have a candle in the other but she
[43:51] had to do it she needed a little light

[46:29] hallelujah praise amen
[46:32] amen okay
[46:35] Hallelujah you have to do what you have
[46:38] to do is that right come like I think
[46:41] Peter was in jail is that right and he
[46:44] was in jail preaching the gospel and so
[46:46] on and um the Roman centurions are
[46:50] watching him is that right Peter was in
[46:53] there sleeping had fets on him and so
[46:55] forth sleeping there in the prison just
[46:59] imagine
[47:00] that prisoner of Christ doing the right
[47:04] thing and he's in prison for bearing the
[47:07] reproach of
[47:08] Christ I like to think that he was he
[47:10] was sleeping now if I was in that
[47:13] condition I'd have been
[47:15] worried cuz I didn't know what my state
[47:17] of condition would have been in the next
[47:19] morning I don't know if they would have
[47:20] my head or have I been in trial or what
[47:23] my court case would be like I'd have
[47:25] been worried that's me in my natural but
[47:28] but Peter wasn't in the natural Peter
[47:30] was in another atmosphere that's why he
[47:32] could sleep you could sleep when you
[47:33] know God's got you got your back you can
[47:36] sleep when God know he's got your
[47:37] control Peter find a comfortable spot on
[47:40] the wall there in the prison and he fell
[47:42] asleep and all of a sudden the angel
[47:44] come and smoked him the angel woke him
[47:46] up the angel had to shake him hard
[47:49] because he was so resting in the spirit
[47:51] resting waiting on God because he knew
[47:53] God was in this situation even though he
[47:55] was in prison it wasn't always going to
[47:57] be like this God's got his back and he
[48:01] knew the church was praying for him so
[48:02] he took a comfortable nap and he he was
[48:05] sleeping so hard the angel had to wake
[48:06] him up and said Peter Peter it's time to
[48:08] go and all of a sudden the chains fall
[48:10] off his feet and when the angel begin to
[48:12] walk with Peter the doors begin to open
[48:15] the Bible said the door opened by itself
[48:17] we think we know what automatic door is
[48:20] we think we know about GPS and
[48:22] smartphone technology but God had that
[48:24] long time God just push up button peep
[48:28] it the system wasn't even his own he
[48:30] didn't even build the technology but he
[48:32] override the technology and press the
[48:34] button and open the gates and he and the
[48:37] angel walk outside oh you talk about a
[48:40] God we serve oh hallelujah hallelujah
[48:43] hallelujah he can open any door for you
[48:46] this morning all he's got to do is press
[48:49] the button but he's looking at your
[48:51] attitude he's looking at what you're
[48:54] doing oh Hallelujah
[48:57] [Applause]
[49:00] isn't that right the angel led him out
[49:03] of the prison the Bible says and then
[49:05] the Bible actually says a strange thing
[49:07] it says when he got to a place where he
[49:09] was familiar the angel left him
[49:13] immediately so just goes to show that
[49:15] God will lead you as far as he can carry
[49:17] youj but then when it comes to a point
[49:20] where you can do for yourself he leaves
[49:22] you to to to go on the rest of the way
[49:25] isn't that right Jesus led them as far
[49:28] as to Bethany that's as far as he could
[49:30] carry them that's as far as he could
[49:32] take them oh isn't that right but his
[49:34] 40-day ministry it was over it was
[49:36] finished with he had given them the Word
[49:38] of Promise he had breed unto them
[49:40] receive the Holy Ghost he had opened
[49:42] their understanding to the scriptures
[49:43] but that's as far as they could carry
[49:45] them he could carry them rather isn't
[49:47] that right because they had to go in the
[49:49] upper room they had to find a place they
[49:51] had to set themselves aside they had to
[49:54] pray they had to seek they had to praise
[49:57] God they had to earnestly contend they
[50:00] had to wait until the promise of the
[50:02] father proom was brought unto them amen
[50:05] isn't that right
[50:09] hallelujah amen so as I close up this
[50:12] thought you have an active role to play
[50:16] in your blessing isn't that right
[50:19] there's always something for you to do
[50:21] isn't that right there's an active role
[50:23] for you to play amen amen Hallelujah
[50:27] isn't that right hallelujah praise God
[50:31] praise God so Matthew 11:12 says and
[50:34] from the days of John the Baptist until
[50:36] now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered
[50:39] violence and the violent take it by
[50:41] force I love that word take isn't that
[50:44] right God gives it but you have to take
[50:47] it isn't that right am it's about that
[50:50] like that story where about the
[50:52] presidental pardon isn't that right the
[50:54] president give the pardon to this young
[50:55] man who who did something wrong in the
[50:58] military or something was remember the
[50:59] story and um president gave a pardon
[51:02] when the pardon was brought to him he
[51:03] didn't believe it was a pardon and he
[51:05] end up getting killed anyway and the
[51:07] people wondered how come he was written
[51:08] a pardon and he uh still end up getting
[51:11] the death sentence and it end up turning
[51:13] out that amen isn't that right uh our
[51:16] pardon is only a pardon until it is
[51:18] accepted as a pardon so our pardon can
[51:21] be given but until you accept it it is
[51:24] not yours until you possess it until you
[51:27] take a hold of it it is not yours until
[51:30] you take up the right take up the mantle
[51:32] of responsibility or take up whatever
[51:34] the thing is then it's not yours
[51:36] hallelujah praise God until you possess
[51:40] it isn't that right God gives it but you
[51:45] have to take it God gives salvation but
[51:48] it's not yours until you take it Jesus
[51:51] didn't just die for this one he died for
[51:52] the whole world his blood covered the
[51:54] whole world but not everybody could take
[51:56] it
[51:57] only the predestinated could go into
[51:59] that place only the predestinated could
[52:01] take their promises for this hour isn't
[52:04] there right and God set it up that way
[52:06] that the predestinated could shine
[52:08] through amidst the testings amidst the
[52:11] trials amidst the situation that is set
[52:13] up in the Earth today only the
[52:16] predestinated oh Hallelujah is
[52:18] predestined to go into that
[52:20] [Applause]
[52:23] place
[52:24] hallu isn't that right
[52:27] we need to predestinated look at Esther

[52:52] the tide God begin to change the
[52:54] situation God begin to bring it to us
[52:56] but where it come the point of

[59:44] take up his position to subject himself
[59:47] to the word hallelujah for that day the

[1:01:52] in Revelation amen isn't that right not
[1:01:55] on my throne but in my Throne amen he
[1:01:58] said that's in his domain isn't that
[1:02:02] right the literal English you would say
[1:02:03] on a throne a human being sits on a
[1:02:05] throne but brother BR is bringing out
[1:02:08] something here now that the scripture
[1:02:09] has slipped in a mystery isn't that
[1:02:11] right he said in his throne see and now
[1:02:13] as Christ is the ruler Throne ruler at
[1:02:16] this time of the complete domain of God

[1:02:49] his boundaries is from eternity to
[1:02:51] Eternity just think of it isn't that
[1:02:54] right and Jesus said
[1:02:56] on that day you shall know I am in the
[1:02:59] father he in me and I in you and you in
[1:03:02] me on that day you're going to
[1:03:03] understand who your father is and who

[1:03:11] Wayward you are not a bastard child but
[1:03:13] you have a father you have a family
[1:03:16] somewhere and just as your natural name

[1:12:20] [Music]
[1:12:21] [Applause]
[1:12:23] power yeah
[1:12:27] amenah
[1:12:28] [Applause]
[1:12:35] Hallelujah can you take a little
[1:12:37] more my hallu amen I W be too longer
[1:12:41] with you
[1:12:43] amen so the Bible clearly identifies in
[1:12:46] the scripture when you talk about this
[1:12:48] press two different types of press isn't
[1:12:52] that right there's a group press and
[1:12:55] then there's the individual press isn't
[1:12:57] that right the definition of a group
[1:12:59] press is a closely packed crowd or mass
[1:13:03] of people or things isn't that right a
[1:13:06] group a crowd isn't that right pressing
[1:13:09] isn't that right and in a group press
[1:13:12] it's easier Amen to press with the group
[1:13:16] because you're going with the flow of
[1:13:17] things whatever the group says is what
[1:13:19] you do whatever group the group
[1:13:22] sanctions you go with it isn't that
[1:13:24] right there there's no real struggle
[1:13:26] there isn't that right say what
[1:13:28] everybody else says do what everybody
[1:13:30] else does you're identified with the
[1:13:31] group isn't that right you're all moving
[1:13:34] in a particular direction isn't that
[1:13:37] right but with the individual press it's
[1:13:40] different you have to know what you are
[1:13:42] about you have to know what you are
[1:13:44] doing you have to know where you are
[1:13:46] going amen isn't that right or you can
[1:13:48] get let astray because if the group is
[1:13:50] going to hell you'll go into hell with
[1:13:52] them just to show us anything so God
[1:13:55] have to open your mind open your heart
[1:13:57] to something different to make you to
[1:13:59] move in a different direction oh to make
[1:14:02] you move away from the group think from
[1:14:04] the group idea Hall then you are seeing
[1:14:06] what God Said and not what they say and
[1:14:09] not what they approve and not what they
[1:14:11] happy with whether they happy or whether
[1:14:13] they don't happy you're not there to
[1:14:14] please them you there to please God you
[1:14:17] there to please your father you are
[1:14:19] concerned about what your father is
[1:14:21] saying about you that's what adoption is
[1:14:24] your conduct and your behavior is what
[1:14:26] places you in the adoption not what
[1:14:28] people say not men's ideas not what the
[1:14:31] group thinks but your behavior and your
[1:14:33] conduct amid the trials that he and his
[1:14:35] wisdom sends your way you conduct
[1:14:38] yourself like a son you conduct yourself
[1:14:41] like job you speak like a foolish woman
[1:14:44] and though his brothers come and say
[1:14:46] joob what's your condition what is going
[1:14:48] on with you Jo your sin who sin what
[1:14:51] what going on with you and and and and
[1:14:54] you need some
[1:14:55] help you look you look badly off you
[1:14:59] don't look like a Christian you don't
[1:15:01] smell like a Christian you don't look
[1:15:03] like us what's going on with you there's
[1:15:06] something weird about you but job know
[1:15:08] what was going on with him because he
[1:15:10] had a personal connection with God and
[1:15:12] these fellas weren't real friends they
[1:15:14] were just Associates and when in the
[1:15:17] trial you you really see who your
[1:15:19] friends are in the test is when you see
[1:15:21] when your real friends are your real
[1:15:23] friends are those who could stay with
[1:15:24] the word
[1:15:25] those real
[1:15:28] friends are people who could encourage
[1:15:31] you isn't that right when you're all low
[1:15:35] when you're broken up friends are people
[1:15:37] who could come and carry you take you
[1:15:40] through like that man was lame with the
[1:15:43] py I think it was Jesus preaching among
[1:15:46] the press the group was around and he's
[1:15:48] preaching and talking and these real
[1:15:50] friends say listen you been in that
[1:15:53] condition a long time yeah

[1:15:57] to allow you to live another day in this

[1:16:03] we have to carry you whether we have to
[1:16:04] lift you lift you up climb you whatever
[1:16:07] that whatever it take but we taking you

[1:16:11] roof oh what a condition praise God I
[1:16:14] don't even know they got time to talk to
[1:16:15] the landlord I don't even know they got
[1:16:17] time to talk to the land owner but they
[1:16:18] begin to break the roof up because they
[1:16:20] had needs for their friend and they
[1:16:22] loved their friend enough to begin to
[1:16:24] break up the roof that's real friendship
[1:16:27] praise God and it began to lower a man
[1:16:29] down into this service that was going on
[1:16:32] and they interrupted the program they
[1:16:35] interrupted the natural flow of things
[1:16:37] whatever Jesus was going to say next was
[1:16:38] interrupted whatever Jesus was going to
[1:16:40] do next was interrupted because there
[1:16:42] was a need there and whenever there's a
[1:16:44] need there anytime somebody's pressing
[1:16:47] for a need that need must be fulfilled
[1:16:50] oh Hallelujah God is a gentleman praise
[1:16:53] God hallelujah and if you got a need
[1:16:55] he's going to accommodate you he's going
[1:16:57] to find a place for you he's going to
[1:16:59] see to that need he put everybody else
[1:17:01] on the side and go after that one he
[1:17:03] leave the 99 and go after that one he is

[1:21:24] life but just for a moment just for a
[1:21:26] brief moment she saw a possibility that
[1:21:30] all of a sudden her 12E sickness could
