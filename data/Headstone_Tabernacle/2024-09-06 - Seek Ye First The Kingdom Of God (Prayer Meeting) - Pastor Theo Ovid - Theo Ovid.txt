for word a prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for this grace and opportunity that you given unto us to call upon your name and to approach your throne you're Sovereign in your ways in your word in your works and father there's nothing hindering you for cleansing forgiving breaking bounds of wickedness evil delivering restoring healing baptizing you are God and God alone and I pray come on in a special name and minister to your people right in your homes that your spirit will take a hold upon them their mind their thoughts their actions their attitudes your words Grant it Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and thank you all for being here tonight and we want to see what the Lord will do uh so if you have your Bibles IID like to look at Matthew chapter 6 The Book of Matthew chapter 6 and I have taught tonight seek ye first the kingdom of God but this first is actually speaking also about putting God first seeky first the kingdom of God and this is Jesus speaking now we talk about things pertaining to life and godliness if there's a chapter that really speaks to that is this this is a a Living Word a living gospel and Jesus is detailing it here take heed that you do not your arm for men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven so what he is saying here is that you have to get the Consciousness or the awareness that there is a higher level a level be beyond the eyes of man you know where there are issues you have your Viewpoint you have your words you have your thoughts and I may have my viewpoint my words my thoughts but I want you to consider there a third person so I could think a certain thing I could feel a certain thing but that third person is God and sometime the question we have to ask ourselves is how does God see it how does God see attitudes and ways and behavior how does he see it so Jesus saying specifically you have to be conscious that your reward is from your father which is in heaven verse two he went down deeper therefore when thou doest arms now this is natural thing some people they don't like to give they're very selfish so they have no arms to do they want to get their whole life story is can you help me I need help they don't seek to help others but listen to this when thou doest thine arms do not s a trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have the glory of men here we go again so Jesus talk about practical living practical doing but who you're doing it for and how you doing it that they have the glory of men verily I say unto you they have their reward but when thou doest arm so just think he's making a distinction let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth here the purpose that thy arms may be in secret and thy father which seat in secret himself shall reward you openly so what he is sharing here is uh higher consciousness of another eye that is watching us and that we are not to look to the eyes of men but to the eyes of God as Isaac but Isaac spoke sometime where he said that there there should be no Christian of a poor testimony of work ethic on their jobs because they're supposed to be operating and reflecting God's kingdom verse five when thou prayest that's what we're going to do tonight thou shal not be as Hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they be seen of men verily they have their reward so he's not saying they will not have their reward no they have award but here we go speaking about you now when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which he in secret and thy father with SE in secret shall reward the open now watch so he come again to show you God Consciousness God awareness God presence but then he wants to detail know how to pray what type of prayer when he pray verse seven use not vain repetitions as a hidden do why would they use V repetitions to make their prayer long so when they in public they have the long long long prayer prayer I don't know if it impresses people that you're prayer Warrior long long drawn out prayer but the thing about it Jesus prayed all night so what I am seeing is that your long prayer in your closet or on the mountain or apart makes effective your short prayer in public all right let's continue now when you pray use not vain reputation as the Heen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking but be not like unto them here we go for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him and after this manner therefore pray ye this is where he taught them Our Father which are in heaven you could say you could say together with me Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen now when Jesus completed his prayer he went back to forgiveness in verse 14 for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you so he was clearly stating there'll be issues there'll be challenges brother brother brother sister father mother church members whatever pastor congregation whatever and he says now if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will forgive you now this is Jesus own words verse 15 but if you forgive not men the trespasses your sins are on you neither will your father forgive your trespasses there are people who have a and grudges their sins are not forgiven their prayer is not being answered because the only prayer God could answer from a sinner is I Repent God not hearing sin a prayer wasting time total waste of time because in that sinful condition you can't really approach God the only thing God will accept and he doesn't have to accept it because Esau sought God and seed with delion with prayers and he couldn't find that P of repentance so we could seek God but God have to accept our repentance and then from there we could offer up other prayer now he went down to what we did today verse 16 moreover when you fast be not as Hypocrites or sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear onto men to fast they want people to see how holy how righteous how spiritual whatever in other words men pleases them verily i s to you they have their reward so he's not challenging or questioning the blessing that they will get for what they're doing in mechanics but th so he's classifying you as the elect you are the bread but thou when th fastest anoint thine head wash thy face that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which see in secret shall reward thee opening so it's evident that somebody that pleases God somebody that's putting God first that person it will be evident of the hand and the blessings of God upon their lives Jesus been a little deeper he's drilling down this was a this is a mighty mighty uh message um that he's presenting here in verse 19 so he talk about prayer talk about fasting he's talk about giving arms and then he's checking out our desires now what do we want what do you have in your heart verse 19 lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon the Earth where Mor and rust that corrupt and where thieves break through and steal so if you stop right there and he talk about lay not up for yourself Treasures on the earth that mean there are Treasures elsewhere so Treasures are not just Earth or Earthly Treasures he is saying okay guy they have Treasures here but I want to tell you about a different treasure this treasure on Earth Mor than rust is corrupt and if you have it theves could break through and steal verse 20 but lay up for yourself Treasures in Heaven where neither Mor nor rust that corrupt and where thieves do not break through no steal now the service on Wednesday night I read the scripture where Jesus spoke about I was hungry and you didn't feed me I was sick and you didn't visit me and and all this stuff and they say where when were you hungry when were you sick when were you in prison he say as as you have done this to the least of my little ones you have done it unto me so the thing of it is this how do we lay up Treasures in Heaven he said but lay up for yourself Treasures in Heaven where neither Mort nor rust that corrupt and where tees do not break through nor steal listen the unbelieving person who treat the elect right with honor and respect because they love the Saints they may not be as sined themselves they may not repent they may never even come to church but because they see you and they love you they love your Christian testimony imagine they are going to be rewarded with eternal life and there are those people hypocritical as ever they'll be separated and sent that is how this treasure is so great then Jesus cap it off with for where your treasure is there will your heart be also if your treasure is money you're after that you put money have children money front the church ahead of the church ahead of God you put money you put you know that's your God that what you're worshiping ready the loot the money S as ever you will share because this is your god you keeping your God intact where your treasure is there will your heart be also so if your treasure is in God if your treasure is considering the Holy Ghost if your treasure is Con in connected with righteousness and Holiness and Purity that is where your heart will be Jesus went down deeper so this is not as we say the Thunders that do shake the devil this one that shake them he said the light of the body is the eye if therefore thy eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thy eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness and if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness how great is that darkness and we know that the devil used to the iate to take a hold of your mind but God used the heart because that's where the god control tower is the sense of Fai Jesus drilling down further no man can serve two Ms for either will hate one or love the other or else he will hold to one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon you cannot be in between you get squeezed you get killed therefore practical living I say unto you take no thought for your life why are people so stressed out pressed out take it talk for your life God never leave you to be out shelter never leave you without a place to lay on and food and everything else and you're still worried like if he has not been there or he has been faithful take no thought for your life may God Inspire this to you tonight take no thought for your life what you shall eat what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not life more than meat and the body more than arment behold the fs of the air they so neither do they reap nor GA into bands yet Heavenly Father feeded them are you not better than they which of you taking thought can add one cubit onto a statue so thinking doesn't produce it thinking doesn't act to you you could think that you're going to lose weight and that's just your thoughts until you act and get the thing right then you will lose weight you think you're going to get a job and you're stay in home job not coming to the roof you have to apply you have to press you have to fight your way through isn't that right so watch and why take each thought for reignment 28 consider the leave of the field or they grow they to not you do they spin they say unto you that Solomon in all his glory not a way like one of these wherefore if God and this is the comparon this is Jesus the greatest teacher on Earth if God so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you over you have little fi therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat that shouldn't come out your mouth what shall we drink that shouldn't come out your mouth where shall we be clothed those words shouldn't come out your mouth for after all these things do the Gentiles seek in other words the unbelievers talk that talk but your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things so when you see this it makes it easy for you to pray for others because you know your business will be taken care of because your father knows what you have need of but this is a Capstone verse here but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you this here answers everything you put God first you put the kingdom first you seek that first God will add to you you will be like Joseph God will add take therefore no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient until the days the evil for a wow any Christian will think of others before himself there's a bomb right there there's a huge bomb there's a nuclear bomb any not church member church member is a different one any Christian will think of others before himself every Christian tries to put God first his family second and he is number three I have tried to make that a practice in my own life God first your family second and you are the third let's continue Moses had been a total failure and there may many men here this afternoon know maybe ministers that's been total failures maybe you have been as a housewife maybe you have been a student in school maybe you as a child to your parents whatever you have been let that be has been and start from today so B BR was trying to draw a line and the sign he said let been has been has been a failure has been has been let it start from today no matter what it is maybe you have been a failure as a Christian he's drilling down but maybe you fail to go on with God if it has been take note to what I'm going to say just in a few moments about this listen carefully I I was wondering to myself how many people hear the word as God you know in my early Christian experience God call me when seven years of of age I had many many experiences talking to people witnessing to people testifying to people and everything else and one of my attitudes that I had I can't remember how I developed it how I got it was God could use anybody to speak to me so I always had an extra ear for adventure who is speaking to me whether is unbelief or whatever God using them to get something across to me so listen to this so I'm saying that to say this if you are here tonight in this virtual prayer meeting and you're hearing this like a ritual oh you say some words or somebody say some words and then we go and pray and what not you miss the mark the word is God if you begin to begin to listen with an extra air the inner air of the heart and say God what are you saying to me tonight I just one word will make all the difference you see if you have a a fight with me you can't see God or God because your heart is in a condition you battling with the pastor you battling with who is speaking you battling and you seeing human you seeing Flesh and Blood you're not seeing a man that God can use you're not seeing God speaking you're not even seeing a trly word because that God could only speak through his word so listen so when brother Ram says take note to what I'm going to say just in a few minutes listen to this Woods Moses failed down in Egypt when he was born to be delivered to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt why because he did it in himself he took it upon himself to do it and any time you take things upon yourself this is me I could do this I could do that and whatnot and leave God out then you are going to be a fail like Moses was this is a guaranteed fail once your beef once your flesh you on the human level and the natural flesh parade in which you want to do your own thing failure he thought he could do it seeing an Egyptian beaten an Israelite so he killed him covered him up when he did he become a refugee in another land over in the land of Ethiopia and he went over there and married a wife listen listen he got a job H and sheep Jetro the Sheep of Midian he married his daughter he had two children born to him he got a common laborers job sheep hder and had been hurting sheep for 40 years because he failed to put God first so you see some people think they get through they get through with trickery they get through with the bad behavior they get through with the bullying they get through all through the life they get through and as we say if in your parents house you didn't get discipline life will deal with you life will discipline you and when you think you get through it have some pain coming be careful he had been hurting sheep for 40 years because he failed to put God first I think that is what's been the matter with the churches brother when it gets to a place that we put our church first instead of Christ ahuh you mean people could put the church first yes they could put the church first instead of Christ they serving the church is serving the pastor is serving a man you're not serving the lord we are going to get right straight down when you put them as an individual here we go put your church first your social life first instead of your spiritual life you want a break you want a break are you praying to God are you putting God fots instead of your spiritual life first you are going to fail failure is guaranteed and I I see people headen for the waterfall the headen for CRA seeking first the kingdom of God have you ever witnessed that to be the truth put God first pay your tithes first pay God pray first at morning pray all through the day give God the first place in everything now remember you don't have to do nothing you could live your life and die a human but the god that give us Mercy the god that is rich in Mercy the god that give us the opportunity the god to give us life all these years I think he deserve praise and he deserves Glory that is why the judgments of God will be so harsh and fierce because he didn't stay up in glory and look down and say and and and sorry for humans and he came down himself became flesh and paid the price brother br he says this listen young people brother Brandon do you think it's wrong to do a certain thing question I said what are you questioning about if there's a question in your mind leave it alone don't do it at all just stay with that when you start to do anything and if there's a question whether it is right or wrong stay away from it don't do at all then you know you're right a direct this a direct word don't say brother so and so do it and I see do it and this un do it no I think I wrap up with this there's so much the time going seek ye first the kingdom of God his righteousness and all these other things will be added then he said there's amazing words I am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get to the position to where their soul their thinking their attitudes would be perfect in the sight of God that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed I'll close with this give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that will put God first in everything I will show you a man that will be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him he seek Gods first so if things are crashing around you think again this is a word that challenges all of us to put God first and we will be successful he didn't say Seek success he did not say that he said seek the kingdom you seek the kingdom then you becom a value to God the people that are successful is people are people who have become valuable and people are willing to pay for the value of those people that is why they could send for brother Bram all over the world that is why they wanted that woman said show me where that man walk and I'll walk and I'll be here because he become a man of value don't seek success seek the kingdom and success will come don't seek success seek the Holy Ghost blessings will come seek first the kingdom let's bow our heads heavenly father I thank you tonight for these words that I believe that was given to share with your people to seek first the kingdom of God as they get on in prayer may your presence be with them in a special way light them of fire May their faith be lit up with joy may they see this is like a rope dropped down into their laps drop down into their hands that they could hold on and climb out of depression frustration and everything else Lord may they see the possibility of their cup running over may they see you adding to them and you blessing them in so much it will spill over to the families their family granted father you said how we supposed to be to put you first
