hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god just worship him oh amen amen so we're looking for the lord to have blessed us this morning in his word there's something upon my heart to share with you we really appreciate for the zigman his son from germany jessica blatant from new york city buddhiano from france raymond thompson from south africa the ulu from nigeria but i turned from uganda i had a josephine cat from congo got a princess from canada congo south africa but i alvarez i'm chilly but i could be from nigeria but i can't care for nigeria they believe us from england and france and all who are connected to us we say god richly bless you amen at this time we understand that we want to go into the world this morning want to look at joel chapter one one verse that verse four joel chapter two from 25-29 matthew chapter 17 verse 10 to 13 this morning george chapter 1 verse 4 joel 2 25-29 in matthew chapter 17 10 to 13. joel 1 verse 4 that which the palmer woman had left had the lucas eaten and that which the lucas had left at the conquer womb eaten and that which the kangaroo had left at the caterpillar eden joel 2 verse 25 and i'll restore to you the years that the lucas had eaten the conquer womb the caterpillar the palmer my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that are dealt wonderfully with you and my people shall never be ashamed amen and you shall know that i am in the midst of israel that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour my spirit upon our flesh your sons your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit matthew 17 reading from verse 10 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribe that elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things but i say unto you that elias has come already and they knew him not and have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he speak unto them of john the baptist let us pray father we thank you for your presence and those gathered here today and we thank you for those connected even today on the internet we pray your blessing with flu out and speak to our hearts as we wait on you and depend upon you look into calvary looking to the cross may your blood come and splash all over here and cover us this morning in jesus name may ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise the lord advertiser the restoration of fallen eve the bride tree another inspiration our restore saith the lord o blessed be the name of the lord the restoration of fallen eve the bride tree well i certainly appreciate that final message uh with isaac preaching but isaac preaching one fate one lord one baptism kind of bloomer it's very noteworthy that in the beginning when man was trying to get that unity it was under the ship of man isn't that right and god had to come out to confuse the language because that unity challenged god it was very troublesome to god god could not allow man to remain under that unity so god came and tweaked and changed the different languages so when somebody said bricks they hearing something else or something like that so they couldn't continue building so god confused the language but they are pentecost when the holy ghost came down all here in their own tongue god flipped the whole thing back to show that when the holy ghost comes it will produce the right kind of unity under the headship of the spirit isn't that wonderful today oh blessed be the name of the lord so we see what the law will do for us this morning now he said here and a guide at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of god should be finished you know who god is what he is how he lives his nature his being and referring to the pyramid you're supposed to be all the way up there by that time to bring us into the full stature of the sons and daughters of god remember we didn't know about god's stature and nature until gaussian and prophet all we know is church bible teachings and so on but when the prophet came he came to introduce the statue of god the nature of god he even said when we ask to get close to god what we're already seeing we want to grow in god hallelujah praise him our lord so he said oh brother give me a church full of the holy ghost god will do in one year what all theology fails to do in 2000 years you wait till the anointing of the church really strike home to that little remnant after the doors of the gentile is closed oh god will anoint a church then he who is filthy doesn't be filthy still he was righteous let him be righteous still and he is holy let him be holy still and god will anoint the church with the power of god and things will be taking place not coming home and going going going the streets are will be taking place he's in and i believe that we're on the borderland tonight he's that right he said watch we can't even have faith for divine healing let alone a rapture in faith he said god have faith that will change and quicken this body and be taken away we talk about the rapture but the rap the rapture have to do with your body being changed and you would have to have faith that your very body will be changed what he said i believe that there's a church on this road tonight a power of the living god that men and women will speak the word here and there it will flash like like then a church is coming out not a psychologist not a put on make believe but a real true genuine anointed holy ghost called our church do you believe that this morning oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah praise god and we find out the holy ghost is bordered on individuals praise be to jesus not the entire group but on individuals so when you come to church you come as an individual to get your portion nobody could keep you from getting your portion your husband can't keep you your wife can keep you back your children can't keep you back not even your trials could keep you back the holy ghost is poured on individual do you believe that i say it again the holy ghost component opponent on individuals oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah praise god poured out [Applause] [Music] what kind of foolishness is that hallelujah praise god the holy ghost gonna be poured out but amanda said one day the last drop in god's bucket gonna be poured out and afterwards there'll be no more left that's why the wise version get the extra oil that's why you didn't come here to occupy a pew or occupy a chair you come here for the holy ghost he was god almighty he was a master teacher he knew exactly what he was doing when he called peter and andrew and all of those guys he knew exactly what he was doing they were born in sin they were shape iniquity but they had a german side of them that they did not know so he came to reveal where they came from glory to god you may be seated before they receive the holy ghost he gives them a taste of what power is like in matthew 10 he said behold i sent you power these were men without god in them they didn't have the holy ghost but they had power upon them it was temporary power to let these brothers know it could be done when the spirit of the lord comes upon my heart i will dance like david dance shall i give it shout and do the works that christ do samson didn't have the holy ghost because the holy ghost was not yet given but when the spirit of the lord came upon samson he did things that normal humans can't do that's when the spirit comes upon you you don't have to have the holy ghost for the spirit to come upon you come on same as somebody so don't look at if you can't make it you've got to make it oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god man [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah all things must be restored [Applause] glory my god amen hallelujah why describe the last must first come disciples only here describes preaching elasmus first come right last must first come the last must first come as he lies and jesus he said elias must first truly come present prophecy and restore all things but elias come already so you do two things here he said he last coming in the future and he last it's come already he was saying john the baptist he's come already but is elijah to come that elijah to come couldn't restore all things not some things come on come on i'll say ms somebody that elias is to come speaking about william branham speaking about malachi 4 he is to restore some things no all things and i say today all things has been restored the book has been restored the authority has been restored the pillar of fire so once it's restored the prophet can preach possession all things because once all things restored we could go back to how we were before the fall i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you was in the position of power and authority in genesis 1 26 the authority of god said let us make man in our own image in order like this and we found the secret of the harmony between adam and eve the prophet revealed that secret and oneness he said they had the nature of god adam had god's nature and eve had god nature and they were one come on same as somebody so the nature of god restores back harmony response back in unity that's what the nature of god does then if the nature is is dissolved or taken away you're gonna get problems you're gonna get this unity you're gonna get things out of salt isn't that right are you with me oh hallelujah so they're not their pentecost isn't that right yeah hallelujah pentecost he said there's gonna be a wave in again the son of man is to be wave over the people who's the son of man in the beginning was the word the word was with god is not right and we find out that the word again is to be waved over the people that the dead traditions of men is dead and the son of god is alive with the baptism of the holy ghost and is giving us life amen oh hallelujah so the word of promise has to be wave over the people notice what god does he doesn't wait for you to be ready to give you hallelujah he give you before you're ready you know you're going to make yourself ready [Applause] you maybe see this he didn't feel or wait for david to feel like a king to anoint david he told saul god anoint a king for me out of the sons of jesus not a king to be he's a king in my eyes he told gideon you are a mighty man of allah gideon wasn't feeling that way it goes to show god is not going by how you feel you could be feeling dumb you could feel any depressed you could even know that has nothing to do with the intelligence with the vision with the mind of god but the purpose of god with what god have predestinated for your life i'm gonna be seated god doesn't even need your help who he forned you he called i'm not hearing you we call he justified who he joseph he had already that has nothing to do with you who he phoned you he called are you called my god are you called then he phoned you you that's why he called you that's a no devil couldn't stop you the parties couldn't stop you i told you couldn't stop you oh god drinking couldn't stop you fearless couldn't stop you nothing could stop you because we [Applause] oh fought hallelujah do you wanna be seated hallelujah how do you think samson felt in prison yeah man he was called for a purpose he felt horrible everybody who preached about pleasure and pain pleasure delilah pain after was in prison for breaking the commandments of god but samson knew he came from a source he knew the power of that source he felt the power he had experienced it before and you know once you had it you could get restored hallelujah that's why you have to taste it come on now you got to experience it you got to know it for yourself and i can see samson lying on one day his eyes is out but something's singing in his ass i will [Music] [Applause] samson couldn't look in the mirror to see how long the hair came back out but something tells samson put your hand behind your hair put it back like oh god who's in the back part of his mind something called samson put your hand behind your hair and when samson put his hand in a backpack he felt the locks he said wait a minute i didn't know the locks have been restored all things have been restored all things are ready all something wanted was an opportunity to call upon the lord oh hallelujah honestly somebody saying man can somebody say glory to god you may be seated [Applause] the key has been restored but he has to be in position to call for the power that was required to face the challenge of the hour and here come those philistines oh hallelujah they want to make fun of him they want to mock him they want to ridicule him they want to find fault with him they want to make sport with him but god would have none of that god was setting them up because the critic's not going to be shocked god is setting them up to shut them out let them keep on talking god is setting them up they're setting them up to shut them out they're going to shut the critics mouth could you see him as somebody you may be seated samson he was the prime of the show he was the final act they come to really this is a big man used to be under the anointing used to be in the under the power of god look at him now he has no power he has no glory he has no strength and something here and i will restore i will restore not say that man stay at the lord restore what all with the conquer worm all what the palmer wound all over the locust all with the caterpillar all what they eat down i will restore to you come on now that's the words of the bible i will restore to you the years [Applause] so long your crops dying no produce isn't not right yeah you're out you can't see what you want to see all of a sudden a word come a word of restoration come a word of i will restore all the blessing you taught you lost it's not lost it's bottled up it's poor it's coming down because the devil can't keep from you what god has predestinated come on say him and somebody oh glory to god it's already reserved for you god is not now making up your paycheck he's not counting your hours karma is already made it's the same pain come on send me some same power same glory same witness and you're going to find out what happened in ghana eden had a mind behind it how the intelligence behind it do you think god could lose eve you think some devil will come and shoot on that eve and god will leave eve fallen no i'm gonna restore you think god believe you fallen no i'm gonna restore you think god will leave you back sleeping no i'm gonna restore do you think god's gonna leave you sick no i'm gonna restore give the lord a shout inside of him [Applause] i love when fate is challenged i love when you're challenged to step out of your comfort zone look at samson when they tell him samson they want you out he said what for he said they want to make sport of you say okay okay all right i'm coming tell him i'm coming i'm getting myself ready i could see something tickle the corner and say lord you promised to restore thank you in the advance of your power for the restoration of your spirit for the restoration of the anointed intention of worship [Applause] once a prison become a temple of prayer he worshiped what was the prison become a host of god he worships hallelujah my god samson walk over there tell everyone lead me to the post where this building is holding up on leave me just between the posts you can't go between the post as if it's trying to make a picture samsung was trying to take a selfie or get somebody take a picture i'm going to pose by the post take a picture of me it was moving picture he was going to destroy he was going to fulfill what god raised him up to do we're not asking to be in position to take a picture come on come on come on no no no no no we have to fulfill all righteousness we have to fulfill the word you may be seated hallelujah and the people were so blind they were a court have been laughing at that servant of god between those pillars that they failed to recognize jewish suckerless eyes tears were coming down in all sincerity they failed to realize how genuine and sincere that that man saw a possibility and the first thing for you to get the breakthrough you have to see a possibility if you don't see anything you can't make a move but once you see a possibility then all things are possible to those who see a possibility you've got to believe that god's going to work for you you've got to believe that you're going to get he saw a possibility of the power being restored have he been restored you may be seated do you realize that something was restored amen the lux was restored the covenant was restored he was already restored waiting to be placed by power he said once more lord and then the power struck him and samson pushed with all his might and all them lords and philistines and philistines wives all them came down samson died when he said let me die with them i'll pay the price and we have to be willing today to pay the price for the power that caught up on the loose on the earth nobody could stop it nor does god understand all the kingdoms have been anointed satan kingdom has been anointed then the bride must also be anointed [Applause] notice what retitled the message amen the restoration of me not standing eve not upright eve not not righteous evil not saint evil [Music] we are speaking about the restoration of fallen need [Music] if you never fall god bless you if you're not sick this morning well god bless you you know jesus one time they finally among such weird people stressful people straining people sick people demon possessed people all kind of people and they find he supposed among jewish people he wasn't churchy enough jesus said the sick needs a physician not the world people who have conditions that's what we come for is anything too hard for the lord amen this morning any sin too deep if any you're going so far that god can't bring you back and restore you and and pull you from out of what you're in and bring a great victory to your life you know how jehovah going to love you getting victory you know goddess feel pain when there's defeat after defeat after defeat when you're not getting little breakthroughs all these are little breakthroughs you know just a little victory and when you get the devil on the rope like i said keep him on the rope keep him on the road don't just back off be an european [Applause] oh hallelujah all you need is a little victory i don't start and i trust this service do that for some of you inside of here let's start see the possibility and the possibility make you pray because the first thing devil does is take prayer away from you you take it out of your mouth you can't even feel to pray the thought to pray don't even coming you don't even know what to whisper to god because you feel condemned you feel stripped you feel beaten you feel broken and the devil get the prayer out of your lips make it get blind to who god is blind get his power and omnipotence blind to his power deliverance for your life but once you see a possibility then the prayer is restored to your lips and in your lips are power prayer power speaking power there is power got somebody it is there i said it again you want me let's pour in your lips that amen is not good enough i'm saying to you there's power in your lips [Applause] there is power in your lips when you pray the devil tremble because you don't know what god will do with your prayer [Applause] remember do you understand that the prayers of the saints is stored in vials [Applause] your prayers [Applause] look at the abraham god told abraham through sarah you're gonna have that son of promise god did not speak to sarah so there was a problem to begin with sarah did not hear from god abraham to tell sarah god told me that you're going to have my child [Music] amen all right sarah i'm all right to say all right well i ain't sure about that my mind because i don't know you're too old because that was all right praise god abraham wright was to tell him tell her but god said sure sarah to tell abram but i don't believe it and abram tells sarah it doesn't matter [Applause] so because the lord [Applause] the bible said abraham believe god amen now watch it's one thing to believe god is the next thing to encourage somebody about what you believe after five years of encouraging sarah every morning is the same face with some more wrinkles after five years abraham don't know you have plenty more of those you're not hearing me this morning abraham don't know he has plenty more come on sarah god is good sarah don't forget to cook that morning she don't feel to make breakfast this morning she is frustrated and set up of hearing the testimony which is the spirit of prophecy she's tired of hearing abraham say god said so god going to be with us god going to bless her she's tired amen but abram was not tired because when god speaks to a man it gives him faith it gives him ambition and it gives him purpose a man that god speaks to can't give up come on now you must know a man that god has spoken to oh give the lord a shout of prayer [Applause] a woman that god speaks to you can't stop that woman look when the angel spoke to mary she's a young person she's not a big mature adult she's a young person and the angel says i heal mary you highly favored the lord is with thee she doesn't know that this is news the lord is with you all she had is one question how shall it be the holy ghost god i tell mary you are the holy ghost forget it the whole ego is continuing you isn't that right what did mary do she ran come on now that's what i'm talking when god speaks to you you have to act she runs her custody elizabeth to tell elizabeth i'm hoping to have a baby no she said i'm gonna have the christ his name is jesus and john waiting to hear his name based in the year jesus john was quiet all the time until he heard that name john started to rejoice in the womb of elizabeth nothing happened by chance come and say him and somebody your baby is dead your baby written he had the name and the word manifested is the interpretation of the name of god come on then seven times gonna roar out oh same as somebody you think you are dead but you are not you are waiting for the right word to be spoken for the right thing to be done that we could dash into the blessings of god maybe that might strike this morning oh hallelujah a possibility that's what samson saw and you could say once more once more once more because i had it before yeah i'm not saying i'm not hearing you once more means i had it before give me it once more and when we talk about redemption being redeemed not salvation being redeemed means you were somewhere before and we fail and god is bringing us back from a fallen condition so don't do like it then you're not part of the fall so i hope we take a box shot and blow out every self-righteous spirit in this building who think they're more right than who who take the more holier than who who think this and i forget about it for all have sinned and come short of the glory but god said he's going to restore and nothing going to stop it oh glory to god hallelujah nothing going to stop this restoration samson was the type of it and this tree that jordan saw the type of it let's get on into it oh praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah listen to this whoa oh my the first time there will come forth for the bright age a resurrection of that denominationalism will be a message and that's what we struck when we talk about the world being born into manifestation the brother branham prophesy that there will comfort a message that the full maturity of the world has turned again in its full power turning back against full power and being way over the people with the same signs wonders and miracles so god can't afford to have immature people manage power they will mess things up so god had to let the world take its full maturity the greenness baked out through trials and testings and so on isn't that right oh listen from bamboom lucas conglomerate caterpillar 1953 12th june by the brown during the time of joyous prophecy here speaking of the scripture we read amen the church was in a terrible condition backslid just prior the coming of the lord for the first time how the spirit come upon this prophet he forced all things he saw the condition of the jews he saw the condition of the church in this day now this prophecy of course like all other prophecy has a compound meaning a prophecy sometimes has a natural meaning then it has a spiritual meaning but it has a meaning listen of the last days towards the armageddon so the prophet with his prophetic eyes looking at this scripture fleshing it out pulling it out revealing it to show it connected to us in the last days now listen to these words he said now uh towards the armageddon the coming up of the last days the condition of the church spiritually in the last days now there are four great things here i want to mention that joel the prophet who was god's eagle climb up into the sphere of god and saw the day coming and joel saw it coming and i want to speak on the four great destroyers first it was the palmer one next was the lucas next was the cankerworm and the next was the caterpillar those destroyers were destroying the heritage of god divine oh hallelujah now you will check closely on your insects those four insects are the same insects in different form amen caterpillar lucas conquer women and so forth isn't that right just different forms if pentecost was god's vine which was the new vine that growed up let's find out what pentecost had and find out what we got lacking and then we ought to find out what the destroyer are and who they are and what did it right so are you with me this morning yes here we go are you ready is everybody ready say amen are you ready hallelujah that's funny and good people feeling literally ready the first thing that pentecost produced was brotherly love not the second not the third the first amendment it tore down the middle wall of partitions and meet brotherhood in such a way that everything in common in the bible paul spoke at his brotherhood he gave all the gifts of pentecost to church he said first corinthians do i speak with the tongue of men and angels i have not this love which brings the brotherhood i am nothing and do i have knowledge to understand all the mysteries of god i am still nothing without love the love of the brethren and jesus said this shall all men know my disciples that you have loved one for another isn't not right and jesus paul said let brother love continue that wasn't the first church but something taking place and then this fellow came by the name of palmer and he began to eat on the vine of bradley love has a mission his missiles and and weapons is for burnley love once you see bright love eating away got him all right so let's go down further now now watch okay let's let's read something here this is 85. now the pentecostal church comparing the two what happened he said no notice the first gif is wisdom the best gift and so on he said now hear this now i want to speak to ministers it's all right to have the nomination there's nothing against that but when the nomination isolate himself and separates his fellowship from his brethren that old company has eat the life out of it to begin with when we get to a place if you differ with a man why a man that i know i could i could see eye to eye with as close and scripted as anybody in the world is brother more sitting here now listen to what brother brown said here but we get times when we are million miles apart but didn't ever touch us no sir with his little wife over yonder answering the phone so much until she got almost a nervous breakdown last night crying on the phone oh praise the lord and he loves me well enough not because he gives a penny or money no sir but he flies that whole lockheed plane everything else to get over here to be with me every little bit i don't believe the night would ever be too dark or the rain would ever fall too hard but i'll climb and crawl to the jungles to get to him it's love yet we wouldn't agree unscripted by a hundred miles i am so glad that the palmer hasn't touched us yet but once cameron will touch you yeah what happened to fellowship so it has nothing to do with doctrine of what somebody believed love have nothing to do with somebody believe i show you love your mother or your father your brother is standing not in church with you [Applause] they're not going to your church but you love them because that's your mother or that's your uncle whether that's your auntie or whatever it is you love them they're glad to see them all right you ever see a dog vex the city master well you don't see myself you don't just turn around and just start walking there's another [Music] make his noises and back and so on why because the dog loves his master it's not right it's a lot of my way i'm showing it and if you keep running that dog you don't watch it still for you no he'll be angry at you why because you're not friendly with him you're not nice with him isn't that right praise the name of the lord but i went to a church here not long ago i thought they would never invite me back a bunch of simply woman but they was bobbing off their hair wearing lipstick i tore the thing apart sure did and i thought he would have feedback but you know what there was such an anointing of the holy spirit around the vine still like all power couldn't touch it at all it's like an electric fence the palmer worm can't get over the fence the shock of the holy spirit of love it will kill him every time brother if we need fences to build it ought not to be the enormous offenses it ought to be love fences to keep the insect out to keep the palmer worm out because he is the number one destroyer listen to this i don't care what a man believes whatever he believes he's got a right to come right back and tell me he don't believe these the things i've got the right to say little things that he doesn't believe but i don't belong to a pinnacle denomination because pentecost is not a denomination it is an experience oh blessed be the name of the lord praise the name of the lord are you with me the next thing come was the locust so first the fruit eat brotherly love food eaten next it come the locals come for the leaves and the leaves is the unity amen amen isn't that right he said okay america and he is the one who destroyed the unity of the believers in pentecost there was a unity isn't that right oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah praise the lord praise god so there's only one church there might be branded baptist presbyterian but it's only it's got to be a born-again experience so this locus what did it do they eat the leaves and they take the leaves what the parmesan left so them fellas work in a chef system one eat the fruit one eat the leaves and that's coming from the back and it's coming for the life itself that is the order of attack oh hallelujah just strip the church of his power yeah let something take god bloody love let something take all the leaves of fellowship let something take on the back of doctrine then there's only one thing left it's exposed now take and hit the light church is dead forms and they had the priests and they had a pulpit and they have the ministers and everything else and god move on because it kills it right there what did this uh lucas did destroy the leaves what at least for divine fellowship now he's a presbyterian we won't have nothing to do with him he's a nazarene he's pentecostal just that we won't have to do with him because he don't belong to our group that he look us at work yes yes are you with me amen what did the locusts do it took away fellowship what is fellowship what does the leaves do it make it cool where the birds fly under the leaves isn't that right and he should be like a tree planted when you look frustrated you come into the group and so on and you have a russian might you win and the leaves blow you get some fellowship you feel encouraged you feel revived that is what the leaves are for the lucas come to eat the leaves down go talk to this one go fellowship with this one don't go to convention by that one don't go to church by that one have nothing to do with that one that's the locust eaten that's a local spirit that's what i'll be loose in this message and some pastors welcome the local spirit he's a doctrine guy all kind of cuckoo stuff strip original doctrine you can't fight fighting the bible they could find the message but people preaching what kind of cuckoo stuff and then afterwards the last one is take the life there's not something there but you know what god said i will restore oh blessed be the name of the lord praise his holy name praise jesus jesus hallelujah hallelujah praise god amen now watch all of his former glory will return again as it was in the first what does god send the wind to do to shake the trees and every time you get a shaken it loosen up the root and cause you to go deeper and deeper and every time the holy ghost falls on the church in an old-fashioned revival it's shake up the roots so that it can get rooted and grounded that the storms and trial come upon it isn't that right i will restore seer the lord all of his former days have been eaten down one took out the baptismal one took all the joy out another took the holy ghost out another took healing out another took the kiss out and the first thing you know you ain't got no more but an old dead bleak bush standing there but somewhere under there god reserve life is coming on oh blessed be the name of the lord isn't that right the church here we go as long as there is an earth here god will have a church representing him i will restore share the lord all the glory of the former days i'll restore with the conquer one left i'll restore healing i'll restore the holy spirit i'll restore the joy i'll restore everything that the first church had i will restore it in the last days so elias has truly come and restored all things by prophecy hallelujah so we know the kind of church we're supposed to have a church with jesus walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp glory hallelujah glory to god amen do you believe that i can't get one called the nomination eat off the original back of brother isn't that right so help me god he said let me have the gumption all praise god to stand and preach the gospel tell the truth i've never compromised i wanted this because god told me these great signs that is being produced like the manifestation of resurrection it's god bless your heart hear what he's saying you know i won't leave you in that condition this is a direct prophecy to the bride i tell you what god said i always talk to you all that the caterpillar has eaten all the conqueror woman has eaten all the powers eating our restore say the lord so help me i make this prophecy before the coming of the lord the true apostolic fate the true apostolic teaching the true bible spirit the true it's on his word right now trying to eat his grate up to grow out again supper the banana prophecy the true apostle spirit will be restored to the church in the last days it's not right you believe that isn't that right you saw you say four dead messengers eat down the tree isn't that right and four life messengers was gonna restore it so god raised up luther isn't that right praise god and wesley and pentecost and then he said william random with the word isn't that right abraham fate isn't that right isaac love jacob craze i'm joseph the capstone word the headstone word perfection so god put the perfection word to restore to get us back into position for the fullness of the power to come back amongst the people oh i feel good this morning oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord do you believe that four killers stick it out four messengers destroyed it and four misses of death took it away and god sent four messengers of life oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god do you believe that first line justification then signification then the baptism the holy ghost then the coming of the cap what is it the holy ghost bunch being hold out so it can fit with the same kind of ministry so what are we talking about god promised a holy ghost bunch not an intellectual bunch a holy ghost bunch a bunch of people filled with the holy ghost that he could now begin to cut and shape and prune and hone to fit you in with the same kind of ministry because eve wasn't another creation eve came out of adam and the bride came out from christ so the bride came from out of the word so the bread can be off the word because you come from the word itself so when the word is preached the bride will say amen [Applause] oh my god oh blessed be the lord so he finally got trevor mystery number one to reveal himself he was too mysterious he did it in christ number two to have the preeminence in the people called the bride number three to restore about the kingdom why would god restore the kingdom and there's no evil eve and adam was placed in the garden of eden isn't that right that's the place where he placed the man and woman the man fell and got kicked him out no car's going to restore that eden not to say i have a nice healer no he has to restore that evil back into the original into the evening again [Music] the devil is filling because god purpose can be god purpose can't be stopped so when the devil thought he was finished what he didn't know is that i will restore because there is coming a second atom [Applause] that second arm is jesus christ he's coming for you hallelujah you and i we are fallen eve oh hallelujah to take us back to eden we are going back somewhere we don't belong here oh do you believe that oh praise god oh hallelujah oh glory to god my my mind are you ready for some deeper stuff i'm on you ready for some deeper stuff what oh a great revelation now to restore back his kinship to bring back now he had to let them get lost [Music] that's deep that's very deep he had to let them get lost he could not make them sin he could not make them sin and remain god and then punish him for something he made but when we put man on partnership with him and let man act as a free moral agent you act any way you want to you are a free moral agent so therefore if he put the first like this he has to put the second like this he had to put everybody on the same basis now notice in bringing back in letting that man do that knowing he would do that what did he do to display his attribute as a savior the whole purpose is left in jesus christ to become god to take the penalty of death to redeem the wife that was lost by rejecting him so when you see the picture of garden of eden you see it beautiful now when you see it in his fullness of his revelation that god had all these attributes locked up in him and he couldn't reveal it until man fall he couldn't take man and push him down he couldn't say man trip yourself and fall no you have to leave man let the decisions and choices work out so when the devil thought he had won on god god had one on him when the devil thought he was throwing down god's whole future and plan what the devil didn't understand is that this give god the opportunity to unveil himself reveal himself in the fullness of his redemption plan [Applause] so whether as a bride which is fallen eve or as a tree i will restore because the devil came and knocked on eve in the beginning then when god turned into tree form bright tree he come with his counter woman caterpillar to eat on the tree until they come into a stump until his thumbs at the prophet's eye i'm coming back the devil have no more teeth to eat it was finished there was nothing more to eat so now when we start to move up nothing's gonna stop this right i wonder if you're getting what i'm saying hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah listen along the way as the nomination form got cut off this branch cut off this branch cut on his badge but this tree that was eaten down to the stump when this had to push out nothing is cutting off you know this is i will restore this is god himself in the seed in you fulfilling his own prophecy come on now this is god fulfilling the prophecy in your life to raise you up where you belong come on out and lift you up oh man do you see that this morning hallelujah you may be seated oh hallelujah it got to be inspired to you you got to understand that eve was fallen and god wouldn't leave her fallen if god leave him full that the devil had the upper hand then the devil could taught and throw and to change god's purpose and plan but god has to bring back eve to prove to the devil this eve that will not fall he said this bride is different this despite different listen you will be seated the difference between this eve the first even this eve is this the first eve was hiding behind the world but this eve is the word glory are you see what i'm saying now the first evil she was supposed to stay behind the word that was given to her by your husband amen god said this but this eve is different this eve becomes the word and the word cannot be defeated anywhere anytime under any condition the world can never be defeated jesus proved that but he said it is written it is written it is also written oh hallelujah that's why the devil james is try to get you off the wood because once you get off the world you get off the power you get off your strength oh are you with me you may be seated oh hallelujah praise god to notice in bringing that back and letting man do that knowing what he would do he displaced actually the savior and when eve went away from the word she went away from a mate and when the church goes away from the word to denomination she rejects and comments fornication with the world of man's wisdom and rejecting the authority of god's word not when the bride or the church or a member leave a church she committed adultery because it passes the husband to her that is foolishness that is nonsense amen that that applies in a certain context you as christ's wife he is your husband and he is the word if the man preached the word you are hearing direct from your husband if the man don't preach the word he is off there's another man that you're hearing from but christ is the word and as long as we preach the word you are hearing from your husband who is your maid the revealed word is your husband isn't that right okay so watch okay now notice his threefold purpose the manifest himself and jesus have the preeminences now we see the mystery he had hit before the foundation of the world praise god and he's had to read it didn't want to get to paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god now it's not addressed to the world but his address to the at the emphasis to the saints isn't that right amen how do you get into christ by joining church no by birth now watch grace be unto you and peace heavenly places i wish i had time here to mark that it's the believer's position in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world when did he choose us before the foundation of the world when this great hidden mystery he chose us in christ before the foundation of the world here we go watch i have predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to good pleasure of his will here we go this is where i get my inspiration from predestinated there's the mystery he before christ or anything else was ever on earth you see this great mystery that he would choose in a choose a bride knowing eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it amen now you see the secret what to to restore for eve so the great secret with god unfolding with abraham faith and isaac love and jacob all of that all the prophets all the sages and so forth all of that was to bring forth a bride so he was only expressing and joseph expressing in moses apart apart in jacob apart mysteries being unfolded as these brothers and sisters live their lives out he was expressing in part what he was going to do in his fullness in the last days oh hallelujah are you with me so watch he said god took a rib from under his side and took eve out of it and god did the same thing taking out the side of christ the blood the water and christ is the word and taking the word and making up his church making up his church from the word isn't that right back to himself god great mystery being unfolded prefigured all the way on down oh praise the name of the lord the pride oh here we go praise be to jesus what did he do he opened adam's side took part of his flesh which was adam to make eve the bride here we go has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on creeds she cannot stand on the nomination she cannot stand on good behavior did you hear that she can't even stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word for she is part of it for she was taken from christ do you understand how much of the world you must become you can't act because somebody act like that no is that the word well this husband behave so is that the word this wife behave like that is that the word it has to come back to the world are you with me okay here we go this is serious and to be sure the whole rapture now luther was apart whereas he was a part the prophet was apart just in the revelation that they were making up the body you mean lute is a part of the rapture that's right we shall not hinder those that are asleep that are sleeping is part of the whole rapture you know it's a bright body this is not the entire body you know this is the capstone headstone ride we had a cap and the rest is in the ground and we like that head mark they're gonna pull them out of the ground but all that is in the ground they are bright who receive the word for their age they are bright members already sealed away in christ hallelujah waiting for the resurrection call waiting for the trumpeter's song waiting for the trump of god isn't that right they are in the earth waiting for the voice of the archangel resurrection call are you with me hallelujah so watch just in the revelation they were making up the body feet toes arms until the head that makes the entire rapture it's the body of the word amen which is christ outside of that you are lost i don't feel good you are what your relationship is what your fellowship is what your organization is you are lost outside the world being in you and then he went under quotes in john 15 if he abided me and my word abide in you you can ask what you will or you're going to bring forth fruit and much fruit and so forth isn't that right so it means if the word is in you that if he abided me and my words are burning away you're gonna ask what you will you'll be a bride of authority this ain't gonna be a jokey bride this is not church member pride this be a pride will be just like jesus christ this will be jesus in bright form oh glory you'll be healed like him you'll be praying like him you'll be cast out devils like him you'll be raising a dead like him oh yes he'll be performing miracles like him because it will be him inside of you oh glory to god the signs and wonders will be evident of the preeminence inside of your life [Applause] that would vindicate the second part of his threefold mystery to have the preeminence and a bride so the revelation is to bring on preeminence how could we have preeminences and have to strike i am nothing i hate myself self goes out of the way come on same as somebody [Applause] nobody is hating themselves so self is right there the bible said men shall be lovers of themselves amen but job said i hate myself i repent in dust and ashes the revelation brought him our stripping of self and before god could have the preeminences self must get kicked out [Music] amen's disappearing right now we have a vanishing of demons [Applause] that is self don't want to see amen i want the seed in you to see amen amen 60 saying amen you got to die [Applause] all those guys who were pressurizing job god wanted to hear from them the same testimony they hate themselves you want your blessing go what god go what see what you say i hate myself hallelujah god bless jokes so much you gotta pray for them go let my servant pray for you oh hallelujah praise god god gonna put you in such a position of power that your enemies critics what not gonna send them you have to pray for them so you better be prayed up you better be in the spirit god god bless you so much your cop could run over praise god it will let go you can't even hide your blessing no more it will come out your mouth come to your eyes your ears your hands when you lay hands upon the sick they will recover you can't even help it it will speak for itself your anointing going to be all over you over your mind over your conscience over your memory your thoughts will move on god thought's gonna move in your words gonna be god words you're always gonna be flying on like a spark of an anvil hallelujah glory to god with their babies or their children sick and they wouldn't want to send them a prayer request i could see them lay their hands upon their child and say devil get out no come on out the devil and go hallelujah praise god i could see you go into a hospital bed and before i even reach the patient

to be jesus christ the same yesterday's at the end forever oh glory to god not yesterday in the prophet but today right here no faith ears now let the god that spoke the world let the god that wrote the word let that god come forth how many want to see him you may see that praise god that's what the greeks came and said sir we will see jesus we're not seeing coming to say sir we want to hear some more teachings we had them for 40 plus years we want to see jesus now [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen and somebody is right standing here give her a track no she said my readers already should take her and go home but jesus was not a truck or some book hallelujah the whole like when a woman read that jesus was real he was promised fulfilled he was something to shout

chris eat it down god said i will restore again in the last days it will be restored you want to know how god shall send the holy ghost which is not a bunch of people no who calls the holy ghost not them no god shall send the holy ghost in such a way upon planted word that will restore could we give the lord a shout out god in other words all things have to be restored in you which is the follower the secret is the word is in the bride the secret is the word is in you and because the word is in you you have a promise of rain even lettering oh glory to god it shall come to pass afterwards i will pour out my spirit and your mentality visions all shall dream dreams come on see him as somebody so god promised in the last days to pour his spirit upon planted word for 40 plus years ministry of the word 40 plus years planted word 40 plus years adoption seven thunders new name play 304 40 plus years is not right price revival isn't that right praise god he said you're created by the scripture that during the time of the restoration of the temple was a great prince among the people who laid the foundation as we read on further he said god said yes the rule we're going to lay the foundation with his hands and also shall bring forth the headstone i want you to notice he never said he shall break for the cornerstone he shall bring for the headstone now we know that the scriptures say jesus is the chief cornerstone he also has a headstone here we go are you ready now if you will think for a few minutes that the seventh church's messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words here we go rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit say the lord not by organization not by denomination but by the holy spirit god will bring for the church in the last days what a prophecy he's prophesying that one day a key going to be turned and the church has to be rebuilt in the power of the spirit [Applause] that ought to be your expectation that is what you walk in this tabernacle glory to god hallelujah you may be caesar that is how you have to walk into the church looking for the power of the spirit looking for heaven to open up looking for the power to be beaten among the people coming right off the word of god that is your expectation oh gloria you can't come here ordinary you can't communicate come here last week or last month you got to come here like simeon on the expectation because messiah is promised he's the one we're going to worship he's the one we're going to praise seven thunders him moving in and out [Applause] [Music] [Applause] glory national force put israel in the homeland national force will put the church in the world council churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord give the lord a shout of praise o glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god we're doing fine there's two more cooks but he said it's a total separation we have not to go back into the world no more have anything to do with the world she is separated from the cares and tradition of churches she is separated only to god not to a church the bride is separate or do you see yourself as a pride you separated to god isn't that right watch and god is the word and as husband and wife is one stood as the bride and the word becomes one for the world is living through the bride that's her credentials that's her identification so the bride identification is not the belonging to this group or belonging to this convention or belonging to this move the bride identification will be the word living when the devil asks for your id card you bring out the card word listen and the devil will know it because you can't bluff it he felt the word living before and when he got shot from the first word i was living he don't want to get that shock again so he know to move on hallelujah when you see your identity god world living come on same as somebody that's what the devil will begin to see world living oh hallelujah i'm standing with the word i'm breathing in the word i'm living the word oh
