lot of God will drop down this is a day this glorious day and I think I'm on a birth of my son Daniel he came out a different way halfway inside the head out and started to pray and the doctor said if

special but Anthony I'm no longer play and then so if you have your Bible the light that goes straight to the wood tonight reading just one portion of Scripture reading from Ephesians one and reading from verse three Ephesians 1 and verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having me known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on it even in him in who also we have obtained an inherent inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word carry bow our heads for wit of Prayer heavenly father any man could read the scriptures but it takes the Holy Ghost to breathe life upon his father Lord may you speak to your people tonight me use me as your instrument Lord me you annoying the words of what we said may you bless the word and the reading of the word Lord and open our understanding Lord me tonight be an IP will never forget father me your Holy Spirit take complete charge tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you may be seated so I have a title tonight it's possessing your individual inheritance and I have a subject another holy time is here and I have an inspiration the higher law of the eighth day the higher law of the East D and in a message personal experience with God with the random cell what we need today is a good old fashioned seeing Paul's revival and the baptism of the Holy Ghost like fell on the day of Pentecost to bring a people back to a living faith in God again that's exactly I believe in confessions to raise up and accept Jesus Christ as good I believe in all that but friends we need something more than that so I believe this meeting and my design my heart is to have more than just a service more than just a meeting but an experience with the supernatural with the baptism of the Holy Ghost like they had on a team of Pentecost them but the Branham said the thing of Pentecost was the a better day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell on the eighth day so I'm happy to be identified with an eighty holy convocation and you know that Aaron's rod was dead for years but when it was left overnight in the presence of God it brought what buzz blossom and brought forth fruit because it was in the right place it was they are the right time and something has to happen and whenever you are in the right place at the right time something has got to happen now Aaron's rod could have only brought forth what was the genetic code of that rod and rather than a broad four coconuts it could not have brought four apples it has to be whatever that rod was so even though the rod was bare that it looked like it has no life the genetic structure of the have not been compromised genetic structure of the rod has not been brought under the netting structure of the rod have not been tampered with them maybe you come to this meeting looking to get something more than yesterday but maybe you are tired maybe you are wearing maybe you are frustrated I have good news for you the genetic code that have been written inside your genes have not been damaged it has not been compromised if I look dry but son of man have these dry bones live on a man and this rod come back to life then the church came and so I've got the news for you God doesn't want to replace you he's not in the replacement business God is in the restoration business he wants to restore you eyes will restore fear the Lord restoration has nothing to do with you if that I will restore it's not even your effort he is the one doing the restoration I will restore unto you I will restore your joy I will restore your people I will report injury I will refer your family I will refer your loved ones we have a rapport what the devil took from you I will restore your wealth I will restore your health I will restore your can I get a witness and the house this morning the night God wants to restore to the position you would have had if man has never fallen for a piece of test this morning it was not your fault that man fell we were not even there it was Adams fault because of Adam we fell as a result of it but God wants to resort you and I to the position we would have had if Adam had never fallen can the trip payment Oh mind you maybe keep it can I get a little more mnemonic to speech god bless you you may be seated for a minute I got some good news for you many of us we see me don't want to get old we are afraid of getting old well I've got some news for you are older than you appear hallelujah Tenace to the church the couple with who you are older than you appear because before the earth was you were before the Sun was you were before there was a moon you were you are already under Sun you are all that any earth you are all of them or you don't hear me tonight you are all ur than the devil because you are keen attribute of God he fought the devil had a beginning he will have an enemy but we are creatures of eternity we are older than what we appear whatever what mutable what young devil the piece of son an absolute ton of the spirit that existed in the fact Adam or you will hear me tonight Oh glory hallelujah you may be seated so don't take my ears for granted don't take our look for granted I'm an old soul I come from corn I go back to God he was there when we kicked the devil out of heaven if we were there he will take him out on this earth also because we shall reign on the earth this land belongs to me this earth belongs to me sir please know who you are the Lions know who you are that's why the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God and the thirteen Oh hallelujah hallelujah we are creatures of eternity we are not treated of time we are creatures of another dimension we are from another world and listen we live by a higher law we live by the law of the anything when we enter the is in the law of wonder seven matters more you may be seated we're gonna get it oh but I can God I thank God that his numerology I've never ever gone wrong but the random you may be seated when he was speaking about the empty he said keep your numbers running he says one two three four five six seven he said you think you got me on you take with the eight days goes back to the first day he said the church ages that in the seven one two three of Isaac seven but if NASD is different he said that eternity eternal he never had a beginning anything doesn't have an ending he is they always want he is your king he is you you belong to the ending you belong to a different place but you belong to the world you live by a different law [Applause] [Music] very fitted halleluyah halleluyah get the dipper law you may be seated young people you might walk in the same places that the people in the world walk but there's a different law when you walk the devil knowed you was different he can't figure it out but he knows you are not from here he knows there's something about you he can't pin it down but you are creature of eternity listen you may be seated that's one of the biggest promise devil has a Jew you know because he has a em coming he has an ending coming but you have no ending so you can look at the devil in the face no matter what he says to you as a devil one of these days time no longer and when time no longer and when time runs out it means the devil and his words run out and when time runs out only the eternal will be left standing only the creatures who are connected evening will remain standing oh I'm so glad for 20th century prophet is a spring revelation above the 8th King about the holy convocation of people who can receive it and the church amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so true for knowledge God could be dancin 8u it's because he knew him before so your destiny a guarantee because he already knew what school you would go to he knew what job you would have he knew what village you'd be born in you know what school you go to what church you will go to and he knew that you would find his message and his method would find you to connect you back to your identity because when you came and left eternity as a thought to be expressed in time you forgot where you came from so something has to kind of wake you up so not you a little bit to let you know that when you were drinking smoking doin whatever you were doing that there was something else that was troubling your heart you realize where the Rev intended something more polite and waking up in the morning and going to work there's something more to life and fees or bills there's something more to life and trying to impress them they were next to you that there's something more to life as having black teens and having arthritis and having high blood pressure there's something there's more to lag here's a different law where there is no high blood pressure there's a different law where there's no I brightness there's a different place where is no tiredness of it here's another world where there is no depression there's none of places where there is no death there's another place where there's no crying it's an eternity if an eternal place and the trickiness Oh hallelujah hallelujah money payment somebody say hallelujah so we are going to our place you may be seated we have a destination we are not just existent exist there are many people who was it existed there just killing time but time is not the currency of our economy [Applause] Oh hallelujah hallelujah that's why a spirit active we are changing currencies socata please swear when you speak it's creative call it up like I said you could be mounted ship a little bit let's wait because heaven is on our destination mr. pirate as we shall reign on the earth yes earth belong to me the devil is squattin he has no legal right but for all these years God have been waiting 12 people the 30 eviction notice you may be seated for a minute you may be seated for a minute I want you to catch something God is the judge the sentence has already been that never has to evict but when a judge gives the order for eviction they have to be somebody being brought the order and we know the Holy Ghost is the enforcer but even though the Holy Ghost is the enforcer God still has the place the Holy Ghost inside of individual to move the Holy Ghost around so when he had to go to Cornelius and he has all you know you know with me this on him when he had to go to these people they had to be somebody he could use Atticus leave me he can make a deposit also holding us in them I'm not a transfer to take place young people God is looking for somebody we can make a deposit of the Holy Ghost in we can move it around from country to country some neighborhood the neighborhood who your family come to trust a man oh you maybe keep oh how many we are you may be seated so I'm not talking about church this is not about church to its age is over we are talking about the bride we're talking about a new creation we are talking about not being just members but uh Peter said this morning the breaker goes where the church members cannot group the frightened experience but it just remember can never experience is I love that brother Peter Oh how many we are the church member you're going to wind them up complicate things shouted but the prize because he knows who she is she needs no encouragement when she sees her lover the word when he sees the groom in view he gets excited every single time because he's in love he's in love he is in love she loves the world he loves to worship she loves to be the atmosphere when he's around he gets a kite there a difference between the church member and the pride of Jesus right oh you may be seated hallelujah mine who you are calls for a different age you are called for a different experience you are cause it takes something that only if you can understand and young people I love to speak to young people natural solutions I always say this cannot solve spiritual problems your problem is not much more education and much more training your problem is you need a Holy Ghost natural solution an assault spiritual problems your depression is not because of finances your depression is you need more the Holy Ghost because if you have the Holy Ghost he can lead you to the right Java he can open the right door what we need is a Holy Ghost what we need is a spiritual solution and the church a man what the world need is Jesus yes we might have mine battle you may be seated yes my things might be bad but God will have a people God will have some young people who will say no no to what the devil has offered note for the devil's temptation no to everything that he has can attest amen you may be seated for a minute hallelujah can somebody didn't know can't imagine only loud wonderful you may be seated why did you do that but I say become we need some more young people look at they no note that there was offer whatever he brings to you you respond to no I don't see how good I look it's no why because I'm on a destination to a different place I don't want your offer I don't want what you're given to me I don't want it because I don't belong here I'm not going to be satisfied that was a warrant offered because I'm a creature of eternity only eternal peace that satisfy me and the church payment Oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated for a minute so I was looking at that scripture I'm not eating a holy convocation it says a powerful tool it there'll be no servile work therein and I just was meditating on that no servile work therein and I went to do some research in at work survived and what that servile work means and that would servile is connected to slavery so it means when that if they comes it means your day of doing stuff that you are forced to do is over and many young people say I want to give up this and I want to stop doing better my heart wants to do the right thing more than that servile work is defined as when there's a job to do and there's a physical component and a mental component but the physical component far exceeds the mental so it's when you're working almost like a drone you're working because you are forced to work you're working because you are pressured to do it without having to think about it that's how the children of Israel were in Egypt it was servile work it was not their creativity it was not their ideas they will posture bring the ideas that the Egyptians wanted but when he is there come it's a different day altogether there's no more survivors there's no more doing what the devil wants you to do there's no more taskmaster there's no more you have to smoke you have to drink it you have to love you have to have jealousy no no no no no no no more survivor parent that is your needs we breathe when that a big hunk it's actually time you can put down your tools that you have been working with and you can claim back your inheritance because it be evening give no more work in that me so I declare tonight that in the only time if another truly who the bride of Jesus Christ and the devil that I've been holding you they have got to let you go o blessed be the name of the Lord you may be feeling what do you say my Isaac the Egyptians we see today you will see them no more forever it's time I put a devil he has had in case the operator for the devil and I thought into that 18 he cannot go with the eternity he has no access to that world because it is your world it is your kingdom and the church demon Oh hallelujah mine on my ume shilling [Applause] hallelujah second Chronicles 7:14 says if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land if my people and the first time the Bible uses my people is in Exodus 3 7 when the Bible says and a lot that I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and observe their cry by reason of the attachment during Noah's sorrows I want you to understand friends that God had already promised their deliverance but even though there was a promise over them he still have to wait till he hear the cries of the people and when he heard the cries he remembered the promise it was under the tax masses under the slave masters who kept them to anything that they didn't want to do because they were forced to do it the taskmaster was keeping them doing the sin and the bondage and the building or whatever it is so whenever you don't feel Ike worshipping it because it's a taskmaster and you you shouldn't worship when you don't see like rain it's because it's a mass of that's over you and you don't breathe because it's ABS method to control your timer the path master control when you wake up in the morning master hell you want to eat the wizard master tell you what time to go together and the cheerin of either the tire of the pack master is telling them to get up in the morning I'm going to this person I get up in the air going to that and the fact master was too much until the terminal things are being a prize they're going to sign and as we begin a crime God began together and clapping as a hero and the noise came up to God and God listen have to do something about it he couldn t hear it and not do anything about it because he hear it and leave them alone because God had to respond to the call and the church payment Holloway repeated and two hundred thousand thousand demons two hundred thousand thousand taskmasters have been assigned to stop you from hearing this message the turn of Israel were born into slavery in Egypt yet as we were born into sin because of Adam and the past masters have been with us in our schools and the jobs but it has always been a covenant that is a freedom coming yes in a covenant not a deliverer always coming there's a covenant that there's an opportunity coming to get out of here fear of what you would have had him forever but God made a promise here or did not know that it was a time limit on his operations here I didn't know that he was operating under the constraint of time but God's promise doesn't limit itself like time so God knew his people had to come out of Egypt he would be Emperor season this was yet destination was not Egypt there was an inheritance that they had to go to and whatever God had to do he was going to do to get them out and the church came it you may be seated and I could imagine that Pharaoh I've heard a rumor that a deliverer was coming they needed some money coming as a rumor coming and it was only a rumor but there came a time like no other time when God had to do something and Moses came on the scene but I want to be clear tonight that tonight we did time up Satan time up Pharaoh we have seen our names we know who we are we know our promises we know what our heritance is we know this is our team so break out of the change to bring out of the shackles to put down our thousands to put down our tools and head to the promised land these I'm talking to stop the life he's taught me to stop you but that life and you can never be stopped and the chest Amen somebody gives a lot of shout of praise [Applause] you may be seated friends we are not promised a system Jesus wouldn't have nothing to do with the system we wasn't promised a system what was he promised a kingdom how do you get into it by one spirit we are all baptized into this kingdom if the kingdom of God a kingdom of eternal life with an eternal king give importance eternal words with an eternal people predestinated to eternal life he is the king we are baptized into it settled in heavenly glory hallelujah nested be the name of the Lord under the banner cárdenas we are dead our lives are hidden God through Christ not only that but we are raised with him raise up what in a system or denomination organization no we are resurrected in the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is within you why's all these man-made systems month for not once more I'll shake the world but I'll shake heaven and the things that cannot be shown is what will remain and we receive a kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot be shook or move that's the kingdom of God not a system not a political will not a denomination but a kingdom and if subjects are dead the systems of this world that would be the corner men I was talking about gather the de systems of this world is subject as dead that these organizations is their cities political systems and now we are in this kingdom a kingdom that Kennedy moves all these other things are falling apart the Prophet said America is falling apart Europe is falling apart Asia is falling apart all the world is falling apart but we are in a kingdom and eternal Kingdom it cannot be moved holla - Amen hallelujah man so in the message of future home of the heavenly bridegroom and us be bride in seven great these days but that was only a type of the seven Church ages all right let's take the last piece which is the feet of the tabernacle no note at the end a thirty six seven days shall you offer offerings made of fire under the Lord but on the ESC on the ATS shall be a holy convocation there's another holy time coming fully convocation unto you and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord and it is a solemn assembly and you shall do no servile work there is and now we got an eight-piece now there's only seven days but here we speak of the easy holy convocation do no work in it it is what back to the verses it speaks of eternity now he is he Jesus rings for justification he eternal King with eternal signal to be baptized include to eternal life not seven days have nothing to do with any of the games it's speaking of another internal kind big enough for eternal world now notice after fifty games or seven tablets on there again they come another holy convocation what happens and this is my desire the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost on the eighth day now this is your promise this is my promise this is what I'm looking for another tier Pentecost because that fear pentacle is BSB here is your holy convocation for the banner says it has nothing to do with a literal it has nothing to do with your build it has nothing to do with your problems you have nothing to do with how you feel it has nothing to do with if you're tired it has nothing to do with what's happening at home it has nothing to do with your problems it has nothing to do with the literal things it's beyond that into the kingdom of God with eternal life oh my my mind you may be seated with the commitment cognition with the pretense that never they stopped even if Alan said the president has never been stopped it never started on anything he wasn't fazed on anything you was always taste he's have come to redeem that but you will say from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with somebody shout hallelujah you have eternal life to begin with you may be seated not only have some people they can understand this excitement that you had eternal life to begin with because you know you have your trouble then you have your child and you're you're testing what utility you talking about if you know what my reality is you ain't tell me about eternity but I'm telling you there is a greater reality than your present reality you were always in God you were always in God if your memory could go back to before there was a moon before there was a God has a reacts of the factors where was now when I lay the foundations of the earth such talk is memory so where were you I want you to kind of remember that you come from a different place but it so let your trials get you down don't let your temptation get you found it soon as your problems that you found well about when I lay the foundations of the earth and the morning buzz [Applause] you may be seated and by the banners that we have lived through all these types in here but when you hit the edge you go on into eternity you don't come my lord and rituals and orders you come by protecting me there's a genuine holy convocation and we are ending the seven churches churches of Pentecostal is you see it we are entering the holy convocation we are entering into the real genuine eternity where the church is called not the temptation some denomination but into eternity your calling and into eternity with the eternal King my to the AP what does it mean it means freedom the ADA means restoration the AC means redemption he means Pentecost he sa me the superchips if there means another vision the enemy is a baptism of the Holy Ghost he ain't Amy's your family have got to come dat means you get the Holy Ghost he hate it means you are something he ate it means you are affected dat means you are no longer freedom time but you are treated with charity you can be walking the earth but you are infinitely walking under you eternity walking into the eternity walking on your charm eternity support to come back eternity to look at the strong assess if we tell that eternity eternity will be real enough people unwanted at eternity put on put on left and this model will be immortality and will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye oh can attest a man he is he mean that all that Adam Lanza is coming back that a manifested comes of course it shouldn't happen in the first day it wouldn't happen in the second day it couldn't happen in the Baldy what in Disney now after the seven days in a bride age is the eight days robot has no devil yes no demon there's no spirit get those pills there's no doubt there's no unbeliever yes nothing to stop the fries from taking her position this is nothing to stop the prize from possessing these are individual inheritance Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah my my my my my you see before Adam self Adam was living in eternity there was no death there was no sickness are you with me Adam didn't know what that was he didn't know what thickness was he didn't know what it was to be depressed all Adam knew to do but if he didn't like weather mountain once he could move the mountain a little bit if you wanted to talk with a lion you can call a lion over Adam have perfect Dominion control but when Adam fell it brought time and it broke out of eternity so it be brings us back into the ability but I want to get it here's a different law when you're in time then when you are into eternity and the tournament because in time you have gravity so when Ibrahim said at the Rec book here when you lift your hand you are defying the law you will defy the laws of gravity so it means whatever laws exist and time can be defined by a higher law here's a lord a coven 217 and it's a different law pretty easy so when you in the seven-day law you and that time but in that seven-day law somebody could be dead but when you bring the ad in contact with the 17 law that dead life forget string from the is be doin Jesus stood outside of the tomb of Lazarus they were in time but he's a creature of abilities he could sleep from the eternal the power that was open what the seventh is our what it is our was another place that was or not even sometimes and even Lazarus comport Lazarus already left what that voice was able to cut through dimension spiral Lazarus was traveling because it was a higher law and the church payments you may be seated and whenever there is a law mister seventy law it brings a seventy laws under subjection so Stephen is sleeping on the boat the boat is something the 70 law and the Windham and the storm come he's it is sleeping he is tired that is I was out frustrated what are we going to do there wake his ass up Jesus looked at the stone he looked at the sky he looked at them and he never eats the eternal world water from a language spoken on the eighth day and I said he please kill and when that strong heard those words and recognizing what that man's vision that was at 70 law that was the law being amen you may be seated young people that's why you are going to make it I'm not going to get the Holy Ghost because of eating your soul it's not a natural fear it's a repeat of these seven names it's a eternal see that seed never had a beginning never has an ending for your predestination is stronger than your trials your predestination is stronger than your mistakes your predestination is stronger than your failures your predestination and stronger than the table without power you're projecting nation is stronger than the devil he can attain your predestination from you God himself and he doesn't have power he doesn't have power to reach every eight day you may be seated you may be seated hallelujah so when you feel down and you get a charge from your theophany your piata me is not trapped by the 17 your company is coming from eternity he's bringing strength of the ACA he is his major presence of God it because God dwells in eternity that's where all the power is the power is in eternity and that was a devil is afraid of because one eternity trapped down here he is finished Hara let them fire Paul we are in a 18 holy convocation we are in a new king I don't know what's going to happen I don't know what's going to take place but I believe young people are going to be baptized another Kingdom because if he ate me another day of Pentecost and the church famous [Applause] we're receiving the julienne to your joy it's not from the natural your joy could never be satisfied because your appetite has already been introduced to aid their joy your appetite has already been introduced that the victory of the entity your appetite you have already been introduced to success from the SD so nothing that will have to offer you could I can show you anymore that's why when you're not insured you feel miserable you know your humors rural when you're not in the presence of God because your appetite has already been introduced to some energy is so good you can try them on the substitute but it never is as good as a boot on the ATP it can never taste as good from the RAM of eternity if I cap your destination its eternal life you are not supposed to tire you are supposed to have eternal life but you are not supposed to be sick you are supposed to walk over signature and in this easy we will walk over tired we will walk over handsome we will walk over female transition because he cannot exist in the SBS and the idiot only creatures that have no beginning could be there and fixes how to beginning that never had a beginning you're trying harder beginning your problem you know when your problem status in our beginning it must come to an end and the 50 men hallelujah somebody give us how to pray hallelujah oh my you may be seated I love that you know when your problems done you know when the pins happen in your body once you can identify just a point it means as an enemy because when a parent has no salvation there was no beginning to it he was always he he was already to know if you can identify the starting point it's coming to an end I can't identify my stopping point because I always was always was part of God and there's no devil to take my name out there's no demon had take me out of God's thoughts when he was there all by himself before there was a moon before there was not fast he was thinking about me he was thinking about you you maybe pieces humility for a minute what mistakes that had a beginning cut copy eternal plan of thought for your life what could you have ever done that had a beginning when you began fornicating that to never stop the eternal kind of God for your life because in and one occasion had a beginning it was of an ending because of power the eternal power of God to destroy everything suhara beginnings everything that can be shaken will be shaken and only what eternal will remain maybe seated hallelujah hallelujah Oh hallelujah maybe see the higher law is thing the higher law of eating is the proved there is a higher law when they nailed Jesus to the cross they all thought you were dead even the devil himself understand this even the devil with all of his years of experience thought Jesus was finished and Jesus when he rose from the dead he introduced a new law that confused even the devil because while the travel is having a celebration there's a knock on the door the giver wait a minute we invited all the VVIP to celebrate Jesus Moses was trouble Ibrahim was trouble Elijah was trouble but this Jesus was railroaders so when we cut leaders on the cross he the devil torture can celebrate but while the devil is celebrated there was a knock on the door this knot was not supposed to happen because under the law of the 17 when you were dead you're supposed to be dead but Jesus was not funded 17 so you look at me now with a Joey and I'm 16 elements but I'm not on the 17 I'm not from Trinidad I'm not from this world I'm an alien I'm not from this world I come from God I don't know in fact of course you may be seated so Jesus he walked and open the door the devil is like who is this and here comes Jesus he does need to ask permission because the higher law the idiot never needs to ask permission well if the idiot just power when you speak it has happened so trust was in the battle just within even understand what was going on but we called you within his emphasis the Prophet said he was able to connect to DSD how many needed more life you can see some standstill and trust we didn't even understand the mechanics that is not the Sun less movement is the earth that's moving but God has a translatory angels if they're sometimes they'll stop the earth move this part put things in place it isn't matter what has to happen what about oh really anything I needed something [Music] so out of here we're chillin alright now when you recreate this as they sort of come back home God will move mountains he will move subways he will move planes but he was also like that to bring that back to the house of God huge pivot I told you I'm a spare tire I'm definitely encourage you tonight you may be seated but I pray this encourages somebody tonight to know that you have more power you have acceptable power and they never want you to realize that ever wanted is be acquired and be a normal church member but it is not about church is about you accessing who you really are when you recognize me from wait a minute I always want I always will see because I'm a part of course and once a holy Lopez isn't kind of my soul it's all over me it's keeping me alive and the whole ego is what connects you to your destination can the church amen [Applause] so under the law of seven days the Lord tells because you fell in sin you finished because you make a mistake write them off ZOA limits with his higher law oh you may be seated there was a woman when Jesus was a year it was not a report that was me it was not here see there was some believers who caught her in the very act of adultery and what do we heard about it he was caught in the very act and they brought her to Jesus because they were thinking under the laws of the 70s but when Jesus looked at the situation Jesus knowing that there's another law he didn't respond to their demand their judgments he just asked him a question you without sin cast the first tool no problem if you want to go by the law of the 70s stone no problem yes but wait up you with nothing Houston and Jesus do not embarrass them he turned it back so that they could look at themselves it was no longer teeth looking at them but they had to look inside and one by one they have to recognize you know what I forgot I have to go to the grocery I actually forgot my kids in school and one by one day to go away and Jesus looked at the woman no disarray gets powerful he's a woman whereas I accusers how is he look there was nobody and Jesus no against the law 7 days would require her to be stoned said neither do I he's speaking neither can I who come from God condemned me he continues a higher you may be seated - when the doctor says tonight there is no hope your kids is terminal we don't know what to do for you we don't know how to work the situation out we never saw this situation before that's the law of the 17 speakers there is a higher law from the easy thing that can heal any sickness not to perform any surgery when the family things that you can never change and they don't understand you there is a higher law let people think you're gonna give up when your marriage he's like it's about to collapse there's a higher law when you can't pay your bills there's a higher law you may be seated Jesus was not only interested in their spiritual needs but when he needed money to pay packages he go fish they got Buddha when they cut the fish there was money to pay the bill because he was interested in their deity living and their life because they want a destination when he would need nothing you didn't hear what I said he was on a definition onto it and when he was need nothing but he was getting used to them getting provided for all of you means not what they wanted but for all of their needs that's what God does he wants to beat every need and it doesn't mean in your heart tonight he is able to meet whatever that means if you need healing he's able to meet that fear you need a holding off he's able to meet that end you need to be restored he's able to meet that need you are back light again tonight he is able to bring you back and the church came Oh hallelujah friends we are coming to the end of time now in the message you may be seated future home of the heavenly bridegroom I do think bright but there are not many visions 110 and we read it it's called not a dispensation not a 70 it's called the fullness of time and when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulfilled when there's no more time then you go into eternity after the seven church age is over and by the man's head and it is Luther's age is over Methodist age is over Pentecostal ages over now you go into what eternity no more sevens no more trees no more other there in eternity where there's no such thing that numbers and times and things all my you see it now so that's my hope friends and that's the same thing when the balance says he does when he gives you the Holy Ghost baptism with higher he can come and dwell with you and we can sit and have any places in Christ Jesus because we are already in him not we will be we are now sitting in Christ Jesus how do we get into it by one Holy Ghost baptism by one spirit we all baptized into Christ and that's not a proper message question answers before there was a word I love this good you were in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost that settles everyday people every day before there was the world you were in God's thought let's give you the Holy Ghost because he knew you'd be wanting it and he shows you himself because you desired he shows you in Christ before you or Jesus any of you was on the earth and he sent Jesus listen listen to the purpose to die to prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost to bring you so the holy go have to bring you himself cavitus came at all he said this is a church so I'm at home now sees or that is so rich to me to think it's not what I wanted it wasn't my desire it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing I have not one thing to do with it but before the world ever started God for us and put our name on the lamb book of life before they ever was a world talk about God so friends the purpose of the endtime message the war purpose was to lose the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost must burn in the river you think it's almost 2000 years but praise the Son of Man be Lynn the prophet lose the Holy Ghost lose your inheritance lose your promise but God didn't want the Holy Ghost to fall on your flesh from your ideas on your emotions on your pride because we just be Pentecostal so for all these years the Holy Ghost was these guys as the word and service after service the responsibility of ministers was to make sure that the full word representing the mechanics was in you that's why the public is in a secret is the word is in the bride not the word is in the message ditches but the word is in the brain so how do you know who the bride is she can see the full word giggity correction you can take repute we could take encouragement but I think the night the bridal hell the word feed long enough this is this a time for the rushing my QE and so in these videos to claim their inheritance you made me feel it for a minute I'm not going to be too much longer with you if I want to strike something know there are times when it's got to be a group there are times you need to be a group and individual couldn't a caracal it took the whole army to go th Jericho are you with me there is a season to be identified and be a group I want to read a couple coats that are makers but the balance said in what was a holy was given for the same Holy Spirit that sees the Lutheran's that sanctify the Methodist that baptized the Pentecostal is now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus and then why am i against organized religion but the relative the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word notice is all still group dependent one live here we are the end time coming from the east or west or north or south what are we doing getting ready for that rapture getting ready rolling ourselves steady for few minutes till every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost but by 1965 in the message of paradox but appearances and so has the church world in this lastly it's come along it's pretty spot but it's coming a time where's mercy it's must do it you have got to come and II visions also of this journey yet as there was of other journeys they has come you have to come and Ephesians and episodes and Ephesians of this journey now for the brand important that Ephesians parallels just work so when we read Ephesians rereading Joshua when you read us what we read in Ephesians not only that listen carefully but the book of Ephesians is the book of trust one of the New Testament it's dividing and setting in order people become one so in this day and this is God is not placing any Church any group it's individuals who would possess their individual in Harrison everybody with me now let me skip here we know this but here try something but the Branham says he had a gumption how book senators with their labor pains and stuff like that but I want to come to a point here hallelujah quite a bit here designing of the inheritance so it was after forty years in the wilderness remember to turn him is over in the Willis for 40 years and the Babbitt better for five years before together so after it's so cool over for forty years there was five years where it went Jericho a I took this place they did this place and five years now just what city in verse one I'm not worried too much longer there's no trust was all and stricken in years and the Lord said unto him though on all and sibelius know when cause does that to you the Bible is something else now Georgia was always getting and the loss that I am throw at all and sickening is what a word rest of the Lord and then I'm very minute yes very much land to be present so even though trust with all and is very an entire and God is speaking to him without even seeing it enough in a way that we might think we have to say to make you feel not bad if you all you shouldn't use for your land to be taken this is the land that yet remain it all the borders of the Palestine and all the story from C Hall which is before Egypt even under the borders of Ephraim northward which is coated in a Gilliland my love of the Philistine the Gaza type and the after type and the s permanent the p-type and the April night also the a life and God is not done plus will you hold you're picking a name but I want you to remember yes still more than an inheritance ahead are you may be seated and it goes on from the salt all the land of the canaanites not some of the land of the Canaanites but all the land of the enemy and Mara that is beside of Midianite also affected of borders of the other right and I'm not done yet and the land of the give lights and all Lebanon - what a Sun rising so when you see the horizon Joshua even so you all on a Sat land is your land community from loud-ass unnumbered German on to the entering of hammers all inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unsymmetrical name and all opinion then will I Drive out before the turn of Israel and sit is the instruction only divides out by lot on to the Israelites one inheritance as I have commanded me could you think someone you may be seated if you could take the morning we can go on and on long you may be see that everybody knows the normal along with you but this word is even good right now so that's just what that means so just what sample for teen the dividing of the inheritance begins and this away was a go to church tribe by tribe they are coming to claim their inheritance this is what I've been waiting for this is what is what about when you we need under the whip of the taskmaster can you that there's a profitable land somewhere when you walk on the Egypt is what is Sanders holds about when Miriam play the tambourine you may reveal it has not been easy because when they walked out of Egypt and they thought it would be in the land underneath 40 years distant that should have been maybe a month 40 years this circle and dial or one by one except for Joshua and here it has not been easy but that generation that has been born in the wilderness all the I heard about was this promise man while in the woman is the promised land is the head when they were marching around jericho departmental anderson in the battle of the eye of summit land is ahead and after forty and five years is being divided no the tribe of Reuben comes forward and I can see Joshua these old you repeated he's stricken in age but you seen that's your land and the whole tribe of Reuben they rejoice because it's been a long journey but I go King what it is women and the tribe of Reuben they have their panels they help you have eyes and I see we have all and then from the tribe of Simeon then the tribe of Levi and one by one Levi didn't get a land and hurt them because they're the Levites and then and they come to type of Judah warrior tribe wrong warrior the Royal tries to try committed kings of Israel came from keep everything for a minute are you with me tonight I was a depicted a young strong confident men of Judah and their wives and their children as they feel the strength he may be seated not only with a tribal should have been known for his king but this thrive had one unique distinction from every other tribe there was one man among them that was just different and I can imagine that the tribe of Judah is waiting to get their portion there's a stillness in the camp and it's a shuffle that's going on and it's a lone man he's walking walking in front and you can see the smiles of the soldiers at the watch in respect at this man walk to the front of the tribe of Judah and he interrupts the proceedings he is the rubs what had been handed tribe I tried he interrupts would be inhabited a group and his death listen yeah just one come on but those of you who don't know my name is Kira I was dead when we met when we went into the land I was next I'm the only one panic occasionally don't breathe so good I supported by the end I can't get them out of my head that was put the honey was good Moses promise me now therefore give me my Mountain [Applause] you may repeat it for a minute [Applause] no mrs. Hill empathy be I'm not speaking for the tribe of Judah I'm speaking for myself this was a promise multi-tier to me and the church somewhere if you're gonna celebrate you may repeat it for a minute Caleb had a revelation now know the challenge in the message a lot of people don't know the Bible so because they don't on a Bible because the Prophet was the shine light on the written word so they're people who take the prophets message and don't even read the scripture but you know how the Bible describes Elam the method called Caleb Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Canaanite we're in the Caleb of the tribe of Judah and hold somewhere so some theologians argue is that's Philip there are two possibilities on the one hand they argue he could be a Gentile or the best-case scenario he could be a cousin because in Genesis 1519 the Covenant that God made with Abraham includes the land of the Canaanites so in Genesis 15:18 of evident in the theme there the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying on that I feel have I given this land on the river of Egypt unto the great river the river Euphrates the tonight and the Canaanites and the cabinet and the hittite and the perizzite so he never is of the kiloton so Caleb was not a Judah by natural birth somewhere along the journey Caleb join the rugs not only join the ranks but I wasn't understanding he was one of the twelve that went into the Promised Land so not only turn around but he was such a soldier and he rules to the top of the ranks to represent a tribe of Judah how does a man who is that born of the tribe represent attract under the laws of the tribes of Israel you have to be adopted into the track correctly then to try to admit that Caleb had to have a character worried that the tribe of Judah count him worthy to represent aside when he was born of the tribe so when they never looked at me and say you don't look like Judah you don't look like a Christian but I can go on now you just wake me up and put me into the tribe of the family of God because I wasn't worthy to begin with but if you can make it I can make it to somebody give God a total frame do everything for a minute is this tango a little more yes how much I'm driving home on the individual part of the sea it moved from the tribal the group the easel is in this church it with this group it witness to other people and scared of us I don't want to hear that tell me where my motor Ruben give me on to nodosa here the time afterwards tell me my mountain that Moses promised me and there's a lot of lessons we could take from this man korcula that we don't know much about but we know he made it can I just read from the Bible just for 14 verse 6 then the children of Judah came unto Joshua and gilga and kill as the son of Jeff another killer night setting him told no answer thing this is not an extreme shoe you don't know it's a thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and V imperious vanilla what he is always iron Moses the servant of the Lord can leave from Kadesh Barnea to inspire the land and I brought him word as it was in my heart nevertheless and I love listen I love this ho here let could speak after 45 years because listen ENS shorter should have had his Mountain 45 years ago it was because of his rhetoric he had to be out of his mountain for 45 years listen to how classy you may be given what a gentleman a man of distinction he said nevertheless my present that went up with me may the heart of the people melt there is no you are not hearing any animosity in here last week he had let that go a long time ago he said you were there here is my name and my good brother may the people heart melt to lambda1 is a hard land for them to not be desperate for the Holy Ghost Tony Moore can avoid each and the people that care you want the better but we are here again another holy time of comes and we are planning on the best of the greatest management piece of omnipotence that the world has ever seen now therefore give me my mouth [Applause] [Music] [Applause] - so Caleb didn't see my brothers I could have cut them off and not tell us about them and don't no no no no no no no my brethren that went up with me hello brothers fellow ministers I would need to come back because 10 brothers came back together they came up quickly to give the negative report but that's where you are you know you are nice be attractive jeez we came by late at night our stomachs were full the place were too good you may be seated but I always follow the Lord my growth and motives way on that means being surely the land whereon thy faith hath trodden shall be thine inheritance and I transportable because now has wholly follow the Lord my God now friend you may be seated young people here I was the only man out of hundreds of thousands of people that held to the world of promise here I would have lost friends you'd have lost relatives you'd have lost the people to encourage him from your knees but that didn't see in the revelation he had in his heart I won't leave but all that I am with all and I have with everything within this I wholly follow the laws and God whisper because now has only follow

at the land of toys it's a land of grades it's a land of possibility to land of restoration is a land of of redemption and any man and this is a paradox that believes God and pick them at his word no matter what the situation is God will perform another paradox isn't it so what about our things we have a mountain to possess yes among them come see it all the way to charity that's touchy of a perfect man that that's our mountain people don't want to talk about that much anymore because the goal that mountain you have to pass brotherly kindness and that's the part of the mountain people when they read it but in the Memphis public praying by putting weakness but around said all God's strategies to take human vessels and shake the world with them like a tentacle that is the a Pentacles what did he do it taken them 10 days to get all emptied up but they were all standing there with their vessels to enough time God became someone fill them up it shook the world poured himself into them that's the need of today that's what we need today is empty vessels yes sir so God can fill them up God kind of use them as they're already filled up if you're full of theological training God can use you God got to have empty vessels so you can fill them in the mantle speaking of mountain the problem that I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into there now that's going to shake the whole world that the first time is built in the days of Jesus of Nazareth with a human being asked anything that you will and it shall be given unto you oh it's gonna come to pass put you

Sikh will be here by a word the blind will see the Deaf will hear the Dead will be raised up on the power of God will shape the world with the Church of the Living God we're in the process of it now be encouraged tonight friends you didn't call yourself God called you the Holy Spirit knows where you live where you work what time you leave in the morning what you have for breakfast you can I will

every apostle I've been have you received the Holy Ghost soon as you use it and if I have one desire in my heart for this meeting if the T individuals come into contact with the supernatural my prayer in this holy time is one smaller that in this video one can see the need to possess a individual in Harrison the baptism of the Holy Ghost to have that piece of eternal life drop out into the socket of your soul friends many people have lost the burden for the Holy Ghost they accept teaching as a substitute for the Holy Ghost they accept being a member of the church as a substitute for the horse
