[24:53] following and Jesus we ask it amen God
[24:56] bless you and welcome welcome to the
[24:59] house of God tonight
[25:01] and they have your bibles are likely to
[25:03] the two portion of scriptures Acts
[25:04] chapter 2 1 4 1 to 4 and we want to read
[25:09] from Acts chapter 4 verse 7 to 31 to 90
[25:12] but one reader tonight
[25:14] Acts chapter 2.
[25:17] I can't remember using these two
[25:20] scriptures like this but we see what the
[25:22] Lord will do
[25:23] um Acts chapter
[25:29] okay
[25:31] something
[25:39] okay and when the day of Pentecost is
[25:41] fully come
[25:42] they were all with one Accord in one
[25:44] place and suddenly there came a song
[25:47] from heaven
[25:48] after the Russian Mighty Wind it fill
[25:51] all the house where they would sit in
[25:53] and they appeared unto them cloven
[25:54] tongues like as a fire
[25:56] it sat upon each of them
[25:58] and they were all they were all filled
[26:01] with the Holy Ghost
[26:03] and began to speak with other tongues
[26:05] as the spirit give them utterance
[26:09] and from Acts chapter 4
[26:12] and this is after the lame man the
[26:15] crippleman was healed and everybody knew
[26:17] it was crippled they know it was a part
[26:18] of God and Acts chapter 4 verse 7 they
[26:20] say and and when they had set them in
[26:23] the midst they asked by what power or by
[26:26] what name have you done this
[26:29] then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost
[26:33] said unto them
[26:35] he rulers of people now now this here
[26:38] give an emphasis of the feeling of the
[26:41] Holy Ghost not just Peter talking and
[26:44] Peter feeding talkish and if he'll just
[26:46] say something this is Peter this is
[26:48] emphasis filled with the Holy Ghost said
[26:51] unto them ye rulers of the people and
[26:54] Elders of Israel if we this day be
[26:58] examined of the good deed done to the
[27:01] important Man by what means he's made
[27:03] whole be it known unto all unto you all
[27:07] unto all the people of Israel that by
[27:10] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[27:12] whom he crucified whom God has raised
[27:16] from the dead even by him that this man
[27:19] standing here before you whole this is
[27:23] the stone which was set at not of you
[27:25] build it which has become the head of
[27:27] the corner neither is there any
[27:29] salvation and any other for there is
[27:31] none other name under him give him among
[27:34] men whereby we must be saved and when
[27:37] they saw the boldness of Peter and John
[27:40] and perceived that they were unlearned
[27:43] and ignorant men they marveled they took
[27:47] knowledge of them that they have been
[27:49] with Jesus and beholding the man which
[27:52] was healed standing with them they could
[27:55] say nothing against it but when they had
[27:57] commanded them to go aside out of the
[28:00] council they conferred among themselves
[28:02] saying what shall we do to these men for
[28:05] indeed a neutral Miracle had been done
[28:07] by them is Manifest to all them that
[28:09] dwell in Jerusalem and be kind of denied
[28:11] but that it spread no further among the
[28:14] people let us straightly threaten them
[28:16] that they speak henceforth to no man in
[28:19] this name and they call them commanded
[28:22] them not to speak at all or teach in the
[28:25] name of Jesus but Peter and John
[28:28] answered and said unto them whether it
[28:30] be right and the sight of God to hearken
[28:33] unto you more than under God jaji for we
[28:37] cannot but speak the things which we
[28:40] have seen and heard so when they are
[28:42] further attracting them they let them go
[28:44] finding nothing how they might punish
[28:47] them because of the people for all men
[28:50] Glory fight God for that which was done
[28:53] for the man was above 40 years old on
[28:56] whom this miracle of healing was showed
[28:58] and being let go they went to their own
[29:01] company and reported all that the chief
[29:04] priests and the elders said unto them
[29:06] and when they had heard that they lifted
[29:08] up their voice to God with one Accord
[29:10] and said Lord Thou Art God which has
[29:14] made Heaven hurt and the Sea and all
[29:16] that is in them is who by the mouth of
[29:18] thy servant David have said why did
[29:21] hidden reach and the people imagine a
[29:23] vain thing the kings of the earth stood
[29:25] up and the rulers were gathered together
[29:27] against the Lord and against the Christ
[29:28] for our truth against thy holy Child
[29:31] Jesus whom thou has anointed both Herod
[29:34] Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the
[29:37] people of Israel were gathered together
[29:38] for to do whatsoever thy hand that I
[29:41] counsel determine before to be done and
[29:44] no Lord behold the threatenants and
[29:46] Grant unto thy servants that with all
[29:48] boldness they may speak Thy Word by
[29:51] stretching 14 hand to heal and that
[29:54] signs and wonders may be done by the
[29:56] name of thy holy Child Jesus and when
[29:58] they had prayed the place was shaken
[30:01] where they will assemble together and
[30:04] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[30:06] and they speak the word of God with
[30:08] boldness father we thank you for your
[30:10] word tonight and Lord these are just
[30:12] ridden it is inspiring father and this

[37:03] is that right the Rapture the Jews had
[37:05] gone on then come down and the Judgment
[37:07] was set and the books are open is that
[37:09] right and another book was opened which
[37:12] was The Book of Life the Sanctified
[37:14] believer
[37:16] that that that hadn't received the Holy
[37:20] Ghost
[37:24] let me read it again
[37:26] books are open
[37:28] and another book was open
[37:30] The Book of Life
[37:31] and the prophet is interpreting that
[37:33] book
[37:36] that book is not unbelievers
[37:38] that book is the Sanctified believer I
[37:42] said go to get it in this message
[37:47] that haven't received the Holy Ghost
[37:49] didn't Jesus teach that ten virgins went
[37:52] out to meet the bridegroom and all of
[37:54] them were virgins pure holy they went to
[37:57] sleep and didn't get the Holy Ghost and
[37:59] these got the Holy Ghost had all in

[51:06] bring with him without the seed of God
[51:09] and if you have any question what the
[51:11] seed of God is he said it here which is
[51:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:15] confessional church is a mark of the
[51:17] beast that's not saying the Lord so the
[51:20] seed of God is the
[51:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said come
[51:23] on from among it my people be separated
[51:26] oh he said oh why Why Can't This Brown
[51:29] Tabernacle come out of our wrinkle
[51:33] I want to know a few people around here
[51:35] believe this gospel
[51:36] it's been preached you have seen it
[51:39] signs and wonders confirmed everything
[51:41] the Lord has spoke has come to pass then
[51:43] what's the matter wrong here when I hear
[51:45] these contentions among you when I hear
[51:47] their strife
[51:49] I want to see why this church can be
[51:52] carried away in the power of God and the
[51:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost with signs and
[51:56] wonders what's the matter your pastor
[51:59] believe it you believe it so what's
[52:00] wrong here there is something wrong this
[52:02] should be a lighthouse of the world
[52:04] there should be a place where the powers
[52:06] of God and weeping and crying and
[52:09] seeking God ought to be going on day and
[52:11] night why can't we have it
[52:14] this was the prophet from before his own
[52:16] church so we we must have a less burden
[52:19] Oh Glory to God we must want the power
[52:21] of God crying sign weeping right here in
[52:24] this Tabernacle not people coming and
[52:26] saying I'm with a book to take notes
[52:28] taking notes at home come here to
[52:30] worship come and take it in the spirit
[52:31] come in the Creator atmosphere when they
[52:33] were praying they said Lord hear their
[52:35] threatenings hear what they're trying to
[52:36] do us all they're trying to do is
[52:38] another and why they were praying the

[53:08] praise God
[53:09] hello Branham Michigan
[53:12] he's a believer
[53:14] all the Jews have to be circumcised
[53:16] so you could say how about you yes but
[53:20] Moses said
[53:21] take a lamb kill it
[53:23] and put it blood
[53:26] there's many man fundamental man that
[53:28] can take this Bible and say I'm a
[53:30] Believer on Jesus said by faith we are
[53:32] saved and I'm a Believer but the baptism
[53:34] of the Holy Ghost is nonsense
[53:38] then the Talk's not applied
[53:40] a circumcised Jews said I'm a Jew why do
[53:43] I have to go there and act like that
[53:45] other bunch of fanatics
[53:48] Moses standing up and down the street
[53:50] saying the evening message is here
[53:53] shall come to pass at the end of 14 days
[53:55] You Shall Gather the congregation
[53:56] together kill the lamb whole
[53:58] Congregation of Israel shall kill it put
[54:00] their hands upon it identify himself
[54:02] with it and the blood shall be struck
[54:03] upon the post seven Thunders
[54:06] Exclusive by promise ministers don't
[54:09] want to preach it
[54:10] but he had to put your hand on it
[54:12] to be identified with it because seven
[54:14] tunnels get Faith seven times gathered
[54:16] up right together seven others should
[54:18] have about how to repair Oh Glory
[54:19] they've got seven times a bright revive

[54:44] version 10 Mighty Angel come down with a
[54:47] book open which is a Redemptive rights

[55:43] those people
[55:44] those seeds that they sow in there all
[55:46] them countries not in their soul started
[55:49] going down hill so the lack of this
[55:51] elect of the soul of the Believers that
[55:53] going in church members not not the
[55:55] elect the lock is covered
[55:58] that kind of atmosphere but one of these

[1:00:53] Peter was firebombed it wasn't the same
[1:00:55] Peter that they know I know he's a
[1:00:57] Casper fisherman I know in a long time
[1:00:58] that wasn't that you know he was a

[1:01:16] God to reveal a son of Me Oh Glory to
[1:01:19] God if any man take himself to be

[1:04:54] Rapture the same Holy Ghost you can't do
[1:04:56] like me man you know yeah you want to
[1:04:59] know could I get some better Waters than
[1:05:00] this
[1:05:04] seven times there he said this one here
[1:05:06] nice we had a dip
[1:05:08] that is a muddy Jordan River that we had
[1:05:10] a dip I don't know what you see me I
[1:05:13] still had it up there it's up to you if
[1:05:15] you want to be healed it's up to you you
[1:05:16] want to be filled it's up to you if you
[1:05:18] want to be delivered but you have to go
[1:05:19] down there oh God help us tonight glory
[1:05:23] to God listen to this that was the theme
[1:05:26] of every Apostle have you received the
[1:05:28] Holy Ghost since you believe if the
[1:05:30] token was not displayed then the
[1:05:32] Covenant was not in effect
[1:05:33] see it must be because it's you saying
[1:05:36] you believe but you don't follow the
[1:05:39] instructions of the word when you then
[1:05:42] you don't believe
[1:05:43] so if you say a belief and then the
[1:05:45] instructions coming you don't follow
[1:05:46] instructions
[1:05:47] what you really want is a religion
[1:05:51] to comfort your heart and mind but you
[1:05:53] don't want to yield to the order and
[1:05:56] instructions of the word because when
[1:05:58] you yield adapt it shows that you're
[1:06:00] bringing yourself in obedience because
[1:06:02] the key that God had to deal with Joshua
[1:06:05] and all his sons to bring them in the
[1:06:07] spirit of obedience and Jesus we learned
[1:06:12] obedience by
[1:06:14] the things he suffered
[1:06:16] amen so you are some suffering to go
[1:06:17] through if you're still stubborn and
[1:06:19] rebellious
[1:06:20] you still have some Thunder take
[1:06:22] because you have to learn this thing
[1:06:24] yeah born obedient we have to learn it
[1:06:27] oh let's go let's go let's go you cannot
[1:06:30] put the blood on the Lincoln of the door
[1:06:32] where the token could not be unless the
[1:06:34] lamb died
[1:06:36] and the blood was a positive sign that
[1:06:38] landed
[1:06:46] positive
[1:06:47] then he dropped this bomb here and the
[1:06:50] Holy Ghost
[1:06:51] is a positive token
[1:06:54] that your lamb died
[1:06:56] and you receive the token upon yourself
[1:06:58] for his very life is in you
[1:07:01] there is no make-belief there is no put
[1:07:04] on there is no impersonation it is there
[1:07:08] you know it
[1:07:10] the world knows it
[1:07:12] the token is there
[1:07:17] so you got you can come and tell me
[1:07:19] about you I see talking in your voice
[1:07:22] here I adopted and you know I'm here
[1:07:26] I ain't seen nothing
[1:07:28] you're seeing more than me
[1:07:31] and um you know and you're getting this
[1:07:34] Revelation and
[1:07:36] this year this is take it easy
[1:07:42] yeah
[1:07:45] all right let's go now you say no matter
[1:07:47] you might have preached the gospel so
[1:07:48] but Obama is drilling don't know listen
[1:07:50] this is this is serious now you might
[1:07:52] have preach the gospel you might have
[1:07:54] cast out devils when I spoke with
[1:07:56] tongues you might have shouted dance in
[1:07:58] the spirit but without the talking
[1:08:02] you say can I do it but I'm asking a
[1:08:04] question
[1:08:05] Paul said so a watch how he goes back to
[1:08:08] the scriptures Paul said do I speak with
[1:08:11] tongues of men and angels do I give my
[1:08:12] body to be to feed the poor my body to
[1:08:14] be burned and sacrifice I have faith to
[1:08:16] move mountains and these things I am
[1:08:18] nothing yet
[1:08:19] he said don't rely upon that
[1:08:23] it is the token no matter how much you
[1:08:25] have done how good you are when the
[1:08:27] wrath of God flashes it only recognize
[1:08:30] the token
[1:08:32] that is why these guys that told the
[1:08:34] Lord have we done this in your name and
[1:08:37] that's in your name as well as I
[1:08:38] preached they felt they were entitled
[1:08:40] because they've done these things
[1:08:44] and they were deceived because they
[1:08:47] missed was requirement
[1:08:48] and looking to go in on entitlement with
[1:08:51] Lord I present 40 years is 40 years you
[1:08:53] know
[1:08:55] foreign
[1:09:03] that is nothing

[1:09:37] that I want to trade that gospel I have
[1:09:40] one intellectual gospel I want the same
[1:09:42] original gospel the Lord himself went
[1:09:45] everywhere with them confirming the word
[1:09:47] praise God some man put in some books
[1:09:49] and tears behind them handing out this
[1:09:51] and handling all that that is not what
[1:09:52] the Bible had inside of that there's the
[1:09:54] original gospel that Jesus commissioned
[1:09:56] his disciples go into all the world and

[1:15:59] he did first he had a people that he had
[1:16:01] made a land for them
[1:16:06] a preparation for it for the promised
[1:16:09] land people it was only for those who
[1:16:11] was predestinated to the promised land
[1:16:14] bride of that day isn't that right how
[1:16:16] he done it he sent a prophet with a
[1:16:18] message
[1:16:18] identified by the pillar of fire and
[1:16:21] gave a token that they could rest assure
[1:16:23] it was right
[1:16:24] it was a consolation and then he would
[1:16:27] go along with the scriptures First
[1:16:28] Corinthians 12 by one spirit
[1:16:30] we are all
[1:16:33] Eternal Chinese Holy Ghost Japanese Holy

[1:16:45] look at that fellowship if the car
[1:16:47] Fellowship we know it's not the same
[1:16:49] spirit is a different kind of spirit
[1:16:51] message Spirit during that Spirit
[1:16:53] different kind but not the same Spirit
[1:16:55] one Spirit you're baptized into one body
[1:16:58] just as God take you and dip in water we

[1:23:09] if we don't come to the Token I will say
[1:23:12] we spin it up in mud

[1:24:08] my joy he's my love he's my life that's
[1:24:11] a covenant a token upon the door oh my
[1:24:15] but the Bible says the thing that made
[1:24:18] you dear when you come to the Lord
[1:24:19] that's the whole route of evil is still
[1:24:21] there notice when you repent and baptize
[1:24:23] the name of Jesus Christ he forgives you
[1:24:25] of your sins then secondly come
[1:24:26] sanctification which sets your mind in
[1:24:28] order for Holiness to think right some
[1:24:30] vacation is a compound Greek word which
[1:24:32] means clean set aside for service then
[1:24:35] next come the baptism of fire and the
[1:24:38] holy ghost that God might dwell in us
[1:24:41] and the fire of God here we go cleanses
[1:24:44] our hearts from sin and puts the Holy
[1:24:48] Ghost Inside then we bring forth the
[1:24:50] same life that he did because it is us
[1:24:53] now in a natural birth when a woman
[1:24:55] gives a bit to a baby Natural Life types
[1:24:57] of spiritual ability the first thing
[1:24:59] happened is the breaking of water then
[1:25:01] blood then the spirit life grabs the
[1:25:03] little fellow water blood spirit now
[1:25:06] when a baby is born in the kingdom of
[1:25:08] God he comes the same way water blood
[1:25:10] spirit no it's on vacation second stage
[1:25:13] cleanses the mind
[1:25:15] is the heart the mind of the heart in
[1:25:18] order of Holiness a man can repent of
[1:25:20] his sins a moral man every moral looking
[1:25:22] woman he finds it's still dear maybe
[1:25:24] he's a drunkard every time he smells the
[1:25:26] drink it is still a tear but when he
[1:25:28] gets Sanctified that cleanses that
[1:25:30] desire out of him see it takes the want
[1:25:33] of it away he can still be tempted but
[1:25:35] it takes the want of it away still he's
[1:25:38] not right yet then he is baptized by the
[1:25:41] Holy Ghost on Fire cleansed burnt out
[1:25:43] cleaned up and then put into service of
[1:25:46] God salification only sets them aside
[1:25:49] for service isn't that right we are the
[1:25:52] end time three stages baptism cleanses
[1:25:54] the heart with the Holy Ghost now he's
[1:25:57] called the churches of justification
[1:25:59] call it Tucson vacation then fill it
[1:26:01] with rules on fire then he took it to a
[1:26:03] process that he himself the Holy Spirit
[1:26:06] himself the Son of God could dwell in
[1:26:08] the human heart it has to go through
[1:26:11] that before he can come in
[1:26:14] stay right with he said then the church
[1:26:17] that professed to be a Christian Church
[1:26:18] will have to have the same spirit that
[1:26:21] was in Jesus Christ
[1:26:23] for at the resurrection of the church
[1:26:25] Christ and his bride will Dove till
[1:26:27] freeze God isn't that right he said it
[1:26:30] ought to be striking it ought to make a
[1:26:32] church member come to Christ and stay
[1:26:34] until he's filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:36] it's the only promise of the rapture it
[1:26:39] is the only promise of the Rapture the
[1:26:43] only way the church and Christ can come
[1:26:45] together the very Spirit oh my
