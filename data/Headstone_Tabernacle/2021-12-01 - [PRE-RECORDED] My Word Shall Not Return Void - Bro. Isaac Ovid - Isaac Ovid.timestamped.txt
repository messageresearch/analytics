[19:38] [Music]
[19:44] are you happy to be in the house of the
[19:45] lord this morning
[19:46] [Music]
[19:47] so i'd like to invite your attention to
[19:49] the wood
[19:50] if you would turn with me thank you
[19:52] musicians thank you brother anthony to
[19:54] three portions of scripture
[19:57] reading isaiah 55
[19:59] reading malachi 3 and reading hebrews 13
[20:04] for scripture readings this morning
[20:15] isaiah 55 a familiar passage of
[20:17] scripture seek ye the lord
[20:20] while he may be found calling upon him
[20:22] while he is near
[20:25] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[20:27] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[20:29] return unto the lord and he will have
[20:31] mercy
[20:32] upon him and to our god
[20:34] for he will abundantly pardon
[20:37] for my thoughts and not your thoughts
[20:40] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[20:42] lord for as the heavens are higher than
[20:44] the earth so are my ways higher than
[20:46] your ways and my thoughts and your
[20:48] thoughts
[20:49] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[20:51] from heaven and returneth not feather
[20:53] but water it the earth and make it bring
[20:56] forth and bud that it may give sea to
[20:58] the sower and bread to the eater so
[21:01] shall my word be that goeth fought out
[21:03] of my mouth it shall not return unto me
[21:06] void but it shall accomplish that which
[21:09] i please and it shall prosper in the
[21:11] thing where to i sent it reading malachi
[21:14] 3 and verse 6
[21:16] for i am the lord and i change not
[21:20] and read in hebrews 13 8
[21:22] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[21:25] today and forever may the lord add a
[21:28] blessing to the reading of his word you
[21:30] may be seated this morning i have a
[21:33] title this morning my word shall not
[21:36] return void
[21:38] my word shall not return void
[21:42] hallelujah and that word void means
[21:44] empty so the word cannot return empty
[21:47] the word cannot return with a result
[21:49] once the word is spoken something must
[21:52] come out of it even if you don't
[21:54] understand what comes out of it
[21:55] something always comes out of it my word
[21:59] cannot return void but it shall
[22:01] accomplish that thing which i please so
[22:04] there are things that would please god
[22:06] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[22:08] to i sent it so once god speaks whatever
[22:11] he says it has got to prosper it has got
[22:14] to come to pass and god through diverse
[22:16] prophets and times and dispensations and
[22:19] epochs and heroes have sent prophets and
[22:21] messengers and preachers because the
[22:24] mouthpiece of god are his prophets so
[22:26] when god speaks through his prophets a
[22:29] true prophet cannot lie a true prophet
[22:31] cannot inject his own ideas a true
[22:34] prophet cannot put his own perspective
[22:36] on things a true prophet is commissioned
[22:39] to say what god put on his heart to say
[22:41] and to use his mouth as an instrument
[22:44] and that is what makes it a true prophet
[22:46] and when that true prophet speaks and it
[22:49] comes to pass then you know it's a true
[22:51] prophet and if you read scripture you
[22:53] cannot find a prophecy that came from a
[22:55] true prophet that did not come to pass
[22:58] it could happen in a month it could
[22:59] happen in a year it could happen in five
[23:01] years or it could be 400 years that's a
[23:04] prophecy that came from isaiah that a
[23:06] virgin should conceive and be a child it
[23:09] was not an immediate manifestation of
[23:11] the prophecy but the prophecy had to
[23:13] come to pass because a prophet spoke it
[23:16] and once a prophet speaks it it has got
[23:18] to come to pass oh come on somebody say
[23:21] amen
[23:22] [Music]
[23:23] and even when a prophet comes off the
[23:25] scene even though another prophet is
[23:27] there and another prophet may be there
[23:29] if there's anything that's hanging over
[23:31] the fulfillment of it could still happen
[23:34] it must still happen in fact so when
[23:36] peter walked out of the upper room he
[23:39] didn't refer back to the malachi he
[23:42] didn't refer back to zeddika he went
[23:44] straight back to joel and said this is
[23:46] what joel was talking about it couldn't
[23:49] happen in his day other prophets came
[23:51] after joel but this prophecy that joel
[23:54] made it apply to us can the church say
[23:57] amen so god because he operates in
[24:00] eternity and is not limited by time the
[24:03] way we see things is not the way god
[24:05] sees things and before god got down to
[24:08] giving the word about my word shall not
[24:10] return void he preface it or laid a
[24:13] foundation about the difference between
[24:15] our thoughts and his thoughts he said my
[24:17] thoughts are higher than your thoughts
[24:19] so what i'm about to tell you is because
[24:21] my thoughts are higher than your
[24:23] thoughts and my ways are higher than my
[24:25] ways so even if you don't understand
[24:27] them my words still shall not return
[24:30] void it is not based on your thinking
[24:33] it's not based on your understanding
[24:35] it's done based on your experiences it's
[24:38] done based on your emotion it's the
[24:40] peace and how you feel it's not based on
[24:43] what happened to you if not based on
[24:45] what happened this morning it's not
[24:47] based on what the doctor said it's not
[24:49] based on what sin you did it's not based
[24:52] on who your father was it's the peace
[24:54] and who your mother was it's some place
[24:56] in how long you're in church it's based
[24:58] on the one factor that if god spoken
[25:01] it's got to come to pass
[25:04] [Applause]
[25:05] it's very simple this gospel is not a
[25:08] complicated gospel once god speaks it
[25:11] it's got to come to pass
[25:13] somebody preached back to me
[25:15] oh hallelujah
[25:18] you may be seated for a minute i go back
[25:20] to when the prophet preached for the
[25:22] blind man he prayed for the blind man
[25:24] and he prayed for the blind man but the
[25:26] man had no feet so the man came back to
[25:28] the prayer line he came back to be
[25:30] prayed for and by the problem said i
[25:32] don't have to pray for you again i want
[25:34] you to get that this morning he said i
[25:36] don't need to pray for you again i
[25:38] already prayed for you and when i pray
[25:40] for you it already activated something
[25:43] in heaven the praying is not the problem
[25:45] your faith is the problem so he said go
[25:48] back to work go back to what you do and
[25:50] begin to say by stripes i'm healed
[25:52] because you're already healed i can't
[25:54] take it back you don't need to hear it
[25:56] again it's already the truth the world
[25:59] has already gone forth your healing has
[26:01] been declared your deliverance has been
[26:03] declared your breakthrough has been
[26:05] declared when god said receive you the
[26:08] holy ghost he was not just speaking to
[26:10] peter
[26:12] he was not just speaking to john he was
[26:14] not just speaking to paul but he was
[26:16] speaking to you jesus himself said
[26:19] receive you the holy ghost and when that
[26:22] word left his mouth that word waited
[26:25] until you came along and waited until
[26:27] paul was there and waited until oh come
[26:30] on somebody preached back to me
[26:31] [Applause]
[26:35] don't try to lock my god in any day and
[26:38] time you can't lock him in there you
[26:41] can't lock him in time he's an eternal
[26:43] god he doesn't understand our
[26:45] limitations his thoughts are higher than
[26:48] our talks up his ways are higher than
[26:50] always oh somebody preached back to me
[26:53] this morning
[26:54] [Applause]
[26:57] hallelujah
[26:59] hallelujah
[27:01] no wonder but the brandon said we ought
[27:03] to be reckless
[27:04] and fearless in faith
[27:06] meaning you have to have a kind of
[27:07] attitude that you don't really care
[27:09] anymore because your faith is what's
[27:11] propelling you it don't have to make
[27:13] sense to you it's not supposed to make
[27:15] sense everything cannot make sense as
[27:18] brother terrance say god loves to do
[27:20] foolishness the match don't have to add
[27:22] up when jesus came the match didn't add
[27:25] up five loaves two fish feed five
[27:27] thousand remainder twelve baskets the
[27:30] match does not have to add up we have to
[27:33] take god at his word
[27:36] stop trying to figure it out stop trying
[27:39] to look at your past and say i don't
[27:41] think you're gonna make it your past
[27:42] have nothing to do with where you are
[27:44] now and where you are going god is able
[27:47] to take anybody fill them with the holy
[27:50] ghost he could take your sadness and
[27:53] turn it into gladness and he does not
[27:55] need permission he does not need
[27:57] permission he can do it this morning and
[28:00] he is doing it this morning
[28:04] [Applause]
[28:05] [Music]
[28:07] you may be seated
[28:10] your healing
[28:11] is not based on merit of your
[28:12] understanding your healing is not based
[28:15] on the merit of your revelation your
[28:17] healing is based on one thing that's
[28:19] faith
[28:21] it's just one condition god requires to
[28:24] heal
[28:25] and that's faith so you could walk in
[28:27] this morning in all kind of condition
[28:30] that's why the prophet said prostitutes
[28:32] would come into the tabernacle but they
[28:34] had faith and they were delivered they
[28:37] didn't know the scriptures he didn't
[28:38] they weren't there for the long
[28:40] preaching but they had faith to see god
[28:43] in the reality
[28:44] of a present tense ministry and say yes
[28:47] that's me i have female condition i'm
[28:49] going back different i have arthritis
[28:51] going back different high sugar finish
[28:54] low sugar finish high blood pressure
[28:57] finish low blood pressure finish my
[28:59] child in trouble finish
[29:03] finish
[29:04] finish
[29:05] finish
[29:06] you've got to speak it declare it walk
[29:09] in it
[29:10] [Applause]
[29:12] may be seated
[29:15] so the man who the prophet prayed for to
[29:17] them but just keep saying by stripes i'm
[29:19] healed
[29:21] it was looking crazy brother alexis
[29:24] listen people could see that he was
[29:25] still not seeing but he's seen something
[29:28] that was contrary to what they were
[29:30] seeing he was saying something contrary
[29:32] to how he was feeling he was saying
[29:34] something contrary to what the doctor
[29:36] was saying but he did not care
[29:39] because something spoke to him just keep
[29:42] saying it just stay in faith worship god
[29:45] has nothing to do with your feelings
[29:47] nothing to do with your tiredness
[29:49] nothing to do with what happened
[29:51] [Applause]
[29:52] [Music]
[29:54] [Applause]
[29:55] [Music]
[29:55] [Applause]
[29:57] [Music]
[30:07] it has to become real to you
[30:09] this is the first thing you have for the
[30:11] week that's real
[30:13] when you come to church that's when it's
[30:14] real
[30:15] everything else is imaginary
[30:17] everything else is fake everything else
[30:20] is temporary
[30:21] everything else has nothing to do with
[30:22] the real picture
[30:24] everything else is deception everything
[30:26] else is lies because the devil is the
[30:28] father of lies technology is a lie
[30:31] system is a lie traffic is a lie what
[30:33] traffic you're talking about
[30:36] what are you talking about
[30:38] philip was caught up and there was an
[30:39] ethiopian eunuch and he needed to get
[30:41] from here to there what traffic you're
[30:43] talking about he didn't even need a
[30:45] camel he didn't need a horse one minute

[30:52] he in what dimension was he in what are
[30:54] you talking about somebody preached back

[30:59] hallelujah the doctors want to know what
[31:02] this thing is when this centurion come
[31:05] to jesus and say good master
[31:09] my servant is sick
[31:10] [Applause]
[31:12] my son was in trouble he didn't come to
[31:14] a family member he gave her a
[31:16] servant
[31:18] he said hold on i'm not worthy for you
[31:20] to come to my house
[31:24] i'm in trouble my house in trouble i
[31:25] wouldn't want to bring your your majesty
[31:27] into my house but i have fear this

[31:32] because i know when i tell one to god
[31:34] he's supposed to go when i tell one to
[31:36] come he's supposed to come

[31:55] family will be delivered
[31:58] [Applause]
[32:03] can the church say amen
[32:05] hallelujah
[32:06] and his faith was so real that when he
[32:09] was heading back to the house but at
[32:11] jason he didn't ask if he was healed he
[32:13] asked when
[32:15] what time
[32:16] because i checked the time
[32:18] i checked the time
[32:20] when the word was spoken i want to know
[32:22] how fast the signals work
[32:25] i want to know how fast the signals work
[32:28] can the church say man
[32:31] it must become real to you
[32:34] it must become life to you that you are
[32:36] creatures of eternity trapped in time
[32:40] what does your bills have to do with how
[32:41] you feel this morning
[32:45] you come the chair but the random piece
[32:46] of message why are we so tossed about
[32:48] your mortgage trust in you your bills
[32:51] toss in here the doctors report this is
[32:53] a lie is tossing you what are you
[32:54] talking about
[32:56] because the woman with the issue of
[32:58] blood she had went by doctors
[33:00] and they had tried to help her because
[33:02] they were taking her money
[33:06] it was only when her money was done
[33:08] and she was her walrus against the back
[33:11] or backwards against the wall however
[33:12] you want to put it and she will be in a
[33:14] rock and a hard place and she have no
[33:16] other options
[33:18] sometimes that's what god love you know
[33:19] when they have no other options some of
[33:21] us have too much options so we ain't get
[33:24] desperate enough yet oh somebody help me
[33:26] this morning
[33:28] so when it came to the spot that she ran
[33:30] out of options she started to look
[33:32] around where can i go
[33:34] what can i do what shall i do she said
[33:36] yeah somebody tell you hear about jesus
[33:38] who is jesus
[33:41] you hear about jesus
[33:43] you know about jesus
[33:45] it is said that when you get to jesus
[33:46] you could be healed it is said that if
[33:48] you i hear a blind man eye opener i
[33:51] believe
[33:52] she would have had to hear something
[33:56] to move her from her condition
[33:59] to try jesus
[34:01] [Applause]
[34:03] but when she got there
[34:06] she was the only one who would
[34:08] so jesus surrounded
[34:10] it's crowd
[34:11] it's all kind of people
[34:13] and like some of us she said they say
[34:15] you know what it's just too much
[34:17] it's too much more i better come back
[34:22] too much
[34:24] too much
[34:27] people just wait for what i want to know
[34:31] you ever wear mighty savannah
[34:33] a food place right
[34:36] they sell wings and different things
[34:37] yeah yeah you ever see line
[34:41] people willing to wait
[34:43] because they find the wings good
[34:46] without our worry wait wait two hours
[34:49] because they won that thing
[34:51] people want that thing so much they will
[34:52] wait two hours
[34:54] without our some people listen that
[34:56] people leave san fernando to come to
[34:58] porter spain to get that wings and line
[35:00] up for two hours the journey alone is
[35:01] five hours is the whole trip to enjoy
[35:03] this thing for 15 minutes
[35:08] so when this woman came down there and
[35:10] see jesus saw the crowd
[35:12] she tell herself i come too
[35:14] far to just drive back home
[35:18] and the bible said she started to press
[35:19] away
[35:20] and she told herself if i could just
[35:22] touch the hem of his garment
[35:25] now jesus never spoke to her this is
[35:27] what make this testimony so powerful
[35:29] jesus did not speak to her
[35:31] she didn't give her promise if you come
[35:32] and meet me i'll meet you there that was
[35:34] not the promise she told herself if i
[35:36] could just touch him of his government i
[35:38] will be made whole she made a word to
[35:41] herself and she kept the word to herself
[35:43] and she started to press her way she
[35:45] didn't matter who was next to her who
[35:47] was there just quiet who was there for
[35:49] observation who was there taking notes
[35:51] she had a need and her need was greater
[35:53] than what other people around her so she
[35:55] pushed past him
[35:56] how great is your knee this morning
[35:58] how great is your knee this morning
[36:02] hallelujah
[36:04] my
[36:06] so my word
[36:08] shall not return void
[36:11] hallelujah hallelujah
[36:13] how many had a rough week this week
[36:16] there's only one person two people knows
[36:18] listen elena being honest and now
[36:30] and that and that's all right you know
[36:33] job didn't have a hard week
[36:35] job had a hard place at trying
[36:38] where he lost
[36:39] everything
[36:41] and when he lost he think that wasn't he
[36:43] naturally has a loosey thing in the
[36:44] physical he said i get sick
[36:46] i said i get so bloody that's a lose
[36:48] income you lose everything on your wife
[36:49] say why don't just kill his god and die
[36:51] and we get the insurance money
[36:58] but the bible tells us that the
[36:59] sufferings at this present time because
[37:01] people suffering is not people though
[37:03] that's walking and suffering
[37:06] but are these sufferings of this
[37:07] president are not worthy to be compared
[37:10] with the glory that will be revealed
[37:13] so in other words to get the glory you
[37:15] have to go to the suffering
[37:17] so that's why the bible says the issue
[37:19] not only suffering no but counted all
[37:21] joy
[37:24] so the next question is who had joy
[37:26] through their trials this week
[37:28] [Music]
[37:30] i've seen a different configuration of
[37:32] hands
[37:34] well
[37:38] glory
[37:40] listen god loves honest theorem
[37:45] peter was a fisherman and i'm sure he
[37:47] could assume when peter fell any water
[37:49] after he was walking in the water peter
[37:50] say well let me just backstroke back to
[37:52] the boat so i don't look too bad peter
[37:54] say listen i'm drowning you know
[37:57] peter forget about truman forget about
[38:00] all he would have learned as a fisherman
[38:01] because what he had stepped out on was
[38:03] new territory if he was walking on the
[38:04] water and he was honest himself enough
[38:06] to say i need help
[38:08] when jacob was left alone and he was
[38:10] battling with the angel he just said who
[38:12] are you
[38:13] in other words tell me what you're
[38:14] really going through you say well i'm a
[38:15] deceiver mr planter i'm
[38:19] now your name will be changed
[38:22] because you're overcome
[38:24] but it's okay to let god know lord i
[38:26] need help you know
[38:27] this temper thing this temper thing
[38:30] [Applause]
[38:34] this annoying thing every time again i
[38:36] get easily agitated you could imagine if
[38:38] god was easily agitated
[38:44] you just had no patience you know
[38:50] but this gospel and these trials is to
[38:52] get us to get patience you know
[38:57] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[38:59] godliness
[39:00] and then god has designed the trials he
[39:03] himself has signed off on the trials
[39:05] for brotherly kindness recognizing what
[39:06] you're the age
[39:08] to test it and to try it
[39:11] and he will have to do it over and over
[39:12] again until you say yes that's it you
[39:15] know behaving itself like a son because
[39:16] power has to come
[39:17] [Music]
[39:20] power has to come
[39:22] and for you to have power you have to
[39:23] have character
[39:26] and the police you're trying is when you
[39:28] feel
[39:29] or you don't feel like doing you still
[39:31] do
[39:33] that's what he sacrificed the praises
[39:34] you know
[39:36] back in the old days his sacrifice was
[39:37] bringing the lamb and and but the
[39:40] sacrifice no is is is when you don't
[39:42] want to do what you still do
[39:45] so you don't feel like worshiping you
[39:46] don't feel your body your hand given
[39:49] your trouble but brother branham said
[39:50] when you lift your hand you defy gravity
[39:53] [Applause]
[39:55] so just the actor lifting your hand is
[39:57] defying the laws
[39:59] of this world
[40:01] you're defying gravity when you lift
[40:03] your hands you identify yourself as a
[40:05] worshiper
[40:08] can the church say amen it's a choice
[40:10] it's a choice to worship
[40:12] it's a choice to praise it's a choice to
[40:14] come into the house of god it's a choice
[40:16] to read a word it's a choice to be on
[40:18] fire it's a choice
[40:22] to forgive it's a choice to love it's a
[40:25] choice to have more patience it's a
[40:26] choice to tarry and wall into the horns
[40:28] at the altar it's a choice to bridle
[40:31] your tongue it's a choice i have the
[40:33] right attitude it's a choice it's a
[40:35] choice it's a choice
[40:38] can the church say amen
[40:41] hallelujah
[40:42] god's word has got to come to pass he
[40:45] promised a pride he said there's going
[40:46] to be a super church there's going to be
[40:48] super race that has got to come to pass
[40:51] every word has got to come to pass
[40:53] hallelujah i will restore say the lord
[40:56] that word has got to come to pass that's
[40:58] your promise has nothing to do with what
[41:00] you lost the question of what you lost
[41:02] the question is when is he going to
[41:04] restore because he promised he's going
[41:06] to restore
[41:08] hallelujah
[41:09] [Music]
[41:10] [Applause]
[41:11] hallelujah
[41:13] my my my mind and by the brand i'm in
[41:16] the message putting on the whole armor
[41:17] of god he says that and he's speaking
[41:20] about about secret agents and warfare
[41:22] and he said each nation will equip its
[41:25] people with the latest equipment the
[41:28] very latest and they study and they do
[41:30] everything they're trying to counteract
[41:32] the other fellow's weapons and to get a
[41:34] little more modern weapon something with
[41:36] a little more punch to it and it's the
[41:39] nation's business if they want to
[41:41] survive they want to equip their
[41:43] soldiers with the best equipment that
[41:45] there is
[41:47] well god you know he's infinite he don't
[41:50] have to think anything better
[41:53] hallelujah he doesn't have to think
[41:56] anything better he got the best to begin
[41:58] with so you can't improve on it
[42:01] nothing to be done about it he gives us
[42:04] the best that's his word
[42:07] his word is the best so god's trying to
[42:09] give you our improvement on it it's the
[42:11] same word it's already the best weapon
[42:13] it's your best offense against sickness
[42:16] it's your offense against everything
[42:17] you're going through your boss get in
[42:19] trouble take the word
[42:21] the word is power
[42:22] you're feeling sick take the word by his
[42:25] stripes i'm healed you say the word
[42:27] come on now
[42:29] [Applause]
[42:34] but the random said god cannot make a
[42:36] decision today and tomorrow come back
[42:38] and make a better decision
[42:40] god doesn't make mistakes
[42:42] he doesn't have accidents here well let
[42:45] me try this this morning let me try to
[42:47] talk about the problem i'm going to try
[42:48] to talk to you about a nicholas let me
[42:50] try and see if this will work this time
[42:51] no he makes a perfect decision every
[42:53] time so if god chose you and put your
[42:56] name down on a lamb's book of life he
[42:58] can make a i will never do it i will
[42:59] never do it right no he already chose
[43:02] you and god cannot change his mind
[43:06] he cannot change his mind about you
[43:08] oh hallelujah and the arrow of god's
[43:12] deliverance has already been shut he
[43:14] can't even pull it back his prophecy
[43:16] over you has already been spoken he
[43:19] can't even take it back
[43:21] hallelujah
[43:25] [Music]
[43:26] so you can rest
[43:27] on whatever god says
[43:29] you can rest on whatever god says
[43:32] concerning your life you can rest on
[43:34] what he says about your health
[43:36] you have to rest on what he says about
[43:38] your spiritual condition that he will
[43:40] not leave you barren it's not his desire
[43:42] to leave you empty you could rest on
[43:44] what he says when he says he gonna give
[43:45] you the holy ghost
[43:47] you could rest on that you have to go
[43:48] beyond your emotions beyond your
[43:51] feelings are beyond your mistakes the
[43:53] devil's job is to keep you in that realm
[43:56] of your mistakes and your sins and your
[43:58] failures and what went wrong and you
[44:00] lose control
[44:02] that's the devil's job
[44:04] but we are here this morning to get
[44:06] reminded
[44:08] that there's a seed in our soul
[44:10] that the devil cannot mess with
[44:12] the devil didn't put it there
[44:14] the devil cannot reach it
[44:16] he cannot get to it but the branham said
[44:19] him to get access to it he have to come
[44:20] under the blood and he cannot come under
[44:23] the blood because if the devil will come
[44:25] under the blood he'll be your brother
[44:26] but the devil is our enemy he cannot
[44:29] come under the blood so he cannot come
[44:31] and touch what's inside your soul he has
[44:34] no access he has no access when the
[44:38] devil tries to reach you he tries to
[44:40] reach you access denial he can reach
[44:42] other people but you you are the blood
[44:45] washed ones there's power in the blood
[44:48] there's a blood bumper around you the
[44:50] devil could try to afflict your body he
[44:52] could try to mess with your spirit but
[44:55] your soul there's a seed in there a germ
[44:58] of predestination
[45:00] [Applause]
[45:02] hallelujah you may be seated
[45:05] and that seed
[45:06] is based on the law of god
[45:09] that seed could only produce after its
[45:11] kind and that seed in that seed has
[45:15] every genetic code from god
[45:17] in that seed is a living fate it's a
[45:20] living virtue it's a living knowledge
[45:22] it's a living temperance it's a living
[45:24] patient it's a living calling in that
[45:26] seed is the mechanics in that seed is
[45:30] the dna of who you are that you didn't
[45:32] know about so god had to send a message
[45:35] to wake up your understanding that this
[45:38] seed is in your soul and god has to wake
[45:40] up your understanding that you are to
[45:42] get that seed in the right atmosphere
[45:44] because you could take a seed you may be
[45:46] seeded and if you put the seed
[45:49] on ice
[45:51] it'll have a different result
[45:53] and if you put it in good ground
[45:54] it's all about the environment so what
[45:57] if branham said if you take a chicken
[45:58] egg
[45:59] and put the egg under a dog didn't he
[46:01] see that because the atmosphere is right
[46:04] the chicken would still hatch because it
[46:05] has to be in the right environment and
[46:07] when you take a seed
[46:09] you can't put the seed in nice beautiful
[46:11] sprinkled sand and printer nice does
[46:14] know you have to put the seed in manure
[46:16] you have to put the seed in the field
[46:18] sometimes you have to put a seed in
[46:19] conditions that that that seem contrary
[46:22] to the beauty that's about to be
[46:24] unveiled so god under the chaos of
[46:26] darkness under the chaos of this world
[46:29] allowed us to grow up in different homes
[46:31] different families different backgrounds
[46:33] that appear to be so messed up that the
[46:36] devil have to wonder could anything good
[46:38] come out to nazareth the devil had to
[46:40] wander could a bride come out of
[46:42] trinidad the devil after one is there
[46:45] somebody's going to overcome because
[46:47] they're looking bleak and looking like
[46:49] the bride is dead it looked like nobody
[46:51] holding the message but the seed is
[46:53] still alive and the devil because he
[46:55] can't see it because he was hidden under
[46:57] the seventh seal he is trying to do
[47:00] mathematics and geometry and algebra to
[47:03] figure out who you are the same way he
[47:06] had to ask jesus if thou be
[47:09] if thou be
[47:10] if thou be if god poured himself into
[47:14] christ and the devil didn't even know
[47:16] who he was
[47:18] what about you as an amateur god what
[47:21] about you as a measure of that stature
[47:24] the devil has no idea who you are you
[47:27] are god's secret weapons his secret
[47:30] agents
[47:32] somebody say man
[47:41] blessed be the name of the lord
[47:44] hallelujah
[47:46] so his word
[47:47] cannot return void
[47:50] but ibrahim said this message would
[47:53] find itself in the hands of the
[47:55] predestinated
[47:56] you didn't find the message
[47:58] the message found you
[48:00] the message interrupted your life
[48:02] the message haunted you the message
[48:04] followed you the message convicted you
[48:07] the message convinced you even when you
[48:09] backslid
[48:11] it troubled you
[48:13] you tried to do different things and
[48:15] somehow you just didn't feel comfortable
[48:16] that's why i say young people all the
[48:18] time listen when you have one foot in
[48:20] church and one foot of the church is the
[48:22] most miserable existence
[48:28] the most frustrated place to be is one
[48:30] foot in church and one foot in the world
[48:35] because you can't go to a party and jump
[48:37] up
[48:39] because there's too much of god in you
[48:41] to be comfortable there so you're
[48:42] jumping on one foot jumping
[48:45] you can't enter in that
[48:47] and when they come to church you can't
[48:48] enter all the way in because one foot
[48:49] they fight and i'm trying to be outside
[48:51] you're upstairs on your foot outside.
[49:01] but something has to take over is about
[49:02] surrender
[49:05] it's about throwing up the white flag
[49:06] and saying lord i surrender
[49:09] that's where the song comes from i
[49:11] surrender all
[49:16] surrender control surrender decision
[49:18] making surrender all of it to what god
[49:20] wants
[49:21] and when you do that it's simple this
[49:23] message is not complicated you know
[49:25] it's a message of surrender it's a
[49:27] message of commitment it's a method of
[49:29] truth and faith and a reality that your
[49:31] behavior has to change
[49:32] [Music]
[49:33] people coming to church and going back
[49:35] and they have more knowledge but their
[49:37] behavior is him
[49:39] more information but the behavior is the
[49:41] same
[49:42] if it disrespectful to your husband i
[49:43] would expect at least every week you're
[49:45] less disrespectful until it's gone
[49:47] but at the same level as you respect for
[49:49] years you were operated at level nine
[49:53] let it hit eight now seven six five four
[49:56] until it
[49:58] some people lose the behaviors
[49:59] immediately
[50:00] like like like soul on the road to
[50:02] damascus
[50:03] god knock him off the horse immediate
[50:05] transformation but there's some people
[50:06] it's a process
[50:08] we would pray everybody's immediate but
[50:10] that's not the case
[50:11] it's a process of character development
[50:15] a process but a random talk about
[50:17] praying and he said as you're about to
[50:19] break through it's when you're getting
[50:20] tired and the mosquitoes come the
[50:21] prophet had to go through that
[50:25] you can't just go check my next one you
[50:27] pray for two hours solid every day
[50:28] really
[50:29] it's a process
[50:31] and you have to carve out more time you
[50:33] have to and this is your work now
[50:37] people are waiting on god to give to
[50:38] give them
[50:39] to give you what he already gave you the
[50:41] word
[50:42] which is all the weapons you need and in
[50:44] the world gives you instructions about
[50:46] having a prayer life in the word have
[50:48] instructions husband love your wives
[50:50] that's a commandment in the word
[50:52] instruction children obey your
[50:53] appearance
[50:57] in the word don't forsake the assembling
[50:58] of yourselves together
[51:00] so you're supposed to be in the house of
[51:01] god
[51:04] in the word present your boys a living
[51:07] sacrifice
[51:08] holy and acceptable that's in the word
[51:18] walk before me be thou perfect let god
[51:20] say that that's in the wood
[51:22] so your promise is there
[51:24] jesus come back and matthew fivefold
[51:25] here be therefore perfect as your father
[51:27] in heaven is perfect that's your word
[51:33] that is your hope that's your
[51:34] expectation that's your reality
[51:37] but if you're not anointing a word to
[51:39] yourself what are you doing
[51:40] you're just making circles you are in
[51:42] your own death walk
[51:43] walking around in circles coming to
[51:45] church walking around in circles
[51:48] but when you see that his word shall not
[51:50] return void that word that is not
[51:52] returning void is not just
[51:54] blessings you know
[51:56] it's also judgments
[52:00] because when god pronounced judgment on
[52:02] sodom and gomorrah he couldn't even take
[52:03] it back
[52:07] judgment had already been spoken
[52:09] so you have to extract lord out because
[52:11] when god speaks he can't unwind his word
[52:14] he already spoke it so judgment is
[52:16] spoken over los angeles
[52:18] judgment is spoken over this island
[52:20] judgment is spoken over this earth
[52:22] fire is coming judgment is coming
[52:25] but a rapture is also coming
[52:28] deliverance is also coming a way of
[52:30] escape has already been spoken and is
[52:32] here and god sent a prophet to make sure
[52:35] that that message of escape gets to us
[52:37] that we could get ready and make
[52:39] preparations the same way noah made
[52:41] preparations the same way all through
[52:43] the ages they made preparation so too we
[52:46] come this morning to make preparations
[52:50] to be positionally placed
[52:52] before the terrible plague strike to be
[52:54] in position before judgment strike we're
[52:57] not here this morning because of fear we
[52:59] are here this morning because of love we
[53:01] are the pride of jesus christ his love
[53:03] his unconditional love for us was so
[53:06] great
[53:08] that he overlooked our failures
[53:10] overlooked our mystics overlooked our
[53:12] faults overlooked our backsliding
[53:14] overlooked the many days you didn't pray
[53:16] overlooked the days he didn't read the
[53:18] bible and he still said i love you and i

[1:00:19] to me this morning this is the gospel
[1:00:22] it's not putting on a suit on sunday
[1:00:24] morning it's him being welcome to go
[1:00:27] everywhere because the bible said he
[1:00:29] went everywhere with them confirming the
[1:00:32] word with signs wonders and miracles
[1:00:35] [Applause]
[1:00:40] bro benjamin would jesus be welcome
[1:00:47] would he be welcome brother jason
[1:00:51] would he be welcome in your house
[1:00:55] because here it looks okay but would he
[1:00:56] be welcome
[1:00:59] because to make him feel welcome your
[1:01:01] behavior has to change
[1:01:04] your language has to change
[1:01:07] your conduct has to change
[1:01:09] [Music]
[1:01:15] can we dig into this a little bit
[1:01:17] if somebody irrespect come to your house
[1:01:19] i've seen people whisper in the
[1:01:22] kitchen and if the person wasn't there
[1:01:24] there wasn't whispering
[1:01:27] italian was the two cups because he are
[1:01:30] you ready reach until you wash the two
[1:01:32] cups
[1:01:38] so you feel embarrassed when somebody
[1:01:40] come like if your balls come in for the
[1:01:42] house and be like no you know he must
[1:01:44] excuse the place
[1:01:47] okay
[1:01:52] me please say i
[1:01:53] i wasn't really able to clean for the
[1:01:54] last nine months just exclusive please
[1:02:02] jesus is not coming to get no excuse
[1:02:03] depletion
[1:02:14] we're talking about a change of behavior
[1:02:17] excuse the place tonight's heart talking
[1:02:18] to my wife for the last eight months we
[1:02:20] we really trying to speak in terms like
[1:02:22] the way we sir
[1:02:24] we just talk
[1:02:32] make jesus welcome
[1:02:37] because for jesus to be welcomed because
[1:02:39] jesus is love
[1:02:42] so love has to be there because that's
[1:02:43] what attracts him in him
[1:02:45] his attraction to us is because he so
[1:02:47] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:02:49] begotten son it was love was driving his
[1:02:52] behavior
[1:02:54] so to make jesus feel welcome there has
[1:02:56] to be love between husband and wife love
[1:02:58] between wife and husband love between
[1:03:00] father and son and
[1:03:03] anybody in the house is there anybody in
[1:03:05] the house this morning
[1:03:08] [Applause]
[1:03:10] for jesus to feel welcome the love must
[1:03:12] be
[1:03:14] reciprocated can i speak on a little bit
[1:03:20] because god i heard a preacher say god
[1:03:23] bankrupted heaven if he gives you the
[1:03:24] word by giving everything he had his
[1:03:26] only begotten son his love was so great
[1:03:29] he gave everything
[1:03:32] all that god was he brought it to christ
[1:03:35] and he sends christ down as the greatest
[1:03:37] gift when he search heaven to figure out
[1:03:40] how to express his love
[1:03:42] the only way he could do it is his only
[1:03:44] begotten son
[1:03:45] his most valuable possession he gave it
[1:03:49] all
[1:03:50] [Applause]
[1:03:51] to redeem man
[1:03:53] and we in turn want to give him a uh two
[1:03:56] hours on a sunday
[1:04:00] is that what
[1:04:02] love means to you
[1:04:05] because god is lover
[1:04:07] he may be seated
[1:04:10] that's why i don't take issues and
[1:04:11] brother nicholas help me understand this
[1:04:13] sometimes he is his simple things gives
[1:04:15] us the perspective
[1:04:18] sometimes i think about nicolas also was
[1:04:20] talking
[1:04:22] and he was explaining he said people
[1:04:24] will say
[1:04:24] why is leave your house to go all the
[1:04:26] way to granny you say well
[1:04:29] some time ago you know sorry i delivered
[1:04:30] him or somebody you know he said i had a
[1:04:32] girlfriend in tokyo or something
[1:04:35] and he said he was leaving
[1:04:36] it was marawi to go up to toko wherever
[1:04:39] and he was traveling
[1:04:42] because he loved was great
[1:04:44] they don't know easy trouble
[1:04:50] but the love was so great it was
[1:04:52] men back in the old days before you had
[1:04:54] what's up on these things you have to
[1:04:55] know that you plan to visit you have to
[1:04:57] plan the trip you have to save it
[1:04:59] you have to leave early in the morning
[1:05:00] to make it on time what drove that
[1:05:03] behavior was love
[1:05:06] if it wasn't really sure he was in love
[1:05:08] he wasn't doing them
[1:05:15] is this is this reaching anybody
[1:05:19] so if you tell me you love god and jesus
[1:05:23] went deeper he said how could you even
[1:05:24] love god if i love you person next to
[1:05:26] you because you god see me
[1:05:29] and you're telling people you love me
[1:05:30] but your brother next year you're
[1:05:31] looking at him
[1:05:32] shaking hand here called him for the
[1:05:34] week but i don't know how we barely
[1:05:36] love me
[1:05:39] let me dig down in this thing called
[1:05:41] love
[1:05:44] because we are one body
[1:05:49] so when one member the body and pain
[1:05:52] you ought to feel it
[1:05:53] and when one member is in joy you ought
[1:05:55] to feel it too because there's one body
[1:05:57] it's a body of christ by one spirit
[1:05:59] you're baptized into that one body
[1:06:06] so friends this is to encourage you this
[1:06:08] morning this is not in my notes so
[1:06:10] somebody pull in
[1:06:12] and i'm yielding to the poll this
[1:06:13] morning
[1:06:14] because this has to become a real test
[1:06:16] what are you looking for preacher are
[1:06:17] looking for reality that the behavior
[1:06:19] when people see you see me they must
[1:06:21] take note that something is different
[1:06:23] about us
[1:06:27] that we have been with jesus because it
[1:06:28] was understood that when you met jesus
[1:06:31] your life was not the same you can't
[1:06:33] tell people you met jesus and you live
[1:06:35] in the same way
[1:06:38] you have yet to meet jesus
[1:06:40] because when you meet him your behavior
[1:06:42] is supposed to change your love is
[1:06:44] supposed to change your worship is
[1:06:47] supposed to change your commitment is
[1:06:49] supposed to change
[1:06:50] somebody preached back to me
[1:06:53] [Applause]
[1:06:56] [Music]
[1:06:58] i always find myself with these messages
[1:06:59] where it's not they shout for joy and
[1:07:01] they kinda come into your house opening
[1:07:04] doors opening windows pulling out under
[1:07:06] the bed
[1:07:08] you know some people when they clean and
[1:07:09] they say i have to clean myself
[1:07:11] because you're afraid to let people help
[1:07:12] you you don't know what you're going to
[1:07:14] find
[1:07:19] but when you're living right you can
[1:07:20] send me you you can help me have nothing
[1:07:22] here to hide
[1:07:24] you're like
[1:07:25] don't go in that door don't go no that
[1:07:27] leave that window dude no not that room
[1:07:29] just clean that's clean you know what
[1:07:30] just clean the porch
[1:07:32] i'll handle everything else
[1:07:36] because you have stuff hiding in here
[1:07:37] and stuff hiding in here and you know
[1:07:39] that weighs down your life
[1:07:42] but about them calling unconfessing
[1:07:46] the bible say confess your force one to
[1:07:48] another get it out your system
[1:07:51] encourage one another proof walk one
[1:07:53] another
[1:07:58] it's like you know there's some people
[1:08:00] here they don't want to go by the doctor
[1:08:02] could they
[1:08:04] they want to go away doctor they
[1:08:07] they freed the injection they
[1:08:11] but you then living with the pain
[1:08:14] when help is available
[1:08:16] and when we come to church we come for
[1:08:18] the word to begin to operate
[1:08:20] and uncover things that we may think is
[1:08:22] okay
[1:08:23] that we may think i want you to get this
[1:08:25] now that you think it's okay but it's
[1:08:26] not
[1:08:31] that's why brother ovid always say
[1:08:32] husband love your wives not as your
[1:08:35] father love your mother
[1:08:37] but as christ loved the church
[1:08:40] because we measure things based on our
[1:08:42] experiences
[1:08:44] we measure things based on our knowledge
[1:08:45] we measure things based on our
[1:08:47] understanding but god has a way
[1:08:50] and our objective of coming to church is
[1:08:52] to see his way not my way not the
[1:08:54] pastor's way his way
[1:08:57] the way he operates because we want to
[1:08:59] be like him
[1:09:01] can the church say amen
[1:09:08] and no wonder the prophet can say full
[1:09:11] obedience to the entire word of god
[1:09:13] is what entitles you to the token
[1:09:16] because full obedience to the word will
[1:09:18] bring you into subjection to the word
[1:09:21] waiting for dynamics to come upon the
[1:09:23] mechanics
[1:09:24] but the mechanics part is your part the
[1:09:27] dynamics part is his part
[1:09:30] can the church say amen
[1:09:35] anybody
[1:09:37] everybody feeling fine this morning
[1:09:39] could we could we go somewhere
[1:09:41] that's just
[1:09:42] it background are you ready are you
[1:09:44] ready
[1:09:45] i really hit anything yet to know
[1:09:50] we're looking for a change of behavior
[1:09:54] and god will test us
[1:09:56] and he told us the devil will also test
[1:09:59] and make you prove every one of these
[1:10:01] virtues
[1:10:02] so you have tests coming from every side
[1:10:05] to prove these virtues are operating in
[1:10:08] you
[1:10:08] before you could seal the whole thing
[1:10:11] so it must be proven before the final
[1:10:13] ceiling before charity comes a bond of
[1:10:15] perfection to complete the whole thing
[1:10:17] and say this is a finished work
[1:10:22] what can the church say amen
[1:10:24] and in order for you to even be here
[1:10:26] this morning you had to be led by the
[1:10:28] spirit
[1:10:31] just like simeon was led by the spirit
[1:10:32] you shall not see death until you see
[1:10:34] the lord's christ seaman was living
[1:10:36] comfortable because he knew that he
[1:10:38] couldn't die until he see the lord's
[1:10:39] christ
[1:10:41] blind anna without having eyes to see in
[1:10:44] the natural was led by the spirit to
[1:10:46] identify messiah wasn't it
[1:10:49] that's being led by the spirit
[1:10:52] but it might have been a message
[1:10:53] expectation the same reason that you're
[1:10:55] here tonight and i say today you sick
[1:10:57] people the same holy ghost
[1:10:59] that led simeon the same holy ghost that
[1:11:01] led anna has led you here
[1:11:04] for you believe that there's a fountain
[1:11:05] open somewhere for healing
[1:11:07] it's here god moving amongst his people
[1:11:11] and his people believing so the holy
[1:11:13] spirit could only lead you to truth
[1:11:16] the holy spirit can only leave you to
[1:11:18] act right you cannot tell me the spirit
[1:11:20] of your acting bad
[1:11:22] you misbehaving and saying his
[1:11:24] spirit so if you are if you have the
[1:11:27] holy ghost you're looking for the holy
[1:11:28] ghost there's evidence of that you know
[1:11:31] your behavior you're supposed to be
[1:11:33] speak into that
[1:11:35] you gotta be losing your cool you
[1:11:36] breaking up your house you're mashing up
[1:11:37] things that say is his word
[1:11:44] the holy spirit will not lead you
[1:11:45] sisters to cut your hair
[1:11:48] try to butt up makeup trying to
[1:11:50] look like the world and could imagine if
[1:11:54] jesus is welcome in your room and you're
[1:11:55] there trying to pick up and put up
[1:11:57] something on your face to do what
[1:12:01] wouldn't you feel embarrassed
[1:12:04] because i see
[1:12:05] some people who say they believe when
[1:12:07] they meet on your own and
[1:12:09] when they recognize this
[1:12:10] meow but
[1:12:12] anthony they
[1:12:13] don't feel like they're uncomfortable
[1:12:15] look at him from the corner because they
[1:12:17] don't want here
[1:12:19] so if
[1:12:22] a man would make you feel that way how
[1:12:24] should god make you feel
[1:12:27] as you go through every decision of your
[1:12:28] life
[1:12:30] your schoolwork
[1:12:32] your business life your career
[1:12:35] you can't operate like the world
[1:12:38] in the corporate world people will just
[1:12:39] stab me back and do this and do that is
[1:12:41] that what god teaches well how does work
[1:12:43] here you know so
[1:12:45] and you will risk your
[1:12:47] experience with god because of the way
[1:12:49] the world operates on your job or in
[1:12:50] school or whatever
[1:12:53] just want to break this perception of
[1:12:55] this compartmentalization of god to your
[1:12:57] church experience
[1:12:59] but it's when you're alone
[1:13:01] and nobody else is around is your true
[1:13:03] test of who you are
[1:13:08] when your wife not there are your
[1:13:10] children that you're nobody else is
[1:13:11] there who could hold you to a higher
[1:13:13] expectation
[1:13:16] then the real you stands up
[1:13:21] and that's what we are because that is
[1:13:22] what he tutor that's when the holy
[1:13:24] spirit tutor wants to see your behavior
[1:13:27] he really wants to see your behavior
[1:13:29] when nobody else is around
[1:13:32] to see how you will conduct yourself and
[1:13:33] this is what we are fighting for friends
[1:13:37] the church is a born-again bunch of
[1:13:39] believers that's in christ by the holy
[1:13:41] ghost
[1:13:42] led by the spirit of god this from the
[1:13:44] mystery children and jubilee they are
[1:13:46] not of the world they are out of the
[1:13:48] world they are different from the world
[1:13:50] i've preached this before it cannot be
[1:13:52] that you are like the world or you want
[1:13:54] to be like the world or you want to act
[1:13:56] like the world
[1:13:59] the bible said if you love the world and
[1:14:00] the love of god is not even in you
[1:14:02] not even in you
[1:14:04] can the church say amen that's what
[1:14:07] makes them what they are their life is
[1:14:09] dead and they're hidden christ dead in
[1:14:11] christ and hidden sealed by the holy
[1:14:13] ghost they're away from the things of
[1:14:15] the world
[1:14:16] from the messed expectations sons of god
[1:14:19] are led by the spirit of god not led by
[1:14:21] some other fanatics or some organization
[1:14:24] or something other they are led by the
[1:14:26] spirit of god the holy spirit was given
[1:14:28] to the church to be the overseer the
[1:14:31] tutor that was to raise the children of
[1:14:33] god not our bishops and cardinals and so
[1:14:35] forth but the holy ghost
[1:14:37] and brother branham said and this is his
[1:14:39] expectation hear the word for us i'm
[1:14:41] expecting the holy ghost not
[1:14:43] denomination not a bishop not a catholic
[1:14:46] priest not a baptist preacher or a
[1:14:49] pentecostal preacher i'm expecting the
[1:14:51] holy ghost to come and set in order a
[1:14:53] church that will go to meet him filled
[1:14:56] with the power and the resurrection of
[1:14:58] christ i'm expecting that i believe that
[1:15:02] god promised that that there'd be a
[1:15:04] church dear without spot or wrinkle on
[1:15:06] it i'm expecting it because god said it
[1:15:10] was so and my word shall not return unto
[1:15:13] me for it
[1:15:16] can the church say amen
[1:15:19] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:15:24] i remember preaching a message god has
[1:15:26] never changed his strategy
[1:15:28] hallelujah because he's the same
[1:15:30] yesterday today and forever
[1:15:31] i am god and i change not so the way he
[1:15:34] operates he operates the same way every
[1:15:36] time and the devil still doesn't get it
[1:15:38] that even though god operates the same
[1:15:40] way every single time the devil still
[1:15:42] can't figure out how god operates
[1:15:44] hallelujah romans 8 30 moreover whom he
[1:15:47] did predestinate
[1:15:49] demi also called and whom he called them
[1:15:52] you also justify and whom he justified
[1:15:55] them he also glorified because he
[1:15:58] predestinated you because he foreknew
[1:16:01] you he could predestinate you because he
[1:16:03] predestinated you he called you because
[1:16:05] he called you he justified you and
[1:16:08] listen these words are all past tenser
[1:16:14] let me read it again
[1:16:15] i want you to this is not future tense
[1:16:17] of presidential no more moreover whom he
[1:16:19] did predestinate demi also called past
[1:16:22] tense
[1:16:22] and whom he called them he also
[1:16:24] justified past tense and whom he
[1:16:26] justified them he also glorified past
[1:16:28] tense so god is not no predestinated no
[1:16:32] calling no justifying no no he already
[1:16:36] did it
[1:16:37] so your destination the glory is
[1:16:39] guaranteed
[1:16:41] he is speaking as a finished work
[1:16:43] what demon what devil what doubt what
[1:16:46] password mystic can separate you from
[1:16:49] the love of god
[1:16:51] oh
[1:16:52] hallelujah nothing past nothing present
[1:16:55] nothing
[1:17:03] hallelujah
[1:17:04] everybody feeling fine
[1:17:07] oh hallelujah
[1:17:12] in a message a guide
[1:17:14] and i love this quote
[1:17:16] because god and said god has never
[1:17:19] changed his strategy
[1:17:21] never change it
[1:17:23] and satan has never changed his
[1:17:26] so this is the part that confuses me by
[1:17:27] the judge if god hasn't changed your
[1:17:29] strategy and by the way i said the devil
[1:17:31] catching a strategy and god always
[1:17:33] winning
[1:17:36] and the devil had no room to change
[1:17:38] because he don't change the strategy
[1:17:40] either that means god will win
[1:17:41] everything
[1:17:43] every single time
[1:17:44] so this is a rigged game you know
[1:17:46] we know the result before the game play
[1:17:48] every day
[1:17:51] every day we know the outcome in them
[1:17:54] every single day we know the outcome
[1:18:01] every single day we know the outcome
[1:18:04] and what's the confirmation of it i want
[1:18:05] you to get this for a minute you maybe
[1:18:07] see that
[1:18:08] i heard somebody speaking recently about
[1:18:10] jesus people know jesus as the healer
[1:18:12] people know jesus as he as as as jesus
[1:18:15] who was asleep on a boat and that's
[1:18:16] wonderful but he said he resurrected
[1:18:18] christ
[1:18:21] because within judaism and islam and
[1:18:24] these other groups they recognize jesus
[1:18:25] as prophet
[1:18:26] what they have problem with is he
[1:18:28] resurrected christ now
[1:18:31] because they have no problem with jesus
[1:18:33] as prophet
[1:18:34] but they have a prosperity resurrected
[1:18:36] christ
[1:18:37] because the resurrected christ is the
[1:18:38] one that break the moral of all the
[1:18:40] other prophets
[1:18:42] all jew jesus ministry he was calling
[1:18:45] him god master calling him teacher
[1:18:47] that's what they how they say address
[1:18:48] the others rabbi teacher master healer
[1:18:52] it's not that the jews were not
[1:18:54] knowledgeable about miracles they knew
[1:18:56] miracles
[1:18:57] so jesus doing a miracle wasn't really a
[1:19:00] big big big thing in context because
[1:19:02] they knew they had miracles before
[1:19:05] but is he when jesus died
[1:19:07] and he put the word before he died he
[1:19:08] said destroy this temple and three days
[1:19:10] and raise him back up again
[1:19:12] them kind of things is what people have
[1:19:14] problem with dicey thing the devil
[1:19:16] really had an issue with
[1:19:18] because when jesus died
[1:19:21] jesus the bible said i have no sin but
[1:19:24] in order for him to get the pass the
[1:19:26] ticket to get to hell
[1:19:27] because you have to get a ticket to go
[1:19:29] to helicopters going to hell
[1:19:31] you have to have sin to go to hell but
[1:19:32] jesus didn't have any sin so he had to
[1:19:34] find him
[1:19:36] and jesus stood there and started
[1:19:38] collection
[1:19:40] to get a ticket
[1:19:41] he took the sin from the past the sin
[1:19:44] from the present the sin from the future
[1:19:46] and he said taking all of it
[1:19:48] and are putting on this sin because i
[1:19:50] want nobody to question my ticket to get
[1:19:53] young into hell because what jesus was
[1:19:55] going for was beyond just redemption he
[1:19:58] was going for authority and power
[1:20:00] because the bible said all
[1:20:02] power in heaven and earth was given unto
[1:20:04] him but the devil was holding some keys
[1:20:09] so when jesus reached they couldn't stop
[1:20:12] him from walking inside
[1:20:13] because he was sinful but he was the
[1:20:16] only one who could walk in there and
[1:20:17] walk back out
[1:20:18] for the first time someone could walk in
[1:20:21] and walk back out
[1:20:23] he walking and manhandling security
[1:20:25] walking and man-handling bodyguards walk
[1:20:28] straight past the bodyguards straight to
[1:20:31] the devil
[1:20:33] and took the keys
[1:20:34] turn back around unlock abraham unlock
[1:20:38] isaiah unlock joel and nope listen i
[1:20:42] want you to picture it and nobody could
[1:20:44] move
[1:20:45] because they never saw this before jesus
[1:20:47] was doing what had never been done
[1:20:49] before all the demons in hell want to
[1:20:51] know who is this
[1:20:53] who is this who is the king of glory the
[1:20:56] lord mighty in battle he had come down
[1:21:03] can the church say man
[1:21:04] [Applause]
[1:21:08] maybe she did
[1:21:10] i had preached about this before
[1:21:13] god's dominion is heaven he put man to
[1:21:15] rule the earth man's dominion is the
[1:21:18] earth that's why you have to pray
[1:21:20] because god don't operate without prayer
[1:21:22] god don't move without a request
[1:21:24] somebody have to cry hannah had to cry
[1:21:26] the children had to cry somebody on the
[1:21:28] earth has to do something to activate
[1:21:30] god to move on the scene it takes a
[1:21:32] human it takes a man a son in position
[1:21:35] to activate the glories to activate the
[1:21:38] power god doesn't just drop down unless
[1:21:40] somebody makes a request that's why when
[1:21:42] he called to moses he said i've heard
[1:21:44] the cries of my people and i've come
[1:21:46] down because man has dominion
[1:21:49] somebody preached back to me
[1:21:54] [Applause]
[1:21:56] you ever seen a bearing mind that's
[1:21:57] fallen man
[1:21:59] man in egypt has fallen man that man in
[1:22:01] egypt without the holy ghost that's man
[1:22:03] in egypt living in sin that's man in
[1:22:05] egypt before the fullness of the
[1:22:07] atonement and yet still their cries
[1:22:09] interrupted heaven and caused god to
[1:22:11] drop down on the earth because somebody
[1:22:13] had activated his presence or somebody
[1:22:16] preached back to me
[1:22:17] [Applause]
[1:22:22] so in order to fulfill the plan of
[1:22:24] redemption
[1:22:25] god had to find a body
[1:22:27] that's why he had to get jesus he had to
[1:22:29] put a sperm inside of mary and by the
[1:22:32] branham said he breaks it all together
[1:22:33] himself so he could have a body he could
[1:22:35] use so now this body can activate
[1:22:38] everything you don't need somebody else
[1:22:40] who don't understand the plan so jesus
[1:22:42] cannot say when you see me you see the
[1:22:44] father we think in the same way we on
[1:22:46] the same page we know i am here my hour
[1:22:49] has not yet come
[1:22:55] because jesus is on a mission to bring
[1:22:56] deliverance
[1:22:58] to set the captives free to comfort them
[1:23:00] that mourn he was the prophet of prophet
[1:23:03] the teacher of teacher the master of
[1:23:05] master the king of kings the lord of
[1:23:07] lords
[1:23:08] wrapped up in human flesh
[1:23:10] and he was vulnerable
[1:23:12] he was tired he was weak
[1:23:15] he fell asleep and this great god stood
[1:23:17] in front of lazarus grave and wept and
[1:23:20] when he shook back his head he activated
[1:23:22] who was inside of him he said lazarus
[1:23:25] come forth and brother branham said if
[1:23:27] he didn't say lazarus every dead
[1:23:31] every dead person was going to wake up
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:38] everybody with me this morning
[1:23:43] so what are you afraid of this morning
[1:23:45] knowing the pork is saying these burgers
[1:23:47] say death where's this thing
[1:23:49] grave what victory you talking about
[1:23:52] because even if i die listen it's just
[1:23:55] me speedily getting to bite you off in
[1:23:57] here
[1:24:00] this this wretched man that i am this
[1:24:02] flesh man i am here on a mission
[1:24:06] they had no fear
[1:24:08] no fear
[1:24:12] true scripture you know what are you one
[1:24:13] of the most common things jesus said
[1:24:15] fear not fear not fear not
[1:24:17] and then in the new testament later on
[1:24:18] and say for god hasn't given us the
[1:24:20] spirit of fear but a spirit of adoption
[1:24:23] whereby i require our father
[1:24:25] so what are you afraid of
[1:24:27] don't be afraid you're gonna make it
[1:24:29] don't be afraid you're gonna be healed
[1:24:32] don't be afraid whatever you do shall
[1:24:33] prosper don't be afraid keep walking on
[1:24:36] the promise don't be afraid of ten toes
[1:24:38] not fall on your side or whatever i
[1:24:40] shall not be moved
[1:24:42] keep your eyes like flint i'm going to
[1:24:44] the rapture i'm going to the
[1:24:45] resurrection i'm going to have a revival
[1:24:48] my son is coming my daughter is coming
[1:24:50] my wife is going to be delivered that's
[1:24:52] our promise
[1:24:55] hallelujah
[1:24:59] [Applause]
[1:25:01] so god always needs somebody
[1:25:04] if god didn't need anybody he could have
[1:25:05] operated without humans but he needs
[1:25:08] somebody so he called paul
[1:25:11] a pharisee of pharisees
[1:25:13] a odd man who was not there when jesus
[1:25:15] was there
[1:25:16] amen
[1:25:20] and give this man a mission
[1:25:22] and when he was called them brothers
[1:25:23] have an issue with him god does do
[1:25:25] things why can't i get a nice brother
[1:25:26] who was there when he was there
[1:25:28] but he picked paul
[1:25:32] he picked paul
[1:25:33] who brothers had issue with him
[1:25:36] even when paul said preach really by
[1:25:38] whether brother still had issue with
[1:25:39] paul because they was thinking back when
[1:25:40] paul was pushing within them and
[1:25:43] they remember stephen and when paul was
[1:25:46] there and paul was imagining kill him
[1:25:47] and
[1:25:49] when he said so it might sound bad
[1:25:52] but but god was showing that when he
[1:25:55] take a hold of somebody you can't judge
[1:25:57] that person by a human eyes
[1:26:00] paul was a star in the right hand of god
[1:26:05] a messenger at an age
[1:26:07] and god had paul irenaeus martin columba
[1:26:10] luther wesley
[1:26:12] and in our age he sent a prophet
[1:26:14] 20th century prophet
[1:26:16] simple man small man no great education
[1:26:18] but god speaking first to that man and
[1:26:21] then through the man
[1:26:24] the son of man feel that he is son of
[1:26:26] man
[1:26:28] and every word he is speaking a spoken
[1:26:29] word
[1:26:30] the original seed words that cannot fall
[1:26:33] to the ground words that must come to
[1:26:35] pass words that somebody will catch
[1:26:40] words that somebody would hold on to
[1:26:43] words that would change your life
[1:26:46] words that would interrupt the plans of
[1:26:47] the devil
[1:26:48] words that would pronounce healing
[1:26:52] can the church say amen
[1:26:55] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:58] oh my my my i'm not gonna be too much
[1:27:00] longer with you
[1:27:03] oh hallelujah
[1:27:05] god gave the promises
[1:27:07] and he is able to keep his promises
[1:27:10] and when god give the promise to abraham
[1:27:12] in the message convince and concern he
[1:27:13] said he will possess the gates of his
[1:27:15] enemies
[1:27:16] and so shanghai believed that you know
[1:27:18] the saw yosham government and look at
[1:27:20] the odds against him god only needs one
[1:27:22] man
[1:27:23] just let him get one man in his hand the
[1:27:25] world will think he's crazy but he will
[1:27:27] drive home the gospel when he's
[1:27:30] thoroughly convinced that jesus christ
[1:27:32] remains the same yesterday today and
[1:27:34] forever are you thoroughly convinced
[1:27:36] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:27:38] forever because if you are thoroughly
[1:27:40] convinced that he's the same yesterday
[1:27:42] today and forever it'll make you live a
[1:27:44] certain way it'll make you act a certain
[1:27:46] way because you are thoroughly convinced
[1:27:48] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:27:50] forever under anything else he will
[1:27:52] stand true and go on because he's
[1:27:54] thoroughly convinced that god is god and
[1:27:57] if he ever was god he is still god
[1:27:58] that's where the man i'm speaking if he
[1:28:00] isn't the god he was he never was god
[1:28:04] that's right he's the infinite god the
[1:28:07] all-powerful almighty omnipresent
[1:28:09] omniscient infinite oh my he's god he's
[1:28:13] the same god that opened the red sea
[1:28:15] he's the same god that brought daniel
[1:28:17] out of the lions then the same god that
[1:28:19] brought the hebrew children from the
[1:28:21] fiery furnace he's the same god that
[1:28:24] raised up jesus christ on easter morning
[1:28:26] he's the same god that fellow near
[1:28:28] pentecost he's the same god that raised
[1:28:31] lazarus out the grave he's the same
[1:28:33] yesterday today and forever and i'm
[1:28:36] convinced that this is the holy ghost
[1:28:39] oh
[1:28:40] hallelujah
[1:28:41] [Applause]
[1:28:45] he's the same yesterday he's the same
[1:28:47] today he's the same forever he's the
[1:28:49] same quarter when joshua says stands
[1:28:52] film and see the salvation of god and
[1:28:54] say son stand right there he's the same
[1:28:57] god and made it come to pass he's the
[1:28:59] same god that was there when you were
[1:29:00] born in the hospital room or in the
[1:29:03] house he was there to make sure all
[1:29:05] delivery was all right he's the same god
[1:29:08] the first day you went to school he was
[1:29:10] there to make sure you went to school he
[1:29:13] was there when you got up this morning
[1:29:15] and started your car he was dear he is
[1:29:18] there all the time
[1:29:21] and he promised to never leave you he
[1:29:23] promised to never forsake you he
[1:29:24] promised to be with you
[1:29:27] peter said on the day of pentecost this
[1:29:29] is that and if this isn't that i'll keep
[1:29:32] this till that comes for i believe this
[1:29:35] is that i'm convinced that it's the
[1:29:37] gospel and the power and the
[1:29:39] demonstration of the resurrection of the
[1:29:42] appearing of the lord jesus in this last
[1:29:44] day making the church ready to be caught
[1:29:47] away
[1:29:48] in the pride
[1:29:52] see
[1:29:53] in the message future home of the
[1:29:54] heavenly bridegroom and healthy bride
[1:29:56] see his plan of redemption is exactly
[1:29:58] the same by everything he uses the same
[1:30:01] method
[1:30:02] he never changes he said in malachi 3 i
[1:30:05] am god and i change not
[1:30:07] the way he does it therefore if he saved
[1:30:09] the first man he ever saved by the shed
[1:30:11] blood of an innocent one he'll have to
[1:30:14] save the next one and everyone he saves
[1:30:16] will have to be the same way
[1:30:18] if he healed a man at any time through
[1:30:20] the journey of life let it be in the
[1:30:22] days of jesus the apostles the prophets
[1:30:24] whenever it was when the same conditions
[1:30:27] is met he's got to do it again that's
[1:30:30] right he doesn't change man changes time
[1:30:33] changes age changes dispensation changes
[1:30:37] but god remains the same he is perfect
[1:30:40] what a hope that ought to give the sick
[1:30:42] people if he ever healed a person he has
[1:30:45] to do it again when the same conditions
[1:30:48] is met he ever saved the man he's got to
[1:30:51] do it on the same grounds he did it the
[1:30:53] first time if he ever fill a man with
[1:30:55] the holy ghost he's got to do it on the
[1:30:57] same grounds he did it the first time if
[1:30:59] he ever raised a man up from the grave
[1:31:01] he's got to do it the second time and
[1:31:03] every other time on the same principle
[1:31:06] he doesn't change oh what a hope that
[1:31:09] gives me what is it not in some man-made
[1:31:12] theory something that groups of men have
[1:31:14] come together but his unchangeable word
[1:31:17] let every man's word be a lie and mind
[1:31:19] be true for heaven and earth will pass
[1:31:21] away but my word shall never fail all
[1:31:25] scripture is given my inspiration jeffo
[1:31:27] is good and profitable for doctrine all
[1:31:30] scripture will be fulfilled every bit of
[1:31:32] it that's what the prophet said can the
[1:31:34] church say amen
[1:31:37] everybody feeling fine
[1:31:39] just a little more we're done
[1:31:46] god's strategy
[1:31:48] is to take empty human vessels
[1:31:51] and shake the world with them
[1:31:54] just a little bit and we'll go as the
[1:31:56] prophet saying like at pentecost what
[1:31:58] did he do it taken them 10 days to get
[1:32:00] all emptied up
[1:32:02] but they was all standing there with
[1:32:03] their vessels turned up and god took
[1:32:05] himself and filled them up that's all
[1:32:07] they shook the world
[1:32:09] pour themselves into them
[1:32:11] the same holy spirit that sealed the
[1:32:13] lutherans that sanctified the methodists
[1:32:16] that baptized the pentecostals is now
[1:32:18] setting an order the coming of the lord
[1:32:20] jesus and the manifestation of the holy
[1:32:22] spirit is that angel trying to get the
[1:32:26] people
[1:32:27] back to the world
[1:32:29] in oneness here we are in the end time
[1:32:31] coming from the east the west north
[1:32:33] south what are we doing getting ready
[1:32:35] for that rapture
[1:32:36] getting ready holding ourselves steady
[1:32:39] for a few minutes
[1:32:40] till every fiber is filled with the holy
[1:32:42] ghost is that your prayer this morning
[1:32:46] that every fiber is filled
[1:32:49] with the holy ghost
[1:32:52] is that your expectation that every
[1:32:54] fiber is filled
[1:32:55] with the holy ghost
[1:32:57] it's all over you it's all in you it's
[1:32:59] all around you it's
[1:33:02] you are so emptied up that he could fill
[1:33:04] every part of you with his present with
[1:33:06] his love with his glory that's my
[1:33:08] expedition that's my prayer that's my
[1:33:10] desire is it your desire this morning
[1:33:14] can the church say
[1:33:16] amen
[1:33:18] glory
[1:33:20] hallelujah hallelujah in the midst of
[1:33:24] the paradox just to bring this home
[1:33:26] my word shall not return void he said in
[1:33:28] every age there had been some of it left
[1:33:30] off so he's saying the reformer didn't
[1:33:33] have time to take care of it in the days
[1:33:34] of luther he only preached justification
[1:33:37] by faith and he was gone they made a
[1:33:39] church
[1:33:40] after that come wesley he preached in
[1:33:41] the vacation there it was and along come
[1:33:43] the pentecostals
[1:33:45] but we are promised according to
[1:33:47] revelation 10 according to malachi 4 and
[1:33:49] saying luke 22 17 and so forth that
[1:33:51] there's got to come an ephesians to this
[1:33:54] there's promising friends there must
[1:33:55] come in ephesians that these sevenfold
[1:33:58] mysteries of the word of god must be
[1:34:00] unfolded and it's in the layout of cnn
[1:34:02] age that this takes place and i believe
[1:34:04] that we are here
[1:34:07] we are here at another ephesians
[1:34:10] we are here at another dispensation we
[1:34:13] are here at another time when the
[1:34:15] closing and the finishing of everything
[1:34:17] is at hand
[1:34:19] what's going on the world the political
[1:34:20] arena wars rumors of wars earthquakes
[1:34:23] technology all these things economic
[1:34:25] powers all the beast powers the system
[1:34:27] are in place
[1:34:31] and the bride is
[1:34:32] getting ready not the church now
[1:34:36] not the church the bride is getting
[1:34:37] ready
[1:34:38] because the church has tribulation
[1:34:39] coming
[1:34:41] but the bride is desperately getting
[1:34:43] ready
[1:34:47] because the world is getting into
[1:34:48] military preparation economic
[1:34:49] preparation
[1:34:51] and only the bride is getting ready to
[1:34:53] leave here
[1:34:56] because we are promised that the bride
[1:34:57] is rapture the rest of the church is
[1:34:59] remnant tribulation
[1:35:01] [Music]
[1:35:03] what group do you belong to this morning
[1:35:07] are you making preparation
[1:35:08] because the bible said his wife had meet
[1:35:10] us already so odie why is making ready
[1:35:12] you know church mama's going to church
[1:35:15] but wife getting ready
[1:35:16] wife is asking what do i need to do to
[1:35:18] get ready
[1:35:19] what what i need what else do i need
[1:35:22] what else do i need to get ready am i
[1:35:24] ready am i sure i'm ready do i have
[1:35:25] everything to go all right do i is is
[1:35:27] everything ready to go
[1:35:30] is that your attitude
[1:35:32] do you have leaving on your mind
[1:35:35] you have a leaving on your mind because
[1:35:36] we're never leaving on your mind it puts
[1:35:38] things into perspective
[1:35:40] without leaving on your mind it puts
[1:35:41] your job into perspective when you have
[1:35:43] leaving on your mind it puts your family
[1:35:45] into perspective we're not leaving on
[1:35:47] your mind it makes you operate a certain
[1:35:49] way
[1:35:50] because you don't know what day the
[1:35:52] flight will call when the raptor express
[1:35:54] will
[1:35:55] so you have to have the ticket in your
[1:35:57] pocket
[1:35:58] you can't forget the ticket home because
[1:36:00] you don't know where they're going to
[1:36:00] get called you have to have it all the
[1:36:02] time
[1:36:03] the token must be displayed you got to
[1:36:05] have it
[1:36:07] so that when the call comes you can say
[1:36:09] i'm ready
[1:36:11] not after government get to go home and
[1:36:12] pray
[1:36:14] we know the parable of the virgins 10
[1:36:16] virgins
[1:36:18] 10 in the message 10 come at the church
[1:36:21] 10 here in the preaching but 5 wives and
[1:36:23] five foolish.
[1:36:28] are they bragging coming back are coming
[1:36:29] back
[1:36:35] and while the bridegroom was not there
[1:36:37] some slumbered some slept and the five
[1:36:39] wise they made sure that they were ready
[1:36:42] lambs ready
[1:36:43] trim none ready
[1:36:46] ready
[1:36:47] they're not taking chances
[1:36:50] they heard too much preaching to take a
[1:36:52] chance
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:36:57] then the cry went up behold the
[1:36:59] bridegroom coming going out to meet him
[1:37:03] the fighters were wise they were ready
[1:37:05] one time
[1:37:06] i'm ready
[1:37:08] they're foolish they know they're
[1:37:09] supposed to get ready
[1:37:11] and then they say well here's what we
[1:37:13] don't have enough light
[1:37:14] we don't have enough oil
[1:37:16] we don't know we don't have enough what
[1:37:17] it takes to make it out to meet the
[1:37:18] bridegroom can we get some
[1:37:22] and the why is saying listen if we give
[1:37:24] you from our oil it will not be enough
[1:37:26] for you and for us
[1:37:28] go to them that sell and buy
[1:37:31] but when it was too late it was too late
[1:37:35] it was too late
[1:37:39] friends time to get ready
[1:37:43] it's time to get ready
[1:37:45] it's time to get ready
[1:37:47] are you ready
[1:37:49] it's time to get ready
[1:37:51] because his word cannot fail
[1:37:53] he doesn't change his strategy
[1:37:56] he will not get you ready you have to
[1:37:58] get yourself ready his wife has made
[1:38:00] herself ready the word is there the
[1:38:02] instructions here the plan for the dress
[1:38:04] the plan for how to operate how to live
[1:38:06] how to act his nature is being his
[1:38:08] action which is all in the world
[1:38:10] how he's supposed to operate
[1:38:11] [Music]
[1:38:13] in the days of esther when esther they
[1:38:15] were being when they had been chosen and
[1:38:17] they had been being prepared to go to
[1:38:18] the king they had all the eunuchs and
[1:38:20] they preparing them to go and meet the
[1:38:22] king
[1:38:28] the eunuchs had no seed the eunuchs were
[1:38:30] just there to prepare them because they
[1:38:31] knew what the king's desire was
[1:38:34] so their message and their ministry was
[1:38:36] just to get to get the potentials ready
[1:38:46] for the king to choose
[1:38:49] and you read it they could have taken
[1:38:51] whatever adornments they want and
[1:38:54] esther didn't choose none of the jewelry
[1:38:56] none of the makeup none of the fancy she
[1:38:57] said whatever the king will wonder
[1:38:59] whatever you recommend but i'm not
[1:39:00] wearing this other stuff and when the
[1:39:01] king saw her that's what he chose
[1:39:05] it wasn't coming from the king and you
[1:39:07] need to wonder already this this car
[1:39:08] work
[1:39:09] no you have to be ready when you come to
[1:39:12] church you're coming to church you'll
[1:39:13] come ready to worship
[1:39:15] ready to receive the word ready
[1:39:19] for the word to have an effect in your
[1:39:20] life
[1:39:21] willing your heart open
[1:39:24] your hearts not close you're not coming
[1:39:25] with your own bias your own expectation
[1:39:28] your own way of how it's supposed to be
[1:39:29] no you come to hear the word and for the
[1:39:31] world to have an effect on your life so
[1:39:33] you can be a better christian a better
[1:39:35] son a better daughter so you can be more
[1:39:37] prepared every week you are supposed to
[1:39:39] be more ready
[1:39:41] so today you're supposed to be more
[1:39:42] ready than last week
[1:39:45] and next week more ready than this week
[1:39:47] but you can't go backwards
[1:39:50] may you today lock your position
[1:39:52] and not go backwards
[1:39:54] this is not the time to backslide not
[1:39:56] the time to give up
[1:39:57] because his word cannot return void and
[1:40:00] his word is hanging over families his
[1:40:02] word is hanging over churches
[1:40:06] his mother already said go through the
[1:40:08] city and put the mark upon those that
[1:40:10] sigh and cry for the abomination in the
[1:40:12] city that world has already gone forth
[1:40:16] and it was that beginning at my
[1:40:18] sanctuary at the ancient man
[1:40:22] that word has already gone out
[1:40:24] and his word cannot return for it
[1:40:27] but to them not sigh and cry
[1:40:29] for them not seek his face his word is
[1:40:31] also true to them he will visit them for
[1:40:34] them that are looking for the holy ghost
[1:40:35] he will visit them for them that are
[1:40:37] hungering and tasting after
[1:40:38] righteousness he will visit them
[1:40:41] because for as many as a hunger and
[1:40:43] testing of the righteousness they shall
[1:40:45] be filled that word cannot return void
[1:40:49] it must accomplish the purpose
[1:40:52] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:40:55] the musician can get ready i'm almost
[1:40:56] done
[1:41:12] hallelujah
[1:41:14] hallelujah
[1:41:16] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:41:22] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:41:25] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:41:33] adam had lost a book
[1:41:35] it was a book of authority
[1:41:37] it was a book of power
[1:41:39] it was a book of names
[1:41:40] adam was supposed to open the book and
[1:41:42] speak from the book and when he called
[1:41:44] names they ought to be created
[1:41:46] but adam lost it when he fell
[1:41:50] and satan tried to grab it
[1:41:52] but his book
[1:41:54] was slipped through his hands
[1:41:56] only certain hands could handle the book
[1:41:58] only certain eyes could see the book so
[1:42:01] the book went back into the hands of the
[1:42:02] original owner
[1:42:05] and we needed a redeemer
[1:42:07] to come and be a kinsman redeemer
[1:42:10] to fully open back access to this book
[1:42:14] so john had wept when he was caught up
[1:42:16] in that dimension because there was
[1:42:18] nobody worthy
[1:42:20] to loose the seals and to open this book
[1:42:23] no wonder john shouted
[1:42:26] when they said behold the land of the
[1:42:28] tribal judah and the lamb started to
[1:42:30] come out and all the whole thing
[1:42:31] unfolded because john knew without
[1:42:34] redemption there was no possibility for
[1:42:36] him
[1:42:41] and all of this that god did that
[1:42:43] manifest through his prophets was to
[1:42:45] bring the word for us that we could have
[1:42:47] comfort in this day
[1:42:49] that we could make it
[1:42:51] right
[1:42:53] but ibrahim said in israel and the
[1:42:54] church i believe there's a church on his
[1:42:55] road tonight
[1:42:56] a power of the living god that men will
[1:42:58] speak the word here and there a little
[1:43:00] flashlight lightning
[1:43:01] and a church is coming out not a
[1:43:03] psychologist not some of this put or
[1:43:05] make-believe but a real true genuine
[1:43:08] anointed holy ghost called out church
[1:43:11] that's what i'm looking for
[1:43:13] can the church say amen
[1:43:16] is that right waiting god trying to
[1:43:18] place his church in position to manifest
[1:43:21] himself you be giving place something
[1:43:22] soft
[1:43:23] one day the right word will be spoken
[1:43:26] but abraham said
[1:43:28] and the right thing will be done
[1:43:30] and we will dash into the presence of
[1:43:32] god
[1:43:33] can the church say amen
[1:43:36] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:43:39] when that prophet was here
[1:43:41] god allowed the prophet to speak
[1:43:43] before the doctor's hand touches my wife
[1:43:44] the tumor will go down and that word had
[1:43:46] to come to pass
[1:43:47] it was the mighty conqueror operating
[1:43:50] when he said sun coming and shine four
[1:43:52] days that was god giving signs to us
[1:43:54] that was the mighty conqueror let there
[1:43:56] be a squirrel that was the voice
[1:43:58] speaking again my word cannot return
[1:44:00] void and there was a squirrel little
[1:44:02] fish i gave you back your life that was
[1:44:04] the mighty conqueror the son of man
[1:44:07] veiled in the son of man word had to
[1:44:09] come to pass sister had you right i give
[1:44:12] you your two boys it had to come to pass
[1:44:15] and today through the word the mighty
[1:44:18] conqueror is here another ephesians is
[1:44:20] here for a revival for seven thunders
[1:44:23] revival for a powerful revival for an
[1:44:26] army to rise up for the holy ghost to
[1:44:29] move through the camp for young people
[1:44:31] to catch a revelation of who they are in
[1:44:33] god my word cannot return void
[1:44:37] but abandon prophesied there's been
[1:44:38] churches churches brides brides churches
[1:44:41] bribes rise but there's got to come one
[1:44:44] there's got to become a real bride there
[1:44:45] must come one that's not only got the
[1:44:48] mechanics but the dynamics of it makes
[1:44:50] the church live moving the power of his
[1:44:52] resurrection that's the word of god that
[1:44:55] cannot return void
[1:44:57] cannot return void
[1:44:59] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

[1:45:04] oh blessed be the name of the lord
