[20:24] back home among you
[20:26] all amen
[20:29] I've been greetings from the brethren in
[20:32] kinasa Congo and we had such a mighty
[20:35] time in the presence of
[20:37] God and um I would say a few words
[20:41] before but Anthony ministered to us this
[20:43] morning what a meeting what a meeting
[20:45] what a glorious meeting that we had um
[20:49] the Lord really worked mightily but just
[20:52] to kind of give a a
[20:53] summary um I shared something about the
[20:58] the church being set in order but
[20:59] country preach about him blessing now
[21:02] bless the but Paul and then Jacob preach
[21:06] about uh this Gospel of the Kingdom
[21:08] shall be preached for witness I preach
[21:11] about
[21:12] uh the sovereignity of the local church
[21:15] and the F Ministry but all preach about
[21:19] uh the work of the ministry and then
[21:22] brother cont p a message I call war in
[21:25] heaven and what a war it was it was
[21:28] really really
[21:30] something and um that was the last
[21:32] service and actually well you would know
[21:34] that by looking at the tapes what time
[21:36] we start what time we finish so the
[21:38] morning service does start in the
[21:40] morning start maybe after 1 or so so we
[21:43] had almost two Services back to back but
[21:46] so brother count had to take the last
[21:48] service
[21:49] and that last
[21:51] service while he was talking of course I
[21:54] I guess was tired whatnot he was
[21:55] laboring and whatnot and during that
[21:58] service people from other churches I
[21:59] guess other groups who had their morning
[22:00] service begin to come into the building
[22:03] and as they were coming into the
[22:04] building it's like everything was drying
[22:07] up just it was an unbelievable thing it
[22:11] came to the spot where brother J had to
[22:13] say how many believe that raise your
[22:15] hands because amen wasn't even coming
[22:17] out but before he went into his thing he
[22:21] had a dream and he shared the dream that
[22:23] this man looking like I guess some Demon
[22:26] some tall guy was looking to capture two
[22:29] sisters who were like Christians and he
[22:31] had a discernment that he trying to
[22:33] catch them or something like that and he
[22:36] put cut a long story short he end up at
[22:37] a fight with this guy I had to beat him
[22:40] out beat him completely out the building
[22:42] all together right out until the sister
[22:43] were free so when I heard the dream I
[22:46] tell myself something like that going to
[22:48] happen but so said so done well brother
[22:51] cont stood there and he stood there and
[22:54] beat that Spirit Plum out the building
[22:59] it was a sight to behold you talk about
[23:02] a labor he did labor when the spirits
[23:05] had a breakthrough he said look we start
[23:07] we start start and then I got a
[23:08] breakthrough again he start and and it
[23:10] just lit the place of fire till the
[23:12] people were just sitting down watching
[23:14] like judges all them had to stick their
[23:16] hand up and whatnot it was really really
[23:18] something else the service went on for
[23:20] hours after we've left the place after
[23:22] all that set of time there's a guy there
[23:25] who we had testimony afterwards
[23:28] which he knew all the messages churches
[23:30] across there when he saw how the whole
[23:33] convention progressed he said he want to
[23:34] get baptized he he's supposed to be a
[23:36] prophet uh in this denominational realm
[23:38] he want to get baptized and so on he had
[23:40] 11 almost I think 16 baptisms and so on
[23:44] the guy who came to do the videotaping
[23:45] for them just imagine that unbeliever
[23:48] and when he finished he want to get
[23:49] baptized in jesus' name it was such a
[23:52] dynamic witness of the
[23:55] spirit and I want you to be encouraged
[23:59] amen be encouraged we are living in
[24:01] difficult times but take great courage
[24:03] in your heart you have to do that get
[24:06] strengthening your own self don't quit

[24:11] amen so before but Anthony come I just
[24:14] want you to stand I just want to read
[24:15] even don't find it just stand for
[24:16] respect for the word revelation CH 12 I

[27:25] this is an important
[27:26] service our heavenly
[27:28] father I'm so happy today to be here at
[27:31] Cleveland this great City one of the
[27:34] major cities our beloved nation and to
[27:35] give a testimony of thy son Jesus who
[27:38] has died to redeem this lost race of
[27:40] people throughout all the world and now
[27:42] as you have gathered us here together
[27:44] this afternoon to pour out your spirit
[27:45] upon us may every man woman boy or girl
[27:48] from every church every Creed

[27:56] prayer let's look to the Future amen
[28:00] let's look to the continuing city that
[28:03] is to come Cleveland is home to many
[28:05] thousands millions over a million people
[28:07] here God we pray that men and women will
[28:10] never be satisfied until they have met
[28:12] peace with you so that we can go to that
[28:14] continuing
[28:16] City looking upon the giant SK scraper
[28:19] in the
[28:20] city looking upon the fine buildings and
[28:23] structures but there will be a time when
[28:27] there won't won't be one stone left upon
[28:30] another we
[28:32] believe that these cities in this great
[28:35] major conflict that's coming will be
[28:38] rocked with atomic powers and millions
[28:42] will die in
[28:45] hours blowed to bits even the Earth
[28:49] shook from its orbit going into the sun
[28:51] great heat shall Scorch men as the
[28:55] scripture says in the book of
[28:58] Revelation I felt led to bring that to
[29:00] you this morning that Millions will die
[29:04] am but help us God to get our mind on
[29:08] you settled down to go into this bloody
[29:11] Trail I review it Lord the best of my
[29:14] knowledge you help me as I start back in
[29:17] the beginning when you put your hand on
[29:19] your poor humble servant I may all my
[29:21] mistakes today May others and young boys
[29:23] and girls who come in may they be
[29:25] stepping stones to bring them to thee
[29:27] may they profit for my errors of
[29:29] suffering that they might know you in
[29:31] the power of the Resurrection for we ask
[29:33] it in Jesus name amen
[29:36] amen another message the resurrection of
[29:39] Lazarus notice before God does anything
[29:41] on Earth he always sends a message
[29:44] warning getting things ready he said I
[29:47] kind of feel religious right now I
[29:49] believe there's something moving going
[29:51] on now God warning as it was the days of
[29:55] Noah get to the people ready something
[29:57] is about to happen the atomic powers and
[30:00] things are ready to burst Upon Us
[30:03] Millions will die in a split second but
[30:05] oh my God is getting his church ready
[30:07] for the Rapture the coming of the Lord
[30:10] then before God send something to the
[30:12] Earth he always sends his message and
[30:15] God sends his angels to vindicate or
[30:19] verify certain things so the angel of
[30:22] the Lord is on earth now yes sir fixing
[30:25] things around for his coming he will
[30:27] move governments he will move ministers
[30:30] he will move preachers he will move
[30:32] pastors he will move neighbors he will
[30:34] move businesses he'll move whatever he
[30:36] has to move and shift around for the
[30:39] coming of the Lord
[30:41] hallelujah
[30:42] hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of
[30:45] the Lord and when Daniel saw the Gentile
[30:49] Kingdom coming to a close notice what
[30:51] was unfolded every kingdom was inferior
[30:54] to the one before
[30:55] that every kingdom was inferior to the
[30:59] one PR priority it'll get worse isn't
[31:01] that right now but Bram says this one
[31:06] more this only seven seal if them others
[31:10] is perfectly in the D with the word so
[31:12] is this perfectly in the D with the word
[31:14] we are here
[31:17] wow we are the end friend soon it shall
[31:20] time run out Millions would lose their
[31:23] lives now I believe that they are saved
[31:27] they will be counted as a father for the
[31:30] atomic age he call them Father that just
[31:33] material to make that that prophecy come
[31:35] to pass making that up we don't want to
[31:37] be Atomic father we want to be raptured
[31:39] Saints and there's not two groups taking
[31:42] one group taking one left it's two one
[31:45] taken one left it's who is going to be
[31:47] that one that going to be taken that
[31:49] going to be walking like Enoch walked
[31:51] with the word we are living at the last
[31:54] hour by the grace of almighty God by his
[31:57] help to his people that might look
[31:59] forward to the soon appearing of Christ
[32:00] how long but brandham maybe 20 years
[32:03] maybe in 50 years maybe in a 100 years I
[32:06] don't know but maybe in the morning
[32:09] maybe tonight I don't know anybody that
[32:11] says they do know they're wrong they
[32:12] won't know God only knows H could we say
[32:16] amen amen so he said now from a little
[32:18] group of the true seed of the word God
[32:21] will present Christ a beloved
[32:24] bride oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[32:28] am praise His wonderful name from a true
[32:32] seed of his
[32:35] word glory to
[32:39] godes
[32:42] Hallelujah God will present Christ a
[32:44] beloved bride a version of his word and
[32:47] through them and by them will be
[32:49] fulfilled all that have been promised
[32:53] isn't that right the Word of Promise in
[32:55] himself like it was in Mary okay here we
[32:58] go God himself made manifest that was
[33:01] the promise the promise as what God to
[33:04] be made manifest he will act himself by
[33:09] his own Word of Promise no man have to
[33:11] make himself God God will act himself to
[33:15] fulfill his very promise so so watch
[33:18] watch he will act himself by his own
[33:21] Word of Promise so to fulfill what has
[33:24] been written of him oh blessed be the
[33:26] name of of the Lord blessed be the His
[33:29] holy name so you don't have to worry and
[33:31] fuss God will act himself you don't have
[33:33] to work up anything manufacture anything
[33:36] God will act himself oh praise the name
[33:39] of the Lord hallelujah so this is some
[33:41] TS from the meetings praise God but the
[33:44] country brother SP Enoch walked with God
[33:46] he walked with the word he walked with
[33:49] the mechanics and then the mechanics
[33:51] turn dynamics that means that we can
[33:53] walk with the mechanics and walk with
[33:56] God Amen while waiting on the spirit
[33:58] which is the Dynamics we have authority
[34:00] to walk with the mechanics there's a
[34:02] word for you to walk with isn't that
[34:04] right hallelujah praise God and bu read
[34:08] a scripture considering the Good
[34:09] Shepherd feeding the sheep and so on and
[34:12] we have a charge as pastors to Serve and
[34:15] Protect the Sheep yes not not not govern
[34:18] them and rule them and and be like the
[34:19] Gentile toing over them no Serve and
[34:22] Protect isn't that right God want
[34:25] pastors to trade his children in the way
[34:28] of God that's what the people come to
[34:30] church for to be trained I am not here
[34:33] to confirm your dream I'm not here to
[34:35] confirm your thoughts I'm not here to
[34:38] yeah boy you Pastor say that and there a
[34:39] confirmation to me like you are the
[34:41] object of what the pastor come to do
[34:42] that's not what it's about that's what
[34:44] we have in trining that bunch of
[34:46] disrespectful people looking there for
[34:48] for the pastor to confirm them that's
[34:50] not what it is about that is foolishness
[34:53] that is off the word we're not here for
[34:54] that we're here to bring the word that
[34:56] that you could benefit from that I don't
[34:59] care what you dream what Vision what
[35:01] inspiration I have nothing to do with
[35:03] that all I have to do is to bring the
[35:04] word to you amen oh pray could somebody
[35:07] say amen
[35:09] hallelujah so God did not tell the
[35:11] pastors to put their Spirit on the
[35:13] people the ministers the pastors the
[35:16] elders are to point the people to the
[35:18] Holy Ghost to receiving the Holy Ghost
[35:21] what has taken place in this message is
[35:23] that pastors and ministers put their
[35:25] fights and personal Warfare on the
[35:27] people so the people now car the fight
[35:30] and behavior and the people now have
[35:32] become evil bad behav bad attitudes
[35:34] hateful and you can't even talk about
[35:36] the life you no longer need a life all
[35:38] you need is a confession of what the
[35:40] church believe oh praise the G of the
[35:43] Lord look how dangerous has become one
[35:45] brother in Africa there he with his
[35:47] false Doctrine you are the Holy Ghost
[35:49] reach so far as to tell the people is
[35:52] either you make a choice either you are
[35:53] the holy ghost or you're the devil pick
[35:55] one
[35:58] that's a sticky one not for me but
[36:01] that's all foolish it that they come
[36:03] what what are you the holy ghost or a
[36:04] devil so what was Peter before he got
[36:06] the Holy
[36:11] Ghost Peter was a
[36:13] Believer just like you and I believ in
[36:16] the promise of God waiting on the
[36:18] promise of God isn't that right isn't
[36:20] that right so what was okay okay so let
[36:23] let's go a little bit now but Bram
[36:27] as I speaking about Peter this is what I
[36:29] shared in the message about set in order
[36:31] for faith in the substance this was a
[36:33] BMB B said look at Peter when he was
[36:36] walking by he was Mortal he was born of
[36:39] sinful flesh just like you and I but the
[36:41] people here we go had need of a Healer
[36:44] so they sent God sent Peter to do that
[36:49] specific
[36:50] work uhhuh John was love Peter didn't
[36:55] have the love in his heart that John had
[36:58] John was God agency of love that's a
[37:02] bomb they were both adopted Apostle hear
[37:05] this look here he taking Peter James and
[37:07] John hope faith and charity do you see
[37:09] it those gifted people them Tre hope
[37:12] faith and charity Hope was in James he
[37:15] was the one who set theis in order Faith
[37:17] was in Peter and charity was in John
[37:19] hope faith and charity and they were
[37:21] God's representative on the earth and
[37:24] the people laid in Peter's Shadow and
[37:26] were healed amen so that is why you
[37:28] can't judge and compare this ministry
[37:30] with that Ministry with that Ministry
[37:33] and that Ministry and you pre for this
[37:34] one than that one because God have their
[37:36] gifts that will find their places and
[37:38] their position in the word and all
[37:41] together will glorify God could we give
[37:44] a lord a
[37:45] shout in the house so God knew the
[37:49] people need healing and Peter had a big
[37:51] kind of faith and you could see it in
[37:53] his track record even before he had the
[37:55] Holy Ghost because when
[37:57] Jesus was walking in the Water Peter
[37:58] said Lord if there is you bid me to
[38:01] come only Peter could talk like that
[38:04] because Peter had that kind of faith and
[38:06] Peter begin to walk without the Holy
[38:09] Ghost you're not hearing what I'm saying
[38:11] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[38:15] so now in these offices okay now okay
[38:19] let's continue uh they are chosen these
[38:23] offices they are chosen by God apostles
[38:26] prophets to so if God pick somebody who
[38:29] is not who could unpick
[38:32] them Dev voted in Matias and Matias did
[38:34] nothing there's no book of Matias
[38:36] writing of Matias Epistle of Matias
[38:38] Matias was just picked voted in but God
[38:40] picks Paul a hook know Jew that wasn't
[38:43] among the bunch and he had to come and
[38:45] say if all you think all yourself is a
[38:47] spiritual acknowledge I am a prophet and
[38:50] if all you don't know that all all on
[38:52] your own all you ignorant stay ignorant
[38:55] but I have been sent
[38:57] Paul an apostle to the Gentiles an
[38:59] apostle of Jesus Christ
[39:03] Fearless even Peter to back down when
[39:05] Paul Come Hallelujah Paul is God's man
[39:08] on the earth God's star in his right
[39:11] hand hallelujah oh glory to God Amen
[39:16] okay so watch teachers evangelist
[39:20] pastors five spiritual offices in the
[39:21] church to set the church in order
[39:24] Apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[39:26] those those are called offices of God
[39:29] then in the local congregation there are
[39:31] nine spiritual gifts that work among the
[39:33] people now in these offices places in
[39:36] the offices you hear from the Apostle
[39:39] like in India they ask me if we're going
[39:40] to get a universal Pastor I said no then
[39:42] you get a universal pontiff or Pope and
[39:44] that's what people want them Pol them
[39:46] politicians in the message these um
[39:48] these these political spiritual
[39:50] politicians right so so God not going to
[39:52] have that the perfecting will come where
[39:54] you hear from the pastor yes you hear
[39:57] from the Apostle you hear from the
[39:59] prophet that you hearing and what they
[40:01] teaching and preaching because brotheru
[40:02] CT it off that right now we are doing
[40:04] the work we doing the work of the
[40:06] ministry until we are approved in that
[40:08] work we have to be doing the work right
[40:10] now is not man perfecting you when they
[40:12] said the fightful ministry is for the
[40:13] Perfection of the it's not men
[40:15] perfecting you you have to be with this
[40:16] man you have to be in this church you
[40:18] have to be this particular group it's
[40:19] not that it's the word doing the
[40:21] Perfection it's Christ doing the
[40:23] Perfection isn't that right and the
[40:25] prophet even say going to hand those
[40:27] love gifts even just before the wedding

[48:29] afterward praise God so Ezekiel
[48:33] 9
[48:37] amen
[48:40] hallelujah
[48:42] okay Ezekiel 9 reading from veres 1 to
[48:44] verse 6 amen he said and it says he
[48:47] cried also in my ears with a loud voice
[48:49] saying cause them that have charge over
[48:51] the city to draw near even every man
[48:54] with his destroying weapon in his hand
[48:56] and behold six men came from the way of
[48:59] the higher gate which lie towards the
[49:01] North and every man a Slaughter weapon
[49:03] in his hand and one man among them was
[49:06] clothed with linen with an incor right a
[49:08] writers incor by his side and they went
[49:10] in and Stood Beside the bracing Altar
[49:12] and the glory of the of of the god of
[49:15] Israel was gone up from the Cherub where
[49:17] upon he was to the threshold of the
[49:19] house and he called to the man clothed
[49:21] with linen which had the ink on writer
[49:23] uh writers ink on by his side and the
[49:25] Lord said unto him go through the midst
[49:27] of the city through the midst of
[49:29] Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[49:32] foreheads of men that sigh and cry for
[49:36] the for all the Abominations that be
[49:37] done in the midst thereof that's Mercy
[49:40] going forth first isn't that right and
[49:43] then verse 5 says unto the others he
[49:45] said in my hearing go ye after him
[49:47] through the city and smite let not your
[49:50] eye spare neither have ye pity slay
[49:53] utterly old and young both maids and
[49:56] little children and women but come not
[50:00] near any man upon whom is the mark and
[50:02] begin at My Sanctuary then they began at
[50:04] the ancient men which were before the
[50:06] house and turning over now to Revelation
[50:08] chapter 7 uh we just read the first
[50:10] three verses there praise God and then
[50:12] we'll uh say a word of prayer amen
[50:17] Revelation chapter
[50:18] 7 verse one it says and after these
[50:22] things I saw four Angels standing on the
[50:24] four corners of the Earth holding the
[50:27] Four Winds of the earth that the wind
[50:29] should not blow on the earth nor on the
[50:32] sea nor on any tree and I saw another
[50:35] Angel ascending from the East having the
[50:38] Seal of the Living God and he cried with
[50:40] a loud voice to the four angels to whom
[50:43] it was given to hurt the sea to HT to
[50:45] hurt the earth and the Sea saying hurt
[50:47] not the Earth neither the sea nor the
[50:50] trees till we have sealed the Servants
[50:52] of God in their foreheads amen amen may
[50:55] God have blessing to the Ring of his
[50:57] word let's just bow our heads as we uh
[51:00] say with a prayer Heavenly Father Lord
[51:03] the scriptures have been read this

[1:06:30] and where it stopped they stopped and
[1:06:33] them priests watched it and whenever it
[1:06:35] moved they sounded the trumpets if it
[1:06:38] was midnight 3:00 in the morning 12:00
[1:06:40] noon he said they all packed and went
[1:06:43] packed and away they
[1:06:45] went they uh followed the pillar fire am
[1:06:49] they kept in the will of the Lord by
[1:06:51] doing so oh how beautiful he said if
[1:06:54] they ever lost that Pillar of Fire in
[1:06:56] the New Testament he said uh I mean in
[1:06:58] our age he said through 1500 years of
[1:07:01] Dark Ages he said they failed to see it
[1:07:04] but there was a fellow One Day by the
[1:07:06] name of Martin Luther and he saw the
[1:07:09] pillar of fire and away he went on the
[1:07:11] First Reformation you see you have to
[1:07:13] follow this Pillar of Fire wherever it's
[1:07:16] leading you've got to go praise God we
[1:07:18] are in the army of the Lord this morning
[1:07:20] and if they wake us up at 0500 hours
[1:07:22] we've got to move got to run and if we
[1:07:25] don't run we get left behind praise God
[1:07:27] isn't that right so keep on running this
[1:07:29] morning we're running away from the
[1:07:31] world and we are running into Christ we
[1:07:33] are running away from the the Earth and
[1:07:36] running into Rapture into Glory praise
[1:07:39] God Amen isn't that right so here he
[1:07:41] talks about Martin Luther says he saw a
[1:07:44] pill of fire and away he went on the
[1:07:46] First Reformation he said but you know
[1:07:48] what he organized his church so tight it
[1:07:51] begin to be it was only the Lutheran
[1:07:53] Church you was either Lutheran or you
[1:07:55] wasn't it and the pillar of Fire won't
[1:07:57] hang over nothing like
[1:07:59] that oh so you mean there's no it
[1:08:04] group we are it you are not it the
[1:08:07] pillar of Fire by bam said won't hang
[1:08:10] over that he don't want no association
[1:08:13] with that you are not it the pillar of
[1:08:15] fire is it if you follow the pillar of
[1:08:18] fire you be all right if you are it then
[1:08:21] you stay with your it but it may not
[1:08:23] make it into the Rapture it may not make
[1:08:25] it into the wedding supper but if you
[1:08:27] pull it a fill of fire oh Hallelujah he
[1:08:29] will lead you out in out of this Pilgrim
[1:08:33] [Applause]
[1:08:34] Landen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:37] hallelujah praise God amen
[1:08:40] amen something huh amen said if he
[1:08:43] wasn't it see pillar Fire won't hang
[1:08:45] over nothing like that so away it went
[1:08:48] and Luther couldn't follow it because he
[1:08:50] uh Luther had been uh dead for years and
[1:08:53] another round of Servants of Apostles of
[1:08:55] the church and another round another
[1:08:56] round and it just got weakened just like
[1:08:58] the disciples okay and then the pillar
[1:08:59] of fire moved away from the Lutheran
[1:09:01] Church Luther couldn't go because he had
[1:09:03] all of his rituals and everything wrote
[1:09:05] up and then there was a little fellow by
[1:09:07] name of John Wesley in England and he
[1:09:09] saw it and away he went and he had a
[1:09:12] Revival that saved England us and the
[1:09:15] United States and the and English Known
[1:09:17] World in that day isn't that right
[1:09:19] praise God hallelujah they had a great
[1:09:20] Revival but then the first thing you
[1:09:21] know they got so organized down till
[1:09:23] they begin to get after a few rounds
[1:09:25] just cold tchy as they could be that's
[1:09:27] right the pillar of Fire won't hang over
[1:09:29] that so away it went and a bunch of
[1:09:31] people called Pentecostal seen it and
[1:09:33] away they went after it hey isn't that
[1:09:36] right receive the Holy Ghost and then
[1:09:38] they built them a church order but you
[1:09:40] know the sad part the Pentecost is so
[1:09:42] organized that the pillar of fire move
[1:09:43] out again and they can't go that's right
[1:09:46] the pillar of fire is moving anyhow oh
[1:09:49] isn't that right God said it would
[1:09:52] that's right they had the sign of the
[1:09:53] Fire by night and Cloud by day that led
[1:09:55] them he said now tonight here in God's
[1:09:58] house where that same Pillar of Fire Hal
[1:10:02] is here in the house here right now cuz
[1:10:04] it was the angel of the Covenant the
[1:10:06] Lord Jesus Christ and when he died he
[1:10:09] rose again and he lives forever more he
[1:10:12] promised the things that he did we will
[1:10:14] do also isn't that right and greater for
[1:10:19] he went unto the father he said if I not
[1:10:21] go the comforter cannot come I have to
[1:10:24] leave this form and come in another form
[1:10:27] which is the holy spirit which is the
[1:10:29] watering spirit that brother Bram talk
[1:10:31] about in spoken with the original seed
[1:10:33] to water the seed that was in your soul
[1:10:36] to bring forth another Revival to bring
[1:10:38] forth a manifestation of what the
[1:10:40] prophets

[1:13:35] Jesus and they started talk something
[1:13:37] about Jesus and he started to do some
[1:13:41] things and Jesus could have argued the
[1:13:43] point he could have made his point valid
[1:13:45] he could have came and and made a whole
[1:13:46] scene of it but he chose to move away
[1:13:48] the Bible said he had another business
[1:13:50] to tend to the Bible said he had needs
[1:13:53] pass through Samaria so he left these
[1:13:56] men and their confusion and he went up
[1:13:58] to Samaria he was traveling north but he
[1:14:00] had to pass through Samaria because
[1:14:02] there was somebody there that he had to
[1:14:04] talk to there was somebody there that he
[1:14:07] had to meet oh Hallelujah she had an
[1:14:10] appointment he had an appointment that

[1:24:35] that right but BR speaking I love this
[1:24:38] part he said when God created me William
[1:24:40] brandham he said I was before the
[1:24:43] foundational world he made my being my
[1:24:46] spirit he said I wasn't conscious of
[1:24:49] anything as far as I know of but he said
[1:24:51] I was there yeah and he said he said oh
[1:24:54] I don't believe you're getting it oh H
[1:24:56] he said but now just wait a minute he
[1:24:57] said Jesus told the disciples that he
[1:24:59] knew them before the foundation of the
[1:25:02] world isn't that right hallelujah
[1:25:05] hallelujah when you under the Fig Tree
[1:25:07] hallelujah amen isn't that right Phillip
[1:25:08] I called you I done already hallelujah
[1:25:11] praise God seeing you Amen in the book
[1:25:13] isn't that right Jesus said and he said
[1:25:16] Paul said there that he chose us in him
[1:25:18] before the world began isn't that right
[1:25:21] he said there was some part of me or
[1:25:24] never and the rest of you all here that
[1:25:26] is in Jesus Christ before the world ever
[1:25:29] began amen he say and here's to my
[1:25:32] analysis of that he said he said and I
[1:25:35] think that people that the people today
[1:25:36] are possessed with this Spirit or the
[1:25:39] spirit a part of these Angelic beings
[1:25:43] which are spirits okay let me read that
[1:25:45] back again I don't want you to miss it
[1:25:48] he said and here's to my analysis of
[1:25:49] that he said I think that the people
[1:25:52] today that are possessed with this
[1:25:55] spirit amen isn't that right yes sir or
[1:25:58] or or the spirit are part of these
[1:26:01] Angelic
[1:26:02] beings Spirits which rotated off of
[1:26:06] God do you know who you are now you are
[1:26:09] not just anybody but you are Angelic
[1:26:12] being a spirit that rotated off of God
[1:26:15] that's why when you heard the message
[1:26:18] something inside of you connect
[1:26:20] something inside of you connect you
[1:26:22] can't help but say Amen because your
[1:26:25] spirit bear witness with that spirit
[1:26:28] that you are the Son of God praise God
[1:26:31] hallelujah hallelujah oh hle what can
[1:26:35] separate us from the love of God that is
[1:26:38] in Christ Jesus he said I'm my father
[1:26:40] and one at that day you shall know I am
[1:26:43] in the father he in me and I in you and
[1:26:47] you in me oh hallelujah
[1:26:51] hallelujah
[1:26:52] oh Hallelujah that's why we can have
[1:26:56] faith for the Holy Ghost because if we
[1:26:58] look at ourselves we can never have
[1:26:59] faith we have too much fallings we have
[1:27:02] too much shortcomings we made so much
[1:27:03] mistakes we've done so much sin and we
[1:27:06] feel like we can't talk to God but if
[1:27:08] ever you get back connected to your real
[1:27:11] father I'm not talking about your
[1:27:13] Earthly connections no no no I'm talking
[1:27:15] about your spirit that rotated off of
[1:27:18] Elohim from before the beginning that
[1:27:21] same spirit that Drew his sword and
[1:27:24] fought with the
[1:27:25] dragon that same spirit that kicked
[1:27:28] Lucifer out of heaven when you connect
[1:27:31] back to that same Spirit then you could
[1:27:34] call for fire in your life because that
[1:27:36] fire belongs to

[1:49:46] to come and if he caught her with that
[1:49:48] one coin out she was a holl at
[1:49:50] brother we the Church of the Living God
[1:49:52] in these great hours that we're now
[1:49:53] living in he said it behooves us to
[1:49:56] check up go before God light the candle
[1:49:59] of the word of the gospel and examine
[1:50:02] ourselves and find out if we're not
[1:50:04] falling short and especially when we see
[1:50:06] all these things coming we are at the
[1:50:08] end time the coming of Christ is at hand
[1:50:11] there's not another hope in the world
[1:50:13] for the church oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:50:16] hallelujah isn't that right he said and
[1:50:18] look the church is loling the church has
[1:50:20] no conscience anymore you can hardly
[1:50:22] wake them up the Bible said they would
[1:50:24] come in that condition when they would
[1:50:26] say low or law delays is coming and
[1:50:30] they'll be devouring and biting one
[1:50:31] another and so forth and fighting around
[1:50:33] it's just exactly that hour everything's
[1:50:36] ready he said the pages are turned and
[1:50:38] as it was like that it's ready for the
[1:50:40] coming of the Lord oh Hallelujah isn't
[1:50:43] that right and down in maraval I was
[1:50:45] preaching and we was talking about
[1:50:47] Ezekiel 8 and how God had seen the the
[1:50:50] secret things that Jerusalem was doing
[1:50:52] isn't that right and if you go through
[1:50:53] it I may not have time to go through it
[1:50:55] but the Holy Spirit took Ezekiel up into
[1:50:58] another realm into a vision realm it was
[1:51:01] between Heaven and Earth Ezekiel said
[1:51:03] where he could see all that God was
[1:51:04] seeing and God took him up into a place
[1:51:07] and showed him a hole and told Ezekiel
[1:51:09] dig the hole and he will see a door and
[1:51:12] when he saw the door the God told
[1:51:14] Ezekiel open the door and you will see
[1:51:16] all the Abominations and I began to
[1:51:18] think to myself look at what God had to
[1:51:21] do to show Ezekiel all the hidden things
[1:51:24] that were being done in the city God had
[1:51:27] to take him through a hole take him
[1:51:29] through a door to see things that God
[1:51:31] had already seen amen isn't that right
[1:51:34] so people coming to church and hiding
[1:51:37] but they don't know that God has already
[1:51:38] seen you God is seeing what you are
[1:51:41] doing praise God he's seeing your
[1:51:43] attitude he's seeing what approach you
[1:51:46] having to the gospel he's seeing how
[1:51:48] you're praying he's seeing if you are
[1:51:50] searching for God he is seeing if you
[1:51:52] are really genuine about this gospel
[1:51:54] that we are preaching he wants to know
[1:51:57] what is in your heart he wants to know
[1:51:59] that you are making things right that
[1:52:00] you are doing all that you could do to
[1:52:03] be ready when he comes isn't that right
[1:52:06] he said oh while I come quickly and my
[1:52:08] reward is with me to do what to give
[1:52:10] every man as his work shall be isn't
[1:52:14] that right oh hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:52:18] so you'll be rewarded according to your
[1:52:20] work isn't that right okay amen going to
[1:52:22] wrongs up said now when I was here the
[1:52:24] other time I tried to tell you um God's
[1:52:28] confirming the word with signs wonders
[1:52:29] and miracles and so forth okay I'll skip
[1:52:31] back back here now he said um he said
[1:52:34] now look at the age we're living in you
[1:52:35] know he said now to my opinion this is
[1:52:37] the age of the Turning time it's a time
[1:52:41] when men are either will come into the
[1:52:43] kingdom of God or be sealed out of the
[1:52:46] kingdom of God Amen he said and I
[1:52:48] believe that the Antichrist seals a
[1:52:50] person he said we're taught in the
[1:52:52] scriptures in the Book of Revelation If
[1:52:54] any man receives his seal or his Mark or
[1:52:57] the letter of his name and so forth is
[1:52:59] doomed is sealed out of the kingdom of
[1:53:02] God and the spirit of Christ come on now
[1:53:05] when Once sealed with that you are
[1:53:07] sealed into the kingdom of God Amen oh
[1:53:12] that's what I want this morning not to
[1:53:14] be sealed out but to be sealed in to the
[1:53:17] kingdom of God Hallelujah isn't that
[1:53:21] right when Noah and all of his family
[1:53:23] went into the ark the door was shut at
[1:53:26] the shutting of the door they were
[1:53:27] sealed in the world and everything else
[1:53:30] outside was sealed out the animals were
[1:53:32] in everything were packed in and ready
[1:53:35] there was no more names to be called
[1:53:36] that was it judgment was set Hallelujah
[1:53:40] and all who were in was in and all who
[1:53:42] was out was out isn't that right what
[1:53:44] does that mean filthy filthy still holy
[1:53:47] holy still there is coming that time
[1:53:49] friends
[1:53:50] where the tide will turn over to the
[1:53:52] Jews and where there no more blood left
[1:53:54] for the Gentiles but before that time
[1:53:57] make sure this morning that you are
[1:53:59] sealed in oh H make sure that you are
[1:54:02] sealed into the kingdom of God by the
[1:54:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire in
[1:54:07] your heart and in your life that you are
[1:54:09] applying this token that you are living
[1:54:12] praise God as life of Jesus Christ oh
[1:54:14] Hallelujah that we are so earnestly
[1:54:16] contending for this morning amen
[1:54:18] hallelujah
[1:54:21] hallelujah it's not about playing Church
[1:54:24] Hallelujah but it's being being real
[1:54:25] with God Hal being real sincere in your
[1:54:28] heart one time one a man came up to
[1:54:30] brother brandham and he said brother
[1:54:32] brandham they told me to come and talk
[1:54:33] to you brother Bram said what's what's
[1:54:34] wrong so the man said well I wanted to
[1:54:37] receive Christ in my heart he said and I
[1:54:39] used to go to church with my wife and so
[1:54:41] on and he said but I wanted to receive
[1:54:43] God in my heart and I didn't know how he
[1:54:45] said and I saw a piece of paper written
[1:54:48] somewhere about uh where will you spend
[1:54:49] eternity and he said right there the man
[1:54:52] he got a conviction and he decided he
[1:54:54] wanted to serve the Lord and he said he
[1:54:56] was wealthy he had money he said he
[1:54:58] started to sell out his business and his
[1:55:00] cars and he just wanted to know God's
[1:55:02] will for his life and he said he went to
[1:55:04] them Beth his church and the Methodist
[1:55:06] Church told him do this thing and you'll
[1:55:07] be all right and he did it but he wasn't
[1:55:09] satisfied he went to the Baptist Church
[1:55:11] he went to this church he went to that
[1:55:13] church and he still wasn't satisfying
[1:55:15] and the brother brother said I come to
[1:55:17] you brother Brandon because I don't have
[1:55:18] an answer I want to find Christ and and
[1:55:21] brother brandham said listen let's go
[1:55:23] back to the story let's go back to the
[1:55:25] beginning of the story he said what made
[1:55:27] you want to serve God he said well I
[1:55:29] looked at a piece of paper he said that
[1:55:31] was it he said right there something in
[1:55:34] your heart begin to ask a question
[1:55:35] hallah and right there you started
[1:55:38] searching for God he said it doesn't
[1:55:40] matter what church you go to it doesn't
[1:55:41] matter how much you jump doesn't matter
[1:55:43] how much you shout praise God but it's
[1:55:45] the life it's the it's the praise God
[1:55:47] it's that thing in your heart that's
[1:55:50] crying out for a reality he said that's
[1:55:52] the thing that is connecting to God not
[1:55:55] the tithes you pay come on now that's
[1:55:58] fine that's all right all that is church
[1:56:00] order Hallelujah but more than that
[1:56:02] there's a deeper desire within to want
[1:56:05] to know God to want to be with God to
[1:56:09] want to have that seal that Mark of the
[1:56:11] Holy Ghost in your life to want to have
[1:56:14] that witness of his Spirit oh H where he
[1:56:17] go you go where he lead you follow
[1:56:20] that's what we want this morning Enoch
[1:56:23] walked with God and was not but God took
[1:56:25] him and he had a testimony that he
[1:56:28] pleased God not his mother not his
[1:56:32] father but it was about God what he was
[1:56:34] doing for the kingdom isn't that right
[1:56:37] oh my my my Hallelujah GL amen praise
[1:56:41] God he said now if you come tonight uh
[1:56:44] this is on manifestation of the spirit
[1:56:46] okay um he said uh he said no if I come
[1:56:49] to you tonight listen closely if I come
[1:56:51] to you tonight and said I had the spirit
[1:56:53] of a criminal John Dillinger and John
[1:56:55] Dillinger spirit is on me he said you'd
[1:56:57] expect me to have big guns and be a big
[1:56:59] Outlaw like he was and if I had his
[1:57:01] Spirit that's what I would do he said
[1:57:03] you know God never takes his Spirit from
[1:57:05] the earth God takes his man but never
[1:57:08] his Spirit he said do you know what say
[1:57:11] for he took Elijah a double portion of
[1:57:13] Elijah's Spirit come upon Elisha is that
[1:57:16] right and several hundred years later he
[1:57:18] come out in John the Baptist Same Spirit
[1:57:21] isn't that right and it's predicted to
[1:57:23] come out in the last day is that right
[1:57:25] God takes his man but not his Spirit his
[1:57:28] Spirit remains here and when his when
[1:57:31] the spirit's gone the church is gone
[1:57:33] then he said then there be no more
[1:57:34] salvation no more care Mercy's over then
[1:57:38] the spirit's gone he said the Holy
[1:57:40] Spirit was upon the apostles that was
[1:57:42] upon the apostles is here tonight that
[1:57:45] same Holy Spirit God takes his man but
[1:57:48] never his spirit amen musicians could
[1:57:51] begin to come now if I told you I had
[1:57:53] the spirit of this famous Outlaw uh
[1:57:55] you'd expect me to act like him to be
[1:57:57] anointed like him and if I told you I
[1:57:59] had the spirit of some famous artist
[1:58:01] you'd expect me to stretch the canas out
[1:58:02] here and catch waves of the ocean and
[1:58:04] things like that he said if I had a
[1:58:06] spirit and if I confess to have the
[1:58:08] spirit of
[1:58:09] Jesus on us then we should do the things
[1:58:13] that Jesus did Jesus said he could do
[1:58:16] nothing but what the father showed him
[1:58:18] amen isn't that
[1:58:20] he said now when the angel of the Lord
[1:58:21] appeared to Moses it wasn't Moses it was
[1:58:23] the angel of God and when he when he
[1:58:26] appeared uh what was he when he appeared
[1:58:29] a pill of fire isn't that right and he
[1:58:31] led the children of Israel and any
[1:58:33] scholar knows that that was the angel of
[1:58:35] the Covenant which is Christ isn't that

[1:59:33] dress out of calco or pattern or
[1:59:35] something he said and you spread out a
[1:59:36] big piece of calco and cut it out he
[1:59:38] said it's your business where you lay
[1:59:40] the pattern and it's God's business
[1:59:42] where he lays the pattern he cuts her

[2:00:03] God foreordained that ordains his church
[2:00:06] and he takes his church out and a

[2:00:40] denominations are or kick to the
[2:00:42] sideline isn't that right Revelation 9th
[2:00:44] chapter he said and it was commanded
[2:00:47] that it should not hurt the grass or the
[2:00:48] trees neither any green thing neither
[2:00:51] any tree but those men which have not
[2:00:53] the Seal of God in their forehead he
[2:00:55] said when the plagues was coming only
[2:00:57] thing that was protected was those who
[2:00:59] were sealed away into the kingdom of God
[2:01:02] he said this is the investigating
[2:01:04] judgment when men and if God help me he
[2:01:07] said uh with the word of the Lord that
[2:01:09] is at the time of the sealing of the
[2:01:11] plagues and those things who rejected
[2:01:13] there's nothing left but Eternal
[2:01:15] punishment amen amen hallelujah do you
[2:01:18] love him begin to play something softly
[2:01:21] Hallelujah I'll end this off here with

[2:01:31] he'll go out and set so much here and so
[2:01:33] much there the inspector comes by he
[2:01:36] looks in he said and if this is a little
[2:01:38] loose it shakes nope he said I won't
[2:01:41] seal it got to tear it out and do it
[2:01:43] over again next thing he'll do is try to
[2:01:46] load it again he'll get this wrong the
[2:01:48] in Spector will come by wrong do it over
[2:01:51] again and that's what God has been doing
[2:01:54] with his church for a long time you load
[2:01:57] up and you're going to heaven you're
[2:01:59] taking everything with you your card
[2:02:01] games huh every other thing that you can
[2:02:03] load into the church you're trying to
[2:02:04] take it with you God just condemns it
[2:02:07] ain't ready for sealing but when God
[2:02:10] sees a man contr broken Spirit sincere
[2:02:14] in heart down at the altar God closes
[2:02:18] the door of the world to him and seals
[2:02:21] him in there by the baptism of the Holy
[2:02:24] Ghost Hallelujah and it lasts until
