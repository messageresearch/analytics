[1:07:28] the snow from heaven and returneth not
[1:07:30] thither but water it and make it it
[1:07:33] bring foot and but that it may give see
[1:07:35] to the sower and bread to the eater so
[1:07:38] shall my word be that goeth forth out of
[1:07:41] my mouth it shall not return unto me
[1:07:44] void but it shall accomplish that which
[1:07:47] I please and it shall prosper in the
[1:07:50] thing whereto I sent it and reading
[1:07:52] Malachi chapter 3 and reading of his six
[1:07:57] malachite up to three and reading verse
[1:08:00] six for I am the Lord and I change not
[1:08:05] and reading Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ
[1:08:09] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:08:13] middle or add a blessing to the reading
[1:08:16] of his word you may be seated in the
[1:08:19] presence of the Lord this morning
[1:08:22] amen and I have a title this morning the
[1:08:26] thoughts of God a subject I am Lord and
[1:08:31] I change not and an inspiration breaking
[1:08:35] the silence and I call it an a character
[1:08:38] Peter I want to touch on it a little bit
[1:08:42] this morning so the title of thoughts of
[1:08:44] God subject I am the Lord and I change
[1:08:48] not and inspiration breaking the silence
[1:08:51] and a character Peter and we read the
[1:08:55] scripture in Isaiah where God is saying
[1:08:57] for my thoughts and not your thoughts
[1:09:00] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[1:09:03] Lord and he makes a clear distinction
[1:09:06] about the way he thinks
[1:09:08] and the way that we think and we all
[1:09:11] have our thoughts we have our own
[1:09:13] thoughts about ourselves we have our
[1:09:15] thoughts about our ambitions we have our
[1:09:17] thoughts of what we'd like to do and
[1:09:19] what we would like to be and what we'd
[1:09:21] like to accomplish we have our thoughts
[1:09:23] and the economy we have our thoughts on
[1:09:26] what's happening in our neighborhood we
[1:09:28] have our thoughts with what's happening
[1:09:30] with our family we have our thoughts
[1:09:31] with what's happening with the economy
[1:09:33] we have our thoughts with everything and
[1:09:35] God also has his thoughts he has
[1:09:37] thoughts about nature the way nature
[1:09:40] should be here thoughts about how
[1:09:42] animals should operate he has thoughts
[1:09:44] about plant life he has thoughts about
[1:09:46] his family he has thoughts about his
[1:09:49] legacy he has thoughts about reproducing
[1:09:52] himself he has thoughts about how this
[1:09:55] world is how it was and how it will be
[1:09:57] here sports that are from the past what
[1:10:00] we call past present and future
[1:10:01] that's all in his thoughts and the
[1:10:04] challenges his thoughts are so far above
[1:10:06] our thoughts that just a glimpse into
[1:10:09] his world makes our world a different
[1:10:11] place because we are limited in our
[1:10:14] thinking we are limited in our efforts
[1:10:16] we are limited in our abilities if we
[1:10:19] stand on our own but when we stand on
[1:10:21] his word and we connect his thoughts it
[1:10:24] changes our existence completely so this
[1:10:29] morning I want to talk about the
[1:10:30] thoughts of God because before you can
[1:10:33] express a word
[1:10:34] you have to have thought it before you
[1:10:36] could speak it so before God could have
[1:10:38] said let there be light he had to have
[1:10:40] thought about the light before he could
[1:10:43] say led to be a son he had to think
[1:10:45] about the son and what the son would do
[1:10:47] and the role that it would play and
[1:10:49] before God could say let there be
[1:10:51] animals he had thoughts about the
[1:10:53] animals and before calkins here let us
[1:10:55] make man he had to have thoughts about
[1:10:58] that man and before God could put the
[1:11:00] garden of Weeden and please he had to
[1:11:02] have thoughts about what was supposed to
[1:11:04] happen and whenever God spoke it was the
[1:11:07] expression of his pots and when man tell
[1:11:10] God didn't stop thinking when you made a
[1:11:14] mistake or didn't stop thinking he is
[1:11:17] always thinking he has always been
[1:11:20] thinking and brother branham said his
[1:11:22] thoughts are eternal we could forget
[1:11:25] something that we thought about the
[1:11:28] Bible says that there was a king and he
[1:11:30] had a dream and he forgot his dream and
[1:11:32] he said listen I forgot the dream and
[1:11:34] but it was a troubling dream and he
[1:11:36] forgot about it he said I needed to
[1:11:38] remember the dream and give me the
[1:11:40] interpretation and if you cannot
[1:11:42] remember the dream and give me the
[1:11:44] interpretation I'm gonna cut your head
[1:11:45] off that's the nature of man we cannot
[1:11:48] remember everything we cannot keep
[1:11:51] everything in our minds but the mind of
[1:11:54] God is different he cannot forget
[1:12:01] his thoughts are eternal he cannot have
[1:12:04] thought about you and forgot that he
[1:12:06] thought about you he cannot have thought
[1:12:09] about calling you and forgot that he
[1:12:11] called you he cannot progestin ate you
[1:12:14] and forget that he did retest innate in
[1:12:16] you he cannot die for you and forgot who
[1:12:20] he died for because when he was walking
[1:12:22] to Calvary you were on his mind when he
[1:12:27] was being beaten by the whip you were on
[1:12:30] his mind
[1:12:31] you were his thinking and this morning
[1:12:34] you are the very expression of the
[1:12:37] thoughts of God everything you see
[1:12:40] around you is as a result of the
[1:12:42] expression of the thoughts of God the
[1:12:45] trees that you see an expression of the
[1:12:49] thoughts of God the animals you see are
[1:12:52] an expression of the thoughts of God if
[1:12:55] you ever want to wonder about if God is
[1:12:57] real just look up at the heavens look up
[1:13:00] at the stars look at the Sun look at the
[1:13:04] moon
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:09] the thoughts of God hallelujah and his
[1:13:14] thoughts I eternal his thoughts cannot
[1:13:16] be destroyed and once his thoughts
[1:13:19] become word it becomes permanent because
[1:13:22] he said for my word cannot return for it
[1:13:25] and it will accomplish that which I
[1:13:28] please there are certain things that
[1:13:31] please God and in order to bring it to
[1:13:34] pass up he has to live by his own law
[1:13:36] because he said I am God and I changed
[1:13:40] not so he cannot change he cannot know
[1:13:43] start to change if he called you and he
[1:13:46] spoke you into existence he cannot even
[1:13:49] change his mind so if God said you gonna
[1:13:56] be healed he cannot even change his mind
[1:13:59] and not only did he think it but he
[1:14:01] already spoke it he already spoke it he
[1:14:05] said I am the God that healeth thee he
[1:14:07] already spoke it
[1:14:12] somebody helped me this morning
[1:14:14] hallelujah somebody help me give God
[1:14:17] praise this morning Oh hallelujah you
[1:14:23] may be seated
[1:14:24] I pray this helps you this morning
[1:14:26] because sometimes you'll even thinking
[1:14:29] about yourself but when you're not
[1:14:30] thinking about yourself he's still
[1:14:32] thinking about you when you don't feel
[1:14:34] good about yourself he's still thinking
[1:14:36] about you
[1:14:37] Gideon was just minding his own business
[1:14:39] and he didn't have no great thoughts
[1:14:42] about himself he wasn't thinking of
[1:14:44] anybody but God walks up to Gideon and
[1:14:47] say Gideon the mighty man of Valor and
[1:14:50] there was a difference between Gideon's
[1:14:52] thinking and God sinking and God had a
[1:14:55] mission to change Gideon's thinking
[1:14:59] because Gideon had power but didn't know
[1:15:02] it
[1:15:03] Gideon was anointed but didn't know it
[1:15:05] Gideon had a prophesy over his head but
[1:15:08] he didn't know it Gideon had a ministry
[1:15:11] but did not know it
[1:15:12] he didn't had a purpose but he did not
[1:15:15] know it but for you to step in to your
[1:15:17] purpose you need to change your thinking
[1:15:19] he did such a thing different so course
[1:15:22] a Gideon the mighty man of Valor and
[1:15:26] Gideon did what we always do you may be
[1:15:29] seated you're talking about me no not me
[1:15:31] I'm not the one that's not how I see
[1:15:34] myself I'm a nobody
[1:15:36] my tribe is the smallest tribe my family
[1:15:40] is the smallest family I'm the smallest
[1:15:42] one in the family I didn't go to school
[1:15:45] I'm not a great place sir I don't pray a
[1:15:48] lot and you have all the reasons why the
[1:15:51] you are not the one that's chosen but
[1:15:54] God said that doesn't matter how you
[1:15:56] think about yourself that's temporary
[1:15:59] what matters is my thoughts concerning
[1:16:02] you
[1:16:08] you may be seated thoughts of God from a
[1:16:21] court brother branham said the
[1:16:22] exposition of seven churches is he said
[1:16:24] the eternal thoughts of God let me ask
[1:16:26] you are the thoughts of God attendants
[1:16:29] he said if you can see this you will see
[1:16:31] many things and this morning I want us
[1:16:34] to see many things he said God is
[1:16:36] unchangeable in both his essence which
[1:16:41] is his Constitution and the behavior we
[1:16:44] have studied that and proven that
[1:16:46] already God is infinite in his abilities
[1:16:49] so therefore he as God must be
[1:16:52] omniscient if he is omniscient then he
[1:16:56] is not now living he already knows it
[1:17:01] he's not now learning there's nothing
[1:17:03] that you could do this morning that
[1:17:04] could surprise him your ups and down is
[1:17:06] not a shock to him he already saw all of
[1:17:09] that and still cause or you don't hear
[1:17:11] me this morning he saw all you I'm gonna
[1:17:14] talk about pizza and still call you and
[1:17:18] still thought about you and still send a
[1:17:21] prophet and still send a word to you
[1:17:24] because you were in his thinking
[1:17:28] if he is omniscient if he is all-knowing
[1:17:32] then he is not not learning no is he
[1:17:35] taking counsel he's not consulting
[1:17:38] anybody about you he's not trying to get
[1:17:40] a recommendation you know in your pi/4
[1:17:43] job you need to bring referrals so that
[1:17:46] somebody can verify you are who you see
[1:17:47] you all you could or how you work in
[1:17:49] your last place of import anybody with
[1:17:52] me
[1:17:53] that's called taken counsel but because
[1:17:55] God is omniscient he is nor is he taking
[1:18:01] counsel even with himself in other words
[1:18:04] he can't second-guess himself he can say
[1:18:07] I know I choose him and I wonder if I
[1:18:09] made the right choice that can't even
[1:18:11] happen
[1:18:14] [Applause]
[1:18:18] but the random said no is he at anytime
[1:18:21] adding to his knowledge so it means
[1:18:25] everything there is to know about you he
[1:18:27] already knows it he cannot add to his
[1:18:32] knowledge he got the prophets words if
[1:18:35] he can add to his knowledge then he is
[1:18:38] not omniscient the best we could see is
[1:18:41] that sometime he will be but that is not
[1:18:43] scriptural he is omniscient he has never
[1:18:46] had a new thought about anything because
[1:18:49] all his thoughts he always had and
[1:18:52] always will have and knows the end from
[1:18:55] the beginning because He is God
[1:18:58] thus the thoughts of God are eternal
[1:19:01] they are real and they are real this
[1:19:04] morning
[1:19:05] [Applause]
[1:19:08] so let's just talk about that a little
[1:19:10] bit so it means when Jesus was at the
[1:19:13] Garden of Gethsemane and he was weeping
[1:19:16] he took sin upon him even though he
[1:19:18] never sinned he took pain upon him even
[1:19:20] though he never or you don't hear me
[1:19:22] this morning but he was thinking about
[1:19:24] something he said Lord if it is possible
[1:19:27] let this cup pass but then his mind went
[1:19:31] all the way to 2018 and he saw people he
[1:19:35] said what nevertheless Lord not my will
[1:19:38] but I will be done because I'm thinking
[1:19:42] about our people I'm thinking your
[1:19:44] thoughts he is thinking the thoughts of
[1:19:47] God and you are the expression of the
[1:19:50] thoughts of God
[1:19:55] Oh hallelujah Oh glory hallelujah
[1:20:00] hallelujah Oh
[1:20:02] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:20:04] hallelujah maybe this will help somebody
[1:20:07] this morning and cause thoughts become
[1:20:10] his strategy when got things of
[1:20:13] something he wants to put things in
[1:20:15] place to make sure his thoughts come to
[1:20:17] pass till you want Jesus to be born in
[1:20:20] Bethlehem so God doesn't just say go to
[1:20:22] Bethlehem he works all around he has the
[1:20:25] laws to change to pass a law that mary
[1:20:29] has to go to the place of her family's
[1:20:31] Fortin so that she has to go to get
[1:20:34] Jesus to where he is supposed to be
[1:20:35] that's God's Way of doing things
[1:20:39] he plans everything out he planned it
[1:20:42] from before there was a moon and before
[1:20:44] there was a star before you had a
[1:20:46] problem before you had a trial before
[1:20:48] you have no money before you felt sick
[1:20:51] before you were wondering if you're
[1:20:53] gonna make it before you had your ups
[1:20:54] and downs before you got married before
[1:20:57] you had children before you went to work
[1:20:59] before you went to school before you
[1:21:02] cried before you came out your mother's
[1:21:04] womb he already saw he saw you
[1:21:06] victorious huh he saw you overcoming he
[1:21:10] saw you in Reviver he saw you a son a
[1:21:13] daughter of God in full dominion in full
[1:21:17] power
[1:21:19] and his thoughts cannot change his
[1:21:21] thoughts will never change there's
[1:21:23] nothing you could do that could separate
[1:21:26] you from the love of God his love is his
[1:21:29] thoughts it's because of love
[1:21:31] he had the thoughts about you when you
[1:21:34] were no good love reached out and mercy
[1:21:37] reached out and grace reach out
[1:21:42] hallelujah
[1:21:43] Oh can the church see men somebody
[1:21:48] you've got a shout of praise Oh
[1:21:51] hallelujah
[1:21:52] you may be seated God existed by himself
[1:21:56] for the Congolese there was nobody
[1:21:58] for him to heal there was nobody for him
[1:22:01] to deliver there was no crying there was
[1:22:04] no tears up for him to wipe away the
[1:22:06] tears
[1:22:07] so God thought about people who he would
[1:22:09] wipe their tears away he thought of a
[1:22:12] people who would have their struggles
[1:22:14] who would have their ups and downs up
[1:22:16] but his mercy and grace and his favor
[1:22:19] would wipe their tears away he wanted to
[1:22:22] heal the brokenhearted and his portable
[1:22:27] healing have never changed her his
[1:22:29] thoughts about giving the baptism of the
[1:22:32] Holy Ghost has never changed he cannot
[1:22:35] change he will never fail you
[1:22:39] he said my word cannot return unto me
[1:22:43] void so today I believe in I declare
[1:22:46] that's it is your deal to claim your
[1:22:49] position based on what God thought about
[1:22:52] you it's time like Gideon you try your
[1:22:55] shoulders back and see the sword of the
[1:22:58] Lord and of Gideon the sword of the Lord
[1:23:00] and the bride the sword of the Lord and
[1:23:03] the Elector you were born for such a
[1:23:05] time as this
[1:23:07] [Applause]
[1:23:11] [Music]
[1:23:14] hallelujah he may be seated
[1:23:17] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:23:20] oh my somebody give him worship his
[1:23:25] thoughts about you his thought went
[1:23:27] beyond your sins he didn't he was not
[1:23:30] just thinking about your sins he covered
[1:23:32] that in the blood when he died on
[1:23:35] Calvary it's because he thought about
[1:23:37] your sins that's why he made a way oh
[1:23:40] there's no therefore no condemnation
[1:23:43] what are you talking about
[1:23:46] what mistake what failure are you
[1:23:49] talking about this morning he already
[1:23:51] thought up he already saw you fall he
[1:23:54] saw you may your mistake he saw you in
[1:23:56] the depths of sin and he said I'm gonna
[1:23:59] die I'm gonna put blood this blood for
[1:24:02] your sin there's blood for your
[1:24:04] deliverance
[1:24:05] there is blood for their protection oh
[1:24:08] nothing but the blood of Jesus up yes
[1:24:11] power in the blood this morning
[1:24:13] [Applause]
[1:24:20] but you don't hear me this morning I'm
[1:24:22] still warming up I'm still warming up
[1:24:25] sister Gloria I'm still warming I'm
[1:24:27] sister Jana I'm still warming up since I
[1:24:29] Candice I'm still warming up because
[1:24:32] somebody's gonna break free if you could
[1:24:34] change your thinking if you can tip it
[1:24:38] you know what go to all the profit if
[1:24:41] you could just get the people to believe
[1:24:42] not even cancer would stand in your way
[1:24:46] it has to be a change of your mind
[1:24:49] a change of you've got to see the
[1:24:52] possibility that you can get the Holy
[1:24:54] Ghost you have got to see the
[1:24:56] possibility it has to become your
[1:24:59] thinking
[1:25:01] [Applause]
[1:25:07] halleluyah halleluyah
[1:25:11] you may be seated hallelujah
[1:25:14] someone's gonna go free and God what I
[1:25:19] feel safe he put a feel safe in the
[1:25:23] world because the battleground is the
[1:25:28] mind the seed is already in your soul
[1:25:33] and the devil cannot take it out so
[1:25:36] you're gonna make it no matter what you
[1:25:39] are gonna oh you don't hear me this
[1:25:40] morning that scene is in your soul and
[1:25:43] no devil to take it out
[1:25:46] [Applause]
[1:25:53] so listen to me you may be seated so the
[1:25:57] devil he can touch your soul but it's an
[1:26:01] agreement that your mind is a
[1:26:03] battleground so all the devil's tactics
[1:26:08] and strategies comes down to how you
[1:26:11] think how you think about yourself how
[1:26:15] you think about the revival how you
[1:26:18] think about your healing that's why when
[1:26:21] the man came to the prophet and he
[1:26:22] prayed for him and he have no feet he
[1:26:24] told him go and say my stripes I'm
[1:26:26] healed because that scripture let the
[1:26:31] weak say I am strong you see the way to
[1:26:34] silence the mind is when you begin to
[1:26:37] speak you can't you know there's some
[1:26:40] people you may babysit it you tell em
[1:26:42] stop talking and think take before
[1:26:48] you're talking because there's an
[1:26:51] ability of people to speak without
[1:26:53] thinking so you're thinking I'm weak and
[1:26:58] God's a year when you when when you're
[1:27:00] weak say I am strong and start a war
[1:27:03] with your mind
[1:27:04] [Applause]
[1:27:09] so this man was seen by stripes I'm
[1:27:12] healed his mind he didn't even have
[1:27:16] mental feet to believe that but when he
[1:27:19] said as if I stripes I'm healed his mind
[1:27:22] would say I don't know but by some
[1:27:24] healed by stripes I'm healed by stripes
[1:27:27] I'm healed by his stripes I'm healed by
[1:27:30] his stripes I'm healed
[1:27:31] the woman whose son died and she was on
[1:27:35] her way to see Elijah they see what's
[1:27:38] going on is everything okay she had a
[1:27:40] choice she said I see my boy dead but
[1:27:42] she's here all as well no she had a fear
[1:27:46] to see all as well
[1:27:47] she don't know exactly how it's gonna
[1:27:49] play out what she had to silence the
[1:27:52] doubt silence the negativity oh you know
[1:27:56] hear me this morning
[1:28:03] let the weak say I am strong something
[1:28:08] happens when you begin to speak there
[1:28:10] begins to get a connection you actually
[1:28:12] bring your mind into subjection because
[1:28:15] you know speaking the word so you
[1:28:17] connect to the word that's your father's
[1:28:19] wood so you bring your mind your body
[1:28:21] under subjection I'm gonna be healed I'm
[1:28:24] gonna be delivered I'm gonna have a
[1:28:26] revival and we're gonna have a break
[1:28:29] true my son is coming that's how you you
[1:28:31] in the Maxie and they send your crazy
[1:28:33] but I'm gonna have a revival I'm gonna
[1:28:36] get the Holy Ghost this joy that I have
[1:28:38] you know you have feel joy in a long
[1:28:40] time but you still seeing it this joy
[1:28:43] that I have the world didn't give it to
[1:28:45] me and after a while you start to feel
[1:28:47] joy in your fingers joy in your toes joy
[1:28:51] on your head and joy on your nose just
[1:28:54] make that up
[1:28:54] but it's joy unspeakable and full of
[1:28:58] glory because you are taking charge
[1:29:08] somebody you're gonna shout appraised
[1:29:10] that's 60% somebody give God a shout of
[1:29:14] praise who you may be seated
[1:29:17] hallelujah oh my the thoughts of God
[1:29:22] [Applause]
[1:29:26] because his thoughts are so much higher
[1:29:30] than our thoughts go out had to find a
[1:29:33] delivery mechanism to bring his thoughts
[1:29:36] through yet he couldn't use anybody and
[1:29:43] everybody so he instituted an office
[1:29:45] called the Prophet and the job of the
[1:29:50] Prophet was to enter into the mind of
[1:29:53] God and see what was relevant for his
[1:29:57] day his age his people and his message
[1:29:59] and when the prophets woke he was
[1:30:02] speaking the thoughts of God for his day
[1:30:04] for his time for his people and his
[1:30:06] message and anybody who listened to that
[1:30:10] prophet got the Prophet's reward got the
[1:30:13] blessing of that prophet because that
[1:30:15] prophet once he stayed true to what he
[1:30:18] heard was speaking the mind of God so
[1:30:22] Moses he spoke the thoughts of God and
[1:30:25] when he spoke it was not Moses his
[1:30:27] thoughts it was God's thoughts so when
[1:30:30] Moses spoke it was not Moses his words
[1:30:33] it was God's Word because God has to use
[1:30:36] somebody and I thank God that an hour
[1:30:40] day he could have a prophet who can
[1:30:43] catch the mind of God because I couldn't
[1:30:46] catch it but yet the place our prophet
[1:30:49] to catch the mind of God and that
[1:30:52] prophet had to speak it
[1:30:56] and when's he spooky it becames mine it
[1:30:59] became yours and now we have authority
[1:31:02] to rest on the thoughts of God and to
[1:31:05] claim every promise claim our children
[1:31:08] claim on healing claim our deliverance
[1:31:12] claim our Dominion claim our power claim
[1:31:16] a redemptive rights
[1:31:21] you may receive it
[1:31:24] hallelujah I think we spoke about this
[1:31:27] over the Easter weekend about
[1:31:29] jurisdiction that this belongs to us we
[1:31:33] have jurisdiction heaven is not our
[1:31:36] domain but is it the Bible says we shall
[1:31:39] reign on the earth so the devil himself
[1:31:41] understand that this is not his home he
[1:31:47] is cotton initiative and God as weights
[1:31:50] in the whole creation is groaning for
[1:31:52] the sons and daughters of God to take
[1:31:54] their position that's why the Bible said
[1:31:57] a whole creation groaning for the
[1:31:59] manifestation of the sons of God when
[1:32:02] born sons filled sons would speak and
[1:32:05] they would move mountains it wouldn't
[1:32:07] even be praying in Jesus name because
[1:32:09] Jesus would be feeling the people it'll
[1:32:12] be just like pizza nobody was healing
[1:32:15] Jesus shadow but when Peter walked the
[1:32:17] earth the Bible said they were healing
[1:32:18] Peters shadow because the light of God
[1:32:21] was shining through Pizza brother you
[1:32:24] haven't seen power yet you haven't seen
[1:32:26] manifestation yet
[1:32:28] [Applause]
[1:32:32] you maybe see this can I talk about
[1:32:37] pizza a little bit I don't want to type
[1:32:42] it side to the thoughts of God the way
[1:32:49] this thing works friends is that there's
[1:32:51] no accident with God he doesn't make any
[1:32:55] mistakes
[1:32:58] so everything you went through in life
[1:33:02] anything you are going through in life
[1:33:05] anything you will go through in life
[1:33:08] there is no such thing as a mistake
[1:33:13] because the Bible says all things work
[1:33:16] together for good to them that love God
[1:33:18] to them who are the called according to
[1:33:20] his purpose so if you are connected to
[1:33:23] his purpose there is nothing like a
[1:33:25] mistake
[1:33:26] God is not accidental home you grew up
[1:33:29] in you may not understand why you grew
[1:33:31] up there but God pleased you there for a
[1:33:34] purpose Joseph was in prison and he
[1:33:37] didn't understand why he was there but
[1:33:40] that was part of the purpose when his
[1:33:42] brothers threw him in the well he didn't
[1:33:45] know what was being unfolded that yes
[1:33:47] down the road he would have been king he
[1:33:51] would have been a ruler he would have
[1:33:53] made a way for his family
[1:33:58] how you think Joseph felt when he was in
[1:34:00] the well you ever thought about it you
[1:34:10] see when you read scripture you must put
[1:34:12] yourself in that position
[1:34:15] put yourself in in in in in Joseph's
[1:34:18] shoes put yourself in Daniel shoes kneel
[1:34:21] and then see some people say that not
[1:34:26] sure by that one now I'll take me take
[1:34:29] me well but naughty lions then no but
[1:34:32] really put yourself in lines then my une
[1:34:34] lion some of you fraid spider put it any
[1:34:41] line then but Danny was there for a
[1:34:48] purpose and everything is for a purpose
[1:34:51] so go I had a purpose for Peter we read
[1:34:56] Pizza saying after your faith virtue and
[1:34:58] virtue knowledge and and that's pizza
[1:35:02] that's the pizza that is on top of his
[1:35:05] game as it were that's the pizza who is
[1:35:08] in this position but Peter was not
[1:35:10] always he wasn't always that way Peter
[1:35:16] had his struggles Peter had his doubts
[1:35:17] Peter had his failures and the Bible
[1:35:20] said that Peters first encounter if you
[1:35:23] when you read a scripture would have
[1:35:24] been hearing about Jesus and being there
[1:35:26] with the first miracle and the first
[1:35:30] miracle at the wedding wasn't enough for
[1:35:33] pizza to follow and then we read the
[1:35:37] scripture later on Peters mother-in-law
[1:35:40] was healed by Jesus and all of this was
[1:35:45] Peters experiences that was building up
[1:35:48] to God get you ready to call Peter but
[1:35:53] the only reason he can call pizza is
[1:35:55] because he had been thinking about Peter
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:35:59] his mind was on Peter let me read a
[1:36:06] story of when Peter and his brethren had
[1:36:09] finished fishing one night and they
[1:36:12] caught nothing you remember right and
[1:36:14] the Bible said they were washing their
[1:36:16] nets they were packing up shop after a
[1:36:19] hard night of work where they caught
[1:36:21] nothing and the Bible said that Jesus
[1:36:24] came down and he sat in Peters boat he
[1:36:29] didn't even ask permission
[1:36:31] Peter was packing up to go home and
[1:36:33] Peter end up when acharyas leave a boat
[1:36:36] so Peter end up in a church service and
[1:36:39] Jesus is preaching on Peters boat Jesus
[1:36:43] uses Peters boat as his pulpit and Pizza
[1:36:47] is the unwilling participant in that
[1:36:49] service because it was not a service
[1:36:52] invitation nor had he planned to be
[1:36:53] there Jesus just appeared and had a
[1:36:55] service and at the end of the service
[1:37:00] Jesus tells Peter throw your net plural
[1:37:05] nets into the water into the deep
[1:37:08] lobos's and Peter say well a fish all
[1:37:12] night and caught nothing nevertheless
[1:37:16] because I hear what happened at the
[1:37:19] wedding because I see my mother-in-law
[1:37:20] healed but the Bible said he cast on his
[1:37:24] net singular as if to say I'll give it a
[1:37:29] shot but I'm not a hundred percent going
[1:37:31] through all minutes I've seen enough to
[1:37:35] convince me but I'm not a hundred
[1:37:36] percent convinced because I didn't have
[1:37:41] a personal experience I've heard what
[1:37:43] happened at the wedding that wasn't me I
[1:37:46] heard what happened with my
[1:37:47] mother-in-law but I wasn't me but I'm
[1:37:48] willing to give it a try I wanted to try
[1:37:51] it one more time but God was thinking
[1:37:54] about pizza because pizza had a purpose
[1:37:57] that he had to accomplish
[1:38:00] I didn't know what the next day was
[1:38:03] gonna be like or the next month was
[1:38:04] gonna be like or the next year it's
[1:38:06] gonna be like but he started to trust
[1:38:08] and the batteries every throw the net
[1:38:11] into the water that got so much fish
[1:38:13] that the net Brook and the baby set up
[1:38:18] it's a marveled and his response was he
[1:38:22] fell and started to repent because he
[1:38:28] recognized that he was in the presence
[1:38:30] of something she clicked that he
[1:38:36] recognized that he was a sinner because
[1:38:39] he said it Lord I'm a sinner and that
[1:38:43] was the experience that was Peters
[1:38:46] turning point and Jesus said follow me
[1:38:50] and I said to the young people Peter
[1:38:53] left the boat he left the fishes he left
[1:38:56] everything and he followed Jesus and
[1:39:00] that sounds like a wonderful testimony
[1:39:03] and it is and there are many people who
[1:39:06] have never had an experience with God so
[1:39:08] they they come they have some level of
[1:39:14] belief but it's not deep rooted in their
[1:39:16] source and Peter he's coming on he's
[1:39:20] believing more and more his faith is
[1:39:23] going Jesus doing miracles he gets v lo2
[1:39:26] fishes the disciples to Peter among them
[1:39:28] what these are so many he sees a miracle
[1:39:32] this is Peter Jesus walking on the water
[1:39:35] Peter said Lord if that's you pin me
[1:39:37] come we know the story
[1:39:40] here we find Peter again walking
[1:39:43] underwater without the Holy Ghost
[1:39:45] walking underwater until you recognize
[1:39:49] that he wasn't too comfortable and he
[1:39:52] started to sink he said lord save me
[1:39:57] st. Peter but God is thinking about
[1:40:00] pizza he's not thinking of his ups and
[1:40:03] downs and his mistakes and failures he's
[1:40:05] thinking of where pizza is going to be
[1:40:08] [Applause]
[1:40:10] now to show you how God things
[1:40:13] differently from us if we know something
[1:40:15] bad about somebody most of us can deal
[1:40:17] with it most of us can deal with stuff
[1:40:23] that's bad about somebody it troubles us
[1:40:25] and yet Jesus knew every mistake Peter
[1:40:29] would make jesus said who do men say
[1:40:33] that I am Matthew 16 and the brothers I
[1:40:37] will remember this terribly well some
[1:40:39] say you are Elias
[1:40:40] something you are Jeremiah Simon Peter
[1:40:43] said Oh at a price it's not eleven go up
[1:40:45] it is the only one he said flesh and
[1:40:47] blood did not reveal this to you but my
[1:40:49] father in heaven I want you to
[1:40:53] understand like a man I wonder how Peter
[1:40:55] felt when he heard that Peter would have
[1:41:02] felt good
[1:41:03] he would have felt special and then I
[1:41:07] later down that same chapter jesus knows
[1:41:09] how to introduce to them
[1:41:10] I'm going to die I'm going to be
[1:41:12] crucified and Peter's like no not so not
[1:41:16] no no no and Jesus a caddy beyond me
[1:41:18] Satan I wanna help Peter felt but God is
[1:41:26] still thinking about Peter through his
[1:41:29] mistakes through his failures through
[1:41:32] his ups and downs Peter is still
[1:41:36] unguarded
[1:41:42] because God knew that pizza had a
[1:41:44] destination with the pillar of fire he
[1:41:48] had a destination with the upper room
[1:41:50] and that's what I want to strike on but
[1:41:54] even before that God to a pizza he said
[1:41:58] pizza before the crow you go to
[1:42:02] deny me you remember then Peter said no
[1:42:06] I'll never deny you you know what I did
[1:42:13] study my Christ the Bible said if you
[1:42:20] stand for me I'll stand 15 I mean you're
[1:42:22] on your own and in the moment of Jesus's
[1:42:27] greatest need as it were Peter stood
[1:42:30] there and deny Christ and God knew he
[1:42:34] was gonna do it and still didn't even
[1:42:38] change his mind about Peter because he
[1:42:42] had a certain thought about Peter and it
[1:42:48] really struck me because we just came
[1:42:50] through Eastern when you read a
[1:42:52] scripture about the woman who went to
[1:42:54] annoying the body of Jesus brother
[1:42:56] Clarence when they met the angel the
[1:42:59] angel said to them and I always it never
[1:43:01] really hit me so much until a few years
[1:43:04] ago and the ages of them go tell his
[1:43:06] disciples and Peter
[1:43:14] God was thinking of my Peter so much
[1:43:18] he knew pizza would have been feeling
[1:43:20] down after three and a half years you
[1:43:25] deny the ministry that walked on water
[1:43:28] that fed 5,000 them Jesus had Peter on
[1:43:33] his torch so much that when he angel
[1:43:35] spoke to them he said go tell my
[1:43:37] disciples and Peter Peter might be down
[1:43:41] in the dumps right now go find Peter and
[1:43:43] tell him that I'm not dead it's hard to
[1:44:00] understand what Peter would have gone
[1:44:02] through to know that God says you're
[1:44:05] gonna deny me you know you're gonna feel
[1:44:07] like this is no Lana I'm gonna be strong
[1:44:09] I'm gonna make it and then Peter find
[1:44:11] himself victim or falling to the very
[1:44:14] thing he said he would not fall to deny
[1:44:19] Christ deny your testimony Peter would
[1:44:23] have gone into hiding as it will we
[1:44:25] don't even know how the other disciples
[1:44:26] looked at Peter in so much where the
[1:44:30] currents of the Angels have gone tell my
[1:44:32] disciples and Peter
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:37] you don't know what anybody is going
[1:44:39] through this morning you don't know what
[1:44:42] pain what struggle what valley but pizza
[1:44:46] I don't know what I'm thinking he would
[1:44:49] have been in some type of Valley because
[1:44:52] he felt that he failed God but God's
[1:44:56] thoughts was on him that Gordon said
[1:45:00] Peter you finished
[1:45:01] he said go tell my disciples and pizza
[1:45:05] telling all my life tell him the promise
[1:45:08] is real tell him the promise is true
[1:45:11] tell him I'm still thinking about him
[1:45:13] tell him when I was walking up Calvary
[1:45:16] he was on my mind when I stood on the
[1:45:19] cross he was on my mind he may have
[1:45:22] messed up what he is on my mind
[1:45:28] [Applause]
[1:45:40] three times fifteen I cried but when
[1:45:43] Jesus met him he said Peter love is down
[1:45:45] me he has him three times so he could
[1:45:49] undo what you're done lord I love you
[1:45:52] lord i love you lord i love you and
[1:45:55] that's what i feel this morning lord i
[1:45:58] love you lord i love you lord i love you
[1:46:01] i've made mistakes
[1:46:03] i have not stood as strong as i should
[1:46:05] have stood all the time in small ways we
[1:46:09] have denied this gospel we have denied
[1:46:11] this christ but the thing that his
[1:46:14] thoughts are telling us that he can see
[1:46:17] past our mistakes see past our failures
[1:46:21] see past our falling
[1:46:23] she passed our valley and say you're
[1:46:26] gonna make it you're gonna overcome
[1:46:29] you're gonna get the Holy Ghost you're
[1:46:31] gonna be delivered you wanna be set free
[1:46:34] [Applause]
[1:46:38] Oh hallelujah hallelujah somebody give
[1:46:44] God praise because God's thoughts it's
[1:46:48] not limited by time his thoughts are
[1:46:51] eternal so in the black part of God's
[1:46:53] minor God always saw pizza on the day of
[1:46:56] Pentecost
[1:46:58] he always saw pizza silver and gold have
[1:47:00] I not but such as I have I'm gonna give
[1:47:03] it unto you everything before was the
[1:47:06] processor to bring pizza to that's what
[1:47:09] up and everything before today has been
[1:47:13] the process to bring you to the service
[1:47:15] to bring you to this moment to bring you
[1:47:18] to this Oh hallelujah

[1:47:40] ways higher than your ways up when you
[1:47:42] get trouble to forgive it's easy for God
[1:47:45] to forgive when you have to hold on and
[1:47:48] struggle to let go God lets it go and
[1:47:51] drops it into the sea of forgetfulness
[1:47:53] when you remember what you did God can't
[1:47:56] even remember what you did oh you know
[1:47:58] hear me respond it
[1:48:00] [Applause]

[1:48:07] hallelujah hallelujah our thoughts are
[1:48:11] not like his thoughts our thoughts of
[1:48:14] the nature of our thoughts are evil the

[1:48:24] tortoise Pisa and goodness and meekness

[1:48:34] is a promise of let this mind be in you
[1:48:37] which was also in Christ Jesus God wants
[1:48:41] to give you a chance phantom of your
[1:48:43] thinking that you can begin to think

[1:50:57] of the evening he is longing for that

[1:51:02] what's on your mind is smaller oh I need
[1:51:05] to renew my mind this morning all we
[1:51:08] need to forget about the world forget
[1:51:10] about our ambitions forget about our
[1:51:12] goals and ideas and get the mind of God
[1:51:16] somebody say man
[1:51:22] to change your words your thinking must
[1:51:26] change to change your actions your
[1:51:28] thinking must change to change your
[1:51:31] behavior your thinking must change to
[1:51:33] change your prayer life your thinking

[1:51:38] God your thinking must change the deal
[1:51:41] with greater challenges your thinking
[1:51:43] must change oh let's sit P the name of
[1:51:52] the Lord there's a wolf here going on
[1:51:55] friends it's a wolf in the mind it's a
[1:51:57] wolf in the spiritual realm and in the
[1:51:59] message put on the whole armour of God
[1:52:01] or he said you know this warfare between
[1:52:04] nations he said it's a great warfare
[1:52:06] going on be to be on that it's a warfare
[1:52:09] between God and Satan we know this
[1:52:11] already is the first warfare it's still
[1:52:13] raging and I'm so glad the Prophet said
[1:52:16] it'll soon come to an end then it will
[1:52:19] be over
[1:52:20] and Satan as his agents out everywhere
[1:52:22] watching spying out on God's people and
[1:52:25] God's moves and the enemy is setting
[1:52:28] everywhere watching to see what he can
[1:52:30] do and God's got some hour to so we find
[1:52:34] that these secret agents of the enemy
[1:52:37] each nation now will equip its men you
[1:52:39] know the quote with the latest equipment
[1:52:41] the very latest and in study and they do
[1:52:44] everything they're trying to counteract
[1:52:47] the other fellows weapons they get a
[1:52:49] little more modern weapon something a
[1:52:51] little more punch to it from the bore an
[1:52:53] arrow to a musket from a musket to a
[1:52:55] modern rifle and from that anatomic they
[1:52:58] just keep on building it keeps them busy
[1:53:01] all the time and if they want to survive
[1:53:03] they want to equip their soldiers with
[1:53:06] the best equipment that there is
[1:53:10] with the Vanuatu well-core you know he's
[1:53:13] infinite see he don't have to think
[1:53:15] anything better he just got the best to
[1:53:18] begin with so you cannot improve on it
[1:53:21] nothing to be done about it he just
[1:53:23] gives us the best that's his word that's
[1:53:28] right that's his word the best that can
[1:53:29] be given God gives his people the very
[1:53:32] best that's what he chose for his
[1:53:34] children the very very best
[1:53:37] I'm so glad of that can the church team
[1:53:40] and when you watch the natural world you
[1:53:43] have countries for years they call it
[1:53:45] the arms race different countries wanted
[1:53:47] to get better weapons they wanted to get
[1:53:49] nuclear weapons just recently there's
[1:53:51] rumors going around with Syria and
[1:53:53] Russia and China and this nuclear war
[1:53:56] and that and that's in the natural
[1:53:58] around it took years for countries to
[1:54:01] develop the weapons they have but in the
[1:54:04] Church of the Living God
[1:54:06] the Prophet said God give us the best
[1:54:08] weapon up front while natural man was
[1:54:11] improving we always had a very best
[1:54:13] weapon they have to do tests and study
[1:54:18] and the trial is rocket to see if it
[1:54:21] will work
[1:54:21] we don't wonder if it will work it does
[1:54:23] work every single time when just one
[1:54:27] needed it to work it will tend when
[1:54:30] Talia needed it to work it worked then
[1:54:32] when the Hebrew boys needed a tool they
[1:54:35] didn't need a better weapon they said
[1:54:36] our God is able to deliver us and he did
[1:54:42] when Moses looked at the Egyptian they
[1:54:45] had swears they had straws they had
[1:54:47] chariots Moses had a word he said the
[1:54:50] Egyptians you see today he will see them
[1:54:53] no more all these fears shields chariots
[1:54:58] they had was irrelevant because he had
[1:55:01] the best weapon oh you know hear me this
[1:55:04] morning oh you know yeah me this morning
[1:55:07] when that sickness wasn't the prophets

[1:55:32] Prophet wasn't even in the country and

[2:07:35] halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah friends
[2:07:42] we don't think about him enough we don't
[2:07:48] meditate on him enough oh that song
[2:07:52] let's forget about ourselves and
[2:07:54] concentrate on something happens when
[2:07:59] you are thinking about him and he's
[2:08:00] thinking about you oh but the random and
[2:08:15] the message the world became flesh he
[2:08:19] said what kind of people should we be if
[2:08:22] the very Holy Spirit has you saw
[2:08:24] embodied or empowered that you don't use
[2:08:26] your own thoughts you don't use your own
[2:08:29] mind you don't use your own opinions but
[2:08:31] the Holy Spirit has you so built until
[2:08:34] your thoughts and your being is God's
[2:08:37] Spirit expressing itself through you
[2:08:39] what kind of church would we be what
[2:08:44] kind of people would it be this morning
[2:08:46] if this Branum tabernacle and I say if
[2:08:48] this headstone tabernacle this morning
[2:08:51] was so filled with the presence of God
[2:08:53] when you didn't even use your own mind
[2:08:55] didn't even use your own thoughts you
[2:08:57] didn't even have no ultimate of your own
[2:09:00] but just to be led by the spirit
[2:09:06] our thoughts run different a lot of
[2:09:10] times we walk up and say how you do
[2:09:12] brother and you don't mean it in your
[2:09:14] heart but when you become so dead to the
[2:09:19] things of the world this is the prophets
[2:09:22] word that crisis first Christ is all
[2:09:28] that's a powerful statement Christ is
[2:09:31] first Christ is all then your entire
[2:09:35] make up is of the spirit he has full
[2:09:39] control that's when your thoughts will
[2:09:41] be clean your thoughts with me
[2:09:43] pure can the church say Amen Oh
[2:09:48] hallelujah friends the world is
[2:09:53] preparing for a funeral service how do
[2:10:07] you the musicians can get ready friends
[2:10:21] God has a way of approach and I believe
[2:10:24] that everyone is here this morning not
[2:10:27] because of formality or because we just
[2:10:29] want to be in church this morning
[2:10:33] because we want to get something from
[2:10:37] the Lord there's a need in your heart is
[2:10:43] a desire in your heart there's a cry
[2:10:47] there's a fist
[2:10:54] you know David lost the joy of his
[2:10:57] salvation he didn't lose his salvation
[2:11:00] he lost the joy of it and he prayed a
[2:11:06] prayer Lord restore and to me the joy of
[2:11:09] my salvation renew a right spirit in me
[2:11:15] when we have problems we have struggles
[2:11:18] it consumes our mind it consumes our
[2:11:20] thinking what is the bills whether it's
[2:11:23] sickness whether it's stress on the job
[2:11:26] or in your marriage or family or
[2:11:27] whatever it consumes your thinking and
[2:11:30] it becomes very difficult to focus as it
[2:11:34] will it takes a pull and a pressure to
[2:11:38] do anything there are people who can
[2:11:42] function in a work because they are just
[2:11:43] overwhelming they can function in
[2:11:46] marriage because they are overwhelmed
[2:11:48] they can't cope with life because they
[2:11:49] are overwhelmed and and if people are
[2:11:53] going to that level of being overwhelm
[2:11:55] is even hard to enter into presence of
[2:11:57] God because your mind is you come to
[2:11:59] church and you're thinking about the
[2:12:01] bill or the project or whatever it is
[2:12:09] and something has to arrest you to make
[2:12:14] that separation between this natural
[2:12:16] world and the things of God and if you
[2:12:21] ever want to approach God there's a way
[2:12:23] to approach God but the random said if
[2:12:26] you don't know how to approach God we'll
[2:12:28] never get an audience with God you could
[2:12:33] have the desire to get the audience but
[2:12:37] if you have the wrong approach he will
[2:12:39] not receive you friends I want that
[2:12:46] reconnection of the relationship with
[2:12:49] God that when you approach God he hears
[2:12:55] you but a Branham said it's not even man
[2:13:03] that seeks God it's God at six men his
[2:13:06] nature is holy his nature is high and
[2:13:09] man the fall is low and degraded that's
[2:13:12] a Prophet's wood but the man said a man
[2:13:15] without God he's not mentally right
[2:13:23] Butler Adam said a man without cord is
[2:13:26] no more than a brute he said now that
[2:13:29] sounds very deep but I can prove it to
[2:13:30] you and the only reason that we have a
[2:13:33] civilization today is because of Jesus
[2:13:35] Christ people says that the religion of
[2:13:42] Jesus Christ runs you crazy
[2:13:45] the Rev Adam said it gives you your
[2:13:47] right mind
[2:13:49] he says you're not right till you find
[2:13:53] him notice he didn't say a fine Church
[2:14:00] he said find him but the man said I
[2:14:04] don't mean to hurt your feelings
[2:14:06] Brad you know gentlemen I don't mean to
[2:14:09] do that but I mean to actually put the
[2:14:11] thing just the way it is Christ never
[2:14:15] makes you lose your mind he gives you
[2:14:17] your mind after you lost it it's the
[2:14:22] devil that makes you lose your mind and
[2:14:24] but the Branham talks about Legion how
[2:14:28] he was out of his mind until Jesus came
[2:14:32] to restore his mind his right mind and a
[2:14:39] man with all his rights might not matter
[2:14:40] how much in the leg he has he still not
[2:14:43] seen yet without knowing Christ now a
[2:14:48] lot of people know Church they know the
[2:14:51] Bible they know about God but they don't
[2:14:53] know Christ but the Branham said he
[2:15:01] doesn't know any different you've got to
[2:15:03] become born again and to the world when
[2:15:07] you're born again it may look foolish
[2:15:10] but in the sight of God you become
[2:15:11] blessed and no matter how much the world
[2:15:15] tries to say anything about it you know
[2:15:17] then have you a pass from death into
[2:15:20] life
[2:15:23] so just polishing and joining church and
[2:15:26] reading a whole lot and knowing a lot of
[2:15:28] books and authors and so forth doesn't
[2:15:29] mean that you're converted because you
[2:15:32] have an intellectual mind that means you
[2:15:34] have a mental conception that is a God
[2:15:36] somewhere you're not a Christian yet
[2:15:39] until you become personal in contact
[2:15:42] with Christ that changes your heart and
[2:15:45] nature then you become God's child and
[2:15:49] all things is passed away and all things
[2:15:52] become new again and many of us we
[2:15:58] convinced ourselves mentally that we are
[2:16:00] okay and when you find yourself in a
[2:16:02] situation you realize that you need more
[2:16:04] of God
[2:16:06] you know fresh experience with God a
[2:16:10] deeper experience with God to meet the
[2:16:13] challenge of the hour because the
[2:16:17] challenge is not getting easier it's
[2:16:18] getting harder and you will require a
[2:16:21] deeper relationship with God to face the
[2:16:25] challenge of the hour on one level it
[2:16:42] troubles me when people come to church
[2:16:48] and then during the week they live a
[2:16:51] different life you dress one way for
[2:16:56] church you speak one way for church you
[2:16:59] act one way if a church but the moment
[2:17:02] is service is over or you are out of
[2:17:05] contact from believers it's like you a
[2:17:08] whole different person
[2:17:10] the words you use change the way you
[2:17:15] dress change do you speak to your family
[2:17:18] changes and that's the hypocrisy that
[2:17:23] God hates he's in a rally your heart or
[2:17:28] your call but this middle-of-the-road
[2:17:31] business I'll throw you out of my mouth
[2:17:38] but the brand said the Holy Spirit has
[2:17:40] to call us first or we'll never think
[2:17:43] nothing of it
[2:17:46] he said churches all right I believe
[2:17:49] that's okay with the real touch God has
[2:17:52] to do it is there anybody this morning
[2:17:55] looking for a real touch
[2:17:57] a real touch from God not too fulfilled
[2:18:04] you know I press Maria to come to church
[2:18:06] really it's a real touch how could you
[2:18:14] come to service and and and leave with
[2:18:16] your cup with room in it trying to close
[2:18:30] up
[2:18:31] [Music]
[2:18:41] hmm
[2:18:44] with the brown them said without the
[2:18:45] shedding of blood there's no remission
[2:18:49] of sin but the bottom said Adam had his
[2:18:54] own approach when he took the fig leaves
[2:18:58] to cover up his shame and by the ban I'm
[2:19:02] tagged a terrifically used to your own
[2:19:04] interpretation your own ideas and there
[2:19:08] are a lot of people here this morning
[2:19:10] who quite honestly really think they're
[2:19:13] okay and today if man things now help
[2:19:21] mrs. Jones over here she's a widow woman
[2:19:23] she needs some coal I'll give it to the
[2:19:25] Red Cross or some charity out of my
[2:19:27] abundance I would join the church
[2:19:29] you only make in yourself an approach
[2:19:31] that God will refuse there's only one
[2:19:34] approach to God God refused Adams
[2:19:38] approach and then God went and made an
[2:19:41] approach for Adam he made Adam and
[2:19:44] approach to himself and by doing that he
[2:19:46] slayed some sheep or something and get
[2:19:48] them some skins and shoo the blood
[2:19:50] brought the first approach to the world
[2:19:52] to God for sin and that was God's first
[2:19:59] method and it has been from that day
[2:20:00] till this day the same thing true the
[2:20:03] shedding of the blood brings the
[2:20:06] approach to God and in every season and
[2:20:13] every time because when Jesus died up
[2:20:15] until that time he still use goats and
[2:20:17] sheep oh and Jesus that he was the
[2:20:19] perfect sacrifice ran the field from top
[2:20:25] to bottom to allow individuals to access
[2:20:29] or have access and then he typed it
[2:20:33] through the word that the same blood
[2:20:35] that was applied as the token for them
[2:20:38] to come out of Egypt it's the same blood
[2:20:42] that must be applied in the spiritual in
[2:20:45] our day to come out of this Egypt that
[2:20:48] we're living in
[2:20:50] and the word says when I see the blood
[2:20:53] I'll pass over you the true Passover
[2:21:00] when I see the token I'll pass over you
[2:21:03] when I see the life I'll pass over you
[2:21:07] when I see the Holy Ghost I'll pass over
[2:21:10] you when I see the word manifested I'll
[2:21:13] pass over you I'm gonna Branham said
[2:21:18] this token must be displayed it can be
[2:21:22] hidden
[2:21:22] it must be displayed to the public so
[2:21:27] that people can know this is your
[2:21:29] testimony people can walk outside your
[2:21:32] house and says that's a Christian the
[2:21:35] people on your job can see that's a real
[2:21:38] Christian who Lord help us
[2:21:42] that's the thoughts of God that he has
[2:21:45] concerning you that you become his
[2:21:50] advertisement board that you become his
[2:21:53] display that you become his expression
[2:21:56] when people see you they see him Friends
[2:22:00] of Jesus that this world will see will
[2:22:02] be him living through individuals in
[2:22:05] such a timelessness so maybe you have
