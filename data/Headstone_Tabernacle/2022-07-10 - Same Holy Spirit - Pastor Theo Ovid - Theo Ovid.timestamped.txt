[38:32] and hebrews chapter 13 verse 8.
[38:35] so you want to read from matthew chapter
[38:36] 20
[38:38] for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a
[38:40] man
[38:42] that says as a householder
[38:44] so that is he's in charge of an estate
[38:46] which went out early in the morning to
[38:48] hire laborers into his vinya
[38:51] and when he had agreed with the laborers
[38:53] for penny a day
[38:55] he sent them into his vineyard
[38:58] and he went out about the third hour
[39:00] which is about nine o'clock
[39:02] and saw others standing idly in the
[39:05] marketplace
[39:06] and said unto them go e also into the
[39:08] vineyard and whatsoever is right i will
[39:10] give it to you and they went their way
[39:14] again
[39:15] he went out about the sixth hour
[39:17] which is about noon
[39:19] and the ninth hour which is about three
[39:21] o'clock and did likewise
[39:24] and about 11 hour which is about five
[39:26] o'clock
[39:27] he went out and found others standing
[39:29] idle
[39:30] say it unto them
[39:31] why standing here all the idol note
[39:36] the object is to get them into the field
[39:37] and labor okay
[39:39] verse seven they say unto him because no
[39:41] man had had us he says unto them go also
[39:44] into the vineyard and whatever is right
[39:47] that shall he receive
[39:49] so when evil was come
[39:51] the lord of the vineyard says unto the
[39:53] servants call the laborers and give them
[39:56] the higher
[39:57] beginning from the last
[39:59] unto the first
[40:00] and when they came
[40:02] that were hired about the 11th hour
[40:05] they received every man a penny
[40:07] when the first came
[40:09] they supposed that they should receive
[40:11] more
[40:12] and they likewise receive every mana
[40:14] penny
[40:15] and when they received it
[40:17] the moment against the good man of the
[40:19] house saying these last have wrote but
[40:22] one hour and that was made them equal
[40:25] unto us
[40:26] which have borne the burden
[40:28] and the heat of the day
[40:30] but he answered one of them and said
[40:31] friend i do no wrong
[40:33] this thou not agree with me for a penny
[40:37] take that time is
[40:40] and go that way
[40:41] i will give under this last image and
[40:43] disease
[40:44] it is is it that lawful for me to do
[40:46] what i will with my own
[40:48] is that an evil because i am good
[40:51] so the last shall be first
[40:53] and the first
[40:55] last
[40:56] for many be called
[40:58] but few chosen
[41:00] hebrews 13 8
[41:01] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[41:05] and forever let's pray father we thank
[41:06] you for your word
[41:08] and i pray that you break the bread of
[41:10] life to us
[41:11] take me out of the way that i be fully
[41:13] yielded to you and that you would speak
[41:16] what your people need to hear
[41:18] may they hear thus saith the lord this
[41:20] morning
[41:21] in jesus name i ask it
[41:22] amen and amen you may be seated
[41:25] go praise god
[41:27] such a blessing to have all of you here
[41:29] again
[41:30] and we say welcome
[41:32] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[41:36] and i think thank you for that inspiring
[41:38] song service so this morning
[41:41] [Applause]
[41:42] this morning of a title title is same
[41:46] holy spirit
[41:48] that's the title same holy spirit
[41:50] of an inspiration jesus christ the same
[41:54] yesterday
[41:55] today and forever
[41:57] another subject
[41:59] one word
[42:01] that's a subject
[42:03] i never had a one word subject before
[42:04] listening
[42:06] and this would seem
[42:08] it means
[42:10] as a
[42:11] synonym
[42:12] co-equal
[42:14] duplicate equal
[42:17] identical
[42:19] indistinguishable
[42:22] unchanging
[42:23] unchanged
[42:25] changeless
[42:27] on varian
[42:29] on varied
[42:31] constant
[42:32] consistent
[42:34] that is what this word c means
[42:38] so when we want the same it means just
[42:40] that
[42:41] to seem
[42:43] nothing less
[42:45] than the scene
[42:47] we read a parable when they talk about
[42:48] the cmp
[42:51] hallelujah that the first book has
[42:52] received
[42:53] is not something
[42:55] so let's continue let's start
[42:57] but abandon
[42:59] how beautiful it is on the day of
[43:01] pentecost
[43:02] when the holy ghost fell down from
[43:03] heaven
[43:04] he said our manner after we come to the
[43:07] blood we have been saved being cleansed
[43:09] from our sins and the holy ghost fell
[43:11] peterson on their pentecost it is for
[43:13] you and for your children
[43:14] and for them that are far off even as
[43:17] many as the lord our god shall call
[43:20] are you ready now
[43:21] and every person
[43:24] that enters into the baptism of the
[43:26] spirit
[43:27] can have the same kind of holy ghost
[43:30] that they got on the day of pentecost
[43:33] not a different kind
[43:36] same
[43:38] same kind
[43:39] he said i believe to be god's truth
[43:42] not something that looked like it
[43:44] but the real thing
[43:46] the same kind of holy ghost that fell
[43:49] back there
[43:50] falls now
[43:52] the same kind
[43:54] do you believe it
[43:56] that's a question you have to answer do
[43:58] you believe it
[43:59] the holy ghost bring forth the same kind
[44:01] of evidence and proof that they had back
[44:03] there
[44:04] comes with the same holy ghost then
[44:07] brahms says hallelujah how good you see
[44:09] i like this yes i feel it right now
[44:11] that's right it's real
[44:13] it's just as real as it ever was to me
[44:16] that's right the same holy spirit that
[44:19] fell back there on the day of pentecost
[44:23] ocala real calvary jesus blessed and
[44:25] died for me
[44:27] then he tore the soul of his own son
[44:30] separated a covenant
[44:32] he throwed a body into the ground it lay
[44:34] there for three days and nights it rolls
[44:37] up
[44:38] for it is not possible that my holy one
[44:40] shall see corruption
[44:41] neither leave his soul in hell
[44:43] and his soul was a spirit that ascended
[44:45] into hell
[44:47] he rose god did pick up his body and
[44:49] give him life
[44:50] he took the body of jesus
[44:52] set it at the right hand in glory and
[44:55] send back the holy ghost as a covenant
[44:58] there you are
[45:00] so when jesus died soul went under hell
[45:02] to preach the soul in his prison isn't
[45:04] that right then god take the body put it
[45:05] up
[45:06] and release the spirit
[45:08] as a covenant
[45:10] are you ready
[45:11] don't fall short of that brother
[45:14] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[45:16] you are lost
[45:17] you won't have to worry about getting to
[45:19] heaven if there is nothing in here
[45:21] supernatural the doors can't unlock
[45:25] so to approach heaven's door you have to
[45:27] have something in you
[45:29] that is supernatural
[45:31] and that's the holy ghost
[45:33] oh praise god do you believe that
[45:36] the promise is not the joint church
[45:38] the promises to receive the same holy
[45:40] ghost
[45:41] that the early church received
[45:43] that's why god sent a prophet in the
[45:44] last days not foster books and tips and
[45:47] say we believe a prophet but to turn our
[45:49] hearts back to the faith
[45:51] of the fathers to turn our hearts back
[45:53] to what they had back there
[45:55] because they were on their way to eden
[45:57] they were adopted sons they had god in
[46:00] them
[46:01] they had the image of god inside of them
[46:04] that's why peter could say silver and
[46:05] gold have i known such as i have i give
[46:07] it unto you rise up and walk in the name
[46:10] of jesus christ
[46:11] they were fearless they believed god
[46:14] they had signs they had wonders they had
[46:18] miracles and the bible said the lord
[46:20] himself
[46:22] went everywhere with them
[46:24] confirming the word and we are promised
[46:27] as an alpha church he is going to be an
[46:29] omega church the same holy spirit
[46:33] same holy spirit to come back upon the
[46:36] sons and daughters of god
[46:38] in the last days to bring back that same
[46:40] ministry that he had
[46:43] when he left oh give the lord some
[46:45] praises this morning
[46:46] glory
[46:48] glory
[46:50] his soul went to god
[46:52] god blessed him
[46:53] then his soul returned back in the form
[46:56] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:58] that comes into every believer
[47:01] to sanctify
[47:03] to clean up the mind
[47:04] to clean up the heart
[47:06] and leave a portion of the holy ghost
[47:08] and there
[47:09] so when the spirit
[47:11] sweeps through you
[47:13] clean up your mind
[47:14] clean up your heart and as it passed you
[47:17] leave a portion
[47:18] oh glory to god
[47:21] it leave a portion
[47:23] glory to god
[47:24] hallelujah hallelujah i know the enemy
[47:27] fight in my voice but that's okay we're
[47:30] gonna pump this world anyhow
[47:32] or give the lord some praises
[47:34] my god something gonna sweep through you
[47:36] clean up your mind
[47:38] clean up your heart
[47:40] and leave a portion how many won that
[47:42] portion today
[47:44] he promised to leave a portion inside of
[47:46] you
[47:47] a portion of himself
[47:49] in the upper room everybody got the lick
[47:51] of fire you're gonna have your own lick
[47:53] of fire you don't have to borrow fire
[47:55] from your husband you don't have to ball
[47:57] fire from your wife
[47:59] you're gonna have your own lick
[48:00] you don't have to barf high from the
[48:02] preacher you're gonna have your own lick
[48:05] you don't have to borrow fire from the
[48:06] elder or the deacon you're gonna have
[48:08] your own lick
[48:09] the same holy ghost the same fire the
[48:13] same power
[48:15] the same anointing here's jesus christ
[48:18] the same yesterday
[48:20] today and forever
[48:22] he does not change he is unchanging he
[48:26] is unvaried
[48:27] he is the same
[48:29] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[48:32] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[48:35] hallelujah
[48:36] so let's say it again his soul went to
[48:38] go on
[48:39] god blessed him then his soul returned
[48:42] back in the form of the baptism of the
[48:44] holy ghost that comes into every
[48:46] believer to sanctify to clean up the
[48:50] mind
[48:50] to clean up the heart and leave a
[48:53] portion of the holy ghost in deer
[48:55] here and here and when the holy ghost is
[48:57] given out the same holy spirit that
[49:01] brought the body of jesus out of the
[49:04] grave
[49:05] will rapture
[49:09] so this rapture is not a kind of
[49:11] imaginary thing
[49:13] it's what's inside of you is what going
[49:14] to be raptured your body going with that
[49:18] once the magnet of the holy ghost comes
[49:19] upon you
[49:21] and you have that magnetism of the holy
[49:22] ghost in you
[49:24] you have to go
[49:25] it is impossible not to go
[49:28] if you put magnet on the wood and where
[49:29] they're going no way but put the magnet
[49:31] on metal or nail or it have to stick up
[49:34] to it
[49:34] so that's what the holy ghost coming to
[49:36] do to pick you up
[49:38] that ufo coming to pick you up or give
[49:41] the lord a shout
[49:43] there'll be no way out all the bombs
[49:46] line up in russia already oh glory don't
[49:49] worry listen the material for world war
[49:51] iii they already have it they're not
[49:53] making it for world war iii it's coming
[49:56] armageddon coming famine coming pressure
[50:00] coming they they're locked down and
[50:02] closing them coming too they will close
[50:04] on the churches they're coming too but
[50:06] so is the rapture oh give the lord a
[50:08] shout in the house or give the lord some
[50:11] praises
[50:12] oh all kind of dreadness coming and may
[50:15] not feeling for fear for the things that
[50:17] coming on the earth
[50:18] but there's going to be a rapture
[50:20] let's continue so the same holy spirit
[50:24] that brought the body of jesus over to
[50:25] the grave with rapture and that covenant
[50:29] has the dovetail
[50:31] as he tore there and give the body and
[50:33] went back to god the spirit came back on
[50:35] earth
[50:36] here we go
[50:37] this is the path are you ready then
[50:41] your spirit
[50:43] will have to be the same kind of a
[50:45] spirit
[50:47] or it will miss that place of going
[50:49] together
[50:51] not because you make yourself not
[50:53] because something but because something
[50:55] the love of god has swept in your soul
[50:59] and tore every earthly idol out
[51:02] so it's not a question you stop smoking
[51:04] and stop drinking and stop running young
[51:05] woman is that that you know you stop
[51:07] doing this or you stop lasting no it's
[51:09] not that what you stop that you stop
[51:10] that
[51:11] but it's when this love
[51:13] when this spirit
[51:15] went this supernatural so we're not
[51:17] talking about joining church you go
[51:18] baptist methodist catholic church any
[51:20] church you want to go to but if
[51:21] something supernaturally happen you are
[51:23] the same person if you're not inspired
[51:25] out of what you in you are the same
[51:27] person you always was you something have
[51:29] to happen outside of you the bible said
[51:32] it this way and when the day of
[51:33] pentecost was fully come there when one
[51:36] man and one accord all of a sudden there
[51:39] was a song from heaven as a russian
[51:41] mighty wind and it filled all the house
[51:43] where they were sitting had no man
[51:45] inside a deer had no bishop inside idea
[51:48] it had no human interference inside a
[51:50] deer it was a song from heaven as a
[51:52] russian mighty pin and it filled all the
[51:55] house where they were sitting and
[51:57] tongues of fire came upon each and every
[51:59] one of them and they were filled
[52:01] somebody said film they were filled with
[52:04] the holy ghost they were filled with
[52:06] something oh glory to god hallelujah
[52:09] jesus already opened the word to them
[52:12] jesus already opened the understanding
[52:14] to them they needed more than that more
[52:17] than the opening of the word
[52:19] more than the understanding being opened
[52:20] up there needed something more than that
[52:23] he said wait and tarry in the city of
[52:25] jerusalem until you be endued with power
[52:30] from on high
[52:31] you hear where that power coming from
[52:33] that poison from your pocket that power
[52:35] isn't from your money that power isn't
[52:37] because you're old and your gray hair
[52:40] that power comes from on high
[52:42] that is coming from no pastor or no
[52:44] preacher that is power from on high this
[52:47] is the promise oh give the lord a shout
[52:50] this is a promise
[52:54] [Applause]
[52:56] not because you make yourself
[52:58] but because something the love of god
[53:00] has swept into your soul that throw
[53:03] every earthly idol out there it is and
[53:05] there is something breeds and calls to
[53:08] god
[53:09] it's your soul in here
[53:11] calling out to the heavenly father there
[53:13] you are that gives you a feet and you
[53:16] becomes the seed of abraham you believe
[53:18] god promised like abraham did do it
[53:21] lingered yet you believe it faithful
[53:24] abraham's talking about the promise of
[53:25] god true unbelief but was strong given
[53:28] praise to god
[53:29] praise be to jesus isn't that something
[53:31] tonight
[53:32] question
[53:33] brother branham i want to know the place
[53:36] where i can tie down and say this man
[53:38] has the holy ghost because he did this
[53:40] or this woman has the holy ghost because
[53:43] she did that
[53:44] question
[53:45] answer there's not a way in the world
[53:47] for you to know it
[53:48] that's right there's not a way in the
[53:50] world for you to know it god is a judge
[53:52] we are not to judge just preach the
[53:54] gospel a fellow came to me here long
[53:56] long ago i was preaching about what i
[53:58] said the other night he come to my house
[54:00] and said brother branham i wanted to get
[54:03] rid of my sins
[54:04] i want to be a christian he sat on my
[54:07] porch i heard about a great man the man
[54:11] saying this an internationally known man
[54:12] by the name of billy graham and i went
[54:15] to his meeting he said all that wants to
[54:17] become a christian hold up your hand
[54:19] accept christ as your personal savior so
[54:21] i raised up my hand i said no all stand
[54:24] we have a prayer i stayed and prayed
[54:27] just as sincere as i could be and that
[54:29] didn't do me any good
[54:31] he said when i went down to aura was
[54:33] meeting he said i heard of him and i
[54:35] heard they had all such joy so i went to
[54:38] orr's moral agency he went from billy
[54:39] graham to all of us now i asked him what
[54:42] must i do to become a christian he said
[54:44] you get back in here i told him i held
[54:47] my hand at billy graham he said you
[54:49] stayed there in that inquiry room in
[54:51] there until you are so happy till you
[54:53] speak in tongues i went in there i pray
[54:56] till i spoke with tongues i come out
[54:58] didn't do me no good
[55:00] he said when i went to another meeting
[55:01] they told me i hadn't been sanctified
[55:03] yet i have to get sanctified and get
[55:06] happy and shout get enough joy so i
[55:08] prayed and prayed and i shouted still i
[55:12] said brother this is barbara now every
[55:14] one of those things are correct every
[55:17] one of them are good hold up your hands
[55:19] speaking in tongues shouting i believe
[55:21] in every bit of it but yet that's not
[55:23] the thing
[55:24] it's accepting the person christ jesus
[55:29] these things are attributes shouting
[55:31] speaking in tongues running shouting
[55:33] crying praying whatever that attributes
[55:35] that follow
[55:37] the first thing is to accept the person
[55:40] christ jesus
[55:42] so there's no evidence that we could say
[55:44] because a man cries i've seen man cry
[55:47] and cried crocodile tears he's still
[55:49] just as a big sinner as he could be
[55:52] jesus like not says sheep is not right
[55:53] the shepherd knows his sheep anybody
[55:55] here a goat cry
[55:56] well brother you better be a shepherd if
[55:58] you're wanting a different dream a goat
[55:59] i'll go to a christ just exactly like a
[56:01] sheep let a little bitty goat get hung
[56:03] up there somewhere little sheep
[56:05] there that's the same
[56:07] i've heard them down on the altar crying
[56:09] crying oh god there's somebody like that
[56:10] oh god and i go to all the time
[56:12] this is the prophet talking about
[56:14] crying goats that's right shouting i've
[56:17] seen them shout till they run across the
[56:19] floor and jump up and down and shout you
[56:20] say brother madam you don't believe in
[56:22] crying don't take me wrong sure i
[56:25] believe in crying but i'm saying that is
[56:27] no evidence because they both cry i've
[56:30] seen them shout as hard as they could
[56:31] shout just carrying on like that and
[56:34] there's a long way you know what i'm
[56:35] talking about i hear them speak with
[56:36] tongues and go and live any kind of life
[56:38] just do anything that's no sign but you
[56:41] say you're against it no i am not i'm
[56:43] speaking in tongues it's god's gift to
[56:45] the church if i take it out i'll take
[56:47] all part of god out if i take my tongue
[56:49] my tongue with my body here i will have
[56:51] a complete body the body of cross of the
[56:53] body of jesus christ has tongues in it
[56:56] the body of jesus christ have tongues
[56:58] you take it out that's taking part of
[56:59] christ but it's accepting the person
[57:03] christ jesus and these other things come
[57:05] right on in and they fit together here
[57:08] we go let every member in this body this
[57:10] morning let this little group of people
[57:13] if we could pull the curtains down along
[57:15] on each side and every person in here
[57:17] received the peace in christ jesus
[57:20] listen
[57:20] there will never be a fuss
[57:24] there will never be no argument
[57:26] there'll be a perfect love
[57:28] yet
[57:29] you will still believe this and believe
[57:31] that
[57:34] each one accepting the person of jesus
[57:36] christ
[57:37] so then you'll be ministering from
[57:39] within that person that operational
[57:42] prison you will treat your brother right
[57:44] you will have no preference you prefer
[57:46] this one and your blood take this one
[57:47] and your blood can't stand this one you
[57:49] have no blood you have the blood of
[57:50] jesus flowing through you
[57:52] god so loved the world he loved sinners
[57:54] he loved prostitutes he loved drunkards
[57:57] he loved all of them praise god in that
[57:59] same love is what going to be working in
[58:02] you
[58:02] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[58:05] praise god i'll give you my estimation
[58:08] of what i think
[58:09] that's the closest thing to an evidence
[58:13] that a man is a christian than anything
[58:14] i know of
[58:16] you know what it is
[58:17] you say it's a travail of soul
[58:20] a person that is always
[58:24] so hungry and tasting for god
[58:27] they can't stand it simply dear night
[58:30] they've got to do something for god
[58:35] they got to do what
[58:37] something for god
[58:39] they are full of love
[58:40] they just soul travel travailing all the
[58:43] time he that go at fought in tears with
[58:46] doubtless return again bringing his
[58:48] she's behind him so i trust that this
[58:50] this answer this question and answer
[58:52] would help you
[58:53] praise god is it accepting the person of
[58:55] christ jesus
[58:57] amen so then he saw what intellectual
[59:00] fate you got to like your feet you
[59:01] believe the word and you mix it and make
[59:03] it suit your theology but once you come
[59:05] into the kingdom of god through the
[59:08] blood of the lord jesus
[59:10] meeting upon the shed blood brought
[59:12] through the testimony the public
[59:14] testimony of the you know you don't hear
[59:17] much blood preaching
[59:19] because people know the knowledge and so
[59:21] on but there's something else when you
[59:22] understand and they sing that song i
[59:24] know it was the blood one day when i was
[59:26] lost jesus died upon the cross
[59:29] understand not because
[59:31] you're handsome you're tall whatever god
[59:33] god call you no because the blood
[59:35] we only hear this morning because of
[59:37] blood
[59:38] a price was paid to give us this
[59:41] opportunity to hold on to our lifeline
[59:43] all also we in hell and loud this year
[59:46] we held in some kind of church somewhere
[59:48] but because of blood because of calvary
[59:51] calvary is still relevant the blood
[59:53] jesus chad is still relevant
[59:55] oh glory to god thank god for the blood
[59:57] oh praise god
[59:59] hallelujah praise god so let me go let's
[1:00:01] go
[1:00:02] let's go he said now watch
[1:00:04] you are here in fellowship
[1:00:07] may god can bless you
[1:00:09] that's through the blood
[1:00:11] you can shout and praise the lord and
[1:00:13] the powers of god working why
[1:00:15] it is god himself his own body the
[1:00:18] mystical body of the lord jesus christ
[1:00:20] here on earth operating here we go upon
[1:00:22] the basis of the shed blood
[1:00:25] that's why he saved the power of goddess
[1:00:27] to hit the church it wouldn't mean the
[1:00:29] prayers of the people it will be the
[1:00:30] grace of almighty god and if it
[1:00:32] recognizes grace for you and grace for
[1:00:34] your life you would recognize the grace
[1:00:36] for others
[1:00:38] oh give the lord our praise
[1:00:40] glory to god hallelujah because as soon
[1:00:42] as we get something we try to gouge the
[1:00:44] eye of somebody else out because we feel
[1:00:46] we saw right we feel we so on but you
[1:00:50] have to be careful
[1:00:51] that you have to recognize the same
[1:00:53] grace applied to you
[1:00:54] you have to apply to others
[1:00:57] praise god so it's not upon the basis of
[1:00:58] methodist or pentecostal church or any
[1:01:01] other church not upon the basis of water
[1:01:03] baptism though it's good it's right
[1:01:06] but not upon the basis of church joining
[1:01:08] joining church is good but it's upon the
[1:01:10] basis of the shed blood
[1:01:12] so when you strip it down now all the
[1:01:15] church joining baptismal that is
[1:01:17] external connections
[1:01:18] because somebody could go down
[1:01:20] will you go dry sin and come over with
[1:01:22] one after the woman wanted the same
[1:01:24] sinner
[1:01:25] because it says he basically shed blood
[1:01:27] and then holy ghost coming to to change
[1:01:30] your life
[1:01:31] and change your work because you know
[1:01:32] this is right and the fate that first
[1:01:34] come to you is intellectual faith
[1:01:36] because you're hearing the word you know
[1:01:37] that this is true the man was telling
[1:01:39] about him i want to be a christian
[1:01:40] you're not he want to be a devil you
[1:01:42] want to be a christian you don't want
[1:01:44] that temper with you you want to be a
[1:01:45] christian you don't want to be answering

[1:01:48] christian you don't want to be a
[1:01:49] bullhead the politicians and christians

[1:01:54] be a loving husband a loving father a
[1:01:57] caring person a person that have a
[1:01:58] compassion you want to be that kind of a

[1:22:09] [Applause]
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:16] [Applause]
[1:22:17] could imagine elijah
[1:22:19] keeping his eyes off elijah
[1:22:22] that's what's our problem today with the
[1:22:23] church
[1:22:24] we got too many people that's got their
[1:22:26] promise you shall receive the holy ghost
[1:22:29] but they keep one eye on the world
[1:22:31] and the other one on god
[1:22:32] you're sure to fall
[1:22:34] take your eyes off one or the other
[1:22:37] i advise you to take your eyes off the
[1:22:39] world
[1:22:40] off your neighbor
[1:22:42] off your association and keep your eyes
[1:22:44] single with christ
[1:22:46] elijah kept his eyes on elijah and while
[1:22:49] the child of fine horses came long
[1:22:51] elijah stepped up on it and went up as
[1:22:53] he went up he pulled off his mantle and
[1:22:55] he struck the jordan to make the path to
[1:22:57] death
[1:22:58] he sent back the mantle
[1:23:00] and all this was in type listen
[1:23:03] that yeah
[1:23:05] the same holy spirit
[1:23:07] that was upon him
[1:23:09] fell on the church
[1:23:11] he said the things that i do
[1:23:13] shall you do also so elijah and elisha
[1:23:16] was an anti-type
[1:23:17] of christ and the bride so as the mantle
[1:23:20] fell upon eliza and elisha did what the
[1:23:23] same works elijah did
[1:23:25] he take the mantle hit jordan jordan
[1:23:27] open up he did what elijah did well
[1:23:29] christ released the mantle
[1:23:32] on the holy ghost upon the church that
[1:23:34] your church could do the same thing
[1:23:36] do you believe that
[1:23:37] do you see what we call to do
[1:23:39] praise the name of the lord
[1:23:41] my god a double portion of the same holy
[1:23:43] ghost does upon christ is upon the
[1:23:45] church
[1:23:46] watch
[1:23:47] and the people today who claim to be
[1:23:49] filled with the holy ghost and is afraid
[1:23:51] to trust god for to take
[1:23:53] brother cross children
[1:23:55] get on the other side a double portion
[1:23:58] of the holy spirit was upon christ jesus
[1:24:00] was sent back to the church to minister
[1:24:03] and to carry on the work until we come
[1:24:05] so we are sent by god to carry on the
[1:24:08] work till jesus come
[1:24:10] not just to minister in the preaching of
[1:24:12] the word but to the same works that he
[1:24:14] did
[1:24:15] do you believe that he was raised from
[1:24:16] the dead and in in his church tonight in
[1:24:18] spiritual form given to you every bit of
[1:24:21] powers he had when he's here on earth
[1:24:22] he's handed over to the church to use
[1:24:24] and you're afraid to use it
[1:24:26] i wonder if you took that last step have
[1:24:29] you really crossed jordan
[1:24:31] this is brother brown
[1:24:33] no watch
[1:24:34] praise peter jesus so then god took his
[1:24:37] son at calvary right throw him apart he
[1:24:38] took the body to heaven sent dong on his
[1:24:41] right on the right hand he sent the holy
[1:24:43] spirit out of him and the holy spirit
[1:24:45] back on the earth and here we go and the
[1:24:47] same holy spirit that was in jesus
[1:24:49] christ will have to be operating in his
[1:24:53] church to make them coincide together at
[1:24:56] the rapture
[1:24:57] holy spirit has to be what operate and
[1:24:59] shout out britain
[1:25:02] oh yeah i mean they can't just be
[1:25:03] ministered preaching
[1:25:04] no have to be operated
[1:25:06] every gift have to be back in the church
[1:25:08] tongues prophecy interpretations
[1:25:11] healings all of that discernment every
[1:25:14] gift
[1:25:16] let me say it good every gift
[1:25:19] will be operated in the church
[1:25:21] before we leave here
[1:25:25] is there no pastor preaching and we're
[1:25:26] just going to the rapture they're going
[1:25:27] to the tribulation they're preaching the
[1:25:29] tribulation saints i call them
[1:25:34] you see if we don't say this you
[1:25:35] wouldn't expect this
[1:25:38] and you'll be deceived
[1:25:39] you will think you're okay and you're by
[1:25:41] yourself and truly to be taken um i'm
[1:25:43] tuning back wanting one left and you're
[1:25:45] going
[1:25:46] you're going straight to the tribulation
[1:25:48] you have to understand god's requirement
[1:25:50] god's requirement is that christ come
[1:25:52] back in the church
[1:25:53] the same self same spirit
[1:25:56] so you have to want that when you come
[1:25:58] you're not coming to look for who come
[1:25:59] who are tall who changed their clothes
[1:26:01] from last week and who were in the same
[1:26:02] dress this week

[1:51:00] if the holy spirit done that in the book
[1:51:02] of acts
[1:51:03] it will do the same thing today because
[1:51:06] the book of acts is not the acts of the
[1:51:08] apostles is the acts of the holy spirit
[1:51:10] in the apostles and it's the same holy
[1:51:12] spirit in the church today it would act
[1:51:14] the same way and give the same results
[1:51:17] why accept a substitute when the skies
[1:51:20] are full of reveal pentecostal power i

[1:51:56] so when god send on the spirit back upon
[1:51:58] the church was to do what continue the
[1:52:00] work
[1:52:01] so the church that goes to be the bride
[1:52:03] of jesus christ will be baptized into
[1:52:05] that same spirit
[1:52:07] with the same sign same wonders no dry
[1:52:10] church leaving

[1:52:40] selected elisha put up left because you
[1:52:43] know the mantle will pick up the bride
[1:52:45] he said this message will fall upon the
[1:52:48] predestinated and that's who you are
[1:52:50] here this morning
[1:52:51] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:52:54] [Applause]
[1:52:59] so watch
[1:53:00] he was called the messiah because he was
[1:53:02] anointed with the holy spirit and any
[1:53:04] church that's anointed with the same
[1:53:06] holy spirit is a messiah yet
[1:53:08] a little smaller god
[1:53:10] and someday when this body is
[1:53:11] resurrected i hope before that god can
[1:53:14] get a hold of a bunch of people and i
[1:53:16] love this quote that will manifest his
[1:53:19] power in every dimension that is
[1:53:22] supposed to be in
[1:53:27] let me study a little bit
[1:53:28] the prophet prophesied
[1:53:30] that missing limbs
[1:53:32] will be restored
[1:53:38] and he is praying he's saying that i i
[1:53:40] hope that god gets a whole bunch of
[1:53:42] people that will manifest his power in
[1:53:44] every dimension
[1:53:46] could imagine you missing a kidney and
[1:53:50] give unto you a kidney
[1:53:52] when you check the doctor you had one
[1:53:54] kid know here too
[1:54:00] hallelujah
[1:54:02] glory to god
[1:54:04] missing limbs
[1:54:06] could be restored i hear any amen light
[1:54:08] another i guess that is impossible
[1:54:11] when moses had to make a choice that god
[1:54:13] god said i make my mosaic he said i'm in
[1:54:15] charge of that you know
[1:54:17] i didn't want to develop devise him out
[1:54:20] i could twist your mouth i could open
[1:54:21] him out i could lose your tongue what
[1:54:23] else you have to complain about
[1:54:25] i am the designer
[1:54:27] i'm the original creator of these things
[1:54:30] so whatever you're talking about
[1:54:31] miscellaneous small thing
[1:54:33] what's up this era
[1:54:35] hallelujah she's an old woman
[1:54:38] that that them limbs are missing you
[1:54:39] know she entire body was transformed
[1:54:44] that she could come into her monthly
[1:54:45] cycle again because she was past the
[1:54:47] asia childbearing
[1:54:48] that is more than missing limb
[1:54:50] abraham was transformed sarah was so
[1:54:53] good-looking that our king tried to make
[1:54:55] taclocera he's getting interested to her
[1:54:58] wanted to drop down in his house and
[1:54:59] said restoring to my servant his wife
[1:55:03] the king saber he told me is his sister
[1:55:05] he said i know
[1:55:06] but i come to tell you every woman in
[1:55:08] your house is shut up
[1:55:10] until they restore back my servant
[1:55:12] his wife
[1:55:14] oh glory to god i know you're hard of
[1:55:16] hearing i come and talk to you
[1:55:18] hallelujah but i don't pray with my
[1:55:19] servants
[1:55:20] i suffer them to do no wrong
[1:55:23] when they were few saying touch not my
[1:55:25] anointing do my prophets know him
[1:55:28] glory to god i will take care of my sons
[1:55:31] oh glory to god oh give him some praises
[1:55:34] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:55:37] glory to god
[1:55:39] he said the holy ghost you may be seated
[1:55:41] that in this day of intellectual
[1:55:42] conception
[1:55:43] that he might be the same holy spirit
[1:55:45] proved to us
[1:55:46] that he's still the messiah
[1:55:48] the same yes since then forever
[1:55:51] now the question is do you care
[1:55:55] what do you think about it
[1:55:57] it's been proven over and over do you
[1:55:59] care enough to believe
[1:56:01] do you care enough to confess your sins
[1:56:03] that you are wrong
[1:56:05] confess your unbelief and accept it
[1:56:07] do you care enough to accept that he
[1:56:09] cared enough to die
[1:56:11] and rise again to bring it to you
[1:56:13] do you care enough to accept it
[1:56:15] oh my we ain't got time to get to all it
[1:56:17] all but you see that he cares
[1:56:19] he died that you might care
[1:56:22] that you might have a way
[1:56:24] he brought that way
[1:56:26] oh my blessed be the name of the lord
[1:56:29] amani
[1:56:31] christ has a sharp sword and watch it
[1:56:34] comes from his mouth
[1:56:36] and here is the bomb the living word
[1:56:38] so we have the written word
[1:56:41] and we have the living word
[1:56:43] which is the spoken word
[1:56:46] like he said the moses go stand there
[1:56:48] and hold the second call for flies and
[1:56:50] there was flies whatever he said he done
[1:56:52] it it come to pass his living word
[1:56:55] god
[1:56:56] and his word is the self same person
[1:57:00] god is the word and you know we keep
[1:57:02] saying that
[1:57:04] but really and truly how many people
[1:57:05] really believe that
[1:57:07] that this written word is god in print
[1:57:11] god put himself in print form
[1:57:14] called the bible
[1:57:15] as a written word
[1:57:17] and you could have faith in that written
[1:57:18] word and see god manifest himself
[1:57:22] so they could look back at scripture
[1:57:24] dania said i read of books that daniel
[1:57:26] wrote
[1:57:27] and i saw how much years to be delivered
[1:57:30] to babylon
[1:57:31] so he could refer back jesus can look at
[1:57:33] sea ice and shall not suffer my holy
[1:57:35] sick eruption or lead his soul in hell
[1:57:37] he can look and see what david wrote
[1:57:39] that's the written word and he could
[1:57:41] take the spoken word the living word and
[1:57:44] says destroy this body and treat this
[1:57:46] i'll raise it up
[1:57:48] and he is saying that based upon the
[1:57:50] written word that his body cannot see
[1:57:52] corruption it takes about three days for
[1:57:54] your body to be
[1:57:55] to get corrupt
[1:57:57] so he can take the written word and
[1:57:58] prophesy
[1:57:59] based upon what the word is written
[1:58:01] because the word is god and god can't
[1:58:03] lie
[1:58:04] oh give the lord a shout
[1:58:06] we know in the beginning was the word
[1:58:08] the word was with god and the word was
[1:58:10] god and the word made flesh and dwelt
[1:58:12] among us therefore god and his word is a
[1:58:15] self-same thing
[1:58:16] it is god in print form
[1:58:18] hallelujah and i believe there's bible
[1:58:21] to be the word of god it's god in print
[1:58:23] form then if it is god in print form you
[1:58:25] can receive it into your heart and then
[1:58:27] the holy spirit waters that seed
[1:58:30] and brings forth exactly what this
[1:58:32] promise and any kind of seed you know
[1:58:35] why because every word is a seed once
[1:58:37] it's common god's mouth is a seed so you
[1:58:39] could listen to confucius do you see us
[1:58:41] whatever any philosopher that's not
[1:58:43] god's word that is man talking
[1:58:45] philosophers and plato and socrates and
[1:58:47] whatnot that is philosophers and we
[1:58:49] could even tell it about putin in the
[1:58:50] part of our simon that is not god
[1:58:52] talking like socrates and plato and them
[1:58:54] fellas talking but you see when god
[1:58:55] speak and you receive his word that's a
[1:58:58] seed
[1:58:59] solomon is the sower and the seed is the
[1:59:01] word and once you get it out of god's
[1:59:03] mouth the spoken word that's original
[1:59:06] seed because it comes to the mouth of
[1:59:07] god and if god said you'll be delivered
[1:59:10] there is no definite hell to stop your
[1:59:11] deliverance i don't care what you have
[1:59:13] done
[1:59:14] i don't care where you have been
[1:59:16] i look at what sins you have done let
[1:59:18] god say your time has come your time has
[1:59:20] come
[1:59:23] nothing could stop that
[1:59:26] listen to this now
[1:59:27] so watch any kind of seed you sow it's a
[1:59:30] big word of a crop exactly
[1:59:32] we have sowed in this great revival a
[1:59:34] lot of intellectual seed we got an
[1:59:36] intellectual crop that's right if we
[1:59:38] were so gospel seed
[1:59:40] we would have a gospel crop
[1:59:42] we need to get back to the principles
[1:59:46] and the bible teachings back to the
[1:59:48] bible
[1:59:49] back to the holy spirit upon the word
[1:59:51] that makes the word live
[1:59:53] for the prayer
[1:59:55] now we see these signs
[1:59:57] as we see the ministry from christ
[1:59:59] beginning to narrow up now
[2:00:01] to the complete ministry
[2:00:04] in the fullness of the holy spirit
[2:00:07] homa under luther it was the same holy
[2:00:09] spirit justification the baptismal
[2:00:11] spirit now notice when a baby is born
[2:00:13] his three things contin consider but we
[2:00:15] know water blood and then life
[2:00:17] and the same thing that constitutes a
[2:00:19] new birth water blood and spirit the
[2:00:21] elements that come from his body is what
[2:00:23] make up the bride
[2:00:24] now let's not beautifully bring this in
[2:00:26] here now
[2:00:27] blood
[2:00:29] water blood spirit
[2:00:32] justification to believe in
[2:00:34] water sanification through the blood
[2:00:37] the baptism of the spirit
[2:00:39] now he's going to hook him
[2:00:40] to the baptism of the spirit and these
[2:00:42] are the words now
[2:00:44] this
[2:00:44] last great step
[2:00:47] what is he talking about
[2:00:49] the baptism of the holy spirit
[2:00:51] this last step
[2:00:53] must come into the perfection
[2:00:55] [Music]
[2:00:57] so he's pulling the baptism
[2:00:59] out of 1906
[2:01:01] out of the pentecostal ensuring this
[2:01:04] thing called the baptism of the spirit
[2:01:06] has to come into perfection
[2:01:08] what is he saying it has to add the
[2:01:10] certain things
[2:01:11] it has to go up into charity full to
[2:01:13] your knowledge and temperance and
[2:01:15] patience and godliness and brotherly
[2:01:17] kindness right
[2:01:18] that the holy spirit has to live in that
[2:01:20] church so perfectly so we can't get away
[2:01:23] from it
[2:01:24] no no man until somebody says again fix
[2:01:26] and somebody get upset and set up
[2:01:28] politics and again fight and you get
[2:01:31] them fight and fight and fight take a
[2:01:32] fight home
[2:01:34] this is not a place for that kind of
[2:01:35] fight
[2:01:36] this is what we have to have here
[2:01:38] that the holy spirit has to live in the
[2:01:41] church so perfectly it will make the
[2:01:43] head and brother body unite together
[2:01:46] that's the body he's the head
[2:01:48] oh my praise god so he said you know the
[2:01:51] grain
[2:01:52] seed in the original phillips nicer
[2:01:55] isn't that right now the life come out
[2:01:57] of the original grain come to different
[2:01:59] processes and turns back to its original
[2:02:01] condition so when you put on a seed a
[2:02:03] corn seed up comes not a corn
[2:02:05] you see a stalk
[2:02:07] and that begins to grow and you see
[2:02:09] leaves and you see growing stronger and
[2:02:10] stronger now the seeds have a life
[2:02:13] the life unfolds through processes
[2:02:16] but it's going up to bake a reproduction
[2:02:19] of the original
[2:02:20] in multiplied form
[2:02:22] so you plant one seed but you see in the
[2:02:24] growth process
[2:02:26] you can't say that the seed you have a
[2:02:28] leaf you have a stalk if you cut it you
[2:02:30] have no fruit to get you have to let it
[2:02:32] go through the process
[2:02:33] god's process for seven ages
[2:02:36] seven seals that is the bible but when
[2:02:39] it comes to the turp it get back a corn
[2:02:42] it have a shock along it it have green
[2:02:44] thing around it but in that hub have
[2:02:46] seeds and when they leave it long enough
[2:02:48] they get back a reproduction
[2:02:50] of the original grain in multiplied form
[2:02:54] oh glory to god so what god did on the
[2:02:56] day of act book of acts under their
[2:02:58] pentecost he plant the original seed on
[2:03:01] the day of pentecost and that seed went
[2:03:03] to the ground and that's he began to
[2:03:05] unfold itself first church age second
[2:03:08] church age third church age four
[2:03:10] churches fifth church eight six churches
[2:03:13] seven aged and here we are
[2:03:15] we push past the number seven and we are
[2:03:18] the bright age
[2:03:19] and in this bright age you're seeing a
[2:03:21] reproduction of the original grain in
[2:03:24] multiplied form same life same signs
[2:03:28] same holy spirit same yesterday today
[2:03:31] and forever oh give the lord a shout
[2:03:34] do you see it today
[2:03:36] oh glory to god
[2:03:38] and he said one went to make the other
[2:03:40] justification made away for
[2:03:41] certification certification made a way
[2:03:44] for the baptist holy ghost and the
[2:03:45] baptist holy ghost made a way
[2:03:48] for the holy ghost itself
[2:03:50] to come down in perfection
[2:03:52] back to the word again
[2:03:54] to manifest itself oh give the lord some
[2:03:57] praises
[2:03:58] my lord my lord
[2:04:00] my lord my lord
[2:04:02] my god we are teaching rain
[2:04:05] seed sowing rain but the word of god has
[2:04:07] been sown also
[2:04:09] mushroom seed have been shown and hear
[2:04:11] the prophecy and always bringing this
[2:04:12] back and don't fear that stale you know
[2:04:15] this estelle to me you know because god
[2:04:17] still promised it he said when the
[2:04:19] spirit of god
[2:04:21] begins to fall
[2:04:22] the word of god will live in the people
[2:04:25] oh give the lord a shout
[2:04:27] the secret is the word is and the bride
[2:04:30] we are pumping them promises into you we
[2:04:32] are prophesying into you we rented the
[2:04:35] angel we took the book we eat the book
[2:04:38] we are prophesying from the book i'm
[2:04:40] giving you prophecy of the prophecy of
[2:04:41] the prophecy is if you're going to
[2:04:43] receive it and get the word inside your
[2:04:45] soul get your word inside your heart
[2:04:47] don't let no birds take it away don't
[2:04:49] let the light choke it or give the lord
[2:04:51] a shout about your water with your
[2:04:53] praises
[2:04:55] when the spirit of god
[2:04:57] begins to fall
[2:04:59] listen
[2:05:02] then we'll be living the people right
[2:05:04] here what else is going to happen in the
[2:05:05] spirit falls
[2:05:06] when they spread forwards they'll come
[2:05:08] and move among the people
[2:05:09] them the normal nationals will swing
[2:05:11] together just as certain as i'm standing
[2:05:14] in the pulpit and the church of god will
[2:05:16] be ousted
[2:05:17] so the anointing that comes not only
[2:05:19] come for it to live in you
[2:05:21] but it coming upon to enforce the mark
[2:05:24] of the beast
[2:05:25] the shortening of the churches that
[2:05:27] preach this kind of message it will be
[2:05:29] christ reproduced it could be joseph
[2:05:31] again rejected it will be christ again
[2:05:33] rejected god's masterpiece
[2:05:36] in the bride
[2:05:37] hallelujah do you believe that
[2:05:40] watch remember there will come such a
[2:05:42] international gathering pretty soon
[2:05:44] it will be terrific
[2:05:46] and they will bring themselves together
[2:05:47] in this federation of churches and this
[2:05:49] kind of church will be put out of our
[2:05:51] operation
[2:05:52] as far as they know
[2:05:55] so closing down this building doesn't
[2:05:56] mean they're closing on us
[2:05:57] they can't close young the bride
[2:05:59] which is christ in you
[2:06:01] because wherever you go christ is going
[2:06:03] to
[2:06:04] oh glory to god hallelujah so they will
[2:06:06] close us down as far as they know
[2:06:09] all right it's at that time that jesus
[2:06:12] will appear and he will show which is by
[2:06:14] them which is not and remember christian
[2:06:16] friends i'm a man
[2:06:17] i can make mistakes but god being god
[2:06:20] you cannot make a mistake all the words
[2:06:22] have been written
[2:06:24] must be fulfilled and jesus said so this
[2:06:27] must be fulfilled that is one thing this
[2:06:30] boycott to come
[2:06:33] it's a boycott coming right
[2:06:35] but before this boycott has come
[2:06:38] before
[2:06:39] it come
[2:06:40] of the market of the beast there's got
[2:06:42] to be a seed sown
[2:06:44] so god could take a church out of it
[2:06:46] so god couldn't take the pentecostals
[2:06:49] because they rejected the word and they
[2:06:51] didn't have the seed so god sent a
[2:06:53] prophet to reveal the son of man the
[2:06:56] sower of the good seed to put seed in
[2:06:58] you because the seed in you is what god
[2:07:01] coming back for
[2:07:03] oh glory
[2:07:05] do you see it by the jesus christ
[2:07:10] before the boy could come you may be
[2:07:11] seasoned before the closer is done
[2:07:13] before they shut us down and say okay i
[2:07:15] preach
[2:07:15] we have to have a seat soon to get the
[2:07:18] bride out
[2:07:19] oh glory to god they have to have a
[2:07:20] wrapped in faith seat so because i take
[2:07:22] more faith than normal
[2:07:24] to leave here isn't that right so before
[2:07:26] this boycott can come
[2:07:28] of the marking of the beast there has
[2:07:29] got to be a seat shown for god to take
[2:07:33] the church out
[2:07:34] brother continue now almost done music
[2:07:37] on please
[2:07:38] now remember
[2:07:39] malachi 4 the message come to terribly
[2:07:41] of the lord right that never happened
[2:07:43] with john
[2:07:44] okay
[2:07:45] now watch
[2:07:46] he is going to take the faith restore
[2:07:48] the fate of the children
[2:07:50] back
[2:07:50] to the original pentecostal tree
[2:07:53] that the canker won't eat up
[2:07:55] roman conqueror caterpillar all the
[2:07:57] denomination creates it down god said
[2:07:59] i'll restore it again in the last days
[2:08:01] and it will be restored
[2:08:03] god
[2:08:05] shall send the holy ghost
[2:08:07] in such a way
[2:08:09] upon planted words
[2:08:12] that will restore
[2:08:13] this part is important and but the
[2:08:15] parents talk about it in the promising
[2:08:17] exhortation
[2:08:18] he couldn't send the holy ghost the
[2:08:20] person of the holy ghost upon the
[2:08:22] pentecostals because they didn't have
[2:08:23] wood
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:28] i like how the terminology used here
[2:08:30] upon planted wood now you could have
[2:08:32] corn on top of this dessert right now in
[2:08:34] a bag
[2:08:35] and you know how the plan is going you
[2:08:36] know
[2:08:37] you're putting in the back pocket how
[2:08:38] the plan is going you know
[2:08:40] dino planted corn
[2:08:42] nice corn in your pocket
[2:08:44] that's corn in a bag
[2:08:45] until that corn going to the ground it's
[2:08:48] just gone
[2:08:49] the other day sometimes they find some
[2:08:51] corn or something from egypt hundreds of
[2:08:53] years old and they planted it and grow
[2:08:56] so you could have it in storage
[2:08:58] and remain intact with the life inside
[2:09:00] of it
[2:09:01] so when he said planted wood this thing
[2:09:02] have a people to receive it
[2:09:04] this would have to come in you
[2:09:06] so all these years you have to preach
[2:09:08] this word
[2:09:09] which is precious promises
[2:09:11] you're fighting up you're struggling but
[2:09:13] we preaching that word
[2:09:14] the word was in the disciples you say
[2:09:16] father they have received that word and
[2:09:18] peter was going deny him
[2:09:22] dice human spirit and mess up things but
[2:09:25] the word wasn't peter
[2:09:26] peter couldn't be
[2:09:28] he can't be undiscipled he's no longer
[2:09:30] disciple he's a denier i don't know him
[2:09:33] at all
[2:09:34] say but you look like you when the
[2:09:35] church up there are churchill i think i
[2:09:36] saw you
[2:09:38] they even welcome you on sunday morning
[2:09:39] and welcome you to the church said i i
[2:09:41] don't know i don't know about you i
[2:09:42] don't know i never went there
[2:09:46] and when the third time when they called
[2:09:47] pete out he said the curse
[2:09:49] then he said no he can't be a christian
[2:09:50] christian
[2:09:53] then peter wept italy
[2:09:55] peter went bitterly because he couldn't
[2:09:58] handle it but you see jesus getting
[2:09:59] licks he's injurious going crucified he
[2:10:01] said
[2:10:02] i can't handle it
[2:10:03] when peter time comes he said don't let
[2:10:05] me close the valley tell me upside down
[2:10:07] you ready to face the music now why you
[2:10:09] power him
[2:10:13] and god promised you
[2:10:15] that no no no not yet that same
[2:10:18] shout out
[2:10:20] god promised you that same power
[2:10:22] not another kind you know
[2:10:24] same kind
[2:10:25] power to strengthen you
[2:10:27] power to be the inner man but when they
[2:10:30] beat you and try to stop you you can
[2:10:32] still come to church power and rain
[2:10:34] falling you can still personally come to
[2:10:35] church and don't use that excuse rain
[2:10:37] falling they can't come to church no no
[2:10:39] no no use a dry weather question what
[2:10:41] kind of question is that
[2:10:42] put on a coat put an arm below
[2:10:45] whatever you had to do
[2:10:46] get the church
[2:10:48] oh give the lord some praises
[2:10:50] don't stay human backslide get in the
[2:10:53] church
[2:10:54] glory to god hallelujah let's go
[2:10:58] national force will put the church in
[2:11:00] the world conquered churches but the
[2:11:02] power of god will put the people in the
[2:11:05] pride do you want to be in a bride
[2:11:07] i'm going to close but
[2:11:11] seven asian messages to open the mystery
[2:11:12] of the seals
[2:11:14] calling the 11th hour gentile workers
[2:11:16] to receive the same pay
[2:11:18] so we could be viewed as the people that
[2:11:20] got
[2:11:21] a five o'clock offer
[2:11:23] to work for one hour
[2:11:25] and when pay time come
[2:11:27] simply
[2:11:29] jesus taught it he said there were some
[2:11:31] people went into the harvest they were
[2:11:33] hired
[2:11:34] early in the morning to receive time a
[2:11:37] penny for the day
[2:11:38] that is what they up
[2:11:40] what they accepted the contract was i
[2:11:42] accept
[2:11:43] to work for the day for a penny
[2:11:46] right
[2:11:47] and at noon time someone has come in
[2:11:49] went to work then we left our last hour
[2:11:51] of the day
[2:11:53] because after that hour five six
[2:11:55] darkness you know it can't work in the
[2:11:57] dark it's like the final all these these
[2:11:59] guys come who was lying
[2:12:03] who was idle
[2:12:06] they wasn't there when the children were
[2:12:07] built
[2:12:10] he was they wasn't there before they
[2:12:12] leave
[2:12:13] all he had said now
[2:12:14] and they come in last
[2:12:17] watches
[2:12:18] and so perfectly what does someone come
[2:12:21] in and receive the same kind of pay that
[2:12:22] they had at the first holiday
[2:12:24] it was so perfectly how the first hour
[2:12:26] messengers with the word with the gospel
[2:12:28] with the truth they came into their
[2:12:30] pentecost and there was a dark age that
[2:12:32] blocked them out at the middle of the
[2:12:33] day luther wesley and them came in and
[2:12:35] then there's to be an even time message
[2:12:38] to receive the same thing
[2:12:40] that he did at the beginning
[2:12:42] the evening time message is to restore
[2:12:44] back again to bring back the same thing
[2:12:47] again
[2:12:48] hallelujah
[2:12:49] and the prophet said oh my
[2:12:52] praise god thank you jesus
[2:12:55] know how the church has said some in the
[2:12:58] church to the libertines how they get
[2:13:01] tremendous sometimes
[2:13:03] when a church has grown in under the
[2:13:05] persecution

[2:13:09] lord jesus that the promise of the holy
[2:13:11] ghost is just as real to us
[2:13:15] as it was
[2:13:16] to pentecost
[2:13:17] how they grown and cry
[2:13:19] under labor pains but when they are born
[2:13:23] and positionally born
[2:13:25] into the kingdom of god then the holy
[2:13:28] ghost has set in the church some
[2:13:30] apostles
[2:13:31] some prophets

[2:13:35] some evangelists and given today are
[2:13:37] speaking with tongues interpretation of
[2:13:39] tongues knowledge wisdom gifts of
[2:13:41] healing all kind of miracles what must
[2:13:44] you believe in that the holy ghost
[2:13:46] is just as real
[2:13:48] as when it had at a pentecost it's the
[2:13:50] same holy ghost
