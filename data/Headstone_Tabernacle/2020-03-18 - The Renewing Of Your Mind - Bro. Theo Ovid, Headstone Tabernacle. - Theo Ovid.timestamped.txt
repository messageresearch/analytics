[23:07] thing but Isaac redditor and Sunday I
[23:09] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[23:12] mercies of God that you present your
[23:15] bodies a living sacrifice holy
[23:18] acceptable unto God which is your
[23:22] reasonable service and be not conformed
[23:26] to this world but be transformed by the

[23:37] perfect will of God
[23:38] that's pretty father we thank you for

[23:55] amen god bless you may be seated
[23:57] our title the renewing of your mind
[24:01] that's a title tonight the renewing of
[24:04] your mind I was so blessed on Sunday I
[24:08] don't have words to describe how I felt
[24:13] about Sunday service it was such a
[24:15] tremendous blessing to me and now and
[24:18] something the Holy Spirit was speaking
[24:20] about thinking and when Isaac and
[24:24] afterwards I was telling myself no that
[24:27] wasn't on your notes that no he didn't
[24:28] write that that just come my pure
[24:30] inspiration he was the cap for me was
[24:33] when he's talking about Joshua and Caleb
[24:34] and here the ten spies is the same line
[24:38] seen groups same God sent him out and
[24:42] they had no interaction with the Giants
[24:45] so therefore it wasn't as if they were
[24:47] intimidated by the Giants is a matter of
[24:50] what they told themselves so they told
[24:52] themselves we not able to take it they
[24:57] told themselves that the Giants to greet
[25:00] the totems of jazz until supposedly
[25:04] answers walking with
[25:05] Heartfilia bad hat
[25:08] suppose they was behind one by one group
[25:12] they interviewed Giants is saying well
[25:14] you have had condition you're bigger
[25:17] ready you know how long you will last
[25:18] doctor and the Giants in well I quit
[25:21] I couldn't just no you know the
[25:22] instructor chance all they tell
[25:25] themselves we cannot take it and what
[25:28] they thought affect the people what they
[25:33] preach affect the people what they
[25:37] thought affect the people because when
[25:44] Joshua new killer came back to the camp
[25:46] there was a bet anointing that was there
[25:48] a depressive anointing that was there
[25:51] and it was over the whole people because
[25:54] they bought a report now I bring
[25:57] industry sharing the power of words and
[25:59] the power of influence over lines and
[26:03] Vava - hallelujah so if a negative word
[26:08] that came from a negative thought could
[26:12] producers and oppressive atmosphere
[26:15] what would a positive world that come
[26:19] from the intelligence what kind of
[26:22] atmosphere is that supposed to produce
[26:24] then that could produce some affect and
[26:27] influence upon your life that will do
[26:30] make you do great things for the kingdom
[26:34] because that's the most important thing
[26:37] if you're big you can see it you will
[26:38] come out of your selfishness and you
[26:41] will see the kingdom of God is at hand
[26:44] what are you doing about God's kingdom
[26:47] because what I want purposed to promote
[26:49] his kingdom not do you miss kingdom he's
[26:54] blessing you for the kingdom he's adding
[26:56] to you for the kingdom
[26:59] doing here amen tonight he is making a
[27:02] way for you that you could be used for
[27:04] the kingdom or glory of God hallelujah
[27:08] we preach a kingdom message because our
[27:11] king is coming
[27:13] Oh glory my king must have a domain he
[27:18] must have a Dominion you yet about the
[27:21] Saudi or what not and they talk about
[27:22] the Prince of Sunday
[27:23] I'll talk about the kingdom say and the
[27:25] kingdom say I always smile when I hear
[27:26] about how they stop by the Saudis what
[27:29] they see is a kingdom never King the
[27:31] kingdom see this on the kingdom say that
[27:33] what about the kingdom of God do we do
[27:38] know your name and Birmingham taught us
[27:41] that the Hebrew word for former is mori
[27:45] isn't that right there's teaching Reem
[27:47] and there is inspiration rain and he
[27:50] taught us that they will have former and
[27:51] latter in in the first at the same time
[27:54] for marine and latter rain we have been
[27:57] under teaching green and hardly people
[27:59] looking for the latter mean some people
[28:01] feel they have it already because what
[28:02] we've enlisted him and opened this to
[28:04] them and Irena what that but that is not
[28:06] what the Prophet taught us he pauses the
[28:08] Lateran is coming our promise is coming
[28:11] I mean it's so boring but it's still the
[28:14] truth they come like Abraham after ten
[28:18] years
[28:18] Abraham preaching Isaac coming it's on
[28:21] in borås but that was coming it's just
[28:23] 15 more years later after 20 years you
[28:26] see Isaac preaching is a measure the
[28:28] people said repeatedly same day over and
[28:29] over it's like boil an egg frying egg
[28:31] poach an egg assuming the same
[28:34] charity same dynamics simply because
[28:37] feel on a half of the Chinese ticket how
[28:39] they wanna flip it is the same promise
[28:41] is dynamics is Lateran it's all work in
[28:44] a bridge I've seen you want read the
[28:47] preaching water under under sacrifice
[28:50] you're looking for fire
[28:51] or glory of God Alleluia or glory not
[28:55] going to give a transforming power

[43:47] Hawaii is just one team it didn't bring
[43:50] back a report but I said Joshua okay
[43:52] maybe another spirit with him the
[43:56] atmosphere Robin was different they
[43:58] didn't talk to the Giants and he
[44:00] attended top designs not in total Giants
[44:02] but these guys come up with a different
[44:04] testimony and Baron says kill about the

[44:38] Kiera buddy RC and God seen

[1:13:44] praise God so you know what happened the
[1:13:47] mind was chosen at the battleground the
[1:13:49] police were selected to fight because
[1:13:52] that is where the decisions are made in
[1:13:54] the mind so that is where God put it for
[1:13:57] you to get fight who would win the
[1:14:00] choice of what you accept and what you
[1:14:01] reject isn't that right the human mind
[1:14:04] was chosen for the place of the battle I
[1:14:06] cannot fight in my mind the ground you
[1:14:11] don't understand what going on but that
[1:14:13] is the Conqueror chosen you suppose the
[1:14:15] girl fight every day suppose be fighting
[1:14:18] fighting like a mushroom is just like

[1:14:50] I catch a active
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:52] Oh glory to God amen Humana was chosen
[1:14:58] for the peace of the battle because
[1:15:00] we're that way it was begin
[1:15:02] that is because decisions are made from
[1:15:04] the mind the head they never started
[1:15:06] from some organization praise God and
[1:15:09] there was a woman who was sick and a
[1:15:11] pallet dear in about a ramp we should
[1:15:13] message the great battle before and I
[1:15:14] keep reaching and looking at her we
[1:15:16] should not look another bite I'm
[1:15:17] finished she what she could become ready
[1:15:20] on the ground no you could see what you
[1:15:23] want you seen on your seat you had that
[1:15:24] nut but in you because he only grown and
[1:15:26] she want to walk she want to come on her
[1:15:29] condition and when he finished she was
[1:15:31] free man just get up and walk off did
[1:15:35] not even pray for her she overcome right
[1:15:37] there and you could overcome right in
[1:15:39] your seat Oh glory to God nothing
[1:15:43] changes the decision you decide to save
[1:15:45] God Almighty not because of your husband
[1:15:48] not because they are children not
[1:15:49] because their mother father whatever it
[1:15:51] is but because of him he called you
[1:15:53] equality for a purpose and that purpose
[1:15:54] is about everything else all glory to
[1:15:57] God amen we are body soul and spirit the
[1:16:00] outside the body the shell inside of the
[1:16:02] conscience of art and then it's the soul
[1:16:04] soul the spirit and spirit governs the
[1:16:06] other you can accept doubt or you can
[1:16:08] accept feet either one you want to work
[1:16:10] on
[1:16:11] therefore system began at the principle
[1:16:12] part that caused the spirit of man the
[1:16:15] doll God's Word
[1:16:16] that's what Seaton did and God begin at
[1:16:19] the principle part the lay his would in
[1:16:22] that spirit so she a time job is a
[1:16:24] convinced her to bring down so first he
[1:16:27] asked Eve what did God say what are you
[1:16:28] going so become God not talking to me
[1:16:29] and she innocently saying God say we
[1:16:32] should eat to the tree but I shall not
[1:16:35] sure I wish I shall not eat because a
[1:16:37] day we eat we shall die then says you
[1:16:39] shall not surely time God knows you know
[1:16:42] when you eat that tree you shall be you
[1:16:47] know both sides which was information
[1:16:50] and knowledge and moving either way from
[1:16:53] feet because all she knows to do was
[1:16:55] believer God said as usual test it and
[1:16:57] God's a visually dying so talks focused
[1:16:59] Teddy story walking I'm not accepting a
[1:17:03] different test
[1:17:04] concerning what God said if God said it
[1:17:06] I may not understand it but I believe it
[1:17:08] and as long as coming out of perfect
[1:17:10] smoke I believe it because my prophet
[1:17:13] doesn't speak his own thoughts save a
[1:17:15] property speak it it has to come to pass
[1:17:17] I don't need a full explanation of it if
[1:17:19] I got a revelation that's fine but if I
[1:17:21] still wanna start it I believe it and
[1:17:24] what he was supposed to say if this
[1:17:27] church right now can be put together
[1:17:28] knitted together I was such that
[1:17:31] everyone would be in one Accord not one
[1:17:34] shuttle or anywhere there would not be a
[1:17:36] feeble please enormous in another five
[1:17:39] minutes there would not be nobody a
[1:17:41] desiring the Holy Ghost but what we
[1:17:43] receive it if we could get a certain
[1:17:45] thing fixed
[1:17:46] now there is where the battle begins
[1:17:48] right in your own mind it's not

[1:28:30] comes tolerable she was able to overcome
[1:28:33] because she changed her thinking on the
[1:28:38] matter the Cyprus in the boat storm

[1:29:23] that you could do the other don't you
[1:29:25] want to have faith to do this do that to
[1:29:27] the other this is faith isn't living
[1:29:29] with it now
[1:29:30] these are faith that is life all glory
[1:29:33] to God amen
[1:29:35] so you have to close the channels or my
[1:29:38] I'm gonna close when God gets a man in
[1:29:41] his hands till he can get the senses the
[1:29:44] conscience and everything in doubt until
[1:29:46] it stands with God behind it in the
[1:29:49] spirit there is not a parallel world
[1:29:51] kombucha
[1:29:53] when court could get a man not even your
[1:29:56] conscience even going out the food is so
[1:29:58] clear it shows Alleluia the Auckland
[1:30:00] Blues are whistling glory to God it
[1:30:01] shines out just clean and clear it's the
[1:30:04] park on the main is the gate to the soul
[1:30:06] the gate to the spirit rather your mind
[1:30:09] opens up and accept the spirit or reject
[1:30:11] the spirit you can have these
[1:30:13] consciousness and little feelings and
[1:30:15] sensations all these things that has not
[1:30:16] agree with it that's just sensation but
[1:30:18] when it comes to reality your mind opens
[1:30:21] it up your mind either accept it or
[1:30:23] reject it he said Oh God
[1:30:25] may not miss it it's your mind that open
[1:30:28] up the door or closes the door and
[1:30:31] listen to your conscience listens to
[1:30:33] your memory listens to your affection
[1:30:36] but when your mind closes itself to
[1:30:38] these things and let God the spirit of
[1:30:41] God the word come in it blows the rest
[1:30:44] of the stuff out every doctor's gone
[1:30:46] every fear is gone every sensation is
[1:30:48] dog is gone every feeling is gone
[1:30:50] nothing standard about the Word of God
[1:30:52] and see that coming buckle against that
[1:30:54] or somebody completely blue no there is
[1:30:58] a woman a physical and there's a woman
[1:31:00] for this spirit did you believe that
[1:31:02] there's a spiritual womb and there's a
[1:31:04] physical womb the mind is the womb to
[1:31:07] the Spirit how adultery is committed
[1:31:14] spiritually when you knowing better by
[1:31:18] the Word of God by the intercourse of
[1:31:20] your mind take a lie of the devil and
[1:31:23] again and that's what I'm saying when
[1:31:24] Eve receives the devil line her nature
[1:31:27] changed immediately it was instant when
[1:31:32] Adam forsake the word he lost the earth
[1:31:35] immediately because God no longer
[1:31:38] control of him he had no more control of
[1:31:40] the earth as long as globodyne control
[1:31:42] of america control the earth once he
[1:31:44] lost the control he lost the book lost
[1:31:47] the authority lost dominion
[1:31:49] when the restoration of the book come
[1:31:51] the restoration of the control of God
[1:31:53] over your life that's why he said the
[1:31:55] bride will have the mind of Christ the
[1:31:57] intelligence that means the control
[1:31:59] combat over which is
[1:32:01] ship to govern the body so when the
[1:32:04] headship comes to govern the body then
[1:32:06] God have control over you then you will
[1:32:08] have dominion over others and other
[1:32:10] things about you Oh glory to God
[1:32:12] hallelujah praise be to Jesus so we are
[1:32:16] sown with the word someday it will bring
[1:32:18] the life into the earth it'll replenish
[1:32:20] the earth where he failed Mary did she
[1:32:23] took the word if top sitting like Mary
[1:32:25] took God's Word and to Mary seed
[1:32:27] replenishes it again to his pride true
[1:32:30] the word will bring up the Millennium
[1:32:32] therefore on the same thesis she could
[1:32:34] take God's Word and said God said not to
[1:32:37] do it get away from here not what I mean
[1:32:39] all right but instead she's like a
[1:32:40] hybrid with season line Mary didn't do
[1:32:42] that she said be done unto me I wanted I
[1:32:44] would oh my hallelujah watch I'm almost
[1:32:49] done they talking about loitering not
[1:32:51] discarding you laughter in bedroom
[1:32:52] that's not Nazarene if the Lateran would
[1:32:54] have been here the poor gloater struck
[1:32:56] that thing she would have struck the
[1:32:57] world then loitering is fixin to come
[1:33:00] and I say tonight the latter rain is
[1:33:03] fixin to come
[1:33:04] Oh blow in the Lord we have got to do
[1:33:06] something to make ourselves in it keep
[1:33:08] your hands off of it let God do it take
[1:33:11] his word believe it wallet in your heart
[1:33:13] and when the real begins the fall life
[1:33:15] will take a whole and the word will
[1:33:17] manifest itself you're manufacturing
[1:33:21] hallelujah no manufacturing just speak
[1:33:24] in the word and I was listen to her tape
[1:33:26] we talked about he preached the word and
[1:33:27] people just was healed just like the
[1:33:29] book being preached this is what I look
[1:33:31] at machine not even hands leave not even
[1:33:33] hands laid not hands laid just the word
[1:33:36] going for the promise was not only made
[1:33:43] to Abraham and his seed not your seat

[1:33:47] seed the faith that he had here we go no
[1:33:50] matter what the circumstances was how
[1:33:52] against nature it was how much the
[1:33:54] doctor said it wasn't so Abraham had the
[1:33:56] promise given to him when it was
[1:33:57] impossible oh praise God and if the
[1:33:59] church is sold with something else
[1:34:01] beside the word it can't go to meet him
[1:34:04] he hasn't got a free body with fungus on
[1:34:06] it
[1:34:07] he's got a perfect body he's the perfect
[1:34:09] word and the church will be showed and
[1:34:11] believed in the perfect word and the
[1:34:14] perfect word and the perfect world will
[1:34:16] unite together one flesh one body
[1:34:18] husband and wife I am not even in myself
[1:34:20] I believe it anyhow the former a man
[1:34:24] thought there we go
[1:34:25] the faith the ribs is fixin to fall what
[1:34:29] just gonna pray for you watch this seems
[1:34:31] fun that rise in the West is when
[1:34:33] horizon with what the Sun is should Nino
[1:34:35] in the Western Hemisphere
[1:34:37] to what here we go to ripen the seed
[1:34:40] that has been planted to bring forth a
[1:34:43] bride if you do not have those seeds to
[1:34:46] be something if you do not have to seize
[1:34:49] if you're here tonight are you not a
