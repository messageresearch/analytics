frustration what are you going to raise up from what you have been through and accept what god has already done what are you going to raise up from your negative past and look into a bright future like somebody said my future is so bright i need shades to look at it when you're gonna raise up oh glory to god from defeat and tell yourself you ordained for victory i say today is a special day oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah today i'm going to find out about you that you never knew before oh hallelujah there's something about you that you need to be told i never told you what you're going to hear this morning can we give the lord a shout this morning oh you're here to get excited about what god has promised oh you're not excited about your failures and shortcomings you're defeated you're dumb enough news for you we were all born in sin shape of iniquity oh we have the same condition but jesus he dropped your charges jesus he dismissed your case jesus he made a way of jesus he's a waymaker he's a provider when you have no joy to give you joy this happened and that happened but god is a problem solver he lifts us up the dung hill he put us on a rock he put us on an anchor he put us and gave us a joy in our hearts to stay hallelujah hallelujah glory you may be seated we all know we're out of here you know i expected that ten percent say you know people don't believe that the people leave it here permanently so why some people want a destination for joy when i get this when i get back when i reach here when i have that it's not the destination of a rival it's the journey it's the journey you have to enjoy the journey the ups the dawn the ziggs the zags the trials the temptation the testing you have to enjoy the journey right now if you can't join right now when you don't get it when you get the car when you get a host when you get a car you have payments to be on the car come on you better enjoy what you enjoy right now oh glory to god that's why paul was a prisoner of jesus christ the roman prison couldn't lock him up you've got to be jailed by god you got to be arrested by love you got to be wrapped up that nothing will trouble you out here you're born to pass through hell and go untouched and go unscathed the devil have hell on the earth but when hell come on the earth heaven comes down also we thank god that we have backups we thank god the angel of god and camp around those that fear him i'm just talking to you i want to test your praise and temperature come to put down the thermometer of faith i want to feel something and then we're going to go into the world we're going to read the scripture you can't sit on me dead oh hallelujah god is not dead he's a man if your god is dead praise god our god is not there's worship hosanna hosanna hosanna there are seraphs there is there are praises and thanksgiving angels singing shouting there's shouts in heaven every shouts in hell oh you're going to worship all that girl in the earth going to worship the beasts at those who are gathered here tonight whose names are written in lamb's book of life you gotta worship something maybe you worship your wife maybe worship your money maybe worship a cat maybe worship your job but you're gonna worship something but we know what people shall we know why we worship yes we know who we worship it has been revealed it's no longer a mystery oh hallelujah hallelujah womanly our common always when the true worshippers you have a problem worship you have a condition worship you want to get a raise worship you want to get delivered read worship let's all stand and give god a big shout to praise [Music] i like to turn the bibles to romans chapter 9 and ephesians chapter 1 two portion scriptures this morning we would read ephesians first just verse 3-5 and also return to switch to romans 9. first tree of ephesians blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ in ephesians 1 verse 3. according as he had chosen us in him when before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love verse having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will romans chapter 9 want to read from verse 6 we read not as though the word of god had not have none effect for thee are not all israel which are of israel neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall i see be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise accounted for the seed for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and say i shall have a son and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it it was said unto her the elder shall save the younger that is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated let's pray father we thank you for your word and any man could read the word but to take the spirit to come and bring light and life to it father may your word truly be a lamp onto our feet and a light to our parts that we can see where to put our feet this morning our feet of faith further anoint your people anoint those everyone within our gates that they may have ears to hear your word your truth and be transformed by the very word itself come down in our midst and confirm the word with signs and wonders and miracles transform lives homes and families and we'll be careful to give her the underglory we ask in jesus name amen you may be seated well praise the lord blessed be the name of the lord i have a title this morning nothing can defeat the purpose of god according to election amen that's my title this morning nothing can defeat the purpose of god according to election i have a subject fate in the finished work and i have an inspiration from ecclesiastes chapter 3 1 to everything is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven so i took all inspiration from there there is a season and a time to every purpose there's a season and time to every purpose nothing can defeat the purpose of god is not right the bible tells us that the children not yet born neither haven't done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it verse 18 therefore you have mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he hardened he will harden it isn't that right verse 17 for the scriptures here unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised the up that i might show my power indeed that my name might be declared throughout all the earth oh hallelujah raised up for a purpose hallelujah praise god do you believe that matthew 24 21 and then there shall be great tribulation and such was not since the beginning of the world to this time no ever shall be and accept those days shall be shortened there shall be no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened so there is an elect on the earth in case you didn't know you're gonna know this morning there's an elect on the earth she is chosen in him not now since before the foundation of the world and all that well on the earth going to worship the beast except those whose names are written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world so they got the common unfolding of the book to reveal to you that your name is on that book and when you see your name you cannot be the same when you know you are one in a million when you know millions were lost when you were called and you were called for his honor and his glory what he purposed in himself not what you choose but he chose you in himself and predestinated or predetermined that you'll be adopted not of your works not of your past not of your sins not of your failures but that election might stand and when god elect the people before the foundation of the world there is no devil could defeat the purpose that god raised you up for you are being raised up for a divine purpose and i want to tell you this morning nothing will stop it not your past not your sins not your failures not your problems not your condition not what family come from nothing will defeat the purpose of god according to election give the lord a shout people i don't care if you're tired and you're half dead this morning nothing on the feet [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah glory praise the lord we not crazy we are just excited about the promises that we have oh hallelujah are you with me okay let's go hallelujah when god speaks anything it's forever truth god cannot alter that that's what make him god according to the politician he doesn't have this constitutional feature change this is morning note my word oh god is settled in the heaven psalms 1 19 89 forever o lord thy word is settled in heaven so god have settled in the heaven from the end to the beginning and the prophets they get in the spirit and they go up into the heavens and pull along the word for the age so noah pull on his word it's gonna rain pull on his word take the blood and put it on the doorpost every prophet every generation you have to go up in the heavens and pull on the word for the age and this morning we have a word for our age that came down mighty angel brought back the full revealed word now we have tossed it at the lord for age and we are walking in a john saw vision but we are seeing the reality of the vision that john saw john could only say i saw and i looked and i saw and i looked and i saw and i looked but you are living in what john saw he saw a people for glory to god a multitude out of many tongues and nations saying worthy is the lamb that took the book and lose the seven shields that is what john saw he saw you rejoice him he saw you shouting he saw you getting a revelation of who you are and who your father is and where you come from and where you're going the one that john said all in heaven all under the earth that i praise god oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah you have something to praise god about let me see [Applause] yes your problems yes yes they are trans and they never want to put a dark cloud over you because of your situation your children your wife family whatever you can't worship you can't praise god you can't worship one time disciples came back victory over devils victory from cast no devils and they came back happened rejoicing and jesus told them don't rejoice but don't rejoice for that hear what to rejoice about rejoice because your name is written rejoice because your name [Applause] you see that word name goes deep that name is personal identification of who you are if there's a john jones in here i said could john jones stand up everybody cannot stand up only john john could stand up so when he said name you mean individual when he's a name he's talking about thought attribute in other words nobody could be your thought therefore nobody could be your word and the word is a thought express so god was thinking about you in the back part of his mind before the foundation of the world and when he spoke the word he expressed you in the word so when you come to church they come to hear about your expression because you come to hear the word of what not what you are but what you are going to become because that is what the devil is afraid of the devil is not afraid of what you are the devil's afraid of what you are about to become you will be seated because the whole creation is groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of god because the creation once had a ruler his name was adam the creation once had a god on the earth adam was a god on the earth ruled by a master the creation was but when man fell creation just let go but creation is waiting for the masters of the earth to step forward once again because god in the beginning let us make man all in our image after our likeness and let that man have dominion oh glory to god could we give the lord some praises that's the kind of man that god made a man in authority a man in position a man with power a man having dominion over that's the kind of man that god made [Music] [Applause] hallelujah my lord what does that thought express and when god once thought of how we make the plan of redemption how do we redeem man by foreknowledge knowing that someone desired and some would be redeemed he thought of the plan when he spoke the word listen it was already a finished work in heaven when god spoke it [Applause] your deliverance finish your victory finish your healing finish that's why i said by your stripe i was healed not will be was healed because it's already done hallelujah are you with me lord fine among christian american christians he said now it's a fear it seems to be afraid that god won't keep his word it's nothing that you can do in the beginning it's what god has done you never sought god though you thought you did but the bible claims you didn't no man seeks god this nature from the garden of eden proves he's a coward and runs when he sins it wasn't adam calling god it was god calling adam and the bible says that your name was written on the book of life isn't that right before the foundation of the world the bible said that the the devil deceive all that dwell on the earth except those whose names are not written deceive the popes the presidents the kings the potentials deceive the professors and the colleges these teachers lawyers doctors deceive all so if your name is in the book you could be mad i'm scraggly you could be madame same clothes every sunday same clothes every day washing the same clothes your name on that book you better shout you better rejoice you could have no money in your pocket that has nothing to do [Applause] oh hallelujah everything i've gone is a finished work healing salvation it's done finish the only thing is our personal fate in that finished work it's our personal fate and we draw we we draw the renumerations we draw the reward we draw the compensation of his death at calvary for his personal faith what he died for isn't that right and every redemptive blessing belonged to you and i the only thing is the appropriate faith to receive it it's not he was wounded for our transgression he was bruce our iniquity let's just type in our pieces upon him and with his stripe we were healed it's all past tense it's a finished work it is something we just looked at calvary where the supreme sacrifice was made therefore oh hallelujah we have faith in this finished work nothing that i could do nothing that someone else can do it's what god has done and we believe he has done therefore we take from the word and base up our faith upon our finished work oh blessed be the name of the lord that's why i go on record and say the right mental attitude towards any divine promises of god will bring it to pass i don't care what it is if you have the right attitude which is to believe it that's just all you've got to do believe as doubt is go glory to god excuse me [Music] look at the woman caught in a very accurate directory they caught her they have the video on her they have the evidence there's witnesses there's a fresh act she's brought in the friends of jesus all them have their stones like on my webpage on my facebook page as i will quote uh forgiveness is a good idea until you have something to forgive and somebody have rocks look at the belt everybody is a good idea but when you are challenged to forgive that is why you have a problem you have a serious problem forgiveness is a nice topic to talk about it's it's sweet to talk about forgive your brother forgive your sister until you have something to forgive that it doesn't feel so sweet anymore but this woman was caught in very active adultery that all the stones according to the written word that the law that the stones and they called jesus jesus here we go here we go moses said so moses said so we have a quote for this we have a quote for that we have a quote for this we have a quote for that and he was a living quote he was the quota himself he was the living word and they have all the quotes written right there just said no big thing which one of you without sin cast the first stone let her have it amen let her have it and jesus turn this back to them right on the ground give him a chance to ease out scratch the head and ease out one by one the easing out some remember their ability to pay some remember the light might get cut some remember they have this to do and that to do enough dysfunction to go to and jesus wait until everybody left [Applause] he didn't want to embarrass them you got to tell them about all their life who they was with where they stole what they did he gotta tell every one of them hypocrites standing there with big stone to stone a woman because they were so self-righteous and jesus turned to the woman he said woman cause uh our case is called caught in session woman come forward where then accusers woman didn't send see when they left she looked around she said there is nothing he said this case can't continue we must have witnesses we must have evidence we must have accusers they have no accusers neither do i condemn thee go and sing no more and who the son of man come on now set free is free indeed give the lord a shout if you are free this morning give the lord a shout who the son of man set free is free indeed oh hallelujah hallelujah praise god say if you have a well in one hill i give a crap burning an exhale you could stand in boil water water come over here water water come over here the water will not listen to you you have to work with the law of gravitation and the law of gravitation can't fail so you have to work in the law to get the water to your burning crops isn't that right therefore therefore if you can't just say he left easy light up the room light of the room you've got to work according to the laws of election city then it will light up to the room isn't that right well therefore just that way god doesn't heal people by going to church or making the confession he heals you on your faith in his finished work that is the condition in which he's healed you not because you're in the church you could raise up this morning walk on a hole heal in your body in your spirit and in your soul some people not only sick in the body the second spirit that's why i like the world would you be made whole i love that will you be made whole it means wholesome right thinking coming into divine order will you remain whole they want to walk up here out there thinking right walking right feeling right not feeling miserable not feeling like you have crack on your mental but being made whole oh glory to god hallelujah oh get the lord some precious people [Applause] oh hallelujah glory to god no watch no man can come to me except my father draw him all that the father hat past tense given me will come that's a guarantee all of the father had given me will come so you understand what jesus did he walked on the other one peter come andrew will come because they were given to him so he wasn't making any mistake he wasn't casting a fishnet and hoping they come he said come follow me and something and then register the attribute inside of them connected to the word the attribute inside of them connected to the living word jesus had the names he was the book itself so when he began to call their names they have to respond therefore if you hear your name this morning you've got to respond you cannot hear your name and there is no response come on same as somebody because that deep deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond to that call oh hallelujah you understand now why jesus could say no man can come to me except the father draw him therefore you can come if you want to it's not him that will it or him that run it but a god that showed mercy that's why i'm shouting tonight because i know the grace of god has been so good to you and i what else can we do what manner of love is this that we can be called the sons of god wretched sinners and no and now it does not appear what we shall be but we know when we see him we shall be like him we shall be changed oh hallelujah oh are you with me oh blessed be the lord so watch how can you come to god without god calling you first all he forned you all all he forned you he called all he called he justify and to justify as i said as if you never did it all people on you oh let's say this way all he knew before did you hear what i said all he knew before he called all he called he justified all he justified he had it's finished oh hallelujah so watch this even though the lamb had to be slain on earth it was slain and god's thinking because everything under heaven have a season and a time to every purpose so even though it is finished it have a season and time to come into its fulfillment or come to its fruition so when you're looking for your season when your season comes your season comes that's why jesus keeps saying my always not yet you may be seasoned they want to stone him they want to do this he will say my always that she had come all of a sudden he changed he said my always come but the son of man be glorified but before that nothing could tap him nothing to defeat him nothing could trap him because you know he have all in time to do a certain work and god predestinated you here we go for certain work no kind of bonk you don't no building falling in your head this happening and don't forget about it nothing can defeat the purpose of god look at samson what's the purpose to destroy the philistines that's the purpose god's gained some introductory behaviors take lion king lion and do this and that everybody afraid samson samson's a big champion when they say samson get frightened because something will do what no other man was doing one time they locked something in the city they closed the gate you know how the city was in those days they catch them they say we catch him now we handle him we lock him up samson take up the gate by the post and park it on a hill in other words possess the gates of the enemy something get it wasn't stopping samson philistine one time thousand men and samson had no weapon take up a jawbone or beat down a thousand men with with brass helmet what a report for that man they're gonna report to his superiors they say okay well they get licked so they get blows and they get defeated by how much army by how many they say they they want to talk it they want to say so embarrassingly [Applause] the king said you got to be joking she said no who samson someone's that dread named the call they don't call you i have to get respects to their name sam's who you can't just call something like that you tremble fear and trembling when you hear that name god samson that man what the fear of god to the philistines hallelujah because they know god was with samsa well those philistines don't just sit down and say well we're taking that blues they start the plot and plan they loosely lie at him but god had a bigger plan than that [Music] you're not here in me delilah william wheel his way into his life until she caught him and samson appeared to be fully comprehensively defeated stumps bold something grinding at the mill man with our eyes weak as normal man see samson didn't know outside the anointing normal man a christian is not a normal man we are different no man we smoke and drink one woman we are different we call it a higher order don't bring that in here we are different come on same as somebody see the power the glory you will be seated was not samson's own was a higher order i was upon samsung samson grime but the philistines went too far they wanted entertainment they wanted to make fun god don't respect that they wanted to make fun of god's servant that was broken that was defeated that was battered literally they realized the hair was growing back the same hair that was cut the same virtues that were shaved off the same thunders that was roaring all along shaking the devil left and right and center now it was restored back and they brought samson blind boy a little boy leading him to the pillar he said leave me to the pillars where the whole building is at i like that samson have an understanding you can't call for fire and there's no you're not in position what if i were to burn you up he would just follow you with that shut up at the top of the can you go along samson didn't want that kind of thing sometimes they put me by the post because when there's power coming got to do something so you got to be interested in being positionally placed i'm not hearing you because power coming fire coming revival it's coming oh yes but you want to be in position [Applause] samson parade philistines looking for entertainment literally the secret is succulent eyes tears running down he said lord avenge me of my adversaries notice his prayer he will say lord i'm a sinner i deserve it if something was praying that kind of prayer number one is sure he had no revelation number two he was going to remain a sinner because no faith was going to appropriate any power coming down and he was going to stay there and he and philistine have a good laugh but samson wasn't connected to that samson reached back before he fell before delilah before there was a moon before there was a star before there was a molecule samson reached back before the foundational world where he was a son where he was a seed when he was a thought when he had his name written samson said avenge me your son of taking my eyes once more that the son talking to father i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you that is not somebody outside that there's somebody inside somebody belonging to the kingdom that's a kingdom son saying father you give me eyes these rascals had no right [Applause] samson was elected whoa samson was obtained for a purpose once more lord and the power struck him and the billy began to shake and samson kill more philistines in his death than he did in his life his purpose was accomplished give the lord a shout nothing couldn't defeat let the haters hate on that can't stop it let the jealous people jealous on that still can't stop it nothing going to stop it we are going to revival our seven thunder revival nothing on us right here we gonna have a revival oh hallelujah glory to god why because god promised it not because i said god promised it oh what we see should make a church that would make a revival and that is what we're going to do in trinidad we're going to make a church there's going to be a short great message that could just shake the whole nation there is going to be a seventh on the revival in the land i believe that i'm claiming ahead i'm walking in it i'm expecting it oh blessed be the name of the lord oh glory to god so here we go again although he phoned you he caught so the bible said he needs partial samaria why you have a woman he want to meet he sent the disciples to get bread and eat whatever it is he says i am meat you know not of my meat is the will of him that sent me and to finish the work so he needs pressure samaria you have to journey a different direction to get to samaria he sits at the well he is the book he have the names all that the father had given me will come this woman had five men the one she living with wasn't hers but all that the father had given me will come her name was on the book but she didn't know it all but the father had given me will come she was practicing she was in horrible condition nobody fell asleep with her nobody giving us something to eat nobody encouraging her because there's no service at that kind of woman but jesus sat at the well because all that the father had given me will come he knew what time she was coming so he was on time i'm not hearing you this morning and god knows that you will be here this morning you are on time god is on time all that the father had given me will come oh glory glory glory hallelujah what sin tell me what's in what sin you could talk about what sin you could bring that god can't handle and god can't deal with i have news for you it has already been deadweight [Applause] that's what calvary is all about my you may be seated you justified he has already glorified you you're living under a privilege i want to read a private interview about a brand higher with a woman that i refer to a masterpiece the following is a personal interview by the brandon high with her sister georgia bruce doing the song service preceding the message the masterpiece he's speaking to the woman it's his sister i visited the hospital at that time and i prayed constantly god wouldn't let you die she was sick because you are valued to the church now i know you i know you're going to be all right sister bruce i believe in all my heart this is just a bruce response but a branham most of all i want the experience that i've been sealed in the holy ghost and if god revealed it to your heart and by the brain i'm speaking i believe in all my heart that you are a real born-again believer sister bruce how could that spirit just leave when you get sick you get wary you a nervous type person sister bruce said yes and you get things on your mind see little bitty things if that keeps building up both ways and you get somebody on your heart you want to pray for them get up and pray for it you can't rest until you get that person prayed for that's you then you take on the other side satan might present something to you out of this way then it's your nature and god works and satan works then when satan tries to make you believe that you're not you keep building this and building this don't look at yourself sister bruce remember i'm fixing to pray for you i'm not worthy of that what would i do if jesus christ was sitting here now what would he do if he was sitting here he would lay his hands upon you with his great faith see and you'll get well but i think i'm a sinner i am not him i come to represent him but remember me being a sinner and before god i am not a sinner and neither are you [Music] could i read that part again you think i'm a sinner i'm on him but i come to represent him but remember me being a sinner and before god i am not a sinner neither are you we have got a blood sacrifice laying there god don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of christ that's it he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice but it's christ's blood then it is christ that is talking to us to god so therefore we are not sinners no more we are christians and i believe you to be a genuine christian woman sister bruce says i have made so many mistakes and i feel so many times but abraham that's why christ had to die so you with your mistakes it wouldn't be lutter to you he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to save him since the bruce says yes that's what he died for so you could serve him your mistakes are not looked it is not allotted to you he is your appropriation he is your sin offering you are not a sinner before god christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him sister bruce says but i've never had an experience that have been filled with the holy ghost that i could put my foot on all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shape of inequity comes to the word speaking lies that's the nature of a human being since the bruce said yes that was your nature it's changed once uh but it what changed it she said christ there you are sister that's it he that heard my words and believing him that sent me out eternal life shall not come to judgment but pass from death unto life you are christian sister bruce here we go are you ready i have watched your life i have watched you on the vision and i know you're a christian now she said she makes so much of failures and so much mistake and he's here on the vision and he wasn't seeing the failures and the missing he said i know you're a christian i have seen your life i've seen it on the vision praise god watch there's not a spec i am your shepherd as it was she said yes somebody to help you if there was any doubt in my mind if i thought there was something wrong i will tell you sister bruce and if there was anything wrong in your experience anything wrong between you and god as far as i know nothing about there is not a thing oh give the lord some praises oh hallelujah so i wonder what god's seeing this morning and what you seeing this morning your failures your short comments your mistakes and whatnot but under vision oh glory to god you are son and daughter of the living god give the lord a shell well praise the lord so therefore god has tied for the end in mind the seed that's going to be planted has to be ripe and mature you don't plant a green corn seed so the seed is figurative and representative of the end product a dry grain a corn it's mature it's ripe but that is what is going to be buried to reproduce more of the same kind isn't that right hallelujah so you start with the end in mind you start with the mature seed that is the seed that can be sown and through the process of plant life you get the fruit at the end ecliesis 3 15 says that which had been is now and that which is to be had already been. that's like a parable and god required that which is passed that's a big scripture there is no light scripture that's a big one i really can't that which had been is known yeah that is the bee has already been and god require that which is passed you start with the seed and the seed is the word jesus said the parable is the seed is the word the word is a seed for a villain of god notice all the glory that was in god is in the word in the beginning was the word it wasn't with god and the word was god so all the glory is where in the word isn't that right so praise god so he emptied himself poured himself into christ and christ are being behind the veil therefore the christian life here we go is a daily struggle between our two natures the law of the flesh and the law of the spirit and paul identified the law of the flesh in romans 7. from verse 14 he said we know that the lord is spiritual but i am kind of sold on the sin verse 15 for that which i do i alone not and what i would that i i do i not what i hate that i do for if then i do that which i would not and consent unto the lord that is good then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwell at no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find them a law that when i would do good evil is present with me and i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warren against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members all wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this debt but i thank god through jesus christ all or then with the mind i myself served the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin oh could we give the lord some praises that's just the scriptures but the scripture is anointed the script is inspired it's been inspired to you that's the law of sin in your nature you may be seated then romans chapter 8 the law of the spirit it won there is therefore no no condemnation to them who are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit in christ jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death oh could we give the lord a praise offered oh hallelujah hallelujah glory hallelujah genesis 1 26 and god said let us make man in our image in all likeness john 4 god is a spirit did not worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth so god image and likeness is spirit so the first man god made genesis 1 was a spirit man that was the man that had dominion that was the man that had power that was the man like a spirit being isn't that right brother branham said with a spirit man the order of god isn't that right and he said now the first man he give man to lead the animal life like the holy spirit leads the believer today and if we were in perfect submission to the holy spirit god lead us by the holy spirit now watch then there was no man to till the soil man physical man so genesis one man was spirit man genesis two men there was no man to tell the soil no physical being so then he fought man out of the dust of the earth and put the spirit man into this dust man the bible said man become a living soul a living soul a living soul so this image you see today is the image of animal life this is not the image of the son of god what you see the physical is animal life the image of man image of dust is not the image of god god made two men spirit man and dust man and put the spirit man in the dust man and man become a living soul and that's the man that you see around you here this morning isn't that right so man made him out of the dust of the earth not his own image he already made the man but then he breathed into him the breath of life and he became a living soul so the soul of man is the nature of the spirit the soul of man is the nature of the spirit so when you are reborn you don't get a new spirit you get a new nature of that spirit it's the same spirit but a new nature of it you take two men stand them together both look alike one of them is a sinner one of them in a christian one man said i got a spirit the same as you have see but one is different his soul his nature is different he's been changed so then he breathe into this man and watch he put him in five senses so he could contact his earthly home see smell feel here he made him that way now those senses was not to contact god you like good food yeah i like good food too have taste to do that with right but that's not how to contact god that's for you to communicate here on the earth seafields meal and touch and so on that's what those senses are for isn't that right god have a bigger sense for you to contact him with that's a sense of faith it's a substance what you can touch and feel and taste and smell and hear it's a supernatural substance that god put inside of you as a cornerstone inside your heart inside your soul a substance called faith and you can't even explain it it's supernatural you can't show anybody you just live it you just demonstrate it you just manifest it you just believe the word you don't even know how you just say amen to the word because that faith inside of you is agreeing with the word be unspoken isn't that right hallelujah isn't that right so he said i have a picture of adam he was dead as he could be his toes like roots sticking on the ground and gossip let there be and breathe a breath of life into him and he jumped came to himself breathe a breath of life into him and he became a living soul now there are two elements that make up a human being one of them is your mind the other is your soul and the mind is your mental thinking your intellect your soul is a part of god that's in you now when you're born and as a child you go into a living soul at the age of choice you hear the gospel and there is something way inside of you that until you receive christ and you say well i'm too young now i'll wait a little longer now that is why you make a first mistake right there you grieve this person inside god is not going to judge you by the man up here your intellect he's going to judge you by your soul now many people have faith in your intellect others have faith in their soul now the intellect will reason and say it's not reasonable and so forth but remember the soul just believes the word of god isn't that right from recognizing this message listen to this now why you talking about uh trump revelation 17 11 appears in line with the sixth seal mostly elijah two witnesses there's a problem when i get to mostly liars which the jews believe the prophets and they will come with the sign of the prophets and their work exactly now watch show one thing that man when you die whatever when you leave this world your nature doesn't change if you are lying now you'll be a liar there if you're hot headed here you'll be hunted a deer if your daughter here you'll be adopted there men and women it's time to shake yourself and examine yourselves and see where we are standing for death does not change it [Applause] that's why naked that came into this world but naked you will not leave you believe with your character or your nature death doesn't change who you are jet only changes your dwelling place are you with me so they have been gone for 2000 years moses about 2500 years and 2500 years has elijah been gone and moses and they returned with the same nature and do the same thing debt doesn't do nothing to a man but changes dwell in place it doesn't change your nature it doesn't change your faith it doesn't change nothing but your dwelling place so if your nature this morning you're doubt of god's word you'll be a doctor over there so i don't care holy you are how you live and how good you live it wouldn't change you a bit to die just your dwelling please and if you can't accept the whole word of god the way it's written you won't do it there don't worry you won't be there you have got to accept it in its fullness in the power of its vindication and the revelation of what it is then you become part of it are you with me so i've often said in the church he said live in a church live mortal beings each one is a great conglomeration of gaithy and blackness and darkness mortals live here they are either influenced from this way or that way here we go you cannot be a spiritual being sin or saint without having the influence on the underworld or the above world if you are influenced from here you are from above your celestial body is waiting up there but if you are wicked and hypocritical and indifferent your celestial body is down here regardless of how much you think is up there because the fruit here we go the fruit that you bear before people proves where you're from are you ready so you are here what you are somewhere else [Applause] that's a big one that's a big big big one you are here what you are somewhere else your life that you have lived here is reflecting your what your inheritance is when you leave here that's why the baptism of the holy ghost is the earnest or the down payment of your inheritance is a reflection that you already raised up and you're on your way to the resurrection so god give you a little don't payment the whole say hold this virtue power but you have more coming you have knowledge and temperance and patience and communist and public you have more virtues coming oh give the lord some praises people hallelujah here's a woman standing here i'm a young man waiting to get married she meets my specifications in every way she's a lovely christian she looks like one she's dressed like one she acts like one she lives like one i admit she'll make me a good wife but she isn't mine until i take off her mind and that's the way the message is you can sympathize with it say it's right but you've got to take it to yourself and for it to become part of it then you and the message become one then the anointing is with you as it with the others so the anointing is not just with the preacher but the anointed comes with you because you make the message a part of you and you are part of it then i will never leave you i'll never forsake you the anointing is with you wherever you go he is you don't have to feel him he is there all the time oh glory to god because he said so i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i will be with you even in you to the end of the world oh could we give the lord some praises people glory hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the lord no brother branham is it true that every jew born since christ came will be saved who are the 144 thousand are they the predestinated ones to be sealed with the holy ghost and what is their mission there about three questions there is it true that every jew born since christ came in the world will be saved no here we go nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation were jew or gentiles so when that book is concerned you are gentle your name have to be there that's why they say how much thousands of this tribe and that tribe and that tribe type of benjamin whatever it is specific after the tribe 144 tons is that right the book doesn't say leave let's be saved in this time of this church or oh my never it doesn't say that it just shows the mystery or unfolds the mystery but we ourselves by faith believe it so the book doesn't say john jones and harry smith or whatever the book that shows the mystery and you by faith connect with it and you see your name you say that's me that's me i am not madam party that's me oh glory to god i am no cigarette sucker oh yeah man miniskirt wearer no i want the word i want something that thunders i am not going to be a photocopy of all the young people out there no i'm going to be original oh are you with me [Applause] now oh watch then then he said we will be one as i am the father one that kind of one then how will it be the word in us would be the anointed word and that is the oneness of god the oneness of god is the word anointed in you then you become a son a messiah of the age so in other words you come from taught and you bypass the word you came to the earth to be tempted and tested but you are going back to the world because you have to be a taught in order to be a word because the word is a taught express you think it and then speak it so god can't lose his thoughts what fine thoughts he is thinking oh hallelujah what beautiful thoughts he's thinking this morning so watch this the one at a well with her life on earth she looks black she looks dirty she looks filthy whatever it is but in heaven she's fine [Music] you understand that not the pharisees on earth they look fine with the long gong and they put on the bed like spiritual what not but they were black the name was not up there because they're called to crucify him so that woman that's looking this way and that way her name is up there and this one looking so spiritual the name not up there so you can't go by looks it's not look as though this is believers though this you can't go by lurks because the same thing samuel was going to do when he was told to anoint one of jesse's son when the first guy came tall and handsome he said this surely this is he and god say god i don't go by looks. god doesn't see the way man sees oh give the lord some praise god doesn't see hallelujah glory no you say adam died by the brahmana but remember before adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him those who he fiona he called he had a lamb that redeemed him is not right then the lamb provided for adam is not right then why would we struggle with eternal life if that eternal sword breathes us by bread now someday the sons of god will again become gods jesus said is not it written your law your gods if you call those who we call god who visited you how can you condemn me to say i'm a son of god no watch he is now a son of god he makes a mistake he knows he's not he's doing wrong adam was not deceived adam knew he was doing wrong adam walked with eve because he was his wife christ was not deceived by satan but he walked into his debt with the bride he went to be with the bride so he could redeem the church so you could understand how man was fallen so god became man to redeem man he can't redeem man from up dear he had to come down here to redeem man so he subject himself to the law of sin and death that's why christ had to die hallelujah to reach us right where we are oh glory to god hallelujah in spirit he was god in flesh he was man my god why have god forsaken me [Applause] oh hallelujah in other words he wept at the grave of lazarus as a man he wept but when he rolled away the stone when he ball where have you laid him when he cried lazarus come forth that was more than a man so on this side you see the law of sin and death you see in tears you see and crying you're seeing depression and frustration but when you speak it thunders oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so don't mystic weakness hallelujah for weakness meekness or weakness no meekness is power in control oh hallelujah when he looking defeated the cross on his back they're beating him they're hitting him they're laughing at him when you're looking at his weakest point he was at his greatest conquering power because he's going to hell to take the keys from the devil i've got the keys on hell and the grave oh glory to god hallelujah hell rejoicing because the messiah is crucified but then they heard unknocking i when they heard that knocking here the lamb jesus opened up that gate and he snapped the keys of death and hell and let captivity captive all who the devil had wrong he opened up the prison open up open up the emperor come on come on come on open up them prison breath open up open up open [Applause] look so small hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god then brothers wasn't easy where's brothers but on the word paul said i have to put away this body but my god it's better i need to be with you all so i'll just postpone that i believe in here i come here to strengthen you and edify you and help you they know that earthly time and i could be dissolved there wasn't in his body i oh gosh i'm gonna miss my family they say this earth they tapping i could be dissolved we have another body with him they understood by revelation that this is not the real man [Applause] come on same at somebody [Applause] you're a host and a dying man you could pour up that face sweeten that face pull back that skin smooth in your face exercise up and down and dying whatever it is that's still a dying man hallelujah hallelujah if you're feeling young now at 15 wait till i get 50 more on top of that 15. until 15 you're gonna feel 50 years from now that's like paul said if there's time i can't resolve we have a building we have a house wait him wait him wait in there hallelujah feel good i feel good feel good hallelujah and but i'm describing this way when a woman have a baby isn't that right is it outside the mother after nine months there's a soul a spirit waiting there waiting for the body to come muscles quitting out there but to give it a nature there's a life out there waiting the life on the inside of the boom is not the same like outside so it takes a spank to get the breath in if the baby come out that means still born so it takes something to happen this adam was standing like this a mud man i'll just see it that way and i'm standing dead like a mud man the spirit man watching this mud man and god of the butter spanx a man became a living soul and adam's limbs get activated now we could move now we could call his cell phone he's not activated no no no we could now we could move this and move that and now he can get his fork and dig up the linen and till the soil all the time be moving like a mist over the ground and whatnot but this is no miss now this is physical thing three move here orange to the left to the left to the left mounting to the right to the right to the right adam is speaking adam is naming adam is organizing and god was well pleased god was so pleased he turned us back [Applause] you could fool god you know why god put us back to give everybody a chance to give the serpent a chance to give eve a chance to give adam a chance to give everybody a chance god couldn't be watching and things take a chance god turn his back and say well continue on but god plan his purpose can't change his word can't change his objective and motive can't change so why adam gone demonstrating his power talking to lion and bees and everything else they still can sneak up on eve give you some kind of nancy story and sweeten her head and sweeten her mind and he fell down give her husband and man fell what a dark day that was and god wept and god cried and god rolled over and bore because he didn't know what i'm what i'm gonna do no there was a plan he had a plan before they had this stuff hallelujah before you do your stuff you have a plan all things work together for good to damn that love good to them who are the called according to his purpose do i hear a shout in the house all things work together for good hallelujah so when man fell god started rejoicing no i'm going to be a redeemer no i'm going to be restored no i'm going to be here because somebody will be sick so i could now manifest my attributes oh that was locked up in me i'm going to be unfall to the seven rainbow of my glory my glory going to unfold as a redeemer as a deliverer as a lawyer as a baptizer oh hallelujah as a way maker as a provider because we give the lord some praise as people all of his attributes could not be unfolded you're the gyro you will offer your what is in you oh glory to god give the lord some praises people god's purpose cannot be defeated [Applause] let me be seated wow glory hallelujah you cannot join the church of the living god you're born into it by the baptism of the holy ghost and when you are baptized with the holy ghost then these virtues are sealed into you by the holy ghost the church is a mystical body of christ born by the bread of god jesus he said unto them peace be unto you as my father sent me so send out you and then he said receive in the holy ghost and he breathed upon them in other words that bread that was in genesis that bread that adam that bread has to come back into the church you have to speak with them but breathe praise god received the holy ghost of brett a promise a power an anointing was released that they could come alive and when god took ezekiel down into the valley of dry bones and lord they were very dry and god asks ezekiel a question can these bones live oh hallelujah son of man talk back to me hallelujah you watch and you speak back to me it's bones all over but do you think they could live and the son of man was smart enough to say don't know us he said if you know i know then you speak oh gloria if you know what i know if you feel you know what i know if you believe i know about those bones then you could speak he said i stood and prophesy and i said bone come to bone dad a bone revival oh glory that i seen you revival that a skin revival and that body was standing there with no life in it everything was in order all the mechanics but no life in it then he said prophesy again onto the four winds let's get some breath inside of here let's get some wind inside of here and that body come a mighty machine army and we had mechanics ministry of the world for over 50 years i'm saying the body is built but let's get some breath inside of here the wind is blowing again the breath of god is blowing again it's going to breathe upon you and you shall be filled with the baptism of the holy ghost the spirit shall surely come it shall come to pass afterwards i will pour out my spirit are you with me hallelujah flurry you may be seated praise god from the token no we're going to get on some heavy stuff oh glory to god the blood had to be applied and the blood meant animal dying but the animal had no soul so the nature couldn't come back upon man to replace his own old nature isn't that right so then the blood which was the chemistry is what was represented as the token when i see the blood i'm going to pass over you because the animal life had no soul so there was no spirit from the animal to come back upon the worshipper but when jesus died he was god's lamb his soul was the holy ghost so when he died the life of that lamb could not come back upon the believer and that's the holy ghost that's the change of nature that's the soul oh glory to god are you seeing it hallelujah no more the chemistry but the life of god come back upon you the believer then it's not you no more it's the holy ghost upon you it's the holy ghost in you it's the holy ghost through you [Applause] so the talker now is the literal life of jesus christ we turn back upon the believer from swords that are prisoner of the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is the nature of the spirit so when the nature of man we were dead pictures we were dead our lives are hidden god through christ sealed by the holy ghost that wasn't your body that died it wasn't your spirit you died it's what your nature of your spirit that died and the nature which is the soul the nature of your soul god if you're born again it's not you oh hallelujah it's eternal life it's life that never a beginning life that never and that's what's inside of you oh praise the name of the lord so all powers of hell might wage against it but it will never prevail we have god's eternal promise oprah is not up to me it's not up to you whether it will be destroyed or not it's up to god oh hallelujah now we would think today upon destruction trying to destroy we have christ on the promise we think of the hebrew children god had purpose for them that they were dung in babylon that the fullness was hot seven times hotter it was going to heat it they destroyed the purpose of god all babylon was on a rage they were determined satan was determined to destroy the purpose of god for he knew those churros going to the furnace so he made the furnace and heated up seven times hotter to be sure the program of god would be destroyed but god wanted to displace power and all babylon and all hell could not defeat that purpose they could have hid this furnace a million times hotter it would have never destroyed the purpose of god god wanted to show that he was the god of deliverance and he would bring deliverance to whomsoever he desired to bring it and nothing could interfere with this program so i'm telling you lose your faith here this morning and believe god for the impossible believe god for the difficult believe god for miracles what you never think god would do i'm saying god is able to do all things are possible to them that believe you can go free this morning oh glory to god hallelujah you can i know the devil talking to your mind he's supposed to talk to your mind you might be seated when i say you can disable but i have to tell you you can't if nothing telling you can't something wrong there is no devil then because if i was the devil i'll tell you you can't that way they were supposed to bring doubts bring fears go god won't deliver that's why i come to tell you nothing will defeat the purpose of god according to election before the children do any wrong thing go to esau i hate jacob i love he knew what they will do [Applause] so before they even born he could pronounce a word of their destiny you understand what happened there nothing could change your destiny [Applause] [Music] your destiny is not defeat your destiny's victory god does he not seek this yeah that's his health your destiny foundation that's his deliverance your destiny is breakthrough your destiny is overcoming oh hallelujah you're destined that frustration that's the devil amen it got people frustrated the other husband and some people wise they frustrated me in our marriage and the way it wasn't in our marriage some people frustrated they do have a job some people need your frustrated inner job some people have no money and frustrated some people money they're very frustrated because the money put producing satisfaction the right police satisfaction the husband not producing satisfaction you want that child you want to try to get a chat no satisfaction gotcha how you uphold knight [Laughter] so your joy cannot be in things kind of being people i hope he changed then i had joy joy joy i hope she changed then i had joy joy joy i hope my children change forget about it if you depend upon that for joy i don't enjoy coming not that kind of way you better get the joy that the world can't give and the world can't take it from you that's the kind of joy that's internal inside of you whether you're tearing up or doing or nothing no no no no it's not gonna do with that hallelujah are you with me now glory to god amen you may be seated that's why jesus told them if they say lo go here forget it not the kingdom so doing bother with them from the muslim he said behold king was within you [Applause] because you know man human will try to point you to this one that one that place look at coming look at it you can come in look look who was there but you said it can't come so you know that'll be in you because enoch walked with god and was not for god took him enoch wasn't looking because even looking for anybody else nobody else go in not even his wife so if you know his wifey wifey wifey says honey i want to walk but i can't walk enoch wasn't on that enoch was on the word enoch walk with god if his wife didn't want to work that's up to her but he walking with god because god is first your family second and you are mr third brother in case you don't know you are number three so let's go again god first family second you are so check your order oh could we give the lord some praises people hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god watch this fire cannot defeat the purpose of god's plan all the explaining away all the mathematics all the intelligence world disguise cannot destroy the faith in god's children it live off forever they wanted to put daniel lions then but he purposed in his heart he put much in his heart the land couldn't defeat the promise of god it's not right so it goes to show that nothing can defeat his purpose not even debt not defeat his purpose abraham was good as dead serious woman had been dead for 45 years but nothing can defeat the purpose of god what a curveball god bowled the devil and let abraham believe sarah gonna have her son and watch watch when you force and manufacture something sarah had an interpretation of how that was supposed to be she said look at my maid and today the fruit of that is what you see all along right now a whole bunch of abraham's seed on a different line altogether that the bible said every man shall be against them and they shall be against every man now they cutting out head neck everything a kind of murderous generation that because abraham had see two higger and they form a whole lineage right now all because he went and manufactured something instead of wheaton for the promise so don't try to manufacture something you produce a wild man producer ishmael no stick politicizer stick with what god promised because the children have promised a country for seed because all israel is not israel come on now all in the message is not the message all who say i believe the prophet they don't believe [Applause] hallelujah have to have something to separate to show who is who her body was old and wrinkled milk veins was dried up her heart was weak it could not have went through labor but god let us know that his purpose will not be defeated he changed sarah and make a young woman again amen and turn back in on his youth god gave a promise and abram staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god hallelujah first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of god stands in election it was purpose in himself it was god's purpose to pray for the people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world to be in him she was foreknown and beloved before she ever even brought forth she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her this elect lady oh you're looking like is what i'm talking about [Applause] i'm talking to the lady elect and she's watching me like if i'm not talking to you i'm talking to you [Applause] that aim is a weak boy you got to believe it you know you have to appropriate your fear to believe that you are what the words say here oh glory to god oh my hallelujah praise god god purpose cannot be defeated how happy we ought to be resting on that beautiful revelation of the word of the living god there's neither things present no things to come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils nothing can separate us from the love of god so then only one daughter healing jesus that door one daughter peace isn't that right he's all healing isn't that right and if jesus is the door to all these things and faith is a key that unlocks the door and if jesus is the door to all these promises of god fate in his finished work unlocks every door to every treasure inside that kingdom okay we're in the home stretch oh blessed be the name of the lord he said grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption talk about the boxcar before they sealed the door everything must be packed inside of there the inspector comes to see what's inside that box and when it's properly packed in he sees it until his destiny isn't that right the seven seals is a finished work seven season the back side is the finished work it's a complete that's what the seas is about every seal finished and god put the holy ghost upon your life isn't that right i was stolen bastard field they call it where they have these big jet planes and a jet can travel it goes a certain speed and it hits what they call a song barrier they say that spring struggles and shakes musicians cover please struggles and shakes while it's trying to get to that some barrier did it seem like the wings will tear off and the boat will rip out of it while it's going to the sun barrier but when once it gets beyond that some barrier is speeds unlimited it could just fly free now here we go and the church you're sitting here tonight you're struggling struggling and god is pulling you and showing you things if you can ever get past that sin
