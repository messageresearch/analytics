[35:29] give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
[35:32] of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind
[35:33] on earth shall be born in heaven
[35:35] whatsoever shall loosen earth
[35:37] shall be loosed in heaven
[35:39] then charge his disciples that they
[35:42] should tell no man that he was jesus
[35:45] the christ may god bless his word you
[35:47] may be seated
[35:48] o blessed be the name of the lord
[35:51] is good to be in god's presence
[35:54] and in the house of god
[35:57] so this morning i have a title i will
[35:58] build my church upon this rock
[36:01] revelation fate
[36:03] that's the title of this morning i will
[36:05] build my church
[36:06] upon this rock
[36:08] revelation fate
[36:09] i have an inspiration look on this
[36:13] have a subject
[36:15] godly spiritual fate
[36:17] only recognizes the word
[36:21] godly spiritual faith only recognizes
[36:24] the word
[36:25] you know the bibles talk about
[36:27] uh all heard the word
[36:29] but with many
[36:30] it wasn't mixed with faith to them that
[36:32] heard it
[36:33] so it comes right back
[36:35] to everybody could hear the same thing
[36:38] but what they're possessing
[36:40] could be different
[36:42] and um we talked about it in the
[36:45] exhortation we give on friday about the
[36:47] eagle and the chicken
[36:49] and one man hearing the same story eagle
[36:51] laid the egg among chickens hatch
[36:55] chicken stock the eagles had to be like
[36:56] a chicken then a mother eagle passover
[36:58] and the eagle recognized is one like
[37:00] himself and fly off and and somebody
[37:03] hear that story and one person said but
[37:05] that man called me a chicken
[37:07] and the other person said that man call
[37:09] me an eagle
[37:11] so it all depends upon what you have
[37:13] as your processor
[37:15] or what you interpret on the inside
[37:18] so if you are negative on the inside you
[37:21] tend to pick up negative things
[37:23] you will even think that the pasta train
[37:25] waits for you
[37:26] you would even think all kinds of things
[37:28] come to your mind because of what on the
[37:30] inside
[37:31] see
[37:32] so we need to deal with the inside
[37:36] before you try to deal with somebody
[37:38] else try to work on you
[37:40] try to deal with you
[37:42] okay let's go
[37:44] are you ready
[37:46] so you want things compact tight and
[37:48] underwood this morning all right nobody
[37:50] going to escape this word now this would
[37:52] okay already
[37:54] no one here will escape
[37:57] nobody going to escape this morning
[37:59] here we go there are three elements that
[38:02] a man follows
[38:03] first is humanistic
[38:05] second is divine revelation
[38:08] third is a vision
[38:10] oh that's dusty at the lord
[38:12] many times we are dung in here and never
[38:14] climb into this
[38:16] if you're not dung in there cast your
[38:17] hopes through the veil to see the lord
[38:20] all right now
[38:21] here it is now
[38:23] so there's three realms
[38:24] so this morning either in humanistic
[38:28] divine revelation or vision
[38:31] let's not talk vision just yet because
[38:33] vision is dusty at the lord
[38:35] so to us at this level is just true
[38:39] humanistic
[38:41] and divine revelation
[38:43] now all of us stats are humanistic
[38:45] because that's where we are at
[38:47] we're dealing with five senses we're
[38:49] dealing with see touch smell taste sight
[38:52] and what we hear and what we feel and
[38:54] our emotion and this will get us hurt
[38:56] all that is humanistic but divine
[38:58] revelation takes you above that
[39:01] and that's why jesus asked his important
[39:03] question who do men say i am in other
[39:05] words who do the humanistic realm out
[39:07] there who say i am because they don't
[39:09] know who i am
[39:10] so tell me what they're saying about me
[39:12] tell me what they're talking about me
[39:14] and they say some so you're elijah some
[39:16] say you're this some say you had that he
[39:17] said who do you say i am i'm coming down
[39:20] to home now who do you say i am and they
[39:23] didn't know
[39:24] after following jesus for three plus
[39:26] years they didn't know who he was all of
[39:28] a sudden peter stepped forward he said
[39:30] that by the christ the son of the living
[39:33] god
[39:33] then jesus used these words flesh and
[39:36] blood hath not revealed unto you but my
[39:39] father hath revealed unto you and upon
[39:42] this rock i will build
[39:45] my church
[39:46] it was a revelation
[39:48] it was a rock
[39:50] it was a faith that he built his church
[39:52] horn he's not building his church with
[39:54] cement and gravel he's done building
[39:56] church upon flesh and blood he is
[39:58] building his church today
[40:00] upon revelation
[40:02] do you have a revelation today because a
[40:05] revelation puts something inside of you
[40:07] a revelation you can't explain it a
[40:09] revelation is something you can't
[40:11] explain it you don't even know why
[40:12] you're here this morning but something
[40:14] told you you've got to be here god
[40:17] wanted you to be here this morning you
[40:19] know what brought you here this morning
[40:21] fate
[40:22] oh glory to god by faith you put on your
[40:25] clothes this morning you say you're
[40:27] going to church this morning all the
[40:29] devils in hell was shining into you all
[40:32] the devils in here trying to stop you
[40:34] but you made it don't give the lord a
[40:35] praise offering
[40:38] glory
[40:40] glory
[40:42] glory
[40:44] let me see that
[40:46] faith is what has distinguished the
[40:48] believer from the unbeliever
[40:50] you don't know why you're doing certain
[40:51] things like that one time a woman
[40:53] praying she was hungry she was poor and
[40:55] she prayed oh god send some food send
[40:57] some bread send something and somebody
[40:59] passing back here and i'm praying
[41:01] and they say and they say we go go and
[41:03] buy bread and put it back she don't she
[41:04] will think goats in it
[41:07] and she pray oh god would you bless me
[41:09] help me hungry and food and the person
[41:11] by i said that full stuff from president
[41:13] and she said oh god thank you lord
[41:15] and they're laughing at her
[41:17] they don't even know god put it that
[41:20] they will buy this stuff and put it
[41:22] right there that is faith
[41:24] that is faith when you don't know what's
[41:25] going to happen tomorrow but you step
[41:27] out oh glory to god that is faith
[41:29] glory to god
[41:31] hallelujah
[41:33] glory to god that's his faith

[41:40] god said i have a son
[41:41] sarah old passage age of childbearing

[45:31] it shall surely come to pass or give the
[45:34] lord a shout there's going to be
[45:36] dynamics to the mechanics he is still a
[45:38] waymaker when lassen heard that this
[45:40] morning he's a waymaker where there is
[45:43] no way god makes a way i am preaching in
[45:46] vain i am shouting asleep we're not
[45:48] insanely granny and then oh glory to god
[45:51] this tabernacle is not in trinidadian oh
[45:54] give the lord a shout he said upon this
[45:57] rock i will build my church there is a
[46:00] church at jesus building and i believe
[46:02] this morning that you are part of it
[46:11] let me see
[46:13] oh boy
[46:15] all right
[46:16] there are three realms
[46:18] okay first is humanistic we don't hear
[46:20] say i'll pray for that person i'm hoping
[46:22] that they get well
[46:24] as humanistic
[46:26] you're hoping they get well next is
[46:28] divine revelation that is when
[46:31] something done in your heart
[46:34] anchors it
[46:35] and say it is going to happen
[46:38] there is something going to happen
[46:40] then the third element is vision
[46:43] or the word of the lord made manifest
[46:45] when you see it's thus saith the lord oh
[46:48] glory ago just three realms humanistic
[46:51] that you and your flesh
[46:52] right you're in your flesh you're
[46:54] staying home you're looking for a walk
[46:56] and coming to your house
[46:58] you've got to get off your bed early
[47:00] [Music]
[47:03] people waiting inside the house for
[47:04] things to happen
[47:06] it's not coming soon
[47:08] you step up by faith today i'm going to
[47:10] get a job
[47:11] today i'm going to get a breakthrough
[47:12] yes you have to act
[47:14] that's the problem today people are
[47:16] sitting and staring
[47:18] they're not acting isn't that right
[47:19] i appreciate nothing new you know
[47:21] they're the same egg fried boil stew
[47:24] whatever it is the same it will rain you
[47:25] know
[47:26] don't come i ain't coming on your
[47:28] doctrine and teaching you know
[47:29] no one come with that
[47:31] send my wife something but isaac talk
[47:33] about uh
[47:34] uh that they will not come until they
[47:36] are falling away until the man is saying
[47:39] be received and the bible speaks about
[47:41] because they love not the truth
[47:44] god will send them a strong delusion
[47:46] that they will believe a lie
[47:49] and be done by it and you know never
[47:51] zeroing better exact on that word
[47:53] delusion and delusion is when you
[47:55] believe something that is fake in the
[47:57] face of facts
[48:00] in the face of truth
[48:02] you choose to believe something
[48:04] different that is a delusion
[48:08] oh hallelujah and because people don't
[48:11] love the truth god not giving them just
[48:14] a delusion you know
[48:15] but a strong
[48:17] delusion that they actually believe is a
[48:19] lie
[48:20] they believe a lie
[48:22] as if it's the truth
[48:24] oh glory to god that's why we have to be
[48:26] careful
[48:27] we have to be careful because when
[48:29] something in somebody's heart
[48:31] you can't take it out
[48:38] you can't change your mind
[48:40] you can show them quotes you can show
[48:42] them scripture
[48:43] because the heart register something
[48:45] else
[48:48] so i said if somebody don't like you
[48:50] they don't like you know you can get
[48:52] them fig
[48:53] a house land cat they still don't like
[48:55] you because that don't like it's in the
[48:58] heart
[48:59] even in head it could be it would blow
[49:01] away you could get that out but when
[49:03] it's in the heart it is registered
[49:05] that's why you have to take it how
[49:06] you're here
[49:07] and what we said i think two sundays ago
[49:10] but the prophet said he said when you
[49:11] say the thing over and over and over and
[49:13] you believe it after a while a lie your
[49:15] pong allah your pong allah your you beat
[49:18] it until it dropped down from here to
[49:20] here and after what is in your heart
[49:22] that's no good
[49:24] so god that's why you keep hearing
[49:25] things over and over because god's seed
[49:28] must drop into your heart god's thought
[49:31] must drop into your heart that your
[49:32] words change and then your life change
[49:35] as you speak different you talk
[49:37] different you act different your whole
[49:39] life completely transformed
[49:41] and that is why the bible said be
[49:42] transformed by what by the union of your
[49:44] mind if your mind has changed you're not
[49:46] going to change
[49:47] oh give the lord a shout let me say that
[49:49] again if your mind don't change you're
[49:51] not
[49:52] going to change
[49:53] you have to have an intent to do good
[49:56] you have to have an intent to do better
[49:58] you have to have an intent to press on
[50:01] from that mediocrity to some level of
[50:03] perfection or some place that is better
[50:06] than you higher than you
[50:08] that place that challenges you
[50:10] or give the lord a shout
[50:13] you don't want to bring people down to
[50:15] where you are you want to go to where
[50:16] others are in the sense of if there's a
[50:19] better place i want a better place
[50:22] we'll give the lord a shout amen
[50:25] [Applause]
[50:26] too many people like to and encourage
[50:28] people in their realm
[50:30] so if their realm is one one friend they
[50:32] want to stay with one friend
[50:34] and if this person talks to somebody
[50:35] else they say no don't go there i want
[50:36] you to be my one friend because i am one
[50:38] on one
[50:41] and that's not christianity
[50:43] christianity you have to reach out
[50:46] you have to go beyond your family
[50:48] listen look your mother do you say who's
[50:50] my mother
[50:51] who's my mother he said all i'm doing i
[50:52] will love my father my mother brother
[50:54] sister you see if i come out i'll give
[50:55] your brothers and sisters your family
[50:57] give you up go get their new family
[51:00] oh gloria you are my family
[51:02] you're my real family
[51:04] my natural family we call mother and
[51:05] father and jean and resemblance and what
[51:08] is natural but this is spiritual now
[51:10] because the blood of jesus make us get
[51:12] connected we join from the same blood
[51:15] the same blood for you is the blood for
[51:16] me you hear what i said the same blood
[51:18] for you the same forgiveness god gave me
[51:20] is for you too we'll give the lord a
[51:22] shout in the house it's one blood by one
[51:26] blood hallelujah the price to redeem all
[51:28] of us
[51:29] therefore all of us have a right to have
[51:31] access to his presence that's why you
[51:33] bust a veil from the top to the bottom
[51:36] you don't have to be as you are you
[51:37] don't have to live as you are your life
[51:39] can be changed and transformed my life
[51:41] has been
[51:43] oh glory to god and some of you here
[51:44] your life has been also and i trust this
[51:47] service be a transformational service to
[51:50] you today
[51:51] oh give the lord a shout amen
[51:54] so divine revelation
[51:56] is when you know
[51:58] in your heart
[51:59] it is going to happen
[52:01] there is nothing but just revelation
[52:04] oh praise god now in the humanistic is
[52:07] where this one hurts your feelings and
[52:08] you're feeling bad where you can't even
[52:10] connect to romans 8 28 and you and you
[52:13] and you know this happened and instead
[52:15] of you drop back on your word that is
[52:17] what the word does you know you see when
[52:19] you rock back on your word because who
[52:21] prays the name of the lord let me get it
[52:22] here the spiritual faith only recognizes
[52:25] what
[52:26] the word so when something happened your
[52:27] life is hidden you know i know all
[52:29] things work together for good
[52:31] see your sister do you something your
[52:32] brother do something it's not your
[52:33] sister brother you know is the devil
[52:35] that jump on your brother and sister
[52:37] it's not your brother or sister and the
[52:38] devil say hit them now let them know do
[52:40] it no do him no and they in a spirit and
[52:42] they do you something and you are to
[52:44] forgive them because god watching you
[52:46] look not watching them you know you've
[52:47] been tested
[52:49] because you have the right attitude so
[52:51] he could put the test on you he could
[52:53] put charge on you
[52:54] you know what he consider you qualify to
[52:56] take it to the next level
[52:58] oh give the lord a shout you see you're
[53:00] qualified to take it to the next level
[53:02] your pastor's test next test your
[53:04] pastor's test next test your pastor's
[53:06] death next test don't stop studying oh
[53:09] because the test is coming
[53:11] oh glory to god give the lord a shout
[53:14] don't stop learning because the test is
[53:17] coming you'll be left behind if you
[53:19] don't keep up you've got to keep up
[53:26] the keep up in god's university
[53:29] and what i love about god's university
[53:31] you don't even have to be able to read
[53:32] all right
[53:37] oh god because peter couldn't read all
[53:39] right but they had to take note you have
[53:40] been with jesus you see revelation glory
[53:44] glory
[53:46] glory
[53:47] hallelujah you see when somebody speaks
[53:49] something people take it this way like i
[53:51] put that glass here with half the water
[53:53] inside what somebody see some people say
[53:55] half full some people say half empty
[53:57] you see the negative people will say it
[53:59] half empty version
[54:01] the positive person said half full
[54:03] it's the same glass
[54:04] same level but two different pictures
[54:07] being seen
[54:08] but when revelation comes it's the same
[54:10] picture
[54:11] so what god does when god brings
[54:13] revelation by the cliff he bypass the
[54:15] intellect and it comes from heaven
[54:18] straight to the heart
[54:20] so there is no interpretation in between
[54:22] there was no man in between there was no
[54:25] senses in between when the revelation
[54:27] hit abraham our old man oh glory to god
[54:31] he said i'm gonna have a son the doctor
[54:33] tell him you're crazy he said i'm gonna
[54:35] have a son he said you're more crazy i'm
[54:37] going to have a son he said why are you
[54:39] saying that abraham he said because god
[54:42] said
[54:44] so
[54:45] and once god speak it
[54:47] he said my word come on now
[54:49] shall not return
[54:51] unto me void
[54:53] but it shall accomplish
[54:55] oh god you could hang your soul
[54:57] upon the word of god there's going to be
[55:00] a revival there's going to be a mightier
[55:03] point of the spirit

[1:00:59] and although he's telling his son that
[1:01:01] he'll hold isaac tie up his hand drop

[1:01:45] called that place brother isaac jehovah
[1:01:47] jireh isn't that right god has provided
[1:01:51] god will provide you've got to get an
[1:01:54] experience of this jehovah jireh that

[1:02:27] but listen
[1:02:28] in accepting of your faith
[1:02:31] god confirms your feet
[1:02:34] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:02:37] if you say you believe and you don't get
[1:02:39] the baptism of the holy ghost then
[1:02:42] it's your faith isn't accepted in the
[1:02:44] sight of god you've got a mental feet
[1:02:48] instead of a hard feet
[1:02:50] oh brother of it there's two kind of
[1:02:52] faith
[1:02:53] yes there is one is a mental fate
[1:02:57] and one is a heart feet
[1:02:59] or spiritual fate when you truly believe
[1:03:02] god god is under obligation to pour the
[1:03:05] holy ghost on you
[1:03:08] on you
[1:03:10] not you are the holy ghost that's a lie
[1:03:13] on you
[1:03:15] he's gonna pour it on you like he pulled
[1:03:17] on peter you see we don't have power in
[1:03:19] ourselves unless god gives it
[1:03:22] god have to give you power and they have
[1:03:25] to have a promise of power coming to you
[1:03:27] and he said you shall receive power acts
[1:03:29] 1 8 after the holy ghost
[1:03:31] come upon you your mother can't give you
[1:03:33] that power your father can't give you
[1:03:35] that power the pastor cannot give you
[1:03:37] that power only god himself could do it
[1:03:40] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:03:46] [Music]
[1:03:49] if you look and live
[1:03:51] you hear the gospel preached
[1:03:53] on the basis of the word that settles it
[1:03:56] you are here right there but here we go
[1:03:59] you cannot be healed by mental faith
[1:04:04] you have got to be healed
[1:04:06] by a real living faith from your heart
[1:04:10] remember the man that was blind came in
[1:04:12] the prayer line with the brown and pray
[1:04:14] for him he said you are healed
[1:04:16] and you walk out there
[1:04:18] like blind as ever he said but i'm not

[1:04:22] runs back in the prayer line he said i
[1:04:24] told you you're healed
[1:04:25] but he was a catholic
[1:04:27] and his faith had nothing to rest on
[1:04:30] you see so god have to give him the word
[1:04:33] he said go and say
[1:04:34] by stripes
[1:04:36] i'm healed now what's that that's the
[1:04:37] scripture
[1:04:39] as you would know that's the word that
[1:04:40] god could ride on that's the conduit
[1:04:43] that the spirit could move through
[1:04:44] that like a pipe
[1:04:46] not like a wire that's where the current
[1:04:48] can go through
[1:04:49] the current could pass through the wood
[1:04:51] so here it is he's selling newspapers at
[1:04:53] the side of the road extra extra by
[1:04:55] shrapnel heal extra extra buy it by ship
[1:04:57] i'm here people mocking him people
[1:05:00] laughing him he is bearing the reproach
[1:05:02] for the world by his stripes i am healed
[1:05:05] he's speaking that coming out of his
[1:05:06] mouth he's going to get the haircut so
[1:05:09] he's in the barber chair and he's
[1:05:11] staying by stripe i'm here and the baba
[1:05:13] making fun of what all of a sudden his
[1:05:15] eyes pop open
[1:05:17] what happened that mental fate
[1:05:19] dropped the inside of his heart and it
[1:05:22] produced a manifestation of his actual
[1:05:24] healing
[1:05:25] all glory that god had dropped from head
[1:05:27] to heart
[1:05:29] all glory to god and the healing was
[1:05:31] produced
[1:05:32] it was no longer mental something it was
[1:05:34] a living reality oh glory to god do you
[1:05:37] believe that
[1:05:39] hallelujah
[1:05:40] my
[1:05:41] you said no you cannot be healed by
[1:05:43] mental fate you've got to be healed by
[1:05:45] reliving faith from your heart no matter
[1:05:48] how much you woke up here no matter how
[1:05:50] much you disbelieve up here if something
[1:05:52] down here tells you it's over it is over
[1:05:55] that settles it there is no more fear at
[1:05:58] all
[1:05:58] nobody could tell you any different you
[1:06:00] don't know
[1:06:02] why you believe it it's not reason
[1:06:06] it is faith
[1:06:07] you just believe it and that's the way
[1:06:10] it takes place
[1:06:11] you believe it and go on no matter what
[1:06:13] your sense of knowledge would say it's
[1:06:15] not in reasoning
[1:06:17] remember the woman couldn't have a baby
[1:06:19] and the prophet dustin lori have a child
[1:06:22] and she went among some friends and some
[1:06:24] you know women talk gossipers and
[1:06:26] whatnot and didn't believe it after a
[1:06:27] while and whatnot she came back to
[1:06:28] brother branham and says
[1:06:31] you know barbara my you know i went
[1:06:32] among friends and didn't believe it and
[1:06:34] what that he said what did he say
[1:06:37] because when he said thus say lord
[1:06:38] that's the third level
[1:06:40] that's his vision
[1:06:41] that can't fail
[1:06:42] he said what did he say he said whether
[1:06:44] i believe it or don't believe it it's
[1:06:46] still happening
[1:06:50] why because thus said the lord
[1:06:52] at that third level you don't even count
[1:06:54] in the picture
[1:06:56] oh glory to god it's thoughts here the
[1:06:58] lord
[1:06:59] what give the lord some praises
[1:07:01] when lazarus was dead
[1:07:03] and jesus said lazarus comfort lazarus
[1:07:06] can't say i ain't coming
[1:07:08] are you feeling left to come
[1:07:10] that was vision there
[1:07:12] when that word the voice of the
[1:07:14] archangel went on to get lazarus
[1:07:16] strike his soul bring it to the spirit
[1:07:18] bring it back into the body he had us to
[1:07:20] raise from the dead
[1:07:22] and when god break vision
[1:07:24] all your family
[1:07:25] all your loved ones anybody that you
[1:07:28] were connected with
[1:07:29] glory to god happy right i give you your
[1:07:32] two sons
[1:07:33] oh give the lord i shall
[1:07:36] that's the realm the bride will be going
[1:07:37] into
[1:07:38] that's the rate i'm adopted son you'll
[1:07:40] be going into oh the spoken word
[1:07:43] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:07:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:07:48] thank you jesus all right let's continue
[1:07:52] he's talking about patience and so forth
[1:07:54] he said the biggest part of our fate is
[1:07:56] mental fate
[1:07:57] say faith is a big circle the biggest
[1:07:59] part is mental right
[1:08:02] and that faith here watch
[1:08:05] by hearing the word it brings us to a
[1:08:07] mental recognition of god
[1:08:09] you see people like to say fake my hair
[1:08:11] here in the wood
[1:08:12] but when you look at it deeper and you
[1:08:14] slice it neatly you recognize there's
[1:08:16] two things there
[1:08:18] faith come here and hearing with the
[1:08:19] word
[1:08:20] mental fate
[1:08:21] mental fit here in the world but that
[1:08:23] mental fit is to become a spiritual
[1:08:25] faith here is how
[1:08:27] this service today is important
[1:08:30] it is very important
[1:08:32] oh this means more to you than you think
[1:08:35] because a lot of people don't have the
[1:08:37] revelation they think they have they
[1:08:39] have an understanding they have a
[1:08:41] knowledge they read it they know it but
[1:08:43] do you have a revelation of it because
[1:08:46] revelation is prevailing power
[1:08:49] shelter prevailing power
[1:08:51] revelation is prevailing power
[1:08:53] you know what faith is this is something
[1:08:55] that's revealed to you that is not yet
[1:08:57] but it will be
[1:08:59] oh give the lord a praise glory
[1:09:03] not your feeling to work out
[1:09:05] not your opinion gonna work out
[1:09:07] it's revealed
[1:09:09] [Applause]
[1:09:11] and if it's revealed you can't miss it
[1:09:13] if you try
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:15] [Applause]
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:17] it's
[1:09:18] revealed next example jericho walls
[1:09:22] first thing god tell them take jericho

[1:16:08] the flesh they was out of the humanistic
[1:16:10] realm they were the realm of divine
[1:16:12] revelation so even though jordan was
[1:16:14] high there are no instructions what god
[1:16:17] said is the most important thing all you
[1:16:19] want to hear is from god
[1:16:21] the first thing is to hear from god the
[1:16:24] second thing is to obey his instructions
[1:16:27] oh glory to god you will be seated i'm
[1:16:30] excited this morning many people not
[1:16:32] hearing from god the hearing lies their
[1:16:35] interpretation the young men's idea they
[1:16:37] again long long drawn out intellectual
[1:16:40] sermons they are not hearing from god
[1:16:43] but he said there is another people on
[1:16:44] their land under their messenger they're
[1:16:47] gonna be the final voice to the final
[1:16:49] age once more the world will hear direct
[1:16:53] from god you have a promise that the

[1:17:30] fear of the feeling in the spirit this
[1:17:32] is what you have to be in for revelation
[1:17:34] to break
[1:17:35] that's why god reject their churches god
[1:17:38] reject lukewarm churches god reject the
[1:17:40] intellectual churches he rejected

[1:25:26] drinking smoking party and friend
[1:25:28] and you're leaning in the show
[1:25:31] he's only a bartender
[1:25:33] you go drinking
[1:25:36] because that's your friend a bartender
[1:25:38] he must invite you over his drinks he
[1:25:40] drinks here

[1:25:50] let's make you smoking you know
[1:25:52] the way a tree leans that's the way
[1:25:54] you're going to fall
[1:25:56] so you want to lean the right way

[1:26:01] way you're going to come out right
[1:26:03] oh give the lord a shout
[1:26:05] so then the church is built faith
[1:26:08] virtue knowledge temperance this was a
[1:26:11] hidden mystery
[1:26:12] the devil didn't know god of restoring
[1:26:15] evil
[1:26:16] another eve
[1:26:18] but this one can't fall
[1:26:20] or can't fail
[1:26:22] because she's built upon a rock
[1:26:24] so all through the church ages god is
[1:26:26] really restoring the statue of a perfect
[1:26:28] man
[1:26:29] but he takes seven ages and disguise it
[1:26:32] under the nose of satan so satan
[1:26:34] couldn't understand the mystery
[1:26:36] of what was being lived out
[1:26:38] and in this age he take a light and
[1:26:40] shine on it and said this is what
[1:26:42] happened back there and what happened
[1:26:43] back there is supposed to happen in you
[1:26:46] so and you have to have a faith
[1:26:48] a spiritual fate a rock revelation
[1:26:52] that is what he's building his church on
[1:26:54] he put a slab of faith inside your soul
[1:26:57] and upon that he put virtual power upon
[1:27:00] that he put knowledge upon that he put
[1:27:02] temperance upon that he put patience
[1:27:04] upon that he put codiness
[1:27:06] on top of that you put broadly kindness
[1:27:08] and you're standing there like you're
[1:27:10] back in the garden of eden waiting for
[1:27:12] holy spirit waiting for charity
[1:27:15] breathing for the pride's absolute
[1:27:21] then the holy spirit comes
[1:27:23] and cements it together
[1:27:25] so when you have all these virtues here
[1:27:28] love of god
[1:27:29] paul call it a bund of perfectness that
[1:27:32] cement the whole time because if you're
[1:27:33] doing it if you don't get it cemented
[1:27:35] you've got leaks
[1:27:36] leaks in your patients leaks in your
[1:27:38] knowledge leaks leaks leaks but when god
[1:27:40] seal it it becomes waterproof seal proof
[1:27:44] devil proof oh glory to god
[1:27:47] that come like when god gave
[1:27:49] abraham not abraham noah the revelation
[1:27:51] to get by some would and people laugh
[1:27:54] and they said boy are you expecting rain
[1:27:55] and that what's so soft
[1:27:57] that would so pour us
[1:27:59] god doesn't give all the revelation one
[1:28:00] time
[1:28:01] so abraham um noah build the act with
[1:28:03] this soft word
[1:28:05] and then god gave him a foot of
[1:28:06] revelation
[1:28:07] get pitched
[1:28:09] and seal it up
[1:28:10] you know we are pitch right
[1:28:12] if you go down that road no you're gonna
[1:28:13] say we've got no revelation i'm not
[1:28:15] going there
[1:28:16] but god tell noah
[1:28:18] take pictures and seal this up and the
[1:28:20] porous wood was the right material to
[1:28:23] absorb the pitch
[1:28:25] and make it waterproof
[1:28:27] so god is no fool he's the function of
[1:28:30] wisdom
[1:28:31] if he said pass some wood software don't
[1:28:33] ask him and fight up with that just do
[1:28:36] what he said
[1:28:37] more revelation coming
[1:28:40] oh gloria god gave the lord a shout
[1:28:43] after he built the act
[1:28:45] and the revelation come to seal the
[1:28:47] whole thing that back was waterproof
[1:28:49] and noah could withstand 40 days 40
[1:28:51] nights

[1:28:54] so say when these things come then the
[1:28:56] capstone come the holy spirit cemented

[1:37:44] they cannot know nothing about it it's
[1:37:46] impossible for them to know anything
[1:37:48] about it god has hid the senses of
[1:37:51] knowing it from the very elected
[1:37:53] teachers
[1:37:54] and everything else
[1:37:56] so man studying theology have doctor

[1:40:13] and watched his snake
[1:40:15] eat up them two snakes and then take up
[1:40:17] the road and in his mind he said this is

[1:41:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:41:12] my god
[1:41:13] hallelujah
[1:41:15] so it's impossible for them to know
[1:41:16] anything about it god has hid the senses
[1:41:20] of knowing it
[1:41:21] from the elected teachers
[1:41:24] and everything else
[1:41:25] here's why
[1:41:27] by the punch
[1:41:28] it's a personal
[1:41:30] individual of
[1:41:31] with the person
[1:41:33] that christ is revealed to them
[1:41:35] what fightful are you talking about
[1:41:39] so fifo ministries stand between god and
[1:41:41] the people
[1:41:42] that's a that's that's not the gospel
[1:41:43] now that's nobody by petition because
[1:41:46] they're men trying to take the place of
[1:41:47] god between you
[1:41:49] and god
[1:41:50] because god is the god of the audience
[1:41:52] he wants to speak directly to his people
[1:41:55] by his spirit right now we're speaking
[1:41:57] words but the spirit will take the words
[1:41:59] and reveal it to you
[1:42:01] as his son our eyes daughter and you
[1:42:04] leave here with revelation in your heart
[1:42:06] that your husband no no your wife don't
[1:42:07] know your children or your family you
[1:42:09] know the person sitting in front to the
[1:42:11] side to be behind you don't even know
[1:42:13] but a rock
[1:42:14] a faith
[1:42:16] a revelation is inside your soul
[1:42:19] [Music]
[1:42:21] listen
[1:42:22] not even the pastor could know
[1:42:25] think about that
[1:42:27] if he could do anything about that
[1:42:29] not even the pastor
[1:42:31] could know
[1:42:32] because he's not revealing truly pastor
[1:42:34] in that sense he's revealed by the
[1:42:36] spirit
[1:42:37] jesus didn't call peter's side and said
[1:42:39] peter say say i'm the christian the
[1:42:40] christ
[1:42:42] i favor you peter peter peter then
[1:42:44] brothers don't know you know you see the
[1:42:45] other guys
[1:42:47] no
[1:42:48] peter said that was the christ
[1:42:50] and jesus said oh flesh and blood didn't
[1:42:53] give that to you
[1:42:54] you
[1:42:55] and what's up you ain't get out in
[1:42:57] a story you read this in a book that is
[1:42:59] nice inspiration that is revelation and
[1:43:02] is my father who give that to you this
[1:43:04] is what i'm going to build my church on
[1:43:07] revelation from heaven
[1:43:09] that was the key
[1:43:11] peter heard from heaven
[1:43:13] you have to hear from heaven not your
[1:43:15] mother
[1:43:16] not your father
[1:43:17] not the pastor you have to hear from
[1:43:20] heaven
[1:43:22] oh glory to god and your lord the lord
[1:43:26] himself be saddened from heaven with a
[1:43:29] shout
[1:43:30] the angel is on the earth
[1:43:32] [Music]
[1:43:38] [Applause]
[1:43:45] my lord
[1:43:46] if you say
[1:43:49] he has been revealed to me
[1:43:51] then the life
[1:43:53] that christ produced here in the bible
[1:43:55] that same life is in him
[1:43:57] does not produce itself in you
[1:44:00] then you got a wrong revelation
[1:44:03] so a man came to be
[1:44:05] mr mystery
[1:44:06] [Music]
[1:44:08] a man came to me
[1:44:09] mr message pope
[1:44:11] have all the revelations and everything
[1:44:12] else
[1:44:13] no after they appreciate mysteries i
[1:44:15] want to see the life
[1:44:20] your life is not useful
[1:44:24] so we hear a new sermon
[1:44:26] but life is your life
[1:44:28] that's why i said it ministry which is
[1:44:29] perfection when christ is reproduced in
[1:44:33] natural among human beings
[1:44:36] so it's not how much word a man could
[1:44:38] talk i want to see his walk
[1:44:40] i want to see his life i wanted his
[1:44:42] attitude to poor people to rich people
[1:44:44] to this people our aptitude towards this
[1:44:47] adapt attitude towards issues and
[1:44:49] problems when things go wrong how you're
[1:44:51] managing it conflict will always come
[1:44:53] you heard that teaching praise god it's
[1:44:55] how your manager conflict how your
[1:44:57] managing issues how you manage your
[1:44:58] challenges will show evidently if you
[1:45:01] have knowledge if you have understanding
[1:45:02] or if you have wisdom or give the lord
[1:45:04] some praises
[1:45:06] hallelujah if you don't have knowledge
[1:45:08] get it you don't have wisdom ask god oh
[1:45:10] glory to god that's good for
[1:45:12] understanding but all these things are
[1:45:13] there for you
[1:45:15] let's see i can wrap up here
[1:45:20] if the life of jesus ever puts out
[1:45:23] another body of believers
[1:45:26] it will be the fruit that the first one
[1:45:28] did
[1:45:29] they will write a book of acts behind it
[1:45:33] so we don't have to say this church is
[1:45:34] it anytime anybody say that you know
[1:45:36] that is off
[1:45:38] he said if the life hit a body of
[1:45:40] believers
[1:45:41] what would happen where's the fruit of
[1:45:42] that i know tracks are not books and no
[1:45:46] tips no it will produce another
[1:45:50] book of acts
[1:45:51] you know what happened in the book of
[1:45:52] acts hallelujah philip 20 if you're on
[1:45:54] you knock this one one there this one
[1:45:56] gets stoned this one gets shipwrecked
[1:45:59] this one get this and that and all can
[1:46:00] happen in the book of acts people have
[1:46:02] gone to the corners house that's another
[1:46:03] book of acts you are led by the spirit
[1:46:06] of god oh glory not not led by no man
[1:46:09] you led by the spirit of the living god
[1:46:11] because the word is anew the secret is
[1:46:13] what the word is in the bride and she
[1:46:15] has the mind of christ and oak what to
[1:46:17] do with the word or what he wants done
[1:46:20] with the word oh give the lord a shout
[1:46:23] god want you delivered this morning
[1:46:26] hallelujah praise god god wants you free
[1:46:28] this morning
[1:46:30] hallelujah
[1:46:33] here we go god is known
[1:46:36] by simplicity
[1:46:38] and of revelation
[1:46:40] of jesus christ to the most illiterate
[1:46:43] person
[1:46:44] a person can read and call right and god
[1:46:47] could give them revelation oh i love him
[1:46:50] this morning so he cancelled the
[1:46:52] university degree cancel the doctorate
[1:46:54] cancel all the education thing he can
[1:46:56] bypass all education and give you
[1:46:58] revelation in your soul and no man could
[1:47:01] take it out
[1:47:02] education can't take it out intellectual
[1:47:04] caretaker though it has to go past your
[1:47:06] intellect oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:47:10] my god
[1:47:12] listen it's not your theology it's a
[1:47:14] revelation of jesus christ upon this
[1:47:16] rock i'll build my church no other rock
[1:47:18] accepted no other things accepted no
[1:47:20] other roman rock no other protestant
[1:47:22] rock no other school no nothing but on
[1:47:24] exactly the revelation of jesus christ
[1:47:27] through the new birth he's born in there
[1:47:29] and he injects his own life and your
[1:47:31] life is gone and the life of christ is
[1:47:33] projecting itself through you
[1:47:36] with
[1:47:37] the preeminences to the people that they
[1:47:40] see the very life and works
[1:47:43] we're not talking about sermon we're not
[1:47:45] talking about message we're talking
[1:47:47] about seeing the very life and works
[1:47:50] praise god and signs and wonders that he
[1:47:54] did is doing the same thing through you
[1:47:57] outside of that the rest of it not even
[1:48:00] called to at all
[1:48:01] watch god's great revelation unfolding
[1:48:05] here we go are you ready
[1:48:07] by lack of this revelation
[1:48:10] is why we have so many divisions
[1:48:13] among us
[1:48:15] it's not by revelations we have
[1:48:17] divisions it's the lack of it
[1:48:19] it's intellectual men humanistic realm
[1:48:23] aha it's just three realms
[1:48:25] daily humanistic realm
[1:48:27] preaching the gospel you're watching a
[1:48:29] man who have complexes behind the pulpit
[1:48:32] you bring them complexes to the people
[1:48:33] you know
[1:48:34] a man who insecure behind the pulpit as
[1:48:36] a pastor minister that insecurity will
[1:48:38] manifest with how we handle the people
[1:48:40] they want to leave you he had hurt
[1:48:44] and he's fighting others and he's
[1:48:45] fighting like he saw like sword fighting
[1:48:48] and they're doing a lovely church more
[1:48:49] than jesus
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:53] by lack of this revelation is why we
[1:48:56] have so many different divisions among
[1:48:58] us and so much mockery so much division
[1:49:00] among us is because the people lack that
[1:49:02] revelation they lack the revelation the
[1:49:05] teachers
[1:49:07] but obama said the teachers the very
[1:49:09] elected teachers in this message
[1:49:11] lack revelation of jesus christ that is
[1:49:14] why we have divisions
[1:49:17] it's not so much his body like this
[1:49:18] mother and that brother likes but you
[1:49:19] know they lack revelation because if i
[1:49:21] go to the blood and i get the experience
[1:49:23] of the blood and calvini cross and i see
[1:49:25] where god pardon me my sins and calls
[1:49:26] customer my sins and perch me deliver me
[1:49:29] you'll tell me our next minister he
[1:49:30] heard the blood yet
[1:49:32] so he can't say i'm his brother
[1:49:36] the same blood for me is for he too
[1:49:39] he do like if he owned the blood
[1:49:41] i owned up jesus blood i owe jesus blood
[1:49:44] one day when jesus up on the cross he
[1:49:46] give it to me and you are lost
[1:49:48] i just made that offer
[1:49:53] thank god
[1:49:54] these people not controlling heaven
[1:49:57] thank god they're not standing as the
[1:49:58] gatekeeper to openly get a letter and
[1:50:00] because when they see your soul they
[1:50:01] call the legit
[1:50:02] thank god they're not the gatekeeper
[1:50:04] oh glory to god i thank god i'm free
[1:50:07] this morning and for the praise him if
[1:50:09] you don't want to shout i'll shout for
[1:50:11] you if you don't want to praise god i

[1:50:35] drinks you'd rather buy gifts or extra
[1:50:37] outside woman get out of a normal woman
[1:50:39] you have nothing extra to pay for oh god
[1:50:41] there's plenty savings when you're
[1:50:42] saving jesus oh god the liquor store

[1:50:46] you the drug dealer
[1:50:48] he can't get you no i'm getting here oh
[1:50:50] give the lord i shout
[1:50:52] glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:50:56] glory listen to this now
[1:50:59] there are two different types of
[1:51:00] christianity seems strange but i'm not
[1:51:02] saying two different types i'll say two
[1:51:04] different phases with a better word two
[1:51:07] phases
[1:51:08] one of them is an intellectual
[1:51:10] or mental conception of what god has
[1:51:13] said in his word
[1:51:14] and jesus christ by way of knowledge
[1:51:17] and the other is an experimental
[1:51:20] experience that god give the man in his
[1:51:23] heart
[1:51:24] there's two different things
[1:51:25] don't let
[1:51:26] let's collect two different ministers
[1:51:28] two different pastors one is
[1:51:30] intellectual by knowledge and one have
[1:51:32] an experience of god in the heart
[1:51:34] there's two different ministries there
[1:51:36] my student from influence is there
[1:51:38] there's two different effects there now
[1:51:40] one with knowledge the devil could write
[1:51:42] that
[1:51:43] the one with experience in the heart god
[1:51:45] could write
[1:51:47] yeah that
[1:51:47] devil is an intellectual part don't you
[1:51:49] know that
[1:51:51] 99.9 correct
[1:51:53] but there's no spirit behind that
[1:51:56] god's spirit has to be behind it
[1:51:59] see
[1:52:00] so when david david handled bay and lion
[1:52:03] and he come to bring victoria's and
[1:52:04] bring a
[1:52:05] mama lead on whatever it is from his
[1:52:07] father for his brothers because you know
[1:52:09] the battle hut she brought a little
[1:52:11] delicacy and thing fish brothers the
[1:52:13] brothers attitude towards david see
[1:52:15] where you come for you come and see the
[1:52:16] battle
[1:52:17] for so much knights gulag coming every
[1:52:19] day send me a man they may move in the
[1:52:20] only shopping store in here do you want
[1:52:22] to put the big mufflers on the ears
[1:52:24] because they want to hear goliath so
[1:52:26] they stopped listening to god no they
[1:52:28] need sharpening sword polishing boots
[1:52:30] shining shield and spear and whatnot
[1:52:33] sent me a man
[1:52:34] david come and when them brothers rough
[1:52:36] up david like david about to leave all
[1:52:38] right they're going and then go out say
[1:52:40] send me a man who is that uncircumcised
[1:52:44] david reaction was immediate you know
[1:52:46] david again
[1:52:47] look at his size
[1:52:49] i wonder how we make those shoes for him
[1:52:51] who developed that spear look at the
[1:52:53] size of that now anytime they started go
[1:52:55] that way you're finished
[1:52:57] david wasn't watching seize you know
[1:52:59] he said what are you doing here
[1:53:01] who's that uncircumcised philistine
[1:53:03] defining army living god so he was just
[1:53:06] either trying to present himself you
[1:53:07] know he was just saying who is that
[1:53:09] and then he said a talk but but i was in
[1:53:11] the backside of the desert and a lion
[1:53:13] come and i kill him
[1:53:15] and a bear come and i kill him
[1:53:20] he's got to testify and when he's had a
[1:53:22] test nobody had no testimony at all
[1:53:24] everybody watching this spoke on the
[1:53:25] books and reading nobody reading
[1:53:27] everybody fellowship in the first around
[1:53:28] the world no testimony so when they hear
[1:53:31] this young man with this testimony they
[1:53:32] say we had to hear this in seoul when
[1:53:34] saul here he's a gunfight gunfight
[1:53:35] gunfight cause you feeling shame

[1:59:55] intellectual conceptions
[1:59:57] but the working of the holy spirit the
[2:00:00] kingdom of god in you
[2:00:02] god sets on the tone of your heart
[2:00:04] in his control room
[2:00:06] controlling your emotions are you ready
[2:00:08] controlling your powers
[2:00:10] controlling your conceptions making you
[2:00:12] one with him in fellowship and in love
[2:00:15] god fills you with love
[2:00:17] he fills you with power he fills you
[2:00:20] with the spirit he fills you with his
[2:00:22] own divine nature and he changes your
[2:00:24] carnal nature into his nature then you
[2:00:27] become a new creature in christ jesus
[2:00:30] we are one
[2:00:31] not the further our denomination
[2:00:33] not the further occult or some creed we
[2:00:36] are one to further the kingdom of god
[2:00:39] oh glory to god
[2:00:41] and when you get that kind of change the
[2:00:43] birds seem different
[2:00:45] oh everything seemed different you have
[2:00:47] no enemies they all look sweet you can
[2:00:49] forgive everything that they have ever
[2:00:51] done i think that would say sit reading
[2:00:53] slowly again
[2:00:56] you can forgive
[2:00:58] every
[2:01:00] is everything
[2:01:01] yeah i think i think i think everything
[2:01:03] i see in there everything that ever done
[2:01:06] the bitterest of enemy you could pray
[2:01:08] for him
[2:01:09] on the street
[2:01:11] and put you so all the people on every
[2:01:13] homie and crossing the street damn
[2:01:14] trouble you could you could pray for him
[2:01:16] on the street and put your arm around
[2:01:18] him and lift him up no matter what creed
[2:01:20] what denomination he belongs to he's a
[2:01:23] creature that christ died for
[2:01:28] [Applause]
[2:01:29] all right we're in home church here now
[2:01:32] all christianity
[2:01:34] all you are
[2:01:35] all you ever will be is based upon faith
[2:01:37] in the word
[2:01:38] all you are and all you ever will be
[2:01:41] is based upon faith in this world oh my
[2:01:45] hallelujah
[2:01:46] oh my
[2:01:47] then we can have this kind of faith the
[2:01:49] faith that jesus had christ had and
[2:01:51] christ's fate was not based in those
[2:01:53] pharisees or sadducees all those spots
[2:01:54] and petals and pans and their washing it
[2:01:57] was based upon the word of god amen so
[2:01:59] much still christ was the word the word
[2:02:01] was made flesh and then we can get so
[2:02:03] transfused
[2:02:04] by his power that we die to our own
[2:02:06] thinking and our faith becomes a genuine
[2:02:09] feat then the life of christ is
[2:02:12] transfused into us we become a living
[2:02:15] creatures of god a dwelling place where
[2:02:18] the holy spirit can send this radiant
[2:02:19] blessing down through here and win the
[2:02:22] statue of christ oh my what is faith oh
[2:02:25] praise god faith is something revealed
[2:02:27] to you that is not yet but you believe
[2:02:30] it will be
[2:02:31] faith is a revelation of the will of god
[2:02:33] so by revelation and the churches today
[2:02:36] don't even believe in spiritual
[2:02:37] revelation they don't they believe in
[2:02:39] the past man
[2:02:41] they believe in apostle man they believe
[2:02:43] in pope man they don't believe in
[2:02:45] revelation that the word could be
[2:02:47] revealed to you watch the church today
[2:02:49] don't believe in spiritual revelation
[2:02:51] they believe in dogmatic
[2:02:53] teaching of some system
[2:02:56] we believe it's so this is how we
[2:02:58] believe it and you nail it down we
[2:03:00] nailed it on this morning
[2:03:03] and the people kneel not the christ they
[2:03:05] nailed not to the holy ghost they nailed
[2:03:07] our system
[2:03:08] and when it says that nearly you can't
[2:03:09] move
[2:03:11] frozen
[2:03:12] hallelujah the church's build up so much
[2:03:15] systems around the world until he shook
[2:03:17] her off the rocker dumped christ john
[2:03:19] the baptist right she had burpees once a
[2:03:21] prophet come bring bull pains what was
[2:03:23] it back to the word back to the life
[2:03:25] systems doesn't have a life it's only
[2:03:28] god's word has life
[2:03:29] systems are built around it
[2:03:31] but it doesn't have life
[2:03:33] oh my hallelujah praise peter jesus
[2:03:38] oh my thank you lord let me see wrap up
[2:03:41] here now
[2:03:42] we know this one remember this christ in
[2:03:44] the true church is a continuation of the
[2:03:45] book of acts and the book of revelation
[2:03:47] shows how the antichrist spirit would
[2:03:49] come into the church and defile it
[2:03:51] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[2:03:53] look at today it exposes satan revealing
[2:03:56] his works okay
[2:03:57] watch he fight he cannot stand that he
[2:04:00] knows he knows they would develop if the
[2:04:02] people
[2:04:03] get the true revelation
[2:04:06] of the true church
[2:04:07] what she is
[2:04:09] what she stands for that she can do the
[2:04:11] greater works she will be an invincible
[2:04:13] army if they get a true revelation of
[2:04:16] the two spirits working within the
[2:04:18] framework of the christian church and by
[2:04:20] god's spirit
[2:04:21] which stand he sinner withstand the
[2:04:23] antichrist spirit satan will power us
[2:04:25] before her he will be as definitely
[2:04:27] taught today as when christ withstood
[2:04:29] his every effort to gain power over in
[2:04:31] the desert satan hates revelation but we
[2:04:34] love it
[2:04:35] with true revelation in our lives the
[2:04:37] gates of hell cannot reveal against us
[2:04:40] but we will prevail against them
[2:04:43] oh my
[2:04:45] hallelujah
[2:04:46] thank you lord
[2:04:48] hallelujah
[2:04:49] glory hallelujah
[2:04:52] watch he said we'll not take just an
[2:04:54] ordinary study
[2:04:55] to make this book real
[2:04:57] it's going to take the operation of the
[2:04:58] holy ghost
[2:04:59] that means this book can't be revealed
[2:05:01] to anyone but a special class of people
[2:05:05] it will take one with prophetic insight
[2:05:07] it will require the ability to hear from
[2:05:09] god it will require supernatural
[2:05:12] instructions not just student comparing
[2:05:14] voice with this do that is good
[2:05:17] praise god as i said already this book
[2:05:20] of revelation is the confirmation of the
[2:05:22] scripture
[2:05:23] it is even placed exactly right in the
[2:05:24] canon of scripture at the end you know
[2:05:27] why it says that anyone who reads it or
[2:05:28] even hears it is blessed it is the
[2:05:30] revelation of god that will give you
[2:05:32] authority over the devil
[2:05:34] and you can see why they who would add
[2:05:37] or take from it would be cursed it would
[2:05:39] be so for who add or take over from the
[2:05:42] perfect revelation of god and overcome
[2:05:43] the enemy it's that simple
[2:05:45] oh my blessed be the name of the lord
[2:05:48] praise god so i'm gonna
[2:05:51] my god where do we go from here i've got
[2:05:53] to wrap up
[2:05:54] thank you jesus
[2:05:56] but i didn't get to one of the key
[2:05:57] things that i have here maybe on next
[2:05:59] week or so i'll see what law will do but
[2:06:01] but one person had a dream and we know
[2:06:03] the dream and there was this rock
[2:06:07] and with writing on it and then take a
[2:06:08] crowbar and rip off the writing and he
[2:06:11] tell him look on this
[2:06:13] and he was going west
[2:06:15] to get the opening of the world the seas
[2:06:16] and so on he said look on this and the
[2:06:18] ministers was looking at this and when
[2:06:19] they recognized he was going up and down
[2:06:21] and disappearing they move away you see
[2:06:23] very few state and look on this look on
[2:06:25] this on that pyramid look on this
[2:06:28] hallelujah
[2:06:29] nothing has been written there unwritten
[2:06:31] word it was called i wouldn't get an
[2:06:33] unwritten word
[2:06:35] look on this
[2:06:36] can you find it written
[2:06:38] oh what is it look inside and see what
[2:06:40] inside that it's a lie that will thunder
[2:06:43] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[2:06:46] praise god praise god
[2:06:49] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:06:51] all right i'll wrap up here you're gonna
[2:06:53] pray something
[2:06:55] he was praying raise up mighty men
[2:06:57] raise up mighty wires of the fate
[2:06:59] open this year law that hidden manner
[2:07:01] that rock beneath the rock that we might
[2:07:04] see the program of god cap off the
[2:07:06] pyramid of our life lord put the caption
[2:07:08] in christ jesus upon each and every one
[2:07:10] of us
[2:07:11] oh my
[2:07:13] hallelujah then he said pray may all the
[2:07:15] great mysteries that we are supposed to
[2:07:16] know at this age lord be unveiled to us
[2:07:18] that we will see the plainness of god so
[2:07:21] we will know
[2:07:22] how to behave ourselves wait a minute
[2:07:25] you mean the mysteries
[2:07:27] is to show god in his plainness that we
[2:07:29] can know how to behave yes
[2:07:32] because your behavior is what sets you
[2:07:34] up for adoption
[2:07:36] god only looking at how you will behave
[2:07:38] how you behave watch and correcting
[2:07:41] ourselves and bringing the members of
[2:07:42] bodies into discipline to it
[2:07:47] matthew 20 for the kingdom of heaven is
[2:07:49] like unto a man
[2:07:50] went on early
[2:07:51] the morning to hire laborers into his
[2:07:53] vineyard
[2:07:54] and when he had agreed with the laborers
[2:07:56] for a penny a day he sent him into his
[2:07:57] vineyard he went out about the third
[2:07:59] hour and saw others standing island in
[2:08:01] the marketplace and said go ye into the
[2:08:04] vineyard whatever is right i will give
[2:08:05] you and they went their way again he
[2:08:08] went out about the sixth and ninth hour
[2:08:09] and did likewise about the eleventh hour
[2:08:12] he went out found others standing idle
[2:08:14] said unto them why stand here idol they
[2:08:16] said unto him because no man had had us
[2:08:18] he said to them go ye into the vineyard
[2:08:20] whatever is right shall we receive
[2:08:22] and when even was come the lord of the
[2:08:24] vineyard said this george call the
[2:08:26] laborers
[2:08:27] give them the higher
[2:08:29] beginning from the last unto the first
[2:08:31] and when they came that were had at the
[2:08:33] 11th hour they receive every man a penny
[2:08:36] but when the first came they suppose
[2:08:38] that they should receive more
[2:08:40] and they likewise received every man a
[2:08:41] penny and they had received that they
[2:08:43] murmured against the good man of the
[2:08:44] house saying these lasts have woke for
[2:08:48] one hour that was made them equal unto
[2:08:50] us which i was born the burden of the
[2:08:52] heat of the day but he answered one of
[2:08:54] them and said friend i do thee no wrong
[2:08:57] this does not agree with me to work for
[2:08:59] a penny
[2:09:00] take that is dying and go thy way i will
[2:09:02] give unto this last he was unto thee is
[2:09:05] it not lawful for me to do what i want
[2:09:07] with my own is dynamic evil because i am
[2:09:09] good so the last shall be first and the
[2:09:12] first shall be last and drop the bomb
[2:09:14] for many be called
[2:09:16] but few are chosen
[2:09:19] the seventh angel's message is to open
[2:09:21] the mystery of the seals
[2:09:23] calling the 11th hour gentile workers to
[2:09:26] receive the same p
[2:09:28] oh my my my my my my and this is it
[2:09:31] finally
[2:09:33] watch
[2:09:34] the importance of revelation by the
[2:09:36] spirit
[2:09:37] to a true believer
[2:09:39] can never be over emphasized
[2:09:42] revelation means more to you than
[2:09:43] perhaps you realize

[2:09:47] revelation and you i am talking about
