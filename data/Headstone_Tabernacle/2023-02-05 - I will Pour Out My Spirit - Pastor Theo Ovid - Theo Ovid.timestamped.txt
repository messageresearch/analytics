[32:00] age it was the open door the Holy Ghost
[32:02] came through that door nobody was
[32:04] controlling that door no pork man no
[32:07] message man no interpretation man no
[32:10] intellectual man it was the age of the
[32:12] Holy Ghost it was the Holy Ghost season
[32:14] about a break God was waiting for Luther
[32:17] Wesley and then come the Holy Ghost
[32:19] because they take a spirit atmosphere
[32:21] where they release a prophet up in the
[32:23] word o Give the Lord a shout now the
[32:26] people that receive Holy Ghost 1906 they
[32:30] were not seed they were shocked that was
[32:32] the Pentecostal age because the world
[32:34] have to make a seed and the prophet
[32:36] didn't come yet so our age was bloated
[32:39] by Spirit but not by word okay the Lord
[32:42] I shout did you get what I'm saying now
[32:44] a whole age was builted by Spirit but
[32:48] not by word
[32:50] 1946 God called a prophet Angel of the
[32:53] Lord met him as John the Baptist isn't
[32:56] that right angel of God met him and God
[32:58] give him a message and that Mercy was to
[33:01] bring the seed to bring a bride or give
[33:04] the Lord a shout that is where you come
[33:07] in somebody had was to receive this
[33:10] bright call somebody had to receive this
[33:13] message and you are here today because
[33:16] you responded to this
[33:19] oh give the Lord I shout glory to God
[33:22] you may be seated now once you say seed
[33:26] you have to look at sower once you see
[33:29] sore you have to know who has to come
[33:30] back son of man son of man is the sword
[33:33] of the good seed look something that is
[33:35] reveals that even though shall be in the
[33:38] day that the son of man is revealed so
[33:41] God make sure the promise of son of man
[33:43] has to be in this time to reveal the
[33:46] seed and the seed after the Bible has to
[33:49] be the Bible in you which is the
[33:51] Original Seed which is the spoken word
[33:53] itself so God revealed to a prophet a
[33:57] son of man the son of man with your
[33:59] original seed to bring forth a bride do
[34:02] you believe that
[34:04] so therefore that Pentecostal was the
[34:06] shock because they rejected the Malachi
[34:09] for Prophet that have the seed oh my
[34:13] here we go are you ready now what about
[34:16] him we cannot have the last day
[34:19] until people get in the spirit of the
[34:23] last day
[34:27] so the last day have a last day spirit
[34:32] and when the people get into the last
[34:33] day Spirit we know we're living over the
[34:35] last day
[34:36] so we have lasted by prophecy last day
[34:39] by word and lasted by spirit
[34:45] here we go we cannot have
[34:48] hidden service here
[34:50] until the people
[34:52] gets in the spirit of a healing service
[34:57] we cannot have a feeling of the Holy
[34:59] Ghost
[35:02] until
[35:03] people get in that kind of atmosphere
[35:07] and the people was in the atmosphere in
[35:10] the day to bring judgment upon the Earth
[35:12] Oh Glory to God hallelujah oh glory to
[35:16] God could we take some more
[35:18] so therefore the feeling so if the
[35:20] preacher is not preaching about the Holy
[35:21] Ghost and the fellow goes how on Earth
[35:23] could the people get the Holy Ghost the
[35:25] bunch of dead intellectuals sitting down
[35:27] thousands and thousands in this message
[35:28] no wonder the bride had not Revival yet
[35:31] no one that will take the seven Thunders
[35:33] to wake up the pride because the seven
[35:35] donors have to have the Holy Ghost bring
[35:36] the Holy Ghost right back into the
[35:37] church we'll give the Lord Our Praise
[35:39] Give the Lord a shout the devil's a liar

[35:57] another church thing you know church can
[35:59] I preach this you know it's not the
[36:01] bride have to bring this little because
[36:03] the pride of the money says this you

[36:06] you you know for the world to become
[36:08] invisible to become visible the world
[36:10] had to become flesh inside of you you
[36:12] know fire to come and brand that word
[36:14] inside of you
[36:16] foreign
[36:20] Commandments when they had it the
[36:22] visuals Fire coming and said Thou shalt
[36:24] not kill Thou shalt men steal and fire

[36:49] this or when a church is believing that
[36:52] the same holy ghost that they had it in

[37:29] bilan
[37:31] bilham at seven Alters seven rounds both
[37:35] have altars Moses altars as fundamental
[37:38] as one was the other one was also but
[37:40] who did God vindicate you see the one
[37:43] that was in his word
[37:45] fundamental doesn't mean too much
[37:48] is the revelation of God
[37:50] so the books doesn't mean much if you
[37:52] have no Revelation it are people
[37:53] listening and reading and what are
[37:55] listening they're in the word there's no
[37:57] revelation
[37:58] they are clueless they have passed the
[38:01] clueless and and they have the
[38:02] conversation congression through let's
[38:03] do

[38:33] I was 17 years old and everybody my
[38:35] family was Catholic and nobody could

[39:02] what God Said and then God coming to
[39:04] preach the gospel I'm going to preach it
[39:06] Oh Glory to God I'm gonna preach it till
[39:08] fire hit the camp until the Holy Ghost
[39:10] pour out until the Revival in the church
[39:13] I'm gonna preach it praise God I'll lose
[39:15] my teeth I've used my gums my whole
[39:17] preach it oh God help me if I lose all
[39:19] my black hair and I get bald and then I
[39:21] will still preach it oh God I have to
[39:24] hear God damn man oh Gloria who don't
[39:26] like it that is the business who leave
[39:28] leave who gone gone who God sent God's
[39:31] hand but there is gonna be a bunch of
[39:33] people that are going to catch
[39:34] Revelation or glory to God they have a
[39:37] bunch of people upon whom we're gonna
[39:39] put his Spirit somebody have to be here
[39:43] to receive his Spirit he said I will
[39:46] pour out oh glory to God no man doing
[39:49] nothing I will pour out my spirit okay

[40:31] Hallelujah
[40:37] [Music]
[40:37] [Applause]
[40:39] don't think
[40:40] these men why was they calling put in
[40:44] this condition these Pharisees by Jesus
[40:45] he said in vain you worship me
[40:48] you worship genuine worship through
[40:51] worship from the heart but in vain
[40:54] teaching for Doctrine the tradition of
[40:56] men therefore you make the Commandments
[40:59] of God on no effect
[41:01] that's what I'm saying God tell him when
[41:03] he says in the message meeting I said I
[41:04] ain't coming this message I hear a man
[41:06] preach your own thoughts
[41:07] I am wondered for me and I am one of my
[41:10] people I don't care about your
[41:11] Revelation if you care preach what the
[41:13] prophet preached and you he use his
[41:15] message as a flavoring for your
[41:17] Revelation away with you I have nothing
[41:20] to do with that this world has to become
[41:22] effective
[41:25] [Applause]
[41:26] without the flavor of the pepper sauce
[41:28] but nothing this would have everything
[41:30] in it
[41:34] the only reason and some people stuck at
[41:36] reverse intensive and it is before it is
[41:38] the voice yeah
[41:42] the voice said no go to the angel and
[41:46] say what give me what the book do what
[41:49] with it watch it eat it and then what it
[41:52] shall be sweet in your mouth bit on your
[41:54] belly because Thomas prophesy every
[41:57] service and brother Anthony was inspired
[41:59] this morning he said that is what we
[42:01] have been doing my God I love it I love
[42:03] it I love it we have been prophesying
[42:05] every service is prophecy over ahead the
[42:08] devil is finished over your life you
[42:10] have a prophecy hanging over your head
[42:12] Wednesday night Sunday every time you
[42:15] come it's prophecy
[42:17] everybody
[42:22] it's you to believe it and anointed is
[42:24] you to believe it and claim it if you
[42:26] don't believe it and walk in it but
[42:27] prophecy hanging over your head
[42:30] may be seated praise God
[42:33] what do you mean problems are going to
[42:34] help like see me

[42:38] there's a prophecy hanging over here
[42:39] they gave my old richer to rock on to
[42:42] stay home that they don't come to church
[42:43] it was too far
[42:45] you say you say God revealed to me
[42:48] Temple
[42:53] so every Sunday even if he come late
[42:56] he's still coming
[42:57] if he comes slow he's still coming he's
[42:58] still coming because you know Messiah to
[43:00] come inside there one day God will feel
[43:03] like the Simeon all Simeon see man
[43:06] wasn't coming speeding speeding no he
[43:08] crawling into church but he comes still
[43:10] because he under expectation God
[43:13] promised the power of His Spirit and the
[43:15] last day I'll poured my spirit he no
[43:18] other Spirit gonna come you know one day
[43:20] we'll be talking standing and love will
[43:22] come in the building and all the evil
[43:24] will be taken out that's a prophecy
[43:26] hanging over the church I don't care
[43:28] what's inside your heart love with the
[43:30] drop down one of these days and take all
[43:33] the evil out love shall cover and mold
[43:35] you the sins oh give the Lord a praise I
[43:39] don't know what any heart what kind of
[43:41] devils might be the anger hatred malice
[43:43] lust meanness stinginess all kind of
[43:46] crazy stuff inside of you I don't care
[43:47] to know what's inside of you I want to
[43:49] know what's getting out okay the Lord I
[43:51] shout out to go out and go out and go
[43:53] out and go has to go out jealousy Envy
[43:57] hatred praise God praise God
[44:00] Hallelujah
[44:06] I thought I was a nice
[44:09] loving
[44:11] caring good believer
[44:13] so I never know I love enemies
[44:17] but I have
[44:18] I didn't make them
[44:20] they become that
[44:22] Hallelujah so I'm not so nice as I
[44:25] thought
[44:26] but praise God if you follow Jesus the
[44:29] devil could be mad but that's a must
[44:31] have somebody who don't like you I'll
[44:33] hate you they they hate Jews without a
[44:35] cause you know the only cause was no
[44:37] cause
[44:39] it doesn't put them something is one
[44:41] thing but I do that and die why you hate
[44:42] me but I can't do anything and you have
[44:44] a spirit of dislike
[44:48] there's that evil spirit
[44:51] history Without a Cause I don't know why
[44:52] I don't like him but I don't like him
[44:55] but he's brought you
[44:58] God love him
[45:01] cheerfulness means love of God
[45:03] friend of God
[45:05] so so be careful with God's friend
[45:08] praise the name of the Lord all right so
[45:11] watch this
[45:12] hear this bum if I taught you a metal
[45:14] this message it would take no effect on
[45:16] you
[45:16] this is bright time if Moses taught a
[45:19] message of Noah it would take no effect
[45:21] if Jesus taught Moses message it would
[45:23] take no effect
[45:25] because yeah why the predestinated seed
[45:28] laying dear that will only be watered by
[45:30] the type of water that is good for that
[45:33] seed
[45:34] so the seed inside of you when he was in
[45:35] Baptist when he was playing pan when he
[45:37] was feeling wrong there was a season
[45:38] side of you and he only watered the
[45:40] water that wasn't Baptist Methodist your
[45:42] witness Hindu Muslim Buddha it wasn't
[45:44] that it was this word
[45:46] that way when they would hit you
[45:48] something
[45:49] you have to respond because this and
[45:51] your seed connect
[45:53] Oh Glory to God the first message I
[45:57] heard I think was why Christ speak that
[45:58] when I listened the whole message but
[46:00] that's me do you believe this question I
[46:01] say yes I do
[46:03] the first message I fly spirit
[46:08] I just flap I mean listen
[46:10] their mother chickens couldn't couldn't
[46:11] hold me back as soon as I hear the voice
[46:15] and I heard that word I fly straight to
[46:16] the Catholic Church
[46:20] couldn't help it
[46:22] tell my mother I said I want to go with
[46:24] them she said can't
[46:26] I Cry
[46:28] literally cry
[46:30] and then that was insult then they got
[46:32] opportunity to go Johnny to do
[46:34] electrical engineering technician
[46:36] and I zoom up to go Jandy and that was
[46:38] World wanted me separate from down there
[46:40] I call him and tell him I get my
[46:42] pleasure in Jesus name
[46:44] I was completely separated from mother
[46:47] from family
[46:49] praise God praise God you talking about
[46:51] the call of God when God put a call upon
[46:54] your life like something else
[46:55] touched by God
[46:57] [Applause]
[46:59] so when you see her get that connection
[47:02] man shrinks in front of you
[47:05] because man don't have a heaven or hell
[47:07] they have grumpy voice
[47:11] yeah attracting and try to bring fair
[47:14] but you don't have a Heavenly over hell
[47:15] because God put a call upon you and the
[47:18] one that started the working you started
[47:20] started started a couple of servers are
[47:24] back we broke but Anchor Point it's when
[47:25] you're slipping and sliding you have to
[47:27] be an anchor make it put back your hand
[47:29] your foot and say you know what God did
[47:31] for me here sometimes your mind fuzzy
[47:33] fuzzy fuzzy but when you go all back
[47:35] fall back you have a fallback position
[47:37] that's the Anchor Point I remember
[47:40] that night when God spoke to me I
[47:43] remember when God revealed me I remember
[47:45] and when you look back and died did
[47:47] everything that moved back now because
[47:48] they were trying to move forward and if
[47:50] God did that yeah he could do this here
[47:52] if God could that yeah he could do this
[47:54] here if God moved my finger he could
[47:56] move my hand he called me with my hand
[47:57] he could move my foot Oh Glory the God
[48:00] if God opened this door he could open
[48:01] another door because he is still away
[48:03] maker who give the Lord I shout if God
[48:06] help her to pay one bill he can never
[48:08] pay more bills and bigger bills or give
[48:10] the Lord some Praises Glory the court
[48:14] so watch the predestinated seed I lay in
[48:17] there that will only be watered by the
[48:19] type of water that's given for that seed
[48:20] it won't grow any other conditions it
[48:26] must be the condition that it grows in
[48:29] then you talk about the chicken an egg
[48:31] hatch under anything the atmosphere and
[48:33] something like that then it comes to
[48:35] Pentecost
[48:36] 1906. no the Pentecostal that brother
[48:40] I believe one of his eyes was out
[48:44] a colored brother
[48:46] who really started the Pentecostal
[48:48] message in California all Azusa Street
[48:51] he was laughed at
[48:53] because he was a negro and in them days
[48:55] had racism big time
[48:59] so the races are wrong
[49:02] you're black
[49:03] one eye
[49:10] somebody say pressure
[49:11] that is true
[49:13] that was plenty pressure
[49:15] he was made fun of but he bought a
[49:16] message that age just a little buddy a
[49:19] fellow could hardly sign his own name
[49:20] but the Lord here we go have revealed to
[49:24] him that this was the age of the
[49:27] restoration of those gifts
[49:31] so it couldn't come on the Luther
[49:33] inspiration or Wesley inspiration this
[49:35] is the spirit is about a break this is
[49:37] the open door about a break and
[49:39] therefore somebody get a revelation hey
[49:41] gifts coming back you know speaking in
[49:43] tongues interpretation of tongues wisdom
[49:44] healing it coming back
[49:46] pressure and I believe it coming back
[49:48] God give me a Revolution coming back
[49:49] what did he do just talking coming back
[49:52] listen what he did but the Lord revealed
[49:55] to him that this was the age for the
[49:58] restoration of those gifts and they come
[50:00] no matter what said it come but are you
[50:04] ready
[50:04] everybody
[50:06] got in the atmosphere of it and seen it
[50:10] was the age and seeing God Vindicated
[50:13] that those people could speak in tongues
[50:15] and so forth then it happened
[50:17] what they do they got in the atmosphere
[50:20] of it and if there's a Dynamics promise
[50:22] it is a latter rain promise if it is I
[50:25] will put my spirit promise we have to
[50:28] get in the atmosphere
[50:30] that's why brother Anthony wasn't Amber
[50:32] Anthony it was the Holy Ghost say
[50:34] worship give God praise oh it wasn't him
[50:37] it was God he said worship precedes the
[50:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's correct
[50:42] and students sanctification and worship
[50:45] oh give the Lord Our Praise glory to God
[50:49] you live Sanctified and you come here
[50:51] and open your mouth not to feel it's a
[50:53] sacrifice when you say hallelujah praise
[50:55] God you're doing something that you will
[50:56] not normally do
[50:57] [Applause]
[51:04] let me see if God just hit something
[51:07] here
[51:08] with a brown
[51:10] the terribility of the Lord shall come
[51:12] remember Malachi for the message come to
[51:14] the terrible day of the Lord shall come
[51:15] burn up the whole earth and the
[51:16] righteous shall walk up to me as of the
[51:18] wicked that never happened after John no
[51:20] we got two thousand years since then the
[51:22] world hasn't burned since not at all
[51:24] neither is the righteous walking on the
[51:25] ashes of the wicked but we are still
[51:27] waiting
[51:29] are you ready
[51:30] for that something
[51:33] that's going to take the faith and
[51:35] restore the faith of the children back
[51:37] to the original Pentecostal tree that
[51:40] they can't go and eat up
[51:42] all their denomination create please eat
[51:44] up go outside I'll restore it again and
[51:47] it will be restored
[51:48] it
[51:50] will be restored how how God
[51:54] shall send
[51:56] the Holy Ghost in such a way upon
[52:00] planted word
[52:01] that it will restore

[58:05] [Music]
[58:10] all right
[58:13] [Applause]
[58:15] Peter said under the appendix he said
[58:17] this is that which was spoken by the
[58:20] prophet Joel
[58:21] shall come the Pastor said God I put my
[58:23] spirit Upon Our flesh and when he
[58:25] preached under the anointing of the Holy
[58:26] Ghost and the people were shouting and
[58:29] making demonstration they were pricked
[58:31] in their hearts that the Jews understand
[58:32] the Bible said men and breaded what
[58:34] shall we do to be saved
[58:35] and Peter said repent every one of you
[58:37] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[58:39] for the remission of your sins you shall
[58:42] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[58:43] the promises unto you unto your children
[58:45] to them that are far off even as many as
[58:47] the Lord of God shall call
[58:50] Ing and then he said what did he mean
[58:54] in case it have some Pastor whoever
[58:56] explanation different
[58:58] from that
[58:59] you have the answer for this year he
[59:01] said what did he mean
[59:03] then he answers the baptism of the Holy
[59:06] Ghost
[59:07] that was poured out
[59:10] under their Pentacles
[59:12] that was what
[59:16] does he want me to talk about it
[59:18] no other one
[59:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was
[59:24] poured out under Pentecost was to be to
[59:27] you
[59:28] and to your children to them that are
[59:31] far off even as many as the Lord Our God
[59:34] shall call
[59:36] if that change knowledge interchange no
[59:39] time it is the same
[59:42] all glory to God let's continue
[59:45] the best witness that we have that we
[59:48] got the Holy Ghost is when our spirit
[59:51] Bears record with the word
[59:53] if we call ourselves Christians and say
[59:55] we are filled with the spirit and we see
[59:58] that the baptism of the holy spirit is
[1:00:01] poured out on the Believers for all ages
[1:00:06] for what
[1:00:07] for what
[1:00:09] for all ages and our spirit tell us
[1:00:12] that's for another age
[1:00:15] he said you're wrong
[1:00:18] so those baptism messages wrong
[1:00:21] when you believe it you receive it
[1:00:24] they're wrong
[1:00:28] it has to be poured out
[1:00:35] no intellectual knowledge
[1:00:37] will pull you away from it
[1:00:39] but the holy spirit will say Amen to his
[1:00:41] own weight
[1:00:42] he certainly will and he is seeking and
[1:00:46] hunting and trying to find someone that
[1:00:48] he can put himself into
[1:00:50] as long as you find it
[1:00:52] oh my Hallelujah
[1:00:54] oh my almost done all right yeah doing a
[1:00:57] good time all right so then all right
[1:01:00] shark was just getting in me okay now
[1:01:03] there are lots of times when many of us
[1:01:06] Pentecostals has made a mistake and
[1:01:08] think well
[1:01:10] the Holy Ghost is put upon me glory to
[1:01:12] God has only have to have no sin
[1:01:15] you are just then getting started
[1:01:20] it's your test and your trial
[1:01:24] watch this character is not a gift
[1:01:27] correct is a victory that's why after
[1:01:29] this day Pentecostal said backslidden
[1:01:31] yeah with gifts
[1:01:33] and all kinds of things like that they
[1:01:35] still saw and begging for money
[1:01:37] they can't change right now nothing die
[1:01:39] Holier
[1:01:40] watch this but if they had received the
[1:01:42] word like how we saw I received the word
[1:01:44] the word will bring you to your place of
[1:01:46] trying
[1:01:47] that should be tested and the testing on
[1:01:50] the trance is what brings on character
[1:01:52] formation
[1:01:55] blessings
[1:01:57] don't change people
[1:02:01] if the wicked and they get blessed are
[1:02:03] still Wicked
[1:02:04] if the stingy and me and they get
[1:02:06] blessed they still singing me with all
[1:02:07] the blessing God they kept running over
[1:02:08] the systems if they're selfish they're
[1:02:10] still so
[1:02:13] trials change people
[1:02:16] heart attack change people
[1:02:18] fire change people
[1:02:20] disappointments tells people obsess and
[1:02:23] problems change people
[1:02:25] not blessings
[1:02:28] amen
[1:02:30] it's really true
[1:02:32] you can say bless I'm blessed to be
[1:02:34] stressed you're getting stressed to get
[1:02:35] blessed
[1:02:39] [Music]
[1:02:41] now if your spirit pulling back on this
[1:02:43] word here you know what then you need
[1:02:45] God here
[1:02:46] oh yes everybody want the easy way oh
[1:02:49] yes easy way but Jesus lent obedience
[1:02:53] by the thing that he suffered Jesus
[1:02:55] suffer you know you don't want to suffer
[1:02:57] but he suffered
[1:02:59] he suffered be suffered he paid a price
[1:03:02] and he suffered us expect the warfree
[1:03:08] almost done
[1:03:10] missions to get ready to come
[1:03:13] you cannot make a holy church
[1:03:19] and people like to know the church
[1:03:22] we better than them
[1:03:26] in every church have three kinds
[1:03:29] of one kind
[1:03:34] they know what kind is
[1:03:36] they have a higher temperature oh
[1:03:40] this is bright non-brite bright bright
[1:03:42] bright
[1:03:44] God didn't put the power of that in men
[1:03:48] that way it take God to choose
[1:03:51] if Peter if Peter was given the choice
[1:03:53] to choose disciples for Jesus you know
[1:03:55] who he called all your friends and
[1:03:57] family you know
[1:04:00] he wasn't called Mercury tax collector
[1:04:02] who beat him for attacks
[1:04:05] Peter was going to call his friends and
[1:04:08] family
[1:04:09] but then Jesus passing wrong said
[1:04:10] Matthew come
[1:04:12] and Peter look at that he said good Lord
[1:04:15] is he
[1:04:16] the taxman
[1:04:18] yeah the taxman
[1:04:20] Jesus called who he wanted
[1:04:22] or when he just said turn around greet
[1:04:24] somebody he's either turn wrong behind
[1:04:26] him they'll think twice but Jesus
[1:04:29] Hallelujah Glory
[1:04:32] he doesn't want to look Matthew I
[1:04:33] Hallelujah Glory but you can't think so
[1:04:37] shaking hands
[1:04:43] and Jesus showing that I am doing the
[1:04:46] calling you are to do the loving and
[1:04:48] forgiven
[1:04:49] [Applause]
[1:04:52] I think that word saying again
[1:04:55] they call him but you have to do the
[1:04:58] loving and forgiven so by this shall all
[1:05:00] men know that you're my disciples
[1:05:02] when
[1:05:04] when
[1:05:06] when
[1:05:07] when you have loved one for another I
[1:05:10] can't make you love your brother but I'm
[1:05:11] telling you how you're going to be my
[1:05:12] disciple
[1:05:13] Oh Glory to God the disciple must be
[1:05:15] with your love you're watching what kind
[1:05:17] of love is that that's what I love
[1:05:21] let me finish you don't want to get to
[1:05:24] you cannot make a holy church
[1:05:27] beat him with legalism
[1:05:29] you can't make it
[1:05:32] here's why
[1:05:33] there is no such a thing as a holy
[1:05:35] church
[1:05:36] the Holy Spirit can be preached in it
[1:05:39] but in there you find God
[1:05:41] I'm bad
[1:05:43] and renegades in different and
[1:05:47] everything else so an organization
[1:05:50] cannot hold the Holy Ghost
[1:05:52] are you ready
[1:05:53] the holy spirit is poured out on
[1:05:57] individuals
[1:06:00] if that don't make you listen I will
[1:06:03] come hang on shot for you you know you
[1:06:05] know what that means nobody could stop
[1:06:07] you from getting
[1:06:09] the Holy Ghost
[1:06:12] come on to me now
[1:06:19] I know certain things in order
[1:06:21] what
[1:06:23] God wants us to rule them everyone
[1:06:25] together and have our old-fashioned Holy
[1:06:27] Ghost pouring out on the whole church
[1:06:28] everywhere
[1:06:30] a gathering a meeting I get them
[1:06:32] together I have an old-fashioned Holy
[1:06:34] Ghost point out he said what we need
[1:06:36] today brother is to bring every believer
[1:06:38] together
[1:06:40] the gospel don't hold back anything back
[1:06:43] but preach the full gospel of Christ
[1:06:45] until until the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:49] Ghost is poured out upon all the church
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:06:54] bring your Mysteries but when you bring
[1:06:57] it bring the Holy Ghost with it too
[1:06:59] oh Gloria but I've taken a message with
[1:07:01] the Holy Ghost I'm taking the word with
[1:07:02] the Holy Ghost I'm taking all your
[1:07:04] preaching and teaching if you want to
[1:07:06] press play Break pressure play and bring
[1:07:07] your Holy Ghost too but if you press and
[1:07:09] play don't stop me from bringing the
[1:07:10] Holy Ghost when I'm preaching the gospel
[1:07:12] because Jesus commissioned his disciples
[1:07:14] go into all the world I'm not press play
[1:07:17] preach the gospel
[1:07:19] the every creature oh give the Lord a
[1:07:22] shout in the house
[1:07:24] preach the full gospel of Christ until
[1:07:26] the baptism of Holy Ghost is pour out
[1:07:29] upon all the church and that's the only
[1:07:31] way to have a Revival I'm almost done
[1:07:33] here now
[1:07:34] you see Jesus
[1:07:37] had proven to God that he had been the
[1:07:40] right kind of a son
[1:07:41] and God took him up into the mountain
[1:07:44] and brought Witnesses out there Heavenly
[1:07:45] Witnesses that's dead and what a
[1:07:48] supernatural something taking place his
[1:07:50] garments glisten like the sun in the
[1:07:51] middle of the day and as white as they
[1:07:54] could be God placed on him the Rope of
[1:07:55] immortality showed that he had received
[1:07:57] him are you ready now
[1:08:00] that's the thing
[1:08:02] that God will do to his son see on Earth
[1:08:04] someday
[1:08:05] he will call you a side church if you'll
[1:08:08] only obey him and stay on the word
[1:08:11] and believe it and he he will place into
[1:08:15] the church
[1:08:16] when before the coming of Jesus Christ
[1:08:21] he will place into the church
[1:08:24] then he breaks in here all the powers
[1:08:27] that Christ had in him will be in the
[1:08:29] church all that God was
[1:08:32] he poured into Jesus all that Jesus was
[1:08:35] he pours into the church God wanting his
[1:08:39] work done he sent it into his son his
[1:08:42] son wanted the work done he sent it into
[1:08:44] the church at that day you will know I'm
[1:08:47] in the Father the father in me I in you
[1:08:49] you and me at that day because the same
[1:08:53] power
[1:08:55] same power of God that was in Jehovah
[1:08:58] God
[1:08:58] rested in Jesus Christ and the same
[1:09:03] power
[1:09:04] that rested in Jesus Christ rest in the
[1:09:08] placed sons in the body of Christ
[1:09:12] Oh Glory to God praise another son take
[1:09:16] him out a certain place have a ceremony
[1:09:18] before Angels place them positionally
[1:09:20] what he is in the body of Christ then
[1:09:23] that person has the authority
[1:09:26] then you begin to prophesy let me say
[1:09:29] this if you called me to be a fanatic
[1:09:31] from this night on that very same thing
[1:09:33] that I'm speaking of will be done there
[1:09:36] will be a power
[1:09:37] put into the church and now it's coming
[1:09:40] in
[1:09:43] now
[1:09:44] now
[1:09:47] I have to believe it
[1:09:49] I have to claim it I have to walk in it
[1:09:53] there will be a power put into the
[1:09:55] church and now it's coming in that the
[1:09:57] holy spirit will soar anoint the people
[1:10:01] [Applause]
[1:10:03] you just said to pass there you know
[1:10:05] anoint the people they will speak the
[1:10:08] word and it'll create they said right
[1:10:11] there we haven't seen power like coming
[1:10:13] to church now spirit
[1:10:19] [Music]
[1:10:23] Oh Glory to God say unto this mountain
[1:10:25] be moved don't doubt any heart but
[1:10:27] believe what you said that shall come to
[1:10:28] pass you can have what you said the
[1:10:30] placing of the church in position
[1:10:33] what position where the fullness of the
[1:10:38] power of the Holy Ghost comes into the
[1:10:40] church
[1:10:41] damn critics mode will be shot it will
[1:10:44] be a short time Jesus Christ come right
[1:10:46] off the mountain when shita Calvary
[1:10:47] notice it won't last long but it will be
[1:10:50] here
[1:10:51] forget the critics don't even criticize
[1:10:53] them and I take we here to the final
[1:10:55] quote begin to play something final
[1:10:58] quote on Jesus but Obama's praying
[1:11:00] father so it is now at the near coming
[1:11:02] of Jesus again just like the vine if the
[1:11:05] vine puts forth uh the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:07] signs and wonders of fruits follow that
[1:11:09] branch and if that vine ever put another
[1:11:11] Branch it would be the same kind of
[1:11:13] Branch we know that father by Nature
[1:11:15] itself but we do know that you can graft
[1:11:18] any fruit that's pertained into that
[1:11:20] into the vine it will live by Divine and
[1:11:23] we know we can take orange tree and grow
[1:11:25] citrus fruits of different kinds segment
[1:11:27] we can put lemons in it it'll grow right
[1:11:29] on it's such as fruit it's grow
[1:11:31] grapefruit any other tangerine and so
[1:11:33] but if that tree brings forth a branch
[1:11:36] its own Branch again it will be orange
[1:11:38] Lord it'll be like the first one was
[1:11:40] here we go prophecy and we believe
[1:11:43] that there is to be a church in these
[1:11:46] last days that will receive both
[1:11:48] former and laterine it will be scattered
[1:11:52] throughout the world in this loud recent
[1:11:54] age it will be a church that's called
[1:11:56] back to the original faith in God it
[1:11:58] will be a church that I have Jesus
[1:11:59] Christ walking in it manifesting himself
[1:12:02] the shout of the king will be in it
[1:12:05] let's all stand and give us some Praises
