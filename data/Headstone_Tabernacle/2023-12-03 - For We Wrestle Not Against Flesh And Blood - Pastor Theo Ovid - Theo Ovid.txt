shaken father God we are needy of you Lord oh God we pray that a special visitation Among Us to this morning and de with every heart Lord and may we leave your changed people people drawn closer to you father surrounded by your love surrounded by your presence surrounded by your grace granted father as we approach your word be with us Lord in Jesus we ask it amen God bless you and it's so good to see all of you all this morning we welcome you uh if you have your Bibles i' like you to turn to two portion of scriptures 1 Timothy 41 and verse 6 and Ephesians 6 1 vers verse2 want to go to the scriptures 1 Timothy 4 verse1 and then go to verse 6 it says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith amen giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils verse six if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good Doctrine where unto thou has attained and also from Ephesians 6:12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places four things have been identified here we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against one principalities two Powers three rulers of Darkness of this world and four spiritual wickedness in high place let us pray one more time father we thank you for your word and Lord It's shaking and enlightening to see in the word and it's almost like if the Bible become a new book oh God shine light on your word for us this morning morning in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh praise the Lord trust the Lord that dealing with your heart I trust that you're pressing the battle and I trust the Lord that you're wrestling um that's what we shared in prayer meeting we wrestle you had to fight wrestle rolling on the ground amen you're groaning you're travailing you're wrestling amen and I said something in the prayer meeting that I never said before about the woman with the uh daughter Vex with the Devil and um she said it's not Jesus told her it's not fit to take the children's bread and give it to dogs and she stood there instead of fussing and carrying on she stood there and said even the dogs take the crumbs and Jesus made an amazing statement and says for this sining your daughter is made whole that means you could say the right thing and have a a effect in in your family you understand so in other words your words could affect your family and I happened to just spill out that the opposite is also true you could say the wrong thing and bind your family and I got this scripture from Proverbs chapter 6 verse two thou are sneered with the words of thy mouth Thou Art taken with the words of thy mouth so your own words could bind things and loose things you could get sted by own so it pays to say the right thing it pays to be nice it pays to treat people nice you don't know even might be talking to an angel Oh Glory to God have no blessing in being disrespectful being argumentative being Troublesome have no real blessing in that amen all right so let's get to service this morning um the title I have is for we wrestle not against flesh and blood we for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but the Brandon I was talking to some brethren over in PTO Rico a few weeks ago that I seen Great Sea a great the great sea and a great storm the way was hi on this Tabernacle and I said you know what it hasn't got one more drop of water than it when it's perfectly calm well what does this churning and jumping what does it mean it throws all the trash out upon the bank and that's what the church needs is a Revival to shake from it all the worldliness and the things of the world and bring back Purity and Holiness of God in the hearts of its Believers humility man as soon as they don't get a Revival once in a while in their Spirit they become so caral so indifferent till they get self- styled staty and self-righteous that is the lacking of a Revival now and again in your own Spirit sometimes sometime you don't have to be canel thing to you off you know the disciples got thrown off by the temple and they say look at the temple look at B Stones just said don't bother with that and a time will come not one stone will be upon another Stone you know and but said natural thing could throw you off you know yes natural things like how Christmas come here right now paint and and and and vill and what kind of could throw you off you know because there a season the atmosphere that could throw your Plum off and you do recognize it throwing you off leave that for the people in the world to fight up with that worldly Spirit out there that Christmas spirit Christmas spirit is not the Holy Ghost it's a spirit you know but it's not God oh give the Lord some Praises so if you don't get a Revival once in a while in your spirit you you Jesus didn't say if you fast when you fast no we have one day fasting once a month first day F month that not the only to fast you know you can fast every week you know it's when you fast you know that's just something for the church you know but you could fast when you want to fast fasting do get spiritual for you fasting is Amplified prayer fasting is get God to respond on a on on a on a faster frequency oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah praise God could somebody give praises to God tonight Hallelujah Pray when you fast when you give arms when you pray is a when not if when you pray praise God hallelujah when you stand praying forgive if you have order against any praise God forgiveness is not a feeling forgiveness is an action it's a decision to forgive oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah hallelujah he always talk about forgiveness right I always talking about it I a stop on to come here we he about forgiveness because faith is based upon forgiveness and I want a Revival in the church and to have a Revival you have people to Faith to pull on the Capstone praise God you can't come sit here with all kind of a and Grudge and as you sit there them demons behind you with that praise God because demons hold you down with that oh give the Lord pray God said if you do not forgive I will not forgive you oh give the Lord some praises and if God a forgive you there a demon standing behind you with an Unforgiven Spirit okay the Lord I shou in the heart I'm trying to get out of here but a punch Oh Glory to God but faith is based on forgiveness God forgive you he went and paid the price and forgive you of your sin how you locking somebody neck how you holding somebody to what they did to you glory to God God forgive you of your ,000 and you trying to lock somebody neck for $10 shame on you oh give the Lord a praise praise God you have somebody to shout about every service should be a shouting service every service should be a praising God you're alive you're not in hospital praise God you no tubes to up on you praise God you're not dead you're alive you have than to give God praise you have feet to stand up oh give the Lord a shout to the house glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah I had a whole week and half struggling my own health praise go my life this morning why I supposed to do come and complain I come here to give God some praise it it was bad with could have be worse oh give the Lord some praise in the good time we praise him in the bad time we praise him when we feeling good when we not feeling good when we sick when we happy when we on the mountain when we in the valley we still God God praise praise God need a Revival in your spirit how many want Revival in your spirit see fast my hand go up you see fast my hand go up my hand went up before you oh give the Lord a praise who feel they own that's the business my hand went up before you I want a Revival right now oh glory to God I want a Revival today I don't want to leave out Revival I need a Revival oh give the Lord a shout in the house first man hand went up oh give the Lord I shout it if you don't want it I want it oh give the Lord some Praises they read and study and that's good but that ain't the think we are talking about you know more about the word it's good to know the word it's better to the author of the word oh blessed be the name of the Lord if you have your Bibles you can turn to Genesis chapter 25 we want to read 29 to 34 and Jacob sought pottage he cook pottage nice plint peas you I cook some myself you know until peace but I I cook it for me all right and Jacob said potage and Esau came from the field and he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee with the same red pottage for I am faint therefore was his name called Edom Jacob said Jacob Jacob said s me this day thy Birthright now the first born have the birthright Jacob said sell me this day thy bre esus said behold I'm at the point to die what prophit shall this Birthright do to me in other words is no value are you hungry and Jacob said swear to me this day and he swear unto him and he sold his Birthright onto Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and potage of lentil and he did eat and drink rose up and went his way thus Esau despite his birri hallu but BR so what a satisfaction it gives to us to know when you you are born of the spirit of God you are Sons and Daughters of God Jacob it meant so much to him what means what to you Jacob it meant so much to him but the birthright meant nothing to Esau frankly he despised it and I say this with all reverence his children still does he despise it what do I have to go do that for why should I receive the Holy Ghost I am good as you are the seed is my soul God call me why should I receive the Holy Ghost my religion is just as good as yours why should I go through all that here I'm just as good as you I go to church I got my name on the book you got to be born again amen it didn't mean anything to Esau he despised it and the carnal believer today still despises that Birthright and the birthright is the Holy Spirit what kind of Amen is that somebody paying you to say Amen the birthright is the Holy Spirit you could shout on that because that is what you want the birth right that's is what you're fighting for the birthright Oh Glory the birth right is what the birthright is what and Jes don't want it but Jacob want it oh G his name changed yet but he want it his life had changed yet no but he want it come on come on come and ride with me he change it know but he want it he still have bad ways and everything but he want it Oh Glory he's still a c but he want it Oh Glory to God hallelujah I don't care what condition you're in you must want it because this is the thing that you need glory to God your roof will get back Rusty praise God this will break down that will break down but this thing is eternity we talking about here glory to God and when you die but I'm say your soul find yourself being blocked out like a tooth praise God like God like it getting plucked by a tooth and you're facing an eternity that you're unsure of oh give the Lord some Praises oh Hallelujah everybody a face it one day you know hallelujah praise God Hebrews 12 verse 5 let me going get something here now he and for ye have forgotten the exaltation which speak to you as children my son despise not the chasten of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasten whom the Lord what love it he chasten it so if you get no chastening you wonder if how much God love you but who God love he does Chase we just spoil our children you had to watch that you know that is his poor bad rotten parenting who he love he does chasten rebuke and exalt all right watch watch watch it here now for if you endure chastening endure is the underlying word de god dealth with you as Sons for what son is he whom the father Chase it not but if you without chastisement where of all are partakers then you're bastards and not Sons furthermore we had fathers of our flesh with corrected us and we give them reverence shall we much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for verily for a few days they chasten us unto their own pleasure but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chasing of the present seems joyous and Grievous I have children too you know and I know how I handle them I can't expect everybody to be like me but the point about it when you have to get discipline and what not is not a nice thing but it's the for the good of the child when God corrected is for our good no child want licks they want correction they want rebuke they all want their own way I want that I want that and you must give them that that that and if they keep giving them what they want they get become spoiled and then they feel they entitled and when they get older they will grow up in the world thinking that everything they see they want and they will get a rude awakening and we say if your parents do discipline here life will cut your tail life will put licks on you oh glory to God to endure what you have to go through take correction praise God don't try to Swit sides take what and go through don't try to get out go through what you're going through go say Lord take me I'll take me through oh give the Lord some shouts in the house glory to God hallelujah wherefore lift up your hands which what wherefore lift up the hands verse 12 which hand down and the feeble knees make straight past your feet least that which is lame be turned out of the way but be rather healed okay verse 14 follow peace with all men one and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord so if you want to see the Lord you to come and line up with his Holiness you can't come in like a rascal here like a Old Scamp like a old piece of nastiness and so you can't do that you want to line up with Holiness which mean you want to line up with sanctification you're not pleasing me you're pleasing God praise God you have to know how you taking care of the temple of God do you know you are the temple of God if you're smoking that why you in the temple of God you're defiled in the temple you have to be conscious of the temple of God it was a physical Temple you will keep it right you have a physical Temple your body is the temple of God praise God make us sure no filter come out your mouth that's the temple of God okay the Lord I shout make your heart is clean and clear that's the temple of God that's the house of God God told the prophet don't defile his every woman don't smoke don't drink because a work for you oh give the Lord a shout God want to use you but he can't use a filthy vessel he can't use a defiled Temple you have to be Sanctified you have to be cleansed you have to be a partaker of his Holiness and that could correctly anoint you and put you in service of power Give the Lord a shout glory to God you can come and go as a church member you know but if you want to be used of God you have to get to be a vessel of Honor oh the Lord I shout glory to God you don't drink from the backed poty you drink from a glass in the cupboard that you have washed and you have put aside oh give the Lord a sh out and that's what God going to use I devil on the earth God pick you for this final Warfare he pick you for his army I don't care what felt what woman what adultery what whatever what they have out there praise God every woman out there have a sex Spirit on them except Christians every one of them have a sex spirit it's a spirit on them Bray all them cut up dress and cut up clothes and all them na outside all is a spirit on them it's anointing them it's compelling them to do what they do and dress how they dress and they have no shame Oh Glory to God you have to have a testimony you have to want to stand for the gospel you have to want to stand for Jesus Christ you have to want to come out glory to God and I will bless you in blessing I will bless you he will bless you going in he will bless you coming out he will make a table for you in the presence of your enemies and your cup will run over the Lord I shout verse 15 looking diligently Le any man fail watch watch this looking diligently least any man fail of the grace of God least any root of bitterness springing up trouble you thereby many be defiled so somebody with bitterness have a defiled Temple don't say Amen now are telling you the truth if you have bitterness you have a defiled Temple forgive your mother forgive your brother forgive your father forgive your amen your husband forgive your wife forgive them praise God Jesus on the cross before he hit Resurrection father forgive them they know not what they're doing they B crfi crucified and he say father forgive them they're crazy they don't know what they're doing and they will pay for that and they paid for that and God judged them and run them all over the world for hundreds and thousands of years and he promised will bring them back and out of all of that only 144,000 going to be saved and they rejected their own Messiah to give us an opportunity as Gentiles to get the Messiah coming to us that we can become wife of the Lamb you have an opportunity to be the Bride of Jesus Christ you can't sit there like you are nobody you can't sit there like you don't know your call you can't sit there that his blood wasn't shed to reach you and to bring you out [Music] least there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morle of meat sold his Birthright for he know how that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears not dry you know with tears and he couldn't get it so I I'll just read one verse from the Amplified in verse 11 for the time being no discipline brings Joy but seems Grievous and painful but afterwards it yields a Peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it a harvest of fruit which consists of righteousness in Conformity to God's will in purpose thought and action resulting in right living and standing with God Amen now let's go let me see if I could start this morning all back Dr I start yet not going against that all right well R so an Army first in getting ready for battle there's got to be some solders see like some soldiers you got to be dressed for fighting got to be trained for fighting this is not trained for warm Church bench fighting if everything nice with you that it will be always so you know like we said the man who build his house on sand as long as the stor come yet he he he fancy danc he expanding it he extend it put porch he put PO he put all kind of on your house but you understand because the Storm come yet the storm is coming the man who build house up on a rocket be so fancy for B on a rock but the storm is coming and if the storm hit you yet don't be too proud because you know you're just painting you're painting you're painting paint for Christmas you're painted you painted but you bu on sand change where you have built make sure it is on a rock I believe the greatest battle that was ever fought is now ready to go in action I believe believe that God has been selecting his soldiers I believe he has been dressing them training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start so who think in the battle that is their business I am seeing we are getting ready to start oh I wish I was 30 I could only wish that but I'm not 30 but I've been in this way training a long time and this battle is about to begin and I'm happy to be part of this battle and this battle is not a flesh and blood battle Oh Glory to God we are not wrestling against flesh and blood Oh Glory to God if you could only see what what what the spirit sees all right let's go so watch the first battle ever fought begin in heaven when Michael his Angel fought against Lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin here we go did not originate in heaven it was thrown down from heaven cast onto the Earth and fell and human beings then the battle begin here on Earth and begin in us and have been raging ever since aration 127 to1 says and there was a war in heaven Michael and his Angel fought against the dragon the dragon fought on his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon that was cast out the old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceived the whole world he was cast into depth the Earth and his Angel were cast with him and I heard of L

the beginning his purpose in heart was to achieve a brighter and greater things in heaven than Christ had is that right watch more Splendor than the kingdom of Christ and do you think we have a do you think we'll have Auto automobiles in the Millennium and a PL you see what Lucifer is doing Isaiah 14 reading from verse 12 God speaks how are thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which this weakened the nation for thou has said in thine heart here we go said words in his heart I watch that emphasis will a said to Heaven I second time will exalt my throne above the stars of God I third time will sit upon the Mount of the congregation and say not even know what side he want to sit on I four time I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I

look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth a tremble and did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroy the cities thereof that open not the house for his Prisoners the devil is doing the same thing building up a hybrid Church hybrid Believers hybrid members hybrid by knowledge instead of the word by intellectual men instead of Born Again men building an intellectual Kingdom that will outshine Christ little bitty flock what is that did that question Fallen Angels that's the Bible said it was Fallen Angels who listen to Lucifer instead of Christ now listen close Fallen Angels what kind of angels Luther Wesley Catholic Pentecostals who kept not their first estate like the Angels did that fell into organization like Lucifer manhole and Isa what have they done organized a great ecumenical Association of ministers to make an image unto the Beast what did they do stole out the reasonings of wisdom and education like Eve did Fallen Angels did here we go Wesley was a man of God but what followed him Fallen Angels got into it you mean Fallen Angels got into every message I want to shake it you know but this is something astonishing you know you mean Fallen Angels coming into this message exactly what was the Angels first creative beings of God but fell for Lucifer's wisdom you see what they become Fallen Angels an organization from Men of God who went forth to establish truths in the earth and before that truth could go on and proclamate and get onto the real revelation of Christ Fallen Angels come and took it over and made denominations out of it so every single denomination is a attribute a manifestation of fallen angels and they have nice pastors and evangelists and nice service and inspiration and all kind of like that Fallen Angels when God looked down we see God not seen his holy spirit you know Fallen Angels because denomination points you to an image I am a Pentecostal there an image I'm a Baptist I'm a Methodist that's something to point to not Christ but the word will produce Jesus Christ Hallelujah but bam said this now now you see what they left off if Luther would have went on it would have been there if would have went on if pente went on they would have been done praise that's the reason the revelation of the seven seal mystery had to be unfolded because it exposes What Spirit Fall after the prophet's me after each messenger falling droide because your mind gone and somebody must have somebody smart that the devil could use all right here we go let's give a little picture here a little mental picture here's a stream coming through here Channel Now give me your undivide attention now so you won't miss this in this little channel here dwells mortal beings you and I now in dear let's look at it it's a mass of folly everything else but once in a while you see a light you re see Blackness and streaks that is Gatey and carrying on Devils getting the people they dress fine highly cultured polished colors but still the devil but there has born against it in there now these people in this channels influenc from two different sides on this side there's a trinity and on that side there's a trinity now the first place on this side is The Souls of the unjust when a man die he goes into a place place waiting judgment Jesus went and preached to them Souls that were in prison the next is demons the next is the devil and Hell going up there are ghosts spirits of dead men that never repented they are waiting for judgment the only thing they know is folly and that's what they did up here these Christians here we go are in influenc from above up here is another ghost the Holy Ghost the ghost of a man Christ Jesus the Holy Ghost influences his church in this realm of mortal the Devil by these Spirits influence men the next is Angels the next is God so this way below is SS of the unjust that people that they have half mask for and talk a nice talk behind the funeral and going to hell Souls on the unjust and then de demons and then the devil and Hell On Top here have souls of the blessed and then angels and then God himself we are in between we are Mortals and the influences come from above and below so when you walk these streets you see what going on you're seeing Devils Everywhere by how they're dressed by how they look you know it's Devils praise God praise God all right watch now watch now he's talking about a woman who was accurate and she was predicting things and she was a um um a medium like right intact with demons and so now what that woman done she broke into that realm she is speaking to those demon-possessed men who at the beginning the spirits here we go of those fallen angels that repented not back there in the beginning and allow their beings to be possessed of them their waiting judgment and these over here are influenced by the spirit of God so it's three sides up Tre sides down Hallelujah and the people in the in between being influenced now watch Lucifer has got into the church and taken away the word and injected denomination and He is building a church Jesus I my church been aard you know he's been a f and soal Monarch and thing and not interested that you know them he had it already he interested in church follow me now know all right The ecumenical move that's going on now to unite all the Protestants together and come into Catholic this Pope that got now to do the same thing exactly what the scripture said now watch he is doing it by man of those great ecumenical moves who does not know God and and the many of them in the Pentecostals because they are doing the same what is it he is doing it with Fallen Angels then he then he listed here Fallen lutherans Fallen methodists Fallen Pentecostals lost their original estate from the word of God going right back to make a great economical move Fallen Angels Fallen Messengers who once stayed with the word but so out their birth rights and join in the world con churches and so on in the last day Lucifer's achievement today by man wait listen with those Spirits in them man with those Spirits in them that he did with angels at the beginning Fallen Angels who did not kept their first estate amen so God permitted fallen angels all that dwell on the Earth shall be deceived except those whose names written but you the bride cannot be deceived Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God and you're going to find out I'm going to read it for you that these Spirits have Natures with it and the Holy Ghost have a nature with it oh glory to God so when the Holy Ghost influence you you will come up with a certain nature look at right there faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness brotherly kindness and so forth and out of that will get the Galatians fruit with joy and peace some long suffering and oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God and then Fallen Angels coming with their n and out of that you get second timy praise God heavy and high minded and lovers of pleasure and lovers of God pray do you see what going on here it's the same the two Spirits we talking about here glory to God blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so after the prophet left the Fallen Angels drop inside the message with interpretations and ideas and that's spirit because they have to come to the head first you know that's why every time a man want to take charge of other man I to watch that you had to watch that because the devil because the devil get to the pastors a man in charge of ministers if a man in charge of ministers and become I identify message Pope only preacher talk about message Pope years I talking about that the message Pope want to control ministers because the ministers have influence over the congregation so when the message Pope bring his false seed and drop it on them pastors and then pastors go and drop it on the church the church paralyzed because they're not on the word and God can only bless his word because God know what he said to the prophet God don't care about what man say you know he spoke to a prophet hallelujah hallelujah so I can't come and bring my thoughts and idea my dream last night I have to say what the tape say I don't have a message I preach a message Oh Glory I preaching another man's message oh give the Lord a shout in the house because I aware that the word is a seed the son of man so the good seed and if we preach this word you going to be filled with the Holy Ghost because the word is the holy ghost in word form Oh Glory to God give the Lord a shout glory to God the Holy Ghost Inside of You in word form God put the pyramid in you already it going to break out you're going to bust out I know your flesh act up this way and that other way but the flesh profited nothing the words are spirit and life oh give the Lord some Praises Glory let's go these spirits that you see moving just like God government a church anything is controlled by a spirit organizations are controlled by a spirit church organizations are controlled by a spirit churches are controlled by Spirits individual are controlled by Spirits nations are controlled by spirits and spirit was made before the cosmic matters and life that were made God made man his own image and he put him in five senses Oh Glory to God so before God put us in flesh we were in spirit form image of God in spirit so before all this physical thing they were Spirit oh give the Lord a shout let's go to Ezekiel chapter 28 let's read from verse one hallelujah praise God I want to show you God speaking to a man and speaking to another man two men one is of the earth and one is a different realm all

Devils but by B the prince of devils and Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to Desolation and every city house divided against itself shall not stand and if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand so he's also saying without saying it Satan has a kingdom and the kingdom of a structure and the

Nature and it set on fire of hell every kind of Beast and birds and serpents and things that you see is tamed had been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it's an unruly evil full of

not to be hallelujah praise God thank you watch who is a wise man verse 13 which is uh James 3 who is a wise man and endured with knowledge among you let him show out of good conversation good life and his works with meekness and wisdom but if you be bitter envy and strife in your hearts watch Glory not lie not against the truth this wisdom descended not from above but his Earthly sensual and devilish he this one for where there's envy and strife is there is confusion and every evil work so in a home or house with envy and strife it open up rooms doors windows roof for Devils to come in I hope you get the message now let me read it again for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work because when you have that sort of thing in your home it gives room for the devils devils have to get room you know remember they don't have houses they don't have buddies they even want to go any pigs and all they want a bud anybody they want when they recognize they had to leave Legion they say oh God send me the pigs now and the pigs kill the themselves not even the pigs W them why you want Devils for not even the pig choose to commit suicide the pig chose to give up on life that to be running around with devils and them like M already why you said one devil Give the Lord some Praises oh give the Lord a shout in the house and when the pigs jump off the cliff all them Devils had to float around looking for bodies again oh don't let them come to you Holy Ghost want your body oh God don't let no devil want your body the devil jealous of you oh give the Lord a praise they don't belong here they are Fallen Angels they are Fallen Spirits we wrestle not against flesh and blood but we wrestle against the envy jealousy the man is [Applause] Spirits Mark 16 we know it he said going into all the world preach the gosp with every creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name yeah don't be message in my name they shall cast out devils in my name they shall speak with new tongues they shall Pi up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he receive up into heaven and sat in the right hand of God and they went forth and preached the word everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs Wonder of Wonders and miracles there was a word confirmation there was a confirmation of the Gospel there was a confirmation of the message that have to come right back the Lord working among them the Lord himself not no Spirit the Lord himself some anointing a feel anointing not that the Lord himself Jesus himself I want a bigger amen than that it look like you're getting frightened the Lord himself went everywhere with them to the grocery praise God to the car to the house to the bedroom the backro outside wherever you go the Lord himself went everywhere everywhere is everywhere everywhere is everywhere everywhere is everywhere everywhere is still every [Music] everywhere I think this might be the last our scripture run Matthew 10:1 Matthew 101 just one verse Matthew 10:1 and when he had called his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out I like that phrase not power against un I have power he EMP power of unclean against against unclean Spirit to cast them out and to heal all manner of sicknesses and all manner of disease and they didn't have the Holy Ghost oh give the Lord some Praises if the Lord a shouting this is Matthew 10 this was an allotment of temporary power for the work of the ministry to work along with Jesus but the judge temporary power and when the status he devil scatter so they run one day happy happy happy they said Good Devil he said don't Rejoice for that don't Rejoice because devils are subject to you but Rejoice because your name is written Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah devil Chason was a new thing in the hour that was a new ministry in that hour because they never see nothing like that oh glory to God Hallelujah Jesus tell one of them go tell that fox today tomorrow I cast out Devils go go tell him that more devils cast out oh give the Lord some Praises Praises Praises Praises glory to God the bride ministry will have a Ministry to cast out Devils let it start today let it start now let it start here glory to God devil is upon you leave devil of sickness devil of depression devil of frustration devil of loneliness Devil's unbelief devil is in your body devil is in your mind devil in your soul get out leave glory glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Glory you may be seated so a deal with the challenges that that's yet in are yet ahead in the realm of the spirit the only way we could really combat that devil is to come into our place and position to know who we are because Jesus Faith wasn't based upon the anointing his faith was BN upon who he was and when you know who you are that's different Oh Glory to God when you know all the Devils under your feet they under your feet when you know the whole Heaven is backing you up then the whole Heaven is backing you up oh as my father sent me so send that you oh glory to God and the father that sent him went into him oh give the Lord a shout it wasn't in front of him it wasn't above him it wasn't behind him it wasn't the side of him it was in him oh give the Lord a shout and that same power that was in Jesus going to be in sons in the last days I not talking about pulpits I'm talking about you I all of us it going to be in sons and daughters in the last days he said do that you shall know I'm in the father you in me and I in you St John 14:20 oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God Hallelujah the second fold of the three-fold mystery of God that he can have the perfect Spirits by them seven voices thundering in you against the devil oh give the Lord a shout when the disciples couldn't cast out that epileptic Spirit Here Come Those voices the [Applause] voices my [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Lord glory to God is this too much for you this morning can't be too much for you man this is what we called for praise go we want to lay it inside there that the devil can't move not a devil move hey glory to God hallelujah praise God oh let's go from future home but Brown talk about new heaven New Earth by these passages one might think or be led rather to believe that the whole planet of this Earth will be destroyed and make a new Heaven and new earth that the heavens will be gone and Earth will be gone completely anal but a close study and with the help of the Holy Spirit we can see the truth of this it is only the atmospheres around it and the sin that come upon the Earth will be destroyed we realize that Heavens means the atmosphere above what does it do in this these titles and sickness and death and politics and sinful man sinful woman evil spirits will all be going away and unleaded and un it has to be done that way because we are going to live right here take your property see we right this thing sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet all right now watch all germs all sicknesses will be completely taken away it's existence that's in the earth now man-made systems politics sin all kind of evil spirits that's in the world contaminated with all the heavens above us is contaminated with evil spirits all this exist in the heavens or atmospheres and the Earth which is now this Earth hold those things but it wasn't made for that purpose sin caused that all our bodies physical bodies now that we live in now was put on the earth when God created it there's a big one when God created let there be a earth our bodies was created right there because we come from the dust of the Earth all of B we live in now was put in the earth when God created the Earth because you out of the Dust of the earth it was all laid out there when God himself created it you were in his thinking the great Eternal was the thought which is the attribute now sin caused all this to happen and God through this age is gathering up his material Satan is still here that's the reason all these things happen he's still here all his evil forces are still here notice why the earth now is so filthy amen why the scum and ridiculous things that goes on Bloodshed War politics sin adultery all kind of fness goes on is because Satan is the ruler of this Earth and this atmosphere both heavens and earth is now contaminated with Devils that can accuse us before God and Jesus is there to intercede for us while the accusers keep pointing a finger they did this they did this they did this but the blood still covers he came to redeem that elected he for sure do you receive this have you received [Applause] [Music] this Ephesians 2 verse one says and you had he quickened who was dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time pass you walk according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air which is the atmosphere so Satan is the prince of the power so he is in fourth dimension he's where TV RS and radio ways and all the dimensions that why he uses so much and I can't get on too much take too much time Satan was a master musician his body was a music his body was a music thing and that is why the channel of music is so important and he uses it to get to people Spirits using music to bring adulterous Spirit fornicate Spirit lion Spirit do Spirit Spirits War animosity thiefing Spirit um was some man sing some song one getting rich at any cost I can't remember um man name 50 cents get rich at any cost or some re and he nickname is 50 50 cents any price any price rub teeth whatever it is just get rich and then dead rich die like a dog yeah taking the money with you see all right so the Bible call this the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience so when you're rebellious inside of here the disobedient inside of here the prince of the power here he have you you're floating in his atmosphere and they C chur God bless you God prince prince have you all right let's go when God created me William Bram I was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know now watch Jesus told his disciples he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said here he chose us him before the world began so there was some part of me om man Neville and the rest of you all here that's in Jesus Christ before the will ever began and I think and here's my analysis of that I think that the people today that are possessed with this Spirit or the spirit or part was a part of these Angelic beings hallelu Spirits which rotated off of God hallu that never fell in the beginning and resisted the Devils lie in [Music] heaven how many C that now he said we are part of we believe that we are part of the spirit the Angelic beings the spirits which rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted Devil's lie no wonder he said the two spirits will be so close it will deceive the very elect if it was possible but it can't be because we we we deny him that in heaven those angels represent us we were nowhere then but the Angels represent the angels that fought against Lucifer they represented our stand on Earth so we going to resist him down here that what the Bible say resist the devil he shall flee we have authority to resist not to give in not to be washed up but to resist because you are a soldier oh give the Lord I shout in the house glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God hallelujah praise God all right let's go 2/3 of the earth is in sin what what third of the Angels was kicked out here we go and those demon spirits come into people and habitate their body there was once EX existed and they come into people and give them a nature Jesus cast seven of them out of Mary Magdalene then you start to identify some of them you could compare what you have here Pride boast unclean filthy vulgarity emulation Strife they are spirits about 10 people say Spirits about 10 people say amen if that's Spirit you don't want to say amen I can understand that but you could say Amen even Legion and all say amen and he had a thousand Devils I don't think you have much I don't think you have as much as Legion so say Amen because you have to be delivered because you will be delivered this will come to deliver you I'm reading the word I'm not trying to make up things oh give the Lord some praises anger temper you f your mouth and you're vexing your face like a frog and what a frog Spirit are you saying that you s like a lemon a lemon Spirit don't Vex with me you know prestle with this word here don't look to beat me up after service because I'll beat you back you know oh give the Lord some Praises you will get licks just as just as they bring l so giving you back oh give the Lord I shouting you think I taking L from you you got to be kidding beat that devil running I no devil beat me praise God hallelujah give give the Lord some Praises all right Hallelujah let's say it again those demon spirits come into people habitate their body and give them a nature praise God and what about the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost come into your body give you a nature oh give the Lord a shout oh my God we getting SED now you're getting frighten when I talk about demons and Devils but what about the Holy Ghost what about the opposite the opposite is also true the Holy Ghost come to give you a nature hallelujah praise God watch them were spirits that was made up back there when God made man off of his own image he created those supernatural beings Hallelujah all right first Peter 3 said but how bir have all these scriptures today don't even ask me how 1 Peter 3: 18 and 19 for Christ also had one suffered for sins to just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison so when Christ died he didn't just die and we just chilling out on his second day no he was at work he went down to the regions of the Lost he took the keys from Satan and he had to go to preach to those people all them Spirits from Noah's day and everything else and preach to them and witness to them that he's the one that was prophesy about and they couldn't be saved souls in prison question and answers but AB BR the question answers now the souls that were in prison that repented not were not Angelic beings that have been brought down in the form of angels but it was the spirits of those Angelic beings that fell before the foundation of the world back dear when the war went on in heaven so the spirits of those Angelic beings is what fell on them people to fight Noah so when Jesus said as one day a Noah so shall it be the Comm son of man what Jesus is also saying the same spirits that was in Noah's day will come back in this day okay give the Lord a shouting the house do you catch it now watch Satan and the dragon fought Michael and a dragon fought on Lucifer and Lucifer was cast out with all his children all the angels that he had deceived and those angels come down to earth and were subject then to become human and when they did when they saw the sons of daughters of men were fear and talking to them wives they are sons of God here we go listen to this part every man that was born in the Earth is a Son of God regardless of whether he a sinner or whether he is he's a Son of God created in the image of God for the praise of God he's created that way and God in the beginning knew who would receive him who would not receive him therefore he could predestinate or not predestinate but by for knowledge he could tell who would be Sav and who wouldn't be saved he knew which person will take up which Spirit he knew who will pick up Church Spirit who will pick up Baptist spirit and who will take up the spirit of the word he knew you would receive this message so when this message come you had to come out your Catholic church Baptist to come out beating pant smoking cigarette dancing fooling around you had to come out whether your wife didn't want it your husband didn't want it you had to come out he knew you would pick this up you couldn't miss it if you Tred Give the Lord a that alone you make a shout watch and those spirits that come from the Throne of God and stands Before the Throne of God and live billions and billions and ions of time before the world ever begin in the presence of God you think they don't know something about worship they get right into men and they worship God he's talking about the men now he talking about the spirit absolutely they worship God they have a knowledge of God and they are smart shrewd educated always but God rejected them from the beginning so we talking about these Angelic spirits that coming upon human beings and influencing them a certain way and these Spirits could influence men talk to them that why they meet an angel but the angel is not a Bible Angel so we can't fight the Experience One Man deceased brother precious zigma told me this brother he said he don't know how it felt when the anointing come down upon me and a voice said I am the Holy Ghost and that is where that Doctrine come from you know an experience that they come the air you know it come from the area the prince it come from above it come it come down then compar with the word you know how you arrive that it has to be a scriptural voice so don't just hear angel angel talk what you saying what you say I can find brother Bram check what the angel was telling them with what's in the Bible and he was the prophet so is come and said they come open sees and sees and SE say good yeah good let me go to Bible now that that is how we are to be trained Oh Glory to God hallelujah therefore friends Hallelujah membership of a church knowledge of some theology doesn't have one thing to do with it it's got to be the blood of Jesus Christ and a new birth that join you to him as one person here you are oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so them Spirits according to what nature it is they will join the church to suit if they intellectual they join an intellectual church if they fanatical they join a fanatical Church they they connect with that anything goes in that church if they slack they join a slack church because their Spirit connect with that oh give the Lord some Praises if they cold and informal and what not they going join a little Presbyterian church and nice messages Hallelujah we going my goodness this is really good my mind is totally blown time to pump all these things to the people of today still reading take all kinds of a Spirits they go up and take Church Spirits they even take spirits that call themselves God Spirits I didn't see that don't come and stay you see that you know I reading for you they take up spirits that say they are God's spirit born again and deny the word of God he said could you imagine the spirit of God denying his own word oh Hallelujah so they have church spirits and we see it a pastor doing so and everybody doing so too when I hear a man talking like an ex-man I wonder who who talking why that is so my that's why I like and respect you Isaac is Isaac Anthony Anthony and Steven is Steven Gideon is Gideon and ber is ber nobody like me no because to me anytime you see Min to

all righto all right let me tell you where I'm at right now all right page 17 I'm going on to page 18 have 19 Pages musicians get ready please question question does the sons of God means Angels or Spirits from Heaven question that's was the person's question I believe that they wasn't Angels they were beings sons of God like the scripture says not Angels they were sons of God and they come from Heaven to Earth and was put into flesh not pressed themselves into flesh I believe all flesh is born sexual outside of Jesus Christ I believe he's the only virgin born being that ever was Jesus Christ I don't agree with Josephus and that great historian I do believe that they were supernatural beings that come down and took over the spirit of men and I believe they are right here today still walking around in jonville today them same beastly lustfully ungodly spirits that live in human beings listen to this now someday these men will die and if there's another generation that they will come right down on them he was saying these Spirits walking around inen lustfully and and and um we say there all right ungodly Spirits right in human beings someday these men will die and there's a an there's another generation they will come down to them remember God take his man but never his spirit this is the same holy spirit that they receive on Pentecost it's the same devil in religious form that persecuted Christ it's the same Devils that is in the church today wearing long robes so when God take a man he said I'll get it I'll read it to you the Holy Ghost on that man goes on somebody else and the Devils on people that's why sin here finish they catch the drug lord and they they hang them and they kill them when them dead the spirit on them drug lord drop on somebody else and they have a new drug lord The adulterous Spirit when that person die that adulter jump on somebody else do you get it now so they can't clean up this world unless he sons of God have to clean them up because the government legislate righteousness all the police could do is we have one here all the police lock up people but that is just from a natural standpoint but behind those people have spirits that directing them and guiding them it will not stop so you shoot all the bandits in tongue now this month and next month that's all them Spirits if you kill 10 Bandits it jump on somebody else you have a next 10 always go have police force it go always have Bandits it always have jail it going always need judge but but praise God I see a new Heaven and a new Earth I see sons of God coming back oh give the Lord some Praises here now oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm almost done here now now these evil spirits deceive people them many times they are very religious you mean religious yes even teach the scriptures is that Spirit doing that I notice Jesus came to a bunch of men that was holy priests kept the Lords to the letter and they were very religious John called them you Generation of Vipers who want you to flee from the r to come when Jesus saw them he said you have the Father the devil that was God saying that just as religious could be remember the devil takes his man but never his Spirit God take his man but never his spirit the Holy Spirit comes into your life and sanctify your spirit lives through you gives you power to live but when your spirit goes on your spirit is kept with God but the holy spirit that was on you comes on somebody else and somebody else and somebody else this spirit that was upon Elijah come upon elishah a double portion 700 years it come upon John the Baptist look how Elijah how Elijah was big old hairy man and so on and if that Spirit of Elijah that was upon John would make John act like that Spirit the spirit of God upon you will make you act like Jesus that is where you would find the holy spirit that is what the Holy Spirit does it makes you Meek it makes you humble it makes you
