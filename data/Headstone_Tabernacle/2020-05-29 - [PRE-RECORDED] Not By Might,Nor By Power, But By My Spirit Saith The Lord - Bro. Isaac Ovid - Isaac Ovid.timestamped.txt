[32:26] morning and my title is not by might nor
[32:32] by power but by my spirit saith the Lord
[32:37] come the church say mend
[32:41] and I have a subject Jesus Christ the
[32:44] same yesterday today and forever
[32:46] and an inspiration the spirit raising a
[32:50] standard to meet the challenge of the
[32:52] hour amen and a message just for a
[32:56] background revelation for Revelation
[32:59] chapter 4 3 where the Branham said all
[33:02] right here was voices oh how we need in
[33:04] jeffersonville thousands of live voice
[33:06] 'as the thunder of God thundering out in
[33:09] sweetness and holiness purity undefiled
[33:12] lives walking around the earth today
[33:14] without a blemish yes sir real
[33:16] Christians that's the thunder against
[33:19] the enemy the devil don't care how much
[33:21] you holla
[33:22] the devil don't care how much you can
[33:24] jump how much you can do this
[33:27] or shout but what hurts the devil is to
[33:30] see that sanctified holy life
[33:33] consecrated to God see anything to him
[33:36] call him anything just as sweet as it
[33:40] can be and move right on all my that
[33:43] throws him away that's the thunder that
[33:47] shakes the devil now I want to say
[33:49] something this morning Church it's not
[33:51] what the devil does it's a response to
[33:54] what did ever does it's not what takes
[33:57] place in our lives that God is looking
[33:59] at he's looking at our response
[34:02] so that's sanctified holy life say
[34:04] anything to him call him anything just
[34:08] as sweet as can be done goodness not
[34:11] looking at how much you shout and jumped
[34:13] but if not sanctified holy life and I
[34:16] wanna see this morning the devil has a
[34:18] response to the scriptures that's why
[34:20] when Jesus was in the wilderness
[34:23] the devil was probing and probing the
[34:25] devil has a response to the quotes
[34:27] because the devil he could read but that
[34:30] is not what the issue is the devil has a
[34:32] response to all of that but he has no
[34:35] response to the life because the moment
[34:37] you vibrate that life the devil has to
[34:40] back up
[34:41] to let you call when you present the
[34:44] life of Christ the devil has no answer
[34:47] to the life of Christ you don't have to
[34:50] say a word of but the life speaks
[34:52] something and the fact that you are here
[34:55] this morning is speaking something you
[34:59] are supposed to be backslidden but you
[35:01] are here this morning and that's a
[35:03] problem for the devil the fact that you
[35:06] are in the house of God this morning
[35:07] because come to the house of God opens a
[35:11] road up to the blessings of God it's up
[35:14] to you to walk on that road but when you
[35:17] are in his presence and you are under
[35:19] the canopy of life
[35:21] something could happen to you your word
[35:23] to come to you because we have heard a
[35:26] message before we have heard a word
[35:29] before it's not a new message of but
[35:32] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[35:34] Spirit will raise a standard but the
[35:38] Branham said my making the seem were
[35:40] more positive so the reasoning of the
[35:45] standard is not a new inspiration it's
[35:48] not a new dog trainer it's not a new
[35:50] idea it's not a new move but if the seem
[35:53] word more positive you heard it before
[35:56] but all of a sudden this morning it's a
[35:59] reality to you you have heard it before
[36:01] but this morning it's alive to you
[36:04] you've heard it before but this morning
[36:07] you feel a little different about it you
[36:10] have heard it before but this morning
[36:12] you're a little more fed up of what the
[36:14] devil has been doing so the world is
[36:17] more positive to you this morning you
[36:19] just woke up up on the right side of the
[36:22] bed so the word is more positive for you
[36:25] this morning you woke up knowing that no
[36:27] weapon formed against you nothing to
[36:30] devil can see to you nothing your
[36:32] husband your wife your brother your

[43:26] saith the Lord
[43:27] [Applause]
[43:29] oh my you may be seated
[43:33] from the same message the world is
[43:35] falling apart we are dead our lives I
[43:38] hit him God through Christ
[43:40] so through Christ our lives I hit him
[43:42] God
[43:43] so there's certain aspects of our life
[43:45] that are secret but I hit record that's
[43:48] why you are a mystery to the devil
[43:50] that's why when he encountered Jesus he
[43:52] had to act the question if thou be
[43:54] because his life was hidden there's a
[43:58] covering over you there's a mask over
[44:00] you there's a covenant over you and when
[44:04] the devil looks he's not too sure he's
[44:06] probing he's probing he's probing
[44:08] hallelujah and it seems he scepter to
[44:10] him because you fall and you feel and
[44:13] you make mistakes and for the devil the
[44:15] mathematics and not adding up how
[44:18] Almighty God will pick you you know you
[44:20] better than I know you the fact that
[44:23] Almighty God would protect you and put
[44:26] you under under the blood the devil
[44:29] cannot figure it out because the devil
[44:31] has a fire he has everything that you
[44:34] did but when God sees the file and look
[44:38] sure the blood he says there's nothing
[44:39] on the first page there's nothing on the
[44:42] second page what are you talking about
[44:44] the devil is the accuser of the Brethren
[44:47] he has a file on your wife a file on
[44:49] your children but when car pulls a file
[44:52] and he looks to the blood he said
[44:54] there's nothing against my pride what
[44:57] what are you talking about that's my
[44:58] lady I chose that lady I've engaged that
[45:02] lady I'm gonna be married to that lady
[45:05] don't you talk about my lady you are
[45:08] predestinated for the marriage supper of
[45:11] the lamb put a wedding supper
[45:14] [Applause]
[45:16] hallelujah somebody give God a shout of
[45:19] praise you may be seated my you are
[45:24] going to the wedding supper not as I
[45:26] guessed in the wedding supper but there
[45:29] are two seats and the wedding supper for
[45:31] the king and for the lady for the groom
[45:34] and for the bride you have reserved
[45:36] seating don't worry about your seat
[45:39] because you are the bride of Jesus
[45:40] Christ of angels I have to step aside
[45:43] prophet shall have to step aside
[45:46] apostles up after step aside behold the
[45:51] bride of Jesus Christ that's who we are
[45:55] Abraham wish he could have been a part
[45:57] of this up but this is bride time this
[46:00] is she time
[46:04] [Applause]
[46:06] you may be seated
[46:10] [Applause]
[46:16] we are dead
[46:18] our lives are hidden God through Christ
[46:20] and not only that but we are raised with
[46:23] him raised up what in a system a
[46:26] denomination organization as the Prophet
[46:28] we are resurrected in the kingdom of God
[46:32] and the kingdom of God is within you
[46:34] that's a prophet
[46:35] why all these man-made systems must fall
[46:42] not once more I'll shake the world but
[46:45] I'll shake heavens and those things that
[46:47] cannot be shook is what will remain and
[46:51] we receive a kingdom receiving a kingdom
[46:54] that cannot be shut or moved that's the
[46:56] kingdom of God not a system not a
[46:59] political wheel not a denomination but a
[47:03] kingdom and it's subjects are dead to
[47:05] the systems of this world to the system
[47:10] on your job dead to the systems of the
[47:13] culture dead to the systems of the
[47:16] fashion dead to the systems of what the
[47:19] other young people are doing dead to the
[47:21] systems of what other men do and it's
[47:23] normal and everybody else is doing it
[47:25] you're dead to all of that I don't care
[47:29] what the other wives do dead to that I
[47:31] don't care what your cousins and your
[47:33] sisters I don't care what it you can't
[47:36] do it because your life is hidden Christ
[47:39] everything you do is measured by Christ
[47:42] not measured by the church but measured
[47:44] by Christ and the church team and that's
[47:48] not everybody can the church see man
[47:51] oh my we're gonna have a clean Church
[47:55] we're gonna have a pure Church we're
[47:57] gonna have a holy church um we're gonna
[47:59] have a church where Jesus feels welcome
[48:02] to walk in through the aisles and sit
[48:05] next to you and say God bless you
[48:07] the cyma he sat in the temple before
[48:10] they call him jesus was just the air he
[48:13] was in the church it was his custom to
[48:15] be in the church but he didn't even
[48:17] realize who he was up and there's some
[48:19] sons and daughters here that we don't
[48:21] even realize who you are but you are
[48:23] attribute sons of God I don't care how
[48:26] your living doesn't change the fact that
[48:28] you call you for such a time as this
[48:36] [Applause]
[48:39] with the brand I'm sending a message
[48:42] perfect strength by perfect weakness you
[48:46] have your seat belts on right we're
[48:48] going for a ride
[48:52] God strategy is to take empty human
[48:56] vessels and shake the world with them
[48:59] that's what God wants to do take empty
[49:02] human vessels and shake the world with
[49:05] them like a Pentecost at Pentecost what
[49:08] did he do it taking them 10 days to get
[49:11] all emptied up but it was all standing
[49:14] there where their vessels turned up and
[49:16] God took himself and fill them up that's
[49:19] all that's the need of today that's what
[49:22] we need today is empty vessels so God
[49:25] can fill them up
[49:28] listen carefully friends God cannot use
[49:32] them as long as they already filled up
[49:38] so it is in Lord fill me if you're not
[49:43] empty there's nothing he can do because
[49:50] the poor in they has to be room for him
[49:54] to pull is anybody willing this morning
[49:58] to mg empty themselves to empty your
[50:07] thoughts to empty your qualifications to
[50:13] empty the chip you have on your shoulder
[50:15] - empty who your family is to empty this
[50:20] is what makes me what I am to empty this
[50:22] is how I feel about this brother this is
[50:24] how I feel about this services this is
[50:27] the problem that I have many people are
[50:30] filled up with their problems fill up
[50:33] with their issues fill up with their
[50:36] situations
[50:39] can we empty yourselves this morning so
[50:43] God can fill the vessels because if he
[50:46] fills the vessels everything will begin
[50:48] to change because when he steps into the
[50:51] picture
[50:52] nothing could stay the same way one time
[50:55] Aaron left his rod by mistake into the
[50:58] Holy of Holies and overnight it started
[51:01] to grow because it was in the presence
[51:03] imagine if that presence gets placed
[51:06] inside of you what will it do to cancer
[51:10] what will it do to diabetes what will it
[51:13] do
[51:14] [Applause]
[51:15] light and darkness cannot stay in the
[51:19] same house if that same spirit that
[51:21] raised Christ from the dead dwells in
[51:24] you the Bible says it will quicken your
[51:26] mortal body it will quicken your mortal
[51:32] body you may be seated
[51:34] it doesn't mean if you die it just
[51:36] raised you up again but it means you
[51:37] could be walking and feel quickened
[51:39] because that life has an effect that
[51:42] spirit has an effector there's a result
[51:45] of whenever that spirit comes into
[51:47] contact with something there has got to
[51:49] be a result can the church demon Oh for
[51:56] the challenge today is that people don't
[51:59] want to give up people don't want to
[52:02] empty up people don't want to let go
[52:04] because people have their own biases
[52:07] their own feelings and because God is so
[52:09] good he gives you free will he's not
[52:12] forcing himself in anybody he's a
[52:15] gentleman he says behold I stand at the
[52:18] door and knock and if any man hear my
[52:20] voice I'm not coming and breaking down
[52:22] your door I'm not doing that but I'm
[52:27] gonna knock and I'm gonna know I don't
[52:30] know gonna knock until like a tired of
[52:32] knocking because the Bible says seeking
[52:35] a lot while he might be found call upon
[52:37] him while he is near so there's a time
[52:39] limit when God is no longer knock what
[52:42] would you excuse me for not opening the
[52:45] door it was my mother it was my father
[52:47] it was the pastor it was the church it
[52:50] was my job I had no money I wasn't
[52:52] feeling well I was vexed I had a body
[52:55] had about week I had a bad month I had a
[52:58] body err idle about a kid I had about my
[53:01] whole life what will you excuse me
[53:06] some months ago I preached a message no
[53:08] more excuses because when Moses stood in
[53:11] from the burning bush and he said I
[53:13] can't talk I can't walk
[53:15] I don't know tears I don't attack after
[53:17] he was finished God say you're still
[53:18] going you have any more excuses because
[53:21] after all of your excuses it's still up
[53:24] to the individual you cannot blame
[53:26] anybody
[53:27] and if God says you are going you have
[53:30] got to go you may be seated
[53:35] [Music]
[53:37] Jonah thought he was okay when God told
[53:41] him good this way he said you know what
[53:42] let me slip out let me slip on the other
[53:49] way and while Jordan is slipping out the
[53:52] other way
[53:52] thinking he's flying under the radar he
[53:55] takes a ship he said there's no way God
[53:58] will get me over this ship on this ship
[53:59] and while the port is heading in the
[54:03] wrong direction the Bible said a storm
[54:06] came and as he poured she can chew on is
[54:09] that they'll feel convicted that's when
[54:12] you know you're calling on when there's
[54:15] a few convicted when you know don't even
[54:18] soul this in right this road are going
[54:22] on here right everybody else on this
[54:25] boat but I am Oh - please this Plataea
[54:27] minute here right what I'm wearing - did
[54:30] alright how I left home this morning in
[54:34] here right this music are listening to
[54:36] it all right
[54:37] this conversation I mean it all right
[54:41] this job a minute here right Jonah silly
[54:44] son is not all is your problem I am the
[54:47] problem
[54:48] Lord give us some Christians who can say
[54:51] I am the problem you may be seen it
[54:55] listen you see whenever you hear from
[54:57] God your vocabulary changes from you
[55:00] them to I when Isaiah metal or this
[55:03] annoys me I am a man of unclean lips
[55:08] whenever you meet God is never about
[55:10] anybody else you look at your own life
[55:12] and say Lord I'm a sinner I'm a sinful
[55:15] man I need help a little touch so Jonah
[55:18] confronted the reality of his existence
[55:20] and say I am the problem is it threw me
[55:24] overboard
[55:24] he had to have hit sinner is it throw me
[55:27] overboard
[55:28] I didn't wanna catch him but he just
[55:29] said get me off of this boat yet enough
[55:31] confidence that if he get off here
[55:34] behind and when Jonah caught off of the
[55:36] boat there was a prepared fish for Jonah
[55:39] Jonah didn't even know this fish had GPS
[55:42] because fish was programmed to take
[55:46] Jonah direct his destiny I want to see
[55:49] Church you will get to your destiny the
[55:52] easy way or the hard way
[55:54] Jonah had the option to go straight to
[55:57] Nineveh he took the hard way but he end
[55:59] up right at Nineveh and you young people
[56:02] in the church you can take the easy way
[56:04] or you can take the hard way but you are
[56:07] gonna get to Holy Ghost
[56:08] you are gonna dress right you are gonna
[56:10] live right you are gonna act right you
[56:13] will respect your parents you will honor
[56:15] God the easy way or the hard way
[56:18] but it's gonna happen
[56:21] [Applause]
[56:27] can the church say Amen not by power not
[56:31] by might but by the spirits here the law
[56:34] can the church say man everybody feeling
[56:37] fine everybody feeling good everybody
[56:40] feeling in the spirit why you may be
[56:44] seated
[56:44] [Applause]
[56:47] so God's God got to have empty vessels
[56:52] so he can fill them up and that's what
[56:56] all the situations in your life that you
[56:59] cannot explain it's all about it's God's
[57:02] desire for you to empty out because when
[57:06] you are fill you depend on what you are
[57:08] filled with so when you have too much
[57:10] money your money is what you depend on
[57:13] when you fill with wealth you go by the
[57:15] doctor no one that a woman with the
[57:17] issue of blood it was when her money ran
[57:19] out and she was empty that she's had to
[57:21] look for an alternative solution to the
[57:23] problem she had had she had money she
[57:25] would have found every single doctor but
[57:27] the Bible said she exhausted her
[57:29] resources she was empty and her
[57:33] emptiness brought a desperation to look
[57:36] for alternative medication
[57:41] there's anybody in the house looking for
[57:43] alternative medication this morning you
[57:46] tried money
[57:47] you tried fornication you try drinking
[57:50] your try false doctrine your try being a
[57:53] good judge member but that's not the
[57:55] same thing as the medication of the
[57:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost when the
[58:00] Spirit comes upon you it's a whole
[58:02] different walk it's a different talk
[58:04] it's as if my life can the church say
[58:07] man my from the message speak to this
[58:17] mountain I believe that the Church of
[58:20] the Living God is moving into a sphere
[58:23] now that's gonna shake the whole world
[58:26] [Applause]
[58:29] the shaking of this world is not because
[58:32] of natural powers right on this
[58:34] political shaking is there's this
[58:37] government shaking hands wars and rumors
[58:39] of wars there's oil and every session
[58:41] and all of this this is this is
[58:43] scripture being fulfilled we shouldn't
[58:45] be surprised in fact me happy heads up
[58:48] we know what's gonna happen before what
[58:49] happens people are told of school and
[58:51] study kind of mix and thing I say well
[58:53] it's boom and bust cycle we know that's
[58:54] already I don't need a degree to tell
[59:00] you this whole world going on in the
[59:02] financial ruin the Bible says so people
[59:05] can study for seven years kind of
[59:06] doctrine in in economics already
[59:08] currency this and that and the Bible
[59:10] already tells you that already war than
[59:15] rumors of wars you already already have
[59:17] your script but the end is not yet
[59:21] but this gospel will be preached and
[59:24] then the end will come
[59:26] that's our gospel that's our message
[59:29] that's our word
[59:31] so nothing Russia could do could affect
[59:34] the planet garage has to wait on us
[59:36] president Trump after wait on us after
[59:38] we force a sign of an ziyan floor we
[59:40] ready we are preach the gospel in Poland
[59:43] demonstration we are ready for the
[59:45] rapture dan the end will come
[59:47] that's the gospel when Jesus stood in
[1:00:00] front of Pilate in these guys you see
[1:00:03] power power means my father give a
[1:00:05] little mission to you have a little
[1:00:07] piece a garden and is my father give any
[1:00:09] garden you have what you talking about
[1:00:10] if I want back up I call him back up
[1:00:13] didn't realize who he was but Jesus knew
[1:00:16] who he was and his knowledge of who he
[1:00:18] was and the position of who he was gave
[1:00:20] him a certain authority of faith and
[1:00:21] confidence to live a certain way and
[1:00:23] that's what we ought to be he was not in
[1:00:25] the best position when he was in prison
[1:00:27] but he didn't change the fact of who he
[1:00:29] was Joseph imprisoned in the fact of who
[1:00:32] he was
[1:00:34] Jesus sleeping on the poor didn't change
[1:00:36] the fact of who he was so whether you
[1:00:38] are tired weary sick of ashrita doesn't
[1:00:41] change the fact of who you are and the
[1:00:43] power locked up inside of you
[1:00:45] somebody say man who but Abraham said I
[1:00:53] believe that the Church of the Living
[1:00:54] God is moving into a sphere now that's
[1:00:57] going to shake the whole world that's
[1:00:59] the first time it's been since the days
[1:01:01] of Jesus of Nazareth a human being
[1:01:04] ask anything that you will and it shall
[1:01:07] be given unto you anything you desire
[1:01:10] don't you see the words of Jesus Christ
[1:01:12] being fulfilled
[1:01:13] oh it's gonna happen pretty soon I'm
[1:01:16] looking for to happen in this meeting
[1:01:18] but the Browns face was so much is 1959
[1:01:20] huh I'm waiting I'm wanting it to happen
[1:01:23] now that the anointing will strike the
[1:01:26] whole Church of the Living God and you
[1:01:29] rise to her feet like
[1:01:30] my team marching army the sick will be
[1:01:33] healed by a wood
[1:01:35] the blind will see the Deaf will hear
[1:01:37] the Dead will be raised up and the power
[1:01:40] of God will shake the world with the
[1:01:43] Church of the Living God we are in the
[1:01:45] process of it now I believe it's soon
[1:01:47] coming to pass I believe it will be just
[1:01:50] exactly that way I believe it's gonna
[1:01:53] strike the Church of God soon and listen
[1:01:56] listen to the promise and it's going to
[1:01:58] suck a revival that will shake the world
[1:02:00] I believe it so in every age we know
[1:02:13] there was a thunder and this age and
[1:02:16] this time all the thunders from every
[1:02:20] age come together because the last age
[1:02:22] and in a message expectation but the
[1:02:24] banham said now if God has promised a
[1:02:26] revival we're going to have it so let's
[1:02:29] make ready for it if God promised to
[1:02:32] heal now listen this is so powerful
[1:02:34] because but the Branham is just bringing
[1:02:37] the promises to the people he's not
[1:02:39] speaking to their situation he is
[1:02:41] speaking about the promise she said if
[1:02:43] God promised to heal let's make ready
[1:02:46] for it so he is speaking to people
[1:02:48] looking for healing and he said well if
[1:02:50] you are about to be healed get ready for
[1:02:53] it
[1:02:56] I wanted to sink a little bit if you if
[1:03:00] you're on a destination for the Holy
[1:03:02] Ghost then get ready for it
[1:03:04] because it's coming if your children are
[1:03:07] gonna be restored get ready for it if
[1:03:11] your daughter is coming back to the
[1:03:13] house of God get ready that make
[1:03:16] preparation sweet begin to buy some
[1:03:19] extra food but when it comes to you can
[1:03:21] happy food ready to cook for them
[1:03:23] because they're coming make ready for it
[1:03:27] where the parent said move out
[1:03:30] everything gets ready we're right in
[1:03:32] time he says no it'll seem foolish no
[1:03:36] you see well how it's gonna happen in a
[1:03:37] deal like this and I don't care what
[1:03:40] anything contrary is - that is wrong we
[1:03:43] can see it I see know what we look like
[1:03:45] but if God said so let's do it anyhow
[1:03:48] because God said so I'm expecting it
[1:03:50] somebody say man my so anybody expecting
[1:03:54] a revival
[1:03:55] [Applause]
[1:03:58] I'm under great expectation for real
[1:04:02] revival in about 40 days we'd have our
[1:04:08] convention here the tabernacle and I'm a
[1:04:10] great expectation if you are not
[1:04:12] explicitly for your own life and your
[1:04:14] old walk that's you but I'm my next
[1:04:16] petition but the Branham said and I want
[1:04:18] to bring it back to the church so we
[1:04:20] know what we are expecting but the
[1:04:23] Browns another revival causes five
[1:04:24] things he said a revival bring souls to
[1:04:28] Christ
[1:04:29] well Brown said it will bring the church
[1:04:31] back to the spiritual condition it
[1:04:34] should be in the revival brings close
[1:04:38] communion with God a revival brings
[1:04:41] fellowship among the churches and in the
[1:04:43] revival you pray for the sick I'm gonna
[1:04:46] Brown them in a message making the
[1:04:48] valley full of ditches if that's what we
[1:04:50] need tonight is a good old-fashioned
[1:04:52] backwards sing killin sky-blue religion
[1:04:56] bleach under the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:58] that's what we need and in the third
[1:05:01] series a familiar code that's a reason
[1:05:03] that the Reve hours that we're supposed
[1:05:05] to have we have the nomination revivals
[1:05:08] we havin a real stirring no no no no no
[1:05:10] sir don't think we have got revivals we
[1:05:13] haven't oracle millions and millions and
[1:05:15] millions of church members but not a
[1:05:18] revival nowhere but the pastor the bride
[1:05:20] hasn't had a revival yet see there's
[1:05:23] been no revival there no manifestation
[1:05:26] of quarter stood a bride yet we are
[1:05:28] looking for it it'll take those seven
[1:05:31] unknowns another back there to wake her
[1:05:33] up again he was senator he promised it
[1:05:37] so what are you looking for preacher I'm
[1:05:39] looking for a manifestation of God the
[1:05:42] stood the bride for a reality that'll
[1:05:46] make you walk different talked different
[1:05:48] live like a Christian can't you see me
[1:05:51] oh my vii under revival is the pride
[1:06:00] revival if there's no seventh in the
[1:06:03] revival there will be no rapture if
[1:06:04] there's no seventh in revival there'll
[1:06:06] be no resurrection the seventh ton this
[1:06:08] is what gathers the pride is seven
[1:06:10] thunders will give the pride see the
[1:06:12] seven thunders what sort of bride how to
[1:06:14] code but I'm said this is still my
[1:06:17] background I'm getting to my text
[1:06:18] shortly and the only way you're ever
[1:06:21] gonna see your way out of whatever
[1:06:24] you're going through is an old fashioned
[1:06:27] spiritual revival when the hallelujahs
[1:06:30] of court is ringing from the bottom of
[1:06:32] your heart and an old-fashioned Holy
[1:06:34] Ghost and really hits the place then you
[1:06:37] begin to see things then core will begin
[1:06:39] to reveal things then you'll wonder why
[1:06:41] these real questions are hanging on why
[1:06:43] they are praying for you can the church
[1:06:45] say men Oh hallelujah let me wrap up my
[1:06:49] initial thoughts here but the Branham
[1:06:53] said the church is a pond again bunch of
[1:06:57] believers that's in Christ by the Holy
[1:07:01] Ghost led by the Spirit of God that's
[1:07:05] what he describes the church as we're
[1:07:08] not of the world they are out of the
[1:07:10] world they are different from the world
[1:07:14] that's what makes them what they are so
[1:07:17] what makes them what they are is their
[1:07:19] difference from the world that's what's
[1:07:23] made out their life is dead and they're
[1:07:25] hidden Christ dead in Christ on the head
[1:07:27] and sealed by the Holy Ghost they are
[1:07:30] away from the things of the world sons
[1:07:33] of God are led by the Spirit of God that
[1:07:35] led by some other fanatics or some
[1:07:38] organization or somebody one another
[1:07:39] they are led by the Spirit of God the
[1:07:41] Holy Spirit
[1:07:42] listen was given to the church to be the
[1:07:45] overseer the tutor that was to raise
[1:07:47] that sharing of God not our bishops and
[1:07:50] Cardinals and so forth but the Holy
[1:07:52] Ghost and listen to what Mary Ellen said
[1:07:55] I'm expecting this is my expectation
[1:07:57] also I'm expecting the Holy Ghost not
[1:08:01] denomination not a
[1:08:02] not a Catholic priest not a Baptist
[1:08:05] preacher or a pen I'm expecting the Holy
[1:08:07] Ghost to come down and set in order a
[1:08:10] church that will go to meet him fill
[1:08:12] with the power and a resurrection of
[1:08:14] Christ I'm expecting that I believe that
[1:08:17] God promised it that'd be a church
[1:08:19] without spot or wrinkle on it I'm
[1:08:22] expecting it because God said so can the
[1:08:28] church say man
[1:08:29] so let me strike my text a little bit
[1:08:32] the spirit raising a standard to meet
[1:08:35] the challenge of the hour now every hour
[1:08:39] has its challenges in the days of Noah
[1:08:43] they had their challenges and the day of
[1:08:44] Moses they had their challenges in the
[1:08:46] day of Moses they were in slavery they
[1:08:49] were working for the Egyptians they were
[1:08:50] under the oppression of hero that was
[1:08:52] the challenge that they were facing and
[1:08:55] they had to have something to meet the
[1:08:57] challenge of that hour so when God sent
[1:08:59] Moses down to Egypt they finally got a
[1:09:02] hope to meet the challenge of the hour
[1:09:04] in every age in the Dark Ages the
[1:09:06] Christians were being killed in Lions
[1:09:08] Den and this that was the challenge of
[1:09:11] the hour and they had to have a great
[1:09:13] fit to live in that hour how many people
[1:09:16] wish they could be in a rage where
[1:09:25] in that AG was easy enough who is just
[1:09:29] one question are you a Christian and
[1:09:31] there were only two possible answers
[1:09:33] good there was no maybe
[1:09:34] is he that yes or no it was yes was
[1:09:36] Lyons then it was yes it was hanging
[1:09:39] across every was no you go and he live
[1:09:41] your life and I'm not with those people
[1:09:43] that it was easy this day is harder
[1:09:46] the Baxter there'll be a day where it's
[1:09:48] neither day or night is in the middle
[1:09:49] everything is great you're not too sure
[1:09:52] you have a lot of maybes now there's no
[1:09:55] yes and there's no days are you a
[1:09:57] Christian kinda I'm in the message gray
[1:10:05] area in the message but the master had
[1:10:08] enough walking in the middle but it's a
[1:10:11] challenge in every age and there's a
[1:10:14] challenge of this hour and something has
[1:10:16] to come for us to meet and match the
[1:10:18] challenge of the hour now I share this
[1:10:21] with a change before but everybody was
[1:10:23] down here it was a communion service a
[1:10:25] long time ago thing about a year or two
[1:10:28] ago and I was speaking about when the
[1:10:31] enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit
[1:10:34] will raise our standard against it we
[1:10:36] all familiar with the scripture right so
[1:10:38] I was many tasted on this scripture when
[1:10:40] the enemy comes in like a flood that I
[1:10:41] always wondered why did the Bible use
[1:10:45] the word flood to describe it when the
[1:10:48] 20 enemy comes in like an earthquake or
[1:10:50] the enemy comes in like a tornado or the
[1:10:53] enemy coming like a hurricane but if
[1:10:55] somebody enemy comes in like a flood and
[1:10:58] a flood is defined as an overflow of
[1:11:01] water that submerges land which is
[1:11:04] usually too dry a flood is where water
[1:11:08] ends up where it's not supposed to be
[1:11:11] it usually takes time for a flood to
[1:11:14] develop rain must fall for a prolonged
[1:11:17] period of time for a flood to develop a
[1:11:21] quick lasts a few seconds but a flood is
[1:11:24] different
[1:11:25] destroys lives property change the
[1:11:28] landscape and it can last for a long
[1:11:30] time in nature you can't fight a flood
[1:11:33] if there's a fire you could pull a fire
[1:11:35] extinguisher but what do you do when
[1:11:38] there's a flood a flood is coming it
[1:11:40] takes time and if it happens in it and
[1:11:43] you just have to deal with it you could
[1:11:46] build a house to handle earthquakes
[1:11:47] tornadoes fire but a flood is different
[1:11:50] the average tornado can last 10 minutes
[1:11:54] maybe an hour but a flood can last for
[1:11:56] months in Noah's day the flood lasted 40
[1:12:00] days and 40 nights the three worst
[1:12:03] disasters in the last thousand years
[1:12:06] have all been floods in 1931 it was
[1:12:10] estimated that up to 4 million people
[1:12:13] were killed in the hankie River flood
[1:12:16] you could try to prevent it but you
[1:12:19] couldn't stop it comes to destroy it
[1:12:22] comes to break down and it comes to
[1:12:25] break up but the Bible says when the
[1:12:27] enemy comes like a flood the Spirit
[1:12:30] would raise us
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:35] and many of us in our lives you know war
[1:12:38] it has been like rain upon rain upon
[1:12:41] rain when you thought something else
[1:12:43] couldn't more wrong it was running and
[1:12:45] no you look around your life and it
[1:12:47] seems as you're standing in this flood
[1:12:48] but when the enemy comes like a flood
[1:12:51] that's when the spirit put raised a
[1:12:54] standard and in the spiritual the enemy
[1:12:56] has attacked there's been flood after
[1:12:58] flood flood of evil throne of sickness
[1:13:01] through lot of interpretation but every
[1:13:04] time there's a flood the Spirit will
[1:13:07] always come and raise the standard come
[1:13:10] the church say man the three Hebrew boys
[1:13:13] they were here and they had their
[1:13:15] testimony and they told him listen you
[1:13:18] can't breathe you can't worship you have
[1:13:20] to pony and they said we will not bow
[1:13:22] down and they had to deal with their own
[1:13:25] flood they have to deal with their own
[1:13:27] challenge and they say we will not bow
[1:13:29] down but when they enter the fiery
[1:13:31] furnace of the spirit raised a standard
[1:13:34] to defend them and they overcame the
[1:13:37] flood the situation that they have to
[1:13:39] deal with
[1:13:40] there's no flood there's no situation
[1:13:42] there's no temptation there's no trial
[1:13:46] that the spirit kind of raised the
[1:13:47] standard against it can the church a man
[1:13:52] not by might nor by power but by my
[1:13:57] spirit share the Lord so maybe you're
[1:13:59] dealing with the flood of high blood
[1:14:01] pressure when the enemy comes in like a
[1:14:03] Florida the Spirit will raise the
[1:14:06] standard
[1:14:07] [Applause]
[1:14:10] in every age they had their flood we
[1:14:16] have all floods also God doesn't have
[1:14:20] shortcuts and the God is nothing the
[1:14:23] business of making it easy for some
[1:14:27] people all that come to God have to be
[1:14:30] tried have to be tested and you have
[1:14:33] your personal flood that you have to
[1:14:36] deal with in your life you will have the
[1:14:39] hard keys and you have your storms too
[1:14:40] but the flood is serious but we all know
[1:14:43] floods but when the enemy comes in like
[1:14:45] a flood the Bible says the Spirit will
[1:14:49] raise a standard and I shared before
[1:14:52] because I know many people don't know
[1:14:54] what a standard is and in ancient times
[1:14:56] a standard identified who you were so
[1:15:01] the tribe of Judah would have it
[1:15:04] standard it would have been a stick with
[1:15:07] a symbol or something on it I would
[1:15:10] represent the tribe so when the
[1:15:14] Philistines and the Jebusites and
[1:15:16] Hittites come they will all have their
[1:15:18] standards their banner that represented
[1:15:22] who they are the standard would see
[1:15:24] whose side you're on the standard would
[1:15:27] represent your history because you would
[1:15:29] take time to have a standard so Judah
[1:15:32] might have been a lion and whatever it
[1:15:34] was was a standard of the child the
[1:15:37] tribe repeated the style represents what
[1:15:39] you believe this time when you see the
[1:15:42] standard it's a reminder of what you're
[1:15:44] fighting for the standard supposed to
[1:15:48] keep you together because we're the
[1:15:51] standard is that's where you're the rest
[1:15:53] of your people because the army moves
[1:15:55] with the standard so in the child and
[1:15:58] Israel come together for war you would
[1:16:00] see the standard for Judah the standard
[1:16:02] for God the standard even Italian
[1:16:04] all the men of war would stand with your
[1:16:06] standard I mean the standard Paris had
[1:16:09] charge you would move with the standard
[1:16:13] in the heat of the battle the standard
[1:16:16] would mean hope because you can be under
[1:16:19] pressure but once a standard is being
[1:16:21] lifted you know there's somebody else on
[1:16:23] your side who is holding the standard up
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:28] if the enemy has you under option you
[1:16:31] gotta look for winners Tannen is because
[1:16:34] a standard mean they're more men around
[1:16:36] the standard well you don't hear me this
[1:16:39] morning
[1:16:41] [Applause]
[1:16:46] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may
[1:16:52] be seated
[1:16:52] I'm normally this cannot but be wherever
[1:16:55] the king or the general is the general
[1:16:59] was stand here because you represent the
[1:17:01] last bastion so even when men are caught
[1:17:03] to fight the general will be here with
[1:17:06] the standard to let you know we are here
[1:17:08] and if I need us any more reinforcements
[1:17:11] the real world will come from the
[1:17:13] standard okay men over there over there
[1:17:15] over to that side when the standard
[1:17:18] Falls it means you're finished if the
[1:17:23] standard Falls
[1:17:24] it means the army is finished because
[1:17:26] whatever happens the men will fight the
[1:17:28] defender standard even if there's one
[1:17:31] man left with the standard they will
[1:17:33] take a standard back to whoever's
[1:17:35] remaining I'm from another army wrong
[1:17:38] the standard that's how powerful a
[1:17:39] standard world
[1:17:45] when you see the stander it means rally
[1:17:49] when you see the standard it means this
[1:17:51] is where we make our stand if we must
[1:17:55] die here we will die here but we were
[1:17:58] standing with the standard you may be
[1:18:03] seated
[1:18:06] depending on how you use it the standard
[1:18:09] can mean charge this Tanika mean go to
[1:18:11] the left this time if amigos at all
[1:18:13] right this time I can meet up all black
[1:18:17] you may be seated
[1:18:19] in those days they have no
[1:18:21] walkie-talkies
[1:18:22] they had no radios they have nobody seen
[1:18:25] I'm on channel 2 move to the left
[1:18:28] movie now no the standard is where the
[1:18:30] instructions came from chewiness
[1:18:32] standard circle him it meant something
[1:18:35] it means everybody gets into war when
[1:18:37] the standard go up and down it means
[1:18:39] something that's an important standard
[1:18:41] was the standard para had to know when
[1:18:45] was the right time to move the standard
[1:18:47] the right time to raise the standard
[1:18:49] because you know what to give away the
[1:18:51] move before it's time the standard era
[1:18:54] was one of the most important rules
[1:18:56] outside of the general but the Bible
[1:18:59] says when the enemy comes in like a
[1:19:01] flood the Spirit would raise the
[1:19:04] standard it wouldn't be man raising the
[1:19:07] stand up it wouldn't mean oh you know
[1:19:10] you hear me it'll be the spirit itself
[1:19:12] given the cry to charge when it's time
[1:19:16] for your children to come back the
[1:19:18] spirit what she time is up bring them in
[1:19:22] raise the standard prepare for war
[1:19:27] [Applause]
[1:19:35] hallelujah
[1:19:38] [Applause]
[1:19:41] so I want you to understand what the
[1:19:44] scripture means and in context God is
[1:19:48] not just in this time' to anybody else
[1:19:50] he said for this flood I'll raise our
[1:19:53] standard myself I will give the orders
[1:19:56] myself I will give the instructions
[1:19:58] myself now in modern times we don't have
[1:20:02] standards like those anymore in modern
[1:20:06] times we call it a flag that's the
[1:20:09] modern version of what they had a
[1:20:11] standard years ago so when so let's go
[1:20:14] to war I know there's some brothers here
[1:20:18] who would smile when they say when man
[1:20:20] went to the moon they put the flag on
[1:20:23] the moon there's somebody who say well
[1:20:25] man didn't go to the moon as a different
[1:20:26] message but wherever you go and you
[1:20:31] claim the territory your standard marks
[1:20:34] possession so when she would have
[1:20:39] entered into the promised land
[1:20:40] every place you put your foot is yours
[1:20:43] they will make sure when they took an
[1:20:45] area they put the standard up this is
[1:20:47] ours
[1:20:49] Trudeau dad whatever it is the standard
[1:20:53] represented ownership
[1:20:56] can the Jets eman the standard the part
[1:21:00] of the flag means is our territory this
[1:21:04] is my family this is my house as for me
[1:21:07] and my house we will serve the Lord
[1:21:09] there's a standard in my house he's a
[1:21:12] standard in my life can the church see
[1:21:15] me oh and I shared this i shared his
[1:21:23] story back then and when I preached on
[1:21:25] this there's a story of a war that was
[1:21:28] going on and by the nights he was losing
[1:21:30] the war understand that be era he was
[1:21:34] running ahead of the other men and as
[1:21:36] he's running the men around him are
[1:21:39] being killed
[1:21:40] left and right but he knows that they
[1:21:43] have to get to the other side and the
[1:21:45] general of the army screamed out to the
[1:21:49] flagbearer
[1:21:50] he said bring back the flag we got a
[1:21:53] retreat and that flag bearer scream back
[1:21:57] I'm not bringing it back bring up the
[1:22:00] men bring up the blacker I've got to
[1:22:03] keep going
[1:22:04] I've come too far to turn back now bring
[1:22:08] up the men I've already reach this far
[1:22:10] I'm not gonna retreat now I've been a
[1:22:13] Christian for this long I might have
[1:22:16] lost brothers I might have lost sisters
[1:22:19] but I'm heading to the promised land
[1:22:21] bring up the men bring up the soldiers
[1:22:27] nor retreat no given up I'm gonna be
[1:22:31] tired but I'm not giving up I might be
[1:22:34] wearing but I'm not giving up I might be
[1:22:37] standing alone but I'm not giving up
[1:22:39] bring up two men and this morning I say
[1:22:43] bring up the men the land is a good land
[1:22:46] it's a fluent ladder show a milk and
[1:22:49] honey
[1:22:50] [Applause]
[1:22:52] Oh hallelujah hallelujah so any enemy
[1:23:05] comes in like a flood the spirit would
[1:23:10] give the final judge and all through
[1:23:12] history we have had standard bearers
[1:23:15] Gideon was a standard bearer he said the
[1:23:18] sword of the Lord and of Gideon what a
[1:23:21] declaration what a feat the sword of the
[1:23:24] Lord and of Gideon Joshua was a standard
[1:23:27] bearer the enemy had come like a flood
[1:23:30] and he needed more light he couldn't do
[1:23:32] it himself and he spoke and said son
[1:23:36] stand still and the spirit raised the
[1:23:39] standard and the church came and oh my
[1:23:44] and I said it before you may be seated
[1:23:47] Joshua was just so focused on winning
[1:23:50] the war Joshua was estelle about physics
[1:23:53] or geometry or geology because as
[1:23:56] anybody knows the Sun doesn't move
[1:23:58] around here it is the earth moves around
[1:23:59] the Sun so when Josh was his son stand
[1:24:02] still he actually activate some
[1:24:05] mathematical equations for the earth to
[1:24:07] stop moving
[1:24:10] Josh I wasn't bright enough to know it
[1:24:13] was the earth had to stop moving
[1:24:15] this is Suns standstill and God said you
[1:24:18] know what to do stop it
[1:24:20] because a son need some backup
[1:24:24] so you might even see the right way but
[1:24:27] when he said lord help me
[1:24:28] god knows what to t it's his son Antigua
[1:24:32] oh you don't hear me this morning
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:43] mine that's why some time when you pray
[1:24:47] the words might even come out I might be
[1:24:50] outgrown I get a cry my people you might
[1:24:54] be able to see the words what the
[1:24:56] situation is but you're you're deep down

[1:25:18] hears every cry he hears every scream he
[1:25:22] hears every morning he knows every
[1:25:25] situation
[1:25:28] Oh help us Jesus help us Jesus the
[1:25:34] things that you can't even see he knows
[1:25:37] what's coming down in your soul but if
[1:25:40] there's a cry in there he knows what it

[1:26:16] that's what he does that he can't help
[1:26:18] himself that that's his nature that his

[1:26:57] of holiness it's a standard of purity
[1:27:00] it's a standard of righteousness

[1:27:16] standard of seven living voices it's a
[1:27:18] standard of adoption it's a standard of
[1:27:21] perfection it's not a new standard this

[1:27:30] Christ the same yes
[1:27:32] to tell forever is there anybody in the
[1:27:35] house who will help me lift that

[1:28:18] this tender is one Lord is one feet it's
[1:28:22] one baptism they are not two standards
[1:28:25] there's just one standard but the
[1:28:27] Branham came to point us to the standard
[1:28:29] he came to 4-under standard because the
[1:28:33] standard is a greatest weapon that the
[1:28:35] world has ever seen this standard is a
[1:28:37] word
[1:28:38] the standard is spirit and when the word
[1:28:40] and spirit comes together the standard
[1:28:42] is called dynamic Sun this planet is
[1:28:44] called mechanics and enemies together
[1:28:46] for my lap arena that's the standard the
[1:28:50] standard was laid out on the day of
[1:28:52] Pentecost when the panel's header before
[1:28:55] the doctors hands touches my wife this
[1:28:58] channel was being lifted the show that
[1:29:01] the standard is still here oh you don't
[1:29:04] hear me this morning this has never left
[1:29:07] can the church say ma'am and when the
[1:29:11] enemy comes like a flood the Spirit will
[1:29:14] raise the standard to give you hope to
[1:29:16] keep on fighting tick if you hope to
[1:29:18] keep on pressing to give you hope that
[1:29:20] your son is coming to give you a hope
[1:29:22] you and I get the holy OSA he is that a
[1:29:25] whole pot that's under this Christ in
[1:29:27] you the hope of glory
[1:29:30] [Applause]
[1:29:37] hallelujah you may be seated and I love
[1:29:41] it I wanted to really sing down because
[1:29:44] people want to claim that they are
[1:29:46] holding the standard that the standard
[1:29:50] is in this church and the angel is in a
[1:29:52] church and the organizing is in this
[1:29:54] church and the Bible says when the enemy
[1:29:57] comes in because the enemy came in and
[1:29:59] that church that was established earlier
[1:30:01] Pentecost fell into the ground and that
[1:30:03] flood took the church out and in every
[1:30:06] age a flood came but the Branham said
[1:30:08] the floods camera but luta that's Tanner
[1:30:11] was raising his name it was a looter
[1:30:13] raised in a standard it was a spirit
[1:30:15] raising the standard of I remember the
[1:30:18] Branham left the standard did not leave
[1:30:20] the standard in hand to any man the
[1:30:23] Tanner was always in the hands of the
[1:30:24] spirit this fella has never left the
[1:30:27] hands of the Spirit but the Holy Ghost
[1:30:29] as a standard bearer would stand with
[1:30:32] any man who stays with the word you
[1:30:34] don't hear me this morning the standard
[1:30:36] era
[1:30:37] who is the holding us up will identify
[1:30:39] himself up with any son who stays with
[1:30:42] the word would any top ha who sees with
[1:30:45] the word with any group who stays it
[1:30:48] [Applause]

[1:30:55] standard para you may be seated the
[1:30:57] spirit has no loyalty to manner the
[1:31:00] standard bearer only has a loyalty to
[1:31:03] his word oh my and once you see the
[1:31:07] world that's why the Prophet said
[1:31:09] obedience the entire world entitles you
[1:31:13] to being accompanied by the standard
[1:31:16] error because it's a spirit that follows
[1:31:19] the world it's a spirit that brings life
[1:31:22] to the world

[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:35] you may be seated with the Brandon he
[1:32:43] prayed for that man who was mind and
[1:32:45] that man went away and he came back he
[1:32:49] said I'm still blind and put the brown
[1:32:52] said he's because he didn't our feet and
[1:32:55] feet come by here in the wood so he
[1:32:59] hadn't had enough wood that was mixed
[1:33:00] with the feet
[1:33:01] activate the bread I was already spoken
[1:33:03] so but I said I can pray for you again
[1:33:05] you already prayed for you once I pray I
[1:33:09] already actively to resource from heaven
[1:33:11] no it's on you to have enough feet to
[1:33:13] receive it so we told the man go around
[1:33:16] seen by stripes I'm healed because
[1:33:18] that's also the word so when that man
[1:33:20] suddenly see my stripes I'm healed my
[1:33:22] stripes I'm healed what he didn't
[1:33:24] realize is every time he said it it
[1:33:26] became more read to him the
[1:33:28] standard-bearer was walking closer
[1:33:30] walking closer walking closer
[1:33:33] walking closer because a standard-bearer
[1:33:36] always follows the world the
[1:33:38] standard-bearer wants his feet mixed
[1:33:41] with the world the standard era he's
[1:33:43] attracted to it
[1:33:46] [Applause]
[1:33:49] somebody say man oh my
[1:33:53] what flood is bugging you down this
[1:33:56] morning what situation has you
[1:33:59] overwhelmed this morning I don't care
[1:34:01] what it is
[1:34:02] there's no flood that this sand appear
[1:34:04] can't deal with you may be seated
[1:34:08] hallelujah somebody give God which
[1:34:11] somebody give God praise somebody enter
[1:34:15] in this morning oh my but then I think
[1:34:34] you you haven't touched my flood you
[1:34:39] don't know my flood what I'm going
[1:34:44] through you don't have to my flood is
[1:34:50] different this one it's not like anybody
[1:34:54] else's flood that's how many of us feel
[1:35:00] sometimes come to church and you do your
[1:35:05] best to put on the best message
[1:35:10] Christian face you could put on but
[1:35:16] you're in a flood
[1:35:20] you have on rubber boots lifejacket
[1:35:25] because you don't know if you're gonna
[1:35:27] fall down and fruit in this flood I want
[1:35:35] to challenge you this morning I don't
[1:35:38] care what the flood is there's a word
[1:35:41] for every flood there's a word for every
[1:35:46] situation but you have to find the word
[1:35:51] for your situation you have to find a
[1:35:55] word as David did to encourage himself
[1:36:00] the word that encourages you will be
[1:36:03] different on the word and encourages
[1:36:05] somebody else because we all have our
[1:36:07] different floods we all have our
[1:36:10] different challenges we all have our
[1:36:12] different struggles that comes with this
[1:36:15] Christian walk and this Christian
[1:36:18] journey I challenge you to at the living
[1:36:21] quarters stop looking at other people's
[1:36:23] floods and trust God
[1:36:29] to bring healing in your soul and
[1:36:32] healing in your life that you could live
[1:36:35] the kind of testimony that Gorka see
[1:36:38] there's my son dears my daughter you
[1:36:40] imagine a flood that Joel was in he lost
[1:36:46] his property he lost his children he
[1:36:49] lost his money and his wife is the end
[1:36:52] with him in the flood and you say why
[1:36:55] don't you Chris board and die but job
[1:37:00] kept standing because there was
[1:37:01] something in him to stand friends
[1:37:06] backsliding is not an option giving up
[1:37:11] is not an option even though sometimes
[1:37:17] you feel like giving up some egg or cats
[1:37:21] you giving up you know what the Bible
[1:37:22] says I believe in Luke chapter 5 Jesus
[1:37:25] comes and he sees some brothers Simon
[1:37:31] and different ones I believe it was the
[1:37:33] Bible said they were washing their nets
[1:37:35] anybody familiar with it I heard let me
[1:37:42] read it in Luke 5 verse 1 and it came to
[1:37:45] pass that as the people pressed upon him
[1:37:48] to hear the word of God Sugiyama Jesus
[1:37:51] he stood by the leak of knesset
[1:37:53] and saw two ships standing by the leak
[1:37:57] but the fishermen were gone out of them
[1:38:00] and we're washing their nets and
[1:38:06] normally when you have to access a
[1:38:09] person if your net was in the water why
[1:38:11] I need to wash it but his men were
[1:38:14] washing their nets because they were
[1:38:16] done they were finished they are caught
[1:38:21] nothing we see literally they are caught
[1:38:24] nothing but they will finish they are
[1:38:26] given up they had resigned themselves
[1:38:28] saying we are going home without food
[1:38:34] but this day was different because Jesus
[1:38:36] comes by them
[1:38:39] and the Bible says he entered into one
[1:38:41] of the ships which was Simons and prayed
[1:38:44] him or asked him and he would trust out
[1:38:45] a little from the land and he sat down
[1:38:49] and taught the people out of the ship
[1:38:52] and when he left speaking he said unto
[1:38:55] Simon launch out into the deep and let
[1:38:57] down your nets for a draught and Simon
[1:39:02] answering him said master we have 12 all
[1:39:06] night long that's why I was washing my
[1:39:09] head it's not that I didn't try to be a
[1:39:13] fisherman I didn't try to catch you so
[1:39:15] didn't try to come to church I tried but
[1:39:20] I didn't catch anything so I found
[1:39:25] myself washing - I have taken nothing
[1:39:27] nevertheless and I would I will let down
[1:39:30] the net and the Bible says and when they
[1:39:33] had done this they enclosed a great
[1:39:36] multitude of fishes and their net break
[1:39:38] and they beckoned under their partners
[1:39:41] which were in the other ship that they
[1:39:43] should come and help them and they came
[1:39:45] and filled both the ships so that they
[1:39:47] began to sink
[1:39:51] and when Simon Peter saw it he fell down
[1:39:55] at Jesus knees saying depart from me for
[1:39:58] I am a sinful man Oh Lord for he was
[1:40:01] astonished and all that were with him at
[1:40:04] the drop of the fishes which he had
[1:40:07] taken and so was also James and John the
[1:40:10] sons of Zebedee which were partners with
[1:40:13] Simon and Jesus said understand fear not
[1:40:15] from henceforth thou shalt catch men
[1:40:19] fishers of men but I want to touch on
[1:40:23] something here friends you know many
[1:40:27] times as Christians people have this
[1:40:31] bravado they will do glory hallelujah
[1:40:34] and the stuff going on it's okay
[1:40:41] for stuff to be going on in your life
[1:40:42] it's okay to be tired Jesus himself was
[1:40:45] not that's why he was sleeping on the
[1:40:46] boat when the storm came Christians get
[1:40:49] tired Christians feel weary sometimes
[1:40:53] and these men as I heard somebody say
[1:40:56] one time he said as a businessman you
[1:40:58] would never employ people who want to
[1:41:00] give up but Jesus came to these men who
[1:41:04] were quitting the job with old results
[1:41:07] and he was still willing to work with
[1:41:10] these men friends many times in our
[1:41:15] Christian journey we found ourselves
[1:41:16] washing on it we are willing to give up
[1:41:24] because things didn't work out for us do
[1:41:27] we weep and it's not easy to toilet all
[1:41:30] night and catch nothing it's not easy to
[1:41:34] work hard and see no fruit of your labor
[1:41:38] but Peter said something powerful is he
[1:41:40] act I would
[1:41:42] I'm willing to try one more time and if
[1:41:49] it's anything that church gets this
[1:41:50] morning is to be willing to try one more
[1:41:55] time
[1:41:57] willing to give God y'all one more time
[1:42:02] willing to live the right way one more
[1:42:06] time
[1:42:07] willing to forget the toil of the night
[1:42:10] the toil of the last year the toilet the
[1:42:14] last ten years willing to forget the
[1:42:16] pain and of not catching anything you
[1:42:21] sit in church you see other people get
[1:42:23] blessed and you wonder Lord where's my
[1:42:24] blessing I want that kind of blessing I
[1:42:27] feel I'm gonna wash my nads
[1:42:30] I see people in church and they are
[1:42:32] happy and they're rejoicing but I don't
[1:42:34] know what they're having but my walk is
[1:42:36] different and I'm washing my nets I'm
[1:42:40] ready to just give up friends there's a
[1:42:45] word this morning cast your net one more

[1:43:43] outpouring of the holy ghost pepper the
[1:43:46] brands that would be so powerful this

[1:43:50] powerful it'll be a short quick message
[1:43:53] it'll shake the whole nation so powerful
[1:43:57] that your family will have no choice but
[1:44:00] to come back and if you have doubts
[1:44:01] about it if God could take a Lazarus
[1:44:04] from being dead and Lazarus had no

[1:44:09] or daughter who is living wherever they
[1:44:11] are doing whatever they are doing God is

[1:47:07] the spirit friends is here to take us
[1:47:10] all the way to the rapture don't lose
[1:47:12] sight that we are heading to a rapture
[1:47:15] don't lose sight of the fact that we are
[1:47:17] heading to the end of all things
[1:47:20] don't lose sight of the fact that
[1:47:23] there'll be two in a bed and one will be
[1:47:27] taken and one will be left it's so easy
[1:47:31] to get caught up with this and pattern I
[1:47:34] would realize that no matter what goes
[1:47:39] on you have to display the token because
[1:47:41] only the token will be accepted only the
[1:47:46] token is what guardo recognized and when
[1:47:49] abraham said in the talk and apply a
[1:47:51] church now don't feel and what the
[1:47:54] banham says it over and over don't don't
[1:47:56] don't let the sunset don't don't don't
[1:48:00] don't rest day or night
[1:48:02] don't take no chance it won't work
[1:48:04] children it won't work you must have the
[1:48:07] token all that God has done to his world
[1:48:10] over all these years were to bring it to
[1:48:12] a spot that token could be in your heart
[1:48:15] could be identify that you could be
[1:48:17] identified with a token and more than
[1:48:19] that the truth can be egg that I'd be
[1:48:21] identified with you but the Branham said
[1:48:23] you say I believe I believe the message
[1:48:25] you say that's all right
[1:48:26] that's good but you must have to took
[1:48:28] him do you hear Branham Tabernacle and I
[1:48:30] see this morning do you hear his tone
[1:48:32] Tabernacle you must have the token
[1:48:35] displayed without it all you're
[1:48:37] believing is in vain see you live a good
[1:48:40] life you listen to what the word says
[1:48:42] you go to church you try to live right
[1:48:44] that's fine but that's not it when I see
[1:48:48] the blood that's the token don't just
[1:48:51] come this far say I believe the message
[1:48:54] you obey the messenger come into Christ
[1:48:57] you say well I believe every word said
[1:48:59] brother branham that's good but that's
[1:49:01] just being able to read to eat the
[1:49:04] message take it into your heart that you
[1:49:07] must have the token the very life that
[1:49:10] was in Christ being you when I see that
[1:49:11] I'll pass over you but they ran I said
[1:49:17] now look at yourself we're coming to
[1:49:19] your house now we come into your life
[1:49:21] now look at yourself don't look at
[1:49:23] anybody look at the really are you a
[1:49:24] genuine Bible Christian full of the love
[1:49:27] of God remember the Bible said in the
[1:49:29] last days when this time takes place he
[1:49:32] said a mocking angel went through the
[1:49:35] churches went through the cities and
[1:49:38] sealed
[1:49:39] only those who cried inside for the
[1:49:42] abominations was done in the city is
[1:49:44] that right
[1:49:45] Ezekiel 9 we know that's a truth that
[1:49:47] Mark in angel went forth and put a mark
[1:49:51] on their head forehead seal them then
[1:49:53] that side and cried after that come the
[1:49:57] slaughtering angels from the four
[1:49:58] corners of the earth which is coming
[1:50:00] right away we see her coming Wars moving
[1:50:03] right another kill the whole hood off
[1:50:05] there was nothing that couldn't touch
[1:50:07] but damn that have that mark I wonder
[1:50:11] this morning church if the marketing's
[1:50:13] or the sealing angel moves through this
[1:50:15] church this morning I wonder how many
[1:50:18] people would be marked how many people
[1:50:22] are saying and crying for the
[1:50:25] abomination in the city
[1:50:27] God does not recognize your attendance
[1:50:31] in church because that's not what he's
[1:50:33] looking for whether you come or don't
[1:50:35] come he's he already gave his word he
[1:50:37] said forsake not the assembling I've
[1:50:39] said that's already spoken but this is
[1:50:43] going beyond you coming to church this
[1:50:45] is going beyond you being in the message
[1:50:47] this is boils down to what's in your
[1:50:50] heart that nobody else could see because
[1:50:54] coming to church for some is just a
[1:50:56] formality being in a message for some is
[1:50:58] just a formality but it's going deeper
[1:51:01] to those that sigh and cry for the
[1:51:03] abomination in the city
[1:51:05] those that recognize that judgment is
[1:51:08] hanging over not just the world but over
[1:51:10] the church because the Bible says begin
[1:51:13] in my sanctuary begin in the house of
[1:51:16] God judgment begins in the house of God
[1:51:19] because we ought to know better we have
[1:51:22] to learn but what are we doing with the
[1:51:24] word church we have the encouragement
[1:51:26] every week but always sighing and crying
[1:51:29] are we praying always seeking are we
[1:51:31] opening our hearts to God and say Lord I
[1:51:34] am willing like Samson to die with the
[1:51:37] Philistines I am willing to give up
[1:51:41] everything in the world I'm willing to
[1:51:45] give up the worldly life I'm willing to
[1:51:47] give up my worldly commitments I'm
[1:51:49] willing to give it all up for the sake
[1:51:52] of this token oh my god friends we have
[1:51:59] to be in rapture in condition that's
[1:52:02] what the Spirit is here for not to make
[1:52:05] us jump and shout and just be in the
[1:52:07] spirit but it's a get us into a
[1:52:09] condition a condition to go into the
[1:52:12] rapture a condition like Peter when
[1:52:16] Peter walk people can be healed in a
[1:52:18] shadow he was in a condition what's your
[1:52:21] condition this morning this rapture is
[1:52:26] not for a group is not for the church
[1:52:28] it's not for the past it's it's for the
[1:52:32] individual they are pastors who will
[1:52:34] miss the rapture they are preachers who
[1:52:37] will miss their elders deacons so
[1:52:39] leaders are musicians in the message
[1:52:40] that will miss the rapture because I
[1:52:44] wrapped in has respect your position it
[1:52:48] respects the token
[1:52:50] friends one taken one left you can have
[1:52:54] knowledge and mr. rapture you can speak
[1:52:57] in tongues and mr. rapture you can see
[1:53:00] the poor and mr. rapture you can get the
[1:53:02] body to be burned and mr. rapture but
[1:53:05] you must have charity dynamics to token
[1:53:08] the life vii under invoices Christ in
[1:53:12] you the hope of glory to make it to the
[1:53:15] rapture conventions will not place you
[1:53:18] in the rapture believe in the right
[1:53:20] doctrine will not bring you to the
[1:53:22] rapture it's that life its humility it's
[1:53:29] that Tunde that sheiks the devil friends
[1:53:34] don't let us lose the focus of why we
[1:53:37] are in the house of God this morning we
[1:53:40] in the pull the purpose of why we are
[1:53:42] here to get our lives right but god it's
[1:53:46] no good to just come to church and and
[1:53:48] feel good and be encouraged and we did
[1:53:51] the encouraging part you couldn't make
[1:53:52] it you know that but it's something you
[1:53:55] must do you must live a certain way we
[1:53:59] have become too relaxed will become too
[1:54:02] complacent we have taken things lightly
[1:54:05] we have lost our sincerity we have lost
[1:54:09] the plannin to be holy the standard has
[1:54:14] never been dropped it still the same
[1:54:17] standard be holy because I am holy it
[1:54:22] still the standard
[1:54:24] [Applause]
[1:54:27] the standard is still thou shall have no
[1:54:30] other gods before me that still the
[1:54:32] standard the standard does not change
[1:54:39] I'm good when the Lord is tended we have
[1:54:43] to come up to his standard I don't care
[1:54:45] how bad they look I don't care what your
[1:54:47] boss says or what everybody is doing in
[1:54:49] university does not matter the standard
[1:54:53] is still the standard because everything
[1:54:55] that can be shaken will be shaken and
[1:54:58] all in a standard will remain I know
[1:55:05] this is a positive message
[1:55:07] everybody loves the Scholten part
[1:55:09] everybody loves to see this time to take
[1:55:12] you all to the flood now I'm going
[1:55:14] beyond the flood you all to the flood
[1:55:16] now but you have a destination and for
[1:55:21] that destination is a requirement and
[1:55:23] quarter not change the requirement if
[1:55:26] you have to travel you need a passport
[1:55:27] if you need to go to the US you need a
[1:55:30] visa go to the world changer requirement
[1:55:32] because you are who you say you are you
[1:55:35] have to have your passport you have to
[1:55:37] have your visa stamp it I am in the
[1:55:39] bride of Jesus Christ and the Bible says
[1:55:42] by one spirit you are baptized into the
[1:55:44] party has nothing to do it who your
[1:55:47] pastor is what church you go to
[1:55:49] that's foolishness have you received the
[1:55:54] Holy Ghost since Yubel era it's been the
[1:55:57] theme of every apostle since the day of
[1:56:00] Pentecost and it's still the message
[1:56:02] today we need a spirit we need a Holy
[1:56:06] Ghost
[1:56:06] we need the practice of a fire to tater
[1:56:09] evil out
[1:56:12] [Applause]
[1:56:15] you may be seated
[1:56:17] that's the only way your money will feel
[1:56:22] you your body will feel you your mind
[1:56:25] will feel you but this Holy Ghost will
[1:56:27] never fail will never fail Oh hallelujah
[1:56:33] hallelujah oh I don't know why I'm here
[1:56:38] this morning but we are here this
[1:56:40] morning we are in the world this morning
[1:56:43] we are in somewhere this morning I know
[1:56:46] young people it pains me it pains me
[1:56:52] with how much we have now that those who
[1:56:56] went before us didn't have there was a
[1:56:59] time when the spook with books would
[1:57:01] come and it would be a rush to not only
[1:57:05] get it but a waiting list to read it
[1:57:08] because it was food for the Soul
[1:57:11] that was before technology now the
[1:57:14] message is on the Internet the messages
[1:57:16] on apps on your phone and people don't
[1:57:19] even want to read it there was the time
[1:57:24] Bibles weren't allowed to be in your
[1:57:27] houses
[1:57:27] that's why Martin Luther found the Bible
[1:57:30] chained up in the Catholic Church and he
[1:57:33] found a scripted adjuster let my feet he
[1:57:35] didn't find it in his house because I
[1:57:37] had taken the Bible's off the street no
[1:57:40] your Bibles and all's we have babbling
[1:57:42] are phones we are barreling our iPads
[1:57:45] and people don't want to read it
[1:57:46] I'm caught or just four marriages in the
[1:57:49] world day and night so you have good
[1:57:51] success what's wrong with us water
[1:57:54] rapture are you going to if you don't
[1:57:56] read your Bible what kind of Christian
[1:57:58] are you if you are not even serious
[1:58:01] about making your calling and election
[1:58:03] sure god help us
[1:58:09] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:58:11] this morning I'm dealing with the flood
[1:58:14] of formality the flood of being lukewarm
[1:58:16] the flood of being complacent the father
[1:58:20] being lazy the father being ungrateful
[1:58:23] second Timothy three spirit heady
[1:58:26] highminded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:58:29] lovers of God we make time to do what
[1:58:35] you want to do but call a prayer meeting
[1:58:37] and you can't find the church that's the
[1:58:40] flood that we are dealing with this
[1:58:42] morning but when the enemy comes in like
[1:58:45] a flood
[1:58:47] I want to see some of you sure your job
[1:58:59] to the angel when he acts to see the
[1:59:02] token look my job look up as always I
[1:59:06] have him I work so much over time this
[1:59:09] is what will take me to the rapture are
[1:59:12] you foolish are you crazy
[1:59:18] your job is a means to an end it's not
[1:59:22] the end there's an end this attack your
[1:59:24] job is not the destination when the
[1:59:31] ceiling angel moved through Egypt I went
[1:59:33] from house to house all he was looking
[1:59:35] for was blood he didn't want to hear
[1:59:39] talk explanation reason and
[1:59:42] justification when let me send you an
[1:59:43] email about why I should pass by this
[1:59:45] house so pastor each of this night can
[1:59:50] smile all the firstborn but if I see
[1:59:54] blood I'll pass over if I see blood I'll
[1:59:56] pass over have you applied the blood on
[1:59:59] your house have you apply the blood in
[2:00:01] your life or are you so lazy about
[2:00:04] applying blood
[2:00:04] you now have so much time to do
[2:00:06] foolishness you find yourself living in
[2:00:08] sin because if you are busy to win
[2:00:10] courts business you don't have time oh
[2:00:12] you don't hear me this morning
[2:00:15] make yourself busy about the business of
[2:00:19] God and see God bless you see God make
[2:00:22] you prosper see God opened doors for you
[2:00:26] [Applause]
[2:00:31] yes there is a flood there's a flood in
[2:00:35] our marriages there's something very
[2:00:38] wrong in the message very wrong in the
[2:00:42] message when people when we have just as
[2:00:45] much separation in marriage as in the
[2:00:47] world it may not be visible separation
[2:00:52] but there's no love in the house there's
[2:00:56] something very wrong in the message
[2:00:58] remember the Branham labored and poor
[2:01:00] labored and Irina's labor and Martin
[2:01:03] labor and Columba labored to bring a
[2:01:07] message for us for us not to be
[2:01:09] different from the world we read the
[2:01:13] quote we ought to be different we also
[2:01:15] do better because we have been given
[2:01:17] much and so much is given much is
[2:01:20] expected
[2:01:21] if we spend more time praying and see
[2:01:24] you seeking the will of God we'd have
[2:01:26] less problems with our children less
[2:01:28] problems with our marriages less
[2:01:30] problems with the person next to us
[2:01:32] behind us in front of us but when the
[2:01:36] enemy comes back of Florida this spirit
[2:01:38] would raise a standard
[2:01:40] [Applause]
[2:01:49] no revival no breakthrough could come
[2:01:53] without sacrifice look through history
[2:01:56] every revival came because of prayer
[2:01:59] came because of sacrifice the Bible told
[2:02:02] him in that did dig a valley full of

[2:03:50] clothes you're wearing are you crazy
[2:03:52] and you want to come to the house of God
[2:03:53] and expect God to do something for you
[2:03:56] when the least that you can do he said
[2:03:58] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[2:04:01] of holy what is your reasonable service
[2:04:04] is that a hard thing to do it's
[2:04:07] reasonable for you to present your body
[2:04:09] as a living sacrifice
[2:04:12] [Applause]
[2:04:22] [Music]
[2:04:27] it's give me liberty or give me death
[2:04:30] there's no middle ground we could have
[2:04:33] no revival on middle ground we can only
[2:04:36] have revival if we are giving over all
[2:04:38] to God
[2:04:39] to many of us we give a lot we give 90%
[2:04:43] we give 92% we use 75% we have 99% but
[2:04:47] God is a jealous God and he wants all of
[2:04:51] you he wants everything he wants all
[2:04:54] your worship he was all your praise he
[2:04:57] was all your love he was all your
[2:04:59] adoration he was all your worship he
[2:05:02] wants to be your all and all he wants to
[2:05:05] be or everything up he wants to be the
[2:05:07] reason you woke up in the morning he
[2:05:09] wants to be your is there anybody in the
[2:05:11] house
[2:05:11] [Applause]
[2:05:19] the Holy Spirit is raising a standard
[2:05:23] here this morning it's not a new
[2:05:27] standard it's the same standard is the
[2:05:31] same standard that said sisters don't
[2:05:32] cut you here is the same standard that
[2:05:35] says you should cover your knees it's
[2:05:37] the same standard that says don't listen
[2:05:38] the world in music it's the same
[2:05:40] standard that says pray every day it's
[2:05:43] the same standard that says read every
[2:05:45] day is the same standard that says to
[2:05:47] forgive it's the same standard that says
[2:05:52] be holy is the same standard that says
[2:05:56] drop your hearts it's the same standard
[2:05:59] it's on the news 10 is the same standard
[2:06:02] God will have a perfect Church it could
[2:06:05] be three people it'd give me five people
[2:06:06] they could be ten people but all God I
[2:06:08] want to be one of them I want to be one
[2:06:12] of them sums with a flat sum to the
[2:06:17] flood but all through the blood
[2:06:19] you could be gonna play something softly
[2:06:24] [Applause]
[2:06:30] the worst place to ever be as a
[2:06:35] Christian is when you lose your
[2:06:39] sensitivity to the spirit because when
[2:06:46] the word goes forth
[2:06:47] there's conviction that lets you know
[2:06:51] Lord I'm not living right or Lord I need
[2:06:55] to do more Lord I've been trying but I
[2:06:58] could try more something should be
[2:07:00] happening friends if you stifle that
[2:07:03] voice after a while but the Branham said
[2:07:07] you will no longer hear it
[2:07:08] and you lose your sensitivity and when
[2:07:13] you lose your sensitivity you almost as
[2:07:16] good as fetish friends
[2:07:19] so I challenge you this morning if you
[2:07:21] hear that voice talking about your soul
[2:07:24] see him come back home make things right
[2:07:27] you have given so much time effort focus
[2:07:31] energy to so many other things and God
[2:07:34] is saying what about me what about my
[2:07:37] time what about your soul
[2:07:40] you spend so much time when the natural
[2:07:42] what about the things that I eat that
[2:07:43] will last I'm gonna every head bowed
[2:07:45] every eye closed wrote a sanctuary this
[2:07:47] morning maybe there's somebody here this
[2:07:51] morning maybe you have been in church
[2:07:55] for a while maybe you have not it
[2:07:56] doesn't matter this is not between you
[2:07:59] and the church is between you and God
[2:08:01] there's a call going out a cry going out
[2:08:04] to return unto the Lord yes there are
[2:08:09] floods yes there are trials yes they are
[2:08:11] testing but you are called to a higher
[2:08:14] purpose and God will never give you more
[2:08:17] than you could be here maybe you found
[2:08:19] yourself washing your net giving up on
[2:08:22] life giving up on everything but it's a
[2:08:25] word this morning and maybe like Simon
[2:08:27] Peter you say Lord at thy word I'm
[2:08:29] willing I'm willing to be a real
[2:08:32] Christian I'm willing to read the Word
[2:08:35] of God every day I'm willing to pray
[2:08:37] every day I'm willing to fast and seek
[2:08:39] your face and Lord if I have to die with
[2:08:42] the Philistines let me die with a
[2:08:44] Philistine but once more knowledge is
