richly bless you we amen going to read ephesians 6 6 10. my birthday be strong in the lord and spot in the power of his might to put on the whole armor of god that he may be able to stand against the wall of the devil for we wrestle not against the flesh and blood but against the principality against a power against the rule of darkness of this world again the spiritual wickedness of these higher places amen ecclesiastes chapter 11. all young men in that youth and learn our heart to cheer these in the days of your youth and walk in a way in thine heart and in the side of their eyes but no doubt for all this god will bring you into judgment therefore remove all sorrow from your heart and put away ever from the flesh for childhood and youth or vanity amen joshua chapter 1 only be that strong and be very courageous that you might observe according to the other lord that moses my servant has commanded thee this book of the lord shall not depart from the mouth and that you meditated therein day and night if our mayors observe to do according to all this written therein may the lord have a blessing in the reading of the word they bow here for the word of pray lord our god and our kingdom we thank you for this great moment you're granting in that presence it is a great privilege to stand here in this convention in this great convention of trinidad or lord god what you allowed us to bear witness to help someone somewhere a young brother young sister somewhere to know that god is still alive this morning and he answers all our question lord god bless this moment that we're going to have blessed children truly that church the pastor the office of it and all the ministers reverend isaac albin all those who are working for the progress of your work all the great men all across the world that you call to preach in this end time we pray that you may bless them the ministry and the church regret it i'll be the lord's satisfied jesus amen may be seated god bless you it is a great privilege for us to stand here in this convention the virtual training convention in this convention i want to thank pastor uh to office of it it's a great man of god we love and we appreciate respect and god bless him him his wife and church and family reverend isaac and all those who working there in trinidad in that church in headstone tabernacle where the medicine the song leaders deacons we appreciate them may god bless all this great men of god that will be speaking here and testifying god be with them of it is inspired that people have opportunity to testify and we're appreciate that we're not worthy of that but we uh we say we're unworthy but we've been called to say something just share something i know that each one of you have a testimony but god wanted me to or wanted us to speak here i am i'm not born in a christian family i was not a christian but i met with the men's siege and i was baptized in 1997. you know brother this message is not catholicism it's not catholic this is the thought of god that was spoken in this end time we're living in and the devil will always attack what is from the lord that's why young people you must be strong the what i just read in the book of joshua when god spoke to joshua after moses died he said trafficking yourself be strong and take this book of the law turn not on left on on on right if you do that you will prosper whatever you do are not coming it's messy to have a good position in the church neither to be a follower because you must know what you believe this message and very soon when i was going to school and i believe this message i was so uh sunk into the message that can wake up early in the morning at 5 00 a.m praying and testifying the word of god everywhere at worst at school and when i get in my class i i will pray five three or five minutes and then say i commit the day to the lord not because i was afraid for the uh of a demon but i wanted everybody to know that i am a christian because everywhere you display yourself they will respect you and then at work don't be afraid to show who you are just imagine if the president of this country was my father what would i do everywhere i go i will say this president is my father i will just now imagine the great god of heaven the creator of heaven and earth the man whom who established the president is my father and the bible said that we are a stranger and peregrine on this spirit if you send your son to a foreign country do not leave him alone amen you're not going to leave him alone if there's something he'll call you amen to tell you daddy there's something wrong i need money i need this or that how much more how god will place us on this earth where he knows that the devil has come down in revelation 12 the bible said the devil came down on earth he was chased out he was kicked out from heaven because when he found no room in heaven and it is on his earth you think that god will leave you alone with the devil knowing all this going on when you you take your son somewhere in foreign country you expect him to call you when he have problem you can have a problem of connection you may have a problem of this but if you have received the holy ghost in the heart no problem of network he is in you he is in you day and night you need only to be in contact with him young people encourage you don't give up just run for your life the holy ghost is very important i can talk about many things that god has done in my life people have the social position knowing not god people have the great they have me but knowing that god god bless me i cannot lie god has done many things in my life i want to say this once again once we were at work i was working in uh insurance company and my boss i don't know what she saw over me but it's like i was disturbing him you know in all this i was loving him and then he went somewhere he said that you're gonna fire me took all my documents say i need to fight this guy if god said that you got to be somewhere no matter how the demon will round up man i have not followed a man i have not followed church i have not followed doctrine the devil trying to entertain you by facebook but this we know facebook facebook it depends on what you're gonna do with it if your fellowship with a brother is good but you have to go argue with the word of god of a message what life do you show you argue oh my pastor is greater than the other person after this who is glorified the devil you know with my heart might have all that we want on earth to be healed and tomorrow for sick again to have a good position in the company and lose our job but one thing you're not gonna lose when god sees you down in your soul and your heart is forever young people be strong this message is true this message is life just wrestle for life rest nuts to be recognized somewhere or to have something to be recognized i said this to stop or too close we know what we have lost i know what i have lost when he took oh he took my cv took my document he could not fire me and then he looked for audits to to audit my work when the audit came they said to him sir this is one of the best worker you have in the company he's not your problem your problem is somewhere else this and that and that and i said god said me this is the time for you to leave this company because your name has been spelled and i took i wrote my letter of re resignation i said boss i'm going i'm leaving he said i did not insult him i said you are the one of the best boss on this earth there's no man to tell you the contrary he said oh i want to raise you he said no it's not a problem of money i want to live and not experience it what god did in me for me in the spiritual realm and then he graced me the 22 july 2000 tree he baptized me with the holy ghost and now i'm standing not matter young people wherever you are now listen let's nobody let's nobody facebook is not a pastor social media are not your pastor if you go you'll find something there the bible say just concert the scripture and go meet your pastor but let's not body the devil but we
