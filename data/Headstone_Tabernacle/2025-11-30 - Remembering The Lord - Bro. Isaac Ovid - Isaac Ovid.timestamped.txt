[53:00] It's a blessing to be in the house of
[53:02] God. [applause] It's a blessing to be
[53:04] back. And we're looking to see what the
[53:07] Lord will do in a special way
[53:10] &gt;&gt; today. And as we go forward in faith
[53:13] that God will bless and pour out his
[53:14] spirit. Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; I bring you greetings from India, from
[53:18] Germany, from France, from Nigeria, from
[53:21] last church we were in is Lagos Nigeria.
[53:24] Bring your greetings from the breadth of
[53:25] India and they're looking forward for
[53:28] the time we're going to have next year,
[53:29] July.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; I know. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[53:34] [applause]
[53:34] I know last uh uh Sunday a message was
[53:38] preached on a summer of compassion and I
[53:40] trust the Lord that you were blessed
[53:42] with it.
[53:43] And um [applause]
[53:45] I think I preached on brotherly kindness
[53:47] some time ago in in New Jersey and we
[53:50] got feedback from different parts even
[53:53] around the world concerning this thing
[53:55] about forgiveness. But today I have a
[53:57] testimony from brother Isaac Opiev I'd
[54:00] like to read for you. But before that
[54:01] let's bow our heads for a prayer right
[54:03] where you are. Heavenly Father, we thank
[54:05] you for your presence and we thank you
[54:08] for your grace that has given us this
[54:09] opportunity to surrender our lives to
[54:12] you. Father God, a word came even
[54:16] Wednesday night about selling, giving,
[54:18] and following. Father, we come to follow
[54:21] you. We want to be led by you and
[54:24] directed by you. We all have our
[54:27] choices. We all have this power of
[54:28] decision. And we choose to come this
[54:31] morning, Lord, looking for one word from
[54:33] you. That's all it would take, Father,
[54:35] to transform up our hearts and our
[54:37] lives. So may you speak to us, each one
[54:39] here, those that are here present and
[54:41] those that are connected online. May
[54:42] your presence be with them in a special
[54:44] way. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen and
[54:46] amen. So this is from Pastor Isaac Oji.
[54:50] Dearly beloved uh pastor, greetings to
[54:53] you and your wife, family, and church in
[54:55] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. On
[54:57] behalf of my family and our local church
[54:59] newi, I want to thank you so much for
[55:02] the blessings you were to us on the
[55:04] weekend of November 14th to 16th in a
[55:07] just concluded con convention.
[55:09] Testimonies are coming in from far and
[55:11] near and from believers who were not
[55:13] even physically present at the meetings.
[55:16] The Lord used you mightily and in a
[55:17] special way to break iron bars and
[55:20] captives were set free. The inspiration
[55:23] on brotherly love and forgiveness was
[55:25] very timely. And in season two, a
[55:28] brother sent me a message and shared his
[55:31] testimony of deliverance from the
[55:33] unforgiven spirit. He has an he he he of
[55:38] unforgiving spirit. He has had issues
[55:40] with other pastor and this problem for
[55:43] has lasted for years. He also regards
[55:46] one as an enemy, especially if you say
[55:49] otherwise from his own views. Different
[55:52] efforts from different brethren have
[55:54] been put in to resolve the problem, but
[55:57] to no avail. But your message came as if
[56:01] you already knew what had been going on.
[56:05] And as God would have it, this brother
[56:07] was in the meeting. And after hearing
[56:10] the messages without any mediation or
[56:13] persuasion he decided to let go in so
[56:18] much that he went to the brother and for
[56:21] the first time in many years they could
[56:23] greet each other and even shake hands.
[56:27] Your inspiration on Saturday night
[56:28] November 15th was coming into his
[56:30] presence and truly nobody can come into
[56:34] his presence and remain the same. Thank
[56:37] you, Beloved, for your sacrifice and
[56:40] sacrifices and labors of love for the
[56:41] bride over the years. Thank you for
[56:43] coming to Newi 2025. May the Lord bless
[56:46] and strengthen you over and over again
[56:48] for more blessings in the future if the
[56:50] Lord tries. Please send our love to your
[56:53] wife, brother Isaac, and the entire
[56:54] Headstone Tabernacle Trinidad. God bless
[56:56] you richly, Brother Isaac Opiday. Praise
[56:59] the Lord.
[57:01] [applause]
[57:04] So we thank God for that today that you
[57:07] know we have testimonies of this thing
[57:09] and I didn't realize that sometimes with
[57:11] different individuals it's hard to let
[57:13] go and to forgive but it's a choice that
[57:16] each one of us have to make
[57:18] &gt;&gt; if we intend to get God's healing and
[57:20] blessings and virtue
[57:22] &gt;&gt; and I believe in the message itself I
[57:24] spoke about uh people not letting go
[57:27] things something happened years ago and
[57:29] you don't want to keep harping it happen
[57:31] it happen You have to let it go.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; You have to let it go like how Christ
[57:35] let your your sins go.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Like how Christ free you, you have to
[57:38] free others also. As God forgive you,
[57:41] you could forgive others. As God
[57:42] released you, go you could release
[57:43] others. If you don't want that release,
[57:46] then you just have to hold on.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Hold on yours and grudge and so on. So
[57:50] saints, we have to get a breakthrough in
[57:52] a way that God could deliver us
[57:54] completely from this spirit of envy and
[57:56] jealousy and malice and strife. And if
[57:59] somebody want to take your place, nobody
[58:01] want to take your place. Nobody could
[58:02] take your place. Praise God. What God
[58:04] have for you is for you. Nobody could
[58:06] change that. Nobody could cancel that.
[58:09] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. But
[58:11] the things of God is the faith.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; That is the challenge. The things of
[58:15] God, not feelings. And there are too
[58:17] many people put their feelings and
[58:19] emotions over faith and revelation.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is a stumbling.
[58:23] When you put your feelings over faith,
[58:26] &gt;&gt; God never put feelings over faith and
[58:28] emotions and you, you know, your thing
[58:30] and you're weary and you're tired. No,
[58:31] no, no. You must press on.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Press on to believe that God
[58:36] will speak to your heart and God will
[58:38] deliver you. So, you love him this
[58:39] morning.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. So,
[58:43] I spoke on Friday about this city of
[58:47] refuge.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; And I believe it's something very
[58:49] important
[58:50] &gt;&gt; that God was trying to point to he that
[58:51] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[58:52] high. And God wants us in that position
[58:55] because in that place you at rest. In
[58:57] that place, nobody could trigger you
[58:59] when you're in the right place.
[59:01] Hallelujah. Because demons coming to
[59:03] trigger you, to get you upset, to get
[59:05] you out of tune. That is what that man,
[59:07] that maniac man coming to brother
[59:08] Brandham and say, "You snake in the
[59:10] grass. I'll beat you up." And everything
[59:11] else. He was trying to trigger brother
[59:13] Brandham out of the atmosphere. And
[59:15] brother Ram kept the atmosphere.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; And in that atmosphere, the devil was
[59:19] defeated.
[59:20] So once you break into the atmosphere,
[59:22] you have to keep the atmosphere that the
[59:24] devil will trigger you out of the
[59:26] atmosphere. Sometime the devil could
[59:28] could use your children to trigger you,
[59:30] your wife to trigger you, your husband
[59:32] to trigger you, your neighbor, your
[59:33] boss, somebody to trigger you and you
[59:35] get upset and you just throw out the
[59:37] atmosphere and then you cannot pull it
[59:39] back together again. Oh, blessed be the
[59:41] name of the Lord. But God is good.
[59:43] Praise God. God going to give us a
[59:45] breakthrough. I believe with all my
[59:47] heart. Praise God. So it was wonderful
[59:49] to go and and hear the inspiration. I'll
[59:52] tell you more about Germany and France,
[59:53] but but for for for NWI, I didn't really
[59:56] know exactly what the inspiration was,
[59:57] but then when I heard about it, I know
[59:59] exactly that is what what the Lord
[1:00:01] wanted me to do and what the Lord wanted
[1:00:03] me to share. So I preached on a on a
[1:00:05] song of compassion and also on to a
[1:00:08] brotherly kindness charity because that
[1:00:10] is where we are ending up to go to
[1:00:12] charity.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; In Lagos, Nigeria, I preach on a message
[1:00:16] rooted and grounded. I didn't say in the
[1:00:18] love of God. It's part of it in the love
[1:00:20] of God. But I wanted to get rooted and
[1:00:21] grounded because some people rooted and
[1:00:23] grounded in foolishness, in false
[1:00:24] doctrine and false teaching. You can't
[1:00:26] get them out from it. But the bride will
[1:00:27] be rooted and grounded in love.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; So we have an opportunity and I was
[1:00:32] sharing the difference between rooted
[1:00:33] and grounded is there two different
[1:00:35] Greek words and one the root the rooted
[1:00:38] part is where you draw your source from
[1:00:39] where you get your energy from, where
[1:00:41] the roots get the water from to grow and
[1:00:43] to mature and so on. And the grounded
[1:00:45] part speaks of foundation, speaks of a
[1:00:47] building that you have to be built like
[1:00:49] a rock. So I was telling them that the
[1:00:51] the lighthouse don't argue with the
[1:00:53] storm. The lighthouse don't argue with
[1:00:55] the wind and the darkness. The
[1:00:56] lighthouse just standing there. And
[1:00:58] standing is not passive. Hallelujah.
[1:01:01] Standing is not passive. That lighthouse
[1:01:03] just shed shine light to sailors and to
[1:01:05] other ships. And that's how God want
[1:01:07] you. Like a rock, like a lighthouse.
[1:01:09] Wherever God put you, you have to be
[1:01:11] anchored. You have to be rooted. Nothing
[1:01:13] can sway you to the left and sway you to
[1:01:15] the right. Oh, blessed be the name of
[1:01:17] the Lord. You're anchored in God. You're
[1:01:19] anchored in Jesus Christ. That is how
[1:01:21] God wanted you. Oh, praise God.
[1:01:23] Hallelujah. And my inspiration was to
[1:01:25] hold the line. And the hold the line
[1:01:27] means don't get the devil an inch. And
[1:01:29] we talk about Shama. One of David's
[1:01:31] mighty men was in the middle of a lentil
[1:01:33] field and the enemy came to attack him.
[1:01:35] And all the people ran away from him.
[1:01:37] But he stood his ground. HE STOOD ONE
[1:01:39] man named Shama. He stood alone and he
[1:01:42] fight the enemy. They're not going to
[1:01:44] take his lentil field. Oh, give the Lord
[1:01:46] some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:01:49] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE
[1:01:52] YOUR FIELD. You have to stand and fight.
[1:01:54] If you don't fight if you run, in other
[1:01:55] words, standing means you're not
[1:01:57] running.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; You're not backing down. You're not
[1:01:59] giving up. You're not letting go. You
[1:02:01] can't win if you run. Oh, glory. You
[1:02:04] can't win if you back down. YOU CAN'T
[1:02:05] WIN IF YOU GIVE UP. OH, glory to God.
[1:02:08] Having all stand. You have to stand.
[1:02:10] PRAISE GOD. AFTER THE ENEMY COME AND
[1:02:12] ATTACK, you have to stand. And when the
[1:02:13] ENEMY IS GREATER THAN YOU, WE HAVE TO
[1:02:15] HOLD THE LINE. PRAISE GOD. AND NOW HOLD
[1:02:18] STEADY. HOLD YOUR DEFENSIVE POSITION.
[1:02:21] GO. DON'T GIVE HIM MY INCH. BUT GIVE THE
[1:02:23] LORD A SHOUT. NOT GOING TO GIVE him my
[1:02:25] inch. Praise God. CALL ME TO THIS
[1:02:28] MESSAGE. GOD CALL ME IN THIS HOUR. God
[1:02:30] call ME TO OVERCOME. GOD CALL ME TO
[1:02:33] STAND. GLORY. CALL ME TO BACKSLIDE AND
[1:02:35] GIVE UP AND LET GO AND GO BACK IN THE
[1:02:37] WORLD. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE
[1:02:39] HOUSE. GOD CALLED US FOR A PURPOSE AND
[1:02:42] THAT PURPOSE MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:02:47] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. OH, blessed be
[1:02:50] the name of the Lord.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Just tell them the enemy want to break
[1:02:53] you. That's the object of the enemy. To
[1:02:55] break your spirit, to break your will.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what the enemy does.
[1:02:59] That's his job to frustrate you, to
[1:03:01] depress you, to make sure. That's why
[1:03:03] people go to the devil because they find
[1:03:04] God taking too long
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; because faith that can't be tested can't
[1:03:08] be trusted. When God released faith to
[1:03:10] you, he have to test it. He tested Abram
[1:03:12] for 25 years. He tested Noah for 120
[1:03:14] years. He says he met people in the
[1:03:16] upper room for so many days. He once he
[1:03:19] give you faith, he have to test it.
[1:03:21] That's what he does. That's how he
[1:03:22] operates.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some shouts in the
[1:03:25] house.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We said before and he
[1:03:29] preached on it. He God didn't argue with
[1:03:31] the darkness. He didn't discuss NO
[1:03:33] DISCUSSION ON FELLOWSHIP WITH THE
[1:03:35] DARKNESS. HE WATCHED darkness and said
[1:03:37] let there be light. Oh glory to God. And
[1:03:39] when light come for darkness WILL PACK
[1:03:41] UP SHOP and go home. OH GIVE THE LORD A
[1:03:44] SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. WHEN LIGHT COMES
[1:03:46] DARKNESS HAVE TO PACK UP SHOP. AND
[1:03:48] LISTEN WHEN LIGHT COME TO YOUR HOME
[1:03:50] DARKNESS IN YOUR HOME HAVE TO PACK UP
[1:03:52] AND LEAVE.
[1:03:55] Oh give the Lord some praises.
[1:03:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:03:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So we are
[1:04:01] striving to enter in. We are striving.
[1:04:03] We have to strive.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; We have to strive to enter in. Baram
[1:04:06] said before the horrible plague strike.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; America preparing for war for Venez
[1:04:10] Venezuela war. And just in 72 hours had
[1:04:13] five volcanoes that erupted. The earth
[1:04:16] is starting to shake. You know,
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; the earth is starting to grown. You
[1:04:19] know, things are happening. You know,
[1:04:20] because we are about to be redeemed.
[1:04:22] Full redemption. Not just the soul, not
[1:04:24] just the Amen. the spirit but the body
[1:04:26] and all going to be changed and
[1:04:28] transformed. So we are looking to see
[1:04:30] what the Lord will do. Are you going a
[1:04:32] great expectation?
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; People go to church just to get
[1:04:35] information but you come into church to
[1:04:36] get revelation. That's why you have to
[1:04:38] come into the spirit. Revelation is when
[1:04:40] he reveals himself to you and that's the
[1:04:42] rock that Jesus talked about. Upon this
[1:04:45] rock I'll build my church. That is when
[1:04:47] it's revealed to you. Oh blessed be the
[1:04:50] name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:04:52] Hallelujah. Oh God is good this morning.
[1:04:55] Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:04:57] Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The
[1:05:00] man that build his house upon the sand,
[1:05:01] he doesn't know the storm is coming. He
[1:05:03] does the catering for the storm. As far
[1:05:05] as he concerning, he getting more
[1:05:06] bricks. He getting more paint. He
[1:05:08] preparing for Christmas. But the storm
[1:05:10] is coming.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He have his hallelujah. He
[1:05:13] have his um all the mobby and all the
[1:05:16] Amen. the sorrel and all the cake and
[1:05:17] everything else. But the storm is coming
[1:05:19] because he didn't build it upon a rock.
[1:05:21] Nobody but anybody else, you know, build
[1:05:23] your house upon a rock. That rock is
[1:05:25] revelation. Oh, glory to God. The trials
[1:05:28] is still yet ahead. And forget what
[1:05:29] you're going through right now. That is
[1:05:31] nothing compared to what is coming
[1:05:32] ahead. There's a great being, a strain
[1:05:34] that is coming. And you have to have
[1:05:36] what it takes to deal with what is
[1:05:38] coming. That's why I point you to what
[1:05:40] is coming. And not only trial coming and
[1:05:42] testing coming, but power coming also.
[1:05:44] Oh, give the Lord a shout. God will not
[1:05:46] leave you comfortless. God will not
[1:05:48] leave you defeated. God will not leave
[1:05:50] you without the uncction to function.
[1:05:52] God will not LEAVE YOU THE POWER TO
[1:05:54] WITNESS THAT HE'S THE SAME yesterday and
[1:05:56] ever. It has to have power over
[1:05:57] sickness, over disease, over cancer,
[1:05:59] over tumor, OVER ALL MANNER OF
[1:06:02] SICKNESSES AND DISEASES. OH, GLORY TO
[1:06:04] GOD. HALLELUJAH. You cannot tell me the
[1:06:08] book is now on the earth, the open book.
[1:06:10] AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF REDEMPTION.
[1:06:12] THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL.
[1:06:14] GOD IS SUPERNATURAL. WE ARE
[1:06:16] SUPERNATURAL. OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME
[1:06:18] PRAISES. AND THE HOLY GHOST IS
[1:06:20] SUPERNATURAL. WHEREVER GOD IS, THERE IS
[1:06:22] A SUPERNATURAL RIGHT NOW. SOMETHING
[1:06:24] SUPERNATURAL IS TAKING PLACE.
[1:06:30] [applause]
[1:06:30] [cheering]
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:33] You have to stand for your family. You
[1:06:35] have to stand for your loved ones. You
[1:06:37] have to stand when they don't believe,
[1:06:38] when they don't accept, when they don't
[1:06:39] want to follow. You have to see all of
[1:06:41] that and don't be and call that as
[1:06:43] nothing
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; because you are believing God. You're
[1:06:45] not seeing the mini skirt, the hot
[1:06:47] pants. You're not seeing they're smoking
[1:06:48] marijuana or they're on drugs. You're
[1:06:50] not seeing that. You're seeing what God
[1:06:51] have said. Oh, glory to God. That God
[1:06:54] going to give you your family. That God
[1:06:55] going to deliver them. That God going to
[1:06:57] send the blood hung of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:59] after them. Oh, glory to God.
[1:07:01] Hallelujah. You have to believe that.
[1:07:04] Hallelujah. Because the devil standing
[1:07:05] in them defying you and YOU HAVE TO DEFY
[1:07:07] that devil right back. Oh, give the Lord
[1:07:09] some praises. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT BACK. I
[1:07:12] look how old you are. Oh, your prayer
[1:07:14] means something. Oh, glory Lord. Grandma
[1:07:16] prayer means something. You don't even
[1:07:18] know why you are here this morning. Some
[1:07:20] grandmother prayed for you. She must be
[1:07:22] dead and gone, BUT HER PRAYERS WENT UP
[1:07:24] TO GOD AND GOD HEARD HER PRAYER AND GOD
[1:07:27] HEARD HER CRY. DON'T JUST WATCH THEM

[1:07:48] TROUBLE ON HIS HAND. WE ARE STANDING
[1:07:50] ANYHOW. WE ARE STANDING UPON A
[1:07:52] [screaming] ROCK. OH, GIVE THE LORD A
[1:07:54] SHOUT.
[1:07:57] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I had to fight.
[1:08:01] Hallelujah. Fight against spirit. Fight
[1:08:04] against church spirit. Praise the word.

[1:08:17] you repent go forgive you
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; next call and repent
[1:08:22] cuz I wasn't going for five people I was
[1:08:24] going because God sent me to go
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going because God let me go I don't
[1:08:29] care if it's two people five people
[1:08:30] doesn't matter
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; numbers never bother me you know what I
[1:08:34] am concerned I'm consumed with is what
[1:08:36] God wants me to do
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; and I want to be in the will of God, the
[1:08:40] mind of God. I am not a politician. I'm
[1:08:42] not into politics. So, you wouldn't
[1:08:44] catch me into church politics stuff,
[1:08:46] doing things because the people want it
[1:08:47] so and they want it so. I'm not into
[1:08:48] that. I have never been to the politics.
[1:08:50] I'm not going to be a political
[1:08:52] minister. Some of them should be in
[1:08:53] parliament. Some of them will be in my
[1:08:55] pulpit. They shouldn't be in the pulpit.
[1:08:56] They should be in parliament. They
[1:08:57] should be in them government offices and
[1:08:58] so, but I'm not called for that.

[1:09:02] gospel and to see who have faith to take
[1:09:04] it. That's the purpose that we here for
[1:09:07] to preach the gospel and see who have
[1:09:09] faith to take it. Not to baby and pat
[1:09:12] and get Kentucky fi chicken and give you
[1:09:14] some free Bible. We not here for that.
[1:09:16] Hallelujah. This is not Amen. Praise
[1:09:18] God. This is a different thing all
[1:09:19] together. This is end time warriors.
[1:09:21] This is special forces that God put in
[1:09:24] the last days. THIS IS MEN WHO HAVE TO
[1:09:26] KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM, WHO THEY ARE,
[1:09:28] AND WHAT THEY BELIEVE AND WHAT THEY
[1:09:30] STANDING FOR AND THE MISSION. OH, GIVE
[1:09:33] THE LORD A SHOUT.
[1:09:35] AMEN. BROTHER BLACK MAN. HALLELUJAH.

[1:09:52] GOD. I BECOME A SICK SPIRIT. HOW MUCH
[1:09:54] FILTH, HOW MUCH WHATEVER THE DEVIL HAVE
[1:09:56] TO LOOSE ON THE EARTH. NOTHING GOING TO
[1:09:58] STOP THIS BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT GOD HAS
[1:10:00] CALLED. JOEL SAW IT. A MIGHTY ARMY. OH,
[1:10:03] GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. JOY CALL IT A
[1:10:06] MIGHTY ARMY. THE EZEKIEL, THE PEOPLE
[1:10:08] THAT KNOW THEIR GOD SHALL BE STRONG.
[1:10:11] SO DANIEL said and do great exploits.
[1:10:16] Hallelujah.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; You think God didn't know have all that
[1:10:23] pornography and all them sex spirit and
[1:10:26] all the internet. You think God didn't
[1:10:27] know had all of that. And with ALL OF
[1:10:29] THAT, HE STILL PUSH YOU HERE.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; If if he knew you couldn't handle it, he
[1:10:35] could have put in horse on buggy edge.
[1:10:37] It had no internet. You had to take your
[1:10:38] horse and spend four, five, six hours
[1:10:40] coming to church. But God put you here
[1:10:42] because God KNOW HE GOING TO HAVE SOME
[1:10:44] WARRIORS, NOT WARRIORS.
[1:10:48] BARRIERS. BARRIERS OF THE FAITH.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; And Job and Job prove it when his wife
[1:10:57] say, "Why the curse God and dead?" And
[1:10:59] that way the devil say and and the devil
[1:11:01] asked God um give him a crack at him and
[1:11:03] make him curse you.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; See that what the devil want to do?
[1:11:06] Strip you
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; and God was saying not that man
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; that man is a powerful man. That is that
[1:11:12] is my man on the earth. God had to call
[1:11:14] the angels to to identify who Job is and
[1:11:17] say that man that man different all
[1:11:18] together. Hallelujah. I'm going to bless
[1:11:21] that man. Isn't that wonderful? Isn't
[1:11:23] that SOMETHING THIS MORNING? HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. And God
[1:11:28] came and do a powerful work upon Job's
[1:11:30] life. You see, he still had self there.
[1:11:32] He still had flesh there. And when we
[1:11:35] have self and flesh, God have to do
[1:11:36] something
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; to get it out. Moses had a hot temper
[1:11:40] wife. There's a purpose behind that. We
[1:11:43] have situations around us. There's a
[1:11:44] purpose behind that. You can't come and
[1:11:46] curse God because this happened that
[1:11:48] happened. You have to ask yourself every
[1:11:50] situation have the mind of God
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; and you want to catch God's mind for
[1:11:56] your particular situation.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; You don't know what God trying to work
[1:11:59] out because every trial to us is
[1:12:01] customized because what what will what
[1:12:04] would trigger you would not trigger
[1:12:05] somebody else and God know and the enemy
[1:12:07] knows the devil no fool.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; If you know you don't like cake you're
[1:12:13] bringing cake and temptation.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. He idling. He know you
[1:12:19] don't like sweets. The devil bringing
[1:12:21] nothing sweet to you. He know exactly
[1:12:23] what your taste buds like. And that is
[1:12:25] what he GOING TO BRING.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:12:27] And power is demonstrated by not what we
[1:12:30] could do but when we could do and we
[1:12:31] don't.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Character is reflected by how we treat
[1:12:38] those who can't do nothing for us.
[1:12:46] A lot of people like to act and do
[1:12:48] things because somebody could do back
[1:12:49] for them. But when you could do and the
[1:12:51] person can't do anything. So that's why
[1:12:53] the message that was brought to mind
[1:12:55] that was so powerful.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Gideon brought it out about
[1:12:58] how Jesus told that young man, sell all
[1:13:01] that you have and give to the poor and
[1:13:04] follow me.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; It's not that Jesus wanted him poor. He
[1:13:08] wanted to get rid of that selfish demon
[1:13:10] that was upon him that disallowed him
[1:13:13] that wasn't allowing him to freely share
[1:13:15] what he had. He was rich.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Bible said Jesus loved him and he walk
[1:13:19] away sad. And this is where you do have
[1:13:22] to be rich in money now.
[1:13:25] You can be rich in pride.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; There's some people very very proud.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; They you have a a bank of pride. You
[1:13:32] could be rich in lust. You could rich in
[1:13:34] your own desire and ambition. You could
[1:13:36] be rich in many many things. It doesn't
[1:13:38] have to be like money. You could be rich
[1:13:40] in a lot of other things, but you have
[1:13:42] to sell.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; You have to let go and you have to give
[1:13:45] up. And many people don't want to get in
[1:13:48] that mode of letting go and giving up
[1:13:52] because you see, you're asking yourself,
[1:13:54] should I give this up? But I'll close
[1:13:56] with this.
[1:13:58] The city of refuge, God set it up that
[1:14:00] way that if you kill somebody by
[1:14:02] accident, you could run. Because in
[1:14:03] those eye for eye, tooth for tooth. So
[1:14:06] if you kill somebody, their family could
[1:14:07] kill you
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; and that's not a problem because in
[1:14:10] those days was eye for eye and tooth for
[1:14:12] tooth. Isn't that right? But God set up
[1:14:15] something called the city of refuge
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; that if you you know you do something
[1:14:20] and the cut glass slip out your hand and
[1:14:21] cut your neighbor and kill your neighbor
[1:14:23] and whatnot and you know you didn't do
[1:14:24] it willfully, you could run
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; run to the city and tell the LS I didn't
[1:14:28] do it. I really didn't mean to do it.
[1:14:29] And they will take you in
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; and your pursuers couldn't come into the
[1:14:33] city
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; and they will hear your case. So God put
[1:14:36] provisions for justice
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; and for mercy and for understanding and
[1:14:41] for bring clarity upon the issues of
[1:14:44] life.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God himself set that up.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Could we give the Lord a shout in the
[1:14:53] house?
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; But as the prophet said, when you get
[1:14:57] into that city, you can't complain.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; You want air condition, you want ice
[1:15:01] cream, you want cake, you want pizza
[1:15:03] from Pizza Hut.
[1:15:05] You have to be study. You was dying. You
[1:15:08] was going to get killed. Stay put.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Do what you have to do.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise his wonderful name.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:25] Do what you have to do. That's what we
[1:15:28] here for. to serve God, to praise God,
[1:15:30] to worship, to contribute or to work of
[1:15:33] the Lord. You are part of this church.
[1:15:35] You're a part of this church. Find out
[1:15:36] what we need to get done and put your
[1:15:38] shoulder to the wheel.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; You don't want to be a spectator. You
[1:15:41] want to be a participator.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Particip Participation is what is
[1:15:45] important. That is what make us as a
[1:15:47] church community. That make us as a as a
[1:15:49] group that God could come down and use
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; for his honor and glory. There are no
[1:15:54] one man show here. Have no man with the
[1:15:56] S on his chest.
[1:15:57] Oh give the Lord a sh superman is that
[1:15:59] are here we all have a part to play just
[1:16:02] like your body have a part to play you
[1:16:04] have a nose you have eyes you have mouth

[1:16:07] entire body you want you know where your
[1:16:09] hand go away your head feel they turn

[1:16:13] front you want to go behind now
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; the eyes going wild
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; you don't want that you want everything
[1:16:20] in place and this is what we want how we
[1:16:22] want the church
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; things to come into place
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; so you are going to find a lot of
[1:16:27] changes begin to unfold as we try to
[1:16:29] close the gap
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; on issues and challenges that we have
[1:16:32] inside of here. We have gaps. That's no
[1:16:36] that is no problem to and I am not
[1:16:38] ashame to confess that we have gaps. We
[1:16:40] have spaces but we're going to close
[1:16:41] them.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; So we're going to close the gaps.
[1:16:45] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WHY? BECAUSE
[1:16:47] that church have to come into order.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; That's what you have to fight for.
[1:16:54] Not you coming as an individual and know
[1:16:56] you want to see a church set in order
[1:16:58] because the prophet said when the church
[1:16:59] is set in order not even sin could stay
[1:17:02] inside of it and no sickness could stay
[1:17:05] inside of there because the sick will be
[1:17:07] healed. The blind will see the deaf will
[1:17:10] hear. THE DUMB WILL SPEAK because we
[1:17:12] have a church set in order. The devil
[1:17:14] can't move.
[1:17:16] OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT BECAUSE WE
[1:17:18] HAVE A CHURCH SET IN ORDER. NO ISMS, no
[1:17:20] schisms, no conflict in the body.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this morning?
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:17:29] Hallelujah.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; So, you see, you're going to see a lot
[1:17:35] of changes.
[1:17:37] You're going to see some different
[1:17:38] operations because we cannot continue as
[1:17:40] we are.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Only God could bless us in the condition
[1:17:43] we in much as if we set things in order
[1:17:46] and getting right. And God has blessed
[1:17:47] us tremendously above that we could even
[1:17:50] ask or think. And especially those of us
[1:17:53] who came from way back in Kyal to see
[1:17:55] where God has brought us to now. It is
[1:17:57] just amazing.
[1:17:59] It's just mindboggling and mind-blowing.
[1:18:01] There's no way in my wildest dreams I
[1:18:03] could have imagined that the blessings
[1:18:05] on the hand of God. And I tell my wife,
[1:18:07] I said, I just thank God to for giving
[1:18:10] me the opportunity to give my life to
[1:18:12] him at age 17. And I have absolutely no
[1:18:15] regret. And I want to encourage you to
[1:18:18] encourage the young people to come out
[1:18:19] next Sunday. It will be a very important
[1:18:21] service uh especially for the youth and
[1:18:24] we want even the youth talk to
[1:18:25] backsliders to come out. Come out and
[1:18:27] give support everybody. We want them you
[1:18:29] to be here special service next Sunday.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're looking to see God bring a
[1:18:33] great deliverance and bring
[1:18:35] breakthrough. Bring your friends. Bring
[1:18:37] your family. Testify to somebody.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Devil could get somebody but he can't
[1:18:40] get all.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; He can't get those names written on the
[1:18:44] Lamb's book of life. HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:46] HALLELUJAH.

[1:18:49] backs friends. Call people who used to

[1:18:55] Tell them how they're coming to service
[1:18:56] next Sunday. That's a good one. Don't
[1:18:58] just invite them. Tell how you're
[1:19:00] coming.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; And they say, "Well, we don't know
[1:19:03] except we're coming to pick you up.
[1:19:05] We're coming to travel with you."
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Stick them.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Let me go further than that. Compel
[1:19:11] them.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible said. They got the
[1:19:14] invitation to turn it down, but some you
[1:19:16] compel THEM COME. THE BANQUET TABLE IS
[1:19:18] still full. PRAISE GOD. BRING THE HALT.

[1:22:58] the Lord.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's all stand. We're going to
[1:23:11] switch to the brotherly kindness. Praise
[1:23:13] God.
[1:23:23] Hallelujah.
[1:23:52] the officers, the helps and the
[1:23:55] governments. You know, it is it is
[1:23:58] impossible to do anything without the
[1:24:01] right support. So, we acknowledge the
[1:24:02] support and the hours and the labor that
[1:24:05] goes behind the scenes to make things
[1:24:07] possible. So I greet you this morning on
[1:24:09] behalf of my pastor but Theoid and the
[1:24:11] Headstone Tabernacle. We salute you. We
[1:24:14] are happy to be here and to see how God
[1:24:16] has been blessing and using you. And uh
[1:24:18] on behalf of the believers who are here
[1:24:20] with us by the grace of God, we are
[1:24:22] happy to be identified with you. So can
[1:24:24] we put our hands together one more time?
[1:24:27] [applause]
[1:24:32] you know, I saw brother Marcus try to
[1:24:35] put me in a whole different age bracket.
[1:24:40] So, I I forgive you,
[1:24:43] you know. So, I I try to be still on I'm
[1:24:45] I'm still young, you know. I still on
[1:24:47] the younger side and by the grace of
[1:24:48] God, um the only thing I've said in the
[1:24:50] past and I heard brother George used it
[1:24:52] recently, I preach to my height. You
[1:24:54] know, I'm standing behind this desk and
[1:24:55] I'm not too much of a tall preacher and
[1:24:57] I'm not a long preacher, but by the
[1:24:59] grace of God, we believe that this
[1:25:01] message is a powerful message. And we
[1:25:03] believe we are coming into a season for
[1:25:05] a quick short message that'll shake the
[1:25:07] whole nation. This message is powerful.
[1:25:10] There's power in this message to break
[1:25:12] chains, to break shackles, to send
[1:25:14] demons running. There's power in this
[1:25:17] message to bring back your children to
[1:25:19] church. There's power in this message to
[1:25:22] open your understanding to the word.
[1:25:24] There's power in this message to take
[1:25:25] the sinner and get them to come to know
[1:25:28] Jesus in the power of his resurrection.
[1:25:30] There's power in this message. It's a
[1:25:32] powerful message.
[1:25:35] And you know, many many have walked
[1:25:37] away. But God will always have a
[1:25:39] representative. God will always have a
[1:25:41] witness. It doesn't matter who walks
[1:25:43] away. It doesn't matter who criticizes.
[1:25:45] It doesn't matter who doesn't believe.
[1:25:47] If your name is on the book, there's no
[1:25:48] devil in hell. There's no devil on the
[1:25:51] earth that could stop you from coming
[1:25:53] into your inheritance.
[1:25:57] [applause] Can the church say amen?
[1:26:00] So, I'm excited this morning to see what
[1:26:03] God is going to do. So, if you have your
[1:26:05] Bibles, would you turn with me? We're
[1:26:07] going to read from uh one portion of
[1:26:09] scripture for now. Uh second Peter 1,
[1:26:13] reading from verse one, a very familiar
[1:26:15] scripture. And by the grace of God, we
[1:26:17] are looking for God to s to do something
[1:26:20] tremendous in our midst. So, second
[1:26:22] Peter 1 and reading from verse one.
[1:26:28] Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of
[1:26:31] Jesus Christ. To them that have obtained
[1:26:33] like precious faith with us through the
[1:26:35] righteousness of God and our savior
[1:26:38] Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be
[1:26:41] multiplied unto you through the
[1:26:43] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[1:26:45] According as his divine power hath given
[1:26:49] us given unto us all things that pertain
[1:26:52] unto life and godliness through the
[1:26:54] knowledge of him that had called us to
[1:26:56] glory and virtue.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. whereby are given unto us
[1:26:59] exceeding great and precious promises,
[1:27:02] that by these ye might be partakers of
[1:27:04] the divine nature, having escaped the
[1:27:07] corruption that is in the world through
[1:27:08] lust. And beside this, giving all
[1:27:11] diligence, add to your faith virtue, and
[1:27:13] to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge,
[1:27:15] temperance, and to temperance patience,
[1:27:17] and to patience godliness, and to
[1:27:19] godliness brotherly kindness, and to
[1:27:21] brotherly kindness charity. For if these
[1:27:24] things be in you and abound, it's not
[1:27:26] just be in you, it must abound. They
[1:27:29] make you that he shall neither be barren
[1:27:31] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[1:27:34] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; But he that lackth these things is
[1:27:38] blind,
[1:27:39] and cannot see a far off, and hath
[1:27:42] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:27:44] old sins. Wherefore, though rather,
[1:27:47] brethren, give diligence to make your
[1:27:49] calling and election sure. For if you do
[1:27:52] these things, ye shall never fall. So
[1:27:55] there's a place where you could never
[1:27:56] fall. That's a powerful statement. But
[1:27:58] the Brandham said, a man could live such
[1:28:00] a life that the devil don't even know
[1:28:02] what to do with you.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; He push you this way, you still stand.
[1:28:05] He push you this way, you still stand.
[1:28:06] And that's what we talking about.
[1:28:08] Reaching a point that you could never
[1:28:09] fall until the devil say, you know what?
[1:28:11] I'm not coming by your house anymore.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; The last time I come, you're still
[1:28:15] standing.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; I mess up your house situation, you're
[1:28:17] still standing. If you do these things,
[1:28:20] you will NEVER FALL.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER I TRIED TO DO TO YOU, YOU'RE
[1:28:23] STILL STANDING.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL THOUGHT HE HAD YOU 10 YEARS
[1:28:25] AGO, AND HERE YOU ARE THIS MORNING. HE
[1:28:28] THOUGHT HE HAD YOU 5 YEARS AGO, BUT HERE
[1:28:29] YOU ARE THIS MORNING, AND YOU'RE STILL
[1:28:31] STANDING. And nothing is going to stop
[1:28:33] that. Can the church say amen?
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Verse 11, for so an entrance shall be
[1:28:38] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[1:28:41] everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
[1:28:43] Savior Jesus Christ. Wherefore I will
[1:28:46] not be negligent to put you always in
[1:28:49] remembrance of these things. So I want
[1:28:51] you to note that he say I will not be
[1:28:53] negligent
[1:28:55] to put you always in remembrance of
[1:28:57] these things though you know them and be
[1:29:00] established in the present truth. Yay, I
[1:29:03] think it meat or I think it fit as long
[1:29:05] as I am in this tabernacle or in this
[1:29:07] body to stir you up by putting you in
[1:29:10] remembrance, knowing that shortly I must
[1:29:13] put off this my tabernacle, even as our
[1:29:15] Lord Jesus Christ had showed me.
[1:29:17] Moreover, I will endeavor that ye may be
[1:29:20] able after my deceased to have these
[1:29:22] things always in remembrance. May the
[1:29:24] Lord add a blessing to the reading of
[1:29:26] his word. Shall we bow our heads for a
[1:29:28] word of prayer? Our gracious heavenly
[1:29:30] father, we thank you for your grace, for
[1:29:32] your love, for your mercy, for your
[1:29:33] presence, for your word, Lord, that is
[1:29:35] real and alive to us, Father. Any man
[1:29:37] could, Lord, read the sacred scriptures,
[1:29:40] but it takes the Holy Spirit to breathe
[1:29:42] life upon it and to make it a present
[1:29:44] tense reality. Father, we thank you for
[1:29:46] your word. We thank you for this
[1:29:47] message. We thank you for this church.
[1:29:49] We thank you for this fellowship. We
[1:29:50] thank you for the pastor of this house,
[1:29:52] Lord, his wife, his family, and the
[1:29:54] officers and the helps and the
[1:29:56] governments. And Lord, for the few
[1:29:58] minutes, Lord, of encouraging and having
[1:30:00] a conversation around your word, may you
[1:30:02] take me out of the way. And may you
[1:30:04] speak lip to ear to your children. May
[1:30:06] we fellowship around the feast that you
[1:30:08] have prepared for us, Father. Lord, in
[1:30:10] this great inspiration of the breaking
[1:30:12] of the bread, Father. May you have the
[1:30:14] preeminence in the service. May you take
[1:30:16] me out of the way, Lord. May my words,
[1:30:18] Lord, and my thoughts, Lord, Lord, fall
[1:30:20] apart. And may only what you once said
[1:30:23] be said. Only what you want done be
[1:30:25] done. and we commit this service into
[1:30:26] your hands. May you bless the reading of
[1:30:28] the word, bless the hearing of it. We
[1:30:30] ask in the precious name of Jesus
[1:30:31] Christ. And the church says,
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen." You may be seated in
[1:30:36] the presence of the Lord. And it's
[1:30:38] certainly wonderful. And uh for a title
[1:30:42] this morning,
[1:30:44] remembering the Lord.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Remembering the Lord, that's the title
[1:30:49] this morning. And we saw here in the
[1:30:51] scripture we read there were three times
[1:30:54] here that there was mention about
[1:30:56] remembering. I will not be negligent to
[1:30:58] put you always in remembrance of these
[1:31:01] things. So he was seeing here Peter that
[1:31:04] it is my business to remind you.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say though you
[1:31:09] know them
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; but to be established in the present
[1:31:12] truth.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; So I'm just here this morning to remind
[1:31:15] us. Yes,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; it's just a service of reminding you
[1:31:18] about remembering the Lord because it's
[1:31:19] sometime it's easy to forget.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; It's easy to forget where we come from.
[1:31:23] It's easy to forget the grace of God in
[1:31:25] our lives. Sometimes the cares of life
[1:31:28] you go back to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years
[1:31:30] ago and some people talk about the
[1:31:32] harder days and the tougher days and now
[1:31:34] we in the days of microwave and
[1:31:36] convenience and all these things and it
[1:31:38] seems as if the life could for some is a
[1:31:40] bit easier. you have money to go by the
[1:31:42] doctor. But when you go back in the old
[1:31:43] days when you had no money for the
[1:31:45] doctor, you had to depend on the grace
[1:31:46] of God. And through scripture, we see
[1:31:49] over and over that God HAD TO REMIND
[1:31:51] THEM THAT I WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK YOU
[1:31:53] OUT. I WAS THE ONE WHO CALLED YOU. I AM
[1:31:56] THE ONE WHO SENT THE PROPHET TO YOU. I'M
[1:31:59] THE ONE WHO DELIVERED YOU. YOU COULD
[1:32:01] PRAY, BUT IF GOD DOESN'T ANSWER THE
[1:32:02] PRAYER, YOU WILL STAY PRAYING. BUT HE'S
[1:32:04] THE ONE TO ANSWER.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; He's the one to restore.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; He's the ONE TO POUR OUT THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:32:10] HE IS THE ONE TO BREAK THE CHAINS.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; He's the one. Can the church say amen?
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; So I'm just going to build a foundation
[1:32:18] to get to a point to connect to brother
[1:32:21] Waldron's inspiration of breaking of the
[1:32:23] bread in Exodus 13 verse 13 verse uh
[1:32:29] 13:3 rather. And Moses said unto the
[1:32:31] people, remember this day in which you
[1:32:34] came out from Egypt out of the hand, out
[1:32:37] of the house of bondage, and for
[1:32:39] strength of hand, the Lord brought you
[1:32:41] out from this place.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; So Moses was constantly reminding the
[1:32:45] people, I don't want you to forget it.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to forget what God did.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Because you COULD GET SO COMFORTABLE
[1:32:51] THAT YOU FORGET WHY YOU'RE HERE.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; THERE ARE PEOPLE who come to church and
[1:32:55] they forget the Lord
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; because they see as the church and they
[1:32:58] don't see the Lord. Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me this morning?
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; MARY AND JOSEPH WENT TO CHURCH
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; and they left the service AND THEY
[1:33:07] DIDN'T REALIZE JESUS WAS NOT WITH THEM.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE SO CAUGHT UP IN THE TRADITION
[1:33:13] AND IN THE CEREMONY THAT THEY WENT FOR A
[1:33:15] FEW DAYS UNTIL SOMEBODY SAID, "WAIT A
[1:33:17] MINUTE. WHERE IS JESUS?"
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T REALIZE WHEN JESUS WENT
[1:33:20] MISSING.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THAT HE WAS NOT IN
[1:33:23] THE CAR WITH THEM.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T REALIZE HE WAS NOT IN THE
[1:33:25] HOME WITH THEM. AND THEN THEY HAD TO GO
[1:33:27] BACK TO FIND WHERE HE WAS WHEN THEY
[1:33:30] REMEMBERED HIM. AND WHEN THEY FOUND HIM,
[1:33:32] HE WAS THERE AMONG THE PRIESTS.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; HE WAS HAVING FELLOWSHIP.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; HE WAS BREAKING BREAD WITH THEM.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[1:33:39] DON'T YOU KNOW I MUST BE ABOUT MY
[1:33:41] FATHER'S BUSINESS?"
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE HERE THIS MORNING ON OUR
[1:33:44] FATHER'S BUSINESS.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN WE GO
[1:33:48] TO WORK. WE WANT TO REMEMBER THE LORD
[1:33:50] WHEN WE IN THE MAXI. WE WANT TO REMEMBER
[1:33:52] THE LORD WHEN WE IN THE TAXI. WE WANT TO
[1:33:54] REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN WE'RE IN THE
[1:33:55] MOUNTAIN TOP AND WE WANT TO REMEMBER HIM
[1:33:57] WHEN WE'RE IN THE VALLEY. WE WANT TO
[1:33:59] REMEMBER HIM WHEN WE FEEL GOOD AND WE
[1:34:01] WANT TO REMEMBER HIM WHEN WE DON'T FEEL
[1:34:03] GOOD. WE WANT TO REMEMBER HIM WHEN GOD
[1:34:05] ANSWERS PRAYER BUT WE WANT TO REMEMBER
[1:34:07] HIM WHEN GOD HOLDS UP THE ANSWER BECAUSE
[1:34:10] HE IS TESTING YOU AND HE IS trying you
[1:34:13] and he is proving you.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Somebody say amen.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:34:24] OVER AND OVER. WHY IS THIS?
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; And we're going to get to it.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Because the whole teaching on communion
[1:34:31] was do this in remembrance of me.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; There would be no REASON TO DO THINGS IN
[1:34:35] REMEMBRANCE IF YOU REMEMBERED.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE, IT'S
[1:34:41] EASY TO FORGET.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND YOU PICK UP THE
[1:34:45] PHONE AND YOU CALL YOUR NEIGHBOR, YOU
[1:34:46] CALL YOUR FRIEND, AND GOD SAY, "WHAT
[1:34:48] ABOUT ME?"
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; BUT THE MESSAGE THIS MORNING IS REMEMBER
[1:34:51] THE LORD. REMEMBER HIM IN YOUR CRISIS.
[1:34:55] REMEMBER HIM IN THE MOMENT WHEN IT LOOKS
[1:34:57] AS IF YOUR WORLD IS FALLING APART.
[1:34:59] REMEMBER HIM WHEN PEOPLE WALK AWAY.
[1:35:01] REMEMBER HIM WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
[1:35:02] CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN?
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; In numbers 15 and verse 37. Just
[1:35:09] building a foundation and testing the
[1:35:11] temperature.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; I like to test the temperature
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; because we come to the house of God to
[1:35:16] worship.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; We come to the house to receive. We come
[1:35:19] to THE HOUSE OF GOD BECAUSE WE WANT TO
[1:35:21] GET SOMETHING TO PUSH INTO A NEW WEEK.
[1:35:23] And you CAN'T GET ANYTHING IF YOU'RE
[1:35:25] CAUGHT UP IN A HUMANISTIC REALM. I'm not
[1:35:28] bringing anything you haven't HEARD
[1:35:29] BEFORE. EVERYTHING WE ARE SAYING THIS
[1:35:31] MORNING IS IN THE BIBLE AND IN THE
[1:35:32] PROPHET'S MESSAGE. BUT IT'S UP TO YOU TO
[1:35:34] KNOW IF YOU HAVE THE LORD ON YOUR DINNER
[1:35:37] TABLE, ON YOUR LUNCH TABLE, ON YOUR
[1:35:39] BREAKFAST TABLE. GO HAVE HIM IN YOUR
[1:35:41] GOING OUT, HAVE HIM IN YOUR COMING IN.
[1:35:43] CAN THE CHURCH say amen? Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; And the Lord spake unto Moses in Numbers
[1:35:48] 15,
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; saying, "Speak unto the children of
[1:35:51] Israel, and bid them that they make
[1:35:54] fringes in the borders of their garments
[1:35:56] throughout their generations, and that
[1:35:59] they put upon the fringes of the borders
[1:36:01] a ribbon of blue, and it shall be unto
[1:36:04] you for a fringe, that ye may look upon
[1:36:07] it, and remember all the commandments of
[1:36:09] the Lord."
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THIS WASN'T A RANDOM
[1:36:12] THING. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; THIS WAS A VERY DELIBERATE, INTENTIONAL
[1:36:16] THING SO THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR
[1:36:17] CLOTHES, YOU REMEMBER THE LORD.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; ANYBODY IN THE HOUSE THIS MORNING? SO
[1:36:23] YOUNG PEOPLE, GOD PUT THIS SO WHEN YOU
[1:36:25] LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHES, YOU REMEMBER
[1:36:26] YOU'RE A DAUGHTER OF THE KING.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; YOU REMEMBER YOU'RE A SON OF THE KING.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; CAN THE CHURCH say amen?
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; And remember all the commandments of the
[1:36:33] Lord and do them that you seek not after
[1:36:36] your own heart and your own eyes after
[1:36:39] which you used to go whoring. So here it
[1:36:41] is. God is saying to Moses, "GO TELL THE
[1:36:44] PEOPLE." FROM THE WAY YOU DRESS, SHOULD
[1:36:46] BE A REMINDER TO YOU OF WHO I AM.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU'RE EVER IN A SITUATION, YOU
[1:36:52] LOOK DOWN AND YOU SEE THE FRINGE, IT
[1:36:53] SHOULD REMIND YOU, I'M THE GOD THAT WOKE
[1:36:55] YOU UP THIS MORNING. I'M THE GOD WHO
[1:36:57] DELIVER YOU. I'M THE GOD WHO PROMISED TO
[1:37:00] GIVE YOU THE HOLY GHOST. I AM YOUR
[1:37:01] PROTECTOR. GREATER IS HE THAT'S in you
[1:37:04] than he that's in the world.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:37:10] This is why as a believer, brother and a
[1:37:13] sister, the way YOU CARRY YOURSELF
[1:37:15] SHOULD BE A TESTIMONY.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; When people should see you AND YOU SEE
[1:37:19] YOURSELF, IT SHOULD REMIND YOU THAT YOUR
[1:37:21] NAME IS ON THE BOOK.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; It should remind you that you are
[1:37:24] royalty.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; It should REMIND YOU YOU ARE PART OF A
[1:37:26] ROYAL PRIESTHOOD.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T JUST WAKE UP THIS MORNING.
[1:37:29] NO. GOD CALLED YOU HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE
[1:37:31] PART OF A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD. YOUR NAME IS
[1:37:34] WRITTEN AND IT CANNOT BE ERASED BECAUSE
[1:37:36] GOD LOVED YOU SO MUCH AND HE'S GOING TO
[1:37:39] MAKE SURE THAT ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER
[1:37:40] FOR GOOD TO THEM THAT LOVE GOD AND TO
[1:37:43] THEM WHO ARE THE CALLED ACCORDING TO HIS
[1:37:45] PURPOSE.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; In Deuter in Deuteronomy 5:15, I'm still
[1:37:54] building a foundation. And remember,
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; that thou was a servant,
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; in the land of Egypt,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; and the Lord thy God brought thee out
[1:38:03] then through a mighty hand, and by a
[1:38:06] stretch out hand. Therefore the Lord thy
[1:38:08] God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath
[1:38:10] day.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 8:2, "And thou shalt
[1:38:13] remember all the way which the Lord thy
[1:38:16] God led thee these 40 years in the
[1:38:18] wilderness."
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; I want you to remember it. Why? TO
[1:38:21] HUMBLE YOU.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; AND to prove thee. TO PROVE ME, TO TEST
[1:38:25] THEE,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; CAN THE CHURCH say amen? To know what
[1:38:28] WAS IN THINE HEART.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; WHETHER THOU WOULD KEEP HIS COMMANDMENT
[1:38:32] OR NO.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU SHARING THIS WITH ISAAC?
[1:38:35] BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE IS NOT FOR US TO
[1:38:37] TALK ABOUT ARGUMENT AND WHO BELIEVE
[1:38:39] THIS. IT'S TO PRODUCE A LIFE.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; AND THE LIFE IS A REMINDER THAT IF IT
[1:38:43] WASN'T FOR THE BLOOD, YOU WOULDN'T STAND
[1:38:44] A CHANCE.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; IF IT WASN'T FOR THE GRACE OF GOD, WE
[1:38:48] COULDN'T BE HERE THIS MORNING. IF IT
[1:38:50] WASN'T FOR THE MERCY OF GOD, YOU COULD
[1:38:52] NOT STAND ONE DAY. IF THE LORD MOVES HIS
[1:38:55] HAND, YOU FALL TO THE GROUND. [cheering]
[1:38:57] LISTEN, CHURCH, YOU ARE NOT KEEPING
[1:38:59] YOURSELF. BUT IT'S THE LORD.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; He's the one keeping you.
[1:39:04] [cheering and applause]
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; I shared with our church recently,
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; you could never, you parents in here,
[1:39:15] you could never love your children more
[1:39:16] than God loves them.
[1:39:18] Can I say that one more time?
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; You could never love your children MORE
[1:39:22] THAN GOD LOVES THEM
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS THE ONE WHO BROUGHT THEM
[1:39:26] ONTO THE EARTH. YOU ARE JUST A TRUSTEE
[1:39:28] FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT I
[1:39:30] GUARANTEE ONCE THEIR NAME IS ON THE
[1:39:31] BOOK, THEY ARE GOING TO COME. I DON'T
[1:39:33] CARE WHERE THEY ARE NOW. I DON'T CARE
[1:39:35] WHERE THEY WERE LAST NIGHT. IF GOD HAS A
[1:39:38] HAND ON THEM, THEY ARE GOING TO BE
[1:39:39] DELIVERED. YOU SERVE [screaming] GOD AND
[1:39:42] WATCH GOD WORK.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; YOU SERVE GOD AND WATCH GOD DO HIS
[1:39:46] THING. BECAUSE GOD IS A MIRACLE WORKING
[1:39:49] GOD. GOD DOESN'T NEED YOUR HELP. HE
[1:39:51] WANTS YOUR WORSHIP. BUT HE IS BIG ENOUGH
[1:39:53] TO DELIVER YOUR CHILDREN. HE IS BIG
[1:39:56] ENOUGH TO HEAL CANCER. HE IS BIG ENOUGH
[1:39:58] TO HEAL FEMALE CONDITION. OH, somebody
[1:40:02] say amen.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:05] [applause]
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; He is big enough
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; to make the cripples walk.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; He's big enough to GIVE YOU A REVIVAL IN
[1:40:13] YOUR SOUL. YOU LOST YOUR JOY. HE COMES
[1:40:15] TO GIVE YOU BACK YOUR JOY.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOOD IS IT TO BE A CHRISTIAN AND
[1:40:19] YOU HAVE NO JOY? WHEN THE JOY OF THE
[1:40:21] LORD IS YOUR STRENGTH, SO YOU HAVE NO
[1:40:23] JOY, YOU HAVE NO STRENGTH.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PREACHING A DEEP MESSAGE THIS
[1:40:27] MORNING. I AM PREACHING A MESSAGE OF
[1:40:29] REMEMBERING THE LORD.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER HIM IN THE MORNING. REMEMBER
[1:40:32] HIM IN THE NOON TIME. REMEMBER HIM WHEN
[1:40:34] YOU WAKE UP. REMEMBER HIM WHEN YOU GO TO
[1:40:36] BED. REMEMBER HIM WHEN YOU'RE IN FRONT
[1:40:38] OF YOUR BOSS. REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN
[1:40:41] YOU'RE HAVING LUNCH WITH YOUR COWORKER.
[1:40:43] REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO
[1:40:45] SAY SOMETHING. REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN
[1:40:47] YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET UPSET. REMEMBER THE
[1:40:49] LORD WHEN YOUR WORLD IS FALLING APART.
[1:40:52] REMEMBER THE LORD
[1:40:57] [cheering]
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Situations are supposed to come.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Problems are supposed to come.
[1:41:11] THAT IS PART OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION OF A
[1:41:13] WARRIOR.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; What army are you in if you don't HAVE A
[1:41:15] BATTLE?
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BATTLE THIS MORNING,
[1:41:18] I WANT TO BREAK IT TO YOU. You you have
[1:41:20] to check yourself
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; because if YOU'RE IN THE ARMY OF THE
[1:41:24] LORD, YOU HAVE BATTLES COMING IN THE
[1:41:25] MORNING, IN THE NOON TIME TO TRY TO
[1:41:27] THROW YOU OFF, TO TAKE YOU OUT IN THE
[1:41:29] SPIRIT. BUT WHEN YOUR WORLD BEGINS TO
[1:41:31] ROCK, YOU JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE LORD
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S THE LORD'S DOING.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; HE IS PROVING. He is testing. HE IS
[1:41:38] MAKING SURE THAT HE CAN GIVE YOU POWER
[1:41:40] BECAUSE POWER IS COMING TO YOU. BUT
[1:41:42] POWER WITHOUT CHARACTER IS SATANIC.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; But brother Isaac, you don't even know
[1:41:50] HOW TOUGH MY HUSBAND IS. THAT'S ALL
[1:41:52] RIGHT.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; THE LORD GIVE IT A HUSBAND TO TRY YOU.
[1:41:55] [cheering]
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TOUGH MY CHILDREN
[1:41:58] ARE. IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM RIGHT NOW
[1:41:59] TALKING TO YOU.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING TO YOUR HUSBAND. I'M
[1:42:02] TALKING TO YOU. I'M NOT TALKING TO YOUR
[1:42:04] CHILDREN. I'M TALKING TO YOU. YOU
[1:42:06] REMEMBER THE LORD.
[1:42:07] IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENS AROUND
[1:42:09] YOU. YOU REMEMBER THE LORD.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Hand the church say amen.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Why do you say this, brother Isaac?
[1:42:23] Because there are a lot of Sunday
[1:42:24] churchgoers and Wednesday church goers
[1:42:26] and Friday churchgoers. And in Trinidad,
[1:42:28] I I I say it all the time, the Oscars is
[1:42:30] the award for acting.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:34] If that award was to go to a country, it
[1:42:36] will come here. You know,
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; because we ARE VERY GOOD AT PUTTING ON A
[1:42:40] good show,
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; how you do it? All is well. And behind
[1:42:43] there, your whole car, your flat tire,
[1:42:45] your tire went this way, this way. I'm
[1:42:47] not saying don't speak positive.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; But under pressure, most people break
[1:42:52] under pressure.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Most people do the wrong things under
[1:42:57] pressure. AND IF YOU PUT SOMETHING in
[1:43:00] the code or the programming code TO
[1:43:02] REMEMBER THE LORD BEFORE YOU RESPOND,
[1:43:03] your response will be different.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; IF AS YOU APPROACH THE HOUSE OF GOD, YOU
[1:43:09] REMEMBER THE LORD BEFORE YOU STEP INTO
[1:43:10] THE HOUSE OF GOD, IT'LL MAKE YOU WALK in
[1:43:12] a certain way BECAUSE THIS IS NOT
[1:43:14] BROTHER WALDRON'S CHURCH. THIS IS GOD'S
[1:43:16] HOUSE. [cheering]
[1:43:18] [applause]
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; BROTHER WALDRON HAS SHEPHERD AUTHORITY,
[1:43:23] BUT THIS IS THE HOUSE OF GOD. AND IF YOU
[1:43:26] REMEMBER THE LORD, THEN YOU WILL HONOR
[1:43:27] THE PASTOR.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL HONOR THE OFFICERS BECAUSE YOU
[1:43:30] REMEMBER IS THE LORD.
[1:43:36] [applause]
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; If if Ananas and Safara had understood
[1:43:39] the Lord,
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; they thought they were talking to
[1:43:42] brother Peter.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; THEY THOUGHT IT WAS PETER, BUT THE LORD
[1:43:46] WAS IN THE PICTURE.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; AND PETER SAID, "YOU HAVEN'T LIED TO ME.
[1:43:50] YOU LIED TO THE HOLY GHOST."
[1:43:53] AND BECAUSE HE LIED TO THE HOLY GHOST, I
[1:43:54] CAN'T GET INVOLVED IN THIS THING.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; I wonder what would happen because the
[1:44:00] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:44:02] wisdom.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; What happens to our young people
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; because they don't know the fear of the
[1:44:07] Lord.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; But when you get the fear of the Lord
[1:44:10] and you begin to remember the Lord, when
[1:44:12] you go to school, IT IS NO LONGER A
[1:44:13] PRESSURE. WELL, I NEED TO dress this way
[1:44:15] and do this. No, you remember the Lord.
[1:44:17] You remember he's watching.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; You remember he's next to you. Yeah. Do
[1:44:21] I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW
[1:44:22] OF DEATH, I'LL FEAR NO EVIL. YOU ARE
[1:44:24] CONSCIOUS OF THE PRESENCE OF THE Lord
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; and all of social media and family and
[1:44:30] the news and the politics. IT'S A LOT OF
[1:44:32] INFORMATION. IT'S TO DISTRACT YOU.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; WHERE IS THE LORD IN ALL OF IT? WE HAVE
[1:44:36] TO remember the Lord.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 8:1.
[1:44:49] I'm just showing you how much time this
[1:44:51] thing repeats and we bring it into
[1:44:53] context shortly. Beware that thou forget
[1:44:56] not the LORD THY GOD. WHY IS IT GOD has
[1:44:58] to keep repeating this thing?
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; All through the Old Testament, ALL
[1:45:03] THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT, DON'T FORGET.
[1:45:05] REMEMBER, DON'T FORGET verse 11. Brother
[1:45:09] Waldron told me I could take my time.
[1:45:10] Just so you know,
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; so I'm taking my time. All right. Praise
[1:45:17] the Lord.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy
[1:45:19] God,
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; in not keeping his commandments, and his
[1:45:22] judgments, and his statutes, which I
[1:45:24] command thee this day, lest, listen,
[1:45:27] when thou hast eaten and art full, AND
[1:45:30] HAST BUILT GOODLY HOUSES, AND DWELT
[1:45:32] THEREIN, and when thy herds and thy
[1:45:35] flock multiply, and thy silver and thy
[1:45:38] gold is multiply, and all that thou HAST
[1:45:41] IS MULTIPLIED,
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; THEN THY HEART BE LIFTED UP,
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; AND THOU FORGET THE LORD THY GOD, WHICH
[1:45:47] BROUGHT THEE FORTH OUT OF THE LAND OF
[1:45:49] EGYPT, FROM THE house of bondage, who
[1:45:52] led thee through that great and terrible
[1:45:54] wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents
[1:45:57] and scorpions and drought, WHERE THERE
[1:45:59] WAS NO WATER, WHO BROUGHT THEE FORTH
[1:46:02] WATER OUT OF THE ROCK OF FLINT, WHO FED
[1:46:05] THEE IN THE WILDERNESS WITH MANA, WHICH
[1:46:07] THY FATHERS KNEW NOT, THAT HE MIGHT
[1:46:09] HUMBLE THEE, AND THAT HE MIGHT prove
[1:46:11] thee to DO THEE GOOD AT THY LATTER END.
[1:46:15] AND THOU SAY IN THINE HEART, MY power
[1:46:18] and the might of mine hand got me this
[1:46:21] wealth.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; But thou shalt remember the Lord thy
[1:46:24] God. Again, it repeated, for it is he
[1:46:26] that giveth thee power to get wealth,
[1:46:29] that he may ESTABLISH HIS COVENANT,
[1:46:31] WHICH HE swear unto thy fathers, as it
[1:46:34] is this day. And it shall be, if thou do
[1:46:37] at all, forget the Lord thy God, and
[1:46:40] walk after other gods and serve them and
[1:46:43] worship them, I testify against you this
[1:46:46] day that you shall surely perish.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; So God was showing THEM, YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:46:50] GET BLESSED.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; But in getting blessed, don't forget ME
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; IN MULTIPLYING YOUR BREAD BASKET, DON'T
[1:46:56] FORGET ME. YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE CAME
[1:46:58] TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND THEY PRAY for a
[1:46:59] job?
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, pastor, pray for me. I need
[1:47:02] to get a job. and the moment they get a
[1:47:03] job after a few months they can't see
[1:47:05] them anywhere
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; or they was coming to church and they
[1:47:09] was traveling AND THEY SAY LORD BLESS me
[1:47:10] with that car bless with THAT CAR AND
[1:47:12] THE MOMENT THEY GET THE CAR THEY on
[1:47:13] Moracas Beach on Sunday morning
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; because what they're really looking for
[1:47:19] is a God of convenience
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; they want A GOD WHO CAN JUST HELP THEM
[1:47:23] WITH THEIR AGENDA AND THE OBJECTIVE BUT
[1:47:26] THROUGH SCRIPTURE AND this is God
[1:47:27] putting it there over and over. Don't
[1:47:29] forget me
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE BLESSED STAY HUMBLE. WHEN
[1:47:32] GOD OPEN UP YOUR BREAD BASKET, STAY
[1:47:34] HUMBLE. WHEN GOD GIVE YOU FOOD ON YOUR
[1:47:36] TABLE, STAY HUMBLE. AND HE'S SAYING MANY
[1:47:39] OF US WHEN IT'S MY HARD WORK, WHAT HARD
[1:47:41] WORK YOU DO THAT BLESSED YOU.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF THE LORD DON'T GIVE YOU
[1:47:44] INCREASE, YOU'LL GET NOTHING. IT HAVE
[1:47:46] PEOPLE WORKING HARD WITH NO INCREASE.
[1:47:48] BUT IT'S THE LORD WHO HAS BLESSED YOU.
[1:47:50] THE LORD WHO HAS KEPT YOU.
[1:47:52] [cheering and applause]
[1:47:54] Can the church say amen? And he promised
[1:47:56] to do it. NOT JUST IN THE NATURAL, but
[1:47:59] in the spiritual. Can the church say
[1:48:01] amen?
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Remembering the Lord.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Why is this important? We're building
[1:48:17] into something in the message oneness.
[1:48:20] Brother Brandham said that's God's
[1:48:21] purpose. And his purpose as father
[1:48:23] supreme was to be one with his family,
[1:48:25] his earthly family, Adam and Eve. And
[1:48:27] the only way that they could be one with
[1:48:29] the family or with God was because God's
[1:48:32] nature was in them. We read that same
[1:48:35] scripture. It says that ye are supposed
[1:48:36] to be partakers of his divine nature by
[1:48:39] these precious promises.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; So that what so that made them with
[1:48:43] God's data in them then with each other
[1:48:45] and God they become all one. Isn't that
[1:48:48] a beautiful picture? God in his family.
[1:48:51] Father over all supreme. No death, no
[1:48:54] sorrow, no heartaches, no nothing. Just
[1:48:57] joy unspeakable. Never to be sick, never
[1:49:00] to have a heartache, just one with God.
[1:49:03] What a picture. Because the very nature
[1:49:05] of God was in these people.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for. You know,
[1:49:10] not you operating a certain way, BUT THE
[1:49:12] VERY NATURE OF GOD, THE LORD HIMSELF IN
[1:49:15] THESE PEOPLE. And therefore, WHAT THAT
[1:49:18] DID, THEY FOLLOWED JUST in line with
[1:49:20] God. and God with them made them one.
[1:49:23] Can the church say amen?
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; The nature of God. That's the reason it
[1:49:27] wasn't the apostles in the message
[1:49:29] perseverant. Jesus chose them all.
[1:49:31] Practically every one of them without
[1:49:33] even enough education to sign their
[1:49:35] name. He didn't choose priests. He
[1:49:38] didn't choose theologians. He chose
[1:49:40] fishermen and herdsmen, the ignorant and
[1:49:42] the unlearned. So he could take that in
[1:49:44] his hand and take nothing and MAKE
[1:49:47] SOMETHING OUT OF IT. THAT'S HIS NATURE.
[1:49:50] LISTEN, IF GOD DIDN'T CHOOSE YOU,
[1:49:52] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THE MESSAGE WILL
[1:49:54] FIND ITSELF IN THE HANDS OF THE
[1:49:55] PREDESTINATED. YOU NEVER FOUND THE
[1:49:58] MESSAGE, THE MESSAGE FOUND YOU. THE YOU
[1:50:00] WERE BORN, THE MESSAGE STARTED TO LOOK
[1:50:03] FOR YOU. YOU WENT TO PRIMARY SCHOOL AND
[1:50:05] THE MESSAGE WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. YOU
[1:50:07] WENT TO THE BAPTIST CHURCH AND THE
[1:50:09] MESSAGE WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. YOU WENT TO
[1:50:10] THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH AND THE MESSAGE
[1:50:13] WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. AND ONE DAY THE
[1:50:15] MESSAGE FOUND YOU AND THE SEED IN YOUR
[1:50:17] SOUL WAS QUICKENED.
[1:50:19] YOU COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; YOU COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT. BUT THEN
[1:50:24] SOMETHING GOT A HOLD OF YOU.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU CHANGED. BUT
[1:50:27] THIS BROTHER DIFFERENT. THIS SISTER
[1:50:29] DIFFERENT. IS THE SEED IN YOU? BECAUSE
[1:50:32] YOU ARE NOT EVEN THE BELIEVER. BUT THE
[1:50:34] SEED IN YOU, THAT'S THE BELIEVER. Can
[1:50:36] the church say amen?
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; And that seed in you is what responds to
[1:50:41] the word.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; When the word goes forth, THAT SEED SAYS
[1:50:44] AMEN.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; THAT SEED IS BIGGER THAN YOUR PROBLEM.
[1:50:48] THAT SEED OF PREDESTINATION AND THAT
[1:50:50] SEED OF PURPOSE IS BIGGER THAN YOUR
[1:50:52] SICKNESS. YOUR SICKNESS HAS TO GIVE WAY
[1:50:55] TO THE SEED IN YOU. GREATER IS HE THAT'S
[1:50:58] IN YOU THAN HE THAT'S IN THE WORLD.
[1:51:00] GREATER IS HE THAN YOU THAN ANYTHING
[1:51:02] ELSE THAT'S COMING TO GET YOU. CAN THE
[1:51:04] church say amen?
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; But something has to push us. Something
[1:51:17] has to bring us to a spot when we
[1:51:19] recognize that it's not just our effort,
[1:51:21] but we have to make the Lord the focus
[1:51:23] of our lives.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; But the Brandon taught us in every
[1:51:30] church has three kinds of believers.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; We know these things.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; And it took me a a while to understand
[1:51:39] that there are people who are in church
[1:51:41] who are unbelievers.
[1:51:45] That's right.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Think about it. It's it's a paradox, you
[1:51:48] know,
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; because you see in every church in three
[1:51:50] kinds of believers.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; So there are people in the church who
[1:51:53] actually don't believe.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; And then there are those who are the
[1:51:57] make believers in the church.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE THEY BELIEVE, BUT THEY
[1:52:01] REALLY DON'T BELIEVE.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; So there's THE FIRST GROUP. THEY ARE
[1:52:04] THERE. THEY'RE SINGING. THEY'RE
[1:52:05] CLAPPING. THEY COME IN THE CHURCH ALL
[1:52:06] THE TIME, BUT THEY REALLY DON'T BELIEVE.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THAT they are they don't
[1:52:10] believe anything at all. No, no. But
[1:52:12] there are few things that they can't
[1:52:14] JUST GRASP.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T BELIEVE THAT God could veil
[1:52:17] completely in them.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD DROP
[1:52:19] ARTS AND GRUDGES.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT
[1:52:24] THEIR CHILDREN COULD BE RESTORED
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WRITE them off
[1:52:26] already.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; When the Bible SAY THE PROMISES UNTO YOU
[1:52:30] AND TO YOUR CHILDREN, IT DON'T matter
[1:52:31] where YOUR CHILDREN ARE. IF THAT'S PART
[1:52:33] OF YOUR HERITAGE, IT MUST COME.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; And I want to and I want to raise that
[1:52:42] if there were people around Jesus who
[1:52:44] didn't believe around Jesus
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; and we're going to get to it in a bit.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; What about the message?
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS HAD IT.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; IF JESUS OWN MINISTRY HAD PEOPLE AROUND
[1:52:56] HIM THAT DID NOT BELIEVE
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; EVEN ONE WAS A DEVIL IN THE INNER
[1:53:02] CIRCLE.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; What about IN THIS MESSAGE?
[1:53:08] SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU GET
[1:53:10] YOUR FOOD FROM.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHO YOU SPEND
[1:53:13] YOUR TIME WITH.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU'RE
[1:53:16] DOING.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; AND IN ALL OF THIS, REMEMBER THE LORD
[1:53:19] BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE WHO CALLED YOU.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; No church CALL YOU. NO MAN CALL YOU. AND
[1:53:24] JESUS SAID, "ALL THAT THE FATHER HAS
[1:53:25] GIVEN ME MUST COME."
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; So we SHOULD BE SO REJOICING THAT OUR
[1:53:30] NAMES ARE ON THE BOOK BECAUSE ONCE YOUR
[1:53:33] NAME IS THERE, YOU ARE GOING TO COME
[1:53:34] FORTH. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN?
[1:53:41] So let's build a bit.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; I want to go to John chapter 6.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Spend a little time in that scripture if
[1:53:48] that's okay.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; John chapter 6 and verse one. after
[1:53:54] these things. Now, this is tying now
[1:53:56] into brother Walter's inspiration, but
[1:54:00] also leads into Jesus own declaration
[1:54:02] because we spend a lot of time in the
[1:54:04] Old Testament seeing God's mercy to them
[1:54:07] by trying to remind them, don't forget
[1:54:09] me. Don't forget me.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine the Lord trying to
[1:54:12] say, "Don't forget me."
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; That the Lord feels forgotten.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; John 6 verse one. After these things,
[1:54:23] Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee,
[1:54:26] which is the Sea of Tiberius, and a
[1:54:28] great multitude followed him because
[1:54:30] they saw his miracles which he did on
[1:54:32] them that were diseased.
[1:54:35] So, this here is almost a type of firstp
[1:54:38] person ministry, diseases being healed.
[1:54:40] So, there's an attraction that's going
[1:54:42] on there. Are we together?
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; And Jesus went up into a mountain, and
[1:54:46] there he sat with his disciples.
[1:54:49] Verse four, and the Passover of feast of
[1:54:52] the Jews was nigh. So we see in here a
[1:54:55] context. We seen here a season and a
[1:54:57] moment IN TIME THAT THE PASSOVER WAS
[1:55:00] ABOUT TO take place.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; AND THIS PASSAGE OF CHAPTER 6 INTO
[1:55:03] CHAPTER 7 is found between the feast of
[1:55:06] Passover and the feast of tabernacles in
[1:55:07] chapter 7.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; SO THE PASSOVER HIMSELF IS ON THE EARTH.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; And the feast of Passover is about to
[1:55:16] take place. AND JESUS LIKES TO UNFOLD
[1:55:19] THINGS to people. He doesn't tell us all
[1:55:21] at once what he's going TO DO. MANY
[1:55:24] TIMES IN SCRIPTURE AND THE PROPHET SAID
[1:55:26] IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU LOOK BACK YOU CAN SEE
[1:55:27] WHAT IN FACT TOOK PLACE.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK YOU WASN'T MAKING
[1:55:31] PROGRESS WHEN YOU LOOK BACK YOU REALIZE
[1:55:32] I'M NOT WHAT I USED TO BE. I'M NOT WHAT
[1:55:34] I'M SUPPOSED TO BE BUT I NOW LOOK BACK
[1:55:36] AND SEE IT'S THE GRACE OF GOD THAT HAS
[1:55:38] KEPT ME ALL THESE YEARS.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Verse five. And when Jesus had lifted up
[1:55:48] his eyes, SO HE'S FELLOWSHIPPING WITH
[1:55:51] WITH THE DISCIPLES. HE'S IN THIS STATE
[1:55:54] WHERE people are being healed and people
[1:55:55] are being attracted to the ministry AND
[1:55:57] DISEASES. AND YOU COULD IMAGINE WHEN THE
[1:56:00] MIRACLES STRIKE AND PEOPLE ARE HEALED.
[1:56:01] EVERYBODY STARTS TO COME TOGETHER.
[1:56:04] And Jesus lifted up his eyes and saw a
[1:56:07] great company come unto him. And he said
[1:56:09] unto brother Phillip,
[1:56:13] when shall we buy bread
[1:56:16] that these may eat?
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; So within this chapter, we start to talk
[1:56:21] about this bread thing. NOW,
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; WHERE SHALL WE BUY BREAD THAT THESE MAY
[1:56:26] EAT? NOW THAT is a loaded QUESTION
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE GOES on and says, "And
[1:56:30] this he said to prove him, to test him."
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. SO JESUS WAS ASKING
[1:56:35] SOMEWHAT ON THE ONE HAND A RHETORICAL
[1:56:37] QUESTION BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE WAS NO
[1:56:39] PLACE HE COULD GO AND BUY THIS BREAD.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; To prove him FOR HE HIMSELF KNEW what he
[1:56:49] would do. And Philillip answered him.
[1:56:53] 200 PENNY WORTH OF BREAD is not
[1:56:56] sufficient for them that every one of
[1:56:58] them may take a little. Now 200 penny
[1:57:00] worth is like 200 dinari. IS LIKE 200
[1:57:03] days worth of money that you could earn.
[1:57:05] SO HE'S SAYING WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
[1:57:07] MONEY.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; YES. YES.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT ONLY THAT, YOU KNOW THE BAKERIES
[1:57:10] HERE in in Trinidad, you could walk to a
[1:57:12] bakery and say I need bread for 5,000.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Nobody have that inventory.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; NO BAKERY YOU COULD WALK TO RIGHT NOW,
[1:57:22] YOU COULD WALK IN today after this and
[1:57:24] say, "Listen, we need enough bread for
[1:57:26] 5,000." And it's NOT JUST 5,000. IT'S
[1:57:28] 5,000 MEN. That didn't include the women
[1:57:30] and the children. SO 10,000 LO THE BREAD
[1:57:33] NOW BECAUSE we have people waiting to
[1:57:34] eat. THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS service by
[1:57:36] brother Walton for a while. Amen.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; And Philillip inspired say, "Brother,
[1:57:43] but but but Jesus, we the money we have
[1:57:46] not enough. But even still, I mean,
[1:57:48] where we going to get all this bread?"
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Philip answered me in verse 7, 200 penny
[1:57:58] worth of bread is not sufficient for
[1:58:00] them that every one of them may take a
[1:58:04] little.
[1:58:06] ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES, ANDREW, SIMON
[1:58:09] PETER'S BROTHER, saith unto him,
[1:58:10] "There's a lad here,
[1:58:13] WHICH HAD FIVE BARLEY LOAVES." I know
[1:58:16] barley is first fruit, right? Barley
[1:58:18] loaves and two small fishes.
[1:58:21] But some of you will say, "This is the
[1:58:23] Trinidad spirit right here. You're
[1:58:24] bringing it, but you're asking, but what
[1:58:26] are they among so many?" It's better you
[1:58:29] just say what you have, but here we
[1:58:30] putting in a little word. I have this
[1:58:32] here, but what is this among so many?
[1:58:35] I like Jesus's next response because
[1:58:38] this here shows that God is a God of
[1:58:40] order.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; And it's only when you slow down and you
[1:58:43] look at it, they recognize HOW GOD
[1:58:45] OPERATES. HIS FIRST INSTRUCTION WAS, and
[1:58:49] Jesus said, "Make the men sit down."
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Written in red. I'm a Bible believer.
[1:58:55] Anytime something is written, it's
[1:58:57] important.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "MAKE THE MEN SIT DOWN.
[1:59:04] IN OTHER WORDS, IF THIS THING IS ABOUT
[1:59:06] TO HAPPEN, LET'S GET SOME ORDER IN here
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; because God is about to do something.
[1:59:10] AND GOD IS A GOD of order.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO MISS WHAT'S
[1:59:14] ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE. SO, I WANT
[1:59:15] EVERYBODY TO SIT DOWN.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; But in church long time, I just normally
[1:59:18] stand up in church. Well, you go
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; because Jesus say make is not just tell
[1:59:24] them. He said make them sit down or no.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; It may seem small, but I WANT US TO
[1:59:30] UNDERSTAND GOD IS A GOD OF ORDER. YOU
[1:59:32] CANNOT COME INTO THE KINGDOM AND DO WHAT
[1:59:34] YOU WANT.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND
[1:59:37] OPERATE ANYWHERE YOU WANT.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; JUST SAY MAKE EVERYBODY TO SIT DOWN. I
[1:59:41] DON'T WANT NOBODY STANDING UP. I DON'T
[1:59:42] WANT NOBODY WALKING AROUND THE PLACE.
[1:59:44] THERE'S A ORDER TO WHAT GOD IS ABOUT TO
[1:59:46] DO.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; So when you don't understand and you
[1:59:50] come to church and you don't understand
[1:59:51] something, respect the order
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; because God works through order.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; The usher put you somewhere. The deacon
[1:59:57] PUT YOU SOMEWHERE. SOMEBODY DO
[1:59:58] SOMETHING.
[1:59:59] YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR BLESSING TIED TO THE
[2:00:01] OBEDIENCE.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN ATTITUDE, YOU
[2:00:05] THROW OFF YOUR WHOLE BLESSING BECAUSE
[2:00:06] YOU FIND THE brother shouldn't do this
[2:00:07] and this one shouldn't do this. God is a
[2:00:09] God of order.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible goes on, "Now there was much
[2:00:14] grass in the place."
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; SO THE MEN SAT down in number about
[2:00:19] 5,000.
[2:00:20] Verse 11. And Jesus took the loaves and
[2:00:24] when he had given thanks, he distributed
[2:00:26] to the disciples
[2:00:28] and the disciples to them that WERE SET
[2:00:31] DOWN. IN OTHER WORDS, this saying this
[2:00:32] set down thing. Brother Clarence, if
[2:00:34] when somebody was standing up there
[2:00:35] again, anything?
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE GOES ON TO SAY IT went to
[2:00:40] those WHO WERE SET DOWN. IN OTHER WORDS,
[2:00:42] IF YOU'RE OBEDIENT, IF YOU COULD TAKE
[2:00:43] CHURCH ORDER, IF YOU COULD CONDUCT
[2:00:45] YOURSELF RIGHT, IF YOU COULD TAKE THE
[2:00:47] SMALL THINGS BECAUSE THAT SMALL THING,
[2:00:49] THE BIBLE REPEATS THE POINT ONLY THOSE
[2:00:51] WHO WERE SET DOWN GOT THE FOOD.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; SO EVEN IN THE WAY GOD IS DEALING WITH
[2:00:58] THIS ISSUE OF BREAD, HE IS BRINGING
[2:01:00] CHURCH ORDER, CONDUCT ORDER, DOCTRINE
[2:01:02] TIED TO IT SO THAT YOU COULD RECEIVE THE
[2:01:04] WORD A CERTAIN WAY, NOT BY YOUR
[2:01:06] IMAGINATION OR HOW YOU FEEL. WELL, I
[2:01:09] FEELING LED TO STAND UP NOW.
[2:01:11] HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; IN THE DAYS OF JOSHUA TO SHOUT SHOUT
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; AND MAN SAY I I FEEL to shout right now
[2:01:18] or know brother take deacons take him
[2:01:20] outside
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S AN ORDER.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T DO WHAT YOU WANT WHEN YOU WANT
[2:01:25] TO DO IT. IF GOD SAID DO IT WHATEVER GOD
[2:01:28] SAYS DO IT IN THAT WAY
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; AND WATCH GOD BLESS YOU.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; But I don't understand. I DON'T
[2:01:36] UNDERSTAND WHY HE SAY SIT DOWN. I DON'T
[2:01:38] UNDERSTAND. I LIKE TO SHOUT. I LIKE TO
[2:01:40] SHOUT WHY JOSHUA SAY WHEN WHEN I BEGIN
[2:01:42] IT TO SHOUT. I FEEL TO SHOUT NOW.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; TIME, PLACE, ORDER, CONTEXT. THIS IS
[2:01:48] GOD'S OPERATION.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT SUBJECT TO OUR
[2:01:52] UNDERSTANDING.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; IF GOD SAYS IT A CERTAIN WAY, HE SAY
[2:01:56] SHOW YOURSELF IN CHURCH.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; PRESENT YOUR BODY A LIVING SACRIFICE.
[2:02:00] WELL, HOW AND WHY AND WHEN? YOU HAVE ALL
[2:02:03] KIND OF QUESTIONS.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Could somebody give me a reason why he
[2:02:08] wanted us to sit down? Brother, just sit
[2:02:10] down.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; You're holding up production right now.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; I hope you're getting this is the simple
[2:02:19] things. MANY TIMES WE SIT DOWN IN THE
[2:02:21] MESS WITH ALL KIND OF COMPLEX MYSTERIES.
[2:02:23] BUT THE simple thing, greet your
[2:02:24] brother, SHAKE BROTHER, DROP YOUR ODDS,
[2:02:26] FORGIVE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT he do and
[2:02:28] nobody ask you that
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; obey in the LITTLE THINGS AND WATCH GOD
[2:02:36] BLESS YOU IN THE BIG THINGS.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; I don't know how I end up there but just
[2:02:43] SAYING THIS IS GOD'S ORDER
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S JESUS trying to make the
[2:02:47] men to sit down.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; MANY TIME WE RUSH AHEAD AND DO WHAT WE
[2:02:53] WANT TO DO.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; GOD SAYS STILL THE PEOPLE IN OTHER WORDS
[2:02:56] STILL THE PEOPLE BECAUSE I'M ABOUT TO DO
[2:02:57] WONDERS AMONG THEM.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE THAT I'M THE ONE
[2:03:01] DOING IT.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE THAT THERE'S NO
[2:03:04] TEAM BEHIND THIS. THIS IS THE LORD'S
[2:03:05] DOING AND IT'S MARVELOUS IN HIS EYES.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT? BECAUSE WE THE
[2:03:16] ARMY OF THE LORD.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE FIGHTING a war, you running
[2:03:19] here, YOU RUNNING THERE. WELL, BROTHER,
[2:03:20] I FIGHTING HERE WRONG WAY, BROTHER. DO
[2:03:22] WE GOING THIS WAY?
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; There's nothing worse than an army
[2:03:26] that's disorganized, you know.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; AND LET ME REMIND US, it's one Lord.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; It's one faith.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; IT'S ONE BAPTISM. It's one army AND
[2:03:35] THERE'S ONE FIVE-STAR GENERAL. HIS NAME
[2:03:37] IS J E SUS.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; AND THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY ARE HIS
[2:03:41] COMMANDING OFFICERS. THAT'S THE
[2:03:43] PROPHET'S WORDS. EACH ONE BACKING ONE
[2:03:46] ANOTHER UP.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; MOVING THE ARMY IN STEP.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; CAN THE CHURCH say amen?
[2:03:53] [applause]
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; SO THE LESSON HERE IS NOT EVERYBODY SIT
[2:03:59] DOWN OR NO. THE LESSON HERE IS WHATEVER
[2:04:01] GOD SAYS DO, do it. Because there'll BE
[2:04:04] A TIME THE PROPHET WILL SAY STAND UP TO
[2:04:06] YOUR FEET AND CLAIM YOUR HEALING
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; by feeling to sit down.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; You miss your whole blessing.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET STOOD THERE SAY RISE TO YOUR
[2:04:15] FEET RECEIVE A HEALING. BROTHER, IF THE
[2:04:17] LORD SAY THAT BY JUMPING STRAIGHT TO MY
[2:04:19] FEET SO FAST.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS GOD LOOKING FOR? A RESPONSE TO
[2:04:26] THE WORD THAT IS SO QUICK, SO RESPONSE
[2:04:29] THAT GOD SAY, "I COULD TRUST YOU.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; I CAN TRUST YOU BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE
[2:04:34] POWER GOD WANTS TO GIVE. POWER WITHOUT
[2:04:37] CHARACTER IS SATANIC. THE POWER THAT'S
[2:04:38] COMING TO YOU, GOD HAS TO TRUST YOU WITH
[2:04:40] IT.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS TO KNOW THAT EVERY TIME HE GIVES
[2:04:42] YOU AN INSTRUCTION, YOU WILL FOLLOW HIS
[2:04:44] WORD ONLY
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; without wondering, well, Lord, why? HOW?
[2:04:47] NO, NO, NO. GOD SAYS DO THIS. GO TO THAT
[2:04:49] HOUSE. YES, LORD.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; PRAY FOR THAT PERSON. BUT LORD, THIS MAN
[2:04:53] HURT ME TWO YEARS AGO. I DIDN'T ASK YOU
[2:04:55] ALL THAT. PRAY FOR THE MAN.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S JESUS MINISTRY. IT'S NOT
[2:05:01] YOUR MINISTRY. IT'S NOT MY MINISTRY.
[2:05:03] IT'S JESUS MINISTRY.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; AND OUR FLESH HAS [screaming] TO DIE TO
[2:05:10] GIVE WAY FOR GOD TO TAKE US PLACES WE
[2:05:12] DON'T WANT TO GO. TAKE US TO DO THINGS
[2:05:14] WE DON'T WANT TO DO BECAUSE HE IS THE
[2:05:17] ONE IN CHARGE.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; BUT I DON'T FELLOWSHIP WITH that
[2:05:23] brother. I ask you that. Sit down.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; He don't like me. I ask YOU THAT YOU CAN
[2:05:29] LIKE HIM AND HE DON'T LIKE YOU. THAT
[2:05:30] HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. OBEY THE
[2:05:32] GOD. SHAKE HIS HAND.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; AND YOU RESPOND BECAUSE THE LORD SAID TO
[2:05:36] DO IT.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN?
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; THIS GOSPEL IS BIGGER THAN YOUR
[2:05:40] FEELINGS.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; IT'S BIGGER THAN YOUR PERSONALITY. IT'S
[2:05:43] BIGGER THAN WHO LIKE WHO AND WHO DON'T
[2:05:45] LIKE WHO. AND MY BLOOD CAN'T TAKE HIM.
[2:05:48] GOD NOT IS IS ONE BLOOD. THE BLOOD WAS
[2:05:51] SHED ON CALVARY. THAT SPEAKS BETTER FOR
[2:05:53] EVERY ONE OF US. CAN THE CHURCH say
[2:05:56] amen?
[2:05:59] THAT THROUGH THAT BLOOD WE COULD HAVE
[2:06:01] ACCESS TO his presence AND HAVE AN
[2:06:03] EXPERIENCE WITH THE HOLY GHOST THAT THE
[2:06:05] INNER MAN COULD CHANGE AND BE
[2:06:07] TRANSFORMED TO BE one with the Lord. Can
[2:06:09] the church say amen?
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Can we give the Lord a hand of praise?
[2:06:19] [applause]
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:27] So let's go. And Jesus took the loaves
[2:06:30] and when he had given thanks, he
[2:06:32] distributed to the disciples and the
[2:06:35] disciples to them that were set down and
[2:06:37] likewise of the fish as much as they
[2:06:40] would. This as much as they would mean
[2:06:42] they could have eaten as much as they
[2:06:44] wanted.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; You you know somebody go to a buffet
[2:06:48] line
[2:06:50] and they say it's only one piece of
[2:06:51] chicken.
[2:06:54] No, I'm not knocking anybody but a line
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; or it's like one piece of fish.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; I understand you have to plan. You have
[2:07:02] to cater different things, right? But
[2:07:04] here Jesus say they could eat as much as
[2:07:06] they want.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; As much fish as they wanted, they could
[2:07:09] eat.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Popwell, when they sat
[2:07:12] there and they were sitting out eating
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; every place in order. I want you to SEE
[2:07:16] THE PICTURE. 5,000 men and children and
[2:07:19] women and everybody eating. And as they
[2:07:21] pass out food and say, "Can I have
[2:07:22] another piece of fish?" Sure, brother.
[2:07:23] Can I have ANOTHER PIECE OF BREAD? SURE,
[2:07:25] BROTHER. CAN I HAVE ANOTHER ONE? SURE,
[2:07:27] BROTHER.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS LET THE OPERATION GO UNTIL
[2:07:30] THEY EAT WHAT THEY WANT. UNTIL people
[2:07:32] couldn't eat no more.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; They were eating and not even realizing
[2:07:40] a miracle is happening.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; They were breaking BREAD AND IT'S
[2:07:43] UNFOLDING TO THEM AS A MYSTERY THAT THEY
[2:07:45] NOT EVEN REALIZING THE MYSTERY UNTIL
[2:07:48] JESUS SAID, "I don't want no scraps
[2:07:50] anywhere. gather all the pieces of
[2:07:52] bread.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; And Jesus
[2:08:03] and when they were filled, verse 12,
[2:08:07] he said unto his disciple, "Gather up
[2:08:09] the fragments that remain that nothing
[2:08:11] be lost." That's powerful.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; So he's saying, "This bread is
[2:08:16] multiplied, is valuable.
[2:08:18] I don't want anything scattered around
[2:08:20] this. This is all breaking of the bread.
[2:08:22] This is all THIS WORD HERE. GATHER IT
[2:08:23] ALL UP BECAUSE NOT ONE WILL be lost. Not
[2:08:26] one word that is spoken by the prophet
[2:08:28] will FALL TO THE GROUND.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; NOT ONE SCRIPTURE THAT IS SPOKEN WILL
[2:08:31] FALL TO THE GROUND. EVERY SCRIPTURE MUST
[2:08:33] COME TO PASS. EVERY PROMISE MUST COME TO
[2:08:35] PASS AS GOD UNFOLD THINGS INTO YOUR
[2:08:38] LIFE.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Verse 13. Therefore they gathered them
[2:08:44] together and filled 12 baskets with the
[2:08:46] fragments of the five barley loaves
[2:08:49] which remained over and above unto them
[2:08:51] that had eaten.
[2:08:55] And those men when they had seen the
[2:08:57] miracle that Jesus did said this is of a
[2:09:00] truth that prophet that should come into
[2:09:03] THE WORLD. WHEN JESUS THEREFORE
[2:09:06] PERCEIVED
[2:09:08] FROM THIS EXPERIENCE OF BREAKING THIS
[2:09:10] BREAD TO them that THEY WOULD COME AND
[2:09:13] TAKE HIM BY FORCE TO make him a king, he
[2:09:15] departed again into a mountain himself
[2:09:17] alone.
[2:09:19] And when even was now come, his
[2:09:21] disciples went down unto the sea. And we
[2:09:24] know that with the encounter with the
[2:09:25] waves and Jesus walking on the water,
[2:09:27] etc., etc.
[2:09:31] I want to go down to verse 24.
[2:09:35] And when the people therefore saw that
[2:09:37] Jesus was not there because of the whole
[2:09:39] thing with the boat etc. Neither his
[2:09:41] disciples they also took shipping and
[2:09:43] came to Capernium seeking for Jesus. So
[2:09:45] they hunted for Jesus now. And when they
[2:09:47] had found him on the other side of the
[2:09:49] sea they said unto him Rabbi when camest
[2:09:51] thou hither? How you reach here? Jesus
[2:09:54] answered them and said and this is where
[2:09:56] IT GETS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE MINISTRY
[2:09:58] SHIFTED. THIS CHAPTER STARTED WITH
[2:10:00] PEOPLE WERE AFTER JESUS BECAUSE they
[2:10:02] were being healed of diseases.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; That's how it started. BUT NOW LOOK AT
[2:10:06] THE SHIFT in the people attitude what
[2:10:08] they came for. VERILY, VERILY, I SAY
[2:10:11] unto you, you seek me NOT BECAUSE YOU
[2:10:14] SAW THE MIRACLES.
[2:10:17] But because YOU DID EAT OF THE LOAVES
[2:10:19] AND WERE FILLED.
[2:10:22] SO THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO SERVICE TO
[2:10:24] FIND JESUS had moved from a crowd that
[2:10:27] was looking for a spiritual intervention
[2:10:30] to they want to move with the living
[2:10:32] bakery.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; AND HE CALLED THEM OUT TO IT. HE SAID,
[2:10:36] "YOU'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING
[2:10:37] FOR HEALING."
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE DISEASED
[2:10:41] AND YOU WANT ME TO INTERVENE. YOU'RE
[2:10:43] HERE BECAUSE YOU EAT FOOD AND YOU'RE
[2:10:44] BELLY FULL.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; I didn't say no. This is written in red.
[2:10:52] SO JESUS NOW BECAUSE IT'S A TRANSITION,
[2:10:55] HE WANTS TO PRESENT SOMETHING TO THEM.
[2:10:57] HE IS THE ONE WHO ASKS HOW WE FEED THEM
[2:10:59] BREAD. HE IS THE ONE WHO INTRODUCED this
[2:11:02] bread teaching in St. John 6.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Verse 27. Labor not for the meat which
[2:11:09] perisheth, but for that meat which
[2:11:12] endureth unto everlasting life, which
[2:11:14] the Son of Man shall give unto you, for
[2:11:16] him hath God the Father sealed.
[2:11:20] THEN THEY SAID UNTO HIM, WHAT SHALL WE
[2:11:21] DO THAT WE MIGHT WORK the works of God?
[2:11:24] Jesus answered and said unto them, "This
[2:11:26] is the work of God, that ye believe on
[2:11:27] him whom he had sent." And they said
[2:11:30] therefore unto him, "What sign?" So
[2:11:32] they're still looking for a sign. "What
[2:11:34] sign showest thou then, that we may see
[2:11:36] and believe thee?" What do thou work?
[2:11:41] And they pull some quotes.
[2:11:43] Our fathers
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; did eat mana IN THE DESERT AS IT IS
[2:11:47] WRITTEN. SO THEY PULL THE QUOTE.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; HE GAVE THEM BREAD FROM HEAVEN TO EAT.
[2:11:54] THEN JESUS SAID UNTO THEM, "VERILY,
[2:11:56] VERILY, I SAY unto you, MOSES GAVE YOU
[2:12:00] NOT THAT BREAD FROM HEAVEN,
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; BUT MY FATHER GIVETH YOU THE TRUE BREAD
[2:12:06] FROM HEAVEN."
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; SO HERE IT SHIFTED FROM A CONVERSATION
[2:12:10] AROUND NATURAL BREAD,
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; TO NOW THIS SPIRITUAL BREAD TYPE.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Verse 33, FOR THE BREAD OF GOD IS HE
[2:12:18] WHICH COMETH DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND GIVETH
[2:12:20] LIFE UNTO the world. Amen.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Then said they unto him, Lord, ever more
[2:12:25] give us this bread. And Jesus said unto
[2:12:28] them, I am
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; the bread of life.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; He that cometh to me shall never hunger.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me shall never
[2:12:38] thirst.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; BUT I said unto you that ye that ye also
[2:12:44] have seen me AND BELIEVE NOT.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; SO AFTER HE PRESENTS THIS TO THEM, HE
[2:12:49] SAY I'M ALL SEE ME. I'M TELLING YOU MY
[2:12:52] IDENTITY
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU STILL DON'T BELIEVE
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HAVE ME WITH YOU BUT YOU
[2:12:59] STILL DON'T RECOGNIZE WHO I AM.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; HE IS PRESENTING TO THEM HIS IDENTITY.
[2:13:03] HE SAYS I AM [screaming]
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; PRESENT TENSE SINGULAR. NOBODY ELSE. I
[2:13:08] am
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; the BREAD OF LIFE.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; SO YOU'RE ASKING ME TO GIVE YOU THE
[2:13:14] BREAD AND I AM THE BREAD.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He that cometh to me shall never
[2:13:20] hunger.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; And he that believeth on me shall never
[2:13:23] taste.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; But I said unto you that ye also have
[2:13:26] seen me and believe not.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus goes on, all that the Father
[2:13:30] giveth me shall come to me.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; And him that cometh to me, I will in no
[2:13:34] wise cast out. For I came down from
[2:13:36] heaven not to do mine own will, but the
[2:13:39] will of him that SENT ME.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THE FATHER'S WILL which had
[2:13:44] sent me, THAT OF ALL WHICH HE HAD GIVEN
[2:13:46] ME, I should lose nothing. Amen.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; But should raise it up again at the last
[2:13:50] day.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; And this is the will of him that sent
[2:13:53] me, that everyone which seeth the son
[2:13:55] and believeth in him may have
[2:13:56] everlasting life, and I will raise him
[2:13:58] up at the last day.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Verse 41. And the Jews then murb at him
[2:14:08] BECAUSE HE SAID, SO ALL OF THIS, THEY
[2:14:11] SAW THE BREAKING OF THE BREAD.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; YES,
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; THEY SAW THE MIRACLES. HE IDENTIFIED
[2:14:16] HIMSELF SAYING, "I AM THE BREAD."
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; HE GAVE THEM THE DOCTRINE.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T MOSES WHO PROVIDED BREAD FOR
[2:14:25] YOU.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; I AM THE BREAD.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; AND AFTER ALL OF THAT,
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; the Jews then murmured at him because he
[2:14:34] said, "I am the bread which came down
[2:14:36] FROM HEAVEN." SO IN OTHER WORDS, THEY
[2:14:38] QUESTIONING NOW HIS IDENTITY.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; You don't understand that you living
[2:14:42] your life in this message. You are an
[2:14:44] oddball that when you say you go into
[2:14:46] heaven, people question you.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; When you say you're going to be adopted,
[2:14:49] perfected, filled with the Holy Ghost,
[2:14:50] sealed, all these things, YOU ARE
[2:14:52] MYSTERY.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; HERE WAS THE MYSTERY ON THE EARTH
[2:14:54] HIMSELF, PRESENTING EVIDENCE, FACTS,
[2:14:57] TESTIMONY. AND HERE THEY are murmuring,
[2:14:59] I don't believe that, you know.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that you know.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Verse 42. And they go back, they say,
[2:15:06] but is not this Jesus the son of Joseph?
[2:15:10] You see what they're doing there? They
[2:15:12] say what village he come from?
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Who was his father?
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; What church he belong to?
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; How he could speak this way.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph
[2:15:22] whose father and mother we know?
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; You see the problem here? Because people
[2:15:26] say I know but I know him from small
[2:15:28] small. How we talking? So
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; I see him grow up.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; I KNOW HIS FAMILY. HOW WE MOVING SO HOW
[2:15:34] WE MOVE WITH SUCH FAITH?
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; HOW WE STANDING WHEN ALL ELSE FALLING
[2:15:38] APART? BUT I KNOW HIM.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; HOW WE TALKING SO? ALL OF A SUDDEN, I
[2:15:42] REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS IN THE BAR.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; I REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS DOING THIS OR
[2:15:45] THAT OR THE OTHER,
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S NOT HOW YOU ARE NOW. THAT'S
[2:15:48] NOT WHO YOU ARE NOW.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; THEY WILL ALWAYS QUESTION YOUR IDENTITY.
[2:15:52] AND THE PERFECT LAMB, THE PASSOVER
[2:15:54] HIMSELF IS ON THE EARTH AND THEY'RE
[2:15:55] questioning but not Joseph's son.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; SO, THINK NOT STRANGE WHEN PEOPLE WONDER
[2:16:02] WHY ARE YOU STILL IN THE MESSAGE? WHY
[2:16:05] are you STILL HOLDING ON? WHY ARE YOU
[2:16:07] STILL STANDING? IT SHOULDN'T BE STRANGE
[2:16:08] TO YOU BECAUSE MESSIAH WAS ON THE EARTH
[2:16:10] AND THEY'RE saying Dina Joseph's son
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; who in other words who does he feel he
[2:16:15] is
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; saying he's the bread of life
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; and who do you feel you are saying you
[2:16:19] are in the bride
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; BY WHAT AUTHORITY DO YOU SAY YOU ARE IN
[2:16:24] THE BRIDE
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; BY WHAT AUTHORITY DOES JESUS SAY WHAT HE
[2:16:28] SAYS BY WHAT AUTHORITY DID A PROPHET A
[2:16:30] STAR IN THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD SPEAK
[2:16:32] ABOUT THE things he did
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; can the church say amen
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; you don't know who I AM CHURCH. THE
[2:16:38] WORLD DOESN'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. WHERE
[2:16:39] WAS THOU WHEN I LAID THE FOUNDATION OF
[2:16:41] THE EARTH? And the morning star sang
[2:16:43] together.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOUR REAL IDENTITY.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Verse 42.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Is not this Jesus the
[2:16:56] son of Joseph whose father and mother we
[2:16:59] know? How is it then that he said, I
[2:17:01] come down from heaven?"
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; And you know, WE PREACH IT. WE COME FROM
[2:17:05] GOD AND WE GO BACK TO GOD.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; HOW COULD WE SAY THESE THINGS? BECAUSE
[2:17:09] IS THE TRUTH.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, THAT'S YOUR
[2:17:12] BUSINESS. BUT I KNOW I COME FROM GOD
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; AND I GO BACK TO GOD.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; I'M JUST PASSING THROUGH. NOW YOU SEE ME
[2:17:19] THEN YOU DON'T BECAUSE WE ARE GOING INTO
[2:17:21] THE RAPTURE. WE ARE LEAVING THIS PLACE.
[2:17:24] ONE OF THIS ONE OF THESE DAYS THIS WORLD
[2:17:26] WILL NOT HOLD ME ANYMORE.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; ONE OF THESE DAYS GRAVITY WILL LOSE ITS
[2:17:30] POWER.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:17:36] That's why the prophet said, "When you
[2:17:38] lift your hands,
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; you defy the laws of gravity.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; You testify that you are a creature of
[2:17:43] eternity.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT A CREATURE OF TIME."
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU LIFT YOUR HANDS, YOU SIGNAL
[2:17:48] IT, I AM LEAVING THIS PLACE.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; This world is NOT MY HOME.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; CAN THE CHURCH say amen? [cheering]
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:18:05] G.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Verse 43. Jesus therefore answered and
[2:18:13] said unto them, "Murmur not among
[2:18:15] yourselves." Could you imagine?
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; And we can't take criticism. Jesus had
[2:18:20] to stand there and watch them talking
[2:18:21] about him. Can you imagine?
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Somebody say you this, you're that, and
[2:18:25] you that there, you get in a whole
[2:18:25] fight. You get in a whole fight.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; Get used to people talking about you.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; GET COMFORTABLE PEOPLE NOT LIKING YOU.
[2:18:32] AMEN.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; I said to the parents in our church, you
[2:18:38] have to prepare your children for
[2:18:39] disappointment.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; You have to prepare your children for
[2:18:42] failure.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LIFE IS FULL OF DISAPPOINTMENT.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; LIFE IS FULL OF FAILURE. IF YOU PRESENT
[2:18:49] A PICTURE TO THEM of roses their whole
[2:18:51] life, the moment they run into
[2:18:52] embarrassment, they will capitulate.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; But you have to LET THEM KNOW LIFE IS UP
[2:18:57] AND DOWN.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; THE MOMENT SOMEBODY TALK ABOUT YOU, YOU
[2:19:00] YOU can't come to church for two weeks.
[2:19:03] Somebody talk to you about your dress,
[2:19:05] your this, your that, and you there, you
[2:19:06] you stumbled
[2:19:08] here. JESUS HAD TO STAND THERE, GOD
[2:19:10] HIMSELF, and people murmuring about him.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine if he went and cry in
[2:19:15] the corner and say, "I can't take it.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; I feeling so bad. I went to church and
[2:19:20] and I really didn't make the cut."
[2:19:23] Whatever it is,
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; and you there in a in a py party by
[2:19:26] yourself,
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; we have examples in scripture to know to
[2:19:30] stand. Yes,
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; you have to stand BY REVELATION. IT'S
[2:19:32] NOT NO group thing. THIS IS AN
[2:19:34] INDIVIDUAL AFFAIR. YOU HAVE TO KNOW GOD
[2:19:36] CALLED YOU. YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOU ARE
[2:19:38] PREDESTINATED. YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR
[2:19:40] NAME IS UNDER THE SEVENTH SEAL.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; NOBODY COULD REMOVE THAT IDENTITY. YOUR
[2:19:46] IDENTITY IS IN CHRIST.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; YOUR IDENTITY IS NOT YOUR FATHER, YOUR
[2:19:50] MOTHER, YOUR CHURCH, YOUR PASTOR. IT'S
[2:19:51] IN CHRIST.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; CAN the church say amen?
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; So Jesus therefore answered and said
[2:20:01] unto them, murmur not among yourselves,
[2:20:04] no man. So he had let down, he had tone
[2:20:07] down the message. You know, he start to
[2:20:10] increase the stakes of what he was
[2:20:11] saying. [laughter]
[2:20:12] Hallelujah. HE SAID, NO MAN CAN COME TO
[2:20:17] ME EXCEPT THE FATHER WHICH HAD SENT ME
[2:20:19] DRAW HIM.
[2:20:20] IN OTHER WORDS, I'M NOT TURNING DOWN THE
[2:20:22] MESSAGE,
[2:20:24] AND I WILL RAISE HIM UP AT THE LAST DAY.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; IT IS WRITTEN IN THE PROPHETS, AND THEY
[2:20:30] SHALL BE ALL TAUGHT OF GOD. EVERY MAN
[2:20:32] THEREFORE that had heard and had learned
[2:20:34] of the Father, cometh unto me.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Not any man had seen the Father, save he
[2:20:40] which is of God, and had seen the
[2:20:41] Father. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[2:20:44] he that believeth on me hath everlasting
[2:20:47] life.
[2:20:48] And he REPEATS THE MESSAGE, I AM THAT
[2:20:51] BREAD OF LIFE.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; HE REPEATS IT FOR EMPHASIS. I AM THAT
[2:20:56] BREAD OF LIFE.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID. YOUR FATHERS DID
[2:21:03] EAT MANA IN THE WILDERNESS AND THEY ARE
[2:21:05] DEAD.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE BREAD
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; WHICH COMETH down from heaven.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; And a man may eat thereof AND NOT DIE.
[2:21:16] I AM
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; THE LIVING bread
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; which come down from heaven.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; If any MAN EAT OF THIS BREAD,
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; HE SHALL LIVE FOREVER.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[2:21:26] ANYBODY WANT TO EAT OF THAT BREAD THIS
[2:21:27] MORNING? BECAUSE IF YOU EAT OF THAT
[2:21:29] BREAD,
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL LIVE FOREVER.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; And the bread that I will give is my
[2:21:37] flesh.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Which I will give for the life of the
[2:21:41] world. Amen.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; And Jesus therefore strove. Stro is like
[2:21:46] to contend among and the Jews therefore
[2:21:48] sorry strove or contend among saying how
[2:21:51] can this man give us his flesh to eat.
[2:21:57] Then Jesus said unto them, verily verily
[2:21:59] I say unto you. Now he goes in for the
[2:22:02] punch
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; because what God is trying to do, you
[2:22:06] see, we could have the very best of
[2:22:07] intentions.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; But I'm making very plain. The rapture
[2:22:11] is not for everybody.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; The rapture IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE in the message mean
[2:22:19] you're going to the rapture.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; SO GOD HERE IS THINNING DOWN THE CROWD.
[2:22:34] G
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE 5,000 PLUS THE CHILDREN AND
[2:22:37] EVERYBODY ELSE
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T HEAR THIS TEACHING.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; SO HE'S GOING IN FOR THE KILL BECAUSE
[2:22:46] GOD IS NOT PLAYING.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; He not playing with our emotions, our
[2:22:50] feeling, our history. Well, I a message
[2:22:51] long time. What does that mean?
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; If you have no life or testimony, where
[2:22:56] you going? Enoch had a testimony that he
[2:22:58] pleased God
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS TAKEN.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; HIS TESTIMONY wasn't I was in a mess FOR
[2:23:04] 20 YEARS.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; HIS TESTIMONY WAS HE PLEASED GOD.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; NOT HE PLEASE HIS BROTHERS, HIS SISTERS.
[2:23:12] BECAUSE PLEASING GOD WILL PUT YOU IN
[2:23:13] ALIGNMENT with your brothers and YOUR
[2:23:14] SISTERS.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; THE GOAL IS TO PLEASE GOD.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; So Jesus is going FOR THE JUGULAR. HE
[2:23:20] SAID, "I AM THAT BREAD. [screaming] I'M
[2:23:21] THE LIVING BREAD."
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; AND NOW HE GOES DEEPER.
[2:23:25] GLORY.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Verily, VERILY, I SAY UNTO
[2:23:29] YOU, EXCEPT YOU EAT THE FLESH OF THE Son
[2:23:31] of Man and drink his blood, ye have no
[2:23:34] life in you."
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Who so eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my
[2:23:41] blood hath eternal life, and I will
[2:23:44] raise him up at the last day. For my
[2:23:47] flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is
[2:23:50] drinked. He that eateth my flesh and
[2:23:53] drinkkeeth my blood dwelleth in me and I
[2:23:56] in him. AS THE LIVING FATHER HATH SENT
[2:23:59] ME, AND I LIVE BY THE FATHER, SO HE THAT
[2:24:02] eateth me, even he shall live by me.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE BREAD.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THAT BREAD WHICH CAME DOWN FROM
[2:24:12] HEAVEN,
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; NOT AS YOUR FATHERS DID EAT MANA. IN
[2:24:15] OTHER WORDS, THAT WAS JUST A SHADOW OF
[2:24:16] WHAT WAS COMING.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS TO GIVE YOU A CONCEPT OF WHAT
[2:24:20] WAS COMING.
[2:24:21] NOW WHAT WAS [screaming] NOW CONCEPT IS
[2:24:23] NOW REALITY
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; IN FRONT OF YOU.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THAT BREAD WHICH came down from
[2:24:36] heaven. Not as your fathers did eat man
[2:24:38] and are dead. He that eateth of this
[2:24:40] bread shall live forever.
[2:24:45] These things said he in the synagogue as
[2:24:48] he taught in Capernium.
[2:24:52] MANY THEREFORE OF HIS DISCIPLES
[2:24:57] when they had heard this
[2:25:02] said this is a hard saying
[2:25:06] who can hear it?
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; He said the PREACHER PREACHING TOO HARD
[2:25:11] BOY.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:25:16] GAL.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; When Jesus knew IN HIMSELF THAT HIS
[2:25:26] DISCIPLE MURMURED at it,
[2:25:28] I'm sure there's a service or two you
[2:25:30] went to. When the service done, you
[2:25:31] murmured it. It's part of your nature
[2:25:34] trying to reconcile. But was he talking
[2:25:36] about me or there are people who here
[2:25:37] say, "But you you're really getting at
[2:25:39] me today, boy. You ready?"
[2:25:42] Even the prophet had his experiences.
[2:25:43] You remember one time the prophet
[2:25:44] preached. He say he blasted everything
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; and this wonderful sister say you didn't
[2:25:48] touch me tonight.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; And what was she? She was the official
[2:25:53] church gossiper.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; And that was the one service the prophet
[2:25:56] didn't preach about gossip.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; SO PEOPLE HAVE A WAY TO SAY WHEN YOU
[2:26:01] PREACH YOU PREACH ABOUT ME BUT IT'S LIKE
[2:26:03] IT'S LIKE THE PREACHER KNOW WHAT GOING
[2:26:04] ON IN MY HOUSE.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; MANY TIMES THE MINISTER SPEAKS AND IT'S
[2:26:08] LIKE BUT WHO TELL THE PASTOR WHAT GOING
[2:26:09] ON? HALLELUJAH.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S the wisdom of God dropping out
[2:26:12] to deal with the situations.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; SO PEOPLE LEFT THE SERVICE SAYING
[2:26:17] THERE'S A HARD SAYING BOY WHO COULD HEAR
[2:26:19] this thing boy. I don't know what what
[2:26:21] brother present today boy. I don't know
[2:26:23] what the minister presented today boy.
[2:26:25] THIS THING COULD I LIVE THIS THING?
[2:26:26] COULD I MANIFEST THIS THING? COULD I
[2:26:28] REFLECT THIS THING? HE PREACHING ABOUT
[2:26:30] HOLINESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS and purity
[2:26:32] and sacredness and virtue AND AND
[2:26:35] HONESTY AND FAITH CHARITY AND ALL THESE
[2:26:38] ARE HARD SAINTS.
[2:26:39] BECAUSE IT GOES AGAINST THE VERY nature
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; this NATURE OF THE FLESH.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; BUT IF THERE'S A SEED IN THERE, THE SEED
[2:26:47] KNOWS, BUT WAIT A MINUTE.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; This is me.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE DESCRIBING ME. YOU'RE TALKING
[2:26:52] ABOUT ME.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; I SHALL BE PERFECT. I SHALL BE CHANGED.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; When Jesus knew in himself,
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:10] Hallelujah.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; THAT HIS DISCIPLES MURMURED AT IT. HE
[2:27:14] SAID unto them, "Do this offend you?"
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; You see why? You see Jesus Jesus say,
[2:27:21] "You know what? Let me make it easier
[2:27:22] for you." You know,
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; let me make it simpler. Let me make it
[2:27:26] convenient for you. Say, "Does this
[2:27:28] offend you?
[2:27:30] Does this bother you?" Because I'm not
[2:27:32] taking back what I said.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; Because I'm presenting the truth.
[2:27:37] Because if something offend you, you
[2:27:38] have to check yourself.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; If you're not living RIGHT WITH YOUR
[2:27:43] WIFE OR YOUR HUSBAND AND THAT OFFENDS
[2:27:44] YOU, you you you can't check the
[2:27:46] preacher.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; You going places you're not supposed to
[2:27:50] go.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; And I CALL IT OUT. THE MINISTER CALL IT
[2:27:53] OUT. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GOING
[2:27:54] THERE.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; DOES that offend you?
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Because if it offend you, IT'S NOT THE
[2:27:59] PREACHER
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORD IS COMING TO FIND YOU
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; AND ADDRESS YOUR ISSUES.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN?
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; And Jesus goes on, what and if you shall
[2:28:16] see the son of man ascend up where he
[2:28:19] was before.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; It is the spirit that quicken it.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; The flesh profiteth nothing. The words.
[2:28:26] So Jesus is going to say now he is
[2:28:27] signing everything you just said. The
[2:28:29] words,
[2:28:31] HALLELUJAH,
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; THAT I SPEAK UNTO YOU, THEY ARE spirit
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; and they are life.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE ARE SOME OF YOU THAT BELIEVE
[2:28:41] NOT. THIS IS AMONG HIS DISCIPLES.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; I WANT US TO APPRECIATE, CHURCH. IT
[2:28:47] WASN'T UNBELIEVERS. HE WASN'T TALKING IN
[2:28:49] FRONT OF A BAR.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; These were believers
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; WHO HAD SEEN MIRACLES, WHO HAD HEARD
[2:28:56] PREACHING, WHO HAD SAT IN CONVENTIONS.
[2:28:58] AND WHEN JESUS PRESENTED TO THEM THE
[2:29:01] STANDARD OF THE WORD,
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I KNOW THERE are those among
[2:29:04] you who already believe."
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; For Jesus knew from the beginning who
[2:29:19] they were that believed not and who
[2:29:22] should betray him. Could you imagine
[2:29:24] from the very beginning
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus see people coming and he could see
[2:29:28] pe people who believe and who don't
[2:29:30] believe. You've heard it said about a
[2:29:31] prophet many times. He couldn't tell his
[2:29:33] enemies from his friend.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; One of the hardest things with the
[2:29:35] prophet was seeing people and knowing
[2:29:37] who they really were.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; That they sincere. They in church and
[2:29:41] he's seeing that person is against me.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't show it.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; God help because some of us if we see
[2:29:48] that forget it.
[2:29:52] God have to hide it from us.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; We we not ready yet.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Because you can't discern the thoughts
[2:29:59] on the 10. If you could discern thought
[2:30:00] in the 10 people, you say, "Watch now."
[2:30:03] And I said, "No, by that person don't
[2:30:04] put they want to wash this person feet."
[2:30:06] No, I wash that person feet now.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; Because you know what in there?
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; JESUS KNEW FROM THE BEGINNING
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; WHO WAS A believer and who had betray
[2:30:15] him.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; AND JUDAS WAS WITH HIM THE WHOLE TIME
[2:30:18] AND NOBODY KNEW. That's right.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; And Jesus put brother Judas was the was
[2:30:24] the trustee.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; The treasurer
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; and Jesus let him treasure.
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; HE ESCAN BECAUSE HIS TIME WAS NOT YET
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; TOLD. BUT THE GRACIOUSNESS of God
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; GOD DID WASN'T EVEN EMBARRASS HIM
[2:30:43] BECAUSE WHEN YOU look at the at the last
[2:30:45] supper, he never even embarrassed Judas.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. He said whatever you do do
[2:30:49] quickly.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; They thought he going and deposit the
[2:30:52] money or do some transaction or buy
[2:30:53] bread or something. You know
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; because God is OPERATE AT A HIGHER LEVEL
[2:31:00] THAN OUR humanistic realm
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; we want TO WALK AROUND JUDGING THIS ONE.
[2:31:05] THIS ONE FALSE. THIS ONE DEAD. THIS ONE
[2:31:08] CUT OFF. THIS ONE IS SHOCK. THIS ONE IS
[2:31:10] THIS. THIS ONE IS THAT.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus present the word. He say it offend
[2:31:14] you.
[2:31:15] I know some of you do believe
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; is an opportunity still then to say Lord
[2:31:20] help me to help MY UNBELIEF
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU'RE SINCERE AND GOD CALLS
[2:31:25] OUT I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GETTING THIS THING
[2:31:26] THEN you say well Lord help my unbelief
[2:31:28] NOW
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE THE PROPHET TAUGHT THAT WHEN A
[2:31:31] PIG FALL INTO THE mud I always talk
[2:31:33] about this thing because many of us the
[2:31:35] nature change so you you you bring
[2:31:37] inside the house and you lock the house
[2:31:39] and they put some perfume and a bow tie
[2:31:40] and put a jacket ON THE PIG ONCE THE PIG
[2:31:43] INSIDE THE HOUSE HE BEH YES. YES. YES.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; ONCE A PIG IN CHURCH AND HE LOCK THE
[2:31:49] DOORS, HE CAN'T GO OUTSIDE.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:31:52] THAT PIG ON HIS BEST BEHAVIOR.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; ONCE THE DOOR STAY CLOSED BECAUSE YOU'RE
[2:32:00] GIVING HIM NO ROOM TO GO OUTSIDE. THAT
[2:32:02] IS WHY LEGALISM NEVER WORKS. BECAUSE YOU
[2:32:04] LOCK THE PIG INSIDE THE HOUSE. HE
[2:32:05] BEHAVE. HE NEVER DO ANYTHING WRONG. BUT
[2:32:08] THE DAY THE DEACON FORGET the door open
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; THAT PIG HEAD OUTSIDE
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; WITH ONE OBJECTIVE LOOKING FOR THE
[2:32:17] NEAREST MUD PIT
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE FIND THAT MUD PIT HE START
[2:32:22] TO roll
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; because it's his nature
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; BUT IF THAT PIG GET AN EXPERIENCE WITH
[2:32:31] GOD
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; AND THE NATURE CHANGE
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS WHO IS BECAUSE HIS NATURE
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; HAS BEEN CHANGED.
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; And the REASON I'M SAYING THAT IS
[2:32:50] BECAUSE WHEN A LAMB FALL IN THE MUD,
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; THE LAMB BLEEDS, but brother BRIAN SAID
[2:32:55] THE LAMB CRIES
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE DON'T WANT TO BE THERE.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THE PIG GET THERE,
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; HE TAKE HIS MONEY'S WORTH.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; HE WANT TO ENJOY THE MONTH BECAUSE
[2:33:05] THAT'S HIS NATURE.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. SO IF YOU STRUGGLE AND YOU
[2:33:08] RECOGNIZE I'M STRUGGLING TO BELIEVE, A
[2:33:10] SLAM WOULD SAY, "LORD, HELP MY UNBELIEF.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; MAYBE I'M NOT GETTING IT, BUT HELP ME
[2:33:15] BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS
[2:33:17] SERVICE NOT SURE IF I GO INTO THE
[2:33:19] RAPTURE. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS
[2:33:21] SERVICE NOT SURE IF [screaming] I HAVE
[2:33:23] THE HOLY GHOST."
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; Can the church say, "Amen?"
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:33:36] Amen.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; My Lord.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; Verse 64. But there are some of you that
[2:33:45] believe not.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; For Jesus knew from the beginning who
[2:33:49] they were that believed not, and who
[2:33:52] would betray him. All right.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Therefore said I unto you,
[2:33:59] that no man COULD COME UNTO ME except it
[2:34:02] were given unto him OF MY FATHER." THIS
[2:34:05] IS WHY YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU COULD TELL YOUR
[2:34:07] FRIEND IN SCHOOL ABOUT this thing. AND
[2:34:09] UNLESS GOD put a seed in them, they will
[2:34:12] NEVER RESPOND.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; DON'T FEEL BAD WHEN THEY DON'T. BUT IT
[2:34:15] DOESN'T MEAN YOU STOP TESTIFYING. BUT
[2:34:18] EVERY SEED OF GOD WILL RESPOND BECAUSE
[2:34:20] ALL THAT THE FATHER HAS GIVEN MUST COME.
[2:34:23] CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? SO STAND WITH
[2:34:25] CONFIDENCE THAT THIS MESSAGE IS REAL.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; That this message is powerful AND THIS
[2:34:30] MESSAGE WILL TAKE YOU FROM FAITH TO
[2:34:32] CHARITY AND ALL THE WAY TO THE RAPTURE,
[2:34:34] ALL THE WAY TO YOUR BODY CHANGE.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; CAN the church say amen?
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; Could it take a few minutes more?
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm almost done.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; And he said, therefore,
[2:34:53] verse 65 said, therefore said I unto you
[2:34:56] that no man could come unto me except
[2:34:58] they were given unto him of my father.
[2:35:01] And verse 66, here it is. AND FROM THAT
[2:35:05] TIME many of his disciples went back
[2:35:13] and walked no more with him.
[2:35:18] You see this friends?
[2:35:20] This is not walk away from eagles
[2:35:22] gathering. This is not walk away from a
[2:35:25] pastor. This is walk away from Jesus.
[2:35:28] You know
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; I want you to PICTURE THIS.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL THAT WAS IN GOD. HE POURED IT
[2:35:35] TO CHRIST.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; THAT CHRIST, THAT LORD,
[2:35:40] Jehovah of the old, JESUS OF THE NEW
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; STANDING THERE BREAKING BREAD, bringing
[2:35:45] clarity, unfolding revelation to them.
[2:35:48] And in THE FACE OF THAT, THEY walk away
[2:35:50] from HIM
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; HAVING SEEN MIRACLES, HAVING GOT
[2:35:54] TEACHINGS, AND THEY WALK AWAY FROM HIM.
[2:35:56] So why should it surprise you when
[2:35:58] people want to walk away FROM THE
[2:36:00] MESSAGE?
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY WALKED AWAY FROM HIM. YES.
[2:36:03] YES.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm putting it to you. There has to
[2:36:09] be a falling away. Brother Brandham
[2:36:10] taught us that.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; Because this rapture is not for
[2:36:13] everybody as much as we'd like it to be
[2:36:15] for everybody.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; This rapture is for those who meet the
[2:36:18] conditions of rapturing condition.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU PRESSURIZED ENOUGH?
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU AN ASTRONAUT?
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE THE AGE OF SPIRITUAL
[2:36:27] ASTRONAUTS. IF YOU NOT PRESSURIZED AND
[2:36:29] YOU CAN'T HANDLE THIS RAPTURE THING,
[2:36:31] YOUR your cargo,
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; IF IT ALREADY ABOARD THIS RAPTURE
[2:36:35] EXPRESS, YOU'RE STAYING HERE.
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; BUT AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE,
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; WE WILL DO WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; TO MAKE IT INTO THE RAPTURE.
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. FROM THAT TIME
[2:36:54] BREAKING OF THE BREAD, OPENING OF THE
[2:36:56] WORD, THE REVEALING OF THE MYSTERIES OF
[2:36:58] HIS IDENTITY, HIS PURPOSE, HIS PLAN,
[2:37:00] BECAUSE ALL OF THAT WAS COVERED UP TO
[2:37:02] THIS POINT.
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; All that the father GIVE MUST COME. I AM
[2:37:06] THE LIVING BREAD. IF IT DON'T COME TO
[2:37:08] ME, YOU CAN'T GET NOTHING. ALL OF THIS
[2:37:09] WAS PRESENTED and they couldn't handle
[2:37:11] it because they wanted the gospel of
[2:37:14] convenience, the gospel of bread,
[2:37:16] natural food, the gospel of miracles.
[2:37:19] And for many people, if they give
[2:37:20] miracles and food, they will come to
[2:37:22] church forever.
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; But now he was challenging them for
[2:37:25] their life
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; because to eat this flesh, drink this
[2:37:30] blood. Now it's a deeper level of
[2:37:32] commitment.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; Is a higher expectation from you.
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; From that time, many of his disciples
[2:37:43] went back and walked no more with him.
[2:37:45] Then Jesus said unto the 12, and I love
[2:37:47] this because many of us, you know,
[2:37:49] better said compassion is not feeling
[2:37:51] sorry for people.
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; Compassion is doing the will of God.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; We they're trying to pull ram and goat
[2:37:56] and ox into the church.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; We supposed to invite you now. But the
[2:38:06] reality is when a ox come into the
[2:38:08] church or a ram or a goat, they can't
[2:38:11] stay.
[2:38:13] is a hard SAYING
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ONLY LAMB COULD EAT THIS LAMB
[2:38:16] FOOD.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; Only eagles could GATHER AROUND WHERE
[2:38:19] THE CARCASS IS.
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; ONLY THE DOVE COULD DROP DOWN UPON A
[2:38:22] LAMB AND HE COULD STAY.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS NOT PLAYING GAMES. HE WATCHED
[2:38:27] 70 WALK AWAY.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; AND LOOKED AT THE REMAINING TEAM
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "WILL you go also?"
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; In other words, IF YOU WANT TO GO, GO.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; I know what I am. I KNOW WHO I am. I
[2:38:42] KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. I KNOW WHERE I
[2:38:44] COME FROM. I'VE TOLD YOU WHO I AM. I'VE
[2:38:47] TOLD YOU WHO WILL COME. I WOULD TOLD YOU
[2:38:49] WHERE WE GOING.
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; 70 WALK AWAY.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU GOING ALSO?
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; CAN the church say amen?
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, GOD NOT BEGGING ANYBODY
[2:39:04] TO WORSHIP HIM. GOD NOT BEGGING ANYBODY
[2:39:06] TO SERVE HIM. IT'S EITHER YOU HAVE A
[2:39:08] REVELATION OR YOU [screaming] DON'T HAVE
[2:39:10] A REVELATION. BUT IF YOU HAVE A
[2:39:12] REVELATION, THEN YOU COULD STAND. OH,
[2:39:15] GLORY.
[2:39:17] [cheering]
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HAVE A REVELATION, THEY DON'T
[2:39:23] PULL YOU. COME TO CHURCH. COME TO
[2:39:25] CHURCH. PRAISE GOD. WORSHIP. NO. YOUR
[2:39:28] REVELATION PUTS YOU IN A CERTAIN
[2:39:30] ATMOSPHERE.
[2:39:33] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T WAIT TO COME TO CHURCH. YOU
[2:39:36] CAN'T WAIT TO SERVE GOD. YOU CAN'T WAIT
[2:39:38] TO FORGIVE BECAUSE IT'S THE POWER
[2:39:40] [screaming] OF THE HOLY GHOST UPON YOUR
[2:39:42] REVELATION.
[2:39:47] [applause]
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; IT TAKES REAL REVELATION TO STAND WHEN
[2:39:54] OTHERS DON'T WANT IT.
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL AFFAIR.
[2:39:58] &gt;&gt; THOUGH 10,000 FALL ON THIS SIDE, A
[2:40:01] THOUSAND ON THIS SIDE, I SHALL NOT BE
[2:40:03] MOVED.
[2:40:08] THERE IS NOTHING YOU COULD SAY TO ME TO
[2:40:10] MOVE ME AWAY FROM THIS GOSPEL. THERE IS
[2:40:12] NOTHING YOU COULD PRESENT TO ME TO TAKE
[2:40:14] ME FROM THIS MESSAGE.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; IF THIS IS WRONG, I DON'T WANT TO BE
[2:40:18] RIGHT. THIS IS THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH IS
[2:40:21] WHAT WOULD SET US FREE.
[2:40:26] [cheering]
[2:40:34] HALLELUJAH.
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHO WALKS AWAY. IF THEY
[2:40:38] DON'T WANT IT MORE FOR ME, OH, COME ON,
[2:40:40] SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME. IF THEY
[2:40:42] DON'T WANT IT MORE FOR ME, HALLELUJAH.
[2:40:46] IF THEY DON'T WANT IT MORE FOR ME, I
[2:40:49] WILL TAKE THE ANOINTING. I WILL TAKE THE
[2:40:52] ATMOSPHERE. I WILL TAKE THE PROMISES.
[2:41:00] HALLELUJAH.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; LISTEN,
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT A PENTECOSTAL CHURCH.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT A DENOMINATIONAL GROUP. THIS
[2:41:09] IS THE ONLY TRUTH THAT EXISTS. THIS IS
[2:41:11] JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF. [cheering]
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; THE SON OF MAN VEILED IN A SON OF MAN
[2:41:17] STOOD AS LIVING BREAD TO US PRESENT IN
[2:41:21] POWER.
[2:41:27] REVEALING
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; THE THOUGHT AND INTENTS OF THE HEART,
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; TYING UP THE LOOSE ENDS,
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; CHURCH, YOU MAY BE SEATED.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM COULDN'T DO IT,
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS THE SON OF MAN
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; VEILED IN A SON OF MAN.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; HE CAME HIMSELF. [screaming]
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; I AM THE LIVING BREAD. I AM THE ONE. IF
[2:41:46] YOU COME TO ME, YOU'LL GET THE HOLY
[2:41:47] [screaming] GHOST. IF YOU COME TO ME,
[2:41:50] YOU'LL GET BACK YOUR JOY. IF YOU COME TO
[2:41:52] ME, YOU'LL GET YOUR HEALING. YOU COME TO
[2:41:55] ME, YOU'LL GET THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:42:09] HALLELUJAH.
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; SO THE QUESTION STILL STANDS THIS
[2:42:17] MORNING.
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; WILL YOU GO ALSO? WILL YOU GO BACK TO
[2:42:20] THE WORLD? WILL YOU GO BACK TO HOW IT
[2:42:23] WAS YEARS AGO? WILL YOU GO BACK TO YOUR
[2:42:24] OLD DOCTRINE, TO YOUR OLD BELIEF? OR
[2:42:27] WILL YOU GO TO THE RAPTURE? I SAY, "COME
[2:42:29] AND GO WITH ME TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE.
[2:42:32] COME AND GO WITH ME TO THE PROMISED
[2:42:34] LAND. IT'S FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY.
[2:42:38] THERE'S HEALING IN THE LAND. THERE'S
[2:42:40] DELIVERANCE IN THE LAND. THERE'S MERCY
[2:42:42] IN THE LAND. [screaming] THERE'S POWER
[2:42:44] IN THE LAND.
[2:42:48] HALLELUJAH.
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; IF GOD IS GOD, SERVE HIM. IF GOD IS GOD,
[2:43:05] WORSHIP HIM. IF GOD IS GOD, PRAISE HIM.
[2:43:08] [cheering]
[2:43:08] YOU WANT TO GO, [screaming] YOU COULD
[2:43:10] GO. BUT WE ARE NOT LEAVING.
[2:43:13] WE ARE RESTING ON THIS. THIS IS US. THIS
[2:43:17] IS WHO WE ARE. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE.
[2:43:20] [screaming] THIS IS WHAT WE STAND FOR.
[2:43:22] [cheering]
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU TASTE THE LIVING BREAD,
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; QUAO CAN'T STOP IT.
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; KISS BREAD HAVE NOTHING ON IT. YOUR
[2:43:35] BAKERY HAVE NOTHING ON IT. THIS IS NOT
[2:43:37] BREAD FROM NO OR THIS IS THE LIVING
[2:43:39] BREAD. WHEN YOU EAT OF THIS THING, WHEN
[2:43:42] YOU EAT OF THIS THING, IT PUTS FIRE IN
[2:43:45] YOUR BONES. [screaming]
[2:43:46] FIRE IN YOUR BONES.
[2:43:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; LISTEN,
[2:44:05] &gt;&gt; it have food AND YOU'RE EATING FOOD.
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; YOU move the front.
[2:44:10] You never had that.
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; THEY SAID WHEN THEY GO BY THE FOOD, THEY
[2:44:13] eat the food. So you MOVE WITH THAT
[2:44:15] SMILE.
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; THEY SAY, "WHY YOU SO HAPPY?" BOY, THAT
[2:44:17] FOOD GOOD BOY. That food good. That food
[2:44:18] good.
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; And I CAN TELL YOU YOUNG PERSON, YOU
[2:44:23] TASTE THIS LIVING BREAD. THIS FOOD GOOD.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; THIS FOOD REAL GOOD.
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[2:44:29] IT'LL GIVE YOU JOY.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; WHY YOU COME TO CHURCH LOOKING SAD? THE
[2:44:34] LIVING BREAD WILL PUT A SMILE ON YOUR
[2:44:36] FACE. [cheering]
[2:44:39] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE LIVING BREAD.
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; PAUL COULD SAY, "DEATH, WHERE'S YOUR
[2:44:51] STING? GRAVE, WHERE'S YOUR VICTORY?"
[2:44:54] BECAUSE THE BREAD I'M EATING. THIS
[2:44:56] LIVING BREAD IS BREAD FOR ETERNAL LIFE.
[2:44:59] &gt;&gt; I CAN LAY THIS BODY DOWN AND PICK IT UP
[2:45:02] AGAIN.
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; WHY?
[2:45:11] &gt;&gt; Because of the diet.
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Atkins
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; or keto diet.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; None of that kind of diet.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; You see this living bread diet.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; THIS LIVING BREAD DIET
[2:45:32] &gt;&gt; DOES TAKE CANCER AND BREAK IT. THIS
[2:45:34] LIVING BREAD DIET, LET'S TAKE HIGH BLOOD
[2:45:37] PRESSURE AND BREAK IT.
