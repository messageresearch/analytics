sick among us and touch the and set the captive free and break the bands of wickedness and evil father may apport your love among your people this morning take all the evil out those connected lives may deal with their hearts and jesus my ask it email him and god bless you before you have your seats i'll get it turned into two personal scriptures this morning welcome praise the lord uh first john chapter four i want to read verse one one verse there and first thessalonians chapter five i want to read from verse 14 to 23. first john 4 1 says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world i read from first thessalonians five i'm going to read from verse 14. now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophet signs prove all things and hold fast that which is good abstine from all appearance of evil and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ may god bless his word let's pray one more time father we thank you for the scriptures you know what's up in my heart this morning lord and i pray that the holy spirit will take it and and speak to the people father take me out of the way i may they hear direct from you this morning in jesus my ask it amen you may be seated god bless you and thanks for coming out praise god what a time what a year 2021 2020 was one for the books i guess everybody was looking for an exit out of 2020 but we still we're still in that channel of of getting things together and god is good and this year for the oldest night service we had the gates of hell shall not reveal against this last day bride and i believe that would have been still some level of confidence that god will take care of you and the battles that you're in right now is only temporary all what you go to is temporary if you could only see that temporary trials temporary discontemporary just temp oh praise god you're fighting to live and you're living today oh hallelujah and then we have another message but isaac divine strategy versus principalities powers rulers and spiritual weakness then we have the bright reproach for believing this revealed promise of dynamics then we are divine power versus principalities powers rulers and spiritual so we could see that the platform for this year is already the battleground and a battlefield for true warfare praise the name of the lord and then brother anthony my soul dot wheat oh hallelujah you have to wait upon the lord you can't force anything you can't manufacture anything and then drive them out as a powerful one drive them out i'll not watch them drive them out all the enemies try them all the hittites jebusites you have to drive them out that's the authority you have you can sit down and get beat up drive them out it's your land start trouble in it but use your land will nobody move you out your land don't you know complex and sit back praise god drag them out glory to god try them more to your heart drive them onto your home drag them out to your spirit make yourself a christian not a cushion for the devil to stick inside of you a christian or give the lord some praises hallelujah then they have the bride a super church a super race as we should near the headstone but a stephen oh praise what a blessing hallelujah then we had little by little and god told them little by little you would take the land go and wear your take and you can't maintain what you take when you take piece of land you have to maintain it plant it grow it put something on it pray let the philistines know somebody don't take it and occupy it already if you don't take it and possess it and clean it up and maintain it you're going to lose it oh glory to god for any any place that you possess don't lose it don't lose it take it little by little if they never praise god before praise him this morning take back your praises oh god you wanna raise his hand and i'll shake it keep that for yourself say amen say hallelujah say praise god oh hallelujah praise god let him shake and be in the catholic church in the baptist church in a metal don't bring it here let everything you have bread praise god god had dead he's alive glory to god hallelujah blessed be the lord and then last sunday the two spirits working within the framework of the church and paul said perilous time shall come men shall be lovers of their own self he talked about church members any message heady and hyman minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god where your love you love more than god you will love precious more than love of god depression's gonna run out you know and you're still at the meet this god we're talking about here oh hallelujah praise god and then wednesday night was the lamb and the dove isn't that something praise god not the lamb and the wolf not the lamb and the snake the lamb and the dove and all this message and preaching is to crush you praise god like the special that police is the pauline sang thank you says napoleon whatever it takes for my will to break god had to break your will you're too intact you're too whole you're too messaging oh hallelujah praise god you hear what i said you're too messagey that's what jesus finds a bunch of people in moses message holland and he rocked them from the very foundation because he had something to bring he wanted income to bring pots and pans he come to bring the kingdom of god oh glory to god he called a bunch of men ordinary men looking like you hallelujah and promised to put the kingdom in them he said he's not with you but shall be in you give me a shout in the house not sitting on the church bench this thing has to come inside of you oh god look get me started this morning glory look god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god god did make no mistake when he said let us make man in our image in all likeness and let them have dominion god made no mistake when he said that the devil is a liar this morning or whatever fall has been restored the book that i am lost has been restored i have a right to be free i have a right to be empowered i have a right to be anointed i have a right to be inspired i have a right to possess the gates of the enemy or give the lord a shoulder look at me like you don't know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about [Music] [Applause] glory to god my god amen in the prayer meeting on friday june meeting we talked about david how did many of you come and burn down zig lag david 70 lord david wasn't gambling and smoking and carrying on partying you say the lord and sometimes you're driving the lord on something go off-key they cried till they couldn't cry no more the weep they weren't going to weep them all till they weep they start to repress they want to stone david maybe if i didn't take this journey i wouldn't have this condition around me and then david encouraged himself in the lord and sometimes you just have to do that there's no deacon to encourage you there's no elder to encourage you there's no past encourage you you've got to encourage yourself wake up this is not children thing no this is big man stuff this is big woman stuff this is sun and torches of god's stuff there's no scallywag stuff glory to god when david sent for the effort he had one question he said lord they take it they take my wives shall i push you what shall i say and moped the rest a bunch whom open god tell him pursue i don't want to show you something you think god couldn't strike them philistine dead he could have but it was taken from david and david had to take it back oh glory to god how many feel what i feel this morning devil take your family you have a right you have my right i'm not hearing you you have a right take it back and when david went and started to ride the horse when he looked over the hill there they were there no you write all night long you had to overtake them so many men get tired they couldn't cross the book so sometimes you're writing hard and yeah make it but somebody is making it to get your victory somebody is backing you in prayer somebody lift me up in prayer pray for your brother pray for your sister you know what hell they going through you don't know what demon attacking their mind and their spirit and their body you don't know what their children given they don't know what hell season on the roof pray for them let god get ambushments that's why we praise god in front for quarters and ambushments that's why we come to worship no no dead message song that can't bring no anointing we want the songs that will bring an atmosphere give me a shout give me your prayers inside the house [Applause] okay all right let's get started let's go to work all right let's have a tile this morning have discernment prove all things that's the title this morning have discernment prove all things and have an inspiration a spiritual awakening to this illness that's the inspiration of spiritual awakening to this illness so the prophet was talking about woman bob and here and so on like that he said we need to discern it by the word the word is right take god's word god word is always right we can't deserve by what people think what intelligence tells us what psychiatrist tells us we have got to go by what god says man channeling by bread alone by every word that proceedeth the mouth of god not designing the lord's body many are weak and sickly many are asleep spiritually dead the last plague that hit egypt was dead the last plague they are going to hit the church is spiritual that they are books on faith but they're dead they're going into the church but they're dead spiritual that you're not the same amen but they're dead there's the last play you have to run from that you know run from spiritual death you know you want to know you're alive unto god you're quickened unto righteousness you're quickened to the word every time i come behind this people are fighting for my life are you running from death are you running from the normal casual i don't want to be like that that's why you go too far back 20 years ago that too far i want to know what god doing last night i want to know what god doing this morning i can't afford to go far back he's the same yesterday and today this morning i don't have tomorrow i have right now no faith is i do have yesterday yesterday go on tomorrow i don't know what couldn't take training out may have an earthquake tomorrow but you see though you see right now i could get healed this morning i could get delivered this morning fire could shut up in my bones right this morning yes yes yes yes yes you can get a revival in your system this morning right now oh give the lord a praise offer all right what we needed today is a spiritual awakening a spiritual awakening to this woman prophet said that now here we go our eternal destination is not all together determined by what we see or what we hear but it is determined on what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear so eternal destination is based upon the designment of what you see and what you hear you see that woman at the well when she came to jesus she said our father and this and she talking religious talk he said go call your husband she says sir and she when she tell him when he told her about her condition she says sir i perceive you a prophet oh glory to god and jesus tell her i that's speaking to you am he he reveal himself to a prostitute woman oh glory to god and leave them church members all by themselves we'll give the lord some praises you know why her name is in the book and she has a desert meant to know she was a predestinated seed not by her flesh not by a spirit but what was inside her soul and i cash out and i can't praise god you've got to be kidding is the greatest message to strike the earth look how much of them false prophets still have a bunch of people following them all over the world false prophets dead false hear one of them said not because the man prophecy fault he's a false prophet so not because a man like another liar not a man still a man stealing another teeth the prophesied force but another false prophet force false prophets are not people any message following their foolishness to you yeah yeah like i keep donald trump and same trump god is not a republican as i might see the devil only republican and satan only democrats pick one you know i said satan running democrats and the devil running the republicans pick one they are crazy mucho loco they plumb off the beaten path hallelujah so watch your discernment of what you hear and what you see so this morning service i hope it addresses three things for you three things three specific things one it make you stop what you're doing it makes you continue what you are doing or what makes you change what you are doing there are some things you will know you have to stop then stop it if you're in position and engage continue and if you know you need to change it say god put it in me to change it so every service should bring you to that to examine yourself on second corinthians 13 5 says examine yourselves whether ye be in the fate prove your own selves know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except to be reprobates but i trust that he shall know that we are not reprobates now i pray to god that you do know evil not that we should appear approved but that you should know what is honest though we be not though we be as reparates for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth for we are glad when we are weak and we are strong this also we wish even for your perfection therefore i write these things being absent least being present i should use sharpness according to the power which the lord had given me to edification and not the destruction find me my brethren farewell just paul speaking be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you that is paul speaking could we say amen now let's run that scripture in the amplified and you'll see a fuller meaning of it paul was saying examine and test and evaluate your own selves to see whether you are holding to your feet and showing the proper fruits of it test and prove yourself not christ do you not yourself realize and know thoroughly by increasing experience that jesus christ is in you unless you are counterfeit disapproved on trial and rejected but i hope you will recognize and know we are not disapproved on trial and rejected he said i pray to god that you may do nothing wrong not in order that we our teaching may appear to be approved but that you may continue to do it right so he's saying it's not that you've indicated over teaching is right but he wants you to continue doing what is right he said though we may seem to have failed and be unapproved for we can do nothing against the truth not save any party or personal interest but only for the truth which is the gospel but we are glad that when we are weak unapproved and you are really strong and this we also pray for your all-wrong strengthen and perfecting your soul so paul was saying in other words this is not about me even if i am weak i want you to be strong i want you to be approved i want this thing for you and that is why i said the fifo ministry is not for themselves is that what men are saying on the throne is for the perfection of the saints come on now for the work of the ministry come on now for the idea you are so important to god go to the fine man beat them up roll them over fix them up to get that word to you give the lord a show [Applause] let me escape what is his inmate the ability to decide between truth and error right and wrong the ability to think scripturally search the scriptures judge everything by the scriptures and that's why i said prove all things and we'll fasten that which is good training [Music] this here's something to run with it not investigating to prove it but our responsibility is to prove all things and if a good holy fast don't let it go that that grip you hold it fast isn't that right why because many false prophets have gone out into the world many thousands because false prophets are spiritual when them spirit fallen and 400 prophets elijah they almost line a line spirit as permission to drop on all of them and when all of them get the same anointing all them provide the same thing the importance of discernment hallelujah that he wouldn't be misled oh my so therefore discernment is not just between right and wrong and error and truth this true discernment not is only distinguishing between right and wrong or good and evil it means distinguishing from what is important from what is most important this distinction assists you in prioritizing what you do now for what you leave later that is what this evening is all about how could we give the lord some praises this difference this discernment makes show you what is temporary and what is permanent so you can decide what you want to put your vote on what you want to put your strength on isn't that right it means between distinguishing good and better even better and best between good and perfect oh hallelujah hallelujah between church member and bride that's his ailment oil and oil is what you want hallelujah you must have it isn't that right and the psalmist david in psalms 1 1966 says thou has dealt well with thy seven to lord according to thy word okay let me just get that back one second only good psalms 119 and a 66. teach me good judgment and knowledge for i have believed thy commandments and the amplified he said teach me good judgment wise and right designment and knowledge for i believe and trusted and relied on and clung to your commandments oh hallelujah so this is a prayer that david had and this is a prayer that you must have to give your designment oh glory to god in all areas of your life if some husbands have diseasement they want to treat their wife differently if some wives had discernment they might have responded to the husband differently and things might be different in that very home you need discernment that's why the bible talks about dwelling with a woman with wisdom we need discernment or give the lord some praises glory to god you need these certain men to see if that is the right business partner to get because someone as crooked as you could get or give the lord some praise as you need the hand of god in your life praise god the right person to choose the right person to respond to you need discernment or give the lord some praises hallelujah in all areas of your life you need it glory to god amen hallelujah praise god certain discernment it doesn't mean judgmental it doesn't mean that because matthew 7 1 jesus said judge not this is in red that shall be not be judged for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged and without measure ye meet it shall be measured to you again and why be holy though the moat in thy brother's eye but consider it's not the being that is an own eye hold those heads to thy brother let me pull out the mood of the night and behold a beam is in thine own the hypocrite who has cast out the beam out of thy own eye and though shall see clearly the castle remote which is my brother's eye so this in the amplified says do not judge and criticize and condemn others so that you may not be judged and criticized and condemned yourself for just as you judge and criticize and condemn others you will be judged and criticized and condemned and in accordance with the measure you deal with others it shall be dealt out to you oh glory to god so that has been judgmental but what he's talking about i'm continuing wrong in verse six now give not which is holy unto the dogs neither cast your poor before swine leave they trample them on the feet and they turn against you so you say have discernment and don't cast the person before shrine you have to have a desert as a swine and there's a dog and you wouldn't put what is precious to them or give the lord some praises do you understand what jesus is saying here oh glory to god your dessert will protect you i wouldn't waste your time with some people waste your time oh glory to god no caster pull before swine oh hallelujah praise be to jesus thank you lord jesus do you love him so discernment comes like a protection discernment oh praise god oh hallelujah give it the liberty praise god won't go into some stuff i could tell you some stuff but let it go a brother years ago but i just know i'm talking about he blamed me of a prophetic anointing upon him so when i came in the room and he talking and he talked in his channel and whatnot he said don't doubt me and he talking this with our next brother in doing so and when i reached that the lord spoke to my heart he said he have an old pentecostal prophet's prayers on him don't listen to him and i and he and he um i say you have all pentecostal prophet spirit and don't listen to him never listen to him today he's out there in the world normal but he calls so much a havoc with the spirit because people fear him because he said you have a gift to cast our devils and he have a gift that he deserves and never give to this and i watch them guys so you have to go by the discernment and god will prove it is right or wrong hallelujah are you with me oh praise and lord proverbs 14 says as corner secret wisdom and finds it not but knowledge is easy unto him that understand it go from the presence of a foolish man when thou perceive us not in him the lips of knowledge the wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way but the folly of fools is deceit let's look at the amplified than that a scoffer sees wisdom in vain for his very attitude blinds and deafens him to it but knowledge is easy to him who is teachable and understands go from the presence of a foolish and self-confident man for you will not find knowledge on his lips the wisdom godly wisdom which is comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of god of the prudent is to understand his way but folly or self-confidence is fools is to deceive so our prayer should be psalm 119 125 i am thy servant give me understanding that i may know thy testimonies and the amplified said i am your servant give me understanding discernment and comprehension that i may know which is discern and be familiar with the character of your testimonies we need this element and i trust this give you a quick name an awakening to something called spiritual discernment oh give the lord a shout in the house hallelujah glory to god so let's go but the man i'm praying from this limit of spirit you saw heavenly father i want to express if i can this morning how in my heart i feel towards one the holiest of holy coming down to the earth and to redeem a sinner like myself and i'm sure that these ministers that are present now can feel the same way that it was by your grace that we have been made the ministers of this covenant thou has given with adam foreign and we are here this morning father gathered for no other purpose but to know and to study to know the will of god that we must do or make christ real to the people of this generation surely that in this day of judgment we will be brought face to face with this generation and being ministers we will be judges and the people to which we are spoken to and their attitude towards the word that we bring them will determine their eternal destination therefore lord in that day we would be a judge for or against the generation that we preach to father god please through jesus name let us not say one word that would be wrong but may we have sincere hearts and open minds that we might receive the things that's yours that we might be able to go out into our different fields of work after today and be better equipped because of our meeting with you this morning granted lord won't you come and be our speaker and our ears and our tongue and our thoughts let the meditation of my heart and thoughts of my mind all is your humble brown praying he's so clean and and clear he's praying he said we might leave here this morning so filled with the holy spirit that we will be no more determined than ever before to carry the message to the dying generation that we're living in lord we speak through us to thy word in jesus name so this year is the core on the main part of this menu here this morning that i want to get into i wonder today who is going to be the next president the election is coming up this is his time here and you know who is going to be president this next term what if i knew there's only one that does know and that's god what if god would reveal to me who is going to be the next president and i stood here in phoenix and made a prediction that such and such a man would be an expressed united states and they were placed in newspapers and so forth i would hit it right on the dot it would be perfect it will be all that i said would come to pass but what good would it do what good is it anyhow if i should do such a thing the papers would advertise it it would go out maybe and such a person would make such a prediction it would be true all newspapers magazines would pass it on but you know what that god doesn't do things like that god doesn't use his power and his gifts for foolishness [Applause] it's going to be whatever president it will be and to know which would be president wouldn't help us one penny that's why i say the devil in charge of democrats and seated and charged with republicans it wouldn't help us to for any or give the lord some praises so i am hooking up promising with no prophecy with trump and hooking the prophecy with nobody but no they might save god peoples all of them he wouldn't do us one better good to know who is going to be president so therefore god doesn't do things like that if i made such a prediction as that and it comes to pass and the newspapers packed it and the magazine then it would be to my glory people would say look what a great prophet brother branham is he told us long before it happened who would be president and what would be to my glory but god doesn't want that he's not interested in working things to my glory god is not interested in working things to my glory or any other man's glory he's interested to work things to his glory oh glory to god and that's why he said paul said do i speak with the tongues of men and angels oh glory to god hallelujah if we speak with tongues and do not have interpreter what good does it do we need to glorify ourselves so whatever it is it wouldn't do a bit of good to tell it would be best for me just to keep still if i didn't know not to try to publish it because there would be no reason for me to do it cause it's going to be anyhow and it doesn't make much of a difference who is going to be president let's continue so there's a backdrop now so god when he uses his gifts he uses them for his own glory and for the glory of his people for the glory of his church for the defining of the body of christ for the glory of the kingdom of god that is why he gives these things in his church why he has teachers and prophets and evangelists and pastors they are for the edification of the church and for the glory of god the prophet is not to get out and mingle with the world try to take a gift like balaam did and make havoc or money out of it no i think it's a good thing for us as ministers to follow our order when we see such things in the world as we see today and we have an order from god is for discerning of spirits he called it try the spirits we read the scripture from first john 4 1 try the spirits isn't that right he says don't watch he says now and we have our order from god this on god now is for discerning of spirits try the spirit and i believe that a very good lesson for the church today is to try the spirit of anything of of anything have discernment of spirit i do not think that we should ever by any means ever try to judge a person by the denomination to belong to or by the group that they've assembled with whether they be methodist baptist presbyterian pentecostal or whatever they are we should never say never never judge a man by the denomination he belongs to we should always judge him by the spirit he has oh give the lord a shout [Applause] always because inside here we have three kind of believers and more so you can't judge this church by one cuckoo one not case you can't judge it like that you have to judge people by their spirit or glory to god so you can understand why the prophet said are rather a man wrong in doctrine and right in his spirit than to be right and doctrine and wrong in spirit is your spirit [Applause] not your teaching not your daughter's spirit very important they wanted a rebuke but a man of her sister playing piano which is just a little short she said but you say but she have a fighting spirit you're going to have them with a long dress trainer right on the ground on this place the spirit terrible okay we give the lord a shout out so we have to whether he is lattering for marine inner altering knowing whatever it might be we should never judge him like that but by his spirit we are to discern spirits watch what the manner is mine what is he trying to achieve if the man here we go this is important you know all this is part of the warfare all this is part of the the the upon this rock i've built my all this is part of that okay so listen to this here we go all right you see now if i want to get this to the show this morning which is different denominations you are here you are still the church of the living god together and this is the thing i want to get to you that we are not really divided we are stones that are cut in different forms all to the glory of god you see so god shaped some people that i'm saying god use penny sometimes the car you say we are all like changed in godhead some are silver dollars some are pennies but god uses penny sometimes so you can't dismiss depending you can't miss dismiss which one because god used them god use them to baptize some some people win you to the lord and not even wrong why think about that somebody get you to the gospel and they're not even they're boxing and you're still wrong god use them to get to you you can't condemn them god made a way for you to get that breakthrough isn't that right so watch so there's so much in the day here we go that we live in pertinent gifts so many people judge people by gifts that they have well i believe these things are gifts i believe what we see take place is gifts and they're god-given gifts but if we do not use them in the right way that god intended them to be used then we do more harm with the gifts than we should if we did not have the gifts the other night i made a statement in the purpose saying i would rather see brotherly love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of divine healing or anything else and if you talk about brotherly kindness now they think of that light thing that vial sees trumpets woes woman in the sun this is rather have broadly love than praise god healing and i've broken here is another quote from the with our fellowship i would rather have a church listen just a moment i would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with christ i would rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church now that might sound high in a pentecostal group but i would rather have it where there is gifts they will feel where there is gifts there will bring confusion where there is gift they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect [Applause] and if you have perfect love you will have perfect gifts so work with love first and hear the bomb that brings fellowship and fellowship bring gifts come on give the lord a shout oh glory to god i'll feel a fire on that one glory to god work with love first [Applause] so you see how the devil called people aside and had them in the corner by the self that is not different from the guy who called up any mountain thinking a lord coming jesus calling for him to go any mountain reasoning becoming a lord you see but love have to bring fellowship and love the commandment brethren first charity begins at home if you can't love who you see how you go love god who you can't see you don't have to love me love your brother love your sister jesus even tell him my all men shall know that you are my disciples when they could argue and fuss no when you have loved one for another love is not talk love is expressed love is something to feel love is something to experience glory to god hallelujah [Applause] how are you talking men have to talk bull language [Music] that we are talking about language that by god have the prophet to forget his gun when he personally feels ridiculable you say if he had the gun shoot the bull peter but god wanted to speak the language of love and the only way we could do that to set it up that there is nothing to rest back on so he carries back on the gun he carries back on the human element he says something came over him something have to come over you it was the love of god glory to god the bull coming down for him and he could talk to the bull but understand the language it wasn't words it was the power or give the lord a shout it was more than talking to bull oh not just talking to the letter it was love spirit hey [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now if a man comes and he has a great gift no matter if it belongs to our denomination or another denomination don't judge him by what denomination he comes from how he dresses what you want to see is what he's trying to do with that gift what purpose he has if he's trying to take his influence and build himself a great name out of it i'll have this element of spirit enough to know that's wrong amen no matter how great a teacher he is how powerful he is how intellectual he is how his gift operates if it isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of christ your own spiritual dissident will tell you that's wrong no matter how accurate how perfect how it is it is wrong if it is not used for the body of jesus christ to achieve something maybe he's got a great gift that he could draw people together with great intellectual or spiritual power that he could draw people together and maybe he's trying to take the gift and make himself famous so you have a big name so that other prejudice look up to him as some big person that's wrong that's why saying have no uh sub man some son of man and lois other man a new son of man and i explain a man god sent one prophet elijah to turn her hearts back to the faith of the father and until we get back to the faith of the fathers we have finished fulfilling the message yet he elijah gonna turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers and the father fathers wasn't talk it was silver and gold have i none such as i have that was the fate of the fathers oh glory the faith of the fathers wrought i'm not a book of acts and no man was in charge of the book of ass could we give the lord a shout oh glory to god hallelujah praise god are you with me maybe he is trying to edify a certain thing and he wants everybody else to get out of the picture and let him and his group be the picture that is wrong regardless of how annoying anointing is or how revelation you would how much revelation you have how many mysteries you have if you're trying to shave you know so anytime i hear a man saying a group or what he have is the bride like trouble there's confusion because it's not working so no man can have the bride the bride is a mystery it's the mystical body of jesus christ you can't lock down the mystical body of jesus christ nobody could head the bright that is madness nobody can be in charge of the bride we have one head christ is that head and that head is hell of he coming down atop the pyramid give the lord our show glory to god glory hallelujah all right so here it is now watch now if he has a gift of god and he's trying to edify the body of christ then i don't care what it belongs to you are not discerning the man you are deserting the spirit the life that's in the man what god told us to do not one time was we ever commissioned to deserve the man's group but we was constrained and commanded by god to deserve the spirit in the man what he's trying to do what the spirit in his life is trying to lead him and then here we go if we find out he's trying to lead the people not to break them up but to bring them together and to bring to the church of the living god not all to one denomination but to an understanding one a fellowship to and a unity of spirit there will know what be one group internationally that will not exist oh glory to god but we get our fellowship we can come to unity the spirit we fight in the same devil we fight in the same war we're looking for the same promise what promised the promise of the father oh glory to god the promise of the holy ghost the promise of dynamics to the mechanics praise god i appreciate it all these years are still preaching it oh glory to god we're going to have it oh glory to god the sick will be healed there'll be one more ride nothing going to stop it a super church a super bright as we near the headstone oh give the lord some praises hallelujah so you're looking for this then if he is for marine lazarene whatever it is his spirit and his purpose is right and the spirit that's in him no matter what move he belongs to the spirit that's in him is trying to point the people to calvary away from himself away from anything else but his own achievement he has he's pointing the calvary he doesn't care whether he's even known or not he doesn't care whether even his own movement which is fine he doesn't care what is he trying to do the purpose of his heart what he's trying to get when you see what is the man life whether his motives his denomination is so his denomination when it's for himself whether it's for worldly fame whether it's a big name i predicted that come to pass you see that's wrong right there if he's trying to use what god gave him as a teacher or a prophet or a seer now the new testament prophet is the preacher we all know that he said every man ought to have a church home you ought to have a place not just a flute or wrong compel at the post have somewhere where you go to church where you call it your church somewhere you pay your tights somewhere where you help support the cause take your choice here we go here's the partner but then don't never disfellowship the other man because he doesn't belong with your group discern his spirit and see if he's got the same purpose in heart then you got fellowship one with another we are working for one great cause that's the cause of christ oh blessed be the name of the lord you love him second peter too it says but there were false prophets among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that brought them and bring them upon themselves swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of said amplified but in those days they arose false prophets among the people just as there will be false teachers among yourselves who will suckly and stealthily introduce heretical doctrines destructive heresies even denying and disowning the master who brought them and bringing upon themselves with destruction oh my so watch the scripture says if it's contrary but to my fate and yet the scripture says so the scripture is right and i am wrong the scripture is always right and the only way you can do anything is come back to the scripture you see people know what baram say but they don't know what the scriptures say but he came to reveal the scripture he came to brought the revealed word oh glory to god he couldn't bring nothing outside the word so when the angel came to him he had to check out what the angels say with the scripture could we give the lord a shout that's why paul said if an angel come from heaven and preach any other gospel paul is saying i come back and try to change the gospel let me be a chris oh glory to god the time chained where your first say because what you said is god oh hallelujah are you with me thank you lord jesus no watch now wait prove all things whole faster that which is good when anything is proven it will be even proven right or wrong there's no in between so when we say have this element and prove all things when is this proven is that that right or wrong have no in between half right half wrong it doesn't have that you know it has to be dusty at the lord it has to be god said so isn't that right all right so watch so when anything is proven the question we should prove it until you find out what is right and when you find out what is right hold fast and always grip it don't turn it loose no it is possible here we go that staunch christians fine people whole sometimes things that are wrong they hold to the wrong thing thinking it is right and then these things should be proven whether they are right or wrong and it is the duty of all of us as we're expecting to go to him when jesus comes and is the minister's duty when a question is brought up that he solves this out and then proves it before the people that they might understand because no one wants to be found holding the wrong thing now watch this is 20 years of no denomination their dying lamb may never do that if i go in this generation may the people who believe this message never stand still for the nomination you will die right in your truck remember the very hour that you mentioned denomination among you i don't care how sincere you are you take a man for your leader instead of the holy spirit to confirm this word that's the hour you die the genuine seed cannot because there is nothing left after the seed it's the same thing was back there in the beginning it's the bride that fell into the ground to bring forth the corner wheat again how many understand that the original church was the corner of the belonging to the ground how many understand the seven church ages was just processes to bring us back to the original seed how many understand alpha and omega is the same how many stand the same pride that was in the beginning could be the pride that he ended nothing less than that oh glory to god that's why the bible said when a church is believing the holy ghost is just as real because the same holy ghost that struck them on pentecost have to strike the bride in the last days [Applause] and all this press come down and united nations then waiting for rain too the whole world waiting for rain los angeles have to sink that breathing for rain too because it's a seed to spend all the more and we are waiting for rain too oh glory to god a perfect man's seed that was planted inside of you and i [Applause] oh my hallelujah glory ephesians 6 10 to 14 the amplified in conclusion be strong in the lord be empowered through your union with him draw strength from him and strength which is boneless might provide put on the whole armor the armor of a heavy armed shoulder which god supplies that you may be able to successfully to stand up against all the strategies and the deceits of the devil for we wrestle us against flesh and blood containing only with physical opponents but against despotism against powers against the master spirits who are the world rulers of this present darkness against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly supernatural sphere therefore put on the whole complete armor that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day of danger and having done all the stand stand stand therefore hold your ground having tightened the belt of truth around your loins have alone put on the breastplate of integrity the moral attitude and right standing with god oh glory to god and said that is right oh my precious faith precious glorious faith god give me faith by faith abraham this is the prophet by faith isaac by faith abel of the god a more excellent sacrifice my desire in this life i want more faith and for this new year coming is more faith in god god take away any doubts that's in my mind if there's anyone arise satan fights at me he fights at you he tries to shoot his arrows but may i have that shield of faith always before me to withstand the wise of the devil oh glory to god are you with me this morning glory to god hallelujah he said we have played church for years and years but it all has come now when janice and jambis will withstand moses it's going to be a spiritual battle a conflict and there will be some just continue on the denominational church will just move right on into nomination and go on the way it goes but i mean the real true believer is coming to that battlefield and you better be versed and know what you're doing or you will take an evil spirit so easy and not know oh glory to god you're coming to what a battlefield not coming to a church bench not coming to this church not coming to a church pew you're coming into a genuine war oh glory the prophet knew we have hard times ahead last day was tough it have tougher times coming a pressure is coming cut shutting on the churches are coming it will take our power to be among the people oh glory to god but i'm not here to declare jesus christ god will set it up that way that you have to declare jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh hallelujah praise god amen may be seated satan knows that reasoning and where reasoning is to be an effectual witness of his resurrection this is good this is very good to be an effectual witness of his resurrection he knows satan it will take the holy ghost because man can't do these things so he equipped his army with the holy ghost to do those things to make known the secrets of the heart as he promised you can't do that with any kind of training you've got to do it by the baptism of the holy spirit the armor of god so the baptism is the armor so when he said put on the whole armor he's saying put on the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism the holy ghost is from faith to charity oh give the lord a show [Applause] [Music] he said to he said this is the evening light to make hebrews to tonight a reality it would take more than a train you can read words and read words and read words it will never make it come to pass until you have the holy ghost here to manifest that oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics the spirit of god that move him do the same thing he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride so he said john 14 12 the same works that i do shall do also i will give a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics and the world will not be able to withstand it the books and tips is one thing but this dynamics that come into charge of the bride the world will not be able to withstand it he said the power will be so much it can't even stay alone it will shake and shake until the graves shake open glory to god we take the power of god to do that hallelujah you say you can that's the eastern message dynamics and mechanics together the mechanics with all the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics with other mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do you any good it only works as they come together one will set still and the other one will go up and that's the only thing there is to it that's the only thing there is to it they are both look like alike they both came to be churches they both claim to be pride one has mechanics and dynamics and bring it to pass oh glory to god don't look at me like a crazy there between a bed one take and one left there between a field one take and one left oh i have not one church taken on the other church left is an individual affair i ain't gambling at all i am putting my salvation in the hands of no man oh give the lord a shout i have put in this dynamic in the hands of no man i am putting this promise in the hands of no man no money promises god promised it all right to rejoice and shout oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory i'm gonna be seated when the spirit hit jesus he said the spirit law is upon me for he has anointed me praise god to bring good tidings and to set that captivity those that are born to freedom oh glory come to freedom since another tied up and tangled up if you're tired of danger this morning the holy ghost is here to free you to break the chains around you to bust you out of the prison oh gloria got a big time prison break oh glory hallelujah i'm almost done [Music] hallelujah hallelujah real power brother real power glory to god not books on paper real power the power promised in them books and tapes the power promise and prophesy super church super race hallelujah [Music] all glory you say that's the report of god mechanics and dynamics it's the spirit that quickens it's the spark that fires it's not the gas that fires it's the spark that fires the gas see you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things oh hallelujah i only do that which pleases god as he sent me get the bomb as he sent me what he said as my father sent me so send are you oh as the father sent me and the prophet said so send are you with the same mechanics and it take the same dynamics to operate it oh glory to god as my father sent me not as some minister lay hands no as my father sent me let somebody say they call as my father sent me oh gloria if a donkey preached this message it's still the word but the father sent the donkey oh give the lord a shout [Music] [Applause] oh glory to god the father called you you are going to be the message you are going to be the word made flesh [Applause] glory you are going to be the living word all right oh your great audience let me show you another reason why satan hates the book of revelation he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday than forever every age again he get knocked out every day he get knocked out but but he had a bounce back every age when he thought he killed these saints during their cages them says into my hands i commit your spirit and ox anointed upon them to take them through every age god pulling wool over the devil i noticed his white horse red horse black horse messenger the messenger was hidden calling the electionary age the devil couldn't see the messenger you know devil didn't understand the elect was being called out you know oh glory to god look at the prophet said the messiah gonna find you you didn't find the message the message from you give the lord a shout you didn't find it the message from you [Applause] i was a catholic and a message from me pull me straight out of the room oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah blah blah i am one of the escape ones i will open my word and my mouth to the escape ones you are the escape ones you escape the pope you escape rome yes they force anointed they escape interpretations they escape men's idea yes give false prophets false teachers or glory liars hallelujah hairy and high-minded second timothy 3 [Applause] escape [Applause] glory all right remember christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it let's say the message not just church so in general antichrist spirit will come into the message making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan oh god he cannot watch all right he fights that he cannot stand it he knows yeah what he knows if the people get a true revelation of the true church what she is what she stands for and she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army you know what invisible means cannot be defeated under no circumstance meet the devil anywhere anytime on any condition who am i talking to this morning who am i preaching to this morning invincibility [Applause] watch if they get a true revelation of the two spirits working in the framework of the church and watch and by christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand if you don't have a discernment you can't get the design and withstand when you deserve the gossiper you know they're standing against that where you gonna read that why are you bringing that to me where is the purpose are you telling me that oh glory to god you stop them in your chat your discern and you withstand oh give the lord some praises glory to god discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before them christ withstood his every power to give power over him in the desert yes i'm closing so we have reached the end whoo my my my mind you love him this morning but abram i'm closing with this iframe don't want to stay here manager gets over here you say my lord gave me a good corn field here comes over here wait a minute i'm supposed to raise oats but i'm going to get corn too you ain't got nothing to do with corn get oats oats is your power to raise you ain't supposed to hurt sheep when you're supposed to eat cackle god wants to place his church but every one of them wants to do the same thing he's only but but but is he go to nature he said the church is supposed to be predestinated on the adoption of children musicians can't please god can take a man here we go and adopt him into the family and give him something who did that god could take a man any man and adopt him and put him in family what do we do first he said first not second not third first try that you mean believers anybody supposed to try that yeah i might make a claim you can just say he claimed that that is so let me dig it up now let me drill it down there a man said angel talk to him i don't know where the angel come from is that vision below what happens the only way we could check out if it's from above is to check that through the scriptures because angel satan is disguised as an angel of light so we are one of i see a light if you see that light boy was so bright yeah what do you like to see what do you i don't want to hear what you see you know i want to hear what he talked because he mocked just give him away hell not he calls you he could disguise in a real nice way but what that angels say so when the child come out you could check the scriptures then you know if you would or not is that right so he said no if a man claims something try the spirit the man came and said something try it see if it is right if it is right move right with it then say lord send us something else keep moving just keep moving till every fellow take his place then you're going to see the church of god begin to get this place then is where the philistines will go to backing up the shorts will go down here will go down shorts will go off here will go down face will be washed singers will be missing that's right when the church begins to get in its mighty power that is when you see the holy church stand together positionally placed sons of god oh my adoption there's my spirit flowing freely i can work here get another one over here place him i can place him who's doing that god is doing that not the church doing that not the church vote doing that not the believers love the pastor and he's adopted not them doing that this is not for you to do this is father and son business oh glory to god are you with me this is serious stuff you know oh glory to god hallelujah now watch i can work here get another one over here place him i can play some adoption place in manifesting take him out there put a ceremony on him visit him with an angel tell him something now if he told the truth now if he's just making up something it won't work no no no that won't work we have had a lot of that but i mean real manifestation of sons of god when god manifests himself he sends him out then he goes out musician could begin to play something what he does is the truth what he does he manifests christ how do you judge him how he judges man by the way he stays with the word see that's how you know all man is by the way he stays with the boy let's bow [Music] heads where you lead me [Music] yes [Music] [Music] i will go [Music] [Music] bow heads
