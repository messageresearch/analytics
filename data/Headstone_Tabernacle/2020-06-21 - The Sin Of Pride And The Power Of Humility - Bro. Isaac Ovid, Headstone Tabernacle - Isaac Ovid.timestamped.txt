[19:37] [Music]
[19:41] from sister Donnelly Clark I would like

[19:45] with mercy endureth forever last Tuesday
[19:48] night prayer was offered on behalf of

[19:51] the next day the boot showed no signs
[19:53] and symptoms thanks to the scenes were
[19:55] there prayer of feet middle or is she
[19:57] blessed you this morning
[19:59] I still wanna greet the church in the
[20:01] name of Jesus Christ and certainly
[20:03] extend Happy Father's Day to all of the
[20:06] fathers in a special way this morning
[20:08] and so let's get straight to the word
[20:12] this morning we know that the season is
[20:16] changing and Prime Minister hinted to
[20:19] extending the time and stuff like that
[20:22] but we still will try to work with the
[20:24] schedule today and we see our Lord will
[20:28] will move this morning so if you have
[20:29] your Bibles will you turn with me to two
[20:32] portions of scripture reading from Saint
[20:35] Matthew 23 and reading from first John 2
[20:39] reading Saint Matthew 23 and reading
[20:43] from verse 9 this morning in Matthew 23
[20:52] and verse 9 and call no man your father
[20:55] upon the earth for one is your father
[20:57] which is in heaven
[20:59] neither be called masters for one is
[21:03] your master even Christ but he that is
[21:07] greatest among you shall be your servant
[21:10] and whosoever shall exalt himself shall
[21:14] be a beast and he that shall humble
[21:17] himself shall be exalted and reading
[21:20] first John 2 and reading from verse 15
[21:29] love not the world neither the things
[21:32] that are in the world for If any man
[21:36] love the world the love of the father is
[21:38] not in him for all that is in the world
[21:42] the lust of the flesh and the lust of
[21:45] the eyes and the pride of life is not of
[21:47] the Father but is of the world
[21:50] Lord had a blessing to the reading of
[21:52] his would a man you may be seated this
[21:54] morning in the presence of the Lord
[21:57] greetings but also connected to the
[21:59] Internet and we under great expectation
[22:01] for what is gonna do God is doing how
[22:03] many appreciate the service last Sunday
[22:06] rebuilding the church and the power of
[22:08] the Spirit what a time that we are
[22:11] living in amen so all that is in the
[22:14] world we read the scripture the lust of
[22:16] the eyes lust of the flesh and the pride
[22:18] of life the Bible said that's also
[22:21] everything when you look at it it falls
[22:23] on the one of those three things the
[22:25] lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh
[22:28] and the pride of life and Bible is
[22:31] speaking about love not the world
[22:32] neither the things that are in the world
[22:34] and if any man love the world the love
[22:36] of the father is not in him for that is
[22:39] all that is in the world we know this
[22:41] already kind of church name M but this
[22:44] morning I want to take a little focus on
[22:46] pride that pride of life and that would
[22:48] pride in there this morning it's
[22:51] something that we don't hear preach
[22:52] about much and more than that I want to
[22:54] take a look at humility this morning so
[22:57] for a title this morning the sin of
[22:59] pride and the power of humility the sin
[23:03] of pride and the power of humility so
[23:06] write with me this morning we'll see
[23:09] what the Lord will do I believe the
[23:10] devil is in trouble because we about to
[23:12] expose him this morning and once we
[23:15] expose him he can't move anymore because
[23:17] we are not ignorant of Satan's devices
[23:19] undershirts amen so the sin of Pride and
[23:23] the power of humility
[23:25] now pride and humility are opposites we
[23:28] know this everybody with me this morning
[23:31] what is FRA pride is a feeling or deep
[23:35] pleasure or satisfaction derived from
[23:38] one's own achievement
[23:40] it's an inordinate self-esteem it's an
[23:45] unreasonable feeling of superiority as
[23:48] to one's talents beauty wealth
[23:51] rank and so forth it's as disdainful
[23:54] behavior or treatment it is considered
[23:57] to be insolence or arrogance of demeanor
[24:00] so someone has a haughty peer
[24:02] and that's the human definition of the
[24:06] word and we can only define what we
[24:09] could write down but when God uses words
[24:11] he has his own definition so we are also
[24:13] trying to come to a consciousness of his
[24:16] definition of it can it should say man
[24:18] now humility on the other hand comes
[24:20] from the Latin word humus which means
[24:23] earth soil dust and when you look at it
[24:27] it speaks of that that consciousness
[24:30] that from dust we came and to dust we
[24:32] are supposed to return so the more
[24:35] humble you I is the more like dust you
[24:37] are you realize that in the context of
[24:40] everything you are nothing
[24:41] lowly of hearts and the church say man
[24:44] no I'm going somewhere and a torpid over
[24:46] time building on what he preached last
[24:48] week but faster get into this this
[24:51] morning we have to go back before the
[24:54] beginning we have to go back all the way
[24:56] back to doctor before man was even on
[24:59] the earth can the church say man now we
[25:01] know the origin of sin is Satan called
[25:05] Lucifer called the devil now the Bible
[25:08] says Lucifer was lifted up with pride he
[25:13] exalted himself beyond his station he
[25:16] saw himself larger than he was so when
[25:20] you see yourself larger than you are it
[25:23] means in contrast you see other things
[25:25] smaller than they are everybody must be
[25:28] this morning so when Lucifer I exalted
[25:31] himself and got lifted up in Pride it
[25:34] meant he even saw God smaller than God
[25:36] was and the church hey man no wonder God
[25:40] says that no one of the Bible said that
[25:43] quad resists the proud but gives grace
[25:46] to the humble
[25:47] because the problem way back there was
[25:49] pride pride was the very beginning of
[25:52] the war in heaven it was not a war in
[25:55] heaven over food it was a war in heaven
[25:57] over land it was not a war in heaven the
[26:00] war and hell
[26:01] started because of anybody with me this
[26:04] morning
[26:05] Lucifer's pride let him to see I will be
[26:09] like the Most High that position the
[26:12] root of that position was pride anybody
[26:15] with me this morning
[26:16] so from pride came his ambition from
[26:19] pride it turned to loss from prime it
[26:23] turned to desire and the church say mmm
[26:26] Martin Luther who preached the just
[26:28] shall live by faith
[26:30] sets pride is the root of the board of
[26:33] the sin so lust of the eyes lust of the
[26:38] flesh and pride of life
[26:40] he said that prime is the key because if
[26:42] he could arrest the prime because that
[26:44] pride lifts you up beyond your position
[26:46] can the church say Amen let me go a
[26:50] little deeper pride interrupted the
[26:52] worship in heaven anybody with me this
[26:56] morning so it was pride that Lucifer who
[26:59] was the son of the morning who was among
[27:02] the worshippers as a chief worship up
[27:04] when he looked at himself and he looked
[27:06] around him and pride began to build it
[27:09] doesn't tell us how long it was there
[27:11] how long it built for but that pride was
[27:13] building until one day he looked at
[27:16] himself and said I look good he did not
[27:18] remember he didn't make himself he
[27:20] didn't remember where he came from but
[27:23] he looked at what he was doing he looked
[27:26] at the ministry he had and bride began
[27:28] to grow and I surprised he looked at
[27:31] himself and somewhere along the line he
[27:34] stopped worshiping oh come on now
[27:36] somebody with me anybody with me this
[27:39] morning
[27:41] listen carefully by definition God is
[27:45] the object of worship
[27:47] alright so bride was the first attack it
[27:50] was the first threat on Gordon that's
[27:54] how dangerous ride is because the
[27:57] private Lucifer had became contagious
[27:59] and angels begin to fall because of his
[28:03] pride oh come on now anybody with me
[28:06] this morning
[28:07] we're going somewhere we're gonna get
[28:09] some in a minute the first doctrine that
[28:12] came out of this root of pride was you
[28:15] don't have to worship God you have
[28:18] another option
[28:19] that's what Lucifer taught because he
[28:22] started to pull worship to himself it's
[28:25] pride let a doctrine you don't have to
[28:27] worship God there's another option you
[28:31] don't need to come to church there's
[28:33] another option you don't need to give
[28:35] God praise there's another option
[28:37] every time you kept from praising God
[28:40] that's a spirit of pride that's the
[28:44] foundation sin that led us where we are
[28:47] this morning hallelujah so when people
[28:50] don't want to worship God it's really a
[28:52] pride issue they have come too big they
[28:56] think they've got me somewhere they have
[28:58] achieved something but when you when you
[29:01] take the bride off and you understand
[29:04] what humility means for God oh come on
[29:07] somebody happy this morning you may be
[29:13] seated
[29:15] Lucifer's bride it's what led to Oh in
[29:18] heaven
[29:23] Lucifer's bride left his fall
[29:26] no one not a pipe that see pride cometh
[29:29] before fall so in other words when
[29:32] somebody back slit it's meant before
[29:35] that backsliding there was pride pride
[29:40] in your job right in your money pride in
[29:45] your achievement pride in your successes
[29:48] and this ride begins to move your
[29:51] worship
[29:52] oh come on somebody help me this morning
[29:54] you begin to depend on your credit card
[29:57] that's why the woman with the issue of
[29:59] blood when she spend all her money she
[30:01] had no pride to spend anymore she had to
[30:04] depend on something else
[30:09] anybody with me this morning and from
[30:13] that time on there was a war between
[30:17] pride and humility I've heard a few
[30:24] sermons on this topic in Genesis the
[30:32] Bible says that when Eve saw that the
[30:35] tree was seen as good for food lust of
[30:38] the flesh pleasant to the eye lust of
[30:41] the eye and the tree to be desired to
[30:43] make one wise that pride of life because
[30:48] wisdom or natural wisdom is considered
[30:51] something to be proud about watch the
[30:59] Train of it through scripture we know
[31:06] man fell and evil and Keena brought to
[31:10] that spot where they need to bring their
[31:12] sacrifice the sacrifice was revelation
[31:16] on so many levels because but the
[31:18] Branham will bring out that Abel brought
[31:21] the Lamb yes it was a type of redemption
[31:24] but Abel also got a revelation of who he
[31:27] was and his please listen carefully
[31:31] so when Cain brought his revelation of
[31:33] what he thought was what was needed
[31:37] listen and I'll get to what the Prophet
[31:39] said kin who we know us of his father
[31:43] the devil from first John 3:12 not a
[31:46] skin who was of that wicked one and slew
[31:48] his brother and wherefore slew him
[31:51] because his own works were evil and his
[31:53] brothers righteous Kien was caught in
[31:56] the war between pride and humility but
[32:00] the Branham said Cain he couldn't humble
[32:02] himself to the vindicated Word of God he
[32:06] couldn't do it so it meant that what
[32:08] kept Cain because God told Cain if you
[32:11] do what your brother did
[32:15] you don't even have to have a revelation
[32:17] of it if you could humble yourself and
[32:19] just do what your brother did I will
[32:22] honor - humility
[32:24] it was not a revelation being honored
[32:28] it was the humility oh come on now and
[32:32] where Brandon said that King could not
[32:35] humble himself this pride in his own
[32:39] revelation his pride in his own
[32:42] understanding this pride in his
[32:44] relationship with his brother is what
[32:46] separated him anybody with me this
[32:50] morning but the venom said how we do it
[32:53] for time power of transformation Keane
[32:56] was such a person listen to the prophets
[32:58] description of Keane religious indeed
[33:01] certainly but he had the wrong seed in
[33:04] MC and therefore it brought forth the
[33:06] Serpent's seed see it's not hissed over
[33:09] this seed of Eden and that's what
[33:10] brought forth a keen he put his poison
[33:13] on it he he listened to them knew the
[33:16] perfect will of God
[33:18] you hear that October 31st 1965 he came
[33:24] knew the perfect will of God that's
[33:27] something as we all want to know the
[33:29] perfect will of God
[33:31] he knew the perfect will of God in you
[33:34] and why but he refused to do it he
[33:37] proved them to be the serpent seed when
[33:41] he's seen the perfect will of God he
[33:42] refused it
[33:43] he had seen God vindicate Abel's message
[33:46] you know that was the will of God see
[33:48] he's seeing God will hear a buzz message
[33:51] and what did God say to him he said to
[33:53] the same do worship like your brother
[33:56] and you'll do well but you see he didn't
[33:59] want it he wanted to add something to it
[34:02] you see pride and these theologians see
[34:06] this Bible they read it but they don't
[34:09] want to do it see it shows a serpent
[34:11] seed they have seen and vindicated and
[34:13] so simply before the people but it seems
[34:16] like it's so hard for people to humble
[34:19] themselves to the Word of God
[34:22] I'm gonna say that one more time it
[34:24] seems like it's so hard for people to
[34:27] humble themselves for the word of God
[34:30] can I say it one more time it seems like
[34:32] it's so hard for people to humble
[34:35] themselves to the Word of God and the
[34:42] church see man see how Cain did he
[34:45] couldn't humble humble himself to the
[34:47] vindicated would of God hallelujah oh my
[34:55] the war between pride and humility this
[35:01] is such an issue for God that in
[35:03] proverbs 6 verse 16 he said these six
[35:07] things that the Lord hate he has seven
[35:09] our domination on to him first on the
[35:12] list a proud look just a lot of it
[35:17] caught hits it anybody with me this
[35:21] morning coming a little deeper Oh
[35:25] hallelujah we're gonna get somewhere the
[35:28] issue of ride is beyond wealth it's
[35:32] beyond education it's beyond status you
[35:35] can be poor and be proud
[35:39] you could be poor and still have pride
[35:41] you could have no education and still
[35:45] have pride you could have no status and
[35:47] still have pride can the church say man
[35:51] it is a spirit we're dealing with this
[35:54] morning anybody with me this morning
[35:59] samms 10-4 - wicked through the pride of
[36:03] his countenance your appearance how you
[36:07] carry yourself how you deal with people
[36:09] will not seek after God so you
[36:13] understand what God's saying is what
[36:15] creates this not seeking after God God
[36:20] is not in all his thoughts his pride has
[36:24] him absorbed in his own self thinking
[36:26] you see like naman we preach on a month
[36:28] in the Bible study he had his pride in
[36:32] his condition he still had
[36:34] pride and his pride define how he wanted
[36:38] to be treated how he expected to be
[36:41] treated how he desired to be treated a
[36:44] lot of people miss that his first issue
[36:46] was not the instruction to go down to
[36:49] Jordan that was not his issue his first
[36:51] issue was subscribe oh dear Elijah send
[36:55] a servant boy to tell me what to do that
[37:02] was his first issue that was the pride
[37:05] that almost stopped his healing that was
[37:07] the pride that almost stopped his
[37:09] deliverance but Tang God he had that
[37:13] experience I brought a level of humility
[37:15] maybe nobody ever treated him like that
[37:17] before maybe nobody ever spoke to him
[37:20] like that before he went away mad he
[37:23] went away upset better water I no matter
[37:26] what if you want to know good water ask
[37:28] neighbor good water but that Jordan is
[37:30] not he walked I want to be in and he was
[37:32] upset but truly experienced he humbled
[37:36] himself listen to his servants and his
[37:38] servant say come on brother come on
[37:41] master come on you could do better than
[37:43] that
[37:43] and he humbled himself and his humility
[37:47] let him where he should go hallelujah
[37:51] hallelujah hallelujah anybody with me
[37:54] this morning the fear of the Lord in
[38:00] proverbs 8:13 the fear of the Lord is to
[38:04] hate evil pride and arrogancy and the
[38:07] evil way and the froward mode doing it
[38:10] now this is not just and I know a lot of
[38:13] you haven't gotten it yet because
[38:15] message people have prayed church people
[38:19] have prayed the proud of the church the
[38:22] proud of the pasta the proud of the
[38:25] revelation and listen it takes a greater
[38:27] understanding to know that you couldn't
[38:29] give yourself relation you couldn't put
[38:31] your name in the book
[38:32] you didn't choose this path yes part
[38:35] shows you so you could never be proud it
[38:39] takes you
[38:40] Milutin it takes humility it takes
[38:43] humility simple message powerful message
[38:51] simple thought but powerful thought
[38:53] proverbs 11:2 when pride cometh then
[38:58] commits shame but with the lowly is
[39:01] wisdom proverbs 20:1 for a high look and
[39:06] a proud heart and the pawing of the
[39:09] wicked is sin can we go a little further
[39:13] pride and humility are both issues of
[39:17] the heart humility is not about how God
[39:22] looks at you I pray you get this morning
[39:27] humility is not about how good look God
[39:31] looks at you give me a mighty man of
[39:33] Valor that's how God looks at you
[39:39] humility is not how people look at you
[39:44] humility is all about how you look after
[39:48] yourself I'm going somewhere this
[39:53] humility is not about your actual
[39:56] position rank status it is about how you
[39:59] view your position how you view your
[40:05] rank how you view your status the Bible
[40:08] speaks about the word esteem let every
[40:11] man esteem his brother higher than
[40:14] himself that esteeming of higher is all
[40:19] about humility it doesn't change your
[40:21] position can the church say men let me
[40:26] bring it to fathers dear context when
[40:29] the prodigal son left home he left proud
[40:32] he had money in his account his credit
[40:35] card was available to be used he left he
[40:38] was proud enough of what he had to say
[40:40] father gives me what is mine and he left
[40:44] without hesitation as if you knew what
[40:47] he was doing
[40:49] and his father in wisdom let him go
[40:52] because he must have seen how that boy
[40:55] was growing up he knew what was in that
[40:57] boy but I can tell you the way that boy
[41:00] left was not how he came back he may
[41:07] have left with his head head held high
[41:10] feeling you conquer the world with the
[41:13] pride of his achievements he felt proud
[41:15] that he could pay for the food and he
[41:17] can see that the drinks are on me and
[41:19] I'll cover the pizza but when the money
[41:22] ran out it was not that that brought the
[41:24] humility because even when the money ran
[41:27] out he was still looking at himself the
[41:29] same way he took a job working in the
[41:33] pigsty his perception of himself still
[41:37] didn't change until he came to his
[41:40] senses when he kept himself is when the
[41:43] realization broke he said wait a minute
[41:46] in my father's house even the servants
[41:49] get better treatment
[41:51] I will arise I'll go to my father I'll
[41:55] say I have sinned I will say listen I'm
[41:58] no longer worthy to be called your son
[42:01] his position as son didn't change but
[42:04] his perception of how he was as a son
[42:06] that changed oh come on
[42:08] somebody help me now so he left home one
[42:13] way but he's coming back home
[42:15] differently his walk it's a little
[42:17] slower than it was before
[42:19] because he coming back feeling a little
[42:20] different he coming back feel a little
[42:22] bad and he doesn't know that every day
[42:25] since he left his father invested in a
[42:28] beautiful telescope because he know that
[42:30] that boy is headed for an experience to
[42:33] bring him to humility
[42:34] oh come on somebody please back to me
[42:37] anybody with me this morning I'm not
[42:41] gonna be too much longer with you this
[42:46] is why but a random said God is looking
[42:48] for someone that the more he blesses the
[42:52] more humble he becomes so listen
[42:55] carefully so as your blessings Authority
[42:59] rank and position increases your
[43:02] humility should also increase but 99.9%
[43:11] anytime that's not how it happens I'm
[43:16] careful now we'd even seen what God
[43:18] showed me no I'm careful because because
[43:23] I'm seen ministers get caught up in
[43:26] their understanding of the wood till
[43:28] pride sets in you see the danger of it
[43:32] and in subtle ways worship news from God
[43:36] to pastors to ministers to leaders
[43:39] anybody with me this morning and the
[43:41] movement Christ steps in God is not
[43:43] there
[43:45] can I see it one more time
[43:48] the movement pride steps in God is not
[43:51] there because the Bible said he resists
[43:54] the proud oh yeah
[43:57] so you come in to pray but you have
[44:00] pride that I would get into some of what
[44:02] pride is really you know because when
[44:04] you don't forgive that's bright enough
[44:07] uh-huh when you can say sorry
[44:11] what causes that is pride you know when
[44:15] you kind of repent what is that that's
[44:17] pride we know it has children and we
[44:20] have grown up and we haven't changed a
[44:22] little child apologized which I do want
[44:25] to project because a child feels
[44:26] embarrassed embarrassment is it's an
[44:29] emotion that deals with the pride you're
[44:32] dealing with you know or anybody with me
[44:34] this morning so when we do an altar call
[44:36] and people don't want to come up it's
[44:38] private deal original or anybody with me
[44:41] now's when you don't want to tell the
[44:47] pasta what's going on and you you don't
[44:49] want to what is that it's pride because
[44:53] you feeling you feel in some kind of way
[44:55] doing a way to know and God is saying
[44:58] you keep it here is sister proud you
[45:02] trying to come to the altar panco resist
[45:03] because you seen the pride and he can't
[45:05] accept it
[45:06] there's like a barrier around God that
[45:08] stops pride
[45:11] but he gives grace his strong is a stone
[45:14] of grease but the access is short of
[45:17] grease you can't come with pride
[45:21] I'm almost finished the closer you get
[45:27] to God the more he can bless you
[45:30] the more he can trust you the more he
[45:33] can use you but that closeness will
[45:36] always lead to humility like Isaiah the
[45:40] major prophet as he stood in the
[45:42] presence of God it was not good telling
[45:45] him about him but his view of himself
[45:48] changed as he got closer to God he
[45:51] screamed that war is me I've taught this
[45:57] in Bible study a couple weeks ago the
[46:00] chapter just before he said woe unto
[46:02] them woe unto them warn to you woe unto
[46:05] you warn to them what has he gotten the
[46:08] presence of God because humility is not
[46:12] looking at you in relation to others is
[46:15] really looking at you so people come to
[46:21] church and they pray and they pray and
[46:23] they pray for other people that's fine
[46:25] not nothing wrong with that when they
[46:28] pray for other people as if they don't
[46:29] need pray for themselves Lord you know
[46:33] brother so-and-so he needs you Lord and
[46:36] you spend the whole premium pray for
[46:39] sister so brother so and up to now is
[46:41] here you want to admit that you need
[46:43] help anybody with me anybody with me
[46:49] this morning so Isaiah only in the
[46:55] presence of God he saw his real
[46:58] condition and he saw his position his
[47:03] realization listen carefully so humility
[47:06] doesn't change his position in other
[47:08] words his realization did not change his
[47:10] position as a prophet but his experience
[47:13] letter a deeper humility before God
[47:17] there must be a correlation between who
[47:20] you are what you have and your humility
[47:25] anybody with me this morning humility
[47:29] cannot be bought humility is not a
[47:33] performance I've heard people say you
[47:36] know I'm a tango that I'm so so humble
[47:49] undercover predator you know and my
[47:56] humbleness that alors give me I hope
[48:04] this resonates with us you know because
[48:06] listen and I hope I guess it trying to
[48:09] be humble to time as well
[48:15] pride says I don't need help
[48:19] pride says I don't need you to tell me
[48:22] what to do because I know
[48:26] humility says I need all the help I can
[48:29] get
[48:31] right yes I'm okay humility says I'm not
[48:36] okay
[48:41] go all the profit in me to be more
[48:43] sincere no much times and we do it we do
[48:45] it unconsciously because we have built
[48:47] up these layers of Defense's for
[48:49] ourselves how you doin good blessed
[48:51] highly favored and Benita you crumbling
[48:56] we need their pain but your pride won't
[49:00] let you admit but you're in trouble
[49:06] Peter was a fisherman I would expect him
[49:08] to know how to swim and when he walked
[49:10] on the water the moment he started to
[49:12] sing is he Lord help me
[49:13] and many of us we sit in church and we
[49:16] need help but our pride keeps us from
[49:19] say Lord I'm drowning I'm sinking I'm
[49:22] backsliding I'm weak Lord hold my hands
[49:25] pray for me somebody bride says I know
[49:30] where I am
[49:31] remember the Prophet speak about the
[49:33] guide he said I was a guide and I felt I
[49:36] knew where I was I reach around the tree
[49:39] I found where was and then I found back
[49:42] after a while I was in the same spot he
[49:45] said the Indians call it a death walk Oh
[49:47] hallelujah his bride had him making the
[49:51] circles and that was the Prophet anybody
[49:55] with me this morning if you're making
[49:57] circles this morning let's cast on the
[50:00] pride cast don't cry this morning and
[50:04] humbly come back to God right since I
[50:09] know I am humility says I am lost
[50:11] I need a compass I need a guide I'm in
[50:15] trouble I need help I don't know what
[50:17] I'm doing I'm trying my best bank - it's
[50:20] not enough I need help
[50:23] Brian refuses to ask for help
[50:26] humility says help me save me pride says
[50:30] I don't need to go to the altar pride
[50:33] says I'm a deacon how will this look
[50:35] right says I'm a minister how will this
[50:39] look right as I put on a message so long
[50:41] how will this look bride says I don't
[50:44] want my children to see me sighing and
[50:47] crying right since I can't come and
[50:50] repent because I don't want to wait to
[50:52] see me different bride says I don't want
[50:54] nobody to know and I messed up that's
[50:57] right
[50:58] but jesus said I have not come to those
[51:01] that don't need help
[51:02] he says gay little they don't need a
[51:05] doctor when I come if you have a
[51:07] sickness that's why I am come pass down
[51:11] your bride oh come on now somebody help
[51:15] me this morning
[51:16] [Applause]
[51:18] humility bride humility right cannot say
[51:24] I'm sorry people hold on to things for
[51:28] years because of pride they don't say
[51:31] I'm sorry I'm sorry I said that
[51:34] sorry I did that I didn't mean it that
[51:37] way most of the things you see you
[51:40] didn't mean it that way
[51:41] you let it fly lambda and then take it
[51:44] in Pakistan as the hardest thing to do
[51:46] but God brings us to that spot when you
[51:49] wants us to cast it all down so that
[51:53] when he looks at us he sees us perfect
[51:55] because it's nothing hindering in us in
[52:06] the natural you go to a psychologist and
[52:10] they say you cannot get help unless you
[52:13] admit the problem the first part of any
[52:17] therapy session is to bring you to admit
[52:21] that there is a problem most people who
[52:24] have problems cannot admit it's a
[52:28] problem that admit us that admittance of
[52:32] a problem has all to do it right I don't
[52:40] know what my co-workers will think
[52:42] [Music]
[52:47] people see me in church you don't know
[52:50] you don't know can't afford for them to
[52:54] know don't want don't know that hiding
[52:57] is the devil's work because hiding is
[53:01] what led Adam to hide when he should
[53:03] have run for help he went hiding so it's
[53:06] not that hiding itself is not nothing
[53:09] new it was dear Adam who was not born
[53:12] and grew up exhibited the same behaviors
[53:16] that we exhibit today but it was his
[53:19] pride his pride said I'm naked his pride
[53:25] realized he's exposing his pride said
[53:28] don't show anybody don't let them see
[53:30] that as an issue in my life don't let
[53:32] them see I have a problem don't see that
[53:35] behind the closed doors and when I look
[53:37] in the mirror and the tears come and
[53:39] nobody else is there I'm by myself and
[53:41] when nobody else to impress on I take
[53:43] off to sue
[53:43] Tanna take off the dress and go home and
[53:46] look at my bank account or go home and
[53:48] look at my family's situation I closed
[53:50] my door in the bathroom and don't tell
[53:52] nobody about it well we don't hear these
[53:54] kind of messages much but right is a sin
[53:59] because it will prevent you from your
[54:01] deliverance but I declare to you this
[54:03] morning today is the day of deliverance
[54:05] pass down your pride humble yourself
[54:10] before God and see the Lord work in your
[54:12] life bring change in your life bring
[54:16] deliverance in your life bring healing
[54:18] in your life and the church amen
[54:23] you may be seated I'll take a few more
[54:28] minutes the prime minister C extended
[54:31] service you didn't see what Davis Adid
[54:33] that's cuz that's his issue not mine
[54:35] take a few more minutes the book of
[54:42] James listen to the issues in James from
[54:49] whence come Wars and Fighting's among
[54:51] you he is speaking to believers he's not
[54:55] speaking to the world he is speaking to
[54:58] the church and he's asking him a
[55:00] question where all the fighting and
[55:03] issues coming from among you among you
[55:06] believers come they not hence even of
[55:11] your lusts and war in your members so
[55:15] you seen don't need a start in your
[55:17] flesh instead about how you feel and
[55:20] your emotions and how you think about
[55:23] things this is all about you so a big
[55:26] part of citing the church was believers
[55:28] starting with issues in themselves read
[55:31] the book so a portion of the issues in
[55:37] the church was issues that dealt with
[55:39] the person the issues of the flesh
[55:44] listen he goes on he lost and have-nots
[55:47] in other words you're wanting what you
[55:49] don't have he said he kill and desire to
[55:53] have he speaking with the lust of the
[55:55] flesh
[55:56] the eyes there and cannot obtain he
[55:59] fight and war yet he have not because
[56:01] you ask not
[56:02] that's the context of that scripture its
[56:06] context he asked and he received not
[56:10] because he asked amiss that you may
[56:12] consume it upon your lust so she ended
[56:17] speaking of my citizen you ask him but
[56:19] you're asking all over the place because
[56:20] your motivation for asking is Colonel to
[56:23] begin with you're asking for stuff
[56:27] that's tied to your own lust lust of the
[56:29] eye lusts of the flesh anybody with me
[56:33] here rich pride yet we commit to it he
[56:39] adulterers and adulteresses know ye not
[56:42] that the friendship of the world is
[56:44] enmity with God are you a friend to the
[56:48] world are you more interested about the
[56:50] things of the world and the things of
[56:52] God I'm reading scripture this is not
[56:54] doctrine this is your Bible whosoever
[56:58] therefore will be a friend of the world
[57:00] is the enemy of God so I do you want to
[57:03] be a friend of God would there be a
[57:04] friend of the world make a choice and I
[57:07] read in scripture this morning do you
[57:10] think that the scripture said Envy in
[57:12] the spirit that dwelleth in us luster to
[57:15] Envy that lost Envy is now all about
[57:18] pride and he's building now he's
[57:23] building now to address it and confront
[57:26] it directly but he giveth more grace
[57:28] wherefore he saith God resisteth the
[57:31] proud so he dealt with the lust of the
[57:33] flesh he tells me the lust of their eyes
[57:35] now he's come against the issue of pride
[57:37] anybody with me this morning he giveth
[57:40] more grace wherefore he saith God
[57:42] resisted the proud but giveth grace unto
[57:44] the humble submit yourselves therefore
[57:48] to God resist the devil and he will flee
[57:51] from you draw nigh to God and He will
[57:55] draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you
[57:58] sinners and purify your hearts you
[58:00] double-minded be afflicted and mourn and
[58:03] weep let your laughter be turned to
[58:05] mourning and your two
[58:07] - heaviness and any ends it infers ten
[58:09] this aspect of it humble yourselves so
[58:13] his whole solution to all of those
[58:16] verses that led up to this brother
[58:18] eclipse is humble yourselves in the
[58:20] sight of the Lord and he shall lift you
[58:23] up can the church say man anybody with
[58:26] me this morning are you enjoying this
[58:28] this morning instead what the doctor
[58:32] ordered for you this morning now I want
[58:36] to talk about Jesus and I have our own
[58:37] courts and I'm gonna close out almost
[58:39] done the musician got beginning it ready
[58:42] now I want to read the scripture here
[58:46] because this humility issue is so
[58:48] important to God so important to God
[58:52] listen to Paul's letter to the
[58:54] Philippians Philippians 2 verse 1 if
[58:57] there be therefore any consolation in
[59:00] Christ if any comfort of love if any
[59:04] fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels
[59:07] and mercies fulfill me my joy that he be
[59:11] like-minded and always have this kind of
[59:12] thinking having the same love being of
[59:15] one Accord of one mind listen carefully
[59:18] let nothing be done through strife or
[59:21] vainglory so don't do anything to cause
[59:25] contention or vien glory is that holding
[59:28] about prices doing it go you want to get
[59:30] your recognition everybody with me but
[59:35] in lowliness of mind let each esteem
[59:40] other better than themselves can you do
[59:45] that can you esteem others better than
[59:49] yourself look not every man on his own
[59:53] things but every man also on the things
[59:56] of others the reason many of you don't
[59:59] testify you're too selfish and the
[1:00:02] selfishness is based on pride oh I don't
[1:00:06] have time this morning but let this mind
[1:00:08] be in you which also which was also in
[1:00:12] Christ Jesus so he's saying let this
[1:00:14] thinking that Jesus had you must also
[1:00:17] have listen
[1:00:18] carefully who being in the form of God
[1:00:21] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:00:24] God but listen listen this goes against
[1:00:27] half or more of the message ministers
[1:00:29] who made himself of no reputation can I
[1:00:39] say that again he made himself of no
[1:00:43] reputation you know what I said wasn't
[1:00:46] represent none at the idea he won no
[1:00:48] reputation I preached it before almost
[1:00:51] all of the miracles to a point Jesus
[1:00:53] says tell no one when he huge iris when
[1:00:56] he realized or merely say tell no one he
[1:00:59] gives her to tell anybody it was kept a
[1:01:03] secret what broke the story you know
[1:01:07] remember what broke his story what broke
[1:01:09] is were because only toes but equal for
[1:01:11] around Jesus were what were
[1:01:13] knowledgeable of the extent of the
[1:01:15] miracles because he kept telling them
[1:01:17] don't tell anybody what bro this story
[1:01:20] is Lazarus that is what broke his story
[1:01:26] especially since when Jesus was there
[1:01:28] before they had kicked him out so when
[1:01:30] he went back where he was kicked out
[1:01:31] before and raised Lazarus from the dead
[1:01:33] this story couldn't be contained any
[1:01:35] more people say I have to tell somebody
[1:01:36] I tried to keep it locked up I tried to
[1:01:39] keep it with it but this thing too good
[1:01:41] and it was that I'd left Jesus on Palm
[1:01:43] Sunday it was only heels of Lazarus
[1:01:46] being raised from the dead that led to
[1:01:48] Palm Sunday where they came from
[1:01:50] everywhere anybody with me this morning
[1:01:52] but he made himself of no reputation no
[1:01:56] it's one thing if people talk about you
[1:01:58] but the Prophet was on the feel and when
[1:02:01] he heard he were baptizing in his name
[1:02:02] he shut down the convention to go and
[1:02:04] deal with it
[1:02:05] because he didn't want to tolerate
[1:02:08] people making a reputation of himself
[1:02:10] let me come back from there and took
[1:02:14] upon him the form of a servant and was
[1:02:16] made in the likeness of men and being
[1:02:19] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[1:02:23] himself now if Jesus
[1:02:28] had to humble himself what about you
[1:02:31] what about me he humbled himself and
[1:02:35] became obedient unto death even the
[1:02:39] death of the cross wherefore God also
[1:02:43] hath highly exalted him so because of
[1:02:47] his obedience because of his humility he
[1:02:50] didn't exalt himself but God exhort him
[1:02:52] and given him a name which is above
[1:02:55] every other name that at the name of
[1:02:57] Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[1:03:00] heaven and things in earth and things
[1:03:02] under the earth and that every tongue
[1:03:04] shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:03:06] to the glory of God the Father I'm
[1:03:09] trying to close out here now
[1:03:12] you will talk about humility we talk
[1:03:16] about Jesus eighteen years of silence we
[1:03:19] know we're talking about rain the Bible
[1:03:21] says that at age twelve Jesus confounded
[1:03:26] the priests in the temple you remember
[1:03:29] this when Mary and Joseph four o'clock
[1:03:31] Jesus and and they told her what about
[1:03:35] three four days a week and when they
[1:03:36] came back they found jesus surrounded by
[1:03:39] all the priests who were taking notes
[1:03:40] and he told them told you no mama I'm
[1:03:44] about my father's business and Jesus was
[1:03:46] actually explaining things to them they
[1:03:48] didn't realize and then it stops but
[1:03:52] when you fast-forward
[1:03:53] eighteen years later and Jesus comes on
[1:03:55] the scene and says the Spirit of the
[1:03:58] Lord is upon me the Bible says it was as
[1:04:00] his custom he was in the temple so it
[1:04:04] means this friends that's for 18 years
[1:04:06] the word sat silently in the temple
[1:04:09] without seeing a wood now I want you to
[1:04:13] catch this for a minute for 18 years
[1:04:18] the book the wood made flesh sat in the
[1:04:23] temple humble meek I wonder how many
[1:04:28] services he sat there looking at people
[1:04:31] take the Scrolls try to interpret it and
[1:04:34] he would smile as it that's not how I
[1:04:36] meant it how many times the word made
[1:04:39] flesh
[1:04:40] sat in the temple not saying a word
[1:04:43] because his time was not yet anybody in
[1:04:47] the house with me this morning
[1:04:49] [Applause]
[1:04:56] marked Wiseman he could bridle his
[1:05:00] tongue some of you can't keep quiet for
[1:05:03] did you see something is it right in
[1:05:08] here right in here right in here you
[1:05:10] have to you have to see something after
[1:05:12] see something 18 years if at age 12 he
[1:05:17] confounded them 13 14 15 16 he's
[1:05:24] counting time but he is the Word made
[1:05:26] flesh maturing he's learning obedience
[1:05:28] by whatever suffering the Bible hasn't
[1:05:31] kept it for us that is not for us to
[1:05:33] know but we know he's coming into
[1:05:34] something he's he is bringing himself
[1:05:36] under subjection he has to bite his
[1:05:39] tongue humble himself because his time
[1:05:41] is not yet until the time appointed when
[1:05:44] he could not break the veil of his
[1:05:45] ministry at age 30 years old after he
[1:05:48] comes off the wilderness to return in
[1:05:50] power and now we can unseal himself
[1:05:52] after his years of silence can't you
[1:05:56] humble yourselves a little bit oh we
[1:06:00] gonna play something softly I'm finished
[1:06:03] when they whipped him he humbled himself
[1:06:05] he said like a call of allegiance I
[1:06:08] could call for soldiers it's not that
[1:06:11] easy that the power but his humility was
[1:06:15] the doorway to power can the church say
[1:06:17] Amen I have to finish after wrap up I
[1:06:21] have so many quarts haven't touched it
[1:06:22] yet but it man speaks about Martin you
[1:06:25] know Paul Iranians Martin he said Martin
[1:06:27] was so humble that one time a poor man
[1:06:31] came to the church a beggar and when he
[1:06:35] saw Martin and he was better but I bet
[1:06:37] him said as he was preparing to enter
[1:06:39] the pulpit a beggar came to his study
[1:06:42] and asked for some closing Martin send
[1:06:45] the beggar to the head deacon
[1:06:47] that he control him to leave the man
[1:06:51] came back to Martin and City dick a time
[1:06:52] ago Martin stopped going to the pulpit
[1:06:55] took his robe off
[1:06:57] give it a beggar and tell the Deacon
[1:07:00] find me another clothes that night
[1:07:05] brother man said as Martin preached to
[1:07:08] would the people of God saw a glow
[1:07:10] around his person but I ban him said
[1:07:15] surely that was a great man a true
[1:07:20] messenger to that age but if Adam said
[1:07:23] instead he said instead of the humility
[1:07:26] of and power of the Spirit you cut the
[1:07:28] world of spread said the very secret of
[1:07:30] his power was in humility before God and
[1:07:36] this is what I believe we have been
[1:07:37] going through these last few months in
[1:07:39] presuming when God has given the issue
[1:07:41] for the church to call a halt and back
[1:07:44] to a prayer life you see you could only
[1:07:46] pray whenever every stone humility you
[1:07:48] know because humility brings a
[1:07:50] consciousness that I can't do it without
[1:07:51] you Lord I don't want to leave my house
[1:07:54] without you I don't want to try to
[1:07:55] preach me I don't know water walk
[1:07:57] without you because it's not my ability
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:01] you think you studied and you achieve
[1:08:03] the study if your mind don't work what
[1:08:06] could you study if you lose the ability
[1:08:11] to remember what will you remember it is
[1:08:13] god-given ability to remember to learn
[1:08:16] to read here if it was the cause Gracie
[1:08:21] to hear all your education you wouldn't
[1:08:23] have it is that you're doing is that
[1:08:25] your ability how can you be proud how
[1:08:29] did you have bribe you didn't teach
[1:08:31] yourself he allowed you to get
[1:08:33] understanding I want to close out he
[1:08:41] said in the message ordination if
[1:08:42] anything that we want to be is humble
[1:08:45] cuz that's the secret of power is true
[1:08:48] humility hallelujah and in a message of
[1:08:53] grace he said we have got theologians
[1:08:55] today we've got doctors of divinity
[1:08:57] we've got great men all over the world
[1:08:59] that's
[1:09:00] intellectual and educated but it takes a
[1:09:03] simplicity of believing God to make his
[1:09:06] words speak out to show that Jesus
[1:09:08] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:09:11] forever takes a humble heart dedicated
[1:09:14] to God to bring Jesus Christ into
[1:09:17] present tense me Lord wish you bless you
