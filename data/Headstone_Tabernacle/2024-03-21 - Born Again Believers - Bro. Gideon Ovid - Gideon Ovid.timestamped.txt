[33:47] amen so just as we switch over if you
[33:50] have your Bibles I'd like to ask you to
[33:52] turn with me to
[33:54] the book of St John chapter
[33:58] three reading a couple verses
[34:03] there oh I'm excited
[34:07] tonight I hope you came under
[34:09] expectation for the miraculous to take
[34:12] place I hope you came with a shout in
[34:15] your heart and a worship on your
[34:17] lips I hope you came to meet the Lord
[34:23] tonight in the book of St John starting
[34:26] from chapter 3 3:1 a very familiar
[34:31] scripture and it says from verse 1 to 7
[34:35] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[34:37] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews and I'll
[34:41] read it all the way through and then
[34:42] I'll come back to
[34:43] it the same came to Jesus by night and
[34:46] said unto him
[34:48] Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[34:50] come from God and no man can do these
[34:53] Miracles that thou doest except God be
[34:56] with him Jesus answered and said unto
[34:59] him verily verily I say unto thee except
[35:01] a man be born again he cannot see the
[35:04] kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto him
[35:08] how can a man be born when he's old can
[35:11] he enter the second time into his
[35:12] mother's womb and be born Jesus answered
[35:15] in verse 5 verily verily I say unto thee
[35:18] except a man be born of water and of the
[35:20] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[35:21] of God that which is born of the flesh
[35:24] is flesh and that which is born of the
[35:25] spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said
[35:29] unto thee ye must be born again amen
[35:33] let's just bow our heads as we pray one
[35:35] more time oh Heavenly Father tonight
[35:38] I've paused and read your scripture Lord
[35:40] Lord and any man could read it but I
[35:41] pray that you would Breathe life into it
[35:43] Lord that you will come and you reveal
[35:45] it to your people Lord Lord and the few
[35:46] broken up words that I have put together
[35:48] Lord I pray that you would sew it weave
[35:50] it Lord bring it together how you want
[35:52] to deliver to your people Lord Lord I
[35:54] pray that you take me out of the way
[35:55] tonight Lord and Inspire the things that
[35:57] that that will go forth tonight and Lord
[36:00] I pray that it'd be such a blessing to
[36:02] your people that people could definitely
[36:04] walk here and leave this place Lord with
[36:06] their heart burning within them knowing
[36:08] that they would have heard direct from
[36:10] you lord lord I pray that you will do
[36:11] something special for your people
[36:13] gathered together right here in this
[36:15] Tabernacle and those who will connect
[36:17] even afterwards Lord Lord I pray that
[36:19] the fire of God and the presence of God
[36:21] will ignite people in their homes Lord
[36:23] in their cars wherever they are Lord
[36:24] that the power of God will go out Lord
[36:27] Lord L and signs wonders and miracles
[36:29] will follow Lord Lord I pray that we
[36:31] come into a season that we could see the
[36:33] manifestation of your word and be made
[36:35] so real among us tonight Lord Lord I
[36:38] pray that you have your perfect will
[36:39] over everything that will be said and
[36:41] everything that will be done Lord I pray
[36:42] that you anoint me Lord Lord I pray that
[36:44] you inspire me I pray that you would
[36:46] guide me Lord I pray that you would Lord
[36:48] bless your people in such a special way
[36:50] in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may
[36:53] have your seats at this time
[36:56] Glory Hallelujah you know for for a
[36:58] title I'll just give him a title and
[37:00] inspiration one time the title is Born
[37:02] Again Believers amen amen not average
[37:06] Believers not not make Believers but
[37:09] born again Believers amen and the
[37:11] inspiration is you must be born
[37:14] again we put we going back to basics but
[37:18] brandham describes it as Jesus first
[37:20] Doctrine you must be G be B born again
[37:23] amen so so you can't reach your second
[37:25] round or you can't reach standard two
[37:27] without passing standard one amen and
[37:31] here in the scripture and I revisit it
[37:33] starting back from verse one it says
[37:35] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[37:37] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews and I want
[37:40] to pause there for a second because a
[37:42] couple things were identify there it
[37:45] identified where he came from or who he
[37:48] was because he was of the
[37:50] Pharisees it called him by name so he
[37:54] was important he was significant he was
[37:58] well respected because it didn't say you
[38:01] know a old guy or somebody came to to
[38:04] Jesus the identified him by name and
[38:06] then they said he was a ruler of the
[38:08] Jews so even among his people he was a
[38:12] leader he was somebody that was well
[38:14] respected he was somebody that people
[38:16] followed he was well taught he was
[38:19] trained he was educated he was somebody
[38:21] that could give you guidance and
[38:23] counsel so in this verse
[38:28] it clearly identified who he
[38:30] was in verse two it says the same
[38:33] meaning Nicodemus came to Jesus by night
[38:36] and said unto him Rabbi we know that
[38:39] thou art a teacher come from God you
[38:41] will clearly observe that he didn't say
[38:44] I realize that you're a teacher he said
[38:47] we know that so it was discussed before
[38:50] it was decided and agreed upon that
[38:52] you're
[38:53] teacher come from God not from the back
[38:57] of some some school or some Seminary but
[38:59] you come from God we have already
[39:01] discerned and and and we explored it and
[39:03] we could confirm who you are for no man
[39:06] could do these Miracles that thou doest
[39:08] except God be with him so they were very
[39:11] very familiar and aware of who they were
[39:14] dealing with amen amen
[39:18] amen in verse three without a question
[39:21] being asked Jesus started to challenge
[39:24] he said verily verily I say unto you
[39:26] after all that listen here what going on
[39:29] no matter if you are the boss you could
[39:32] be the CEO you could be the mayor you
[39:34] could be the teacher you could be a
[39:35] professor you could be whoever the the
[39:38] the society and the world say you are
[39:40] this is the word I have for you because
[39:43] I am God made flesh you hear what I'm
[39:44] telling you he say except a man be born
[39:47] again he cannot see the kingdom of God
[39:49] so your Works can cut it your experience
[39:52] don't really count in this Kingdom who
[39:55] people say you are or who you think you
[39:57] are or who people or or what people say
[39:59] about you doesn't matter here because
[40:01] there's something that you must do and
[40:03] that's the challenge we have in this as
[40:05] described by the prophet as Jesus first
[40:07] Doctrine you must be born again so
[40:09] there's something that you need to do
[40:11] and of course he had his questions and a
[40:13] run a little more and he said except a
[40:16] man be born of water and of the spirit
[40:17] so he expounded a little more so not
[40:19] just born again you're born of the water
[40:21] and the spirit yes you can't even enter
[40:24] so you can't see the kingdom you can't
[40:25] enter the kingdom unless these things
[40:26] take place and then he went on to say
[40:29] listen what is born of the flesh is
[40:31] flesh born of the spirit is Spirit
[40:33] Marvel not that I said unto thee you
[40:36] must be born again and that's where I
[40:38] want to start you must so in in in in
[40:42] other words you don't have an option
[40:45] it's not a choice it's mandatory is
[40:48] essential it's critical so this is not a
[40:51] suggestion to you you know I want to
[40:54] make a recommendation you know sometimes
[40:55] some people they say you're strong L
[40:57] recommend this is not one of those this
[41:00] is a very clear specific instruction and
[41:03] in a message you must be born again same
[41:06] title brother brandham in in paragraph
[41:09] 30 he said now so now remember it didn't
[41:11] say you ought to be born again but you
[41:13] must it's absolute it's absolutely you
[41:16] got to do it see it's a must not you
[41:19] ought to or you'll be better off if you
[41:21] did but you must be born again oh if we
[41:24] could just take that word this morning
[41:26] and break it down
[41:27] what it means how it's totally
[41:29] impossible it's essential it's that
[41:31] great it's totally impossible to enter
[41:33] the kingdom of heaven or even see it
[41:35] until you're born again and so many
[41:37] different interpretations of the word
[41:40] plain intellectual thing I wonder what
[41:42] this mean and and what the
[41:43] interpretation of this but it's very
[41:45] clear we ought to seek it out with all
[41:47] our heart to find out what it means amen
[41:50] so tonight I want to take a few moments
[41:52] a few minutes to explore what is this
[41:56] challenge that Jesus gave gave here he
[41:58] said listen in essence no matter who you
[42:01] are or who you think you are there's
[42:02] something you must do you must be born
[42:04] of water and spirit before you could
[42:05] even see the kingdom before you can
[42:07] enter the kingdom these are the things
[42:08] you must do these are foundational this
[42:10] is Back to Basics as I said this is
[42:13] before you do anything else if you don't
[42:15] have have this you're nothing it don't
[42:16] matter it don't matter how good if you
[42:19] give arms if you you know you treat your
[42:20] brother well and you're forgiv listen
[42:22] you must be born again am must
[42:25] hallelujah amen amen now what what what
[42:28] does that really mean you know another
[42:31] message he said no matter how much we
[42:33] try to think about it no matter how how
[42:36] we try to think we are right in saying a
[42:38] Creed or joining a church you're still
[42:40] what you were until you're actually born
[42:42] again of the spirits of God it doesn't
[42:45] change you your Creed joining Church
[42:48] coming here on a Wednesday and a Sunday
[42:49] doesn't change you you know if God do do
[42:52] something for your life you're the same
[42:53] person know coming Sunday Wednesday
[42:56] Friday come to a prayer meeting you
[42:58] service you're clean around the church
[43:00] you do this and you're a good person and
[43:02] everybody have positive things to say
[43:03] about you that sounds nice but if God
[43:06] don't give you a personal experience and
[43:09] you go through the process of being born
[43:12] of the water and spirit you're not
[43:15] seeing the Kingdom of Heaven you're not
[43:17] entering the Kingdom of Heaven that's
[43:19] what the message say it's very clear is
[43:21] English we talking here for now amen so
[43:24] this is something you must do you say
[43:25] listen it doesn't change your Creed
[43:27] joining Church changing your idea or
[43:30] your good intentions although as good as
[43:32] it might seem it's still not right
[43:35] there's something got to happen that's
[43:37] what we here tonight for I'm not here to
[43:39] talk you know I'm not here to preach and
[43:41] to share a good opinion and idea I am
[43:43] here to stir you and challenge you to
[43:45] tell you listen no matter how much you
[43:47] come to church and go back home if you
[43:48] don't settle and have an experience with
[43:50] God you have nowhere to go all you're
[43:53] doing is going through the emotions all
[43:54] you're doing is is is warming a bench of
[43:56] being a good church member at the end of
[43:58] the day we called to be much more we
[44:00] called to be born again Believers not
[44:03] make Believers and unbelievers true
[44:05] believers who could see this is a
[44:08] promise for us in the word this is
[44:09] something we need to do this is not an
[44:11] option this is not an opinion or
[44:13] interpretation this is something we must
[44:15] do we must do it's essential and
[44:18] critical that we get it done so it is
[44:21] not that that brings the new
[44:23] birth you said there's something got to
[44:26] happen New Birth is an experience
[44:29] something that takes place it it doesn't
[44:31] bring the New Birth now the different
[44:32] churches they say well you accept this
[44:35] or believe that or or it's all right it
[44:37] isn't now to begin with to base back the
[44:41] reason we have to be born again is
[44:43] because the Bible teaches us we were all
[44:46] born in sin shaped in iniquity and come
[44:50] in this world speaking lies then that
[44:53] shows us that our nature to begin with
[44:56] to sin to start with so we know good no
[44:59] matter how much we paint it up ande
[45:01] pretend and we do nice things and we we
[45:03] greet people and say God bless you and
[45:05] we walk and we put on a suit and a tie
[45:07] and a dress and we think we okay we born
[45:09] in sin it's in our nature it's in our
[45:12] nature it's in our DNA to do wrong it's
[45:15] in our nature to to to to go contrary
[45:18] but he's saying listen there's something
[45:19] that have to happen and if this
[45:21] experience could get a hold of you you
[45:24] could be changed and when we change then
[45:27] we now entitled to his promises then we
[45:30] entitled to his Blessing then we
[45:32] entitled to what he laid out for us amen
[45:35] so it it it goes on here he say let's
[45:37] base back we born in sin shaped in
[45:39] iniquity come to this world speaking
[45:41] lies then that shows in our nature to
[45:43] begin with it's sinful to start with we
[45:45] know good to begin with so we cannot
[45:47] claim anything by our shrewdness our
[45:49] sincerity or how great we are how little
[45:52] we are you know some people they claim
[45:54] meekness they want to claim that and say
[45:56] listen I do interfere with anybody you
[45:57] know I am the most humble person around
[46:01] I really don't want to mess with anybody
[46:02] and mdle with anybody say listen even
[46:05] with that that might be your personality
[46:07] that might be the way you carry about
[46:08] yourself or the way you feel you still
[46:09] have to go traditional you still have to
[46:12] apply this say your life it doesn't
[46:14] change requirement is the same in moses'
[46:16] time it didn't matter if you fasting and
[46:18] praying every day when they say listen
[46:20] put the blood on your door post that was
[46:23] the token for that day that was the
[46:25] requirement for that day so listen God
[46:27] takes no excuses it didn't matter it
[46:30] didn't matter who you were how long
[46:32] you're there listen you're Elder you're
[46:34] a Dey or Usher you going to church for
[46:36] 20 years or 60 years it didn't matter
[46:39] the requirement was the requirement and
[46:40] that's what you had to do in order to
[46:42] pass the test God test is coming still
[46:46] amen amen he goes on here he said listen
[46:50] you can't claim anything by asness or
[46:51] sincerity or how great we are how little
[46:53] we are or whatever more we are all
[46:55] together wrong to begin with and there
[46:57] is nothing at all that we can do about
[47:00] it you cannot Jesus said who by taking
[47:04] thought can add to the stature one
[47:07] measure one cubit anything an inch you
[47:10] you you can add a foot to yourself no by
[47:12] your thought you can't do that he said
[47:14] listen read it study it examine it
[47:16] meditate upon it think I I I could add
[47:19] to me I could add to myself I could do
[47:22] this and he said no it wouldn't work you
[47:24] can't help yourself one iota so that
[47:27] just throws it all out I'm so glad it
[47:30] does because if it laid in the thought
[47:32] of knowing
[47:34] something then only smart people could
[47:36] could do it he said we poor illiterate
[47:39] people would be left out so we wouldn't
[47:41] have a chance but God Chang it or never
[47:44] had it that way in the beginning the
[47:46] churches always make it complicated God
[47:49] makes it simple simple so it it brought
[47:52] down into a place where we can all all
[47:55] of us can see it all all of us have it
[47:57] it's a whosoever will that came from the
[47:59] message you must be born again amen it's
[48:03] simple it's not complicated and know
[48:05] it's not dramatic and complex and and we
[48:07] really do understand it so if you break
[48:09] it down a little more listen this must
[48:11] be so simple that the most illiterate
[48:14] person that the little child the mother
[48:17] the housewife wherever you are could
[48:19] understand listen you mean when I look
[48:21] at myself I must be born again I want to
[48:23] be born of the the the water and of the
[48:25] spirit and if I don't do that there's a
[48:27] consequence to that it must be so simple
[48:29] that everybody could understand you
[48:31] don't need a degree and a masters and a
[48:33] doctorate to try to figure it out you
[48:35] wherever you are should be able to
[48:37] understand amen that's just the way God
[48:40] is that's the way his word is his
[48:43] instructions are clear what he's saying
[48:45] if I paraphrase all that is that listen
[48:47] you need to die you need to die to
[48:49] yourself you need die to your thoughts
[48:51] and ideas and what you feel and what you
[48:53] think and what people say about you and
[48:55] if they wrote a you about you now it
[48:58] will be really fine that sounds good but
[49:00] at the end of the day God has his
[49:03] requirements and if you don't have that
[49:05] requirement that he requires if you
[49:07] don't have that it doesn't matter you
[49:10] have nowhere to
[49:12] go amen amen amen listen at the end of
[49:16] the day you have to die in a message
[49:18] God's way that's been made for us he
[49:21] said listen there are two ways man could
[49:23] go just two not three not four just two
[49:26] he said that's his way or God's way and
[49:29] that's right way or wrong way and your
[49:32] way is always the wrong way so if you
[49:34] thought about it cancel it one time tell
[49:37] yourself listen there's my thoughts and
[49:39] ideas is my way this have to be wrong I
[49:41] want to trust God's way Faith could tap
[49:43] into God's way that's what you want to
[49:46] do and your way is always wrong it's not
[49:49] it doesn't stand a chance God's way is
[49:52] the right way you can't be in your own
[49:54] way and in God's way at the same time so
[49:56] you got to get out of your own way so
[49:58] God could have his way in you that's
[50:00] right God makes a provided way God has
[50:04] man has always wanted to make his own
[50:06] way always want to do their own thing in
[50:08] the Garden of Eden God made a man so he
[50:10] didn't have to shift for nothing God
[50:13] made him perfect but man wanted his own
[50:15] way he wanted to Tamper he wanted to
[50:17] find out he he he was curious about this
[50:20] and that and the other he wanted to find
[50:22] as soon as he did that he
[50:25] fell we've went through that this week
[50:28] and and this is the pro Prophet speaking
[50:29] he said we study it in scripture he made
[50:31] himself a religion he didn't wait for
[50:33] God to make him one he made one himself
[50:36] and he found that that his religion his
[50:38] covering wouldn't work that's always
[50:40] been man way they tried to do it for
[50:42] themselves until they realize wait no I
[50:45] do have this figured out I do have it
[50:47] figured out because it's not God
[50:51] way that's always been man he wants his
[50:53] own way but God had a way so man made
[50:55] fig leaves and put them over him and his
[50:57] wife but when he come down to face God
[51:00] he found out it wouldn't work and I tell
[51:02] you friends there's been many a man and
[51:04] is tonight that's coming down the end of
[51:06] the road we'll find out that little
[51:08] shallow religion that you're holding on
[51:10] to won't work nothing short of being
[51:13] born again will work Jesus said except a
[51:16] man be born of water and of the spirit
[51:19] he will no wise enter into the kingdom
[51:22] no wise no matter if he's a Methodist
[51:25] Baptist Presbyterian whatever he is
[51:27] he'll not enter in un until he's born of
[51:30] water and spirit and he says born means
[51:33] he's changed that's it that's it he has
[51:37] to die before he can be born so you got
[51:40] to die to yourself be reborn again in
[51:42] Christ Jesus that's right so it can't be
[51:45] you going and 20 years later you still
[51:49] the same because you are brother this
[51:51] and sister that no no no no no if you're
[51:53] not following God's way and God's
[51:55] instruction
[51:57] goes nowhere so there's a simple for
[52:00] formula
[52:02] here brother Bram said he say listen
[52:05] here's the formula if you want to know
[52:08] it the first church was inaugurated on
[52:11] the day of Pentecost they were all
[52:12] screaming and Jesus to told told them
[52:14] listen take it easy don't scream Don't
[52:17] Preach don't do nothing just be quiet is
[52:19] that what he said no no no no no he
[52:21] didn't do that Luke 24:49 he said t in
[52:25] the C of jerus Jerusalem until you be
[52:27] endued with power from on high amen
[52:30] after this the Holy Ghost now talking
[52:32] about the Holy Ghost tonight you know
[52:34] talking about the promises of God you
[52:35] know talking about the things that you
[52:37] have to have there and there to your
[52:39] heart and fight for you know this is not
[52:41] because we feeling to talk something we
[52:43] feeling to share something no this is
[52:46] imperative is essential and critical
[52:47] that you fight for this you know yes sir
[52:49] he say
[52:50] listen T until he endure the power on
[52:54] high after this the Holy Ghost will come
[52:56] upon you and you shall be Witnesses of
[52:58] me in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the
[53:01] uttermost parts of the earth amen they
[53:03] went up how long to wait how long 2 days
[53:07] 5 minutes 5 days no they went up until
[53:11] something happened it's not they went up
[53:14] and they had a a talk with each other
[53:17] and they decide well I wonder if Jesus
[53:19] meant it in a kind of figurative way
[53:22] that we kind of wait and wait might be
[53:25] an acronym for something
[53:27] and no no no they went and they
[53:30] waited under expectation that God's word
[53:34] is the same yesterday today and
[53:37] forever amen they were all in one place
[53:41] and one Accord one they weren't arguing
[53:43] they weren't fussing fighting now I'm
[53:46] Sanhedrin and and I'm a Pharisee and and
[53:48] and no no no it never come on a group
[53:50] like that not a bit never come they're
[53:53] just waiting brothers and sisters
[53:55] together women went in there with them
[53:58] they were all up there for 10 days
[54:00] waiting one Accord reading the Bible a
[54:02] little maybe someone stand up preaching
[54:04] and they waited and waited and waited
[54:06] and they saying the blessings of God has
[54:08] been promised now God said he pour the
[54:11] Holy Ghost Joel said he would do it and
[54:13] we're waiting for the word to be
[54:14] fulfilled so that's the way we need to
[54:16] be we need to know these are the
[54:19] promises here these are the requirements
[54:21] here and we waiting on God to fulfill
[54:23] the promise amen so we have to be under
[54:26] expect expectation doing what we need to
[54:28] do and allow God to operate and work and
[54:31] see his word come to pass in our
[54:33] lives amen amen glory so in a message
[54:38] hearing recognizing acting on the word
[54:40] of God I know it seems like a lot of
[54:42] quotes but when you talk about born of
[54:45] the spirit paragraph 139 it says the
[54:48] Holy Ghost is a new birth we know that
[54:51] it's being born again of the spirit of
[54:54] God that's how you're born by Spirit
[54:57] born by the spirit that's a new birth
[54:59] all right you're begotten of the spirit
[55:01] then when you're born of the spirit
[55:03] you're filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[55:05] that's why we we come to church you know
[55:07] you don't come to church to sing a song
[55:09] and Shake Hands sure that sounds good
[55:11] that feels good to to have a social
[55:13] community that sounds good but the main
[55:15] thing have to remain the main thing the
[55:18] main thing is you have to be filled with
[55:20] the Holy Ghost you have to be born of
[55:23] the water and the spirit you have to
[55:25] have what it take takes that when God
[55:27] looked down he could say there is my
[55:28] spirit flowing freely there is my
[55:31] adopted Sons and Daughters there are the
[55:33] people that apply the promises and the
[55:35] words that I leave that we could see it
[55:37] manifested in them because they wait on
[55:40] the expectation they they they accept
[55:43] the Promises by faith and know that he
[55:45] will bring it to pass amen
[55:48] amen
[55:50] glory I know we listened to to that tape
[55:52] recently adoption part one and from
[55:55] paragraph 4 6 in there I mean that was
[55:57] so powerful that was so tremendous it
[55:59] was so timely from from paragraph 46 it
[56:03] said but the Believers talking about the
[56:05] land of adoption you see all this is
[56:06] connected together you know because you
[56:09] can't have the land of adoption if you
[56:11] you don't Del into the Holy Ghost and
[56:13] you don't pray and cry and sigh to get
[56:17] it and to ensure that you are filled yes
[56:19] sir he said but the Believers the Caleb
[56:22] and Joshua outfit that was going on to
[56:24] the promise they moved on over in the
[56:25] land and took the land and settled along
[56:27] in the land as a possession and we never
[56:29] stop at justification
[56:31] sanctification let's go onto the baptism
[56:34] of the Holy Ghost that's where we want
[56:35] to go tonight let's not stop at
[56:38] Believing on the Lord Jesus being
[56:40] baptized let's not stop because he's
[56:43] cleaned us up from a life of sin but now
[56:45] we press into a position to a promise of
[56:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost for Peter
[56:50] said on the day of Pentecost for the
[56:52] promises unto you and your children and
[56:54] to them that's are far off
[56:56] even as many as the lord of the go of
[56:59] God should call so Ephesus here sets us
[57:02] like Joshua positionally so that promise
[57:05] is yours tonight that's not just
[57:07] something you read and you know God
[57:09] promised the Holy Ghost he promised it
[57:11] to you tonight you could be filled
[57:13] tonight you could receive the Holy Ghost
[57:17] tonight he says so Ephesus here sets us
[57:19] like Joshua positionally you notice
[57:22] Joshua after crossing over the land and
[57:24] taking the land divided the land Ephraim
[57:27] here Manassa here and and and one here
[57:31] God here Benjamin here he divided the
[57:33] land and notice oh this just burns our
[57:36] hearts each one of those Hebrew mothers
[57:39] giv births talking about birth pains
[57:41] here now to those children she spoke the
[57:43] very
[57:45] place in her labor pains where they
[57:47] would be positioned in the Promised Land
[57:50] by inspiration she spoke where they will
[57:52] be oh it's a great study if we could
[57:55] only get into the details
[57:56] which will take hours so we wouldn't do
[57:58] that tonight but he say you know each of
[58:02] those mothers when she called out epim
[58:05] when she was in labor positionally
[58:07] placed him where his feet were setting
[58:09] in oil just exactly every one of them
[58:12] wherever they were at and look at this
[58:14] now Joshua not knowing this but by
[58:17] inspiration led by the Holy Spirit after
[58:21] being in into the promised land give
[58:23] each man his promise exactly
[58:28] LED of the Holy Spirit after being into
[58:30] the promised land give each man his
[58:32] promise exactly what the Holy Spirit
[58:34] promised through the birth back there so
[58:36] although he he wasn't there by the birth
[58:39] the same Holy Spirit was able to inspire
[58:42] him so he could now allocate and and
[58:45] positionally place people exactly where
[58:48] the bird said that they should be amen
[58:51] how that God has set into the church
[58:53] through labor pains oh they get
[58:56] tremendous sometime when a church is
[58:59] groaning under the persecution of the
[59:01] outside world Believing on the Lord
[59:03] Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost
[59:05] and we know it is just as real to us as
[59:09] it was to Pentecost how they groan and
[59:11] cry on labor pains but when they are
[59:14] born and positionally Born Into the
[59:17] kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has
[59:19] set in the church some Apostles some
[59:21] prophets some teachers some pastors some
[59:24] evangelists then he give into there
[59:27] speaking with tongues interpretation of
[59:29] tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of
[59:31] healing all kind of Miracles so it goes
[59:34] to show it's tied together this Promised
[59:37] Land This adoption land that we speak of
[59:40] is tied back to being filled with the
[59:42] holy spirit being born and positionally
[59:46] born amen so we want to look at that
[59:49] first doctrine of Jesus and see how can
[59:51] I I I apply this to my life is it
[59:54] applicable now yes because you need to
[59:56] be filled you need to be sealed if the
[1:00:00] goal is perfection and adoption and
[1:00:01] every promise that he has promised to
[1:00:04] you you need to do the things that he
[1:00:06] require of you to get
[1:00:09] it yes
[1:00:12] sir
[1:00:14] Glory thank you Jesus Hallelujah going
[1:00:17] back to that message hearing recognizing
[1:00:19] and acting on the word of God this is
[1:00:22] just just to look out a little bit
[1:00:24] people come up and say got the Holy
[1:00:26] Ghost
[1:00:28] too say look the way they
[1:00:31] live it doesn't last from one Revival to
[1:00:34] another from one meeting to another it's
[1:00:37] made manifest they haven't got it so
[1:00:39] they get exposed they could say what
[1:00:42] they want but when we look at the
[1:00:44] actions the actions must line up as well
[1:00:47] so I have a note here no imitations we
[1:00:49] not looking for imitations we're looking
[1:00:51] for the real thing we looking for the
[1:00:53] real silver dollar we don't want a fraud
[1:00:56] we don't want a fake it
[1:00:59] says if a man is born of the spirit of
[1:01:02] God or a woman they have fruits of the
[1:01:04] spirit they walk Godly they live that
[1:01:07] life see they keep away from the things
[1:01:10] of the world God moves in them and makes
[1:01:12] himself manifest and proves that he's
[1:01:14] God working in there the other is
[1:01:16] impersonating see impersonations that's
[1:01:20] what's been all the way down
[1:01:21] impersonating look at ishma and Isaac
[1:01:24] and all the way down impersonating look
[1:01:26] at the prophet
[1:01:27] Moses and look at the prophet bam see
[1:01:30] see how they come down look at Judas and
[1:01:32] look at Jesus and Jesus predicts that
[1:01:35] this Holy Spirit in the last days would
[1:01:37] be the Seal of God now what would be the
[1:01:39] mark of the beast would be to reject the
[1:01:42] Seal of God for all that didn't have the
[1:01:45] Seal of God had the mark of the beast
[1:01:47] and if it's two spiritual marks one of
[1:01:49] them will be the true Mark and the other
[1:01:52] would be an apostasy can you see it look
[1:01:55] at the Mark the Old Testament when the
[1:01:57] trumpet blowed the Jubilee every so many
[1:02:00] years the slaves went free because the
[1:02:02] trumpet sounded well everyone that
[1:02:05] wanted to be free could go but listen
[1:02:08] some of them they love to be
[1:02:11] slaves so when brother Bram speak about
[1:02:14] three kinds of believers they sit
[1:02:16] together know they worship together they
[1:02:18] go conventions and meetings and thing
[1:02:20] together but some of them love to be
[1:02:22] slaves in church good good church
[1:02:26] members you know love to be
[1:02:28] slaves he said listen everyone who
[1:02:31] wanted to be free could go but some of
[1:02:33] them love to be slaves so they took them
[1:02:35] to an altar and in the post of the
[1:02:37] church they bought their air with an owl
[1:02:40] and they were marked forever they will
[1:02:42] always serve their master and today
[1:02:45] you'll hear the gospel message on truth
[1:02:47] now you can be free if you want to and I
[1:02:50] say tonight you could be free if you
[1:02:51] want to you could receive the Holy Ghost
[1:02:54] if you want to you could be born born of
[1:02:56] the spirit if you want to but there are
[1:02:58] those who like to be slaves you like the
[1:03:01] Taskmaster you like the relationship in
[1:03:04] bondage right so they bore your air and
[1:03:07] he says he BS you in the air and you'll
[1:03:10] always be an intellectual believer
[1:03:12] Hallelujah he didn't say you'll be a
[1:03:14] sinner no he didn't say to throw out the
[1:03:15] church but you're intellectual believer
[1:03:18] Hallelujah you'll be religious soundss
[1:03:22] familiar second Timothy talk about that
[1:03:24] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:03:26] the power amen he say listen You'll Be
[1:03:30] always be an intellectual believer
[1:03:32] you'll be religious and you'll go to
[1:03:34] church so it's people sitting in the
[1:03:37] message we're talking about we're not
[1:03:38] talking about other denominations and
[1:03:41] other groups no in the church you go to
[1:03:43] church but never receive the Holy Ghost
[1:03:46] why see then you serve that for the rest
[1:03:48] of your day now the mark of the beast or
[1:03:51] the Seal of God we getting so close this
[1:03:54] is the prophet message this is his words
[1:03:57] so so don't be surprised you find it not
[1:04:00] resonating with you this is what you
[1:04:01] need to fight for he said because
[1:04:03] there's a next group too a next group
[1:04:06] who are slave they they are bondage they
[1:04:08] listen they are so bound that they come
[1:04:10] into church Sunday Wednesday prayer
[1:04:14] meeting they fasting but they slaves
[1:04:17] they will never receive the Holy Ghost
[1:04:19] but they come back and forth nice
[1:04:21] easygoing church members we want to
[1:04:23] fight against that we want to to stand
[1:04:26] up and have a opposition against that
[1:04:28] because that's not what we call upon
[1:04:30] that's not what we call on to we call
[1:04:33] unto a higher level we call unto the
[1:04:36] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:04:39] Amen my my my we we want to be called
[1:04:43] out ones we want to be special we want
[1:04:46] to live up to our calling I just kind of
[1:04:49] skip through here in a message five
[1:04:51] definite identifications of the True
[1:04:54] Church of the Living God come on right
[1:04:57] he say you don't know nothing about it
[1:04:58] until you receive the Holy Ghost so
[1:05:00] let's just pause right there he say you
[1:05:02] don't know anything about it until you
[1:05:04] receive the Holy Ghost so it doesn't
[1:05:06] matter how long you're in the message it
[1:05:08] don't matter if you have a reserved seat
[1:05:10] or if you're well respected and we shake
[1:05:12] your hand a particular way and celebrate
[1:05:14] your birthday and your anniversary it
[1:05:16] doesn't matter he say you don't know
[1:05:18] nothing about it until you receive the
[1:05:20] Holy Ghost you say I accept Jesus as my
[1:05:23] personal savior that's all awesome
[1:05:26] brother have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:05:28] since you believe if you don't you can't
[1:05:31] even call him Lord because he's not your
[1:05:33] Lord amen he's a historical being that
[1:05:36] you by faith have accepted but when he's
[1:05:39] come into you by the Holy Ghost then he
[1:05:43] is your lord no man can call Jesus Lord
[1:05:46] only by by the Holy Ghost until you're
[1:05:48] born of the spirit that's where we want
[1:05:50] to go tonight until you're born of the
[1:05:52] spirit and the Holy Ghost is in you then
[1:05:55] if you are you're born into this Kingdom
[1:05:57] and you're part of the church you're the
[1:05:59] called out ones amen then you become
[1:06:02] called out not not not not not by saying
[1:06:04] a Creed and saying two lines and you
[1:06:06] could quote two scriptures and a
[1:06:08] paragraph in the message no no no when
[1:06:10] the Holy Ghost in you then you could
[1:06:13] become one of the call out ones then you
[1:06:15] can acknowledge him as your Lord amen
[1:06:18] that's when he become real to you he
[1:06:20] said Can Life come out of a corn except
[1:06:22] the corn have life in it if a grain of
[1:06:25] corn is put in the ground one is
[1:06:27] dramatized and one is not the one that
[1:06:29] is not dramatized can it live again the
[1:06:32] answer is no not by no means because
[1:06:34] there's nothing in it there's no deep on
[1:06:36] the inside calling to a deep so there's
[1:06:39] nothing to respond there's no life in
[1:06:41] there there's nothing in it although
[1:06:44] materially it make just as good it look
[1:06:46] like corn you can make corn flakes it it
[1:06:49] it's it's all right it has some
[1:06:51] usefulness but really it have no life
[1:06:54] it'll make listen he say you can make
[1:06:56] some cornbread as the other it look good
[1:06:59] on a shelf as the other one will but if
[1:07:02] it hasn't got life in it in it it cannot
[1:07:04] Rise Again a man that's good and and we
[1:07:07] highlighted this earlier you could be a
[1:07:08] good man can be just as as good a church
[1:07:12] member as any Christian a man that's a
[1:07:15] good man can be just as good a citizen
[1:07:18] you you you could be respectable in your
[1:07:20] community you could be some somebody
[1:07:22] they need prayer they call you you're
[1:07:24] the first person to think of love and
[1:07:26] that sounds good he said but you could
[1:07:29] be moral when you die that's it unless
[1:07:32] he's born again of the spirit of God
[1:07:35] because everything that had a beginning
[1:07:37] has a end God is the only thing that's
[1:07:40] Eternal therefore we are part of God by
[1:07:44] receiving his life Jesus said I give
[1:07:47] unto them eternal life the Greek word
[1:07:49] there is Zoe meaning God's own life the
[1:07:51] only way you could ever live again is to
[1:07:54] be raised up again
[1:07:56] amen because God is eternal and you've
[1:07:58] got eternal life and skipping Dre he
[1:08:02] said he that believeth on me has eternal
[1:08:04] life and I'll raise him up at the last
[1:08:06] day raise him up again so he not raising
[1:08:09] your flesh you know he he raising the
[1:08:12] life that in you that eternal life that
[1:08:14] he plac in you that is what raising
[1:08:19] up he said listen Jesus you can't go to
[1:08:22] Heaven until you're a member of that
[1:08:24] church you can't be a member until
[1:08:26] you're born and this is where it gets
[1:08:27] good and now let me smother you a little
[1:08:30] you can't be a member unless God has
[1:08:33] called you to be a member
[1:08:35] am how happy you ought to be for that to
[1:08:39] know that you were
[1:08:41] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:08:43] the world and your name was written on
[1:08:46] the Lamb's Book of Life for such a time
[1:08:49] as this called unto Perfection called
[1:08:54] for these Pro promises to be made real
[1:08:56] in your life so this is not by chance we
[1:08:59] don't GA in vain we don't we don't get
[1:09:02] together hoping that God have a special
[1:09:05] promise for us no no no no no he chose
[1:09:08] us before the foundation of the Earth
[1:09:12] because he had a special mission for you
[1:09:14] but to accomplish that he needs to give
[1:09:17] you special tools he need to make sure
[1:09:20] you trained and you have special skills
[1:09:23] so he send Special Love gifts for you so
[1:09:26] he leads special promises just for you
[1:09:30] it skipped the wise and The Prudent it
[1:09:32] skipped the proud it skipped the the
[1:09:35] intelligent and smart and those who try
[1:09:37] to figure it out and he chose you for
[1:09:40] this time to send this message to you
[1:09:44] you have a part to
[1:09:47] play because many are called you know
[1:09:51] few are chosen you're one of the chosen
[1:09:53] ones as a result
[1:09:55] he chose you and lay these promises for
[1:09:58] such a time that when it revealed unto
[1:10:01] us we hear that like a eagle call so it
[1:10:04] resonate in us and we realize wait now
[1:10:07] what we doing all the time I'm not a
[1:10:09] chicken I don't belong here I in this
[1:10:12] world but I find I don't feel like
[1:10:14] everybody else I don't dress like
[1:10:16] everybody else I don't look like
[1:10:18] everybody else because I'm not meant to
[1:10:20] be here my father is at a higher level
[1:10:25] he he called me onto Perfection and
[1:10:27] adoption and he gave me the Victory and
[1:10:30] he give me tests he give me trials and
[1:10:32] guess what he sent a tutor he sent go
[1:10:35] Governors to ensure that my signature is
[1:10:38] like his he want to know that I'm about
[1:10:40] his business he want to know that the
[1:10:42] things he lay out for me I could pass it
[1:10:44] the test they set for me I could pass it
[1:10:46] and guess what he is just and fair he
[1:10:49] say if I fail the test now you know what
[1:10:50] going to happen do it again you fail it
[1:10:53] again do it again listen he don't
[1:10:55] believe in failures he believe in
[1:10:57] success he want you to overcome he say
[1:11:00] you're more than conquerors he say
[1:11:02] you're more than Overcomers so he know
[1:11:05] you have what it takes but you and I are
[1:11:07] not the same you might be faster than me
[1:11:10] you might be slower than me but at the
[1:11:12] end of the day we all have to come
[1:11:14] through that's why the writer say some
[1:11:16] through the water some through the flood
[1:11:19] some through great trials all have to
[1:11:22] come through the blood in Egypt it
[1:11:25] didn't matter I say that it didn't
[1:11:27] matter who you thought you were it
[1:11:30] didn't matter if you were old or young
[1:11:31] if you're rich or poor it didn't matter
[1:11:33] what your position was whether you
[1:11:34] thought you was a low slave whether you
[1:11:37] were in charge or a supervisor or a
[1:11:38] manager it didn't matter when he gave
[1:11:42] his requirements you had to yes sir I'm
[1:11:46] reporting for Duty that's what I'm
[1:11:48] required to do because a certain trumpet
[1:11:50] song and freedom was under way and I'm
[1:11:53] here saying tonight just like I said

[1:12:03] slaves we don't want to be in bondage we
[1:12:06] don't want to be bounded we want to have
[1:12:08] what it takes so when we hear that eagle
[1:12:10] call when that trumpet sound we are
[1:12:13] ready we are ready for our March and
[1:12:15] orders because we train for this we
[1:12:18] prepare for this we have been in the

[1:12:29] have this message and we've gone through
[1:12:30] the message it has taken years the
[1:12:33] prophet has come off the scene but his
[1:12:35] message is still here and we have gone
[1:12:39] through and pulled out the things that
[1:12:41] are applicable to us yes it's our
[1:12:44] responsibility to know what our
[1:12:46] inheritance is it's our responsibility
[1:12:48] to know what God left for us if we don't
[1:12:53] somebody else might take it I don't want
[1:12:55] to give away my inheritance because of
[1:12:58] ignorance I want to ensure that whatever
[1:13:01] he left for me I want it like like
[1:13:03] Joshua and Caleb when Caleb say
[1:13:05] listen give me my Mountain don't look at
[1:13:09] my age it don't matter if it's left for
[1:13:12] me I want it if the Holy Ghost was left

[1:13:20] think or what you feel it don't matter
[1:13:22] if I ball and scream and cry if this is
[1:13:24] what it takes I wanted because it's mine
[1:13:27] This Promise was left for me and I'm not
[1:13:30] playing I'm not not putting it a chance
[1:13:33] I'm going to apply this to my life and
[1:13:35] ensure that this promise is mine I
[1:13:38] claiming it by faith I claiming it
[1:13:41] knowing that he who left the promise is
[1:13:44] more than able to make a way to ensure
[1:13:48] that that promise could come to pass
[1:13:51] amen my my my hallelujah thank you
[1:13:55] Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:13:59] thank you Lamb of God what we need what
[1:14:03] we need at the end of the day is not
[1:14:05] more talk it's
[1:14:08] not it's not more
[1:14:10] Ling is not fancy
[1:14:14] fellowships what we need is a guide we
[1:14:17] need somebody who know the we when you
[1:14:20] hear a guide it assumes that you gone
[1:14:22] before you know the PA you're not trying
[1:14:24] to figure it out if the guy trying to
[1:14:27] figure it out he's a fraud he would have
[1:14:30] gone the way before and say listen come
[1:14:32] this is the way to go don't go there
[1:14:34] this is the way if you take this way
[1:14:37] this way will lead you to the promised
[1:14:39] land that's a guide brother brandom in a
[1:14:44] message Hallelujah a guide Hallelujah
[1:14:48] paragraph 39 he said a guide isn't going
[1:14:51] to take one over this way and one over
[1:14:54] that way
[1:14:55] he's not going to send one East and send
[1:14:57] one West that's not how they work he say
[1:15:00] he's going to keep it together and if we
[1:15:02] let the Holy Ghost keep us together
[1:15:05] we'll be one if we just don't let the
[1:15:09] devil pull you off on the wrong road
[1:15:12] we'll be one heart one mind one Accord
[1:15:15] by one Spirit the Holy Spirit the guide
[1:15:17] of God that will guide us to all truth
[1:15:21] that's right but you got to follow your
[1:15:23] guide yes sir
[1:15:26] said look at Nicodemus he needed a guide
[1:15:29] yet he was a smart man he was a teacher
[1:15:33] about 80 years old he was of the
[1:15:35] Pharisees or the Sanhedrin Courts of
[1:15:37] council Ministerial
[1:15:40] Association he was one of the greatest
[1:15:43] men a teacher in Israel a master at it
[1:15:46] think a master teacher yes he know the
[1:15:50] laws he know the laws he studied it but
[1:15:54] when it come to being born again he
[1:15:56] needed a guide yes sir he was hungering
[1:16:00] for it he know there had to be something
[1:16:03] different his expression to Christ that
[1:16:06] night proved it it proved also this the
[1:16:09] feeling of the rest of them but none of
[1:16:11] them had the the very audacity that he
[1:16:15] had there was none of them that could
[1:16:17] come up there and do what he did you all
[1:16:20] people condemn you know sometimes we
[1:16:21] condemn Nicodemus we say you know he
[1:16:23] come by night because was he was so
[1:16:25] embarrassed and Afraid and ashamed and
[1:16:27] he didn't want anybody to know what he
[1:16:28] was doing so the scripture say you know
[1:16:31] he went to Jesus by
[1:16:33] night brother brandom said you know
[1:16:35] although that might be so listen to this
[1:16:38] he say he got there he arrived so
[1:16:42] tonight somebody might say I don't know
[1:16:45] you're going to church on a Wednesday
[1:16:46] night Sunday same way looking the same
[1:16:50] way I don't know what wrong with them
[1:16:51] they could St and and hook up you know
[1:16:53] they could connect you know but you know
[1:16:55] what they went anyway they came anyway
[1:17:00] because they were determined to Touch
[1:17:02] the Hem of His Garment that night he was
[1:17:05] hungering for something so he didn't
[1:17:08] stand a far off he did what none of the
[1:17:10] others was willing to do they say he got
[1:17:13] there he arrived I know some people
[1:17:16] won't even start day or night but he got
[1:17:19] there he needed a guide and he said
[1:17:21] Master we from the San hedron Court we
[1:17:25] know that you are a teacher come from
[1:17:26] God why did he know it he was Vindicated
[1:17:30] see he wanted to know what this new
[1:17:33] birth meant and he went to the right one
[1:17:36] because God had Vindicated that this was
[1:17:38] his guide Jesus look what he said Master
[1:17:42] we know thou art a teacher comes from
[1:17:45] God cuz no man can do the things that
[1:17:47] you do Les God be with him it was a
[1:17:50] Vindication there that there was a
[1:17:52] living God inside him keep in mind this
[1:17:55] was an educated man a well respected man
[1:17:58] a learned man a great man in society he
[1:18:01] was an elder he was somebody that would
[1:18:03] have seen a lot that would have
[1:18:05] experienced a lot that would have been
[1:18:07] exposed to a lot and he needed a guide
[1:18:10] so who am I and who are we tonight when
[1:18:13] we have such a guide when we have the
[1:18:15] holy spirit to guide us to all truth to
[1:18:19] guide us from day to day to guide us to
[1:18:23] our promises amen
[1:18:25] he said
[1:18:27] listen he said no man could do the
[1:18:30] things that you do lest God be with him
[1:18:33] it was a Vindication there that there
[1:18:35] was a living God inside of him what he
[1:18:38] testified not me that doeth the works
[1:18:41] it's my father that dwelleth in me
[1:18:43] verily I say unto you the son can do
[1:18:45] nothing in himself but what he sees the
[1:18:48] father doing that doeth the son likewise
[1:18:50] the father work it and I work it hither
[1:18:52] too in other words God showed him what
[1:18:55] to do that's what a guy does he showed
[1:18:58] him what to do and he went and just
[1:19:00] acted it out he didn't do anything until
[1:19:03] God told him to do it amen that's a real
[1:19:06] Frank facts of it if we just move and
[1:19:09] wait till the spirit moved us to do it
[1:19:12] that's it and then be so completely lost
[1:19:15] in Christ that he don't have to shove
[1:19:17] you around like he does me but the first
[1:19:20] little knot of his head you're ready and
[1:19:22] nothing is going to stop you because
[1:19:24] because you know it's the will of God
[1:19:27] that's how we want to know God God just
[1:19:29] have to nud and we know what to do we
[1:19:32] know that's his will that's not my
[1:19:34] thoughts and ideas that's not your
[1:19:36] opinion or your recommendation but
[1:19:38] that's the will of God because we in
[1:19:41] tune and in sync and in line with his
[1:19:43] thoughts and his idea my my my God isn't
[1:19:46] he wonderful
[1:19:49] tonight amen amen amen it said
[1:19:52] listen wonderful he know the Traditions
[1:19:56] that he had served maybe by the
[1:19:58] Pharisees Sadducees and whatever more he
[1:20:00] had served those Creeds all along and
[1:20:02] seen nothing happen but here comes a man
[1:20:05] on the scene saying that he is a
[1:20:07] promised Messiah of the Bible then he
[1:20:09] turns around and does the very works of
[1:20:11] God Jesus said if I don't do the works
[1:20:14] of my father then don't believe me but
[1:20:16] if you can't believe me believe the very
[1:20:18] works that I do for the testify of me
[1:20:21] then no wonder Nicodemus could say
[1:20:23] master we know you're a teacher come
[1:20:25] from God for no man can do the things
[1:20:28] that you do without go God being with
[1:20:30] him see he needed a guide though he was
[1:20:34] a master of the thing he was a master of
[1:20:36] his church he had dignity and he had
[1:20:39] prominent places he was a great man no
[1:20:42] doubt respects from all people through
[1:20:45] the country but when it come to being
[1:20:47] born again he needed a guide so do we we
[1:20:51] need a guide
[1:20:53] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:20:58] Lord the musicians could get get ready
[1:21:01] as we wind down
