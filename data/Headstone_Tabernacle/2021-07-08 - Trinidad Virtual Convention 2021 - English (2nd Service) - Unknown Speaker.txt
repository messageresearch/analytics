dispensation of another ephesians and when ephesians is mentioned to the gentile church it means another time of restoration and a time of perfection another time of holiness another time of harvest another time that god's predestinated thoughts are going to be made manifest so we are so identified with this inspiration and we know that this gentile bride is a part of this dispensation of the of this ephesians because without this ephesians you cannot see the manifestation of sons of god on the earth so this inspiration actually it's present tense just before the coming of the lord the bible

ephesians chapter 2 oh praise god when you speak of ephesians then you are speaking about me the gentile bride we are pleased right in this ephesians ephesians 2 verse 6 there he said here and had raised us up together and made us sit in heavenly places in christ jesus was paul talking to the church of ephesus that was not israel that was a gentile church and paul was talking to this gentile god has raised them up and made them sit in heavenly places in christ jesus and that's where i'm seated and that's where you are seated if you're a bride that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through jesus christ and this is the time that god is showing them kindness to his people for by grace are you safe through faith that not of yourself it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship oh you church of the living god you bride of christ you gentile church in this efficient dispensation paul said you are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god had before ordained that we should walk in them wherefore remember that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called on circumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at the time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of christ oh my may god bless the reading of his word so this dispensation of the of ephesians brings us near and closer to manifested sons of god it brings us to the position of manifested sons of god it brings us to christ jesus that's what paul is saying here amen oh it brings us to perfection this ephesians is preparing us into the rapture this dispensation is preparing us into the rapture the holy spirit is the leader in this dispensation it's not a church it's not a group of persons no but it's the holy spirit himself god himself filled himself in the fight for ministry leading the church to perfection leading this bride unto adoption amen the ephesians is the perfection of the gentile bride we thank god for his grace for this glorious time in this ephesians is a perfection of the gentile bride predestinated

into the deep that is to bring up cross again from the dead and we shall descend into the deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead but what said it the word is an idea even in their mouth and in that heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thy heart that god has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation verse 14 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall the preach accept that be sent as it is written how beautiful our feet of them that preach the

us apostle prophet evangelist pastors teachers for the perfecting of the sins he made some as us as us until he himself charity the dynamic the supernatural power will come down in these people and then he will adopt them in the father's house and they will enter they will get into their original task amen god said to his prophets through the work of an evangelist he was not yet an evangelist but he was a prophet he was born a prophet but he wants to do the work of an evangelist until one day [Applause] when god adopted him then at that time he was a mighty prophet messenger hallelujah

something will happen and i will get into the original ministry no demon can stop that blessed be the name of the lord probably his seven church ages amen he said he is prophet messenger he will be the mouthpiece he will be god's mouthpiece and as malachi 4 she said he will bring back the hearts of the people to the father he will bring the enlightened of the last days and i will hear from a

hard when the church is groaning under the persecution of the words the stereo words and she believes in the lord jesus christ and she believed that the promise of the holy spirit is as real for us as it was in the days of pentecost when she's growing and she's whipping under the pains it is a growth that is tight [Applause] [Music] but when people are born and attack the position in the kingdom of god through the breath hallelujah god said to moses take my people out of egypt and egypt was not in the promised land the wilderness was not in the promised land but the promised land it was canada it is it gainer that is where the promised land was but many came out and there was still in the wilderness that died in the wilderness through idolatry there was that they died through the teaching
