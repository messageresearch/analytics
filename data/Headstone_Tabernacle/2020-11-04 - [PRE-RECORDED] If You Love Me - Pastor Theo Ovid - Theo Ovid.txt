the word lord the hearers of the word take me out of the way as you speak your word speak your word to your people father we need to hear from you tonight granted lord in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you and welcome if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn this in john chapter 14 we want to read from verse 13 to 26 we also read from matthew chapter 21 verse 23 to 32 two portion scriptures tonight it's in john chapter 14 reading from verse 13 i believe we read sin john 14 12 on sunday we just want to go a little further reading john 14 13. this is jesus speaking whatsoever he shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it if you love me watch those words now if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth one whom the world cannot receive because it seat him not you don't know what him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you one shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world's yet me no more but he shouts you see me because i live he shall live also at that day shall know that i am in my father and even me and i knew he that had my commandments and keeped them he just that love at me and he that loved me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him now judas said unto him not his carrot lord how is it that thou would manifest thyself unto us are not unto the world and jesus went to explain jesus answered and said unto him if a man loves me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our board with him he that love it me not keep it not my sins and the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me these things have i spoken unto you being present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you i returned to matthew chapter 21 we want to read from verse 23. and when he had come unto the temple the chief priest and the elders of the people came under him as he was teaching and said by what authority does though by what authority does doubt these things and who give thee this authority and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one thing which if you tell me i and likewise will tell you by what authority i do these things the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men and they reason within themselves with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did he not then believe him but if we shall see of men we fear the people for all whole john as a prophet and they they answered jesus and said we cannot tell he said unto them neither would tell i you by what authority i do these things but what think he a certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go work today into my vanguard and he answered and said i will not but afterwards he repented and went and he came to the second and said likewise and he said answered and said i go sir and went not wither of them twain did the will of his father they said unto him the first and jesus said unto them verily i sent to you that the publicans and the hearts go into the kingdom of god before you for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and you believe him not but the publicans and the harlots believe him and ye when you have seen it repented not afterwards that you might believe him may god bless his word you may be seated oh this is the powerful scriptures tonight o praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord you love him then sue them but the title tonight is if you love me that's what jesus said right he said it in in verse 15 of saint john 14. if you love me keep my commandments so i took the title from there if you love me and matthew 21 have a parable so our inspiration the will of the father and this is brother branham he was saying here dear jesus help us tonight in these two words as we wait upon thee and we pray that your grace and mercy will be with us lord and tend our hearts move back all the shocks the thorns the thistles let the blessed sunshine of god fall in upon the word lord and may we have such a great meeting until they'll not be an unsafe person among us all the children will be in the kingdom of god those without the baptism of the spirit may they receive it further may all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age lord we reveal unveil to us that we that we will see the plainness of god so that we will know how to behave ourselves and act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into the discipline to the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching of the lord jesus christ so he said that the mystery we supposed to know may be unveiled and once it's unveiled it's to bring the word plain to us that god can be made known to you being made plain to you hear what for that we may know how to behave know how to talk how to behave so all the teachings and all the mysteries and all the revelation is to bring you and i into a behavior because talk is talk and the bible gave the parable of these two sons one said i will not and the other one say i will go sir the first son changes mine and went and do what was supposed to be done the second son said he's willing i'll go sir they talk and didn't do it which one did the will of the father and jesus busted those hypocrites he busted them and tell them them halats and prostitutes and all the kind of people they're gonna get in the kingdom of god before you because this is not a talking thing this is the walking thing you're not walking they're not talking now you have to walk the talk oh glory to god you have to walk in this light is that that talking thing is not a pulpit single teaching thing no you've got to come to on to conform yourself to the word of god if you love me keep my commandments not talk my commandments do i hear a shout in the house do i hear amen in the house you have to want to keep his commandments or you have to want to obey his word that means you coming into obedience of his word that means a committed obedience to his will and then the blessings of god begin to follow you oh glory to god because you're walking in god's will hallelujah do you believe that let's continue to be born of the spirit is to believe and behave yourself in the spirit to understand and believe in your heart that jesus is the christ and this is his word and no other words can be added to it or taken from it without your name taken out of the book of life that's a strong one if you add one think to it your tradition take from it you said well christ himself said your name shall be rubbed off the book of life no i was going to skip it i'll beat you now let me read it again to be born of the spirit is to believe and behave yourself in the spirit it's not you doing anything and you're doing your own thing and you're a christian no no believe and behave you believe the words you've got to behave yourself and that will show your bone of the spirit when you can believe and behave yourself in the spirit let's continue do you say you must be born again in order to be born again it's letting yourself go and die and the spirit of christ coming to you then you are no more yours it is christ in you the holy spirit paul said ideally yet i live you're not but christ live it in me oh praise god now if i told you the spirit of john delinquent will mean me i'll have guns and be an outlaw if i have told you that the spirit of an artist you expect me to paint the picture of an artist if i tell you i'm a christian and the spirit of christ is in me then we will do the works of christ jesus said in sin john he that believer to me the words that i do shall you do also no excuses no excuses the true church is saying mark 16 in action not in talking in action not an explanation in action in other words this would have to come alive you must want to see it alive there must be a peace in your spirit there's a place in your soul for a manifested reality come on now come on i'll say amen glory to god did you get what i'm saying not for me to be explaining explaining and talking and talking no you must want another place in your heart for a manifested reality you want this word to come alive you want a dead man behind the pulpit you want people to die out you want to be surrendering to the lord death have a price that ever cost all glory to god you purge your own soul oh glory to god when god tells the prophet be more sincere he went and fast for three days because he was purging himself because god saw something in him that needed to come out oh give the lord i shout and when god looking at you you're going to see something in you you can see your neighbor business mind your own business see what's inside of you that have to come out oh give the lord a shout hallelujah praise god praise god praise god oh hallelujah thank you lord i enjoy this what i'm about to share with you here now jesus is walking alone in the midst of his churches i am here that walk in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks there is no one else with him neither indeed can there be for he alone wrought her salvation and having purchased her with his own blood he owns her so you ain't belong to no man this nonsense the only the people is the pastor why some kind of foolishness tell you is that one wife i have like mary but about make a one reference and they kneel that down like a doctrine there goes our next church you should come adultery all kind of foolishness this is what he says here and when he talked to the angel by the device he said come here i will show you the bride the lamb's wife [Music] not some pasta wife the lamb's wife not some church why so you don't belong to no man you belong to god do you believe that he wrought he alone wrought her salvation and have having purchased her with his own blood he owns her he is her lord and master she gives him all the glory and that glory he will not share with another there is no pope with him there is no archbishop with him mary the mother of his earthly body buddy is not with him hallelujah he does not speak and turn to our father for he is the father he does not turn to give orders to the holy spirit for he is god the eternal spirit and it is his life that is flowing and pulsating in the church giving a life without him there will be no life or give the lord a shout no message pope no man of the hour or glory no pastor pope oh no bishop not by this one man all that nonsense is he alone walking in the midst of the church and that's why he said when we come back to them seven thunders it will be christ it omits him moving in and out and then you're worshiping the living christ okay the lord i shout this is prophecy hanging over you oh glory to god i lie not this is a word what's promised oh glory to god is the boss man alone it is christ alone no no angel walking with him no no bishop walked with him no no archbishop walking in him it is christ alone give the lord a shout on that one let's continue there is no one with him when he tried the fierceness of the rat of the fiery furnace it was not another but him who hung upon the cross and give his blood he is the author and finisher of our fate not the pastor not some evangelist not some teacher or the pastor he is the author and the finisher of the faith that we are preaching he sent the prophet eternal hearts back to the faith of the fathers and he is the author and he is the finisher don't let the devil finish you he is the author the one who start the good work in you is able to finish it okay the lord has shown he that start the good work in you is able to complete it [Applause] glory he is alpha an omega of our salvation we are exposed to him and not another to no man you exposed to him and not another we don't belong to the church we belong to him his word is law creeds dogmas bylaws constitution has no effect on us none fair go abundant organization hallelujah the tradition of the illness in this message fire abundant all glory to god nobody has been here before we're moving into new grounds all glory to god there is no example church oh glory to god the example churches back there oh hallelujah the original apostolic church alpha church is the example church we're going back to alpha [Applause] my do you see it now [Applause] so no chad no no church no man no no organization no ministry you can make style in the bride and say well we have it nobody just have it all that kind of foolishness we all waiting for dynamics to the mechanics dynamics is yet to strike yes we can see the powers here when god take the prophet he didn't get the power when god take the prophets he didn't take the angel the angel said he prophesied but the power have to come to you when they were walking with jesus they was walking with power you know he said i am with you but this thing shall be in you they had power with him that dynamic with him their glory with him the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt with him he said but if i don't go the comforter will not come he said but i will not leave you comfortless i am going to come to you if you love me you're going to keep my commandments oh glory to god how is it you want to manifest yourself to us and not to the world well when you keep the commandments i am the father we will come to you and manifest ourselves to you and at that day you shall know i am in the father you and me and i knew oh glory to god you have no pastor inside of there no you have no bishop inside there you know he to ain't in between inside of the animal he said that you shall know what i am in the father you and me and i and you i don't know what you become a powerhouse okay the lord i shall god want to empower you god above us god with us i know god and you and i do you believe that tonight all right let's continue i like that by laws and because you have no effect on us and and when the lord tell them pick up the pen and write he said no other what did he say um they can't they can't listen to nobody else um no not not that one we pick a pen and write he said something like um no no one can make them do otherwise that's a big one when you say no one you mean no one no high man no bishop man no international man no message man no jeff man american man europe man no man no one could do them they have just said the lord or they keep still and there's only one man got dossier the lord and that was the prophet now the bride couldn't have doctor the lord because the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word so the bride will have to say of the lord i say tonight we have thoughts here the lord when we preach this word is dusty of the lord oh glory to god we're not preaching our dream tonight we're not praising our feeling tonight we're preaching what the words here tonight all do you believe that tonight there is going to be a revival in trinidad there's going to be a 7 under revival there's gonna be a holy ghost revival i am convinced of that that's why i'm preaching that oh glory to god hallelujah i'm anointing that it has to happen it's got to happen [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] let me be seated hallelujah it is god in her willing and doing his good pleasure he said never forget that you have only one relationship to god and god has only one relationship to you that is jesus and jesus alone since jesus alone in the midst right let's continue now there is with seven stars in his right hand this jesus who is alone he have seven what stars in his right hand the right hand or arm signifies the power and authority psalms 44 3 for they got not the land and possession by their own sword neither did their own arms save them but thy right hand dynam and the light of thy countenance because favor unto them in that right hand of power our seven stars who according to revelation 120 are the seven church messengers this signifies that the very power and authority of god are behind his messengers to every age these messengers are trying a thing these messengers are in his hand his power and authority is backing them up [Applause] [Music] so when you hear from these messengers you are hearing from the empowered authority of god coming through the mount of these messengers that's why they fought for to bring back every age they fought all glory to god because everybody have a word that was lost the world was divided through seven ages and to bring back the fullness of the holy ghost you have to bring back the fullness of the word so they have to come and guard all the words they're tied back in the world to bring down the holy ghost the object is to bring back power in the church god hates a powerless church come on preach now to me somebody god hates don't forget that he hates it he hates a powerless church the early church was a powerful church a church with jesus walking in it people god added to the church no man joined up to them oh glory to god because people are being judged in the church he people have been healed in the church oh glory to god and he said we're getting back to that we're coming right back to that god can't lie he said i am alpha and omega oh glory to god everything else in between but the same alpha anointing will come back on your omega anointing the same power that was in the early church community at alpha church omega church hallelujah are you with me they go forth with fire these messengers they go over the fire and power of the holy ghost with the word they are stars because they reflect light the light that reflects is his light they have no light on their own they kindle not their own fires that men may walk in the light of their sparks isaiah 50 11 it is night for that is when the stars come out it is night of blackness of sin for all even the whole world have sinned and constantly fallen short of the glory of god these seven messengers are making god known to the people he that received them received him that sent them and he quotes in john 13 20. oh glory to god hallelujah praise god oh give the lord some praises oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord praise his wonderful name hallelujah praise god praise god hallelujah hallelujah and saint john 15 20 13 20 says very very less unto you he that receive at whomsoever i send receive at me and he that received me received him that sent me so god send seven messengers with seven messages with seven voices with seven eyes oh glory to god he sends seven messengers oh glory to god and william branham him and gather all the messages oh glory to god to bring one message praise god to get us up that pyramid to get us up into the love divine to get us up into perfection oh glory to god god accept that which is in part until when that was a perfect has come path is tolerable until when death is perfect has come but when that was proven he has come then that was in patch i'll done away with it so when perfection come god wants perfection come on give the lord a shout glory to god you can't get impact when perfection is dumb [Applause] all right let's continue he stands behind them with all power of the godhead hallelujah jesus said all power is given unto me in heaven on earth go he therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and holy ghost teaching them and observe what essa commanded you isn't that right so there they are full of the holy ghost and faith on fire with the fire of god holding forth the word of truth there he stands to back them up and think of it not one believer of any age need to cry in his oh that i might have been back there in the last age when the apostles were sent out there is no need to look back look up behold him who is even now walking in the midst of the churches through all ages behold him who is the same yesterday and forever who never changes either in essence or his ways hallelujah where the twos and trees are gathered together in this name there is in their myths not only in their midst as a complacent onlooker but as a recording angel but there he stands expressing exactly the life and sustainer and giver of all good gifts to the church so he's not in the midst just to say he's in the midst and he's in the midst no he's a mr heel he's a mr seal he's a mess to deliver he's a mess to break the fat and break the bondage off of your life [Music] [Applause] oh glory hallelujah hallelujah it's not him who starts is he who finishes there is no shortcuts we have to come to god's requirement there is no harm in the message you don't have that there are no shortcuts you have to be the manifested word to be the bride come on now you heard us on sunday that's what we are taught the bride is the word manifested not somebody walking with a spoken word book the bride is the word manifested the secret is what the word is in the brain and the word could only come in you as a seed he said the word is invisible until it becomes flesh so when the works became become manifested you know the word has become flesh because now that brings the invisible to become visible god was invisible until what the word was made flesh now this word that we hear in all these years has to become flesh it has to come into your flesh and your faith not only you believe in other words you have to go from profession into a possession you're professing you believe you're professing malachi 4 you're professing all these promises but it has to become a possession where you have it you're not saying thy my land you're walking on your land oh give the lord a shout give the lord a shout now you're not saying god promised me the land you put in your foot every place every place you put your foot that is yours you're walking on that land all these years you're talking about it but you're walking on it you're walking in the spirit you're living in the spirit you're casting out devils you're healing the sick you're raising the dead [Applause] what is it you're coming to your ephesians you're coming into your ephesus coming into your inheritance oh glory to god no more spying over you under and you're spying jordan like a spying glass and you're watching the land over yonder know you're crossing over hallelujah to possess what you know is your own you have to claim what is your own and possess what is your own you can't make claims of your daughter as yours when the lamb took the book you know was his own he said i claim them he took the book who is where they i take the book not for himself but for you okay the lord i shall have a right to give him praises tonight oh hallelujah you have a right to be inspired tonight to be anointed tonight [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this is so mind-boggling this book that nobody could look on not angel nobody could worry to look and see no when that book came down the angel said go and go to the angel and say give me the little book and eat it up nobody can stop them eating that book you have the book on tapes you could eat that book you could go in your prayer cluster and pray in secret and your father will see in secret go reward you openly nobody can stop you only you would hinder you think about it now only you could hinder you god going to bless you in your portion god god bless you god i'm going to bless you tell your cop going to run over your enemies going to see the blessing of god upon you your friends and family going to see the blessings are gone god go identify who you are this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased go give the lord a shout i am not ashamed of the son of man know his words you're not ashamed of the gospel this glorious gospel that is nothing word only but in power and demonstration of the spirit glory glory hallelujah yes but i'm talking about people that are professors without a possession you can't be that you have to come to your possession oh hallelujah [Music] when david came with the battle with ziggler and they take all his wives and take the men wives and living men and wives and the men weeping and crying and they wanted they wanted to jam david they vexed with david and david sought the lord and said shall i pursue you that's all you're asking god you know he says oh son i'm up and crying emotion shall i pursue understand this he asking god shall i go after and bring back my family he wasn't saying oh god he'd never take them oh god but he slip and see they will be shocked he's not that's foolish is he talking there he said shall i push you god tell him pursue and david write all night long and bring back every one of them because you know that was a possession [Applause] where this seven seal book come to reveal your possession okay the lord i shout if they ask if you're worthy oh glory this is not about if you are worthy it is about what the lamb has revealed [Applause] oh glory to god you must be seated when joshua we know just not treating zuru just three things not ten things twenty things just street things cross them over conquer the land and divide the land just treatings not four not ten not twenty just three cross the people over because most of my servant is dead take them over conquer you can't divide what you haven't conquered you can't share out where it's not yours yet and the enemy is sitting on it you have to conquer it first so when he conquers he can divide it why does caleb could step out like that as an individual not as a tribe and say give me my mountain what moses told me because he knew it was his own he said give me my mountain i asked him a brother mountain asking for my mountain do you know your mountain do you know what god has given you do you know what belongs to you you've got to fight for it okay the lord i shout tell somebody next to you fight for you tell somebody [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes i pursued i am going to pursue he said what we see should make a church that will make a revival that people will find from everywhere and see the seven thunders that are not written in revelation is being made manifest not talking first manifest jump high jump low and that's why i'll tell you i'll wait by rabbit hole because right there they come all the mother come right here i know they spin the wrong spelling for years making all kind of fantasy because i'm flipping nothing like that i think whoever it is you are waiting right by the hole because i know everybody had to come right better the word requirement put us to come into a manifestation oh hallelujah hallelujah so don't fight for the sun that say i i will not don't fight too much with that king watch his behavior because he said not say i will not he went and do and the son who said i will say say you know respect respectful all the words in the right places i i will say he didn't do nothing and jesus busting them religious people and telling them pharisees and described look at all you hallelujah all your all your all yours you're going to do it and obey it and you're not obeying it and the prostitutes and the humongous and whoever else they're coming into order and they're going to get in the kingdom before you set the non-self righteous in the message judging all these years finish with that foolishness his supper table will be full he gonna go to the east west go to the highways and byways oh glory to god you go get them in oh go on let me take this bright goggle bring people in and make them bright because no man can make nobody bride this bride is chosen this pride is elected we can fix up you and make you bride oh give the lord a shout now feel good tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and if you are chosen to be bright god and not no not choosing you he's not no choosing you he chose you before the foundation of the world therefore your right to shout tonight you're the right to give god a big praise tonight you're right to give god glory to night because you're chosen he you didn't choose him he chose you and ordain you to bring forth fruit [Applause] glory may be seated hallelujah hallelujah so so you find out sunday prophet said preaching the word is not really the gospel because the word is the seed of the gospel because the gospel to be preached is to be preached with signs and wonders on the power of god so when he said uh he he will be received whom my son received at me that is a season to come because i can read it that is a vindicated servant of god not people just practicing and saying and preaching like what are we doing here now that's when god vindicate and identify your son this is my son hear him when god sent a vindicated seven out that's different you see some just went but god has some he will send he'd have sent and went is that who went is who god sent all glory to god and to send him jesus say how are we going to send them he said as my father sent me come on now so send are you and the father who sent him went in him then jesus could unveil god then the sent one in this last days would be able to take the veil off of god oh glory i'm not talking about just letter word i'm talking about pull the veil off of him you know what i'm waiting on i'm waiting he's a little he is here anything can happen and the prophet was able to unveil that god oh god take every spirit under my control for the glory of god doom devils on the run oh give the lord a shout we are going to come back to that hallelujah you can't be a seed and disagree with the word because the word is a seed and if you are the word how can you disagree with it you'll be disagreeing with yourself you'll be defeating your own purpose so the bride will become the word because the spirit of the monk the bride and that fulfills revelation 2 17 the spirit and the bride say come because the word and the bride the bride becomes the word the spirit knows upon the bride [Music] when that season comes the spirit has dried up from all the earth the bride alone will have the spirit she'll be preaching them and there is no more salvation she'll be preaching to eternal lost people all glory to god you know there will be a space a jubilee space for whosoever will and after that space is over it will be judgment not man's ministry but christ ministry to finish isaiah 61 to declare the day of vengeance of our god christ doing that to our bride we can judge who we could who is a judge with our emotions and our feelings it's christ's ministry do you think peter judge announces the fire it's not peter that was the holy ghost he said you're a lighter man you lied to god you liked the holy ghost the holy ghost called him out peter had no charge of that he can say oh god and he's a good speaker no judgement came it was outside peter purview it was outside peter's control it was god in the midst of the people that is what the devil perverted in the beginning take god from the midst and stick it on a man and you end up with a pope and crush the whole church crush the believers they find himself a bunch of people looking to some man and jesus alone walk in the midst of the seventh golden cancer and a man parading his beef and put some knitting jesus christ and god i hate that i hate the lady being conquered i hate the dominating spirit upon the lead i hate that i'm a god of the audience i'm a god of my people i want to come on my people i want to show them i'm god oh glory to god he promised abraham my people child surgeon in a strange land but i might hear that bring them out isn't that right oh glory to god two million people come out and he told those 12 ministers go and bring evidence not more talk bring back evidence show the people something go and bring back the supernatural bring back something that they know they can't explain or give the lord a shock i i don't know what i know what you're thinking about tonight i'm not talking about bringing a co-channel bringing a word of scripture you know bringing evidence that there's a land beyond the river bringing evidence that he is raised from the dead bringing evidence that he is jesus christ the same yesterday to them forever able to heal you able to deliver you able to free you able to seal you [Applause] able to give you a fresh vision [Music] let's continue now that is why jesus was so perfectly manifested god was so perfectly manifested in jesus because he was the word of god amen he was god's word because the word is the conductor of the spirit you can't conduct illnesses you two would you can't put a plug in here and expect current to go through yours you have a certain conductor the wires what you put and run is what you will flow through well god wire is the word the pentecostal didn't have the wire so when the holy ghost fell on them they speak in tongues and everything else but they couldn't conform to the world that's why they gotta live all kind of crazy life and still have signs and wonders because that was gifts so he brought a prophet to bring the word that we could receive the word so god not promise to use a gift you using the word in you [Applause] so when he anointed peter and all of them in matthew 10 with temporary power to go and preach and cast out devils that was just an experience and a blessing he gave them because they didn't have the real thing yet until they went in the upper room and god gave them permanent power oh glory to god with that temporary power peter was cussing and denying and all them running and the ducking and everything else but with permanent power they was crucified upside down they faced the cross they faced their trials they faced their issues because they had resident permanent artisan willpower oh glory to god he said he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly his inner being shall flow rivers of living water that's not coach brother that is life that's the fountain of life and god wants to make you that that's the reason he couldn't produce nothing but just exactly god and if god is in you what more can you be oh my all of god's son and he said god was manifested in them what was it the spoken word manifested see now all of god's sons must be the same to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like john tree to be born of the water and spirit what does it do it brings you right back here we go into the place where you should have been at the beginning so adam was supposed to reproduce another son of god another pot of house another power man another attribute son of a spirit all glory to god but adam fell in the flesh and we end up in sex right and that's why we were born in sin but he promised to bring us right back to that but you must be born again of the world and the spirit and we couldn't really be effectively born until the full world came and the full spirit came so you send the prophet about the fullness of the word that you could be truly born correctly oh glory to god that word gonna be in you you are gonna become that word then the spirit will activate the word that's in you then that's the kingdom in you we had brought our life oh hallelujah hallelujah all the kingdom in you and you have no power because the kingdom is power the kingdom is life jesus was talking about the kingdom i'm from the kingdom of god is at hand oh behold the kingdom is within you he's talking about another world it's another land it's another realm all together when they say she is dead he said i got weaker oh glory to god you understand what i'm saying in this world they see them dead in this other kingdom he's seated on sleep he's like one week when lazarus was dead he said i'm glad for your sake i am not dear oh glory i am glad for your sake that we are not dear we are there with adam he's on time he's on time he's got to talk lord he's had my dear my brother not die and he's got to give him some promises he said i am the resurrection and i am the life we talking about the dead man on this side but there's no more resurrection on this side here now if that just talks you can't just talk that talk you have to prove that talk i am the resurrection in the life he that believeth in me though he was dead yet shall he live he's still talking he's still talking but you have to prove that talk come on reach back to me somebody i am the resident i talk [Applause] roll away the stone i still talk ok the lorna show but when that man said lazarus come forth that was more than talk brother that was spoken with power oh hallelujah and lazarus had to come all glory to god so you have to go beyond the talk manifested the word hallelujah you can't come out normally you can't walk out you lose them and let them go you're coming up but you're still tied up here like the one saying oh god somebody i don't care how much your family tied up they're coming out you're coming out the spirit and the bride will say come come out come under your condition come under your crippled condition come over to your depression come under your frustration come on your darkness come on get sickness come come oh glory to god he is here he's the same yes it is the day and forever oh glory to god you talk about the super church you talk about the super race you ain't seen nothing yet we are about to get started the superchargers are not building and all them pews and dentures and things that's nothing she's talking about you talking about the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs following do i shout in the house that's the church we're talking about send mark 16 in action i will wrestle i see it and when you stop till i see it it's going to materialize oh god hallelujah glory to god william branham prophesy all glory that there will be a church with jesus walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp do we have a show tonight he promised a shout of the king [Music] maybe he said not the mourning of the believers that is what he had when he took ten spies come back and them things like come up with a negative report we can't take it because giants so big and this and what kind of negative oh god what kind of stories and oh my look at caleb and joshua come back he left short stamp on a box and said we are well able to take it let's go up let's kill that was bowling he said let's go up at once it was so bad he said no no no no no no no no no and somebody said look at all the shorty on top there all them saying land oh shorty talking about let's go up at once now they're making maka shorty but shorty knew what he was talking about because shorty see all them daddy died in the wilderness for 40 years and shorty still went and take them three sons of enoch probably say you expel the sons of enoch because i'm just as strong and when i first started out i am dead i have dead i had dying i just as stronger when i first started out my god god put me here to stand god put me here to overcome god put me at the fight and i will fight i will stand i will overcome oh glory to god sons of enoch i'm coming to get you get off my mountain [Applause] oh go ahead and play with my land i'll move i'll dynamite not my land don't mess with my land don't fool with my land don't even step your foot on my land that is my land god give me that land oh give the lord a shout you say every place you put your foot is yours put your foot somewhere tonight put your foot on miracles put your foot in size put your foot on power put your foot on deliverance put your foot on deliveries for your family put your [Applause] let me see if i can wrap up [Music] hallelujah that's the reason of christ's debt is to bring us right back to sons of god now this brings you right back to the spoken word where we are god's word made manifest you see jesus said the same thing he that believeth on me who i am i come for and the purpose i do to bring a man back to believe the word of god and take nothing else with it the works that i do he will do also a man i take the book just as is see we notice the spoken word when we are gods then we are god's word made manifest that listen that is how god wants his church is to manifest himself this is god's will this is god's desire hallelujah now watch how can he manifest himself unless his own seed is in that person how can you use your own thoughts and god manifests himself through you how can you take your own belief and say well my pastor teaches my creed says and so on and whatnot he said then jesus the death of jesus was nothing to you the works that jesus did if a man has the seed of god in him and the spirit of god listen watering that seed so he's bringing the spirit as the water to the seed so if we only have seed alone that can work you need to get the water to the seed and the water is what promised yes [Music] watch watch if a man has a seed of gone in him with the spirit of god watering that seed the same works that jesus was manifested in jesus him being the original seed of god his death brings you back to the original seed of god and if that same spirit that was within him is in you then the same works will be manifested so you explain how this gonna be he said the reason we have so much uh oh he said crash is because uh who is it scrap people ministers is because they're trying to do the works of christ without the life of christ so god connects paul with character because the pentecostal failed being gifted and to this day they are still gifted some of the gifts of the israeli men some have gift of healing they still have the gifts some of the 30 000 church 20 000 to 10 000 big churches and they still gifted but he's not talking about that they still they give some penalty costs of god take it from them they still have it what he's talking about here is the character and character is not a gift [Music] gift of wisdom and all kind of gifts give up preaching all that but this is not what we're talking about this is not a gift this is character character is not given to you is baited through your childs and testing your place of trying is what guarantees you to have character [Applause] whether you say amen or not to steal the truth to them so people want to live in church that they give them character they want to put their body on the head that not given a character they know all the word all the bible all the greek all the hebrew that's still not giving a character is when they get out of church and you'll face your trials and your face intestines and you have issues in your family and issues in the home that is what's going to give you a character you ain't getting characters sitting inside of here you're getting word to go out there to face the devil and if you can't say amen to this this night something wrong with you you're a church member take that cap and wear it hallelujah if you want character you have to understand you're getting equipped because in boots you get insured you're getting equipment tonight you're getting badge and everything else to go out and fight [Applause] so don't let the devil give you fight inside the building you have too much problems outside take a fight inside the church here don't go get fight with me just fight up with the world take the word and die take the word and press take the word the word is preached and every man every man press their way into it oh glory to god hallelujah what a gideon let's see if you can wrap up here you say if you want a church start with the word of god you want the life of god start with the word of god accept the word of god in its fullness every measure of it and if that is the fullness of god in you then the rain has fallen will produce exactly what's in your garden the real seed of god is absorbent for the spirit all denominationalism is sticking out unbelief take out then the holy spirit comes into the dream of life that's laying there it produces another seed another son of god is born i am a branham because i was born of charlie and ilabrana that makes me a branner because i am their seed their two agreements their sperm together made a seed that made me when god and his word becomes one when god's spirit waters the seed of god the word of god it produces god it is not the individual it is god for you are dead you are not yourself no more you reckon yourself dead hollowed out waiting for the sigil [Applause] i know some of the ministers fighting me on this minister jesus christ tell them they don't have to mention jesus christ nobody i don't have mysteries guys yet it's promised because the fifo ministry is not men the fifo ministry is the ministry of jesus christ in the form of a pastor form of a prophet form of evangelist form of a teacher form of apostle in other words it is christ's ministry in these men it is the full sea germ in them because that is what peter had and when he was speaking to cornelius house when he speak the word he said why did he expect these words the holy ghost fell upon them that heard the word because he had the full germ in him all seven virtues was in him oh glory to god hallelujah and he said this thing had to be tested and proven to be in the man you can't preach it i have to live it [Applause] and to prove it you have to test it [Applause] you seen a piece of wood there and you think it's solid wood sometimes you put your hand hold your hole your whole thing goes through you know it's still nice it's all inside there it's looking nice outside and you put your finger would like some take out his head already so to know you have patience or temperance oh gosh how google does that hold on go test patient making it quick you have to wait and when you're waiting you're still waiting anytime you start you'll find you're waiting too long you know something all right because faith could work with patience for the promise to be confirmed and patience must have its perfect work and it's a perfectionist patience waiting on god and waiting for god so god is making weight and in not waiting this happening and that happened and that's happening and that temptation and that trials and that tension but you're waiting in faith what if god told abraham this is that coming 25 years from now he said thank you hello yeah the imam booze for 24 years and come back shaky head and she called the drink and instead of smoking he put some mints inside his mouth i'm smoking a back in church because you know this year is the year this is the year of jubilee this is 25 years i'm seeing god couldn't do it he dropped her promise at him and let him wait how long 25 years he dropped a promising disciple and said wait until the promise of the father how long 14 days he said until he didn't tell him when he's coming in about josh but the bible said when the day of pentecost was fully come so there's a day for you it's coming it's god in the man it's the sea germ like the beginning the spoken word is god's word made manifest then it isn't the man it's the man that died he can't be a hybrid in her son at the same time he's either a son of death or son of life so if he's a son of that get over to the devil and kill it give it over to god i meant that let him kill the devil that's in you run him out hollows you let god plant his own life in you then it's not you no more it is god oh my so the holy spirit comes in the form of a dove he come not you i breathe in but you are virgin born and then through this i'm giving this life that if you by faith will accept will accept the father all the prophets all the word i will pour my life down upon you and you can't do nothing else but produce the same life the same thing that i do what was he made he made himself a man god has made flesh and dwelt among us the world has made flesh dwelt among us god's spoken word true aversion brought forth a body and in that body come water and spirit the wash by the water of the word and then he went in him and dwelt in him and there comes the life of god manifesting himself through christ he was the anointed one and then we see he was god's would be manifest now he died here we go in order to pay the debt of your hybridian that's why he died because we're a hybrid so you have to pay the debt to correct that all right so what's something now my what is it that you could die to yourself until you are no more yourself but be filled with this word believe in his word and then the holy spirit was in him comes down to water that word to make it grow and when and then what is it god manifesting continuing the work of his full son his only begotten that died for our hybrid in life that he might reconcile us back to be sons and daughters of god and through the church my flow here we go the same life by the word continuing the work being manifested as it was in christ christ was god word made manifest and he died and gave his life that he might send the spirit and take his body up and send the spirit back to water and pay the redeeming price if we believe it and it's right then come the holy spirit upon the same word oh glory to god then the bible has got to be in you prophecy the bible has got to be in you so you can't take the book and stick it in through that go for surgery and put it back inside you that's the only bible inside of you is the word that'll go inside of you so this pyramid is the bible so when this word go in you you have the bible in you you have the pyramid in you it's not right then the word is a seed as long as it's lean here it won't do no good but when it comes in here it comes in the heart then it begins to manifest by the holy spirit the works of god are you ready then visions come power comes humility come all you know it all is gone you become nothing christ become alive you die he lives there it is because he die i live when i die he lives again o praise the name of the lord do you believe that believe us the word and spirit are absolutely one you don't use your own thinking you don't use your own mind he said the mind that was in christ is in you you are god's living word representative of him here on earth continuing the work oh my the church should be that way so the bible is manifested again like in the early days of the disciples just like disciples the bible is living again in you so the bible is manifested again like the earliest of christ because you are a predestinated seed just like christ was just like christ was you are a predestinated seed do you believe that are you ready for this big bomb here now and when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the holy spirit falls oh glory to god hallelujah you shall receive power when after the holy ghost has come upon you that holy ghost is not pentecostal holy ghost it's not looter holy ghost it's not where the holy ghost is the holy ghost itself seven spirits hallelujah what the prophet released that holy ghost oh glory to god there was a vision of rain there was a vision of the seed crying of center screen send us rain and then the rain began to fall tears pop up everybody everybody rained los angeles waiting to sink because rain had to hit that seed and manifest that sinking everything had to hit the rain you know the rain you know he said the devil waiting on what the rain the fall has dynamics the united nations to enforce laws to close only churches already there you know is that the dynamics are waiting for you know and the law already in us you know after 50 something years we just written the dynamics and if we have that in us it will manifest itself if we have that perimeter in you it will manifest itself oh glory to god all the messages was the pack that's inside of you oh my limited so then i'll close with this good place he's talking about disciples listen to the experience he said and when it fell on those seeds that he chose them when before the foundation of the world they were predestined to see that's right and they hauled themselves up in the upper room these seeds the wood and the word was laying on dear without life in it all of a sudden there came a song from heaven as the waters began to gush down it actually filled all the house where they were setting and the seats begin to grow it began to manifest itself the wooden manifest they were the word they were the seeds of god without life they went in the upper room afraid they closed the door they shut the door they can't handle the jews the do the people outside they close the door and they wait in the promise of the father if those people have banged them with those all they might just scat and run out but they shut the doors and they're waiting worshiping praising god count every service the praise in god continually 40 days before that they depress they don't go because jesus is gone he's dead they're sad he's not gone from them and they're not sad they return to jerusalem with great joy the joy of revelation of what's coming to them it brought joy not sorrow they're going to get licks but the licks wasn't what they counted about it's going to be beaten and run out that was what they're considering it was considered the joy of what was promised with stamina lips and other tongues i'll speak to these people joel said i put my spirit upon all flesh your might shall see vision all men shall dream dreams and that's what that joy the joy and we have a joy the joy of the manifestation this glorious liberty of the sons of god that's our joy not the press not the common clues is done not deprived hundred percent of the group all that is correct but we have a joy that will be manifested sons we have the joy that will be a super race a super church as we near the headstone that's our joy and that joy god gave you no man can take that from you that's the joy of the lord of our expectation what we're looking for but ram looked for it he said oh god i wish i could see it oh to see a sun going down and say silvan go have i none such an hour i give unto you think about it they up husband your crypt of wife your
