so greetings from the church and the Believers in Germany from mother stephanus K and Rena and the Believers over there and I believe one of those messages was played here for the church amen and I trust it was a blessing uh to the church so the Believers in Germany on fire they are under expectation they're looking for God to move in a mighty way and I could testify that all over the world the spirit of God is moving can the church say Amen so and two Sundays ago I was in Nigeria and the Saints in in Nigeria on fire and they are looking for Redemption to draw nigh they under expectation for the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost to fall upon this end time bride they are under expectation and I bring greetings from Lagos as well as from Port harkort from Brother the U and the Believers in the Lagos Church the many ministers who were there and uh I was able to be present for the homegoing service of Pastor Elijah academi who has been to every convention ition we have had and he went on to be with the Lord and I was there to be for present for the service and the burial I was able to give some words uh at the funeral service as well as go over to Port harkort where uh he was based where the burial was and two Sundays ago I was in fellowship with uh the fful ministry of River State so many of the churches in the State uh River State where Port hak is a part of a present and uh we are grateful for God for the Saints and to for the Believers and they send their love their greetings their appreciation to the church and last week Sunday I was in France by Brother Jano so we had a wonderful time in the Lord we preached twice there uh in France as well so it's been quite a journey and we know that God is doing something tremendous and it's certainly good to be back home there's no place like home you know when I was sharing with my wife that many times you travel on the field and uh one thing and I've seen it with brother ID as well and maybe it's it just uh maybe it's what what we have been trained with but many times the messages that we preach on the fields and in conventions actually start right here that's you know the message I preached in Lagos some time ago about jeffa it was preached here when I preached about the continuation of the generation of Jesus Christ it was preached here then I preached in Ghana uh time no longer time is running out preach here then spoke about brother Norris church and I took it to Nai church and you know so many of the of the of the services and the prayers it's your prayers and your encouragement because we can only do so much as the gift of God is operated by the prayers and the pull of the people so we thank you for your commitment for your dedication for your labor for your love for being present for understanding your post of Duty to knowing that you were born for such a time as this to know that time is short and before we realize it will be out of here this world is finished and we are under expectation for God to move beyond our reasoning beyond our imagination you know and last weekend in France uh I was able to witness a baptism and uh it's quite something uh sister came for baptism and uh it's one of the first times I've seen so many friends uh I guess who uh from the world come to witness the baptism you know and you know it's one thing to be here from the Caribbean and but it's another thing to see this in Europe and many of those who came drove 5 hours to come to a baptism that speaks of something it speaks of it doesn't matter what the enemy does it doesn't matter how much technology it has it doesn't matter what the God is still calling sons and daughters and it was moving to see that they came uh I spoke Saturday night and Sunday morning but their intent and the intention was to be there just for the Saturday night service and go back home you know for the drive you know so I asked but Jano will will they be in the Sunday morning service he said no they plan to go back home but the Lord having his way the way the Lord moved on Saturday night Sunday morning we got there and they were all there still in the service am as like what happened they say well the way the service went last night they couldn't afford to go back home and we are looking to see God move calling individuals because it's an individual Affair God doesn't move by groups he moved by individuals and it doesn't matter if you're in Germany if you're in France if you're in Nigeria if you're in Trinidad you're in America Australia or you take a rocket and go to another planet once your name is on the book God is going to call you home can the Church Say Amen so everybody feeling fine so if you have your Bibles let's stand to our feet let's read two portions of scripture I really want to appreciate uh the Bible uh sorry the prayer meeting the exhortation on Friday night and the service last Wednesday if you did not hear that service last Wednesday I tell you that was a Thunder From Heaven so I want to salute brother ID I want to salute all the services brother Anthony what a tremendous what a tremendous time Amen to see how God is moving and connecting because it's one body it's one Lord It's one faith and it's one baptism so we're looking for God to speak to us this morning from his word so reading two portions of scripture we're going to read from Revelation 5 and we're going to read Matthew chapter 6 and we know that today is Sunday uh it is the Lord's day so we are here in the house of God to spend our time in the presence of the Lord so forget about your bills forget about about tomorrow forget about everything else and I want to encourage you to pay full attention on what God wants to say here this morning so reading from Revelation 5 and reading from verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold a lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Hops and gold and vs full of odors which are the prayers prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying now arew worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and H has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and reading Matthew 6 reading from verse 9 a very familiar scripture and uh we're going to spend some time here relooking at this by the grace of God Matthew 6 verse 9 after this manner there therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word can we bow our heads for a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father any man could read the scriptures but it takes the Holy Spirit to breathe life upon it Lord for the few moments we have together on this Sunday Lord we come as a needy people looking for a fresh touch Lord looking for a word in due season the right word one day Lord your Prophet said the right words will be spoken and we'll Dash into the presence of God Lord may this be that kind of a day May something that be said Lord May something be said that Lord that will touch the hearts of the people in such a way Lord that if there's a backslider in our midst this morning they'll be restored completely if there's anyone sick in our midst they'll be healed completely if there's anyone Lord down or uncertain or father going through some struggle Lord that the word of God would bring peace and Clarity and comfort Lord Lord if there's anyone Desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost there'll be filled father Lord may you pour out your Holy Spirit upon your people and may you confirm the word with signs with wonders with Miracles Lord and may you Lord speak to us as you've never had before take me out of the way hide me behind calvary's cross father Lord I don't want my thought I don't want my idea is but father Lord you send us a prophet with a message Lord and the opening of the seals has turned the Bible into a new book so may you walk out of the pages of this book father Lord father through the lens of the revealed word so we can take comfort and safety to know how we're going to leave this place father Lord may you Lord take complete control in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you may be seated I'm under expectation for what God is going to do I want to take my time because I want to do a bit of a teaching some little preaching some little encouragement but by the grace of God at the end of the service I want you to be able to relook at the Lord's Prayer maybe in a way you never thought about it you know many things uh we look at in scripture uh and in the word become common to us you know and and until when Jesus came he said I I don't like all the Traditions you have turned everything into just a tradition and a and a ritual but there's substance in the word and there's things in there that God left and if you don't spend time to to look at it and investigate it and study it and pick it up then then you'll not see the magnitude of it so can the church say Amen so I have a title this morning morning The Lord's Prayer connects the altar to the throne The Lord's Prayer connects the altar to the throne so for us to even start this study if I could use that word this morning we need to go back to the very beginning and in the very beginning when God created the Sun the moon the stars the Earth man everything was in place we could clearly see that God's will was perfectly established on the earth God has a will he has a desire he has a purpose he has an objective he has something that he wants to see and when God had finished he could say it was good can we agree on this this morning when God looked at the work of the first day and the second day and the third day and the fourth day every single day God said it was good the very thought of God the very picture of God what God had in his mind had been perfectly expressed and God God could rest can the church say Amen the perfect will of God was established on the earth and there was no separation between Heaven and Earth that's right can the church say amen and I'm beginning to hint at certain things because in the Lord's Prayer it says your will on Heaven and Earth can the church say Amen so at the very beginning before man fell God's will was the same on Heaven and Earth because man was in perfect harmony with God hallelujah man didn't have his own will he didn't have his own idea about things he didn't have his own Ambitions about things he was in perfect harmony with God can the church say amen hallelujah God and man had full communion full fellowship and I want to add something there was no need for prayer Hallelujah in the Garden of Eden there was nothing like a prayer meeting brother Lyndon there was no need to prayer because it was perfect Fellowship there was perfect harmony there was never Adam did not pray before the fall oh somebody preach back to me maybe you never heard that before but there was no need for Adam to pray because he was in perfect fellowship with God God could come down in the cool of the evening and just have a conversation with his son because his son was in perfect alignment with his will with his purpose with his plan with his vision with his objective can the church say amen and our whole objective from the fall of Man is to get back to Eden can the church say Amen so prayer has to be a means to get us back because prayer wasn't there but God had to oh I don't want to get ahead of myself this morning can the church say Amen but after the fall communion was lost Fellowship was lost Adam went into hiding can the church say amen and prayer became necessary as a way for man to reach God can the church say Amen somebody help me preach this morning the Bible tells us the first time you could find prayer is in Genesis 4 when the Bible says then began men to call upon the name of the Lord so in Genesis 1 Genesis 2 Genesis 3 you can't find one reference to prayer but at the end the last verse of Genesis 4 it says then men began to call upon the name of the Lord because they recognized they couldn't do it on their own and they needed something more they needed to reach Beyond themselves somebody help me this morning anybody with me in the house [Music] brother Brandon would pick this up and in Revelation chapter 4 we have said this before but the brandham said the only way back to Eden is by the altar here you go again see Back to Eden through the altar so the altar is the way back to Eden amen but we preach about the war of altars the war of priests the war of sacrifices some months ago when you have an altar altar is one part of the puzzle you have to bring your sacrifice to the altar the altar is a means to pray at the altar so when you come standing praying at the altar without if you have the altar without prayer there just an [Music] altar can the Church Say Amen H I'm building this it's a little encouragement so we could now relook at the Lord's Prayer so man because he is Fallen man because he is broken man because he has needs throughout all of the Bible we could find instances of prayer we see Hannah in the temple praying because she wants a child and God answers her prayer hallelujah hallelujah you could go example after the example he said If my people will humble themselves and pray seek my face turn from their Wicked Ways they will hear from heaven and I will heal their land prayer was a means for God to be activated he said I've heard the cries of my people and I've come down I can't move until you call me I can't respond until you call me when you start to pray you begin to move heaven Hallelujah you begin to activate thej Hallelujah the celestial realm to bring the celestial realm down to the terrestrial realm you begin to bring God to Earth because man has dominion over the Earth and he needs to be invited he said I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open it that voice is a voice of prayer anybody with me this [Music] morning Hall many scriptures Abraham prayed his conversation God was a pray say Lord if there be 50 Moses prayed David prayed you could find it all through scripture and these men prayed with a partial realization a partial understanding can the church say Amen but when Jesus came because at the highest level of Prayer in the Old Testament it was the high priest brother George who had to go and intercede for the people but when Jesus came the King was on the earth the king who was prophet the prophet who was Priest the priest who was sacrifice the sacrifice standing there and the disciples in Luke said teach us teach us how to pray it had to have been something about the way he prayed that attracted their attention can the church say amen and he gave them a structure of a prayer that every single believer should know but what does it really mean because the real issue is Brother George anybody in Christendom who claims to be Christian could look at the Lord's Prayer but what does it mean to us as Believers now that the seals have been opened because the seals being open means the Bible is a new book means we could read that prayer with the lens or the eyes of the fullness of the revealed word because if the question was asked ask Lord teach us how to pray and Jesus begins to give them a way to pray that would withstand time that's right would withstand ages would withstand situations I want to encourage you this morning that in that Lord's Prayer God dealt with all the church ages in the Lord's Prayer he dealt with the Seven Seals in the Lord's Prayer is the seven thunders in the Lord's Prayer is your inheritance in the Lord's Prayer is your deliver Deliverance in the Lord's Prayer is your [Applause] Revival The Lord's Prayer is more than just words in the Lord's Prayer he actually expresses the whole plan the whole Plan of Redemption for the bride is in the Lord's Prayer you remember when Peter was there and the Lord told Peter Peter I've prayed for you that your faith don't fail the Lord give us some ammunition because there's a certain prayer and within his prayer there's a mystery of this Lord's prayer that is most relevant to us today can the church say Amen not everybody could pray this Lord's Prayer you know this is not the Our Father prayer no it's more than that it's a weapon there's power in this prayer there's a secret in this prayer there's a mystery in this prayer are you ready let's go The Lord's Prayer a Divine blueprint and the Lord Prayer has a certain number of statements being made are you ready let's go but a punch shine and preach ahead of me Glory Glory Glory Glory so the Lord's Prayer starts with Our Father which art in heaven now when you look at this statement this was a very interesting statement because this is the only time where Jesus actually says our father he would many times say I am my father one my father this is the only time he brought a level of inclusion into this concept of fatherhood because it means for you to say our father you are part of this family of God of which he is the air and we become joint a So within this just simple Declaration of our father there's an acknowledgement of a mystery of adoption because it's only by the spirit of adoption we could properly cry AB father so outside of Hey Brother Clarence good to see you Hallelujah So within the Our Father you can't especially now in this age where the George when you say our father it is with now the revelation of adoption not just God is my father no but by the spirit you could the spir What Spirit the spirit of adoption you could truly cry AB father so the Our father now means access to God as your father because you are now part of the body it means the Our Father part of the prayer speaks the Divine privilege Divine access yes so outside of the body you can't even pray our father because it's only by the spirit Hallelujah go you have to be led by the spirit but say as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of God so if you're not spirit-led you can't even start to pray just pray oh you don't hear me this morning hallelujah hallelujah so when Jesus said our father he was speaking about the restoration of sunship Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah this was not a light Our Father brother George he was talking about your check your signature being good as a father's check this is not the Pentecostal age this is not irenia age this is the briide age the same Lord's Prayer worked in the first age it was prayed in the second age it was prayed in the third age it was a prayer for all ages but now in our day what does it mean in our day now in our day Sons daughters could pray our father with a revelation of being in your rightful position as a Son of God hallelujah because this is listen if somebody random who you don't know come and call you father you in respond somebody is walking and say daddy you say who are you there's no relationship but this very prayer starts in our father a level of Fellowship a level of communication with a direct pathway of sunship inheritance adoption Romans 8 for you have not received a spirit of bondage against the fear but you have received a spirit of adoption whereby we can cry AB father Hallelujah brother Bram taught us adoption mean placement so we're talking about this prayer there comes a point where the Jo where this prayer is about plac sonen having a certain kind of communication with God can the church say Amen everybody with me this morning this is the same Lord's Prayer right let's go we building so going to look at just two snapshots they're going to go through the prayer then we're going to look and see how does the seals connect to the prayer everybody with me you know we are not creatures of time because from eternity and the seeds unlock the mystery John wept because there was no found no one worthy to to lose the seals but the breaking of the seals gives us direct access to Redemption the full Plan of Redemption can the church say amen and brother B I'm taught that the Seven Seals is the mystery of God being unveiled to God's children can the church say amen he that overcometh in Revelation shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son Hallelujah Glory it goes beyond this Our Father which Art in Heaven speaking about the sovereignty of God glory acknowledging the separation acknowledging the fact that God is Not on our leveling that he's above all our problems that the situations on this Earthly existence this is small to God because he is God in heaven Hallelujah and this will make more sense when we get to the seals but Our Father Who Art in Heaven he is bigger than your problem he's bigger than the Earthly situ ation he's bigger than Earthly kingdoms he's bigger than your bills Our Father which art in Heaven this was a prayer but the prayer was also a blueprint but it also teaches us that before you ask God for anything you have to acknowledge who he is this prayer has seven Parts but the first part just acknowledges Our Father Who Art in Heaven Hallelujah he's not a God of this Earth he's a god of the heaven he is higher than the earth he is higher than your problem he is higher than your situation he is higher than your sickness he is higher than your mind battle he is higher than your depression then it goes on and only true Sons could really pray this prayer Hallowed be thy name Worthy is

name you'll speak with new tongues in my name you'll lay hands on the sick and they'll recover there's power in the name and the Bride of Jesus Christ she'll beuse miss is Jesus Christ because he will have his name oh can the church say Amen but do you recognize that there's power in his name do you recognize that his name is Holy At The Mention Of His Name that John was dead in Elizabeth's womb but At The Mention of the name that John came alive there's power in that name Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed Be thine name Hallelujah glory to your name your name is mighty your name is

they say God we messed up but your name because of your name don't let the enemy talk about your name for your name's sake fight the battle for us Hallowed be thy name it is because of his name you're going to be healed because of his name your family has got to be delivered because he promised to deliver them in his name your sin cannot stop his name your mistake cannot stop his [Applause] nameall

shackle to break anything that's holding you back today oh Hallelujah the seven compound Redemptive names of Jehovah wrapped up in the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallowed be thy name it is worship but is also more than worship it's a declaration that every knee will bow every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord Hal power in that name there's still power in that name when you plead that name over your house something begins to happen plead the blood plead that name over your home plead that name over your family plead that name over your children plead that name over your situation by his stripes you are healed by his stripes you are healed in the name of Jesus every demon has got to flee in the name of Jesus hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah neither is there salvation in the book of Acts and any other for there's none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved glory to God oh Hallelujah in the message God's chosen place of worship but the BAM said there's fine people in the world fine churches but there's one Mrs Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's who he's coming for that's where his name lays this is where his worship is in her and her alone that is true we find that to be true Hallelujah there's not another name given under heaven for salvation with the name of Jesus Christ there's not another name Hallelujah all the family in heaven is nam Jesus and all the family on Earth is named Jesus so that's God's chosen name where he has put it that his place of worship is in Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah his names of redemption God has a name called Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Rafa Jehovah Gyra the Lord forgives all th sins Jehovah he has many title but he's got one name of redemption that belongs to the human race and that is the name of Jesus and that name will be your identification everybody with me just encourag you this morning then the prayer goes on thy kingdom come and here Jesus is connecting all the way back to when Daniel saw that image talk about the stone that was cut out without the hands of man that stone that strike the image of the Beast and destroyed every single Kingdom this is I want you to understand this is a prayer that Jesus is saying we ought to be praying this way so you ought to be praying with a consciousness of the relationship you have with God and the relationship you should have with God the fullness of that relationship through the mystery of sunship and adoption Hallelujah the fact that God is Sovereign and he he is bigger he is more powerful he's not here on Earth limited to our limited beliefs but his thoughts are higher than our thoughts his ways are higher on our ways as he Heavens are hide on the earth he is in heaven Hallowed be his name Hallelujah and then his kingdom before you ask God for blessing before you ask God for healing before you ask God for anything you want to see his kingdom thy kingdom come Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus said the kingdom of God the Kingdom of Heaven the kingdom and he when he came he was preaching the kingdom the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand the whole Bible is about the restoration of this Kingdom that's right and the kingship represents the Dominion that man lost that Adam lost and we read that scripture because when the breaking of the seals that that verse 10 it says and we shall reign on the earth God has made us both Kings and Priests restoring both the priesthood and our access to the Altar and restoring our kingship which is our rulership and Dominion which is Back to Eden can the church say Amen thy kingdom come a spiritual Kingdom an Earthly Kingdom and eternal Kingdom can the church say Amen everybody with me could we take some more amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when we get to the seals we talk a little bit about how Satan tried to build his kingdom and how this Lord structure of it God gave us the weapons throughout every age to deal with it because prayer is your deliverance when you're in trouble what you supposed to do pray and if you pray a certain way with the revelation of what you're praying for that's how you overcome Jesus overcame by prayer everybody with me this morning so you're saying brother Isa I'm praying for my family I'm praying but are you praying with a revelation of sunship of where God is with a revelation of his name with a revelation that his kingdom coming also means certain privileges to those who are part of this Kingdom die Kingdom Come means those who are part of the Kingdom could access Kingdom benefits could access Kingdom Authority could access Kingdom power and that when this kingdom is fully realized Satan has no place because the sons of God will be in their position no wonder the whole creation is grown in for the manifestation of the sons of God which is the same as Sons coming into position in the Kingdom can the church say amen hallelujah fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and the Bible says in Revelation 11 the kingdom of this world I become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever so Satan know his time is short you know Hallelujah we are the Kings and Priests this Earth belongs to us brother Hui are going to take back what belongs to us the devil is squatting but the real kings are on the earth now we are here take a look at yourself you're looking at royalty K are on the earth now they are being identified now the revealing of the word the opening of the seals the revealing of every mystery identifies kingship on Earth now you may not feel like it but you are king you are a priest you are royal priesthood you were born with the power born with authority now are we the sons of God it do not appear what we shall be but when we see him we shall be like [Applause] him Hallelujah you may be seated everybody feeling fine anybody sleeping everybody with me this [Applause] morning but the Clarance for God to be king of kings there has to be [Applause] Kings you heard me for him to be king of kings there has to be some Kings so he could be king of kings we are Kings and he is the king of kings oh come on die Kingdom Come listen and church the nearer the kingdom becomes the more powerful we become when the heads all come on and I'm here declaring this morning the kingdom is at hand it's closer they look for it in the first age they look for it in the second age do you realize every Church age had this prayer every Church age prayed for the kingdom to come yeah they had this same blueprint and every every member of the Bride of every age could pray the same prayer they say Lord thy kingdom come Lord we need your kingdom but it was not for the first age it was not for the second age it was not for the third age but now final age final Voice final people thy kingdom come [Applause] Hallelujah we are not just talking about sunship Hallelujah the same way brother punch Jesus could be Prophet priest king sacrifice lawyer and judge it's the same way the bride could be son King priest intercessor Advocate oh come on now you don't hear me this morning you're looking at yourself small come on Gideon you mighty man of Valor do you know who you are do you know what you're called to do do you that there's more power in you than everything the enemy has there's more power in you now greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world that's why your female condition has got to go that's why cancer has got to go that's why high blood pressure has got to go that's why every disease has got to go because the kingdom is coming into Power the kingdom is coming into view thy kingdom come [Music] the kingdom coming is the authority that Adam lost coming back into Power full restoration of Eden everybody feeling fine Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah could you take some more we still in the prayer and it's a prayer you know many of us when we hear prayers like you want to ask God for something but here Jesus is saying you want to know how to pray and God has given a secret in this prayer a mystery in this prayer a key in this prayer he giv them a road map he giv them a way of Escape he's given them power in the prayer now it's one thing because but B said the moment the bride gets to know who she is then the Raptor could go a virgin shall conceive set a scripture until Mary came Malachi 4 five and six sat a scripture until brother brandham came so this full mystery of redemption unlocked by the revealing of the Seven Seals has sat a scripture now revealed it's been here because Rapture in faith is laying in the message the key to out of here is lay in the message but preach all of this thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven now this scripture is powerful because this scripture is not about your will or my will this is about the administration of will so in Gethsemane in get Gethsemane Jesus says Lord not my will but thy will be done but this scripture is a little different this is saying thy will be done on Earth as it is done in heaven in other words when God has a will in heaven it is carried out a certain way or you don't hear me there's nothing to challenge his will in heaven the administration of his will whatever existed to challenge his will was kicked out when Lucifer was kicked out and we were there doing the kicking [Applause] out hallu so this prayer before you even ask for anything is Lord die will be done on Earth with the same ease with which it is done in heaven where there's nothing to stop it you don't hear me this morning thy will be done on Earth the same way when God say move in heaven brother Lon nobody stop they move Hallelujah and there's coming a time when God's will on Earth will be just like his will in heaven where there'll be no nothing to stop his will from being fulfilled and if God's will is to see you come to Perfection there's nothing to stop that will from being expressed there's been no demon no sickness no power no doubt no fear no unbelief his will will have a perfect will a perfect way you may be seated God's will is always done in heaven the problem is not in heaven the problem is here on Earth because man have dominion over the Earth and it takes a man totally surrendered to God for God's will to be able to operate but there's some resistance on Earth that's hindering the will so in that prayer before you ask for anything is thy will be done because if you could ever get to the spot where the way your will is managed and administered and expressed so when those boys were in the fiery furnace worm would say send me I'll go but God's will say woman no you don't go woman say Fe and led to go down the Lord himself became the Forman in the fire his will perfectly [Music] expressed we are waiting to see the will of God fully expressed on the earth the same way is expressed in Heaven Can the church say Amen this battle of will where on the earth now Jesus has to pray not not my will but thine be done and this battle that we face on this Earth of this two Wills your will your desire your goal your dream your ambition and God has a will for your life he has a purpose for your life he has a plan for your life he has blessings for your life and we end up actually hindering the plan of God for our lives because our will gets in the way of God's will right that's right can the church say Amen Glory Hallelujah now after this picture where the Clarance is p is painted Our Father adoption sunship Who Art in Heaven his TOS hide on our thoughts the celestial realm above the terrestrial realm Hallowed be thy name the name of God the name above every other name there's no other name thy kingdom come prophetic speaking of the coming Kingdom that has been spoken about that brings us all the way back to Eden thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven now we finish this first part of the prayer that has nothing to do with you all of that prayer thus far has all to do with God our Father in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven no man in that prayer them some of we approach God and say Lord is me again Lord I look in you know you know my need and you approach god without acknowledging if you even have a relationship without acknowledging the sovereignty of who he is and the Majesty of his power without reverencing his name without speaking the way he said of his coming Kingdom without acknowledging the fact that his will has to be here on Earth as it is in heaven the way it was in Eden because we said at the beginning God's will was perfectly expressed before the fall anybody with me this morning now after this he could say give us this day our daily bread speaks of the provision of God every single day so every day you supposed to be asking God where is my bread for today because he's the one who's supposed to give you your daily bread and the prayers give us this day our daily bread on a daily basis you acknowledging the fact that there's no bread outside you don't want bread outside of God's bread so when you get up in the morning and you working because you working and and it's your effort and that's is not God's bread you going to work because you want to go to work for God to determine how what bread you supposed to get so this is in the natural as much as it is in the spiritual amen are you looking to your own strength for your daily bread or are you ready trusting in God to give you every day your daily bread because he said I've never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread this is not you breing bread this is God saying he has promised to provide your needs but you have to ask him on a daily basis give us this day I want my bread for Sunday Lord whatever is for me today in the natural in the spiritual I want it today this day I'm talking about this day we will deal with tomorrow tomorrow but this day there's a daily bread there's spiritual food in due season take no thought of Tomorrow there's bread for tomorrow tomorrow and the bread of yesterday is not good for today I want the daily bread for today fresh Manor fresh bread spiritual food brother georan due season I don't want yesterday food I don't want Luther's message I don't the Pentecostal message I want this day the bread for this day Luther had bread for his day the Pentecostal had bread for their day what about our day give us this day our daily [Applause] [Music] bread hallu and this is why the preaching of the word is so important because it's presentent food rightly dividing the word of Truth as Daily Bread I'm a this morning you know just bringing Daily Bread God have a bread for you every day every service you come fresh baked this message Bak this morning the minister could come to the pulpit but by the time the minister and Angel steps here it's fresh fresh food just what you need to eat oh come on now so when you come to church you looking for fresh food and you know when you're getting fresh food you know when you buy something and it's not fresh but you also know when you eat something good and see this thing fresh boy this thing this thing just come of the oven this thing tasting good this thing eating good Hallelujah listen you may be seated in the old days I just say in the old days because them young people don't they baking bread now kiss getting all the money but in the old days when you bake fresh bread you don't need much to eat with fresh bread you know just butter is good because the bread is so fresh when it hot out the oven good Lord help me this morning you you don't eat sausage and cheese and egg and because it's fresh bread there's something about fresh bread oh God there's something when it now come out the oven you want to be first in line when it oh come on somebody preach back to me this morning morning I want the First Slice I want the first piece not my brother Lord me father not my sister Lord me I want the first cut the First Slice give me two slices I want all give us this day our daily bread he promised to provide in a special kind of way you think I bring this message this morning I have no message this is the prophet's message this is the bible message this is the Lord's message it's the Lord prayer and it's marvelous in our eyes it's still fresh he raises a standard by taking the same word and making it more positive Hallelujah Hall Give the Lord a s of praise thank him for the bread thank him for daily manner [Music] [Applause] H fresh bread fresh bread spiritual nourishment from the revealed word of God we are not a Pentecostal Church we're not a message Church no this is a bride Church yes there are three kinds of Believers in every church but we have the fullness of Revelation every Myster reveal and it's fresh it's fresh enough to deal with your situation today the message you deal with Tik Tok Facebook the mess could deal with all the music all the Fashions there's a fresh food every single day to deal with every trial you have to deal with all of the food value the nourishment you need for every trial is in this message you don't need anything else this thing good all by itself all the nutrients for the body is in bread this is not man big bread this is daily bread from the Lord [Applause] himself friends you may be seated I have no bread to give you my bread a taking you anywhere because Jesus said he is the bread he's the living bread so the daily bread is eaten brother George of the the living bread we are feeding on the body word the unfailing body word of the son of man that's the living bread fresh every day can the church say Amen come on young people you got to know this this is your message throughout every age with the pop well they had to seek God for the bread of that day so the just shall live by faith was the bread for luter day and if you fed on that bread you were nourished in that age in Wesley's age they had bread for their day Luther's bread was stale in Wesley's day they had to get fresh bread baked for their age baked for their hour God called men had to stand identified with the revealing of the word for that day only preaching fresh bread only bringing fresh bread but that bread also became stale during the open door age when the Pentecostals come can the church say amen and now under the messenger of the seven Angel seven star in the right hand of God Malachi 45 and 6 St Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 William Bram the prophet we have all the food value that was Tau up all over the ages big into the best bread you could ever eat the Lord Jesus Christ himself because the son of man was veiled in a son of man giving out the bread [Applause] himself Hallelujah you may be seated hallelu so I want to underscore friends that Jesus gave this Lord's Prayer and as a believer in every age you had a right to pray this prayer with the revelation of the word you had in that day it is just that in our day it means the fullness of of everything because we can look back and see what has already taken place everybody with me could you take some more Glory so much I want to skip a few things here because I have some us is day our daily bread and let's move on forgive us everybody with me forgive us our debts as we so your debt is conditional now this is a mystery here because this age there's a virtue of this age brotherly kindness forgiveness so Jesus was praying and yes they could have prayed it in the first age second age third age but this has significance because if this virtue is not displayed your father can't even forgive you who am I to hold something against you when God had to tell the prophet that when he was judging The woman there he said I forgive you and you condemn her So within the Lord's Prayer God drop a mystery of the virtue of this age it was relevant in every age but this age has particular significance we are dependent on God's forgiveness I cannot stand here this morning before you without God's forgiveness last week Sund neigh who over was preaching he say know to your ID I know Isaac ID you know yourself no one could stand here and claim to be anybody because the same blood for you is the same blood for me without the blood I cannot say anything because I need the blood to speak better things for me than I what I can say for myself I need the voice of the blood to speak for me who am I to hold a grudge sometime I go about over preach people renewing their grudges the The Grudge on a subscription until some you forget what The Grudge is for mama why we don't talk to them again I can't remember you know I just know we don't talk to them but within the prayer God is saying on a daily basis because you grow as a Christian by reading the word and praying every day and however you pray this here is a template that every day you're dying out to yourself and every day you're forgiven looking for God to release you and as you release others God releases you forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and if you hold one art but I'm said you stand in danger of Hell's fire thank you just one just one you imagine you stand for this B all these years and you can't forgive one brother one sister one Deacon one Usher the pastor your wife your children your coworker your boss and you risking your life because you you want to forgive we still in the Lord's Prayer and that simple verse speaks of two kinds of forgiveness it speaks of God's forgiveness and it speaks of forgiveness towards one another and friends quite honestly if there was no nothing to offend or nothing to hurt or nothing to create conflict there'll be never situation for us to have issue with one another but God by Design thank you Lord allow situations so that we can express this thing and brother brandham taught us that the devil will test every virtue to see what stuff you really made up because that those virtues is the entire word image of God that's the being when complete will go into Rapture so you have to have it all can the church say Amen everybody feeling fine could you take some more and then the prayer goes on lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil that lead us not into temptation it's powerful and we'll get to it when we dealing with the seals but it speaks of a testing time and a certain kind of a test can the Church Say Amen amen and Deliver Us from Evil So within the prayer and and your daily prayer and we'll see it in the seal exactly what this prayer really means for us you're looking for God to Lord don't lead me into temptation don't lead me into a trial a situation a test and Deliver Me from all evil and then it ends with a declaration for thine is the kingdom kingdom is in power now and the power so by the time you reach this portion of the prayer this is full restoration for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever can the Church Say Amen at the end of this prayer it speaks of God's kingdom fully restored it speaks of the Kingdom with Christ as king over all the Earth it speaks of the full authority of God being displayed and it speaks of the bride and the groom glorified his kingdom coming into Power Daniel's Vision come into full manifestation can the church say Amen now I want to jump into a few things here now from the message the seven seal brother brandham said the breaking of the seal was so great as heaven was hushed there was nothing move for half an hour but in the suspense of between death and life it seemed like a millennium it was so great Jesus never mentioned it none of the rest of them John couldn't even write it he was forbidden to write it can the church say Amen we're building into something the 420 Elders have stood and B goes and breaks out the whole drama of it Hallelujah let me skip through a few things here hallu God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seven mystery when the seven seal was open there was silence so all of this is painting a picture of the importance of the ministry of the prophet and the importance of the breaking of the seals and the re revelation of this mystery to us a voice to break the silence and brother brandham taught us a seal is a finished work and a seal signifies approval and the seal is necessary to protect what's inside and we know the Seven Seals was that book of redemption it was tied up in those seals and when you open a seal to look at the contents you could know what's happening under the seal now the first seal to the four seal identifies how Satan infiltrated the church with the Antichrist Spirit everybody with me four Riders the White Horse red horse black horse Pale Horse we're going to do a little teaching here some of you will know it some of you it's a reminder to you but even though Satan caused havoc in the church God still did a work of redemption and in every age even though these Riders were riding through the ages God still call upride and God sent forth a lion ox man and an eagle to deal with these Riders can the church say Amen this great drama of God being unfolded as he opened each seal and when he opened the fifth seal we see another work of redemption a work of redemption for the Jews and The Sixth Seal we know is a judgment seal the judgment to come but when he open the seventh seal there was silence a mystery under there Satan don't know what's there Hal Hallelujah the invisible God doing a work in secret because if he reveal it the devil could do damage and Satan is mad because he doesn't know the mystery of how you going to get into Power how you going to move from the altar of having to pray all the way to your throne of power moving into your full position as a royal priest can the church say Amen every seal had a symbol but the seven seal itself is Christ the lord himself he sending with a shout voice Trump Hallelujah could it be that you and I are the living symbol of the seventh seal to take us back to Eden back to the spoken word each seal had a word had a history had a age had a vision had a people the first to the four seals had their age and the history it was the church ages the fifth seal has the age of the Jews the six seal has a age which is the Tribulation hallu The Sixth Seal will have a history or a time three and a half years but the seventh seal since the prophet left we have been feasting under the of the under on the hidden manner under the seven seal the seventh seal as a age we are in the briide age the age of the seven seal and hidden under silence every mystery being unfolded s is a time for the bride to break the Silence from under the seven seal and it could it be the mystery of God of all ages was locked up through that Lord's Prayer when God said Deliver Us from Evil this is not just smoking and drinking but is the evil one himself Deliver Us From Time Deliver us from sin Deliver Us from sickness Deliver Us from unbelief Deliver Us from all evil Adam had lost the book this book of redemption Adam lost it Satan tried to grab it but that book of redemption went back into the the hands of the original owner only a certain hand could hold that book and John was weeping because there was nobody found worthy to even touch it or even look upon it and they cried out Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the royal king and there stood a lamb Hallelujah and that lamb stepped forward and John could shout because he knew that the silence was about to break the breaking of the seals to reveal the secret Plan of Redemption can the church say amen hallelujah Glory Hallelujah everybody feeling fine we are more than conquerors this morning do you know who you are could you take some more no I want to do something here now we start Ed in Genesis we started with the perfect will of God on Heaven and on Earth we started with man falling out of position we started with man not needing to pray and then prayer becoming a requirement because man communication with God was broken we talked about Jesus coming on the earth king priest Prophet sacrifice to restore the connection we talk about Jesus Christ dying because the lamb slain was the only one who could take the book and we talk about he giving them up blueprint brother Cen of a prayer that would withstand time would withstand ages it will work in the first age it will work in the second age work in the third age and it work in the last age can the church say Amen now the Seven Seals brother bam showed us the seven Mysteries unfolding God's Redemptive plan Revelation 6 and I saw when the lamb open one of the seals and I heard as it word a noise of Thunder one of the four be saying come and see and I saw Behold a white horse and he had sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and but man I'm identified this first Rider as the Antichrist amen that started riding through the first church age and M brandham taught us that this Antichrist Spirit began as a deception in the early church with the nickan influence and what this what did this nickan influence bring it actually brought a false fatherhood everybody with me in so much that we started to call for the Holy Father because that is where paple Rome started to form so when Jesus is now giving this Lord's Prayer The Lord's Prayer starts actually dealing with the deception of the first seal because those who were caught under that age of the first seal were being deceived into paple Holy Father fake father so when Jesus saying Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name this was now ammunition to deal with that first horse rider that was bringing deception to introduce a different fatherhood so the Lord's Prayer had in it a secret as it were to deal with the deception of the first seal the Antichrist Spirit under the first seal was trying to overcome God's position and receive worship as a Holy Father so here it is the Lord in the Lord's Prayer is given a weapon for the first seal Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name and that first horse rider trying to bring a Holy Father paple Rome that prayer dealt with that father dealt with that horse rider come on now everybody with me can the church say amen and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and they went on another horse that was red and power was given to him and sat there on to take PR peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and they were given unto him a great sword look at the mystery of God unfolding Jesus is actually speaking about all the church ages and all the seeds in the Lord pray because amidst this shift brother brandham calls it of the rider coming off of the White Horse to go onto the red horse but bham said now here is my revelation of it this is Satan again it's the devil again in another form he dropped his bow he got off his White Horse he got on his red horse for he can kill anybody that don't agree with him there's your seal so when Jesus said thy kingdom come prise what began as deceit on the White Horse became open violence Under the Red Horse and by the Bon revealed that the Antichrist Spirit under the second seal was uniting church and state to create a false Kingdom so in response to the red horse creating a false Kingdom he is Jesus saying thy kingdom come So within the Lord's Prayer The Lord's Prayer deal with the White Horse The Lord's Prayer deal with the red horse anybody with me this morning thy kingdom come stands at a bold declaration as the false church was rising up under that red horse rider as it were the falsehood raise a sword there was a kingdom that was being established and in the face of that kingom om here is the voice in The Lord's Prayer declaring thy kingdom come there's no other Kingdom that can match his kingdom it doesn't matter what they do the second seal showed a kingdom being formed which is church and state but the bom taught us that by the time you reach the third seal what was it a black horse balancing with a with balances in his hand the Bible says a measure of weed for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and so forth and what was it brother random typed this out as the will of man being expressed this was Pap Rome expressing the will of man with how you're supposed to go to heaven and all these things isn't that right what does your Lord's Prayer have thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven so that Rider tried to bring man's will as established and God is saying not man's will but thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven the will of man with how he supposed to be saved God deals with that writer can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah in that age but the Bram tled as a age of great hunger as they held back the wheat from the people as it were can the church say Amen the Believers had little access to the Bible we know these things by the time we come to the fourth seal what was it the Pale Horse but said that Pale Horse was wrapped up in him all the other horses and that rider was dead and what did God give us as a response to debt in the Lord's Prayer he said give us this day our daily bread because in that age of debt is not just natural that is spiritual debt famine in the land death in the land and in the midst of that as a response to that those in that age could say give us is there our daily bread and they could have life and sustenance away from what the devil was doing can the church say Amen we see the unfolding of God can the church say amen glory when he opened the fifth seal what was it Jews under the altar crying out for what for vengeance the next part of the prayer actually says about forgiveness because those Jews could only cry for vengeance because they hadn't received Christ but receiving Christ Ministry would give you a Ministry of forgiveness but yet still they were true so God would actually still do a work of redemption with the Jews but the connection there is still that Ministry of forgiveness and Reconciliation can the church say amen glory everybody feeling fine I'm almost done and the six seal what is it is a judgment seal and I beheld when he had opened a six seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black a sack clot of hair and moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell under the Earth even as a fig tree casted her on figs when she was shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it was rolled together and every mountain and Island were move out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bor man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sited on the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb from the great day of his Wrath has come who shall be able to stand the Judgment seal and in the Lord's Prayer the next part of the say lead us not into this temptation in other words this prayer actually means Lord don't I don't want to see the tribulation or know don't take me down this road not thises in other words words we are being taught that we have to pray Lord whatever I need to do I don't want to make that I don't want to be in that that's not my portion so the Lord's Prayer is actually saying avoid the six seal and it goes on to Deliver Us from Evil which is not just evil it's not just smoking and drinking this is the evil one evil has a source so it's the evil one and that last scripture which is Deliver Us he will for down the kingdom that's the seventh seal because the seventh seal deals with the Enemy the seventh seal reestablishes the kingdom the Seven Seals puts you into your position the seven seal is the claiming seal the seven seal is the Dominion seal the seven seal is the Seal of mystery the seven seing the seven [Music] Thunders can the church say Amen Glory Hallelujah can the Church Say Amen the seven seal is the Deliverance seal it's Christ coming back in the power the Lord himself that's who you are you are the mystery under the seven seal and you shall reign on the earth the musician get ready I'm wrapping up [Applause] Glory oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so the Lord's Prayer is a prayer that wits to the ages but it's a prayer that places God in his place and allows us to now come to God with the right kind of request because the Bible say but asking God a Miss we asking God for all kind of stuff driven by our own lust but here God is saying ask for Daily Bread ask for for spiritual food ask for him to lead us not into temptation ask for him to deliver you from evil ask for him to give you the Holy Ghost ask for him to give you a mystery of who you are that's that's the whole mystery of it can the church say Amen the musician get ready to come I'm closing out so Church you are a royal priest coming into your position with the ability to go to God any time any place under any condition with a revelation of who you are and with all of this food value how desperate ought we to be to know who God is is to know all about he say when we reach up there we should know all about him his nature his being his attributes that should give us a reason to shout and praise God like never before because we are children of the most high God and we are called for such a time as this born to be royal priests in such a time as this born to overcome every attack of the enemy young people this is your season now the enemy is raising up every sign is in place we see America saying why don't we take this land and this land and we know there'll come a time when all the nations will start to come together and all these things we are seeing what we have never seen before world power is going into movement economic changes taking place what about our day what about our pride isn't it time for his kingdom to come isn't it time for his kingdom to come into view and his kingdom to come into power and for we to take our position of sons and daughters and I want to remind you church that you will not go into the kingdom sick you can't make the kingdom depressed there's no room for depression in this Kingdom there's no room for sickness in this Kingdom there's no room for sin in this Kingdom when this kingdom comes into view sin will be destroyed that's why he said Deliver Us from Evil for dying is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever there's an eternal Reign coming and you and I are going to reign with him Hallelujah we are not creatures of time but we are creatures of Eternity may the Lord receive bless [Applause] you hallu hallu oh Hallelujah let's give him praise this morning hallelujah oh let's give him praise today oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory

it can't fail and God can't lie and remember you have a right to have communion with God a conference with God to talk it over look how how harmonious this service this day plan with what has been passed we thank God for know brother Isaac as God has blessed him to be traveling this little season here and get more more experiences of what God's love and the commitment of the Bel Bel all around how they love the Lord and they're seeking after God the same devil fighting them fighting you fighting us and we have to fight for one another pray for one another and pull up one another not to beat down somebody your kind lightting brighter doesn't mean that you want to out somebody light to make your candle light bright you want to help somebody light up you want to encourage somebody you want to pick them up there's so much negative all around and that's why God bring these things that you could see it clearly why he could justify us why because it is Adam and Eve's fault that's why we are here why we are great here that why we have sorrow that we have debt that where we have crying because of Adam and Eve if Adam and Eve did not fall we was going to be in a perfect State as Sons and Daughters of God so God in bringing this old Plan of Redemption he could bring us back to full justification as if we never did it now you as a finite person a human person remember all what you have done but God said he doesn't remember it because he has a sea of forgetfulness now if he doesn't remember it why should I hold it against you doesn't make any sense because he's the boss he's in charge I want I think about if he doesn't remember it why should I hold it against you so it is important because faith is based upon forgiveness you guys what people feel of they have faith and what they have no faith if they a big old gr is God so big it pumping out their skin pumping all the mouth every open the mouth is Grudge talking it's Grudge talking they are Grudge like Grudge speak have a voice you have to drop it you have to let it go it's like your passport stamp you have a Visa and you find away Glory you're going away you're watching you watching know what your neighbor will do

powerful thing was spoken a virgin shall conceive was just sit in that scripture until Mary came alone and father until the right men came come along they just sitting as quotes sitting as scriptures
