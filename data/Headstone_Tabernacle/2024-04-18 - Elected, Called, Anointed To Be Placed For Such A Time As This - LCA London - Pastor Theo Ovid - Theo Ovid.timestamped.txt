[31:51] the word tonight Romans 8 we're want to
[31:53] read verse 28-31 and then you're going
[31:55] to have your seats Romans 8
[31:58] verse 28 and we know that all things
[32:01] work together for good to them that love
[32:04] God to them who are de called according
[32:06] to his purpose for whom he did for know
[32:09] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[32:11] to the image of his son that he might be
[32:14] the firstborn among many Brethren
[32:16] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[32:18] he also called whom he called them he
[32:21] justified and whom he justified them he
[32:24] also glorified what shall we then say to
[32:27] these things
[32:28] if God be for us who can be against us
[32:31] may God bless his word tonight you may
[32:33] be seated have a context scripture from
[32:36] Esther chapter 4 and it's reading from
[32:39] verse 11 es chapter 4 and it says all
[32:42] the king servants and the people of the
[32:44] king's provinces do know that whosoever
[32:47] whether man or woman shall come into the
[32:48] king into the inner Court who is not
[32:51] called there's one law of his to put him
[32:55] to death except such to whom the king
[32:58] shall hold out the golden scepter that
[33:00] he may live but I have not been called
[33:03] to come into the king these 30 days this
[33:06] is Esther sending back a report to morai
[33:09] that she she can't go and the King
[33:11] hasn't called her and they told to morai
[33:13] Esther's words then Mori commanded to
[33:16] answer Esther think not with thyself
[33:20] that thou shalt escape the King's house
[33:22] more than all the Jews for if thou
[33:25] altogether holdest thy peace at this
[33:27] time then shall their enlargement and
[33:30] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[33:32] another place but thou and thy father's
[33:34] house shall be destroyed but who knew it
[33:37] whether thou had come to the kingdom for
[33:40] such a time as this then Esther B them
[33:43] return Mori this answer go gather all
[33:46] the Jews that are present in shushan and
[33:49] fasty for me and neither eat nor drink
[33:51] three days and night or day I also my
[33:54] maidens will Fast likewise and I will go
[33:56] in unto the king amen which is not
[33:59] according to the law and if I perish I
[34:03] perish oh blessed be the name of the
[34:06] Lord so tonight I have a title
[34:09] elected
[34:11] called anointed to rep placed for such a
[34:15] time as this
[34:16] amen elected called anointed to be
[34:20] placed for such a time as this have an
[34:23] inspiration if God before us who can be
[34:27] against us oh blessed be the name of the
[34:30] Lord so all the Believers in Hebrews 11
[34:33] they obtain a good report through faith
[34:35] they receive not the promise God
[34:37] providing something better for us
[34:39] hallelujah isn't that right then he said
[34:41] this church has got to come to
[34:44] Perfection and when and and then that's
[34:47] when Christ does come so Christ is not
[34:49] coming if there's no Perfection and it
[34:52] takes Perfection to beun the
[34:53] resurrection amen so make no mistakes
[34:55] about it it's not joining Church no sir
[34:57] it's not sitting down in church it's
[34:59] coming to Perfection so the prophet said
[35:02] the church in the minority has got to
[35:04] get into a place until this same kind of
[35:07] a Ministry that this left because when a
[35:10] headstone come it got to be honed so
[35:13] he's not talking about church members
[35:14] now he's talking about fitting something
[35:17] holding all the rest of the stones in
[35:19] the pyramid Lan so perfect you could
[35:21] hardly run a raise way through them and
[35:23] when the pyramid cap does come not not
[35:26] if it will come when it comes the body
[35:30] of Christ would have to be honed
[35:32] Hallelujah so you can't dress yourself
[35:34] you you you have to be cut to fit this
[35:37] thing amen you have to be willing to be
[35:40] cut that's right you have to want to be
[35:43] cut Hallelujah we accustom going to
[35:45] church we not talking about going to
[35:46] church we talking about being
[35:48] ConEd fitted Hallelujah cut yes sir
[35:53] watch watch up here when the pyramid cap
[35:55] does come the pyramid said the body of
[35:57] Christ will have to be horned not only
[35:59] through some Creed or doctrine when we
[36:02] come true it will have to be so
[36:04] perfectly like Christ till when he comes
[36:07] he and that
[36:08] Ministry or it have to have a that
[36:11] ministry here yes Christ come and have
[36:13] to meet the ministry of Jesus Christ in
[36:15] the church so the prophecy is that
[36:18] ministry will be among the bride that's
[36:21] right not to no the ministry of Jesus
[36:24] Christ his ministry has to be here among
[36:28] us hallelujah we have something to live
[36:29] for Hallelujah don't die yet we have
[36:31] something to live for don't give up yet
[36:34] we have something to live for don't
[36:35] backslide yet we have something to press
[36:38] on for oh because one thing God cannot
[36:41] do there are certain things God can't do
[36:43] he can't lie Hallelujah one thing he
[36:46] cannot do he can't lie whatever he says
[36:50] they going to come to pass whatever he
[36:52] said is true Oh Glory to God Amen
[36:56] Hallelujah praise God
[36:58] so they sleeping bride cannot come to
[37:01] Perfection because True Perfection is
[37:03] when we stand in the glorified state so
[37:06] the bride who have died on before they
[37:08] don't have their glorified bodies no sir
[37:10] they body in some box or somewhere and
[37:11] hole in the ground somewhere so they
[37:13] have gone on and we have to go and meet
[37:15] our tanes they have to pick up their
[37:17] bodies amen glorified State and that is
[37:21] perfection he redeem your soul he redeem
[37:24] your spirit then he redeem your body
[37:28] Oh Glory to God hallelujah there's no
[37:30] crippers over there you know there's no
[37:32] blind over there you know there's no old
[37:35] people over there you know there's no
[37:36] bald head over there you know there's no
[37:38] sickness over there you know there is no
[37:40] gray hair over there you know oh glory

[37:45] you don't belong to England you don't
[37:47] belong to London you're going back to
[37:49] Eden Oh Glory we here passing through to
[37:52] give a testimony that's right a glorious
[37:54] testimony of Our Redeemer amen oh pra is
[37:57] God so you have to stand perfected we
[38:01] have to stand a perfect man on the earth
[38:03] just waiting for this body to be changed
[38:05] that's right perfect in your soul
[38:07] Perfect by seven perfect spirits and all
[38:10] remaining is your body to be changed Oh
[38:12] Glory to God but say the church will
[38:15] come through justification
[38:16] sanctification B Holy Ghost until unto
[38:19] the Perfection of the son of man when
[38:21] husband and wife will be the self same
[38:23] person that's right here we go God will
[38:27] be
[38:28] manifested into his
[38:29] bride there not you trying something God
[38:33] will be so manifested in the bride
[38:37] Hallelujah so the prophet said when a
[38:39] man is born he becomes a spirit baby in
[38:42] Christ and when this Rob of flesh is
[38:44] dropped there's a natural body a
[38:47] theophany not made with hands that we go
[38:50] to and then that body returns back to
[38:53] pick up the glorified body so all the
[38:56] Sleeping Saints they don't have their
[38:57] glorified body no they have to come back
[39:00] to pick it up yes sir now watch
[39:02] Corinthians said if this Earthly Tac
[39:04] could be dissolved we have won another
[39:06] one so we have bypassed that to come
[39:10] straight from God to attribute to flesh
[39:14] purpose to be tempted that's right so
[39:16] tempted is a normal thing for believers
[39:18] that's what we sent here for we were
[39:20] sent here to overcome and the only way
[39:24] to overcome a test have to be given amen
[39:28] that we could prove to Satan we are not
[39:30] like Eve we don't have the given
[39:33] Hallelujah don't have the given
[39:36] Hallelujah you could stand Hallelujah
[39:38] glory to God say Amen you could stand
[39:40] you could stand you could stand what
[39:43] you're going through before you went
[39:45] through it God set it up for you he want
[39:48] to prove something to the devil my
[39:50] people would stand regardless Hallelujah
[39:53] glory to God so watch he this part so we
[39:57] pass our theophany and come to flesh to
[40:00] be tempted and tested by sin like Adam
[40:03] did here we go when testing of his word
[40:06] is over then we are taken up to this
[40:09] body that was prepared for us before the
[40:11] foundation of the world it is the word
[40:14] that we skipped to come right down here
[40:17] that's right oh Hallelujah to be tempted
[40:20] and tested and if we come through that
[40:23] because Jesus know all things because he
[40:26] was the word before he was
[40:28] flesh then we become the
[40:31] word here right on earth now we are
[40:35] formed to the word
[40:37] image preaching amen listen closely the
[40:43] books the tapes the messages the quotes
[40:45] are
[40:47] material this building was once sand and
[40:49] cement and Bricks but it has been formed
[40:52] into this building called a church
[40:54] that's right amen God is come to Bricks
[40:57] no and sand and cement he's coming
[40:59] something
[41:01] form so the material of the word of
[41:03] faith and virtue and knowledge that
[41:05] material but has to be formed and the
[41:08] trials and testings is what formed these
[41:11] things in you and
[41:12] I sir so here we have to be formed into
[41:15] the word image Hallelujah not your
[41:19] father image not your mother image not
[41:21] your image His Image so the image of God
[41:24] has to be presented to you and has been
[41:26] presented to you by the word oh we get
[41:29] in somewhere bear with me Hallelujah so
[41:33] you bypass your off the word so you came
[41:36] from thought to flesh hallelujah
[41:39] hallelujah here we are formed to the
[41:41] word image to be are partaker of the
[41:43] word to feed on the word and by being
[41:47] predestinated since the beginning you
[41:49] see that spark of life that you had in
[41:51] you from the beginning when you started
[41:54] your journey many of you remembered it
[41:57] you join this church or join that church
[41:59] nothing satisfied but then you recognize
[42:02] when the very word was Eagle
[42:04] food it wasn't you you know something in
[42:07] you that's right pull you to this
[42:09] message isn't that right that's right
[42:12] and watch he said now watch you said
[42:14] brother Bram therefore the theophany if
[42:16] you died and entered into that theophany
[42:18] what happens the theophany comes to the
[42:20] Earth to pick up the redeemed body and
[42:23] if you're in the air you take the body
[42:25] to meet your theop caught up to meet the
[42:28] Lord in the air now no man here go can
[42:32] come to me except the Father which sent
[42:35] me draw him and I will raise him in the
[42:38] last days so you didn't come to Jesus no
[42:41] he draw
[42:43] you let me say it again we getting
[42:46] somewhere tonight you didn't just come
[42:48] to the Lord and you want to get baptized
[42:49] in Jesus name no something pull
[42:51] you he said no man no man can come to me
[42:56] except the Father which has sent me draw
[43:00] him oh glory to godall so watch this no
[43:04] other man can do it no other person no
[43:07] matter how good you are is got to be
[43:10] revealed to you then you see who
[43:13] christes
[43:15] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so
[43:18] watch here's the predestination plan in
[43:20] plain view just as other seed the word
[43:23] of God is a seed must have the ground
[43:25] prepared beforehand that's right ground
[43:28] prepared
[43:29] beforehand that's your heart hallu here
[43:32] we go if you saw a SE just threw it in
[43:34] the ground it would do no good watch
[43:36] this God in Sovereign Grace prepares the
[43:40] heart
[43:41] first he prepared you before the
[43:45] foundation of the world take that devil
[43:49] he prepared you before the foundation of
[43:51] the world to receive him in this age I
[43:56] challenge want you to believe that
[43:58] [Music]
[44:01] tonight Hallelujah this is not trying
[44:04] something this is understanding what God
[44:06] is saying he prepared your heart that's
[44:09] right before the foundation of the world
[44:12] to receive this enti
[44:14] message he fornew You by his forn
[44:18] knowledge and ordain you to eternal life
[44:22] he knew you then he therefore he
[44:25] prepared you
[44:27] [Music]
[44:29] Hallelujah that's the reason you stagger
[44:32] out of these things and stagger into
[44:34] what you have now that means you have
[44:37] been
[44:37] elected what the scripture read who he
[44:39] for you hallu he called are you called
[44:44] yes did he call you well the calling
[44:46] upon your life is evidence that he forew
[44:50] you or he knew you
[44:53] before now in the beginning was the word
[44:56] the word was with God Satan came in the
[44:58] beginning but you were before the
[45:01] beginning that's where he forn you oh
[45:04] glory to God so he's not scratching his
[45:07] head wondering if you're going to make
[45:09] it or if you're going to come true he
[45:11] knew you will make it that's why he put
[45:14] you in the heat that you're in he knew
[45:16] you would come true that's why he could
[45:18] put the test upon you you are going to
[45:21] make it you have to make it you got to
[45:24] make it God has elected you
[45:27] [Music]
[45:29] Hallelujah before he could call you he
[45:33] had to elect you before you become the
[45:35] word you have to be a thought because
[45:38] the word is a thought expressed so
[45:40] before God speak it you have to think it
[45:43] and he was thinking about you and he
[45:45] spoke you by his word when the word is
[45:48] preached there was something turning
[45:50] inside of you that's

[1:21:18] whom we for know he called
[1:21:20] predestinated and who he called he also

[1:21:25] what was missing in that verse what was
[1:21:27] missing that part inside of there

[1:21:53] a feminist woman rights head vast that's
[1:21:56] right amen who refused to respond to the

[1:22:01] respond to her headship that's right the
[1:22:04] onetime Arrogant bride exactly of the
[1:22:07] king entitled woman just like the
[1:22:09] message will is today that's right the
[1:22:12] king rejected her and sought another
[1:22:14] exactly we know the
[1:22:16] story listen to this carefully yes sir
[1:22:18] this one is from the UN song but
[1:22:21] brandham says he can provide himself a
[1:22:23] church
[1:22:25] he don't have to have me he don't have
[1:22:28] to have you that's right somebody else
[1:22:31] can take your place that's true be
[1:22:33] careful exactly some don't take your

[1:22:42] make Style on the king king said get rid
[1:22:44] of that woman that's right let me get
[1:22:46] somebody else Hallelujah so if the

[1:23:00] can
[1:23:02] Glory Moni yes sir elected selected
[1:23:06] Esther Hallelujah she received things
[1:23:08] from for purification Esther did Esther
[1:23:11] couldn't reveal who she was that's right
[1:23:13] because Mori told her not to do
[1:23:15] iten keep still Esther yes sir don't go
[1:23:18] and pronounce and say this and say that
[1:23:21] she was elected she is called Hallelujah

[1:24:08] this verse two of chapter three of
[1:24:10] Esther reverence hmon for the king had
[1:24:12] so commanded considering him but Mori
[1:24:14] bowed not never not did that
[1:24:17] reverence so he man find that morai
[1:24:21] wasn't reverencing his ministry
[1:24:25] he wanted modai to Bow because morai him
[1:24:29] and F he had a bigger
[1:24:31] Ministry being placed by the king and
