[1:03:07] longer a slave to see
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:13] I'm a child and the child of yard isn't
[1:03:19] he lovely this morning
[1:03:20] what atmosphere to be in this morning
[1:03:25] rather seats
[1:03:29] Oh hallelu this is what the devil wanted
[1:03:33] you know this is what Lucy Coe wanted he
[1:03:38] wanted to be worshipped that's what he
[1:03:41] want he wants in worship
[1:03:42] oh my if he couldn't handle not be
[1:03:46] worship but the worship was the god
[1:03:49] that's what God put in her heart so
[1:03:51] moist and three it was all about worship
[1:03:55] amen so before we the scriptures this
[1:03:57] morning our testimony I'd like to share
[1:04:00] with you what I came back from the
[1:04:02] funeral there was a message on the
[1:04:05] answering machine a church machine and
[1:04:07] somebody called and they wanted to share
[1:04:10] testimony about what I don't know a
[1:04:13] person and so on and they wanted to
[1:04:15] share the discovers on the Internet
[1:04:17] and I began to connect and God bless
[1:04:20] them and it was talking about the Ghana
[1:04:21] meetings or the presence of God came
[1:04:24] into their home I just wanted to read
[1:04:25] this year god bless you but over after
[1:04:27] speaking with you you asked me to speak
[1:04:29] so I asked the person to write give a
[1:04:31] testimony write it out write it to the
[1:04:32] church so they wrote that ministry at
[1:04:34] his hometown Minako and she said after
[1:04:37] sticking with you you asked me to speak
[1:04:39] of the goodness of God in my life and I
[1:04:41] was thinking of how best to do that
[1:04:42] since after close examination God's
[1:04:45] grace his love his tenderness and
[1:04:47] gentleness and leadership has become
[1:04:48] more and more expansive in retrospect
[1:04:50] how to summarize the grace of God how to
[1:04:52] truly tell of his love for me I didn't
[1:04:55] realize how much God loved me until I
[1:04:57] had to do this thank you for moving with
[1:04:59] God's inspiration to encourage me to
[1:05:01] testify as I had fallen more in love
[1:05:05] with Christ I grew up with a message my
[1:05:07] life had his usual ups and down I was on
[1:05:09] my mary secured christian life I got
[1:05:12] married had my kids was holding on a job
[1:05:14] just waitin for the Lord to come however
[1:05:16] in 2012 God move in a sovereign hand
[1:05:19] creating the right atmosphere for the
[1:05:21] first time in my life I knew I met the
[1:05:24] Living Christ my life changed completely
[1:05:26] God was so real to me
[1:05:28] and I become so hungry spiritually
[1:05:30] although I knew the message
[1:05:32] Church took a new meaning its service I
[1:05:35] would go to here was a new discovery of
[1:05:37] Christ I could find out I started to get
[1:05:39] loads of the sermons to study on
[1:05:42] a week not knowing that God was forming
[1:05:44] a habit in me that would later all
[1:05:47] become so critical the Lord encouraged
[1:05:49] me and my family for the next few years
[1:05:50] by spiritual experiences dreams and even
[1:05:53] sending songs of deliverance
[1:05:55] I mean lyrics as well as the melody well
[1:05:57] whoa I thought surely this is the
[1:05:59] correct path soon the baptism of the
[1:06:01] Holy Ghost will fall this is what she
[1:06:03] sponsored in a heart okay then remote
[1:06:07] 2015 while examining the sermon notes I
[1:06:11] started to note a deviance from the
[1:06:15] truth of the message what it must be
[1:06:19] human error mistakes again and again not
[1:06:22] in proper context with what the Prophet
[1:06:24] was saying church began to become a
[1:06:27] chore a very very difficult chore the
[1:06:30] only conclusion was an ester in time was
[1:06:33] upon me and my family to me this was
[1:06:36] confirmed by a dream which I believe
[1:06:39] came from the Lord of how I was outside
[1:06:41] of the church I was attending eaten
[1:06:44] juicy rich foods in East because I had
[1:06:47] to join a powerful move of God that was
[1:06:51] about to take place in East of Trinidad
[1:06:53] this is a dream that she had and I had
[1:06:57] to be do in the dream the feeling was
[1:07:00] urgent well God made that place of
[1:07:04] worship so uncomfortable my family with
[1:07:06] many small prickles so much my husband
[1:07:09] got fed up that not even the ABCs of the
[1:07:12] church order was being followed he
[1:07:13] stopped going to church period he became
[1:07:15] bitter as not even the pastor was
[1:07:18] concerned enough to go after a fallen
[1:07:20] sheep well I was to learn that this was
[1:07:23] the norm I had kids still went until
[1:07:26] October 2016 when we just couldn't take
[1:07:29] it no more I heard a sermon which in my
[1:07:33] opinion put the Ministry of the bride in
[1:07:35] the tribulation period enough
[1:07:37] no one must trampled or mishandle or
[1:07:41] dislocate the Word of God Wow whoever
[1:07:44] sisters arrived at as good he had
[1:07:47] suffered enough no one is carrying me to
[1:07:50] the jubilation that is totally against
[1:07:53] the voice of God
[1:07:55] when I was a child which told me that
[1:07:57] with such conviction and so audibly D
[1:08:00] without us canna be made perfect I know
[1:08:03] I have a part to play in this endtime
[1:08:05] work of God so we left that congregation
[1:08:08] no looking back
[1:08:09] of course my dear parents couldn't
[1:08:11] understand I tried to explain as the
[1:08:13] best as I could I am loyal to wanting
[1:08:15] and wanting only the word of God not any
[1:08:18] man or Church love that kind of believer
[1:08:21] I want to be under the inspiration of
[1:08:24] the Holy Spirit and him alone I don't
[1:08:26] want any man's inspiration or so-called
[1:08:29] ministry a pastor can be deceived
[1:08:31] what ministry the only vindicated
[1:08:34] ministry was brother branham's and I
[1:08:35] can't and I won't believe that only
[1:08:37] place that truth mine you're a hundred
[1:08:39] percent truth was being preached was the
[1:08:42] church I no longer want any part of I
[1:08:43] know I was moving with the Holy Spirit
[1:08:46] and was not as the pastor put it having
[1:08:49] a lack of revelation because I was
[1:08:52] leaving the place of life that is where
[1:08:53] the seven thunders was being preached I
[1:08:55] refuse to believe that the old point of
[1:08:58] the Holy Ghost adoption will happen in
[1:09:00] that church since that church alone is
[1:09:02] looking for adoption then go out to the
[1:09:04] rest of the bride ensuring that I can't
[1:09:06] believe that a pastor canonical mistake
[1:09:08] and I won't ignore the Mystics against
[1:09:10] the word and follow his ministry I am
[1:09:12] seeing seducing spirits boluses in
[1:09:15] Jezebel Legion Nicollet ISM and
[1:09:17] denomination this is a sister they not
[1:09:20] even a minister Wow of course this is
[1:09:24] this was blasphemy to them I guess I was
[1:09:27] scared yes timid a big coward yes but
[1:09:31] God had established listen listen God
[1:09:34] had established his love in my heart and
[1:09:37] I just couldn't say no to his leading
[1:09:39] the assistant pastor visited and tried
[1:09:42] to find out our grievances and promised
[1:09:45] to sort things out he tried the voice of
[1:09:48] God was calling us to totally different
[1:09:50] direction than when we were heading we
[1:09:52] stepped out in blind faith no was our
[1:09:55] time of trying where to go the
[1:09:58] fellowship what to do now
[1:10:00] what about tithing and communion how to
[1:10:02] guide the family since my husband not
[1:10:03] even going to church I practically give
[1:10:06] up his spiritual role
[1:10:07] as head of the family but God is
[1:10:09] faithful we as a family had to go to
[1:10:11] this backside of the desert time we
[1:10:13] rested not realize how drained
[1:10:16] malnourished equipped we were
[1:10:17] spiritually we prayed and filled we
[1:10:20] fasted and filled we had no choice but
[1:10:23] to rely on God alone from the time we
[1:10:26] left the church till now God has been
[1:10:28] leading us to different resources every
[1:10:31] clue dewitt Bible based teaching Rabbi
[1:10:33] Jonathan Cahn with Messiah Jewish
[1:10:35] teaching the message of the Prophet
[1:10:36] William Branham with fresh new eyes and
[1:10:38] the Word of God my kids and I visited
[1:10:40] other message churches when we felt so
[1:10:42] starved of lack of fellowship during
[1:10:44] this time we all knew it was wasn't
[1:10:46] satisfying enough
[1:10:47] my sister was so supportive at this time
[1:10:49] we both experienced the same
[1:10:51] life-changing events but she hadn't left
[1:10:53] the church we used to call each other
[1:10:54] almost every day excited to share what
[1:10:57] manner will receive from the Lord
[1:10:58] we were removed from the shaky
[1:11:00] foundation we were on our established
[1:11:03] and our solid rock got trained us to
[1:11:05] examine on every side what we heard
[1:11:07] dreamt experienced and felt with the
[1:11:09] Word of God I love that train to examine
[1:11:12] every single thing by the Word of God
[1:11:14] and I used to tell her girls time to
[1:11:17] pluck up some of some feathers and we
[1:11:19] would change by the Word of God last
[1:11:20] year she sent me this sermon preached in
[1:11:23] India named there's a fivefold ministry
[1:11:26] yet and brother that set our souls on
[1:11:29] fire since God was showing us the same
[1:11:32] thing sometime before talk about
[1:11:35] confirmation and God was leading us
[1:11:36] right we felt so excited that a message
[1:11:40] preached I was preaching these things
[1:11:41] who is this person
[1:11:43] so during 2017 we started to listen to
[1:11:46] sermons preached by a brother Tieh ovid
[1:11:49] examining what he said with the Bible we
[1:11:52] would go up on message search find the
[1:11:54] coach he used making sure he was seen
[1:11:57] exactly what the Prophet said ensuring
[1:12:00] the context was current we couldn't
[1:12:03] chance our souls and the soldier or kids
[1:12:06] I love that this a person examine was
[1:12:09] been preached not even a church and
[1:12:10] they're going to him he
[1:12:13] amen that's a true believer for me
[1:12:16] that's all I want you in the word
[1:12:19] hallelujah praise God so so far my
[1:12:24] sister and I have found your teaching
[1:12:26] strong and steady on the message on the
[1:12:28] world we have learned from the Simmons
[1:12:30] we heard many times we got the answers
[1:12:33] to questions we had or more light was
[1:12:36] shed on doctrine that we were not quite
[1:12:38] sure of remember I had no one to ask no
[1:12:42] husband to guide me and cheering looking
[1:12:44] for guidance isn't our God great he has
[1:12:47] truly provided something happened with
[1:12:49] the two summers I listened to you that
[1:12:51] you preached and Gannon last month I
[1:12:53] felt the anointing of the meetings came
[1:12:55] through the computer screen and was in
[1:12:57] my home I was rejoicing with the
[1:13:00] congregation as if I was dear my god
[1:13:03] this is all church is supposed to be my
[1:13:06] family life has definitely changed since
[1:13:09] that sermon played it's as if a corner
[1:13:12] has turned the other sermon drove me to
[1:13:15] my knees and I called out the Lord what
[1:13:16] is the next step for this answer - keep
[1:13:20] praying and I do believe it was sent
[1:13:22] when you said you are from the tribe of
[1:13:23] Judah as I am from the tribe of Issachar
[1:13:29] and two of these drives make up the
[1:13:32] first wave of the army of God that good
[1:13:34] fought into the battles in numbers 10 I
[1:13:37] am sure I want to share the lyrics of
[1:13:40] one of the songs of deliverance that
[1:13:41] Lord sent and hope this message a heart
[1:13:42] a lovely melody fit but these are the
[1:13:45] words the army of the lion
[1:13:47] I feel the noise the noise of marching
[1:13:49] feet the noise of marching feet on the
[1:13:51] horizon I hear the song a mighty trumpet
[1:13:54] song the song of the army of the lion
[1:13:56] roar lion roar Thunder out your voice
[1:13:59] turned out your voice before you army I
[1:14:01] feel the wind rushing wind going before

[1:14:06] in clothes of righteousness shining with
[1:14:08] the armor of the lion the enemy is
[1:14:10] afraid the uname is afraid of the little
[1:14:12] army of the land the enemy is afraid the
[1:14:14] enemy is afraid of the marching of the
[1:14:16] army of the lion I see them run like
[1:14:18] mighty horses run
[1:14:20] the way the Eden's garden I hear them
[1:14:22] speak the language of the Lord are two
[1:14:24] it sort of cuts them all the nations I
[1:14:26] watch them climb like arrows of the Lord
[1:14:28] if it is walls and not a barrier
[1:14:30] prisoners cry out because they have been
[1:14:32] set free by the mighty power of the Lamb
[1:14:35] I see them stand upon the wood of God
[1:14:38] standing with the land of the army I see
[1:14:40] them rise high above the world sought

[1:16:59] Corinthians chapter 12 verse 13 1 verse

[1:17:16] Colossians chapter 1 verse 16 to 19 god
[1:17:19] bless you again and welcome welcome to
[1:17:21] all there's some prayer questions stuff
[1:17:25] we'll deal with after the service for by
[1:17:30] him all things for by him we're all
[1:17:34] things created that on heaven and earth
[1:17:36] on it is visible and invisible whether
[1:17:38] they be Thrones or dominions or
[1:17:41] principalities or powers all things were
[1:17:44] created by him and for him and he is
[1:17:46] before all things and by him all things
[1:17:49] consist
[1:17:50] and he's the head of the body the church
[1:17:53] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:17:56] the dead that in all things he might
[1:17:58] have the preeminence for it pleased the
[1:18:01] father that in him should all fullness
[1:18:04] dwell first Corinthians chapter 12 verse
[1:18:09] 13 for by one spirit are we all baptized
[1:18:15] into one body whether we be Jews or
[1:18:19] Gentiles whether we be bond or free and
[1:18:23] have been all made to drink into one
[1:18:27] spirit
[1:18:28] our last scripture is from st. mark
[1:18:30] ridden from sin mark 16 ridden from
[1:18:33] verse 15 and he said unto them go into
[1:18:36] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:18:38] every creature he that believeth and is
[1:18:40] baptized shall be saved he that
[1:18:43] believeth not shall be damned
[1:18:44] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:18:46] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:18:49] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:18:50] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:18:53] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:18:56] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:18:59] and they shall recover so then after the
[1:19:02] Lord had spoken unto them he was
[1:19:04] received up in the air
[1:19:05] and sat on the right hand of God and
[1:19:06] they went forth and preached everywhere
[1:19:08] the Lord working with them and
[1:19:10] confirming the word with signs following
[1:19:12] email let's pray father we thank you for
[1:19:15] your Holy Word Lord come now and breed
[1:19:17] fire upon it Lord make it alive and may
[1:19:19] the word become flesh among us that the
[1:19:22] invisible can become visible in Jesus
[1:19:24] and we ask it amen and amen you may be
[1:19:26] seated praise the Lord
[1:19:33] well this morning our title it's like a
[1:19:39] prophecy but it's it's the word when the
[1:19:42] power of discharge Rises
[1:19:44] that's the title when the power of this
[1:19:47] church Rises I have a subject the head
[1:19:51] of the body the church I have an
[1:19:54] inspiration and I want you to ponder it
[1:19:56] in your heart because this is what we
[1:19:58] want to say to God Lord you promised it
[1:20:01] that's all Lord you promised it you
[1:20:05] promised Eiland you promised deliverance
[1:20:07] you put mr. Brasher don't forget how you
[1:20:09] feel just remind god of what he promised
[1:20:13] because God is not a manner with life he
[1:20:16] can't promise you healing and o'healey
[1:20:17] oh he got probably deliverance under
[1:20:19] deliver you he kept promised the baptism
[1:20:21] of the Holy Ghost I'm not giving the
[1:20:22] Holy Ghost he kept promises his children
[1:20:24] coming back and they're not coming back

[1:37:02] praise give a moisture
[1:37:05] [Applause]
[1:37:24] [Music]
[1:37:27] when the power of this church rises the
[1:37:35] balances that Israel was not the Church
[1:37:39] of God and long as they were in Egypt
[1:37:41] they were the people of God because the
[1:37:44] Church of God is because you have been
[1:37:45] called out that word church means called
[1:37:49] out ones made different and this is not
[1:37:53] more it have more implication because we
[1:37:56] not only call what really escaped once
[1:38:01] we escaped them outside message in the
[1:38:06] message we keep on so we are very
[1:38:10] different we are radical we are rule
[1:38:14] breakers we don't cater for the elders
[1:38:17] and the Pharisees and the scribes we are
[1:38:20] just different okay the law some praises
[1:38:23] people know watch now in the Old
[1:38:26] Testament the known church was called
[1:38:29] the kingdom of God no the Old Testament
[1:38:34] nation was called the kingdom of God in
[1:38:35] other words what is a king and the
[1:38:37] church is his domain God's kingdom in
[1:38:40] the New Testament it is called him a
[1:38:42] psychic Empire he said I like that
[1:38:46] in other words the Messiah Empire where
[1:38:48] the Messiah rules and reigns no
[1:38:52] denominational barriers the Messiah
[1:38:56] rules in his empire is not wonderful
[1:38:58] therefore the church here we go is not
[1:39:01] an organization the church is not a
[1:39:05] gathering of people the church is the
[1:39:07] people of God
[1:39:09] that's been called out of the world to
[1:39:11] serve another kingdom
[1:39:14] [Applause]
[1:39:18] are you ready are you ready everybody
[1:39:22] alive in here there we go we have access
[1:39:25] to our King
[1:39:27] [Applause]
[1:39:33] we have an interview with him whenever
[1:39:36] we want to call upon him already
[1:39:42] we have no other intercessors we have no
[1:39:48] mediator between the king and us north I
[1:39:52] fall in between your posture in between
[1:39:55] no bishop in between no process in
[1:39:58] between no evangelist in between
[1:40:07] I am soaking Ghana oh yeah soaked in
[1:40:10] Africa they will show cut the word
[1:40:12] because this is the truth because the
[1:40:15] Prophet spoke it
[1:40:16] [Music]
[1:40:17] [Applause]
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:25] nor the mediator between the king and us
[1:40:27] but one man Christ Jesus so we are
[1:40:32] living in the kingdom and it is called
[1:40:34] the Messiah kingdom now words where the
[1:40:37] Messiah rules in every life in his
[1:40:40] Dominion rule in the lives of his people
[1:40:43] noticing interval of minutes that they
[1:40:44] ruling over people no he ain't talked
[1:40:46] about no message kingdom Anna no no this
[1:40:50] is the kingdom of God
[1:40:51] a quarrel of people from every walk of
[1:41:01] life
[1:41:01] Dadar him to get in a group it is called
[1:41:03] his church let's study what Jesus asks
[1:41:07] Peter in Matthew 16 who do men say I had
[1:41:10] a son am I now some say this some say
[1:41:12] that who do you see I am but caught in
[1:41:15] my surprise they didn't know Peter said
[1:41:16] no at the Christ son of the Living God
[1:41:18] Jesus said flesh and blood hath not
[1:41:20] revealed it to you but my father and
[1:41:22] have not reveal it to you and upon this
[1:41:24] rock I will build but over church my
[1:41:32] church and the gates of hell he didn't
[1:41:40] say it wouldn't come against eternal
[1:41:41] shall not prevail Rosalind Russell rule
[1:41:44] on the floor by the enemy all you'll be

[1:48:35] so people please do fight me purifies me
[1:48:40] but they will lose because I'm on the
[1:48:44] wid I've been this way ever since I so
[1:48:49] wanted to see what the tape says I'm not
[1:48:51] my preaching and a preacher model potent
[1:48:52] but I couldn't to him you might know
[1:48:54] that because I didn't want anybody to
[1:48:57] challenge me ever on something that why
[1:49:00] you see that no has to be in a word I
[1:49:05] remember but a Judith calm I gave a
[1:49:08] testimony of going to the brown on top
[1:49:10] on aqua I'm gonna bad I'm tell the
[1:49:13] ministers to tell the people how to
[1:49:15] receive the Holy Ghost and they had a
[1:49:18] meeting to tell the minister that
[1:49:20] unbroken went to it and the ministers
[1:49:23] was telling people when you believe the
[1:49:24] message you have the Holy Ghost :
[1:49:27] tell them that nobody prophecy man tell
[1:49:30] about come on stay along you boy to
[1:49:32] learn something now is he and buy a hunt
[1:49:35] who eating to believe a bus driver and a
[1:49:41] meal man they believe they never they
[1:49:43] believe them guys was over on the
[1:49:45] Prophet and here the point I want to
[1:49:48] make you know you could find where it is
[1:49:51] written he said that he said when you
[1:49:54] believe the message you have the Holy
[1:49:56] Ghost so people could call that as they
[1:50:03] call in God but what is the context of
[1:50:06] him saying that though that is where you
[1:50:08] have whole truth full truth he was
[1:50:13] saying that any context of these
[1:50:15] Pentecostals
[1:50:16] that claim to have an experience so he
[1:50:19] was saying to them if you claim to have
[1:50:21] the Holy Ghost the world that I'm
[1:50:23] preaching is from the Holy Ghost so to
[1:50:25] confirm you have the Holy Ghost
[1:50:27] received with a time preaching so I see
[1:50:31] the evidence of having the holy ghost is
[1:50:34] to believe and receive the message so
[1:50:37] you take that and run that you know
[1:50:38] people saying well I believe message so
[1:50:40] I have the Holy Ghost
[1:50:41] oh yeah next dude and jihad see the new
[1:50:45] birth is a revelation that is true you
[1:50:49] could find that but you also find the
[1:50:51] new boot is an experience not the one
[1:50:55] emphasized the experience because the
[1:50:56] experience is too complex because this
[1:50:58] is an experience it is easy to say
[1:51:01] revelation be a tunnel to me according

[2:01:08] for bread and fish you can get it after
[2:01:14] surface but you're coming for the fluid
[2:01:20] oh my so watch therefore berm says you
[2:01:24] kind of take intellectuals of men and
[2:01:26] make an organization to which Christ
[2:01:27] will govern dear for any companies any
[2:01:30] people's any groups of men that tries to
[2:01:34] organize the kingdom of God is going
[2:01:38] contrary to the king and if they are
[2:01:42] going contrary to the king it would be
[2:01:43] against the king so if it's against the
[2:01:46] king it will be Antichrist he said
[2:01:48] that's pretty rough but if I had a
[2:01:50] little more voice and make a carer I'll
[2:01:58] prove that an antichrist spirit no
[2:02:01] Thomas spirit no nice people but with
[2:02:04] Antichrist spirit on them
[2:02:07] it's not nice you know I'm not talking
[2:02:11] about the niceness
[2:02:11] I've not seen nice people and I seen
[2:02:13] spirits that's what I'm called to train
[2:02:17] to see spirits upon people upon
[2:02:20] ministers upon men hallelujah that's
[2:02:24] what these images for but I was studying
[2:02:27] a message and somebody asked Bertram
[2:02:29] could you could you know a personal
[2:02:31] question he said yes and for Mario a
[2:02:34] restaurant is a Christian she does a
[2:02:37] Christian he could know that that
[2:02:38] question on the deep on deep is a
[2:02:40] another Christian the spirit atmosphere
[2:02:44] that they vibrate that's why you say
[2:02:49] could talk to somebody in five minutes
[2:02:50] know that Christian or not I'm adopting
[2:02:53] somebody who's talking five minutes we
[2:02:54] have the mystery Trump and Miss really
[2:02:57] seals uninitialized shut up please
[2:02:59] are you a Christian what are you
[2:03:02] vibrating hold your mouth let me feel
[2:03:04] this bird so the Prophet you know
[2:03:08] somebody else Christian would only talk
[2:03:09] talk to make you a Christian his life
[2:03:17] so the man came up on the platform and
[2:03:20] the brown says he said uh you not here
[2:03:22] for healing you hear your preacher and
[2:03:24] you here for old-fashioned revival how

[2:03:30] I would fashion valuable he had
[2:03:32] teleported come for that you know the
[2:03:33] Prophet is in all of that

[2:03:46] want to be exposed Satan like they stay
[2:03:48] hidden
[2:03:49] but the Spirit of God come to expose him
[2:03:52] so look at me look in here go ahead

[2:04:21] vex because you see they tell the
[2:04:23] preacher what about them

[2:16:01] organization organizing them together
[2:16:03] which never was the will of God people
[2:16:05] has always first at me because I struck
[2:16:08] so hard at organization it isn't the
[2:16:11] people in there I am try cannot it's
[2:16:14] that here we go
[2:16:15] it's that dominating spirit that makes
[2:16:18] the people think we are the people that
[2:16:22] is the arrogance we are right and you
[2:16:25] are wrong no better tell me he in front
[2:16:29] your head on me I said brother I'm
[2:16:32] coming as fast as I could I'm gonna get
[2:16:35] there now you see he said well we
[2:16:37] appreciate car take us in a rapture I
[2:16:38] say taught the virtues have to take you
[2:16:40] say I didn't know it was a Brigitte if
[2:16:42] if what we preach and supposedly rapture
[2:16:44] we should we'll have to all know is 50
[2:16:46] years you're not tired but what the
[2:16:50] prophecy is this being when it's
[2:16:52] completed is the servant of God and the
[2:16:55] Church of God
[2:16:57] that's going the rapture if his
[2:16:59] preaching then he found a dose and a
[2:17:00] chance because in that region
[2:17:02] he is famine talk word uneducated he
[2:17:10] mushy smile miss his friend overhead
[2:17:12] soup because God has done he had to
[2:17:16] collect mysteries Christ is the mystery
[2:17:19] of God we see
[2:17:19] well whatever being revealed has to
[2:17:23] produce Christ he say after season his
[2:17:25] Sam's in the books whatever it has to
[2:17:27] produce Christ Paula Lewis as I said in
[2:17:29] mysteries has to be converted to virtues
[2:17:31] debugger anyhow you're still a width
[2:17:33] linear Abbott Hall Robert going on a
[2:17:35] holy other weight writer he's spinning
[2:17:37] around spin around here come right order
[2:17:38] we inferences I know brother years you
[2:17:43] show me season his soul there's no need
[2:17:46] for the baptism of Holy Ghost now forget
[2:17:48] I listening a spiritual yeah
[2:17:52] because he will pop the word and he's in
[2:17:55] season his soul and what he dropping up
[2:17:57] on the people's a quarter gram said you
[2:17:58] could have the button while he goes and
[2:17:59] be lost you could have it for 24 hours a
[2:18:02] day and still be lost
[2:18:03] okay that's what the Prophet said but
[2:18:06] what is the context he could get
[2:18:08] baptized in your body you could get
[2:18:10] baptized in your spirit you could get
[2:18:12] baptized in your soul just like the new
[2:18:14] body is a revelation I knew was an
[2:18:16] experience I will ask which one comes is
[2:18:19] not revelation only know which one comes
[2:18:22] first revelation comes first
[2:18:23] that's why Jesus opening understand to
[2:18:25] the Scriptures to give them a revelation
[2:18:27] of what it was going to experience so
[2:18:32] when they kept the experience because
[2:18:33] said this is that
[2:18:36] [Applause]
[2:18:37] 20 hours out in the house when they get
[2:18:41] the experience because it this is that
[2:18:42] that the profits make up so then they
[2:18:50] have a powerful group of powerful church
[2:18:51] and so on like that but they don't have
[2:18:52] the Holy Ghost and the people don't even
[2:18:55] know that I'm the same spirit of a
[2:18:59] common end cut and encounter in justin
[2:19:01] ville saying when they receive it to
[2:19:02] have it no they come and see it seems
[2:19:04] very come and say you are Holy Ghost so
[2:19:06] now you don't have to receive it so then
[2:19:08] people beamed to the tribulation because
[2:19:10] them a good looking for no oil because
[2:19:12] the added oil and the convinced I'm
[2:19:14] different because they are now so I'm
[2:19:17] not trying to convince anybody who you
[2:19:19] know have the own revelation whatnot
[2:19:20] because I my wife as if I'd sing a lot
[2:19:22] of violence is a cone funeral the
[2:19:24] heaters were still gonna hate wasn't
[2:19:28] gonna change nothing that's right so all
[2:19:32] we had to do is speak what God put up on
[2:19:33] our hearts and where the chips fall at
[2:19:36] for amen praise God hallelujah praise
[2:19:40] God so this brother now bring a whole
[2:19:42] church under the new bodies a revelation
[2:19:47] and you know yeah it season in a certain
[2:19:50] sense is like a new age teaching because
[2:19:52] the city new HC you are suffering from
[2:19:54] ignorance you need to be enlightened
[2:19:57] you are a God so you don't need to
[2:20:00] repent you just need to come to
[2:20:02] understand into who you are but that is
[2:20:04] without the spirit that's impersonation
[2:20:06] the Spirit of God supposed to go work to
[2:20:08] bring you to repentance at the cross and
[2:20:10] you could see at the cross where you
[2:20:12] died and they could put you on the cross
[2:20:14] and then go take you off the cross to
[2:20:16] walk with the cross on your back pick up
[2:20:19] your cross and follow me dearly that is
[2:20:21] what this is about a real debt a real
[2:20:23] dining out to kept the life of Christ
[2:20:25] inside of you because that is the
[2:20:27] important thing
[2:20:28] [Applause]
[2:20:30] or glory to God and it's so simple
[2:20:33] because Paul explained that like in my
[2:20:35] body to be burned do I have all
[2:20:36] knowledge do I know all mysteries I
[2:20:38] don't have charity I am nothing and they
[2:20:40] get charity you have to climb up the
[2:20:42] steps and Charlie come to seal the whole
[2:20:44] building
[2:20:45] because if charity is not there is have
[2:20:47] leaks and temperance leaks boram's is
[2:20:49] have leaks where all charity it will
[2:20:51] leak out patients the our patient's know
[2:20:53] Allah code
[2:20:53] the patient's run out but when charity
[2:20:56] call me call poor quality bond of
[2:20:58] perfectness it's the cement that cement
[2:21:00] the whole thing in that's why it has to
[2:21:02] be tested he said oh I don't worry the
[2:21:04] devil will test it for you
[2:21:06] the other one boss you will have enough
[2:21:09] trials and make it hot and heavy to know
[2:21:10] what you have inside of you
[2:21:12] or give the Lord a shout come on now are
[2:21:15] you with me this thing is real isn't it
[2:21:18] because the Rakta is not a gift isn't it
[2:21:20] it's a victory a minister God gives you
[2:21:23] character or glory that God is
[2:21:25] experienced his chairs is testings that
[2:21:28] is what gives you character
[2:21:32] United war insider here yes you have a
[2:21:34] wine cellar here with the wood and stuff
[2:21:36] sometimes
[2:21:36] but the real voice outside when you
[2:21:39] leave you on your job when you leave you
[2:21:40] in your home when you leave it with your
[2:21:42] family that is where the tests really
[2:21:43] are and that is where you have to get
[2:21:45] victory that is where you overcome poor
[2:21:48] glory to God a nice that was real a
[2:21:50] calculation hold percent they come into
[2:21:52] service 1.7 percent of the time you
[2:21:55] spend in church for the entire week they
[2:21:56] not even my tenth nineteen that takes to
[2:21:58] God you're not even spending 1/10 almost
[2:22:02] 1/10 of design 17 hours give God a Tyson
[2:22:06] of 17 hours of your time with prayer
[2:22:10] with listening to the Prophet listen to
[2:22:13] messages reading the book try that and
[2:22:15] see how much I could put hours and see
[2:22:17] how you always go in but at Facebook or
[2:22:19] whatever to YouTube whatever it is is
[2:22:21] killing time and set an all-call kind of
[2:22:22] thing often on your whatsapp so sometime
[2:22:32] I I didn't watch it it is too much have
[2:22:37] nothing
[2:22:37] Oh hallelujah I want to be ready and the
[2:22:43] only way I can be ready is to get ready
[2:22:44] by the word okay so is a dominating
[2:22:48] spirit that makes the people think that
[2:22:49] we are the people so that must never be
[2:22:52] here
[2:22:52] you must always walk with that humility
[2:22:54] to things and wanted to see me know by
[2:22:56] what George remember it respects and
[2:22:58] humility two things
[2:23:00] why because train another issue it
[2:23:02] respects and I know that and I want to
[2:23:05] be able to be humble because you don't
[2:23:06] know who God would use so that's why
[2:23:08] never be will anyone or kneel anyone or
[2:23:10] see this about this one and that
[2:23:11] Minister know what because you see I

[2:25:05] spirit you are in the body
[2:25:08] or give the Lord a show if God baptize
[2:25:13] you into that body and you never come
[2:25:14] back in this church you are still in the
[2:25:16] body you don't have to be in this church
[2:25:19] to be in the body you have to be in
[2:25:21] Christ come on say Amen somebody give
[2:25:26] the Lord a shout
[2:25:31] this is important because some people
[2:25:34] say hello here
[2:25:35] hello dear come here come dear
[2:25:38] as if the Messiah is dear it's not
[2:25:42] scripted for that listen well Ram says
[2:25:44] he said God's people is his caller
[2:25:46] people they are in every denomination
[2:25:48] they could be Catholic
[2:25:50] they could be Protestant they could be
[2:25:51] Jewish there could be any kind of a
[2:25:53] church but the real church is the
[2:25:55] mystical body of Jesus Christ and you
[2:25:58] cannot organize the mystical body of
[2:26:01] Christ so that is why he says 700
[2:26:04] guarded a bride but that really have a
[2:26:07] deeper meaning it means people in that
[2:26:09] gathering would be in the body by the
[2:26:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost not a bunch of
[2:26:15] people because we got in for years I
[2:26:16] have the people all born so that was
[2:26:21] gathering people but the bride which is
[2:26:24] the church that Christ is dead is that
[2:26:27] spiritual body that no man could put you
[2:26:30] in and you have to hunger and thirst and
[2:26:33] this is what this service is about just
[2:26:35] fill you up the hunger and thirst for
[2:26:38] righteousness that want to fill you with
[2:26:40] the Holy Ghost this is what this is
[2:26:43] about I want to be filled yes you
[2:26:46] promised it
[2:26:48] I want to be seen Lord yes you promised
[2:26:52] it you're not telling God you did this I
[2:26:57] did that and you feeling oh you said
[2:26:59] Lord you promised it so brother Branham
[2:27:01] says please good hallelujah you kind of
[2:27:05] organized the mystical body of Christ
[2:27:06] every person that comes to Christ comes
[2:27:07] out of the world comes into Christ comes
[2:27:09] into this mystical body and you are
[2:27:11] member of that body and you are brought
[2:27:13] into this church call out and baptize it
[2:27:15] is mystical but you get it not Methodist
[2:27:17] not Baptists not Pentecostal not
[2:27:20] Nazarene so I can t write off anybody
[2:27:22] right or somebody is going to can't

[2:36:17] return to discover the time of life
[2:36:19] he said no other life could work in my
[2:36:21] brain so we carry little Pentecostal
[2:36:23] access other than talking songs and we
[2:36:25] tended that we have to get dynamics
[2:36:27] supreme power in control the mind of God
[2:36:31] the intelligence of God that is what
[2:36:34] have to come because this is the final
[2:36:39] of all the ages God waited for this age
[2:36:43] see it and when in God's Eden and mess
[2:36:45] things up and God waited for Satan to
[2:36:49] have his Eden and know the sons of God
[2:36:51] is about a mess up mess up and

[2:37:25] want to skip a lot of stuff you may be
[2:37:26] seated
[2:37:27] the purpose in sending the Holy Spirit
[2:37:30] was for one purpose that God himself
[2:37:32] might dwell in the church and continuous
[2:37:35] plans through the church isn't that
[2:37:38] right
[2:37:39] praise the purpose of the Holy Ghost is
[2:37:41] the father again God the Father dwelling
[2:37:46] in you working on his plans to finish
[2:37:49] his plan of redemption working through
[2:37:50] you making you a co-worker with him

[2:37:56] your fallen lost brother and sister

[2:38:03] of Eden Adam Adam where a dog that is
[2:38:05] what the Holy Spirit does to man and
[2:38:08] woman Christ poured himself into the
[2:38:10] church therefore no watch at that day
[2:38:13] you will know I am in the father you
[2:38:14] will me and I in you
[2:38:15] for it's the whole thing is one plan of

[3:02:01] name is redeemed the book is closed not
[3:02:05] saved redeemed redeemed means feet all
[3:02:08] the way to charity you're redeemed by
[3:02:10] Christ when the last name is redeemed
[3:02:12] the book is closed he didn't intend no
[3:02:15] one to be lost but his foreknowledge
[3:02:17] know who would be lost
[3:02:18] therefore he could predestinate and then
[3:02:21] their names were put in a book and that
[3:02:23] is when the book redemption is closed
[3:02:24] see you with some seals and the last
[3:02:26] name goes on that book and he changes it
[3:02:29] or the last name that's redeemed that
[3:02:31] was put in the book that subtly he comes
[3:02:34] to claim what he has redeemed Oh

[3:28:12] able to visit me I would like to share
[3:28:14] with the church my experience with Jesus
[3:28:17] through my situation when I arrived at
[3:28:20] the Coover Hospital I was gasping for
[3:28:22] breath when they took me to see the
[3:28:25] doctor they immediately put me on oxygen
[3:28:27] at this point I was sitting on the bed I
[3:28:29] wanted to sit at the edge of the bed but
[3:28:32] the doctor told me no I was feeling as
[3:28:34] if the oxygen mask was stifling me I
[3:28:37] asked her to remove it and she said no
[3:28:39] because the oxygen level in my body was
[3:28:42] very low I felt as if I needed help and
[3:28:45] no one was helping me at this point I
[3:28:48] stopped hearing any stone and was
[3:28:49] looking around the room I saw people
[3:28:52] moving around and felt as if no one was
[3:28:55] helping me I started to see somebody
[3:28:58] help me somebody help me but as soon as
[3:29:00] I said god help me him instantly a calm
[3:29:03] came over me and all fear left me I
[3:29:07] can't remember if I shut my eyes but it
[3:29:09] was as if no one else was there except
[3:29:12] Jesus and I I started to speak to Jesus
[3:29:15] in my mind and told him I would hold on
[3:29:19] to his promise that he would never leave
[3:29:21] me or forsake me I said Lord let your
[3:29:24] will be done and you are in control and
[3:29:26] my life is in your hands at this point I
[3:29:28] surrendered all to him I was very calm
[3:29:31] and all fear left me I felt the
[3:29:33] president the Lord with me and I knew in
[3:29:35] my heart that he was and still is with
[3:29:37] me I don't know how long this was for
[3:29:40] because the next thing I knew I was
[3:29:42] lying in the bed and I could hear myself
[3:29:43] saying Jesus Jesus Jesus and the next
[3:29:47] thing I heard that doctor telling me yes
[3:29:49] say your prayers and relax
[3:29:51] then I heard that news telling a doctor
[3:29:53] that my blood pressure which had been
[3:29:55] extremely high and wasn't going down was
[3:29:58] in fact going down the doctor then told
[3:30:01] me that she would send me to San
[3:30:02] Fernando General Hospital because I had
[3:30:04] a mild heart attack fluid in the lungs
[3:30:07] and the oxygen level in my body was low
[3:30:10] I still felt no fear and was very calm
[3:30:13] because I knew Jesus was with me at San
[3:30:16] Fernando Lee removed a fluid from my
[3:30:18] lungs they did the echo on my heart on
[3:30:20] Monday and on Wednesday the doctor to
[3:30:23] marine heart was damaged and the heart
[3:30:24] cannot repair itself while he was
[3:30:27] speaking to me I was smiling because I
[3:30:29] was telling myself I know who can repair
[3:30:30] it give me a new one
[3:30:34] he also tore my heart was weak and I
[3:30:37] said to myself no it is strong he said
[3:30:40] my heart is beating slow and they have
[3:30:42] to run some more tests and according to
[3:30:44] the results it may end up having to do
[3:30:45] heart surgery I was smiling because I
[3:30:47] still have no fear and I said let God's
[3:30:50] will be done all this weighs honor and
[3:30:53] glory every time the devil touches me it
[3:30:56] just confirms to me more and more Who I
[3:30:59] am because I know he kind of touched me

[3:35:41] good morning brothers and sisters and
[3:35:45] once again soliciting your prayers for
[3:35:47] my daughter Felicia who will be once
[3:35:50] again undergoing surgery on Monday the
[3:35:54] 1st of February 2018 at the Mount Hope
[3:35:59] Women's Hospital since her last surgery
[3:36:02] Felicia's condition has progressively
[3:36:06] gotten worst the injections and
[3:36:08] medication she had to be given proved to
[3:36:12] be useless and many of the side effects
[3:36:14] from the drugs only added to further
[3:36:16] cause deterioration of her body the
[3:36:19] fibroid which the injection was supposed
[3:36:21] to shrink has grown larger and the
[3:36:24] endometrial stage 4 is now staged for
[3:36:28] frozen pelvis and remi Tia's as it has
[3:36:30] since fused itself to many of her organs
[3:36:34] therefore now putting her life at risk
[3:36:37] the doctors informed her that this
[3:36:39] high-risk surgery may not be the end of
[3:36:43] a medical condition as the Ender Matias
[3:36:46] may return however the surgery is
[3:36:48] crucial for them to remove as much of
[3:36:51] the N demetrius as possible which itself
[3:36:54] until removing many of her female
[3:36:56] reproductive organs and mozzie felicia
[3:36:59] continues to be in good spirits even
[3:37:01] after signing the forms at the hospital
[3:37:04] informing her of the many many things
[3:37:06] that can go wrong the biggest one being
[3:37:08] death since I stand in faith with my
[3:37:12] daughter as we trust a great physician
[3:37:14] to do a complete work in the situation
[3:37:17] once and for all please stand with us
[3:37:20] I will be in prayer and fasting on the
[3:37:23] day of the surgery next Thursday I'm
