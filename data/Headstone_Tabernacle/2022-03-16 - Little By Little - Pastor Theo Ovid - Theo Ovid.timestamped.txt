[21:36] chapter 23
[21:38] wondering from verse 20 to 30 and
[21:40] deuteronomy chapter 7
[21:42] we're going to read from 17
[21:44] to 26.
[21:46] reading from exodus chapter 23 verse 20.
[21:49] behold
[21:50] i sent an angel before thee to keep thee
[21:52] in the way and to bring thee into the
[21:55] place which i have prepared
[21:56] the way of him will be his voice provoke
[21:59] him not for he will not pardon your
[22:00] transgression
[22:02] for my name is in him
[22:04] but if thou shall indeed obey his voice
[22:06] and do all that i speak then i will be
[22:08] an enemy unto thy enemies
[22:10] an adversary unto thine adversaries for
[22:12] mine angel
[22:13] shall go before thee and bring thee unto
[22:16] the amorites and the hittites and the
[22:17] parasites the canaanites levites
[22:19] jebusites and i will cut them off
[22:22] thou shalt not bow down to their gods
[22:24] nor serve them nor do after their works
[22:27] but thou shalt utterly overthrow them
[22:30] and quite break down their images
[22:32] and he shall serve the lord your god
[22:35] and he shall bless thy bread
[22:37] and thy water
[22:38] and i will take sickness away from the
[22:40] midst of thee
[22:41] they shall nothing cast their young nor
[22:43] be barren thy land
[22:45] the number of thy days i will fulfill
[22:48] i will send my fear before thee
[22:50] i will destroy all the people to whom
[22:52] thou shalt come and i will make all and
[22:55] enemies
[22:56] turn their backs onto thee
[22:58] i will send hornets before thee we shall
[23:00] drive them out the hivites the
[23:03] canaanites to the hittites from before
[23:05] thee i will not drive them out from
[23:07] before thee in one year
[23:09] at least the land become desolate
[23:12] and the beasts of the field multiply
[23:14] against thee
[23:15] by little and little
[23:17] i will drive them out from before they
[23:19] until they'll be increased and inherit
[23:22] the land
[23:23] deuteronomy chapter 7
[23:25] reading from verse 17
[23:28] to 26.
[23:30] if thou shalt say in thine heart these
[23:33] nations are more than i
[23:35] how can i dispossess them
[23:38] thou shalt not be afraid of them
[23:40] but shall well remember what the lord
[23:42] thy god did
[23:44] on the pharaoh and unto all egypt
[23:47] the great temptations which thine eyes
[23:49] saw and the signs and the wonders and
[23:52] the mighty and the stretched out arm
[23:54] wherein the lord thy god brought thee
[23:56] out so shall the lord thy god do unto
[23:58] all the people of whom thou art afraid
[24:01] moreover the lord i god will send hornet
[24:03] among them
[24:04] until they are left
[24:06] hide themselves from thee be destroyed
[24:09] thou shalt not be affrighted at them
[24:11] for the lord thy god is among you a
[24:14] mighty god and terrible
[24:15] and the lord thy god will put out those
[24:18] nations before thee
[24:20] by little
[24:21] and little
[24:23] thou mayest not consume them at once at
[24:26] least the beasts of the field increase
[24:28] upon thee
[24:29] but the lord thy god shall deliver them
[24:31] unto thee
[24:32] and shall destroy them with a mighty
[24:34] destruction until they be destroyed he
[24:37] shall deliver their kings into thine
[24:39] hand thou shalt destroy their name from
[24:41] unto him they shall no man be able to
[24:43] stand before thee until thou have
[24:46] destroyed them to give them images of
[24:48] their god shall you burn with fire thou
[24:50] shalt not desire the silver or gold that
[24:53] is on them nor take it unto thee at
[24:56] least that will be sneered therein for
[24:58] it is an abomination to the lord thy god
[25:00] neither shall not bring an abomination
[25:02] into thy house at least there will be a
[25:04] cursed thing like it but thou shalt
[25:07] utterly detest it thou shalt utterly
[25:09] abhor it for it is accustomed may god
[25:12] bless his word you may be seated praise

[25:24] by little
[25:28] and i saw something somebody i saw
[25:30] something on uh somebody had sent
[25:33] and these were the words
[25:35] you're not going to master the rest of
[25:37] your life in one day
[25:41] relax
[25:43] master the day
[25:45] then keep doing that every day
[25:48] that is a powerful statement
[25:50] you're not going to master the rest of
[25:52] your life
[25:54] in one day relax
[25:57] just take a deep breath
[25:59] master the day

[26:07] victory

[26:10] you
[26:10] hallelujah little
[26:12] by little
[26:14] oh blessed be
[26:16] sin starts small
[26:19] always
[26:20] but it's still sin
[26:23] james 1 13 says let a man say when he's
[26:26] tempted i'm tempted of god
[26:29] for god cannot be tempted but evil
[26:31] neither attempt to be any man but every
[26:32] man is tempted when he's drawn away of
[26:35] his own lust
[26:37] and enticed
[26:38] and then when lust had conceived it
[26:41] brings forth sin
[26:42] and when sin is finished
[26:44] it brings forth
[26:46] death
[26:48] it starts as a thought
[26:50] that shoots across the mind
[26:53] the thought carries a desire
[26:55] and desire takes it down to a deed
[26:59] and a deed comes a habit
[27:01] and a habit forms
[27:03] a character
[27:05] thought
[27:07] desires
[27:09] deed
[27:10] habit
[27:12] character
[27:13] and that character
[27:15] takes you to your destiny
[27:20] no small hill
[27:21] for small sin and big l
[27:24] for big sin
[27:25] sin is sin
[27:27] big or small
[27:29] just like a bush fire starts with a
[27:31] little spark
[27:33] but it starts from some point
[27:35] just a little
[27:37] thing it always starts
[27:40] a little
[27:42] little sins lead to bigger ones
[27:45] small error leads to big errors
[27:48] a little
[27:49] off the path and you continue so far so
[27:51] long time
[27:52] later on your financial way off at the
[27:54] beginning it looks near like it you know
[27:57] if you had to go north east and you just
[27:58] got a va a little bit you find yourself
[28:01] not somewhere but not where you're
[28:02] supposed to go
[28:04] it always is small in its infancy
[28:08] like the prophet talked about the
[28:10] philistine baby who has a nice baby but
[28:11] that could be um i'll come a big man and
[28:14] kill him kill it
[28:17] a murderer don't start off being a
[28:18] murderer
[28:20] start off being a liar
[28:22] competitive
[28:23] big teeth
[28:24] and then getting some kind of young
[28:26] thing and afterwards they
[28:28] kill it wasn't intentional i will become
[28:31] a murderer no
[28:33] it started
[28:34] somewhere
[28:37] praise the lord amen
[28:39] joshua seven
[28:42] and he brought his soul man by man this
[28:44] is after joshua was trying to check out
[28:46] why things are going right
[28:48] why things going off beat because god
[28:50] tell him every place you put your foot
[28:52] is yours no man shall be able to stand
[28:54] before thee all the days of thy life i
[28:57] lives 40 and everything and all of a
[29:00] sudden men started get
[29:02] die and all kinds of things like that
[29:04] so you won't know what's going on what
[29:06] is this he called a halt
[29:08] try by tribe
[29:11] family by the family
[29:13] then man by man
[29:15] so you couldn't hide any tribes
[29:17] coming to the family and it's not a
[29:20] family it's one by one man my man and he
[29:22] brought his household man by man and
[29:24] aiken the son of kami the son of zabdi
[29:27] the son of zerah the tribe of judah was
[29:29] taken
[29:30] joshua said unto ake and my son give i
[29:32] pray thee glory to god of israel and
[29:35] make confession unto him tell me now
[29:37] what that was done is not from me and he
[29:39] could answer joshua and said indeed i
[29:42] have sinned against the lord god of
[29:43] israel and thus on this have i done when
[29:46] i saw his eyes at work now
[29:48] when i saw
[29:50] among the spoils a goodly babylonious
[29:53] garment
[29:54] and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of
[29:57] gold and 50 shekels weight i coveted him
[30:01] that's in his heart now that is the
[30:02] desire
[30:03] you see with his eyes he thought hit him
[30:06] and his desire activated he started
[30:08] covered down
[30:10] all right
[30:11] he said i covered them
[30:12] and took them he cannot know behold they
[30:15] are hid in the earth in the midst of my
[30:17] tent and the silver under it so joshua
[30:20] sent messengers and they ran into the
[30:22] tent and behold it was hidden this tent
[30:24] and silva under it and they took them
[30:26] out of the midst of the tent and brought
[30:27] them to joshua and unto all the children
[30:30] of israel laid them out before the lord
[30:32] and joshua and all israel with him took
[30:34] ikan the son of sira and the silver and
[30:36] the garment and the wedge of gold his
[30:38] sons his daughters his ox his asses his
[30:41] sheep his tent all he had they brought
[30:43] them unto the valley of eco and joshua
[30:45] said why hast thou troubled us the lord
[30:48] shall trouble you this day and all
[30:50] israel stole them with stones and burned
[30:52] them with fire after they had stoned
[30:54] them with stones and they raised over
[30:57] him a great heap of stones unto this day
[31:00] so the lord turned from his fierceness
[31:02] of his anger wherefore the name of that
[31:04] place was called the valley of echo unto
[31:06] this day
[31:11] just like that
[31:13] the instruction was don't touch the goal
[31:14] don't touch what they have don't fear
[31:16] leave it to bring it to the house leave
[31:18] the business alone i detest it hate it
[31:21] because i'm going before you
[31:23] hallelujah now remember they didn't give
[31:26] themselves that promise
[31:27] god give them the promise
[31:29] i will bring you onto this land
[31:31] he said the land is already occupied
[31:34] they knew up front it wasn't land that
[31:36] was empty with grass and and desert no
[31:39] the land of hittites and jebusites the
[31:41] land is already occupied but don't worry
[31:43] with that
[31:45] don't worry who's the occupants of that
[31:47] land i'm going to fight for you i'm
[31:50] going to in front go in front of you you
[31:52] wouldn't possess it in one year
[31:54] little by little
[31:56] oh glory to god you wouldn't get where
[31:58] you want to go immediately but little by
[32:00] little you have to manage little you
[32:02] have to understand what little is praise
[32:05] god if you're praying every day that's a
[32:06] little bit little every minute little by
[32:09] little oh praise god you're putting some
[32:11] deposit in little by little you're
[32:13] looking for no get rich quick business
[32:15] listen by little you could save and get
[32:17] where you want to go little by little
[32:19] give the lord some praises
[32:21] hallelujah give the lord some shouts
[32:24] luke 16 10
[32:27] to 12
[32:29] jesus speaking he that is faithful in
[32:31] that which is least
[32:33] is faithful and also in much
[32:36] and here is unjust in the least
[32:39] is unjust also in much
[32:41] if therefore you have not been faithful
[32:44] in the unrighteous man who will commit
[32:46] you unto trust you to riches
[32:48] and if you have not been faithful in
[32:50] that which is another man who shall give
[32:52] you which is your own
[32:53] the amplified
[32:55] he who is faithful in a very little
[32:57] thing
[32:58] is faithful in much
[32:59] so before god load you up
[33:03] god have to see if he could manage
[33:06] the little that he give you
[33:08] and based upon your diligence
[33:11] application
[33:12] fervency dedication he could give you
[33:15] much
[33:16] because you know the same principle that
[33:18] you applied in managing little you will
[33:21] use this in principle in applying that
[33:23] which is much so god wouldn't have no
[33:26] horrors given you much when you see you
[33:28] could effectively manage little or give
[33:30] the lord some praises
[33:32] oh glory to god hallelujah so when you
[33:35] are strong to manage the little that you

[33:58] chew on yourself they will destroy
[34:00] yourself oh glory to god god want people

[34:08] faithful and literal oh glory to god
[34:10] because you know if you're faithful and
[34:12] literal you'll be faithful in much glory
[34:14] to god because there's an approach to
[34:16] god little by little he told them that

[34:21] land so you don't have to get frustrated
[34:23] you don't have to get fed up you don't

[1:17:56] to fight every inch of their way but it
[1:17:59] was assured that it would be given to
[1:18:01] them
[1:18:02] no matter what the results what the
[1:18:04] circumstances look like it was tears god
[1:18:07] gave it to them they looked at the
[1:18:09] promise instead of the of the
[1:18:10] circumstance healing is yours
[1:18:12] but i'm fleshing it out now salvation is
[1:18:15] yours the holy spirit is yours
[1:18:17] then he said the real holy spirit is
[1:18:19] yours
[1:18:21] if god calls you he intends for you to
[1:18:24] have it
[1:18:26] that you may not strongly i wonder if
[1:18:28] they say amen outside of there if god
[1:18:30] calls you he intends for you to have it
[1:18:33] but you have got to fight every inch of
[1:18:35] the way to get it
[1:18:37] you certainly will look it come to our
[1:18:41] place friends the way this world is so
[1:18:42] awful is going to make you prove every
[1:18:45] inch of ground you stand on satan is
[1:18:47] going to do it it's coming to a time
[1:18:49] where impersonation and carnal thinking
[1:18:51] is going to be circumcised from the real
[1:18:53] true body of christ
[1:18:55] he's going to have a body that's pure
[1:18:57] holy filled with his spirit walking in
[1:19:00] his spirit and doing the works that he
[1:19:02] did be faithful to that
[1:19:05] hallelujah
[1:19:06] he will never come down watch he said
[1:19:08] footprints mean possession minister and
[1:19:10] brethren don't be afraid to put your
[1:19:11] footprints where god told you to go it's
[1:19:13] possession he told joshua everywhere you
[1:19:15] place the stool over your feet it's
[1:19:16] yours we won't back up we take what god
[1:19:19] said that's the truth no matter what the
[1:19:22] opposition is how great it seems how
[1:19:24] difficult it seems if god said so it is
[1:19:26] yours and when he gave it to joshua he
[1:19:28] never said i'll take all the device and
[1:19:30] fill his hands and give it to you joshua
[1:19:32] had to fight for every inch of ground
[1:19:34] but god was with him and every inch of
[1:19:36] ground you will cover brother to make
[1:19:38] footprints you fight your way through
[1:19:40] and take the sword of the spirit brother
[1:19:42] and move right on he is a marvelous
[1:19:44] shepherd let him feed you he would feed
[1:19:47] you on his word the holy spirit lives by
[1:19:50] the word and every promise in the book
[1:19:52] of the great shepherd is to his sheep
[1:19:55] but brother he will never come down and
[1:19:57] drive it away from you you've got to
[1:19:59] fight every inch of that promise it is
[1:20:01] yours it belongs to you i'm almost done
[1:20:04] here joshua fought every inch of ground
[1:20:06] from one end of the country to the other
[1:20:08] one but he had a promise god said i'll
[1:20:10] give it to you where there was giants
[1:20:12] whether there's atheists whether it's
[1:20:13] infidels whether it's called formal
[1:20:15] churches what difference does it make
[1:20:17] god give the promise let's take it it is
[1:20:20] ours it belongs to us
[1:20:22] abraham praise god in other words i
[1:20:24] applied to the church today because say
[1:20:26] lord god here's my brother he is laying
[1:20:28] there stricken with cancer he is
[1:20:30] tricking tuberculosis he's got i lay
[1:20:32] hold of the promise it's my possession
[1:20:35] you told me so there you are and when
[1:20:37] you go after that enemy that devil that
[1:20:39] slaughter is just the same as abraham
[1:20:42] slaughtering the kings and brought back
[1:20:44] that possession yet abraham had a right
[1:20:46] to the promise and the promise was his
[1:20:48] and yet he had a right to possess it and
[1:20:50] the believer today we are heir to all
[1:20:53] things yet we are heir to every
[1:20:54] spiritual blessing every physical
[1:20:56] blessing every blessing the bible
[1:20:58] promises yet you have to fight every
[1:21:00] inch of it and that's the way god got it
[1:21:02] set up he set it up that way oh glory to
[1:21:05] god it always been that way you have to
[1:21:07] fight to possess what you know is your
[1:21:10] own you have to fight to possess it and
[1:21:12] that's what we have to do now
