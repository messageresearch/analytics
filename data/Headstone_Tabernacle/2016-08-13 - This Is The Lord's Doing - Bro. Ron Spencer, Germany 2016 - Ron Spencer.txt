would like to Echo the thoughts that brother zon just shared with you of how much I appreciate being able to be here it's great honor for me to stand here tonight and being a part of this incredible meeting we when brother sigmon asked me a couple of years ago we were sitting in a dining hall in swiland and we were basically setting knee to knee when that took place and he shared with me his vision for this meeting brother sigon is filled with love and we are taught by the prophet of the Lord that love conquers all we must remember that we're going to wind up sitting at the same table hallelujah hallelujah we're a family we're not enemies we're family and being family we're brothers and sisters sure there will be skirmishes in the backyard sure but in the front yard We Fight Together I thank you for coming I realize that you like myself came under some strain and probably we'll go home under some strain but we will all have a testimony that we met Jesus if you haven't met Jesus here this week you've missed the picture last night to me was one of the greatest meetings I've ever set in I was overwhelmed by the atmosphere I I actually put my hand on my far and said this just can't [Music] stop and so we thank the Lord that it didn't amen amen amen this morning was out of this world I witnessed I witnessed this man come on the when brother sigon asked me two years ago I felt the witness of the Lord to come I just felt him come in my heart and say that's the thing to do the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord we did not know two years ago of where we would be today for myself I left home and my father-in-law which is the founder of the church is it could pass away any day they have they have placed him in a comfort care he's been more than just a buddy or a senior pastor but he's been a second Daddy to me when I kissed him on the head the other night I did not know but I trusted God that God would keep him during this time my wife as many of you know which would be his daughter her lungs is filled with tumors and literally hundreds and even into the thousands of tumors they're not malignant but they drain very much of the energy away from her now all of that strain going on in the home there are a lot of people that told me I shouldn't be here but two years ago God spoke to me and told me to be here so if he spoke to me two years ago to be here he made a promise brother Kelly that he would be here hallelujah hallelujah so I would like to thank each and every one of you and I know you left home with a strain but I pray that God would richly richly reward you Hallelujah I have enjoyed every preacher you're great man of God and I just I have just made some brand new friends I told Brother ID yesterday maybe this morning it's

brother colen brener called this meeting before the foundation of the world he called a conference with his children we are the predestinated seed of God that God had on his mind before the foundation of the world and he knew what corner of the earth that we would be in he knew exactly where we would be and the god that placed something on the inside of your heart Gather in this meeting that's the god that's the god that designed this meeting it's more than a man I would like to say that's more than a Revival more than a convention this meeting has not been the competition of preachers we're not here to outdo one another we are each putting our shoulder against the will to advance the kingdom of God we are finishing this battle and I would say to you we will finish it strong because this voice is not the voice of a weekend this is the voice of the mighty angel that has come to this generation it is the voice of the Archangel echoing through the Jesus Christ this is the Lord's doing amen amen amen in our territory at home there was a man named stone wall Jackson stonewalls you may have heard of him brother ROM Compares him unto Joshua he taught in a military school just near my house he actually was born right where right near where I was live Stonewall Jackson studied every battle of Joshua stonewalls and he believed in God Watching Over the predestinated Sea he was of that dispensation of age of predestinated maybe not understanding it quite like you and I under the revelation of the word but he believed that if God was watching over that seed there was nothing that that could destroy it until God's purpose was done he was nicknamed The Stonewall stew because in a Manasses battle he stood in the middle of an open field sat on his on his horse there was bullets flying in every direction and his men his men looked at him and called him he stands like a stone wall he was later to declare unto his men I am a safe on the battlefield as I am at home on my pillow if we could realize this tonight that the devil cannot touch a hair of our head until he gets permission from our God and before that he can touch a hair of our head before you go through a trial God has has committed confidence in you that you can make it through your trial I would not know the dark of your trial even tonight does and the god that knows exactly where you're at he knew where Lazarus was at he knew where the woman at the well was at he knew where Legion was at he knew where Georgia Carter was at exactly he knew where you was and God is determined he's determined to get his and he says I will not lose a one I wanted to share with a portion of a quote he said there isn't enough power in all hell that can ever defeat the purpose of God listen there's been a lot of great preaching here and I'm sure the devil is scared of this meeting just now but while he's on the run I want to scream man there isn't enough power in all hell that can ever defeat the purpose of God and if this meeting was God's purpose nothing that can defeat hallelujah hallelujah is it good I'll share just a just a quotation with you remember one time a story of a little cotney in England he was just an ordinary man and they said that the king one of the kings in the early days was going into his Palace and he had a message to that he had to get forth an Urgent Message because of the enemy and he said to this little fell standing there he said here take this message take this message to a certain place and command this to be done and he said take my scepter in your hand that'll vindicate you notice what he said take my seer in your hands that'll vindicate you that you're sent from me and he stuck it under his Roe and way he went the guards were everywhere trying to stop him get away get away I have that message of the king I'm the king's messenger a Vindicated word I thought and get out of my way I have the king's message I must go one time when they killed the Prince of Peace and put him in a grave and sealed up the T and death held him for three days and night but on Easter morning he had a scepter in his hand and he said get away D get away gra open up I am the king's message I must come forth to prove this Resurrection I am the resurrection and the life I pray this week that this declaration is in your heart that you can realize that you are the king's message you're God's crowning achievement you are that Invincible Army you are bone of his bones you are life of his life you are power of His you are the bride predicted you are that superace you are that Royal you are the queen you're more than a church you're more than a group of people hallelujah hallelujah you are the [Applause] bride we either believe this or we don't believe it this message wasn't to the Baptist message wasn't to the Methodist this message wasn't to the denomination was the bright her to come and we have a message from the K do you believe that now if that be so in the name of Jesus hallelujah hallelujah we can declare tonight that we're in a very special place amen we're in a conference with more than a man [Applause] the same God that's Among Us stood here and we had the greatest Vindicated Prophet other than the Lord Jesus Christ we've had personal eyewitnesses through the week but our God didn't die behold I send you Elijah the prophet there was three in there God Elijah and you some of you have gray hair no hair some of your young children each in its own came to the recognization of who you are and became aware that this is your as morah would say this is your time this is your moment more than just to recognize it recognizing and doing nothing is not what this is about but you must recognize [Applause] it so this is as brother bisco would use the term the place I was literally amazed as I heard the message last night I showed brother Tim PR the text that I would read tonight of what my text was that he would meet us in a large [Music] place and this is the Lord's doing if we're not careful we'll miss the moment I I I apolog oliz to you but I I want to just drop this to you you must have an appreciation of this moment if God designed this meeting together this is God at work not a man at work man makes a mess out of things pollutes things man pollutes things this is God that is at work and if you was looking at a work of Shakespeare you must realize he's not a normal writer he is the master of Master if you're listening to Beethoven's Orchestra it's not some average orchest writing he's a he's a he's a gift that's beyond extraordinary he is a master writer and and people that have an appreciation or brother brand would use the term interest interest in it you must have an interest in it to have an appreciation for it are you with me now said his word is like a symphony he said to those who are not interested in it it sounds like a bunch of Racket to them maybe to the world this looks like a bunch of ret but to those of us that are aware this is God Gathering his children [Applause] so this is more than a facility this is a beautiful facility it's a has incredible equipment it is so well put together you could have a you you could have a rock music here you could have an orchestra here you could have a motivational speeches here great corporations could come here for a week off but God chose to gather his children from all Realms of the earth and divinely Inspire his musicians his voice is on the earth to speak to the Bride of Jesus Christ and to declare unto them we're in the [Applause] vision and this vision is God's Vision you say well brother Ron you're stretching you might be stretching just a bit hope I'm following the same boss that you are Luke chap 9 and verse 27 and Jesus is speaking like this is it all right if I go on but I tell you of a truth that there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God there were men that was standing there that would miss this event they was precious people as a matter of fact we would call them Inner Circle people and some sometimes we're actually set in a service and one feels like they they've been in the greatest service in their life and another didn't get anything it is simple they was not plugged in they was not tapped into the source not aware of the moving of the holy spirit because God is in every service if we could only become aware of what he is doing are you with me now and it came to pass about 8 days after these sayings notice he links the scripture together after these sayings he took Peter and John and James and went into a mountain to pray and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his reignment was white and listening and behold their talk with him two men which were notice how positive he is when he writes it Moses and elas Hallelujah who appeared in glory of his which he should accomplish at Jerusalem you're talking about a service to be in you have visibly watched water turned to Wine you've watched Lazarus come out of a tomb you've watched the change of the woman at well you've watched him step his foot on the brow of a boat and then declare never a man speak like this [Applause] man this was more than a prophet they recognize this is more than another teach is more than another man Jesus turns to his own disciples say who the men say that I the son of man and some of them said well some say listen you do not need a secondhand Revelation you must have this for yourself this is an individual Rapture individual around the world be taken two in the field want to be taken two at the meal want to be taken I'm not waiting on my wife I'm not waiting on my neighbor I'm not making excuses for El this is mine this is eternal matter have I must have this Revelation I must have this life I would declare this to you that this is more important than the oxygen in your lungs right now is this working this is more important than the oxygen in your lungs because there will come a day that there will be no oxygen in your lung that has been predestinated sin that has been predestinated to eternal life and when there's no life in this mortality we step from this realm so it's more important brother Bram said you you let your job you let your children your family take it out of you I just want to just stop here just for a moment don't let nothing get between you and this [Music] word I heard I've heard it over and over again you need to have a relationship with this message I was raised in it from a baby but that don't make you converted I had heard it for years and years years years but one day I met the voice that's behind the voice are you with me and I became consumed with eating the book I am consumed with staying in this word I am consumed with these seven I am consumed [Music] are you with me are you with me now you can be consumed with the events of life there's no Rapture in the events of life but this word has power to transform your body it's not just for you it's for your neighbor I just want to say this to you these books are worth more than life these tapes are worth more than life it's an open book to you a closed book to the world an open book to the Cs the Cs were not revealed to the world they were revealed to the and we heard the thunder sound out of them and that word sounded to the Bride of Jesus and then we could recognize why we're not a denomination why we needed a token why it was the Mighty God un why it was the true Master why he could stand there and preach and not stand there presuming are you here to preach with that was more than a man standing behind the pit that was more than just a group of messages that was being delivered inport in Arkansas in Indiana in New York York in California it was more than just choosing of a bride God was making a declaration I'm choosing a wife this is how I want her with me just for a moment I know you know these things but I just want to maybe somebody's tuned in but there's never been a man that could step out from behind the pull pit and say I take every spirit in this building under my control and there will come a holy harsh brother brother bis you was involved in the interview when when even as brother Sydney and them begin to describe that even the animals came to a hush this was more than a gift this was not some charismatic gift people want to play games with gifts more than a gift this was him coming to the Earth this was the mighty Angel standing on the and calling the world to order that was more than a statement listen that was more than a statement are you with me just now I I want to make sure you get this because most men cannot control their own Spirit most men cannot control control their own Spirit but here was a man standing on the earth that was trusted this Authority that could step back when he came I every spirit in this and every devil in that building had to obey the voice of God Amen and I declare unto you the voice of God is in the Bride of Jesus Christ so you must speak to your Mountain God wants to hear it from your voice he wants to hear you speak nobody can do it but you you must speak to your mouth and declare to the devil I am not a SL no long this is more than Lazarus being coming from a grave more than coins in a fish's mouth was standing it was standing Brother Thompson he was standing and here stands two Prophets one of those prophets brotheris talked about last night one of the saddest days was Moses walking up a hill crying because he could not go into the promised land he couldn't control his own Spirit powerful Breen powerful one of the greatest Gifts of theet even liken himself under Jesus Christ he couldn't control his own sp Temper Temper so he's waving goodbye to his people don't you know Satan was watching that don't you know he's walking up the hill brother Tim as he's walking up the hill ter is running down over his feeling the failure I can't go in I can't walk across I've been through some incredibly hard things I can't walk across with my people and Satan no doubt in his I won the victory because it's the blood of bulls and goats I this great prophet to diminish and powerder but God would not allow the enemy to have victory it standing at the top of that mountain angel can you imagine now I'm going to presume for a minute forgive me this Satan who is the accuser of the bre can you imagine them trying to make a claim on this body because he's given the right to be the accuser trying to make a claim on Moses body and he can't find it he can't find the grave he can't find the stone he can't find the place where he's lay but now he's standing with Jesus J he's watched the Liah go in a rapt brother brandham said that Elijah went over to the bush and there was a chariot on fire and he rode that Chariot right he said there's Chariot setting on all those bushes they're waiting for you [Applause] am hallelu Two Worlds Jesus standing with Witnesses and Jesus is standing and I'm not going to do it justice but here stands Moses and Elijah brother George that's quite a place you could go to where that's at and see where the stones are at but it's quite a place for Jesus to be standing God comes down and he veils him he overshadows him God speaks out of Heaven the prophet would use the term adopt son this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleas and here stands two Prophets The only thing that they can do is take the word of the promises of Psalms 22 my bones they stare at me take the scriptures that tell him I will not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption because the prophet of God said the word had to look at the word he said you got to look at the word Jesus had to look at the word to see what it would we're doing here tonight looking at the [Applause] word Isaiah 53 was more than poetry it was more than just holy r prophecy and as a prophecy it's power in the seed he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised from my iniquities not just those in the Old Testament but it's still an effect today you walk to the altar this morning this blood has the power to cleanse all sin I want to remind the devil at this point there's not a devil in hell that can hold a child of God in bondage your Liberty Proclaim your Jubilee [Music] free huj the blind man is not blind anymore the woman at the well is not a harlot anymore Legion is not full of the devil anymore neither are you just for just in a church but you have recognized who you are hallelujah hallelujah so we're not bound by [Applause] walls slavy slavery is a cruel thing still in effect today it goes beyond racial barriers come out of hell many people are slaves to a job they're slaves to men they're slaves in relationships I'm coming to your house holding you bondaged maybe you're slave to a music slaves to pornography and you wrestle and struggle in the darkness you see brother Ron sitting in a group like this I wouldn't preach against it if I hadn't picked it up but you don't have to struggle in the darkness no longer you can tell that devil I'm done with you and it is over with your slave no longer brother brandham watched a woman and a dream being beaten by a three cornered stick and that Three Corner stick was try in Godhead and and she was being beaten but it did not have to stay that way you're not a beaten wife you're a liberated elected lady before [Music] the you are the queen of heaven and God has restored your glory is that all right now there were moments that I'm going to do my very best to be quickly but I want to I don't want to drop a few things here when the prophet of God and an individual would stand in front of him maybe a patient and he would tell them you feel that between us you know that's him don't be scared of that I want to tell you tonight you're sitting in your Pew and you feel that that's him to come to liberate you huj did you get it he has come tonight I know it's the last service I know you're a little weary but you don't have to go home the same way you walked in here this afternoon well this is another service I watched brother bisco call out a young man that had leukemia last night is it all right to share a testimony I'd like to show you a picture mind brother Jonathan Jonathan are we there about nine years ago I had spoke at brother bis's camp at his convention it was on a Saturday evening and in that in that convention I had preached on the passion of our Revival probably about 2,000 people was Sting in the and during the midst of that in the midst of that I I made a declaration that the devil cannot touch a hair of your head until God gives him permission we do not know what's going to happen tomorrow within a matter of a few weeks I it was a Monday evening and I I came home after a funeral week to light a fire and I was using a propane probably probably a lot of you have heard the story but I want to just for a short minute and this propane exploded on me my son was there to grab me out of the fire it burned my face it burned my arm my arms burned to the bones it melted my face it burned down my throat it burned my lips it took the skin off my tongue it burned my esophagus and it destroyed 75% of my lungs I laid in a coma for almost a month a medic a medicated what they call a medicated coma to make May survive because of the trauma of it Dr Kramer who later was on an airplane with me he he confessed he said I never expected you to live I would be moved to a burn unit about an doct immediately begin to work they did not expect me to live and it went day after day after day they put life support on me that life support was running at 100% the doctors was telling my wife that there's nothing more that we can do but I was in a [Applause] place brother bll lives about 3,000 miles or maybe even further that away from me you're talking about the God's order of putting the Switzerland meeting together I believe the same God that put the Switzerland meeting together meeting together God spoke to him to call my wife and he dropped it in his heart I can't tell it like he can tell it maybe he's already told but my son who saved me from the fire was burned as well and he was in another hos and I was in the burn unit and they wouldn't tell my son my condition doctors knew most likely I wouldn't live but after about a week of that God deposited in brother br's heart that they had purchased Mount Baker Bible Way Camp Baker A M Baker I want you to think about this already read the quote there's nothing that the devil can do to destroy God's [Applause] purpose do we believe that we're his SE we his SE and he told sister Connie you can imagine her emotional state of mind of what it was like to have a son in one hospital and her husband her pastor the business leader everything everything just consumed and here's a voice on the other end of the line who we've got much confidence in and he's telling sister con I can't tell it like he can tell it he's telling sister Connie that brother Ron whispered in his ears that he's going to be the speaker at the camp next year I want you to put some things together just now Sister con's listening to the doctors she's looking at the circumstance but she's heard the voice that's behind the voice are you with me just and it anchors in her heart not just for a couple of days but for weeks people telling and telling what they see and doctors what they but she's Heard a Voice he will not just survive this he will I want to declare to you you're not just going to survive Le you're going overcome it hallelujah hallu hallelujah am I've got a buddy here theyve been a buddy for a long time we've all got buddies we've all got friends I got a lot of friends here brother Kelly hilderbrand who who spoke so incredible the other morning I had a scheduled meeting with brother Kelly but God had different plans it was his annual meeting I felt like I would be there but God had another plan brother Tim PR was speaking at brother Craig boers and God impressed on his heart to go home so he made a flight home to Louisiana and he was standing in a barn standing in a barn with his son expressing his burden about his buddy laying in a coma and saying he should be out by now I'm just not getting the picture right and he drove over 20 hours and a hard trip to come and speak not just to speak but to visit and he said I felt like the prayers of all the saints from around the world I felt like a priest walking into that room with that pray the first day he walks in I'm being allowed to come out of the coma I'm extremely confused might expect that to be I do not know what's happened to me and brother Tim begins to he's the one that is that they wanted to talk to me first and he begins to describe to me what has happened here's his statement I've not come to preach your funeral brother Tim would but after prayer because you couldn't stay with me Al long in that condition and they would leave the room and they'd ask him to speak that weekend and he spoke a sermon and I want to describe a couple of events for you as the evening would W on I would go into a nonresponsive even to which they would declare no brain wave activity and I must declare to you I felt myself slipping away and this is the very thought that I had this must be what it's like to die and I heard the nurse declare He Slipped Away this is what they would find the next morning this is my brother to my right this is my wife in the middle and this is my youngest son and I want I want I want to tell a story about are you are you okay to now I want to declare this this message third po form now we either Believe It Or we don't believe it when brother Tim comes back and my family comes back to the now all the hope that they've had for now a month all of that hope has now just evaporated we would not know until weeks later they were preparing to harvest my organs I have to tell you I still need my or [Applause] they watched they watched all of this go on the night that brother Tim walks to the pull pit sometimes we take services for granted and think this is just another service I declare to you tonight it's not just another brother Tim walks to our pull to our congregation God will have a testimony brother Tim they witnessed that 36 hours of that state no hope no hope all but you must remember God used that bis to say next year he'll speak in my meeting sister Karen is here with brother they went to Cracker bar Barrel the next morning at breakfast they was preparing to drive home was going to come and see me one last time and brother Tim's prayer was I want brother Ron to speak to me before I leave as they were coming down the hall brother I they heard my voice hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah I did speak that meeting I did make that trip I did stand and preach those meetings under the direction of the Holy Spirit but God had Eternal things on his mind the boy in this picture my son who was raised in my home it's a home that's listened to tapes the voice of the prophet of don't let the voice of this Prophet become a stranger to your home he's more than your favorite preacher are you with me [Applause] now but you got to know the voice behind the voice and we took my whole family to that trip because it was a vision of God we sat through that meeting at the end of that meeting on Monday we were taking a day off God directed me to deal with brother bis's grandson Joel and we literally sat down on some chairs and I recognized this was a place and at this place God designed The Secret of his heart no lightning no great loud thunder no feelings God transformed his life that's the power of this message God's not done yet that was brother Tom Ray's sonay God would use brother Tom Ray deal with my son neither knowed anything about what happened with Joel God would deal with my son standing on the street in a moment in a very moment with people going every we away on the street God came down and transformed his life that boy is a dynamic preacher he just spoke at brother Tim's camp this is not inherited is not handed down this is not given to be trans [Music] Hallelujah I appreciate all the emotion in the world say two things to clear my thought I appreciate all the emotion in the world but in the Stillness of a moment God transform your life and you can go from the worst sinner in the whole world and only seconds later be a complete brand new creature old things passed away but that will produce an excitement in your life a stimulation in your life you'll become drunk on the holy ghost [Applause] from I don't have a picture of my father-in-law but my father-in-law who's laying now getting ready to go into his future home these men that are here they that know him testify to this this is a kind of man that believed this message with all of his heart he would give his life for this message the founder of the church they would they would worship and I've visibly watched him dance in the spirit for two hours dance in the spirit for two hours and then stop and preach for two hours and then Worship the Lord for two more hours [Applause] hour I don't know what charismatic Pentecost is but I know what the reality of worshiping it should be a spontaneous combustion bursting to life a response you should not be offended at that people can go to go to a ball game and get excited the devil will not hinder you none there you can go to a rock concert excited the devil will not hinder you n but when you come to church the devil will climb on your shoulder and try to make you ashamed because something is moving on the inside it should be more than your favorite preacher it should be a word response soul [Applause] I watch I watched the young man stand last night with leukemia I stood in a meeting like last night I want to stop and caution you just now maybe in your carnal flesh maybe you looked at your watch that was a bit long maybe you're thinking that right now but sometimes we sit in our pews and Miss what's going on I'm not lifting up a man now caution your thoughts on that brother bisc was preaching on a new creation in North Carolina standing at a convention with about a thousand people and I was sitting in the right balcony with my scarred lungs brother Peter I was sitting about the realm of where those lights would be and I was sitting with my father-in-law my mother-in-law my wife and he was speaking about one cell being bruised and then it begins to scar many others becomes cancer but the spoken word of God can bring not just restoration but Recreation I was setting in that position and I said tonight's my night I stood to my Fe I raised my hands before God and the Holy Ghost fell on this is more Than A Feeling but God 100% restored my love is this all right just a couple more moments I finished I was finishing in a meeting just a few just a few months ago and I was speaking I was speaking on facing your enemy and just and just why would you tell these stories brother Ron cuz so many people say God's not

Among Us and it's not a man it's not a group it's Universal around the world some of you got it I'm going run it by you again some of you are looking for a Revival that's happening right now some of you're looking for things to come Happ right now you can either amen or restored limbs just recently I prayed for a little girl sitting in a wheelchair and I felt her feet unold in my hands I took a baby by a throat had a huge huge tumor on the throat and I felt that tumor literally dissolv in my hand Hallelujah prayed for a girl that's supposed to die in a matter of a couple of hours and they were talking about the funeral God sent me there spoke to me to be there and I told her husband after prayer tomorrow she'll walk down the hall the nurse spoke to me and said she's supposed to do it by in hours I said I'm not the one that said it he the the next day she walked down this is the book of Acts this is the book of Acts this is the book of Acts tell your neighbor this is the book of [Applause] Acts hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] brother Doug brother Doug was Sting in a meeting kind like this he's a wonderful man he's a very quiet man he's not the kind of man that would dramatize anything wouldn't want his name called in a meeting like this but he said I saw a light coming at me he said I just relax and I stepped into that light and he literally fell lifeless in the Pew we've got emergency care workers Hospital personel family members begin to check no response none whatsoever I simply stepped to by his neck either we believe it or we don't are you with me are you with me God wants to use your hands he wants to hear your voice he wants to use your faith he wants to live on the throne room of your [Applause] heart I began to call for his life and in a matter of seconds he rolled his head up said yes brother R they checked him they checked him three days at the hospital three days and and and even the doctors and the the the Emergency Care surely something happened but you're in better shape than we are today he's got more energy more Revival than he's ever had in his whole life brother Ron I don't know if that can happen MDC came to the tent and Abraham had to believe who he was Sarah had to come to the realization who she had to catch the Revelation just because Abraham said this has got to be more than Abraham's Revelation this has got to be yours you got to catch it for yourself and the power of the Covenant transform their body and the power of this Mighty angel will transform your body hallelujah hallelujah he's here tonight to set you free from every jail house every Power Of Darkness every diabolic disease say I've never seen a miracle how many could say I I've never personally seen a miracle would raise your hand brother this is unchoreographed I want you to run your hand up and down my back up and down yeah like this yeah every vertebrae was cracked ver they said I'd never walk again and you heard last night it's more than a story it's a reality Hallelujah I laid in the hospital I had two strokes one stroke I one stroke I laid there eight days and I couldn't stand the light to be on in the room a light drove me literally nuts on the eighth day I was in prayer in the middle of the night and what brother George just sung just a few moments ago Jesus came the nurse walked in she had a she had a little flashlight and she was going to check my vitals and she had was the first time on duty with me now I'm finishing and she says Mr Spencer are you awake yes ma'am she said Mr Spencer was you praying I said yes ma'am she said I I've heard from the other nurses of who you are and she said I've always wanted to be a Christian all my life and she said when I open the door I felt the presence I've never felt in my life I let her to Jesus Christ and from that moment on every symptom of that stroke left God is determined will you give me one more minute God laid it on brother colen Brenner's heart this came at Great cost this this came at great strength his family his church put phenomenal effort into this but it was God that directed this meeting it was God that has directed these services I would say we should become aware we're in the moment we're in the moment and it's bigger than a man I'm not here to entertain you I left a family under great duress because I felt absolutely directed God be in this meeting to stand in this moment and to tell you this is God's doing and to the one that might question you and to one that might criticize you I want you to put these words in your mouth this [Applause] do we as ministers could have been a lot of different places we left our own home churches that we love with all of our life but God put something in here to be here for you the girl that I prayed for right there what was her name uh Beth London London the sister from London brother Doug's Church who sung a song who sung a special yes April this okay she sat at my breakfast table this morning probably 15 seats down she never looked my way brother bis God put her on my heart I don't know her I don't think of up until after the service this morning I've even shook your hand God puts put that on my heart something for her brother Thompson Thomson I went to my room I got on my knees and I said God you've got something for that girl I ask you to take brother Thomson lip I know you were praying these same kind of things and he spoke on this man we want you to meet more than this man we want you to meet that on that floor I had the privilege of praying with brother Tim PR and other preachers pray that was orchestrated by God and God's mindful of you ail April next week next month next year time last 10 years from now you remind God that God met you at this place [Applause] at home brother Tim Camp he's got a grandson his name's Andrew I know he's done told the story I'm sure you told the story healed had the privilege of watching that little boy I'm a nobody and we realize as ministers true Ministers of God if God gives you a vision and don't come to pass you're a false prophet and to go get that lion Spirit off of you I was standing in the prayer line standing
