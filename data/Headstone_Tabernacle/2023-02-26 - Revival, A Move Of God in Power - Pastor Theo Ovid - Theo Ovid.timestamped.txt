[36:38] this morning and we know that something
[36:40] is moving father we know that your
[36:42] spirit is moving and you're going to
[36:44] trouble the waters
[36:45] that winning on the blow again just as
[36:48] the day of Pentecost father when you

[36:53] spread upon your people revive them
[36:55] revive us quickness to your promised
[36:57] word in Jesus name we ask it God bless
[36:59] you and before you take your seats I
[37:01] like it turned to the Bible to send to
[37:03] Judges chapter 16
[37:05] I want to read verse 20 to 30 from
[37:08] Judges chapter 16.
[37:14] and this is the ending
[37:16] of Delilah's run where Samson was
[37:19] concerned
[37:21] so after he was lying and playing games
[37:23] words with Delilah verse 27 she said the
[37:27] Philistines be upon thee Samson
[37:29] and he woke out of his sleep
[37:31] and said he will go out as at other
[37:34] times before and shake myself
[37:37] and he wished not that the Lord
[37:40] had departed from him
[37:42] you missed that he missed he
[37:45] misunderstood the anointing and the
[37:47] presence and power because he was
[37:49] covenanted
[37:50] and even though he thought it was going
[37:52] to be business as usual it wasn't
[37:54] business as usual because he broke that
[37:56] Covenant he broke that power that was
[37:59] resident That was supposed to be with
[38:01] him he was 21 and the Philistines took
[38:03] him and put out his eyes and brought him
[38:05] down to Giza and bound him with fetus of
[38:08] brass and he did grind in a prison house
[38:10] albeit the heel of his head began to
[38:14] grow again after he was shiven and the
[38:17] lord of the Philistines gathered him
[38:18] together for to offer great sacrifice to
[38:20] Dagon the god to Rejoice for they said
[38:23] our God has delivered something our
[38:25] enemy into our hand and when the people
[38:28] saw him they praised their God for they
[38:31] said our God had delivered into our
[38:33] hands or enemy The Destroyer of our
[38:35] country which through many of us
[38:38] we came to pass when their hearts were
[38:39] Mary but they said call for something
[38:42] that he may make us support
[38:44] they're looking for entertainment now
[38:46] they call for Samson out of the prison
[38:48] house he made them Sport and he made
[38:51] them support and they set him between
[38:53] the pillars and Samson said unto the lad
[38:56] that held him by their hand suffer me
[38:58] that I may feel the pillars they were
[39:01] upon the house standard that I may lean
[39:03] upon them now the house was full of men
[39:06] and women and all the laws of the
[39:08] Philistines were dear and they were
[39:09] above the roof about three thousand men
[39:11] women that beheld why Samson made Sport
[39:13] and Samson called unto the Lord and said
[39:16] oh Lord God remember me I pray thee and
[39:19] strength me I pray thee only this once
[39:22] oh God that I may be at once avenge of
[39:25] the Philistines of my two eyes and
[39:27] Samson took a whole of the two middle
[39:28] pillars upon which a house stood and on
[39:31] which it was born up of the one with the
[39:33] right hand and the other with his left
[39:35] and Samson said let me die with the
[39:37] Philistines and he bowed himself with
[39:40] all his might and the house fell upon
[39:42] the Lords upon the people that were
[39:44] therein so the dead which he saw what is
[39:46] that well more than which he slew in his
[39:49] life may God bless his word you may be
[39:51] seated oh praise the name of the Lord
[39:53] but we thank God to be here this morning
[39:56] who praise God praise God we thank God
[39:59] for the fire we feel in the church we
[40:02] wouldn't come to we didn't come to
[40:03] lecture you we didn't come to just say
[40:05] words to you we come to see the spirit
[40:07] speak expressly we come to see like Paul
[40:10] said it this way I come with to you not
[40:11] with enticing words but man speak but
[40:14] with the words with the power that your
[40:16] faith may not rest and the ability and
[40:17] the study and the knowledge of the man
[40:19] but the power of God so God wants to
[40:21] have your faith in a certain position a
[40:23] certain way praise God a confidence not
[40:26] because you come to this church or who
[40:27] your pastor is that's not what the faith
[40:29] supposed to lie in it's supposed to lie
[40:30] in his power you see we serve a living
[40:32] God it have other gods you know it has a
[40:36] God you know yeah yeah people serve all
[40:37] kind of gods but we serve the Living God
[40:39] and that Living God could speak that
[40:42] Living God could work that Living God do

[53:49] emotion you can have good intentions all
[53:52] these things are fine but we don't need
[53:54] that today
[53:55] we need

[59:22] life of the people and put them back
[59:25] on the right
[59:26] ruled again
[59:33] I want to carry this thought all the way
[59:35] through
[59:36] to let us go to a step further
[59:38] have you ever studied the history of
[59:40] revivals
[59:42] no they will get a thought from now a
[59:45] Revival
[59:46] signifies a move of God in power
[59:51] foreign
[59:55] Revival is what a move
[59:57] of God in power
[1:00:00] and every time God moves Satan is there
[1:00:04] to move also
[1:00:06] it never fails
[1:00:08] in the days of the World Revival and
[1:00:11] most people don't know this the insane
[1:00:13] asylums fill up quickly
[1:00:15] there was a great display of devil power
[1:00:18] to take away the attention from God
[1:00:20] it is written that in Wesley's days the
[1:00:23] people would do most peculiar things
[1:00:25] that were definitely of Satan to try to
[1:00:28] mock the goodness and the power of God
[1:00:31] in Luther's day it is said the miracle
[1:00:33] of his ministry did not lie in the fact
[1:00:35] that he successfully protested the
[1:00:37] Catholic church but the Miracle Lane the
[1:00:39] fact he could and did this song and
[1:00:41] saying amidst the Fanatics that were
[1:00:44] almost filled with and guided by wrong
[1:00:46] spirits
[1:00:47] and if you have been aware this lasting
[1:00:49] Ministry you would have noticed the same
[1:00:51] invasion of false and wicked Spirits it
[1:00:54] has to be that way
[1:00:56] I hope and trust you are spiritual
[1:00:59] minding enough to get that
[1:01:01] it has to be that way
[1:01:04] amen so I read this there's some
[1:01:07] services to Jesus Bloomington and Burma
[1:01:10] talking about he was praying he said
[1:01:12] that searching the light of God with
[1:01:14] social Hearts tonight and if there be
[1:01:16] any unclean thing about us any unbelief
[1:01:19] in God or his word then cleanse us Lord
[1:01:21] from all of that that we might once
[1:01:24] again hear in Illinois see a great trip
[1:01:26] in Revival Lord we pray that he will

[1:01:32] go Statewide and Nationwide Grant here
[1:01:35] in among those people the December to
[1:01:37] get tonight and all these Corporation
[1:01:39] churches that the power of God will be
[1:01:42] so manifested in their midst until they
[1:01:45] will see and take new heart again
[1:01:47] Grant this college Lord that has let us
[1:01:50] have this Auditorium the Revival
[1:01:52] breakout here like in Wheaton and down
[1:01:55] at Asbury and many of the other places
[1:01:58] it will be day and night permittance
[1:02:02] Lord that people will come from the East
[1:02:05] to the West God give them our
[1:02:07] old-fashioned John was a Revival a
[1:02:10] burning Zeal of these young men's heart
[1:02:12] that would leave the college here that
[1:02:15] they might go forth like another Asbury
[1:02:16] and granted father give us thy Grace we
[1:02:20] dedicate Our Lives to thee and the
[1:02:23] services to thee all we ask about
[1:02:25] mentally and physically speak to us
[1:02:26] father we ask in Jesus name amen so but
[1:02:29] Branham actually talk about this we are
[1:02:31] all among the uh the colleges and that
[1:02:33] sort of thing like that he prayed and so
[1:02:34] on so then I pointed out about a few
[1:02:37] things that I observed about it it
[1:02:38] started Suddenly It's called Serenity it
[1:02:40] went viral overnight and you know
[1:02:43] I think the prophet talk about the Holy
[1:02:45] Ghost will go across the world overnight
[1:02:47] things will happen across and you know
[1:02:49] you could wonder why
[1:02:51] and you can still things develop
[1:02:53] um the Catholic church I took the Bible
[1:02:54] from the people and they were preaching
[1:02:56] in Latin and you know saying all this
[1:02:58] stuff and things but Martin Luther who
[1:03:01] wanted pardon and forgiveness he found
[1:03:04] the Bible and then he started read and
[1:03:05] then he got the Joshua by faith and that
[1:03:07] opened the door for the Protestants and
[1:03:09] then when Jordan Wesley came the Germans
[1:03:12] invented the printing press around that
[1:03:14] same time and that's how the Bible gets
[1:03:15] him to print and now God had the
[1:03:18] revivalists to run with the Bibles one
[1:03:21] with the message now because they come
[1:03:23] like had no Bibles had no word no they
[1:03:25] get the word the other Spirit don't know
[1:03:26] so so God had to make man invented press
[1:03:28] no no no God no The Voice coming William
[1:03:31] Branham Malachi 4 in days of the voice
[1:03:33] of the seven Angel so what have man to
[1:03:35] invent the tape recorder to record the
[1:03:37] voice so man have to actually get in
[1:03:40] tune with God's program God no there
[1:03:43] could be a manifestation where I've
[1:03:44] heard not just the voice but I see so
[1:03:46] God make man make video then God make
[1:03:49] man have the and have the internet that
[1:03:51] overnight you can get it right there
[1:03:53] right there right there right there we
[1:03:55] are the final frontier I heard the Bible
[1:03:57] talk about emotion Elijah dead in the
[1:03:59] streets and the whole world will see
[1:04:01] them talking about television and
[1:04:02] everything else so we are right here in
[1:04:04] the frontier praise God he said this
[1:04:06] because usually I was rumors are Wars
[1:04:09] but the end is not yet earthquakes and
[1:04:11] diverse places the end is not yet Nation
[1:04:14] against Nation or not yet but this
[1:04:16] gospel must be preached and then the end
[1:04:18] shall come so this gospel is the most
[1:04:20] important thing
[1:04:21] praise God to our norms and Herald the
[1:04:24] coming of the Lord and the gospel is not
[1:04:26] the word only but in power and
[1:04:28] demonstration oh come on preach back to
[1:04:31] me somebody come on out about the gospel
[1:04:33] is not the word only glory to caught him
[1:04:36] in
[1:04:37] Hallelujah all right
[1:04:40] this has been viral people come from
[1:04:42] everywhere all testify about the
[1:04:45] atmosphere
[1:04:47] our son is spread to other universities
[1:04:48] and what do we know from that because
[1:04:51] remember historically the last great
[1:04:53] Revival of Charlotte and Branham was the
[1:04:55] United States Pentecostal
[1:04:57] right but we never see none in our
[1:04:59] generation in that sense right and
[1:05:01] that's not really what performance what
[1:05:03] we see in there in Asbury but what we
[1:05:05] know is a Revival is possible
[1:05:07] we know Revival is Promised with our
[1:05:10] Revival will go out isn't that right and
[1:05:13] he's a prophecy hanging over us when the
[1:05:15] power of this church Rises
[1:05:17] it will bring the Brethren so there's a
[1:05:19] prophecy hanging over the bright
[1:05:20] churches when the power of this church
[1:05:22] Rises isn't that right brother Brown
[1:05:24] this is important this age started just
[1:05:27] as the 20th century
[1:05:29] as it was to be the age in which the
[1:05:30] true church would return to being the
[1:05:33] bride
[1:05:34] she was at Pentecost
[1:05:36] listen carefully because this still
[1:05:38] applies to know
[1:05:39] this part here
[1:05:41] we know that their mass of necessity be
[1:05:45] a return of dynamic power
[1:05:49] so that's a given so all this talk and
[1:05:52] intellectual mystery talk and long talk
[1:05:53] and forward the talk and information
[1:05:55] explanation it has to have the dynamic
[1:05:57] power
[1:05:58] [Applause]
[1:06:00] do you get that church
[1:06:02] I want us to kneel inside of you you
[1:06:04] know that nobody see there come no
[1:06:06] sticker come and Slick you with some
[1:06:07] kind of yeah I have a mystery here you
[1:06:10] don't know
[1:06:12] tell him tell him I want to know if it's
[1:06:13] Christ
[1:06:15] because Christ is the mystery of God
[1:06:16] revealed
[1:06:17] if it's not Christ I don't want it
[1:06:19] go and sell it somewhere else are you
[1:06:21] buying
[1:06:22] because they're selling something
[1:06:24] let's go
[1:06:25] we know that there are mass of necessity
[1:06:28] be a return of dynamic power
[1:06:31] the Believers sends this in their
[1:06:33] spirits are you sensing
[1:06:36] are you sensing in your spirit
[1:06:38] that's something about the brick
[1:06:40] I ain't talking about Pope Francis
[1:06:42] they've had a job to do all right what
[1:06:46] the believer sends this in their spirits
[1:06:48] and began crying to God for a new
[1:06:50] outpouring such as was in the first
[1:06:53] century
[1:06:54] here we go what seemed to be the answer
[1:06:57] came as many begin to speak in tongues
[1:07:00] and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was
[1:07:03] then believed that this was indeed the
[1:07:06] long-awaited restoration
[1:07:08] it was not and he explained why
[1:07:13] the latter in for the lattering can come
[1:07:15] only after the for marine
[1:07:18] which is the spring or teaching ring the
[1:07:22] lattering then is the Harvest ring
[1:07:24] before I say this way to you for the
[1:07:27] last 40 years
[1:07:28] in this message we have had teaching
[1:07:34] to teaching and false teaching but
[1:07:35] decisionalism
[1:07:37] it's Dictionary what is promised
[1:07:40] is the lettering
[1:07:42] or Dynamics
[1:07:44] or inspiration or the spirit itself
[1:07:49] [Applause]
[1:07:51] to come upon what has been taught
[1:07:55] now you can understand when God told the
[1:07:58] prophet pick up the pen and write the
[1:07:59] Holy Spirit he said the secret is
[1:08:03] the wind
[1:08:05] is in the bright that's a secret
[1:08:08] that means the bride have to have seed
[1:08:09] in her
[1:08:10] and if you have seen in you then only
[1:08:13] the rain
[1:08:15] amen
[1:08:18] Only the Rain could come and manifest
[1:08:21] and bring forth the contents of that
[1:08:23] seed
[1:08:27] you have two C's here they're looking
[1:08:30] similar one is a pumpkin one is a
[1:08:32] watermelon
[1:08:33] I can't tell you difference
[1:08:35] both of them looking similar the only
[1:08:37] way to know what is what bury it
[1:08:40] put you down on the ground watch it with
[1:08:42] water Let It Grow both have Vine both
[1:08:45] our Leaf both have everything but when
[1:08:47] the fruit comes you would notice pumpkin
[1:08:49] and you know what is watermelon well
[1:08:51] everybody hearing the message they are
[1:08:54] books their tips they are this when the
[1:08:56] rain come you will see who will see who
[1:08:59] has church and who is pride
[1:09:03] not the same air Oh Glory to God here
[1:09:06] man could you see now all right
[1:09:08] what
[1:09:09] the lottery in there is the the
[1:09:11] lattering is the Harvest ring the
[1:09:14] Harvest rain is when you have the fruit
[1:09:16] all right
[1:09:17] how could this be the real thing
[1:09:20] when the teaching ring had not come
[1:09:24] the prophet messenger who was sent to
[1:09:28] teach the people until the hearts of the
[1:09:30] children back to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:09:32] had not yet come thus what was thought
[1:09:35] to be the restoration and the final quit
[1:09:37] under the rapture
[1:09:39] aha so there is to be a restoration
[1:09:42] and a final quickening
[1:09:44] onto the Rapture he's also saying that
[1:09:46] to the brother
[1:09:47] there is to be a restoration and a final
[1:09:49] equipment
[1:09:55] onto the rapchat.com and it was a
[1:09:58] mixture
[1:09:59] of unrighteous partaking of spiritual
[1:10:02] blessing and manifested in the Holy
[1:10:04] Ghost as we kept pointing out to you and
[1:10:08] it also was devil power
[1:10:10] as men were under the control of devils
[1:10:13] yet no one seemed to realize it
[1:10:16] then to prove it was not real these
[1:10:19] people even before the second generation
[1:10:21] appeared organized and wrote the
[1:10:23] unscriptural doctrines and build their
[1:10:25] own fences
[1:10:27] now
[1:10:28] he says that's the reason today the
[1:10:30] revivals we're supposed to have we have
[1:10:32] denomination revivals we haven't had a
[1:10:34] real stirring no no no no no no no sir
[1:10:37] don't think we got revivers we haven't
[1:10:39] they've got millions and millions and
[1:10:40] millions of church members but not
[1:10:42] really no way the bride prophecy hasn't
[1:10:46] had a Revival yet
[1:10:48] there's been no Revival there no
[1:10:53] manifestation of God
[1:10:56] to stood upright yet
[1:10:58] we are looking for it
[1:11:02] this is from the third seal
[1:11:04] to teach a March 1963. he said we are
[1:11:08] we are
[1:11:10] that's a nice time than a quote we are
[1:11:13] looking for it what you're talking about
[1:11:15] some bright Revival we are looking for
[1:11:18] it
[1:11:19] it will take
[1:11:22] those seven unknown pandas
[1:11:24] [Applause]
[1:11:24] [Music]
[1:11:26] wake up again
[1:11:28] how much luck Samson had
[1:11:31] seven lost what did they do to Samson
[1:11:32] the maker just share it off but it will
[1:11:35] take
[1:11:37] those seven Thunders
[1:11:39] what happens here after a while those
[1:11:41] Seven Locks

[1:12:07] we could close our service right there
[1:12:10] he will send it
[1:12:14] but I already promised it no I will make
[1:12:17] these promises he promised it
[1:12:19] listen
[1:12:20] [Applause]
[1:12:23] ing
[1:12:38] you see the Bible talk about knowledge
[1:12:40] shall increase
[1:12:42] Bible talk about God are we Daniel the
[1:12:43] book is sealed to the time of the end
[1:12:45] the entire book had to be unsealed but
[1:12:48] the entire book doesn't connect it to
[1:12:49] the bride
[1:12:51] the promises that was unsealed and
[1:12:53] revealed all that for the bride Catholic
[1:12:54] Church that handled it bright Roman and
[1:12:57] and Pope and Los Angeles thinking that's
[1:13:00] what I'm saying in other words

[1:13:43] have made herself ready
[1:13:45] then she had to see something to take up
[1:13:47] she had to see the clothes of the word
[1:13:50] and dress herself and robe herself in
[1:13:53] the clothes of the promised word
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:56] spice got made himself ready
[1:14:00] Hallelujah
[1:14:02] he's talking about the sea what does he
[1:14:04] jump up like that for he said there's a
[1:14:06] Revival
[1:14:07] the same amount of water but he's got a
[1:14:09] Revival what does it do it floats all
[1:14:13] the trash up on the shore we need a
[1:14:16] scoring out once in a while
[1:14:18] God give us a Revival and a sweeping
[1:14:21] Mighty Wind rushes down through the
[1:14:23] church like that and flows all the trash
[1:14:26] out of her God purifies Us by the Holy
[1:14:30] Spirit
[1:14:31] God purifies us
[1:14:34] by the Holy Spirit

[1:14:57] they asked John are you the one he said
[1:14:59] me they want to come in and I'm not even
[1:15:01] worried to lose his shoes he

[1:15:12] people don't want to talk about it it
[1:15:13] has something called fire

[1:15:36] Seven Seals and the Seven Seals and you
[1:15:39] have to know the Mysteries and some Seas
[1:15:41] where the mystery of God come down from

[1:16:01] when man talk in mystery the mystery
[1:16:02] walking in flesh
[1:16:04] man talking about you oh Glory the God
[1:16:07] and the Word was made flesh and fellow
[1:16:09] Mars or can the Lord I shout
[1:16:12] Hallelujah Jesus Jesus was in the Psalms
[1:16:16] Jesus was in the prophets Jesus was in
[1:16:18] the prophecy they're talking about
[1:16:20] Messiah coming but one day Mary conceive
[1:16:23] bring forth the Messiah and when Jesus
[1:16:26] walk on your head it was all the Psalms
[1:16:28] it was all the prophets everything they
[1:16:30] promised I about it was living in front
[1:16:32] of them that's why he come and say the
[1:16:34] spirit is upon me because he had
[1:16:36] anointed me this day the scripture is
[1:16:38] fulfilled oh give the Lord a shout in
[1:16:41] the house
[1:16:46] good morning
[1:16:54] [Applause]
[1:16:56] you wonder why do you need a Revival
[1:16:59] what brings that rough water like that a
[1:17:02] wind coming
[1:17:07] the wind that's roughly water up
[1:17:10] cause the seats are rough up
[1:17:12] and they're taking the trash and hitting
[1:17:14] it against the shot
[1:17:16] this is what he said you know
[1:17:18] he said
[1:17:19] he said that makes a Revival when the
[1:17:24] Holy Ghost comes like a Russian Mighty
[1:17:27] Wind
[1:17:27] it brings a Revival notice on a nice
[1:17:31] preacher nice thoughts and ideas he said
[1:17:34] watch it brings a Revival what did the
[1:17:36] Rival do in the lake every bit of trash
[1:17:39] on the lake was washed out on the bank
[1:17:42] that is what we need a Revival for
[1:17:47] to wash some of the whirly trash
[1:17:50] listen out of the Holy Ghost Church
[1:17:55] [Music]
[1:18:07] [Applause]
[1:18:10] what we need a Revival for
[1:18:13] is to wash some of the worldly trash
[1:18:16] out of the Holy Ghost Church we need a
[1:18:19] Russian Mighty Wind come from heaven
[1:18:22] some of the world international trash is
[1:18:24] brought with it
[1:18:25] he said he said but it's the truth
[1:18:28] he said watch
[1:18:30] that's what the church needs is a
[1:18:32] Revival to shake from all the
[1:18:34] willingness and the things of the world
[1:18:37] and bring back Purity Holiness of God in
[1:18:41] the hearts of the Believers humility
[1:18:44] that's a big one
[1:18:46] that's a big Bond because we have
[1:18:48] encountered so much arrogant proud
[1:18:49] people that's a big one because God
[1:18:52] looking for somebody that the more He
[1:18:54] blesses the more humble becomes because
[1:18:55] usually when God bless people they get
[1:18:57] arrogant they get puffed up two little
[1:18:59] blessing and they head up in the head if
[1:19:01] the rainfall they're drunk
[1:19:05] watch this
[1:19:07] why man assume they don't get a Revival
[1:19:10] once in a while in their Spirit they
[1:19:12] become so carnal
[1:19:14] and so indifferent till they get
[1:19:17] self-styled statue and self-righteous
[1:19:20] brother humble sweet and nice hours
[1:19:21] Sunday go gamer blessing he find this
[1:19:23] you know what I seen
[1:19:25] I
[1:19:27] always
[1:19:30] see things and I see it so you really
[1:19:34] Church move in
[1:19:35] all the time you come you're born inside
[1:19:37] the church moving
[1:19:39] but you know
[1:19:41] I was among some friends and you know he
[1:19:42] was talking critical critical theory
[1:19:45] critical thinking
[1:19:48] you better go and flush it down later
[1:19:50] you better begin to believe the word and
[1:19:52] say Yes Amen to the world you know stop
[1:19:54] being a critical thinking yeah just let
[1:19:56] your mind just get away from that and
[1:19:58] say God you said it I believe it that's
[1:20:00] it have to come to pass this is what
[1:20:01] they promised
[1:20:03] [Applause]
[1:20:05] self-righteous
[1:20:07] and if you think brother make a Mystic
[1:20:09] but those words here this next statement
[1:20:12] they read and study
[1:20:16] and that's good
[1:20:18] talking about
[1:20:20] yeah the books the other tips not good
[1:20:23] the person play but I know what we're
[1:20:25] talking about read and study that's not
[1:20:27] what you're talking about
[1:20:28] he said it's good to know the word but
[1:20:30] it's better to know the order of the
[1:20:31] word
[1:20:37] you ever say no
[1:20:39] then he going deeper
[1:20:42] that little something that you leave out
[1:20:45] that's something in the heart
[1:20:47] that makes you what you are
[1:20:50] that's the thing
[1:20:52] and that's the thing that I like about
[1:20:54] having a Revival it shakes it jumps it
[1:20:57] jerks it around until all the drops get
[1:20:59] out
[1:21:01] and that's what a Revival have people
[1:21:03] talk about the heart being cleansed the
[1:21:04] bitten is coming out and I hear
[1:21:06] testimonies and different things from
[1:21:07] even what in Asbury right now young
[1:21:09] people and you know young people they
[1:21:11] they hardly get a younger person that is
[1:21:13] very hypocritical they're very straight
[1:21:15] they open they say the thing they weighs
[1:21:19] and whatnot the big people they could do
[1:21:21] Hollywood they could act they could
[1:21:23] perform and they could nothing on there
[1:21:24] and pretend and all kind of thing but
[1:21:26] young people have to pretend about this
[1:21:27] is it this is it this is really to them
[1:21:29] and if it's really real to them getting
[1:21:31] through something real amen I don't mind
[1:21:34] I think every time I'm talking about the
[1:21:36] guy I see outside in the park somewhere
[1:21:37] telling some people have you received
[1:21:39] the Holy Ghost since you believe that
[1:21:40] was such a blessing to me to hear that
[1:21:41] outside but you know allow me said I'm
[1:21:43] outside preaching very hungry have you
[1:21:45] received the Holy Ghost telling since
[1:21:46] you believe how God said it and bow your
[1:21:49] heads and close your eyes if they want
[1:21:50] to receive the Holy Ghost hope glory to
[1:21:52] God come and let me lay hands upon you
[1:21:54] oh God I was like music to my soul

[1:23:25] what God will see and deal with their
[1:23:26] own hearts I can't judge all the

[1:38:10] that's right all right let me see about
[1:38:12] the wrap up here now
[1:38:15] he said no watch something and I want to
[1:38:17] say this that our great move the Church
[1:38:19] of the Living God in this nation has
[1:38:21] become a two factions one of them is
[1:38:23] going so stiff and starchy and
[1:38:25] intellectual and the other one went Plum
[1:38:28] off deep end on the other side
[1:38:31] fanatic
[1:38:33] so I'm going flying over loose he said
[1:38:36] but there's a middle way
[1:38:38] it's a middle ground church I want you
[1:38:40] on that middle ground
[1:38:44] almost done
[1:38:45] now a minister kind of being a Revival
[1:38:48] there's no preach can bring a Revival he
[1:38:50] doesn't pack it with him the only thing
[1:38:52] he can do is just be as loyal to God and
[1:38:55] his word and the Revival has to come by
[1:38:57] the people
[1:38:58] in your home in your life now Revival
[1:39:02] isn't adding new members it's Reviving
[1:39:04] what we've already got
[1:39:07] so Revival is to revive what's inside of
[1:39:09] you when you first come to the Lord you
[1:39:12] have a hungry for God a passion for God
[1:39:14] a love for God people and whatnot when I
[1:39:16] get in trouble in my early Christian
[1:39:17] walk I say Lord and I see God deliver me
[1:39:19] and bring me out well anytime I get
[1:39:21] something else I say Lord deliver me in
[1:39:22] that one you have to leave me in this
[1:39:23] one and it's a wonder how we get to me
[1:39:25] after this one now and every time you
[1:39:27] ever see God giving a breakthrough after
[1:39:28] breakthrough he's teaching you he is
[1:39:31] guiding you he is leading you you know
[1:39:33] God was with you
[1:39:34] [Applause]
[1:39:36] now you're doing like if that never
[1:39:38] happened
[1:39:39] my Lord
[1:39:42] okay let's go he said no what we've seen
[1:39:45] happen
[1:39:46] should put every soul in action
[1:39:49] prophecy coming here now
[1:39:51] it should make a church
[1:39:53] that would make a Revival here in
[1:39:55] Phoenix
[1:39:56] that people would be flying from Europe
[1:39:59] to see what they can place so what is he
[1:40:01] saying a re-revival people are flying

[1:40:08] each you know a reviver
[1:40:10] break out
[1:40:12] no people take a plane to come to that
[1:40:14] that's the power of God they're talking
[1:40:16] about
[1:40:17] that's cancer being healed
[1:40:19] coming out of the wheelchair that is
[1:40:20] deaf hearing blind cm
[1:40:22] oh Chloe that's the move of God that is
[1:40:25] tongues interpretation that is prophecy

[1:40:29] church before we leave here

[1:44:16] covenant if he can lie and get away with

[1:44:25] seated
[1:44:26] [Applause]

[1:44:30] [Applause]
[1:44:35] what Abraham says
[1:44:37] what's going to happen
[1:44:39] there's one glorious thing that I can
[1:44:41] take off the end this text
[1:44:43] while Samson was born
[1:44:48] he said we can't have a Revival listen
[1:44:50] at our loyal brother Billy Graham
[1:44:52] Reviving all day listen to all robots
[1:44:54] revive another day listen the rest of
[1:44:55] them we find all day how can we have a
[1:44:57] Revival when we are born
[1:45:00] we have bung the Holy Ghost with our
[1:45:02] organization and traditions
[1:45:05] remember what he said the Holy Ghost was
[1:45:07] born
[1:45:08] at the river Euphrates
[1:45:10] trapped by interpretation in them the
[1:45:12] Holy Ghost can move because they run
[1:45:15] their own electric wire
[1:45:19] and when the Holy Ghost looking for room
[1:45:20] to move
[1:45:22] who do this Plumbing
[1:45:26] because the word
[1:45:28] is the conduct of the spirit
[1:45:36] and they look real nice and pretty for
[1:45:38] the church
[1:45:39] Holy Ghost can move
[1:45:41] because the word
[1:45:43] don't forget that is the conductor of
[1:45:44] the spirit
[1:45:45] that's why when man of God through
[1:45:48] faithful Ministry becomes the word they
[1:45:51] become the contractor of the spirit and
[1:45:54] God will say there is my spirit flowing
[1:45:56] freely man who have died out Man Who
[1:46:00] Sold out to everything else until
[1:46:02] themselves become a conductor
[1:46:04] imagine
[1:46:08] so when when Once Whenever there is
[1:46:11] man's idea in it holy ghost is trapped
[1:46:14] for the ghost can't move until you get
[1:46:17] back to the wood again oh Hallelujah are
[1:46:19] you with me all right now watch he says
[1:46:22] we are born the Holy Spirit without
[1:46:24] organization and traditions and we can't
[1:46:26] have a holy ghost Revival I know that is
[1:46:28] scorching
[1:46:30] hot with the weather but it's the truth
[1:46:32] how can we have a holy ghost Revival
[1:46:35] when you are born and starchy
[1:46:38] form of goodness in the messaging his
[1:46:41] baptism but just be talking about it we
[1:46:43] don't want message folks
[1:46:44] making sure that it's clear I ain't
[1:46:46] talking about this Methodist Saints
[1:46:54] having a form of godliness will deny the
[1:46:56] power of the power of what the power of
[1:46:59] organization no the power of the world
[1:47:01] the power of the church the power of the
[1:47:02] Holy Ghost
[1:47:03] that's the secret place in the church
[1:47:08] the Holy Ghost is the
[1:47:10] secret place in the church and when the
[1:47:13] church adopts educated preachers big
[1:47:16] buildings finally instead of the
[1:47:18] old-fashioned Holy Ghost they'll be
[1:47:19] better off in a mission again how are
[1:47:21] you gonna revive in the Holy Ghost and
[1:47:23] people quench it
[1:47:24] and bung it and afraid of it
[1:47:27] Philistines Dundee
[1:47:29] but the one blessed hope we have
[1:47:31] while Samson was in jail
[1:47:34] what's the first thing they've done when
[1:47:35] they caught him they bung him fools they
[1:47:38] took his power away they found a secret
[1:47:40] they found your secret the world found
[1:47:44] your secret now you women all Bob you're
[1:47:46] here goes the world you men go out and
