hear you I can't hear you blessed be the name of the Lord God bless you Saints you may be seated greet you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ want to say what a great privilege it is to be here behalf of my wife and the family my son Luke Caleb and their wives and their children are here and the one of the deacons and his wife is here Luke also we greet the convention in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ uh and from the church back home we bring greetings we want to thank brother Colin Brena for this invitation and I must say I salute you for the faith that you had to call this meetings together and many many times uh God told Moses call the congregation together I want to speak to them and I believe this was a calling together for God to speak to us and I believe that this meetings I speak for myself uh this was a a real uh blessing and I believe uh we are all challenged by these meetings and what was said in what was preached and what we heard we each one going back home I'm speaking for myself ch challenged by the word that was preached and what was said so thank you brother zigma we appreciate you your wife and your family and your church uh and everyone that has contributed to these meetings may God richly bless you and uh want to greet all the ministers and their families their wives the churches that has come uh God richly bless you and it's good to see you we met some new friends some new ministers and it's always good uh and uh I told brother Ron when I met him I heard about him but now I've seen and you heard about brother Kenny I heard but now I see and different ones that you met you heard about them but brother Tim pro I heard about him but now I've seen him so it sort of makes a difference once you meet them and you get to hear them and you begin to feel their the the spirit you know and uh that was so good for me and then to hear brother bcll and all the iwitness my met brother bis many years back I wasn't married then and uh so heard about him watched a few of his testimonies on YouTube and so forth and then see the great things he's done uh God has entrusted him with uh and then uh brother George Smith do I need the whistle God bless you I was privileged to have his son in our home we came to South Africa hunting and we could uh serve him and minister to him so what blessing so what I realized I was in the room at the back there and I was saying Lord wow you know God says that each man has his place and God placed us all differently and uh I might not be able to do what brother bcll or brother George or different ones he doing but wherever you are God placed you there and and God has a work for you there and uh I might not have seen the prophet or been there but whatever I read here in the spoken word is it's for me it's for you whatever you find in your every promise you that's for you and uh as brother bis even quot he said or I think was brother Kenny said blessed are you who has not seen and yet you believe so there's almost you you are just blessed by believing though you never saw the prophet you never had contact you didn't have that privilege God had that privilege for brother Bisal and different ones and they can relate what they seen and it's so real and it's so so so tangible when they relate it you you feel the anointing because this man was there and he brings it all the way here and you feel that this is real so we appreciate that it's not in vain God had them there for that purpose but now brother we living in our time too each and every one of us has a testimony about this message every one of us has got the place that we have to fulfill I might not do what brother Ed can do but you can do something there where you living in your corner I I thought bright in the corner where you are woo Hallelujah brother Bisal or brother George can't be in the location where I'm staying but there in my corner I'm brightening it up brother I'm shining for the message I'm standing for the message I'm preaching the message why that's where God placed me woo I can't do if I must try to be like brother Ed I'm going to fail but there where God put me I'm going to be a blessing there where God put you you're going to be a blessing Hallelujah so don't feel because you didn't see the prophet you are nothing no this message came for you this message came for me this message is alive this message is real real woo Hallelujah brother every time I read it it blesses me I'm passionate about [Applause] it brother BR says when Joshua when Joshua placed them in the land he says Ephraim over there manessa over there and Judah over there he says and if God put plac you to raise corn you you raise corn and if God plac you there to to raise uh Millies or whatever it is you stay there and you do that each one of us has got something to do but the promise is when I see the corn is there so I want to go raise no you were not you were not placed to raise the corn do what you must do wherever you are Hallelujah and man I want to give a testimony I told the church back home for this whole year I've been speaking to the young people I said man get away from the idleness do something for Jesus I says this message man you don't have to just sit at home you don't have to wait for me to get you anointed I says I was a young man I got saved at 16 years old 1967 I got the message Oho Hallelujah there was no churches in our area and brother I I got this message as a young man and I begin uh my wife's brother uh and myself and different ones we begin to say uh

there was something come down there was something happened brother there's something happening and I want to tell you by the grace of God for for almost 5050 years we play a tape every Saturday night woo Hallelujah keeping the voice of Elijah alive trying to give it out and you and I want to say this man uh one of the families in the church bought a car they didn't have someone to drive them and and they drove down to kimbery it's a place about 4 hours away from Johannesburg but something says take a take a pile of spoken words with you and I took a pile and I got there and I got to meet the family there and I met a young man and and he speaks Africans I speak English and we were battling so I said listen man I brought something for you and I gave him the stack of books he was a sinner I went back to Johannesburg he says he took the books and he read and he just chucked it on the Wardrobe he says but there where he was working there was some Pentecostal men working on him and he says one day it struck him those books are there he says he took the books off the Wardrobe he took it to the work and he gave it to them and he says you know what happened they seen the message they said where did you get those books there something in here that we don't have woo Hallelujah they they they wrote to me they came all the way up to Johannesburg we baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and there's the church in kimbery this message Works Hallelujah this message Works uh you know in the old days we were brought up that if someone of the elderly people sent you to shop you know to go to the cafeteria to buy them something it might be the neighbor it might be you were taught as a young man to do it so before I got saved the neighbor ladies will call you and says send me to shop to go buy them cigarettes you were brought up that way you go you go buy the cigarettes you take it back and all different neighbors there right around the home so yeah I get saved now so the same lady calls me she says go buy me cigarettes oh God that's why young people tell take your stand man take your stand don't compromise to be recognized woo you don't need to compromise you

played to them thinking man's filter and I had them all sitting with the book some was falling asleep but I felt so good Oh Glory to God hallelujah I took my stand whether they believe it or not but I knew I took my stand it's worth it young people it's worth it to serve God it's worth it to to live for him you might be going through some hard time but I tell you this God that we serve you're going to see he's not like other men he'll change your life he'll fill you with the Holy Ghost he'll give you the desires of your heart he'll pull you from a a life that's down and low he can raise you up

crushed and we prayed we said Lord we need for you to come on the scene here this is desperation this is a life of a child and as we prayed brother all of a sudden life came back and and just the movement of the body gave us hope but now the body went into shock and we rushed to the ICU and got it to the doctors and when they seen it they said oh it's hopeless they put all the machines on and the screen was going and you saw the little light and there we in the hospital the Church Believers came we were kneeling in the water the nurses couldn't understand the doctors couldn't understand

trusting for God to fill her with the Holy Ghost God is alive can we give him praise this is just as real as when the Prophet was here I seen it I know it and I know it will work for you my God bless you thank you for listening can we stand to our feet so thank you for all the ministers and that has ministered and stood in the Gap and I like to say wherever you stand in minister in your own way God bless you God placed you there in that little spot and I always said wherever you are rich out in your area you can influence you don't have to be all over the world but you can be somewhere and you can be effective I told the young people don't just be so lazy don't sit back do something and I I begin to tell them what I did as a young man I didn't have to consult any anyone but every lunchtime I'll go out and give books I'll make sure I do something I kept myself busy took me 6 months to read the church ages but I read it took me another 6 months to read the seals but I read it that's why it's important to read the spoken so when the minister and Pastor comes and preach you know what he's saying you don't sit there and wonder what is that you read it the seed is already in your heart but our young people don't read we on WhatsApp and Facebook but we don't read the spoken word right and I begin to tell the young people and uh I had meetings with them and trying to get them you know anointed and try my best whatever I can and and then one of our young married uh guys went down to Durban South Africa 6 hours away from Johannesburg even and his wife went on a holiday and uh he just come under out what I told him and he he got there and he says they want some holiday some little competition and the guy the driver was driving them to the office where they have to sign a little boat trip on the ocean and his wife went up in the office so he said all of a sudden he thought what I told him and he he's sitting with a driver and he begin to witness to the driver about Jesus Christ that he sent a prophet and the message wow this guy was so convicted he said what must I do and and his name is Joshua Joshua said well there's the ocean I can go down and baptize you right now you speak of a book of Acts wo Hallelujah brother this book is in operation all across the world there's another book of Acts been written if you must hear every other Minister's testimony we'll be surprised to hear what the Lord is doing in each country in each place in each real Corner how the holy spirit is moving so he got and he told him the man said but I don't have any clothes he said but I promise you tomorrow at 7:00 I'll be at your hotel says well it's up to you brother he says the next morning at 7: yeah the phone rings I'm downstairs I've got my clothes I'm ready to be baptized he says he jumped up there he took the man to the ocean baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah and gave him the voice of God's number in Duran and that man is serving the lord what just like the Uno brother God will use you where you are that sounds like the book of Acts to me if you have your Bible just three short portions of scripture Ephesians chapter 1 Glory man I feel good man I feel good I know the God we serve is alive verse four according as he has chosen Us in before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace when Heath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through the blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his glory Revelations 5 just verse three and no man in Heaven Nor in the earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and then my scripture I'm going to preach on Hebrews 10 from verse one for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never were those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect verse 11 and every preach standeth daily ministering and offering offerings often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man Hallelujah that's my title this morning but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down at the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are Sanctified may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so my title this morning is but this man somehow the Bible year in Hebrews distinguish him from other men many men died before that but he never said those words about them but this man Hallelujah and I want to read something here especially to the young people this is the last day brother cap said there's was three more meetings left and if you didn't have a chance he has still two meetings left to get your blessing brother brandham here in the prayer line is Discerning somebody and he says somebody was just healed it was a man but it wasn't this one the spirit's on the man sir you know standing by me wouldn't make you feel like that isn't it wonderful I wish the audience but he speaking to the man and then the man responds listen to this and you going to say why it's so important to respond you can't just sit there and do nothing you have to respond you know when the preacher preaches this message he's preaching Vindicated word you have to respond you can't sit back and say that's good you must say that's me that's speaking to me so it says if you can listen to the tape the brother said it's God thank you sir the prophet says you shall receive God's reward yes the Lord God bless you sir I'm a stranger to you are suffering so with a tremendous nervous condition the nervous condition caused from a slip vertebrae in your back and it's

the Bible says in the Old Testament on the day of atonement when the high priest had to take the sacrifice and go into the holy of holies once a year to cover the sins of Israel for one year and every year he has to do the same thing over and every year and every year he has to come back and repeat the same thing but they say this was such a such a time of desperation that the high priest had to be dressed a certain way he couldn't just go in there anyway he had to be Anointed with a anointed oil of the Rose of Sharon that ran all the way down and he had to have a certain gown on and at the bottom of the Gown there was pomegranates and bells so that when he walked into the holy of holies and he had a blood of the sacrifice and they say all Israel will stand there outside the temple there was like a holy us they didn't know what's going to happen will God forgive them and as he walks brother says he walks past the outer court with the Brazen uh that prison vases and he walks past and he walks past the golden candlesticks but now he's coming to the holy of holies now he's entering a very sacred place and he he starts dipping his hand into the bowel of blood and the Bible says he had to sprinkle seven times towards the east he couldn't go in there without blood oh brother and the bells are making a noise and brother and say as it's making a noise it's saying holy holy unto our God holy holy and he sprinkle in the blood and he sprinkle in the blood and he sprinkle in the blood seven times oh brother man say he spoke of the seven Church ages that there'll be blood in seven Church ages and then blood for this age brother and that's why we standing on the word of God there's a blood for this age and you need to find that blood woo Hallelujah old brother and he would stand there and do his thing but outside there was a holy Ash and as long as they heard the bells they knew he was still alive oh Legend said that they would tie a rope around him they say not they don't show because in case he die how would they get him out there cuz no man can go in there so Legend says they tied a rope around him and if he died they could pull him out W Hallelujah come on brother sister and then there he was and all Israel waiting and when the curtain comes out and he comes walking out do you think they sit still brother they say all Israel Shout he came out alive and they said our Jehovah has forgiven us for one more year they were happy over but this man this man by one sacrifice he has forever forever forever forever perfected them that are [Applause] Sanctified if

screaming so loud I couldn't take it says I walked out he says if she don't do it I can't preach so if you don't worship I can't preach something must come back from you you must give the preacher something something to preach and when you start giving him something you pull on the Holy Spirit down comes the Holy Spirit anoints him to say something for you for somebody why because you pulling on the Holy Ghost we don't see a man we see Christ this message came to introduce Christ this message speaks about this man it comes back to this man the the new the Old Testament ended what with Jesus John introducing Jesus then he said I must go off the scene and he must increase now we come to the end of the Old Testament we had our John he introduced us to who to Jesus Christ and he said now I must go on the scene he must come on the scene so who's on the scene it's not a man it's Jesus Christ we must decrease get of the sin so he can increase GL GL my and they said when that high priest came out he says Israel went in a raw they'll Scream and Shout God praise Jehovah because they save for one more year but the Bible say but this man oh I love those three words but this man no other man this man after he had offered the sacrifice for sin Forever by one offering he had perfected forever them that are Sanctified so I'd like to quickly just go for 10 minutes to the Garden of Gethsemane he says our dear Lord himself in the world's B greatest Battleground Gethsemane he cried out in despair should I take the sins of the world or should I remain on Earth with his beloved disciples that's what he wanted to do notice and the Bible says in Luke he went a little further he told the disciples you pray but he went further and I think that's what we got to do we got to go further not just stay here by our normal uh surroundings we got to go further and he says here he went a little further how more ought you and I to go a little further the scripture says here in Luke that he prayed earnestly brother sister Jesus had to pray earnestly how much more have we got to pray earnestly if Christ the god of Heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly then how much more are we Sinners saved by grace to pray earnestly if the decision throw the Son of God into despair what will it do to you and I desperately we need to cry out the Son of God spent so much time in prayer if Jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more do you and I have to spend in prayer much prayer and that was Brothers sigma's desire to come here pray it up pray at a prayer room because the hour is upon us it's it's not we're not pointing to something we say it's here so Jesus had to make a decision will I take the sins of the world and before going to Calvary the the father brought his own son into a conference in Gethsemane while Angels took their positions to see what his decision would be oh my god oh it might not have been this way but let's think maybe it was I can hear him say son do you desire to go to Calvary there's a band waiting for you but there's persecution there's death and murder laying in the way there's exposure of your own body they'll strip your clothes off you they'll beat you into a pulp they'll pull the crown of thorns over your head and you'll be screaming for Mercy should you go on with this decision he says he was saying in Gethsemane the greatest suffering of the son of every man would be upon him can you take can you the holy Son of God take the sin of adultery can you take the sin and the punishment of adultery can you take the sin in the punishment of a lie can you take the sin in the punishment of all things can you bear them upon yourself yet innocent Christ had to make a decision they're going to beat you they're going to hit you with first they're going to knock you with a stick over your head they're going to beat you into a pulp your back is going to look like a plow field are you willing to take the sin of adultery and fornication and lies and Malice and hate are you willing to take that so Christ had to make a decision brother says the greatest Battleground in get salmony he says you're going to die alone there'll be nobody with you they're going to beat you to a PP they're going to strip you naked are you willing to take the sins of the world upon you he had to make a decision and then he he said father uh when he realized as a man he says is it not possible that this cup can pass me isn't there a way out the flesh begin to realize that this is going to be heavy and he said isn't there way I can bypass this and Jesus oh I love this when he looked into the father's face the decision was lan with him and you know what he said then he made a decision he said nevertheless not my will but thine be done woo Hallelujah he made a decision nevertheless I want to stay with my disciples I want to be in Fellowship but nevertheless not my will but thine be done the decision anchored and swept the world and still comes today to every penitent Soul not my will but thine be done he made the decision hallelujah oh God then he says man for this cause came I into the world this is the reason I'm in the world was to take the son of the world was to take your punishment in mine I came for this reason when I healed the lapis that was by the way when I raised the death that was but my goal was to go to Calvary woo nevertheless for this cause came I into the world this is the reason I'm here he says I will go and he made the decision and they nailed him to the Cross this man made the decision for you and me we had to go to hell we had to die I we were sent away to judgment but you know what God emptied out all the arrows shut it upon him every sin of adultery every sin of fornication every sin of malage and lies every everything you were going to do wrong he took the punishment he took your punishment he took mine and the process you know all this time when he had to make this decision he had you and me on his mind he said if I don't go raymon is going to fail if I don't go Ed is going to fail if I don't go if I don't make this decision they won't make it Satan will have something against them but this man by his sacrifice has forever perfected them that are sanctified them that are clean then that are saved them that are born again no more can the enemy accuse you because there's a blood sacrifice every time you do something wrong you go on your knees and you confess it the blood S as a bumper not guilty come on backslider come back to Christ there's a blood sacrifice not guilty not guilty but he did this not guilty she did that not guilty I know him I know him not guilty come on Satan not guilty those people

again all those that are washing the blood of Jesus Christ [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah brother B says that day on Calvary took care of the sin question he broke the backbone of Satan and he made it possible for you and I to live for others forever he can't he can't smear you no more cuz there's a blood sacrifice oh he took care of the sin question forever he broke the backbone of Satan now we can live for for others and eternal life is living for others okay I'm going to preach on this man quickly now so bear with me they say if Shakespeare walked into an audience all the people would

looks down he don't see you he sees Christ he looks at his Perfection I can never be be perfect and you can never be perfect in in each other's eyes will never be perfect but when this man looks down he don't see you he don't see how many times you fell and how many times you made a mistake but this is the perfect sacrifice that was made for you and me that's why I challenge the devil man you cannot keep us away from God we might fall but you're going to get up again you might be in a backsliding state but God is coming after you there in the room there where you watching right now the presence of God will go after you this man left everyone his disciples and he went across the ocean to gadara for one man this is this man man he's not interested in the crowds he went for one soul

the ways through the the Unseen World into Paradise and I heard Lazarus come forth and I told him that's him that's his voice I know that voice it was the voice of the Resurrection listen man that voice was so powerful he had to single out Lazarus because if he didn't all the dead would have rise but he single out Lazarus and Lazarus say I'll see you and here come a man walking out that was his friends you say brother Raymond it's easy because that's his friends let's ask his enemies what do you say about this man the Rich Young Ruler we call him what do you have to say about this man he says you know what one day I was a religious boy I kept the Commandments I love for God I grew up in the church I kept every commandment but when I stood before this man like brother Bisal and different was saying you knew you were naked this man looked into me and he went past my flesh past my human spirit and he got into the soul and he found one thing I thought I was good he's not looking for good people he's looking for perfect people and he says man you did very well very well but one thing you lack there's one thing go sell all that you have give to the poor I wonder if we stand before him today what will he find in us if you go past our flesh past there ministers what will he find we afraid to preach the seven seal you preaching all everything well but you live out the seven seal you live out the seven Thunders the bride's promise one thing you're doing well but there's it's another promise that's a promise he says but I opened my eyes in hell and I cried but it was too late we call a pilot what do you say about this man he said I found many man guilty in my lifetime and condemn them to death but this man I find no fault in him the soldier at the cross what do you say to this man I pierced his side and the Earth darkened and Shook and I remember saying truly he was the son of God we call up Judas Judas what did you say about this man he said I realized after I betrayed him I betrayed innocent blood that's his enemies what do you say about him this morning what is your testimony can you say this man changed my life this man delivered me from the things of the world can you say that he he he made me whole and he changed my life and and and he came to me when nobody oh god brother bisc he came to me when no one else when I couldn't go I couldn't go to him but he came to me thinkk of it this morning you couldn't go you couldn't plead your case but he came to you oh I love this man oh glory to God they say about Caiaphas the high priest one day I sent out my soldiers to arrest this man and they came back they didn't have him and I asked why didn't you rest him he says when we got there this man was preaching and Christ said all ye that are burdened and heavy laden come onto me and I will give you rest they said we could not arrest him because they were burdened and heavy laden and they returned back and The KES why didn't you arrest him they said we heard many of man speak but this man never heard we a man speak like this man oh God you know once he speaks to your heart there something changes and I can hear him in this meeting pleading speaking telling you once more there's a chance Hear My Call heed My Cry respond don't leave the convention B says every service we come to we either go out worse or we go out better this convention you might live worse and you'll go home and you'll become worse because you didn't respond to the call of God but I can assure you if you hear his voice you'll be changed your pastor will admire you he'll salute you he'll be glad because there's a change in your life young man if there's going to be Revival in your church say Lord start with me make me that Revival I'm not waiting for anyone to preach me happy I want to be happy I want to walk in the church happy I want to walk in the church delivered I want to walk into the church free they say this man was made a living Soul the first man but this man the second Adam was made a quickening spirit they say in Matthew 8:27 when Jesus was asleep on the boat Oh Glory to God I love this and he says the boat was in trouble and the disciples said Lord they woke him up and they said carest thou not that we perish and and and he woke out of the Sleep uh and he went and and the Bible says he put his foot on the brow and he looked at those waves and the wind and they he said peace be still and the Bible says there came a great calm the winds went back and the calm and the disciples said Hallelujah they marveled saying one to another what manner of man is this that the winds and the waves of what manner of man is this that can ins still the storm in your life that can bring peace to your soul to you young man that you you you craving for drugs and alcohol and and and you find out it's penetrated your life this man can PE speak peace he can speak Deliverance he can uproot that that crave and hunger for the world he can pull it out of you this man not your pastor you can't do it he preaches the word and and he's a watcher of your soul but this man when he speaks to you he can change your life he can pull you from the lowest to the highest he can pull you from the guts he can take that out of your life that worldly music that worldly fashion he can change it this [Applause] man yes a hard one now they call the woman in in adultery right John 8 and they called them wi adultery and there was many men they came and told Jesus according to the law you see they knew the quotes and the scriptures and the law but they only knew it by intellect yeah was the manifested word this man was the manifested word he stood there and they came then he said listen according to the law of Moses this woman must be stoned what do you have to say oh well other men was accusing her but this man when he looked at her Oh Glory this man is not like other men other men want to see you down other men want to see you but not this [Applause] man and they all were contaminated but this man he said nothing and and and and he just he said something something and he said he was without sin Let Him cast the first stone and they left and he begin to write on the ground and and they one by one begin to drop their rocks I don't know how many came with rocks to this meeting but I'm sure by now after all the preaching you left your rocks wo Hallelujah I didn't come here to condemn nobody I didn't come here to point your finger I come here to tell you hey we can make it man w we can make it you can be filled you can be sealed you can't be delivered man I didn't come here to say you this and you no I come here to tell you you can make it but brother Raymond I I I do know you can make it I'm yet to say I'm landing the hand come on stand up you can make it oh you can make it brother sister you can make it oh I'm not here here with a negative report I'm here to tell you you can make it I'm not here like those 10

is without sin let him cause the first stone one while on the Rocks begin to drop you see because before this man you can't lie you can't hide and like the eyewitnesses testified when you stood before him you were naked he could see right through you and this is this man that's here he sees right through you he knows what you need they say about the great Napoleon who was a real war or general and okay let me finish the story and and when he rose up he said woman where are thy accusers and she said there is none oh Hallelujah isn't that beautiful they all came with the Rocks according to the word according to the message she has to die and this man just looked up okay well he was without sin cast the first stone and he begin to write when he looked up there was no one says woman where's your accuses he says there's none what was his words but this man said neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more you see this God this man there's no man like him they wanted to die they rather see someone die they rather see someone go back to the world but this man had such compassion brother and such forgiveness he said neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more there's no man like this man they say about the great Napoleon who was a real warlord General and all almost conquered the world but at the at the age of 33 he died in alcoholic and died in disgrace but this man Jesus at the same age conquered everything he conquered Both Worlds this is the only man that can claim he I he is the Prince of Peace he's called wonderful isn't he wonderful oh he changed my life with no one else he changed my life isn't he wonderful you remember when you had nothing in the home and no one and you turned to him and he brought something isn't he wonderful he's he's called counselor he's the Mighty God he's the Everlasting father he's the first and the last he's the Alpha and the Omega he's the beginning and the end and this is the only man I know and one of the brothers mentioned it in order to get a bride you normally just you if you have to pay the doy or whatever you pay that if that's your custom but for him to get a bride he had to die for his bride oh goodness are you willing to die

can you think of this he died so that he could get you marry [Music] [Applause] you this man said destroy the body in 3 days time I will raise it up again only man that could say those words destroy this Temple and within 3 days I will raise it up again this man when he died the Earth shook the Rocks Str apart the sun refused to shine but this man died alone forsaken by man and by God and the temple veil ran from the top to the bottom and I was just reading brother George he was saying the wall was the the curtain was 4 in thick 30 m high he says there's no way a man could get there to R to rent it but it showed that God rented and he died like a man and the Earth Shook and the temple veil was ran from top to bottom showing the mercy it hanging in plain view in other words we don't no

message of Enoch and Noah but this man took the keys from Satan and B says he kicked him back onto the Pavements of hell and he took the keys and he hung it on his side woo Hallelujah and he rose on the third day and he says now because I love you shall live also and because I conquered you shall conquer also because I'm alive you will be alive and he says fear not I have the keys I have the keys
