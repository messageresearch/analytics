[26:20] clouds and thick darkness as the morning
[26:22] spread upon the mountains a great people

[26:27] like neither shall be any more after it

[26:36] the lionesses and garner even before him
[26:38] and behind them a desolate wilderness ye
[26:40] nothing shall escape them the appearance
[26:44] of them is as the appearance of horses
[26:45] and as horsemen so shall they run those
[26:49] of charts and the tops of mountains
[26:50] shall they leap
[26:52] the noise of flame of fire that devoured
[26:54] the stubble as a strong people set in
[26:57] battle array before their face the
[26:59] people shall be much pinned all feces
[27:02] shall gather blackness they shall run
[27:05] like mighty men they shall climb the
[27:07] wall like men of war they shall March
[27:09] everyone on his ways and they shall not
[27:11] break their ranks neither shall one
[27:15] trust another they shall walk everyone
[27:18] in his path and when they fall upon this
[27:20] sword they shall not be wounded they
[27:23] shall run to and fro in the city - I run
[27:26] upon the wall they should climb up upon
[27:28] the houses they shall enter in that
[27:30] windows like a teeth the earth shall
[27:32] quake before them the heaven shall
[27:34] tremble the Sun and the moon shall be
[27:36] dark a star shop shall be draw they
[27:39] shinin and the Lord shall utter his
[27:42] voice before his army for his camp is
[27:45] very great for he is strong and executed
[27:48] his word for the day of the Lord is
[27:50] great and very terrible who can abide it
[27:54] therefore also now said the Lord turning
[27:58] even to me with all your heart with
[28:01] fasting and with weeping and with
[28:04] mourning and R in your heart and not
[28:06] your garments and turn unto the Lord
[28:08] your God for he is gracious and merciful
[28:11] slow to anger and of great kindness and
[28:15] repented him of the evil who knoweth if
[28:18] he will return and repent and leave a
[28:20] blessing behind him even a meat offering
[28:22] a drink often on to the Lord your God
[28:24] blow the trumpet in Zion sanctify a fast
[28:28] call assembly call a solemn assembly may
[28:32] God bless his word you may be seated
[28:34] amen oh praise God could you see it
[28:38] praise the Lord tonight that's what we
[28:40] had to do to praise Him and to worship
[28:42] Him oh praise God sir tonight I will try
[28:45] to blow a trumpet song and a laugh
[28:48] that's a title might blow a trumpet
[28:51] song the lamb and I believe this is a
[28:56] call to go out the court of samba out of
[29:00] liturgy
[29:00] out of being lukewarm and prayer
[29:03] a call to repentance a call to
[29:07] confession the call of the prayer now
[29:11] this trumpet was first announced in
[29:14] numbers 10 numbers 10 verse 1 to 10 and
[29:18] I read it and the Lord spake unto Moses
[29:20] saying make to the two trumpets of
[29:23] silver of whole peace shall don't make
[29:26] them and don't misuse them here would
[29:29] have held purpose to them for the
[29:30] calling of the assembly for the
[29:33] journeying of the camps when they shall
[29:36] blow with them all the Assembly shall
[29:39] assemble themselves together to thee at
[29:41] the door of the tabernacle of the
[29:43] congregation if they blow but with one
[29:45] trumpet then the princess which are
[29:48] heads of thousands of Israel shall
[29:50] gather themselves unto thee when you
[29:53] blow on a lamb then the camps that lie
[29:55] on the east parts shall go forward and
[29:58] you blow on a lamb the second time then
[30:01] the camps that lie on the south side
[30:03] shall take their journey they shall
[30:05] blown an alarm for their journeys but
[30:07] when the congregation is said gathered
[30:09] together
[30:09] you shall blow but you shall not song
[30:12] can allow and the sons of Aaron the
[30:14] priests shall blow the trumpets and they
[30:17] shall be to you for an ordinance for
[30:19] ever short your generations and if you
[30:23] go to war in your land against the enemy
[30:26] little prostitute then you shall blow an
[30:29] alarm with the trumpets and it shall be
[30:31] remembered before the Lord your God you
[30:33] shall be saved from your enemy and in
[30:36] the day of your gladness and in your
[30:38] sullen days in the beginnings of your
[30:40] months
[30:40] you shall blow with the trumpets over
[30:42] your booty offerings over the sacrifices
[30:44] of your peace offerings that they may be
[30:46] to you a memorial before your God I am
[30:50] the Lord your God Amen so that was where
[30:54] God introduces trumpets and you notice
[30:56] that the trumpet gave a song to cause a
[30:58] certain action whether for war for
[31:01] gathering for announcement it had a
[31:04] purpose behind it they had instructions
[31:06] behind it it gives a distinct and a
[31:08] sitting song for certain purpose but
[31:11] tonight I am trusting that God soars
[31:15] blow into your heart that you will rose
[31:18] you into action to shake you into action
[31:21] and not this intellectual sitting in
[31:23] church taken here would message thing
[31:26] not that but the school you want to
[31:28] still you interaction hallelujah we
[31:31] believe that it was the duty of the
[31:34] priests to blow the trumpets for the
[31:36] assembling of the congregation to remove
[31:39] the camp to go to war to announce danger
[31:42] it was the duty of the priests the blew
[31:45] that trumpet the church is in need of a
[31:47] weakness no one never prophet said the
[31:50] bride had another revival yet there have
[31:52] been no manifestation of God to stir the
[31:54] bride it will take them seven thunders
[31:55] the prophet knew that it will take
[31:58] something a week of the people to wake
[32:00] up not the people I should say wake up
[32:01] the bride because she was sleeping but
[32:04] something on a weaker up or do you
[32:06] believe that tonight so the strumpet was
[32:08] used a song and a lamb to give fear the
[32:11] danger is that a warning come in isn't
[32:14] that right two rows of impending danger
[32:17] arose the people that they could be
[32:19] sensitive to the judgment that was at
[32:21] ham oh praise God hallelujah so we
[32:25] believe that there's a need for a
[32:27] weakness or glory that got to get a
[32:29] fresh Boonton for your children and your
[32:31] family people take it for granted you
[32:32] look what is good what is good what is
[32:35] good you can say measure and no burden
[32:37] no tears no travel no crying and sighin
[32:42] parents and church sharing outside and
[32:44] there's no burden hallelujah oh they did
[32:47] a condition that you will get a burden
[32:49] Oh to blow a trumpet in Zion and summon
[32:52] a lamb to shake yourself
[32:54] they say this cannot continue something
[32:57] has to take place something of the break
[33:00] for all glory to God when scienter feel
[33:03] Zion brought forth you can continue just
[33:06] like abnormal normal normal a trumpet is
[33:09] a song that seems something is about to
[33:11] happen judgment is about to strike
[33:14] it's the day of the Lord at the abacus
[33:17] and givenness and the app just meant and
[33:19] earthquakes and all Canada's acid is
[33:21] coming
[33:22] nobody could stop it Oh hallelujah
[33:25] praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God
[33:29] too cheap to check the church from his
[33:32] dullness and from the love Oh glory to
[33:36] God and whenever the trumpet song and
[33:38] it's given and an announcement that just

[43:32] expect to see what what do you think you
[43:34] want to see
[43:37] christ was the dog christ is the door
[43:40] he's not right about and said before I
[43:42] set before you an open door and he's
[43:44] bringing a revolution inside her here he
[43:46] said this is from religion Chapter four
[43:48] just a novel he said you know I've said
[43:51] before the open door he said after the
[43:53] methodist church age they turn away from
[43:55] it I've said before an open door I put
[43:57] an open door which is the Holy Spirit
[44:01] hallelujah
[44:03] so when God put the open door he put no
[44:05] man with that door before the whole
[44:07] experience has set before you open door
[44:08] Holy Spirit and that it was an open door
[44:10] that anybody that's why the Pentecostal
[44:13] is had no man messenger it was open door
[44:16] still that's why the Holy Ghost poured
[44:18] upon them because open door is not right
[44:21] watch watch I put an open door which is
[44:24] the Holy Spirit and he said by one
[44:26] Spirit we are all baptized into one body
[44:28] which is Christ he said that message
[44:30] before the Methodist Church and the turn
[44:34] aside from it the core personification
[44:36] and refused the Holy Ghost remember
[44:39] that's the open door how do we get into
[44:41] Christ by one spirit Holy Spirit which
[44:44] is Christ spirit we are enter in not my
[44:47] hand shaken not by sprinkling but by one
[44:50] Holy Ghost baptism we are all baptized
[44:54] into one body and made partakers of that
[44:57] one body one Holy Ghost baptism into
[45:00] that door Oh hallelujah
[45:02] I says again one Holy Ghost baptism into
[45:05] that door this door was set in heaven he
[45:08] looked up towards heaven and he's in an
[45:10] open door on the first voice so like a
[45:12] trumpet and all the scenes change from
[45:14] Patmos to heaven the voice here we go
[45:17] the voice that will walk with the seven
[45:19] golden candlesticks that same voice
[45:21] didn't change but the voice when it was
[45:24] hid in the first time how many remember
[45:26] that I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[45:27] Day in the spirit isn't that right I was
[45:30] in the spirit on the Lord's Day and I
[45:31] heard behind me a voice of a trumpet
[45:34] that song like many waters and that many
[45:37] waters is a voice of the ministers the
[45:39] voice of the preachers the voice of many
[45:41] waters the voice of the people he
[45:43] explained what the voice of many waters
[45:44] is it's cause for all the ages
[45:46] speaking the word the people and as they
[45:48] rejected the voice turned the judgment
[45:50] or glory to Gordon remember revelation
[45:53] is still a book assembles a lot of
[45:55] things representing something else let's
[45:57] continue hallelujah
[45:59] and when I turned and look I saw one
[46:01] styling the missile sum of all of Stan's
[46:02] legs and he showed all the mystery of
[46:04] them seven golden candlesticks holding
[46:06] seven stars he looked and saw an open
[46:08] door an open door into heaven how do you
[46:11] get in by Christ Jesus one door one way
[46:14] any man can climb one away and the other
[46:17] we see him as a thief on a rubber and in
[46:19] the parable of the one who climb up and
[46:22] was in the wedding supper with hope they
[46:23] comment on was found guilty was bombed
[46:25] and cast into outer darkness only one
[46:28] way I believe I preached here not long
[46:30] ago whenever somebody gets married in
[46:32] the old country he given invitations
[46:34] himself he has to furnish the robes and
[46:37] when he met this man sitting there how
[46:39] many remember the parable he found a man
[46:41] at the supper table without a wedding
[46:43] garment on what is it the bridegroom
[46:46] stands at the door and all who comes up
[46:48] with an invitation no man can come to
[46:51] the Father except by me and when they
[46:53] come to the invitation so that everybody
[46:55] will look alike look alike not you
[46:59] better than who and who look alike
[47:01] watch watch whether they are rich or
[47:04] poor bond or free black or white male or
[47:07] female they are all one in Christ Jesus
[47:09] and the bridegroom stood at the door and
[47:11] received the invitation and put the rope
[47:13] around his fellow so the rich and the
[47:15] poor all look alike that's the way it is
[47:18] in the kingdom of God there's no big
[47:20] guys and little guys there's only one
[47:22] guy one Christ Jesus wanted Christ only
[47:26] believe that so this money came to this
[47:29] back door and the master came as a
[47:30] friend how did you get in here when I
[47:32] got it on Jesus said as himself he said
[47:35] he called to the port of
[47:37] dynam foot on hand he was cast into
[47:40] outer darkness where there was weeping
[47:42] and wailing and gnashing of teeth
[47:43] that's Christ's own words he was cast
[47:45] out because it through here we go
[47:47] without the wedding garment he comes
[47:49] some other way besides the door because
[47:52] if he come to the door he would have
[47:53] received the wedding garment he said oh
[47:55] listen to
[47:56] then if the wedding gammon is the
[47:59] baptism of the Holy Spirit Hall our
[48:01] Weaver will be going to be represented
[48:03] any other way you've got to come by
[48:06] christ jesus the way the truth the life

[48:15] brother branham what I see without the
[48:17] door you only getting started
[48:19] the Bible he said he'd never believe and
[48:21] tremble Oh hallelujah let's continue but
[48:24] here's what I want to get to revelation
[48:28] 1:10 313 I want you to notice the voice
[48:30] that he heard speaking to him had the
[48:32] clearness of a trumpet you know how our
[48:35] trumpet songs it give a shrill song what
[48:39] does a trumpet mean question in the
[48:42] Bible what does a trumpet mean war
[48:46] anytime you see a trumpet blow it is war
[48:49] in the by the time it is a song in meant
[48:52] a war then he went further either a
[48:56] revelation or something to take place so
[49:02] identify treating a war a revelation or
[49:06] something to take place all glory to God

[49:59] battle the people that rejected God's
[50:02] message rejected the Holy Spirit the
[50:05] messenger of the seven churches oh the
[50:09] one that had rejected this message of
[50:12] His grace has nothing left but judgment
[50:15] and that's why with the jubilee trumpet
[50:19] song those who don't wanna go free had
[50:22] to be bored in the air so that they
[50:25] would have no more effect upon them they
[50:28] have to hear it and they can be released
[50:30] from the condition because they choose
[50:33] not to go free all glory to God that's
[50:36] exactly right when it come to that sets
[50:39] per set condition he does fifty-fifty
[50:42] still righteous still holy still oh this
[50:45] is not skim milk Alleluia

[51:06] man in the fire they had to act on the

[51:15] fellowship about the word come future
[51:17] acts on it I'm gonna short George sent
[51:22] me something I guess I think I'm gonna

[51:28] late for the prayer line and she was
[51:30] healed before of some disease or
[51:32] something like that and she commonly
[51:34] back and Byron was leaving mom say the
[51:36] same God that he we are the first thing

[51:39] like that and as she got here three
[51:42] months later the miracle was performed
[51:44] on her
[51:46] and it brought brother George my home
[51:47] take three months it takes three months
[51:49] but it was done I said when I thought
[51:50] she was a believer she believed what the
[51:53] Prophet said Oh glory to God because I
[51:55] live in some miracle and it's a span of
[51:57] time miracles

[52:24] miracle but you were acting upon what
[52:26] God said thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah
[52:36] praise God Joshua let's go back to this
[52:39] morning he match around the wall exactly
[52:41] like a chief captain told him the enemy
[52:48] must be was defeated because there was
[52:50] inside the wall but now he was going to
[52:52] get in how he'll get us out of here so
[52:55] he took a little stroll to meditate and
[52:57] then he's met a man he joins and he's
[53:01] told him what to do and it's a kind of
[53:03] hard thing to think watch that you could
[53:06] blow a trumpet and make a wall fall down
[53:08] I waiting the mother the instruction
[53:12] looking kind of flimsy that you could
[53:14] blow a trumpet and make a wall for long
[53:15] but he acted and God makes it simple and
[53:19] silly it goes plumb over the head of the
[53:22] limb it takes those unlearn that don't
[53:26] know very much to understand it but when
[53:28] you try to figure it out you can't
[53:29] figure it out you got to take God's word
[53:31] for it the we said to do it not the way
[53:33] we think to do it but the way he said do
[53:35] it
[53:36] Oh glory to God when I bid you the shout
[53:39] shout and then drop them trumpets on

[53:47] trumpets not a hit a song and hit some
[53:49] kind of porn a clever and uncertainty
[53:53] they could explain it away right now but
[53:55] court said when I beautiful child show
[53:57] walk Laurita thought when I shout there
[54:00] is something reverberations I'm gonna
[54:02] set up and I go take it from there

[54:06] when they will release the stone God
[54:08] never said God said release it and I
[54:10] won't take the stones from there or give
[54:12] the Lord a show but I'm taking rock
[54:14] quarry chilled up in the air and then

[1:12:05] generations and thou shalt be called the
[1:12:08] repairer of the breach to restorer of
[1:12:12] paths to dwell in we have a great
[1:12:15] ministry ahead a great call in the head
[1:12:18] but it's a cost that goes with it I'm
[1:12:23] almost done Ezekiel 33 reading from
[1:12:27] verse 1 again the word of the Lord came
[1:12:29] unto me saying son of man speak to the
[1:12:32] share of Israel and say unto them when i
[1:12:33] bring the sword upon a land if the
[1:12:38] people of the land take a man of their
[1:12:40] coasts and set him for their Watchmen
[1:12:45] when he see the sword come upon the land
[1:12:49] he blow the trumpet and warn the people
[1:12:52] then whosoever here at the song of the
[1:12:55] trumpet and taketh not warning if the
[1:12:57] sword come and take him away his blood
[1:13:00] shall be upon his own head
[1:13:01] he heard the song of the trumpet took
[1:13:04] not warning
[1:13:06] his blood shall be upon him but he that
[1:13:09] taketh warning shall deliver his soul
[1:13:10] but if the watchman see the short come
[1:13:14] and blown up the trumpet and the people
[1:13:18] be not warned if the short come and take
[1:13:22] any person from among them he is taken
[1:13:25] away in his iniquity but his blood will
[1:13:27] I require at the watchman's hand
[1:13:30] oh so this give a different perspective
[1:13:33] now of this trumpet to be blown oh if
[1:13:38] the watchman doll or the trumpet
[1:13:41] and things happen God require at the
[1:13:44] watchman's hand the man so Solomon
[1:13:48] so there were seven so sodaro Solomon I
[1:13:52] have set thee a watchman unto the house
[1:13:57] of Israel therefore thou shalt hear the
[1:14:00] word at my mouth and warn them from me
[1:14:04] when I say unto the wicked a wicked man
[1:14:07] don't shall surely die if thou dost not
[1:14:11] speak to warn the wicked from his way
[1:14:13] that wicked man shall die in his
[1:14:17] iniquity but his blood will I require at
[1:14:21] thine hand nevertheless if the warn the
[1:14:24] wicked of his way to turn from it and he
[1:14:26] turn not from his way he shall die in
[1:14:29] iniquity but that was delivered I saw
[1:14:32] therefore thou son a man speak under the
[1:14:35] house of Israel does he speak seeing if
[1:14:39] our transgression of all still be upon
[1:14:41] us and we pine away hold shall we live
[1:14:43] say unto them as I live saith the Lord I
[1:14:46] have no pleasure in the death of the
[1:14:48] wicked but are the wicked till from his
[1:14:51] way and live turn me from your evil ways
[1:14:54] why will you die Oh hopes of Israel so
[1:14:59] if you see from these scriptures
[1:15:00] whatever burden for people to really
[1:15:01] repent because he wants to forgive he
[1:15:05] wants to restore he wants to heal he
[1:15:08] wants to bless if you believe that
[1:15:10] Isaiah 21 11 12 the building of Douma he
[1:15:14] call it me or the seer watchman what of
[1:15:16] the night watchman one of the night the
[1:15:18] what
[1:15:18] one said the morning comment and also
[1:15:20] the night if he/she will inquire in ye
[1:15:23] return come on in brother branham preach
[1:15:26] a message watch my one at night he says
[1:15:28] and then is talking about as soon as we
[1:15:31] get washed up and groomed up talk what
[1:15:33] people estimate eysan we will meet at
[1:15:35] the tavern as usual and I'm sure John
[1:15:37] you are you all dis to buy body message
[1:15:40] be here today
[1:15:40] watch 100 hour trying to make a dick to
[1:15:43] Joy although our life gonna tell us
[1:15:45] there's a push in danger because it was
[1:15:46] finally tower he seen something and
[1:15:48] these people want to party they want to
[1:15:50] drink and whatnot so he's talking about
[1:15:51] people who talking about it with this
[1:15:53] watch man want to take away the joy from
[1:15:55] us he said know what and you know we
[1:15:57] have the best happy days I'm in our
[1:15:59] soldiers meet each night same place we
[1:16:01] enjoy fellowship together gambling a few
[1:16:04] drinks as for myself he said I would
[1:16:07] refuse to be alarmed about any of this
[1:16:08] stuff that this watchman would talk
[1:16:10] about or rabbis know about this or
[1:16:12] pastors and so on we believe that there
[1:16:14] will be a possible chance to Watchmen
[1:16:16] could be right all this warning thing
[1:16:19] and warning thing you know we don't have
[1:16:22] to take that so seriously do you know
[1:16:24] this
[1:16:24] this is Birdman oh you know there's
[1:16:25] something about danger there's something
[1:16:28] about debt that seems to have a
[1:16:30] forewarning of it many times that loved
[1:16:32] ones before passed on across the other
[1:16:34] side a warning comes to them hallelujah
[1:16:37] Watchmen must be on duty at all times he
[1:16:40] was to warn the people of approaching
[1:16:43] dangers that was his duty to watch for
[1:16:46] Putin dinner
[1:16:46] danger he was up in a tower that was
[1:16:49] built much higher than the walls and
[1:16:51] this tower had to be up there in it the
[1:16:53] books of astronomy and so forth you
[1:16:55] could watch the stars I'm telling the
[1:16:56] time any approaching time of the day he
[1:16:59] could tell it Danny was you could see
[1:17:00] further than anyone on the ground he
[1:17:02] could see further he was up higher

[1:17:10] thing that that was he tall first thing
[1:17:12] so they kept pistol on the bella Tower a

[1:17:45] people and given warnings to God
[1:17:48] hallelujah that Watchmen ought to be
[1:17:51] trained he had to know what he was doing
[1:17:54] but at any distance as soon as he arose
[1:17:56] the enemy could detect it he could tell
[1:17:58] their walk he could tell their match he
[1:18:00] could tell their color he could tell
[1:18:02] that rank-and-file that's his father
[1:18:03] whom I could see could see it he was
