[29:45] [Music]
[29:52] how true it is that we limit God and
[29:55] time God and he's Eternal we can't do
[29:58] that so tonight we're facing something
[30:02] else now is a communion
[30:06] three years are waiting for church to
[30:08] come in through songs but it's here
[30:12] we're here so be thankful Lord you just
[30:16] let us wait till we appreciate it now
[30:18] there's one thing that I want to say
[30:21] just before we start a communion is this
[30:25] that I believe that we have seen enough
[30:28] in our day that we live in that we
[30:32] ought to really give every all of our
[30:36] being to God we should really serve God
[30:39] I believe that he has blessed us with
[30:42] the
[30:43] direct answer to scripture as brother
[30:46] Perry gave it a few moments ago that we
[30:50] we are
[30:51] we're at that time we're not blind we we
[30:54] see that we're here we've arrived amen
[30:57] and we also can look around and see the
[31:00] the way that the human mind is leading
[31:04] the people that we we can't stay too
[31:06] much longer we've been in a complete
[31:08] insane institution the whole world would
[31:10] be thing so we we're at the end time
[31:14] well as brother Perry ended up there
[31:16] seeing these things are true see that
[31:20] they are true they're not myth they're
[31:22] not just something that we imagine
[31:24] there's something that's been directly
[31:26] given to us by the word of God and
[31:29] manifested publicly before
[31:32] we know we are here we don't
[31:36] own now because again we come back to a
[31:39] watch you see what time it is but we're
[31:42] we know we we've here we're at the time
[31:44] whether God's time I'd imagine someone
[31:47] give a little
[31:48] time that said that if God put up with
[31:51] him uh according if he was the last time
[31:55] one one thousand years or just one day
[31:58] so if a man lives 70 years old and just
[32:01] be a few minutes of God's time right
[32:04] well it said to be four years that would
[32:07] even meantime Hardy get bad he died they
[32:10] just that's how quick it is the whole
[32:12] thing is if it be a lot of time which it
[32:14] doesn't have any time so it's just it's
[32:17] Eternal I believe it's Sarah that ruled
[32:20] Joseph the other night said in Hebrews
[32:21] there he said Daddy
[32:24] when did God come on this thing well
[32:26] where did he come from see he had to
[32:29] have a beginning Jenny did he have to
[32:31] start off the no anything that has a
[32:33] beginning has an end right but it's that
[32:36] which had not a beginning has no end of
[32:38] course he's 10 years old that was kind
[32:40] of a real mouthful for him see how can
[32:43] he even see that knowing that something
[32:45] never did begin not only to him it is
[32:48] today
[32:50] it's a great big dose for me how did it
[32:54] ever begin now we're fixing to observe
[32:57] something here that's really sacred I
[33:01] was told on a few days ago to some very
[33:04] fine Christian gentlemen that uh
[33:08] it's never had this and he understood
[33:11] that we've taken communion literally
[33:14] they take it what they call spiritual
[33:17] communion and uh which as far as
[33:21] communion I say all right because
[33:23] communicate is to talk to see and the
[33:26] brother give me the scripture says
[33:27] brother bran don't you think now a
[33:30] reason I'm saying this is sorrowful
[33:32] the reason I'm saying this so that you
[33:35] would understand what you're doing you
[33:37] know if you're walking it ain't blindly
[33:39] you don't know what you're doing you
[33:41] can't have even confidence
[33:43] if you don't know what you're doing but
[33:45] you must understand what you are doing
[33:48] and why you're doing it he said now if
[33:52] we take the word of God
[33:54] isn't that God that we're taking I said
[33:57] exactly right sir it's true but we read
[34:00] here that they actually claw talk taking
[34:04] the literal Lord's Supper this dude
[34:08] remembered to me said Jesus as often as
[34:10] you take it and remembers me you show
[34:11] forth the Lord's death till he comes see
[34:13] now we are to take it we understand that
[34:16] Saint Paul who ordained it in the church
[34:19] being the prophet of the New Testament
[34:21] of Peter James John all of them they
[34:25] wrote Matthew Mark Luke what Jesus did
[34:27] ascribe but Paul stepped the thing in
[34:30] order he was the uh he was the prophet
[34:34] of the New Testament
[34:35] just as Moses went into the Wilderness
[34:37] to receive the inspiration to write the
[34:40] the five books of uh of the first five
[34:43] books of the Bible where Paul also went
[34:47] into the desert and received inspiration
[34:50] from God to set the New Testament Church
[34:53] in our room and type it with the old
[34:55] under there you had the sacrificial lamb
[34:58] and Israel kept that foreign it was
[35:02] actually used one time coming out of
[35:05] Egypt
[35:06] but then they kept that as a memorial
[35:08] all after the age whereas the law being
[35:11] a shadow of things to come and see now I
[35:15] do believe that communion of what we
[35:18] call communion now is the Lord's
[35:20] suffered now we only have three physical
[35:24] Divine orders left to us one of them is
[35:28] is communion
[35:31] feet washing water baptism
[35:34] that's the only three things that's the
[35:36] Perfection of this reason is that's the
[35:38] only three orders we have we realized
[35:40] that that was the issue given by Saint
[35:43] Paul in the New Testament now if we
[35:46] would say it the communion should just
[35:48] be taken the word
[35:50] I don't believe anyone has a right to
[35:52] take the Lord separate until he's taken
[35:54] the word of the Lord into his heart see
[35:57] because I'll read something for you in a
[35:59] few moments and you'll see now
[36:06] on the same basis we could absolutely
[36:09] justify the Salvation Army they do not
[36:12] believe in any form of water baptism
[36:14] except we don't need it
[36:16] now if we don't need water baptism why
[36:20] are we baptized if a water can't save
[36:21] you the blood saves you I'll agree with
[36:23] that amen amen right that's right the
[36:25] blood station off the water but we must
[36:27] take the water as an outward emotion
[36:30] that an inwardly work of Grace has been
[36:32] done
[36:33] so bless we own communion when we have
[36:37] taken the Lord our sacrifice into us as
[36:41] a matter of spiritual birth interest in
[36:45] his body we live by him by the word we
[36:48] also should symbolize it because it's a
[36:50] commandment repent every one of you and
[36:53] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[36:55] or the remission of your sins Paul said
[36:58] I have received to the Lord that which I
[37:00] also delivered unto you that the Lord
[37:02] Jesus the same night which is betrayed
[37:04] took bread and break it and give it to
[37:05] the disciples and and said Take and Eat
[37:08] This dude and remembers to me for his
[37:10] office you take this bread you show
[37:12] forth his death till he comes now we
[37:15] find out that in that they had people
[37:17] who comment this uh precious brother
[37:20] very dear brother he came and he said I
[37:23] never I never you take a program I don't
[37:25] understand what it is I've been taught
[37:26] the other side I said remember we will
[37:30] admit that Saint Paul said it in order
[37:32] in the early Christian Church
[37:35] they went from church to house the house
[37:37] broke the bread and singles to the heart
[37:39] and so forth now I said he did but is in
[37:42] the church Galatians 1 8 he said if an
[37:44] angel from heaven comes and says
[37:46] anything else let it be a curse amen the
[37:49] same one ahead of me rebaptized again
[37:51] from the uh baptism of John to be
[37:55] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[37:57] see there are three things that we must
[38:00] three things that we must do is simple
[38:02] Lord's Supper deep ocean water baptism
[38:06] see there's he said well the now the
[38:09] Salvation Army takes it from the point
[38:11] the dying sea when he died he wasn't
[38:13] baptized here Jesus said he would be in
[38:16] heaven that's exactly the truth that's
[38:19] exactly but you see he he he only
[38:21] recognized Jesus right there in an hour
[38:23] he was dying see
[38:29] [Laughter]
[38:32] Lord remember me
[38:34] and Jesus Christ
[38:39] be baptized and refuse to do it then
[38:42] that'll be between you and God Amen same
[38:44] thing in communion now when we take this
[38:47] communion it isn't just the things that
[38:49] come up here and go to eat some bread
[38:51] and I believe I'm a Christian but if you
[38:53] notice the Bible said he that eateth and
[38:56] drinketh unworthily
[38:58] shall be guilty of the blood and the
[39:00] body of the Lord
[39:02] you've got to live a life that that
[39:05] before the people that and before God
[39:08] and the people that show that you're
[39:11] that you are sincere are just a moment
[39:14] longer
[39:16] now
[39:17] in the Old Testament when the sacrifice
[39:21] was made a statue or an ordinance and so
[39:27] is water baptism on ordinance
[39:39] all of his Commandments that he might
[39:41] have a right to enter into the tree of
[39:43] life now notice in this now that in that
[39:47] first when it was first in ordinance of
[39:50] God to bring a sacrifice to the church
[39:52] and uh to the temple and the altering
[39:55] offer your gift and for your sins the
[39:58] sacrifice of a lamb or I can just
[40:01] imagine seeing some Jewish a brother
[40:03] coming down the road knowing that he was
[40:06] guilty and he goes to the altar or
[40:08] brings his fat box or whatever he had
[40:12] Iran lamb something he brought down the
[40:16] road Justice sin serious he could come
[40:19] you walked up there keeping God's
[40:22] artists just as sincerely as he could
[40:25] then he laid his hands up on it
[40:27] confessing his sins of a priest placing
[40:30] this his sins upon the lamb and the
[40:33] Lamb's throat was cut and uh and then
[40:35] died for him as he laid there
[40:38] the little lamb kicking and bleeding his
[40:40] hands being full of blood and flying all
[40:43] over him a little lamb plate and died he
[40:46] will realize that he had sinned and
[40:49] something had to die in his place
[40:51] therefore he was offering this Lamb's
[40:55] death for his death these the lamb died
[40:58] in his place
[41:00] and a man done it was sincerity with
[41:03] deepness of his heart finally over
[41:08] and over it kept going until finally it
[41:12] become a tradition
[41:15] commandment of God became a tradition to
[41:18] the people
[41:20] now we'll see it's a swords or David
[41:23] yeah I better offer of Abdullah he went
[41:26] out well Lord see there's no sincerity
[41:30] in it there's no understanding to it
[41:33] or we don't want to take communion like
[41:35] that that's the same thing as we come to
[41:38] a large table
[41:39] on this uh 35 no big report Isaiah 60.
[41:44] now let me take that back I I believe
[41:47] it's Isaiah 28 that's where we find this
[41:51] I'm pretty sure that's the right chapter
[41:53] he said priesip must be up on precept
[41:56] and line upon line up online here's a
[41:58] little darling okay for that what's good
[42:00] for stamina lips other tongue so I speak
[42:02] to these people and this is the rest
[42:04] these are all the tables of the Lord has
[42:07] become full of vomit
[42:09] who can I teach Doctrine who can I make
[42:12] to understand see I think that was the
[42:15] right scripture I did 20. who can I make
[42:18] understand Doctrine see the table now we
[42:21] find out today that this great thing
[42:23] that we're fixing to do tonight is
[42:26] commemoration of his death and his body
[42:29] that we believe that we eat daily or
[42:32] just got through Eden as our brother
[42:34] preached to us take in the word of God
[42:36] we believe it with all of our hearts we
[42:38] sit manifested we should give unto us we
[42:41] said Vindicated we feel it in our lives
[42:44] and we must come to this with a deep
[42:47] conscience of what we're doing
[42:49] not just because it's an order you go
[42:51] into church and many times they get out
[42:53] an old silly cracker or some kind of a
[42:56] or something breaking up a light bread
[42:58] or or something and and break it up and
[43:01] people who smoke drink everything else
[43:03] because they're a member of the church
[43:04] they come and take the large supper
[43:08] well that's filthiness before God even
[43:11] the sacrifice said your holy days your
[43:13] sacrifice become a stance in my nose
[43:16] yet we are paying them to make that
[43:19] sacrifice but the way they treated it it
[43:22] become a stunt
[43:27] sacrifice that he ordained that's
[43:30] the way we take the word of God too many
[43:34] Christians today so-called does that
[43:36] we stand up here and teach this word and
[43:38] say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[43:40] and forever and entice the things that
[43:43] he promised us that he would honor
[43:46] [Applause]
[43:50] in his nose
[43:52] he will not receive it by many that's
[43:56] Reason by our traditional habits you
[43:59] don't take the Lord's Supper by
[44:01] tradition you take it because it's the
[44:03] love of God in your heart and keeping
[44:05] the Commandments of God that's what you
[44:08] take it for so if you don't take it in
[44:10] sincerity just it's a tradition well our
[44:13] church observes communion once every
[44:16] Sunday or once every month or twice a
[44:18] year and you go upstairs my time and I'm
[44:21] going to take the communion why it's a
[44:23] stink God see that's just a tradition
[44:29] even like anything else
[44:33] sincere God wants the depths of your
[44:36] heart you remember the very God that
[44:38] brought you here on Earth is the
[44:39] one-year servant
[44:42] your goodness because he said so because
[44:44] it's his order then we want to come up
[44:47] with deepness
[44:49] ignoring that God God's grace that we
[44:53] have been saved and we we love him and
[44:56] we feel this presence and we we sit uh
[44:59] change our lives or our whole being is
[45:02] changed
[45:04] we're different people we don't live
[45:06] like we used to we don't think like we
[45:08] used to
[45:09] like in the book here and a small air
[45:13] was talk about the the two books being
[45:15] one The Book of Life The First Book of
[45:17] Life coming up was when you were born
[45:19] that was your natural birth
[45:21] okay but then one time way back down in
[45:26] there there was a little green of life
[45:27] as I was explaining to some of the young
[45:29] sisters at the house this afternoon see
[45:32] there's a little green of Life laying
[45:34] there that you'd wonder where did it
[45:35] come from what what these strange things
[45:39] a saying is taken for myself I just go
[45:42] see William Branham well 40 years ago
[45:45] the William Brown they used to the same
[45:47] one tonight there's somebody back there
[45:49] said we rang he was a rank Rascal
[45:52] because I was born of Charles and
[45:55] ellebrand
[45:56] in that nature I was a sinner I came to
[46:00] a rural a liar and all the habits of the
[46:03] world laid right in me but down in there
[46:06] too was another
[46:13] is in there by God in the same body
[46:19] two Natures in there well I only cater
[46:22] to one is it growed out good as the baby
[46:25] Dead Eye first thing in orbit come a
[46:27] liar become everything else that's a
[46:30] sinner because I raised up that way but
[46:32] down in there was a little speck of Life
[46:34] all the time
[46:36] I used to remember as a little boy
[46:39] I hope I'm not horny children but Floyd
[46:42] uh sitting out in the uh on the creek
[46:45] Bank might sit there and look one at
[46:47] night time talking Mom they're going on
[46:50] out to their rest
[46:52] and uh them days they were Sinners the
[46:54] whole Christianity in our homes are all
[46:56] in our own my drinking at parties and
[46:59] caring it made me sick
[47:02] I take my my rain on and my dog and grow
[47:05] up the woods to stay all night in the
[47:08] wintertime I'm hunt until the party was
[47:10] over maybe daylight in the morning come
[47:13] home wouldn't be over I'll lay on top of
[47:15] the shed and sleep
[47:16] waiting for daylight to break then I'd
[47:19] think of how the times then being out
[47:23] there in the summer time get uh sticks
[47:26] and put it down for a little wind break
[47:28] or if it rains later I have a pole
[47:31] sticking in the water fishing my whole
[47:34] clean dog laying there
[47:36] after looking here
[47:38] you know last winter I came back here
[47:43] one night I'll build a fire right here
[47:45] when I was waiting for my old dog here
[47:47] to treat and uh I had a fire it was
[47:50] froze five inches deep in the ground
[47:53] [Music]
[47:55] where did you come from
[47:59] foreign
[48:04] what hard house did they bring you out
[48:06] or what about where'd you come from
[48:09] see that little fire stick while it was
[48:11] frozen everything in our building
[48:13] followed up here besides the freezing uh
[48:17] that a heat element being here on a big
[48:19] old long drive and yet here you are
[48:21] you're alive
[48:23] where'd you come from what was it there
[48:26] was another William brand
[48:30] of eternal life down there from the the
[48:37] was placed in each one of you can make a
[48:39] similar thing it was working now look up
[48:43] to the trees I think me I'll see you
[48:46] fall off last year and why are you back
[48:49] there again where'd you come from
[48:51] that brought you here see it was that
[48:56] eternal life working in the Box
[49:00] now thing one day as I walked on their
[49:04] boys talking don't never smoke drink so
[49:06] forth and the young fellows you know I
[49:08] got older see there was something moving
[49:10] but yet all it wants to ask
[49:13] looked up and I said
[49:16] I'm not the son of Charles now LeBron
[49:20] there's something called like a little
[49:22] eagle
[49:24] another chicken or something at the
[49:27] honor somewhere
[49:29] whoever you are open up I welcome home
[49:34] there's something in Decline then I was
[49:37] born again that little life was laying
[49:40] there the life of water was pulled up on
[49:43] it they need to give the girls
[49:45] ah that old life was forgiven but in the
[49:49] sea of God's forgiveness to Never Be
[49:51] Remembered against me no more they now
[49:55] we stand Justified as though we never
[49:57] had sin in the presence of God remember
[50:00] we come to the Lord's table we must come
[50:03] in reverence
[50:05] love and respect the look where we would
[50:08] have been if it hadn't been for him
[50:11] look where it was it therefore Paul I
[50:13] think it sent it
[50:15] hopefully when you come together to eat
[50:17] Harry one for the other that is in other
[50:20] words just wait a few minutes three
[50:23] check yourself out and if you know a
[50:27] brother's in there just about to do
[50:29] something that's wrong or something uh
[50:31] and you pray for him too see if Terry
[50:34] won the other wait just a minute pray if
[50:38] there's any feelings between you or
[50:40] something
[50:41] don't do it don't make it right first
[50:44] see go straighten that up first because
[50:46] they want to come here just as cure as
[50:49] we can be in our thoughts one another
[50:52] and to God and to each other and then we
[50:56] come in Fellowship around the table of
[51:00] the Lord see and we do this because that
[51:03] we are giving thanks to him and among
[51:07] one another eating your bread between
[51:09] each other drinking the wine between
[51:11] your asses blood and his flesh except
[51:15] you eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[51:18] drink his blood you have no life in you
[51:21] see you see that's what the Bible says
[51:24] except you do it there's no life you see
[51:27] you are then more or less showing you
[51:31] are ashamed
[51:33] to identify yourself
[51:35] as a Christian
[51:37] because of the life that you live and
[51:40] then this is really The Showdown then if
[51:43] you don't do it you have no life if you
[51:47] do do it unworldly you're guilty of the
[51:49] body of the Lord
[51:51] same thing in water baptism if we say we
[51:54] believe on Jesus Christ he saved us from
[51:56] sin and we're baptized in the name of
[51:59] Jesus Christ
[52:00] while we bring we bring disgrace to him
[52:04] we do the things that's wrong and we we
[52:08] have to pay for that and another thing
[52:10] when we do that we are trying to profess
[52:14] one thing and do another that's a
[52:17] trouble of this today what I think I'm
[52:20] saying us me
[52:21] in the church that the Lord God has let
[52:24] me speak to in these last hours
[52:27] that we believe we're in the closing
[52:29] time
[52:30] we believe that God has given us a
[52:32] message
[52:34] it's been ordained
[52:37] David of God
[52:38] of God short of God now we must come to
[52:41] him with reverence
[52:44] and with love and with with the purity
[52:47] of heart and mind and soul
[52:50] for our sin Horizon when right Among Us
[52:54] will be the holy spirit will speak out
[52:56] like it did in an inner knife and
[52:57] Sapphire amen
[53:00] is arriving
[53:02] see and we are now you just remember
[53:05] that see the God is going to dwell among
[53:09] these people that's what he wants to do
[53:12] now we can receive the message as Sin if
[53:16] I was a young man hunting for a wife and
[53:19] I could find a wife I said she's just
[53:21] perfect she's a Christian she's a lady
[53:23] she's older I Got Confidence no matter
[53:25] how much confidence how much I think
[53:27] she's not I've got to receive her she's
[53:30] got to receive me see upon these vows
[53:34] well it's the same thing we find is a
[53:37] message we see it's right we see God
[53:39] vindicates it's right it's perfectly
[53:41] right year after year year after year
[53:43] continues right continues right
[53:45] everything it says happens just exactly
[53:47] the way he said now we know it's right
[53:49] but see don't do it from an intellectual
[53:53] standpoint if you do you got a
[53:55] second-handed religion
[53:58] we don't want a second-hand religion
[54:01] something if somebody else has
[54:02] experienced it and we are living off of
[54:05] their testimony as I believe it was
[54:08] Jesus said to pilate uh uh or something
[54:12] in the world I was thinking he said
[54:14] there just a few moments ago uh who told
[54:17] you that it was a revealed to you how
[54:19] did you know these things in other words
[54:21] I don't know it's what the word is now
[54:22] it's been a long time since I've read
[54:24] but how did you how'd you know this how
[54:27] who reveals to you about him being the
[54:29] Son of God who revealed it if some man
[54:32] tell you that
[54:34] or as he said is it my Father in Heaven
[54:37] which has revealed it to you
[54:41] did you learn it
[54:42] a hand or
[54:44] or Revelation from God
[54:47] is this communion just something I grew
[54:49] up for honors say well the rest of them
[54:51] take this I will too it's a revelation
[54:55] [Music]
[54:58] I love you and I love him and we're
[55:01] taking this together as a singular of
[55:04] our love to God and our love and
[55:07] fellowship to one another
[55:09] now I want to read some from the
[55:11] scripture and then I guess
[55:14] whichever way brother Perry desires
[55:16] today I wish you'd read it with me if
[55:18] you got your Bible
[55:19] First Corinthians the uh the 11th
[55:22] chapter and begin with the 23rd verse
[55:26] and then also
[55:28] and our Tabernacle we've always observed
[55:31] this and feet washing always because
[55:34] they go hand in hand together I believe
[55:36] the brother announced it Wednesday night
[55:37] because of the crowds and you don't have
[55:39] enough room to get the people in for
[55:42] feet washing they're going to observe
[55:44] this Wednesday night now 23rd verse of
[55:47] the 11th chapter of First Corinthians
[55:49] this is Paul now remember keep this in
[55:53] mind Galatians 1 8. if we are an angel
[55:57] from heaven preaches any other gospel
[55:59] unto you in this gospel that he had
[56:02] preached let him be a concursor
[56:06] for I have received of the Lord that
[56:08] which I also delivered unto you that the
[56:11] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[56:13] was betrayed took bread
[56:16] and when he gave thanks you break it
[56:18] said Take and Eat This is my body which
[56:22] is broken for you this dude in
[56:24] remembrance of me
[56:26] now let me stop right here to say but
[56:29] take in the body of the Lord Jesus
[56:32] Christ in this communion does not mean
[56:35] that that communion is the literal Body
[56:39] of Christ that's Catholic
[56:41] I do not believe is that's right I
[56:44] believe it's only an ordinance that God
[56:47] made with us it isn't the actual body
[56:50] it's not it's really a little piece of
[56:53] kosher bread that's right it's just an
[56:55] ordinance neither do I believe that the
[56:59] baptism of Jesus Christ in the name of
[57:02] Jesus Christ in water just forgive your
[57:05] sins
[57:11] is perhaps people sitting here who come
[57:13] from the apostolic church I mean the
[57:16] United Pentecostal Church which they
[57:18] teach that but you see I I do not
[57:22] believe that the water forgives sins or
[57:25] if it was in Jesus died in vain amen I
[57:29] believe it's only an ordinance of God
[57:32] see to show that you have been forgiven
[57:35] but to be baptized for regeneration no I
[57:39] I don't believe that I don't believe
[57:40] that water producing neither I believe
[57:42] it is bread and wine has anything to do
[57:45] with you only keeping an ordinance that
[57:48] God has ordained for us to do 16. as
[57:51] every water baptism it's the same thing
[57:53] our biggest compelling to us to do it
[57:55] that you've done it all for our example
[57:58] and you've done this for our example and
[58:00] he wore Street for our example
[58:02] now after the same manner also 25th
[58:06] verse
[58:07] after the same manner also he took the
[58:09] cup and when he had set sin this cup is
[58:14] the New Testament in my blood this Duty
[58:18] as off as you drink it in remembrance of
[58:21] me far as off
[58:33] till he comes huh
[58:36] therefore
[58:41] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[58:44] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[58:47] guilty of the body and the blood of the
[58:49] Lord let me stop just a minute the
[58:52] reason he said this she noticing a verse
[58:54] sure no chapter that he said I
[58:56] understand when you when you come
[58:58] together you're eating either getting
[59:01] drunk that the Lord's table they
[59:03] misunderstood it you see they just
[59:06] flattened in see just like people doing
[59:08] today just live any kind of life and
[59:10] take it see he said you've got homes to
[59:13] eat and think but this is an ordinance
[59:16] that we should keep seeing now let's let
[59:20] a man examine himself and so let him eat
[59:23] all the bread and drink of the cup for
[59:25] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[59:28] eat it and drink a damnation to himself
[59:31] not Discerning the Lord's body
[59:36] here question amen you live before
[59:39] everybody as a Christian
[59:41] and if you take that and don't live as a
[59:45] Christian you're not Discerning the
[59:46] Lord's body you're putting the stomach
[59:48] back in somebody else's weight see as
[59:50] they see you trying to do that and
[59:52] they're not living what you're supposed
[59:53] to live see you're not Discerning the
[59:55] Lord's body now that's what it what's
[59:57] the curse of it is for this taught us
[59:59] many are weak and sickly among you and
[1:00:02] many are asleep the right translation
[1:00:04] that word bro peria is dead
[1:00:09] for if we for if we would judge
[1:00:14] ourselves we should not be judged that's
[1:00:17] right
[1:00:18] we judge ourselves we will be judged
[1:00:22] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:00:25] out the Lord that we should not be
[1:00:28] condemned with the world see body
[1:00:31] attached to the world wherefore my
[1:00:33] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:00:36] pray one for the other
[1:00:38] see and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:00:43] home that you come knock together into
[1:00:46] condemnation and the rest I will set an
[1:00:49] order when I come see now
[1:00:53] in other words don't just come to take
[1:00:56] it as a as I said a lot of robot talk to
[1:00:58] Jews or sacrifice they it was wonderful
[1:01:01] it's given by God but it got to a place
[1:01:04] where they didn't do it and sincerity in
[1:01:06] reverence in an order then it becomes
[1:01:08] just a it become a stanch in his nose
[1:01:11] now the same thing is the r coming to
[1:01:14] take the Lord's Supper amen that we must
[1:01:18] come knowing what we are doing just like
[1:01:21] when you go into the water to be
[1:01:22] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:01:25] know what you're doing you're putting on
[1:01:28] to the church
[1:01:30] what God has put in you Christ
[1:01:34] when we take this good show to the
[1:01:37] church that I believe every word of God
[1:01:41] I believe that he is the bread of
[1:01:44] bread I believe every word that he says
[1:01:47] is the truth
[1:01:49] and I'll live by you the best of my
[1:01:51] knowledge God being my judge
[1:01:54] therefore before my brothers before my
[1:01:57] sisters are I do not swear I do not
[1:01:59] curse I do not do these things because I
[1:02:02] love the Lord in the Lord knows that
[1:02:04] bears me record therefore before you I
[1:02:07] take the parcel of his body to know that
[1:02:09] I'm not condemned with the world see
[1:02:11] there you are man it's a blessing and
[1:02:14] remember I could give
[1:02:16] Miss monies on this
[1:02:18] were stranded in a sick room yes right
[1:02:21] and seen him healed that's right
[1:02:24] remember when Israel taking the type of
[1:02:28] this they juried 40 years in the
[1:02:31] wilderness and their clothes never even
[1:02:33] wore out and they come out without one
[1:02:35] feeble month of one among them with two
[1:02:37] million people as a type of this well
[1:02:41] what were the antetite do if the body of
[1:02:44] a sacrificial animal did that for them
