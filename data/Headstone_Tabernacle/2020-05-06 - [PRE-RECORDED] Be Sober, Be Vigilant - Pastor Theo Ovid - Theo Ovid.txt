father those that are here those are the connected life with the presence of God go to them heal them and deliver them and use them I ask [Music] hallelujah [Music] we men support best food coming out tonight is so good to be here we want to turn to treat portion of Scripture tonight first one is of Exodus chapter 23 verse 22 23 the next scripture is from first Peter chapter 5 1 reform with 8 to 9 the last cup Jeff from first Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 1 tonight so read an excerpt 23 from verse 20 behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring me into the place which I have prepared the way of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him and if thou wilt shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries for mine angel shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the ammonites and the hittites and the perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hivites and the Jebusites and I will cut them off 1st Peter chapter 8 universe 8 or 9 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world our last scripture from first Thessalonians chapter 5 reading from verse 1 but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night and when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but he Bergeron are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a night as a teeth here all the churn of light and the churn of the day we are not end of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night didn't be drunken are drunken in the night but let us wha of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and when helmet the hope of salvation for God had not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ may God bless his word you may be seated Oh praise I want to take a title from first Peter 5:8 be sober be vigilant that's the title tonight be sober be vigilant supposed to be serious vigilance is keeping careful watch for possible danger and difficulties not the happy-go-lucky anything wounds no but be sober be vigilant you have to be watchful for your own soul o praise the name of the Lord we believe that Alright looking forward to see what the Lord will do tonight and only amplify that first prescriptive read first Peter 5:8 o 9 it says be well-balanced temperate sober in mind be vigilant and porcius at all times for that enemy of yours the devil roams around like a roaring lion in fierce hunger seeking someone to seize upon and devour withstand them be firm in faith against his onset rooted established strong a movable and determined knowing that the same identical sufferings appointed to your Brotherhood the whole body of Christians throughout the world Oh hallelujah hallelujah the prophet a devil is almost harmless unless he had have something to work in you remember those Devils that were cast out of Legion he said they want to do more mischievousness so they wanted to go into the hugs so Devils must have something to work in and somebody to walk through and that's the way God does too he has to have us he is depending on us to work through us Oh glory to God so God is dependent on you he's looking to you really that all glory to God two powers and they are two kingdoms and do you know we have had wars after wars and rumors of wars but if the earth stands we'll have plenty more wars and do you realize that there's only two powers in all the universe of all differences between nations differences between each other and everything it all monks up to two powers there's only two powers there's only two kingdoms two powers two kingdoms and all these magnetons are connected with either one of those powers what you may think is minor is connected to a power or glory they've got this battle they decide on earth this battle isn't shattered in heaven he said the Battle of heaven fell upon earth and the back of angels become the battle of human battles the battle of angel became the battle of men or glory to God and we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities or powers and spiritual wickedness your battle is done against this man and this ankle and this family no is again principalities and powers and demon activity religious spirit church members spirits unclean spirit filthy spirit things like that wrap you and hold you and keep your palm keep your tie the eternal nature or glory that God keep you all natural and Cannell or glory to goddess by your challenge to walk in the spirit to live in the spirit the walk ignorant like a drunk but walk sober as children of the day or glory the core because you have a devil boy in a row those people in the Old Testament had to be led also God brought them in the natural to me understanding that there is something greater than them leading them he hung the pillar fire above them for the understand there was a supernatural oversight over their lives over there coming out and going in so he tell them my angel will go before you or glory to obey his voice listen to him I am releasing supernatural in front of you to the Hittites and their chepa sites and if you obey my voice your enemy will be my enemy you I've literally manniversary or Chloe - cause we have enemies different case you're so nice and you have no enemy you have an enemy he's alive and well tonight he's the enemy of God that's the devil he's walking around like a roaring hungry lion looking to see who you can devour look at the Tonka churches look at the conquer families where I'm gonna be in visions of Devils Oh hallelujah invading churches invading homes invading lives or chlorine of God evolution yet hallelujah praise God but he said be sober be vigilant be on the alert or chlorine accord hallelujah everything goes wouldn't seem nice and dandy when that virus to China hit China

coming it will not not wondering it was comment it was always coming look at America right now scrambling on PPI but tonight be sober be vigilant you know what coming we're not ignorant of the devices of the devil you know what this comment perilous times shall come you know what this coming up rest is coming the engine is coming Oh glory to God the church will be pressed on you know order this coming what kind of people are we to be right now the world looking for science to bring some vaccine for this flu and why in the world looking for that there the church looking for power to stop cancer to stop the place I'm not preaching up in vain you know I'm not saying that just for talk you know I am saying that before that is real it will come to our no vaccine no cure it will take the power of God then the world will know that God of Elijah got live where is the Lord God alive jump Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today forever I am here to believe that doctor God of miracles

became a professing and the dead in the morning our prefer sick and they will they will live - Oh glory to God I'm talking what what God promised a revival we couldn't have a revival God promised our glorious church without spot tomato we don't have such a church God promised a powerful church in the last days but around the Holy Spirit call and call it super Church super race as the narrator has shown super Church super race or glory to God and Jesus on the cross boy principalities and powers guys where they never get lit up did you look up at the cross or glory when he thought that man was just gonna die jeezum was spoiling principalities and powers because to the cross he brought us to reconcile us back to God or glory the cross for us access or access Oh God when he died the veil was rented from the top to the bottom Oh God giving us divine access blood of Jesus oh my God my God hallelujah something is moving in my spirit I bought this old rugged cross that people ignore the people don't even appreciate and value this old rugged cross stained with blood so divine I want just attraction for me Oh glory to God was under crosses where the price was speed is on the cross over the devil was finished he's under crosses where he was defeated because there was a blood price to redeem man and no man was ready to pay that price no angel could appear God wanted blood is that a blood currency or glory the thought and the blood of man was already filthy already so you had to get a virgin blood virgin born no human involved in that or the blood cell was all supernatural so when Christ died it was a supernatural [Applause] because he was hallelujah think about his laughs think about his goodness think about his great supporters o [Music] religious think about this love when you write it with heat well you might think what is love and you have no forgiveness and you have awesome grudge think about his love the boiling crucify him crucify and he only cross the Father forgive them they know not what they do was thinking about the love for you he could have make nobody Dupree that kind of prayer for here watching them Rascals watching the molecules if I'm easy forget that rascal a strong you that bundle but he was thinking about you and his love is what projected the taken beyond the cross the sea beyond the cross and saw the glory of the resurrection his love is what drives him to Calvary it wasn't easy and I'll be calling the garden of gethsemane say if it is possible let this cup pass is one thing to die for a friend they first sinner easy to track is hard to dive a friend but he went beyond for friend he died for his enemies he died for sinners he was dying for people who was against him he died for them no glory does God and God raised him so high good risen above principalities and powers oh god this is good tonight we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and you figure in our angels but Jesus means above them what we can triumph above them principles and powers and you get a connection to above them Devils and get a connection to one who's above principalities and powers so the source of our knowing tell the source of our power the source of our own shock is beyond every principality and power that he sits above every principalities no wonder he stand triumphant tonight or glory you're

that no one carries you off as spoil or make you yourself captive by so-called philosophy and intellectual and vain deceit which is idle fantasies and plain nonsense following human traditions which is men's ideas of material rather than the spiritual world just crude notions following the rudimentary an elemental teaching of the universe and disregarding the teachings of Christ the Messiah I know men was philosophically years ago they love the same thing the Prophet did not say the same as in their own way so we know how we didn't rain that we talked about corn we talked about thing we do a snow injury that so because that we care about so we say very tipsy because in that God given direct reference see what they didn't understand these spoken word promises is Dorsia the Lord so you don't need me to explain this and go down a philosophical world or talk about universal principles what kind of values do want the others you like and want to you know that Hindu Muslim Buddha

into Calvary it's Jesus from the Calgary so this gets every night down he he's in pain he's in agony he taught me riding with him when he pray in struggling in fellows killing heavy sleep yes they walk with him but he's not to hide in them he did one ministry than them he work harder than them he's more worried than them and he had to grind true because you have to have the victory before you get a victory all them fighters fight the victory for they were nearing all the doctors that's why I'll be waiting in the South Boston second round I'll knock yo they have to fight it in the mind so Jesus had a fighter in his mind and in dear but I Branham call it the arrow is ready Lion of the tribe of Judah prevailed was Nani crossing over they're gonna get cemani going he finished it it was done Oh chlorine is what not if it is possible at this path though he finished by that no he no way he was going he knew what he was doing he'd know that Alixe was involved he not his pain but he was

perverted power of God it's a provision of God's power everything season has debt is a polluted life a lie is a treatment old adultery is a righteous act misused everything the season has got is something that was perverted but it's a power so you can say he had no power it's a power but a polluted power so sittin dwelled in the realm of pavillion whenever you find a provision perverted thoughts mind and attitude and behavior is satanic because that is where he realm like when he dwells oh my / Gideon hallelujah and this is where my mom said sin did not originate in it it originated in heaven and it was thrown down from heaven cast out to heaven to the earth and fell on human pinions then the battle from angels became human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself Satan come to destroy this and that is what his purpose was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and begin in US and has been region ever since this great battle that started on it they had to be a mutual meeting place they had to be a play selected for the battle to begin and for the back of the range and the battleground beginner the human mind that is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was begin and that is because decisions are made from the mind the head it never start from some organization they never started in some mechanical affair oh my Oh glory to God something has to happen on the inside he says your mind accepts it the word it grasp it what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the wood of God and that's the thing that got life in it it brings life into you brother what takes place then the life come tongues and that channel into you the Word of God is manifested in you and that's why the Prophet said we're gonna play something he says when the invisible become visible then God is manifested so this battle of angels that has become human battles you will begin to see this warfare in the physical realm so when Jesus cast the devil out the people saw a supernatural power being defeated by the power of God when Jesus opened the blind eye that was Jesus uncovering blindness that belonged to Satan and bring insight when Jesus brought Lazarus from the grave that was the power of God conquering debt ensuring that life is more powerful than debt and even though Satan could snatch that young girl and bring it the dead Jesus could snatch it back or glory of God the man that was crippled he could tell the man Street now look at those guys who brought their friend and open up the roof and drop the friend down oh my dick couldn't come in him didn't leave but the bringing it wasn't another ambulance and they bring it they walk with him a nut crunch and the crowd was all wrong the bus true and they let him know but here comes a batter the devil have another condition and God is standing there and they watching to see
