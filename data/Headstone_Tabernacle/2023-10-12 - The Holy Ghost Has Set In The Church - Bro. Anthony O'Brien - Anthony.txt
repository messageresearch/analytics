with Liberty amen we thank God for his presence amen so God bless you uh thank you so much musicians thank you so much brother Steve Mo amen tonight for the song service so as we switch over now to the word amen we certainly would like to um acknowledge the Lord this evening and if you have your Bibles we like to turn uh to two portion of scripture um first in Ephesians 4 11-13 and then also to Revelation 3 and and verse 12 amen first scripture reading so praise God uh Ephesians 4 and verse 11 and we know it and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the me measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen and moving over to Revelation 3 and just one verse there verse 12 brother Shane if you could just raise that monitor up again uh that that would uh that was pretty good actually Revelation 3 and: 12 says uh him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write on uh upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down from Out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name may God have blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow our heads almighty God we thank you Lord to be in your presence one more time tonight Lord we come now to Lord to to to Rally around your word father to sit at your feet as it will father and to hear from you tonight Lord I pray that for a few moments Lord as we lord as we get Lord into the spirit of your the coming of the Lord Lord that you would your anointing would come down in a special way and bless our hearts Lord father minister to us Lord to our lives oh god father help us to see what you're calling us onto Lord Jesus Lord that we could uh uh uh get ourselves Lord father ready Lord father for your soon coming prepare Lord for the appearing Lord father of your son Jesus Christ Lord may I have your way tonight Lord father and bless each one as we lord as we wait upon you Lord and as we look to you father may you anoint your word and Inspire to our hearts Lord father a fresh fall Upon Us in a special way Lord in however way you choose we give you all the glory and H onor tonight in Jesus name amen and amen praise God you may have your seats well welcome one and all tonight amen once more praise God it's good to be in his presence good to be in his house sir amen amen we don't take it for granted and hallelujah amen and we we just happy to be here amen amen praise God praise God so we're here laboring in the vineyard and I suppose we want to especially keep um our pastor in prayer as he uh going off into the fields in in India and uh pray that God would bless the Brethren there amen for the convention they want to have by the grace of God Amen and we know that where the spirit of the Lord is and where where where uh people are gathered God always does something amen he always meets that expectation praise God so may God bless the Brethren there and you continue to remember them in your hearts amen as we continue on tonight well praise God we uh thank God for his presence so I have a title tonight amen just for a few moments as we uh earnestly contend for the faith amen I have a title the Holy Ghost has set in the church that's my title tonight amen the Holy Ghost has set in the church amen and I'm taking that directly out of that quote that we all know from adoption 1960 the prophet says here how that God has s some in the church through the labor pains oh they get tremendous sometime but when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world so God's going to bring on a persecution that's going to bring on a groaning amen and that church has got to groan through that isn't that right Hallelujah God's people have always been persecuted throughout the years amen isn't that right persecution on the outside world Believing on the Lord Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains oh but when they are born and positionally born so the prophet bringing out two births here first born and then positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then he says the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists he said and then he give into there speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing and all kinds of Miracles amen amen do you believe it tonight praise God hallelujah so I chose for title the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost has set in the church and I know many times we read this quote amen and we go over it and we enjoy it but there's a word I wanted to zero in on and that word is to set praise God the Holy Ghost has set in the church praise God Amen isn't that right yes sir he set in the church hallelujah praise God and to set means to play something in a fixed position in order to establish it can we say Amen right hallelujah hallelujah God set you up oh Hallelujah god Set you in there praise God hallelujah amen isn't that right so it fixs of being it it speaks of being in a fixed position and that is what we are stressing and striving to get into now that's what all this fuss is about for us to get into our place in Christ into our position in Christ God actually wants to set you in there amen isn't that right you come in sometimes your state is variable you're up one day and you're down the next not every day is a wonderful day some days you have good days and some days you have bad days isn't that right some days you feel happy and some days you feel sad some days you feel angry but what we talking about is fulfillment what we are talking about is purpose oh hle because happiness could come sadness could come and go happiness could come and go those are just fleeting moments but what you are are striving to get into tonight is to find your purpose in God oh it's to find your position in God is to find out what God has for you to do hey for you to do your job and for you to do it well and for you to run your way like Paul said I run my race I finished the course I did the thing that God sent me to do oh Hallelujah now there's a crown laid up for me to them that overcome it they will go no more out oh but God has a fixed place for you to be in tonight oh and that place is your position that place is your inheritance that place is where God has for you tonight oh somebody say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah can we give him praise tonight Glory Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] so I feel this is very important amen because it's like the desire God has a desire friends Hallelujah a deep desire for you to find your place because remember man fell out of place when he was in the Garden of Eden isn't that right and he took up the tree of knowledge and so for like that and when man fell through Eve and Adam and everything that happened there what happened man fell out of his place isn't that right so now God's desire for you and I here tonight is to find back get back to that place get back to that place where you once was amen amen before there was a moon before there was a star God has a place for you God actually predestinated a place for you to be whatever that place is God knows what that place is I can't place you but the Holy Ghost is what set in the church some Apostles some prophets God has a place for you oh Hallelujah isn't that right God will adopt the farmer he'll adopt the housewife he'll adopt the maids oh Hall adopt the women the men the husbands the wives oh hallelujah praise God adoption is for you tonight if you could walk by faith oh Hal a closer walk with the oh Hallelujah a closer walk with Christ on that third P third phase Hallelujah is that right then you can come into this positional placing so that's why I feel tonight amen that God has a desire for this it's almost like a father wanting to have a desire for his children to come into their own to come into their own and begin to understand things so we can have deeper conversations with them they can't talk to a 5-year-old about real estate they don't understand that they're not at that Neville they don't understand that they can't impart that kind of knowledge to them but when they grow up and they learn a few things and they experience a few things and they get through a few difficulties and challenges and situations and they learn how to manage finances now you can have deeper conversations with them oh Hallelujah now you can understand why the Bible said be no more children tossed to and fro by every wind of Doctrine oh Hallelujah but for you to come into the fullness of the stature of the measure of Christ oh Hallelujah that's what God wants for you for you to be growed up in Christ amen for you to make the kind of decisions that would make the father please oh Hallelujah H say here is my spirit here is my son here is my daughter I am pleased to dwell with them I am pleased to dwell with him I am pleased to dwell with her oh Hallelujah because about everything else they chose love they chose a more excellent way oh above all that they could do they decide to choose forgiveness they decide to choose repentance they decide to choose Hallelujah because of the nature in them that's reflecting Christ amen amen you could make the kind of choices and decisions that will make the father proud amen that's what I believe that's what we want to come into praise God that's the desire that God has for God to positionally place his church praise God Amen and every member of the body would find their place isn't that right remember the prophet talking about how he looking up at the stars one night and he saw all the stars in their place every Star was in its place and he was reflecting talking about how in Noah's day that if the moon was ever to change course or Direction it would affect how the water or the tides would move on the earth isn't that right everything has to be in its place and and brother Brown said if that great Celestial body if the stars has to be in its place then that's what the church have to come into that condition where you could find your place in Christ amen amen hallelujah where you could find your position oh you could stand in your office in your seat praise God the one that God ordained for you to stand in because when you come into that position no devil could stand before you no devil could deny you praise God Amen oh you have a right to everything oh hallelujah amen isn't that right so that's the condition I feel God wants us to come into as a desire for us to do that so right now we in this variable State up one day down the next and and that's all for a season because it's a season of molding in that time you're you're you're you're you're you're going through things through phases he can't set you yet because you're not right yet to be set if you understand what I'm saying you're not right to be fitted in it's like the Box Car the man come around sealing the box cars He shake it first to see if it's ready to take sealing if he shake that and the packages in there not R if it's rattling if it's Out Of Tune you say pack it over again because it needs to be properly before it can be sealed but that's how your life is you can't have things rattling you can't have things shaking you can't have things loose it's got to be right in order to be sealed oh and God wants to seal you up but you've got to get right first you got to get everything lined up with the scripture you got to get your life lined up with the word in order for you to be set in the church in the position that God has for you to be in Hallelujah isn't that right do you believe it and this church we're talking about is not this physical building church it's not even this group the church we talking about is a mystical Body of Christ my one Spirit we baptized into that church and God sets you in there the holy ghost sets you in there amen he places you positionally praise God as whatever you supposed to be in the body isn't that right and each part will work according to his effectual uh working praise God according to his power isn't that right oh my so God set some in the church through their labor pains but then the Holy Ghost come he come around the end of the quote he said that the Holy Ghost come and set the chch set in the church this Ephesians uh Ministry that we're looking for isn't that right so this is where we at friends so now so to set means to fix to establish isn't that right 2 Peter 1: 12 12 says wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them but to be established in he said the present truth oh Hallelujah so Peter had a desire amen hall for the people to be established in the present truth amen isn't that right to be established in other in other words you drive a Stak in the ground and establish something establish the truth amen stand for the truth or obey the truth doesn't matter if other people aren't doing it it doesn't matter you have a divine revelation from God what the truth is and because you have a revelation you can stand on what God Said oh somebody help me say oh Hallelujah somebody help me tonight amen oh hallelujah hallelujah you can stand on what God said because it's a established it's a truth it's the truth and you're standing on it isn't that right oh my so to set in the church God wants to set you in there right now watch he said now watch now 2 Peter 1:13 he said yay I think it meat for as long as I'm in this Tabernacle Peter says to stir you up by putting you in remembrance so that's what they're here to do tonight we're here to stir you up oh to get on fire for God oh how to get on fire in your homes in your prayer closets in your life and put you in remembrance of these things praise God because we don't have all the time in the world Peter knew that he was going to die so he put this word in Earnest so that you could remember these things so that you could be stirred up so that you could get on fire for God so that you can get desperate oh and don't waste the time that you have here on Earth oh Hallelujah but spend the time with God every day getting closer to your goal closer to your target closer to your inheritance closer to finding your place in Christ oh you have to get a burden friends hallelujah oh Hallelujah not about Jo joining church people leave groups leave churches join the next Church they don't like this one they don't like the pastor they don't like the group they don't like the choir they don't like the plants they don't like the color the wall they don't like the pews they don't like the car pack you wonder what they really come for isn't that right but you got to find of uh have a revelation of what you're coming there for why do you come to this church here is it just to occupi space is it just to occupy a Pew is it just to warm a bench or is it to do you have a purpose beyond that oh because despite the experiences you have in this natural life there's nothing that can ever come close to that spiritual goal that God put in your heart for you to attain oh Hallelujah sure we have bad experiences sure we have up days and down days but there's a purpose in God that puts everything else to as side everything else is a distraction when you see your purpose in God oh do you believe it everything else is a distraction when you see your purpose in God oh Hallelujah Hall give me a scripture to talk about Elisha praise God when Elijah dropped the mantle upon Elisha he had a goal in his heart he had to get the spirit of the Elijah that was upon that mantle and God put it in his heart oh Hallelujah God put it upon God's servant Elijah to pass by there and Elijah was just an ordinary guy plowing the field and doing his thing and doing his 9 to5 and paying his taxes and paying his court bills and pay in his mortgage but all of a sudden he had an experience a prophet came by and Dro a mantle upon him and we were having a natural experience on this world going to and fro going to school going here going there and God allow Malachi 4 to come your way and give you a higher touch a higher call speak to your heart something inside of you shake oh H never experienced it before you never heard nothing like this before H what do you do you burn the auction you burn everything El behind you and you come out to follow Jesus you come out to follow that anointing because that is what you want oh is that what you want tonight is that what you come out here for I didn't come all this way praise God that's a warmer bench I come to put my shoulder towards a real for Revival I come to worship I come to praise God oh if I die tomorrow I want to come in here tonight and worship my God and stand up and worship and praise him and shout and scream and cry oh Hallelujah and get the Holy Ghost oh this world is not my home I'm just passing through here oh my home is in glory I come from Glory I go back to Glory oh somebody say Amen oh Hallelujah that's what you got to know that's what you got to believe and that's what drives you come in here and worship your God oh hallelujah we're not here to be lectured to come on now worship him we're not here to just be occupy space come on now worship him we not just here to hang around and just St oh hallelu we here to get in the spirit so that God could speak to us get in the spirit so that God could anoint us and Inspire us and shake the fragments of our very being oh hle until we heard the word from the Lord oh we don't want to be the same no more oh Hallelujah be no more children tossed to and fro by every wind of Doctrine there's Winds of Doctrine out there friends sweeping the people here sweeping them there sweeping them to this group huh this group have the anointing this group don't have the angel this group have this group have that when you see what the real vision of Malachi 44 to produce puts all those silly things away friends now you see the real prize at the end of the road and you are zero on that Target just like elishah was zeroed on his Target when he felt a mantle touch him amen oh how went past beel he went past gilga he went past the school of the prophets he went past a whole bunch of intellectuals who was there in the message long and telling them don't you know your MK will be taken away from you today he say I know it but hold your peace in other words shut up devil I know what I come for I know what I come to church for I come for my Mountain I come for my inheritance I come for my place in Christ I come for the Holy Ghost I come to get baptized doesn't matter if nobody else wants it I want my pit I want my portion I want to be filled I want to be sealed I want to be anointed I want to be inspired I know what I have to face tomorrow morning in work so I need a holy spirit a d of the Holy Spirit upon my soul to deal with the Devils to deal with the demons that is out there with for me tomorrow morning oh come on now the enemy hallelujah oh it's planning he's [Music] fluting this battle is not against flesh and blood this battle is against principalities Powers spiritual wickedness in high places trying to drag your soul to hell oh get on fire for God take your stand with God and find your place in Christ tonight Hallelujah we got to fight friends fight for the anointing fight for the presence of God fight for prayer fight for this word fight for everything he said he promised to deliver he promised to restore he promised to baptize he promised a seal now what are we going to do about it we've got to fight brother we got to fight with all that in us we got to come in here with a war in spirit lifting our hands up standing up in the sanctuary close eyes and shout and give God praise and love him with all your heart and all your soul and welcome him oh Hallelujah as his Spirit comes down to fill you with his [Applause] Spirit hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Set Me Free glory to God hallu Amen that's why I can't stay silent that's why I get every opportunity to come to the house of God I come I shout praise God I don't know if this is my last service I'm going to give him 100% doesn't matter if it's a Wednesday night a Friday night a Saturday night Praise Him anyhow the devil took my home he took my money took this but he can't take my praise he could take the shoes off my feet he can rip the belt off my waist but he cannot take my praise oh Hallelujah my Praise My Worship belongs to God tonight oh it doesn't belong to the devil he never gave me nothing oh Hallelujah that's worth anything was God that saved me I'll praise the god that saved my soul I'll worship the god that made me whole Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah I won't stay silent amen not after all he's done for me not after all he seen me through not after all he's seen me through with my son and my daughter and my children not after all he's seen me through oh Hallelujah people could have died along the way but God saved them God redeemed them oh Hallelujah Mercy stood in the Gap oh hallelujah oh between death and life oh Hallelujah and the God hallelujah that loved you made a way for you oh I come to praise him tonight I come to worship him tonight I come to praise him and tell him all that he is oh [Music] Hallelujah so don't get weary friend friends we still have our ways to go God wants to set you in the church set you in there God actualizes himself as many things isn't that right sometimes he's a lamb a lion a dove isn't that right but one of the most interesting characteristics of God is when he comes down in the form of fire that's the most interesting characteristic to me because when you talk about this setting in the church hallelujah it's almost God wants to actually burn something down in there that when it's fixed it does not come out when you fix it down inside there and you burn it down inside there that ain't coming out again oh that's what God wants to do with you you're up one day you're down the next but when God Burns something down there inside of your soul it's fixed not coming out anymore oh hallelujah hallelujah God wants to set you tonight tonight in your place in your position as a Son of God as a daughter of God in the kingdom of God hallelujah representing all that God is all of his love all of his power all of his blessings God wants to set you in there as a pillar and you go no more out you are set in there by fire Holy Ghost Fire come in your soul and burn something down inside of you oh Hallelujah you can't be the same again you can't go back to be normal you can't go back to being human you have Supernatural take over and burn something in your soul Fire coming there Hallelujah fire caramelizes it does aall a unique job it does something water cannot do it does something sand and wind cannot do fire hallu actually distorts Hallelujah and forms and and and formalizes and sets conditions hallu fire does that hallu when Fire Hits it you have to break that thing out today to get out God praise God and what God established no man can remove isn't that right this is not man's fire it's God's fire when God's fire does the job oh H but it's better than any that we could scratch together brother amen that's what we want tonight call on the fire of God Holy Ghost Fire is what sets in the church some Apostles but it's a process T that Prophet talk about labor pains isn't that right and he said they get tremendous sometimes laboring why because you're bringing forth something isn't that right I remember take taking pictures of my wife when she was having her her children our children isn't that right Ezra and Eden and clearly you could see there's a difference when the child is in the womb and when the child comes out isn't that right in the womb the child is veiled in there all right you can't see anything all right it's mysterious all you know that that bump is getting larger it's getting bigger and something in it is forming you don't know how it forming all you do is praying in the night you praying at all the fingers and toes and on all the spinal column in the right place but that is up to God you put that in God Hand and say God I trust you oh Hallelujah and you just praying praise God H that the life in her will come out the right way oh hallelujah hallelujah H isn't that right but it's a journey that a woman takes H to bring a child into the world takes a long time takes 9 months for it to form oh and all of a sudden there come the time for labor pains oh H the prophet said they get tremendous sometimes oh Hallelujah Hal groaning crying screaming oh Hall discomfort something in them is moving the water bag has already burst and some is ready to press out dilation not all the whole process oh the whole bloody thing but that's a process that it takes to bring a Manchild into the world and God typed this thing as labor pain oh oh Hallelujah come on now in other words it's ins of there something wants to come out there's got to be a difference and when it's in there and when it comes out oh somebody help me preach somebody help me shout somebody help me praise God there's going to be a difference friends there's going to be a difference when that Ephesians come on the scene it'll be no more veil in there oh but it'll be unveil he's going to show the whole world what this product is bringing forth Christ in this end time something's going to come out a great blood show outc comes a baby out comes a life oh H that's what we have to produce the Life of Christ amen isn't that right faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance we're actually going to produce that but it's not going to come easy it's going to come by labor pains labor pains labor pains groaning crying under the persecution from the outside world cuz they don't believe it like you do they don't understand it like you do oh but you caught a revelation hallelujah amen is that right of what you have to do am once God show you what you have to do trust me you're not responsible for what anybody else says all the gainsayers they could go hit left they could go to the right amen you know what God showed you gave you a revelation of what you had to bring forth when Mary got her revelation of course she stands a reproach she was supposed to be married what she doing fooling around as it were that's what they thought anyway they thought she was fooling around but they didn't know she had an encounter with the Supernatural and that is what made the difference and that is why this bump inside me is growing but not anything I did is what called ordained oh Hall we stand a reproach to this all these years something inside you growing nothing that you did for yourself something that God did for you oh moving from Jacob Grace on Joseph affection oh Hallelujah nothing against Joseph it was God working his way out working his way out of you Faith working his way out virtue working his way out knowledge working his way out adding adding adding until we get seven things oh H perfect statue amen all hands and fingers and toes in the right place oh Hallelujah can we give the Lord a shout of praise amen TR the process he's got it under control but we now our job is to strive to enter into these things to be positionally placed Hallelujah got to sat down long enough to let the let it have an effect on our lives amen isn't that right Hallelujah the prophet talk about laying in the presence of the sun until we get riped and B all the greenness out of us Pi all the intellect CH out of us B out all the all the carnality all the things of the world trusting on this and trusting on that after everything is Stripped Away you have to learn to trust in Jesus you have to learn to trust in God H isn't that right you're like a ship out at se the only thing you can trust is the anchor down there when you look left is Storm when it look right is Storm when it look forward is Storm when it look back is Storm what can they trust the only thing they have left is the anchor down there that's holding to that Solid Rock oh and then sometime God get you in that kind of condition the waves are contrary the wind is contrary when you look left there's no help when you look right there's no help where can you trust the only way Hallelujah is the anchor down there anching you down in faith anchoring you to Christ faith in what he said Hallelujah faith in his promised word isn't that right oh my wow thank you Lord hallelu well okay so we can skip all this I think we I think the word is God home all right hallu should I read this here okay let's go to Paradox so watch Prophet said here vers uh paragraph 89 we know this but I'm just reading for context tonight because we I want to drive this in but we're promised according to Revelation 10 and according to Malachi 4 and St Luke 22:17 and so forth that there's God to come and Ephesians to this amen there is promis it friends the prophet said there must come and Ephesians to these Sevenfold Mysteries of the word of God must be unfolded and it's in the loud deian age that this takes place and I believe that we're there isn't that right so the sful mysteres of the word had to come in there a revelation of how to go of how to uh translation Faith isn't that right seven tunders seven voices seven Church ages isn't that right a revelation come in there show you what you how to prepare show you how to get ready for his soon coming isn't that right oh Hallelujah and then it's going to come into a manifestation because God call you out of loud decent age to make up the headstone between brotherly kindness and love there was a gap there isn't that right but by revelation we understand that God caps this pyramid hallelujah it's a seven T of a caps isn't that right Hallelujah isn't that right so as we come up through laia praise God got to H stones out of Leia to fit up into that bright age that Holy Spirit so that we could catch the headstone which is love coming down Hallelujah he can't come down on brotherly kindness love wants to come down on something so God had to call a group out Hallelujah to make up the headstone so he can come into it and finish it the Cornerstone become the chief of the corner he come and he kep the whole thing isn't that right oh my so watch um where was I right so Ephesian to this got to come in Ephesian to this right had to come back to another original church just like it had a Pentecost isn't that right praise God that's what Christ will come down upon Hallelujah not this loud this age but it's already SP over his mouth isn't that right but he calling a bride out of that sir to make up the headstone and that's who you here are tonight that's why we've got to fight and strive with everything in us to find our place in Christ hallelujah hallelujah praise God so that we could do the work that he sent for us to do and each one of us have a job in there Hallelujah I can't tell you what it is God will reveal it he will show it you just walk with him praise God H and as you walk more will unfold as you walk more will unfold isn't that right Oh my he said I believe we're right in the shadows of the coming of the son of God and as Joshua just before the Ephesians raise up so did John the Baptist raise up just before the next Ephesians yes he said and then we promise another another Ephesians is predicted here in scripture therefore he said I think that we are living in the Ephesians again says it here back again to he said we promise that what was left off those through those uh Seven Ages he said now you can't add nothing to the book or take nothing from it Revelation 2218 says so who will ever add one word or take one word his part will be taken from the book of life now we cannot add or take see so therefore we know that Luther Luther couldn't get into it Wesley and so forth the reformers KNX finny Calvin on down so forth they didn't get it all but when they what they had was the Gospel truth amen amen amen isn't that right they had the truth for their age isn't that right but it all add up because when you look down you see what he was doing all the way coming up isn't that right and it took a profit at the end time to reveal what God was doing all throughout those ages when we didn't understand isn't that right my God so he says now in the last days we're given to understanding by the word he said that we're going to understand it because it will come an Ephesian age to it oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen so your promise to understand it friends there comeing Ephesians AG it it will be revealed it'll come out of the womb praise godall and you'll see it for what it is Christ in his fullness Hallelujah when it's in the womb it's a mystery a mystery something coming out you're not sure but you're groaning you're crying you're praying you're pressing looking for it to come forth but when it comes out it's undeniable brother oh hallelujah it's a real life baby brother praise God it's a real reproduction a genuine image amen coming out of the amen into the open praise God Amen then the Holy Spirit come down and say Here's uh is my beloved Son my beloved daughter praise God they've come through the processes amen amen isn't that right you can't hide that under a Bushell now praise God Amen that comes out into the open praise God the whole world will know that you had been with Jesus because you'll be written Epistles read of all men praise God do you believe it tonight so we're going to understand it it come to Ephesians 8 to8 I we here now he said now a paradox he said now I'll leave that let that hang because I just got about 10 more minutes and then we have the prayer line praise God Amen Hallelujah so he left it there prophecy so we got to come to this isn't that right amen oh my oh my so when I thought about set in the church the inspiration come to me about The Potter's House amen isn't that right how God took his servant down to The Potter's House isn't that right Hallelujah and when God was molding the when the Potter was molding the clay isn't that right shaping it forming it changing it spinning it on the wheel Hallelujah we are the clay tonight and he is the Potter taking the clay of our lives and he is molding it wetting it shaping it into something isn't that right so you have to go through a process in order to come out the way he wants you to come out and sometimes it's not what you like but it's what he needs for you to go through right now in order for you to become a vessel of Honor you have to go through the process oh Hallelujah a process that shapes you a process that molds you a process that bends you oh and if you get broken if you spin off the wheel don't worry nothing nothing is is cast in stone just yet God can still pick up the pieces of your life and put them back together again and spin you back on that wheel oh Hallelujah isn't that right Pottery is amazing to look at praise God whether you're looking at it up close or uh on on YouTube I had the privilege of doing both and it's so interesting to see how the Potter does it some sometimes just take a finger and just do so and the whole shape change so he take a few fingers and do this wet his hands and and the whole thing goes up it goes down he puts his hand inside it Bellows out into a bowl he's shaping he's forming he's molding it's such a mysterious process mysterious because the Potter knows what he's going to create amen isn't that right the clay cannot say I am this I am this amen isn't that right just like Paul says no he has to put his his life in the hands of the Potter and the Potter has to shape it into something that'll be worth anything you think we worth anything we were just clay when we were found we were lumpy we were without form we were void praise God we was all confused but God pulled you out sifted you out from the world and pulled you out and begin to do something in your life begin to form a process on you brother when you come out that process you will not look like the way you started oh when God is finished with you you'll be a vessel of Honor you'll have the power to carry something in you oh [Applause] he is a Potter you are the clay shapes you and molds you I love it because he has an image in his mind he knows exactly what you're supposed to look like so if it's not coming out right he'll stop the wheel he'll take it off try again start over but it has to come out right brother I want to be in the hands of the Potter because he knows what I'm supposed to to look like oh don't put your hands in the world friends put your hands in the hands of the Potter oh Hallelujah Hal let him mold you let him shape you let him apply his wisdom his love his knowledge upon your life that you could come into a vessel of Honor isn't that right fit for the Master's use and when you go through all those processes the best part is the end partant because they come out right it shaped everything and it's neat and clean looking no zigzags no cross lines outside smooth and everything what's it ready for now it's ready for baking it's ready for fire it's ready for a process that's going to set it in a certain condition and once it's set it can't go back to being clay oh Hallelujah it can't go back to that old Ruddy condition oh Hallelujah and God wants to set you tonight oh God want to put you through a process to mold you to shape you that's why you bypass Hallelujah your theophany and you come on in this world to be tested to be tried to be proven oh to go through trials to go through testings to go through heartaches so that God could form you that God could shape you oh Hallelujah could shape your life a certain way so that you could go through a process so that at the end when he send his fire you are set in there oh Hallelujah and the devil can't take you out when you're set in there the world can disate you when you're set in there nothing that happens oh no life no death no persecution no trial no height no depth could ever separate you from the love of God because fire done set you down in there and you're permanently fixed hallelujah hallelujah you go no more out but you made a pillar in the house of your God because you overcome the devil and All His angels praise God hallelujah and he set you in there by fire by fire in the oven of God's character process hallelujah oh glory to God Amen oh I'm so excited hallelujah hallelujah is that what God going to pass us through yes don't afid it just trust him when you come out come out looking right come out shining praise God come out better than you was when you started Hallelujah God is able to make something out of nothing he does it all the time isn't that right and the the clay it calls for surrender surrending yourself to a process of being molded shaped isn't that right Hallelujah and then fire sets it in its place in its form and structure whatever it's supposed to be sets that form can't break it can't bend after that isn't that right see so amen all right okay so three kind of Believers Prophet said here that's the reason I do believe he said that when the bride is called out and elected and set in The Book of Life Prophet said there will come a sound from Heaven oh that'll take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride that will take her from the earth in a rapturing Grace oh hallelujah hallelujah when she's called elected and when she's set in that book of life they'll come a sound from Heaven oh Hallelujah that's what we promised friends glory god promis it don't care how many s science how many astronauts they signed up and

change me that can rearrange me that can transform me that can give me power give me the love I need oh in this world of hate and sorrow and shame is the only one can Release Me From shame Release Me From guilt only Jesus does it Jesus alone amen amen amen hallelujah you have many programs to try to reform people back into society but only Jesus to transform your life transform you from old lumpy clay into a vessel of honor fit for the Master's use amen amen my there is a heaven there's a literal Jesus Christ there and that will come in a body to form to receive his church to himself amen that's right the prophet say Amen no matter how old that story seems no matter our old fashion praise God it is still the truth he said God said so and that is what the Believers believe are you a Believer tonight then that's what we believe that the holy ghost that Mary receive the same holy ghost that Peter received oh Hallelujah the James and all of them praise God in the upper room

out power upon you praise God before those terrible plages strike he'll set you in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers that's his desire oh he loves to see you come into a state of understanding Hall oh Hallelujah he want you to be confident he want you to be confident about your Christianity you he want you to pray with confidence come boldness Before the Throne knowing that you're a child of God and that you could open the fridge if you want praise God you could park in the parking lot oh everything the father has is yours too oh come on now let's get a better attitude

rights are what their abilities are be confident about it get stronger as you get to the Finish Line because more confidence and faith is being poured into you praise God more knowledge is being poured into you and as God sends his love gives to us along the way towards the resurrection an entrance will be ministered to you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of Our Lord Jesus Christ to pour strength into you to pour Grace into you Hallelujah that you can run your race oh the race that is set before us amen hallelujah and help one of two brothers along the way nothing wrong with that praise God Amen We're All in This Together isn't that right my all right hallelujah hallelujah uh the uncertain sound okay Prophet said any man the woman that's born of the spirit of God knows where they stand regardless of what takes place oh how many yeses how many NOS he said they know where they stand the prophet said there's no uncertain sound Hallelujah he said a man who possesses it the woman who possesses it he said oh what a blessed person they are he said no wonder David said when they were blessed they were blessed person lay him up on the operating table try to cut the blessing out of them you'll never find it he said he said it's a hidden power Prophet said here it's a hidden something oh God hide something down inside of you they try to cut it out they try to boil it touch they try to hang you upside down they can't get it out of you it's a hidden power it's a hidden something Tong in the heart deep in my heart I still believe that we shall overcome one of these days and though the skin LS destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I seek God for myself and not another oh Hallelujah We Shall Behold Him oh Hallelujah you're going to receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you amen We Believe down in our hearts is a hidden power a hidden something oh but it's there he said watch he said every man and woman that ever had it they knew they got it oh nobody had to tell them about it nobody had to intellectualize them into it huh no un certainty about it he said every man that's born of the spirit of God knows when he's passed from Death onto life he knows the place knows the hour he knows the minute but BR knocks the pulpit Hallelujah When Death changed your life when unbelief of the Bible change to believe in every word of it he knows when it's

Fire hallelujah hallelujah some people fear it but we love it we need it God send us a fire in the age where they feel like there's almost no anointing left oh God we cry send the fire oh and that early church fire was falling all the time praise God the prophet said now this you can hardly find the spirit of God anywhere and yet the people are not crying out for it oh Hallelujah give us a cry to get in the spirit a passion to know the word for desire to please him oh my all right uh where was I right said uh he knows when Hy highminded things pass on unto humble Christians they know when that pass onto life amen he said every man that had it had something different oh he said the world knew it every woman had it had something different and the world knew it the world could see it your actions prove what you are I love that oh how your actions prove what you are people say a lot of stuff people talk a lot they bum their gum but when they go out there and do the things some of them lack the capacity Hallelujah to do the right thing especially when no one's looking hallel he told Peter you'll deny me praise God when the clock crows isn't that right Halle but after you're converted strengthen the Brethren he knew Peter didn't have it in him Hallelujah when the Press come down he couldn't handle it he curse and carry on and so forth isn't that right but when he come out the upper room different brother Peter when he come on the upper room these people are not drunk as you suppose fire falling all over the place people being healed people being healed in the shadow people being seal different brother Peter praise that the Holy Ghost makes a difference the Holy Ghost set him in the church and he'll set you in the church also by the same process of Holy Ghost and Fire oh hallelujah hallelujah and you'll go no more out H Peter was a fire baptized Christian till the day he died his very last breath what God singed down inside there in the upper room it remained it remained it remained throughout tile Tempest Temptation Peril isn't that right remain in there the bride we have many many things to go through isn't that right Prophet said we be 100 persecuted group that is yet to come you think your human Spirit going to handle that you can't it take the Holy Ghost to make you really stand on this because when that come down brother got to have something inside of there that's this hidden something we're talking about tonight is what's got to rise to the surface just like when the prophet was only going to kill himself said something in him said the Lord give the Lord Tak it away his intellect had done break down already devil had him on the ropes ready to take his life ready to pull the trigger but something inside of him had to rise up and Conquer The Devil had to bat the devil over his head praise God and give him a victory isn't that right and that's the same God got to come for you praise God you can't do it in your human Spirit when we talk about this pyramid this is not a human this is Supernatural Hallelujah and you are promised to come to this kind of a condition oh Hallelujah we can man manest Faith manifest virtue manifest Temperance manifest knowledge manifest all these seven things praise God hallelujah praise God and begin to live a different life yes sir a Christ life amen and people will take note that you have been with Jesus amen amen cuz you couldn't do that for yourself amen I come in one way and I come out different praise God oh my went through a process right change okay Samson he said Samson you actually prove what you are you can say you got it but your action speak so loud Prophet said they can't hear your voice and your life ends up speaking what you are that's it and that's why we have to have that because in this life speaks it'll speak Christ in this life speaks it'll speak the word only Hallelujah nothing else praise God Amen but it'll reflect him and that's what we want to that's what we need to have rather Amen in this end time amen Samson he was a manp possessed with it and know a lot of people try to make Samson a great man at Big shoulders he said uh and go up and pick the gates of the city no he said he said that's no great mystery to see a man do that he said Samson was not a big man at all Prophet said all the scripture declares him to be a little shrimp a little bitty fellow and he was blessed why he was born that way he said that's the way you get blessed is when you're born that way not when some priest bless you or when some preacher baptizes you but when God by the Holy Spirit he said gives the new birth he said then you are born a child of God oh oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory you're born into the kingdom of God Amen God God don't get old scrap iron parts and put you together praise God there's a new thing he want us to do inside of you praise God Amen Hallelujah isn't that right you're born in there amen and then Samson he said talk about Samson Samson let it in him it wasn't Samson so he let so Sams Samson let go and he let whatever it was take over is basically what he's saying is that right and it wasn't Samson it was the hidden power in him the prophet said it isn't some magic word it isn't rubbing a rabbit foot behind your ears not spitting on a horseshoe or throwing it over that makes the magic it isn't that isn't what makes a man live a different life no more than joining church or putting your name on a book or being baptized look what the equated to trying to do something to get favor with God isn't that right amen he said but what makes a man is when God by a birth gives him the hidden power and blesses him by the holy spirit in his life on what makes him what he is Prophet said and then Samson walked out there the lion come towards him oh my the lion was going to get him a little curly-headed shrimp about like that about seven little uh locks and so forth locks hanging from his shoulders he said he was a weakling he was a he was a dwarf like every man is out there God he said but yes but all at once when that Lon got ready to get him the hidden power come out Prophet said and the Holy Ghost got on him the Holy Spirit and he grabbed that lion and slew it like it was a lamb praise God hidden power come out oh hallelujah hallelujah do you believe it tonight you got to come into such a condition when the trial come when the testing come when the devil has a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour come to devour you a hidden power could come out to you and Conquer that lion and slow that lion praise God hallelujah amen amen amen amen that's the power in you tonight praise God is that right hidden power God want to put that inside isn't that right oh my so he said when you're born right born and positionally born Israel and the church Prophet said I'm coming to a close here amen let me try to wind up oh glory to God do you love him tonight amen amen he said now when you're a while ago when you're a Christian you made a Christian what what made you a Christian he said because God called you before the foundation of the world to be a Christian and you become a Christian amen and then you got saved filled with the Holy Spirit and you got eternal life why did he give you the Holy Spirit he Prophet said as a seal of your faith you had had Faith first and then he seals it isn't that right he said now if you say if you say well you say a while ago about uh Billy Billy Graham and them hollering well now how many wants to accept Christ as a personal savior raise up their hand he says he says all is that all right he said okay certainly that's all right that's good he said but that's just the beginning Prophet said he said then if you really believe it and you really accept it in your heart that you are taught right then the holy spirit will come as a circumcision that he gave Abraham after Faith as a confirmation amen amen amen the Holy Spirit comes on as a confirmation amen he says he goes on he says now you say well people let's have a taring meeting glory to God let's go back glory to God let's t for the Holy Ghost he said there's no such a thing T don't mean to pray tar means to wait how many knows that that tar means to wait Jesus said wait up there in the city of Jerusalem until I until the promise is given to you he said I don't know what they were doing he said they were probably play praying I don't know but never did they have to wait after that because he said while Peter spake these words the Holy Spirit fell on them and all down and then when the Paul laid hands on them the Holy Ghost Came Upon them he said is that right see no more waiting he said now the Holy Ghost was there and give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a confirmation of their faith amen the faith that they claim to have God confirm it with the fire of the Holy Ghost amen and that's what we're looking for tonight a confirmation of our faith of our seven tunder Faith God's going to pour out a Revival upon the bride in the last days to confirm the faith that you have in God the faith that you have in Malachi 4's revealed word oh he'll send the fire of God to confirm the faith in your soul and caramelize it and fix it down in there air go no more out amen amen do you see it now amen oh we struck it wonderful all right we why now now amen and God had Abraham circumcised the confirmation of his faith what was it was the Holy Ghost was it the Holy Ghost he said somebody tell me what the Holy Ghost is for he said it's a sign is that right he said was what's the circumcision it's a sign it that's right yeah it's a sign God gave a sign that he had accepted Abraham for circumcision and when you say Prophet said I believe God I believe Jesus Christ then God gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a sign that he has accepted your faith Hallelujah and that your SE into the kingdom of God not till the next Revival but until the day of your Redemption Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption oh do you believe it tonight amen glory to God hallelujah positionally born talking about positionally born two more minutes God adopted his own son when he took him up took Peter James and John as a witness in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established isn't that right he went up there and God overshadowed Christ and the Holy Spirit overshadowed Christ and his rign and shine as the sun isn't that right and God himself said this is my beloved Son hear ye him in other words there it is he says all of it and there whatever he says is all of it isn't that right and then he was given equal and of course it was God but it was God In the Flesh of Jesus Christ manifesting himself to the people and there God adopted his own son he said in the in the Old Testament when a son is born in a home it's a son because he's uh it was a son it was born in a home my son is my son when he was born to Me Prophet says he gives a reference he said when the Pentecostal Church gave birth or found what they call the birth the new birth or the Holy Ghost Church they were born into the kingdom of God well now in the Old Testament in Ephesians first chapter it said we are predestinated unto the adoption of sons unto the adoption of sons he said look at that unto the adoption of sons yes sir and a man in the Old Testament when he had a son born in his house when he had a son when he was born there the tutor raised that child until he come to a certain age and then if the tutor brought word to the father that this child was worthy and all right and everything uh is that right then he was adopted into that family and he said many of you old test reading know the scripture on that right he said but if he wasn't he still remain a son but he just wasn't adopted oh Hallelujah so there's a difference between born and positionally born oh I'm trying to differentiate that here isn't that right so they are sons and then they are adopted Sons when you're born in a family you're born you come in praise God you're come in a child but then you have to be tutored child trained in order to handle the father's business now you comeing to the adoption and that's a different thing oh Hallelujah you know in part you prophesying part but when that which is perfect is come that which imp part is done away with now you're adopted into the family praise God hallelujah amen and your your name is just as good as a father isn't that right on the check isn't that right amen then he's adopted in that family uh isn't that right he's still he's still a son but he's not adopted oh Hallelujah so what we want to come into tonight is adopted sons in the last days amen that's what God wants that's what his desire for us I truly believe that amen musician can get ready and then if he was adopted he was brought down on the street put on a robe on him ceremony was made and then this boy's signature under check meant just the same as his daddy's just the same for he was adopted into the full Fellowship of the family oh Hallelujah isn't that right praise God so uh said about the Believers on adoption he said here the Caleb and Joshua outfit that was going on to the promise they moved on over into the land and they took the land and settled down in the land as a possession here's an encouragement from the prophet he said and we never stop at justification or sanctification he said let's go on to the baptism of the Holy Spirit he said let's not stop at Believing on the Lord Jesus or being baptized let's not stop because he Clean us up just from a life of sin but now we press on into a position to a promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost for Peter said on the day of Pentecost for This Promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off and even as many as our Lord Our God shall call isn't that right so Ephesus here sets us like Joshua positionally and he said and you notice Joshua after crossing over into the land take the land he divided the land Ephraim here he said Manasses over there this one over here G here Benjamin here he divided the land oh you can begin PR something softly and notice he said and this just burns our hearts each one of those Hebrew mothers hey it's Clos as we coming into this now giving birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains amen where they would be positioned in the promised land oh so they actually come into their position through literally through labor pains oh hallelujah hallelujah no wonder the prophet brings it here like this he said oh it's a great study if you could get into the details and so on he say it'll take ours but someday when we get our church fixed the prophet said I'd just like to come and take a solid month or two just stay right with it he said but watch when each of those mothers come when she called out Ephraim when she was in labor she positionally placed him where his feet was setting in oil just exactly uh every one of them they were at and Joshua knowing this not knowing this not knowing this sorry but by inspiration LED of the Holy Spirit after being in the promised land give each man his promise exactly according to what the Holy Spirit promised through the birth back there and then he come back into this the quote again we read at the beginning so I'll round it up with this how that God set sumon the church through those same labor pains oh he can begin to stand do you see those layer pains now he said and they get tremendous sometimes when that church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world and believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost oh Hallelujah there's a place for you oh God knows it hallelujah oh he's predestinated for you but you got to come through that process of Pains of possessing the land of fighting for your inheritance of coming into your own inch by inch tap line by line here a little there a little oh till you come oh into your Perfection oh Hallelujah isn't that right inch by inch mile by mile Hallelujah everywhere the soul of your foot tread upon that have I given to you you're coming into it amen isn't that right Church groaning and then the promise of the Holy Ghost just as real to us as it was a Pentecost how they grown and cry and the labor pains but when they're born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelist and then he's given today speaking in tongues interpreting of tongues and everything praise God isn't that right oh hallelujah amen hallelujah isn't that right oh my God sets in the church the holy ghost sets in the church in day amen praise God he said where the church is now now this is my purpose of doing this the church always trying to take somebody's corner he said don't do that you can't never raise Corner in ephraim's corner you've got to take your place in Christ positionally take it he said oh it gets deep and Rich when you get in here how that God puts one in the church to speak with tongues and another he said and no we've been taught many times we have to speak with tongues he said that's wrong we don't we we we don't all got to do it he said they didn't all do one thing each one was positionally placed each land was provided and divided up by inspiration praise God each one he said I can take a scripture and show you exactly he put them in their place where they were supposed to be positionally oh praise God Amen we'll stop we'll end it right there tonight amen praise God hallelujah do you believe it tonight he wants to place you in there positionally oh Hallelujah you come through the process oh some through the waters some through the flood some through great trials but all through the blood he wants to positionally place you in there oh Hallelujah to what you have to be oh Hallelujah and God will use you in your hour your season your time oh let's all stand and give him praise
