[1:10:22] amen the Lord bless you all his sons you
[1:10:25] may be seated for just a moment
[1:10:27] certainly appreciate the invitation
[1:10:30] Bible or precious brother Tio
[1:10:34] to be here and
[1:10:36] I think I must have been on wise to
[1:10:38] accept the invitation
[1:10:41] because I I know the the caliber of the
[1:10:45] ministry here
[1:10:46] and I am accept myself even after this
[1:10:49] very moment what can I tell you that you
[1:10:52] have not already heard
[1:10:55] but God does as an appropriate word for
[1:10:57] every service service amen
[1:11:03] really is is not let me talk normal
[1:11:06] right
[1:11:08] if I try to talk a language accent you
[1:11:11] might even understand and I might even
[1:11:13] understand myself
[1:11:14] so it better be simple and plain
[1:11:18] just be who you are if you're otherwise
[1:11:20] is a hypocrite
[1:11:23] and and Gordo like hypocrite that I
[1:11:25] don't want to be a hypocrite amen
[1:11:27] but I just want to be a blessing and
[1:11:30] whatever little way that the Lord would
[1:11:32] use me
[1:11:34] to encourage ourselves
[1:11:37] sometimes we have to encourage ourselves
[1:11:39] you know
[1:11:40] when you see pressure starts so it seems
[1:11:43] like you are alone at all
[1:11:46] you have to encourage yourself in Psalms
[1:11:49] and songs and
[1:11:51] so the Lord have allowed me to be with
[1:11:54] you this morning by God's grace I
[1:11:57] appreciate the confidence that brought
[1:11:59] Theo had to remind me to be with you all
[1:12:02] he never hear me preach before
[1:12:04] that's a brief money
[1:12:10] but who would have thought God would
[1:12:11] have chosen me
[1:12:13] or you
[1:12:15] you remember when it wasn't good
[1:12:19] I
[1:12:21] I I I I there was nothing in you to
[1:12:23] qualify you yeah
[1:12:25] but Gordon is Grace amen
[1:12:29] amen and God has not seen your
[1:12:31] conditioner
[1:12:33] your present condition is not going to
[1:12:35] determine by your destiny is around
[1:12:37] or were you going to be you know
[1:12:41] and if I could step into my message that
[1:12:44] was determined before the foundation
[1:12:50] before there was a speck of dust there
[1:12:53] when there was nothing
[1:12:56] God already see bratio
[1:12:59] oved
[1:13:01] and put his name dog in a book
[1:13:05] I'm not even brother T the book that he
[1:13:08] writes his name in not him he could take
[1:13:10] him out of
[1:13:14] the annoying reason no kind of nothing
[1:13:16] to take all that
[1:13:18] that is indelible
[1:13:23] event and that is the kind of assurance
[1:13:26] we want to have
[1:13:28] that God has chosen us
[1:13:31] in him before the foundation of the
[1:13:34] world
[1:13:36] the rather was meditated on what I could
[1:13:39] see and I was looking on the name Tio
[1:13:42] you know there's only two mentions of
[1:13:44] the name in the Bible right
[1:13:47] but you know that and and look you know
[1:13:49] it's a physician a Dr Luke who was
[1:13:52] writing to Tiara
[1:13:55] so a man of his caliber I need a doctor
[1:13:58] to write too
[1:14:00] yeah well he said he said most excellent
[1:14:04] amen so there is not much of his
[1:14:07] background but the name Tio means a
[1:14:09] friend of God
[1:14:11] so you have a pastor who is a friend of
[1:14:14] God
[1:14:16] that's a I want to be friends you know
[1:14:19] because if he's a friend of God and good
[1:14:22] company
[1:14:24] so that's why I must stay with your
[1:14:26] pastor
[1:14:27] because he's a friend of God
[1:14:30] and if somebody is a friend of God he
[1:14:33] can make representation for you
[1:14:36] you know that
[1:14:38] is
[1:14:43] that could fail
[1:14:45] but the bank the manager Heroes is in
[1:14:49] the banker heaven
[1:14:54] listen let me tell you something God
[1:14:56] don't need money and gold and silver
[1:14:59] do you know what God is interested in
[1:15:02] you
[1:15:04] [Applause]
[1:15:07] you'll see this morning the hard purpose
[1:15:11] of God is to have a wife era the heart
[1:15:13] purpose he had many purpose we see the
[1:15:16] hard purpose is to have himself a wife
[1:15:20] so I Believe by God's grace you are part
[1:15:23] of that elect lady
[1:15:28] so I really want to appreciate our
[1:15:30] precious brother and I pray this morning
[1:15:33] I I really was enjoying this service
[1:15:36] um
[1:15:37] the ministry here has always been
[1:15:39] profound and I think the very first time
[1:15:42] I met brother Tio was in Brussels I
[1:15:45] believe well I'm Saddam he was on his
[1:15:47] way to some part of Africa so I met him
[1:15:50] very very first time in an airport but
[1:15:53] then we begin to meet and fellowship
[1:15:55] with one another and by God's grace
[1:15:59] we are here this house this amen so we
[1:16:03] have come maybe as strangers but when we
[1:16:05] leave we leave us Brothers
[1:16:07] in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:10] so I pray that the Lord will help me to
[1:16:12] say something that will be of a blessing
[1:16:15] you know
[1:16:16] this is my this is just revision class
[1:16:18] right
[1:16:20] this is just a reminder of things that
[1:16:22] you have already known
[1:16:23] amen so by God's grace it will help us
[1:16:27] in life's Judy I had several thoughts or
[1:16:31] two other thoughts in mind
[1:16:33] but somehow you know sometimes it never
[1:16:35] seem to come over
[1:16:37] and then I I just glance at notes that I
[1:16:40] had and then I pick up this message and
[1:16:44] the last
[1:16:45] quote that I have in it
[1:16:47] birram says but this is introducing the
[1:16:51] headstone
[1:16:54] so I knew right away I said listen this
[1:16:56] is what I'm gonna preach on
[1:16:58] light is introduced in The Headstone the
[1:17:02] last the the Bright Tree which is
[1:17:05] contrary to all of it yes it's the same
[1:17:07] light for the mature amen like the same
[1:17:11] sunshine today will be ripening the
[1:17:14] green for the Harvest in July

[1:17:21] little bit this morning on this subject

[1:17:44] Divine anointing

[1:17:50] Revelation is Sovereign Lord we can hear
[1:17:53] everything we can know it we can repeat
[1:17:55] it but not until it becomes a revelation
[1:17:58] it means something to us then it becomes
[1:18:01] life then it becomes quickening power
[1:18:03] then it becomes a rock
[1:18:06] something that can anchor us and Hold Us
[1:18:08] Lord let your word become a revelation

[1:29:26] you could only bypass something
[1:29:29] amen and gods of jab Abraham said you
[1:29:32] see with the revealed word and all the
[1:29:34] time we are taught and told things that
[1:29:36] we see the whole picture

[1:29:41] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[1:29:43] gives the whole mystery the threefold
[1:29:46] purpose of God

[1:29:50] that
[1:29:51] amen and he said know that these things
[1:29:53] are open and now we understand things
[1:29:56] and the word has been revealed we
[1:29:58] understand why we are tested
[1:30:01] so we are pleased the Lord you are
[1:30:03] pleased just to be tested
[1:30:05] [Applause]
[1:30:15] if you take this one you have my next
[1:30:17] one
[1:30:17] [Applause]
[1:30:19] and another test

[1:30:30] only way you can have a testimonies if
[1:30:32] you have a test
[1:30:34] the first four letters of testimony is
[1:30:36] this
[1:30:37] so as long as you are in this body you
[1:30:40] will be tested
[1:30:42] you will be tried
[1:30:44] but if you up if you had come the
[1:30:47] regular line
[1:30:48] like the Lord Jesus Christ came from
[1:30:50] totally or funny to Word Flesh then you
[1:30:54] will have known all things
[1:30:56] yeah like he ignored all things but you
[1:30:59] bypass that
[1:31:00] and then you stopped down in this flesh
[1:31:02] but now

[1:31:28] counted all joy
[1:31:30] your trial is more precious than gold
[1:31:36] so there is no purpose for trial there's
[1:31:39] a purpose for suffering

[1:32:30] carded to be the next high priest but
[1:32:33] that was that education that he had to
[1:32:35] be preparing to be a high priest was
[1:32:36] nothing compared to when he met Jesus on
[1:32:39] the road to the Damascus
[1:32:42] you know what Paul comes all the
[1:32:45] Education and Training on that Gamaliel
[1:32:48] gobar

[1:35:21] because every little thing separates in
[1:35:23] you
[1:35:27] and your Bible say nothing
[1:35:30] [Applause]
[1:35:32] I have to be identified with that if

[1:43:55] say I lose my train I thought I was
[1:43:57] gonna see
[1:43:59] yes science because we have all this
[1:44:02] thing phone become important and this
[1:44:05] and we are technology and we could
[1:44:07] switch on your camera yes
[1:44:13] where all your camera security cameras
[1:44:15] stop them
[1:44:18] until they're coming to open the door
[1:44:20] for them
[1:44:23] get a security system by the angel of
[1:44:26] the Lord and Camp around those that kill
[1:44:29] him
[1:44:37] we we know get what someone we can put
[1:44:40] on with food
[1:44:42] right you live on WhatsApp we live on
[1:44:45] YouTubers listen all of us are the
[1:44:48] problem me too you think I know how they
[1:44:50] probably think I'm talking from an
[1:44:51] experience you know
[1:44:54] because these things are designed
[1:44:57] to take your time away
[1:45:01] you think they dance stupid
[1:45:06] about six thousand years ago
[1:45:09] the only man who could help
[1:45:14] so you apply the word to deal with the
[1:45:16] Devil
[1:45:19] then the Syrian King was wondering how
[1:45:22] Israel know what going on in the house
[1:45:25] he's like Jihad what's up
[1:45:29] waiting here
[1:45:34] and it wasn't dependent on when he put
[1:45:37] it on
[1:45:38] God cannot put it on my mini bedroom
[1:45:40] when in the bathroom
[1:45:42] [Applause]
[1:45:45] a
[1:45:50] who opened the gate for Peter
[1:45:54] this is amazing automatic
[1:45:58] got to do in that long time
[1:46:01] [Applause]
[1:46:04] and ship the no start to float Elijah
[1:46:06] want to make an accent float up and come
[1:46:09] up
[1:46:13] until it's still on the water
[1:46:17] so listen science is superseded by the
[1:46:20] laws of God
[1:46:22] and the word of God
[1:46:25] everything is controlled by laws you
[1:46:28] know
[1:46:29] God put laws in place
[1:46:31] but God can supersede Allah a higher law
[1:46:37] so that when the fall took place God
[1:46:39] already had a law in place to deal with
[1:46:41] the Fallen
[1:46:43] it was called the law of redemption
[1:46:50] so
[1:46:51] the fall is not greater than the lawyer
[1:46:54] of redemption
[1:46:55] let me remind you you are not bigger
[1:46:57] than the loyal
[1:47:00] you have to live by the law
[1:47:03] if they lost aware seat Beltway seat
[1:47:06] belt
[1:47:07] no man law may have short comments and
[1:47:09] feel it but God law has no flaws in it
[1:47:13] [Applause]
[1:47:15] and God oh hello hidden agenda or no
[1:47:19] hidden little line under the line at all
[1:47:23] he said take up your cross and follow me
[1:47:26] daily
[1:47:27] it has nothing here in God has talked
[1:47:30] plane
[1:47:31] he said foxes of all birth softness the
[1:47:34] Solomon have a place all they want to
[1:47:35] come with me

[1:47:47] the front to talk the front you behave
[1:47:49] the Frank
[1:47:51] you become an oddball
[1:47:54] so there's nothing hidden God is plain
[1:47:57] and he told Eve Aram sorry he said the
[1:48:01] day you eat from that tree that day you
[1:48:03] die
[1:48:06] nothing no big deal that I had nothing
[1:48:09] hard to understand
[1:48:10] come and see you go surely die girl
[1:48:14] you think Satan was sweeter
[1:48:18] adultery doesn't start overnight you

[1:48:28] death you know

[1:48:33] you
[1:48:35] you've got to protect yourself bro
[1:48:38] and protect yourself see tell me we come
[1:48:40] good morning Eve
[1:48:42] you look lovely to this
[1:48:44] wow your hair looks beautiful
[1:48:47] tomorrow
[1:48:49] oh you have such soft hands all your
[1:48:52] eyes are so big satano's work
[1:48:56] you work over time
[1:48:58] historial weakness everything about you
[1:49:01] but God give man free will
[1:49:06] you know Satan was equal with God
[1:49:09] without creative power
[1:49:12] because if he had creative power he
[1:49:14] would have been like God but you know
[1:49:16] God was so confident with Adam he gave
[1:49:18] God made God equal with him and give him
[1:49:21] creative power
[1:49:25] Adam could I create Adam could I tell
[1:49:27] you three three I don't like how you
[1:49:28] look into they go a little bit and said
[1:49:30] let me get variation in The Greenery
[1:49:32] today
[1:49:33] at the landscape I look a little
[1:49:34] different and he had the power
[1:49:38] to speak it but he give man free will
[1:49:42] so that his purpose will be accomplished
[1:49:46] you see inside of God had the attribute
[1:49:48] of Redeemer instead of God had the
[1:49:51] attribute of Father instead of what are
[1:49:53] the attribute as Savior healer provider
[1:49:57] no unless there are needs to be
[1:50:00] satisfied these attributes could have
[1:50:02] never been expressed or manifested it
[1:50:05] would have never been realized
[1:50:08] amen so that in order that his great
[1:50:11] attributes that he had hidden up inside
[1:50:14] of him these things were locked up
[1:50:16] inside of him
[1:50:17] and he couldn't be God without it
[1:50:20] expressed and manifested it would never
[1:50:22] make him who he was
[1:50:24] that is why Angels cannot sing Amazing
[1:50:27] Grace
[1:50:28] they would they don't know what it is to
[1:50:30] be lost they don't know what it is to be
[1:50:32] straight they don't want to be an old
[1:50:35] cast but you and I can sing Amazing
[1:50:37] Grace
[1:50:38] [Applause]
[1:50:41] we know what we asked again we
[1:50:43] understand because you know what it is
[1:50:45] to be in our need you know what it is to
[1:50:47] have a problem you know what it is to be
[1:50:50] sick
[1:50:51] and you can praise them with an
[1:50:53] understanding you can approach him in a
[1:50:55] particular way your love to him is
[1:50:58] greater
[1:50:59] [Applause]
[1:51:03] my
[1:51:06] Robert Brown talks about you with the
[1:51:08] woman in Simon's house right who washed
[1:51:11] his feet
[1:51:12] the prostitute
[1:51:15] when she saw Jesus unwashed
[1:51:18] she said I cannot leave him like that at
[1:51:20] all
[1:51:22] because he had done some kindness
[1:51:25] to one of my kind the woman that was
[1:51:28] caught in adultery
[1:51:30] amen so she was identified
[1:51:33] he said this man have done such a deed
[1:51:37] such an act such a way he treated a
[1:51:39] friend of mine and that's how they have
[1:51:41] him she was not prepared to sit sit by
[1:51:45] and just pass him either she said I will
[1:51:48] do something
[1:51:50] amen that is why Baja expression was
[1:51:54] greater than even the invitations Simon
[1:51:56] had
[1:51:59] of him and when she was watching us with
[1:52:03] Simon and them look back with contempt
[1:52:05] and sarcasm if he was a prophet he don't
[1:52:07] know the kind of woman
[1:52:13] yeah
[1:52:14] but yet Jesus never moved he sat there
[1:52:17] because the purpose for coming is a safe
[1:52:20] Sinners that's the kind of people he was
[1:52:22] looking for
[1:52:24] they were previously looking for people
[1:52:26] where Rob said he said that woman at the
[1:52:29] well
[1:52:30] amen
[1:52:32] so she understood the woman at the well
[1:52:34] she went there she was in her 20s
[1:52:37] turning 20s she was becoming old
[1:52:41] and then he talked to the woman he said
[1:52:43] young at all once across twenties
[1:52:46] downhill
[1:52:50] the joy and beauty is that listen as a
[1:52:52] Christian you are not dying but you are
[1:52:54] you are looking for water you are closer
[1:52:56] to your body change
[1:52:59] don't suddenly agent Factor anymore
[1:53:01] study your body changes nearer I am
[1:53:04] nearer to my youth you are closer to 18.
[1:53:09] 20 the peak of your youth
[1:53:12] amen so there she was amen but God had a
[1:53:16] purpose amen before he left before the
[1:53:19] heavens had stepped down into our body
[1:53:21] of Flesh he left with that purpose the
[1:53:24] Bible say he had needs
[1:53:28] on this particular day Jesus you will be
[1:53:31] required to go through some area
[1:53:34] the Bible said he had needs to
[1:53:37] it was mandatory
[1:53:39] Daddy go to some area and he'd send the
[1:53:42] disciples away they did not want them to
[1:53:44] interfere with this purpose that morning
[1:53:47] he said only have gone by food all
[1:53:48] they're going to say about the Flesh and
[1:53:50] he sat down waiting for the woman to
[1:53:52] come amen Jesus was waiting for you and
[1:53:56] I Jesus is waiting for you and I he's
[1:53:59] longing for you and I to come to
[1:54:01] adoption he wants us to rise up to our
[1:54:04] full potential
[1:54:06] we are not predestinated to be children
[1:54:09] all our days we are predestinated to be
[1:54:11] a mature son and daughter of God
[1:54:15] you're stepping into your position the
[1:54:18] restores the restoration of God's power
[1:54:21] is back to his bride again
[1:54:23] you are living in glorious time you are
[1:54:26] living in a golden age
[1:54:29] [Applause]
[1:54:31] Jesus had needs amen and he sat there
[1:54:35] waiting for her and when he came by he
[1:54:37] started a discussion
[1:54:40] amen
[1:54:42] and the first thing she said
[1:54:44] you I talk in my own language right
[1:54:47] you're playing fresh with me or what you
[1:54:49] are all my the Bible say you look like
[1:54:51] you are not a man more than 50 years
[1:54:53] older that's what I thought the ministry
[1:54:56] and the labor of the ministry had him
[1:54:58] like that in fact the Bible said there
[1:55:00] was no form no Beauty no comliness that
[1:55:03] we should desire him
[1:55:05] the great God
[1:55:07] we like show we like to create the
[1:55:09] impression

[1:55:30] listen God was played and God wants a
[1:55:34] plane
[1:55:35] God know you when you had nothing
[1:55:39] amen
[1:55:40] say when Sarah went down to to Sodom and
[1:55:45] she met Mrs Lott he said he Caravans had
[1:55:48] passed through
[1:55:49] yeah and when he saw the new curtain and
[1:55:51] she when she saw the new curtains and
[1:55:53] and a lot Mrs a lot new here do I think

[1:56:04] cattle died in her life hard and your
[1:56:07] letter good for nothing never yours take
[1:56:09] everything
[1:56:10] and if it's the old thing dog day if
[1:56:12] it's any kind of house like white living
[1:56:14] in
[1:56:17] in a tent
[1:56:22] although the holidays complained
[1:56:24] I would tell the ladies I want to watch
[1:56:27] a lady is a serious
[1:56:29] foreign
[1:56:38] was in a bad mood
[1:56:45] I don't know why I said I said
[1:56:47] I'm talking to my church people right
[1:56:50] so that may excuse this morning I talk
[1:56:52] about my church people
[1:56:54] so
[1:56:55] anybody from headstone cannot say
[1:56:58] anything I'm a disclaimer I'm a
[1:57:01] disclaimer I put in a disclaimer I have
[1:57:03] that legal right here
[1:57:06] I am not responsible for any damages
[1:57:12] anyway the prophet said
[1:57:14] she was in a bad mood she was not in an
[1:57:17] atmosphere to receive what was the
[1:57:20] blessing that was coming
[1:57:23] and do you know a wagon had gone down to
[1:57:25] Saddam but a wagon from heaven was
[1:57:28] coming down
[1:57:30] it was going to pass through
[1:57:34] Abraham went by the 10 door and he began
[1:57:37] to sit down you know what he was doing
[1:57:39] he was counting the blessings of God
[1:57:43] all the things that God had blessed him
[1:57:45] with all the Privileges that he had and
[1:57:48] that he knew
[1:57:50] and here was Melchizedek coming down not
[1:57:53] to make Opera
[1:57:55] he was going to give Sarah a makeover
[1:58:00] when God was done with Sarah even though
[1:58:02] she lied and God couldn't hit him God
[1:58:04] cannot hurt us because we are connected
[1:58:06] to Christ Alone
[1:58:09] it's not that you're good looking or
[1:58:11] you're dead nothing you know it's
[1:58:12] because you are in him
[1:58:14] he covers You by his blood he protects
[1:58:17] you
[1:58:18] you are seal this poor person that he
[1:58:20] covers you with his blood
[1:58:22] and Melchizedek came down to give Sarah
[1:58:25] a complete body change
[1:58:27] a complete body change that Ivana when
[1:58:31] he saw her she was so beautiful it was
[1:58:33] reported that if you see the girl with
[1:58:35] Abraham and his sister and all kind of
[1:58:38] thing because she was such a new
[1:58:41] creation
[1:58:42] come in every four man motion she was a
[1:58:45] new woman again
[1:58:47] listen friends if Melchizedek came and
[1:58:50] did it then don't you think the purpose
[1:58:52] of melchizere coming is to do the same
[1:58:55] for you and I
[1:58:56] [Applause]
[1:59:00] do you think Melchizedek just came
[1:59:03] for November Abraham said who is this
[1:59:06] male president
[1:59:08] he wasn't talking about the one that
[1:59:10] came to Abraham he wasn't talking about
[1:59:11] he said about this Melchizedek
[1:59:14] it is the Melchizedek that was in him
[1:59:16] talking
[1:59:18] it was God in him
[1:59:22] you know he spent more he talked and
[1:59:24] titles the message who is this
[1:59:25] Melchizedek but he spends more time
[1:59:29] uh revealing Who You Are
[1:59:34] in other words your identity his purpose
[1:59:37] for coming was to establish your
[1:59:40] identity
[1:59:41] you are not a Trinidadian
[1:59:44] you are selling a group European article
[1:59:48] someone said that's how people come
[1:59:50] complain about the indenture ship and
[1:59:52] slavery and all kind of thing all over
[1:59:54] the world right and they want re
[1:59:56] reparation or repatriation make up for
[2:00:00] it listen me I want to make up for that
[2:00:02] I thank God put me in a place where I
[2:00:05] know English
[2:00:07] so I could understand the prophet
[2:00:08] language
[2:00:09] and God put me in an environment
[2:00:12] God's purpose was for you and I to hear
[2:00:15] this message
[2:00:18] God know maybe whatever part of India or
[2:00:20] Africa you will may have come from God
[2:00:23] knew we may not have had the message yet
[2:00:24] so he pull it out and make it easier for
[2:00:27] us
[2:00:30] hey
[2:00:31] he put baratio in a position where he
[2:00:34] can get the message freely and be able
[2:00:36] to be a blessing to the bride around the
[2:00:38] world
[2:00:40] your purpose is to fulfill the mind of
[2:00:43] God it's to do God's will it's according
[2:00:47] to his great counsel of his mind
[2:00:49] [Applause]
[2:00:51] you are not just existing you are born
[2:00:55] with a purpose you are born for a
[2:00:57] purpose
[2:01:00] you have an eternal purpose
[2:01:04] temporary purpose
[2:01:09] Satan has a temporary purpose
[2:01:13] listen if people are come against you
[2:01:15] they have a temporary purpose
[2:01:18] don't fight over them
[2:01:20] listen God will deal with all our attend
[2:01:22] you cause
[2:01:25] Everything Jesus tells um Judas he said
[2:01:29] do we have to do fast amount
[2:01:32] as hard and painful as it was very much
[2:01:35] he said but go and do what you have
[2:01:37] quickly
[2:01:39] because you have a purpose to fulfill
[2:01:40] but I also am born with a purpose
[2:01:44] you see the laws of redemption requires
[2:01:47] that a man must die
[2:01:50] so God concern an angel
[2:01:52] God can take another Sinner and make him
[2:01:55] die
[2:01:56] God and you and I couldn't die for our
[2:01:58] own sins
[2:02:00] it could not equate for your sins that's
[2:02:02] why Baba said taking a man's life
[2:02:04] because he killed somebody is not going
[2:02:06] to compensate
[2:02:07] so what did God do God came himself
[2:02:12] he came back as Redeemer the laws of
[2:02:16] redemption step into effect
[2:02:19] and he came back and he stepped in in
[2:02:22] their flesh body so that when he paid
[2:02:24] the price the price was paid in full
[2:02:26] [Music]
[2:02:27] on the sun Redemption and when you look
[2:02:30] at Redemption you'll realize listen be
[2:02:32] he redeeming love will be my team and
[2:02:35] shall be till I die because Redemption
[2:02:38] means I'm bought with a price I am not
[2:02:41] restored to my former position I can no
[2:02:44] longer be charged I can no longer lose
[2:02:46] my inheritance because it has been
[2:02:49] redeemed
[2:02:53] God all that Adam lost in the truthful
[2:02:56] purpose of God all that Adam lost is now
[2:02:59] being restored that's why we are living
[2:03:01] in a time when markets go hunted and he
[2:03:04] can tell you God can come down and tell
[2:03:06] him your hunting squirrels
[2:03:08] he said well you speak how much you want
[2:03:12] and a man like you and I
[2:03:14] Jesus In the Flesh didn't create with
[2:03:17] what with anything new order nothing but
[2:03:20] Ramsay took bread and break it he took
[2:03:22] water and made wine but in this day
[2:03:25] he took the ministry of the son of man
[2:03:28] and he said you speak it
[2:03:31] and out of nothing
[2:03:34] nothing
[2:03:36] yeah
[2:03:41] oh my goodness
[2:03:43] what a time is the restoration of them
[2:03:46] did if all that Adam lost
[2:03:49] [Applause]
[2:03:50] God Wants You and I the message is not
[2:03:53] yet a contest the message is yet to put
[2:03:55] us in our position of comfort and
[2:03:58] Assurance to know as a Son of God I kept
[2:04:01] the same right I have the same
[2:04:03] privileges
[2:04:04] [Applause]
[2:04:09] God wants us to come up there
[2:04:13] amen
[2:04:15] oh God is so good everything about you
[2:04:18] is already known
[2:04:20] amen I don't know why they thought you
[2:04:23] remember Banks would you know is um
[2:04:27] they they were Jehovah Witness so they
[2:04:29] were always the father brother
[2:04:33] I think Bank started fellowshipping
[2:04:35] first because his son David had Adam
[2:04:36] polio and in the audience he was uh
[2:04:40] discerned and such like honey walked out
[2:04:41] so the brother come down the street not
[2:04:43] very bad
[2:04:45] who else to let them come
[2:04:49] he said well we where were you last
[2:04:51] night

[2:04:56] shotgun waiting for you

[2:05:03] and he wanted to know if banks
[2:05:07] wouldn't know what he was doing

[2:05:14] but they go fishing together and on the
[2:05:17] lake the the catch a fish and the hook
[2:05:19] is too big it pulls audience
[2:05:21] and the Lord said barbram says you're
[2:05:24] going to see the power of God and he
[2:05:26] thought it would have been some popular
[2:05:27] kitten that was got crush or something
[2:05:30] Joseph had Crush
[2:05:32] and he said the Holy Spirit tell them
[2:05:34] speak to this fish and he said little
[2:05:36] fish I give you a life
[2:05:38] a fish study and trails that come out
[2:05:40] Swan back to life and went back in the
[2:05:43] water
[2:05:44] [Applause]
[2:05:46] it went on when Brahm is telling this
[2:05:49] story to sister happy right she is
[2:05:51] standing there a little with a woman
[2:05:53] look at her attitude where the Branham
[2:05:55] isn't Society right everything that God
[2:05:58] does for us our purpose
[2:06:00] why didn't bro I'm going to brashikirian
[2:06:03] house so when I was saying the testimony
[2:06:05] or this one house and that guy because
[2:06:08] there are some things are not for
[2:06:09] everybody you know
[2:06:11] you don't quarrel if somebody don't see
[2:06:13] the message you even seated
[2:06:16] and just pray that they get eternal life
[2:06:18] at least
[2:06:21] just pray for one another and don't come
[2:06:24] them or criticize
[2:06:26] regardless of how mean people can be to
[2:06:29] you listen they're serving our purpose
[2:06:33] the idea to test you to see if you have
[2:06:35] patience
[2:06:36] they're here to test you to see if you
[2:06:37] have love
[2:06:39] listen the higher you go up in life as
[2:06:42] you you get treating your training never
[2:06:44] ends in certain Fields if you are
[2:06:46] certain professions as a lawyer you're
[2:06:48] constantly reading and you gotta keep
[2:06:50] our breasts at things but you move up
[2:06:52] the ranks and every test every exam that
[2:06:55] you have take you at a higher level
[2:06:57] so God is promoting us to a higher level
[2:07:01] he's gonna take you to a point when he
[2:07:04] has such a confidence in you
[2:07:07] that you can stand up you see it is all
[2:07:09] about character you know
[2:07:12] when you've got character you nothing is
[2:07:15] done for sure anymore you know nothing
[2:07:17] is done to impress anybody you know
[2:07:20] you are just you have humility you have
[2:07:23] gentle you listen you a man with real
[2:07:26] Authority
[2:07:27] he don't need a Fastenal
[2:07:30] he knows his power
[2:07:32] he knows his authority
[2:07:35] and you don't have to display it you
[2:07:38] just quietly and not the appointed time
[2:07:40] not Paul kraka so the demand and the
[2:07:43] Lord never gave him permission until a
[2:07:44] particular time
[2:07:46] is the same way that deal with it right
[2:07:48] away
[2:07:50] when Dr Bess was forces
[2:07:54] one question but I was without a annual
[2:07:57] argument Fall Apart
[2:08:00] didn't he never did anything and what is
[2:08:04] happening to us friends you've got to
[2:08:06] help La law God to develop your
[2:08:08] character
[2:08:10] those qualities those attributes that
[2:08:13] you move around with a calm and quiet
[2:08:15] assurance that you know that Jesus is
[2:08:18] mine
[2:08:21] amend sobraham moved around with purpose
[2:08:24] the same way Jesus went to the well for
[2:08:27] that particular one where Brown goes to
[2:08:28] sister happy rights host and he's
[2:08:31] talking and speaking about his squirrels
[2:08:33] and wherever she is she may be standing
[2:08:35] back I'm sure she wasn't in the
[2:08:37] Forefront and she she just said that is
[2:08:40] nothing but the truth
[2:08:42] and berbraham said the Holy Spirit came
[2:08:44] down and such a mighty way it cannot
[2:08:46] boost the room apart
[2:08:48] how do you say give her anything she
[2:08:50] asked for
[2:08:52] him
[2:08:53] to start if you want million dollars
[2:08:55] gold could put her in table if you want
[2:08:57] your sister eat it to be healed she can
[2:08:58] get up from a wheelchair walk
[2:09:01] and she said bro she asked for something
[2:09:04] that was priceless
[2:09:08] Priceless you cannot put out value on a
[2:09:10] soul
[2:09:12] and if for nothing else his purpose for
[2:09:14] visiting that house
[2:09:16] was for sister hearty right
[2:09:18] say I want the salvation of my they
[2:09:21] laugh at the right time
[2:09:24] and she said I want the salvation of my
[2:09:26] boys
[2:09:27] I give you your voice
[2:09:31] increase of God
[2:09:34] we are born with purpose everything that
[2:09:36] God has done has purpose
[2:09:39] amen
[2:09:40] let me share with you a little torture
[2:09:46] I I always said you know technology is
[2:09:49] amazing you know
[2:09:51] you know I I tell the church I said this
[2:09:54] iPod if I close it it will only open
[2:09:57] with my face
[2:10:00] I didn't know that right
[2:10:02] just without having a print recognition
[2:10:04] on your phone and accounting
[2:10:07] I won't facial recognition with this
[2:10:13] well when I open this
[2:10:15] I want this to recognize
[2:10:18] me
[2:10:22] you identified you're living at time
[2:10:25] with technology we are moving up into a
[2:10:27] higher level
[2:10:29] a much higher level purpose we said that
[2:10:32] purpose precedes predestination
[2:10:35] that's why God could have predestinated
[2:10:37] things you know God predestinated every
[2:10:41] individual the time would be born
[2:10:44] I was a general dedication last Tuesday
[2:10:46] I was telling them that when Jesus was
[2:10:50] born he had to be born at precisely the
[2:10:52] right time
[2:10:53] conceived
[2:10:55] six months before he was booted John had
[2:10:58] to come
[2:10:59] because the ministry of John the Baptist
[2:11:01] could only have lasted for six months
[2:11:04] so John had to come and the Jew Jewish
[2:11:08] system is that you're going to service
[2:11:10] at the age of 30. so John had to be born
[2:11:13] six months exactly so that when he
[2:11:16] stepped in into service he had a
[2:11:17] Ministry for six months and then Jesus
[2:11:20] took over
[2:11:22] amen so the timing of both John and
[2:11:25] Jesus had to be precise
[2:11:27] and here was a a barren woman
[2:11:31] amen never had a child
[2:11:33] and even when you know a boy's name
[2:11:37] Zacharias he should have had more faith
[2:11:39] than and then Elizabeth because he know
[2:11:42] about Hannah how she was born to
[2:11:47] could be dumb
[2:11:50] yeah so you see the the Revelation could
[2:11:54] come simply you know
[2:11:55] a big examples and somebody simple
[2:11:58] that's why the ordinary people will
[2:12:01] catch it and and the bigger Minds with
[2:12:03] all your intellect and things you miss
[2:12:05] the whole thing now
[2:12:06] because you're too confused with your
[2:12:10] science and your intellect just think
[2:12:14] God would simply
[2:12:16] plain Lord you said it that's why Mary
[2:12:19] said be it unto me according to I would
[2:12:23] Elizabeth accepted the word
[2:12:26] Mary when she was visited Ram said Mary
[2:12:29] was the daughter of Anna the prophetess
[2:12:32] in the temple
[2:12:34] spoke on what is the Original Seed her
[2:12:37] without mother who was in the temple had
[2:12:39] taught her those things
[2:12:41] so I went
[2:12:43] Joseph were discussing what the priest
[2:12:46] was saying her son would be born he said
[2:12:48] well you know that God from that time no
[2:12:50] longer operated anymore that was in them
[2:12:52] time
[2:12:53] and she said but that was song right
[2:12:55] and she was meditating on it but she was
[2:12:58] well taught by Anna you see the
[2:13:00] importance of her Godly mother
[2:13:02] so that when the angel came she was
[2:13:04] already prepared
[2:13:06] to receive it you are already prepared
[2:13:09] to receive this word your prayer meeting
[2:13:12] prepared you
[2:13:13] amen if you were praying and asking God
[2:13:15] he said Lord prepare my heart so that
[2:13:18] when the word comes I will recognize
[2:13:20] what my purpose is I will recognize my
[2:13:22] position
[2:13:24] so you're not unprepared but you are
[2:13:26] ready because you are meditating you
[2:13:29] talk too much about soap and all kind of
[2:13:31] dishwashing liquid all kind of other
[2:13:33] things now
[2:13:34] and you miss the essence of your life
[2:13:37] but when you begin to study and meditate
[2:13:40] on the word what does it mean she was
[2:13:42] able to say be it unto me according to
[2:13:45] Thy word and a virgin conceived never
[2:13:48] happened before will never happen again
[2:13:51] amen but the word of God is see the word
[2:13:54] of God impregnated us she received
[2:13:57] listen Mary just receive our word in
[2:14:00] them
[2:14:04] do you know that all of us came from one
[2:14:06] all human beings came from one man
[2:14:10] unless you didn't come from somewhere
[2:14:12] else I hope
[2:14:15] all human beings come how did God lock
[2:14:18] up the potential of every one of us in
[2:14:22] Arab you you try to figure that out
[2:14:25] and not one in 110 billion human beings
[2:14:29] was in one seed
[2:14:31] in one month sorry
[2:14:33] that's the infinite mind of God
[2:14:38] locked it up and if God can have said
[2:14:42] Adam and said at that time let every
[2:14:45] seed bring forth after its kind he knew
[2:14:48] down through the ages of time but Mary
[2:14:50] just received the word and that is why
[2:14:53] if you can receive the message of this
[2:14:55] hour the light that has come in this day
[2:14:58] then it will Quicken you the same way
[2:15:00] that seed world was quicker than Merry
[2:15:02] and a child was born
[2:15:04] [Applause]
[2:15:05] amen and just how God put our seed in
[2:15:09] Adam he put you in Christ
[2:15:16] are you notifications
[2:15:18] if you booked an alarm then you put
[2:15:20] listen if I take a corn seed and it has
[2:15:22] life and it is your mother and I plant
[2:15:24] it for 10 years time there will be
[2:15:27] Millions 10 to the power 27 million
[2:15:31] congruents come from one sin
[2:15:35] you won't see nothing else only corn
[2:15:40] in one little tiny season
[2:15:44] but God has purpose
[2:15:46] that seed has power seed has life seize
[2:15:50] their career
[2:15:52] and that is why the same word of God has
[2:15:55] power inside of you
[2:15:56] it has life inside of you
[2:15:59] [Applause]
[2:16:02] it's not how it will be it's a bit unto
[2:16:05] me according to your word
[2:16:07] I am a Son of God you're a daughter of
[2:16:10] God it has to happen
[2:16:14] everybody
[2:16:17] had increa there are lots of nature
[2:16:21] their laws of life
[2:16:23] amen are the laws of nature are
[2:16:25] portfolio the laws of science that man
[2:16:28] have discovered is powerful it was
[2:16:29] always there you know it's just that
[2:16:31] Isaac Newton was sitting on that fall
[2:16:35] and he decided to write the laws
[2:16:37] Newton's Law
[2:16:39] but for all life as long as there were
[2:16:42] apple tree and there was a upper will
[2:16:44] fall from a tree it will drop to the
[2:16:46] ground
[2:16:47] and he was asking why did it come to the
[2:16:50] ground and not go up in the sky
[2:16:52] and then he write the laws of
[2:16:54] gravitation
[2:16:56] but God made the laws
[2:16:58] there's a law of gravitation if I jump
[2:17:00] from here I wouldn't go so
[2:17:03] right and I prefer too far I wouldn't be
[2:17:05] foolish a jump
[2:17:07] because I could hurt myself
[2:17:09] but there's a lot of aerodynamics
[2:17:11] that if I had the power I could
[2:17:13] supersede the law of gravitation and I
[2:17:15] could fly
[2:17:16] and that is why God's word are more
[2:17:19] powerful that's why God Jesus gonna walk
[2:17:22] on the water
[2:17:23] he didn't need to follow Akin with this
[2:17:25] principle I know the law of rotation he
[2:17:28] just know I need to meet them boys only
[2:17:30] see the fish the frightened I'll stop
[2:17:32] and he walked out
[2:17:36] and one day this Supernatural will
[2:17:38] become natural
[2:17:39] [Applause]
[2:17:45] and that would mean something super oh
[2:17:48] my gosh do you know that brother I'm
[2:17:50] still this storm and the men were
[2:17:52] between him that remain when he came
[2:17:54] back he said what you can the brothers
[2:17:55] that testify that they were making so
[2:17:57] much a joke they were not in a position
[2:17:59] to receive that
[2:18:00] that here was a man who stepped into a
[2:18:03] storm
[2:18:04] that knew and he told them don't go in
[2:18:06] there so when it's not only get back to
[2:18:08] the camp
[2:18:09] and here it is that the almighty God
[2:18:11] spoke to him the almighty God spoke to
[2:18:15] him he said I am the creator of the
[2:18:17] heaven on Earth I am the one who tell
[2:18:19] you speak to these squirrels he said you
[2:18:21] speak to this talk and whatever you say
[2:18:24] is going to be that way
[2:18:27] he says storm I resent your comment go
[2:18:30] away he says son the same son that
[2:18:33] Joshua spoke to he said you shine for
[2:18:35] four days
[2:18:37] [Applause]
[2:18:39] and a storm
[2:18:41] Russia custard stopper storm China can
[2:18:44] stop a storm America can't stop us up
[2:18:47] all together they can't stop by storm
[2:18:49] but a man like you and I
[2:18:52] who are serving God's Eternal purpose
[2:18:54] was able to tell a storm he says storm
[2:18:57] go back to where you come from
[2:19:05] that is what God wants you and I we want
[2:19:08] us to be walking but I'm never did
[2:19:10] nothing for sure
[2:19:18] he said he could have shot it there
[2:19:19] three day will come out because in the
[2:19:22] atmosphere that was created the day
[2:19:24] again three of them and whatever third
[2:19:26] two phones
[2:19:27] go back
[2:19:29] and then he remembered he made a promise
[2:19:31] to God he said I will not shoot animals
[2:19:33] for these men anymore unless it's like
[2:19:35] an emergency and he said little the
[2:19:38] holidays are going to come closer he
[2:19:42] said
[2:19:44] the presence of God the atmosphere the
[2:19:48] attitude of a man the character of a man
[2:19:51] them there was Fearless
[2:19:53] in the presence of a son of God
[2:19:57] amen and they came close to him
[2:19:59] amen and then God said to him you
[2:20:02] remembered your promise he said neither
[2:20:05] will I forget mine I will never leave
[2:20:06] you nor forsake me say for thank you and
[2:20:09] the burden was lifted
[2:20:12] birram continues and he says crying and
[2:20:15] he's saying every form and motion I was
[2:20:17] a young man again he stepped in his tea
[2:20:20] off anybody his Millennial body the
[2:20:22] media was there too
[2:20:29] can I walk anybody
[2:20:31] he was physically strong it would have
[2:20:33] had to take something like the same way
[2:20:35] John had to execute John leaked while
[2:20:39] and he was an organic man
[2:20:43] amen
[2:20:45] he knew how good food was
[2:20:48] and he was strong and healthy I mean he
[2:20:51] couldn't die from sickness he'd take up
[2:20:53] by evil woman with a bad mother
[2:20:58] but his purpose was finished
[2:21:00] when your purpose is finished you should
[2:21:03] be ready to go
[2:21:05] don't fight up for more life
[2:21:07] your purpose done
[2:21:10] I tell them don't put me on no machine
[2:21:12] and block me and I don't do enough
[2:21:14] bypass one is enough
[2:21:18] we're not ready to go let me go
[2:21:22] you have to they bought anything so no
[2:21:25] way you're going
[2:21:26] [Applause]
[2:21:28] your purpose is done Lord let me go
[2:21:30] perhaps when my purpose is finished then
[2:21:33] I am finished with life
[2:21:35] because his purpose was greater than his
[2:21:37] desire
[2:21:38] his purpose was greater than his comfort
[2:21:41] his purpose was greater than his
[2:21:43] suffering his purpose was greater than
[2:21:45] his desires
[2:21:47] your his purpose is greater than
[2:21:49] anything
[2:21:52] you gotta see purpose if God have
[2:21:54] allowed something there's a purpose
[2:21:56] behind everything
[2:21:58] [Applause]
[2:22:02] do you know that Jesus even though Mary
[2:22:05] was nine months ready to give birth his
[2:22:07] purpose was that God determined that
[2:22:10] Jesus will be born in Bethlehem
[2:22:12] the least of the Cities not Jerusalem
[2:22:15] not bigger Bethlehem or Hebron or other
[2:22:18] cities he said he had to be born in
[2:22:20] Bethlehem
[2:22:22] listen yesterday why it had to be
[2:22:25] Shepherds because Shepherd would
[2:22:27] understand sheep he was the Lamb of God
[2:22:31] Eminem high priest and then my pollutant
[2:22:33] men couldn't understand though Jesus
[2:22:35] could have been born
[2:22:37] they missed it completely but it came
[2:22:39] among Shepherds that why God will bypass
[2:22:42] all the other churches and come to you
[2:22:44] he comes in humility he comes in your
[2:22:47] home he comes in in your life he sits
[2:22:50] with you you'll be driving and he's in
[2:22:52] the car
[2:22:53] [Music]
[2:22:57] when we get into that state of mind when
[2:23:00] we remember our commitment when we
[2:23:02] remember our resolve then he comes in on
[2:23:04] the scene demand and the almighty God I
[2:23:07] love this so much the almighty Creator
[2:23:10] he stepped on and he said want to walk
[2:23:13] with me
[2:23:15] oh my goodness
[2:23:18] all the almighty God
[2:23:21] amen the one who said let there be light
[2:23:25] and he put the sun in position and he
[2:23:27] said you rule by day Moon you roll by
[2:23:30] night and science every past six billion
[2:23:33] years this summer being in its position
[2:23:37] he said it has enough power in it
[2:23:40] it has enough energy in it to run for
[2:23:42] another 6 billion years because our Word
[2:23:45] of Our God almighty God said let there
[2:23:48] be light
[2:23:50] and if that same one speaks a word that
[2:23:53] there is going to be a break nothing
[2:23:56] [Music]
[2:24:00] I think a million years they can take a
[2:24:02] billionaires but that bride has to come
[2:24:05] [Applause]
[2:24:11] are you understand how powerful it is
[2:24:15] do you know that only five parts and 10
[2:24:18] billion of the sun energy ever is good
[2:24:22] 9.0005 percent
[2:24:24] the rest is just dissipated into space
[2:24:28] and yet everything is ruled by Nissan
[2:24:33] if the sons of shining how long you
[2:24:35] think life will last
[2:24:36] winter will come suddenly into Trinidad
[2:24:39] death will come Darkness will come
[2:24:42] an all life will end and everything that
[2:24:46] I've ever lived naturally have lived
[2:24:49] because of the energy of the Sun
[2:24:50] [Music]
[2:24:52] and think about the power behind the one
[2:24:55] who said let there be light
[2:25:01] that's why the prophet was able to say
[2:25:03] this spoken word is the original seat
[2:25:07] because the same power that generated I
[2:25:10] have a son operating
[2:25:12] and controlling all these systems and
[2:25:15] the climate and the the various
[2:25:17] conditions of the earth that same power
[2:25:19] is operating behind the word of God
[2:25:23] it is the same power
[2:25:27] it is not less it cannot be diminished
[2:25:32] amen it's all connected to purpose
[2:25:36] and there's been a light that has been
[2:25:38] determined that will shine in this day
[2:25:41] nothing
[2:25:42] Paul's day nothing nothing Wesley day
[2:25:46] but this day
[2:25:47] but in the day of the voice of the Seven
[2:25:50] Angels when he shall begin to sound the
[2:25:53] mystery of God will remain in the hood
[2:25:55] this secrets of God will remain known
[2:25:59] I am thankful that you and I are part of
[2:26:03] that mystery we are part of the secret
[2:26:05] in fact the bride is no longer a mystery
[2:26:09] I said it bright it's no longer a
[2:26:11] mystery there's no secret to the bride
[2:26:14] anymore she's coming into manifestation
[2:26:20] what do you think the word is doing you
[2:26:22] why do you think it's transform in your
[2:26:24] life why do you think God is working on
[2:26:26] you
[2:26:29] Jesus when he met the woman at the well
[2:26:31] she started at theological discourse
[2:26:34] with him
[2:26:36] he said she said you are not water to to
[2:26:39] draw you want to give me water Jesus
[2:26:41] said he said if you knew who was talking
[2:26:45] for you to you you would ask me for a
[2:26:47] drink
[2:26:48] I wonder if we knew
[2:26:50] who have spoken to us in this day
[2:26:54] do you know who have spoken as it was
[2:26:57] not man from Kentucky
[2:27:00] no this was the message that came from
[2:27:03] the almighty God God took a man with no
[2:27:05] form no comliness no height no looks you
[2:27:10] check Billy Billy Graham and all robots
[2:27:12] powerful men but when he sent the
[2:27:15] messenger to the bride simple humble
[2:27:20] but do you know who has spoken to you
[2:27:23] it was not Mad Max it was the one in
[2:27:27] Revel the one who was determined to
[2:27:29] fulfilled by God predestinated
[2:27:32] listen God's purpose was so powerful in
[2:27:35] his life that he couldn't hold no high
[2:27:37] tension wire
[2:27:40] he wanted to change God's purpose he
[2:27:43] said Lord there's pressure too much I
[2:27:45] can't take it no more my wife got my
[2:27:48] daughter gone it too much
[2:27:54] he couldn't stop God purpose
[2:27:59] [Applause]
[2:28:01] there was not another man to fulfill
[2:28:03] Revelations
[2:28:04] Luke 17.
[2:28:09] hey
[2:28:11] that was written
[2:28:14] in the book long before he came
[2:28:19] I I want to tell you something
[2:28:22] if he was written in the book don't you
[2:28:25] think his purpose for his comment was
[2:28:27] also written in the book
[2:28:33] the reason for which something is
[2:28:35] created born or exist
[2:28:38] if God sent
[2:28:40] Elisa
[2:28:44] we know these things let me remind you
[2:28:50] Abraham said look you mean to say well
[2:28:53] he said no no it's from your loins
[2:28:56] and then the seed came right
[2:28:58] that was the natural seed but the
[2:29:01] natural seed is not as important as the
[2:29:03] spiritual theater
[2:29:05] barbraham said his spiritual seed will
[2:29:07] come the same way though
[2:29:10] just so Jesus came to connect this to
[2:29:13] your funny you and I will one day
[2:29:15] reconnect theory of funny
[2:29:19] let me put it this way no you're
[2:29:22] connecting to your theophany
[2:29:25] [Applause]
[2:29:26] not will connect you know no you are
[2:29:30] connected to your theophany
[2:29:33] [Music]
[2:29:39] axi Lord he said Lord he says surely in
[2:29:43] your word
[2:29:44] this just before he preached chosen up
[2:29:46] right there he says surely in a word I
[2:29:49] don't know where the time going
[2:29:54] look out
[2:29:59] that's idle threat
[2:30:02] purpose is greater than your comfort
[2:30:05] your desires your Ambitions or your
[2:30:09] complaints
[2:30:12] it is greater than all of that purpose
[2:30:15] is the controlling factor of your life
[2:30:18] God's purpose
[2:30:20] [Applause]
[2:30:22] he said Lord surely
[2:30:25] in your word there must be something to
[2:30:27] tell me what my purpose is
[2:30:31] I mean after he the seal is already
[2:30:34] opened he know Malachi four and five
[2:30:37] then God tell Mrs when she asks you Lord
[2:30:40] will Bill married me what to do will I
[2:30:42] leave the house you know because she was
[2:30:44] looking after Joseph
[2:30:45] and she opened the Bible and she opened
[2:30:47] up Malachi for behold I give you Elijah
[2:30:50] the prophet she closed the Bible
[2:30:59] and she was confident she's enforced
[2:31:01] again after that God said the date and
[2:31:04] everything for my Ram to marry her
[2:31:07] amen I'm sure when Revelation turns them
[2:31:09] come he knew he was that when you really
[2:31:12] sealed you realize that he spent more
[2:31:14] time in the same seal talking about the
[2:31:16] ministry of the son of man he was not
[2:31:18] elevating himself he was elevated in
[2:31:21] Ministry of God it was God what an
[2:31:23] effect
[2:31:24] the same way that John the Baptist uh
[2:31:27] fulfilled the scripture he was
[2:31:29] fulfilling scripture
[2:31:31] and he said surely Lord if there is
[2:31:33] something there must be something in
[2:31:35] your word that will tell me what my role
[2:31:37] is and he opens his Bible randomly to
[2:31:41] Genesis 24.
[2:31:45] to go find our wife Isaac
[2:31:50] an inclusive Bible because now he knows
[2:31:53] that his ministry is to get a wife for
[2:31:57] the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:31:59] you know what he preach after I believe
[2:32:01] he says sheep
[2:32:03] I'm ashamed I didn't realize what my
[2:32:05] calling was and next message he preached
[2:32:08] was chosen of a bride
[2:32:13] the whole message is designed to choose
[2:32:16] a bride and to dress a wife for the Lord
[2:32:19] Jesus Christ
[2:32:22] [Applause]
[2:32:26] no
[2:32:28] we make the mistake of the fine Brother
[2:32:31] right
[2:32:33] but you cannot minimize his ministry
[2:32:37] don't try to take away listen he was a
[2:32:40] friend of God
[2:32:43] he was a friend of God
[2:32:45] he knew God in a personal way he knew
[2:32:48] what he looked like his only he could
[2:32:50] tell us he looked like half man
[2:32:52] we're gonna take some Roma Italian
[2:32:54] painting all kind of thing with all kind
[2:32:56] of fish I think he said no no he's not
[2:32:58] like that this was taken from the uh the
[2:33:01] ritual rulan Jesus he said that is how
[2:33:04] he looks like because he saw him
[2:33:07] he was a friend of the the Lord Jesus
[2:33:10] Christ
[2:33:11] amen he said no I realize I was sent to
[2:33:15] choose a wife so do not underestimate
[2:33:18] the ministry of the prophet
[2:33:20] you cannot take his place you cannot
[2:33:22] replace him his ministry has already
[2:33:25] come and God
[2:33:27] that is why you honor do you know who
[2:33:29] speaks to you when your pastor stands
[2:33:30] before you he's an angel from God that
[2:33:33] is standing before you
[2:33:36] he's ordained by God to see you through
[2:33:40] you cannot supersede them
[2:33:42] you cannot rise higher than him that's
[2:33:45] why you should pray for him
[2:33:48] don't underestimate those establish
[2:33:52] Ministry
[2:33:54] go be on your phone by talking I don't
[2:33:56] like how we preach I didn't like how we
[2:33:57] invite brother Andrew we should invite
[2:33:59] somebody
[2:34:00] not your business
[2:34:03] [Applause]
[2:34:09] you see he's a lover of God at all here
[2:34:11] listen his one desire is to see you come
[2:34:14] to maturity
[2:34:16] to see you come to adoption why do you
[2:34:19] think he'll labor why do you think he
[2:34:21] spent time
[2:34:22] he could have been doing many other
[2:34:24] things in life
[2:34:25] but this is the greatest purpose that he
[2:34:27] will ever serve that one day he can
[2:34:30] present you to the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:34:33] oh my goodness do you know what a joy it
[2:34:36] will be that when I must a servant of
[2:34:39] God can say Lord this is what I have
[2:34:41] done he didn't bury Talent he didn't he
[2:34:44] take his time his resources
[2:34:47] his efforts his pain
[2:34:50] being a pastor or pastor's wife is not
[2:34:52] an easy job you know
[2:34:55] and don't ever feel like this how it is
[2:34:57] you know they have to deal with every
[2:34:59] situation his pain becomes her pain
[2:35:02] when you are sleeping and when you have
[2:35:04] the two miles of dealing with situations
[2:35:07] and this and pressures and all kinds of
[2:35:09] things coming against him when he has to
[2:35:11] deal with the planning of a convention I
[2:35:14] think it's sleepless night
[2:35:17] that's why the officers of the church
[2:35:19] they serve a purpose
[2:35:21] and every one of you that's why you
[2:35:23] shouldn't have sent yourself from church
[2:35:25] you are serving a purpose
[2:35:28] [Applause]
[2:35:32] everything is
[2:35:34] you are born with a purpose
[2:35:37] you are serving an eternal purpose I
[2:35:40] tell the church after coveted about this
[2:35:42] is called long covered
[2:35:44] and long coverage they must stop coming
[2:35:46] to church stop
[2:35:51] really they didn't want to come to
[2:35:53] church in the first place
[2:35:56] I'm not being offensive I'm talking to
[2:35:58] my people
[2:36:01] I never seen the scripture where he said
[2:36:03] extremely service
[2:36:06] it's a forsake not the assembling of
[2:36:09] yourself
[2:36:10] as the man of some long-covered patient
[2:36:13] is
[2:36:19] let's say the pastor may not invite me
[2:36:21] back but let me tell you I want to tell
[2:36:23] you
[2:36:25] you know sometimes preaches because he
[2:36:28] want to share water in mind to your own
[2:36:29] people right
[2:36:31] but you use the excuse right
[2:36:33] so this is the excuse to express
[2:36:37] why why would you want to miss the
[2:36:40] Rapture tell me
[2:36:43] why would you want listen this is the
[2:36:46] picture of Jesus looking at the return
[2:36:47] ruler so every time you look at the
[2:36:50] picture in your home if you have one
[2:36:51] remember I hope you're not looking at
[2:36:54] the ritual again you know
[2:36:59] we have it you know but is he located
[2:37:05] he asked the question he asked for the
[2:37:07] most valuable thing
[2:37:09] good Master what shall I do to be a
[2:37:12] bride
[2:37:15] to be in the brain the highest honor in
[2:37:18] the land in any man's life is to be the
[2:37:21] Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ you will
[2:37:23] sit and you will rule with him
[2:37:27] and would you turn that down
[2:37:32] listen when Rebecca went to you you know
[2:37:34] you know we are privileged you know you
[2:37:37] go into this exam it's an open book exam
[2:37:41] I understand no when we do example you
[2:37:45] never know book
[2:37:46] I want to know them to do exam with our
[2:37:49] open book I still try to figure it out
[2:37:51] at all
[2:37:53] the information
[2:37:56] is ready but you have an open book exam
[2:38:01] because you know the kind of wife you

[2:38:19] chapter and you know where to find
[2:38:20] nothing

[2:38:26] read the book you know precisely that
[2:38:29] way being a doctor easy

[2:38:37] remember you know but you know where to
[2:38:39] find it
[2:38:40] and you know how to apply it
[2:38:42] so it's the application of what you find
[2:38:45] and to put it in the practice
[2:38:47] so then it becomes easy because you
[2:38:49] already pre you have a foreknowledge
[2:38:52] of the whole now you know purpose then
[2:38:56] you can you know first
[2:39:00] you see Joseph when he went down into

[2:39:59] [Applause]
[2:40:04] listen being the bride is not that easy
[2:40:06] take it off
[2:40:07] do you know what it costs Rebecca to be
[2:40:11] the the bride
[2:40:13] she watered 10 camels
[2:40:16] do you know much water camel drink
[2:40:20] a hundred gallons

[2:40:25] so she fill out a thousand gallon tank
[2:40:29] that morning a young girl
[2:40:31] you ask a girl to water One camera yeah
[2:40:34] mad
[2:40:42] [Music]
[2:40:44] and he didn't ask you to watch any
[2:40:46] camera or she offer
[2:40:48] but you see she was in an atmosphere
[2:40:54] she knew that day her blessing was on
[2:40:57] the way
[2:40:58] [Applause]
[2:41:03] she she left home ready
[2:41:05] [Applause]
[2:41:08] just give me water for myself
[2:41:11] she said not only will I give you water
[2:41:13] but I'll Water your camels
[2:41:20] I feel she had training
[2:41:22] [Music]
[2:41:23] listen if you never work hard you can
[2:41:26] never walk I don't know
[2:41:29] [Applause]
[2:41:35] [Music]
[2:41:43] kind of nails them people as well
[2:41:47] you could cook food with that
[2:41:51] you know how to knead flour
[2:41:53] you know the Belair roti
[2:41:59] Brothers KFC and Double Tree the rest of
[2:42:02] your life
[2:42:06] sorry to tell you that McDonald's and
[2:42:08] pizza
[2:42:11] but Rebecca I'm saying this Rebecca
[2:42:15] halapu personal life
[2:42:18] she wasn't just living
[2:42:20] you know for anything she knew exactly
[2:42:23] what she wanted something that will will
[2:42:26] be a blessing to my life
[2:42:28] and there was that quality and character
[2:42:30] inside of her
[2:42:32] so she would have left with a poor
[2:42:34] person she would have gone to the well
[2:42:37] that's why the brothers didn't want you
[2:42:38] to go easier
[2:42:40] because they knew what she meant to the
[2:42:42] family
[2:42:43] [Applause]
[2:42:45] right
[2:42:47] but she knew that this was her calling
[2:42:50] in her life
[2:42:52] and God has sent a prophet and Eli is
[2:42:56] again
[2:42:57] he know exactly what the master wants
[2:43:00] you know the quality you know the
[2:43:03] character he got it nature
[2:43:07] everything that God does is with purpose
[2:43:09] he made his son for a purpose he made a
[2:43:12] water for our purpose he made life of a
[2:43:15] light for our purpose he made seeds with
[2:43:17] purpose
[2:43:18] you check the main things and you could
[2:43:20] check the old creation everything in God
[2:43:22] has order it has Harmony
[2:43:25] it has continuity
[2:43:30] is a hybrid and it make up fruit and a
[2:43:33] carrier produce itself
[2:43:35] God has had seeds operating for
[2:43:37] thousands and maybe millions of years
[2:43:40] and it hasn't changed
[2:43:43] I want to say this morning
[2:43:45] the same power that was in the word of
[2:43:48] God that they did the entire creation
[2:43:51] the same power will produce a bride
[2:43:54] without spot and without wrinkles
[2:44:01] and the greatest message
[2:44:04] that has ever hit the face of the Earth
[2:44:06] has come in this time to bring a
[2:44:10] restored bride
[2:44:13] and by God's grace that eagle have went
[2:44:16] searching
[2:44:18] that light went searching
[2:44:20] you know it's like an exercise missile
[2:44:22] when did that first come about now we
[2:44:24] know technology is a little more
[2:44:25] advanced than that it could switch out
[2:44:28] and be directional nothing can stop it
[2:44:31] anymore
[2:44:32] it will fine you exactly where you are
[2:44:39] and it is determined for one purpose
[2:44:41] listen in God rich and mercy
[2:44:45] Abraham said you sometimes we question
[2:44:47] what I will make it or not
[2:44:50] here's my position on that berbraham
[2:44:52] said if God wanted me to be an
[2:44:54] antichrist he said that is what I want
[2:44:57] to be
[2:44:58] you know why he could say that because
[2:45:00] he knew God purpose was greater than him
[2:45:04] his exists if that is God's purpose for
[2:45:07] me that's what I want to be
[2:45:09] if he sends me to Hell after all I've
[2:45:11] done he said Lord that's what I want us
[2:45:14] I will still do what I'm doing because
[2:45:16] I'd rather serve your purpose
[2:45:19] and we should live life to serve his
[2:45:21] purpose
[2:45:24] Joseph
[2:45:27] as I was saying Joseph went down he was
[2:45:30] sold into slavery
[2:45:31] everything is connected or no
[2:45:34] you see the whole plan of God from then
[2:45:36] to no
[2:45:37] it's a whole plan of God that is now we
[2:45:40] can see it in review
[2:45:41] what has been done but now we are living
[2:45:44] in the climax
[2:45:45] we are down to the end of the line what
[2:45:48] was in types and shadows the reality
[2:45:51] the perfect realization of what he had
[2:45:54] in his great mind is coming to
[2:45:56] fulfillment
[2:45:58] that's why he saved the best for last
[2:46:05] not that we are the best
[2:46:08] maybe we are the weakest
[2:46:10] you think of men like Paul and Peter and
[2:46:13] all those great men that even the men
[2:46:15] who lived the truly Reformation the kind
[2:46:18] of standard decision they make maybe I
