[8:32] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[8:39] What can make me whole again?
[8:45] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[8:51] Oh, precious
[8:54] is the flow

[10:21] heads. We want to have a word of prayer.
[10:22] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[10:23] presence. We thank you for the faith
[10:25] that placed in our hearts to believe you
[10:26] and trust you. We come to trust you this
[10:28] evening. May you have your own way.
[10:31] Bless this communion service in a
[10:32] special way. In Jesus name we ask it.
[10:35] Amen. And amen.
[10:38] Amazing
[10:41] grace,
[10:43] how sweet
[10:46] the sound
[10:49] that
[10:53] wretched like me.
[10:56] [Music]
[11:01] Once was lost,
[11:05] but now
[11:08] I'm found my Lord. But now
[11:16] I see
[11:19] through many dangers,
[11:21] through many
[11:25] dangerous
[11:28] to
[11:30] snares.
[11:32] I have
[11:34] already
[11:37] become.
[11:40] Hallelujah. Oh, his grace
[11:46] that brought
[11:48] me save
[11:51] thus far

[12:31] Praise God.
[12:33] Praise God.
[12:35] Praise God.
[12:38] Praise God.
[12:40] Praise God.
[12:45] Amen. Let's bow heads. We want to pray
[12:47] this for this evening offering. Father
[12:49] God, we pray and bless and sanctify the
[12:50] offering we picked up may be used for
[12:52] the food of the gospel. In Jesus name I
[12:55] ask it. Amen.
[12:58] We walk in
[13:04] such a beautiful
[13:07] light.
[13:09] Oh, comes where the dew drops of mercies
[13:18] are bright.
[13:20] Shine all
[13:24] around us by day and by night.
[13:31] Jesus
[13:33] the light of
[13:35] the world.
[13:38] We walk in the light.
[13:40] We'll walk in
[13:43] the light.
[13:45] Such a beautiful
[13:48] light.
[13:51] Comes where the dew drops
[13:55] of mercies
[13:58] are bright.
[14:01] Shine all around us
[14:06] by day and by night.
[14:11] Is Jesus
[14:13] the light of for the last time we'd walk
[14:17] in the light. Oh hallelujah.
[14:20] We walk in the light. Oh beautyful
[14:28] light
[14:31] comes when
[14:33] the de drops of mercies
[14:38] are bright.
[14:41] Shine all around us by day and by night.
[14:49] Oh, it's Jesus,
[14:53] the light of the world.
[14:58] Amen. Praise the Lord. So this evening
[15:00] we have an extract from wisdom versus
[15:02] faith that we would hear a portion of it
[15:05] just before we go to the communion. So
[15:06] God bless you. Have a seat, brother
[15:08] Shane. Praise the Lord. down to the dead
[15:10] grave from right there because she
[15:12] doubted one word. Some of them say,
[15:15] "Well, I believe this is true. I believe
[15:17] that's true. I believe God can save, but
[15:19] I don't believe he healed. I believe the
[15:21] Holy Ghost sure fell on the day of
[15:23] Pentecost, but there's no place where
[15:26] there's anything that says the Holy
[15:27] Ghost fell after your Pentecost." Oh,
[15:29] brother.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; That's the way they say it. call
[15:34] themselves the churches of Christ,
[15:37] having a form of godliness but denying
[15:39] the word thereof.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; That's it. See, you must believe. Don't
[15:45] reason. Believe. Don't try to have
[15:48] wisdom. Just believe the word. Wisdom
[15:51] tries to reason and present a better
[15:56] way. Now, that's exactly what Satan told
[15:59] Eve. Now, you're not going to die.
[16:01] Surely you won't because God's a good
[16:04] God. He is a good God. And the only way
[16:06] I can trust him to be a good God that
[16:08] he'll stay at his word.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; How can you expect me to be truthful
[16:11] when I'm not truthful?
[16:14] &gt;&gt; If I tell you one thing, do something
[16:15] else. My word's pretty shaky.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; See, what makes him a good God is
[16:20] because he spoke the word and we're to
[16:23] live by that word.
[16:25] Man shall not live by bread alone, but
[16:26] by every word of God proceedth out of
[16:30] the mouth of God.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Thank God's got to stay with that word.
[16:34] That's what makes him a good God.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Now, if he said, "Well, I let him get by
[16:38] this. I I let him do this. Well, that's
[16:40] all right. Oh, I I I'll move over here."
[16:44] Well, he's a wishy-washy.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; See, he isn't God. He's He's just an
[16:49] ordinary man.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; See, but to be a good God, he has to
[16:53] stay with his word. that puts every
[16:55] child if he'll let this one commit
[16:57] adultery and this other drink a little
[16:59] and and this other one can do lie a
[17:00] little this other can steal a little and
[17:02] this other can do do this then make me
[17:04] just told the line to come in. He's got
[17:06] one way
[17:09] &gt;&gt; and all it goes in is going in that
[17:11] gate.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Straight is a gate.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; Narrow is the way.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; No defilement enter therein. over in
[17:21] Revelation said, "All without are
[17:23] sorcerers,
[17:24] &gt;&gt; whoreongers, and dogs, and so forth.
[17:27] Blessed are he that doeth all his
[17:29] commandments,
[17:31] &gt;&gt; that he may have a right to the tree of
[17:32] life."
[17:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. There's one way that's
[17:34] God. Don't reason out no other way.
[17:36] Well, uh, the Roman church says we are
[17:39] the church. Uh, that that Bible is not
[17:41] even worth the why why you couldn't.
[17:44] Bishop Sheen said to try to live with it
[17:46] was like walking through muddy waters.
[17:48] See,
[17:49] &gt;&gt; see how you go to do that? See, then if
[17:52] he's right, then the Bible's wrong.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible's right, he's wrong.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Now, why you going to say if God's
[17:58] word's right, it's either Bishop Sheen
[18:00] or or the Bible. Not only Bishop Sheen,
[18:02] but Reverend so and so and Dr. So and so
[18:04] and so and so. I wouldn't have called
[18:06] the man's name unless he said on the
[18:07] radio. So, he said that on the radio, so
[18:09] I guess I can call his name. Dr. So and
[18:11] so and so and so said so and so and so
[18:13] and so. Now, who you going to believe?
[18:14] God or them?
[18:16] What? Say it really doesn't mean it just
[18:18] this way. It means it just the way that
[18:20] it's written.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Well, that's the first lie of the devil.
[18:23] He said to Eve, it just really doesn't
[18:25] mean that. Surely God's too good to do
[18:28] that. You won't die. But they did
[18:30] &gt;&gt; and they will every time.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Got to meet the word. Wisdom tries to
[18:35] take a a better way, the way of modern,
[18:40] the way of popularity,
[18:43] the an easier way, find itself around
[18:46] just now you take a fellow here, maybe
[18:49] God to dealing with him. Now, when he
[18:51] thinks he has to come up, he has to make
[18:54] his wife come right to the line. He has
[18:56] to quit his card parties. He has to quit
[18:59] going to the dances. His wife has to let
[19:01] her hair grow out. He has to quit
[19:03] wearing makeup. He has to quit smoking,
[19:07] drinking. He's got to get out of that
[19:08] big society that he's in. Got to humble
[19:11] himself at the altar. He's got to stand
[19:13] and be called a fanatic holy roller. Be
[19:16] elybo. Anything can be called.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll be religious, but I I I'll go
[19:21] down here and join the this church down
[19:22] here. You're too narrow.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; There you are. See, there's a reason.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Reason.
[19:30] Now, we're going to get to a great point
[19:31] in a few minutes on that. See, how you
[19:33] going to know which is right and wrong,
[19:35] man? See, now
[19:38] tries to make the word say something.
[19:40] Knowledge does. Knowledge,
[19:43] wisdom tries to to uh reason.
[19:48] Wisdom finds a better way. There is no
[19:52] other way
[19:54] &gt;&gt; but God's way.
[19:56] Wisdom tries to point out say, "Oh, well
[19:58] now you know we couldn't do that in this
[20:00] time. We must do it anyhow."
[20:04] &gt;&gt; See, tries to find an easier way. Tries
[20:07] to make the Bible say things that it
[20:10] does not say. Now you say, "Oh, Brother
[20:13] Brand, now you're Wait just a moment.
[20:16] We're go back to the seed again." What
[20:19] wasn't the devil trying to do with
[20:20] wisdom? Make God's word say something
[20:23] that it didn't say. Amen.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; He tried to make God's word say
[20:29] something that it didn't say.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; So that's the way it comes today. When
[20:36] they try to make God's word say
[20:38] something that it doesn't say. Well,
[20:40] they say, "Well, I tell you, brother,
[20:42] you ain't got the right interpretation.
[20:43] The Bible said that prophecy is of no
[20:46] private interpretation."
[20:48] Why? Why is it a private interpretation?
[20:51] Why? The word of the Lord came to the
[20:54] prophets. It is interpreted by the
[20:56] prophet.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Can't be of an interpretation private.
[21:00] The prophet's already interpreted to
[21:02] you. There it is written right there.
[21:05] That's the way it's supposed to be.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; God's got to have some fundamental
[21:11] something that all people's got to be
[21:14] judged by. If it's by a church, which
[21:17] one's right?
[21:18] &gt;&gt; About 900 of them.
[21:21] 900 different organizations, pardon me.
[21:23] Which one of them is right? How you know
[21:25] you're going in? What if you're a
[21:27] Methodist and a Baptist is right?
[21:30] What if you're a Pentecostal and
[21:31] Presbyterians are right?
[21:34] What if you're a Catholic and a Lutheran
[21:35] are right? What if your Lutheran and the
[21:37] Catholics are right? There's got to be
[21:40] some foundation somewhere.
[21:43] So if the word in the beginning was the
[21:46] word and the word was with God and the
[21:48] word was God. See the word was in God.
[21:51] It was God. It was his thoughts
[21:54] that was with him always.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; There God's thoughts is as eternal as
[22:00] God is.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; That ain't skim milk, brother.
[22:07] See,
[22:09] &gt;&gt; here it comes. God's thoughts was his
[22:12] word in the beginning.
[22:16] That's in eternity now when beginning
[22:18] first started
[22:20] time. In the beginning was the word.
[22:25] God's thoughts
[22:28] and the word was with God
[22:32] and the word was God.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; His thoughts is what he was.
[22:40] That's you, too. What your thoughts are
[22:43] is what you are.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; No matter what you try to live, but
[22:46] something else, your thoughts is what
[22:47] you are.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; You might go along act like a nice
[22:50] fellow, but in your heart, you're an
[22:51] adulteress. And whatever it is, that's
[22:52] what you are.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Your thoughts. And God's thoughts was
[22:56] his word that was with him and in him.
[22:57] And it was God.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word, and the
[23:01] word was with God. And the word was God.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; And that word was made flesh.
[23:08] God's thoughts was expressed in a human
[23:10] body made flesh and dwelt among us.
[23:14] There you are. Now, if you have eternal
[23:18] life today, you are in God by God's
[23:24] being in you. You are God's express
[23:26] thought.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Then don't listen to any reasonings.
[23:34] Guess your crown be taken give to
[23:35] another. Don't take any reasonings at
[23:38] all. Just believe what God says the
[23:41] truth and stay with it.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Reasonings through wisdom tries to make
[23:47] the word say something it doesn't say.
[23:49] Now you say, "Is that true, Brother
[23:51] Brandon?" Well, let's just go back to
[23:53] Genesis and find out. Let's go to
[23:55] Genesis, the third chapter of Genesis,
[23:58] and we're going to read the the the
[24:00] fourth verse. See, if if wisdom tries to
[24:04] make the word say something that it
[24:05] isn't,
[24:09] the third chapter of Genesis,
[24:12] the fourth verse,
[24:16] and the serpent said unto the woman, ye
[24:19] shall not surely die.
[24:24] See what it presents? What is it? trying
[24:28] to make the word say something that it
[24:31] doesn't say.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; God said you shall die.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; Wisdom is Satan was presenting to her
[24:40] said you shall not surely die.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; See, it's trying to make the word say
[24:46] something that it isn't. So,
[24:49] &gt;&gt; that's what wisdom is today. Oh,
[24:52] brother, how are we carrying on that?
[24:55] seminaries,
[24:57] schools of theology.
[24:59] That's their very nest.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; That's their grassroots
[25:05] is trying to make God's word say
[25:07] something that it doesn't say.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; I challenge anybody to show me the
[25:13] Apostles Creed in the Bible.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; I challenge anybody to show me communion
[25:20] of saints in the Bible.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Both Protestant Catholic believe it.
[25:26] I challenge you to show me any of those
[25:28] things in a Bible.
[25:30] See, it's the grassroots
[25:33] of wisdom trying to reason.
[25:38] Our warfare is not carnal but mighty.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Casting away all reasons.
[25:47] See, pulling down the strongholds of
[25:50] Satan.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. that great flowery beautiful
[25:55] creature, not a slick greaser. No, no,
[25:58] that's on the inside.
[26:01] But outwardly, sin is twice as pretty.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; You know, sin's beautiful.
[26:09] How many men in here and women is past
[26:12] 50 years old? Raise up your hands. I
[26:14] didn't know what to ask the women, but I
[26:17] we all admit the truth. I want to ask
[26:20] you a question.
[26:22] Do you see today that women are twice as
[26:26] pretty, nearly as they used to be on the
[26:28] run average across the world? If that's
[26:30] so, raise up your hand.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Sure. They're twice as pretty as what
[26:35] they used to be. Get some old pictures.
[26:39] Look at grandmother.
[26:41] Long skirts,
[26:43] braid of hair hanging down her back.
[26:47] She wasn't so attractive to look at.
[26:50] Look at the modern one today.
[26:52] Little skin down dress whatever form she
[26:55] can't move without sinning.
[26:58] Walking tipping down the street with all
[27:01] the makeup and cosmetics that Maxu
[27:04] Facture can put on her nearly
[27:07] fixing her hair like some little girl
[27:09] wearing a little skirt just up about
[27:10] above her knees if she's got on any at
[27:12] all.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; But you look at her, she's pretty.
[27:17] Satan knows how to do it.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; He's the author of beauty.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; That type of beauty which results in
[27:26] sin.
[27:28] The earth
[27:30] itself
[27:32] is a womb.
[27:36] Where did God place his seeds?
[27:40] Where's seeds put
[27:42] in a womb?
[27:45] God puts seeds. And what does man do?
[27:47] Like devils in a womb. You'll make a
[27:51] child deformed if he can. That's what
[27:54] devils has done on the earth. Hybriding.
[27:58] Making creatures is not so
[28:04] I better leave off with that. I'll never
[28:07] get the rest of this year got roll down.
[28:10] You know what I mean? That's the reason
[28:11] there's a farm creation about to be
[28:14] cast.
[28:16] God's finished with it. The world's all
[28:19] out of order.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Everything's wrong. The streams are
[28:25] polluted. The air is polluted.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Filth stink.
[28:30] An old Indian not long ago said, "White
[28:33] man, I don't want to live any longer.
[28:36] I'm through with fighting." Said,
[28:38] "Where's my babies? Are they starve to
[28:40] death? Where's my wife?" said, "Before
[28:42] you come here with your women in whiskey
[28:44] and sin, we lived in peace.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; That's our grounds. God, give it to us,
[28:50] but you're taking it away from us.
[28:52] You'll pay for it someday."
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Look at it today in that big pretty
[28:56] deserts and mountains stroed with stink,
[29:02] sin, whiskey bottles, beer cans. Every
[29:06] place is full of taverns and Tommy rot.
[29:09] Reno Nevada in that great desert under
[29:12] nothing but a prostitution.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; The great cities are the even the air
[29:17] and the atmosphere is contaminated.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Once the pretty mountains grow now just
[29:24] cut up with all kinds of everything
[29:26] else. Where the trees grow, they're cut
[29:28] out. Where the deserts, the waters flow
[29:30] free. It's contaminated. The whole world
[29:33] is going to have a
[29:36] a cast.
[29:38] The earth's going to give forth her
[29:40] child from the seed
[29:42] been perverted by devils tearing it up
[29:44] and working it up.
[29:47] Sure it is. It's perverted creation.
[29:51] God will cast it away and start over
[29:54] again.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. What did it come from? One
[29:57] person believing one little disbelieving
[29:59] one little phase of God's word.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; The whole earth is groaning. The Bible
[30:05] says that even nature itself is groaning
[30:08] for that day of release
[30:10] &gt;&gt; waiting for the manifestations of the
[30:11] sons of God.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; The trees are striving in vain. The
[30:16] flowers are trying to brighten the way
[30:17] for the but they're growing and crying
[30:19] and knowing something wrong. Perverted.
[30:22] The womb can't bearing forth that
[30:24] perfect because she's perverted. The
[30:26] ground stinks. She's bathed with
[30:28] innocent blood. She's got She's like a I
[30:32] could say something might be too flat.
[30:37] It's it's it's stink. God said it stinks
[30:40] before him.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; So filthy.
[30:47] Walk into a restroom, the urinal and
[30:50] just stink contaminated.
[30:53] That's exactly what the world smells
[30:54] through. Like God smelling to it. Filth.
[30:58] The whole thing is filthy.
[31:01] God will burst her to pieces. I'll
[31:04] create a new heavens and earth. He said,
[31:06] &gt;&gt; "Yes, sir." What is it? Her womb hasn't
[31:09] brought forth a millennium. She's
[31:11] brought forth a perverted thing. Why?
[31:13] Trying to be wisdom.
[31:16] Got nothing against Florida. I don't
[31:19] mean this for you people from Florida,
[31:21] but when I crossed and went to Florida
[31:23] the first time and come back to the
[31:24] Georgia lines there, I stood right there
[31:26] and I said, "As an American citizen, I
[31:29] give my part of it back to the seinals
[31:31] where it belongs."
[31:33] While they take better care of their
[31:35] yards than I do my hair, everything
[31:38] feathered, the palm trees have got
[31:40] lights all over it, big swanky yachts
[31:42] and things trying to bring a millennium
[31:45] without repentance.
[31:47] I got help.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; To me, it's a bunch of nothing.
[31:52] A million times more. I'd rather climb
[31:54] in British Columbia to the top of a hill
[31:56] and look across the mountains that God
[31:57] created and man's hands never touched
[31:59] it.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Certainly
[32:03] going to these cities, the big homes,
[32:05] that that don't attract me. I hate that
[32:08] kind of stuff.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; But I know that one day, one day,
[32:13] &gt;&gt; it'll be changed.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. She'll cast forth her afflicted
[32:18] child,
[32:20] the earth. It'll be changed one day.
[32:23] Okay? Faith bleeds and it is written and
[32:27] says the word has no flaws.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Did you ever hear ministers say, "Well,
[32:33] I tell you the King James version or the
[32:36] this revised version or this year, it's
[32:39] just a it's just a little different. It
[32:41] really didn't really mean that." Have
[32:43] you heard that? Oh my. the world's
[32:46] contaminated with it. See, but
[32:49] faith don't believe that.
[32:52] Faith believes a God that can make me
[32:55] can keep that book in order for me to
[32:57] live by.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; If the God who made me is going to judge
[33:00] me can't keep his book in order, then
[33:02] he's a very poor God.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; I believe every word of it truth.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; What does this do to believe that? It
[33:10] gives faith a perfect resting place in
[33:13] it.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you cannot disbelieve that
[33:17] that word's messed with in any way.
[33:19] You've got to believe it just the way it
[33:20] is.
[33:22] If you try to use wisdom to say, "Now
[33:24] look here. It's not reasonable that God
[33:26] said would do his thing like this, but
[33:28] God did do it." That's right. Now, if
[33:31] you say, "Well, now if God did this, if
[33:33] he uh tuck a man's life because he was a
[33:35] Levite, put his hand on the ark when he
[33:37] was about to fall, no matter how much he
[33:38] was, and he tuck his life for it. God
[33:40] said just Levites alone to touch that.
[33:44] You tuck it. That's what got David
[33:46] stirred up. You know, a Levite was
[33:49] nothing but a Levite was supposed to
[33:50] touch that ark. And here the ark was
[33:52] coming right back for a revival. And one
[33:55] outside of that tried to handle the
[33:57] word. That goes to show
[34:01] that only the anointed of God is to
[34:04] touch that word.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; These creeds and denominations got no
[34:08] business tampering with it.
[34:11] That's the Holy Spirit's got a right to
[34:13] that word.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; And it's death for any other to touch
[34:17] it.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Or to disbelieve any of it or teach it.
[34:20] The same will be taken this part out of
[34:22] the book of life.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Don't put your hands on it. Stay away
[34:27] from it. Listen. Believe just what it
[34:29] says. Don't take nobody else's word.
[34:31] Take what it says.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Stay right with the word.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; It's death to do anything else to it.
[34:37] Now cause it. What does faith do? It
[34:40] believes it just the way it is. That's
[34:42] the way God has preserved it down
[34:43] through the age. And here it is. It's a
[34:44] word of God for me. God honors that.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; It gives a perfect faith in its truness.
[34:51] How could you ever marry a woman?
[34:55] If that young girl had had had run out
[34:58] and done everything and lived in
[35:00] prostitution and everything else and and
[35:02] you went and got her in a house of
[35:03] prostitution, come out and she was she
[35:05] said, "Well, I I I'll try to be a better
[35:07] girl." You can't have faith in that
[35:09] woman. See, you can't do it. How can a
[35:12] woman have faith in a man that's did the
[35:14] same thing? You just can't build your
[35:16] faith there. There's nothing to build
[35:17] on. See, you can't do it. How could you
[35:20] go out here and say, "Here's a boat.
[35:22] It's got a lot of holes in it, and I put
[35:24] some grass sacks in it. Perhaps maybe
[35:25] it'll it'll stem the tide across the
[35:27] river, and I wouldn't want to take a
[35:28] chance on it when there's one sitting
[35:30] here. It's built right."
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Sure. Why would we take some man-made
[35:34] theology with holes all in prove that
[35:36] it's wrong? See one here's one sitting
[35:39] here that's reading the word of God who
[35:41] stem the tide to every hard storm and
[35:43] hail.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; She's held just as true as she could be.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; And always will.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; All right. Heavens and earth will pass
[35:51] away said Jesus but my word shall not.
[35:53] Why? They're eternal.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; There was in the beginning. He just come
[35:56] here to express God's word. He was God's
[36:00] expression. God was expressing himself
[36:02] through his son. These all started in
[36:04] Genesis the seed chapter and has been
[36:07] ever since ever since been on the scene.
[36:10] It's been the same thing, a fight
[36:12] between wisdom and faith. Always fight.
[36:16] So wisdom is of the devil and for his
[36:20] children.
[36:22] Did you ever notice
[36:25] all of you seen sheep? All of you seen
[36:28] goats.
[36:30] But you know the blate of them two is so
[36:34] close it takes a real shepherd to tell
[36:36] the difference. You put an old goat out
[36:38] there and let him blade. Bait. Then you
[36:40] go over here and put a sheep there and
[36:41] let him blade. Listen at it. They're
[36:44] saying it's a lie. But a real shepherd
[36:46] can catch that voice. Jesus said, "My
[36:48] sheep know my voice."
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; They can tell where's a goat.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Well, he's a sheep himself.
[36:56] My
[36:56] &gt;&gt; he my sheep know my voice. Strangers
[36:59] they won't follow. What is his voice?
[37:01] Here it is. The word.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; My sheep know my voice. See, they won't
[37:06] let anybody say, "Well, now here I'm
[37:07] talking the voice of God, too. This says
[37:09] this, there, but it's see." We'll get to
[37:12] that in just a little bit. Cool that off
[37:13] for you.
[37:15] Now, now you see that the seed word
[37:19] cannot grow in the atmosphere then of
[37:22] knowledge.
[37:24] Is that right?
[37:26] &gt;&gt; See, as soon as knowledge mixes with
[37:29] faith, it dies. Right there.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Eve come and say, "The Lord God said,
[37:37] the day we eat thereof, that day we
[37:39] die."
[37:40] And she stopped to see what he had said.
[37:42] He said, "But listen, my dear, you
[37:44] lovely little thing. See, surely God
[37:48] made you for a purpose." You know that's
[37:49] right. See, you're woman. You were made
[37:51] for this purpose. That's what it is. You
[37:53] don't know it now, but you were made for
[37:55] this purpose. Oh, you're a lovely little
[37:57] thing, dear. Look at those dainty little
[37:59] hands. See? Well, sure you would.
[38:01] Surely, but he said if we if we did,
[38:03] we'd die.
[38:05] He said, but oh, you think that a good
[38:08] loving father, God would do a thing like
[38:11] that. What she do? She listened to
[38:12] reason, tuck his wisdom, said it's a
[38:14] tree delight. One can be desired of it.
[38:17] And she fell for it.
[38:20] Exactly. And when she did, what
[38:21] happened? like it would to any woman. As
[38:25] soon as you fall for it, it finishes
[38:28] right there. That's right. Now, you see
[38:31] the seed that she was holding and would
[38:35] have finally become a mother by the will
[38:37] of God through a spoken word. She would
[38:39] have finally become a mother. But she
[38:42] couldn't wait into that. Now see then as
[38:46] soon as she did that accepted wisdom
[38:49] with the word and wisdom was contrary to
[38:53] the word.
[38:55] You understand? Say amen.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; See if wisdom is with the word and
[38:59] proves to be at the word and the word
[39:01] produces itself by the same thing it is
[39:04] the word.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; But if wisdom is against the word not
[39:08] with the word but trying to find
[39:09] something to add to it or take from it.
[39:11] It's of the devil.
[39:14] And
[39:15] Holy Ghost seeds of the Bible cannot
[39:19] grow in the atmosphere of wisdom.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; That kills every seminary in the
[39:24] countrymen.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; That knocks the holes right out to them
[39:29] and punctures them and the judgment
[39:31] flows in. That's
[39:33] &gt;&gt; right.
[39:34] Amen.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; It should certainly see because the word
[39:41] cannot grow with wisdom.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Worldly wisdom won't do it. Eve was to
[39:48] believe the word as it was given to her.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[39:54] &gt;&gt; She wasn't listening to anybody else say
[39:56] anything about it. Just the way it was
[39:58] given to her.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; That's the way she's supposed to believe
[40:00] it.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. There never been a death if she'd
[40:03] believe that.
[40:05] That's right. And a man or a woman
[40:08] that'll take God's word just the way
[40:09] it's given to us,
[40:12] &gt;&gt; hold it the way God said it, it's life.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; But to mix it with some wisdom of some
[40:17] organization, you die right there.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Just like it did in the first. That's a
[40:22] seed. That's way That's way it acted the
[40:24] first time. That's the way it'll act
[40:25] every time. It always has. God permit
[40:27] we'll prove that through the Bible this
[40:29] morning.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the only way it can grow is
[40:32] to separate itself from all reasonings
[40:34] or anything else and just believe the
[40:35] word.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Eve was supposed to take it just the way
[40:39] God give it to us. And I've expressed
[40:41] and told you that I believe God has
[40:43] preserved and kept this Bible.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; That's the way God give it to me here.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; I don't want no other wisdom. I want
[40:51] just the way God said it here.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope I don't hurt you. But if the
[40:59] Bible said that I must repent,
[41:02] &gt;&gt; it means repent.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Not do penance, but repent.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible said me be baptized in the
[41:10] name of Jesus Christ. It didn't mean
[41:11] something else.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Didn't mean father, son, holy ghost. It
[41:15] said that. Well, you say Matthew 28:19
[41:17] said baptize them in the name of the
[41:19] father, son, holy ghost. That's exactly
[41:20] what it was. Now, if that isn't right,
[41:23] if they haven't got the right thing,
[41:24] then the faith that Peter had to baptize
[41:26] in the name of Jesus Christ and all the
[41:28] rest of the Bible, then they had a a
[41:30] false revelation that God blessed. That
[41:32] brings him right back. He should have
[41:33] blessed Eve in the beginning.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; The name of the father, son, holy ghost.
[41:38] That's three titles. It's only one name.
[41:41] You cannot be baptized in the name of
[41:43] father, son, holy ghost until you're
[41:44] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[41:46] Because that is the name of the father,
[41:47] son, holy ghost.
[41:48] The whole Bible is wrote out like that.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Every person in the Bible is ever
[41:52] baptized is baptized in the name of
[41:54] Jesus Christ.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Nobody in the scripture ever baptized in
[41:58] titles of father, son, holy ghost.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; And everyone was baptized in the name of
[42:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ was baptized in
[42:04] the name of father, son, holy ghost.
[42:06] Everyone was baptized the titles of
[42:08] father, son, holy ghost is baptized in
[42:09] no name at all. Amen.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; A title like minister, reverend, doctor,
[42:14] whatever more, father, son, human, wife
[42:18] titles
[42:20] said, don't make any difference. Then
[42:22] put your title on your check, not your
[42:23] name, and see where it goes. She
[42:27] &gt;&gt; say, I signed this check in the name of
[42:29] the housewife.
[42:32] Well,
[42:32] &gt;&gt; that make just as much sense as would
[42:34] just believe God's word with the
[42:35] revelation laying right there before
[42:37] you.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; So, sure. Yeah.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; All right.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; It's supposed to believe it the way God
[42:44] said it.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; And it does not contradict itself. If it
[42:48] does, you come show me.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Don't contradict itself. Not at all.
[42:53] Satan might contradict it to you, but he
[42:56] can't to the word. So, the word won't
[42:58] stand that. No sir. That's the age old
[43:01] thing. It's been thought of, but it's
[43:03] never been proven yet.
[43:05] Let's follow these two sources
[43:08] or what you might call atmospheres and
[43:10] see what they create. Let's follow them
[43:13] for a few minutes.
[43:16] Atmosphere. Both of these sources will
[43:19] create an atmosphere. I want to ask you
[43:21] something. Did you ever go in a church I
[43:24] say this reverently now and with just to
[43:27] make a point. God forbid. Did you ever
[43:29] go in a church where the pastor's real
[43:32] starchy?
[43:35] The congregation's the same way.
[43:40] See, what is it? It's that atmosphere
[43:43] that brought it. Go into a place where
[43:45] the pastor says, "Now wait a minute.
[43:47] There's no such a thing as that
[43:48] nonsense. I don't believe in such a
[43:50] thing as divine healing about the
[43:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost." And you'll
[43:53] see everyone in them congregation. If he
[43:54] ain't if there's an eagle in there
[43:56] somewhere, he'll get out and look under
[43:57] that bunch of chickens. He
[43:59] &gt;&gt; sure will. Exactly.
[44:02] He'll leave it.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; He sure will. He can't stand that.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; He's an eagle. He's a sky built bird,
[44:10] not a barnyard. Yes, sir. Now, here he
[44:14] is.
[44:16] And now we find out that those
[44:18] atmospheres and you get in wherever the
[44:21] those things where faith is taught.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; In a church, you'll find a church in
[44:26] that atmosphere.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Let let me get this to you. So
[44:31] if you see go as reason and people come
[44:35] among the saints where they're praying
[44:38] believers Paul said he didn't find any
[44:40] in the city only Timothy that was like
[44:42] precious faith that he had you know
[44:44] &gt;&gt; the rest of them are all denominational
[44:47] see but when he got into that atmosphere
[44:50] see he you find things going on that the
[44:55] atmosphere is created you find people
[44:57] living by faith when you get into a
[44:58] place where it says my why The Bible's
[45:01] true. God heals. You walk around that
[45:03] congregation, you find why I was dying
[45:05] with cancer. I was healed. I was once
[45:07] blind. I see. And a stranger said, "Why?
[45:10] What you mean? What was Matthew? I'll
[45:12] show you on my record. Come home with
[45:13] me. Come eat dinner with me and I'll
[45:15] show you something. I got a record up
[45:16] there. My neighbors know that I was in
[45:18] this condition. I was paralyzed for
[45:19] years. I was praying for it." See, what
[45:21] is it? That that word in that church,
[45:24] that group of believers has created that
[45:26] atmosphere. Now, how is the word in its
[45:30] simplicity but yet in its completeness
[45:32] ever going to grow in a place where
[45:34] knowledge overshadows that and says it
[45:36] can't be so?
[45:39] &gt;&gt; It can't.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; So where knowledge is preached from a
[45:43] seminary the children die.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Where faith is preached from the word
[45:50] the children live. Amen. That's the
[45:52] difference. Just life and death.
[45:55] Could
[46:02] we all stand?

[46:12] Lord, Father. We thank you. We praise
[46:15] you for your word. We praise you for

[49:50] in this
[49:53] like turn your Bibles to 1 Corinthians
[49:55] chapter 11. We're going to read from
[49:57] verse 23.
[49:59] [Music]
[50:03] For I've received of the Lord that which
[50:05] also I delivered unto you, that the Lord
[50:07] Jesus the same night in which he was
[50:09] betrayed took bread. But when he had
[50:12] given thanks, he broke it and said,
[50:13] "Take, eat. This is my body which is
[50:16] broken for you. This do in remembrance
[50:18] of me." After the same manner also he
[50:21] took the cup. When he had sucked,
[50:23] saying, "This cup is a new testament in
[50:25] my blood. This do ye as often you drink
[50:27] it in reme in remembrance of me. For as
[50:31] often as you eat this bread and drink
[50:33] this cup, you do show the Lord's death
[50:35] till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall
[50:38] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[50:40] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[50:42] body and blood of the Lord. But let a
[50:44] man examine himself, and so let him eat
[50:47] of that bread and drink of that cup. For
[50:50] he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily
[50:53] eatth and drinkketh damnation to
[50:54] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[50:58] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[51:00] among you and many sleep. For if we
[51:04] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[51:06] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[51:09] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[51:11] be condemned with the world. Let's bow
[51:13] our heads. Heavenly Father, we pray this
[51:17] day that your Holy Spirit will bless the
[51:19] articles that have been prepared of the
[51:21] bread, the wine. Bless, oh God, your
[51:24] feet washing. Bless the believers as
[51:27] they look to you in honoring this
[51:29] commandment. Grant it father in Jesus
[51:32] name I ask it. Amen. At this time you
[51:34] bow ahead close your eyes as we have a
[51:36] minute of silence as you pray for the
[51:39] ministry and the ministry pray for you.
[52:10] Praise the Lord. My seats
[52:12] deacons will be
