[52:51] I'm sorry I'm getting a little
[52:56] all right
[53:00] don't be scared of the many scriptures
[53:02] okay just
[53:03] um by time I'm done you'll see the
[53:06] original eye and you can I mean don't
[53:09] even touch all of them I'm not likely to
[53:11] but when I finish you can go and preach
[53:13] the rest of it yourself okay
[53:15] no serious you'll find out
[53:18] all right
[53:19] um
[53:20] Saint John 6 verses 1 to 14 that's the
[53:24] one I'll read
[53:25] and then when you sit down I also read
[53:28] Romans 4 16 to 25.
[53:31] and Philippians 4 6 and 4th
[53:34] Thessalonians 5 18 I read the last three
[53:38] after you have shut down
[53:41] and my contact scriptures are first king
[53:43] 17-1-16 that's Elijah and the video of
[53:46] zaripat and Zechariah 4 6 to 10 don't
[53:50] despise the day of small things it's in
[53:53] Luke 9 25 the what is a man advantaged
[53:57] if he gains the whole world and loses on
[53:59] soul
[54:01] and then and then first came with each
[54:04] other six
[54:05] under six
[54:07] godliness with content man is great
[54:09] again amen
[54:11] so um while you're mentioning let me
[54:14] read Saint John 6 and verses 1 to 14.
[54:18] after this thing Jesus Went Over the Sea
[54:20] of Galilee which is the Sea of tiberias
[54:24] and a great model followed him because
[54:26] they saw the Miracles which he did on
[54:28] them that were deceased
[54:30] and Jesus went up into protein and there
[54:33] he sat with his disciples
[54:36] and the Passover a feast of the Jews was
[54:38] nine when Jesus then lifted up his eyes
[54:41] and saw a great company come unto him he
[54:44] saith unto Philip When shall we buy
[54:47] bread that these may eat
[54:51] Jesus he didn't claim to know it or
[54:54] anyone because this things like this he
[54:57] gives the other person the feeling of
[54:59] importance a feeling that they they
[55:02] count their opinion matters you know
[55:04] because the Bible said he already knew
[55:06] what he was going to do so he wasn't
[55:08] deceiving them but he just wanted them
[55:09] to just the the art and the skill of you
[55:13] know managing the other person their
[55:16] different their differences their
[55:18] reality the different that may be
[55:20] different from yours and usually is
[55:23] so and this is said to prove him for he
[55:28] himself knew what he would do
[55:31] Philip answered him
[55:33] 200 penny worth of bread is not
[55:35] sufficient to them
[55:36] for them that every one of them may take
[55:39] a little
[55:42] one of his disciples Andrew Simon
[55:44] Peter's brother said unto him
[55:46] there's a lot here which has five Valley
[55:49] Loaves and two small fishes but what are
[55:53] they among so many
[55:55] and Jesus said make the man sit down
[55:59] now there was much grass in the place
[56:02] so the men sat down in number about five
[56:05] thousand
[56:07] and Jesus Took the laws and when he had
[56:09] given thanks he distributed to the
[56:12] disciples and the disciples to them that
[56:15] was set down and likewise of the fishes
[56:18] as much as they would now this was a
[56:21] buffet they ate all they wanted all they
[56:24] wanted
[56:25] all they wanted
[56:28] so when you talk about the buffet old
[56:30] country and all that Jesus did it that's
[56:32] why it's coming from
[56:34] that old and this was without money
[56:36] without price so I was
[56:38] you open a buffet here without money
[56:40] without price
[56:41] forget it don't even try it people will
[56:44] go there they will put in their pockets
[56:46] and their food in their bags everywhere
[56:49] some of you here will do the same I know
[56:52] all right
[56:55] verse 12.
[56:57] when they were filled he said unto his
[56:59] disciples this is speaking about
[57:01] abundance
[57:02] from nothing to abundance from a proper
[57:06] to a King do you speaking about
[57:08] abundance when they were feeling
[57:10] disciples gather up the fragments that
[57:13] remain that nothing be lost
[57:16] therefore
[57:18] they gathered them together and filled
[57:22] 12 baskets with the fragments of the
[57:24] five Valley loaves which remained over
[57:27] and above unto them that had eaten
[57:31] then those men when they had seen the
[57:34] miracle that Jesus did said
[57:37] these are the truth that Prophet that
[57:40] should come into the world
[57:42] Amen Let me see that
[57:53] Romans 4 and verse
[57:57] 16 through 25.
[58:01] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[58:04] my grace
[58:05] to the end the promise might be short to
[58:08] all the seed
[58:10] not to that only which is of the law but
[58:14] that also which is of the faith of
[58:16] Abraham who is the father of us all
[58:19] as it is written I have made thee a
[58:21] father of many nations
[58:23] before him whom he believed
[58:26] even God who could net the dead and call
[58:29] it those things which be not as though
[58:31] they were
[58:32] who against hope believed in Hope
[58:36] that he might become the father of many
[58:40] nations according to that which was
[58:42] spoken so shall thy seed be
[58:45] and be not weak in faith
[58:49] I'm going to try to show you how he was
[58:51] not weak in faith
[58:53] because many people naturally because
[58:56] faith faith comes by hearing the word of
[58:58] God but even many times when you have
[59:01] the word of God people still falter you
[59:04] and I all of us still do even Abraham
[59:07] did
[59:09] as really when the promise is not really
[59:12] doesn't seem to make sense or doesn't is
[59:14] lingering and he's not like you know
[59:17] coming to pass the way and when you
[59:20] think it should
[59:22] verse 19 and bring no weak in faith he
[59:25] considered not his own body now dead
[59:28] there are things he considered our
[59:30] things he did not consider
[59:32] because he considered his body dead that
[59:34] was dead he would not have faith just
[59:37] simple just simple deductions there
[59:40] so it wasn't like Abraham just some you
[59:43] know something just held into no he was
[59:44] human like you and I Flesh and Blood
[59:47] subject to the same Temptations like the
[59:50] Bible said of Elijah
[59:52] same thing exactly same doubt same when
[59:56] is this going to happen is not happening
[59:57] and all that same thing exactly but he
[1:00:00] learned because he was a friend of God
[1:00:02] like you have a chance to be a friend of
[1:00:03] God now to walk with God and God can
[1:00:06] speak to you from his word like he spoke
[1:00:08] to Abraham Abraham didn't even have the
[1:00:10] word didn't have the Bible he had to
[1:00:12] depend on a relationship with God but
[1:00:14] you have the Bible you have the
[1:00:16] preaching you have the words you have
[1:00:17] the prophet to let you know how to hear
[1:00:21] from God
[1:00:22] so but Abram had been taught by God how
[1:00:26] to maintain his faith
[1:00:29] and be not weak in faith he considered
[1:00:31] not his own body now dead it wasn't like
[1:00:34] the body was dead dead the body was not
[1:00:37] a state a ship to give forth a child at
[1:00:40] all so if he considered that how is he
[1:00:43] going to believe you consider that
[1:00:45] the body is dead
[1:00:47] I just gonna believe it's it's a tougher
[1:00:50] thing to believe it'll just be
[1:00:51] struggling against you know what his
[1:00:54] reality is telling him
[1:00:56] but the thing was don't even consider
[1:00:58] that
[1:01:00] in the University of Harvard and all
[1:01:03] these other Great Schools University of
[1:01:06] Lagos forgive me I don't want to use
[1:01:07] your school so that you don't feel bad
[1:01:09] at me
[1:01:10] or wherever you went to school
[1:01:13] they'll tell you that doesn't make sense
[1:01:16] well this is the school from above
[1:01:18] amen so this has nothing to do with what
[1:01:22] man thinks of one Marathon too many
[1:01:24] times we complicate the simple I always
[1:01:27] say we over complicate this you know we
[1:01:30] don't just complicate we over complicate
[1:01:32] the simple things all of us do may you
[1:01:35] all of us do and it's the first way out
[1:01:38] of it is catch ourselves and know I got
[1:01:41] to move away from here
[1:01:42] so Abram had been taught by God how to
[1:01:46] like maintain faith
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:50] you considered not his own body now dead
[1:01:52] when he was about 100 years old neither
[1:01:54] yet the deadness of Sierra's womb
[1:01:56] inconsiderate at all
[1:01:58] and because he didn't consider it his
[1:02:00] Target not at the promise of God through
[1:02:02] unbelief because he consider it all
[1:02:05] the upcoming
[1:02:07] so it didn't even
[1:02:10] amen so even you can hear from God and
[1:02:14] still have unbelief
[1:02:17] because you are considering the wrong
[1:02:20] things
[1:02:21] the things you should not consider are
[1:02:23] the things that maybe possibly your
[1:02:25] conscious that's what many of us know
[1:02:26] many times I was in our self-talk our
[1:02:29] talk with ourselves all the time we're
[1:02:32] considering the things that we should
[1:02:35] not consider
[1:02:37] so he's tagging another promise of God
[1:02:39] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:02:42] given glory to God so there are two
[1:02:43] sides here one side you consider it and
[1:02:46] then you get unbelief one side here you
[1:02:48] are given glory to God and thanking God
[1:02:51] so the two sides there
[1:02:53] foreign
[1:03:03] his persuasion gets got stronger and
[1:03:06] stronger and stronger until he became
[1:03:08] fully persuaded and being fully
[1:03:10] persuaded that what God had promised he
[1:03:13] was able also to perform
[1:03:15] and therefore it was impeded to him for
[1:03:18] righteousness just gave it to him
[1:03:21] are you with me
[1:03:24] yeah
[1:03:26] just because Abram knew what side what
[1:03:30] to consider want to look at and God saw
[1:03:33] him the way he was God just gave it to
[1:03:36] him Abraham wasn't righteous none of us
[1:03:37] is righteous it was imputed it was given
[1:03:40] to him like okay you are righteous
[1:03:43] because of this he got the results he
[1:03:46] was looking for because of that
[1:03:51] night was not written
[1:03:54] for he's sick alone that he was impeded
[1:03:56] to him
[1:03:58] but for us also
[1:04:00] [Applause]
[1:04:02] to whom it shall be impeded if we
[1:04:04] believe in him the rest of Jesus our
[1:04:07] lord from the dead
[1:04:09] who was delivered for our offenses and
[1:04:12] was raised again for our justification
[1:04:13] amen
[1:04:16] First Kings
[1:04:19] I know I think I'll leave that
[1:04:22] that's my connect scripture
[1:04:24] Philippians 4 and verse 6.
[1:04:29] for this lands fight
[1:04:34] all right
[1:04:37] Philippians 4 and verse 6. be careful
[1:04:39] for nothing
[1:04:40] but in everything by prayer and
[1:04:42] supplication with Thanksgiving that your
[1:04:44] request be made known unto God
[1:04:47] fourth thestellians 5 and verse 18 in
[1:04:50] everything give thanks for this is the
[1:04:52] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[1:04:55] you in everything
[1:04:58] give thanks
[1:05:00] and the good times the bad times and
[1:05:05] when you understand when you don't
[1:05:08] understand at the beginning of 2023
[1:05:13] on January 2nd 12 noon 12 a.m January
[1:05:18] 4th January 20. in everything give
[1:05:21] thanks for this is the will of God
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:28] so we actually can walk in the will of
[1:05:31] God all the time
[1:05:32] by just being thankful just been
[1:05:36] thankful
[1:05:37] and so that's why we are here this
[1:05:39] morning
[1:05:41] I didn't want to use the word
[1:05:42] Thanksgiving service so we have things
[1:05:45] very first Sunday of the year and then
[1:05:46] the rest of the year is no thanks even
[1:05:47] no Thanksgiving is
[1:05:50] every single minute of every single day
[1:05:55] amen
[1:05:56] [Applause]
[1:05:59] all right
[1:06:04] okay
[1:06:05] okay
[1:06:06] um I have a title here which you know
[1:06:09] remember the benefit of the message a
[1:06:10] thinking man's future
[1:06:12] and a holy man stage he said he got it
[1:06:15] from the box of a cigarette and you know
[1:06:18] so he explained that to you so Mattel
[1:06:20] this morning uh I'm sitting on the Gap
[1:06:22] and again I was probably the beat to the
[1:06:24] emperor for that but but it's not my I
[1:06:27] didn't originate the the phrase I didn't
[1:06:29] I did not but I I saw it from an author
[1:06:32] and so this makes sense this makes sense
[1:06:34] and I see it all through the Bible
[1:06:36] because that's what I see in the Bible
[1:06:38] anyway so so this is my channel but the
[1:06:41] concept the Gap and again is not mine so
[1:06:43] a disclaimer so all right so
[1:06:47] um
[1:06:49] so my title is are you living in the gap
[1:06:52] or are you living in the game
[1:06:56] I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to
[1:06:58] do today because I wanted to play
[1:07:00] different with the brand I'm just out of
[1:07:01] the year just like we did last night
[1:07:04] and um and you know I have another
[1:07:07] prayer line from the prophet or
[1:07:09] something so
[1:07:10] but then two days ago I felt a lot you
[1:07:13] know I felt I felt the leading to go
[1:07:15] this direction so I
[1:07:17] I trust it'll be a person to me because
[1:07:19] I'm praying for me so I trust you you'll
[1:07:22] find some blessing in yourself also
[1:07:24] so anyway
[1:07:26] um
[1:07:28] so once again a most blessed and happy
[1:07:31] New Year uh trust and pray that it will
[1:07:33] be your very greatest year ever amen
[1:07:37] so the Gap and again
[1:07:40] is a very very follow me closely and
[1:07:43] I'll try to just talk so you because I
[1:07:46] think this is very important and is it I
[1:07:48] mean it's a topic I've been speaking on
[1:07:51] I'm well not exactly but it's related to
[1:07:54] because this principles of Life are
[1:07:56] interconnected because you're from God
[1:07:58] so but I think this is very important
[1:08:01] for you to understand what we're talking
[1:08:03] about and if you are able to it will you
[1:08:07] know cause a little shift in your
[1:08:09] thinking like I mentionology I'm using a
[1:08:11] little shift in your thinking
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:15] so is he because no matter what your
[1:08:18] brain tells you if it doesn't happen on
[1:08:20] the inside of you you are finally losing
[1:08:23] battle use you don't start a fighting
[1:08:25] chance if your soul the thinking on the
[1:08:29] inside doesn't
[1:08:30] you know I agree
[1:08:32] no matter what your brain and your flesh
[1:08:34] tells you you're not going to get so the
[1:08:37] important the big man in the house is
[1:08:40] the man on the inside and it's the one
[1:08:42] we want to get is by in in everything we
[1:08:45] hope to do and achieving life and every
[1:08:48] single area of life
[1:08:50] family home Church walks business career
[1:08:55] great corporations you got to get the
[1:08:58] buy-in of the man on the inside because
[1:09:00] God said man is only a living soul the
[1:09:05] soul on the inside is what lives out so
[1:09:08] when you go to work it's a soul that
[1:09:09] goes to walk when you go to school it is
[1:09:11] when you are angry is the soul that's
[1:09:13] angry amen a man is only a living soul
[1:09:19] so the gap on the gaining is a very
[1:09:21] simple but very powerful
[1:09:23] principle of life that's veiled and
[1:09:25] hidden in the scriptures
[1:09:28] and explains why so many people and
[1:09:32] stupid was here many times you and I
[1:09:36] many times miss our blessing and never
[1:09:39] reach the high levels of success and
[1:09:42] achievement that we desire in most every
[1:09:45] area of Our Lives even our Christian
[1:09:47] lives our natural lives because my
[1:09:50] insistence is the same principle that
[1:09:52] runs Allah because you are one person
[1:09:55] and you are interconnected so Superior
[1:09:59] Body one person it's not like you have
[1:10:02] one side for school one side for church
[1:10:03] no one side for home one time for work
[1:10:05] you are the same person and really how
[1:10:07] you do anything is really how you do
[1:10:11] everything
[1:10:12] so you have because you're one single
[1:10:13] person
[1:10:15] so not uh if you understand this concept
[1:10:18] here you'll understand and see why many
[1:10:21] many people including you and I many
[1:10:23] times miss their blessing
[1:10:26] and never reach the high levels of
[1:10:28] success and achievement that we set out
[1:10:31] to achieve in every endeavor
[1:10:33] you get married you just this is going
[1:10:35] to be the greatest marriage in the world
[1:10:37] you know it's going to be written about
[1:10:39] in the Bible
[1:10:40] when they write the Bible again
[1:10:42] they're not planning to you know
[1:10:45] but just making a point it's okay
[1:10:47] but then you know your wife does
[1:10:49] something you get angry and you start
[1:10:50] thinking what's this here
[1:10:52] Oh I thought you said he's gonna be the
[1:10:55] greatest
[1:10:57] career I'm gonna I'm gonna write my name
[1:11:00] and goal here and then things don't go
[1:11:02] away and then you'll feel like what's
[1:11:04] going on here I think I made a mistake I
[1:11:07] think you see we're going to be the pin
[1:11:10] the Stars you know I mean paint the town
[1:11:13] right or let this child's shout your
[1:11:15] name because you don't understand about
[1:11:18] the concept of the Gap and again
[1:11:21] now
[1:11:23] most people
[1:11:26] are very unhappy and that's with us
[1:11:29] because we can experience that we all
[1:11:31] experience Happiness and happiness and
[1:11:34] the problem it really is the way the
[1:11:37] measure their progress
[1:11:39] ion that's the problem that's the
[1:11:41] problem if you understand how to measure
[1:11:43] your progress
[1:11:45] you'll find
[1:11:47] sadness and unhappiness disappear
[1:11:50] so the problem is how they
[1:11:54] measure their progress that's why most
[1:11:57] people are happy and it's a simple
[1:11:59] reason because of the way they measure
[1:12:01] their progress
[1:12:02] now you know in life every even every
[1:12:06] single time in life every single action
[1:12:08] you take you are trying to go from point
[1:12:10] A to point B you're trying to go from
[1:12:12] here to there
[1:12:15] and so there is like a um something to
[1:12:18] get you from here to there I wake up in
[1:12:20] the morning I want to go to the bathroom
[1:12:21] to take my bath my bed is point a about
[1:12:24] to miss point B there's actions I have
[1:12:26] to take between 0.8 and point B and all
[1:12:29] the way down like that everything in
[1:12:31] life you can put into into it first of
[1:12:33] the year you're sleeping already
[1:12:39] it's a brother
[1:12:47] all right
[1:12:50] I didn't mention his name so I said
[1:12:54] brother
[1:12:55] all right
[1:12:56] so anyway
[1:12:58] so if you only know how to measure
[1:13:00] progress
[1:13:02] so measurement is a big deal many times
[1:13:05] victim many times and of course you know
[1:13:07] that's a Bible thing that's not a
[1:13:09] mathematics thing until they come to the
[1:13:11] measure of a stature of the fullness of
[1:13:15] Christ it's a Bible thing and the The
[1:13:17] Pretenders in the world only take their
[1:13:19] cue from the Bible even though they
[1:13:20] don't recognize God that's where they
[1:13:22] take it from well let's leave that alone
[1:13:24] I don't want to get into the measurement
[1:13:26] thing let's leave that alone
[1:13:28] so so when I get annoying my goal is to
[1:13:32] go to the bathroom
[1:13:33] and so there's a gap between
[1:13:37] where I'm starting from and where I hope
[1:13:39] to end up at so that's the Gap
[1:13:42] but when I leave let's say I live in my
[1:13:46] house I live on the on the on the
[1:13:48] seventh floor of my house and then my
[1:13:51] bathroom is on the 12th floor so I have
[1:13:55] a journey over three floors I mean five
[1:13:57] floors to get my bathroom so when I go
[1:13:59] from floor seven to nine I have gained
[1:14:02] to
[1:14:04] two steps I've reduced the gap
[1:14:06] so I have gained two flaws and I still
[1:14:09] have a gap of three floors are you
[1:14:12] following me
[1:14:13] so that's the Gap and again so sock says
[1:14:18] or failure in almost every area of Our
[1:14:21] Lives depends on how we measure this Gap
[1:14:25] and again and it's all real and hidden
[1:14:29] in the Bible and I'll try to show you I
[1:14:31] need to keep the top of my time so I
[1:14:33] don't
[1:14:34] um by the way I forgot that you know
[1:14:37] after the service like I already
[1:14:38] announced it yesterday
[1:14:40] Friday Friday that we would have like a
[1:14:44] you know Thanksgiving Fellowship but
[1:14:46] thanks means every time really you don't
[1:14:48] understand but you might finish day
[1:14:49] which not that you don't know before but
[1:14:51] your I think you can maybe explain to
[1:14:54] yourself a bit more finish day so we
[1:14:56] have a fellowship and just just some
[1:14:58] very very light refreshments and don't
[1:15:02] be angry that I thought they were going
[1:15:03] to give us a buffet I was talking about
[1:15:05] a buffet
[1:15:06] no not today not this morning not today
[1:15:09] not a buffet today maybe next time we'll
[1:15:11] do a buffet not today so just a small
[1:15:14] life refreshment but what I want I don't
[1:15:16] want you just go rush home no don't do
[1:15:18] that don't do that don't do that I'll
[1:15:20] get into that in the success of failure
[1:15:23] series that I'm getting into the child
[1:15:24] coming to the age of accountability
[1:15:26] don't do that
[1:15:28] because you will not get to the unity of
[1:15:31] the faith without the unity of the
[1:15:32] spirit even those those even those who
[1:15:34] upset you and annoy you and you can't
[1:15:37] stand them
[1:15:39] and passion of the program for you to
[1:15:41] come to a Unity of spirit
[1:15:44] energy of the spirit first before you
[1:15:47] get into your faith so so don't go don't
[1:15:49] go don't run home just turn around and
[1:15:51] especially look out for somebody you
[1:15:53] haven't seen because since we came back
[1:15:55] in March we just come and then we're
[1:15:57] rushing back to so look around and see
[1:15:59] somebody you are you having Fellowship
[1:16:00] for some time man and and chat with them
[1:16:03] for a few minutes before you
[1:16:05] head on back home
[1:16:07] she don't be disappointed if you just
[1:16:09] give you a bottle of water
[1:16:10] and say that's it so don't miss the
[1:16:12] point okay all right
[1:16:17] so
[1:16:20] what happens many times in life is that
[1:16:23] we set up with this great you know
[1:16:26] desires and what we want to achieve and
[1:16:29] what we want to get and like at the
[1:16:31] start of a new year
[1:16:33] everybody writes their New Year
[1:16:35] resolutions what they want to achieve
[1:16:36] for the year and all that
[1:16:38] and you'll find out that Target is the
[1:16:41] ideal when I get that I'm done I'm I've
[1:16:45] ticked off number one I've done it
[1:16:46] number two I've done number three I've
[1:16:48] done it
[1:16:50] but for many people many people it's a
[1:16:53] dream is a mirage knowing what a mirage
[1:16:55] is when you are going in on the on a hot
[1:16:58] sunny day and you'll see the road it's
[1:17:02] like there's water there and when you
[1:17:03] get there you find it's also moved ahead
[1:17:06] again it's like a moving moving Target
[1:17:10] and that's what life is for many people
[1:17:12] the target is just moving
[1:17:14] that is just moving and because they
[1:17:15] don't understand the concept out to want
[1:17:17] to focus on what to consider and what to
[1:17:20] not consider
[1:17:21] they just get more and more frustrated
[1:17:23] every single day in life and godliness
[1:17:28] in their private lives in their personal
[1:17:30] lives with their finances with their
[1:17:33] health with their relationships with
[1:17:35] their career with every area of life
[1:17:38] just just a moving Target and because we
[1:17:41] are measuring ourselves against that
[1:17:43] moving Target we feel so unfulfilled and
[1:17:47] because the moving Target is always Out
[1:17:49] Of Reach just like a mirage is always
[1:17:51] Out Of Reach and it just becomes like
[1:17:53] it's a dream it's not real it's those
[1:17:56] who get there is some law cause some
[1:17:59] happenstance that just happen to them
[1:18:01] but it's not
[1:18:03] but it's not
[1:18:06] so
[1:18:07] let's
[1:18:09] um
[1:18:10] before we get into getting the findings
[1:18:13] of it let me just also say that
[1:18:17] when we measure ourselves against this
[1:18:20] elusive moving Target
[1:18:23] we're leaving in the gap
[1:18:26] but when we measure ourselves against
[1:18:29] our previous cells
[1:18:32] we're leaving it again
[1:18:34] you're a Christian
[1:18:36] and you want to live for Jesus Christ if
[1:18:41] you're here today I'm not adopted yet
[1:18:43] I'm not adoption hasn't happened yet
[1:18:45] and the devil is telling you things in
[1:18:48] your mind that you are not doing you are
[1:18:51] not overcoming yet and that's your focus
[1:18:55] you're living in the gap
[1:18:58] and you'll never have success living in
[1:19:01] the gap
[1:19:01] you'll never it's not it's not uh to
[1:19:06] wish those things we know but it is a
[1:19:08] certain mindset to to to address and
[1:19:12] recognize and identify the Gap but also
[1:19:15] you want to live in the game
[1:19:18] that's how you can address the gap
[1:19:20] amen as we started this new year that's
[1:19:23] my lesson for you I mean that's my that
[1:19:25] my message to you
[1:19:31] let me get to my conclusion before I
[1:19:34] even get started
[1:19:35] I want to tell you today periodically
[1:19:38] everyone here if you're making some
[1:19:41] effort you actually are achieving more
[1:19:44] than you actually give yourself credit
[1:19:47] for
[1:19:49] the only problem why you think you are
[1:19:52] not is because you are measuring
[1:19:54] yourself against that
[1:19:56] objective the ideal that you are going
[1:19:59] for and once you don't have that yet you
[1:20:04] you feel
[1:20:05] very sad but think about your Christian
[1:20:08] Life what do you measure yourself
[1:20:09] against in your Christian Life
[1:20:11] you measure yourself things are
[1:20:13] different now something happened to me
[1:20:15] when I gave my heart to Jesus things I
[1:20:17] Loved Before have passed away things
[1:20:19] that love far more have come to stay in
[1:20:22] your Christian life you are giving
[1:20:23] yourself like I have men making progress
[1:20:26] you are not breaking your head against
[1:20:28] the world that you're not adopted yet in
[1:20:30] the Christian Life to be really
[1:20:31] successful you live in the game
[1:20:35] godliness with contentment is great game
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:40] again is a Bible word
[1:20:43] it means profitable
[1:20:45] it's Bible it's God
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:53] and in the Christian Life is your mind
[1:20:56] is not focused on gain
[1:20:59] spiritually
[1:21:01] in all your endeavors
[1:21:05] you are not going to make a success of
[1:21:06] this Christian Journey
[1:21:08] now there's something in all areas of
[1:21:10] your life
[1:21:11] amen
[1:21:13] someone challenge you as I I'm coming to
[1:21:17] all the way to the back now
[1:21:19] that periodically set back as a matter
[1:21:22] of fact I can do it every day or every
[1:21:24] week every month
[1:21:26] text talk of all that you've achieved no
[1:21:29] matter how tiny it is naturally
[1:21:32] spiritually and you will be shocked
[1:21:38] at how much you have actually achieved
[1:21:42] that's what this song says count your
[1:21:44] blessings name them one by one
[1:21:48] and it will surprise you
[1:21:50] What the Lord Has Done
[1:21:53] I say brought me why you are just trying
[1:21:55] to you're just what you call the wine I
[1:21:57] just want to remind me you know number
[1:21:58] whining I'm preaching the world I'm
[1:22:00] preaching the word of God I'm not
[1:22:01] whining you I'm preaching the Bible and
[1:22:04] I'm not doing no motivational stuff on
[1:22:06] you I'm preaching the word of God and
[1:22:08] I'll show you now this is how Jesus
[1:22:11] lived this is how Moses lived this is
[1:22:14] how Abraham lived this is how Elijah
[1:22:17] lived these are any successful person in
[1:22:20] the Bible live
[1:22:21] [Applause]
[1:22:23] thank you
[1:22:23] [Applause]
[1:22:34] so while you are here feeling unhappy
[1:22:38] with yourself unhappy with your children
[1:22:41] unhappy with your boss unhappy with
[1:22:43] everybody not the unhappy circumstances
[1:22:45] are not around you no I'm not trying to
[1:22:48] be an unrealistic person or people say
[1:22:51] I'm a realist and you live in that
[1:22:52] realist mood I mean realist no I'm a
[1:22:55] realist too but I don't live there
[1:22:59] says that thanks to Calvary I don't live
[1:23:03] here anymore I hope today you'll change
[1:23:06] where you live so you stop living in the
[1:23:09] Gap and you begin to live in the game
[1:23:11] and you'll see what the Lord has done
[1:23:15] and how transformative it is
[1:23:19] amen glory to God Amen
[1:23:24] because simply you aren't able to
[1:23:26] appreciate your progress no matter how
[1:23:28] little
[1:23:29] because you are busy measuring yourself
[1:23:33] against your target your goal or your
[1:23:39] ideal because you haven't got there yet
[1:23:41] you feel so so bad and your
[1:23:43] discontinence whatever little
[1:23:45] advancements you have made I'm going to
[1:23:48] ibadan I got stuck in traffic on the
[1:23:49] expressway and I'm all upset I'm all
[1:23:52] upset I'm going to Nature I'll get stuck
[1:23:55] I'm on the way to ore and I'm I'm
[1:23:57] feeling bad no oh thank God we meet
[1:24:00] Lagos in it's one of the traffic made it
[1:24:01] in two hours okay we'll we'll get to
[1:24:03] Nature also
[1:24:06] are you leaving in the Gap running again
[1:24:14] he's dangerous to live in the game you
[1:24:16] never achieve anything with it
[1:24:18] Israel in the wilderness they came out
[1:24:21] they came out they were baptized in The
[1:24:23] Wretched to Moses in other words they
[1:24:25] went through the Red Sea of redemption
[1:24:27] blood now you are here today you've
[1:24:29] passed through the race of redemption
[1:24:31] for those eyes lived in the Gap every
[1:24:36] single time
[1:24:38] their focus was where's the promised
[1:24:40] land I thought you said it's just that
[1:24:42] way even when the children I said what
[1:24:45] those Giants are too much for us they
[1:24:47] just live in the Gap all the time and
[1:24:49] because of that they wept
[1:24:51] they were sad they were they were
[1:24:53] bitterly
[1:24:55] like this is this is one chance
[1:24:58] this gospel is one chance
[1:25:01] we have been full and deceived into
[1:25:03] believing this year so because they
[1:25:05] lived in the Gap what they did not have
[1:25:07] yet
[1:25:10] the the perish in the wilderness don't
[1:25:12] live there it will kill your desires it
[1:25:16] will kill your dreams it will kill your
[1:25:18] hopes it will kill your aspirations it
[1:25:20] will kill your marriage it will kill
[1:25:21] your career it will kill every sin
[1:25:24] living in the gap
[1:25:27] [Applause]
[1:25:37] Eve
[1:25:38] that's where all started from
[1:25:42] she had so much going for her and she
[1:25:46] only had one thing that was not there
[1:25:48] yet just a little Gap just a little Gap
[1:25:52] just a little Gap
[1:25:55] and Lucifer understands because the
[1:25:58] serpent brother Venom taught us the the
[1:26:01] the the the Lucifer could use a serpent
[1:26:03] because someone under understood the
[1:26:06] issues of Life issues that were again
[1:26:09] issues issues
[1:26:11] and I'll show you how they get formed
[1:26:13] not today some brother is still sleeping
[1:26:16] another brother another one
[1:26:21] the bus wasn't too much
[1:26:23] in soccer
[1:26:27] watching Ronaldo and his move and all
[1:26:29] that
[1:26:30] [Music]
[1:26:31] all right
[1:26:35] boy gentlemen I'm so sorry thank you
[1:26:39] all right so about the missions if you
[1:26:41] want to go to her she's gonna you can
[1:26:43] that's fine
[1:26:44] all right so
[1:26:47] so Eve Lucifer the serpenter is Shifting
[1:26:52] and focused from the gain all that she
[1:26:54] had going for her
[1:26:56] to the one single thing she did not have
[1:26:59] going for her one single thing that was
[1:27:01] missing and she lived in that and dwelt
[1:27:04] in that and like they say the rest is
[1:27:07] history
[1:27:08] living in the Gap and living in the game
[1:27:11] count your blessings as
[1:27:13] that's my inspiration count your
[1:27:16] blessings name them one by one one by
[1:27:19] one don't just put them together no be
[1:27:21] very specific count them one by one even
[1:27:24] if all you have is God he woke me up
[1:27:26] this morning seventh on the morning he
[1:27:28] didn't have to do it but he did I am
[1:27:31] thankful Lord I can raise my hands I can
[1:27:34] get off of my bed I'm thankful to you
[1:27:36] Lord isn't that enough to thank God for
[1:27:38] even if that's all you have to thank God
[1:27:41] for
[1:27:43] because many went to bed last night they
[1:27:46] couldn't wake up this morning or they
[1:27:48] couldn't get up this morning so there's
[1:27:50] a lot to thank her for they'll say oh
[1:27:52] that that is normal no it's not normal
[1:27:55] no don't don't have an entitlement thing
[1:27:57] God don't owe you to wake you up the
[1:28:00] next morning
[1:28:02] Hallelujah he woke me up this morning
[1:28:05] seventh Sunday morning he didn't have to
[1:28:07] do it but thank God he did say thank God
[1:28:11] he did
[1:28:13] amen you maybe see that
[1:28:15] [Applause]
[1:28:26] so you can know you can see right away
[1:28:27] from Eve and all the other examples if
[1:28:30] he has a major example as a major case
[1:28:32] study how dangerous how destructive
[1:28:36] how powerfully negatively destructive it
[1:28:38] is to live in The Gap the gap
[1:28:42] my wife didn't do this
[1:28:46] this is what your wife all the other
[1:28:48] things about her
[1:28:50] leaving the game about that but I thank
[1:28:52] you Lord I have a wife
[1:28:54] I thank you Lord that
[1:28:57] I think I think the problem is a lot of
[1:29:00] these brothers are spoiled Frankly
[1:29:01] Speaking so they don't even appreciate
[1:29:02] the basic thing because they grew up
[1:29:04] knowing how I I don't I can't cook I
[1:29:06] can't I can't cook anything I'm not
[1:29:07] proud of it so absolutely for everything
[1:29:09] if a grain of rice I can I don't even
[1:29:12] know how I
[1:29:13] anyway
[1:29:17] no I'm not I'm not saying I mean I I'm
[1:29:20] I'm great I'm not saying that at all I'm
[1:29:21] not saying that I'm just seeing like
[1:29:22] that so many little little blessings
[1:29:25] like the song for me and Johnson used to
[1:29:27] sing for the many many blessings that's
[1:29:29] the song Right many many many many
[1:29:31] blessings I feel my life is divorce of a
[1:29:34] blessed who told you that
[1:29:36] who told you that
[1:29:38] we told you that
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:41] the devil telling you that to drag you
[1:29:44] out of that zone into the Gap and when
[1:29:48] you get in the Gap it sinks a hole you
[1:29:50] can go in there amen now I'm not trying
[1:29:53] to put you happy I mean if you want to
[1:29:54] sink in your hole that's fine but I'm
[1:29:57] preaching the word of God too like I
[1:29:58] always say to the two three percent who
[1:30:01] believe what I'm telling them
[1:30:03] amen
[1:30:06] amen
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:09] so leaving in the gap
[1:30:11] and living in the game let's see the
[1:30:13] life of Jesus as we quickly run through
[1:30:16] now this story we read you know Jesus
[1:30:18] had this this
[1:30:21] campaign the people came and then he
[1:30:25] preached to them and healed them and all
[1:30:27] that and when he was close to even time
[1:30:30] he was like too late for the people to
[1:30:32] go away and find some food and go to
[1:30:34] their homes so there was a problem a
[1:30:37] dilemma here you can see it was a big
[1:30:39] deal about that they just saying the
[1:30:40] Wilderness well it's like you going to
[1:30:42] uh
[1:30:43] um
[1:30:46] let me know say something that looks
[1:30:48] like I'm I'm joking I want to say like
[1:30:50] you go to uh you get to talk between
[1:30:55] um
[1:30:57] already I've been in at 2 am
[1:31:00] and um
[1:31:02] you know you have to walk all the way
[1:31:05] or you stay in some secluded place and
[1:31:07] on the way where you are protected and
[1:31:10] somebody says like I said I will let
[1:31:11] them go and find food to let them just
[1:31:12] walk you know just walk around so that's
[1:31:14] what this app was did
[1:31:16] so there's a problem here that was a
[1:31:18] problem here
[1:31:21] so this happens like most of us were
[1:31:23] simply living in the gap
[1:31:27] they only saw they need they only saw
[1:31:30] the problem they only saw the challenge
[1:31:32] they only saw the difficulty
[1:31:34] they did not see a single problem I mean
[1:31:38] a single solution inside none of not
[1:31:40] like not one faint hop inside
[1:31:44] no one felt hot inside
[1:31:48] disciples did that
[1:31:50] just like Isaac did
[1:31:52] father Where is the
[1:31:56] lamb for the sacrifice
[1:31:58] he was living in the Gap Abraham was in
[1:32:01] the game because he had the experience
[1:32:02] because that's how you came Isaac he
[1:32:04] said God will provide for himself
[1:32:07] a sacrifice even before it happened all
[1:32:12] that you don't have to have God speaking
[1:32:14] to you the Bible tells me so
[1:32:18] thank you
[1:32:22] [Applause]
[1:32:26] so the shop was only saw the problem the
[1:32:29] need
[1:32:31] the gap
[1:32:33] there was no solution in sight
[1:32:36] and this really was a very very pretty
[1:32:40] tougher and challenging insulation to be
[1:32:41] in
[1:32:43] from their perspective and really it was
[1:32:45] having five thousand men and women
[1:32:48] besides children and partner men besides
[1:32:51] women and children could have been six
[1:32:53] thousand seven thousand eight thousand
[1:32:55] nine thousand in that place
[1:32:57] and the people who are hungry
[1:33:01] and they need to be given food they knew
[1:33:03] that they still need to find something
[1:33:04] to eat
[1:33:08] so
[1:33:10] they focused on the gap
[1:33:13] on the need on The Challenge on the
[1:33:15] difficulty
[1:33:17] on how things are not working well
[1:33:19] that's why people make all these New
[1:33:21] Year resolutions and they don't it
[1:33:23] doesn't last one week because the focus
[1:33:25] is just no longer they haven't been
[1:33:27] taught what not to focus not what not to
[1:33:30] consider like Abraham you considered not
[1:33:33] it's not what to consider
[1:33:36] what not to consider is as important
[1:33:39] even much more so than
[1:33:43] what you consider
[1:33:45] because all he said was Abram considered
[1:33:48] not he didn't even tell us what he
[1:33:49] considered
[1:33:50] until later
[1:33:56] so when you're focused on the gap on the
[1:33:59] problem on the difficulty you will see
[1:34:03] only
[1:34:05] problems and was not working
[1:34:07] you know that from Eve shift her focused
[1:34:10] that's how powerful the negative focus
[1:34:12] on the Gap is shifter Focus from all
[1:34:16] that she had going for her to the one
[1:34:18] single thing God kept away from her
[1:34:21] and that was also for our own good
[1:34:23] but when you are in the Gap you listen
[1:34:25] to a different narrative
[1:34:30] that's not going to serve your purpose
[1:34:33] so when you end the Gap you'll see no
[1:34:35] Solutions
[1:34:36] even if the solution is hiding in plain
[1:34:39] sight
[1:34:40] and in plain sight like in the
[1:34:42] acceleration the solution was there Hard
[1:34:44] In Plain Sight they just need to look a
[1:34:46] little bit
[1:34:49] once it doesn't you just jump into the
[1:34:51] gap
[1:34:52] and then you say God doesn't do God
[1:34:54] doesn't do and you Endeavor is telling
[1:34:56] your heart of hearts this gospel we're
[1:34:58] just going through it it doesn't really
[1:35:00] work
[1:35:02] it works every time
[1:35:04] what's every single time
[1:35:07] [Applause]
[1:35:09] but when you leaving the gap
[1:35:14] and even when the solution presents
[1:35:16] itself
[1:35:20] because you are in that Gap thinking
[1:35:22] that's what your mind is all about
[1:35:24] that's your thinking pattern just Gap
[1:35:27] thinking even when the solution shows up
[1:35:30] you reduce the solution to
[1:35:33] insignificance
[1:35:35] insignificance
[1:35:36] [Applause]
[1:35:38] imagine if Jesus was in there
[1:35:40] that I said what what uses these five
[1:35:43] laws and two fishes what uses it uses it
[1:35:47] and the grace of almighty God provided
[1:35:50] those Five Loaves and two fishes and
[1:35:52] human beings living in a narrow war in a
[1:35:56] small world
[1:35:59] just reduce God to that and say nothing
[1:36:01] imagine if Jesus was in there but thank
[1:36:04] God the grace of almighty God
[1:36:07] hey Glory
[1:36:09] I'm just seeing you it's the glory god
[1:36:11] bless you God bless you glory bless you
[1:36:15] bless you get to see you bless you
[1:36:24] imagine if Jesus wasn't
[1:36:26] there so be sure that Jesus is with you
[1:36:29] all the time or you throw away many many
[1:36:34] blessings many many opportunities
[1:36:37] because you are so fixated living in the
[1:36:41] gap
[1:36:43] living in a wall of luck in a world of
[1:36:46] warmth in a wall of nothing works here
[1:36:55] oh yeah that's your scripture that it
[1:36:57] doesn't really work in the real world
[1:36:58] well I wish you all the best
[1:37:01] I wish you all the best of course I'm
[1:37:03] not preaching I'm not talking I'm not
[1:37:04] talking to you
[1:37:06] I'm talking to those who know like that
[1:37:07] God this war itself was created
[1:37:11] by the word of God
[1:37:14] the word of God hung
[1:37:16] the universe in space
[1:37:19] so how about your own turning you are
[1:37:22] too inconsequential Amen brother you are
[1:37:26] too small
[1:37:29] God's word it works every time
[1:37:33] everywhere under any condition it always
[1:37:37] works
[1:37:39] always works you may be seated
[1:37:42] Oh Glory are you falling out story amen
[1:37:47] [Applause]
[1:37:52] because we're living in the Gap even
[1:37:55] when
[1:37:56] Solutions came to them that they could
[1:37:59] just give to God and give thanks it was
[1:38:03] too small God wasn't doing what he
[1:38:06] promised he will do he wasn't meeting
[1:38:07] the expectations
[1:38:09] they make themselves God and they want
[1:38:11] this God in their image who will do the
[1:38:14] things just the way they want him to do
[1:38:16] it
[1:38:18] and once he doesn't do it that way their
[1:38:20] Spirits sink and you see people who
[1:38:22] stood out
[1:38:24] higher and when they get to a certain
[1:38:26] age they feel like yeah I'm older now so
[1:38:28] I understand all those things about me
[1:38:29] one the use of attending those people
[1:38:31] they are just for small children when
[1:38:33] those kids no they have said in here in
[1:38:34] this church before some are saying it
[1:38:35] now I mean I know I know I I hear what
[1:38:38] goes on
[1:38:40] hearing good years
[1:38:42] what is
[1:38:43] oh yeah when this event grew up they
[1:38:45] were funny like that the real world is
[1:38:47] different all right
[1:38:50] go on living in the Gap I'm teaching my
[1:38:53] people
[1:38:54] how to snatch success from the jaws of
[1:38:57] failure
[1:38:59] amen welcome to 2023.
[1:39:03] amen welcome welcome you are gonna find
[1:39:08] out
[1:39:08] [Applause]
[1:39:10] as we go on you are going to find out
[1:39:12] your lives will be transformed like you
[1:39:15] never knew before like you never thought
[1:39:17] was possible amen glory
[1:39:21] foreign
[1:39:26] you don't see a solution
[1:39:34] Jesus asked him
[1:39:37] what should I leave you to eat
[1:39:38] you may be seated
[1:39:40] he asked them feel it
[1:39:43] he's probably was a financial
[1:39:46] problem so we don't have the money we
[1:39:49] don't have enough money
[1:39:52] how many times you and I do that
[1:39:55] how many times you do that
[1:39:57] we don't have the money
[1:39:59] [Applause]
[1:40:02] don't laugh
[1:40:04] don't laugh
[1:40:09] so no no no no no we can't do this no
[1:40:11] money we don't have the money
[1:40:13] you think you are new no see that
[1:40:16] but the man who kept preaches all these
[1:40:18] things here like that and when you ask
[1:40:19] him to help you some money he said he
[1:40:21] doesn't have the money
[1:40:23] how does he experience to carry out what
[1:40:24] we what do you say we should do
[1:40:27] Jesus told them to go and look for food
[1:40:30] but you not give them the money
[1:40:41] because my God shall supply all your
[1:40:44] need
[1:40:45] according to his riches
[1:40:47] in Christ Jesus
[1:40:50] Hallelujah
[1:40:58] thank you
[1:40:59] let me see that
[1:41:00] [Applause]
[1:41:07] [Music]
[1:41:09] no I think I'm I'm not taking too long
[1:41:12] okay but I'm taking too long
[1:41:15] but this is my New Year message to you
[1:41:18] a Thanksgiving message

[1:41:22] thanks
[1:41:24] amen Glory
[1:41:26] you may be seated
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:30] so Philip's problem was we have no money
[1:41:35] 200 penny worth that's like saying like
[1:41:37] twenty thousand dollars or twenty
[1:41:39] thousand dollars even if you have that
[1:41:40] here where is the place to buy the food
[1:41:42] whole country is closed the chicken
[1:41:45] Republic they're closed is late unless
[1:41:46] you go to lekki where they had them 24
[1:41:48] hours and even that by the time we buy
[1:41:49] food for 100 people they're done for the
[1:41:52] night well I mean just doesn't make
[1:41:54] sense
[1:41:55] this Jesus just say something really
[1:42:02] let's be real between you and I just
[1:42:05] some really stupid things sometimes you
[1:42:06] know just between you and I say some
[1:42:08] really stupid things just doesn't make
[1:42:10] sense it doesn't make sense at all
[1:42:13] thank you
[1:42:16] how many of you have missed your day of
[1:42:18] visitation miss your opportunities
[1:42:21] because you say
[1:42:24] if only I had enough money
[1:42:29] I don't have the money so it's not if
[1:42:31] Jesus wasn't there insisting that go and
[1:42:34] look for it they would have given up we
[1:42:35] don't have the money and that was having
[1:42:37] it and they would have missed this great
[1:42:39] event
[1:42:40] how many good events have you missed in
[1:42:42] your life because you say I don't have
[1:42:43] money and you just resign in you just
[1:42:46] you just you just you just uh um Retreat
[1:42:50] into a place of a a place of defeat
[1:42:54] because you don't have money
[1:42:56] foreign
[1:43:00] he doesn't let you do that
[1:43:04] [Music]
[1:43:09] so before we
[1:43:12] condemn Phillip
[1:43:14] many times you do that
[1:43:17] all right
[1:43:19] Andrew
[1:43:21] Andrew
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:27] at least they tried the other ones did
[1:43:30] not even
[1:43:31] company
[1:43:33] since you you can even understand what
[1:43:36] he's saying
[1:43:37] you you go and talk to him it just it
[1:43:39] just doesn't make sense I mean but if I
[1:43:42] go to tell him Michelle that you are
[1:43:43] always you tell me that you're always
[1:43:44] you're only challenging Authority so I
[1:43:47] don't I mean I I don't want to get on
[1:43:49] his case just you since he thinks well
[1:43:51] of you you won't tell him
[1:43:55] of course you know that happens you know
[1:43:56] you know what I'm telling the truth you
[1:43:58] know it
[1:44:04] [Music]
[1:44:06] Andrew
[1:44:09] he saw Five Loaves and is there a little
[1:44:12] lad here
[1:44:13] little light just small boy I mean in
[1:44:15] other words food that will fill a child
[1:44:19] is what we're talking about if he was a
[1:44:21] giant man we can even be talking about
[1:44:22] real real
[1:44:25] sizable food but this a child's food
[1:44:28] like like you just have a baby's feeding
[1:44:30] bottle and you're talking about food for
[1:44:31] all these people here
[1:44:34] when you live in the Gap you belittle
[1:44:37] the things of God and that's what many
[1:44:39] people do
[1:44:40] I'm not being funny even people who come
[1:44:44] and say like that oh the church that
[1:44:46] church there just belittle the things of
[1:44:48] God
[1:44:50] because their hearts are
[1:44:52] in the gap
[1:44:54] and away when they got the devil fills
[1:44:56] it up he fill it up for Eve
[1:45:00] filled up for Eve
[1:45:01] well that's another story let me know
[1:45:03] let me go there
[1:45:07] so Philip
[1:45:09] I mean Andrew he despised the day of
[1:45:12] small things
[1:45:14] Zechariah zikaraja before I don't think
[1:45:18] I read I I I think I I gave you my
[1:45:21] contact scriptures the great chapter 4
[1:45:24] is talking about this zeruba Bell and
[1:45:26] all that bodies said who had despised
[1:45:28] the day of small things
[1:45:30] despite the day of small things how
[1:45:33] would you know that you and I here said
[1:45:35] that as a little seed
[1:45:38] little sick little button
[1:45:41] of small things
[1:45:45] and because of that you miss your
[1:45:46] visitation many times many times
[1:45:52] Andrew dispersity of small things
[1:45:55] why because of a mindset that fixated on
[1:45:59] the gap on the difficulty on the
[1:46:03] impossibility on how it can be done
[1:46:08] and that mindset can do nothing but
[1:46:11] belittle every small but possible
[1:46:14] solution
[1:46:17] that tells you in the uh in the um
[1:46:21] in the criminal wall like you don't you
[1:46:24] follow the leads you don't you don't you
[1:46:26] don't disconnect any lead it may be a
[1:46:29] small drop of blood that's where you
[1:46:31] don't have to be a large pool of blood
[1:46:32] they know that you don't disconnect any
[1:46:35] small thing don't despise that day of
[1:46:37] small things
[1:46:46] and because of that
[1:46:48] will suppose went into
[1:46:52] they were not ready for anything to
[1:46:54] disturb their comfort
[1:46:57] they went into a a wall of send them
[1:47:00] away so each man can go friend for
[1:47:02] himself one must we feed them why must
[1:47:06] we feed them is the church the place to
[1:47:08] feed people from is this place the place
[1:47:10] went from must they come to this place
[1:47:12] to our house whatever it is office
[1:47:14] whatever whatever
[1:47:17] all right
[1:47:19] and right away if they were dealing with
[1:47:21] Jesus
[1:47:23] how is that for telling me away at two
[1:47:27] o'clock in the morning in the morning
[1:47:28] let him walk to Benin from already
[1:47:29] themselves and find them on the way what
[1:47:32] happened to them it didn't matter
[1:47:41] [Applause]
[1:47:43] your senses your connection to God gets
[1:47:46] dulled
[1:47:48] you are not sensitive anymore
[1:47:51] you are only responsive to the
[1:47:53] environment in which you live that
[1:47:57] environment where is tough nothing is
[1:47:59] going on buhari and all of that crazy
[1:48:02] stuff
[1:48:03] is my wife if only my wife will behave
[1:48:05] yourself if only my children will be
[1:48:07] there this is my husband will be if only
[1:48:08] the pastor if only the beginning they
[1:48:10] got on my case and all that just live in
[1:48:12] that world
[1:48:14] [Applause]
[1:48:15] send them away friends how is that for
[1:48:18] Let each one of you bear one another's
[1:48:21] burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ
[1:48:25] amen
[1:48:28] wow
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:31] so here the disciples had you know
[1:48:34] exhausted Lord we've tried send them
[1:48:37] away
[1:48:38] the Bible said Jesus knew a solution was
[1:48:41] there because he said the Bible said he
[1:48:44] knew himself what he was going to do so
[1:48:47] the solution is there wherever you are
[1:48:50] whatever so
[1:48:52] um let me announce you the solution is
[1:48:54] there
[1:48:55] is hiding but is hiding in plain sight
[1:49:00] amen can you say Amen
[1:49:05] [Applause]
[1:49:10] bless you Joanna and see let's see Jesus
[1:49:13] he came they're talking about disruption
[1:49:15] he discovered everything that could be
[1:49:17] disrupted there's nothing there's
[1:49:19] nothing new Under the Sun this is from
[1:49:21] the Bible Jesus Disturbed their theology
[1:49:24] so but every they served there or
[1:49:26] destroyed their mathematics destroyed
[1:49:28] their financial destroyed everything why
[1:49:30] didn't he destroy neither morning he had
[1:49:33] a bank in the sea

[1:50:06] daydreaming
[1:50:09] it disrupted the food industry with this
[1:50:12] year it destroyed the medical industry
[1:50:14] where they just pick a one and people
[1:50:16] get here people raised from the dead it
[1:50:18] was a disruptor it was a disruptive
[1:50:21] influence

[1:50:36] filled me yet
[1:50:39] Jesus Christ has never failed me yet

[1:51:43] focused on the gain is your focused
[1:51:45] your focus is very important I mean I
[1:51:47] don't want to get into all that focus is
[1:51:48] very focus is very powerful
[1:51:50] as a matter of that's what guys in
[1:51:52] Direction life Focus Jesus said if you I
[1:51:55] be single it's only my focus
[1:52:00] Focus was shifted a little bit a little
[1:52:04] bit

[1:52:22] today
[1:52:23] shift your thinking amen has been
[1:52:26] talking about all these past few months
[1:52:30] so Jesus he was all the time focused on
[1:52:32] the game
[1:52:35] he was focused on gratitude
[1:52:37] he was focused on Thanksgiving he was
[1:52:39] focused on magnifying the Lord with me
[1:52:42] and let's exalt his name together it was
[1:52:44] focused on magnifying amplifying the
[1:52:47] little things God has done
[1:52:49] amen
[1:52:53] the disciples almost you know rebuked
[1:52:56] him for living like that
[1:52:59] for the mining solution that didn't seem
[1:53:02] to exist anywhere
[1:53:04] but Jesus was focused on again and
[1:53:07] looked for
[1:53:08] a solution
[1:53:10] because he knew it was there
[1:53:14] every speech every action that Jesus
[1:53:18] made was directed toward finding a
[1:53:21] solution
[1:53:22] here they're not looking for a solution
[1:53:24] to cause more trouble
[1:53:26] just not looking for solution at all
[1:53:28] when you do that you are missing your
[1:53:31] purpose in life we were sent here to
[1:53:34] provide Solutions Adam was sent here not
[1:53:38] to walk
[1:53:39] it was the work was providing a solution
[1:53:42] because the problem was there was no man
[1:53:45] to kill the ground
[1:53:48] So Adam was sent here and he provided
[1:53:51] the solution that God was looking for
[1:53:54] and we are paid in this life
[1:53:57] in direct proportion
[1:54:00] to the solutions that we saw for people
[1:54:03] and the quality of ways we solve the
[1:54:06] pollution for them we solve the problem
[1:54:08] for them
[1:54:09] that's what work is if your work is not
[1:54:11] solving the pollution not not solving a
[1:54:14] problem you are just going through the
[1:54:16] motions
[1:54:21] laughs
[1:54:23] I don't want to get into all that so let
[1:54:25] me just leave that alone but I think the
[1:54:27] point is made
[1:54:28] so anyway
[1:54:30] so Jesus was certainly gained
[1:54:34] while these guys who are focused
[1:54:37] on the
[1:54:39] Gap
[1:54:40] without a solution in mind Jesus knew
[1:54:44] in the game he'll find the solution for
[1:54:47] what's left of the gap thank you
[1:54:51] so while you are focused on the problem
[1:54:54] looking for no solution Jesus looked for
[1:54:57] lived in the game and he looked for
[1:55:00] search for and highlighted the solution
[1:55:03] no matter how little he Amplified it
[1:55:07] perhaps the Lord will work for us today
[1:55:11] amen
[1:55:14] the disciples on the other hand they
[1:55:16] allow the circumstance to shape and
[1:55:18] dictate and control their narrative and
[1:55:21] their worldview
[1:55:23] which was always to see the problem
[1:55:26] intractable unsolvable
[1:55:30] and never see the solution
[1:55:33] because they were living in the gap
[1:55:36] amen
[1:55:41] Jesus
[1:55:44] I keep saying lived in the game that's
[1:55:46] our model another example
[1:55:48] and I'm saying are you living in the gap
[1:55:50] or in the game
[1:55:51] that face everything in your life every
[1:55:53] single the natural spiritual in church
[1:55:55] name it
[1:55:56] oh that church all they're doing that
[1:55:58] you'll never find a perfect Church you
[1:56:00] never if you're on that search I wish
[1:56:01] you all the best
[1:56:03] is it sick don't need a physician not
[1:56:06] the healthy Jesus said
[1:56:07] so this year is a is a sick day
[1:56:13] we come to be healed every single time
[1:56:15] all of us
[1:56:16] all of us
[1:56:21] you show an example of a Christian that
[1:56:24] was in Gossip
[1:56:28] you show an example of what they're not
[1:56:31] doing
[1:56:32] that you think they should do you should
[1:56:34] be that example
[1:56:36] you be the king like they say the change
[1:56:37] that you're looking for
[1:56:39] amen yes you can amen
[1:56:42] [Applause]
[1:56:46] so Jesus living again and I was always
[1:56:50] looked for and on
[1:56:52] and always look for and saw the solution
[1:56:56] to the problem no matter how little no
[1:56:58] matter how little
[1:57:00] no matter how little
[1:57:02] oh I want to start out that I want to
[1:57:04] start that that career or whatever and
[1:57:07] I don't have money and then you should
[1:57:09] you sit back I don't want to get that so
[1:57:11] you're something I'm just talking about
[1:57:12] those those natural things so talking
[1:57:14] about everything everything
[1:57:16] or like your wife like my wife just
[1:57:18] always this is
[1:57:20] yeah that's the Gap are you living there
[1:57:24] or is there something about this wife
[1:57:27] that you can thank God for
[1:57:28] is that something about this wife that
[1:57:30] is even worthy of
[1:57:32] the gratitude
[1:57:35] to God
[1:57:39] oh you're brought us on the job
[1:57:42] he makes your life rough I know I know I
[1:57:44] know
[1:57:45] I know I know it
[1:57:47] but there's so many about him that you
[1:57:49] can just live in the game Somebody by
[1:57:52] him and somebody about that office that
[1:57:54] job that you're in while you are still
[1:57:55] there
[1:57:56] the principle of life if you want
[1:57:58] achievement in your life you gotta you
[1:58:00] got to find the secret how to live in
[1:58:03] the game anoint the god
[1:58:05] amen
[1:58:10] wow
[1:58:12] you have some chance today
[1:58:13] [Applause]
[1:58:18] all right
[1:58:22] so Jesus
[1:58:24] because he lived in the game he
[1:58:27] recognized the Gap is still there God
[1:58:29] told Joshua Joshua you are getting all
[1:58:31] and there's still so much land to be
[1:58:33] conquered so we're not living like in
[1:58:36] denial here no
[1:58:42] and what do we do about this problem
[1:58:46] so I'm only being realistic you don't
[1:58:48] know what I'm going you don't know you
[1:58:50] have no idea no all these things you are
[1:58:52] saying I've tried it before it doesn't
[1:58:53] work all right
[1:58:54] I don't even I wouldn't get scared when
[1:58:56] I had to talk like that when people feel
[1:58:58] like that and people feel that way
[1:59:04] so Jesus didn't he recognize the problem
[1:59:07] but did not leave in the gap
[1:59:09] the circumstances to the difficulties he
[1:59:13] didn't let them shape his
[1:59:15] perspective on worldview the narrative
[1:59:18] he spoke to him because you're talking
[1:59:19] to yourself all the time
[1:59:21] a lot of self-talk we talked to
[1:59:22] ourselves about 10 times more than other
[1:59:24] people talk to us on a daily basis I
[1:59:26] can't remember the figures now
[1:59:28] talk to yourself constantly so many
[1:59:30] thoughts that come into you you explain
[1:59:32] to yourself and most of it is negative
[1:59:34] because many human beings are just
[1:59:36] perfected out of living in the Gap and
[1:59:37] they give them their reasons why they
[1:59:38] must live there
[1:59:40] and then they do not achieve they feel
[1:59:41] frustrated they're angry and all that
[1:59:42] and they feel like that what's going on
[1:59:43] here because that's what you chose to do
[1:59:45] because you are a product of your
[1:59:47] thoughts your thinking
[1:59:49] [Music]
[1:59:50] see that's it that's what you choose to
[1:59:52] do God gave you that control totally
[1:59:54] totally yeah
[2:00:00] but Jesus know the seed of living in the
[2:00:03] game and when you live in the game you
[2:00:06] begin to see I'm making when you have
[2:00:08] gained the same look that are that that
[2:00:11] I one of my current scriptures said what
[2:00:14] is the man advantaged if he gain the
[2:00:17] whole world
[2:00:18] gain is all about advantage
[2:00:20] [Music]
[2:00:22] when I have the advantage over you I
[2:00:24] have the gain over you that's what
[2:00:27] happened in Eden
[2:00:34] when you live in the game you see
[2:00:36] advantage
[2:00:39] gain his advantage
[2:00:42] Jesus was just saying that advantage
[2:00:44] that man has
[2:00:45] he's not going to fetch him anything
[2:00:46] because he just had to his soul
[2:00:50] but gain his Advantage so when you leave
[2:00:53] in the game you are living a life of
[2:00:55] advantage
[2:01:01] and you have seen he's done so much for
[2:01:04] me I cannot tell it all and then you
[2:01:07] start naming them one by one count your
[2:01:09] blessings one by one
[2:01:11] my but what we do we believe to that we
[2:01:14] believe two things as as waking up in
[2:01:17] the morning
[2:01:18] that's nothing that's that's nothing big
[2:01:20] deal I come to church I go to work and I
[2:01:23] go there
[2:01:25] strong heal no acting on the way as if
[2:01:28] those who left their house I'm gonna hit
[2:01:30] by a car in front of the house they are
[2:01:32] sourcing us than you
[2:01:34] and we just don't we are so starchy in
[2:01:38] our ways that until we get some money in
[2:01:42] the pocket before we can thank God
[2:01:44] you
[2:01:46] will likely not get there
[2:01:48] and if you get there God's grace but you
[2:01:52] will likely not progress so much more if
[2:01:54] you don't understand this principle of
[2:01:55] living and again and living in the gap
[2:01:59] three percent might struggle their way
[2:02:00] through because they have so much will
[2:02:01] power from majority of you
[2:02:04] and I will not be able to even manage it
[2:02:08] so so living in the game
[2:02:12] gives you Advantage what's the advantage
[2:02:14] you see what God has done what the Lord
[2:02:17] has done for me I cannot tell it all
[2:02:21] I can't tell it all on a daily bit I
[2:02:23] cannot tell it all
[2:02:25] I can stand on my feet I thank you so
[2:02:28] much as that what is that well that's
[2:02:30] nothing for you is everything to me
[2:02:32] [Applause]
[2:02:34] that can raise my hands I can talk
[2:02:38] oh Hallelujah
[2:02:39] [Applause]
[2:02:44] living in the game unless you see the
[2:02:47] value of the advantage of being thankful
[2:02:52] living in gratitude living in
[2:02:54] Thanksgiving
[2:02:56] when you leave and again you will be
[2:02:58] thankful because it's so much that he
[2:03:01] has done for you oh Hallelujah
[2:03:06] when you live in the game gratitude and
[2:03:08] the giving of thanks will be a part and
[2:03:11] parcel of your daily living your daily
[2:03:14] existence your prayer life becomes
[2:03:16] transformed you don't just say Lord Lord
[2:03:19] please uh bless me please no you are
[2:03:21] saying Lord I Thank you that I can wake
[2:03:23] up I can raise my hands
[2:03:26] I I even have a job I think it's a
[2:03:28] stupid job I don't I don't appreciate
[2:03:30] but I still have a job look I have my
[2:03:32] family I have my dad my mom not I can
[2:03:35] breathe
[2:03:37] before you get to the other specifics
[2:03:39] that he has done for you rather than
[2:03:42] rather than marriage god with what he
[2:03:44] hasn't done for you
[2:03:45] oh Hallelujah
[2:03:48] Hallelujah living and again living in
[2:03:51] gratitude thanking God gratitude
[2:03:54] thanking and praising him in everything
[2:03:57] giving him thanks in the good times the
[2:03:59] bad times thanking him living in the
[2:04:01] game
[2:04:03] oh
[2:04:04] Hallelujah Glory
[2:04:14] and so Jesus living in the game
[2:04:17] he gave thanks he knew what was going to
[2:04:18] happen when you're living again you know
[2:04:20] it's going to happen
[2:04:22] Jesus said they said we found
[2:04:25] Five Laws and two fishes and two fishes
[2:04:28] just bring it to me and say firstly set
[2:04:30] them down and sell them in companies
[2:04:32] because it's beginning to rain so tell
[2:04:34] them in companies they are going to have
[2:04:36] food now sell them in companies let them
[2:04:38] sit down and they did that set them in
[2:04:41] 50s by companies you have a company
[2:04:45] not my words the Bible you have a
[2:04:46] company set it in order it's beginning
[2:04:48] to rain it's going to rain
[2:04:52] the economy might be your home it's
[2:04:53] going to rain
[2:04:58] you may be seated
[2:04:59] [Applause]
[2:05:01] and so Jesus he gave thanks
[2:05:05] for the Small Things even a little boy's
[2:05:08] meal that some despised
[2:05:11] don't let anyone Define you by what they
[2:05:15] think maybe see that
[2:05:17] [Applause]
[2:05:20] some feel sorry for you is thanking God
[2:05:23] for that you know that he doesn't he
[2:05:25] doesn't understand the big life yet that
[2:05:28] you I thank God for every small thing
[2:05:32] I thank him for hiding me in the night

[2:05:39] to of course you don't know what brought
[2:05:42] you back out of there those who went to

[2:05:46] Sinners than you

[2:06:27] here
[2:06:30] amen oh my let me try and find my way to
[2:06:33] begin to wind down here
[2:06:36] Jesus unlike disciples they give what
[2:06:39] they despise he he took it and gave
[2:06:41] thanks for this even the small simile
[2:06:45] insignificant blessing
[2:06:47] [Applause]

[2:06:51] one by one

[2:07:06] many just belittle the solution that God

[2:10:45] in the given of fangs
[2:10:48] and as he gave thanks the miracle that
[2:10:51] was hidden in those five notes began to
[2:10:54] force their way out
[2:10:55] [Applause]
[2:10:57] the given of thanks was the conduit was
[2:11:01] the pipeline that the miracle needed to
[2:11:04] cut his way out

[2:18:36] that will overtake you you'll be amazed
[2:18:39] Jesus showed us here they not only ate
[2:18:43] they had leftovers they didn't just eat
[2:18:47] like like you know we'll give you just a
[2:18:50] little live refreshment today or even
[2:18:51] just a bottle of water no they act like
[2:18:54] they come and just like this young
[2:18:55] people just come back and say I want
[2:18:57] some more I want some more I want some
[2:18:59] more I want some more I want someone
[2:19:01] until they are staggering and they are
[2:19:03] daddy amongst it my friend you are
[2:19:04] Glutton come on everybody to live for a
[2:19:08] fool
[2:19:10] and then they had 12 baskets left over
[2:19:13] what does that speaking about speaking
[2:19:15] of abundance
[2:19:16] is a god of abundance
[2:19:19] we limit him
[2:19:22] we limit him
[2:19:24] we get in our situations and leaving the
[2:19:27] Gap and we are sure like that that's the
[2:19:29] way to go but well if this is not
[2:19:31] speaking to you
[2:19:33] I'm not speaking to you either
[2:19:39] because from the inconsequential Five
[2:19:41] Loaves and two fishes
[2:19:44] Jesus he told them he wanted to let them
[2:19:47] know he said Gather because he was just
[2:19:51] he wanted him to see how abundant it was
[2:19:55] a gather together gather together
[2:19:59] who took them
[2:20:01] but I not so many years ago that some
[2:20:04] Pentecostal group said that um that the
[2:20:07] 12 disciples each one took one basket to
[2:20:09] their homes
[2:20:10] [Applause]
[2:20:13] so you get you get those baskets and
[2:20:15] give the pastor one you know so
[2:20:17] there's no you don't have those things
[2:20:19] we can get any you can anything in the
[2:20:20] Bible you know you can you can type it
[2:20:22] so and and of course if that's the
[2:20:24] elevation it is correct
[2:20:26] it's going to be I mean you can't
[2:20:28] disprove it the 12 disciples said the 12
[2:20:31] troubles gather them up so so they
[2:20:33] didn't throw them away he said so that
[2:20:34] nothing will be lost so who took them
[2:20:38] [Applause]
[2:20:40] thank you
[2:20:43] you'll be there complaining the
[2:20:45] disciples are having a basket each at
[2:20:47] home
[2:20:48] all right all right let's let's try to
[2:20:51] close out
[2:20:53] I really am sorry but I want you to get
[2:20:55] this here but what immediately is a god
[2:20:58] of abundance I have come that they might
[2:21:00] have life and they might have it more

[2:21:22] before me in
[2:21:30] he told Abraham I will bless you and you
[2:21:34] will be a blessing that means the
[2:21:36] blessing will overflow from you to
[2:21:38] others is a god of abundance get away
[2:21:41] from your small thinking
[2:21:44] and from it
[2:21:50] [Applause]
[2:21:51] big things

[2:21:57] oh Hallelujah

[2:22:10] is the word of God be careful for
[2:22:13] nothing how many of us can manage that

[2:23:13] secret is you may be seated
[2:23:16] your daily miracle
[2:23:18] lays in gratitude and the giving of
[2:23:20] thanks
[2:23:23] and you can only
[2:23:25] do that
[2:23:26] daily grateful living in graduate every

[2:26:05] The Secret of all successful people
[2:26:08] in every area of life
[2:26:10] is they have learned to live in the game
[2:26:13] and on the Gap studies studies show that
[2:26:16] the most successful people that's what
[2:26:17] they do
[2:26:18] and that's why you see people who are
[2:26:20] very endowed who are very ambitious they
[2:26:23] just don't move
[2:26:24] because they're just chasing this moving
[2:26:26] Target and they're not getting and they
[2:26:28] change the moving Target because you
[2:26:30] have a wrong mindset towards the gap
[2:26:33] Jesus recognized there's a gap here
[2:26:36] but he's not living there
[2:26:38] you leave the mindset of achievement in
[2:26:40] the Gap just like you as a Christian
[2:26:42] today
[2:26:43] there's a gap we're not adopted yet but
[2:26:45] you have a mindset here you have become
[2:26:47] a good work in you shall surely perform
[2:26:50] it until the deal you know you are
[2:26:52] getting there if you don't think you are
[2:26:54] getting there you will not get there
[2:26:56] that's why people are there people live
[2:26:58] in the Gap and say in the church this
[2:27:00] year brother Brown I don't believe it I
[2:27:01] don't believe that they're living in the
[2:27:02] up and so that's why they leave that's
[2:27:03] why they don't that's why they leave
[2:27:04] when you are like that and we can't
[2:27:06] admonish you by the world there's
[2:27:07] nothing anybody can do for you
[2:27:11] nothing
[2:27:13] just your choice
[2:27:14] but when you live in the game
[2:27:18] like like Ruth
[2:27:20] you say
[2:27:22] where you go I will go where you Lodge I
[2:27:27] will Lodge your God will be my God in
[2:27:31] the good times in the bad times then you
[2:27:34] are on to something good something good
[2:27:36] is about to happen to you because Jesus
[2:27:38] of Nazareth is passing your way

[2:28:06] in every area of Life business church
[2:28:10] ministry politics whatever is the learn
[2:28:14] to live in the game
[2:28:16] and on the gap
[2:28:17] maybe seated
[2:28:19] I don't think those guys playing tennis
[2:28:21] playing tennis and they they are they
[2:28:25] are one one one set point down one match
[2:28:29] point down from finishing there are two
[2:28:31] sets down and they are once one match
[2:28:35] point set game and match point away and
[2:28:39] they still go back because they're not
[2:28:41] focusing on the on the point they're
[2:28:43] gonna lose no if you do you will know
[2:28:46] you're out
[2:28:47] you are out
[2:28:50] right they are going back into their
[2:28:52] Inner Strength their mental toughness
[2:28:56] I can make it
[2:28:58] I'm gonna make it no it's just one point
[2:29:01] here is not going to pass me I'm gonna
[2:29:03] return the ball you are returning the
[2:29:05] Bible before the opponent serves the
[2:29:06] ball
[2:29:10] [Music]
[2:29:17] leaving him again
[2:29:20] is the advantage you need
[2:29:22] to power over the gap
[2:29:26] living and again and being grateful and
[2:29:29] thankful for it every day is the
[2:29:31] advantage you need the power you need to
[2:29:34] power over the gap
[2:29:36] oh again gives advantage
[2:29:39] amen
[2:29:41] and I'll just uh get a few examples and
[2:29:43] we'll
[2:29:44] we'll close out
[2:29:46] for all my
[2:29:49] Abraham
[2:29:53] Elijah
[2:29:55] Moses
[2:29:57] let's see what we can learn from them
[2:30:00] Abraham
[2:30:03] Romans that we read together the promise
[2:30:07] of God
[2:30:08] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[2:30:12] are you stood there he was strong in
[2:30:14] faith because he had much no no he has a
[2:30:15] secret he was strong in faith given
[2:30:18] glory to God
[2:30:22] Glory Thanksgiving Glory I glorify you I
[2:30:25] praise you
[2:30:26] that was Abram living in the game
[2:30:31] he refused to consider the deadness of
[2:30:33] his body he refers to
[2:30:37] him in the game and with the gratitude
[2:30:45] see
[2:30:47] there you have it Abraham's secret of
[2:30:51] that kind of faith for 25 years was
[2:30:54] gratitude because he was living in the
[2:30:56] game he was counting His blessings and
[2:30:59] thanking God
[2:31:01] for his Blessing so far let me tell you
[2:31:03] something about Abram that um
[2:31:06] but look at what showed me about oh I
[2:31:08] was talking about the other day
[2:31:10] just to take him into a picture Abraham
[2:31:13] you'll be father many nations around 25
[2:31:15] years nothing came nothing
[2:31:17] and his wife was 65 and then she became
[2:31:20] 90 and that's when you go for
[2:31:22] nominations
[2:31:23] but he didn't you know now Abraham did
[2:31:25] not consider it she said well that's
[2:31:27] like a story no you write your own story
[2:31:29] what are you what do you know because if
[2:31:32] you consider it will weaken his faith
[2:31:35] so 25 years this child came oh thank God
[2:31:38] no the children are going to come now
[2:31:40] I'm just going to come in plenty
[2:31:41] the Bible said Isaac was 40 years old
[2:31:46] when he married
[2:31:49] Rebecca
[2:31:51] are you following me
[2:31:53] so Abram from Abraham's perspective
[2:31:55] it was 75 so as it came when it was 100
[2:31:59] 25 years then he saw Isaac 40 years old
[2:32:02] he didn't even get married this boy here
[2:32:05] go get a wife
[2:32:08] so that the promise can come to pass
[2:32:10] come you can come to pass
[2:32:15] but I like the kind of parent Abraham
[2:32:16] was but let me leave that alone
[2:32:18] so all the all the nonsense anyway
[2:32:20] forgive me let me know I'll get to it
[2:32:23] but not today not today I'll get there
[2:32:30] and then the Bible said when I saw
[2:32:32] Abraham said oh so God thank you this
[2:32:34] this for he said in Isaac shall that
[2:32:36] seed
[2:32:37] be
[2:32:40] so so we expect Isaac will just have
[2:32:43] these children like 12 children 15
[2:32:45] children 20 and then the children would
[2:32:46] just would just be like a geometric
[2:32:48] progression like that
[2:32:49] and then he waited 20 years 65 years 40
[2:32:52] years 65 years after the promise only
[2:32:54] one child came
[2:32:56] how do you think Abraham failed God this
[2:32:59] promise of
[2:33:01] stars in the heavens
[2:33:03] like the sun on the seashore
[2:33:08] this
[2:33:10] this message
[2:33:12] well
[2:33:14] and then as you finally got married at
[2:33:17] 40 she thank God the babies are going to
[2:33:19] come now and the Bible said for 20 years
[2:33:23] Rebecca was barren
[2:33:27] 25 to 40 to 20. that after the promise
[2:33:32] was into Abraham 85 years only one child
[2:33:37] only one child maybe five years
[2:33:42] put yourself in Abraham's shoes and see
[2:33:45] how great you'll be jumping God is
[2:33:46] fulfilling This Promise
[2:33:48] we were in exactly the same spot many
[2:33:50] times but Abraham's tiger nut
[2:33:53] refused to be dragged into the the Gap
[2:33:57] and when the babies came it was two boys
[2:34:03] add that to Abrams 75 plus 75 plus 2500
[2:34:07] plus 40 when I got my 140 plus 21 Eureka
[2:34:11] had the boys 160.
[2:34:14] and then when it was 160 years old he
[2:34:17] had these two so three now three after
[2:34:19] 85 years
[2:34:20] three children and we're going to
[2:34:22] populate the whole Earth
[2:34:26] [Applause]
[2:34:32] Bible said Abraham live and and saw
[2:34:35] Jacob and Esau for 15 years Abraham that
[2:34:37] I won 75.
[2:34:39] but put yourself there put yourself
[2:34:40] there
[2:34:43] so what's the problem God came for his
[2:34:44] word or you are living in the gap
[2:34:47] or you are not waiting on God and what
[2:34:51] are you what's the problem here because
[2:34:52] God's word never fails never fails never
[2:34:57] fails
[2:34:58] no I refuse to accept that refuse I I
[2:35:00] just don't flow with my understanding of
[2:35:03] this theology here
[2:35:05] amen
[2:35:07] so Abraham refused to be dragged into
[2:35:10] the gap
[2:35:11] and stayed in the game and work stronger
[2:35:14] in faith every day why would you not
[2:35:16] work strong and feel that way when you
[2:35:17] see every single day Lord I saw how job
[2:35:20] before I got one day brother go can I
[2:35:22] were going home many many things he
[2:35:24] keeps you from
[2:35:26] and we're going and a policeman just
[2:35:28] stopped us on the way around and
[2:35:29] throwing shovels on the way and you know
[2:35:32] okay Dodge just getting a um area quite
[2:35:35] uncommon and all that so about 30
[2:35:36] seconds you let us go as we were going
[2:35:39] as we got on to Anthony I mean Anthony
[2:35:41] onto ikodu road in front of us if we
[2:35:44] were 30 that person would have been in
[2:35:46] front of us a truck just fell over
[2:35:49] if not for those 30 seconds we would
[2:35:51] have been right under that vehicle
[2:35:54] right under it
[2:35:56] [Applause]
[2:35:57] okay
[2:36:04] as a matter of two or three Witnesses
[2:36:08] so how many many things so that's why
[2:36:10] you are waxing stronger and further
[2:36:12] every day because you'll see more and
[2:36:14] more and more every day don't belittle
[2:36:17] the greatness of God he's a great God
[2:36:19] he's a real God he's a mighty God
[2:36:22] Hallelujah is the Mighty God of Israel
[2:36:25] he's the Mighty God of Israel
[2:36:32] so there you have Abraham's secret
[2:36:33] gratitude Thanksgiving thankfulness
[2:36:36] that's why I was strong in faith
[2:36:39] that's why I was able to stagger not now
[2:36:42] the promise of God he was living in the
[2:36:45] gain he was counting His blessings was
[2:36:48] thanking God for the blessings amen up
[2:36:51] to the present moment
[2:36:53] amen because his victory
[2:36:56] to power over the cup that remained
[2:37:01] his victory amen laid hidden in the game
[2:37:07] lead hidden
[2:37:09] in the Thanksgiving his Miracle LED him
[2:37:12] in the Thanksgiving oh brother amen
[2:37:17] glory to God Amen I'm almost done
[2:37:21] amen
[2:37:23] amen let's speak Elijah on the window of
[2:37:27] zaripath just to show you right here
[2:37:31] amen that was Elijah was a man of like
[2:37:33] passions like we are so we had doubts
[2:37:35] like you and I that's again of course
[2:37:37] you know like the God I'm the only one
[2:37:39] nobody else believes this message here
[2:37:42] I'm the only one in my school and
[2:37:43] everything so yes Elijah got depressed
[2:37:46] and went under a tree on some Junior
[2:37:49] Elijah man like you and I
[2:37:52] so what story are you right they wrote
[2:37:54] their story what story are you writing
[2:37:56] accountable amen
[2:37:59] Elijah on the Widow of zeropath
[2:38:01] farming there will be no no rain for
[2:38:04] three years and six months at my world
[2:38:07] so there was farming in the land and God
[2:38:09] told Elijah
[2:38:11] I will
[2:38:13] I I will provide food for you in the
[2:38:15] farming years
[2:38:17] we have the largest message spiritual
[2:38:20] farming spiritual food induces and
[2:38:22] brother Branham called it
[2:38:24] but it applies to even your natural
[2:38:26] Endeavors too
[2:38:28] it's a place to it
[2:38:29] amen the scripture
[2:38:34] they drag on the farming represent
[2:38:36] spiritual family represented
[2:38:38] a bad government represented
[2:38:42] a recession and they're predicting the
[2:38:44] U.S is going to have a recession they're
[2:38:46] predicting it I mean for next year and
[2:38:48] one you know once America catches a cold
[2:38:51] they don't even need to copy it one
[2:38:53] America has to hold the whole world just
[2:38:55] whatever so it's coming things are going
[2:38:57] to get multiple tighter
[2:38:59] yeah so although whatever Nigerian
[2:39:01] elections say is doesn't it's going to
[2:39:02] get hurt it's not going to change even
[2:39:04] if you choose the right person it's
[2:39:06] going to be overnight no it's not going
[2:39:07] to be it's not going to be no it's not
[2:39:09] going to be
[2:39:11] but in spite of that
[2:39:15] in spite of of what was going on in
[2:39:17] Egypt God's children were protected
[2:39:19] somewhere in Goshen like
[2:39:22] devotion like paradise
[2:39:26] the fire did not tell them were in
[2:39:27] Paradise waiting for the missile to come
[2:39:33] so God said
[2:39:35] by the Brook charity I have the ravings
[2:39:38] to feed you now wait a minute wait a
[2:39:39] minute God for real like you guys would
[2:39:42] say
[2:39:43] Raven to feed me food
[2:39:46] that sounds like the Five Loaves and two
[2:39:50] fishes for five thousand Ravens what's
[2:39:53] Raven a raven gonna do
[2:39:56] how much food are they gonna bring me in
[2:39:58] the morning and in the night
[2:40:01] how much food are they gonna bring me
[2:40:03] but no Elijah
[2:40:06] and one thing about Ravens too Ravens
[2:40:08] are very selfish
[2:40:10] Ravens don't share their food they don't
[2:40:13] so God went to the most difficult
[2:40:17] Birds
[2:40:18] and talk to those Gods I want you to get
[2:40:22] enough food
[2:40:23] for Elijah morning and night every
[2:40:27] single day
[2:40:29] and it's grateful for him
[2:40:32] [Applause]
[2:40:45] and when that season was over God said
[2:40:48] come in the city now
[2:40:50] I have a billionaire to
[2:40:53] send go to their house and you provide
[2:40:55] you food there no
[2:40:57] no
[2:40:59] it's not even your husband and wife no
[2:41:02] a widow woman
[2:41:04] Five Loaves
[2:41:05] and two fishes
[2:41:07] he said I have commanded
[2:41:10] a widow woman there to feed you
[2:41:12] [Applause]
[2:41:14] and when Elijah went down by the spirit
[2:41:17] of God like where is our Elijah he went
[2:41:20] and went like on Jemima but the Panama
[2:41:22] went and saw the woman two crosses how
[2:41:26] would Elijah have known she was at the
[2:41:29] point where she was just gonna eat and
[2:41:31] die
[2:41:33] foreign
[2:41:34] she was living in the Gap but he had
[2:41:36] came Deliverance like to you this
[2:41:38] morning stop
[2:41:40] brings destruction he brings failure
[2:41:44] brings lack it brings you nothing
[2:41:49] [Music]
[2:41:51] when Elijah came on the scene
[2:41:54] he saw the woman he was gonna go listen
[2:41:57] to her brother Branham I can see hot
[2:41:59] sunny afternoon and see him coming
[2:42:02] [Applause]
[2:42:04] what about him he said make me a cake
[2:42:08] first bet me a cake first the woman
[2:42:11] looked
[2:42:13] bakery cake
[2:42:15] that's why I say those adults there
[2:42:17] maybe there are some adults who hid
[2:42:19] their food
[2:42:21] in that
[2:42:23] in that place because that's what the
[2:42:25] adults do big Mickey will say ah
[2:42:29] Bros this food is only enough for me
[2:42:33] and my son
[2:42:35] there are many adults in that place who
[2:42:37] they're looking for food please they're
[2:42:39] looking for just please just
[2:42:42] any food no no we are not here
[2:42:45] no no no
[2:42:47] don't you think you're 10 lies no no I
[2:42:50] mean they're asking for extra food for
[2:42:51] everybody else I only have enough of
[2:42:53] myself
[2:42:54] but Elijah said woman big she was living
[2:42:58] in the gap
[2:43:00] that's how many of you do when you live
[2:43:02] in the Gap you are just so filled with
[2:43:03] the luck mentality
[2:43:05] you you have a victim mentality there
[2:43:08] against me they're coming at me it's me
[2:43:11] alone they are getting at me and I just
[2:43:13] have a lack victim mentality
[2:43:15] [Applause]
[2:43:17] when there's abundance all around
[2:43:20] when there's an oasis of love like the
[2:43:22] song that have fun and voices of love
[2:43:26] there's food for the hungry he says
[2:43:29] abundance all around
[2:43:32] how could that woman know in that one
[2:43:34] barrel of meal and the crush of oil in
[2:43:37] it was hidden
[2:43:39] food that will last her for three and a
[2:43:41] half years how would she know
[2:43:45] [Music]
[2:43:47] so it's not the size of the god
[2:43:51] because in there it's just a warehouse
[2:43:55] for the blessing
[2:43:59] Elijah said I understand you are living
[2:44:02] in the Gap but I'm telling you of a more
[2:44:05] excellent way come in again I'll tell
[2:44:07] you go bake me a cake first
[2:44:10] he said no just myself
[2:44:14] there's no death here there's no luck
[2:44:17] here there's no negativity here the holy
[2:44:19] spirit is in the camp Jesus is on the
[2:44:22] scene
[2:44:23] get me a cake first and she obeyed I
[2:44:26] hope you obey today
[2:44:29] no no no I must be a big make cake for
[2:44:32] us no no
[2:44:35] no no no no
[2:44:36] that wasn't making cake for sure you
[2:44:38] don't bring me cake I don't even eat
[2:44:39] them so don't don't bring Medicaid but
[2:44:42] I'm just you get my point right
[2:44:44] all right trying to say something no I'm
[2:44:46] not saying anything nothing I'm not
[2:44:47] saying anything no I don't want any cake
[2:44:49] no I don't
[2:44:52] bake me a cake for us
[2:44:55] like some brothers in Trinidad years ago
[2:44:57] they wanted to do Elijah they wanted
[2:44:59] some shop you know China they eat Roti
[2:45:01] they eat Roti so they went to the store
[2:45:03] and the people were trying to they just
[2:45:04] said there one of the brothers I met him
[2:45:07] in the states in 83 and he he is my
[2:45:09] favorite Was Elijah he was the message
[2:45:10] and backslide and I think he has a
[2:45:12] mental thing so he had a chain like
[2:45:14] Elijah's Mantle a chain very heavy chain
[2:45:16] I saw him I even have a concern with him
[2:45:17] 83 but you had this big chain there and
[2:45:20] like some ropes and so he went to this
[2:45:22] store here and said bake me a roti first
[2:45:26] because it was Elijah baked me already
[2:45:28] for us he said what
[2:45:31] if you don't get out of here
[2:45:35] we call the cops on you say big they
[2:45:39] drove him out of there
[2:45:42] Elijah first and she obeyed and was
[2:45:45] going and it was when she was going in
[2:45:48] other words Elijah was teaching her was
[2:45:50] tutoring her to how to stop living in
[2:45:53] the Gap and leaving the game and she
[2:45:56] changed her perspective I will do what
[2:45:58] the word says I will do what the prophet
[2:46:01] of the life of Elijah says I will go and
[2:46:04] bake the cake and as she was going for
[2:46:07] the sake of the Lord
[2:46:11] the power of mute shall not waste nor
[2:46:14] the cruise of all fail thus share the
[2:46:16] Lord and I said today your vial of meals
[2:46:20] shall not waste neither will your Crews
[2:46:23] of warfare
[2:46:24] if you learn to live in the game with
[2:46:28] graduate on Thanksgiving every single
[2:46:30] day one more example I will go home Oh
[2:46:32] Glory
[2:46:36] Glory Hallelujah
[2:46:39] [Music]
[2:46:41] Glory
[2:46:46] Hallelujah
[2:46:49] [Applause]
[2:46:55] Hallelujah
[2:47:02] [Applause]
[2:47:14] oh my
[2:47:16] [Applause]
[2:47:21] here
[2:47:23] [Applause]
[2:47:25] what was it friends
[2:47:26] was the moral here what's the lesson
[2:47:28] here Elijah told this woman
[2:47:31] amen
[2:47:33] the focus on the game plus gratitude
[2:47:38] will multiply
[2:47:40] the solution the literally you have in
[2:47:42] your hand
[2:47:43] like the song that the two David sang
[2:47:45] what do you have in your hand what do
[2:47:48] you have in your hand
[2:47:50] amen
[2:47:52] Elijah taught her the value of
[2:47:55] appreciation the value of gratitude
[2:47:59] for what she has in her hand for what
[2:48:01] God has done for us for the little
[2:48:02] things of Life The Little Blessings of
[2:48:04] life
[2:48:05] amen
[2:48:07] and the value of that
[2:48:09] and not what she doesn't have what
[2:48:12] somebody else have and you don't have
[2:48:15] and he belittles God in your estimation
[2:48:19] amen
[2:48:21] um because Elijah told her that she
[2:48:23] switched her mind
[2:48:25] and took on the advantage of living in
[2:48:28] the game
[2:48:29] oh Hallelujah
[2:48:31] from the advising her favor to begin to
[2:48:34] live and again shifting her mind away
[2:48:37] from the Gap and into the game
[2:48:40] shift the man away from what she did not
[2:48:42] have
[2:48:42] to every little blessing
[2:48:45] because you know it's not the size of
[2:48:47] the blessing he takes a beggar I make
[2:48:49] him a king
[2:48:50] the bigger doesn't have to be like the
[2:48:52] one who is that head of Beggars first
[2:48:54] and then the the chairman of the biggest
[2:48:56] station no
[2:48:58] no
[2:49:02] How could a meal the Bible says for and
[2:49:06] she and her house her son and Elijah ate
[2:49:09] until the farming was over and the
[2:49:12] drought was over three and a half years
[2:49:14] in a barrel of meal
[2:49:17] and a cruise of all one barrel and one
[2:49:20] Cruise like fabulous it was hidden there
[2:49:22] so it's not the size of the little thing
[2:49:25] God has done for you no
[2:49:27] [Applause]
[2:49:28] is your gratitude that pulls the miracle
[2:49:31] out oh Holly let's make 2023 a year of
[2:49:36] Thanksgiving every single day and they
[2:49:38] will have a harvest of testimonies you
[2:49:40] will have to have a successful with
[2:49:42] every single day oh Hallelujah
[2:49:44] Hallelujah
[2:49:45] [Applause]
[2:49:50] Elijah told her that
[2:49:53] and later understand the value of what
[2:49:55] you have in your hand what is I ask you
[2:49:58] this afternoon as I'm finishing the
[2:49:59] clothes what is in your hand
[2:50:01] what do you have in your hand
[2:50:03] what do you have to thank God for
[2:50:06] but he hasn't done anything for you at
[2:50:08] all
[2:50:09] what has he done for you
[2:50:11] tell me one thing he has done for you
[2:50:13] let's sit down List It
[2:50:15] count your blessings
[2:50:17] pennies organists count your blessings
[2:50:19] amen
[2:50:22] like Moses

[2:50:29] and I have come down to deliver them and
[2:50:33] I'm sending you Moses
[2:50:38] that joke and please if they joke God
[2:50:41] I'm sorry to say about you know
[2:50:42] everything but me too God you know now
[2:50:47] with all those drones that will fish me
[2:50:49] out from wherever I am
[2:50:51] uh God please
[2:50:53] said what do you have in your hand and
[2:50:54] say God please the joke the joke the
[2:50:57] joke is making you serious what I have
[2:50:58] in my hand this stick
[2:51:01] ah I get that's right Pastor Sean says
[2:51:04] the staff
[2:51:06] that's right that's what the Bible calls
[2:51:07] tough
[2:51:08] Pastor Sean that's right I told him he's
[2:51:11] going to preach one of these days he
[2:51:12] said sure it's still it's still the
[2:51:14] closer we get to the preaching the the
[2:51:16] father he gets away from it so
[2:51:19] perhaps
[2:51:22] so he has a staff in his hand said God
[2:51:24] to him that stuff here in that stuff is
[2:51:26] hidden the power that will overtake and
[2:51:30] bring down the lone superpower in the
[2:51:33] world at that time for us is a story but
[2:51:35] for Moses it was something he lived
[2:51:37] and your situation right now
[2:51:40] what do you have in your hand
[2:51:43] what do you have in your hand
[2:51:46] oh Hallelujah
[2:51:47] [Applause]
[2:51:49] so I say what do you have in your hand
[2:51:51] identify what he has done for you that's
[2:51:53] what you have in your hand
[2:51:55] and if everybody has done for you
[2:51:57] and thank him for it and in there you
[2:52:01] recognize the Gap that's still there and
[2:52:04] then you set out
