[37:48] morning
[37:50] sins truly the day of prayer and fast
[37:53] was something special for me I hadn't
[37:56] been able to do it for quite a while as
[37:59] I would like to but uh this this Friday
[38:03] was really special and during that
[38:06] time the Lord brought something to me
[38:09] that I put into the form of a poem that
[38:11] I'd like to share with
[38:13] you hope gives me the grace to do
[38:16] justice to it as I received it and I
[38:19] hope that it will help some weary
[38:22] Soldier some weary traveler along the
[38:26] way it's called The
[38:28] Blessing but it's a poem with a subtitle
[38:31] the subtitle is no cross no
[38:35] Crown they see your
[38:38] glory but they don't know your
[38:41] story they see your
[38:43] gain but they don't know the cost in
[38:47] pain they say look how you are blessed
[38:51] but do they know about the stress
[38:55] fighting to live yet willing to to give
[38:58] to any in need sowing a charity
[39:02] seed yay my cup cup ha
[39:05] overflowed but do you know or do you
[39:08] remember the rough roads that I rode
[39:11] into darkness dark tunnels of depression
[39:15] and fight to steer through the dark to
[39:19] the beckoning light no cross no Crown
[39:23] the way up is down down on your knees
[39:28] for Satan trembles when he
[39:30] sees when he sees that that most
[39:33] powerful place where we seek God's
[39:37] face oh we see the
[39:39] victory but are we blind to the Garden
[39:43] of
[39:44] Gethsemane before the Battle of
[39:46] obedience Was Won by that great example
[39:50] son before we could be washed by the
[39:53] Crimson flood his anguish and his agony
[39:57] had to turn his sweat into drops of
[40:00] blood many won the cross many won the
[40:04] crown but not the cross not knowing that
[40:07] there can be no gain without loss loss
[40:11] of self passion Pride the three that
[40:15] make the enemy's threefold cord and lead
[40:18] us to Hell's Gates which are open
[40:22] wide no cross no Crown the way up is
[40:28] down we have to be shaped we have to be
[40:31] molded on the road to Emos even in their
[40:35] distress he
[40:37] scolded we have to be tempted we have to
[40:40] be tried on that very Road he rebuked
[40:43] them oh fools and slow of heart ought
[40:46] not Christ to have suffered and died so
[40:49] never forget the master
[40:52] key to unlock Untold treasures and
[40:55] victory one musty on bended

[1:03:51] after the Fast and the prayer meeting
[1:03:53] she sent me this I didn't ask her to
[1:03:55] read it but I feel it was a powerful
[1:03:56] thing to read she said good evening
[1:03:58] brother ID this is Friday after the
[1:04:00] prayer meeting I just want to say thank
[1:04:02] you for the exhortation you brought
[1:04:04] tonight you said you were excited to
[1:04:07] bring it to us but I was excited to hear
[1:04:10] it was a Vindication to me when you
[1:04:12] spoke of the role of the
[1:04:14] seraphin I usually spend a few moments
[1:04:17] during my lunch break at work to pray
[1:04:20] for a few minutes I read a
[1:04:24] scripture it could under line
[1:04:26] this and take this as an
[1:04:29] example this is where you could find
[1:04:31] your space I want to read it again I
[1:04:34] usually this what habits come in
[1:04:37] repeated the right thing doing the right
[1:04:40] thing I usually spend a few moments
[1:04:44] during my lunch break at work to pray
[1:04:48] for a few minutes and read a scripture
[1:04:52] you know what she's doing there she's
[1:04:54] actually building an altar
[1:04:56] amen a place where you can
[1:04:59] pray you could do that on the job you
[1:05:01] could do that in the bathroom you could
[1:05:03] do that before you eat you could do that
[1:05:06] in the kitchen wherever you could make a
[1:05:08] place a consistent
[1:05:13] time the past two days I read the same
[1:05:16] scripture Isaiah 6 and I especially
[1:05:18] highlighted verses 5 to 7 and read it
[1:05:20] over and over to get into my spirit the
[1:05:23] meaning of what I was reading
[1:05:27] now I usually go on to a new scripture
[1:05:30] each day this is great I certainly
[1:05:32] appreciate the testimony because some
[1:05:35] people had
[1:05:36] a hold Bible
[1:05:43] and had to blow the dust off the Bible
[1:05:46] to see when last it was
[1:05:48] turned
[1:05:51] uh I usually go onto a new scripture
[1:05:53] each day as I mention something kept me
[1:05:56] from moving from this scripture
[1:05:58] yesterday and today you could imagine my
[1:06:00] excitement when you started speaking
[1:06:02] about it tonight I so got it
[1:06:05] additionally during my morning devotion
[1:06:07] I hear that again do do we have that do
[1:06:12] you have that during my morning devotion
[1:06:16] one of the things I asked God for is
[1:06:20] that he would help me to be mindful of
[1:06:23] his presence as I go through the day
[1:06:27] what a prayer this is this had to be
[1:06:29] read this morning I know I was checking
[1:06:31] about all these different ones uh
[1:06:33] different Brothers different uh men of
[1:06:36] God in the in the Old Testament all of
[1:06:38] them built altars Noah and and and and
[1:06:41] Jacob and and and Isaac all them built
[1:06:43] altars but you know one man who didn't
[1:06:45] build any altar
[1:06:50] lot lot after came out of Sodom he
[1:06:52] didn't me alter he got drunk
[1:06:56] I wouldn't say no more on
[1:06:59] that he didn't even make an altar of
[1:07:02] Thanksgiving sometime God bless us and
[1:07:03] God do so much for us and like the pig
[1:07:06] the the apples falling on the pig and
[1:07:08] grunt grunt grunt grunt only eating
[1:07:10] never look up and say thank you Lord or
[1:07:12] you always have a complaint you always
[1:07:14] have something to negative you have
[1:07:16] something to to to to to to to to to
[1:07:18] bring down or pull down you wouldn't say
[1:07:20] thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you
[1:07:22] Lord your ey longing what others have
[1:07:25] and what in said Thank You
[1:07:29] Lord some people have things but no
[1:07:35] peace let's
[1:07:38] continue additionally during my morning
[1:07:40] devotion one of the things I ask God for
[1:07:42] is that he helped me to be mindful of
[1:07:45] his presence as I go through the day
[1:07:46] call practice in his presence I have
[1:07:49] found that my days are filled with Songs
[1:07:52] of Praise In My Heart
[1:07:56] and even though I have some challenging
[1:07:59] days at work I deal with the challenges
[1:08:02] differently
[1:08:04] now one such example I don't know if you
[1:08:07] have heard I was in a bad vehicle
[1:08:09] accident early this week someone fell
[1:08:12] asleep at the wheel and ran into me at
[1:08:14] full speed pushing my vehicle on the car
[1:08:17] in front of me the gentleman who ran
[1:08:20] into me got out of the vehicle and came
[1:08:22] and apologized to me for falling asleep
[1:08:25] on the weel
[1:08:26] my previous reaction would have been
[1:08:28] anger towards him but I was so calm and
[1:08:33] literally compassionate to him I felt
[1:08:37] sorry for him this demonstrated to
[1:08:40] myself a change that I wasn't aware has
[1:08:47] occurred but for this situation could we
[1:08:51] give the Lord some
[1:08:53] praises and you see many times God do a
[1:08:56] work in you and you don't even know
[1:08:58] until something happen and you see your
[1:09:00] reaction and behavior that demonstrated
[1:09:03] is a work of God that's in your life we
[1:09:06] give the Lord some
[1:09:10] Praises I could go on with lots more but
[1:09:13] this is the gist of what I had on my
[1:09:15] heart thank you my dear pastor and may
[1:09:16] God bless you and your family praise the
[1:09:18] Lord and this is the scripture she had
[1:09:21] from Isaiah 65 then I said who is me
[1:09:24] from an i am UND done note is didn't say
[1:09:27] who is
[1:09:28] you some people like that you you you
[1:09:33] you always blaming someone always have a
[1:09:36] reason to justify their foolishness and
[1:09:39] their behavior by casting is the teacher
[1:09:42] is the mother is the uncle is the
[1:09:44] husband not me is
[1:09:46] he is she is them a liar I'm calling you
[1:09:51] out this morning you know who I talking
[1:09:53] to I ain't talking to nobody else but
[1:09:55] you you have no excuses deal with your
[1:09:59] issues deal with you Hallelujah war is
[1:10:04] me I'm a man I'm undone because I am a
[1:10:08] man of unclean lips I dwell in the midst
[1:10:10] of a people of unclean lips for my eyes
[1:10:12] have seen the king the Lord of hosts
[1:10:15] then flew one of the seraphim unto me
[1:10:17] having a live coal in his hand which he
[1:10:19] had taken with the tong of the Altar and
[1:10:21] he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo
[1:10:23] this had touch thy lips that iniquity is
[1:10:25] taken away and thy s s sin is purged oh
[1:10:29] may give God some Praises here what a
[1:10:31] testimony thank you sister June for
[1:10:33] sharing this with us I believe it a
[1:10:35] blessing to the people so could we stand
[1:10:38] as we want to go into the word this
[1:10:39] morning we have one service today
[1:10:41] there's no communion service just one
[1:10:42] service so not be because I have one
[1:10:46] service I'll take advantage of you and
[1:10:48] pay for 5 hours I could maybe just be
[1:10:50] for three praise the Lord I know you
[1:10:54] love okay so we want to read Mark
[1:10:58] chapter 7 reading from verse
[1:11:01] 14 and this is Jesus after the scribes
[1:11:06] and the Pharisees came to ask him why
[1:11:08] his disciples are not following
[1:11:11] traditions in the message of the yah
[1:11:14] that time washing pots and pans and so
[1:11:16] like that and and and whatnot because
[1:11:18] they believe that when you do this clean
[1:11:20] axe you know like washing pans and and
[1:11:23] peeling potatoes and so like that that
[1:11:25] they are fine so Jesus in Mark 7 verse4
[1:11:30] I want to skip down and when he had
[1:11:33] called the people unto him he said unto
[1:11:36] them Heen unto me every one of you and
[1:11:39] understand there is nothing from within
[1:11:41] a man without a man that enter into him
[1:11:45] can defile him but the things which come
[1:11:48] out of him those are they that defile
[1:11:51] the man if any man have ears to hear
[1:11:55] here let him hear and when he was
[1:11:59] entered into the house from the people
[1:12:02] his disciples asked him concerning the
[1:12:04] parable and he said unto them are ye not
[1:12:08] without understanding also do you not
[1:12:11] perceive that whatsoever thing from
[1:12:13] without enter a man it cannot defile him
[1:12:15] because it enter into his heart it
[1:12:17] entered not into his heart but into his
[1:12:21] belly and go it out into the draw and
[1:12:24] purchase all Meats he said that which
[1:12:27] cometh out of the man that defileth the
[1:12:29] man for from within not outside from
[1:12:34] within out of the heart of men proceed
[1:12:38] evil thoughts
[1:12:40] adulteries
[1:12:42] fornications murders thefts covetousness
[1:12:47] wickedness deceit lishness an evil eye
[1:12:52] blasphemy Pride foolishness
[1:12:55] all these evil things come from within
[1:12:59] and defile the man and let's go now to
[1:13:03] John chapter
[1:13:06] 14 I'm excited about the scripture sorry
[1:13:10] John 14 verse
[1:13:12] 28 and Jesus speaks you have heard how I
[1:13:16] said unto you I go away and come again
[1:13:20] unto you if you love me you will
[1:13:23] rejoice because I I go unto my the
[1:13:27] father for the father is greater than I
[1:13:30] and now I have told you before it come
[1:13:33] to pass that when it come to pass he
[1:13:36] might
[1:13:37] believe
[1:13:39] Hereafter I will not talk much with you
[1:13:43] for the prince of this world cometh and
[1:13:47] had nothing in me let's pray heavenly
[1:13:51] father I pray Jesus that your holy
[1:13:52] spirit will take the words tonight and
[1:13:55] open us up Lord like Revelation
[1:13:59] inspiration I have no idea which way
[1:14:01] this will go but I pray you bless Lord
[1:14:04] what's what you place upon my heart and
[1:14:06] may
[1:14:07] you uh release spirit's given words
[1:14:10] Spirit spoken words to your people to
[1:14:11] bring light and life granted Lord in
[1:14:13] Jesus name I ask it amen amen you may be
[1:14:16] seated Oh Praise
[1:14:19] godj I have a a context scripture I'd
[1:14:23] like to read and that's Romans 13:12 to4
[1:14:26] it says the night is fast spent the days
[1:14:29] at hand let us therefore cast off the
[1:14:31] work of Darkness so so this is an
[1:14:33] exaltation here let us cast off the
[1:14:36] works of darkness and let us put on the
[1:14:38] armor of light let us walk honestly so
[1:14:41] that's something you have to do by
[1:14:43] choice like forgiveness is not a feeling
[1:14:46] waiting to see if they repent first you
[1:14:48] you not you're not you're not you're not
[1:14:50] you're not you're not serious
[1:14:52] forgiveness is a choice certain things
[1:14:54] is it's a choice to be honest to to do
[1:14:57] right it's a choice you choose that you
[1:14:58] don't have to feel nothing to do that
[1:15:00] you know you do what is right you will
[1:15:02] come out right the night is fast spent
[1:15:04] the days at hand let us therefore cast
[1:15:06] off the works of darkness let us put on
[1:15:08] the arm of light let us walk honestly in
[1:15:10] as in the day not in rioting drunkenness
[1:15:12] not in chambering wanness not in strife
[1:15:15] and envying I want to get to but put you
[1:15:17] on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not
[1:15:20] Provisions for the flesh to fulfill the
[1:15:22] lust thereof what he is saying we could
[1:15:25] make provision for the flesh to Rob to
[1:15:27] steal to fornicate to adultery we could
[1:15:30] make that that's your choice amen but
[1:15:33] the Bible exal us make not provision in
[1:15:35] other words don't create the environment
[1:15:37] for the flesh to be misbehave and act up
[1:15:40] oh give the Lord some
[1:15:42] Praises all right so this verse we read
[1:15:45] this last scripture we read in John 14
[1:15:47] and the
[1:15:48] Amplified Jesus was saying this here in
[1:15:51] verse 13 He Amplified I will not talk
[1:15:54] with you much more for the prince Evil
[1:15:59] Genius ruler of the world is
[1:16:02] coming and he has no claim on
[1:16:05] me he has nothing in common with me
[1:16:09] there is nothing in me that belongs to

[1:31:52] Hallelujah Hallelujah all heaven was
[1:31:56] shut off of mankind Satan is the prince
[1:31:59] of the power of the
[1:32:00] air why at thou fallen from heaven or
[1:32:04] Lucifer no man could see the into Glory
[1:32:06] no man could understand because the
[1:32:07] power is just above us Heaven means
[1:32:10] atmosphere above then all of these
[1:32:13] Powers were shut off for mankind because
[1:32:15] of
[1:32:16] sin Let me just make a quick
[1:32:19] sis pointer here so Satan climax
[1:32:24] is to get a
[1:32:25] Superman that he can use so that the
[1:32:28] whole world will bow to him he has not
[1:32:32] canceled his desire to be like the most
[1:32:35] high and to be worshiped he has not
[1:32:37] canceled that if you think he canel that
[1:32:39] he he canel that the body of this
[1:32:43] Superman will be titled the Antichrist
[1:32:46] Spirit then the false prophet and then
[1:32:49] the
[1:32:49] Beast Satan is going to Incarnate in
[1:32:53] himself yes sir in a
[1:32:55] man see the spirits as beings without
[1:33:01] bodies beings without houses being
[1:33:05] looking for bodies that they can
[1:33:08] use but brand here we find out that
[1:33:11] Satan after being kicked out of heaven
[1:33:13] incarnates incarnates himself into the
[1:33:15] Beast now he's Beast he's Antichrist
[1:33:19] false prophet and now Beast given the
[1:33:21] name of death on the Earth
[1:33:25] he is Satan's representative on the
[1:33:28] earth so now you'll understand the
[1:33:31] importance of we heading towards a one
[1:33:33] world government or how all the nations
[1:33:36] of the
[1:33:37] bow under the Beast structure that will
[1:33:41] be built with technology and Satan
[1:33:45] himself so Satan was waiting for this
[1:33:48] Advanced technological age to establish
[1:33:51] his system on the Earth that is where
[1:33:54] artificial intelligence come right in
[1:33:56] and then he could step into it it going
[1:33:58] to be artificial no more you know he
[1:33:59] will be the intelligence behind
[1:34:04] them he is Satan represent on Earth and
[1:34:06] he is now the head of the kingdom of the
[1:34:08] world the very same Kingdom he offered
[1:34:10] to the Lord Jesus in Matthew 4 Satan now
[1:34:14] becomes a full
[1:34:16] King oh Hallelujah so watch something
[1:34:19] now he's in heaven he want to be like
[1:34:21] the most high he got kicked out fell on
[1:34:24] the earth he has no body he could use so
[1:34:27] it's just roaming Spirits roaman Spirits
[1:34:30] roaming Spirits he can't going into the
[1:34:32] dinosaur and the and and all them
[1:34:34] creatures that they had before the fall
[1:34:35] and whatnot he can't go into them things
[1:34:37] they waiting to see what going on go
[1:34:39] said let us make man in our image he
[1:34:40] can't touch
[1:34:41] Adam because Adam is original God gave
[1:34:45] adam some time to learn
[1:34:48] work and
[1:34:49] word he introduce woman to Adam yet
[1:34:53] these
[1:34:55] nowadays they have it mixed up have it
[1:34:57] kind of
[1:34:58] tired so Adam working in the garden and
[1:35:01] Eden working laboring toiling there was
[1:35:04] no man to tell the soil Adam was that
[1:35:06] man one man Adam man and then God his
[1:35:11] word eat eat of every tree and was cool
[1:35:13] with that problem he AR with the tree he
[1:35:15] AR with nobody then God say it's not
[1:35:18] good for man dwell alone people out Eve
[1:35:20] Satan saw opportunity aha Adam going to
[1:35:22] work here's Eve
[1:35:26] sat pull table coffee chair and coffee
[1:35:28] and what talk things invite Eve to the
[1:35:31] table and tell you be like God God knows
[1:35:34] God know something he didn't tell
[1:35:36] all Now Eve wasn't there when God spoke
[1:35:39] to Adam Eve heard from Adam God spoke to
[1:35:43] Adam Eve should have said hold on hold
[1:35:44] it hold it wait till my husband come
[1:35:47] home that's right she didn't do that man
[1:35:50] fell so now the devil get an opportunity
[1:35:53] or he gets a doorway to enter in oh give
[1:35:58] the Lord some
[1:36:01] Praises he get somebody he could use he
[1:36:03] had to find somebody you know if
[1:36:05] everybody he had clear and clean and
[1:36:07] pure and have right objective and motive
[1:36:08] no devil have nobody to use you know but
[1:36:10] once that people with corrupt and all
[1:36:12] kind of things he have somebody could
[1:36:13] use they I seen K they I seen this they
[1:36:15] seen that they feel this and they feel
[1:36:17] that and they feel the passage should Mo
[1:36:19] and I feel that and they don't like that
[1:36:21] and all kind of foolishness all that is
[1:36:23] Satan inside
[1:36:24] have nothing to do with the word of God
[1:36:25] you know the word of God is pure when
[1:36:27] God found me I was a rank Sinner and God

[1:45:11] Life
[1:45:14] Glory all
[1:45:16] right Matthew 12 Hallelujah 22-30
[1:45:23] and this is one of the core Parts we're
[1:45:25] going to go into this
[1:45:28] evening Matthew 12:22 to 38 says then
[1:45:32] was brought unto him for Jesus one
[1:45:35] possessed with a
[1:45:36] devil blind and
[1:45:39] dumb and he healed him in so much that
[1:45:43] the Blind and the dumb both spake and
[1:45:47] saw and all the people were amazed and
[1:45:50] said is not this this the son of God
[1:45:54] David and when the Pharisees heard it so
[1:45:57] the people saying this had to be the son
[1:45:59] of David right that's positive when the
[1:46:02] Pharisees heard that testimony they said
[1:46:04] this fellow do not cast out Devils but
[1:46:07] by
[1:46:08] B the prince of
[1:46:11] devils let's continue verse 45 and Jesus
[1:46:15] knew their thoughts and said unto them
[1:46:19] listen to Jesus words now every Kingdom
[1:46:23] divided against itself is brought to
[1:46:27] Desolation and every city or house
[1:46:31] divided against itself shall not stand
[1:46:35] and if
[1:46:37] Satan cast out Satan he is divided
[1:46:41] against
[1:46:42] himself then how shall his kingdom
[1:46:46] stand let's pull two or three things out
[1:46:49] of that number one Satan's kingdom is
[1:46:53] not
[1:46:55] divided and number two he has a
[1:47:01] kingdom and Jesus acknowledged that let
[1:47:05] me read it again for you if Satan cast
[1:47:08] out Satan he is divided against himself
[1:47:12] how shall then his kingdom stand so
[1:47:15] Satan's kingdom is standed because it's
[1:47:17] not
[1:47:18] divided he said every house
[1:47:21] divided will fall
[1:47:24] all and if I by belb cast out Devils by
[1:47:28] whom do your children cast them out
[1:47:30] therefore they shall be your judges but
[1:47:32] if I cast out Devils by the spirit of
[1:47:36] God then the kingdom of God is come unto
[1:47:41] you what is he
[1:47:43] saying all these years nobody never seek
[1:47:46] Devil's cast out the closest to it was
[1:47:49] David playing the H and an evil spirit
[1:47:52] giv saw a break but they never saw that
[1:47:56] so this deaf and dumb person give Jesus
[1:48:00] an opportunity to demonstrate to the
[1:48:02] world and to the people there's another
[1:48:04] Kingdom at
[1:48:06] work because I free the dumb and deaf
[1:48:09] from their condition showing you there
[1:48:11] is a different level there's a
[1:48:13] supernatural there's another level that
[1:48:14] you're not see with your eyes and I am
[1:48:17] from this Kingdom of Light and that is
[1:48:19] the kingdom of darkness oh give the Lord
[1:48:21] some praises
[1:48:23] glory to God blind kingdom of darkness
[1:48:26] affecting blindness and dff and Demon
[1:48:29] whatever it is and he came from the
[1:48:30] kingdom of light and releasing them from
[1:48:32] that and what he did that he exposed
[1:48:34] Satan
[1:48:35] Kingdom Hallelujah by the words that
[1:48:37] they were sa he said no no no no no no
[1:48:39] no no no I a coming through belzebub is
[1:48:42] this is the spirit of God oh give the
[1:48:44] Lord a shout in the house and one day
[1:48:47] maybe today I don't know one day his
[1:48:49] kingdom will be exposed by the kingdom
[1:48:52] of of Light by the manifestation of the
[1:48:55] sons of God they will come forth they
[1:48:58] will declare God they will Express God
[1:49:01] they will show God they will show what
[1:49:03] is hiding behind the scenes what is
[1:49:06] hiding behind individuals oh give the
[1:49:08] Lord I shout you have not light a man
[1:49:11] the light to the Holy Ghost oh give the
[1:49:14] Lord some
[1:49:15] [Applause]
[1:49:21] Praises Jesus
[1:49:23] vers 28 says if I cast all
[1:49:27] Devils by the spirit of God then the
[1:49:31] kingdom of God Has Come unto you amen
[1:49:34] but then Jesus went down a little
[1:49:35] further and deeper he says this or else
[1:49:39] how can one
[1:49:40] enter into a strong man's
[1:49:44] house and spoil his
[1:49:46] Goods except he first bind the strong
[1:49:50] man and then he will spoil his house
[1:49:53] he's talking about a strong
[1:49:56] man a strong man having a
[1:49:59] stronghold a strong man the home well
[1:50:05] protected EB
[1:50:07] proof he have other agents inside of
[1:50:10] there and he say how could you spoil
[1:50:13] that man go except you bind the strong
[1:50:15] man the little people running around the
[1:50:17] house and that they not they no
[1:50:20] influence is The Man Behind that
[1:50:23] and beond everything have a spirit you
[1:50:25] know there a man behind that Spirits
[1:50:29] just be affecting homes individuals
[1:50:33] churches families countries Spirit
[1:50:37] strong
[1:50:40] men then he said he that is not with me
[1:50:42] is against me and he that GTH not with
[1:50:45] me scattered abroad I want to take that
[1:50:48] first part there he that's not with me
[1:50:49] is against me in other words Jesus makes
[1:50:52] sure there there is no neutral
[1:50:55] grounds it's either you're
[1:50:58] for or you're
[1:51:00] against if the devil and your husband
[1:51:02] you can't stand by your husband with
[1:51:04] that devil on him you have to stand with
[1:51:05] the word if I see you standing with your
[1:51:07] husband and you have a devil and him you
[1:51:09] are not for
[1:51:10] Jesus because he said I come to bring a
[1:51:13] sword father against son mother against
[1:51:17] daughter I bring a sword for the word's
[1:51:21] sake we come compromise with our
[1:51:23] children we are not standing by the word
[1:51:25] if you stand by the word you will tell
[1:51:27] them the truth because Jesus said you
[1:51:29] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:51:31] going to set you free not when you
[1:51:34] compromise when you tell them the truth
[1:51:36] oh give the Lord some
[1:51:38] [Applause]
[1:51:48] Praises my God help me Jesus
[1:51:52] we have no communion this evening so I
[1:51:54] as well take this three
[1:51:56] [Applause]
[1:52:00] hours Romans 5 let's see you get from
[1:52:03] there I have so much scriptures so much
[1:52:04] stuff here but it's solid stuff that you
[1:52:08] could think about and meditate on and
[1:52:10] I'm hoping and trusting that this word
[1:52:12] will bring Clarity in your spirit that
[1:52:14] the battle truly is not flesh and blood
[1:52:17] why you fighting me because you seen my
[1:52:21] flesh you're not listen to the word that
[1:52:23] you're
[1:52:29] hearing verse 17 of Romans 5 for If by
[1:52:32] one man offense death Reign by one much
[1:52:36] more they which receive abundance of
[1:52:38] grace and the gift of righteousness
[1:52:39] shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ
[1:52:41] therefore as by the offense of one
[1:52:43] judgment Came Upon all men to
[1:52:45] condemnation even so by the
[1:52:47] righteousness of one the free gift came
[1:52:49] upon all men in the justification of
[1:52:51] life here we go
[1:52:53] for as by one man Disobedience many were
[1:52:55] made Sinners here we go by one Obedience
[1:52:59] of one shall many be made righteous
[1:53:02] moreover the law entered that the
[1:53:04] offense might abound and where sin
[1:53:05] abound here we go
[1:53:07] Grace did much more abound that as Sin
[1:53:11] had reigned unto death even so might
[1:53:13] grace Reign unto righteousness unto
[1:53:15] eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:53:17] could we give the Lord some
[1:53:19] Praises where sin AB Grace much more
[1:53:23] bound chapter 6 Paul went on and Paul
[1:53:26] pressing the word what shall we say then
[1:53:29] shall we continue in sin that Grace May
[1:53:32] AB because he's saying people can take
[1:53:34] that script and run with it you
[1:53:36] know more grace more
[1:53:38] sin as you sin you get more Grace with
[1:53:40] he sin it's not working so you know that
[1:53:44] man thoughts and ideas so Paul Paul
[1:53:47] answered that and said shall we continue
[1:53:48] in sin that Grace May abound he said God
[1:53:51] forbid how shall we that de to sin live
[1:53:53] any longer know ye not that so many of
[1:53:55] us that were baptized into Jesus Christ
[1:53:57] were baptized unto his death therefore
[1:53:59] we are buried with him by baptism andto
[1:54:01] death and like as Christ was raised up
[1:54:03] from the dead by the glory of the father
[1:54:05] even so we also should walk in the
[1:54:07] newness of life it's a walk in the
[1:54:10] newness of life you're going back to
[1:54:12] your old friends well back in school
[1:54:14] days
[1:54:15] now who upon
[1:54:20] them in school is the didn't know them
[1:54:22] you know better
[1:54:24] now but you're going back and you're
[1:54:25] talking and you know your I'm your
[1:54:27] friend your
[1:54:30] friend and when the friend to off mask
[1:54:32] sat p is a friend
[1:54:36] mask he is trading in
[1:54:39] souls he would use a friend a cousin a
[1:54:43] husband a wife whoever he could
[1:54:45] use to get you off track
[1:54:57] amen knowing this verse six our old man
[1:55:01] is crucified with him that the body of
[1:55:03] sin might be destroyed henceforth we
[1:55:05] should not serve
[1:55:07] sin for he that is dead is freed from
[1:55:10] sin not how he bring his words he that
[1:55:13] is dead
[1:55:15] is so if you put a cof on a manide is
[1:55:17] supposed to be dead and when you look so
[1:55:20] g a wink ey
[1:55:24] not only when you get frightened you
[1:55:26] know but you know that man cing his
[1:55:30] ey like I saw a few
[1:55:33] recently and a man talking to the
[1:55:36] dead I tell myself dead can hear nothing
[1:55:39] but you can see giving some warnings and
[1:55:41] I don't know what he's giving
[1:55:43] there that's how Christians are sometime
[1:55:46] you know they supposed to be dead but
[1:55:48] his hand going up God put hand now head
[1:55:50] go push on the head footstep Pi up get
[1:55:53] him out the C from man Not Dead Alive
[1:55:57] wrong burial you can't bury that what
[1:56:00] God want is
[1:56:03] death and we have to understand this is
[1:56:05] required to deal with this devil we have
[1:56:08] to deal
[1:56:12] with for that he died he died un verse
[1:56:15] 10 sin once that he liveth liveth unto
[1:56:17] God verse 11 likewise reckon ye
[1:56:21] yourselves to be dead inde deed not to
[1:56:23] sin but alive unto God through Jesus
[1:56:25] Christ Our Lord let not sin reign in
[1:56:30] your mortal body he is saying sin could
[1:56:33] reain in

[1:59:28] people wages of sin is death your Bible
[1:59:31] a lot of scriptures you just know by
[1:59:32] heart you know you know where to find
[1:59:33] them the W of sin is death but the gift
[1:59:35] of God eternal life through Jesus Christ
[1:59:38] now we come back to this text we talk
[1:59:40] about Jesus say I will not talk much
[1:59:41] with you for the prince The Evil Genius
[1:59:44] rule of the world is coming he has no
[1:59:46] claim on me he has nothing in common
[1:59:50] with me there is nothing in me that
[1:59:53] belongs to him he has no power over me
[1:59:57] when God told the
[2:00:00] prophet uh you have been given power to
[2:00:04] bind a m but be more
[2:00:08] sincere it was something that God was
[2:00:10] seeing not man everybody was seeing
[2:00:14] that's a prophet that's God's servants
[2:00:16] and everything else now note what God
[2:00:18] did he didn't tell him if you be more
[2:00:22] say you will get
[2:00:24] power note what happened to Jesus he
[2:00:27] didn't went into willingness to get
[2:00:29] power the power came on him and he was
[2:00:32] filled with the fullness of the Holy
[2:00:34] Ghost and he was led by the spirit Into
[2:00:39] the Wilderness so he didn't go fasting
[2:00:41] to get power he had power and went into
[2:00:44] fasting so the prophet was given power
[2:00:48] and then he went and fast because God
[2:00:51] says Be more sincere and he wanted to do
[2:00:54] something to show God he get the message
[2:00:59] and he want to apply something to his
[2:01:01] heart and life he didn't just say oh you
[2:01:04] say be more say all right Lord thank you

[2:19:16] prophesy and we have been doing it for
[2:19:18] years and now we have the testimony of
[2:19:21] Jesus which is the spirit of Prophecy
[2:19:23] Let's Go hallu part of Satan's
[2:19:27] Advantage is our
[2:19:31] ignorance or lack of
[2:19:33] knowledge as to the operation of his
[2:19:36] kingdom which is not
[2:19:39] divided
[2:19:41] ignorance of the enemy's
[2:19:43] Kingdom strategies and
[2:19:46] operations so the Scribe and phes bear
[2:19:48] in mind D put and and ritual and all
[2:19:51] kind of ceremony and Stuff This Man
[2:19:54] Called Jesus is like a
[2:19:57] rebel he is stressing them out he is
[2:20:00] doing stuff that they never saw them
[2:20:02] before but when this dumb and deaf man
[2:20:04] SC they couldn't handle it because
[2:20:08] Jesus pull out the WRA over Satan's
[2:20:12] kingdom and showing that this dumb and
[2:20:15] deaf and all these things is from
[2:20:16] another
[2:20:17] real and I have power over that real
[2:20:23] all the strong men that was binding
[2:20:25] death on them I binding
[2:20:28] them so the death could go free the dumb
[2:20:32] could go free the blind could go free
[2:20:35] whatever was binding upon them the
[2:20:37] strong man upon the life are binding
[2:20:42] that so he exposed them for trying to
[2:20:45] accuse him of dealing with the devil he
[2:20:48] was showing he had a better Kingdom
[2:20:51] a greater Kingdom a more powerful
[2:20:54] Kingdom light will always overcome
[2:20:56] Darkness truth will always overcome
[2:20:59] ignorance oh give the Lord some
[2:21:01] [Applause]
[2:21:04] Praises let me continue
[2:21:06] here the activities of the
[2:21:09] enemy has intensified against the body
[2:21:12] of
[2:21:13] Christ two
[2:21:16] forces two
[2:21:18] kingdoms and the human being
[2:21:21] are at the intersection of this
[2:21:24] battle remember this battle did not
[2:21:26] start on Earth but we are in the middle
[2:21:28] of
[2:21:29] it God want you and the devil want
[2:21:37] you you are a
[2:21:41] Target 40% say
[2:21:44] Amen let me say it again so you wouldn't
[2:21:47] miss who we're talking to you are a
[2:21:51] Target of the
[2:21:59] enemy two Realms of
[2:22:02] authority two
[2:22:04] forces two kingdoms the Kingdom of Light
[2:22:08] versus the kingdom of darkness the
[2:22:11] kingdom of righteousness versus the
[2:22:13] kingdom of
[2:22:14] wickedness Jesus said he that is not
[2:22:16] with me is against me who is with me
[2:22:19] with me is the word
[2:22:21] you cannot be neutral you either with
[2:22:24] the word or you're not with the
[2:22:26] word I a sure I a no no no no no you're
[2:22:29] a liar there is no neutrality he said
[2:22:33] that he that is not with
[2:22:38] me is against me there's a line to draw
[2:22:43] and be drawing that line
[2:22:47] today so I don't have no problem who
[2:22:49] want to leave the church I say bye-bye
[2:22:52] see ministers have the heart hurting who
[2:22:54] leave and and who that a child and what
[2:22:56] I don't have that problem
[2:23:00] sorry and Min and and and conation P
[2:23:04] husband to the conation sorry I'm
[2:23:05] husband to and
[2:23:10] Mar not three kind of Believers sorry I
[2:23:13] one wife her name is anir a woman that I
[2:23:18] love one wife
[2:23:21] you understand that so this line that we
[2:23:24] drawing it's a line you know oh
[2:23:30] yeah Jesus said he that not with me is
[2:23:33] against me the Bible exal us Mark those
[2:23:38] who cause division among
[2:23:40] us as I said everybody lights up a room
[2:23:44] some when they come
[2:23:46] in and some when they go
[2:23:48] out but everybody do
[2:23:51] light up a
[2:23:53] room too many of us here we go are
[2:23:57] casual about this
[2:24:00] battle it's a great
[2:24:03] conflict it's a spiritual war that is
[2:24:06] going on it is
[2:24:09] dangerous it is
[2:24:12] deadly many Souls have been
[2:24:15] lost many Souls have this written here
[2:24:18] fell from the collateral damage of
[2:24:20] children
[2:24:20] was and the ministers don't care many
[2:24:25] children are out of fellowship and the
[2:24:28] parents don't care it's the devil upon
[2:24:32] the parents they don't care over the
[2:24:35] years I observed religious Spirits one
[2:24:38] thing I have seen with religious spirit
[2:24:40] they don't care about the family they
[2:24:42] care about their conviction they care
[2:24:44] about what they see in the word and what
[2:24:45] the Lord showing them and they care
[2:24:47] about their dream but it's to hell with
[2:24:49] the family family go to hell do here
[2:24:52] because my attitude is this if I can't
[2:24:54] make it I want my children to make
[2:24:57] [Applause]
[2:25:02] it I have seen it for myself I know
[2:25:05] religious Spirits they think they
[2:25:08] spiritual but they're not they're
[2:25:10] religious and they are the worst Sinners
[2:25:13] to ever encounter because they they are
[2:25:15] message folks and they could quach your
[2:25:17] track
[2:25:18] stuff but they are in hell
[2:25:21] in their Church in the
[2:25:27] message it have sisters who figure
[2:25:29] they're so spiritual they wouldn't even
[2:25:31] listen to their husband no respect and
[2:25:34] the words say know husband love your
[2:25:36] wife wife reference your husband but
[2:25:38] they not giv no reference no respect
[2:25:41] they don't
[2:25:43] care is a religious spirit they can't
[2:25:47] stay home that why they had to come to
[2:25:48] church because that is what the feed off
[2:25:50] of they feed off of that they feeding
[2:25:53] off of what they have woman in is a

[2:44:42] promised to them that love
[2:44:44] him let no man say when he's tempted I
[2:44:47] am tempted of God for God cannot be
[2:44:50] tempted with evil neither tempted he any
[2:44:53] man but every man is tempted
[2:44:56] how how when he is drawn away by his own
[2:45:01] lust that lust is not outside that lust
[2:45:04] is inside drawn away by his own lust and
[2:45:09] enticed when
[2:45:12] lust had conceived L get
[2:45:16] pregnant it bringeth forth sin
[2:45:19] and When sin is finished it bringeth
[2:45:21] forth death so this whole thing about

[2:45:42] have to want to be delivered I have
[2:45:45] encountered people that do not want to
[2:45:47] be delivered they want to be in
[2:45:53] church they want to argue they want to
[2:45:55] fight they don't want Deliverance when
[2:45:58] you want Deliverance you have no time
[2:46:00] with nobody else and their worries it's
[2:46:03] you want Deliverance that woman with the
[2:46:05] blood isue she said if I could just
[2:46:07] Touch the Hem of His G and she pressed
[2:46:10] away and she was delivered oh give the
[2:46:12] Lord some
[2:46:13] Praises
[2:46:15] Hallelujah now James said here now in
[2:46:18] the ified every person is tempted when
[2:46:20] he's drawn away enticed and baited by
[2:46:23] his own evil desire lust and passion and
[2:46:26] then the evil desire when it has
[2:46:28] conceived gives birth to sin and sin
[2:46:30] when it's fully matured bring forth
[2:46:32] death do not be misled my brethren and
[2:46:35] then 1 Corinthians 10 oh we going
