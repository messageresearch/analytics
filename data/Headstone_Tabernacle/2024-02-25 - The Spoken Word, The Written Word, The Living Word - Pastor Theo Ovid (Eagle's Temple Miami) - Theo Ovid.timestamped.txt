[53:03] 1 in the beginning was the word and the
[53:06] Word was with God and the Word was
[53:13] God the same was in the beginning with
[53:19] God all things were made by him and
[53:22] without him was not anything made that
[53:24] was made
[53:31] in him was life and the life was the
[53:33] light of
[53:36] men we want to go down to verse
[53:39] 11 he came unto his own and his own
[53:42] receive him
[53:46] not but as many as receive him to them
[53:49] give you power to become the sons of God
[53:51] even to them that believe on his
[53:54] name
[54:00] which were born not of blood nor of the
[54:02] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[54:03] but of
[54:08] God and the Word was made flesh and
[54:11] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[54:13] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[54:16] father full of grace and
[54:24] truth
[54:27] John
[54:31] 5:36 Jesus
[54:33] speaks but I have a greater witness than
[54:36] that of John for The Works which the
[54:38] father had given me to finish the same
[54:41] works that I do bear witness of me that
[54:44] the father had sent
[54:54] me
[54:57] and the father himself which had sent me
[54:59] had borne witness of me ye have neither
[55:02] heard his voice at any time nor seen his
[55:11] shape and he have not his word abiding
[55:14] in you for whom he had sent him you
[55:17] believe
[55:22] not search the scriptures for in them
[55:26] you think you have e a life but they are
[55:28] they which testify of
[55:37] me and you will not come to me that you
[55:39] might have
[55:43] life and our last
[55:46] scripture from Luke 4 reading verse
[55:51] [Music]
[55:52] 16s and he came to Nazareth where he had
[55:55] been brought up and as his custom was he
[55:57] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[55:59] day and stood up for to
[56:10] read and it was delivered unto him the
[56:12] book of the prophet isas and when he had
[56:14] opened the book he found the place where
[56:17] it was
[56:23] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[56:26] me because he has anointed me to preach
[56:28] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[56:30] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[56:31] Deliverance to the captives the
[56:33] recovering of the sight of the blind to
[56:35] set at Liberty them that are
[56:41] bruised to preach the acceptable year of
[56:43] the
[56:47] Lord and he closed the book and he give
[56:49] it again to the minister and sat down
[56:51] and the eyes of all them that were the
[56:53] synagogue were fastened on him
[57:11] and he began to say unto them this day
[57:14] this scripture is fulfilling your
[57:19] ear may God bless his word you may be

[57:32] morning we here to Worship the
[57:35] Lord and that's what God wants he wants
[57:37] his people to worship
[57:39] him that is what makes him God object of
[57:44] worship I have a title this
[57:46] morning the spoken
[57:49] word the written
[57:52] word The Living Word that's the title
[57:55] this morning the spoken
[57:57] word the written
[58:00] word The Living
[58:02] Word I have an
[58:04] inspiration a live
[58:07] voice the Thunder that shakes the
[58:11] devil a live
[58:13] voice Thunder that shakes the
[58:16] devil
[58:18] okay now before we get into that just
[58:22] want to feel to share this with you
[58:25] and brother Bram was talking about a
[58:28] woman who felt that she was about to
[58:31] die and he was speaking to
[58:34] her he said I want you to do
[58:38] this and this is to show you it will
[58:41] take your individual
[58:44] Faith so he was saying this I want you
[58:48] to do
[58:49] this you are short to
[58:52] die if you remain in the condition you
[58:54] are
[58:56] now you can't live but a little
[59:00] while even your doctor knows
[59:03] that now you have got to do this
[59:07] lady you have got to get above
[59:12] that your way of
[59:15] thinking you are down
[59:17] here thinking that you are
[59:20] going but you have got to rise up
[59:23] here where you think you're going to
[59:27] stay you have got to get above
[59:30] it as a man think it in his
[59:33] heart so is he but if you want to call
[59:37] it
[59:39] psychology but it is whatever you want
[59:41] to
[59:42] say it's the
[59:45] truth the thing of it is you can't come
[59:49] up
[59:50] here unless you got faith in something
[59:53] that will bring you here
[59:56] as the lepers said in the
[59:59] gate why do we sit here till we
[1:00:03] die if we go in the city we will
[1:00:06] die if we stay here we will
[1:00:08] die if we go to the Samaran they will
[1:00:11] kill
[1:00:12] us and you know what they did they went
[1:00:16] to the enemy
[1:00:17] camp and save themselves so but Bram is
[1:00:22] speaking to this lady now you are not
[1:00:25] invited to go to the enemy's
[1:00:28] Camp you invited to the father's
[1:00:32] house he is waiting for
[1:00:35] you so he is ministering to this
[1:00:39] woman and he
[1:00:42] said will you
[1:00:45] believe Lady it's your
[1:00:48] life as his
[1:00:50] Prophet I can tell you what started it
[1:00:55] and it just turns black in front of
[1:00:58] me oh this is the part I want to get
[1:01:01] it's lay according to your
[1:01:05] faith I can't have faith for
[1:01:09] you no more than just as long as my gift
[1:01:12] will carry what I'm talking
[1:01:17] about but it takes your individual
[1:01:20] Faith like anyone
[1:01:23] else so if if you have to get anything
[1:01:25] from God this
[1:01:27] morning it will take your individual
[1:01:30] faith that you could raise
[1:01:33] up whatever condition you're in this
[1:01:36] morning you can raise
[1:01:39] up above whatever condition you are in
[1:01:42] this
[1:01:44] morning the devil is a
[1:01:47] liar how do we
[1:01:49] know every time he open his
[1:01:52] mouth he's a lying this morning
[1:01:55] you can be
[1:01:57] sealed you can be
[1:01:59] healed you can be
[1:02:01] delivered you can be
[1:02:03] restored you can be
[1:02:06] forgiven you can get that
[1:02:08] breakthrough you can break off from
[1:02:10] whever you
[1:02:11] are hallelujah hallelujah you can go
[1:02:14] free this
[1:02:16] morning oh glory to God hallelujah
[1:02:19] hallelujah praise God so then M said you
[1:02:24] must throw aside everything and grind
[1:02:26] into
[1:02:28] it
[1:02:31] believe God to make that evil leave
[1:02:35] you and it will be gone from
[1:02:38] you it'll rise up you will rise up in
[1:02:41] strength I have seen big strong healthy
[1:02:45] women and eat up with
[1:02:48] cancer and they are now
[1:02:51] living because they had faith in God
[1:02:54] so when the devil want to cut you off
[1:02:59] prematurely when the devil want to cut
[1:03:02] you off before your
[1:03:04] time your Fai could back him
[1:03:08] up your faith could push him
[1:03:11] back and I'm not just talking about
[1:03:15] death the devil try to cut out all your
[1:03:20] blessings the devil want to close doors
[1:03:23] for you
[1:03:25] but your fa this
[1:03:27] morning could open up those
[1:03:29] door Oh Glory to God what are you saying

[1:03:48] it regard You Must
[1:03:50] Believe regardless of
[1:03:53] anything you never go by your
[1:03:56] feeling never go by your
[1:03:59] feeling remember Friday
[1:04:01] night God Is Not A
[1:04:03] Feeling God is the word God is Not
[1:04:08] tears God is the
[1:04:10] word God is not I am

[1:04:15] word Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[1:04:19] hallelujah hallelujah listen to this he
[1:04:22] began to pray say Lord Jesus bless this
[1:04:26] woman who I lay hands on and I say to
[1:04:30] this evil
[1:04:31] spirit you are
[1:04:33] exposed God rebuke thee in the name of

[1:05:22] Faith now here this
[1:05:25] they have to leave in the
[1:05:28] presence in the presence and that's why
[1:05:31] the
[1:05:32] devil has fought Worship in the church
[1:05:35] for
[1:05:36] years that's why the
[1:05:38] devil fought creating an
[1:05:42] atmosphere because the devil have to
[1:05:46] leave in presence but when the devil
[1:05:50] leaves and you walk out those
[1:05:53] doors Faith wow is what will keep him
[1:05:56] off Give the Lord some
[1:05:59] Praises but the devil he wants to hold
[1:06:02] on to you with cancer with humor with
[1:06:07] sickness with diabetes but God want to
[1:06:11] heal you his desire is for you to be
[1:06:15] healed you to be free to worship God the
[1:06:20] beauty of Holiness oh give the Lord some
[1:06:23] praises
[1:06:24] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:26] hallelujah Glory all right okay let's go
[1:06:31] the scripture we
[1:06:33] read in the beginning was the word the
[1:06:36] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:06:40] but then the Bible went on to
[1:06:41] say and the word became flesh and dwell
[1:06:46] Among
[1:06:47] Us brother Bram the very substance of
[1:06:52] God was made flesh and dwell Among
[1:06:56] Us the great spirit of God which no man
[1:07:00] could
[1:07:02] approach which no man had
[1:07:04] seen was no Tabernacle in
[1:07:08] flesh that's why Jesus told them you
[1:07:11] have not seen his
[1:07:13] form heard his voice search the
[1:07:17] scriptures in other words search the
[1:07:20] written
[1:07:22] words
[1:07:24] search the
[1:07:26] Scrolls they testify of
[1:07:29] me now the
[1:07:31] reason we have
[1:07:33] Scriptures it is because it come from
[1:07:35] the spoken
[1:07:37] word and the spoken word came because
[1:07:42] when the people said don't let Moses
[1:07:46] speak let God
[1:07:48] speak because Thunders and lightning was
[1:07:50] on the
[1:07:52] mountain God say okay okay I'm going to
[1:07:55] Veil myself in
[1:07:57] men I'm going to send
[1:07:59] prophets and there will be my
[1:08:02] mie so Jesus quoted the
[1:08:05] Bible when he told the
[1:08:07] devil man shall live by PR
[1:08:10] the but by every word which
[1:08:14] proceed out of the mouth of God so the
[1:08:18] spoken
[1:08:19] word The Original
[1:08:21] Seed came from the mouth of
[1:08:25] By His prophets and the spoken
[1:08:28] word became the written
[1:08:31] word which is the
[1:08:33] scriptures and the word is
[1:08:36] God the spoken word is God and the WR
[1:08:40] word is God and the written
[1:08:43] word is God in
[1:08:46] print if you want to
[1:08:48] know God's
[1:08:50] will God's
[1:08:52] purpose God's intent for your
[1:08:55] life you can find it in the
[1:08:58] scriptures and Jesus he told them search
[1:09:03] the
[1:09:04] courtes search the
[1:09:06] scriptures search your
[1:09:09] schols they and day that testify of
[1:09:13] me glory to God so the spoken
[1:09:17] word became the written
[1:09:19] word and this written word is to become
[1:09:23] the Living
[1:09:24] Word glory to God do you
[1:09:27] see
[1:09:29] objective is not for it to remain spoken
[1:09:33] with God's
[1:09:35] objective is not to be just written
[1:09:38] with but God's
[1:09:40] objective is for that word to become

[1:10:01] Revelation only by
[1:10:03] revelation of the words through the
[1:10:06] prophet God declares his
[1:10:09] word and that word
[1:10:12] declar is taken from a Greek root
[1:10:16] word which means to thoroughly
[1:10:22] explain and made
[1:10:24] clear you know I he pastors and
[1:10:28] preachers makes things so
[1:10:30] complex but brother Bram said from
[1:10:34] Genesis to
[1:10:35] Revelation could be described in three
[1:10:38] words word made
[1:10:41] flesh God was so
[1:10:44] mysterious he was so
[1:10:46] mysterious he wanted to simplify
[1:10:49] himself because we cannot
[1:10:52] understand who he is and how he lives so
[1:10:56] he had to simplify
[1:10:58] himself so all that
[1:11:01] complexity come down in
[1:11:03] Simplicity when the word became flesh so
[1:11:08] the Bible say without
[1:11:11] controversy without
[1:11:13] argument great is the mystery of
[1:11:16] godliness Oh Glory to God do you believe

[1:17:18] this explanation about that in the
[1:17:21] beginning was
[1:17:24] hallelujah hallelujah the word came in
[1:17:26] the
[1:17:26] beginning let's go right with me but
[1:17:29] before the
[1:17:30] beginning Spirit
[1:17:34] Hallelujah
[1:17:35] am Hallelujah hallu so in the beginning
[1:17:40] was the word but before the beginning
[1:17:43] was thoughts was
[1:17:46] mind was
[1:17:48] Elohim was
[1:17:50] Intelligence was the spirit
[1:17:53] before there was a
[1:17:55] moon before there was a
[1:17:57] star before there was a
[1:18:00] m you were in his
[1:18:03] stinking before the word Oh Glory to
[1:18:07] God you were in his thoughts because the
[1:18:12] devil he came in the
[1:18:14] beginning he was created in the
[1:18:18] beginning but you was before the
[1:18:21] beginning
[1:18:30] was in
[1:18:37] God's
[1:18:43] God so this
[1:18:45] morning you have
[1:18:48] senority over the devil he only come in
[1:18:51] the beginning
[1:18:54] you were before the
[1:18:55] beginning you are
[1:18:58] attribute son of
[1:19:01] thinking
[1:19:03] Hallelujah a gene
[1:19:05] thought in the mind of
[1:19:07] God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:11] hallelujah glory to God hallelujah
[1:19:14] hallelujah all right let's
[1:19:16] go
[1:19:18] Jesus was upon the Earth he said beli th
[1:19:22] not
[1:19:23] I'm in my
[1:19:25] father and the
[1:19:27] father I speak unto
[1:19:29] you I speak not of
[1:19:31] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[1:19:35] me he d The
[1:19:37] Works you say here it
[1:19:40] is evidently set
[1:19:43] forth the perfect manifestation of
[1:19:47] God in the son was
[1:19:51] by the IND dwell in
[1:19:54] spirit
[1:19:56] manifested in word and
[1:20:01] words so Jesus wasn't just talking
[1:20:05] Mysteries he was bringing
[1:20:08] words and
[1:20:10] works so Paul said it this
[1:20:12] way I came to you not with enticing
[1:20:17] words of man's
[1:20:20] Wisdom that your faith your faith may
[1:20:24] not rest on the wisdom of
[1:20:27] man but in the power of God so he was
[1:20:32] identifying that this
[1:20:34] gospel is not word only which is
[1:20:38] text or spoken word or written word but
[1:20:44] gospel is power and
[1:20:48] demonstration the Lord sh glory to God
[1:20:53] so the word the prophet said the word is
[1:20:58] a seed of the
[1:20:59] Gospel Oh Glory to God do you get that
[1:21:04] this written
[1:21:05] word spoken word is a seed of the Gospel
[1:21:11] but the gospel when it is preached it is
[1:21:15] preached with
[1:21:16] power and
[1:21:19] demonstration God the Bible say
[1:21:23] the Lord himself the Lord
[1:21:26] himself everywhere with
[1:21:29] them confirming the word with signs
[1:21:33] follow and these signs shall follow them
[1:21:38] not you follow sign
[1:21:41] but following you wherever you go signs
[1:21:46] following Miracles follow wherever you
[1:21:50] go these
[1:21:58] do you believe it are you
[1:22:04] beli them
[1:22:08] believe glory to God hallelujah
[1:22:12] hallelujah listen to this so the perfect
[1:22:15] manif
[1:22:17] of is when the
[1:22:19] son with the indwelling spirit
[1:22:24] listen we not talk about no
[1:22:27] pastor this is Jesus we talking
[1:22:30] about this is a son revealing the
[1:22:34] father manifesting in word and
[1:22:38] words
[1:22:40] prophecy when the
[1:22:42] bride are you ready I'm talking about
[1:22:45] you know so you're supposed to get
[1:22:48] excited if you're a church member you
[1:22:49] don't
[1:22:50] have this is for
[1:22:53] church members don't have to say Amen
[1:22:55] church members don't have to say Amen
[1:22:58] this is for
[1:22:59] the when the bride will get back to
[1:23:04] being a word
[1:23:06] bride she will
[1:23:08] produce the very works that
[1:23:13] [Applause]
[1:23:15] Jesus give the Lord some
[1:23:19] PR a prophecy handing over
[1:23:24] you that you will
[1:23:26] become a
[1:23:28] word and when you become that word bride
[1:23:33] the very word the very
[1:23:36] words that Jesus did will be done by you
[1:23:40] the prophet said the word is
[1:23:44] God the spirit is God they are all one
[1:23:49] one cannot work apart from other so the
[1:23:53] word is a conductor of the
[1:23:56] spirit so once we get the word line
[1:24:00] up Holy Spirit coming through the
[1:24:04] word then the bride will become the word
[1:24:09] and the spirit will come upon the bride
[1:24:12] and the spirit and the bride will say
[1:24:16] come the spirit itself going to ride the
[1:24:20] bride Jesus
[1:24:23] he never tell anybody who
[1:24:25] he from 12 to
[1:24:28] 1 for 18 years he's going to the
[1:24:33] temple caring them the own

[1:33:26] said the
[1:33:27] world not receive the Holy
[1:33:29] Ghost neither could they receive the

[1:33:37] one if you have the Holy
[1:33:40] Spirit as the prophets the word will
[1:33:43] come to
[1:33:46] you you mean the W comes to the

[1:34:31] brother here again we find the word
[1:34:36] coming because the spirit of God in John
[1:34:41] 16 how be it when he the spirit of Truth
[1:34:48] is so truth is not just
[1:34:52] text word it has the spirit of
[1:34:56] trth because the
[1:34:58] truth is a person I am the way the truth
[1:35:05] and the life so the truth is more than
[1:35:08] t a man could tell his wife I love you
[1:35:13] but that's words you understand
[1:35:16] that his heart and the spirit is not
[1:35:20] dear to back up these words I love you I
[1:35:26] talk that is words remember the prophet
[1:35:30] talk about a
[1:35:31] man kiss his wife all the neighbor kiss
[1:35:35] his

[1:38:59] Ghost the spirit bringing the word of
[1:39:03] Prophecy hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:06] hallelujah hallelu now the proof of the
[1:39:10] indwelling
[1:39:12] spirit was to acknowledge and
[1:39:16] follow what God's Prophet get for
[1:39:19] the the evidence
[1:39:22] of a spiritful
[1:39:24] Christian is not to produce the
[1:39:27] truth but to receive the
[1:39:30] truth to believe it and Obey
[1:39:34] it have you
[1:39:36] noticed in Revelation
[1:39:39] 2217 the spirit and the bright say
[1:39:42] come let him hear it say
[1:39:46] come
[1:39:47] see the bride speaks
[1:39:51] the same word as does the
[1:39:55] spirit she is a word
[1:39:57] bride proven she has the
[1:39:59] spirit so that's why the prophet said
[1:40:03] the spirit the prophet and the bride
[1:40:07] will say the same thing oh Blessed Be of
[1:40:10] the Lord glory to God so watch this now
[1:40:15] before the beginning Elohim Spirit
[1:40:19] thinking
[1:40:21] thoughts in the beginning the word the
[1:40:26] logos the expression of el
[1:40:28] thought the
[1:40:30] theophany The Living Word the back part
[1:40:33] of the
[1:40:35] man that mes
[1:40:38] s so watch now so the word of the Lord
[1:40:43] spoken word came to Jeremiah and
[1:40:47] Isaiah that was the spoken word and then
[1:40:51] the word came un
[1:40:53] Jeremiah
[1:40:54] next the written word God in print and
[1:40:59] that's why Jesus told them s the
[1:41:02] scriptures but then he said as
[1:41:05] powerful the
[1:41:08] scriptures them you think you have
[1:41:12] eternal
[1:41:13] life but then Jesus said
[1:41:15] this you would not come to
[1:41:17] me to get life so he was tell them you
[1:41:22] have the books you have the tapes you
[1:41:25] think you have life but I am the Living
[1:41:27] Word because in him was
[1:41:30] life and the life was the light of men
[1:41:33] so he was saying you have the text you
[1:41:37] have the written word but you are not
[1:41:39] coming to The Living Word that you might
[1:41:42] have life oh give the Lord some
[1:41:45] Praises now watch this the Rich Young
[1:41:49] Ruler
[1:41:51] that young man that Jesus
[1:41:53] loved he came to Jesus good Master what
[1:41:58] shall I
[1:42:01] do etal
[1:42:03] life and Jesus give him the text the
[1:42:07] written word of your
[1:42:10] neighbor the
[1:42:12] Commandments that's written and the guy
[1:42:16] said all these things have I kept
[1:42:21] for my
[1:42:22] youth what lack I
[1:42:25] yet what am I
[1:42:27] missing Jesus the word a discerner going
[1:42:32] down behind
[1:42:34] his seeing into his heart seeing the
[1:42:37] lust for
[1:42:38] money seeing how he doesn't share don't
[1:42:42] give he said here
[1:42:44] what to get that demon off
[1:42:47] you give all sell all that you have
[1:42:52] that spirit will leave
[1:42:55] you and the Bible
[1:42:57] said young man walk
[1:43:00] s the Bible said Jesus loved him but you
[1:43:04] see he was keeping
[1:43:07] text but the heart didn't have the text
[1:43:10] in
[1:43:11] it the word wasn't
[1:43:13] living the word wasn't
[1:43:16] alive because Jesus didn't want him to
[1:43:19] lose everything he wanted to get rid of
[1:43:22] that
[1:43:23] demon of
[1:43:26] selfishness and not
[1:43:28] given compare that man to Cornelius and
[1:43:33] Cornelius was a man a gentile giv giving
[1:43:39] always helping somebody and God bless
[1:43:44] Cornelius is given in so much you had to
[1:43:48] send for
[1:43:49] Peter at that time Peter was the Living
[1:43:57] Word Peter who walk with
[1:43:59] Jesus under Jesus
[1:44:01] ministry preaching for three and a half
[1:44:04] years the Capstone of that
[1:44:07] Ministry was Peter deny
[1:44:11] Christ because the
[1:44:13] comforter wasn't yet in
[1:44:16] him so when they see Jesus on the
[1:44:19] cross good oh if my master could get
[1:44:23] Li if they could kill him they will kill
[1:44:25] me
[1:44:26] too I sign up for
[1:44:29] that I sign up for
[1:44:31] that they say yeah you
[1:44:36] temp Peter deny he was in
[1:44:39] service he Deni Christ three
[1:44:41] times he
[1:44:43] wept but Jesus told him already the
[1:44:46] devil want to sift you like
[1:44:49] wheat but I
[1:44:52] pray that your
[1:44:54] faith fail not but after you are
[1:44:58] converted strengthen the Breen so Peter
[1:45:02] knew he was a
[1:45:04] seed though he failed though he fell he
[1:45:08] knew he was a son so when the Holy Ghost
[1:45:13] came upon him in the upper room change
[1:45:17] man all
[1:45:18] together oh glory to God
[1:45:21] when Cornelius sent for Peter and Peter
[1:45:25] to
[1:45:26] testify what the prophet
[1:45:28] says Oh Glory to God Peter was in the
[1:45:32] body and life can only come from the
[1:45:37] body so why Peter was speaking the word
[1:45:42] the Holy Ghost fell and F
[1:45:47] Cornelius and he wasn't even
[1:45:49] baptized come to one chch
[1:45:52] service but his heart was right his
[1:45:55] heart was right if your heart is
[1:45:58] right God knows what going to
[1:46:01] happen oh glory to God
[1:46:05] hallelujah so we have the
[1:46:08] scriptures the spoken
[1:46:10] word living word amen then back to the
[1:46:15] spirit El the object of the
[1:46:19] Gospel is to bring you to become the
[1:46:23] Living
[1:46:24] Word if you become the Living
[1:46:26] Word you can found you can close the
[1:46:30] book you can say the
[1:46:32] spirit is upon me isn't that right for
[1:46:36] he has anointed me and the bride will
[1:46:39] find the place what place Revelation
[1:46:44] 227 the spirit and the bride do you
[1:46:49] understand scripture that the bride will
[1:46:52] have a voice the spirit coming upon the
[1:46:56] bride will give the bride a voice to say

[1:47:02] ones you unsaved family out there and
[1:47:06] theyed to come through you by the word
[1:47:11] from your mouth God ordained it that way

[1:47:21] Ministry you have a Ministry this last
[1:47:24] chur have a Ministry the ministry is not

[1:47:34] your Fallen
[1:47:38] sister you can sit here the rest have to
[1:47:42] come one day that last name in the book
[1:47:48] will be called then the book of is
[1:47:50] closed that is Judgment his lightning
[1:47:55] his Thunders
[1:47:57] earthquakes going to be
[1:47:59] rocking but the bride going to be ready
[1:48:03] his
[1:48:04] wife had made herself ready Oh Glory to
[1:48:08] God oh glory to God so listen you could
[1:48:12] put a suit on a
[1:48:15] pig you can keep the pig in the
[1:48:18] house have the P like a a
[1:48:23] pet put cologne on that
[1:48:26] pig the pig will behave
[1:48:29] itself as long as it's in the
[1:48:34] house but open the
[1:48:36] door and let that
[1:48:39] pig that pig will forget the
[1:48:42] B that pig will
[1:48:45] forget all the nice carpet in the
[1:48:49] house and go straight for the
[1:48:52] mud you know why it's a
[1:48:55] pig it's a pig a pig is a pig and when
[1:49:00] you have the nature of a pig you would
[1:49:03] live like a
[1:49:04] pig God did make
[1:49:06] you above the
[1:49:08] animals give make you a little L than
[1:49:12] the
[1:49:12] Angels don't live like an
[1:49:15] animal don't act like an animal live
[1:49:18] like God see you a little ler than the
[1:49:21] angel he call it to be a higher
[1:49:25] life and to
[1:49:27] change from that pig nature to the
[1:49:30] nature of a lamb is that right question
[1:49:35] why did Jesus
[1:49:37] choose men who did not know the
[1:49:42] scripture why did Jesus choose
[1:49:44] men who couldn't read or
[1:49:48] write why
[1:49:50] because Jesus
[1:49:53] understood that divine
[1:49:56] revelation by passes the
[1:49:59] mind and comes into the
[1:50:02] heart do you get that Jesus
[1:50:06] understood that divine
[1:50:09] revelation pass the mind and drop down
[1:50:12] into the heart that's why Jesus said who
[1:50:16] do men say I am men is talking about me

[1:50:22] that but who do you say I am you are

[1:56:43] work
[1:56:45] Jacob one after the spirit one after the
[1:56:48] flesh
[1:56:50] then he said
[1:56:51] this these
[1:56:53] men if they pick it
[1:56:55] up and go out with
[1:56:57] it and make more sense to
[1:57:00] it to see talking about I'm only trying
[1:57:03] to lay the
[1:57:05] seed he's prophesying about
[1:57:08] men coming
[1:57:10] after if these men go out with it you
[1:57:14] can make more sense to
[1:57:18] it people stop there and they trying to
[1:57:22] explain way the prophet
[1:57:24] message that is not where it
[1:57:26] stops if they can make more
[1:57:29] sense to bring it to a

[2:00:14] morning is a prophecy of real reing to
[2:00:19] come to manifest your
[2:00:21] SE Oh Glory to God now watch this but
[2:00:25] the word of God has been sown
[2:00:29] also are you ready Church prophecy and
[2:00:33] when the spirit of God begins to
[2:00:38] fall the word of God would live in the
[2:00:45] people so right now you are comforted
[2:00:50] prom word you are comforted by what God
[2:00:54] promised note when Elohim came to
[2:00:59] Abraham he didn't manifest anything
[2:01:02] yet said I come to encourage you I come
[2:01:05] to tell you that I will return you're
[2:01:08] whole for 25
[2:01:10] years I come to tell
[2:01:13] you it's not long again that you'll be
[2:01:17] changed you Sarah going to be
[2:01:20] changed to produce that son isn't that
[2:01:24] right so the prophet said it here now
[2:01:27] the word of God has been
[2:01:29] shown this is not
[2:01:31] if this is when when the spirit of God
[2:01:36] begins to fall the word will live in the
[2:01:40] people and that false
[2:01:43] bride the solar birth
[2:01:45] right will reap what a confederation of
[2:01:51] churches but the
[2:01:53] word that have been sown into the
[2:01:56] people's heart would reap UPR for Jesus
[2:02:00] Christ so the Council of
[2:02:02] churches is also waiting for
[2:02:06] rain because the cons of
[2:02:09] churches was is a
[2:02:11] seed do you understand all the seeds
[2:02:15] Angel
[2:02:17] sinking
[2:02:19] what's going on in
[2:02:21] Rome that's a seed water have to fall on
[2:02:24] every
[2:02:25] seed to bring it to
[2:02:28] pass all right let me head the home
[2:02:30] stretch here now brother BR the biggest
[2:02:34] part of our
[2:02:35] faith is mental FEI by hearing the word
[2:02:40] it brings us into a mental recognition
[2:02:42] of
[2:02:43] God when the Holy Spirit comes in it
[2:02:48] into a Godly
[2:02:49] [Music]
[2:02:51] and it becomes a spiritual
[2:02:54] Revelation now the faith that Jesus was
[2:02:57] speaking about he he my words and
[2:03:01] believe doesn't come from intellectual
[2:03:04] faith it comes from a born again
[2:03:07] experience is a man
[2:03:09] heart intellectual Faith reason with
[2:03:13] God's
[2:03:15] word but a born again
[2:03:17] experience from the heart but say it's
[2:03:21] God will is
[2:03:23] right we have gotten
[2:03:25] away from the real old time
[2:03:29] experience of receiving the Holy
[2:03:31] Spirit It Isn't So Much
[2:03:34] intellectual but something that happened
[2:03:36] down
[2:03:37] here that changed that
[2:03:40] man it changed his
[2:03:42] motives it changes ideas it changes
[2:03:47] life Romans 10 10
[2:03:50] 17 so then Faith come by
[2:03:52] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[2:03:56] we know that one right come by hearing
[2:03:59] and hearing by the word of God but here
[2:04:01] what the prophet said you and
[2:04:04] usually people who have faith are people
[2:04:08] who have
[2:04:09] experience experience brings
[2:04:12] faith God have to give
[2:04:15] experience for fa to come
[2:04:17] alive that's what to
[2:04:20] David God gave him an
[2:04:22] experience with the lion private

[2:11:57] skip only one thing is
[2:12:00] needful return to
[2:12:02] Christ looking to

[2:12:25] power influence and
[2:12:28] control there are only there's only one
[2:12:30] life that's Christ but death comes to us
[2:12:35] in Thousand
[2:12:37] form now watch this here Paul when he
[2:12:42] came face to face with that
[2:12:44] word it
[2:12:47] quickened come to
[2:12:49] life Moses never came to
[2:12:53] life until the light struck
[2:12:55] him so
[2:12:59] Moses he was taught by his
[2:13:02] mother Moses he had the spoken
[2:13:06] word from his mother's mouth that he's a
[2:13:09] special
[2:13:11] child and he is to be
[2:13:14] delivered he took it
[2:13:16] intellectually one man and run out of
[2:13:21] Egypt and never look at Egyptian
[2:13:25] Pap for 40 years you don't want text
[2:13:28] WhatsApp Facebook nothing from
[2:13:30] egyp nothing from
[2:13:32] Egypt and God wait him
[2:13:34] out until he's
[2:13:37] relaxed he has a wife he has a family
[2:13:41] he's buying
[2:13:42] furniture and one day when he about to
[2:13:46] buy his fresh furniture
[2:13:49] and his wife waiting for
[2:13:51] furniture he saw fire in the
[2:13:53] mountain where we know the story when
[2:13:56] fire hit Moses like
[2:13:58] that five minutes in the presence of
[2:14:02] that fire taught Moses more than all the
[2:14:06] years he was in
[2:14:08] Egypt and for our young
[2:14:11] people all young people 5 minutes in the
[2:14:15] presence of that
[2:14:16] fire
[2:14:19] everyone it will change your walk it
[2:14:21] will change your talk it wouldn't be
[2:14:24] resting on mommy's
[2:14:26] experience's
[2:14:28] experience they will have their own
[2:14:31] experience when Moses spoke back and he
[2:14:34] spoke back to Moses it brought his SE to
[2:14:39] lifeam said this
[2:14:41] prophecy the body is waiting which is
[2:14:45] the word waiting for the life
[2:14:48] which is the spirit to confirm it or
[2:14:52] making
[2:14:53] alive no other life will work in
[2:14:56] her she can't come to
[2:14:59] life no other way you sit in this
[2:15:03] Tabernacle you have listened to tapes
[2:15:05] I'm still reading and yet the spirit has
[2:15:09] never quickened you till you can come
[2:15:11] and follow the word of
[2:15:13] God you wom and Men could obey every
[2:15:16] word so the
[2:15:19] spirit
[2:15:21] correctly brings you into
[2:15:25] obedience I'm not talking about coming
[2:15:27] to church
[2:15:28] now anybody can come to
[2:15:30] church but when the spirit bring the
[2:15:33] word to you it's to bring you into
[2:15:37] obedience to his will and purpose for
[2:15:39] your
[2:15:40] life to God amen amen amen hallelujah
[2:15:44] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh

[2:15:52] people and today the people that have
[2:15:56] veiled are the same things they are
[2:15:59] written
[2:16:01] Epistles
[2:16:03] Epistles that have been written and that
[2:16:06] makes you the Living Word so here the
[2:16:10] prophecy you have got to get these are
[2:16:14] will words now you have got to get the
[2:16:16] Living Word in you
[2:16:19] to have the Living God in
[2:16:20] you because the word here is
[2:16:24] God when it is made flesh in you and
[2:16:29] made spirit and life in
[2:16:31] you when it goes into your
[2:16:34] flesh and your
[2:16:36] faith and becomes life so this word have
[2:16:41] to go in your
[2:16:42] flesh and your faith and it becomes life
[2:16:47] Oh Glory to God then you are God's
[2:16:50] living
[2:16:52] word representative
[2:16:55] the so the Bible is manifested
[2:16:59] again like in the early days of
[2:17:02] Christ are you church because you
[2:17:06] are a predestinated
[2:17:09] seed just like Christ
[2:17:11] was and when the rain
[2:17:13] falls on the seed the life will produce
[2:17:19] when the Holy Spirit fall so the main
[2:17:23] thing make
[2:17:25] sure that seed is in
[2:17:27] you then the prophet said these
[2:17:31] disciples 120 of them almost done they
[2:17:34] called themselves into the upper room
[2:17:38] these seeds the word the word was laying
[2:17:42] there without life in

[2:17:53] afraid they were afraid under a promise
[2:17:57] but afraid under a promise but they
[2:18:00] scared of this and scared of that then
[2:18:02] all of a sudden the song from Heaven as

[2:18:40] individual individ never in a group no
[2:18:44] group

[2:18:50] identification is with an
[2:18:53] individual you get that there be two in
[2:18:55] a
[2:18:56] bed one
[2:18:58] taken
[2:19:01] Hallelujah this is
[2:19:03] serious don't just take it for granted

[2:19:17] to it
[2:19:19] my oh my oh
[2:19:21] my just let me SK all here
[2:19:24] now the voice of the
[2:19:27] throne Before the Throne was Seven Stars
[2:19:30] not one voice
[2:19:31] voices what was it God speaking to the
[2:19:35] church reflecting
[2:19:37] himself through the seven
[2:19:39] spirits M come
[2:19:42] please when the true anointed of God
[2:19:46] speaks
[2:19:48] it's the voice of
[2:19:49] God so I'm not your pastor your pastor
[2:19:52] is
[2:19:54] brother but guess what any man of God
[2:19:58] that comes here truly
[2:20:00] anointed and speaks by the unction of
[2:20:03] God that is God
