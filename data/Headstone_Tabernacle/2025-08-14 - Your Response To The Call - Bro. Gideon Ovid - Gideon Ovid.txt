He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. May God add blessing to the reading of his word.

If not for grace, just give the Lord a hand of praise. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; You're glad to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. While you're standing, if you could open your Bibles to a short portion of scripture, reading from the book of Acts, chapter 2, verse 38. Thank you, musicians. And it says, "Then Peter said unto them, repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." you just bow our heads as we open on a word of prayer. Oh heavenly father, we thank you so much for this opportunity to gather together this evening, Lord. Lord, we pray that you will have your perfect will over this service, every word that is spoken, Lord. Lord, every thought that is shared, Lord, I pray that you would speak lip to air to your people tonight. I pray that you'll anoint my words, Lord. An anoint this message tonight, Lord. take me out of the way and Lord meet the needs of your people wherever they are Lord. Those connected on the internet, I pray that you give them a special touch that your presence would pour among your people, Lord. That lives be changed and transformed that the sick will be healed, Lord, and the the the the bound will be set free, Lord. Lord, that shackles will be broken tonight, Lord. Lord, I pray that you have your perfect will in and through our lives. Bless the reading of your word, Lord. Lord, I pray that you would open it to our hearts, Lord. Lord, I pray that you would Lord, just anoint our minds, our bodies, our souls, Lord, so we could receive from you tonight. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a time we've had in his presence. &gt;&gt; Coming out of the convention and and the services we've had, who was blessed by the service on Sunday? &gt;&gt; What a message. Amen. Amen. And this evening just for a title uh your response to the call for an inspiration will you be ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we're going to chat a little bit tonight about your response to the call. As we read that scripture there and in verse 39 of Acts chapter 2, it says, "For the promise is unto you and to your children." &gt;&gt; Amen. and to all that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, one thing is clear there that God is calling you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he isn't now calling you &gt;&gt; because he chose you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; It says, "Moreover, whom he did predestinate, then he also called." &gt;&gt; And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified. So, he's calling tonight. &gt;&gt; He's called you before the foundation of the world, but he's sending you a reminder tonight &gt;&gt; about his purpose for your life. &gt;&gt; He calls when he's ready to call. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't always call the way you expect him to. He doesn't call because you think it's convenient for him to do so. But he doesn't have to wait until you're ready. &gt;&gt; He calls because he wants to. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he could call whoever he want, &gt;&gt; how he want, when he want, where he want. &gt;&gt; You don't dictate the ability of him to call you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If that was the case, Lazarus would not have died. &gt;&gt; Because they reach out to him and he said, you know what? I will still carry a little bit. &gt;&gt; Your call is not going to pull him. &gt;&gt; Your faith can, &gt;&gt; but he will come when he's ready. When he's ready to show up and respond, he will come and call upon you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you hear me tonight, &gt;&gt; but the main line to Jesus is always active. &gt;&gt; You could call him anytime, but it's up to him to respond. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You could reach out any time, but it's up to him to respond to you. &gt;&gt; You could cry out to him anytime, &gt;&gt; but it's his prerogative to respond. The children of Israel were in bondage for 400 years. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; They cried. &gt;&gt; Yes. They pleaded. Yes. &gt;&gt; They sacrificed. They fasted. They prayed. &gt;&gt; He heard them, you know, &gt;&gt; but he chose when he wanted to respond to that call. &gt;&gt; And tonight, he's calling you. And it's important that you respond to his call &gt;&gt; because it's on his terms. &gt;&gt; It's not because of us, &gt;&gt; but we are obligated to respond to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. From time to time, your call might drop because your faith might waver a little bit. &gt;&gt; Your relationship might be a little shaky &gt;&gt; and it seems as if he not hearing you. &gt;&gt; The problem is not him. &gt;&gt; The problem is you. &gt;&gt; The problem is your connection. &gt;&gt; His line is always working. &gt;&gt; He don't need to top it up. &gt;&gt; Trust me. He's moving here, moving there, moving just about everywhere. &gt;&gt; Your faith could pull him tonight. &gt;&gt; Your faith could ensure that you are healed tonight, &gt;&gt; that you are set free tonight, that you are delivered tonight. &gt;&gt; His line is always active. &gt;&gt; Amen. So sometimes it feels like you're not getting through. But the secret is he is never too busy. You know, &gt;&gt; but he is going to answer when he's ready. &gt;&gt; It's not on us. It's on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once you mix that word, once you mix those promises with not faith, he will answer. &gt;&gt; He will respond. &gt;&gt; In a message, why Christ speak? Brother Brandham said, like I've taught many times &gt;&gt; of the little woman at the well, and we know the story. &gt;&gt; She was a woman of what we call illreute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She had five men and the man she was living with wasn't hers. We call her a prostitute. You don't want to be associated with her. You don't want to be seen in public with her. &gt;&gt; You don't want to talk to her. You don't want to go to the well at the same time as she is going because that is what she expressed. That's what the public knew. That's what the world knew. That's what the world saw. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the interesting thing about her is that when the light first struck her when this call went out to her quickly she recognized it cuz there was something there to respond to it. When the deep call it to a deep, there must be a deep somewhere to respond. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what people think about you tonight. It doesn't matter where you were last week. When he's calling you, it's up to you to respond. &gt;&gt; Your response is important to him. &gt;&gt; Your response causes things to happen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what your siblings think and your family think and and and your neighbor and your coworker and your boss. &gt;&gt; The way you respond dictates the way he operates with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he could use you, &gt;&gt; if he could fill you, if he could deliver you tonight, if he could heal you today &gt;&gt; based on your response to his call. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He likes to come and call you when you least expect it. &gt;&gt; I told you it's not on your terms, it's on his terms. &gt;&gt; He likes to interrupt normal living. You know, you go to work and you go back home and you go to church and you go back home and you check your friends and you go back home and you check your family and go back home and it seems normal and routine, part of your culture, part of who you are. He likes to interrupt that. &gt;&gt; So at times he just observes. Oh, okay. I understand. I understand your movements. I want to interrupt that. Like Moses with the burning bush, normal living, but he interrupted it. &gt;&gt; Paul normal living &gt;&gt; persecute the Christians is his mission. interrupted. &gt;&gt; And there are many cases throughout scripture where people have been living their lives in a level of normaly and he chooses to interrupt it &gt;&gt; for his cause. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the book of Luke, he said they eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark, the flood came. So he built the ark and when God called him and say, "Come inside now. That That was it. &gt;&gt; That was it. &gt;&gt; It didn't matter what you thought about him. If you're finally preaching the same thing for 120 years, it really didn't matter at that point. &gt;&gt; It seemed like everything was going routine. &gt;&gt; It was the thing that we are accustomed to. You come to church on Wednesday night and you go back home. Even tonight may seem like a average standard Wednesday night, &gt;&gt; but it's not &gt;&gt; because he likes to come and show up when it seems normal. &gt;&gt; He likes to come calling and knocking when it seems like he's least likely to do that. As a matter of fact, it goes on in verse 28 and says, "Likewise also as it was in the day of Lot. They eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they build it. But the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. &gt;&gt; Essentially, the day that Lot was called out &gt;&gt; and he responded to that call, destruction &gt;&gt; covered the city. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, it was important to be able to respond to that call. &gt;&gt; Now, when God called Lot out, as we know, &gt;&gt; his wife was not ready for the call. That's right. &gt;&gt; This is isn't about about Samson, but it wasn't once more, Lord. She just wanted one more party. &gt;&gt; Just one more fet. &gt;&gt; Just one more good time. Just one more lime. &gt;&gt; Just one more encounter with these friends that she knows she shouldn't be lying with. &gt;&gt; Ju just one more. &gt;&gt; And it cost her everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; That one more &gt;&gt; that one more &gt;&gt; decision to go out. &gt;&gt; That one more was what it took to divide her from what God had appointed for Lot at that point. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know there are people when you drop by them unexpectedly, it's a scary thing for them. shakes them to the very core because they will do everything in their power to delay you. They will tell you, "Hold on, wait right outside. I'm coming." And that is because they want to back up. They want to sort out. They want to clean up. They want to tidy up. They want to put things in the position in which it's supposed to be because they want to make sure that when you walk through that door. &gt;&gt; The impression they give you is that everything is all right, &gt;&gt; that everything is in place, that everything is perfect. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, and it's no surprise that God doesn't operate that way. &gt;&gt; He wants you to be ready whenever he comes. &gt;&gt; You must always be ready. He will stand at the door and knock. But you know what? He not standing there forever. You know &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; He's a gentleman. &gt;&gt; He knock and you waiting and then he gone. &gt;&gt; If you don't respond fast enough, he gone. &gt;&gt; You would have missed it. &gt;&gt; That's just the way he is. &gt;&gt; He say his thoughts are higher than our thoughts. &gt;&gt; His way is higher than our ways. So, you may not have the opportunity to to get it right because you procrastinated. Guess what? Next week, I will have it in order. Don't come yet. Come in two weeks time because I'll sort it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He want you ready tonight. &gt;&gt; He want you ready now cuz he could come anytime. &gt;&gt; In a message, Christ knocking at the door. Here, here's what it says in paragraph 27. And when Jesus comes, he wants to be welcome. But we've got little secret doors, little bitty doors in our heart and we don't want Jesus in. Over to the right hand side of the human heart after Jesus gets in, there's a little door called pride. Oh, I will receiving a savior. But don't you try to tell me the way I should dress &gt;&gt; the way I have to do. Oh, if I let if I have to let my hair grow out, if I have to stop smoking cigarettes or quit going down to the pool room, I don't want nothing to do with it. Don't worry, he won't stay long. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's not welcome there. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not interested in staying long there. &gt;&gt; There's another another not a little hard door in there called your own private life. &gt;&gt; You don't want nobody dillydallying with that. I live my life. I do this that or the other, but nobody's business what I do. Haven't you heard that old proverb? But I tell you, you are not your own. &gt;&gt; You are bought with a price and you belong to God. &gt;&gt; You have no right to your own property. God should know everything. And he does know everything that you do. and he should have the right to that door. And there's another door in there. It's a door called faith. Oh, that is quite a door. Now look, I've accepted Jesus as my savior, but I don't believe that the days of miracles are today. I just can't believe it. He wants to get in that door. If he could ever open that door and stand there as Lord, brother, you'll believe every word God wrote in his book. But how you going to do it when you got some kind of a church laws tacked up on the door? Stay away, Jesus. Don't you try to tell me of that old stuff that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. You could stand there. I don't want to go to hell. I want to be popular in church, but you can't control me because I know better. I'm a scientist. So it is with people today in which they try to compartmentalize Christianity. Amen. &gt;&gt; They try to separate the Sunday church life from the rest of their natural life. &gt;&gt; As if God judges you on a Sunday. This is a everyday yesterday, today, and forever. God &gt;&gt; that not changing across the board. He want to monitor you across the board. He knows across the board. He sees and he wants you to be ready. So when he calls, you could respond appropriately. You could respond accordingly. You could respond the way he expect you to respond. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just to shift gears a little bit, I want to say age is no excuse. &gt;&gt; This is not a message for adults. &gt;&gt; This is not speaking to to to seniors or children or anybody in particular because there's a little guy called Samuel. He was a child in Samuel chapter 3. The Lord called him once. He said, "Here am I." He thought Eli call him. We know the story. Call him a second time. He said, "Eli, assures you this time, cuz I hear your call, man." Eli said, "No, go and lie down again." When he heard it the third time, he say, "This is how I want you to respond." And with that he say he perceived that God was speaking to him. Eli perceived that God was speaking to Samuel. &gt;&gt; He said unto Samuel in verse 9, "Go lie down, and it shall be." If he call thee, that thou shalt say, "Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth." &gt;&gt; So Samuel went and lay down in his place. And the Lord came and stood and called at other times. Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, "Speak for thy servant hear it." &gt;&gt; No wonder the Bible said, "Train up a child &gt;&gt; in the way that he must go. &gt;&gt; When he grows up, he wouldn't depart from it." &gt;&gt; Because they need to know the voice, too. &gt;&gt; They need to know what the prophet voice sound like. &gt;&gt; They need to know what the voice of God sound like because they have parents who knows what it sounds like. They know parents who know the promises, who knows the word &gt;&gt; and could teach them &gt;&gt; godly and Christian ways. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have our part to play. We have a responsibility so they could respond accordingly. &gt;&gt; You know in a message Kingsman Redeemer speaking about Ruth paragraph 83 it says when I accepted Christ I was turned out of my own home. When I accepted Christ, my boyfriend, girlfriend, everybody throwed me down. Went down to a bunch of old people that had the Holy Spirit and believed in God serving him. The girls that were down there in that church were different than the girls I'd been going with. They look different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They acted different. &gt;&gt; They were strange &gt;&gt; and I was scared of them. &gt;&gt; They were different people. You see, that's what Ruth had to do. When God calls, you have a choice to make. God don't force you. &gt;&gt; He allow you to decide what you want. &gt;&gt; So he will call you and it's up to you to say yes Lord. Here I am. &gt;&gt; I'm available to be used by you &gt;&gt; or Lord I'm not ready. I don't want this. I going the next direction. In Ruth's case she had to come from her own to another people. &gt;&gt; She was converted. She made a decision. And you make a decision. You got to take your choice. You want to go back to the things of the world or you want to go on with God. Do you want to act like the world and the rest of them? Then kiss God goodbye and go back. But if you want to take your way with the Lord's despised few, hold on to God's unchanging hand. Regardless of what the world the rest of the world says, you hold right there. God said so. It's true. &gt;&gt; I believe it. though I can't make it manifest in my life. God said so. So I believe it. I hold right there. That's the way she did to Naomi. She said, "I'll not leave you. I'll go where you go. Your people will be my people. What they eat, I will eat. Where you die, I die. Where you buried, I'll be buried." So she identified with that call. &gt;&gt; That call of separation from the past, from traditions, from culture, from comfort, from what she knew. She realized, listen, this is the way I have to go. If I have to see change in my life, if I have to see the blessings of the Lord, if I have to press forward and the Lord do more to me if I fail anywhere, that's a real cleancut decision. God wants cleancut decisions out of his church. Not a decision, well, Lord, if you just bless me, God not in the negotiation business, you know, he really isn't. Lord, if you bless me and do this for me, I'll do so and so. If you if you give me a job, if you give him a promotion, then perhaps I'll start to come every Sunday. He don't have time with that. You know, &gt;&gt; he operates the way he wants, &gt;&gt; the way he chooses, the way he allows. You see how Ruth operated? She say, "I'll go anyhow. If I die, all right, live or die, whatever it is." If they laugh at me, make fun of me, don't doesn't make any difference. I'll go anyhow. That kind of cleancut decision like like Rebecca and we heard it on Sunday. When Eleazar was challenged to get a bride for Isaac, he got desperate. He went and prayed and he said, "Lord, here what the damsel at water camel and give me water. That one is the one." All right. &gt;&gt; So he had this burden on his heart to ensure that he found the right type of bride for his master. &gt;&gt; He went out and he stood there and he waited perhaps patiently looking as people came and went. And it may have seemed like the normal thing to do. Don't talk to strangers. Don't operate a particular way. But not Rebecca. &gt;&gt; Rebecca had a special call. Amen. &gt;&gt; She had a special assignment. &gt;&gt; She was predestinated to be part of the bloodline of Jesus. &gt;&gt; So when she came and she saw him, &gt;&gt; she offered, &gt;&gt; she didn't have to be prompted. &gt;&gt; That was part of her DNA. &gt;&gt; She was accustomed helping &gt;&gt; going the extra mile. &gt;&gt; So she offered him &gt;&gt; the camel and went on. &gt;&gt; But something struck me when I looked at it. Eleazar when he was convinced that this was the one, he said, "You know what? Don't delay. Let's make haste and go back. Let's wrap this thing up and move." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's make this thing a reality quick. &gt;&gt; In the scripture in Genesis 24, they said, "Behold, Rebecca is before thee. Take her and go. Let her be thy master son wife, as the Lord has spoken. And it came to pass that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshiped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth. And guess what? The servant brought forth jewels of silver like a dory jewels of gold and rain. Give them to Rebecca. He gave also to her brother. So not only Rebecca was getting blessed, her brother got and to her mother precious things. &gt;&gt; So everybody get handled. Rebecca herself, her brother, and her mother. As if that wasn't good enough, they did eat and drink. So, they're having a good old line, a good old party. He and the men that were with him. So, it wasn't a one-man show. They had this thing, luck, gifts, precious gold, silver, precious things to family. We were determined. We prayed before this was it. But you see all that I mentioned there, if that happened to you and I, you say hallelujah. This is God working it out. Favor, man. But you know what he had to face after that? Resistance. &gt;&gt; The same way bright skies and as a sign of God's approval. It doesn't negate the fact that resistance will come. Resistance might come. It may come. So you have to prepare for it. &gt;&gt; You have to be prepared to handle it, to see obstacles and hurdles and overcome them. &gt;&gt; So after all that we mentioned there her brother and mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at least 10 and after that she shall go. So after the gifts, after the meals, after the food, after the precious things, she still decide, you know what? Let her stay back with us a little bit more, a little week and a half, &gt;&gt; a week and a half extra. This is our daughter going out. And at that time, Eleazar said, "Listen, hinder me not seeing the Lord has prospered my way. &gt;&gt; He has come and he showed me. I prayed and he told me listen the one that water the camel and myself that's the one assure are convinced are ready to move &gt;&gt; and they still said we will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth in essence let's allow her to decide whether or not she want to go now or she want to go lateral and they called Rebecca and said unto her will thou go with this man and she said I will go. &gt;&gt; And they sent away Rebecca, their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men. Now, what she essentially did is say, "Listen, I know I have history here. I have family here. I have traditions. I have culture. But I want to be identified with somebody I don't know. with a little group that that preaching thunders with a little group that that say they have a open book and that say they have a revelation and they had a prophet I would prefer to be identified with that and by faith are willing to move &gt;&gt; that is what she's telling them you know &gt;&gt; she is saying listen at this point I prefer to do that &gt;&gt; and they blessed Rebecca and said unto her thou art our sister &gt;&gt; be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gates of those which hate them. &gt;&gt; And Rebecca arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels. The same camels followed the man and servant. The servant took Rebecca and went his way. &gt;&gt; Now at the end of the day, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God got the glory. &gt;&gt; At the end of the day, Isaac got his bride. &gt;&gt; Eleazar was successful on his mission, but it had resistance. &gt;&gt; Today and tomorrow, your life will have resistance. And resistance shows up in different forms in various forms. Sometimes resistance is your own family. &gt;&gt; Sometime resistance is your friends, your colleagues, your co-workers. They some sometimes it's innocent and all. Listen, we know you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; We know you don't really drink, but we want to have a little get together by the bar. We want to have a little outing in a place. Listen, it wouldn't be that bad. You know, &gt;&gt; you could just try. You don't have to do too much. &gt;&gt; You don't have to dance too much. The music may not be gospel, but you could still come because we doing it together, right? That's resistance. &gt;&gt; Trying to hinder you from being able to respond to your call. &gt;&gt; When God ready to call, imagine he calling for you, but you in the bar, the music so loud, you can't hear the phone when he ringing &gt;&gt; because you're in the wrong place. &gt;&gt; That's resistance. Now the prophet one time he spoke about Johnny Crow &gt;&gt; and we know the story. Nothing new. &gt;&gt; Johnny Crow was out to eat the farmer's corn. That was his objective to feed himself. The farmer said, "Listen, I working too hard to allow you to eat my corn. I'm going to catch you hold your tire up and keep you here. You could eat a little corn if you want because you're tied. So I could limit and restrict how much you have access to." Johnny Crow stayed there patiently. He had no way out. &gt;&gt; But you know what? The other crows, the other birds, his other friends wanted to encourage him and tell him, "Johnny, it go and get cold. Winter coming. We need to fly south. We need to go." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was his call there. &gt;&gt; That was his call at that point. His call was, "Let's head out. Let's fly to freedom." &gt;&gt; There was a old man that saw Johnny Crow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he felt sorry for him. He said, "Look, look at look, look at this. Look at this crow." So he went and he clipped the rope. &gt;&gt; The bird said, "Johnny crow, let's go. Let's leave. Winds are coming." &gt;&gt; And you know what he said? He say he had so much doubt. He said, "I can't make it. I don't think I could make it. I don't think I could make it. I just stay right here." As a matter of fact, in his mind, he didn't realize freedom was on the door. &gt;&gt; He didn't realize he had the ability to go free at that moment &gt;&gt; because he was in this scenario so long. &gt;&gt; He didn't believe he could be set free. &gt;&gt; And tonight, it might feel that you're holding on for so long. You've heard message after message. &gt;&gt; You're addicted for so long. You're tied up for so long. You're bound for so long. You're confused for so long. You're broken for so long. You might be shackled for so long. But I'm here tonight to tell you that you could go free. &gt;&gt; He is calling you out tonight. He is calling out to you tonight. But you have to respond because he set you free. And who the son of man set free &gt;&gt; is free indeed. &gt;&gt; Brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brotherham in a message awakening Jesus. &gt;&gt; He say you have to respond quickly. &gt;&gt; He said the other night the holy spirit struck over in some church. I know. And it called three or four people. He always say it called them. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit called &gt;&gt; them. And when it did they didn't respond just quickly. &gt;&gt; And then he was grieved. He went right away. See, and left me right there. You have to You have to answer him back. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Just remember, he ain't obligated to you. &gt;&gt; You are obligated to him. &gt;&gt; When he call, you have to respond. &gt;&gt; You have to be in a position to answer. &gt;&gt; You have to be in a position to respond to his call. Can you imagine &gt;&gt; if David &gt;&gt; was a Trinidadian be in trouble today? &gt;&gt; Because Jesse had eight sons. David was the youngest. Think about it. Ju just picture it for a second. He had eight sons &gt;&gt; and David was the youngest. David was out seeing about the sheep and Samuel was assigned to anoint a son of Jesse that God will show him to be king of Israel. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Jesse in his elderly wisdom took his seven sons make sure they were well prepared. Their resume was printed. They had a digital copy as well. They were well-dressed, cologne, they took a shower, took a bath. I mean, they shaved. They went by the barber before and they stood before. They stood knowing that Samuel was coming to anoint one of them today. &gt;&gt; You could imagine how Jesse felt. &gt;&gt; Proud father. &gt;&gt; Proud father. &gt;&gt; It didn't even matter which one of the sons. &gt;&gt; I was going to be father of the king. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And one by one, they came. One at a time, one by one, seven of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At the end in Samuel 16, it says, "Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. &gt;&gt; And Samuel said unto Jesse, the Lord has not chosen these." &gt;&gt; He didn't choose any of these, you know. So, &gt;&gt; the Lord don't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; So, if he sent me to anoint one, &gt;&gt; he have to vindicate this. He he have to show which one it is. &gt;&gt; And up to now seven of them pass &gt;&gt; and I hear nothing. &gt;&gt; I see nothing. &gt;&gt; I feel nothing. &gt;&gt; I have the oil still here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Everything is ready. &gt;&gt; But the sacrifice incorrect. &gt;&gt; Wrong man. &gt;&gt; Samuel said unto Jesse, "Are all thy children?" And he said, "There remainth yet the youngest." Now the reason I say if David was Triny nowadays you call the child hey your father calling you &gt;&gt; they stop and ask you what he want &gt;&gt; what you calling me for &gt;&gt; one of my brothers can't handle whoever he calling for &gt;&gt; not David you see I told you God will call who he want where he want when he want how he want he called David before he born you know David was called to the king before David took one step. You know &gt;&gt; the same way he said listen in the womb I Jacob I love and Esau I hate &gt;&gt; it didn't matter what David did you know &gt;&gt; David was seen about the sheep predestinated to be king of Israel you know &gt;&gt; so his response to that call &gt;&gt; when he got that call that call was to come quickly &gt;&gt; your father call in so he respond yes sir sir yes sir I am here what can I do for thee &gt;&gt; they say you are still smelling like sheep you know He did not time to go to the barber. &gt;&gt; His suit wasn't laundered. &gt;&gt; He came just as he was. &gt;&gt; But you know what? &gt;&gt; The oil came to meet him. &gt;&gt; Based on his response, you know what it says it says in in and I skip down to verse 13. They say, "Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward." So you realize when God called, &gt;&gt; the spirit came on him from that day forward. &gt;&gt; So it's so important how you respond to that call. &gt;&gt; What if he wasn't ready to respond? &gt;&gt; What if he had the wrong attitude? &gt;&gt; He come and say all of them, all of them in the army, I I hear just mining sheep. You calling me still. &gt;&gt; I I tired, you know, I working whole day mining sheep. No, but that wasn't his approach. &gt;&gt; He was trained. &gt;&gt; He knew how to respond. &gt;&gt; He was walking into the presence of the priests that could come and say, "Hey, &gt;&gt; I anoint you to be king &gt;&gt; over all of Israel." &gt;&gt; Knowing that he wasn't walking into the palace immediately, you know. &gt;&gt; So, can you imagine how he walked out? &gt;&gt; Chest held high, head held high, puffed up. He was the proudest guy on the block. Now, &gt;&gt; not David. &gt;&gt; Not David at all. &gt;&gt; The way he responded to that call resulted in the spirit coming over him &gt;&gt; upon him from that day forth. &gt;&gt; At the same time, &gt;&gt; you know what happened to Saul? left him immediately. You know, &gt;&gt; evil spirit on him immediately. You know, &gt;&gt; same day, you know, &gt;&gt; your response could shake nations. You know, &gt;&gt; your response could shape communities, you know, &gt;&gt; so you think your your your workplace is something, you start to listen to the call of God. You start to pay attention to that still small voice and see what will happen. &gt;&gt; You will see mountains move. You know, &gt;&gt; people that you thought stood in your way, you see them retire, you know, you see them resign and they they don't even know why. &gt;&gt; Ready or not, here he comes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The story is told of the foolish virgins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in the book of Matthew, there's an account Matthew 25. He says, "Then shall the kingdom of heaven be lightened unto 10 virgins, which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were wise, five of them were foolish. They that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. While the bridegrooms harried, they all slumbered and slept." So you see up till this point they all on the same page &gt;&gt; except for one thing. &gt;&gt; The wise one they took oil in their vessels with their lamps. &gt;&gt; They all waiting. They all ting. They all sleeping. They say slumbered and slept. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But in verse six they said and at midnight &gt;&gt; there was a cry made. So a call went out at midnight. &gt;&gt; Behold the bridegroom cometh. Go ye out to meet him. That was the call at midnight. &gt;&gt; Now mind you, that's what they were waiting for. You know, &gt;&gt; because in verse one, it said they went forth to meet the bridegroom. So that's their objective. That's their motive. We must meet the bridegroom. So we meet you. Fellowship is convention. Hey, God bless you. We all here together. We all out to meet the bridegroom. Amen. Yes. we going to do that. But at this point when the call went out, &gt;&gt; they all weren't ready. Only the wise ones &gt;&gt; would have prepared enough to be ready. &gt;&gt; They say, "Then all in verse 7, then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps, and the foolish said unto the wise, give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out." But the wise answered, saying, "Not so, least there be not enough for us and you." But go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves. &gt;&gt; Because it's an individual affair. If I give you mine, we all in the same boat. &gt;&gt; We all stay out and we all not see the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; But that is the purpose for which we came. &gt;&gt; That is the intention. That's why we are here. &gt;&gt; To be to make ourselves ready is the bridegroom we preparing towards. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the bride had made herself ready. That's what we waiting for. &gt;&gt; We can't wait. And when we reach the the finish line, then then you realize somebody want help. Well, what we did, we sigh and cry. You know, we worship and praise. We sing. We water the promises. We add faith and mix it together. We do all that. So at the finish line now, you want me to come back and start with you? &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; we can't. So what was interesting is in verse 10 it says and while they went to buy the bridegroom came &gt;&gt; and they that were ready only they that were ready &gt;&gt; went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; Afterward came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us. &gt;&gt; But he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not. &gt;&gt; Because he only recognized the ready you know. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He don't recognize the procrastinators and the late this is a kind of exam that it happening today. &gt;&gt; You it have no supplemental and after the fact I want to do a makeup. It don't have that. &gt;&gt; He who was filthy is filthy still. Righteous is righteous still. Holy holy still. &gt;&gt; It have no I just want to do over because really if you had gan next week that that wouldn't work. Not for this test. He went on and he says, "I know you not. Watch therefore for you neither you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh." So that's the warning there. We don't know. I don't know. You don't know. So we need to be ready regardless. &gt;&gt; It means we must be vigilant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must be sharp. We must be ready at all times. We can't take chances. We can't procrastinate. We need to seek the Lord while he may be found and call upon him while he is near. &gt;&gt; If we do that, you'll be ready. &gt;&gt; What you want to have is the extra oil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham spoke about Moses and he said, you know, it took 40 years for God to really shake Moses up a little bit. Moses knew from birth &gt;&gt; that he was special. &gt;&gt; He was different. &gt;&gt; He had a special call in his life to deliver the pe people of Israel. He might have been in the wrong garb. He might have been in the wrong place. But he knew he was special. After he commit murder, of course, he ran &gt;&gt; to the outside. As far as he concerned, mission um I forget the word they use, but it's like mission abandoned, &gt;&gt; right? Aborted, &gt;&gt; right? But with all this Egyptian philosophy, all the Egyptian technology, all the doctrines he would have gone through, &gt;&gt; it took 40 years for God to drive that out. But what I think is important is that he had reached a point of normaly, &gt;&gt; normal living. wife, family seeing about flocks and taking it easy, you know, minding the children. That that was Moses, brother Moses, father Moses, you know, just at ease in Zion until God interrupted that with the burning bush. &gt;&gt; It interrupted his normal way of life. It interrupted what he knew as traditional &gt;&gt; in a message the angel of the covenant in paragraph 33 it says think of it now he said the time of the promise drew nigh and God called Moses by a pillar of fire in the burning bush then God commissioned him see the call now behold I've sent the angel before you to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which has been prepared head which he's given to them. Beware of it. Provoke him not, for he will not pardon your transgression, for my name is in him. But if thou will indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak, then I'll be an adversary to thy adversaries. Notice he said, I'm going to send him now and I give you already. There it is. Get it? I have give you Palestine. It's yours now. It's all fencing with Hivites, Jebusites, Perisites, Amorites. It's all fencing but I given it to you &gt;&gt; so it's yours &gt;&gt; but it have resistance in it. &gt;&gt; It have challenges. It have obstacles. It have ups and downs. &gt;&gt; He say now let's break that down just for a minute. The land belong to him. Now God didn't say I'm going to go in there and empty the land for you and and give you this land that I take care of and it's well manicured and landscaped. No. He said, "I give it to you. Now you go fight it out with them. &gt;&gt; There you are. God's giving you healing tonight, lady. &gt;&gt; You, every one of you, &gt;&gt; he give it to you. You know, he give you the healing. &gt;&gt; It's your possession. &gt;&gt; It's all bound down with Amorites and Canaanites and everything else &gt;&gt; of unbelief. But go in, take it over. It's yours. It belongs to you. That's right. I must fight if I should reign. Increase my courage, Lord. This is not a picnic ground. This is a battlefield. See, not a place where we lay back and say, "Now, Lord, you just come force it right in me and then I'll do it." No, no, no, no, no. You don't do that. It wouldn't work that way. God has never done it that way. So, you could be healed tonight. &gt;&gt; You could be delivered tonight. Your wayward children could be set free and come home tonight. That is a promise to you. &gt;&gt; But you have to fight for it. &gt;&gt; You have to increase your faith. &gt;&gt; You have to believe &gt;&gt; that he is a man of his word. &gt;&gt; And no word will return void &gt;&gt; and he could accomplish whatever it goes after. &gt;&gt; And you have to put that into practice. Put it into motion and cut it out. So healing is mine tonight. Deliverance is mine tonight. Restoration is mine tonight. It's important when we speaking about a call &gt;&gt; that we know who to respond to. &gt;&gt; We don't respond to every call. &gt;&gt; If some stranger were to come by my house and say, "Come." I I would be embarrassed and shocked if my children responded because they're not trained that way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So they need to be trained to hear a certain sound. &gt;&gt; They need to know who they should respond to and who they should ignore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's important to be trained to understand that. I I know the prophet spoke about the trumpet sound. When a trumpet is sounded, it could be a number of things. &gt;&gt; It could be a call to war. &gt;&gt; It could be a feast. It could be a celebration of a person or something. &gt;&gt; It could mean different things. But when you are trained, you know what that song mean. &gt;&gt; You know if you hear that &gt;&gt; how to respond to it &gt;&gt; because you are trained. &gt;&gt; And it's not the first time you read that scripture. It's not the first time you hear that quote. &gt;&gt; It's not the first time you hear that message &gt;&gt; because you're trained. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you know how to respond &gt;&gt; and what to respond to. &gt;&gt; Because it's a certain song. &gt;&gt; The word also said if it's an uncertain song, who will prepare for the battle? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Who could be prepared? &gt;&gt; The battle is not against flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; But you have to be ready. &gt;&gt; When you hear that certain sound, you could respond appropriately. &gt;&gt; So we have to be trained, right? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Listen, the acceptable year, as we know, is the year of Jubilee. That's when all the slaves and prisoners and so on that that were taken into captivity would be allowed to go free. No matter how long they were in bondage, how long they were supposed to stay there, when that year had come, the year of Jubilee, when the trumpet sounded, every man could go free. &gt;&gt; If he wanted to go free, you're free. There was no more slave &gt;&gt; in a message Jubilee year paragraph 85 he said then when the year of Jubilee or the blast comes the people are receiving the Holy Spirit. You deliberately listen now if you deliberately willfully turn it down. God has no more or not under any more obligation to ever speak to you no more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you'll be marked off all the old types of the Old Testament, only types and shadows of the new. &gt;&gt; And to reject Christ and to turn him down that he'd knocked at your door, you're in the danger line of being bored to the air. Faith cometh by hearing, hearing the word of God. And God will put a blind over your ears that you'll never be able to understand no more. and you'll do no more than criticize the gospel as long as you live and die and be lost forever. What a time while it's jubilee time, while the doors are open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the call could come in different ways, &gt;&gt; sometimes a audible voice, sometimes it's a trumpet, sometimes it's something happen, &gt;&gt; but the Holy Spirit responds with fire. You know, &gt;&gt; sometime he call you with fire &gt;&gt; and you have to respond a particular way. He gave a story one time &gt;&gt; of a little boy with a turtle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said he saw it there and it curled up in the shell &gt;&gt; and he took a stick and he started to hit it. He beat it a little bit and the turtle just remained in the shell. &gt;&gt; He decided to take the turtle and baptized in water. He put it in water and it stayed curled in the shell. Prophet said he decided to put some fire under it. He light some paper and put it under. You know that turtle that we know to be a slow animal start to sprint, &gt;&gt; start to move &gt;&gt; because it was too much fire. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost fire &gt;&gt; sometimes will be so so listen so powerful in your life that you can't stay still. &gt;&gt; You can't sit down anymore. You have to do something. You have to lift your hands up. You have to stand up. You have to move. He said, "That's what we need tonight is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire and not so much church creed back in the thing, back like the forefathers had it. We need another Pentecost that will line you up with the Holy Ghost. They'll send people to their knees, send people to their Bible to search the scriptures and look for them. It doesn't give an uncertain sound. It gives just exactly what the Bible said it would do. What Jesus said it'll it'll do. Ye abide in me and my words in you, then ask what you will." Why? You're in Christ by faith and the word is in you. That is the Holy Ghost in you and it is the word. Then this printed word makes itself manifest, bring it to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Just about to wind down and I want to touch the mother eagle in a message as the eagle stirred up her nest. Paragraph 76. Now then when her little ones are born, the mother eagle, there comes there comes a time that the mother eagle is determined that her little eiglets are not going to be chickens. &gt;&gt; That's the way that God is. &gt;&gt; He determined that his sons and daughters will not be like everybody else. &gt;&gt; That you will be a chosen people. That'll be a royal priesthood, &gt;&gt; a holy nation, &gt;&gt; that you'll be set apart and different. Amen. Oh, I love that. I hope this sinks in. The mother eagle is determined that her babies will not act like the rest of them chickens, them birds that earthbound. She's got to give them an experience. That's the way Christ is to his church. There's something more than just joining church, belonging to a denomination. There's something more than just being a good citizen. Certainly Christ is here like the mother mother eagle to see that you get it. And the mother eagle is equipped to take care of her little ones to see that their experience is right. &gt;&gt; So there comes a time when there's a stirring in the nest. Oh God, send us a stirring in the nest. The eagle is supposed to be a bird that renews his youth. Every so often, no matter how old he is, he turns back to a young bird again. Not in years, but in physical makeup. &gt;&gt; He renews his youth. The Bible said he did. &gt;&gt; Thou will renew his youth like the eagle. &gt;&gt; He renews his youth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She says she runs and she seems if something is wrong. She looks over her baby. She examines them. Oh, I've laid with binoculars and watch them. And she goes in all at once. Sets on the nests. She scream. What's she doing? She's teaching those little fellows her own call. My sheep know my voice. Those little fellows have never been out of that nest. They just live right there all the time. So it's the responsibility of the mother eagle to ensure that the eaglets knows the eagle call &gt;&gt; so it could respond to the call &gt;&gt; the musicians could get ready. in and in in in the same in the same message. At one point there was a farmer with some chickens. And when he was going to put them to to to to to lay in the barn, he took the eggs, all the chicken eggs, and he put a eagle egg with it to make up numbers. You know, one day in the barn, you say that chicken was sorry, that that eagle was different to all the chickens. It walked with the chickens. It probably thought it was a chicken, but something was different about it. &gt;&gt; It sometimes had little fights and challenges with the way things were. The fact that you just have to scratch the dirt, scratch around looking for scraps. Didn't feel natural. Just the way the old chickens went around and thought they were having a wonderful time. But you know one day while they were in the barnyard there came a scream across the sky. The old mother happened to sweep by and she looked down. She saw this little fellow tugging along looking. Oh brother, his eye is on the sparrow. This one thing we know, God knows his own. &gt;&gt; The old mother eagle happened to come over this barnard and she looked down. She saw her young. The farmer stole him. That's right. an egg out of her nest, but that was hers. She screamed to him, "Honey, son, you're not a chicken. You're an eagle. &gt;&gt; You are mine." &gt;&gt; You see how the call came? &gt;&gt; I've come for you. &gt;&gt; I remember the night when God made that scream to me. &gt;&gt; You're not of this world. &gt;&gt; You're not of them chickens. &gt;&gt; You're not a chicken to begin with. You're an eagle. &gt;&gt; You're mine. I've come for you. Now honey, up and listen to my word. Just make a little jump and flop your little wings. She's circling the barnard. Oh, I pray that this very hour he's circling the barnyard. &gt;&gt; Your mind, you belong to me. &gt;&gt; You could play Jesus is here right now. &gt;&gt; There's something about that voice that he understood. He may have lived with chickens for a long time. He may have acted like a chicken and ate chick food whether crack corn or what what whatever it was. But when he heard that eagle call, something resonated in him &gt;&gt; that he knew that sound. &gt;&gt; Goodbye chicken yard. He made a great big flop with his little wings and he landed right on top of the barnard post. He seen he had done something. He wasn't the air yet, but he did something. I'd say then he joined a denomination. Got right in the middle of a Pentecostal organization. His mother screamed again, "Honey, you've got to come higher than that." &gt;&gt; I think we do, too. We've got to come higher than that. We got to come higher than under an organization or denomination or confession. She said, "Just simply make another jump and flop with all that's in you. I'll catch you on my wings and I'll bear you up to a place where you ought to be. God bless you. [Music] Oh, set the captive free. Oh, Jesus is here. Oh, let us praise him tonight. Hallelujah.
