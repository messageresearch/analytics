[28:02] Isaac having a great time in Nigeria at
[28:04] a tremendous blessed you can go for that
[28:06] a real powerful service last length
[28:09] praise God so God is good and tongue
[28:13] good for this message and tongue good
[28:14] presenting us a prophet message that
[28:17] belongs to all of us he has nobody have
[28:21] a copyright on it does nobody have a
[28:23] have a right in it and more right than
[28:25] others it doesn't have all that sort of
[28:27] foolishness his God said behold I send
[28:29] you the world Elijah the prophet we are
[28:33] privileged to receive that Elijah that
[28:37] that prophet message what I want to say
[28:39] is that um Jesus ministry started first
[28:43] with healing and then prophecy are the
[28:46] second part of his ministry and then you
[28:48] know his ministry was the triple
[28:50] priestesses in prison and so the brides
[28:53] have that similar ministry for the
[28:55] Branham K made a sign to the brain and
[28:58] bring words of prophecy and we had to be
[29:01] puffy sign all these years and you
[29:02] prophesy before it happens
[29:04] if you prophesy of your healing before
[29:06] it happened you prophesy of deliverance
[29:08] before it happens and you can only do
[29:10] that if you go and get the book this
[29:13] book is if you call upon the name of the
[29:15] Lord and we we shared something uncommon
[29:18] um on Sunday about Caleb Tuesday writing
[29:21] permitting and you said ask it shall be
[29:23] given unto you all these words that
[29:25] Jesus spoke about vain words your card
[29:27] has beam on money just hoping some day
[29:28] and hoping God knew something no he said
[29:30] ask it shall be given unto you if God
[29:33] come down this morning and say ask
[29:34] what's going to ask him for what is the
[29:36] desire of your heart but what is posited
[29:38] in your spirit that is what is important
[29:41] ask and you have that because you acts
[29:43] not because you're asking you know
[29:45] you're not asking and full feet and
[29:47] believe in but you have to ask in order
[29:49] to get see if you have to get your
[29:52] breakthrough you get your blessing you
[29:53] have to ask God because hope go delivery
[29:55] when you have to ask Ord that core
[29:57] deliver your children that's why Caleb
[29:59] said give me my mountain I want it I am
[30:02] asking faith that's why the voice there
[30:04] the John go to the angel said give me
[30:06] the book look once that money in just
[30:08] watch the books it give me the book
[30:09] therefore you have to have a revelation
[30:11] as to what you have to possess so that
[30:14] is what church is all about church is to
[30:16] reconcile you back to your God church is
[30:19] not for the pastor to be up some in some
[30:21] mountains and when you don't submit
[30:22] Valley that's not what it is about
[30:24] catches you to come to recognize your
[30:26] sonship your God ship your inheritance
[30:28] which is where you come back to connect
[30:30] back you get your own cell phone where
[30:33] you get your own number
[30:34] when whatever call you hear the call you
[30:36] see somebody you call you on your line
[30:39] when you have to talk to me instead talk
[30:41] them to somebody you talk to him direct
[30:44] on your line because your name is your
[30:46] line your name is your number you don't
[30:49] have anybody else beam you have your own
[30:50] name and you put your name in the book I
[30:53] welcome the cannot become under call you

[35:49] wanna do after Wednesday's you know who
[35:52] was it like I send them to use the
[35:53] prefer them how much mystery up with
[36:00] statements a little fishy I give you
[36:01] back your life I must talk after
[36:07] prophecy before the Turkistan the wife
[36:09] of a big human being like a drip Fugees
[36:11] on your operating theater the duck is
[36:13] about to come down with that night and I
[36:15] mind spoke a word before the doctor son
[36:16] touches my wife the tumor will go down
[36:18] another damn hand come Onaga to mark of
[36:21] England
[36:23] [Music]
[36:29] Jesus took bread and five those two
[36:32] fishes and take it and blessed it and
[36:33] brake it and share it
[36:35] no complication no complications Tigra
[36:40] two fishes my problem no complication
[36:43] but I thank you for this bread blessed
[36:46] know he tell you that was to share it
[36:48] share what I wrote on two fishes yet
[36:54] after the multi-platinum fish cut
[36:58] somebody next to you I'm gonna share
[37:02] I'm going to share it work but all with
[37:08] my testimony is small just show what I
[37:11] have in my hand is small just seven even
[37:13] ask you to multiply you can talk to the
[37:15] sheriff
[37:16] and if you said you find your motor ship
[37:18] I forgive you find you a more together
[37:22] hallelujah sell what you have it's not
[37:25] complicated
[37:26] oh my I can't get to what I want to get
[37:29] through the challenge we have is dead
[37:32] but abandom said God was so mysterious
[37:34] let's change up what mysterious to
[37:36] complicated that he wanted to make
[37:39] himself simple to be understood by the
[37:42] simple so that was go challenge how do i
[37:46] how do I reveal myself I'm so mysterious
[37:50] although I always been the word became
[37:54] flesh but we could handle him
[37:59] you could touch Hallel all this were the
[38:03] mystery and book we could handle him
[38:06] because now the word they become more
[38:08] worthy what becomes less but then the
[38:10] word spoke out a mystery I had unfallen
[38:12] words and we have it because God notice
[38:14] the lecture is we have words we have
[38:16] books and we call it books we got a big
[38:18] argument I don't find so I like it so I
[38:21] do agree with that so intellect but yet
[38:24] before that word in the beginning was
[38:27] the word that was in the beginning but
[38:29] before the beginning there was a rainbow
[38:30] there was spirit so we fought about any
[38:33] argument this big debate or dispute
[38:36] there was the Spirit of God rainbow we
[38:40] have to go back to the rainbow could I
[38:42] see I told you you know grunting on come
[38:45] on
[38:45] but a brand new edition to teach now
[38:49] towards the end of the 4-h with the
[38:53] invasion of Constantinople by the Turks
[38:55] they sent the limits colors of the east
[38:57] to get the Greek manuscripts to the west
[38:59] the purity of the world and the
[39:02] teachings of true believers were thus
[39:03] disseminated not only were these fine
[39:06] teachers of great importance but also
[39:08] the invention of what became the mud
[39:10] press produce the production of books
[39:13] does we find great hunger and demand for
[39:16] the Bible could be answered God raise up
[39:19] many mighty men of wish Peter was but
[39:22] one the about lieutenant Liu tan Yu da
[39:24] luta was not the only one many many men
[39:27] Goethe was one of them and Alvin and
[39:31] swingley and the two other luminaries
[39:33] besides there were many many more who
[39:35] I'm not so well known however though all
[39:38] this was not in vain the mighty work of
[39:42] God was actually hindered death by these
[39:45] very men ha ha
[39:49] that is something you know will the age
[39:52] come for books and printing and
[39:54] everything has a name Envy for the Lord
[39:55] but listen to a deeper insight of this
[39:59] watch the mighty work of God was
[40:04] actually hindered by these very men for
[40:07] one thing they did not oppose the church
[40:11] state marriage of the Nicene council but
[40:14] actually fostered that union you see the
[40:17] devil is very tricky if he got hit young
[40:20] one let me take an image level this is
[40:22] what but a man says here the defense of
[40:24] the gospel by the state was welcomed
[40:28] door there was no word for hit they come
[40:33] by the government is of the devil and
[40:34] the government under protect
[40:35] Christianity here is it what is this see
[40:38] turn fighting for God God can work so
[40:43] what he said you know the defense of the
[40:46] gospel the state was welcomed though
[40:47] there was no word for it so whatever is
[40:50] being done there must be a word for it
[40:53] so you have to get back to the
[40:56] scriptures because what a man'll came to
[40:58] reveal the scriptures the entering I
[41:00] said what a bounce a ball around said no
[41:02] he come to review this so what he said
[41:05] could go back into this
[41:09] give me a way better of it is that a
[41:11] mystery scripture a previously hidden
[41:15] truth now divinely revealed with a
[41:19] supernatural element over it despite the
[41:22] revelation but the first part is a
[41:25] mystery in Scripture so the defense of
[41:31] the gospel by the state was welcomed do
[41:33] there was no word for it and though we
[41:35] can see the wrath of man praising God in
[41:37] such a friends as henri de taking of the
[41:40] republic reformation and rejection of
[41:42] papal Authority it was a far cry from
[41:44] the truth of Pentecost and the
[41:47] protection of an omnipotent God in spite
[41:51] here we go in spite of looters constant
[41:55] teaching against the outside
[41:59] interference is local to its matters The
[42:05] ministers fight this they don't want
[42:07] this affinity of the local church they
[42:10] want bishops to take over and claim to
[42:11] be a fool as if God commissioned a bunch
[42:16] of mental pic overreaches that is
[42:17] bringing back Nicoletta and bringing
[42:19] back room all over again
[42:20] but in a modern way in a message we
[42:23] listen to what he said in in spite of
[42:26] ludus constant teaching against outside
[42:31] interference in local church matters he
[42:36] was not able to clear men's minds of
[42:39] Bishop Archbishop concept of church
[42:42] government does the church took one step
[42:45] in the right direction but remain
[42:47] shackled
[42:48] so in short she was imprisoned in the
[42:51] same dungeon when she attempted escape
[42:55] still the cup of our abominable works
[42:58] was not yet full not only Luther comport
[43:01] judgment inside the battle and thereby
[43:03] cause the death of multitudes but
[43:05] swingley party persecuted in the prison
[43:07] the godly dr. Hugh Maia and though it
[43:10] did not convert him to the stick it was
[43:12] actually responsible in great measure
[43:14] for his eventual death by sire house
[43:17] then did no less
[43:18] but remanded the arrest of Civitas who
[43:21] have been seen and taught the oneness of
[43:23] the Godhead the state then tried his
[43:25] brother and the Calvinist may even bring
[43:27] a distinct lies when they connected the
[43:30] government charge a big lemon church
[43:32] they heard boom and destroy could I go
[43:35] any further what was done if there ever
[43:39] a time of the nomination ordeal it was
[43:42] this tragic time the worth of
[43:45] convenience described much of his era
[43:47] and his route wanting needful and that's
[43:50] what I title is anything today once in
[43:52] visa he compares the world to a
[43:54] labyrinth which is a maze and modular
[43:56] weapon and shows that the way out here
[43:59] we go
[44:00] do we out the way out for your life
[44:03] right now this morning the ryote is to
[44:06] leave what is needless and choosing the
[44:12] one thing that is needful don't waste
[44:16] your time
[44:17] kill what is needless and begin to see
[44:20] what is needful what you need to do how
[44:23] you need to act what you need to say you
[44:27] take the side of what is needful isn't
[44:30] that right
[44:30] and choosing the one thing needful which
[44:33] Christ the great number of teachers he
[44:37] says is the reason of the molecule of
[44:40] sex for which we shall have so no more
[44:43] names left each church reckon itself as
[44:47] the true one or at least the purest
[44:50] Jewish part of it while among themselves
[44:52] they persecute each other with
[44:54] bitterness hatred no no reconciliation
[45:01] is to be hoped between them they meet
[45:04] enmity with irreconcilable enmity out of
[45:09] the Bible forged the different trees
[45:12] these are their fortresses and
[45:15] boulevards behind which they and change
[45:18] themselves and resist all attacks
[45:21] I will not say that these confessions of
[45:23] faith for we can admit in most cases
[45:25] they are they are so that they are so
[45:27] bad in themselves
[45:28] they become so yeah why because in that
[45:32] they feed the fire of enmity only by
[45:37] putting them away altogether only by
[45:41] putting them are we all together
[45:44] would it be possible to set to work on
[45:46] healing the wounds of the church to the
[45:51] labyrinth of sex and various confessions
[45:53] others belongs the love of disputations
[45:57] which is argument the love of it love it
[45:59] some people love it
[46:01] the guy just listen and talk normal they
[46:03] have to argue de Geste l.o.v.e it what
[46:09] is obtained by it the question has a
[46:13] single learner strife ever been settled
[46:17] never the number has only been increased
[46:22] argument between husband 'likes
[46:24] and i going down the line they argue
[46:26] another argument rocket or a Zeppelin or
[46:29] baguette wait what does he wants a
[46:32] husband or you know already but for
[46:36] edification sake I will see it again
[46:38] husband love your wife wife respect your
[46:44] husband if your husband love you and you
[46:46] don't respect him how do I look dialogue
[46:48] go get bunks against that this is my
[46:50] girl and afterwards you love will fall
[46:52] short but if it work in harmony with the
[46:55] Scriptures you will see an improvement
[46:57] you would see a whole different thing
[46:59] altogether Satan I'm almost done
[47:02] Satan is the greatest sophist and that
[47:06] word sophist means color Mystica here
[47:10] splitter and I got a new word doctrine
[47:13] eeeh never heard of one before and the
[47:17] doctrine is somebody that is rigid
[47:19] inflexible unbending and dogmatic if you
[47:24] say someone is a doctrinaire or was a
[47:26] doctrinal attitude your disobey of six
[47:29] principles which is right of force on
[47:31] other people I believe it so and you
[47:34] should be so cool
[47:36] so you are Peter and I happen to be poor
[47:40] with different go Andrews Andrew Peter
[47:45] is Peter James and James is none right
[47:47] so watch season is the greatest sophist
[47:50] or scholar or doctrinaire oh yes
[47:53] paternity cur he at watch he has never
[47:57] been overcome in strength of words so
[48:00] don't take for one minute that you want
[48:03] to debate the devil no but I already
[48:08] said this is the thunder that shakes the
[48:12] devil what is it a live voice not mode
[48:17] voice not Dapitan voice a live voice
[48:20] that is the Thunder that gonna shake the
[48:24] devil is your life consecrated dedicate
[48:27] the god you can't say one word about
[48:29] that person so sweet so humble so we're
[48:34] living
[48:34] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[48:37] Neverland senior multi feeling your
[48:39] spirit I want your vibes out isn't I
[48:43] rang so he has never been able to
[48:45] overcome in cyber words here we go in
[48:48] divine service the words of men are
[48:52] usually heard more than the word of God
[48:55] each one chatez only pieces or kill time
[48:59] by linen disquisitions and that word
[49:02] means the beat speeches and Athene and
[49:05] disproven the view of others of the new
[49:09] birth and how a man must be changed into
[49:13] the likeness of Christ to become a
[49:16] partaker of his divine nature second be
[49:19] the one for scarcely anything a said
[49:21] nothing is said about the virtues
[49:23] Bordeaux's rainbows about the life not
[49:26] entirely ending yourself but watch
[49:30] scarcely ending a said of the power of
[49:33] the keys the church has almost lost the
[49:34] power of Beynon all the pollution
[49:37] remains the sacraments the symbols of
[49:40] unity of love and of our life in Christ
[49:41] have been made the occasion of bitterest
[49:44] conflict a course of mutual hatred SEC
[49:47] tourism
[49:48] in short Christendom might become a
[49:50] labyrinth which is a means a weber
[49:52] jungle the fear has been split into a
[49:54] thousand little parts and your leader
[49:57] heretic
[49:58] if there is one of them you do not
[50:00] accept what can help only do only one
[50:06] thing needful return the Christ look at
[50:11] the Christ as the only leader and
[50:14] walking in his footsteps
[50:16] second aside all other ways until we
[50:19] reach the goal and have come to the
[50:21] unity of the field regions for 13 as the
[50:27] heavenly father and the heavenly master
[50:29] built everything on the ground of the
[50:31] scriptures so shall we leave all
[50:33] particularities our special confession
[50:36] and be satisfied with the revealed Word
[50:40] of God which belongs to all of us with
[50:45] the Bible in our hand we should see we
[50:48] should cry I believe that God has
[50:51] revealed this book I will obediently
[50:54] keep his commands that I play holding
[50:56] this ole Miss's when I don't I hope for
[51:01] that which he has promised Christians
[51:03] can hear there's only one life but that
[51:06] comes to us in a thousand forms there's
[51:09] only one Christ but a toast Antichrist
[51:13] so don't know and so Christian them what
[51:16] is the one thing needful either the
[51:18] alternates back to Christ or your go to

[1:30:57] actually born again of the Spirit of God
[1:31:00] you say it doesn't change you you're

[1:31:34] new birth Oh hallelujah thought to
[1:31:37] happen is that is an experience it's
[1:31:40] something that takes place it's not

[1:31:47] doctrine not some new form new theology
[1:31:49] or new idea no no no no no listen you

[1:31:59] different churches they'd say well if
[1:32:02] you accept this or believe that then
[1:32:05] it's all right but it isn't he says now
[1:32:09] to begin with the base path the reason
[1:32:12] we have to be born again is because the
[1:32:14] Bible teaches us that we are all born in
[1:32:17] sin
[1:32:19] amen Bible teachers an image we are all
[1:32:23] born in sin there's none righteous

[1:36:31] and as testimonies of the love of God

[1:37:19] nothing you have never been something if

[1:37:41] boy love if it wasn't for His grace if
[1:37:44] it wasn't for his mercy there are people
[1:37:47] who wish they could be where you are now
[1:37:49] oh they are found and change what's on a
[1:37:52] raise up of pride so go and break those
[1:37:55] change this morning
[1:37:57] Poosh are performing Oh hallelujah
[1:38:01] hallelujah was looking for people a man
[1:38:06] oh my
[1:38:10] I'm no good no good
[1:38:15] I need a wool eagle just like everybody
[1:38:20] else
[1:38:22] Peter Paul zing John all of them needed
[1:38:25] the Holy Ghost the same way they had to
[1:38:28] come to the same baptism he had to pay
[1:38:31] the same price Mary couldn't say when I
[1:38:33] gave birth to Jesus
[1:38:35] I have special privilege as though she
[1:38:38] had to receive the same Holy Ghost she
[1:38:41] had to get out same penny Oh
[1:38:43] Alleluia she had to pay the same price
[1:38:45] and all of us have got to pay the same
[1:38:47] price
[1:38:48] Rita fort Leslie fought on earlier
[1:38:51] because of fight also we've got to pay
[1:38:54] the same price
[1:38:55] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:58] Honoria whoa earlier you must be born
[1:39:02] again it's nice that we're no good to
[1:39:08] begin with so we cannot even claim
[1:39:11] anything is a profit now by all
[1:39:15] sweetness or as all sincerity or how
[1:39:19] great we are how little we are or
[1:39:22] whatever more we are altogether wrong to
[1:39:25] begin with and there is nothing at all
[1:39:28] that we can do about it
[1:39:29] you cannot jesus said who by taking
[1:39:33] thought can add one cubit is stature one
[1:39:37] measure to such a rather you can take
[1:39:39] all the thoughts do all the dreaming of
[1:39:42] it read it study it examine it and
[1:39:44] everything else and you can't help
[1:39:46] yourself one iota
[1:39:48] so that just throws it all out he said
[1:39:51] I'm so glad it does because if it's laid
[1:39:54] in the thought of knowing something or
[1:39:56] how smart we will see we poor illiterate
[1:40:00] people would be left out so we wouldn't
[1:40:02] have a chance
[1:40:03] but God change it or rather he said
[1:40:07] never had it that way
[1:40:08] in the beginning the churches have
[1:40:11] always make it complicated but God makes
[1:40:15] it simple oh the churches always make it
[1:40:20] complicated we have the man trying to
[1:40:22] explain a table as if in some
[1:40:25] four-legged structure a construct that
[1:40:27] neither blueprints Oh hallelujah and it
[1:40:30] makes it dependent on a man so the man
[1:40:32] has all the knowledge the man knows all
[1:40:35] the mysteries and you have to come to
[1:40:37] him to find out who God is but that's
[1:40:39] not the way God intended it God makes it
[1:40:42] simple for hallelujah so that you could
[1:40:45] see the vision and run with the vision
[1:40:47] whoa alleluia alleluia alleluia
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:56] but God makes it simple so that it's
[1:40:59] brought down to a place where all of us
[1:41:03] can see it oh do you hear this morning
[1:41:05] all of us can have it it's for whosoever
[1:41:09] will
[1:41:10] and now not one man could see the other
[1:41:13] I love that hallelujah hallelujah
[1:41:16] hallelujah not one man could see the
[1:41:18] other so now it makes no difference what
[1:41:20] anyone else tries to say no man could
[1:41:24] save another no matter how smart or what
[1:41:27] his office is
[1:41:28] let him be a pastor or priest a bishop
[1:41:31] or Cardinal our Pope he cannot have one
[1:41:34] thing to do with saving any man's life
[1:41:37] because he is a sinner himself born in
[1:41:41] sin shaped in iniquity coming the world
[1:41:44] speaking lies he's a liar to start with
[1:41:48] that's a strong word he's alive to start
[1:41:52] with and any word you would say would be
[1:41:55] alive if it was contrary to God's Word
[1:41:58] and God's plan but God made a plan here
[1:42:02] we go for man to be saved and man cannot
[1:42:06] add anything to that plan because it is
[1:42:09] oh oh he can't add anything to it
[1:42:17] that's why Moses couldn't save the
[1:42:19] people it took God to come down in a
[1:42:21] burning bush that was God's way of doing
[1:42:24] things
[1:42:25] Moses tried and you only kill one man a
[1:42:28] runaway for 40 years
[1:42:29] that's all man could do but when man
[1:42:32] come to the end of himself when you have
[1:42:34] nothing else to do when you have nowhere
[1:42:36] else to turn to
[1:42:38] that's when called Jepson that's when
[1:42:40] poor drops down won't any other because
[1:42:44] it's right in fourth time it's right in
[1:42:46] both order and you can't interrupt it Oh
[1:42:49] a many men in their eyes you can't add
[1:42:53] anything the god's plans cause plan and
[1:42:55] that's the plan that we are want to
[1:42:58] study this this morning what God's plan
[1:43:00] you said let every man's would be alive
[1:43:02] that might be true therefore we'd be
[1:43:05] danced to change one sentence or to make
[1:43:09] it something else no matter how much or
[1:43:11] rituals and so forth reads we've got to
[1:43:13] forget that this is God's Word
[1:43:16] just can't be done no other way what has
[1:43:19] a plan imagine alright okay
[1:43:20] second four inches tree says now the
[1:43:22] Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit
[1:43:25] of the Lord is there is Liberty
[1:43:28] oh there's freedom in our house this
[1:43:31] morning freedom to worship freedom to
[1:43:33] praise car Oh hallelujah praise God a
[1:43:37] Maronite the blood of Jesus sets you
[1:43:39] free from the law of sin intense human
[1:43:43] spirits woman seven is nice when you
[1:43:45] will you would not when you would do
[1:43:47] good evil is present with you but when
[1:43:50] you break over to Romans 8 we see the
[1:43:52] grace of Almighty God for the law the
[1:43:54] spirit of life in Christ Jesus is what
[1:43:58] sets you free from the law of sin and
[1:44:01] death it is what raises you up above how
[1:44:04] you feel above your fails above your
[1:44:08] shortcomings above your circumstance
[1:44:10] above who you want to be who you're
[1:44:14] trying to be praised ha hallelujah
[1:44:19] but we all will open face beholding as
[1:44:22] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[1:44:25] changed into that same image from glory
[1:44:28] to glory even as by the Spirit of the
[1:44:31] law amen amen
[1:44:33] eleven okay I'm good here on what it
[1:44:37] takes to make a Christian life he says
[1:44:39] but in the word I find that God did not
[1:44:42] intend for the church to be governed by
[1:44:45] intellectual or by any theology of man
[1:44:48] but the Holy Spirit was given to the
[1:44:52] church to govern and control the body of
[1:44:55] Christ and I think in doing that with
[1:44:58] that in mind and in God's program we
[1:45:01] will never be successfully no matter how
[1:45:04] good our intentions are until we get
[1:45:06] back into the center of God's program
[1:45:10] where the Holy Spirit Oh Anna is the
[1:45:14] center of God's program Oh hallelujah
[1:45:17] Jesus at the center of it all oh I the
[1:45:20] center of every motion at the center of
[1:45:22] every decision
[1:45:24] every idea Oh hallelujah and the
[1:45:27] captivity to the word bar into the
[1:45:30] spirit upon hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:45:33] wonderful with message last week that's
[1:45:35] why we ought to be living under the
[1:45:37] inspiration of the Holy Spirit who
[1:45:40] honors so we are fighting this morning
[1:45:42] to live in that inspiration we are not
[1:45:46] fighting for some man's idea no no no
[1:45:49] we're not fighting for own ideas that
[1:45:51] every man's would be alive and that God
[1:45:54] would be true we want God's Word we want
[1:45:59] to raise the standard in this last day
[1:46:02] of the word in this hour
[1:46:04] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh
[1:46:07] glory amen
[1:46:11] Oh mine please God he said now realizing
[1:46:15] that this is no new thing to preach on
[1:46:18] it's something that's been preached on
[1:46:20] many times but the way we approach it
[1:46:23] and the way we take it see we still we
[1:46:26] take it still thinking that that is the
[1:46:30] Holy Spirit control Church and yet we
[1:46:33] put my intellectuals mixed with it and
[1:46:35] then we get a conglomeration of both the
[1:46:38] Holy Spirit and intellectuals I know
[1:46:41] when the Holy Spirit desires to do a
[1:46:43] thing and degrade something or lift
[1:46:46] something up it causes petty jealousy
[1:46:48] among the people which proves that they
[1:46:51] haven't got the Holy Spirit every man
[1:46:55] would want to be in his place
[1:46:57] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but
[1:47:02] over talk about a car on a race porn and
[1:47:04] manasseh wanna race corner everybody
[1:47:06] wanna raise corn to it you're not doing
[1:47:08] what God had for you to do what are you
[1:47:11] looking at somebody else and a man is
[1:47:13] now trying to do their lot all of you
[1:47:16] but when you find your place and you are
[1:47:18] effective in God's kingdom
[1:47:20] I'm brother Branham said I want my
[1:47:22] little finger to be there is that I want
[1:47:24] my little toe to be there every part is
[1:47:27] important to me and that's all God feels
[1:47:30] every part is important to him
[1:47:33] no matter how small a pop machine no
[1:47:36] matter how limited that pop machine
[1:47:38] quarter to lose it

[1:47:58] hallelujah praise God he says a petty
[1:48:01] jealousy and so forth okay
[1:48:04] amen every man wanted in this place
[1:48:06] right now in this the people has a
[1:48:10] reason because it seems so much in
[1:48:12] nomination so much different dictators
[1:48:14] as it was spiritual dictators and a
[1:48:17] church to see does endure but the Holy
[1:48:19] Spirit has placed each one into the
[1:48:22] party of Christ and here is what he said
[1:48:25] we are helpless to maneuver without
[1:48:28] every member of our body we have to have
[1:48:32] our we have to have my hands my arms my
[1:48:36] mouth my my eyes everything that's in me
[1:48:39] to operate to make my body function
[1:48:43] perfectly he said and then if God wanted
[1:48:46] his body the church
[1:48:47] to be governed by his spirit then he's
[1:48:50] got to have got to be some way or some
[1:48:54] program that we've got to enter into
[1:48:57] other than what we have already had
[1:48:59] he's another Bible today Zico speaking

[1:49:04] new heart I'll give you each an and I

[1:51:17] calling said Peter compel it comes they
[1:51:20] walk with Jesus with you and a half yes
[1:51:22] didn't know who he was
[1:51:24] isn't that right oh honey I took a
[1:51:26] revelation from God dropped on your
[1:51:29] people's heart
[1:51:29] I'd say Paul at the price son of the
[1:51:32] Living boss Jesus turned to Peter I say
[1:51:35] passion blood has not revealed to you
[1:51:36] but my part in heaven every village we
[1:51:40] take pause to reveal to you who Jesus is
[1:51:43] that's vitally
[1:51:45] coming to church and doing nice things
[1:51:48] but beyond that the revelation there's a
[1:51:52] supernatural element that remains Oh
[1:51:55] hallelujah and Peter did all the right
[1:52:06] things
[1:52:06] Peter did some nice stuff Peter walked
[1:52:10] on water because brave
[1:52:12] Peter was outspoken holiday in a little
[1:52:15] hasty sometimes but he was a good
[1:52:17] brother Oh hallelujah hallelujah but
[1:52:21] still when the crunch time comes he
[1:52:23] denied Christ
[1:52:24] isn't that right he couldn't take his
[1:52:27] fan he couldn't do what was required of
[1:52:29] him in that taste and he knew it
[1:52:33] Jesus knew it so our air before the
[1:52:36] crows will deny me thrice jesus said you
[1:52:38] got to do these things but he said when
[1:52:41] you are converted strengthen the
[1:52:43] Brethren you means Peter walking with
[1:52:46] Jesus three and a half years and he is
[1:52:48] not converted no he still have something
[1:52:52] to get he still have something to
[1:52:54] receive he's still hard to be firebomb
[1:52:57] it has happened in his life he had to
[1:53:00] receive the thing yet but when Peter was
[1:53:03] in the upper room he was all praying
[1:53:05] there was always blue they were carrying
[1:53:08] in his name they were looking for
[1:53:10] something they were under expectations
[1:53:12] with something and then all of a sudden
[1:53:14] town from the dynamics and an anointing
[1:53:18] dropped on Peters ha the Bible said each
[1:53:21] one received a little pile whoa
[1:53:25] hallelujah hallelujah that's what we're
[1:53:27] looking for this morning

[1:54:15] about it but the person of Jesus because
[1:54:19] the Holy Spirit is not fought but around
[1:54:21] for the Holy Spirit is a person it is an
[1:54:24] actual person with behavior and with
[1:54:28] characteristics and with a lightness
[1:54:31] there's a way that he talks there's a
[1:54:33] way that he walks there the way that he
[1:54:36] does things and we have to come into
[1:54:38] that program we haven't seen that yet
[1:54:41] but that is what we need in the church
[1:54:44] one more time is the person of Jesus in
[1:54:47] the brother in the sister in the Deacons
[1:54:50] any illness in the passes in the
[1:54:52] minister the person of Jesus to forgive
[1:54:55] and to love and to reach out as a help

[2:00:59] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:01:06] he-man hallelujah he said Jesus oh it's
[2:01:13] not a faceless hallelujah is that Jesus
[2:01:16] taught the same thing in Luke when he
[2:01:17] said you kind of put new wine into old
[2:01:20] bottles you can endow it sometimes hard
[2:01:23] for me to understand before they came a
[2:01:25] missionary generated clothes he said to
[2:01:28] see what bottles and so forth in air oh
[2:01:31] I thought well the bottle what we call a
[2:01:34] bottle it would just wouldn't get all
[2:01:36] the glass bottles regular bottles did
[2:01:38] your custom to see but in a Palestinian
[2:01:41] country and during this time especially
[2:01:43] the bottle the bath then was an animal
[2:01:47] that had to be tanned and so up and tied
[2:01:51] up in places see and the skin contained
[2:01:55] a liquid and so forth they put it in
[2:01:57] water wine and oils and what they
[2:02:00] carried in the skin now when the skin
[2:02:03] became old well it was dry and when
[2:02:07] Jesus is speaking put new wine in old
[2:02:09] bottles they would both perish you would
[2:02:12] lose your wine and lose your bottle now
[2:02:15] you might be able to put water in an old
[2:02:18] bottle but you can't put wine into an
[2:02:21] old bottle because water is the ashes of
[2:02:25] hydrogen and oxygen which remains and so
[2:02:27] forth if anything it windows the way it
[2:02:29] shrinks its substance of water that is
[2:02:32] has no life but it is still see ashes
[2:02:35] and so on and as onaji explains it he
[2:02:38] said but wine has life in it
[2:02:41] and wine what new wine especially it's
[2:02:45] fermenting yet in other words it's still
[2:02:48] moving it's still fermenting it's still
[2:02:50] expanding his all right and he said it
[2:02:53] might spread out a little and he said if
[2:02:55] it goes to pushing in the old bottle and
[2:02:58] he all dry hide it will burst and fly
[2:03:01] open now that he said and then the
[2:03:05] height is ruined and the bottle is see
[2:03:07] the bottles ruined the wine is spilled
[2:03:08] he said now that stuff about the picture
[2:03:12] we have before us today
[2:03:13] you can come to an old form a bunch of
[2:03:17] intellectuals and your ideas and try to
[2:03:20] adopt God's program into your
[2:03:22] intellectual program he said it just
[2:03:25] won't work the old Reich are hide will
[2:03:29] just blow up because it can take it he
[2:03:32] said but now a new bottle here we go
[2:03:35] he said is a new hand high he said in a
[2:03:38] new town heart still has the animal oil
[2:03:41] in the hand he said and then when I knew
[2:03:44] I'd goes into that new bottle and then
[2:03:47] when the new wine begins to swell
[2:03:49] the new bottle kids and the new bottle
[2:03:52] pushes out because it's got oil in it
[2:03:56] Oh alleluia alleluia so we looking for
[2:04:00] new parcels this morning we don't want
[2:04:02] no all halle-loo bottles of your mind
[2:04:05] can't do this and can't do that no no no
[2:04:07] no I knew how to give you a new spare
[2:04:10] I'll put within you a new bottle new
[2:04:14] wine hallelujah hallelujah with life
[2:04:16] inside of it something moving inside of
[2:04:19] its water move inside of you and expand
[2:04:23] a little put your knowledge I begin to
[2:04:26] expand and expand on that new Potter to
[2:04:29] begin to kill to the life of Jesus
[2:04:32] Christ or if God wants to add to your
[2:04:34] fate you can expand a little more that's
[2:04:37] what God's looking point is our Oh
[2:04:39] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:04:42] hallelujah hallelujah whoa then we get
[2:04:45] to take one another form then if you get
[2:04:48] to swell a little and what's inside of
[2:04:50] you gets bigger it gets better it begins
[2:04:53] to look more like Jesus left like the
[2:04:55] world and more like Jesus we will begin
[2:04:58] to take notes that you had been with
[2:05:00] Jesus not just talking about it but your
[2:05:03] life begin to express something that you
[2:05:06] have been with Jesus that you have
[2:05:08] spoken about Jesus that you were there
[2:05:11] when the pillar of fire touch you you
[2:05:13] were there when cause it's only for you
[2:05:16] then you become a witness of God hornier
[2:05:22] [Applause]
[2:05:24] whoo hallelujah oh my
[2:05:31] hallelujah I'm almost finished and it
[2:05:35] ever was a time when the church needs an
[2:05:37] oil in its today a Holy Spirit oiling
[2:05:41] new wine and now when the Bible said
[2:05:44] Jesus is the same yesterday and forever
[2:05:45] his healing powers just as great to be
[2:05:49] as it ever was and the oil intellectuals
[2:05:52] would blow up there's a no such thing
[2:05:54] dr. John said that the days of miracles
[2:05:57] is past that settles it but when new
[2:05:59] wine is put in a new bottle completely
[2:06:02] softly and then when it begins to
[2:06:05] ferment the life begins to work in from
[2:06:09] the old out psychology that we used to
[2:06:12] study and then we see the Word of God in
[2:06:16] its divine promises instead of Jesus
[2:06:19] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:06:20] forever the new wine would say
[2:06:23] hallelujah your bottle will say glory to
[2:06:26] God
[2:06:26] spell out give room that's what we get
[2:06:30] Oh
[2:06:31] hallelujah hallelujah the 11:00 this
[2:06:33] morning whoo hallelujah
[2:06:37] never eat something quick a before we
[2:06:39] close Susie will see Jesus he said a
[2:06:42] Holy Spirit is not a thought it's a
[2:06:44] person when he the Holy Ghost is come
[2:06:47] and he is a personal pronoun so it's
[2:06:50] absolutely it's a person of Christ in
[2:06:54] the form of the Holy Spirit living in
[2:06:57] you jesus said I am the vine you the
