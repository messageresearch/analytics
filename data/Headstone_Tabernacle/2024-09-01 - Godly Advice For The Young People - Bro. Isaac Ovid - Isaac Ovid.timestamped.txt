[46:33] [Music]
[46:37] you know it is a powerful thing when you
[46:40] know that you are in his
[46:43] presence and we could think back in the
[46:46] Old Testament to think that the cloud
[46:49] went by them with them by day and the
[46:52] pillar Fire by night and sometime ago
[46:55] was saying could you imagine somebody
[46:56] going into bar we're going to a party
[46:58] when you look up you see the spill of
[47:00] fire you change your mind right away
[47:03] that was the presence of God and this
[47:05] presence is what he promised to be with
[47:08] us wherever you go am in that presence
[47:12] you can't be cursing
[47:13] swearing uh being filthy mouth or
[47:16] whatever no because you under that
[47:19] presence and your conscious of it you're
[47:22] conscious that this battle is not flesh
[47:24] and blood we have several attacks in all
[47:27] different sicknesses and all kind of
[47:28] attacks in the church but you know what
[47:30] I realized God answer every
[47:32] prayer everyone came out
[47:34] Victorious so we know we are serving a
[47:37] prayer answering God uh tonight so I
[47:41] want to read a scripture you can have
[47:42] your seat I'm not the speaker this
[47:44] morning but Isaac will be speaking to
[47:45] you this morning but just before he come
[47:47] I just fell let to share something
[47:48] before he come before he comes and the
[47:51] men this is from Genesis 18 verse 16 and
[47:55] the men rose up then and look toward
[47:56] Sodom
[47:57] this is after the angel came to speak to
[48:00] Abraham and Sarah about having that son
[48:02] Isaac and Abraham went with them to
[48:04] bring them on the way and the Lord said
[48:06] unto Abraham shall I hi from Abraham the
[48:09] thing which I do now judgment was coming
[48:14] so he's going to reveal what he's about
[48:16] to do seeing that Abraham shall surely
[48:20] become a great and mighty nation and all
[48:22] the nations of the Earth shall be
[48:23] blessed in him list is for what God
[48:26] knows for I know
[48:29] him I know him that he will command his
[48:36] children and his household after him and
[48:40] they shall keep the way of the Lord to
[48:43] do justice and judgment that the Lord
[48:46] may bring upon Abraham that which he had
[48:49] spoken of him so it wasn't like God gave
[48:52] him a promise and everything working in
[48:54] an automatic Channel I know him am I
[48:57] know him and I know what he will
[49:01] do does God know what you will do you
[49:04] can't be sitting and staring and just
[49:06] expecting to work out you have to be in
[49:10] a channel that you could get the
[49:12] revelation of what God wants you to do
[49:15] and the Lord said because of the Cry of
[49:17] Sodom and Gomorrah is great because
[49:19] their sin is very Grievious I will go
[49:21] down and see whether they have done all
[49:23] together according to the Cry of it
[49:25] which is come unto me and and if not I
[49:27] will know now Paul when he wrote the
[49:31] scripture in Ephesians 6 to and obey
[49:33] your parents Paul was connected to a
[49:36] word that was given Exodus
[49:38] 20:12 and that scripture in Exodus 20
[49:41] says honor thy father and thy mother
[49:43] that thy days may be long upon the land
[49:46] which the Lord thy God giveth thee it
[49:49] didn't say your father and mother have
[49:50] to be a
[49:53] Christian it didn't say that it didn't
[49:56] say a mother father have to be Believers
[49:58] it did not say that it say honor which
[50:01] is to give respect
[50:02] unto and the the level of that is that
[50:05] your days may be
[50:08] long in the land which the Lord thy God
[50:10] give thee now Ephesians 6 that reference
[50:13] point we was talking about here where
[50:15] Paul draw from Exodus 2012 he said
[50:18] children obey your parents in the Lord
[50:20] for this is
[50:22] right honor thy father and thy mother
[50:24] which is the first commandment with
[50:26] promise amen that it may be well with
[50:28] thee and thou may live long on the earth
[50:31] and he fathers provoke not your children
[50:34] to rat but bring them up in the nurture
[50:38] and the admonish of the
[50:40] Lord so you see parenting is a great
[50:43] thing whether you have children or not
[50:46] you raise anybody it come like you a
[50:49] parent because you're molding and
[50:51] shaping a life a child a son a daughter
[50:55] you may be molding and shaping a future
[50:57] preacher Pastor Prophet King prime
[50:59] minister you don't know who but son to
[51:02] God okay now the Amplified in this
[51:04] Ephesians 6 says children obey your
[51:06] parents in the Lord as his
[51:09] representatives for this is just and
[51:12] right honor esteem and value as precious
[51:18] your father and your mother this is the
[51:21] first commandment with a promise that
[51:23] all may be well with you and that you
[51:25] may live long on the earth fathers do
[51:28] not irritate and provoke your children
[51:30] to anger they want baby you rock them
[51:33] you put bottle and you know and shake
[51:35] them and so on afterwards them little
[51:36] toddlers start to walk and talk and
[51:38] start to tell you back things and
[51:40] afterwards they start to get your height
[51:42] and they recognize wait a minute you no
[51:44] longer have a child you have a young
[51:46] woman or a young man the Bible says and
[51:48] and and our objective as parents is to
[51:50] bring them to maturity that they could
[51:53] leave and cleave
[51:56] that we overshadow them and we keep well
[51:58] I don't want to use that word um in the
[52:01] business
[52:03] then you know what talking about so so
[52:06] the object is to bring these little guys
[52:10] these little men and women because them
[52:12] big men and woman in small form flip the
[52:15] script and see it
[52:16] different child baby yeah is that right
[52:21] that is a big man and a big woman in
[52:24] baby form just put time on them see Gan
[52:28] preach God has dropped time drop 20
[52:30] years and a 6month old baby and you get
[52:33] 20 years and six months that no child
[52:36] for this cause shall a man leave his
[52:39] mother and father and cleave to his wife
[52:42] if he's not a man he should stay
[52:45] home that's rough this
[52:47] morning all right okay so this I want to
[52:52] get to but Isaac get ready he's ready
[52:56] fathers do not irritate and provoke your
[52:58] children to anger do not exasperate them
[53:02] to resentment but read them tenderly in
[53:06] the training and discipline and the
[53:09] counsel and admonish of the
[53:15] Lord don't beat them into torment and
[53:18] beat licks you know me
[53:27] but there is no admonishing there's no
[53:29] counsel there's no teaching because lots
[53:31] of time they don't even know and that's
[53:33] why sometime I ask children to forgive
[53:35] their parents because their parents are
[53:37] doing the best that they can and they
[53:39] did it with the knowledge that they had
[53:41] at that time we in an advanced age and
[53:43] you get the opportunity to learn more
[53:45] but this is the point I want to get to
[53:46] something I said in the prayer meeting
[53:48] it is easier to raise a son right than
[53:52] to break fix a broken man am all the
[53:58] pains and struggle in raising these
[54:00] little sometime we call them Rascals but
[54:03] raising these little guys that may be
[54:07] sometimes really challenging sometimes
[54:09] it is worth
[54:10] it for the for it for us to get it right
[54:13] while they are young than to fix broken
[54:16] men the world today is littered with
[54:18] broken men we had enough of that Abraham
[54:22] God said I know him and he will teach
[54:26] his children
[54:27] God help us this morning that we could
[54:29] effectively keep our children our
[54:31] grandchildren that they would grow up to
[54:33] be broken men because broken men will
[54:35] have broken homes broken hes broken
[54:37] family and the devil will have his way
[54:39] but God promised to restore the balance
[54:42] God promised to restore right thinking
[54:45] right approach praise God that you could
[54:47] love fatherhood love parenting a
[54:50] privilege for God to bless you to be a
[54:52] parent and you have to know what you're
[54:54] raising there are some people they love
[54:55] when they reach 18 to say they not
[54:58] responsible no more they're 18 years old
[55:01] no no no no no what if God did us that
[55:04] we are still learning we are still
[55:06] growing praise God you s you saw you had

[59:09] comments amen how blessed are
[59:13] we amen so while you're standing if you
[59:16] would turn with me to three portions of
[59:20] scripture uh we're going to read from
[59:22] the books of
[59:23] Proverbs and the Book of Psalms
[59:27] reading firstly from Proverbs
[59:32] 12 I'm going to read one verse
[59:36] there
[59:37] verse
[59:40] 15 Proverbs 12 verse 15 the way of a
[59:45] fool is right in his own
[59:50] eyes but he that
[59:52] hearkeneth unto counsel
[59:56] is wise and reading for Proverbs
[1:00:02] 19 and reading verse
[1:00:07] 20 hear
[1:00:09] counsel and receive
[1:00:12] instruction that thou mayest be wise in
[1:00:15] thy latter
[1:00:17] end there are many devices in a man's
[1:00:21] heart
[1:00:22] nevertheless the counsel of the Lord
[1:00:26] that shall stand amen and reading Psalm
[1:00:31] 1 very familiar scripture Psalm 1 verse
[1:00:36] 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:00:40] the counsel of the
[1:00:42] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:00:46] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:00:51] scornful Brothers I know I just give you
[1:00:53] that one verse but I'm going to continue
[1:00:55] but his light is in the law of the Lord
[1:00:58] and in his law that he meditate day and
[1:01:01] night and he shall be like a tree
[1:01:04] planteth by the rivers of water that
[1:01:07] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[1:01:09] his Leaf also shall not wither and
[1:01:13] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the
[1:01:16] ungodly are not so but are like the
[1:01:18] chaff which the Wind Drive it away
[1:01:21] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[1:01:24] the Judgment nor sinners in the
[1:01:26] congregation of the righteous for the
[1:01:29] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[1:01:32] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[1:01:35] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[1:01:36] reading of his word can we bow our heads
[1:01:38] for word of prayer our gracious Heavenly
[1:01:41] Father we thank you this morning to be
[1:01:43] in your house Lord to be able to thank
[1:01:45] you and to acknowledge your sovereignty

[1:01:52] woke us up this morning Lord you put
[1:01:56] Lord breath on our lips father life and
[1:01:58] strength in us that we could come and
[1:02:00] gather in your house father to hear Lord
[1:02:02] not from man but hear a word from you
[1:02:05] just one word from you is more than
[1:02:08] enough to deal with situations confusion
[1:02:11] conflict and issues and father if there
[1:02:13] ever was an hour where we need a word
[1:02:15] from you it's now father there are so
[1:02:17] many voices the prophet said so many
[1:02:20] people speaking so many influences on

[1:03:13] children and how the enemy throughout
[1:03:15] scripture has always attacked the young

[1:03:20] born there was an edict to to kill and
[1:03:22] to slay when Moses was to be born there
[1:03:24] was an edict to kill and to slay and the

[1:09:24] strength every trial every test God
[1:09:27] wrote your name on it it's not by
[1:09:30] accident God is creating something out
[1:09:32] of your trials he is creating something
[1:09:35] out of the pressure listen it doesn't
[1:09:37] feel good to be under the
[1:09:40] pressure it doesn't feel good but it's
[1:09:42] going to be

[1:10:14] to change your molecular your chemical
[1:10:16] balance
[1:10:18] and and when you smile in the midst of

[1:10:36] in other words straighten yourself up
[1:10:38] organize yourself stand up better than
[1:10:40] that I call it for a purpose I know
[1:10:43] things rough but G your loins like a man
[1:10:46] Shake Yourself stand up straight lift
[1:10:48] your head up I know you have bills to
[1:10:50] pay but he is Jehovah Gyra G your Lo
[1:10:53] like a man
[1:10:57] I know there's trouble in the home but
[1:10:59] let's invite Jesus into your home to
[1:11:01] deal with the trouble in your home
[1:11:03] anybody with me this
[1:11:04] morning oh I'm trying to take it easy
[1:11:07] just before I came up but always say
[1:11:08] take it
[1:11:10] easy
[1:11:12] hallelujah hallelujah I can't wait to
[1:11:14] give up this P house you know this this
[1:11:16] body has limitations but immortality is
[1:11:18] locked up inside of us a body change is
[1:11:21] locked up inside of us and that's what
[1:11:24] the devil is trying to stop you from
[1:11:25] from becoming who you
[1:11:30] are you may be
[1:11:34] seated so by the grace of God this
[1:11:36] morning I'm I'm not trying to preach to
[1:11:40] you in that sense this morning really
[1:11:43] want to have a conversation with
[1:11:45] you so for a title this morning it's
[1:11:47] Godly advice for the young
[1:11:51] people that's my title this morning
[1:11:54] Godly advice
[1:11:56] for the young people amen one time brov
[1:12:00] was preaching and he said we'll sa from
[1:12:02] the pulpit things your father never told
[1:12:05] you things your mother never told you
[1:12:07] because the word is very clear about
[1:12:09] certain things and within the context of
[1:12:13] where we stand with the gravity of
[1:12:16] understanding of the fullness of this
[1:12:17] message there are things that are very
[1:12:18] clear that is brought in
[1:12:21] scripture and Beyond what is brought in
[1:12:24] scripture God through his grace and love
[1:12:26] sent a prophet to provide Clarity to tie
[1:12:28] up all the Loose Ends that was not
[1:12:30] covered by
[1:12:31] scripture and then there are elements if
[1:12:34] you look back to question and answers
[1:12:35] when people went to the prophet with
[1:12:37] questions he said come talk to me
[1:12:38] afterwards about that because he didn't
[1:12:40] want to make certain things Doctrine and
[1:12:43] he wanted to deal with situations as
[1:12:44] they come but there are things that are
[1:12:45] very clear to us with how we should live
[1:12:47] and how we should behave and there are
[1:12:49] people that many times say well are
[1:12:51] trying to have the Victory and I can't
[1:12:52] find the victory but the reality is
[1:12:55] there's a relationship that God expects
[1:12:57] for us for us to have
[1:12:58] Victory he told Joshua meditate on the
[1:13:01] word day and night and you'll have good
[1:13:03] success Joshua's success was connected
[1:13:06] directly to his meditation on the word
[1:13:08] day and night so we can't expect to
[1:13:10] serve God in a halfway kind of way and
[1:13:13] expect God to work for us in a full-time
[1:13:15] kind of way because God is not a a chain
[1:13:17] your wear and your neck and something
[1:13:19] you hang up in your house and you have a
[1:13:20] picture in your house and you look at it
[1:13:22] before you walk out and you expect
[1:13:24] things to work out when you want to live
[1:13:25] any old kind of
[1:13:28] life so I'm here this morning to
[1:13:30] encourage us and to give you some Godly
[1:13:33] advice for the young
[1:13:35] people amen we read some scriptures
[1:13:39] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:13:42] the counsel this word counsel is
[1:13:46] advice amen there are people who give us
[1:13:49] good advice and the people who give us
[1:13:52] bad
[1:13:53] advice you have to know
[1:13:57] difference but blessed is the man that
[1:14:00] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:14:03] ungodly this is not just a young people
[1:14:06] thing you know because many of us take
[1:14:08] counsel from the wrong places we have
[1:14:11] wives who take counsel from other women
[1:14:12] who cannot help
[1:14:15] them we have husbands who take counsel
[1:14:17] from people who are
[1:14:20] ungodly and it wrecks marriages parents
[1:14:23] take counsel from people who are not
[1:14:25] qualified to give counsel and their
[1:14:27] children have borne the
[1:14:31] fruit and we have young people who take
[1:14:34] bad
[1:14:36] advice people make decisions without
[1:14:39] good advice there's good advice and
[1:14:41] there's bad
[1:14:43] advice the Bible said there's safety in
[1:14:46] councel there's protection in councel
[1:14:49] there's a reason there are
[1:14:51] counselors the Bible said in the
[1:14:53] multitude of counselors there is safety
[1:14:56] where are you getting your advice from
[1:14:59] and if there is advice in the word for
[1:15:01] us to live and how to live then how do
[1:15:04] we connect into that so we can have
[1:15:05] success and peace of mind and and
[1:15:08] victory and overcome because God wants
[1:15:10] us to be successful in life and in
[1:15:14] godliness everybody with me I'm not
[1:15:17] preaching this morning having a
[1:15:19] conversation this
[1:15:20] morning with a burden as we go into
[1:15:23] school that we ref nect the kingdom of
[1:15:26] God you're not going to school for your
[1:15:32] parents in the same way you don't work
[1:15:34] just because you have a job the Bible
[1:15:36] says when you go to work work for the
[1:15:38] Lord anybody with me so I've said it
[1:15:41] many times no Christian has a right to
[1:15:44] say well I go to the man walk and I do
[1:15:46] the man walk that's not scriptural leave
[1:15:49] that for ungodly who don't have access
[1:15:51] to the word I don't care how rough your
[1:15:53] job is pray for God to give you better
[1:15:55] job but while you're in the job you're
[1:15:57] working onto
[1:16:00] the so there is an expectation of a
[1:16:03] spirit of Excellence because God is
[1:16:06] demanding Excellence from us as his
[1:16:09] ambassadors on the earth we are
[1:16:11] representing a kingdom that's in the
[1:16:14] natural and in the spiritual and by the
[1:16:17] same token the expectation of God is
[1:16:20] when you go to school you do well in
[1:16:21] school
[1:16:25] this is a different kind of service
[1:16:28] H because God doesn't accept mediocrity
[1:16:31] God is not settled with average I know
[1:16:34] everybody that an engineer and a doctor
[1:16:36] and a whatever but if you're a carpenter
[1:16:38] and you studying wwor you better be the
[1:16:40] best word worker that ever passed
[1:16:42] through that program I don't care what
[1:16:44] the course is whatever you do you're
[1:16:47] doing it unto the Lord you're doing it
[1:16:49] to reflect your kingdom your parents can
[1:16:52] get some secondary credit but the first
[1:16:54] credit is to the
[1:16:58] Lord you may be seated that's why
[1:17:00] brother brandom said if you want to be a
[1:17:02] bum be the best bum let people know the
[1:17:05] best bum walking on Frederick Street
[1:17:07] when they see see that man's a bum with
[1:17:10] distinction he said go to the dirtiest
[1:17:12] garbage can don't just take any kind of
[1:17:14] garbage
[1:17:16] can find the dirtiest one say no no no
[1:17:18] leave that one what I coming for because
[1:17:20] I want the best best God wants you to be
[1:17:23] the best at what you do there's no
[1:17:25] exception to
[1:17:27] that that's the mindset anyone who has
[1:17:30] achieved anything in this world believe
[1:17:32] they could achieve
[1:17:34] greatness how much more us who have
[1:17:37] accessed to the word where God said it
[1:17:39] was good it was good it was good it was
[1:17:42] good he did a perfect job on the first
[1:17:44] day it was good there was nothing else
[1:17:46] to fix there was nothing to improve on
[1:17:48] there was nothing he could have done
[1:17:50] better he was satisfied that when he
[1:17:52] finished on the first day it was good
[1:17:56] and you should be satisfied when it
[1:17:58] finish first year second year oh
[1:18:01] somebody preach back to me standard one
[1:18:03] standard
[1:18:06] five you may be seated but say haven't
[1:18:09] done all to stand stand in other words
[1:18:11] having done everything you could do do
[1:18:13] it to the best of your
[1:18:16] ability maybe some of you here this in
[1:18:18] your home I don't know but I'm letting
[1:18:20] you know the expectation of the word for
[1:18:23] both life and godliness because we are
[1:18:26] challenged to walk and be perfect be
[1:18:29] therefore perfect as your father in
[1:18:31] Heaven is perfect how your father
[1:18:33] tolerated it or your grandfather
[1:18:35] tolerated it it's not God's
[1:18:39] expectation we have a lot of work to do
[1:18:42] to be the best that we could be people
[1:18:44] must wonder what's your motivation and
[1:18:47] you must tell them I'm representing a
[1:18:50] kingdom let them wonder why your work
[1:18:53] ethic is that way let them Wonder why
[1:18:55] you approach school that way let them
[1:18:56] wonder why you approach life that
[1:19:03] way this is all part of the word
[1:19:05] [Applause]
[1:19:09] know when Elijah tell jasi go and look
[1:19:11] for to see what s see he come say I see
[1:19:13] anything he said go and write the exam
[1:19:15] again until I see
[1:19:16] something after seven time he come see a
[1:19:19] small sign I small like a man's hand and
[1:19:21] I know it's going to rain because Elijah
[1:19:24] had the next expectation of what was
[1:19:27] next so as you approach school as you
[1:19:30] approach University Secondary School
[1:19:32] your job whatever it might look like
[1:19:34] there is an expectation of Excellence
[1:19:36] that God
[1:19:38] [Applause]
[1:19:40] expects you are fearfully and
[1:19:42] wonderfully made he take time to work on
[1:19:45] you he take time to refine you your
[1:19:48] personality is unique there's nobody
[1:19:50] like you there was never there was never
[1:19:52] anybody like you before there will never
[1:19:54] be anybody after this like you nobody
[1:19:57] can ever replace you God put you here
[1:19:59] with a purpose that nobody else could
[1:20:02] do anybody with me this
[1:20:05] morning I told a different kind of
[1:20:07] service this
[1:20:10] morning so stop trying to be a photocopy
[1:20:13] of somebody else you are an
[1:20:16] original there is nobody like
[1:20:20] you nobody can ever be you
[1:20:24] but BR preach the message Oddball you're

[1:20:34] school in your job you're different
[1:20:36] you're shape different you hide
[1:20:37] different you talk different you look
[1:20:41] different anybody with me this
[1:20:46] morning I'm not preaching on deep mystry
[1:20:48] I preaching the mystery of who you
[1:20:51] are that God took time to put you here
[1:20:54] in this age the worst age the hardest
[1:20:57] age the age where the most filt the age
[1:21:00] where the L of hell is uncovered and
[1:21:02] demon powers
[1:21:07] moving everybody God put before couldn't
[1:21:10] handle
[1:21:12] listen young people brother Ram stood on
[1:21:14] this Earth and say shoot the
[1:21:20] TV somebody asked me the other day if I
[1:21:23] ever see the hook Cooking Channel
[1:21:25] something
[1:21:27] TV cooking ask
[1:21:37] about but now it worse everybody walk
[1:21:41] with a TV in the
[1:21:43] pocket start to shoot the
[1:21:48] phones but it shows that the enemy is
[1:21:51] not static
[1:21:56] the devil is staying in 1950 1960 1980
[1:22:00] he's
[1:22:01] moving finding interesting and creative
[1:22:05] ways that's why the Bible say knowledge
[1:22:06] will increase this whole AI thing has is
[1:22:08] a multi-dimensional thing people have
[1:22:11] information so much information they
[1:22:13] feel they're Invincible they feel they
[1:22:16] can figure life out they don't want no
[1:22:18] advice they don't want to hear what
[1:22:18] their parents say because their parents
[1:22:20] don't already know what they're going
[1:22:22] [Applause]
[1:22:23] through
[1:22:25] H you know how many people live with the
[1:22:27] regret of not taking good
[1:22:30] advice and when you sit on on them and
[1:22:33] you and that's why they said it's better
[1:22:34] to go to the house of
[1:22:37] mourning than in the house of laughter
[1:22:39] people pay money to go into comedy
[1:22:41] houses you know because they want to
[1:22:43] laugh and they forget what going on in
[1:22:44] real life and say laugh they laugh they
[1:22:46] forget the bills they forget the
[1:22:47] mortgage they forget the bank
[1:22:49] call they
[1:22:51] laugh laughing is not a bad thing is a
[1:22:54] sort of therapy that's great but you
[1:22:56] have the life to contend with the
[1:22:58] reality after you smoke you drink you do
[1:23:00] all you do you still have life and you
[1:23:02] to deal with apart from life is you you
[1:23:04] and
[1:23:06] life I said to somebody the other day
[1:23:09] life just life in right
[1:23:11] now it's like trial and then if you
[1:23:14] couldn't taught a next trial could fit
[1:23:15] in God just slip in the next
[1:23:18] [Applause]
[1:23:21] one somebody told me when they get some
[1:23:24] news said I done I can't take how much
[1:23:27] more you can
[1:23:29] take life is tough stress the more
[1:23:35] issues I saw somebody do a short video
[1:23:37] the other day they have reached too high
[1:23:39] in the corporate ladder because they sit
[1:23:42] on the desk on this ping ping ping ping
[1:23:44] ping ping message message message
[1:23:45] message they can't catch yourself they
[1:23:46] say they need to go back down one
[1:23:48] step because they didn't expect so much
[1:23:50] to happen at that high be
[1:23:52] ladder and God wants to Elevate you to a
[1:23:55] position of power and authority it means
[1:23:57] what you might consider to be tough
[1:23:59] right now when David's dealing with the
[1:24:01] line and a beer when he have to me go Li
[1:24:03] he recognize what you already been
[1:24:04] prepared for so I want to encourage you
[1:24:07] church that you need to change your
[1:24:10] mindset the Bible said be transformed by
[1:24:12] the renewing of your mind some of us our
[1:24:14] computers have viruses on
[1:24:18] it
[1:24:20] malware outdated operating system
[1:24:24] and our thinking is from 10 years ago 20
[1:24:28] years ago the world is moving so fast
[1:24:29] you can't even think how it was two
[1:24:31] years ago anymore God hasn't changed but
[1:24:33] the world where we living in is changed
[1:24:34] you have to be aware of what's going on
[1:24:36] in your
[1:24:40] home what our children watch on YouTube
[1:24:43] what they watch on the internet what
[1:24:44] they interact with is the devil at work
[1:24:47] coordinating the movies and the
[1:24:49] messaging and the narrative the whole
[1:24:51] lgbtq agenda and all these things
[1:24:54] being subtly moved into media moved into
[1:24:58] school books moved into the teaching
[1:24:59] room moved
[1:25:02] into you can't sit down and say Well it
[1:25:04] going work out how how it going to work
[1:25:06] out are you praying more are you having
[1:25:09] the right conversation are you asking

[1:25:31] different things here and we see how the
[1:25:32] Lord will lead the Bible said
[1:25:35] flee also youthful
[1:25:38] lust now this is
[1:25:40] not just directed at young
[1:25:47] people youthful lust anybody get caught
[1:25:49] up in youthful lust know they have
[1:25:50] parents here who ignoring the
[1:25:51] responsibility but they caught up in
[1:25:52] youthful lust
[1:25:55] amen but follow righteousness Faith
[1:25:58] charity peace with them that call on the
[1:25:59] Lord out of a Pure
[1:26:05] Heart church young people we must hate
[1:26:08] the things that God
[1:26:12] hates we cannot mix
[1:26:14] up this tolerance move with you
[1:26:17] tolerating
[1:26:20] foolishness it's either God is God or
[1:26:22] he's not God it's either something is
[1:26:24] right or something is wrong and no
[1:26:25] matter how old somebody is because my
[1:26:27] daughter is 5 years old and she know
[1:26:28] what is right and
[1:26:30] wrong she know when we say don't do
[1:26:33] something when she do it and she she
[1:26:34] hiding to do it the reason you hid in oh
[1:26:37] who teach her to
[1:26:40] hide there was no hiding class she
[1:26:42] signed up for she hide because she know
[1:26:44] she got an instruction don't do that who
[1:26:46] taught Adam to
[1:26:48] hide Adam Adam where I feel
[1:26:53] hiding there was no hiding course there
[1:26:55] was no hiding graduation he just hid
[1:26:57] because he knew it was
[1:26:58] wrong so why we have to repeat the same
[1:27:01] thing over and over dress properly stay
[1:27:03] away from Shady places stay away from
[1:27:06] foolishness don't get yourself into a
[1:27:07] situation where you have to be be trying
[1:27:10] to to to no no no why you putting
[1:27:12] yourself there brothers sisters let's be
[1:27:15] careful with these
[1:27:18] things listen to The
[1:27:21] Prophet Samson got into Bad Company
[1:27:26] half of the issues with young people is
[1:27:28] who you spend time
[1:27:32] with Samson got into Bad
[1:27:36] Company and you can always remember that
[1:27:38] when you are in Bad Company you are out
[1:27:41] of the will of
[1:27:42] God years ago I said to the young people
[1:27:45] there's a difference between your
[1:27:46] friends and
[1:27:48] Associates there are people you
[1:27:49] associated with in school on the job on
[1:27:51] the neighborhood in the grocery that's
[1:27:53] associate that can be your
[1:27:56] friend because Jus say except your
[1:27:58] forsake mother father brother even
[1:28:00] family for this
[1:28:03] cause so as you approach this New Year
[1:28:06] check your
[1:28:07] company but Bram goes on my old southern
[1:28:09] mommy used to tell me if you lay down
[1:28:11] with a dog that's got fleas you'll get
[1:28:13] up with the
[1:28:14] fleas that's rather a rude expression
[1:28:17] but it's got a lot of common everyday
[1:28:19] sense to it you just can't associate
[1:28:22] yourself with the things of the world
[1:28:23] and expect to stay spiritual and humble
[1:28:27] before the Lord You're known by your
[1:28:29] company there's an old saying show me
[1:28:31] your company and I'll tell you who you
[1:28:36] are so some of us we need to learn to
[1:28:38] walk
[1:28:42] alone and we really have no excuse and
[1:28:45] I've said this before for everybody who
[1:28:46] have an excuse with this or that there's
[1:28:48] somebody who will the same story
[1:28:51] overcome I preached before there was a
[1:28:53] young man I forget what country it was
[1:28:54] had no electricity and he made the front
[1:28:57] page of a World magazine because he's
[1:28:59] sitting on on the street under the
[1:29:00] street light to study and he pass all
[1:29:02] his exams money flooded from all around
[1:29:04] the world because he showed what was in
[1:29:06] him was more than a situation he had to
[1:29:08] deal with so for those who say I have no
[1:29:11] electricity look the example of somebody
[1:29:13] with no elri and how they
[1:29:17] overcame there is no
[1:29:20] excuse I don't know if I'm going to get
[1:29:22] into all of it but you know the Bible is
[1:29:24] a book about young
[1:29:28] people joash was the youngest king ag7
[1:29:32] he went to the throne seven and
[1:29:33] know Josiah was 8 years old know David
[1:29:37] was between 15 to 17 around there when
[1:29:39] he F fight gol you
[1:29:43] know Daniel was a teenager you
[1:29:47] know this world is driven by young
[1:29:49] people Mary was in her late teens you
[1:29:51] know
[1:29:56] you have to make a choice of what you
[1:29:58] want to stand for or just get rolled
[1:30:00] around by the Water of
[1:30:04] Life and listen Daniel's parents would
[1:30:06] have been killed you know so Daniel had
[1:30:09] no parents to lean on my parents had do
[1:30:13] for
[1:30:14] me Daniel made a choice and not eat the
[1:30:17] king's meet it was his decision because
[1:30:21] enough was locked up in him to know how
[1:30:22] he wanted to live amen what's what's our
[1:30:28] excuse Esther in the Bible she had no
[1:30:30] parent but she had her family her
[1:30:33] uncle who gave her advice who is giving
[1:30:36] you advice whether it's your parents a
[1:30:39] family member somebody in church you
[1:30:41] have to connect to the right person to
[1:30:43] help you make the right
[1:30:50] decision but the B piece of message come
[1:30:53] follow me I'm just talking to you I'm
[1:30:54] going to get into a few things we have
[1:30:56] some time today right and then we're
[1:30:58] going to pray for the young people and
[1:31:00] he teaches before they go to school but
[1:31:02] the Brandon PRI M say come follow me and
[1:31:04] in this he said I think the word come
[1:31:06] follow me that would be the best advice
[1:31:09] I could give if I was talking to 10,000
[1:31:11] kids or if I was just talking to just
[1:31:13] what I am it's a command and the
[1:31:15] greatest thing that I think was ever
[1:31:17] offered anybody and especially a young
[1:31:19] person follow me you're going to follow
[1:31:22] somebody you can remember that you're
[1:31:24] going to follow somebody and the way you
[1:31:27] follow the person be sure who this
[1:31:29] person is
[1:31:31] following listen to the prophet in the
[1:31:33] same message you make yourself when
[1:31:35] you're
[1:31:40] young that is why parents we have to
[1:31:42] fight to get our young children young
[1:31:45] people into the atmosphere it could be
[1:31:47] it a no compromis position because you
[1:31:50] make yourself when you're young you set
[1:31:53] your Ambitions to what you want to do
[1:31:56] and what you're trying to achieve in
[1:31:59] life that's why the Bible say train up a
[1:32:01] child in a way he should go so when he
[1:32:02] gets older he will not depart from
[1:32:05] it there's a lot of responsibility being
[1:32:08] placed here this
[1:32:09] morning we preach a mage days go have we
[1:32:12] done enough this autopilot mindset well
[1:32:15] is he Sunday school is he school teacher
[1:32:17] is he principal is the education system
[1:32:19] is the government is the pastor is
[1:32:20] everybody and everybody this who I want
[1:32:22] to preach and blame
[1:32:24] responsibility because the moment thing
[1:32:26] fell sou in the garden of Edom Adam say
[1:32:28] it wasn't me it was the
[1:32:29] woman and it wasn't me it was the
[1:32:31] serpant and then he had nobody else to
[1:32:34] blame blame versus responsibility and I
[1:32:37] can look at it on every side because for
[1:32:39] the parents who could do more shame on
[1:32:42] you but for the children who sit downst
[1:32:45] when my parent didn't do enough shame on
[1:32:47] you too because you are you have access
[1:32:49] to enough like Daniel to make the right
[1:32:52] decisions amen
[1:32:54] and if you don't know you can ask the
[1:32:56] question to the right
[1:32:57] person am I making sense this
[1:33:00] morning so there's a mission and mandate
[1:33:02] he have no excuses you know when people
[1:33:05] have seen come and go people who I could
[1:33:07] achieve this and then they just fall
[1:33:09] flat on their
[1:33:10] face and they realize money it is not
[1:33:12] happiness getting a wife is that
[1:33:14] happiness getting a girlfriend is that
[1:33:16] happiness getting a job when when I get
[1:33:18] a job I going be happy and no happiness
[1:33:20] there
[1:33:24] over the last few weeks I've had the
[1:33:25] opportunity to go in the hospital almost
[1:33:27] 10 days and I was sharing brother over
[1:33:29] it it was one of the most traumatic
[1:33:33] experiences just to walk and to see
[1:33:36] people in
[1:33:39] pain it's a long time I have not to walk
[1:33:41] to the hospital day after day and see
[1:33:44] people literally screaming
[1:33:48] balling looking for Relief stressed
[1:33:52] out and I see members in ter where
[1:33:54] people lives interrupted people would
[1:33:56] have had plans and the plans interrupted
[1:33:58] because this happened that happened and
[1:34:00] it brings a level of sensitivity of the
[1:34:02] grace of God to us and your life that
[1:34:05] you here be here in the house of the
[1:34:06] Lord this
[1:34:07] morning because there are people in a
[1:34:09] hospital who wish it could be somewhere
[1:34:11] else and we might say to ourselves well
[1:34:14] I wish I could have be here and my
[1:34:15] friends going this and my friends doing
[1:34:17] this and you don't understand what their
[1:34:18] end is what their road is what their
[1:34:20] destination is
[1:34:25] but say love to get us desperate
[1:34:27] conditions will I don't want to have to
[1:34:29] read conditions I don't want you you
[1:34:31] have to break your foot for you to
[1:34:33] repent and Things Fall Apart and you say
[1:34:35] well Lord are ready now because you
[1:34:36] can't ready go any party anymore so
[1:34:38] you're ready
[1:34:40] ready some of us God we so stubborn God
[1:34:43] had to break us shut us down to hear the
[1:34:47] still Small Voice why let it reach a
[1:34:49] point of crisis
[1:34:53] you see people sit on in church and they
[1:34:55] hear the word and they hear the word and
[1:34:56] they're shouting and you see them on the
[1:34:57] street and it's like how you dress
[1:34:59] so you was in church on
[1:35:02] Sunday that's why say you can preach the
[1:35:04] blue in the
[1:35:06] face but something has to be revealed to
[1:35:09] you how much time and the old people I
[1:35:13] don't know if I don't is this happening
[1:35:16] anybody the old say who don't hear does
[1:35:18] how to
[1:35:21] feel what wrong with this generation
[1:35:23] when you look at the news and the
[1:35:25] media the exam results from C or
[1:35:28] whatever they just had was one of the
[1:35:29] worst in years what is
[1:35:31] happening it have ai it have chat GPT it
[1:35:34] have thing and people so on social media
[1:35:38] and entertainment they can't even pass
[1:35:40] basic
[1:35:48] exams but over preached it a couple
[1:35:50] weeks ago if you don't know something
[1:35:51] it's your fault to know because YouTube
[1:35:52] teach you to make everything
[1:35:55] you want to make fried rice it
[1:36:00] day and if you can't read the recipe
[1:36:03] thing it have courses on how to read so
[1:36:04] you can read that first do that first
[1:36:05] and then read the
[1:36:11] recipe most people and it's embarrassing
[1:36:14] for us as Believers how much time we
[1:36:16] spend on
[1:36:17] Facebook and talking things that make no
[1:36:20] sense we know all kind of thing about
[1:36:21] everything else but what's important
[1:36:24] when you study successful people before
[1:36:26] get into the spiritual realm of it
[1:36:28] successful people do they they have no
[1:36:30] time for social
[1:36:32] media I have sat in rooms with people
[1:36:35] who teach in business and they say make
[1:36:37] sure you don't have Facebook and these
[1:36:38] things because it's not helping you
[1:36:39] achieve what you're going if the
[1:36:41] activities you do daily not drive your
[1:36:43] success what why why you doing
[1:36:47] it because people liveing know 24 hours
[1:36:49] in a day and if you check your phone 3
[1:36:51] hours on Facebook 2 hours on Instagram 4
[1:36:53] hours on WhatsApp what whatever that
[1:36:55] looks like you have all kind of thing
[1:36:57] you're
[1:36:59] doing I don't like to read it have AUD
[1:37:01] your
[1:37:02] books what is the
[1:37:07] excuse I hope this help us to
[1:37:09] recalibrate things and have some open
[1:37:11] and honest conversation in our
[1:37:14] homes because the children we have now
[1:37:16] don't even know about the prophet the
[1:37:18] way they did 10 15 20 years ago who's
[1:37:20] responsible for that what is happening
[1:37:22] in your homes that that children don't
[1:37:24] know the prophet
[1:37:26] voice can I drive to your house this
[1:37:30] morning what is your daily discipline
[1:37:33] weekly discipline monthly discipline to
[1:37:36] achieve success in every aspect of your
[1:37:40] life you know all the politics you
[1:37:43] tracking the US election better than the
[1:37:44] Americans I could see that here in
[1:37:48] tran you know the whole lineup for the
[1:37:50] Democrats the whole lineup for the
[1:37:51] Republicans you know the 9 things Trump
[1:37:54] did right the 29 things he did
[1:38:00] wrong but you don't know what's
[1:38:02] happening in your own home
[1:38:10] am young people know about the
[1:38:13] influencers the entertainers the singers
[1:38:16] the sports personalities the Olympics
[1:38:18] you miss a match you miss a game this
[1:38:20] your thing
[1:38:24] I telling you do
[1:38:27] how you Prophet us to go and Hunt I'm
[1:38:30] not a hunter you're not going to catch
[1:38:31] me doing
[1:38:32] that but make sure in all that you're
[1:38:34] doing you putting God
[1:38:38] first and this is not an exam that you
[1:38:40] have to pass for the pastor or the
[1:38:42] assistant pastor this is you making sure
[1:38:44] you put God first how much time if you
[1:38:47] were to analyze most phones now tell you
[1:38:49] how you spend your time when the day
[1:38:50] comes if you were tracking your prayer
[1:38:53] life
[1:38:56] is it 5 minutes a day 10 minutes a day
[1:38:57] 20 minutes a day you know John Wesley
[1:39:00] mom it was us to pre pray 4 hours a
[1:39:04] day not a half an hour you know not at 5
[1:39:08] minutes you
[1:39:11] know and I can tell if you have a prayer
[1:39:14] life give it the M pray say Lord bless
[1:39:19] the the church
[1:39:24] Bless the
[1:39:26] people you know the story about Bram
[1:39:28] give of the when they had no water it
[1:39:30] was and he said the old lady get on and
[1:39:32] pray you say when she start to pray so
[1:39:34] you know she was a pray warrior they go
[1:39:36] get bucket one time because when that
[1:39:37] lady pray you know what going
[1:39:40] come because she have a relationship
[1:39:43] with
[1:39:44] God some of us have distant relationship
[1:39:47] go God hear a voice so rarely he's like
[1:39:49] wait now who is is that is that who I'm
[1:39:52] going to listen again because so long I
[1:39:59] him go no but isn't just think of it

[1:40:06] your voice you talk to me in 5 years how
[1:40:08] I catch your
[1:40:10] voice just think of it in the
[1:40:13] natural but if every day you're calling
[1:40:15] me then the moment I hear here and I
[1:40:18] know it's
[1:40:20] you look at the woman and that's why I
[1:40:22] say some of us our pain is not great
[1:40:24] enough I'll say that one more time our
[1:40:28] pain is not great enough because pain
[1:40:30] drives us to desperation it's a
[1:40:32] lot so that wiow woman with the unjust
[1:40:35] judge the judge wasn't taken on until it
[1:40:38] was got become overbearing he said if I
[1:40:40] don't stop this woman and deal with her
[1:40:41] case here I wouldn't sleep this night
[1:40:43] the night to come the night let go deal
[1:40:45] with her because of her incess
[1:40:47] unstopping wearing unless he wearing me

[1:41:01] [Applause]
[1:41:04] yes all night prayer meetings forget
[1:41:07] about
[1:41:09] it young people even know to spell the
[1:41:11] all night pray meeting but put them on a
[1:41:13] movie
[1:41:19] marathon they're watching our series The
[1:41:21] Devil so good it's not just movies it's
[1:41:22] series
[1:41:23] so it's episode after episode and they
[1:41:25] Master the science of cliffhanger so you
[1:41:28] you have to see the next
[1:41:31] one mess up your whole day you can't
[1:41:33] wait for next
[1:41:40] episode I share
[1:41:42] this I share this a few
[1:41:45] times growing up there was no TV in the
[1:41:48] house
[1:41:50] um there was a old TV at one point and
[1:41:53] when whenever Dad went out we used to
[1:41:55] find a string I don't know if Gideon
[1:41:56] remember this and run a wire and try to
[1:41:59] Andrew remember this trying to gety
[1:42:02] channel we W not too successful at times
[1:42:08] but but I remember being in secondary
[1:42:10] school I just sharing we having a
[1:42:13] conversation and they're watching these
[1:42:16] series well you know your brother a
[1:42:18] little sharp now so he's listening you
[1:42:19] listening listening brother l i watch no
[1:42:21] party series but I listen until I know
[1:42:23] the characters and everything and I said
[1:42:24] to join the conversation because you
[1:42:26] want to beong
[1:42:27] now so what happened to James Boy Yes
[1:42:30] you happened to James well James do so
[1:42:32] and so yeah boy if James and Betty they
[1:42:34] don't need do I see the episode yes
[1:42:38] know but I so want to be long in the
[1:42:40] conversation in school I want to feel
[1:42:42] left out
[1:42:45] now and the reality as humans we want to
[1:42:48] feel a sense of
[1:42:50] belonging so young people don't feel we
[1:42:52] understand
[1:42:54] and the whole need
[1:42:57] to everybody going here why I can go
[1:42:59] everybody doing this why I can
[1:43:03] do and recognize the devil have all
[1:43:05] these tricks to catch your
[1:43:07] attention and what we knew at 12 they
[1:43:10] know now at
[1:43:12] 7: so you can't play naive and we have
[1:43:15] to confront the issues and the reality
[1:43:17] of it because our young people are under
[1:43:19] attack am the devil are trying to get
[1:43:22] them blessed he trying to take their
[1:43:23] Souls so you have to realize the enemy
[1:43:26] coming for your house the enemy coming
[1:43:28] for your marriage the enemy coming for
[1:43:29] your family the enemy trying to steal to
[1:43:32] Rob to kill to destroy that's his
[1:43:36] mission anybody with me this
[1:43:39] morning so if you accept the reality
[1:43:41] that your home is under attack your
[1:43:44] Christianity is under attack your
[1:43:46] marriage is under attack yours walk with
[1:43:48] the Lord is under attack then why you
[1:43:50] walking like if nothing going on
[1:43:53] and how could you even leave your home
[1:43:55] without trying to pray and seek the Lord
[1:43:58] and why would you open the door I sh sh
[1:44:00] there many many times the enemy can only
[1:44:02] come in when we open doors for him you
[1:44:04] know because the enemy has no Authority
[1:44:07] just walk into your house to even get to
[1:44:09] job God had to say go and I will remove
[1:44:12] the Hedge around him go
[1:44:14] on but if you open the door to the enemy
[1:44:17] that's a different story and many of us
[1:44:20] open the door to the enemy with what we
[1:44:22] watch
[1:44:24] yes the M the music the the movies the
[1:44:25] shows all these things that doors
[1:44:28] because your eyes are going to your
[1:44:30] soul so turn what set a
[1:44:35] nonsense and because of that you even
[1:44:38] aware of it over years over time the
[1:44:39] devil dropping seeds in their
[1:44:42] heart and that what we have to cast
[1:44:45] out love for these things and and after
[1:44:48] a while is it's it's because it's only
[1:44:49] two forces only two influences you know
[1:44:51] it's either God or the devil you know
[1:44:53] amen like I said I'm not preaching this
[1:44:54] morning just talking there some Godly
[1:44:57] advice because there's coming a day when
[1:45:00] you're going to have to give an account
[1:45:02] for this very service on this day
[1:45:03] September the 1st you wouldn't forget
[1:45:05] this
[1:45:08] day I said to young people there are
[1:45:10] some numbers in your phone need to
[1:45:12] remove there's some people you need to
[1:45:14] stop taking their calls there's some
[1:45:16] places you need to stop going there are
[1:45:18] some shows you have to get rid of
[1:45:23] I cannot do it for you your parents can
[1:45:24] do it for you you have to do it for
[1:45:27] yourself anybody with me this
[1:45:30] morning and this applies to somebody the
[1:45:33] adults as well you
[1:45:38] know but the mam said it was we we us
[1:45:40] start saying years ago that no doubt was
[1:45:43] taken from this verse keep your skirts
[1:45:44] clean it meant don't get involved in
[1:45:47] questionable things others will be
[1:45:49] involved and you might be tempted to be
[1:45:52] involved or someone might try to involve
[1:45:54] you but stay clear of it we have too
[1:45:56] much
[1:45:57] compromisers and on this one I have to
[1:46:00] hit some of the
[1:46:02] parents because when your young people
[1:46:04] leave your home you see how they
[1:46:08] live but if you say well it's okay
[1:46:15] go they still have bull P something
[1:46:29] because when this is why go tell them
[1:46:30] kill all the amikit you know kill them
[1:46:32] when when they're small because when you
[1:46:34] tolerate things and it grow and grow and
[1:46:35] then it gets a point where it it's no
[1:46:37] longer
[1:46:38] checkable until the child now reach a
[1:46:41] level of rebellion because Rebellion is
[1:46:43] a as a sin of
[1:46:47] Witchcraft I'm warning you parents who
[1:46:50] still have the opportunity to create the
[1:46:51] environment that this house is a house
[1:46:54] of praise and
[1:46:56] worship this house is a house that's
[1:46:58] under the
[1:47:00] token this house stands for certain
[1:47:03] things I saw my dad many years ago told
[1:47:07] family members we have certain standards
[1:47:09] here certain things can't happen here if
[1:47:11] you're coming to this house dress a
[1:47:12] certain
[1:47:16] way are we are we
[1:47:20] here you can't go to cour house just how
[1:47:23] you want in
[1:47:25] know so what's wrong with having
[1:47:29] standards as a person as an individual I
[1:47:32] have met business people who say I don't
[1:47:34] drink I don't smoke because it clouds my
[1:47:37] ability to make strategic decisions
[1:47:39] that's not even based on no biblical
[1:47:41] principle they just want to make the
[1:47:42] best decisions to win and we have
[1:47:44] wishy-washy Christians who s a little
[1:47:47] social drink what's wrong with you what
[1:47:48] kind of nonsense is
[1:47:50] that listen I still warming up and I
[1:47:52] still in the I start to get into
[1:47:53] anything
[1:47:56] yet how could people who don't have no
[1:47:58] spiritual Foundation have more guts to
[1:48:01] stand for something than we who are
[1:48:07] here you have people who are successful
[1:48:09] say we I don't spend time with people
[1:48:11] with negative
[1:48:12] energy I guard the energy around
[1:48:15] me some of us we like the pity party we
[1:48:18] want to spend people who taking going
[1:48:20] nowhere they just complaining they just
[1:48:22] complaining is
[1:48:23] complaining what are you feeding
[1:48:25] yourself
[1:48:27] on I don't care whether you're eight
[1:48:29] whether you're 10 whether you're 15 or
[1:48:31] you're 92 here this morning you have to
[1:48:34] take a stand but obit said years ago it
[1:48:37] always stuck with me as a young person
[1:48:38] growing up throw the acts first I'm a
[1:48:42] Christian get your job to help you stay
[1:48:45] accountable because the moment you make
[1:48:47] the Declaration I'm a Christian they say
[1:48:49] but m Christian does do this or do do
[1:48:51] this and it will make you feel
[1:48:53] icted some of us don't want nobody to
[1:48:55] know we are Christian especially the
[1:48:56] brothers let start on the
[1:48:58] [Applause]
[1:49:02] brothers the sisters have more pressure
[1:49:04] because you have to cover your knees is
[1:49:05] not an option is it a discussion it's
[1:49:09] not a suggestion it's not a
[1:49:10] recommendation it's a requirement from
[1:49:12] the
[1:49:13] [Applause]
[1:49:18] word if God said it that's it it settles
[1:49:20] it
[1:49:22] dress like a Christian walk like a
[1:49:24] Christian talk like a Christian you
[1:49:26] represent a
[1:49:35] kingdom so these sisters have a work to
[1:49:38] do because they have a public
[1:49:39] declaration by the way they move the way
[1:49:41] they dress the way they act to have a
[1:49:43] testimony let people wonder what kingdom
[1:49:45] you come
[1:49:50] from and the Bible says my people shall
[1:49:53] never be
[1:49:55] ashamed how could you be embarrassed for
[1:49:57] standing in truth how could you be
[1:49:59] embarrassed because if you embarrass of
[1:50:01] God he'll be embarrassed of you you
[1:50:08] know people proud to dress how they want
[1:50:11] live what they want they decline they
[1:50:13] identifying this way and they I identify
[1:50:15] as this I'm I identifying as a Christian
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:22] people changing pronouns okay I identify
[1:50:25] as a Christian as a Christian I have
[1:50:28] principles I dress a certain way I speak
[1:50:30] a certain way I Daniel had a choice he
[1:50:32] got to go and hide in the bathroom and
[1:50:36] pray but he was not ashamed he had a
[1:50:39] testimony and against persecution he did
[1:50:42] what was
[1:50:44] right and I say we go and TR the land
[1:50:49] then I say sorry I already mean that no
[1:50:52] know he knew what was
[1:50:54] right some of us we need a stronger
[1:50:56] conviction we need to be convinced we
[1:50:58] need to be persuaded that judgment is
[1:51:00] over the Earth judgment is over the
[1:51:03] government judgment is over the seas
[1:51:04] judgment is over everything judgment is
[1:51:06] over homes in fact the Bible said
[1:51:08] judgment will begin in the house of God
[1:51:11] and the ancient men those who have heard
[1:51:13] this and did nothing with
[1:51:15] it I don't know who this is for this
[1:51:19] morning but don't let me see you walking
[1:51:21] out your school young sister and you
[1:51:23] have the shortest
[1:51:27] skirt we know all the tricks years ago
[1:51:30] it's not a new thing years ago people
[1:51:32] stashing shorter skirt in the bag they
[1:51:34] leaving your house with a longer skirt
[1:51:35] and have a shorter
[1:51:39] skirt but I want I expose everything
[1:51:43] today because they think we born
[1:51:47] yesterday I told my wife my daughter
[1:51:50] have enough years on the earth to
[1:51:51] challenge me yet
[1:51:57] you enough years and years I remember
[1:51:59] young sisters they they leave hor house
[1:52:01] looking Christian you know but by time
[1:52:03] they hit the mat taxi that skirt change
[1:52:05] and next
[1:52:09] skirt because us who here now we are
[1:52:11] born this size of we went to school
[1:52:16] too listen you might believe it I
[1:52:18] thought I was going to be a bad boy at
[1:52:19] one pointed
[1:52:22] I'm not sure this SP will be received
[1:52:26] but I had my wannabe gangster
[1:52:29] days stepen gang stop it
[1:52:32] please sister Nicholas not here today
[1:52:36] good good good because if she was here
[1:52:38] we'd have to be getting some special
[1:52:40] help for her at one point I thought I
[1:52:42] was bad I rolling with boys boy one day
[1:52:45] I get Rob leaving school my ganger is
[1:52:50] done but I to watch Street to make sure
[1:52:53] I can walk on the
[1:52:54] road I said to read psalms leaving
[1:52:58] school the Psalms the Lord is my
[1:53:00] shepher I think Gideon Gideon were you
[1:53:02] with me when yeah Gideon was with me we
[1:53:05] walking on the road and about six men
[1:53:07] grabed the watch off my hand walk with a
[1:53:10] big stick there I don't even know how
[1:53:12] the rubbery start
[1:53:14] finish I just keep
[1:53:16] walking in a days the stepen Paul the
[1:53:21] next day I leave school with my
[1:53:25] [Applause]
[1:53:31] Bible that was the that's when I retired
[1:53:34] from the ganger
[1:53:38] life help
[1:53:48] me I remember coming over from school
[1:53:50] and my mom saying wherever your pick
[1:53:52] that up wherever it was put it
[1:53:55] back we where where the parents who talk
[1:54:05] so and all this is part of the shaping
[1:54:07] so there's nothing new the Bible say
[1:54:08] there's nothing new Under the
[1:54:11] Sun and through this struggle is a
[1:54:14] crisis of identity and purpose for God
[1:54:17] to try to work something out and for you
[1:54:20] to have enough faith and believe because
[1:54:21] at that point it drove me to the
[1:54:24] Bible now I wouldn't know how much I
[1:54:26] would fall in love with scripture and
[1:54:27] studying but maybe no thing about it
[1:54:29] have been starting point you know thank
[1:54:32] God for the robbery
[1:54:37] yes afterbody you learned to thank God
[1:54:39] for your trials it was a good watch it
[1:54:40] was a nice watch
[1:54:43] too but it changed my approach to
[1:54:45] leaving
[1:54:46] school I think I called Dad a few times
[1:54:49] to pick him up and think my faith was
[1:54:50] weak
[1:54:55] but the reality we go through different
[1:54:56] experiences and the issue is young
[1:54:58] people what we trying to help you to see
[1:55:00] is that there are mistakes that we have
[1:55:02] made that you don't need to
[1:55:10] make and anyone and and butov said it I
[1:55:13] believe earlier this same service our
[1:55:15] parents most of them did the best they
[1:55:17] know how to do you know
[1:55:22] and that's why it's so important that we
[1:55:24] could learn from each other because
[1:55:26] there's wisdom in having the
[1:55:27] conversation about the reality of
[1:55:30] life but would talk about he was in a
[1:55:32] job one day and this lady say some some
[1:55:35] move she push and he say I'm married see
[1:55:37] the ring she say who care about
[1:55:41] that and that was how much years ago now
[1:55:43] forget
[1:55:46] it you have women who want to be the
[1:55:50] chick because they don't want to be the
[1:55:52] responsibility of the being your
[1:55:55] wife this word just
[1:55:59] Twisted so you can't walk around
[1:56:05] blinders anybody with me this
[1:56:08] [Applause]
[1:56:16] morning keep your skirts clean it men
[1:56:19] don't get involved in questionable
[1:56:21] things others will be involved and you
[1:56:23] might be tempted to be involved or
[1:56:26] someone might even try to involve you
[1:56:28] but stay clear of it all by steering a
[1:56:31] course away from it I remember in form
[1:56:35] two I think it was I can't remember what
[1:56:37] yeah it was there was a walkeron in
[1:56:39] school secondary school and my dad was
[1:56:42] not comfortable sending me to the walkon
[1:56:44] so he sent her older
[1:56:46] brother young brother but older than me
[1:56:49] to be like the person to watch us now
[1:56:53] chaperon well I couldn't believe it cuz
[1:56:55] the chaperon was bopping to the
[1:57:01] music so I trying to understand who
[1:57:04] watching
[1:57:10] who good intention wrong
[1:57:15] selection but the reality is friends and
[1:57:18] I've said it before peer pressure as a
[1:57:21] young person as a Believer should not be
[1:57:23] people putting pressure on you it should
[1:57:26] be you putting pressure on other
[1:57:32] people I remember preaching in school I
[1:57:35] remember having heated debates about
[1:57:38] scripture my whole life has been me
[1:57:40] fighting to get people to believe this
[1:57:42] thing is right you ever tried to testify
[1:57:45] about the goodness of the Lord my growth
[1:57:48] I'm sharing my testimony was because
[1:57:50] people say well show me in the Bible
[1:57:51] what they say and show me this and show
[1:57:53] and well I couldn't show them
[1:57:57] know you ever meet somebody Challenge
[1:57:59] and recognize well they no different
[1:58:01] things and you recognize you had no
[1:58:02] answers for certain and recognize you
[1:58:03] have to go back and go back to basics
[1:58:05] and then get better and come back again
[1:58:06] I'll come back for you
[1:58:12] tomorrow but that's how you get sharp
[1:58:13] because the Bible say be ready to give
[1:58:15] an
[1:58:16] answer for why you standing with but if
[1:58:18] you can't answer why you're doing what
[1:58:20] you're doing you'll get washed upen you
[1:58:22] have to believe God sent a prophet you
[1:58:24] have to believe this thing is right you
[1:58:26] have to believe that there's a purpose
[1:58:27] for your life you have to believe that
[1:58:29] there are things that God hates the
[1:58:31] thing that God loves and you have to
[1:58:32] have a testimony if you believe that
[1:58:34] things would show you off you'll be off
[1:58:36] every day is a every sun is a crank up
[1:58:38] let me kick out him again bring bring
[1:58:41] the jumper
[1:58:42] cables but when you have a revelation of
[1:58:45] this thing you could put you
[1:58:47] anywhere Daniel was in a foreign land
[1:58:49] and he was still a Believer Esther was
[1:58:51] in a foreign land she lost her vision
[1:58:53] but she was still a Believer she didn't
[1:58:55] fall and put on the makeup and all the
[1:58:57] earrings and all the thing no no no no
[1:58:59] no she Liv a clean thing and that is
[1:59:00] what caught the attention of the
[1:59:04] king can the church say
[1:59:06] Amen could you take a a bit
[1:59:10] more stay clear of it by steering a
[1:59:13] course away from it friends I'll say it
[1:59:16] it this way up to yesterday I was
[1:59:17] sharing this with with Dad in business
[1:59:21] Steve Jobs was considered one of the
[1:59:22] greatest CEOs of the 21st century with
[1:59:27] how he Led Apple to being
[1:59:30] apple apple is an incredible company I'm
[1:59:32] just not advocating I mean I'm
[1:59:34] advocating for their phones and stuff
[1:59:35] it's not a paid announcement but it's a
[1:59:36] fantastic
[1:59:39] company and he made a statement he said
[1:59:42] success in business is much more about
[1:59:44] saying no than saying yes because every
[1:59:48] day a deal comes an opportunity comes a
[1:59:51] request for this comes and the better
[1:59:53] you get at knowing what you don't want
[1:59:55] to see is the clearer what you want to
[1:59:57] see appears bringing the way the prophet
[2:00:00] presented it he said when was
[2:00:02] Michelangelo was carving out he said
[2:00:05] what he wasn't trying to carve out the
[2:00:06] image he was cutting what was not
[2:00:08] supposed to be there so that only what
[2:00:11] was supposed to be there remained
[2:00:12] anybody with
[2:00:14] me you have to learn to say no all right
[2:00:18] so Church could we just say no no did
[2:00:21] everybody get it not St Paul I didn't
[2:00:23] see you say I want everybody to say
[2:00:28] no that was 82% let's say
[2:00:33] no let's just try it one more I just a
[2:00:35] little louder let's say no no all right
[2:00:40] how hard was
[2:00:42] that I want you to go home and practice
[2:00:44] that later because have plenty people
[2:00:47] who will come to you and you have to
[2:00:48] tell them no no I don't go
[2:00:52] I don't want to go I'm not interested
[2:00:56] [Applause]
[2:01:03] no let me go now
[2:01:07] no and you will realize no actually get
[2:01:10] your stress to drop you is a liberating
[2:01:14] word
[2:01:17] know because when you put yourself in
[2:01:20] situations where you start to feel
[2:01:22] uncomfortable and then it's a pressure I
[2:01:24] think sister Karen spoke about it years
[2:01:25] ago the young we had a youth youth
[2:01:28] service and it was an end of year
[2:01:30] Christmas function in the office and
[2:01:32] they had little drinks and alcohol and
[2:01:34] thing and they say well why you don't
[2:01:36] drink too she say well I I'm a Christian
[2:01:38] and the person who was offering said
[2:01:40] well I'm a Christian
[2:01:47] too and if you not grounded and cast in
[2:01:50] no
[2:01:52] then you well you in a
[2:01:55] country and the and the longer you take
[2:01:57] to say no is a hole that it hard to come
[2:02:01] out of
[2:02:03] it but the faster you say no is the
[2:02:06] Freer you BEC coming them let them say
[2:02:08] but you real boring but I am so boring
[2:02:11] have any other word you want to
[2:02:17] use you have to be comfortable in your
[2:02:19] skin
[2:02:22] I'm not interested I'm not going if if
[2:02:25] you tell me one more time I'll will
[2:02:26] never come
[2:02:28] again how hard is that what what points
[2:02:31] you
[2:02:34] lose when you really assess and this is
[2:02:37] where I say when you meet people who at
[2:02:39] the end of their Road and they start to
[2:02:41] Value life and recognize what was worth
[2:02:43] it than what was not they come to say
[2:02:45] all is
[2:02:47] Vanity how thing we stress about not
[2:02:50] word stressing about you know
[2:02:55] all the people they trying to impress
[2:02:56] and please rarely even care about you
[2:02:59] you
[2:03:01] know can I say that
[2:03:05] again have the people they trying to
[2:03:07] impress and and you're trying to
[2:03:09] organize yourself to look a certain way
[2:03:10] they don't care about you and how could
[2:03:13] they when you are on OD
[2:03:16] ball God blessed us with not with with
[2:03:20] with God blessed us to not have the
[2:03:22] ability to hear people really thinking
[2:03:23] because if you really hear what people
[2:03:24] thinking about you you stay in your
[2:03:26] house and never come
[2:03:27] out because the people who think you who
[2:03:30] you think are your friends not your
[2:03:31] friends you
[2:03:34] know I say to young people all the time

[2:03:41] to
[2:03:43] heaven I trying to make it to the other
[2:03:46] side and only perfect love will get me
[2:03:48] there so if what they're trying to do
[2:03:51] not supporting that mission that is not
[2:03:53] your
[2:03:54] friend there has to be a line of
[2:03:57] separation between where you are going
[2:04:00] and everything else and if it's not
[2:04:02] where you're going then why is it taking
[2:04:04] your time your energy or even more
[2:04:06] stressing you

[2:04:41] po having
[2:04:44] war you they trying to find every you

[2:04:49] edge because you know you're not
[2:04:50] supposed to have a makeup but you're
[2:04:52] trying
[2:04:53] to I don't even know how to articulate
[2:04:55] this thing
[2:04:57] brother friends you're not from the
[2:05:00] world stop trying to look like the world
[2:05:04] the world need them kind of thing
[2:05:05] because they don't look as good as you
[2:05:07] let me start this morning let let me
[2:05:09] start this
[2:05:20] morning there a what I could see let me
[2:05:22] reverse the car of that one I think the
[2:05:24] point just made but don't try to be like
[2:05:27] the
[2:05:30] world but the brandom said there only
[2:05:32] one woman painted her face like that
[2:05:33] that was
[2:05:39] Jezebel you have to have a
[2:05:42] testimony be different be proud to be
[2:05:45] different we said it before when you
[2:05:47] look Queen Elizabeth is who just passed
[2:05:49] on right yes you never see see Queen
[2:05:52] Elizabeth walking she in her tight
[2:05:57] pants or a minis
[2:06:00] skirt Lizzie no no no that's not how it
[2:06:03] was working that was the queen she
[2:06:06] carried herself as a
[2:06:11] queen yes see no picture of she going in
[2:06:15] VIP much less a line to go into her fet
[2:06:18] because she's the
[2:06:19] queen even the royal family and this is
[2:06:22] not just across all the royal families
[2:06:25] Denmark Finland you name all the
[2:06:26] different countries I think was for her
[2:06:29] funeral or the wedding or whatever it
[2:06:30] was you see everybody dressed a certain
[2:06:32] way everybody neede properly covered
[2:06:35] every and it was they defin it as the
[2:06:37] classiness of
[2:06:40] royalty you supposed to be so proud to
[2:06:42] dress like
[2:06:44] royalty when people challenge how you
[2:06:47] dress you need to tell them step up to
[2:06:48] my
[2:06:50] level there's a level I'm operating at
[2:06:53] that you need to understand when you
[2:06:55] understand the level I'm at come talk to
[2:06:57] me somebody preach back to me don't let
[2:06:59] them pull you down to their
[2:07:01] [Applause]
[2:07:13] level I want us to stick because we let
[2:07:17] these nonsense influencers on the
[2:07:19] internet Define how people supposed to
[2:07:24] live the word is already twisted and
[2:07:26] perverted in
[2:07:28] know and because we become so tolerant
[2:07:30] of the foolishness we accepted for is so
[2:07:33] your nails your hair your thing
[2:07:35] everything is you're trying to be like
[2:07:37] the world that not going into
[2:07:39] heaven can I say that
[2:07:44] again well Lord I could I could come in
[2:07:46] here with this nail thing with this foot
[2:07:49] polish this nail
[2:07:54] am I talking to
[2:07:58] anybody the Bible say I'm the Lord and I
[2:08:00] change not he has a standard
[2:08:04] know I say again even a natural court of
[2:08:07] law you can't well I go into court put a
[2:08:10] vest a white
[2:08:12] beer they will stop you at the
[2:08:15] entrance you cannot go into a natural
[2:08:18] Court like that you cannot go into a
[2:08:20] court with them kind of min
[2:08:23] hallelujah how much more for the house
[2:08:25] of God how much more for your own house
[2:08:27] because you could establish parameters
[2:08:30] for your house for your
[2:08:32] life and for whatever else you cannot
[2:08:35] control you could control this Temple
[2:08:37] you can control this
[2:08:39] body and the Bible say present your body
[2:08:42] as a Living Sacrifice holy and
[2:08:44] acceptable your body is a sacrifice how
[2:08:47] you dress how you move how you live
[2:08:49] where you carry it what you do with it
[2:08:51] that's a
[2:08:52] sacrifice because his body wants to do
[2:08:54] all kind of thing but you need to bring
[2:08:56] your body under subjection can I can we
[2:08:59] have a conversation this
[2:09:02] morning could we take some
[2:09:07] more I lose track of
[2:09:14] time God is going to reward those who
[2:09:18] follow this advice that is the prophet's
[2:09:20] words amen
[2:09:22] Godly advice to the young people you
[2:09:25] cannot go everywhere you cannot do
[2:09:27] anything you cannot speak a certain way
[2:09:29] there's some jokes that you make that
[2:09:32] those words shouldn't be coming out your
[2:09:38] mouth that's one part of it the other
[2:09:41] part is you shouldn't be living a double
[2:09:43] life that what people see here and a
[2:09:45] Sunday is is who you are but after
[2:09:48] Sunday don't catch you on a Monday
[2:09:50] evening
[2:09:55] because they see real
[2:09:56] you and don't don't let somebody push
[2:09:59] you because if they push you well it's
[2:10:03] then it wasn't me upset to know but it's
[2:10:05] because she pushed
[2:10:07] me you see a whole different person and
[2:10:09] it's not a different person or know it's
[2:10:11] really who you
[2:10:12] are because under pressure and stress
[2:10:15] the real you always shows up in them
[2:10:18] that's why companies have probation
[2:10:20] because you when people join a company I
[2:10:22] see over and over anybody who manage boy
[2:10:24] they want people early to thing oh gosh
[2:10:27] they thing they thing week one week two
[2:10:30] week three some many people the holding
[2:10:32] straight you see them
[2:10:34] struggle because you real them they
[2:10:37] inside the house the real the real
[2:10:38] person who come late the real person who
[2:10:41] don't do the work right they take
[2:10:42] shortcut by the time they reach the
[2:10:45] probation Mark the real you then stand
[2:10:47] up there big and gold you can't hide it
[2:10:49] no more you know
[2:10:51] amen that's why I need a
[2:10:55] change that's what the new birth is for
[2:10:58] to change the old nature because while
[2:11:00] we can have all these conversations
[2:11:02] which is about your love to God not
[2:11:04] rules but your love to God that has you
[2:11:08] live in a certain way I want to repeat
[2:11:09] that again this is not a bunch of rules
[2:11:11] we are discussing this morning it's your
[2:11:14] love to God grows to such a point you
[2:11:17] want to please him and do the things
[2:11:19] that he loves the things that he wants
[2:11:21] to see the thing that he takes pleasure
[2:11:25] in your love for him starts to align
[2:11:29] with his love for you but there's
[2:11:31] another part of this which changes the
[2:11:33] Inside Man until the Inside Man don't
[2:11:36] want to do the evil things no more
[2:11:38] somebody preach back to me this
[2:11:46] morning that's why the Bible says if you
[2:11:49] love me keep my Commandments
[2:11:52] only if you love him oh God help me this
[2:11:54] morning is there anybody who love the
[2:11:56] Lord this morning because if you love
[2:12:00] him then keeping his Commandments is not
[2:12:03] a formality it's not a stressful thing
[2:12:06] it's not a feeling pressure no you love
[2:12:09] him so much that song says I love him
[2:12:13] too much to fail him
[2:12:19] now and every day with Jesus supposed to
[2:12:21] be sweeter than did before I love him
[2:12:23] more and more my love become so much I
[2:12:26] glad to throw out the clothes and throw
[2:12:28] away the music and all the I want to get
[2:12:30] rid of it because I want to please
[2:12:32] [Applause]
[2:12:35] him you may be seated I preached it
[2:12:39] before I still working on it preached it
[2:12:41] before I know my wife watching She's
[2:12:43] recovery about she watching the home she
[2:12:45] say I will have to deal with this when I
[2:12:47] go back home but I say when love your
[2:12:51] wife you tell put the white clothes here
[2:12:54] and put the colored clothes here don't
[2:12:56] mix it up because it makes it harder to
[2:12:59] to wash it that could be fed like a rule
[2:13:03] but it's not a rule I love her are
[2:13:06] supposed to do
[2:13:08] it brother stepen we all have some
[2:13:11] growing up to do but the point I want to
[2:13:14] make is you could see as a rule but in
[2:13:16] reality Your Love drives your behavior a
[2:13:18] certain
[2:13:19] way we are supposed to be interesting in
[2:13:22] thing that God loves God loves when we
[2:13:24] sing he loves when we worship you come
[2:13:28] to church and you ain't
[2:13:29] [Applause]
[2:13:31] singing you singing Silent
[2:13:35] Night not the song you just
[2:13:41] silent but when you come in church you
[2:13:43] come with praise on your lips s say I
[2:13:46] was glad when they s to me let's go
[2:13:48] there are people here who are glad I
[2:13:49] know they're glad they're glad to
[2:13:51] Lord and there's some of us we need to
[2:13:53] get happier and see this as the greatest
[2:13:56] thing we could have ever experienced
[2:13:57] that the grace of God could extend to us
[2:14:00] and God could send a prophet with a
[2:14:02] message of reality that could change us
[2:14:04] not information and knowledge but who
[2:14:07] you are as a person is changed now you
[2:14:09] want to forgive you want to look past
[2:14:12] somebody else's
[2:14:13] faults you may be
[2:14:15] seated and friends we are not saying
[2:14:18] this this morning to point fingers and
[2:14:20] do this do this do this
[2:14:21] we are all trying to grow because all of
[2:14:23] us have things to fix all of us have
[2:14:25] things to improve all of us are pressing
[2:14:28] to that Mark all of us are striving to
[2:14:30] Perfection all of us need to get better
[2:14:32] at forgiving at loving at praising at
[2:14:35] serving at being more humble more
[2:14:38] honest if God could tell the prophet you
[2:14:41] need to be more sincere what about you
[2:14:43] and
[2:14:44] I Lord help us get a deeper sincerity is
[2:14:48] either this thing is right or it's wrong
[2:14:49] but if it's right then let's do it with
[2:14:52] 100% with our everything and watch God

[2:17:38] but alcohol something else old talk it
[2:17:41] could be just be old talk you know you
[2:17:42] like to talk
[2:17:46] trippiness
[2:17:49] lust for money lust of popularity loss
[2:17:51] of the eyes loss of the flesh you pride
[2:17:53] of life for some people is the ambition
[2:17:55] some people just
[2:17:57] Pride all of us have our thing to deal
[2:18:01] with so don't go around judging other
[2:18:04] people for this the issue is for us to
[2:18:06] realize that we have work to do and we
[2:18:08] come to service to see from the word
[2:18:11] because the word is the mirror we supp
[2:18:13] to look in at the word and say wait a
[2:18:14] minute something off here you
[2:18:16] know it's not us trying to correct you
[2:18:19] you have to do self correction because
[2:18:20] you have to give an account the
[2:18:22] responsibility of the ministry is to
[2:18:24] preach the word clearly to you so that
[2:18:26] it's not our responsibility anymore but
[2:18:28] the moment I let you know that you're
[2:18:30] supposed to live a certain way based on
[2:18:31] your word then it's on
[2:18:35] you anybody with me this
[2:18:37] evening husband love your wife that's a
[2:18:43] command you know there's no command for
[2:18:45] wies to love their
[2:18:47] husbands because the makeup of a woman
[2:18:49] is different is built into heart to love
[2:18:53] but the husbands need to be commanded
[2:18:54] love
[2:18:58] them as Christ loved the church which
[2:19:01] qualifies the kind of love not I love
[2:19:04] she and bu a
[2:19:06] fridge it's fridge love brother over
[2:19:08] just
[2:19:10] say talk about fridge love you have to
[2:19:13] appreciate the H the pastor it is keep
[2:19:15] us in line no we talk about fridge love
[2:19:18] but as Christ loved the church a certain
[2:19:21] Behavior a certain act certain
[2:19:24] attitude so the command to the husbands
[2:19:26] to love the wives and the command to the
[2:19:29] wives is to what
[2:19:31] reverence could the love part be there
[2:19:33] but the reverence part is be
[2:19:35] harder Sarah call Abraham
[2:19:38] Lord I know some sisters get a little to
[2:19:42] chew that one a little
[2:19:46] slowly I want a little slowly
[2:19:51] I wish my wife was here
[2:19:55] today we have nice conversations around
[2:19:57] these things say but Sarah call Abraham
[2:20:01] Lord I tell him to call me Lord but I
[2:20:04] mean there any Scripture
[2:20:07] let's I I didn't make it up it's
[2:20:11] there but it's in the word for us to see
[2:20:14] friends that there's a better way and
[2:20:17] the more you align with the way the word
[2:20:19] presents it is he better your
[2:20:20] relationships become and the way you
[2:20:22] deal with life become and the way you
[2:20:23] deal with situation become because all
[2:20:25] hell is against us not part of hell you
[2:20:26] know all of hell is against us you
[2:20:29] know and if there's a weak spot in your
[2:20:32] armor then you're going to get knocked
[2:20:35] out what we trying to do is avoid having
[2:20:38] to resuscitate people every
[2:20:40] Sunday because you're putting on the
[2:20:42] whole armor of God so you could stand in
[2:20:45] that day against the Ws of the attacks
[2:20:47] of of the enemy anybody with
[2:20:49] me so we we get stronger and when we
[2:20:51] back one another up one will put 1,000
[2:20:54] to flight two put 10,000 to flight and
[2:20:56] we row the enemy out of our homes R the
[2:20:59] enemy out of our Lives R the enemy out
[2:21:00] of our families can the church say Amen
[2:21:04] could it take some
[2:21:06] more I didn't even expect to be here
[2:21:09] this long this
[2:21:14] morning in choosing of a
[2:21:17] bride but the B said that many time men
[2:21:19] and women here go truth isn't that
[2:21:21] what's happening this morning because we
[2:21:23] taking it from the scripture from the
[2:21:24] prophet me it is it truth it's certain
[2:21:26] behaviors children obey your parents
[2:21:29] that's the word not disrespect them not
[2:21:32] mow them off not because you have two
[2:21:33] degree and two o levels and two CXC or
[2:21:36] whatever they want to call
[2:21:39] it and many time men and women hear
[2:21:42] God's truth and see it Vindicated and
[2:21:44] proven truth but yet they don't want to
[2:21:45] hear it there's some other
[2:21:48] reason in other words they taking some
[2:21:50] kind of advice there's some other
[2:21:52] choosing that they have than to face up
[2:21:54] the truth and facts therefore their ears
[2:21:57] can be closed to the gospel I'm reading
[2:21:59] the prophets words they'll never hear it
[2:22:01] again my advice to you when God speaks
[2:22:04] to your heart you act right
[2:22:08] then Elijah gave them a choice which
[2:22:10] they should choose you this day whom You
[2:22:12] Shall Serve if God be God serve him but
[2:22:15] if bail be God serve him friends I want
[2:22:18] to encourage you I'm not going to be too
[2:22:20] much longer with
[2:22:22] you the Bible said every knee will
[2:22:25] bow every tongue will confess that Jesus
[2:22:28] Christ is
[2:22:29] Lord the man who say there is no God
[2:22:32] will have to confess the man who believe
[2:22:34] in whatever religion he wants to believe
[2:22:36] will have to confess that Jesus Christ
[2:22:37] is the Lord that's the
[2:22:39] word and we have a great privilege
[2:22:41] through the message of this hour to see
[2:22:43] Jesus Christ present tense walking out
[2:22:46] of the pages of this word with Rapture
[2:22:47] and faith and everything else in there
[2:22:49] to see clearly what we are called to do
[2:22:51] are to understand the attack of the
[2:22:52] enemy that we are dealing
[2:22:56] with friends we must have a church on
[2:22:58] the word or no church at all we are in a
[2:23:01] crisis we need to see that we are in a
[2:23:03] crisis a crisis in our homes a crisis in
[2:23:06] the nation a crisis everywhere and if
[2:23:08] we're in a crisis it means we must
[2:23:10] operate a certain
[2:23:11] way making a valley full of ditches I'm
[2:23:14] going to be about 10 more minutes or so
[2:23:17] show me your company and I'll tell you

[2:23:26] me see the how the Bible is marked up
[2:23:30] let me see what's on your phone let me
[2:23:32] see your last 25 WhatsApp conversations
[2:23:35] let me see what you're spending time
[2:23:37] with on Facebook and on Tik Tok and on
[2:23:39] Instagram that tells me who you are you
[2:23:41] don't need to tell me just just just let
[2:23:42] me see that and I know

[2:23:50] don't need you to tell
[2:23:52] me let let me see I know for myself
[2:23:54] that's what the prophet is saying
[2:23:57] here let me see how the Bible's marked
[2:24:01] up let me see where it's all true
[2:24:04] stories let me listen to what kind of
[2:24:05] music you're playing on your
[2:24:09] radio half of the trouble people is
[2:24:11] getting because of music you know
[2:24:12] Lucifer was in charge of
[2:24:15] Music he was a music director
[2:24:21] so that music that get people angry
[2:24:23] music that people come home and they in
[2:24:24] a in a state because the music work them
[2:24:27] up David played the half he played music
[2:24:29] to drive evil spirits away from King
[2:24:32] Saul so music could move Spirits away
[2:24:35] from you music could lift music could
[2:24:37] bring spirits to
[2:24:38] you how much criminals listen to music
[2:24:41] before Comm committing an act they pych
[2:24:44] itself up and the music put them in a
[2:24:47] spirit to go and do what they want to do
[2:24:50] be very careful what music will listen
[2:24:56] to you know musicians some some I want
[2:24:59] to get it you put up a picture behind a
[2:25:02] church and see people with their hands
[2:25:04] lifted and somebody in pulpit and put a
[2:25:06] picture in a party or concert you ready
[2:25:09] can tell what is the environment because
[2:25:12] both pictures will show people hands up
[2:25:13] and there's somebody with a microphone
[2:25:15] it's
[2:25:17] worship people go to concerts and their
[2:25:20] hands there in the spirit of the song
[2:25:23] and the song gets lodged into the heart
[2:25:25] and the
[2:25:30] spirit and songs could break
[2:25:34] marriage song could lead you into
[2:25:37] fornication song could lead you into
[2:25:40] adultery song could lead you straight to
[2:25:43] hell because the musicians and the
[2:25:46] singers they are ministers you know the
[2:25:48] devil has ministers right
[2:25:52] yes I will say it clearly here the most
[2:25:55] effective ministers that the enemy uses
[2:25:57] right now is in the music
[2:25:59] real that's the most
[2:26:02] effective in the
[2:26:04] songs and the songs telling it this song
[2:26:07] and that and and and people just singing
[2:26:08] it and they don't even understand the
[2:26:10] meaning of the words sometime we'll get
[2:26:12] into it when you take the some of the
[2:26:14] songs and phrases people don't even know
[2:26:16] the meaning of the words in the songs
[2:26:19] and when you see the meaning is talking
[2:26:20] a devil worshiping and they singing the
[2:26:22] words not even knowing what the words
[2:26:23] actually
[2:26:26] mean you think it's a game you think
[2:26:28] it's just a casual thing we wrestleing
[2:26:31] against flesh and
[2:26:33] blood so be very careful Church young
[2:26:36] people what you listen to what you feed
[2:26:39] your spirit what you see because your
[2:26:41] eyes is AD da to the soul you see
[2:26:43] somethingone that change your whole
[2:26:44] perception of life and before you know
[2:26:46] it you can't reconcile your walk with
[2:26:48] God because you're watching things that
[2:26:50] you're not supposed to
[2:26:52] watch look I read an article recently
[2:26:54] some movie came out and people went to
[2:26:56] get psychiatric help after watching a
[2:26:58] movie some horror
[2:27:01] movie one is the why would you watch
[2:27:04] something that is so horrible that will
[2:27:06] drive it to a psychiatrist but the thing
[2:27:08] is what is the content of it that would
[2:27:11] drive you to go and see medical help to
[2:27:13] recalibrate your mind because it have
[2:27:15] you so traumatized you couldn't sleep
[2:27:17] and people have to get prescription to
[2:27:19] sleep because what they so trouble their
[2:27:20] spirit so
[2:27:22] much you catch that
[2:27:28] now let me see what kind of music you're
[2:27:31] playing on your radio let me see what
[2:27:32] kind of pictures you got in your house
[2:27:34] and I'll tell you what you made out of
[2:27:37] yes sir this I'm reading from the
[2:27:38] prophet that's what your soul is feeding
[2:27:40] on so people say well I'm going to the
[2:27:42] gym and I and I running or walking on
[2:27:44] the treadmill and what you listening to
[2:27:46] I want something a beat so I could move
[2:27:48] faster but what you listening to
[2:27:52] this wouldn't apply to everybody but
[2:27:53] there's somebody here it applies
[2:27:55] to that's what your soul is feeding on
[2:27:58] regardless of what your testimony is
[2:28:00] your fruits prove what you are your soul
[2:28:03] feeds on something and whatever the
[2:28:07] characteristic of your soul is that what
[2:28:09] it'll show forth that's the reason Jesus
[2:28:11] said by their fruit you shall know them
[2:28:14] in the message straight is the gate you
[2:28:15] have to make a choice you can't stand
[2:28:18] neutral you've got to say yes yes or no
[2:28:20] and we already touched on that earlier
[2:28:22] you never leave that door the same
[2:28:24] person you came in you can do it you've
[2:28:26] got a choice to make make it for Christ
[2:28:35] today let me warn you this morning
[2:28:37] church be careful I'm reading from the
[2:28:40] prophet it takes time today in our self
[2:28:43] righteous self-sufficient generation of
[2:28:46] hypocrisy that we are living in and our
[2:28:49] when men and women stand in the churches
[2:28:52] and in the pews and sing the anthems of
[2:28:54] God and walk out of that church and
[2:28:56] smoke cigarettes and drink whiskey and
[2:28:59] go to dances and live for the world and
[2:29:01] tell dirty smutty jokes and call
[2:29:03] themselves
[2:29:10] Christians same message straight to the
[2:29:12] gate he said as it was in the days of
[2:29:13] Noah so shall it be in the coming of the
[2:29:15] son of man
[2:29:23] oh out of 10,000 there was trees
[2:29:28] saved so as we approach this New Year
[2:29:31] young people church family friends we
[2:29:34] have a responsibility God against the
[2:29:36] music guard against the social media
[2:29:39] guard against movies and the content to
[2:29:43] friends and the family the associations
[2:29:52] look at today how people will stay home
[2:29:54] that call themselves Christians this is
[2:29:56] the prophet in
[2:29:58] 1964 and listen to such characters as
[2:30:00] Pat Boon Elvis Presley Ernie
[2:30:06] Ford and those who sing hymns on Sunday
[2:30:09] and look at them things they look at
[2:30:10] them kissing them wom and things out
[2:30:14] there where the Prophet says when no man
[2:30:17] should ever kiss a woman till he is
[2:30:18] married to her
[2:30:26] but look at it today all these movies
[2:30:28] and
[2:30:29] things it's public adultery brother
[2:30:31] brandham
[2:30:35] said work events social drinking all
[2:30:38] crafted to be an
[2:30:43] influence clothes being challenged but
[2:30:46] the BAM said in the junction of time
[2:30:48] it's a sin and a shame that way people
[2:30:50] are living and doing out on the streets
[2:30:52] naked young girls and old grandmas and
[2:30:54] all together and then go to church and
[2:30:56] sing in the choir and call yourself
[2:30:58] righteous your fruits show what you are
[2:31:01] why do you want to strip your clothes
[2:31:02] off for only one person in the Bible
[2:31:05] ever did and he was demon-possessed am
[2:31:08] I'm not saying that to be rude I'm
[2:31:09] saying that to warn you this may be the
[2:31:12] last time I ever see you or speak with
[2:31:15] you I want you to remember
[2:31:20] listen to The
[2:31:22] Prophet let me tell you something sister
[2:31:25] you may be as pure as a lily to your
[2:31:28] husband but on that day of judgment
[2:31:30] you're going to be counted an adulterous
[2:31:32] when you dress yourself like that these
[2:31:36] old sexy looking clothes that they wear
[2:31:39] and get out here in the street do you
[2:31:41] know that when a sinner looks at you and
[2:31:44] though you could be as pure as you can
[2:31:46] be that sinner lusting after you commits
[2:31:49] adultery with you said Jesus in his
[2:31:51] heart and when that sinner has to answer
[2:31:54] for adultery who presented their s to
[2:31:57] him you are guilty if he committed
[2:32:00] adultery who did he commit it with what
[2:32:02] caused him to do it because you dressed
[2:32:05] yourself like that but Bram shoots out
[2:32:10] he says get out of my private life
[2:32:12] because he's feeling what people are
[2:32:13] thinking in the service he said that's
[2:32:16] what you say to the Lord this is his
[2:32:18] word you say they don't sell any other
[2:32:21] kind of clothes brother brandham he said
[2:32:23] they sell sewing
[2:32:26] machines so there's no excuse you know
[2:32:30] that's right we don't spend enough time
[2:32:32] on these things you know because we have
[2:32:34] a lot of people with
[2:32:38] excuses and so butam goes on and father
[2:32:42] the hour is come get a little
[2:32:47] quiet father the hour has has come so on
[2:32:51] but today the whole nation is in that
[2:32:53] Trend use the word trend and we have
[2:32:55] this social media term more what's
[2:32:56] trending people want to be trending so
[2:32:59] the fashion the style the clothes they
[2:33:00] want to be in the latest
[2:33:02] Trend friends I'm not saying this for
[2:33:04] you to to feel uncomfortable that's know
[2:33:07] the objective here you know the
[2:33:08] objective is you to look at yourself in
[2:33:10] the word and say if you really want this
[2:33:12] thing called Christianity then this is
[2:33:14] what it looks
[2:33:17] like if you really want to be a believer
[2:33:20] it has a certain look a certain Behavior
[2:33:21] a certain expectation from
[2:33:27] God and America is not no more really
[2:33:30] America it's not no more Christian
[2:33:32] Nation it's a woman's Nation little old
[2:33:34] Jezebel go down the street all painted
[2:33:36] up and brother man will fall on their
[2:33:38] knees to her that's right I know that
[2:33:39] kind of hurts but that's the
[2:33:46] truth the BAM said let me say something
[2:33:49] right here my ladies I hope you all love
[2:33:51] me and I I'm not here to criticize you
[2:33:53] I'm only here to know that yonder at the
[2:33:55] day of judgment I will have to answer
[2:33:57] when I know these things and don't tell
[2:34:00] them then if I do warn you then the
[2:34:02] blood is off of my
[2:34:04] hand and that's the burden we are coming
[2:34:06] with this morning to make sure the blood
[2:34:08] is off of our hand so that you
[2:34:10] understand from the word not an idea not
[2:34:12] a suggestion but he who is Holy Holy
[2:34:15] still he who is righteous righteous
[2:34:17] still he who is filthy filthy still
[2:34:20] it's either you want God that's why the
[2:34:22] word says choose you this day whom you
[2:34:24] will serve because if you want to be a
[2:34:26] real Christian God will bless you for it
[2:34:28] but if you're not sure then you are
[2:34:30] looking at
[2:34:36] judgment I'm kneeling it
[2:34:46] down behold I stand at the door let me
[2:34:49] tell you something something sister
[2:34:50] there was only one woman in the Bible
[2:34:52] that ever painted her face her name was
[2:34:55] Jezebel and God fed her to the
[2:34:58] dogs you don't want to be one of her
[2:35:00] daughters it's a
[2:35:03] disgrace 2 Timothy 3 the musician get
[2:35:07] ready to come forward this know also
[2:35:09] that in the last days perilous time
[2:35:11] shall come for men shall be lovers of
[2:35:13] their own selves Covetous boasters proud
[2:35:16] blasphemers disobedient appearance un
[2:35:19] thankful
[2:35:20] Unholy without natural affection truth
[2:35:24] Breakers false accusers incontinent
[2:35:27] Fierce despisers of those that are
[2:35:30] good traitors heavy highminded lovers of
[2:35:34] pleasures moreour and lovers of God
[2:35:38] Amen we live in a selfish ungrateful
[2:35:41] World an entitled world I did a whole
[2:35:44] bible study on entitlement and the curse
[2:35:47] of entitlement
[2:35:50] where people live life thinking the
[2:35:51] world owe them something and that's how
[2:35:54] it's supposed to
[2:35:56] be having a form of godliness but
[2:35:59] denying the power thereof from such
[2:36:03] turnaway from God's provided way it's
[2:36:06] not necessary that any man would go to
[2:36:08] hell listen to The Prophet now God don't
[2:36:11] send no one to
[2:36:13] hell he said you send yourself to Hell
[2:36:17] God's done everything in the world he
[2:36:19] can to keep you from going to
[2:36:21] hell and yet you determined to go to
[2:36:24] hell so going to hell brother B presents
[2:36:26] is a choice by the decisions we make you
[2:36:29] fight over every barricade God puts in
[2:36:32] your way you just go right on over it I
[2:36:35] don't believe in this and I don't
[2:36:36] believe in that and I don't believe in
[2:36:38] this that's what brother talking about
[2:36:41] and there's a red light here in the city
[2:36:42] and it turns red and green that tells
[2:36:44] you when to stop and go and if you run
[2:36:47] it well don't blame the city they put
[2:36:49] the light up there for your protection
[2:36:52] but if you run on through it that's up
[2:36:54] to you you
[2:36:56] brought your own
[2:37:08] judgment you could begin to play
[2:37:10] something
[2:37:18] Softly and I warn you in the name of
[2:37:21] Jesus Christ get in the kingdom of God
[2:37:23] now that's right don't you fool about it
[2:37:26] you press in because there's coming a
[2:37:28] time when you'll scream and cry to
[2:37:31] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:37:33] it'll be shut
[2:37:35] off from
[2:37:40] you I trust in some way this morning
[2:37:43] this little encouragement
[2:37:45] this Godly advice to the young people
[2:37:48] that is to the entire church but to the
[2:37:51] young people in particular would bring a
[2:37:53] stark
[2:37:54] reality of God's love for us his
[2:37:57] expectation of us and will give us some
[2:38:00] things that we could go back and think
[2:38:02] on study on look on reflect on so that
