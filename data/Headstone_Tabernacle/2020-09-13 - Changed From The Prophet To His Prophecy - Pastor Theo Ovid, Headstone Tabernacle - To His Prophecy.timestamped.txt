[36:46] elias neither that prophet
[36:48] john answered them saying

[36:59] who commit after me is preferred before
[37:02] me

[37:06] unloose
[37:07] these things were done in bethabara
[37:09] beyond jordan where john was baptized in
[37:11] the next day
[37:12] john see jesus coming unto him and said
[37:15] behold
[37:16] the lamb of god which taken away the sin
[37:19] of the world
[37:20] this is he of whom i said after becoming
[37:22] a man
[37:23] which is preferred before me for he was
[37:25] before me and i knew him not
[37:27] but that he should maybe manifest to
[37:29] israel therefore
[37:30] i might come baptized with water and
[37:32] john b record saying
[37:34] i saw the spirit descending from heaven
[37:38] like a dove and an abode upon him and i
[37:41] knew him not but he that sent me to
[37:43] baptize with water
[37:44] the same said unto me upon whom thou
[37:46] shalt see
[37:47] the spirit descending and remaining on
[37:49] him the same as he
[37:51] hallelujah which baptized that with the
[37:53] holy ghost and i saw on their record
[37:56] this is the son of god and again the
[37:59] next day after john stood
[38:01] and two of his disciples and looking
[38:03] upon jesus as he walked he said behold
[38:06] the lamb of god and the two disciples
[38:08] hear them speak
[38:09] and they followed jesus and luke chapter
[38:12] 24
[38:14] from verse 13 and behold two of them
[38:16] went the same day to the village called
[38:18] emas
[38:19] which was about ru which was from
[38:20] jerusalem about three score full logs
[38:23] and they talked together of all these
[38:25] things which had happened
[38:27] and it came to pass that while they
[38:28] commune together and reason
[38:30] jesus himself drew near and went with
[38:33] them
[38:34] and the eyes were holding that they
[38:35] should not know him
[38:37] and he said to them what manner of
[38:38] communications are these
[38:41] that you have one to another as you walk
[38:43] on a sad
[38:44] and one of them whose name was cleopas
[38:47] answered and said unto him
[38:48] only a stranger in jerusalem has not
[38:51] known the things which have come to pass
[38:53] here in these days and he said unto them
[38:55] what things
[38:56] and they said unto him concerning jesus
[38:58] of nazareth which
[38:59] was a prophet mighty indeed and word
[39:01] before god and all the people
[39:03] how the chief priests and our rulers
[39:05] delivered him unto the condemned to
[39:06] death and
[39:07] crucified him but we trusted that it had
[39:09] been he
[39:10] which should have redeemed israel and
[39:12] besides all this today's the third day
[39:15] since these things were done yey and
[39:16] sitting
[39:17] woman also of our company made us
[39:20] astonish
[39:20] which were earlier to see falcon when
[39:22] they found out his body
[39:23] they came saying that they had seen a
[39:26] vision of angels which
[39:27] have said he was alive and certain of
[39:29] them which were when
[39:31] us went to the falcon found it even as
[39:33] the woman had said
[39:34] but him they saw not then he said unto
[39:36] them o fools
[39:39] slow of heart to believe all that the
[39:41] prophets
[39:42] have spoken or not christ thus suffered
[39:45] these things and to
[39:47] enter his glory and beginning at moses
[39:49] and
[39:50] all the prophets he expounded unto them
[39:52] in all the scriptures the things
[39:55] concerning himself may god bless this
[39:57] word you may be seated we are
[39:59] grateful to be here today and uh
[40:03] it's always a privilege for me to be in
[40:05] the house of god
[40:06] amen hallelujah blessed be the name of
[40:09] the lord
[40:10] i'm still rejoicing thanking god for his
[40:12] love
[40:13] his grace and his mercy and if you
[40:15] haven't heard that bible teaching why
[40:16] sit here and die
[40:18] go back and listen to something to
[40:19] listen listen but over again
[40:21] don't sit in your homes and die
[40:25] don't sit in the corner virus
[40:27] environment and just
[40:28] die do something do that them lepers you
[40:32] move forward
[40:33] you see if we stay here we die we go
[40:35] back in the
[40:36] city and familiar grounds we die we go
[40:38] to the syrian camp we might die
[40:40] we're going to do something oh harlan
[40:42] don't just sit
[40:43] there and die so this morning i have a
[40:45] title
[40:46] changed from the prophet to
[40:51] and his prophecy an inspiration a more
[40:53] sure word of prophecy
[40:55] more show and this scripture this
[40:57] inspirational martial or prophecy as you
[40:59] would know
[40:59] is on ii peter 1 uh 19 said we have also
[41:03] a more show with a prophecy
[41:05] where until you do well that you take
[41:07] heed as until
[41:08] light that shines in a dark place until
[41:10] the day dawn
[41:11] and the day star arise in your hearts
[41:13] knowing this first
[41:14] that no prophecy of the scripture is of
[41:17] any private interpretation
[41:19] for the prophecy came not in all
[41:22] by the will of man but the holy men of
[41:25] god
[41:26] spake as they were moved by the holy
[41:29] ghost
[41:29] so prophecy uh god breathed that's why
[41:33] all scripture
[41:34] is given by inspiration it is called
[41:36] breathe
[41:37] the breath of god is upon the prophecy
[41:40] the other context scripture i'd like to
[41:41] read before getting into the message
[41:43] and this context scripture is from
[41:44] second kings chapter two familiar
[41:46] scripture and it came to pass when the
[41:48] lord would take up elijah
[41:49] onto heaven by a whirlwind that elijah
[41:52] went into elijah from giggle

[43:05] and as they go from station to station
[43:07] to station they are dear
[43:09] to tell him yo you know that your master
[43:11] will be taken from you today

[43:15] lord will take away the mass of my head
[43:16] today he said yeah i know it hold your
[43:18] peace
[43:19] and elijah's in an entirely i pray here
[43:21] for the lord to send me to jordan
[43:23] and jordan represent that so if there
[43:25] ever was a time for the man to

[44:10] together smoked the waters
[44:12] and they were divided hither and thinner
[44:14] and they went who went on triground
[44:16] and it came to pass when they were gone
[44:18] over that elijah's and elisha

[44:22] be taken away from thee
[44:24] elijah said i pray thee let a double
[44:25] portion of thy spirit be upon me

[45:48] thank you lord jesus elijah saw it and
[45:51] like
[45:51] elijah was caught up in a whirlwind of
[45:53] the heaven and i just saw it he cried my
[45:55] father my father
[45:56] the child of israel and horsemen around
[45:58] and he saw him no more
[46:00] and he took a hold of his own clothes
[46:01] and rent them into pieces and he took up
[46:03] the matter of elijah
[46:04] and that fell from him and went back and
[46:06] stood by the bank of jordan
[46:08] he took the man of elijah and fell from
[46:11] him and smoked the waters
[46:12] and said where is the lord god of elijah
[46:15] where is the lord god of that prophet
[46:17] william
[46:17] branham oh glory to god we need a second
[46:20] venom we are neither next branham we
[46:22] need a next prophet we don't need no new
[46:23] elijah we are no modern prophet
[46:26] we just need where is the lord god and
[46:27] elijah that's what we need
[46:29] oh give the lord a shout feel inspired
[46:32] as even
[46:33] he took the mother of elijah that
[46:35] forever him and smote the waters and
[46:37] said where
[46:38] is the lord god of elijah and when he
[46:40] also split smitten the waters they
[46:42] parted his anteda and elijah went over
[46:44] and then the sun
[46:45] when the sons of the prophets which were
[46:48] the viewer
[46:48] jericho saw him they say the spirit of
[46:51] elijah god rest on elisha
[46:53] and they came to meet him and bowled
[46:54] themselves to the ground before him
[46:56] and the prophet said that the world will
[46:59] bow
[47:00] at the feet of men and women who cross
[47:02] jordan once
[47:03] more the world will hear direct from god
[47:05] oh give the lord a shout oh hallelujah
[47:08] oh it's good to be here this morning oh
[47:11] hallelujah
[47:12] changed from the prophet to his prophecy
[47:17] hallelujah so what we need
[47:21] is an old-fashioned god sense called in
[47:24] religion
[47:25] that was called the willingness out of
[47:27] the church
[47:28] now the teaching can't do that you know
[47:31] no no no we need to come back to the
[47:33] holy ghost and fire
[47:34] back to the thing that burns out the
[47:36] drugs
[47:37] and brings the old-fashioned preaching
[47:39] back make heaven high
[47:42] hell heart gone barry straight we need
[47:44] that
[47:45] kind of a preaching tips can do that you
[47:48] know
[47:48] we need that kind of a preaching make
[47:51] heaven hell present tense
[47:52] hallelujah oh glory to god but to do it
[47:56] your congregation will vote you out
[47:57] sometimes good preachers are led astray
[48:00] by the congregation and that's the
[48:02] reason i have no denomination
[48:04] i have one headquarters and that is from
[48:06] heaven
[48:07] wherever he sends me there i go whatever
[48:10] he says
[48:11] i say we don't want no denomination
[48:14] this church ever talk about the
[48:16] nomination you lost your pastor right
[48:17] then
[48:18] i wouldn't hang around it for another
[48:19] five minutes every church
[48:21] that ever denominated went to seed tell
[48:24] me one that didn't and tell me one never
[48:26] rose again
[48:27] the holy spirit here we go is sent to
[48:29] lead the church
[48:31] not some group of men the holy spirit
[48:34] is all wisdom men get starchy
[48:38] and indifferent and after a while man
[48:40] get puffed up and arrogant
[48:42] and god just take his hands off for them
[48:44] they still be on the pulpit but no hand
[48:46] of god upon them
[48:47] they still have a congregation but no
[48:48] hand of god upon them they still
[48:50] minister in the world
[48:51] but no hand of god upon them the spirit
[48:53] of god take his hands
[48:54] off of them oh hallelujah you hear what
[48:57] the lord told john
[48:58] the one upon whom you see the dove
[49:00] descending it appeared in the people

[51:28] if people get revelation they run out of
[51:30] the churches eternally churches because
[51:32] recognizing pastors and found the
[51:33] revelation

[51:37] understand this
[51:38] when you hear from heaven when a man
[51:40] here from heaven changes him
[51:42] what do you think i'm the elisha why why
[51:44] elijah the prophet couldn't convince
[51:46] elijah to stay in jericho because he had
[51:50] a revelation
[51:52] of what he wanted he wanted a double
[51:55] portion
[51:56] and the sons of the prophets don't have
[51:58] that
[52:01] let me say it again the sons of the
[52:03] prophet they don't have that
[52:05] you know elijah had that and he wanted
[52:07] that
[52:08] hallelujah he knew what he wanted
[52:11] because he had a revelation of what he
[52:12] wanted

[52:17] you can possess whatever god leave your
[52:20] soul to believe
[52:20] that is yours nobody could stop it i

[56:23] can do that and if he couldn't spare one
[56:26] word

[58:38] part of god

[58:42] so must the body
[58:43] follow him back to eden listen this

[59:11] and people like the church and like the
[59:12] pastor and like this and like that
[59:14] i like the inspiration like i like the
[59:16] channel the handling with god
[59:19] is are you in the church triumphant are
[59:21] you in the savior's bride
[59:23] come and be baptized into the body
[59:25] because by one spirit not by one
[59:27] teaching
[59:28] why one spirit not by many mysteries by
[59:31] one spirit
[59:32] we are baptized into one party jew
[59:34] argentina
[59:36] everybody hundred and forty photos
[59:38] nothing gets sealed
[59:39] from the angel from the yeast having the
[59:41] seed of the living god
[59:43] they care walking about i'm a jew i'm a
[59:45] jew i'm a jew no no no no no the holy
[59:47] ghost have to recognize
[59:48] ten thousand from this tribe ten
[59:50] thousand from that tribe how much chosen
[59:51] from whichever tribe
[59:55] twelve thousand hallelujah
[59:58] recognize them and then baptize them
[1:00:01] give them a holy ghost experience
[1:00:03] oh glory to god hallelujah this is
[1:00:05] beyond the torah experience
[1:00:07] hallelujah this is not a leader in the
[1:00:08] way that you all are willing you know
[1:00:10] this is fire
[1:00:11] the same fire john was prophesying about
[1:00:14] he shall baptize you easy one
[1:00:16] go baptize you with the holy ghost on
[1:00:18] fire or give the lord some praises
[1:00:20] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:00:24] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:27] therefore what the bride being the body
[1:00:29] of the bridegroom
[1:00:30] must follow because that's the head and
[1:00:34] the head is revealed
[1:00:35] and come back with eternal life and the
[1:00:37] body must
[1:00:38] follow that because he's husband and
[1:00:41] wife
[1:00:42] hallelujah amen as long as you are
[1:00:45] pregnanted
[1:00:46] with the same word which is his body you
[1:00:49] took his body you becoming him
[1:00:50] and you took the wood not a creed
[1:00:53] anytime you're on creed you're in
[1:00:54] trouble
[1:00:55] he can't pull that that can't follow him
[1:00:58] therefore here we go
[1:00:59] the body cannot recognize
[1:01:03] he said don't feel this don't you feel
[1:01:05] this
[1:01:06] the body cannot recognize
[1:01:09] any other headship about the word
[1:01:14] so you can't point me to jessenville you
[1:01:15] can't appointment in new york you can't
[1:01:17] point me to london you can't point me to
[1:01:19] south america south africa
[1:01:20] or africa or caribbean you can't point
[1:01:22] it to a man
[1:01:25] behold the lamb of god this was the
[1:01:28] prophecy
[1:01:30] [Applause]
[1:01:36] therefore the body cannot recognize any
[1:01:37] other hatred but the word
[1:01:39] because the head is connected with the
[1:01:42] body
[1:01:42] and the hell is the word and the same
[1:01:45] word one handshape
[1:01:46] therefore there we go denominations holy
[1:01:50] fathers
[1:01:50] and everything else is dead dung i'm
[1:01:54] quoting it
[1:01:55] dead dung there is one headship
[1:01:59] that's christ the body only recognize
[1:02:02] one thing
[1:02:02] that's the word that's why the prophet
[1:02:04] said how do you
[1:02:06] how do you judge a man by how
[1:02:09] he stays with the word that is the only
[1:02:12] way you're going to judge him
[1:02:14] take the word and put it there some
[1:02:16] people don't want to be judged that was
[1:02:17] a bringing injury come true of angel
[1:02:19] who are mighty angels who meet this
[1:02:21] angel bring your angel and come all you
[1:02:22] come
[1:02:23] and let's examine your testimony by the
[1:02:25] word of god i don't want to hear you had
[1:02:27] this experience
[1:02:27] bring it back the word because the
[1:02:29] prophet examined everything by the word
[1:02:31] we recognize one thing the word
[1:02:34] you love him tonight oh my
[1:02:38] so the body must follow the head as the
[1:02:39] wife followed the husband
[1:02:41] being that adam was not deceived is not
[1:02:43] right so the body would have to comfort
[1:02:45] in the day of the lord jesus
[1:02:46] do you see it the redemption is going on
[1:02:49] now you see the seals
[1:02:50] when he was in his military look back
[1:02:52] they're redeeming but someday
[1:02:54] he comes forth to get this book that
[1:02:56] he's redeemed
[1:02:58] here we go are you ready and all that in
[1:03:01] this book would be him
[1:03:02] for that's the deliver the words of the
[1:03:05] book
[1:03:06] that's a believer that's you you are
[1:03:08] what the words of the book
[1:03:10] so that's why the words of the book had
[1:03:12] to be spoken because
[1:03:14] in the book had your name hallelujah
[1:03:16] name was sealed
[1:03:17] oh glory to god the devil couldn't
[1:03:19] interrupt the unsealing of your name
[1:03:21] so when we say seal not the saint of the
[1:03:23] prophecy adam was supposed to call your
[1:03:25] name
[1:03:26] he fell the book went up and come down
[1:03:29] revelation 10
[1:03:30] whole glory to god and putting on books
[1:03:32] and tapes that's why
[1:03:33] this message had to find you oh glory to
[1:03:35] god because you are the words of the
[1:03:37] book
[1:03:38] oh glory to god when you hear the word
[1:03:39] priest you are hearing your name
[1:03:41] you know how yes stories nancy stories
[1:03:43] you know your imagination on some dream
[1:03:45] last night you want to hear the word
[1:03:47] isn't that right she cannot recognize
[1:03:49] any other headship notion
[1:03:50] no bishop no nothing she recognizing one
[1:03:53] handshape jesus christ
[1:03:54] here we go the word properly vindicated
[1:03:58] is the headship
[1:04:01] as isaac will say when you're driving
[1:04:02] slow you see more things
[1:04:04] not just the word because you can say
[1:04:06] the word have a book of the word a
[1:04:08] plainer tip of the word no
[1:04:10] the word properly
[1:04:13] vindicated is the headship the head of
[1:04:16] the church
[1:04:17] he is the word headship he is properly
[1:04:20] identified
[1:04:21] and vindicated by his own spirit being
[1:04:24] in the church itself
[1:04:26] the person take that whole mouthful let
[1:04:29] me read it again
[1:04:30] we need to read this one again
[1:04:34] the word properly vindicated
[1:04:37] this is not some possibility some
[1:04:39] message and you say thank you saints i
[1:04:41] hope this voice was a blessing to you
[1:04:43] not that story
[1:04:44] this is not i hope it was a blessing to
[1:04:46] you this is not that now
[1:04:47] this is the word properly vindicated
[1:04:51] here's the word headship he's the
[1:04:53] properly identified
[1:04:55] vindicated by his own spirit being in
[1:04:58] the church itself
[1:04:59] the person showing for himself
[1:05:03] a vindication is the direct proof to the
[1:05:07] entire
[1:05:08] body you don't need creeds then
[1:05:11] denomination has perished but the
[1:05:13] headship itself recognized
[1:05:15] in the body by personal identification
[1:05:19] see identifying himself proves the
[1:05:22] headship to the body
[1:05:23] then we are united under one vindicated
[1:05:25] headship that is christ the word
[1:05:27] oh my then united under the headset then
[1:05:31] he said
[1:05:32] then our headship is a kingdom aha that
[1:05:35] changes
[1:05:35] everything now that changes church and
[1:05:38] who is your pastor
[1:05:39] that changes where you go it changes
[1:05:41] everything because afterwards the
[1:05:42] headship then you recognize now
[1:05:44] headship is a kingdom the kingdom of god
[1:05:47] is within you
[1:05:48] then the kingdom we are not a
[1:05:50] denomination we belong to our kingdom
[1:05:52] and the kingdom here we go is the word
[1:05:55] of god
[1:05:56] made spirit and life in your own life
[1:06:02] bringing to pass is that stop
[1:06:05] every promise in this day as it did in
[1:06:08] that day when the word and god was won
[1:06:10] that is the kingdom within you what is
[1:06:14] that
[1:06:14] the word made spirit and life in your
[1:06:17] life
[1:06:18] bringing to pass every promise promise
[1:06:20] for this day
[1:06:21] oh i feel like a run through a troop
[1:06:24] right now oh glory to god
[1:06:26] that's why you said when you're here
[1:06:27] they say come here look at here look at
[1:06:28] here we have the revolution here there's
[1:06:30] the only place have it here there's the
[1:06:31] next place happened here he said
[1:06:32] whatever you know the kingdom is written
[1:06:34] in you
[1:06:35] anytime you decide to identify a
[1:06:36] man-made structure kingdom
[1:06:38] sometimes on some tenth covenant forget
[1:06:42] it
[1:06:42] the kingdom is where within you and the
[1:06:46] kingdom is what
[1:06:47] the word turn the spirit in like what's
[1:06:50] the secret
[1:06:51] the word is in the bribe so the word
[1:06:53] after we poured into you
[1:06:54] placed into you preaching to you seated
[1:06:57] into you but then there comes an hour
[1:06:59] when that word becomes spirit and life
[1:07:01] in your life
[1:07:02] then you belong to a kingdom hallelujah
[1:07:06] isn't that right and his body will do
[1:07:08] the works that he promised like in mark
[1:07:09] 16
[1:07:11] and watch don't to the age of luther
[1:07:12] wesley has begun to raise up to its
[1:07:15] power hallelujah let me read it again
[1:07:17] the word that was done to the age of
[1:07:20] luther wesley
[1:07:21] has begun to raise up to its power
[1:07:26] they begin to move let it move a little
[1:07:29] more
[1:07:30] and now it's coming up to identification
[1:07:33] so sometimes in time
[1:07:34] it have to change from what the prophet
[1:07:38] to the prophet's prophecy when you begin
[1:07:40] to see it coming alive
[1:07:42] or you begin to see it being fulfilled
[1:07:45] so listen to this important part now
[1:07:47] now to the life in the body
[1:07:51] is a vindication of the rapture is at
[1:07:53] hand
[1:07:54] so we can't say rapture coming soon and
[1:07:56] there's no life
[1:07:58] life have to come to the bright body and
[1:08:01] when you see the evidence of that life
[1:08:04] with some time ago we preach about the
[1:08:05] appearing of the lord it will be a
[1:08:07] vindication
[1:08:09] that the rapture is at hand here is it's
[1:08:12] when you see the headship and the
[1:08:16] body becoming one continue
[1:08:19] and the fullness of the measure of his
[1:08:22] manifestation
[1:08:24] shows that the body is about ready to
[1:08:27] receive to the headship
[1:08:29] so first revelation teaching
[1:08:33] inspiration but then when they switch
[1:08:35] over and begin to come into
[1:08:36] manifestation
[1:08:38] then you know we're heading up to
[1:08:39] receive the headship
[1:08:41] so we can't get around it no mini second
[1:08:43] got it wrong i think it was mystery how
[1:08:45] much revelation
[1:08:46] new name this name or whatever name they
[1:08:48] have whatever whatever they have
[1:08:50] they still have to come back to the part
[1:08:52] that it has to be manifested
[1:08:54] oh go away to god you have to walk on
[1:08:56] your house and devils have to scatter
[1:08:58] and head through the windows
[1:08:59] head to the corners as you walk inside
[1:09:01] the deer the enforcer oh god don't let
[1:09:03] me go there
[1:09:04] the enforcer you see that yet the
[1:09:06] message will i see that
[1:09:07] the enforcer going home with you oh give
[1:09:10] the lord a shout
[1:09:11] right now we talking we prophesy and we
[1:09:13] saying we plead and we anoint him
[1:09:15] but when they're all gonna come when the
[1:09:18] enforcer gonna be walking with you
[1:09:20] whatever you say it have to happen it's
[1:09:22] got to come to pass
[1:09:23] all glory to god because the fire is
[1:09:25] there to charge every word
[1:09:27] that's coming out your mouth oh glory to
[1:09:29] god come here
[1:09:31] cornelius was a predestinated seed god
[1:09:33] arranged a connection between peter and
[1:09:34] cornelius corneas couldn't miss it if we
[1:09:36] try
[1:09:37] hallelujah peter didn't understand what
[1:09:39] he was getting into
[1:09:40] but he was just speaking the word
[1:09:41] thinking there's words coming out like
[1:09:43] that
[1:09:43] but while periods speak these words holy
[1:09:46] ghost
[1:09:47] the enforcer hallelujah come and baptize
[1:09:50] cornelius with the fire oh glory to god
[1:09:52] what mystery he knew
[1:09:53] hallelujah what kind of revelation in
[1:09:54] you how much bible teachings he got

[1:12:04] no other life but the capstone
[1:12:15] you talk about the devil the devil is
[1:12:17] building a hybrid church
[1:12:19] hybrid members hybrid by knowledge
[1:12:22] instead of the word
[1:12:24] you know you place that knowledge
[1:12:26] instead of the word
[1:12:28] you see the word is what the prophet
[1:12:29] brought as prophecy
[1:12:32] as the word knowledge is could be
[1:12:35] interpretation
[1:12:36] men's idea something come to them they
[1:12:38] open up this way
[1:12:40] but what we're dealing with now is the
[1:12:41] word itself you see i had a revelation
[1:12:43] that a long time that the word coming
[1:12:45] out the prophet saw is god
[1:12:47] that is why i try to echo and say back
[1:12:49] what the tapes say
[1:12:51] by inspiration and revelation we have
[1:12:53] our understanding everything is a seed
[1:12:55] oh glory hallelujah a while
[1:12:58] before coming out here to preach it
[1:13:01] struck me that this mighty angel
[1:13:03] the one with the swept back wings the
[1:13:05] one that comes in around ten
[1:13:06] he is the chief messenger he is the
[1:13:08] chief of the seven
[1:13:10] earthly angels that man who command one
[1:13:13] with the amen with the rainbow over his
[1:13:15] head
[1:13:16] nice christ and christ know what the
[1:13:18] prophets say
[1:13:20] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:13:22] did you get that
[1:13:23] christ he knows the prophecy from the
[1:13:25] prophet because he is the one who
[1:13:26] uttered it
[1:13:28] oh give the lord a shout or he will
[1:13:29] vindicate hallelujah what the prophet
[1:13:32] said oh i feel that we have a show with
[1:13:34] a prophecy to say
[1:13:36] thank you lord he said watch hybrid
[1:13:38] knowledge instead of the word
[1:13:39] by intellectual men instead of born
[1:13:42] again
[1:13:43] men building an intellectual kingdom
[1:13:46] that will outshine christ little bitty
[1:13:48] flock
[1:13:48] what is it that what what is that fallen
[1:13:52] angels
[1:13:56] the bible said it was false angels who
[1:13:59] listen to lucifer instead of christ
[1:14:01] isn't that right now listen close these
[1:14:03] are not my words son
[1:14:05] fallen angels what kind of angels luther
[1:14:09] wesley his name in it
[1:14:13] luther wesley catholic pentecostals
[1:14:17] who kept not their first estate like the
[1:14:20] ancients did and fell into organizations
[1:14:23] that is what he called fallen angels so
[1:14:25] fallen angels
[1:14:26] gave birth to organizations and the
[1:14:29] reading bible and quoting seals
[1:14:31] oh harlow oh glory to god
[1:14:35] he said organize a great economical
[1:14:38] associated ministers to make an
[1:14:40] immigration to the peace as the bible
[1:14:41] said
[1:14:42] and building a christian economy that
[1:14:43] will close the doors of this church
[1:14:45] and others like it see lucifer at his
[1:14:47] work
[1:14:48] and i am trying to bring you
[1:14:51] the truthful revelation or a mystery of
[1:14:55] god
[1:14:56] and what was that truthful revelation
[1:14:57] number one to reveal himself
[1:14:59] god was too mysterious so he had issues
[1:15:01] with that he said he had to reveal
[1:15:02] himself yeah they come down
[1:15:03] in a special then the number two is i
[1:15:05] have the preeminences number three
[1:15:06] to go back to eden we can't go back to
[1:15:09] eating with all the preeminences
[1:15:10] because he didn't need the same image
[1:15:12] and likeness to have dominion over
[1:15:14] so god had to bring back a revelation of
[1:15:16] the image and likeness
[1:15:18] what adam had to return us back to eden
[1:15:20] so that is where the prophet took the
[1:15:22] image
[1:15:23] from second peter 147 and throw it in a
[1:15:25] pyramid and say
[1:15:26] that is the secret that enoch had how he
[1:15:28] left the earth his mechanics became
[1:15:30] dynamics and god took him
[1:15:32] or give the lord a shout and that same
[1:15:33] bride going to connect back
[1:15:35] with that statue of a perfect man that
[1:15:37] same image and he said this being when
[1:15:39] it's completed
[1:15:40] is the servant of god in the church of
[1:15:42] god that's going in a rapture
[1:15:43] not a man preaching mysteries this being
[1:15:45] when it's completed
[1:15:46] oh glory to god i keep saying over and
[1:15:48] over adoption is not based upon a man's
[1:15:50] sermon is based upon
[1:15:52] a man's behavior oh glory to god after
[1:15:54] we preach after we teach
[1:15:55] after we do what we do god see how we
[1:15:57] live oh give the lord some praises
[1:16:00] that had changed for nobody what we need
[1:16:02] is thousands of live voices
[1:16:04] the thunder of god in sweetness and
[1:16:06] humility
[1:16:07] oh hallelujah whereas he was the man of
[1:16:10] god
[1:16:10] but what followed him fallen just got
[1:16:12] into it
[1:16:13] so waiting happened this message it's in
[1:16:15] the prophet left
[1:16:17] bunch of fallen ninjas fall into it
[1:16:19] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:16:21] hallelujah wait anybody go to fight with
[1:16:23] them
[1:16:24] we had to fight with them hallelujah a
[1:16:27] fallen angel
[1:16:28] what was it creative beings of god that
[1:16:30] fell for looting for wisdom
[1:16:31] fell for lucifer's wisdom fallen angels
[1:16:33] come in took it over made denominations
[1:16:35] out of it
[1:16:36] that's the reason the revelation the
[1:16:37] seventh seal had to be unfolded
[1:16:39] and there is only one thing that
[1:16:40] happened there has to be a message at
[1:16:43] the end time
[1:16:43] when there is nothing else can follow it
[1:16:45] oh glory to god when
[1:16:47] i'm finished nothing is supposed to
[1:16:48] follow that because this is the end
[1:16:50] this is where it has no impersonation to
[1:16:52] it satan do all the impersonation all
[1:16:54] the acting but when you come to face
[1:16:56] this bride there'll be no impersonation
[1:16:57] whatsoever
[1:16:58] oh glory to god the final showdown he
[1:17:00] said the fruit is at the top
[1:17:02] of the tree and the light is shining on
[1:17:04] that predestinated fruit
[1:17:05] and she is ripening the christ like
[1:17:07] fruit bringing forth the same
[1:17:09] mellowness and sweetness and the same
[1:17:11] spirit that he had in them
[1:17:12] hope you see it oh praise god here's
[1:17:14] lucifer at his job again
[1:17:16] remember the antichrist is not communism
[1:17:18] the antichrist is so close like the real
[1:17:20] thing
[1:17:20] they see the very elect if possible
[1:17:22] lucifer again
[1:17:23] breaking god's unity in man by his
[1:17:27] limiting the word of god to human
[1:17:29] reasoning that's why i'm looking for the
[1:17:31] power of god to strike the church i'm
[1:17:32] looking for the holy ghost to pour it
[1:17:33] right in your home
[1:17:34] here's why because the holy ghost is
[1:17:36] poured out on individuals you don't even
[1:17:38] have to be in church to receive the holy
[1:17:40] ghost oh get the lord and shout where
[1:17:41] you are
[1:17:42] hallelujah right now because the holy
[1:17:44] ghost is poured out on individuals
[1:17:47] thank you lord jesus hallelujah lucifer
[1:17:50] comes in kindness and breaks the unity
[1:17:52] of god to man
[1:17:53] just like he did in eden by great
[1:17:55] temptations of promises of
[1:17:59] self power and exaltation
[1:18:03] let me do that again lucifer brings
[1:18:05] great temptations
[1:18:07] of self-power and exaltations
[1:18:11] why you might become a bishop if you
[1:18:12] stay with us you might even be
[1:18:14] five-fold dear faithful
[1:18:18] you may come a district presbyter but
[1:18:20] brother ram says
[1:18:21] what's false promises to men to receive
[1:18:23] power outside the word
[1:18:25] hala you receive power when the holy
[1:18:27] ghost come upon you
[1:18:29] not when you become a bishop or a titan
[1:18:31] or whatever it is
[1:18:32] that's lucifer on his job again so
[1:18:35] office and post is irrelevant
[1:18:37] power comes by the holy ghost be it you
[1:18:40] are elder deacon trusty i don't care
[1:18:42] what you are usher it doesn't matter
[1:18:43] you still need holy ghost power you
[1:18:45] still need holy ghost to overcome
[1:18:47] you still need power to live power to
[1:18:49] pray power to say i forgive you
[1:18:51] hallelujah power to forgive that is why
[1:18:52] the holy ghost was given
[1:18:54] for oh glory to god power to get a
[1:18:56] revival in your soul
[1:18:57] hallelujah do you believe that lucifer
[1:19:01] coming cunning like he did then
[1:19:02] by temptations false promises of power
[1:19:05] outside
[1:19:06] and apart from the word oh
[1:19:10] praise god hallelujah he said well glory
[1:19:13] to god i've seen all kind of fleshly
[1:19:14] manifestation that scanner
[1:19:16] but i am talking about the headship of
[1:19:17] christ notice
[1:19:19] being personally identified by the
[1:19:22] original headship
[1:19:23] we have the answer to the devil's
[1:19:25] question he said glory amen
[1:19:27] we have the answer to the devil's
[1:19:29] question christ
[1:19:30] is risen and paid the price and he is
[1:19:33] risen the devil can't stand it
[1:19:34] and that's the reason these economical
[1:19:36] kingdoms are setting up
[1:19:38] that's the reason they're coming into
[1:19:39] what they're doing now that's the reason
[1:19:40] he's howling the way he is
[1:19:42] his scheme has been uncovered by the
[1:19:44] risen resurrected christ
[1:19:45] and the headship over his body oh glory
[1:19:47] to god you think the devil don't know
[1:19:48] when power works start to move
[1:19:50] and manifest itself just think about it
[1:19:52] now holy ghost fire and power fell in
[1:19:54] the upper room

[1:20:02] pour all over them the quickening power
[1:20:04] they're speaking in tongues and they're
[1:20:05] staggering like junkling up in the upper

[1:36:40] so this man john anointed with elijah's
[1:36:42] spirit came out of the wilderness in
[1:36:44] that right
[1:36:44] a wild man he said and then afterwards
[1:36:47] he said
[1:36:48] there a few weeks after that that man
[1:36:50] was so positive in his message so he was
[1:36:52] preaching for a while
[1:36:54] and after a while mountain hit him
[1:36:56] strike him he said there's one standing
[1:36:58] among you
[1:36:58] all the time he wasn't preaching that
[1:37:00] message that title
[1:37:02] that that morning messi was one stand
[1:37:03] among you
[1:37:06] that that silver untitled was there was
[1:37:08] one standing among you
[1:37:10] there was one standing among you said
[1:37:11] the prophecy whose shoes are not he said
[1:37:13] he could baptize you with holy ghost on
[1:37:15] fire
[1:37:16] say think i i'm something he said i
[1:37:18] don't know
[1:37:22] [Music]
[1:37:26] there's one standing among you who
[1:37:27] should not worthy he will baptize you
[1:37:28] with the holy ghost and fire
[1:37:30] as i have baptized with water look at
[1:37:33] the comparison
[1:37:34] so how come you want to explain the way
[1:37:35] the holy ghost
[1:37:38] john was baptizing water dip
[1:37:42] so how you get back from the holy ghost
[1:37:44] god take care and dip
[1:37:46] when you're dipping the spirit you must
[1:37:47] come up with spirit
[1:37:51] save the dependent water it'll get wet
[1:37:53] so how are you going to dip in this
[1:37:54] plate and you'll have an experience
[1:37:58] same he will baptize with the holy ghost
[1:38:01] as i
[1:38:02] have baptized with water so instead of
[1:38:04] water now what i am doing
[1:38:06] fire coming for you one day an ordinary
[1:38:08] young man
[1:38:09] about 30 years old walked down or
[1:38:11] baptized and when this man come
[1:38:14] there was such an attraction by the
[1:38:17] prophet
[1:38:18] the prophet act strange that day the
[1:38:20] congregation couldn't help but watching
[1:38:22] the action of that prophet
[1:38:24] while he was debating with the priests
[1:38:26] he said behold malachi he said behold i
[1:38:28] said am i messing with my face
[1:38:30] don't you know this fulfilled prophecy
[1:38:32] and this is where i get the inspiration
[1:38:34] from today
[1:38:35] and about that time the prophet turned
[1:38:37] and said behold here comes the lamb of
[1:38:39] god
[1:38:40] that takes away the sin of the world now
[1:38:42] what's the attraction
[1:38:44] and this is where i get it from it
[1:38:45] changed from the prophet
[1:38:48] to his prophecy now notice what comes to
[1:38:52] pass
[1:38:52] here come an ordinary man known to no
[1:38:55] one carpenter's son come walking out of
[1:38:56] the water
[1:38:57] and when john the great prophet said i
[1:38:59] have need to be baptized of thee why
[1:39:00] comes out to me
[1:39:01] he says suffer that to be so but as a
[1:39:03] prophet and the word it behooves us to
[1:39:05] fulfill righteousness
[1:39:06] so he understood the sacrifice had to be
[1:39:08] washed before
[1:39:10] presented and he baptized him and
[1:39:13] there's another attraction take place
[1:39:14] when he went out of the water
[1:39:16] the prophet this prophet who had been so
[1:39:18] loyal to declare this age and time
[1:39:20] he looked up he saw the heavens open and
[1:39:23] he saw the spirit of god like a dove
[1:39:25] descending upon him and a voice said
[1:39:27] this is my beloved son
[1:39:29] in whom i'm well pleased god here we go
[1:39:33] was vindicating a prophet's message
[1:39:37] what was attracting the attention at the
[1:39:39] jordan
[1:39:41] at the jordan he was vindicating a
[1:39:44] prophet's message
[1:39:45] isn't that right oh glory to god so the
[1:39:48] prophecy
[1:39:49] that was released by this end time
[1:39:50] prophet messenger what was it it was
[1:39:52] jesus christ
[1:39:53] it was charity and that's why it changed
[1:39:56] from the prophet
[1:39:57] to his prophecy it changed the seven
[1:40:00] seals
[1:40:01] isn't that right even jesus christ
[1:40:03] because the prophet said those seals are
[1:40:05] christ
[1:40:06] all the sins are jesus christ he is
[1:40:08] those seals
[1:40:09] isn't that right so the prophecy that
[1:40:12] the prophet brought to us
[1:40:13] hallelujah glory to god first the shout
[1:40:17] and then the voice and then the trump
[1:40:19] isn't that right
[1:40:20] no more men angels isn't that right
[1:40:23] after the prophet they find a shout what
[1:40:25] will it define the voice not the
[1:40:26] archangel the voice of
[1:40:29] the archangel comes down upon a bride
[1:40:33] the secret it is the words and the bride
[1:40:34] isn't that right and she has what the
[1:40:36] mind of christ to know
[1:40:37] what he wants done with the word at one
[1:40:40] time the prophet said i wish i had the
[1:40:42] voice
[1:40:43] of an archangel to bring it to a place
[1:40:45] where you could
[1:40:46] see it so the voice of the archangels
[1:40:49] bring clarity
[1:40:51] to the word to the vision to god's
[1:40:54] people
[1:40:55] isn't that right isn't that right so
[1:40:57] therefore this chief messenger
[1:40:59] this voice this archangel this this
[1:41:02] mighty angel
[1:41:03] is what the prophet came to introduce oh
[1:41:06] glory to god because brother branagh he
[1:41:07] was the eyes
[1:41:08] and next is what the intelligence which
[1:41:10] is the mind of christ which is christ
[1:41:12] himself
[1:41:13] to come upon a bride she said and she
[1:41:15] has the mind of christ to know
[1:41:17] what he wants done with the word not to
[1:41:19] know the word what he wants
[1:41:20] done with the word not done with his
[1:41:24] word and she do it in his name
[1:41:25] she does it in his name what why what
[1:41:28] what she has
[1:41:29] the intelligence the mind of christ
[1:41:31] hallelujah praise god
[1:41:33] so we have to see evidence of christ
[1:41:36] having rain
[1:41:37] over his people we have to see evidence
[1:41:40] of his rulership
[1:41:41] hallelujah of his given directions of
[1:41:44] him
[1:41:44] of his authority coming back among the
[1:41:46] people then you know is that a man
[1:41:48] speaking that a man trying something is
[1:41:50] christ reigning and ruling
[1:41:52] giving supernatural instructions
[1:41:54] hallelujah giving guidance
[1:41:56] oh glory to god when joshua want to take
[1:41:58] jericho
[1:41:59] trying to figure it out the angel came
[1:42:01] oh hallelujah to give him what
[1:42:03] instructions
[1:42:04] hallelujah the captain of the horse that
[1:42:06] was the chief
[1:42:07] that appeared to joshua then joshua
[1:42:10] could tell the people hallelujah do this
[1:42:12] do that walk around do this give him

[1:43:41] mysteries of god as revealed to paul

[1:44:03] writings under that
[1:44:05] that is a general statement hallelujah
[1:44:08] to be part of that bride that'll be part
[1:44:09] of the body
[1:44:10] oh glory to god not just hear but obey
[1:44:13] what the prophet said
[1:44:15] is that right watch and who are
[1:44:17] mentioned in revelation 2017 the spirits
[1:44:19] and the bright side come
[1:44:20] the corner wheat bride wheat that fell
[1:44:23] into the ground at nicer
[1:44:24] has come back to original wood grain
[1:44:26] again yes

[1:44:29] god who appears in his last age
[1:44:32] what he says from god the bride will say
[1:44:36] the spirit and the prophet
[1:44:39] and the bride will be saying the same
[1:44:42] thing
[1:44:43] and what they will say will have already
[1:44:46] been said in the word
[1:44:48] they are saying it now come out from
[1:44:50] among us now
[1:44:51] and be separate the cry has gone out
[1:44:55] the cry is going out how long will the
[1:44:57] voice cry we do not know but one thing
[1:44:59] we don't know
[1:44:59] it won't be long for this is the last
[1:45:01] age
[1:45:03] oh glory to god there are so many voices
[1:45:05] in the earth today
[1:45:07] that it's absolutely a hard thing to
[1:45:09] hear the voice of god
[1:45:10] because here's why it deadens the voice
[1:45:14] of the supernatural so when people are
[1:45:17] the creeds and say you have to believe
[1:45:18] it this way
[1:45:19] and that way and they have no god behind
[1:45:22] their creeds
[1:45:23] you know there's a problem let me say it
[1:45:25] again they have their creeds
[1:45:27] they have the doctrines and the
[1:45:28] teachings and they're saying you have to
[1:45:30] believe it this way or that way or
[1:45:32] you're out of it
[1:45:33] and they have no god behind the creeds
[1:45:35] you know these problems
[1:45:37] hallelujah there are so many voices in
[1:45:39] here today
[1:45:40] it's absolutely a hard thing because it
[1:45:42] deadens
[1:45:44] the voice of the supernatural
[1:45:47] there are so many intellectual voices
[1:45:49] great voices of
[1:45:50] mighty men who are intellectual in the
[1:45:54] message we talk about them
[1:45:55] and in their intellectual conditions
[1:45:58] they
[1:45:58] shake nations they are not overnight
[1:46:01] people but they
[1:46:02] shake nations bringing great
[1:46:03] organization flowery campaign
[1:46:05] and a person could be a bit confused
[1:46:08] it's enough to confuse them
[1:46:09] how these things that go on and prosper
[1:46:13] and their voices that raise up that do
[1:46:15] these things and cause the voice of god
[1:46:17] to be placed way back somewhere the true
[1:46:19] voice of god
[1:46:22] and the voice of god is see how
[1:46:25] will we know is the voice of god because
[1:46:28] mark voice of god in it
[1:46:29] or if i'm voice of god recording that we
[1:46:31] know or mark our book more spoken word
[1:46:33] that's not how we know the voice of god
[1:46:35] not today that wasn't brother branham
[1:46:37] time
[1:46:38] okay but how do we know it today he said
[1:46:41] what
[1:46:41] now today how we know is the voice of
[1:46:44] god
[1:46:44] he said because today then it wasn't a
[1:46:47] vindicated prophet
[1:46:49] right william branham but today
[1:46:52] how do we know it's the voice of god
[1:46:54] because
[1:46:55] it's the manifestation of the prophet's
[1:46:58] word
[1:46:58] oh glory to god in other words it's the
[1:47:01] prophet
[1:47:02] prophecy being made manifest that is how
[1:47:05] we know
[1:47:05] it's the voice of god it's not playing
[1:47:07] back brother brown tapes no no no it's a
[1:47:09] manifestation of what is on the tapes
[1:47:11] or give the lord a shout in other words
[1:47:13] we have to be able to say
[1:47:14] this is that that the prophet william
[1:47:17] random speak of
[1:47:18] oh glory to god that is the
[1:47:20] identification oh glory to god the
[1:47:21] fulfillment of the prophet's prophecy
[1:47:24] he said today let me read it again how
[1:47:26] do we know is the voice of god
[1:47:27] because then it wasn't a vindicated
[1:47:29] prophet which is himself
[1:47:31] now today how do we know the voice of
[1:47:33] god because
[1:47:34] it's the manifestation of the prophet's
[1:47:36] word this is god's prophet
[1:47:38] and a true voice of god only brings back
[1:47:42] that real
[1:47:43] living supernatural god with a
[1:47:45] supernatural word
[1:47:47] with the supernatural manifestation
[1:47:50] of the true word oh glory to god all
[1:47:53] goes together
[1:47:54] as a package then we know it's the voice
[1:47:56] of god
[1:47:57] oh my can we take some more hallelujah
[1:48:00] hallelujah
[1:48:01] with every prophecy there's a process
[1:48:05] prophecy doesn't just happen
[1:48:08] hallelujah when when when when the
[1:48:11] prophet
[1:48:12] elijah told the people in that bible
[1:48:16] story that barajas spoke about this
[1:48:18] he said tomorrow it will be sofa shekel
[1:48:22] the more you'll have food that have a
[1:48:24] way to fulfill
[1:48:26] that is just happening just like that it
[1:48:28] has four men
[1:48:30] four who was having a conference
[1:48:33] as to what to do at that very hour
[1:48:36] hallelujah and they decide
[1:48:38] they was controlling things you know
[1:48:41] they decide
[1:48:42] if we stay here let's figure this thing
[1:48:44] out let's let's work on this thing
[1:48:46] we we we out here so long if we stay
[1:48:49] here we have no food out there
[1:48:51] but has that masterfully brought out it
[1:48:53] wasn't the leprosy there was something
[1:48:54] about dinner
[1:48:55] there wasn't concern about dying of
[1:48:57] leprosy that concept was dynasty
[1:49:00] they gotta do it's a good meal so they
[1:49:03] said we stay here we die
[1:49:05] we goose cook we finish
[1:49:08] right here if we go back they starving
[1:49:10] inside not only that
[1:49:12] they don't want them inside so we could
[1:49:13] go back inside but if we go to the enemy
[1:49:15] camp
[1:49:16] go to the syrian maybe 50 50. hallelujah
[1:49:20] they might kill us they might feed us
[1:49:23] and when they say let's move show
[1:49:24] god calls but i'm saying you had to do
[1:49:28] something for something to happen
[1:49:29] you take a rock and chew it up in the
[1:49:30] air oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:49:33] and when he tried up in the air
[1:49:35] something happened don't come a
[1:49:36] whirlwind
[1:49:37] when they move god caused a rumbling to
[1:49:38] hit that nick it was so terrible then
[1:49:41] fellas
[1:49:41] leave the horses and run around they run
[1:49:43] drop everything and run it was time to
[1:49:45] take off god
[1:49:45] god about to make a mighty mighty move
[1:49:47] in 24 hours
[1:49:49] i love that i like her that's my message
[1:49:51] of preaching in 24 hours
[1:49:52] a mighty move of god mighty miracle of
[1:49:55] god mighty working of god hallelujah
[1:49:57] so these men was the process by which
[1:50:00] the prophets of elisha
[1:50:01] was being fulfilled so let's just get
[1:50:03] one or two and i'll show you what i mean
[1:50:05] with every prophecy there's a process to
[1:50:07] get to that prophecy so when herod this
[1:50:09] in matthew 2
[1:50:10] when herrera the king had heard these
[1:50:11] things he was troubled all jerusalem
[1:50:13] with him
[1:50:13] i skipped them and they said when he and
[1:50:16] and when he had gathered all the chief
[1:50:18] priests
[1:50:18] and scribe of the people together he
[1:50:20] demanded of them where christ should be
[1:50:22] born
[1:50:22] all and fellas so backstage them three
[1:50:24] wise men come and shake up the whole
[1:50:25] jerusalem
[1:50:26] when he asks them now and they tell him
[1:50:27] but in bethlehem of judea for this is
[1:50:29] written by the prophet
[1:50:30] so they quote in scripture the opening
[1:50:32] scrolls now don't beat them in the land
[1:50:34] of judah at not released among the
[1:50:35] prisoners of judah
[1:50:36] although he shall come for the governor
[1:50:38] so now can hear it know that that's the
[1:50:40] prophecy
[1:50:41] isn't that right but here the process
[1:50:43] luke 2 he came to pass in those days
[1:50:45] that they went to the decree from caesar
[1:50:47] augustus that all the world should be
[1:50:49] taxed
[1:50:50] and this taxi was made in sarinas was
[1:50:51] governor of syria and all went to be
[1:50:53] taxed
[1:50:54] everyone to his own city and joseph also
[1:50:57] from galilee
[1:50:58] out of the city of nazareth and judea
[1:50:59] under the city of david which is called
[1:51:01] bethlehem
[1:51:01] to be taxed with mary his exposed wife
[1:51:04] being great to a child so that was the
[1:51:06] process
[1:51:07] decree for taxation force joseph and
[1:51:10] mary to get into position
[1:51:11] to fulfill prophecy or give the lord a
[1:51:14] shout
[1:51:14] god going to force the issue to make
[1:51:17] sure we're in position
[1:51:18] to fulfill the prophecy my my
[1:51:21] my hallelujah glory to god the prophecy
[1:51:25] saint john 20 then jesus said unto them
[1:51:27] peace be unto you
[1:51:28] as my father sent me even so center you
[1:51:31] and when he said this
[1:51:32] he breathed on them he said receiving
[1:51:35] the holy ghost
[1:51:36] hallelujah that's the prophecy here the
[1:51:38] process
[1:51:39] luke 24 that was john 20 luke 24 and
[1:51:42] behold
[1:51:43] i sent the promise of my father upon you
[1:51:45] but ty in the seat of jerusalem
[1:51:46] until they endured apart from on high
[1:51:48] and he led them as fast to bethany
[1:51:50] and he lifted up his hands and blessed
[1:51:51] them and it came to pass while he
[1:51:53] blessed them
[1:51:53] he was parted from them and tied up in
[1:51:55] heaven and they worshipped him
[1:51:57] and returned to jerusalem with great joy
[1:52:00] and were continuing the temple praising
[1:52:02] and blessing god so that is he possessed
[1:52:04] to get to the prophecy
[1:52:06] of receiving the holy ghost the heart
[1:52:07] was to be praising and blessing god
[1:52:09] they see him go they know he went up
[1:52:11] they saw jesus go
[1:52:12] they ain't crying for jesus and begin
[1:52:14] with jesus say he says i don't go
[1:52:16] the comforter will not come that has
[1:52:17] stayed here and begin to worship and
[1:52:19] praise dear god hallelujah
[1:52:21] praise god so god is not just concerned
[1:52:24] about you getting to the finish line
[1:52:25] but not but how you get there because
[1:52:28] there are no shortcuts
[1:52:30] you can't be staying home and looking

[1:52:36] coming to your window nobody
[1:52:37] lifting up the roof and dropping down a
[1:52:39] job for you isn't that right
[1:52:41] you can't expect to pass on exams if
[1:52:43] you're not studying for it
[1:52:44] it is the process that is the important
[1:52:46] part hallelujah praised god

[1:52:50] could come if you're prepared to go
[1:52:52] through the process
[1:52:53] same thing apply to revival and healing
[1:52:55] and deliverance and so forth
[1:52:57] hallelujah praised god so you got to

[1:54:59] of god we find a church in an anemic
[1:55:01] condition
[1:55:02] we ought to be great here we go we ought
[1:55:04] to be strong
[1:55:05] mighty wires of the faith that was shake
[1:55:08] a nation god give it to us we should
[1:55:10] just receive it
[1:55:12] not weak not anemic but we ought to be
[1:55:15] strong
[1:55:16] so much i will shake the nation oh my he
[1:55:18] came us sinners that we might become his
[1:55:20] righteousness
[1:55:21] oh my hallelujah praise god he said no
[1:55:25] not he that starts is he that finishes
[1:55:27] there are no shortcuts
[1:55:28] you are disqualified at the end of the
[1:55:30] race no shortcuts you must come
[1:55:32] the way the scripture said he said you
[1:55:34] come except you die to yourself and be
[1:55:36] born of the spirit of god
[1:55:38] you're lost oh my hallelujah
[1:55:41] oh my hitting the home stretch here
[1:55:43] praise the lord
[1:55:44] thank you jesus thank you jesus except
[1:55:47] you die
[1:55:48] to yourself oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:55:52] thank you lord so he said it this way
[1:55:55] there were many men raised up
[1:55:56] they have been for hundreds of years
[1:55:58] they had no prophet and then john came
[1:55:59] isn't that right
[1:56:00] and when he here we freeze this now and
[1:56:03] then
[1:56:04] when he come on the scene to prove that
[1:56:06] he was that ephesians made
[1:56:08] manifest that's what we're gonna call
[1:56:10] christ christ says what
[1:56:13] that ephesians made manifest
[1:56:17] john announced it but jesus was that
[1:56:21] he was the word manifested himself
[1:56:25] oh glory to god thank you lord so as
[1:56:28] john was sent to wine of the old
[1:56:31] testament
[1:56:32] and to bring forth the introduction of
[1:56:34] christ
[1:56:35] a message will wind up the loose ends
[1:56:38] and will
[1:56:39] introduce the messiah
[1:56:42] just before his coming
[1:56:45] the message in the last days so wait a
[1:56:47] minute but the banner was the introduced
[1:56:49] messiah yes
[1:56:50] who is the messiah luke 17 30 this sort
[1:56:52] of man
[1:56:53] oh my just think now the mighty angel
[1:56:57] swore the angel come from heaven the
[1:57:00] seven angels of the seven church ages
[1:57:02] earthly messengers
[1:57:03] but this angel all the messages
[1:57:06] finished the seven angels wind up the
[1:57:08] whole thing and this
[1:57:10] angel comes not he isn't a man from the
[1:57:12] earth
[1:57:13] as the messenger of the church ages
[1:57:15] that's finished but this angel
[1:57:17] brings the next announcement that
[1:57:19] israeli messenger
[1:57:21] he comes from heaven a rainbow over his
[1:57:23] head and that was christ the christ
[1:57:25] was the chief messenger so he was the
[1:57:28] boss that come down after
[1:57:30] the messengers that's the seven
[1:57:32] messenger boss
[1:57:33] that's the mighty angel that is christ
[1:57:35] oh my
[1:57:36] so what john said he said he must
[1:57:38] increase and i must increase this is
[1:57:40] about right now
[1:57:41] notice john immediately said he must
[1:57:43] increase and i must decrease
[1:57:45] and he presented truth the church to
[1:57:47] christ
[1:57:48] he presented the church to what to
[1:57:50] christ and we are told in last days
[1:57:53] that it will repeat again there's going
[1:57:55] to be a message come forth
[1:57:56] that will introduce the messiah
[1:57:59] to the people not faithful to the people
[1:58:02] no the messiah
[1:58:04] to the people isn't that right and it
[1:58:07] will be in such a way that they will
[1:58:08] stand
[1:58:09] down founded so william branham came
[1:58:11] with the elijah spirit
[1:58:13] to introduce you to christ hallelujah
[1:58:16] so some point in time we have to come
[1:58:18] back to christ because that is the
[1:58:20] prophet's prophecy
[1:58:21] oh glory to god behold the lamb of god
[1:58:24] oh
[1:58:24] thank you jesus hallelujah so what
[1:58:27] he said enoch bill the pyramid symbol
[1:58:30] stands as a symbol
[1:58:31] go into the prophet's chamber watch them
[1:58:33] seven steps where did the guard meet a
[1:58:35] challenge to bring the comma into the
[1:58:36] presence of the king
[1:58:37] at the top of the steps their shows
[1:58:40] we have got to come again with that same
[1:58:43] spirit that was on
[1:58:44] john he introduced the messiah
[1:58:48] he was greater than all the prophets he
[1:58:50] introduced it and we have got to come up
[1:58:52] to a place again
[1:58:54] here we go there's something that will
[1:58:56] introduce the messiah
[1:58:58] and then he dropped this bomb here how
[1:59:00] will they know the messiah
[1:59:02] the people believing him know it unless
[1:59:04] they are constantly
[1:59:06] in the word to know what he is
[1:59:09] so you have to be in the word to know
[1:59:11] who the messiah is what the messiah is
[1:59:13] he's not some man there's a capstone the
[1:59:16] capstone revelation of jesus christ
[1:59:18] capital manifestation of jesus christ
[1:59:20] so he winds up all the loose ends you
[1:59:22] talk about the seven angels
[1:59:23] if we know the book of redemption has
[1:59:25] proved that but will not be understood
[1:59:27] and the mysteries come down from god as
[1:59:28] the word of god and reveal the
[1:59:30] re-revelation of god now notice
[1:59:32] when the seas are broke the mystery
[1:59:34] revealed dunk on the angel
[1:59:35] the messenger christ set in his foot
[1:59:38] upon the land
[1:59:39] upon the sea with a rainbow over his
[1:59:40] head now remember here we go
[1:59:42] here we go the seven inches on earth at
[1:59:44] the time of this coming
[1:59:48] the seven angels on the earth at the
[1:59:50] time of this couple so christ came down
[1:59:54] to the prophet he took the prophet of
[1:59:56] the earth
[1:59:57] alas is already come if you see me go
[2:00:02] he's gone but christ the holy spirit
[2:00:05] the manifestation of the holy spirit is
[2:00:07] that angel on the earth
[2:00:08] fixing things are wrong christ they're
[2:00:10] gone supernatural
[2:00:12] they're gone power going you probably
[2:00:14] say when i am gone healing is not gone
[2:00:16] because he boosted it prove that he's
[2:00:18] the same yesterday then forever
[2:00:20] let me say that again bro when i'm gone
[2:00:22] healing isn't gone
[2:00:23] supernatural has gone who dear oh out
[2:00:26] the power of god what about tongues
[2:00:27] interpreting tongues you're speaking
[2:00:28] dogs are pentecostal who said that
[2:00:30] it's not pentecost our own tongues we
[2:00:31] own that they spot anybody
[2:00:34] it's not pentecostal only sailment and
[2:00:35] prophecy and wisdom we own that that's
[2:00:37] ours that's the bright body
[2:00:39] hallelujah every gift will be back in
[2:00:40] the church oh glory to god hallelujah
[2:00:43] because jesus christ
[2:00:44] is the same and we're going to preach
[2:00:46] that hebrews 13 8
[2:00:47] he has to be the same evil yesterday he
[2:00:49] can't heal yesterday and
[2:00:51] he having problem to heal today
[2:00:52] something wrong with us not him he's the
[2:00:54] same yesterday
[2:00:55] he can't change his behavior he can't
[2:00:56] change his attitude he can't change his
[2:00:58] healing power he catches his delivering
[2:01:00] power he can't change his way making
[2:01:02] power
[2:01:02] he could flip things around 24 hours
[2:01:06] as john was giving his message the same
[2:01:08] time that messiah come in the days john
[2:01:10] knew he would see him
[2:01:11] because he was going to introduce him we
[2:01:13] realized according to malachi 4 there
[2:01:15] has become one with
[2:01:16] elijah to whom the word of the lord can
[2:01:18] come to he is the revealed by the holy
[2:01:20] spirit
[2:01:21] all the mysteries of god and restore the
[2:01:23] faith of the church back to the fate of
[2:01:25] the apostles like the fathers
[2:01:26] oh my hallelujah oh glory to god
[2:01:30] hallelujah
[2:01:30] thank you lord here is the angel on the
[2:01:33] earth
[2:01:34] another angel mighty messenger come down
[2:01:36] and see this angel was the italy angel
[2:01:38] but one come down with a rainbow isn't
[2:01:40] that right so therefore that mighty
[2:01:42] angel knows all the words spoken from
[2:01:44] that prophet
[2:01:45] so he knows the prophet's prophecy so
[2:01:47] hika
[2:01:49] say the angel you know you know what
[2:01:50] prophet could you imagine what you
[2:01:51] trying to explain to the mighty angel
[2:01:52] what do you prophecy
[2:01:55] no think about it now could you imagine
[2:01:58] somebody trying to explain to the mighty
[2:01:59] angel what the prophet said and the
[2:02:01] feeling let them see this and when the
[2:02:02] prophet moves someone goes and moves
[2:02:03] from muslim
[2:02:07] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[2:02:11] russia i'm almost on home stretch here
[2:02:14] now
[2:02:14] russia they're looking for a man who
[2:02:16] conquered space all i'm saying is they
[2:02:17] give a messiah
[2:02:18] what about the church what kind of
[2:02:20] messiah that jesus looking for today
[2:02:23] what kind of messiah the church has
[2:02:25] cried the loudest
[2:02:27] what are we hollering about a messiah
[2:02:29] what are we hollering revival in our
[2:02:31] time
[2:02:32] baptist and back to the other what are
[2:02:33] they looking for what do you want
[2:02:36] question what does the church want
[2:02:39] anyhow we already got it
[2:02:42] god gave it to us it's his promise for
[2:02:45] this hour
[2:02:46] we look in the bible we see it
[2:02:47] everywhere through the bible
[2:02:49] anointed once come on and make the word
[2:02:52] live again
[2:02:55] you know what the anointed word is right
[2:02:58] the anointed word is messiah almost
[2:03:00] finished
[2:03:00] not the one coming would live again
[2:03:02] right in the aura for that hour
[2:03:04] we have got the messiah this is him
[2:03:08] the word in the beginning was the word
[2:03:10] the word was with god
[2:03:12] and the word was god the word remains
[2:03:14] god the same
[2:03:15] yesterday today and forever we know what
[2:03:18] is supposed to take place
[2:03:19] in this day we are wanting a messiah and
[2:03:22] god
[2:03:22] give us the messiah his promised word
[2:03:25] for this day
[2:03:27] i hope the people see that not books and
[2:03:29] tapes they're not the messiah
[2:03:32] the messiah is what is promised he says
[2:03:34] seven thunder is going to gather the
[2:03:35] right together
[2:03:36] that's a promise seven thunderbirds
[2:03:37] should about how to appear that's a
[2:03:38] promise isn't that right
[2:03:40] spread to them seven up to the voices of
[2:03:41] that group that's the promise
[2:03:43] isn't that right there'll be a super
[2:03:44] church or super race that's the promise
[2:03:46] hallelujah when the baptismally goes is
[2:03:48] made manifest outside the nomination
[2:03:50] that's a promise
[2:03:51] all these things are promises hallelujah
[2:03:53] when the power of this church rises
[2:03:54] that's a promise to
[2:03:56] pull that's a promise all these are
[2:03:58] promises that was prophesied
[2:03:59] isn't that right so we award the messiah
[2:04:01] now hear this bomb and god give us the
[2:04:03] messiah his promised buddha did he
[2:04:05] it's just waiting for somebody
[2:04:08] with faith to anoint it and make it live
[2:04:12] again
[2:04:13] yes sir it's the real messiah it's the
[2:04:16] word of god
[2:04:17] oh blessed be the name of the lord do
[2:04:20] you believe that today
[2:04:21] and the only place that could not strike
[2:04:25] is in the word there's only one place
[2:04:27] that spiritual that cannot strike
[2:04:29] that's the word death can't strike the
[2:04:32] word
[2:04:32] because it's the word of the living god
[2:04:35] he said the confirmation of his word
[2:04:37] always when the word is confirmed
[2:04:40] that is god speaking in his word
[2:04:43] look how he plays that he's not talking
[2:04:45] about text he's not talking about
[2:04:47] explanation and revelation
[2:04:48] he says when the confirmation of his
[2:04:52] word
[2:04:53] always when the word is confirmed
[2:04:57] that is god speaking in his word making
[2:05:00] himself
[2:05:01] visible that you can see
[2:05:05] that is god confirming his word
[2:05:09] making himself what say visible
[2:05:13] visible that you can see and the word
[2:05:17] was
[2:05:17] invisible he said now listen close the
[2:05:19] word was invisible
[2:05:20] until it was made flesh and
[2:05:23] then the word becomes visible
[2:05:26] but here more and through his
[2:05:28] sacrificial death at calvary
[2:05:30] and his resurrection he positionally
[2:05:33] places church in that realm
[2:05:35] that the same invisible god
[2:05:38] could come into the individual and make
[2:05:41] the word visible i wish my church could
[2:05:43] get that
[2:05:44] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[2:05:48] the word becoming flesh makes the word
[2:05:51] that was invisible
[2:05:52] visible oh my hallelujah
[2:05:55] thank you lord the greeks said we will
[2:05:58] see jesus
[2:05:59] and then jesus promised to be in his
[2:06:01] church
[2:06:02] doing the same thing that he did then
[2:06:04] until he ate
[2:06:05] him now he said a little while the world
[2:06:08] seeing
[2:06:09] me no more well then how would we see
[2:06:12] him
[2:06:15] question answer by the prophet we will
[2:06:19] have to see his spirit
[2:06:25] not how will we hear him how will we
[2:06:29] see him we have to see his spirit
[2:06:32] if he's in us then that spirit
[2:06:36] would have to do the same thing that he
[2:06:39] did then
[2:06:40] or it wouldn't be the same spirit we're
[2:06:42] not talking about talk
[2:06:44] preaching teaching we're talking about
[2:06:46] the same spirit
[2:06:48] and then he went to say i am the vine
[2:06:50] here the branches
[2:06:51] and if the branch is in the vine the
[2:06:54] branch will bear the same kind of fruit
[2:06:56] the vine produces so we don't have to
[2:06:59] talk to talk and so paul for here and
[2:07:01] how great revelation we have
[2:07:02] we're not mountain and we see a light we
[2:07:04] don't talk don't tell talk
[2:07:05] it will speak for itself
[2:07:09] no boasting no putnam flag i am this and
[2:07:12] i am that and nobody else have it
[2:07:14] honey and whatnot you know
[2:07:17] i'll tell my wife about the amongst the
[2:07:20] false prophets that have
[2:07:22] you have a ton look jesus really say you
[2:07:24] choose to many foreign
[2:07:28] point nine and a half percent of them as
[2:07:30] liars

[2:07:32] a year plentiful and how much
[2:07:34] crusade how many people in stadiums and
[2:07:37] how much this and that
[2:07:38] all them fun to be lies and i get caught
[2:07:40] up in the lord through them
[2:07:41] and the lord showed them that that and
[2:07:43] showed all them things wrong
[2:07:45] lying on god god never spoke to them
[2:07:47] never spoke to the
[2:07:49] lying spirits and their big ministries
[2:07:51] and and thousands of people following
[2:07:53] them still sending money and still
[2:07:55] backing them and what that liars think
[2:07:57] about it now
[2:07:58] lying man if his bible there's a stone
[2:08:02] you know
[2:08:06] it's keep a stone just just heaps just
[2:08:08] heaps all over america all over

[2:08:11] god you can't say dust salon god they
[2:08:13] talk to you
[2:08:16] you don't lie on god that's why children
[2:08:18] comfort
[2:08:19] are not just truth by letter or truth by
[2:08:22] just man speaking
[2:08:23] but vindicated truth he's a desire truth
[2:08:26] from the in one part
[2:08:27] has taken my time and what's on the
[2:08:29] inside is connected to what on the
[2:08:30] outside
[2:08:31] is a harmony that is there oh glory to
[2:08:33] god that way you can say this is my son
[2:08:35] i'm pleased
[2:08:36] let me finish here oh glory to god he
[2:08:39] said if that
[2:08:40] he said watch that first vine branch
[2:08:43] come out of the vine was a pentecostal
[2:08:46] branch
[2:08:47] watch with visions powers
[2:08:50] healings but in the holy spirit great
[2:08:53] signs and wonders the next branch would
[2:08:55] have to be the same kind of branch
[2:08:57] oh glory to god hallelujah i know
[2:08:59] someone long dressed and brothers were
[2:09:00] entire
[2:09:01] and and sisters they point no grease in
[2:09:03] their hair and all kind of
[2:09:04] flimsy kind of things we're not talking
[2:09:06] about that and the message
[2:09:08] you know i mean you're looking messages
[2:09:10] they're not looking messages this is
[2:09:11] this is your
[2:09:12] reproduction of the original green
[2:09:14] goddess in a prophet
[2:09:15] doesn't look like weenie message he sent
[2:09:17] a perfect turn on us back to the face of
[2:09:18] the fathers
[2:09:19] the same thing that those guys had
[2:09:21] because only because it wasn't the time
[2:09:22] yet they didn't go into adoption they're
[2:09:24] going to the rapture
[2:09:25] they fell into the ground but we have a
[2:09:26] promise of going to that rapture
[2:09:28] oh glory to god musician come on please
[2:09:30] hallelujah
[2:09:32] glory to god thank you lord jesus
[2:09:35] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[2:09:38] thank you jesus thank you jesus blessed
[2:09:40] be the name of the lord
[2:09:42] so before elisha could get that double
[2:09:45] portion
[2:09:46] elijah made a statement if you see me go
[2:09:48] you
[2:09:49] have to know i am gone you have to know
[2:09:52] no man coming back after between me and
[2:09:55] no no money coming
[2:09:57] the prophet gone there's no prophet
[2:09:59] there's no promise of a man coming
[2:10:01] there's no prophet on behalf there's no
[2:10:03] malachi 4 and a half
[2:10:04] there's no behold like elijah and
[2:10:07] somebody else i don't have that
[2:10:09] god was very specific behold i said
[2:10:11] elijah the prophet
[2:10:12] he shall turn the hearts of the children
[2:10:14] back to the fate of the fathers
[2:10:16] and if he already come and mean his job
[2:10:17] is finished
[2:10:19] it is over if it comes to elohim
[2:10:23] that came down to abraham type in the
[2:10:25] bride he said i will return as a d
[2:10:27] according to the time of life
[2:10:29] and when that promise was given a man
[2:10:31] wasn't coming in between
[2:10:33] it was the power of god one more jesus
[2:10:36] when he was taken up from them
[2:10:37] they were him by by they saw him taken
[2:10:40] up and they returned to jerusalem

[2:12:44] righteousness oh glory to god so when
[2:12:47] jesus was taken
[2:12:48] up those disciples knew that jesus came
[2:12:50] back oh god he had to come back no he
[2:12:51] wasn't talking about they saw him go
[2:12:53] they went in the upper room they were
[2:12:54] waiting for their promise they know god
[2:12:56] they promised me the holy ghost he
[2:12:58] promised me to deliver my wife did i
[2:12:59] promise deliver my family he promised to
[2:13:01] heal me
[2:13:02] you promised to be a healer and be
[2:13:03] living in last days and i am resting on
[2:13:05] your promise
[2:13:06] oh glory to god oh my
[2:13:09] i'm gonna close wow the believers is
[2:13:13] commanded by the author
[2:13:15] to read and believe every word of it not
[2:13:18] just part of it
[2:13:19] one word to disbelieve it might as well
[2:13:21] quit trying until you believe the word
[2:13:23] every word is absolutely a part of
[2:13:26] almighty god
[2:13:27] is that right it's the complete body
[2:13:30] of jesus christ and in christ being male
[2:13:33] the groom
[2:13:35] the bride is represented in him also and
[2:13:36] these two are one
[2:13:38] and the true believers it is in this
[2:13:40] word who accept it
[2:13:42] and believe it and here we go
[2:13:46] with patience wait
[2:13:49] for its prophesied promises
[2:13:52] wait with what with patience
[2:13:56] every one of them to be manifested in
[2:13:58] this age
[2:13:59] every believer has watched it everybody
[2:14:01] have been on toes
[2:14:02] watching is the one that has been
[2:14:03] revealed to here we go
[2:14:05] and this is not extract from uh revision
[2:14:07] 310 because otherwise kept the word of
[2:14:09] my patience
[2:14:10] i will also keep these from the all
[2:14:11] temptation we shall come upon all the
[2:14:13] world to try them to dwell upon the
[2:14:15] earth
[2:14:16] what does he mean by the word of my
[2:14:18] patience
[2:14:19] hebrews 6 13 says for when god made
[2:14:21] promise to abraham
[2:14:23] because he could swear by no greater he
[2:14:25] way by himself saying surely he had
[2:14:26] blessed him blessed
[2:14:27] so after you're patiently endured he
[2:14:30] obtained the promise
[2:14:31] you see the spirit is speaking about the
[2:14:34] word of god which is given to us
[2:14:36] to wait for the fulfillment of that
[2:14:40] word required patience even as it did
[2:14:44] in the case of abraham he endured i seen
[2:14:46] him who was invisible
[2:14:48] he was patient and then the word was
[2:14:50] finally fulfilled
[2:14:52] this is the way god teaches his people
[2:14:55] patience
[2:14:56] why if he fulfill his word in physical
[2:14:58] manifestations
[2:14:59] the very instant you prayed you would
[2:15:02] never learn patience
[2:15:03] but would come more and more impatient
[2:15:05] with life
[2:15:06] let me show you how this is the truth
[2:15:08] hebrews 11 17 by faith abraham
[2:15:10] when he was tried offered up isaac that
[2:15:12] he might have received the promises
[2:15:14] offered up his only begotten son there
[2:15:17] it is
[2:15:18] abraham was tried after
[2:15:22] he received the word of promise most
[2:15:25] think that as soon as they pray in jesus
[2:15:27] name over the good promises of god
[2:15:29] that there should be not be a trial but
[2:15:32] here it says that
[2:15:33] abraham was tried after he received the
[2:15:37] promise
[2:15:37] that is exactly correct according to the
[2:15:40] psalmist
[2:15:41] 105 psalms 105 19 until the time his
[2:15:43] word came
[2:15:44] talk about joseph the word of the lord
[2:15:46] tried him god give us
[2:15:48] exceeding great and precious promises
[2:15:51] he has promised to fulfill them he will
[2:15:54] but from the time we pray until the time
[2:15:56] we get the answer
[2:15:58] we must learn to receive patience into
[2:16:00] our souls
[2:16:01] for only in patience do we possess life
[2:16:04] may god help us to learn this lesson
[2:16:06] even as we know the people of these six
[2:16:08] aged learned patients we read the
[2:16:10] history
[2:16:10] of the lives of these great christians
[2:16:12] what a contrast we see
[2:16:13] between their lives and ours for they
[2:16:15] were so patient and quiet
[2:16:17] and today we all but overcome our over
[2:16:20] impatience and haste
[2:16:21] but as an every age people let men put
[2:16:24] their own interpretation to the word
[2:16:26] and cause them to be blinded to the
[2:16:28] event that happened
[2:16:29] the mission god confirmed his prophesied
[2:16:32] word
[2:16:33] then it's the believers watch the
[2:16:35] believers watch for the fulfillment
[2:16:37] of what the prophet said and that is the
[2:16:40] identification
[2:16:41] that they are god's prophets oh my the
[2:16:44] people are watching
[2:16:45] for some little outlet some bypass some
[2:16:48] shortcut but there are no shortcuts in
[2:16:50] the word of god
[2:16:51] there's one pattern and you must cut
[2:16:53] yourself to fit that pattern
[2:16:54] let's try to cut the pattern to fit you
[2:16:56] everybody must do that that's the only
[2:16:58] way
[2:16:58] the believers wait for the word to be
[2:17:02] confirmed
[2:17:03] so john prophecy was vindicated in god's
[2:17:06] order
[2:17:07] the word of the lord comes to the
[2:17:08] prophet jesus was the word
[2:17:10] john was prophesying of the coming of
[2:17:13] the word for fulfillment
[2:17:15] and jesus the word came to the water and
[2:17:17] watch when a man stands
[2:17:19] for what is truth then god is obligated
[2:17:22] to vindicate that man the truth oh my
[2:17:26] hallelujah oh glory to god final quote
[2:17:28] to begin to play something
[2:17:30] if he has called you for this there is
[2:17:34] nothing that can keep it from happening
[2:17:37] there is not enough devils in torment
[2:17:39] but what god's word will make manifest
[2:17:41] you are born for purpose
[2:17:43] and nobody can take your place you might
[2:17:46] have impersonators
[2:17:47] and everything else but they will never
[2:17:49] take your place
[2:17:50] god will triumph it cannot fail there is
[2:17:53] where every christian ought to stand
[2:17:55] knowing
[2:17:56] that trials will come and seem every way
[2:17:59] to you
[2:17:59] but remember god is a purpose but it
[2:18:02] will work
[2:18:03] right let's all stand hallelujah
[2:18:12] a little thank you lord jesus
