[20:17] this morning. We welcome your august

[20:29] dwell in this place this morning
[20:32] is our prayer. Jesus, are you happy to
[20:35] be in the house of the Lord? Amen.
[20:39] Praise God. It's good to be in his
[20:42] presence. Amen. We just want to read
[20:44] quickly from Psalms chapter 150. You
[20:47] don't have to find it. Psalms 150 says,
[20:49] "Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his
[20:52] sanctuary.
[20:54] Praise him in the firmament of his
[20:56] power. Praise him for his mighty acts.
[21:00] Praise him according to his excellent
[21:02] greatness.
[21:03] Praise him with the sound of the
[21:05] trumpet. Praise him with sulttery and
[21:07] hum. Praise him with the timber and
[21:10] dance. Praise him with stringed
[21:12] instruments and organs. Praise him upon
[21:15] the loud symbols. Praise him upon the
[21:18] high sounding symbols. Let everything
[21:21] that had breath praise the Lord. Praise
[21:26] ye the Lord. Amen. And amen.
[21:30] That is what we believe this morning.
[21:32] That we were created to praise ye the
[21:34] Lord. Amen. Let's let us bow our heads.
[21:38] Almighty God, it feels so good to be
[21:42] alive this morning.
[21:44] So many did not wake up this morning,
[21:46] but your spirit woke us up. Your
[21:51] presence woke us up. The breath that you
[21:53] put in our lungs this morning is what
[21:56] woke us up, Lord. Not the work of man,
[21:59] but the work of the Holy Spirit in our
[22:02] lives. And we thank you this morning for
[22:03] your your providence, Lord. We thank you
[22:05] for your your presence and your love
[22:08] that you have expressed to us this
[22:10] morning. We are grateful for it.
[22:13] We are thankful for it, Lord. this
[22:15] opportunity to come into your house to
[22:19] acknowledge you as God and creator
[22:21] overall. We pray that you will have
[22:23] leadership this morning. Take guidance
[22:25] this morning. Bless us as we uh uh get
[22:29] into the spirit of God. We pray you
[22:31] bless your people, Lord, here in
[22:33] different places, Lord, that's
[22:35] worshiping as well this morning. Father,
[22:37] we pray your presence just be with your
[22:39] bride this morning around the nation,
[22:40] around the world. Oh God, on this Sunday
[22:42] morning, Lord, as we be careful to give
[22:44] you all the praise, honor, and glory,
[22:46] bless the word as it would come forth
[22:48] this morning. Bless your speaker as he
[22:50] would yield himself to the moving of the
[22:53] spirit. Lord, may something be said this
[22:56] morning that would ignite a flame in our
[22:59] hearts, Lord, that would create a
[23:02] revival, that would produce a revival in
[23:05] this last day. This is what we are
[23:07] looking for this morning. Help us truly
[23:11] as we wait on you this morning in Jesus
[23:12] Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Do you
[23:16] love him today? Why don't you turn

[48:34] Oh my. You know, I love these old songs.
[48:38] There's a song here that goes, "My hope
[48:40] is built on nothing less
[48:45] than Jesus blood and rightuousness.
[48:53] I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
[48:59] but holy lean on Jesus name.
[49:07] On Christ the solid
[49:10] rock I stand. All of the ground is
[49:16] sinking sand.
[49:19] All of the ground is sinking sand.
[49:28] When darkness seems
[49:31] to hide his face,
[49:34] I rest on his unchanging
[49:39] grace.
[49:41] In every silent
[49:44] stormy gale,
[49:46] my anchor holds within the bear.
[49:54] Oh, on Christ the solid
[49:58] rock I stand. All of the ground is
[50:04] sinking sand.
[50:07] All of the ground is sinking sand.
[50:14] One more time. Oh, on Christ the sun
[50:19] rock I stand.
[50:22] All
[50:24] ground is sinking sand.

[50:47] Oh, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory.
[50:50] Oh, hallelujah.
[50:53] Oh,
[50:56] on Christ the song. Let's all stand.
[51:01] All the ground
[51:05] is sinking sand.
[51:08] All the ground is sinking sand.
[51:18] You are alpha
[51:21] [Music]
[51:22] and omega.
[51:26] [Music]
[51:27] We worship you our Lord.
[51:33] You are worthy to be praised.
[51:40] Let's praise him. Oh, you are ala
[51:47] and omega.
[51:50] [Music]
[51:53] We worship
[51:56] you alone.
[51:59] You are worthy
[52:03] to be praised.
[52:06] We give you all. We give you all
[52:14] the
[52:16] glory.
[52:20] We worship
[52:23] you our Lord for you are worthy
[52:30] to be praised. One more time, lift your
[52:34] hand and close your eyes and say, "We
[52:36] give you all.
[52:41] [Music]
[52:48] We worship you alone.
[52:54] You are worthy
[52:57] to be praised. Let's just worship the
[53:01] Lord this morning. Father, we praise you
[53:03] and bless you. Thank you for your
[53:05] presence this morning. Thank you for
[53:07] your spirit, Father. Thank you for the
[53:09] anointing that bring you may come in a
[53:12] special way and speak to your hearts
[53:14] this morning. Take me out of the way and
[53:16] be glorified and love it. In Jesus name
[53:18] we ask it. Amen. And amen. God bless you
[53:22] and welcome this morning. If you have
[53:24] your Bibles, I'd like you to turn to
[53:26] Galatians chapter 4. We want to read
[53:28] from verse 1 to6 and Titus chapter 1. We
[53:33] want to read verse 5 to 11.
[53:38] Reading Galatians chapter 4.
[53:41] Now I say that the heir as long as he's
[53:44] a child different nothing from a
[53:46] servant, though he be lord of all, but
[53:49] is under tutors and governors until the
[53:52] time appointed of the father. Even so we
[53:56] when we were children were in bondage
[53:58] under the elements of the world. But
[54:01] when the fullness of the time was come,
[54:04] God sent forth his son made of a woman
[54:07] made under the law to redeem them that
[54:10] were under the law that we might receive
[54:14] the adoption of sons. And because ye are
[54:17] sons, God has sent forth the spirit of
[54:20] his son into your hearts crying above
[54:24] father. And reading from Titus
[54:28] chapter one, reading from verse five,
[54:33] Paul speaks. For this cause left ID in
[54:36] cree, that thou should set in order the
[54:40] things that are wanting, and ordain
[54:43] elders in every city, as I have
[54:46] appointed thee. If any, be blameless,
[54:50] the husband of one wife, having faithful
[54:53] children, not accused of riot or unruly.
[54:58] For a bishop must be blameless as the
[55:01] steward of God, not self-willed,
[55:04] not soon angry, not given to whine, no
[55:08] striker, nor given to filthy Luca, but a
[55:12] lover of hospitality,
[55:14] a lover of good men, sober, just, holy,
[55:19] temporate, holding fast the faithful
[55:21] word as he had been taught, that he may
[55:25] be able by sound doctrine
[55:28] both to exhort and to convince the
[55:31] gainers.
[55:33] For there are many unruly and vain
[55:35] talkers and deceivers, especially the
[55:39] day of the circumcision, whose mouths
[55:42] must be stopped, who subvert whole
[55:46] houses teaching things which they ought
[55:49] not for filthy Lucas sake. Let's pray.
[55:52] Father, we thank you for your word.
[55:54] Interpret it our hearts. But I know this
[55:56] is a special service and I pray that
[55:58] your anointing will come down and teach
[56:00] us and speak to us in Jesus name I ask
[56:01] it. Amen and amen. You may be seated.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Give the Lord some praises
[56:06] as you have your seat.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; So this has been upon me for a while
[56:16] now. This particular message
[56:20] and the title I have here is under
[56:22] tutors and governors until.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Under tutors and governors until
[56:29] &gt;&gt; I have a subject. Every ear
[56:33] must pass through tutors and governors.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; That's a subject. Every ear must pass
[56:42] through tutors and governors and have an
[56:44] inspiration.
[56:46] And that's from Titus. setting in order
[56:48] the things that are wanting
[56:50] &gt;&gt; or to set right what was defective or
[56:54] finish what was left undone
[56:57] &gt;&gt; so we see what the Lord will take us to
[56:59] this morning this is a very is a
[57:02] teaching and um I think that um is a
[57:04] very very important message
[57:06] &gt;&gt; brother Brian
[57:08] the word nicolatan comes from two Greek
[57:10] words niko which is to conquer leos
[57:13] which means the lady in fact somebody
[57:16] was doing something in that early church
[57:18] that was conquering the lady. If the
[57:22] lady is being conquered, there must have
[57:24] been some authority there doing it. What
[57:27] was in that God hated that was happening
[57:30] to the church. What was going on then
[57:33] and is now going on today is exactly
[57:37] what the word nicolatan means. the
[57:39] people was being subjected somehow in a
[57:44] way that was absolutely contrary to the
[57:47] word of God.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Now to get the real meaning of what we
[57:50] are to go into, I must caution you to
[57:52] ever keep in mind that rel religious
[57:55] matters if you like is composed of two
[57:57] parts
[57:59] that entwine
[58:02] but are opposite as black and white.
[58:06] Religion and the spiritual world are
[58:08] made up of these two trees which had
[58:11] their roots in Eden. Both the tree of
[58:13] life and the tree of knowledge of good
[58:15] and evil stood in the midst of the
[58:17] garden and no doubt their branches in
[58:20] inter intertwine each other.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Thus in the Ephesians church is the same
[58:26] paradox. The church is made up of good
[58:29] and bad.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; A lot of people don't understand this. A
[58:33] lot of people figure the church only
[58:34] have good people in it
[58:36] &gt;&gt; and their church is the only good one or
[58:37] the bride one and whatn not which is the
[58:39] foolishness. The church here we go is
[58:42] made up of good and bad.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; The two vines make the church.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; They are like the wheat and tears
[58:49] growing side by side.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; One is the true, the other is the false.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Now God will speak to each one
[58:57] &gt;&gt; and he will talk about each one. He will
[59:00] call them the church. But only the elect
[59:03] will really know which is the true
[59:04] spirit.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Only the elect will not be deceived.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Scripture Matthew 24:24, they shall rise
[59:11] false Christ, false prophets, and shall
[59:13] shows great signs and wonders in so much
[59:16] if it was possible, they shall deceive
[59:18] the very elect.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; So way back in the early church, the
[59:22] false vine got to inter intertwine
[59:25] itself around the true vine. And we find
[59:28] these deeds of the nicolatans. Yeah. And
[59:31] that spirit is going to be found
[59:33] fighting the true vine
[59:35] &gt;&gt; until it is destroyed by God.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; You don't ever find the true fighting
[59:39] the false.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; You always find the false fighting the
[59:42] true.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; It's a one-way thing going on here now.
[59:44] Because the devil want to out your light
[59:47] &gt;&gt; because God give you a light.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; God put something inside of you.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; You may not be conscious of it. You may
[59:53] not be aware of it. It has not been
[59:55] revealed to you, but it's still there.
[59:56] doesn't change what inside of you. What
[59:58] God put inside of you, it doesn't change
[1:00:00] whatsoever.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[1:00:03] What was the spiritual climate of that
[1:00:06] church? It had left it first love.
[1:00:09] Remember the rebuke, return to your
[1:00:10] first love.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; It has left its first love. And the word
[1:00:14] of God revealed to us as having fallen
[1:00:16] from the original which was Pentecost.
[1:00:20] In plain English, that means this church
[1:00:23] was in danger of being taken away from
[1:00:27] the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; and the control of the Holy Spirit.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; This is exactly what took place after
[1:00:34] Moses led Israel out of Egypt. The way
[1:00:36] of God was to lead him by the cloud of
[1:00:38] fire, prophetic utterance, miracles and
[1:00:41] signs, and God-given wonders.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was the way the church
[1:00:45] was supposed to leave. When the pillar
[1:00:47] of fire moved, everybody get up and
[1:00:49] move. When the cloud move, everybody get
[1:00:51] up and move. Nobody here at camping
[1:00:53] because they want to camp. They moving
[1:00:55] with the cloud. They're moving with the
[1:00:57] fire. They're moving with the anointing.
[1:00:58] They're moving with the prophetic
[1:01:00] utterance.
[1:01:01] [Applause]
[1:01:01] [Music]
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; That is how the church, remember, they
[1:01:07] were the people of God until they were
[1:01:08] called out. And when they got called
[1:01:10] out, become the church of God.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; So, what's something? This was to be
[1:01:16] accomplished by God selected,
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; God ordained,
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; God equipped and God sent men
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; with the whole camp being dominated by a
[1:01:29] Holy Ghost move.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; That is how God wanted it. That was
[1:01:35] God's desire that the whole camp be
[1:01:38] dominated by the Holy Ghost move.
[1:01:41] They rebelled
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; and wanted a set of rules and quits to
[1:01:45] go by.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Then they wanted a king
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; and brother Isaac had a profile of the
[1:01:51] rise and fall of Saul.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; And it's an important teaching. You
[1:01:54] should go and listen back to it. How
[1:01:56] this young nice man, that's a man you
[1:01:58] would like to for to marry your
[1:01:59] daughter,
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; goodly man,
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; humble man.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good family, good breeding.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Start off good. Amen.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; End up off key because he have a issue
[1:02:12] with obedience.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; And through Saul's experience is where
[1:02:17] those notable words came out to obey is
[1:02:20] better than sacrifice.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. When God
[1:02:25] given instructions is for you to obey,
[1:02:27] not to question, not to wonder, no, obey
[1:02:30] what God have said.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; And God will speak to you this morning
[1:02:35] by the word.
[1:02:40] All right.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; So they wanted to be exactly like the
[1:02:45] world
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; and went into complete apostasy and
[1:02:48] oblivion. That is exactly how the first
[1:02:51] church age started.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; It will get worse and worse until the
[1:02:56] Holy Spirit is completely rejected
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; and God must destroy the people.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; How it started in the early church? It
[1:03:02] was called deeds. Yes.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Then it become a doctrine,
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; a deed of the nickelian.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Then it become the doctrine of the
[1:03:09] nickel. And here this part. Then it
[1:03:11] become a standard.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; It become an unbending way.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; This is how we see it in the message.
[1:03:18] The message standard unbended way. It
[1:03:22] finally took over and God was pushed
[1:03:25] aside.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Now listen when you I keep your ears up
[1:03:29] now.
[1:03:30] It started so small,
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; so quietly, so inoffensively. It looked
[1:03:35] so good. It seemed so strong. Then it
[1:03:39] caught a hole like a python and it
[1:03:41] squeeze out the very breath and kill all
[1:03:44] the spirituality there was in the
[1:03:46] church.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; That false vine is subtle.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; It's like an angel of light
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; until it gets a hold of you.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; I want to say that I believe in
[1:03:56] leadership. Listen to these words now.
[1:03:58] But it is not the leadership of men I
[1:04:02] believe in.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; I believe in the leadership of the Holy
[1:04:05] Ghost
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; coming through the word.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; I believe also that God has set men in
[1:04:14] the church, men who are gifted by the
[1:04:16] spirit
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; and they will keep the church in order.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; I believe that also that the church is
[1:04:23] ruled over by men that God sends to take
[1:04:26] charge.
[1:04:28] But is a but with it.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; But
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; that rule is by the word.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; So it's not the man in charge, it's the
[1:04:39] word in charge.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; So if you're being taught and fed the
[1:04:43] word, you know that is God coming to you
[1:04:45] in the form of the word.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; The man is only a channel,
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; a vessel
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; being used to get this word to you.
[1:04:57] So it's not about the man, it's about
[1:04:59] the word coming through the man.
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; I believe also that the church is ruled
[1:05:07] over by men that God sends to take
[1:05:10] charge. But that rule is by the word so
[1:05:13] that it is not men really ruling but the
[1:05:18] spirit of God.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; For the word and spirit are one.
[1:05:23] Hebrews 13:7 says, "Remember them that
[1:05:26] have rule over you,
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; who have spoken unto you the word of God
[1:05:31] whose faith follow
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; considering the end of their
[1:05:35] conversation."
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; And that word conversation knows life
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; amplified. Observe attentively and
[1:05:42] consider their manner of living the
[1:05:44] outcome of well spent lives and imitate
[1:05:47] their fate.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; That's what that word is about. Yes.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Now we see what's happening back there.
[1:05:53] That false vine was getting a hold and
[1:05:58] it was teaching that rulership by man
[1:06:01] was right. It taught that the church had
[1:06:05] to be governed.
[1:06:08] It taught a control over the people.
[1:06:13] But instead of doing it God's way, they
[1:06:16] simply took authority and vested all the
[1:06:20] spiritual powers in their own hands
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; and came out with a holy priesthood
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; standing between God and the people.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; So that is why you have ministers have
[1:06:30] hold the keys to your life which is
[1:06:32] foolishness like them is some T key or
[1:06:34] something. So
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; them have the key and unless you you
[1:06:36] come through them you wouldn't get the
[1:06:37] key.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Is that right? That is that what Jesus
[1:06:40] told Peter? He said, "Upon this rock,
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; what was just revealed to him, I will
[1:06:46] build my church." That mean you could be
[1:06:48] backs in 50 years. You walk in here this
[1:06:51] morning and God could give you a
[1:06:52] revelation.
[1:06:56] [Applause]
[1:06:56] [Music]
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; That is God speaking to you. God dealing
[1:07:01] with you. God revealing himself to you.
[1:07:03] God freeing you.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; That is God.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] [Music]
[1:07:10] And the beauty about that, he doesn't
[1:07:12] have to ask anybody permission to bless
[1:07:14] you,
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; to deliver you, to heal you,
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; to free you, to revive you. He doesn't
[1:07:19] have to ask anybody permission to do
[1:07:20] that. You could be delivered this
[1:07:22] morning.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Your mind battle, your fears, whatever
[1:07:25] you're going through, God could break
[1:07:26] that off of you this morning. Glory to
[1:07:29] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:07:32] Jesus never asked anybody how long in
[1:07:34] that condition. Praise God. He never
[1:07:36] asked anybody how long you're sow, how
[1:07:38] long you're blind, how long you're
[1:07:40] crippled. He said, "Loose them and let
[1:07:42] them go." Give the Lord some praises.
[1:07:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said, "Pick
[1:07:46] up your bed and walk." He not asking how
[1:07:48] long you're in that bed. You're not
[1:07:49] asking how long you up. You're
[1:07:51] not asking how long you b you want to go
[1:07:53] free this morning. You could go free
[1:07:55] this morning.
[1:07:57] [Applause]
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:00] Hallelujah.
[1:08:02] [Music]
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Imagine this what Abraham saying they
[1:08:05] went back to the old ironic system.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; They became antichrist for the dispose
[1:08:12] of his leadership and imposed their own
[1:08:15] and God hated that.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Anytime the man come between God and the
[1:08:19] people, God hates that.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; The Ephesians hated that. And any true
[1:08:26] believer will hate it too.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; We would find we have to be stone blind
[1:08:32] to see that the same thing to at work at
[1:08:34] through the ages and right now is the
[1:08:36] worst of all. What was it? Organization
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; that separated the people cause God's
[1:08:43] people are supposed to be one.
[1:08:47] But the ministers, the pastors, the
[1:08:49] bishop, the so-called
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; niko
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; separating the churches
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; by their teachings and doctrines that
[1:08:57] they right and this one wrong, this one
[1:08:58] wrong, this one wrong, this one wrong.
[1:08:59] And when they talk about this one wrong,
[1:09:00] this one, this wrong. What they really
[1:09:02] telling people without saying it, I
[1:09:03] right? You know, every wrong
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; and the people afterwards their brain
[1:09:08] get washed, that we get brainwashed.
[1:09:10] When their brain get washed with that
[1:09:12] enough, they actually begin to believe
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; that what they're receiving and hearing
[1:09:17] is right.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; In other words, they are deceived
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; by what they believe
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; because you're supposed to believe the
[1:09:24] word
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; what God said.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Why do you say about because the prophet
[1:09:30] said the spirit and the prophet
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; and the bride will say the same thing
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; and what they say will be already said
[1:09:38] in the word.
[1:09:39] [Applause]
[1:09:41] So you not hearing any new thing this
[1:09:43] morning. I'm not bringing a new
[1:09:44] revelation like you never hear before.
[1:09:46] This is the same thing to put you in
[1:09:48] remembrance of these things that you may
[1:09:50] know what you're fighting against, what
[1:09:52] you're battling against.
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Hear this.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; God's people
[1:10:04] are supposed to be one.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. By one spirit are they all baptized
[1:10:08] into one body.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Not join church.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Baptized into the body.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; We preach on that the other day. Play
[1:10:14] body.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Baptiz.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; All right. Now watch this part.
[1:10:24] But by one spirit they all baptized into
[1:10:26] one body. And everyone shout out
[1:10:29] everyone.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Everyone
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; is to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:33] Amen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; There's not a pastor thing.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; There's not a elder thing. There's not a
[1:10:40] deacon thing and usher thing.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Everyone.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Shout out everyone again.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Everyone
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; is to be moved upon
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:51] [Applause]
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; And everyone
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; is to participate
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; in the worship of God.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:02] Hallelujah.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; I'm a elder. I can't praise God.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; I'm a pastor. I can't worship.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; I higher than that. Is that right? I
[1:11:13] ain't seen that in the word, you know.
[1:11:14] Because when the lamb took the book, the
[1:11:17] elders showed down the crown. They said
[1:11:19] about worthy is the lamb. Blessing and
[1:11:21] honor, might and power, dominion. And
[1:11:24] when John saw his name, he had a shout.
[1:11:28] [Applause]
[1:11:32] When you see your name, I don't time to
[1:11:33] fix your hair or or fix your tie. It's
[1:11:37] time to give God praises.
[1:11:39] [Applause]
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Everyone is to be moved upon by the Holy
[1:11:46] Ghost. Everyone is to participate in
[1:11:48] worship of God. But men wanted the
[1:11:51] preeminence.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; So they took over control.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; And bishops become archbishops.
[1:11:58] But the bishop a short title put an arch
[1:12:00] on top of that.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; With opposing titles, they bypassed the
[1:12:06] word of God
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; and taught their own doctrines.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; So now all them is own prophets. They
[1:12:12] bringing their own revelation.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; One time I hear pastor say pick up a
[1:12:17] pack of cigarette and preach thinking
[1:12:18] man filter. So he could pick up
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; a chewing gum.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; He could pick up eating and preach on
[1:12:25] it.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. They're the own prophets.
[1:12:29] Watch. They got the people to obey them
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; until the time came that their way of
[1:12:38] worship did not in any way at all
[1:12:41] resemble the early days after Pentecost.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; These deeds were beginning of the
[1:12:48] apostolic succession. From apostolic
[1:12:51] succession, it was one easy step to
[1:12:53] church membership
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; as a means of saving grace.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; The word was reduced to a creed.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; The antichrist spirit by his spirit was
[1:13:05] predominating the church.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Now, this is Bible preaching. This is
[1:13:10] Bible teaching that people with jacket
[1:13:11] and tire, but it's devil behind there.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Lucifer behind there to wreck the
[1:13:16] church. The church not supposed to be
[1:13:18] cold and formal and dead. The church
[1:13:20] should be a channel of power. When
[1:13:22] devils come and devils tremble because
[1:13:25] of what the church supposed to be, how
[1:13:28] the church supposed to be and the
[1:13:30] atmosphere the church supposed to be in.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; That is why we have to fight. I am in
[1:13:39] the message.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; I'm a believer. Believer of what? The
[1:13:44] devil believe too. Which one are you?
[1:13:48] You have to fight for more than that.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; All this is a backdrop you know to where
[1:13:52] we going you know
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; because you have to begin to see if a
[1:13:55] son then an heir.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; If you are son you have property.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; If you are a son you have inheritance.
[1:14:04] [Applause]
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; If you're a church member you don't have
[1:14:10] to kill. But if you are son you are heir
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; because your father is the boss. Your
[1:14:16] father is in charge. Your father is the
[1:14:18] king. Your father have a kingdom. Oh,
[1:14:21] give the Lord a shout. Your father have
[1:14:24] the power.
[1:14:25] [Applause]
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:28] [Applause]
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; But
[1:14:42] nic means to conquer Leo the lady. Now,
[1:14:45] why is this such a terrible thing? It is
[1:14:48] terrible because God has never placed
[1:14:51] his church in the hands of an elected
[1:14:54] leadership which moves with political
[1:14:58] mindedness.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; So, what he's saying, these men become
[1:15:04] church politicians,
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; parliamentarians, that where they're
[1:15:07] supposed to be
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; in government.
[1:15:13] He has placed his church
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; in the care of god orained
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; spiritfilled
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; word living men.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Listen who lead the people through
[1:15:25] feeding them the word.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; So you can't come expecting what I
[1:15:36] dreamed last night.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; That can help you. You can't come and
[1:15:40] get I expect some revelation I have
[1:15:42] about Ukraine and Russia and and and and
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Mr. Harif.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; So the prophet carefully place these
[1:15:58] things. God ordained.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; That mean he's not there by accident.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; It mean the people are finding tall
[1:16:08] looking this. Aha. Let's get in there.
[1:16:10] No. God ordained,
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; spiritfilled,
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; word living,
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; who lead the people through feeding them
[1:16:19] the word,
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; not feeding them the man's ideas. Well,
[1:16:22] a feeling and a feel what what you're
[1:16:24] feeling hand on the field is what God
[1:16:26] said.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; If ea told that devil what God said and
[1:16:31] stayed there, the devil is on a chance,
[1:16:33] you know.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; But the devil come and say, "God knows.
[1:16:38] God knows
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; that if you eat this tree, you'll be
[1:16:41] wise to be just like God. That was the
[1:16:44] attraction.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; That was the motivation to get more
[1:16:47] knowledge, to get more wisdom, to get
[1:16:49] more understanding. And the Bible speaks
[1:16:51] in the last days there will be people
[1:16:52] with itching ears,
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; for new revelation,
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; for more revelation, because the vision
[1:16:59] is true, but the time was long. Oh, give
[1:17:02] the Lord a shout. This prophetic vision
[1:17:05] released by Malachi 4 is true. But the
[1:17:07] time was long. So people get weary and
[1:17:09] tired of hearing the same old promises.
[1:17:12] But Peter said by these promises we
[1:17:15] become partakers of his divine nature.
[1:17:17] Oh the Lord a shout in the house. Oh
[1:17:20] glory to God.
[1:17:22] My God. My God. My God. Hallelujah.
[1:17:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:29] Hallelujah. I feel the anointing in this
[1:17:32] place. The vision is true, but the time
[1:17:34] is long. Look how long brother Brandham
[1:17:37] said. When they take the pope out of
[1:17:39] America and put it in the Vatican, it
[1:17:41] has come to pass. Or give the Lord a
[1:17:44] shout. The vision is true.
[1:17:49] The vision is true.
[1:17:54] [Music]
[1:17:55] [Applause]
[1:17:59] He had a vision. He said the bride had
[1:18:01] no revival yet. It will take them seven
[1:18:04] tenders to wake up the bride. He will
[1:18:06] send it. He promise it. He will send it.
[1:18:10] He promise it. The vision is true. The
[1:18:12] time might be long, but the vision is
[1:18:14] true. He promise it. He will send it.
[1:18:18] [Music]
[1:18:19] [Applause]
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:28] [Music]
[1:18:33] [Applause]
[1:18:41] Let's go.
[1:18:46] [Music]
[1:18:47] Over
[1:18:49] [Music]
[1:18:51] [Applause]
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:18:58] the years,
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; we have encountered message people
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; who donkey ears in churches 10 years,
[1:19:04] 15, 20 years.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; And when they start to speak certain
[1:19:06] things, they're clueless.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; You want to know what on earth they
[1:19:09] hearing?
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; What on earth they being taught?
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; They're being taught. Yes.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; They're being preached through every
[1:19:14] Sunday, every Wednesday or Thursday,
[1:19:15] wherever. But not the message,
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; not the promise. All kind of cuckoo
[1:19:19] thing.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; This may sound like a joke, but not a
[1:19:28] joke. This a serious thing.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; A brother give a testimony of the pastor
[1:19:32] say when he watch his father foot,
[1:19:35] he recognized his father too and his two
[1:19:39] is the same to
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; adoption time.
[1:19:46] I would be so embarrassed to even speak
[1:19:48] that.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine that?
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; You watch your father turn look at your
[1:19:53] toes. I trust on my father
[1:19:56] that there's a message.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; We read the scripture. The son
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; even though he's a son,
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; even though he's a heir,
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; is under tutors and governors
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; until
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; the time appointed by the father.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; So a child is no different from a
[1:20:17] servant
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; because you cannot give a child
[1:20:19] inheritance. You cannot give a child
[1:20:21] position. The child have to be trained
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; or tutored or directed or guided until
[1:20:28] the child come to maturity to handle
[1:20:31] responsibility. The Bible said this way.
[1:20:33] When I was a child, spake like a child,
[1:20:36] taught like a child, understood as a
[1:20:39] child, but when I become a man, I put
[1:20:42] away. Glory to the Lord. I shout in the
[1:20:44] house.
[1:20:46] There are too many people not putting
[1:20:48] away stuff. You got to put away.
[1:20:51] [Applause]
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; God, let me let me hit you a little bit
[1:20:57] now. God is not coming to put away for
[1:20:59] you.
[1:21:06] that come like you have the broom and
[1:21:07] man if I have dirt in the house and you
[1:21:08] asking God angel hallelujah glory
[1:21:10] hallelujah angel would you come down in
[1:21:12] the name of Jesus and take that boom and
[1:21:14] give me a sweep
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; angel will tell my job
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; talking to the wrong man
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; I a come to sweep no broom
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; I dirt it yet
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; I had the dust
[1:21:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Clean up the room, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:21:35] Glory to the angels.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Angel will come now, you know, and show
[1:21:38] which the broom is.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Obviously, you forget where the broom
[1:21:42] is.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; The rise and fall of King Saul.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; What is astonishing is when they're
[1:21:53] looking for Saul and calling for him,
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; he hiding.
[1:21:58] God to find him. He be behind you here.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Saul don't want to be identified. Saul
[1:22:06] don't want to be called out. Saul humble
[1:22:08] in heart.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; He's hiding
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; from the ministry God called him for.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; His problem wasn't woman like Samson.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; His problem was obedience.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; His problem was patience.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; His problem was waiting on God
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; and waiting for God. And the prophet
[1:22:27] said waiting on God and waiting for God
[1:22:28] is where perfection lies.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Because in waiting is where your faith
[1:22:33] grow and mature.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; That's why God will give his children
[1:22:37] everything they want, when they want,
[1:22:38] how they want it, he make it a wait.
[1:22:41] That's why the Bible says under tutors
[1:22:43] and governors until
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; you can't tell the father hey until
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; because there was a young man who told
[1:22:50] his father an in entitled in disciplined
[1:22:54] young man
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; who wants his or now he said I ain't
[1:22:56] wait for the dead no daddy
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; he could have told his son son you're
[1:23:01] not ready
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; you're not mature you want to flirt with
[1:23:06] your friends you want to buy a fancy car
[1:23:09] painted in a fancy color and You want to
[1:23:11] beat yourself all around the country
[1:23:13] that you have better than them.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; That young man said, "Give me my
[1:23:18] portion." Now that is getting
[1:23:20] inheritance. Oh, glory before maturity
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; before the time.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Now tutors and governors and we will get
[1:23:27] into it. The tutor part is to teach your
[1:23:29] character,
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; behavior, and attitude. The governor is
[1:23:32] the trusty part that holds your wealth,
[1:23:35] that takes care of your business until
[1:23:38] you come to maturity, until you could
[1:23:40] handle, until they could sign or get the
[1:23:43] Lord a shout.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; In the Greek is not the same word. It
[1:23:48] said tutors and governors.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Your blessing could be delayed,
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; but it can't be denied. Oh, preach back
[1:24:01] to me somebody. Preach back to me
[1:24:03] somebody. It could be delayed but not
[1:24:06] denied because you are son and if a son
[1:24:09] then an airmen.
[1:24:11] [Music]
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; It means you have an inheritance.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; God set it up that way.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; What a brother. He has not separated the
[1:24:30] people into classes
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; so that the masses are led by a holy
[1:24:34] priesthood.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; It is true that the leadership must be
[1:24:38] holy but then so must the whole
[1:24:40] congregation.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Further, there is no place in the word
[1:24:47] where priests
[1:24:49] or ministers
[1:24:51] or such mediate between God and the
[1:24:54] people.
[1:24:56] Nor is there a place where they are
[1:24:58] separated in their worship of the Lord.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; So people worshiping but ministers
[1:25:05] taking notes.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; They could take your notes in the
[1:25:08] stadium room but they don't want to
[1:25:10] worship. That's a problem.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; The hands stiff
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; not with writers
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; but with no praise demon to lift their
[1:25:18] hand and give God glory and shout.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; David was different. When David saw the
[1:25:23] ark coming down the road, David forget
[1:25:27] he was king. David forget who his wife
[1:25:29] was. David forget the throne he was
[1:25:31] sitting on. He was forgetting the castle
[1:25:33] he was coming in. He said to dance and
[1:25:35] dance and dance.
[1:25:38] His prim and proud wife
[1:25:41] just got a fresh dress from the same
[1:25:44] stress. Just tried it on looking to see
[1:25:47] have a husband how it looking on me and
[1:25:49] she to look through the window and see
[1:25:50] him dancing. She felt embarrassed and
[1:25:53] ashamed.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; So when David come into the house, she
[1:25:56] wanted to give him mouth.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; She wanted to tell him how she was so
[1:25:59] embarrassed to say you are the king like
[1:26:01] you recognize your position in the
[1:26:03] world.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Recognize who you are. David said,
[1:26:08] "Woman, you ain't see nothing yet. Come
[1:26:11] back tomorrow. Come back when this
[1:26:13] revival strike. Come back with them
[1:26:15] seven thunders. Utter the voices to that
[1:26:18] group who could take the word and hand
[1:26:20] it to them. Give the Lord a shout. You
[1:26:22] come back. Make a spin and come back.
[1:26:25] Make a turn and come back. Seven
[1:26:27] thunders is not dead.
[1:26:31] It's alive and kicking in Trinidad.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. It's
[1:26:36] alive and kicking in the bride.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; It's a bright promise.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Are we not moving from it?
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praises.
[1:26:50] [Applause]
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:56] They call fire pastor a dead preacher.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Dead congregation.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Frozen preacher.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Congregation frozen to you know
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; iceberg preacher.
[1:27:10] People just cold ice is iceberg. You say
[1:27:13] no iceberg.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; I am moving
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; stiff.
[1:27:22] The church needs some fire. You know,
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; melt the ice. Yes.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Your fire. You s my next iceberg there.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Your fire around you burn that ice
[1:27:29] there.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Brother.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; What God wants all to love and serve him
[1:27:38] together. Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Nicolitism destroyed those precepts
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; and instead separates the ministers from
[1:27:47] the people
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; and make the leaders overlords
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; instead of servants.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; And years ago, God opened something unto
[1:27:56] me about servantthood and minister. And
[1:28:00] I shared with Bleman and he said that is
[1:28:04] something. I was telling him how the
[1:28:06] Lord showed me anybody could be a
[1:28:07] minister. take Bible and preach text and
[1:28:10] quote and read and have congregation.
[1:28:12] Anybody could do that. But servant is
[1:28:14] different.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Anybody could preach. Anybody could
[1:28:20] minister. Anybody could start a group
[1:28:22] and whatnot. But servantthood is when
[1:28:24] you put on that robe.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; When you have the trade to come to
[1:28:27] serve, that's servantthood.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; That's a different category altogether.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus demonstrated it when he says, "Let
[1:28:34] him that is great among you, let him
[1:28:37] serve.
[1:28:41] Jesus demonstrated that
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; when he went and wash your feet
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; because that was a servant's position.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; When you come to the house servants, it
[1:28:52] must wash your feet before you enter
[1:28:54] into the inner court.
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Cuz all the street have donkey mess. All
[1:29:00] the street have horse and all kind of
[1:29:01] stuff on the street. So when you're
[1:29:03] walking with them long garments, all
[1:29:04] your robes have a lot of stuff on it.
[1:29:06] your foot filthy because in them days
[1:29:08] didn't have them shoes you have here
[1:29:10] right now. Them shoes I make yet is
[1:29:12] sandals. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; So when Jesus come into the man house,
[1:29:18] his foot sticking up with all them dirt
[1:29:20] on it and mud on it
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; and them slackers they even get somebody
[1:29:25] to wash his feet
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; which was the rule in that day.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; You don't go any man house and just walk
[1:29:31] inside with a dirty feet like that.
[1:29:33] There are people with basins to wash
[1:29:34] your feet
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; before you enter into the house to get
[1:29:37] some food or something like that.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; A prostitute woman see Jesus through a
[1:29:41] window and wash his feet and say good.
[1:29:44] The wicked
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; them looking at she as wicked. And she
[1:29:48] said the wicked
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; them wicked men inside her there go let
[1:29:52] the master come and sit down like that.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; When she studied that conviction hit her
[1:29:57] heart. She had to feel filthy. She start
[1:30:00] to feel convicted of her sins. She begin
[1:30:02] to cry. She she she get inside the room.
[1:30:05] Begin to cry at Jesus' feet. Take her
[1:30:07] here and wipe his feet. Clean up his
[1:30:09] feet. And Jesus is saying nothing.
[1:30:13] Sometimes you're doing something and God
[1:30:15] is saying nothing. He said look in
[1:30:17] silence and she is doing her stuff.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; And them big shots. If he only know who
[1:30:29] kind of what kind of woman is this, he
[1:30:31] would have never let her do that. If he
[1:30:33] only know if he sho
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; when the woman finished, he broke the
[1:30:38] Simon with words.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Simon, I have a word for you. You know,
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; I come in here and here and wash my
[1:30:43] feet.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; This woman whose sins are many,
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; so he's showing them he know her
[1:30:48] condition.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Her sins are forgiven.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; She is free. I don't know about yours.
[1:30:53] But this woman here who crying, whose
[1:30:56] sins are many, who have serious
[1:30:58] conditions, she free to go.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; And you know who the son of man set
[1:31:02] free?
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; It's free indeed. Oh, get the Lord a
[1:31:05] shout. I don't care what the church
[1:31:07] members say. I don't care what people
[1:31:08] say. I don't care what your neighbors
[1:31:10] say. Who the son of man set free?
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; It's free indeed. Give the Lord some
[1:31:14] praises.
[1:31:20] Hallelujah.
[1:31:22] All right.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Now, this doctrine
[1:31:27] actually started the deed in the first
[1:31:29] age. It appears the problem lays in two
[1:31:32] words. Elders, prospertors, and
[1:31:36] overseers, bishops. True scripture shows
[1:31:40] that there are several elders in each
[1:31:42] church. Some begin inacious among them
[1:31:45] to teach that the idea of bishop is one
[1:31:49] of preeminence and authority and control
[1:31:53] over the elders.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Now the truth of the matter is the word
[1:31:56] elder signify who the person is.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; While the word bishop signifies the
[1:32:04] office of the same man.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; The elder is the man. Bishop is the
[1:32:11] office of the man. Elder has always and
[1:32:16] always will refer simply to a man's
[1:32:18] chronological age in the Lord. He is an
[1:32:21] elder not because he's elected or
[1:32:24] ordained, but because he's older.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; He is more seasoned.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; He is trained, not a novice. He is
[1:32:34] reliable because of experience and
[1:32:36] longstanding proof of his Christian
[1:32:38] experience.
[1:32:40] But no, the bishops did not stick to the
[1:32:42] epistles of Paul, but rather hear what
[1:32:45] they do. Rather, they went to Paul's
[1:32:48] account of the time he called the elders
[1:32:50] from Ephesus to Miticus in Acts 20 in
[1:32:53] verse 17, the record said elders were
[1:32:55] called. Then in verse 28, they were
[1:32:57] called overseers and bishops.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; So these bishops,
[1:33:02] they find the right quote.
[1:33:04] These bishops no doubt politically
[1:33:07] minded and anxious for power. This is
[1:33:10] what is lurking in these men.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; So that's how where they connected that
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; what politically minded anxious for
[1:33:19] power insisted that Paul had given the
[1:33:23] meaning that overseers were more than
[1:33:26] the local elder with official capacity
[1:33:29] owning his own church. To them, bishop
[1:33:32] was now one with extended authority over
[1:33:36] many local leaders.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; This denies
[1:33:45] the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; who said, "Separate me Paul and Barnamas
[1:33:50] for the work where unto I have called
[1:33:52] them."
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; This is anti-word and antichrist.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. We getting
[1:33:57] somewhere.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:00] When Adam sinned by heeding his wife
[1:34:02] reasoning instead of holding to the
[1:34:04] God's word, he lost Adam turned loose
[1:34:08] the word and sold out. Here what he
[1:34:10] lost. He lost his inheritance when he
[1:34:12] lost his fellowship
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; and right to life.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; So when he lost his life, he also lost
[1:34:18] his inheritance in life.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; God was the God of the universe. But his
[1:34:22] son had this earth under his control. He
[1:34:25] could speak, he could name, he could
[1:34:27] say, he could stop nature. He could do
[1:34:29] anything he wanted to. See, but when he
[1:34:31] did that, he lost his inheritance.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; So that is why this is very important.
[1:34:36] God restoring man want to restore not
[1:34:39] only your life but restore your
[1:34:41] inheritance
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; in life.
[1:34:44] So then this story in the Old Testament
[1:34:48] when a son is born in a home he is born
[1:34:52] he's a son of the father but yet here we
[1:34:55] go before he fell heir to the kingdom of
[1:34:57] his father or the possession the first
[1:35:00] that son had to be raised and tried.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; He had to find out whether this son was
[1:35:06] a true son or he was simply a rostabout.
[1:35:09] And this son would never be heir if he
[1:35:12] wasn't qualified
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; to take the father's place.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; So this air thing have to do with being
[1:35:19] qualified for.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; And the only way we could get qualified
[1:35:24] for is if we go through process.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[1:35:35] But if he was qualified and took the
[1:35:37] father's place, then all the father had
[1:35:40] was given to his son. There is where I
[1:35:43] think that many of us Pentecostal people
[1:35:45] have made a mistake. We think here we
[1:35:47] go. As soon as we become sons and
[1:35:49] daughters, that settled it.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; We just come but we just come into a
[1:35:54] place of trying.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; The Methodist said as soon as they
[1:35:59] shouted, they settled it.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; The Lutherans believe in faith. No
[1:36:02] matter what kind of position God put you
[1:36:03] in, you are still growing
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; towards perfection.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; So you don't talk about I have arrived.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Paul didn't talk that way. He said I
[1:36:13] press
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; towards the mark of the high calling
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. Talk like Paul. I press
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; now in England he talk about the father.
[1:36:29] As soon as this child was born, the
[1:36:31] father being so busy with other things,
[1:36:32] he sought out a tutor or a razor of his
[1:36:35] child. Then knowing this child was in
[1:36:38] line of air of everything he had, his
[1:36:40] property, his good name, everything he
[1:36:41] had would go to his son, he sought the
[1:36:43] very best school teacher he could find
[1:36:45] to teach the child.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Best tutor.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; So, so does God does the same to his
[1:36:51] children. When a man is born into the
[1:36:53] body of the Lord Jesus become the son of
[1:36:55] God. God has sought the heavens for the
[1:36:58] best tutor he knows to put over his
[1:37:00] children. And it's not a bishop but it
[1:37:02] was the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; God put over his church to raise his
[1:37:06] church to believe in spiritual things
[1:37:08] and supernatural things.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So people say the days of
[1:37:12] miracles is passed and all that
[1:37:12] supernatural is gone. God wouldn't do
[1:37:14] that. The Holy Spirit was sent to govern
[1:37:16] and guide the church and God give it to
[1:37:19] the Holy Spirit to do this. He's got a
[1:37:22] man that will tell the truth
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; for he wanted to know exactly the will
[1:37:26] for that boy at all times.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Sometime we ruck on family to lie for us
[1:37:31] or say the story or twist it a little
[1:37:33] bit to make it look good and whatn not.
[1:37:34] So this one say it so and so but the
[1:37:36] Holy Spirit will always tell
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; the truth.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; He has no authority to as you passing it
[1:37:45] back pass fast pass fast pass fast pass
[1:37:46] fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass
[1:37:46] fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass.
[1:37:48] See we we do that. Pass fast pass fast
[1:37:50] pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast
[1:37:50] pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast
[1:37:50] pass fast pass nobody see
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; everybody supposed to get one slice of
[1:37:53] cake but take take two tuna nobody
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; it's one man
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; but you want two and somebody you know
[1:38:02] who's serving hey feeling cakeish
[1:38:05] feeling see for more cake but God is not
[1:38:08] like that he the Holy Ghost will speak
[1:38:10] the truth
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; that's what God did he never trusted
[1:38:13] with any pope bishop anything else
[1:38:14] therefore the Holy Spirit will be honest
[1:38:16] with God how this razor this tutor was
[1:38:19] supposed to come and bring word to the
[1:38:21] father how the child was progressing,
[1:38:25] how the tutor must have blushed if the
[1:38:27] child was misbehaving itself, how the
[1:38:29] little boy was not interested in the
[1:38:31] things of his father, farm or kingdom.
[1:38:34] So what is a tutor? Tutor a person
[1:38:36] charged with instruction and guidance of
[1:38:39] another such as a private teacher. So
[1:38:42] let's look at Galatians again. I say
[1:38:44] that the air, as long as he's a child,
[1:38:47] as long as your behavior is immature and
[1:38:49] childish,
[1:38:52] as long as you're not ready yet, you
[1:38:54] have to be, you must be under truth and
[1:38:57] governance. Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; So all them believers who sitting home
[1:39:00] right now self-taught and think they're
[1:39:02] going in the bride, you know where they
[1:39:04] going,
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; they have a ticket to the tribulation
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; because you must be
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; under tutors
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; and governance
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; until the time appointed by the father.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; You must be
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; a student can homeschool by yourself. A
[1:39:22] homeschooling you reading your own book,
[1:39:24] you doing your own stuff. No, even if
[1:39:26] somebody's homeschooled, somebody will
[1:39:28] teach them in that home school.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; They said to be taught because they have
[1:39:32] an exam coming up
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; is not what you know, it's what you have
[1:39:36] to pass as an exam,
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; as a test.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; And a faith that cannot be tested cannot
[1:39:43] be trusted.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; So when God give you a faith, you have
[1:39:46] to test that
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; to trust that.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; What he give you, you have to test that.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Not the pastor testing you, God testing
[1:39:53] you.
[1:39:57] The issue here is not whether you're a
[1:39:59] son or not. That the issue is whether
[1:40:01] you're coming to inheritance.
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; You're not fighting to be a son, you
[1:40:09] know. It's what kind of son are you?
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; I can't say that. I can't say this one
[1:40:13] is bride. I That's foolishness. I I I
[1:40:15] picking that.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; I had the book for that.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; God give me a book about bride whose
[1:40:20] bride is not bright. You are not bride.
[1:40:22] This one is bride. I am not in a
[1:40:23] position of that
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; because if if you're looking from the
[1:40:26] eyes of man and you watch Saul who
[1:40:29] became Paul you will and he was
[1:40:31] persecuting the church you'll say that
[1:40:32] man is not no part of a sinner
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Saul Saul riding to kill the Christians
[1:40:39] and all of a sudden God pillar fire and
[1:40:41] knock him off
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; and but who art thou Lord he come to
[1:40:43] church now
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; he coming to church now
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; yesterday he persecuting riding for
[1:40:50] church next Sunday he in church and
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; blind as a bat.
[1:40:56] Give the Lord a sh
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; and anas have to lay hands upon him for
[1:41:04] him to get back his sight.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; That is good.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Bringing a son on the preachers.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; I have an ass from his left hand from
[1:41:12] his right hand. But an ass have the Holy
[1:41:14] Ghost. What can the Lord has shouted the
[1:41:16] house?
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:41:22] I don't care who Saul think he is, what
[1:41:25] he is, he still have to subject himself
[1:41:27] to the order that God put there. Holy
[1:41:30] Ghost, God ordained, spiritfilled, word
[1:41:34] living men or give the Lord a shout in
[1:41:36] the house.
[1:41:38] [Music]
[1:41:41] [Applause]
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Watch this. His calling
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; is higher than all those brothers. hard
[1:41:50] and and yet he have to come through that
[1:41:52] process.
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; He got come in there blind like a b.
[1:41:59] Don't touch me. Don't touch me.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; He will come out coming blind and walk
[1:42:04] out blind. You know,
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; so this man called Saul
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; had to humble himself.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Get hands laid upon him.
[1:42:16] Have believers don't want to shake his
[1:42:18] hands
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; because in he was former
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; killer and murderer former
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; church persecutor former former
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; that is what it is former you have a
[1:42:28] former life but when God transform your
[1:42:31] life all the devil talk about former the
[1:42:36] things I used to do I do them no more
[1:42:40] the places I used to go don't go no more
[1:42:45] the things I used to say,
[1:42:47] "I've been changed."
[1:42:50] Changed. Change.
[1:42:52] [Applause]
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; I feel a rumbling in the camp.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; I feel revelation breaking upon you.
[1:43:09] [Applause]
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Let me see this.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; After Paul get his eyesight.
[1:43:16] will ministry.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; I come for it.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Remember years ago a man say you want
[1:43:21] back the pulpit.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; I didn't take it.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; If I said I tell you the kind
[1:43:33] experiences we have been through
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; after Paul come through. He going in the
[1:43:39] desert
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; for years
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; under the tutor theship of the Holy
[1:43:45] Ghost.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; He never walked with Jesus.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; He never lived with Jesus. He never feed
[1:43:51] and sit down by Jesus feet.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Peter did.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Andrew did. John did but not Paul. But
[1:43:57] when he went in the parks in the desert,
[1:43:59] Jesus pillar of fire struck him and give
[1:44:03] him revelation.
[1:44:06] When Paul bounced back, so Paul said, "I
[1:44:09] Paul, prisoner of Jesus Christ. I Paul,
[1:44:14] an apostle. I Paul, if you don't believe
[1:44:17] what I say is the commandments of God,
[1:44:20] let him be ignorant. Paul to the
[1:44:23] Corinthians church. Paul to the Hebrew
[1:44:25] church. Paul to the Galatians church.
[1:44:28] Oh, give the Lord a shout. Come on you
[1:44:31] sons of God, under tutors, under
[1:44:35] governors until the time appointed. And
[1:44:38] when your time come, God will pull you
[1:44:41] out.
[1:44:47] [Applause]
[1:44:47] [Music]
[1:44:48] [Applause]
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; This is a special service.
[1:44:59] [Applause]
[1:45:06] You must be under truth and governors.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Not them nicolatan spirits. Not them men
[1:45:11] who taking power over people's lives and
[1:45:14] controlling what they buy, where they
[1:45:15] go. I'm not talking about that crazy
[1:45:17] stuff that we have here in Trinidad.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about that.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; An air.
[1:45:27] A heir is a child who is legally
[1:45:30] the future owner of the father's estate.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Tutors and governors are guardians,
[1:45:38] stewards,
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; overseers who manage the heir's life,
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; education,
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; and estate.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; So sometime when you have something for
[1:45:47] a child, you can't give the child. You
[1:45:49] give the child to in a trustee.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; I forget what form they have in my legal
[1:45:53] term. I'm not a legal person. But they
[1:45:55] put it in a way when the child reach 21
[1:45:57] years old,
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; they have access to it.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; So you could cry at 19 you have to wait
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; at 20 and a half you had to wait.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; It's only when you're 21 years old.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; You could walk into the bank or walk in
[1:46:14] and say yes.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; I want my father left for me my uncle or
[1:46:18] whoever leave for you.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; But you have to wait.
[1:46:24] under tutors
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; and governors
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; the tutor I'll be saying already when
[1:46:29] prince I can't who they have now prince
[1:46:32] prince I don't know I don't follow them
[1:46:33] England thing prince Charles and who the
[1:46:35] children is and whatn not but when the
[1:46:37] child is born
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; those prince and queen whatever they
[1:46:40] call them right they born understanding
[1:46:43] what going on if they born and pack them
[1:46:45] to train they talk
[1:46:48] they go
[1:46:50] taxi and they drop and what normal
[1:46:51] normal you know
[1:46:54] If you leave them here, they talk, act,
[1:46:57] live, stand up to the flag and
[1:46:58] everything normal, normal, you know,
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; but they're not Trinidadians.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; They born to uh uh high lineage or
[1:47:05] whatever it is. But so, so therefore,
[1:47:07] they have to train those children
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; in the ways of kingship or queenship and
[1:47:12] the history and lage and they they see
[1:47:14] all the crowns and your mother was the
[1:47:16] queen and this and that and that
[1:47:18] etiquette, how to cut it. Hallelujah.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Some people don't no don't know how to
[1:47:21] handle that knife and fork.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Got to know how to do the thing and
[1:47:26] thing.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; If you're not willing to learn knife and
[1:47:28] fork,
[1:47:30] you can't qualify.
[1:47:32] You have to learn the etiquette.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; So when they start to take pictures of
[1:47:35] them after you take picture, you have to
[1:47:38] don't take picture with child
[1:47:42] on this side here.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Afterwards, the children understand
[1:47:45] pictures is where they go.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. The paparazzi always following
[1:47:49] them. Clicks, clicks, wear pink shoes,
[1:47:51] brown shoes, they like the shoes, all
[1:47:53] kind of thing. That's news.
[1:47:55] So they afterwards they get they have
[1:47:58] this royal kind of life but because of
[1:48:00] the thinking change because of the
[1:48:02] tutorship because of the discipline
[1:48:04] bringing them listen
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; the names of these children you can't
[1:48:07] just pick any name in some cu name they
[1:48:09] have l you can't put that on princ they
[1:48:13] have certain names Andrew um Charles
[1:48:17] certain spec you got to pick one of them
[1:48:19] you know
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; so you can feel led I feel like my my
[1:48:23] son I want to call him XY and Z
[1:48:28] cuz nobody have that name.
[1:48:32] No, it doesn't work. So, so I want to
[1:48:35] show you something
[1:48:37] that discipline
[1:48:40] and restraint is necessary
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; in order to get you to the place that
[1:48:45] God want you to be.
[1:48:48] God can't risk you being loose
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; and give you inheritance. Because I
[1:48:52] could show you, I've seen my own self
[1:48:54] that promoting people before time could
[1:48:56] destroy them.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Putting power on people before time
[1:49:01] could wreck them.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Not everybody could handle power.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Not everybody could handle money.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; That why some people don't have
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; I don't mean that as an excuse or a
[1:49:16] joke. Amen.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; You can't manage 100,000
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; scripture. You have a scripture for
[1:49:23] that. Sure. He who is faithful in little
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; will be faithful in much.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; So God has test your first with little
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; to see how you manage.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; It's only 100. How much you want.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; We want to see how you're managing $100.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; You manage it well, you can handle
[1:49:43] a,000.
[1:49:45] 100,000 well they get 110,000
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; and because they 10,000 they get 100,000
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; and that's how you can get the million
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; the people light face light up already
[1:49:57] I have no problem with you light up for
[1:49:58] the million or no
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; but the point about it you have to start
[1:50:01] with 100
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; and many times people don't want
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; to go to the hund
[1:50:10] mind running
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; look at Esther Queen Esther
[1:50:14] Hallelujah.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Modi was a tutor.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Modi was a governor.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Modi was given her guidance.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Morai was saying, "Esther, don't tell
[1:50:24] them who your people are.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Keep it locked down.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; I'm feeling led. Hush your mouth,
[1:50:29] sister.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Them wild kind of loose lips.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Esther was going to damage the whole
[1:50:37] thing earlier. Clock.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Don't say where your lineage at." Amen.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Keep quiet.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Stay humble.
[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; I'll get it.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; But under Morai directions, Esther got
[1:50:54] the breakthrough.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Esther got the victory.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; How could you get the victory without
[1:50:59] tutors and governors?
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Without guidance and direction.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Don't fool yourself.
[1:51:05] There no DIY.
[1:51:14] DIY,
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; do it yourself.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; A lot of things is DIY now. When you do
[1:51:21] it yourself, plumbing, do yourself this
[1:51:23] until thing going real bad, you call a
[1:51:25] real plumber.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Careful with DIY. You know,
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; if a fire start do DIY and say, well,
[1:51:33] you know, watching it,
[1:51:36] your house will burn down with that DIY.
[1:51:38] You know,
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; don't do it yourself. God have no do it
[1:51:41] yourself and be adopted. You're home.
[1:51:43] You're getting revelation. You're going
[1:51:44] to fight with brother. You ain't going
[1:51:45] to that church. You're going to fight.
[1:51:47] God send me to fight you.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Do you ever put that in your heart and
[1:51:52] mind? You're foolish. Lord,
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; God have nothing else to do but to send
[1:51:55] me to fight you.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; See, no, when you think about it
[1:51:58] carefully, we have one enemy.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; That's the devil.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; We fighting him every day. Your enemy
[1:52:05] and my enemy is the same enemy. I am not
[1:52:07] your enemy.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; This word I'm preaching applies to me.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching down to you.
[1:52:23] [Music]
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Bible study on Friday. Isaac show is not
[1:52:28] gift. It's not anointing. It's not
[1:52:31] testimony. Paul could Saul could say I
[1:52:33] was anointed by power. who we Samuel
[1:52:36] himself put the horn of oil upon me
[1:52:39] wasn't a false prophet was a true
[1:52:40] prophet anointed me
[1:52:43] yeah but then when Samuel gave
[1:52:45] instructions to obey he disobeyed
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; and Samuel told Saul you acted foolishly
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; you're not a priest you're not a prophet
[1:52:52] who you offering
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; well the people and they get frightening
[1:52:57] and notice he not accept responsibility
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; that is part of the insecurity inside of
[1:53:02] him
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; and when people insecure they can't
[1:53:04] handle criticism
[1:53:06] You have to put up your defenses and
[1:53:07] make excuses,
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; blame somebody.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; You misunderstand why I say all kind of
[1:53:15] excuses. You have to just admit it.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; And if he fail at that, he was a bigger
[1:53:21] failure for the next test
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; cuz the next test God come and tell him
[1:53:24] kill everything.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Goat, cattle, sheep and don't just don't
[1:53:28] hold nothing from them people. Every man
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; when the battle over Samuel come he say
[1:53:34] hallelujah glory Bible says you know he
[1:53:37] said I I have done the will of the Lord
[1:53:41] and then Sam said what is this bleeting
[1:53:44] I am hearing
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; I ain't supposed to hear nothing
[1:53:46] bleeding
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; I hear bleeding there
[1:53:53] will be there
[1:53:55] whose sheep is that he say we save the
[1:53:57] best to offer to Lord.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; And we have King Aag.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Big King Agog,
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; alive and kicking.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; He come to sacrifice.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; And God tell him kill all.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Kill all.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Friends, we have to get more serious
[1:54:23] about what God saying.
[1:54:26] If I could fade away and all you could
[1:54:29] hear is what God say. It is rocking. You
[1:54:32] know
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; I some thunder last night. I know it was
[1:54:34] raining.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you heard it too.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; That was serious thunder. You know
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't look out.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; I might see lightning to hearing it was
[1:54:43] good enough.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Think about it now.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; That's natural thunder rocking hard. No
[1:54:51] rain falling you know. But you telling
[1:54:53] yourself rain falling somewhere. That
[1:54:55] noise upstairs is mean something
[1:54:57] happening elsewhere.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; It might be by your house but it's
[1:55:00] elsewhere.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Well, God coming in thunders just now
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; and the thunders going to be judgment
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; because the mercy seat is a mercy seat
[1:55:08] because it have blood on it.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; It's really a judgment seat.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord us praises in his
[1:55:13] life.
[1:55:15] So this tutorship, guardianship,
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; overseers, over the air's life is for
[1:55:22] until he comes to maturity.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; A maturity is when they could move from
[1:55:29] I have to to I want to.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Why I had to do that? People young
[1:55:37] people say it's pulling teeth. Well, I I
[1:55:39] used to understand that expression. Now
[1:55:40] I'm learning about it now. trying to
[1:55:42] pull my teeth.
[1:55:44] You know was trying to force issue
[1:55:46] trying to force me to bend and force me
[1:55:48] and and you see you want to do your own
[1:55:50] thing.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; That's not what God say here.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Maturity is when you begin to accept
[1:55:55] responsibility and you want to do what
[1:55:57] God wants you to do.
[1:56:00] [Applause]
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:56:04] So this
[1:56:06] until the time appointed
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; this and I like the words how you see
[1:56:12] this D I call it delay. This delay in
[1:56:15] your blessing or delay in your getting
[1:56:18] your portion is really to enact
[1:56:22] development
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; until your time appointed. Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; So waiting on God and waiting for God is
[1:56:31] the process of character development.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; So when God give you a delay is not oh
[1:56:39] God why you denying me what kind of
[1:56:42] thing is this you want to give me
[1:56:44] pressure. No what he wants to do is to
[1:56:46] bring a development a transformation a
[1:56:50] change in your life because you're about
[1:56:52] to be promoted. You have to be able to
[1:56:54] handle more. Amen.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Ask all them workers. Look, I see Jason
[1:56:58] hand there. They will always tell you
[1:57:00] how the company will send for training
[1:57:02] and more training and more training.
[1:57:03] It's not that the company feeling
[1:57:04] trainish, you know. It's because they
[1:57:06] are different levels of responsibility
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; and some of these jobs are dangerous.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Turn the valve 10° to the right or the
[1:57:18] left and you feel turn it more and blow
[1:57:21] up the whole company, whole place.
[1:57:24] There's too much people feeling led
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; not to subject yourself or obey.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; You can't do your own thing.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; You have to follow instructions.
[1:57:37] every air
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; must pass through tutors, governors,
[1:57:44] mentors, pastors,
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; elders,
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; learning, obedience,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; growth through discipline
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; and guided by rules.

[1:58:02] saying the young people today have such
[1:58:04] short attention span. I was telling my
[1:58:07] wife I want to see a man have sing the

[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; I tell you one day I read the Bible say
[1:59:56] call no man father say how the man was
[1:59:58] father Leo I said father Leo the Bible
[2:00:00] say
[2:00:02] father give me one clout behind my head
[2:00:05] escape down the altar that was the last
[2:00:06] time you see me you know because I was
[2:00:08] giving father Leo the word I was going
[2:00:10] St. Steven's College and they used and
[2:00:12] somebody the Gideonss people I think
[2:00:14] they from around the world they used to
[2:00:15] give out free Bibles and whatnot. I had
[2:00:17] friends put their Bible in the garbage
[2:00:18] and whatnot. I started to read a little
[2:00:19] little New Testament. I said to read it
[2:00:21] and man that was book was light up my
[2:00:23] life.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; One scripture Matthew 5:48. Never forget
[2:00:27] that. Be there for perfect be perfect as
[2:00:29] your father was perfect. I felt that
[2:00:30] speak to me. I'm to be perfect. My God I
[2:00:33] wasn't even repenting yet. I wasn't I
[2:00:34] was still a sinner but something tell me
[2:00:36] I am to be perfect. It was something in
[2:00:38] my soul. Oh glory to God. My friends
[2:00:40] couldn't stop me from reading that
[2:00:42] Bible. My friends couldn't stop me from
[2:00:44] going this way. Oh, give the Lord a
[2:00:46] shout. Don't let your friend stop you.
[2:00:47] You be a leader, not a follower. Give
[2:00:50] the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:00:53] [Applause]
[2:00:54] [Music]
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't escape this path. The Bible
[2:01:03] says though he was a son
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 5:'8 yet learning obedience
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; by the things which he suffered.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; So Jesus learned
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; the Bible talk about he increase in
[2:01:15] wisdom and knowledge
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; and found favor with God and man.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus wasn't a clong. He wasn't a fool.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; He learned how to find favor
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; with God and man.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Some people so spiritual they get manve
[2:01:28] vex neighbor vex. Everybody vex.
[2:01:32] and they going to church.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Joseph
[2:01:46] love of the father
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; hated of his brothers. Father gave a
[2:01:50] quote of many colors.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; He getting visions
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; of they bowing to him. He getting
[2:01:54] visions of power. Visions. And what
[2:01:57] happened to Joseph?
[2:01:59] Let me thrown power all your command bow
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; he can't work sir they sell him out
[2:02:06] 14 years old 15 years old to Egypt I had
[2:02:10] to learn a new language and guess what
[2:02:12] there's some people when things go
[2:02:14] negative or things go contrary that's it
[2:02:16] no they give up you know I learn
[2:02:18] languages speak my own language speak
[2:02:20] your own language
[2:02:22] you'll be like a fool
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; how would you be wise
[2:02:26] how will you get through life
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; you have to learn.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; To learn is to grow.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; You have to read. You have to study.
[2:02:34] Some people are reading nothing.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; What they know is what they have learned
[2:02:37] for the last 30 years, 40 years.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Learn of me."
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; He comes in the learning of his word.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; And I can't bring to you my own thoughts
[2:02:48] and ideas. I have to bring to you his
[2:02:49] word that you could learn his word.
[2:02:51] That's why he take them out of Egypt to
[2:02:52] bring them to this mountain that they
[2:02:54] could get a revelation of who God is,
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; his ways, his being, how he lives.
[2:03:01] If you try to serve God outside his
[2:03:03] word, you serving God by the imagination
[2:03:05] of your own heart.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; You trying nothing.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; The president of America recently said
[2:03:16] he understand that he's loading on the
[2:03:18] top pole to go to heaven.
[2:03:22] So he want peace with Ukraine and Russia
[2:03:25] because that is increases odds chance of
[2:03:27] going to heaven.
[2:03:30] I can't make that up.
[2:03:35] He here he low down
[2:03:38] and he want to make it to heaven.
[2:03:42] A president talking that talk. He hoping
[2:03:45] if you do a peace deal if he could save
[2:03:47] 500,000 or 5,000 lives a day from being
[2:03:50] killed, you know, he stand a chance.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; This say how to stand a chance.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Repent every one of you and be baptized.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; So, Joseph dreams and visions
[2:04:09] didn't have an immediate fulfillment.
[2:04:13] God put time on it
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; because Joseph certainly wasn't ready.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; He had to be sold into Egypt.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Pressure.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Learn language. Pressure. Behave well
[2:04:26] under pressure.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; And still be blessed
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; in pressure.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Okay. Help me somebody. Help me preach
[2:04:32] somebody now.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Are you under pressure this morning?
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; My God, you're just like Joseph.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; He get blessed to be in piva house.
[2:04:42] Portifa gardener
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; working so good he get promotion
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; and promotion sometime is troubling her
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; because wife was trouble
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; she push Joseph Joseph run out straight
[2:04:52] out
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; he had to know he went to stand when to
[2:04:54] run he run a man
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; a man knows when to run Joseph ran and
[2:04:59] he end up in prison God bless him in
[2:05:01] prison
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; but he is there somebody could tease him
[2:05:04] what about the vision get an email
[2:05:06] Joseph what about the vision you have
[2:05:07] going hey
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; two years pass three years us.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't give the vision.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; God give the vision.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; The vision is true.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; But the time is long.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; He had to wait until
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; the time appointed.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; He interpret the dream of the bottle and
[2:05:25] the baker. He knew the bottler was going
[2:05:27] to be restored.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "When you're going to power,
[2:05:30] remember me."
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Soon as the man hit that wine and hold
[2:05:34] that glass, he forget Joseph.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; God wanted the man to forget Joseph
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; because Joseph wasn't ready yet. Oh,
[2:05:40] give the Lord some praises.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; And if you're not ready yet, you're
[2:05:44] under tutors and governors, you're under
[2:05:46] pressure, you're under trial, you're
[2:05:48] under testing, you're under tribulation,
[2:05:50] give the Lord some praises in the house.
[2:05:52] [Music]
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; He said Joseph had to shave
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; his beard grow out
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; and he said Joseph had to get shave him
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; before he was presented. And you say God
[2:06:07] have to shave us, shave our wills, shave
[2:06:10] our ways, shave our attitudes. God have
[2:06:13] to shave us. And when the time come, God
[2:06:15] gave Pharaoh a dream.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; And when Pharaoh say I will cut off all
[2:06:19] all your head, all you playing wise men,
[2:06:20] all you playing this, all you praying
[2:06:22] spiritual, all you wise men, all on the
[2:06:25] payroll for so long with all your meek,
[2:06:27] interpret that for me.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; They say tell us a dream. Say I can't
[2:06:30] remember.
[2:06:32] Amen.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; They say if you tell us we he said no
[2:06:37] all spiritual
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; I didn't say I didn't claim that
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; only the message long time
[2:06:43] only inspiration only this and that all
[2:06:46] they see mysteries and thing
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; when that butler recognized that men go
[2:06:52] and lose their head he remembered Joseph
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; he said a man in the prison interpret
[2:06:57] dreams to me and it was correct
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; send for Joseph Amen.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a praise in the house.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; That man coming out of prison into
[2:07:08] power.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Open the prisons. And here come brother
[2:07:12] Joseph
[2:07:14] coming out to interpret the dream for
[2:07:17] Pharaoh. Oh, give the Lord a shout. He
[2:07:21] said the dream is certain and the
[2:07:24] interpretation sure. Oh, give the Lord a
[2:07:27] shout. There is a God that they can
[2:07:30] interpret the dreams.
[2:07:32] Hallelujah.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; What I love about Joseph, he was so wise
[2:07:37] and instructed and in this the midst of
[2:07:40] things, he said, "Here, what to do?
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Get a man,
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; a wise man
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; that could handle what is to come.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Set him over this thing
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; as ruler to govern the penty part and
[2:07:52] the famine part."
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh say, "You had a man." Oh, give
[2:07:55] the Lord a shout.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:08:00] Hallelujah.
[2:08:01] on the tutors and governors until the
[2:08:04] time appointed of the father. And when
[2:08:06] your time come, no devil could stop you.
[2:08:09] When your time come, nothing present,
[2:08:11] nothing past going to hold you back from
[2:08:14] coming into position
[2:08:16] that God raised you up for, that God
[2:08:18] ordained for you. Do I hear a shout in
[2:08:20] the house?
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Devil's a liar this morning.
[2:08:29] Hallelujah.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; So God is the one
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; that uses time,
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; uses delays,
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; uses tribulation
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; and all of that to bring us into
[2:08:42] leadership.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Abraham had 25 years
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; to believe God with a wife that didn't
[2:08:49] have a revelation,
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; that did not hear from God.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't divorce her
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; because God tell him through Sarah. You
[2:08:55] couldn't say I want a young thing. I
[2:08:56] want a young girl and what not. I want
[2:08:58] No, no, no. Sarah.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; So, you had to stick with that
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; because God said through Sarah,
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; I don't care how she behave.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; I don't care how she act.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; I insecure, insecure mom. Oh, God.
[2:09:09] Sarah, you know why? Oh, see, pray for
[2:09:11] me. Take your wife for God.
[2:09:14] She ain't cooking. She
[2:09:17] not Abraham.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; He was strong in faith,
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; giving glory to God. And he was fully
[2:09:23] persuaded. Are you fully persuaded that
[2:09:27] what God promised, he promised to heal
[2:09:29] you.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; He promised to seal you. He promised to
[2:09:32] deliver you. What God promised, he is
[2:09:36] able to perform.
[2:09:41] No man could hold back your blessing.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; No man could take your blessing. Your
[2:09:47] blessing reserves.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. It like a
[2:09:51] seat mark reserve reserve for you. It
[2:09:54] have your name on it. Nobody can put
[2:09:56] their name on that seat. That is your
[2:09:59] place. That is your position. That is
[2:10:01] your portion.
[2:10:03] [Applause]
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; The governor Yes,
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; the manager out there is steward
[2:10:24] overseer over the property and the
[2:10:25] finances.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; That's the governor.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; So in other words, when the child is
[2:10:30] small, the child not ready yet, the
[2:10:33] governor will ensure his right
[2:10:35] investment place. The money is growing.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; You're not burying it in a hole.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Things are covered. So the father leave
[2:10:43] 100,000 and by the time the child is air
[2:10:45] is 600,000
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; 700 because he have right trustees right
[2:10:50] governors
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; not to manage the inheritance until the
[2:10:54] child is responsible
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; and could account and take
[2:10:57] responsibility.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; So why would God give rascal's power
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; when the throne is guarded?
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; The guardians of the throne. A face of a
[2:11:09] man, a face of a lion, a face of a ox, a
[2:11:13] face of a eagle guard in God's presence.
[2:11:17] Oh give the Lord a shout. He said God
[2:11:19] have guardians that no scaly had good
[2:11:21] access.
[2:11:26] Oh give the Lord a shout of
[2:11:40] So your father have a farm,
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; a big kingdom of business
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; and you don't care.

[2:12:21] business, know what the land is, know
[2:12:24] where the market is, know when you're
[2:12:26] planting, when you're reaping, when
[2:12:28] you're sewing. He understand the feel
[2:12:30] what's going on inside of there
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; because the father himself looking for
[2:12:37] somebody to take over.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; The father here gray.

[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; once he played he winning
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; when you playing you losing
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; on the lucky over seven
[2:14:01] unlucky thing you know.
[2:14:04] So the tutor
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; dealt with the child's training,
[2:14:07] discipline and character
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; education
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; studies.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; The teacher doing that
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; because the teacher want you to be
[2:14:15] successful.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; The teacher want you to take over.
[2:14:21] [Music]
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; I know men who start businesses by
[2:14:26] inspiration, prosper, and when their
[2:14:29] sons take over, the whole thing crash.
[2:14:32] These sons never got equipped
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; to handle the challenges of the business
[2:14:37] that their father start without
[2:14:38] education
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; but fulfilled by inspiration
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; because for business now you can't be a
[2:14:45] fool.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; You got to be hit on a feeling feeling
[2:14:53] the amount of companies I see crash.
[2:14:56] There was a one company um just tell my
[2:14:58] wife about this strange enough was um
[2:15:00] Blockbuster.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Blockbuster used to have people
[2:15:04] borrowing videos time was VHS cassette
[2:15:06] and thing. They have uh buildings all
[2:15:09] over America. All over Blockbuster
[2:15:11] you had to go and return back the
[2:15:12] cassette and borrow and borrow and all
[2:15:14] over all over was Blockbuster. Next
[2:15:17] company called Netflix then put
[2:15:20] everything online. Blockbuster got
[2:15:22] busted.
[2:15:23] There was no more blockbuster on the bus
[2:15:25] on on the block.
[2:15:27] Every single one of them closed down.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Gone completely out of existence.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; I can tell you over and over but
[2:15:35] different companies. And what what the
[2:15:37] phone one again?
[2:15:40] Blackberry.
[2:15:42] Long time we out a berry. Blackberry.
[2:15:45] You have no berry at all. That was the
[2:15:48] phone until the iPhone come. Blackberry
[2:15:51] just gone black out. Just
[2:15:55] get wipe out.
[2:15:57] Think about it.
[2:15:59] When God gives Saul the pink set that he
[2:16:03] was out of power, he stayed 15 years and
[2:16:04] not thrown him.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; But God not with him.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; God finished with him.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; God show I find a better man.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; I was hoping you to be that kind of man,
[2:16:17] but I found a better man. And I'm going
[2:16:18] to show you. God always looking. If the
[2:16:21] son don't want to be the air, he find
[2:16:22] somebody else. So if you don't want it,
[2:16:25] there's somebody going to take it.
[2:16:27] There's somebody going to give it. Get
[2:16:30] serious this morning about this thing.
[2:16:31] This is real.
[2:16:33] Give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:16:40] The prodigal son brother, the older one
[2:16:43] who never went and gamble, who never
[2:16:45] went and flirt and everything else. When
[2:16:47] he heard
[2:16:49] the fat going on and the party going on
[2:16:51] and he come and say, "What going on
[2:16:52] there?" He said, "Kill the fatted C.
[2:16:54] Your brother come back, hurt his heart,
[2:16:57] break his spirit." He said, "Not going
[2:17:00] inside."
[2:17:01] All the time he's brother this and
[2:17:02] brother this, you know, you don't know
[2:17:04] what post he had in church. Sincere
[2:17:06] brother he going say he vex we vex so he
[2:17:09] rascal brother he have a pain now his
[2:17:12] brother come back there some people only
[2:17:14] see what in them when you see other
[2:17:15] people get back in
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; I can tell you something scare you
[2:17:22] there's a sister who
[2:17:25] when her husband back sitting she on top
[2:17:27] of the mountain we
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; she inspired
[2:17:32] that's how husband doing encouraging him
[2:17:34] when he got back on track and try to
[2:17:36] sell his home order. She will stay away
[2:17:38] from church,
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; break him down until he come back right
[2:17:41] back out.
[2:17:44] I could tell you some stories here.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not making it up there.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Ask my wife real stuff, you know.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Time she say she had a dream. She
[2:17:54] dreamed me and she a brown man toilet
[2:17:55] and she want things. So when I had to
[2:17:57] straighten out and I start to talk to
[2:17:58] her, I said, "I'm the brown man.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; That's your dream." She said, "Not at
[2:18:02] all. Not at all.
[2:18:05] all the time she said you
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; but when it come for correction
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; instruction bringing guidance she
[2:18:14] rejected it
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; she's no longer in this world so the air
[2:18:22] though the Bible call it lord of all is
[2:18:25] restricted
[2:18:28] by tutors
[2:18:30] and by governors until they reach
[2:18:33] maturity
[2:18:35] restricted. And this is what a lot of
[2:18:37] parents don't do.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; They don't bring their children under
[2:18:41] discipline or restrictions
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; because they catering for their
[2:18:45] feelings.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Whether you say amen or not,
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; this word still coming through
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; because remember they not just pastor
[2:18:56] over this is also a parent over it.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; And I know how I deal with my sons.
[2:19:02] Somebody let your children get away with
[2:19:03] too much of stuff
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; because they're not ready yet.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; So they can't dictate if they're under
[2:19:10] your roof, they're under your roof.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; And if they're under your roof, they're
[2:19:13] supposed to behave a certain way.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; If they don't want to behave that way,
[2:19:16] get out from under my roof. That is all.
[2:19:22] [Applause]
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; I am seen about the house.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; I am responsible for the house. I don't
[2:19:28] care what you're going through. What
[2:19:29] your friends telling you? What peer
[2:19:31] pressure and whatnot? Long time peer
[2:19:32] pressure was I putting pressure on my
[2:19:33] peers.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; I thought I was supposed to be
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; no peer pressure.
[2:19:40] They putting pressure on me and
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; we need
[2:19:46] leaders.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; We need true influencers, not what they
[2:19:51] have right now because they're trying to
[2:19:52] influence your children off the word,
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; off the beaten path. Amen.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; We want you to take the courage and give
[2:19:57] them the confidence and the inspiration
[2:19:59] that God is with them, that God is for
[2:20:01] them, that God called them.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my time just running.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:20:09] So therefore, the restriction on the
[2:20:12] inheritance, I want my money. I want it
[2:20:15] now. That that rascal entitled guy we
[2:20:18] call the political son, he got it. You
[2:20:21] know I think his father might have been
[2:20:23] reluctant but the father of him ready
[2:20:25] but the father give him he say father
[2:20:27] give me now no I don't want you wait to
[2:20:28] dead give me no
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; I think I could manage and he couldn't
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; you know what convince him pick food
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; pig food
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; living in the band behind the white
[2:20:44] house
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; when people think he dropping off there
[2:20:46] and that house is his own is the back he
[2:20:49] rented
[2:20:51] big food.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; But that guy somehow we came to himself.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; And I hope this message you come to
[2:20:56] yourself and stop this baby stuff as if
[2:20:59] he's supposed to baby you and wet you
[2:21:01] and encourage you and put man on you and
[2:21:03] spray you every morning and whatnot.
[2:21:04] Chip ch all kind of thing bugs and thing
[2:21:06] on you. That's not what God set up. You
[2:21:08] know,
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; when God put something you you come bug
[2:21:11] resistance, you know, bug bite, but you
[2:21:13] take your bite and you move on.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:17] [Applause]
[2:21:19] Hallelujah.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; If you're Sophie and your father have a
[2:21:23] farm and you go on a farm and mosquitoes
[2:21:24] had to put some bites on you and some
[2:21:26] fleas and all have all kind of cow itch
[2:21:27] and all kind of things that you run back
[2:21:30] straight back out the far
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; but the farmers will put you to school.
[2:21:32] The farmer will have your car the farmer
[2:21:34] was build your house but you're running
[2:21:35] from the fleas and the bite say in the
[2:21:37] forest mosquito biting him and all kind
[2:21:39] of thing affecting him just before he
[2:21:40] get a breakthrough just before all hell
[2:21:43] seem to send and whip up all kind of
[2:21:45] thing to hinder you. You have to bust
[2:21:47] through that. Give the Lord a shout in
[2:21:48] the house.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; To the tutors
[2:21:56] responsible for the upbringing,
[2:21:58] discipline, education, the child's
[2:22:00] character. Tutor come like the mentor.
[2:22:03] In England, they will talk they will
[2:22:05] talk about a nanny. That's the word that
[2:22:06] we use. So therefore the tutor will be
[2:22:09] restrict would be responsible for
[2:22:12] restricting the child's life that the
[2:22:15] child could sit in order and be
[2:22:16] disciplined to learn the courses and to
[2:22:19] learn the work and to get the education
[2:22:21] that they need to be that type of a
[2:22:23] child.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; So when the father come and ask the
[2:22:29] tutor how is my son doing
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; how is my daughter doing
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; the father could this tutor could give a
[2:22:36] good report. Amen.
[2:22:39] I work in schools
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; and when exam time come I like to see
[2:22:42] that when the exam results come out some
[2:22:44] fellas is bad boy whole five years is
[2:22:47] bad boy
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; final year now so that the final time of
[2:22:51] badness when they come to the office
[2:22:53] they trembling you know because they
[2:22:54] know the results
[2:22:56] is fs
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; they have nothing to get
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; you understand I'm saying then so what
[2:23:01] I'm saying then all their badness is for
[2:23:03] five years afterwards he had a bad
[2:23:04] outside
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; no longer in school
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; but I'm saying you have to consider
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; rejecting short-term pleasure
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; for long-term gain
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; through discipline.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; There are many people going for
[2:23:18] short-term and this is what Esau end up
[2:23:20] doing. He come home, he hungry. He have
[2:23:23] the right to the birthright. He is the
[2:23:25] firstborn. He has a positional place and
[2:23:27] power.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; And his brother cook a good pot of
[2:23:31] lentils.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; He said hungry.
[2:23:35] He said birthright.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; Do you get that?
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; He sold out his inheritance. But the
[2:23:44] country
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; sold out his birthright
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; for pleasure
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; for a bowl of soup.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Lentil peas
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; soup
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; with pigtail in it.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; There's addition that we put inside that
[2:24:01] tast good
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; when you smell that pigtail.
[2:24:06] He despised the birth right
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; shortterm pleasure
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; short-term boost
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know if I read it the
[2:24:19] Bible talk about when he started with
[2:24:21] tears
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; he couldn't get it back
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; there are certain decisions God don't
[2:24:28] want you to make certain paths God don't
[2:24:30] want you to go because there is no
[2:24:31] getting back
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; that prodigal son got himself back.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; I will arise. I will say to my father,
[2:24:38] he got himself back.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; I'll read a scripture from Esther 2:7
[2:24:50] says, "And he brought up Hadassa talking
[2:24:52] about Morai.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; Esther his uncle's daughter, for she had
[2:24:55] neither father nor mother. And the maid
[2:24:58] was fear and beautiful whom Modi when
[2:25:00] her father and mother were dead took for
[2:25:02] his own daughter."
[2:25:03] So that's how we saw Esther as my
[2:25:05] daughter.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Esther 2:20 says, "Esther had not yet
[2:25:08] shown her kindred nor her people as
[2:25:12] Mordei had charged her.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; For Esther did the commandment of Mori
[2:25:17] like as when she was brought up with
[2:25:19] him."
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; So Esther was obeying instructions
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; from her tutor Mori.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Modi leave Esther after that and Esther
[2:25:30] get promoted to be king's wife.
[2:25:32] But when Hmon
[2:25:35] coming to kill the Jews and Morcai start
[2:25:39] to lament in front because listen a man
[2:25:43] get promoted, a man get big house, he
[2:25:45] have car, he have servants and all kind
[2:25:47] of thing but he can't handle Modai not
[2:25:48] bowing.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; That affecting his ego
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; he have ministry,
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; he had church,
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; he have everything
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; but boy not bowing by your God.
[2:26:01] Kill him.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Kill his people.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; Morai sent a word to Esther. You think
[2:26:07] you safe inside of there
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; because you the queen there will come
[2:26:10] for the people. And then Esther come to
[2:26:13] terms to herself. Let me fast and pray.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Fast with me. I will go into the
[2:26:20] presence of the king
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; without being called.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; And if I perish,
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; that is courage. I perish.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; Do you have courage this morning
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; to go be on you? Let me see if I can
[2:26:30] wrap up to go beyond yourself. Come on
[2:26:33] now. You have family you want to see
[2:26:34] delivered. Go be on yourself. Stop being
[2:26:36] so selfish. Come on, press your way.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Go further. She said, "If I perish, I
[2:26:43] perish."
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But she was dressed right.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; She was anointed right. She had the
[2:26:50] right motive and objective. And when the
[2:26:52] king saw her, he put out his scepter.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is Esther power for you?
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; Power to you.
[2:27:03] Hallelujah.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; So before Joseph was promoted, he was
[2:27:06] imprisoned.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; David anointed
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; and David still subject himself to the
[2:27:15] courts of Saul.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; Still play the harp and he know the
[2:27:18] anointing upon him.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:21] David
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; humble heart,
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; humble soul,
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; knowing that throne is his
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; the palace he's walking into that's is
[2:27:30] his
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; but you know how tough it was to David
[2:27:32] to get there
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; tutors
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; to shape your character
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; through correction discipline and Bible
[2:27:41] say all scripture is g by inspiration
[2:27:43] for God for correction
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; isn't that right
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; so governance is to protect your
[2:27:49] inheritance to make sure you have what
[2:27:52] you're supposed to have.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Get what you're supposed to
[2:27:55] get.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; Protect it from you.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because people could destroy
[2:28:00] themselves by accessing things. That's
[2:28:02] why all them lotto winners, you see what
[2:28:03] happen? They never earn it. They never
[2:28:06] achieve it. They buy a ticket standing
[2:28:08] in line. They stand in line to come in
[2:28:10] church
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; standing for lotto play and whatever
[2:28:13] thing
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; when they win it. So I remember I move
[2:28:16] over 11 until a man wash his car with I
[2:28:18] think was whiskey champagne.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; It had no water in the pipe. He buy a
[2:28:22] case of champagne and wash on his car.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; He thought the money was going done.
[2:28:26] When the money finished everybody laugh
[2:28:27] at him.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; Money is done. You know
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; because they didn't earn it they waste
[2:28:35] it.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; So sometimes God program may look like
[2:28:43] it's restrictive.
[2:28:45] It look like things are holding you back
[2:28:46] and they holding me back.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; But God is protecting you
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; from you.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; Could somebody say amen?
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; God is protecting you from yourself. God
[2:29:00] is protecting you from self-destruction.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; Look at Samson. Look at Samson. Gifted
[2:29:05] man,
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; anointed man, inspired man, working for
[2:29:09] God and killing and all kind of thing.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; But he lose.
[2:29:18] lost his eyes of foolishness.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; Lost his eyes
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; because he after a woman.
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; You give power prematurely
[2:29:35] and it destroys.
[2:29:39] I note a lot of these rich people they
[2:29:42] lose their children by suicide.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Why the children have car, house, land,
[2:29:48] money, no problem. But the children are
[2:29:50] not going through discipline or process.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; So afterwards they do drugs because they
[2:29:54] don't know what to do with the money
[2:29:55] again. They have the shoes they could
[2:29:56] buy. They have the plane. They have this
[2:29:57] that that everything. They don't need
[2:29:59] anything really.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; Afterwards the devil bring the anointing
[2:30:01] upon them. Hey, you know what I mean?
[2:30:04] All find yourself in all kind of
[2:30:05] stupidness. Eventually we take the self
[2:30:07] out the world.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; We can't I think brother Isaac talked
[2:30:13] about it
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; in the prayer meeting.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; Parents are not teaching their children
[2:30:18] for failure in the real world.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; They're setting them up
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; as if it's supposed to work out this way
[2:30:25] or that way.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; We have to prepare them for failure,
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; for challenges,
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; for the real world.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; And we can protect them. That's a
[2:30:34] mother's only hovering hovering over
[2:30:36] like helicopter parents.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; Like drone over the children.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Bible say shall this go shall a man
[2:30:47] leave his mother and father. Parenting
[2:30:49] is to bring the children to maturity
[2:30:51] that they could go on their own.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; And if you don't understand what I mean,
[2:30:56] see a chicken a mother hen.
[2:30:59] Chick just have your little chicken
[2:31:00] there. It's scratch. Feed them. Feed
[2:31:02] them. Feed them. Two, three days
[2:31:03] afterwards they decid to pick them.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; In other words, I show you what to pick
[2:31:07] up the food.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; Go and do go down and do likewise.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to go and go through with
[2:31:16] you all that. Go down and do likewise.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; I have all them chicks that morning
[2:31:20] owners grow on their own.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; We want a baby and baby. That's why God
[2:31:25] put the first man Adam there. Adam
[2:31:26] falling a perfect man. No bar, no risky,
[2:31:28] no rum, no mar nothing fall. God said
[2:31:31] not that happening again. You know start
[2:31:33] the process over now.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Birth and growth,
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; birth and process,
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; seed process,
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; fruit.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; If any man get fruit, I'm going to prune
[2:31:49] him.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; When you bear fruit,
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; see the big shares coming. Hey, hey,
[2:31:57] hey.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Now starting the beer. He come to prune
[2:32:01] you
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; to bring forth more fruit.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; He want much fruit. So don't say God
[2:32:06] don't prune me.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; Now this is part of the process
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; on your way to your inheritance.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; Let's see if we can wrap up here.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; So Samson had power
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; but he lacked discipline
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; and character. He broke his covenant
[2:32:23] with God.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; And he squandered his gift.
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; Saul,
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; he lacked obedience
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; and patience.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; And that is what brother Isaac brought
[2:32:34] out. And listen to the one read verse.
[2:32:38] This is from uh Hebrews 12. I'm going to
[2:32:40] wrap up. We shall come up please. Follow
[2:32:43] peace with all men and holiness. This is
[2:32:45] Hebrews 12:14. Without which no man
[2:32:47] shall see the Lord. looking diligently,
[2:32:50] lest any man fail of the grace of God.
[2:32:52] Least any root of bitterness bringing up
[2:32:54] trouble you, thereby many be defiled.
[2:32:56] Least there be any fornicator or profane
[2:32:58] person as Esau who for one morsel of
[2:33:01] meat sold his birthright. For you know
[2:33:04] how that afterward when he would have
[2:33:07] inherited the blessing, he was rejected.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; For he found no place of repentance,
[2:33:13] though he sought it carefully
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; with tears. Amen.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; So he despised his inheritance, his
[2:33:20] birthright for a temporary mean
[2:33:23] satisfaction,
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; immaturity,
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; immaturity
[2:33:28] want instant gratification,
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; instant pleasure,
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; maturity can wait
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; because you know God will give you the
[2:33:37] best.
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:40] So when loss, shame and destructions
[2:33:44] come to those who get inheritance before
[2:33:49] maturity. Let me see wrap up here now.
[2:33:51] Praise the Lord.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; But I'm talking about all skip that.
[2:34:01] Skip that.
[2:34:04] Notice what if the boy was a good boy.
[2:34:06] how the teacher would show over his
[2:34:07] chest. Walk up to the father say, "I am
[2:34:09] so glad, sir, to bring you the message
[2:34:11] of how your son is progressing. He's as
[2:34:13] smart as he can be. He's just like you.
[2:34:15] We will call him a chip over the block.
[2:34:17] He's exactly like you. He loves the same
[2:34:19] thing you love. He does the works just
[2:34:21] like you have done." That's the kind of
[2:34:23] church that the Holy Ghost likes to
[2:34:24] witness before God.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; But if that child did not obey and was
[2:34:28] not obedient child, it never was no more
[2:34:30] than a son. It remained a son yet had no
[2:34:34] inheritance. But when this boy if he
[2:34:36] come up that way did not become obedient
[2:34:38] did not have the action of his father
[2:34:40] did not try to carry out his father's
[2:34:41] business on the way his father did
[2:34:43] another brother had to take its place
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; so God is saying that son you he wayward
[2:34:49] what word and whatn not and end no net
[2:34:51] somebody else
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; will take that place and today if we try
[2:34:55] to take the church before God under
[2:34:57] common church creed or theology not the
[2:34:59] way Jesus took the church before the
[2:35:01] father god wants the church to be filled
[2:35:03] with the holy ghost doing the same works
[2:35:05] he did when he was here on earth. That's
[2:35:07] the kind of church that the teacher want
[2:35:09] to present before God. Now, if that
[2:35:11] child didn't obey and was not about the
[2:35:13] father's business, God would raise him
[2:35:15] up another son. Now, he is saying that
[2:35:18] for a purpose. We repeat it for a
[2:35:19] purpose because here where he's going.
[2:35:21] I'm going to finish up here now. Watch.
[2:35:23] And that's the way he's done. He raised
[2:35:25] up Luther, raised up Methodist, raised
[2:35:27] up Nazarene, raised up the Pentecostal.
[2:35:28] He will keep on raising and raising and
[2:35:31] raising until he gets one. Amen.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; So God ain't stopping because people
[2:35:36] need bribery message. No, he want the
[2:35:38] perfect church and he's going to have
[2:35:40] it.
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; God, brother, I hope to live to see that
[2:35:44] church when she rises in the power and
[2:35:46] the beauty of the resurrection. Oh, give
[2:35:48] the Lord a shout.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; So now the father sure proud of that
[2:35:55] son. You know what? when he gets to
[2:35:58] school in his training yet he might he
[2:36:01] might not be able to exercise all
[2:36:03] authority he hasn't got it yet he is
[2:36:06] still a son but he hasn't been placed
[2:36:09] and then if the son proved to be the
[2:36:10] right kind of son the father put him in
[2:36:13] a high place clothe him beautiful
[2:36:15] garment he had what they call an
[2:36:16] adoption of a son or placing of a son
[2:36:19] positionally what he was they had a
[2:36:21] ceremony and when the father said this
[2:36:23] is my son I adopt him or place him
[2:36:25] positionally If they had checks in those
[2:36:27] days, the son name on the check would
[2:36:29] just be good as the father
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; because he was placed. Now Jesus had
[2:36:35] proven to God he'd be right on a son.
[2:36:37] And then you know m transfiguration and
[2:36:39] then he said this here that's the same
[2:36:40] thing God will do to his sons here on
[2:36:42] earth someday. He will call you aside
[2:36:44] church if you only obey him and stay on
[2:36:47] the word and believe it. He will place
[2:36:49] here we go into the church before the
[2:36:51] coming of Christ before the coming. We
[2:36:54] can preach coming coming. But before
[2:36:56] that, we have to have this.
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; Before his coming, we have to have this.
[2:37:02] Here we go. Watch. He will place into
[2:37:05] the church. All the powers that Christ
[2:37:07] had in him will be in the church. All
[2:37:09] that God was, he poured into Jesus. All
[2:37:10] that Jesus was, he poured into the
[2:37:12] church. God wanted to work done, he sent
[2:37:14] into his son. The son wanted to work
[2:37:16] done, he sent into the church at that
[2:37:18] day. Because the same power was in
[2:37:20] Jehovah God rest in Jesus Christ. Here
[2:37:22] we go. And the same power that rest in
[2:37:24] Jesus Christ rest in placed sons in the
[2:37:28] body of Christ.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; We have to see that before we leave
[2:37:31] here.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; We are going up yonder and we see that
[2:37:33] here. You have no yonder. You're saying
[2:37:35] right here yonder until we see this.
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; This we have to say this is that
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; that the prophet spoke of
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; a power in the church.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; A power in you,
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; a power in me,
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; a power in us.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. If you count me to be a
[2:37:51] fan from this night on, that very same
[2:37:54] thing I'm speaking of will be done.
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; There will be a power put into the
[2:37:58] church. And now it's coming in that the
[2:38:00] Holy Spirit, here we go,
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; will so anoint the people till they will
[2:38:05] speak the word.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; And it will create itself right there.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; We haven't seen powers like that coming
[2:38:11] into the church now.
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:38:17] Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; So, as we close, let's talk about Jesus
[2:38:23] a little bit. Jesus, age 12, we know
[2:38:27] about my father's business. 12 to 30,
[2:38:30] Jesus going to the temple. Jesus is
[2:38:32] listening to the word. He's under
[2:38:33] tutors. He's under the word. He's
[2:38:36] learning his calling and everything
[2:38:38] else. And then what happened? Filled
[2:38:39] with the Holy Ghost at the bank of the
[2:38:41] Jordan River. Led by the spirit to
[2:38:43] where? To show off for Instagram to get
[2:38:45] pictures to put himself on papers to say
[2:38:47] I am Jesus the Messiah? No. led by the
[2:38:49] spirit into the wilderness to face
[2:38:50] Lucifer one-on-one.
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; Overcome the lust of the eyes, overcome
[2:38:55] the lust of the flesh,
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; overcome the pride of life,
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; get back to the temple and find the
[2:38:59] place where it is written, the spirit is
[2:39:01] now upon me
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; because he had anointed me
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; to bring good tidings.
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; So Jesus is now anointed with God.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; He just overcome the devil.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; Devil can't stop him now. Now he know he
[2:39:12] now getting started.
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; So God held back Jesus 18 years of
[2:39:16] silence. Give him a time when he must
[2:39:19] step forward. He couldn't go out
[2:39:21] prematurely. He went at the appointed
[2:39:23] time. John was so convinced. He said
[2:39:25] there is one standing among you.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; He going to baptize you with Holy Ghost
[2:39:29] and fire.
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; That one coming. He's coming. He's
[2:39:31] coming. John know he had introduced. He
[2:39:33] said he is here.
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know who it is yet, but he is
[2:39:35] here.
[2:39:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; And I say this morning, he is here.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Bam,
[2:39:44] lots of time where many of us
[2:39:46] Pentecostals has made a mistake and
[2:39:47] think, well, the Holy Ghost is poured
[2:39:48] upon me. Glory to God. That's all I have
[2:39:50] to have. No, you're just getting
[2:39:53] started.
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:57] &gt;&gt; You have gotten started.
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I spoke so hard against modern
[2:40:02] trend. Women cutting their hair, men
[2:40:04] carrying on wearing moral clothes and
[2:40:06] things. I get so much criticism over
[2:40:07] that. But what is it? I'm trying to save
[2:40:09] that church. I'm trying to get them up
[2:40:12] here to the word.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; All right, I'm closing.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; Galatians 6:1 says, "Brethren, if a man
[2:40:20] be overtaken of fault, you which are
[2:40:22] spiritual, restore such a one, here we
[2:40:24] go, in the spirit of meekness,
[2:40:27] considering thyself, least thou are also
[2:40:30] tempted. Bear ye one as burdens, so
[2:40:33] fulfill the law of Christ." If a man
[2:40:35] think himself to be something, when he's
[2:40:37] nothing, he deceive himself. But let
[2:40:39] every man prove his own work, then shall
[2:40:41] he have rejoicing in himself alone, not
[2:40:43] in another. For every man shall bear his
[2:40:46] own burden. Let him that is taught in
[2:40:49] the word, that is you, communicate unto
[2:40:53] him that teacheth in all good things. Be
[2:40:56] not deceived. God is not mocked. For
[2:40:59] whatsoever man, that shall he reap. For
[2:41:02] he that sweth his flesh shall reap of
[2:41:04] the flesh corruption. And he that sw to
[2:41:06] the spirit shall reap of the spirit
[2:41:08] everlasting life everlasting.
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; Let us not be weary in welloing for in
[2:41:13] due season we shall reap if we faint
[2:41:17] not.
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah.
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; We keep reading about Hebrews 13:7.
[2:41:23] Remember your leaders and superiors in
[2:41:26] authority for it is they who brought to
[2:41:29] you the word of God.
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. observe attentively and consider
[2:41:33] their man of living the outcome of their
[2:41:36] well spent lives and imitate their fate.
[2:41:40] Hebrews 13:17 I'm closing just two more
[2:41:43] scriptures. Obey them that have rule
[2:41:45] over you
[2:41:47] &gt;&gt; and submit yourselves for they watch for
[2:41:50] your souls and they must give an account
[2:41:52] that they may do it with joy not with
[2:41:54] grief for that is unprofitable for you.
[2:41:56] In the amplified, this says, "Obey your
[2:41:59] spiritual leaders and submit to them,
[2:42:02] continually recognizing their authority
[2:42:04] over you, for they are constantly
[2:42:06] keeping watch over your souls, guarding
[2:42:09] your spiritual welfare as men who will
[2:42:11] have to render an account of their trust
[2:42:13] and so on." Last scripture, do we want
[2:42:16] to play something, brother, Steven?
[2:42:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:24, Paul said, "Solute all
[2:42:20] them that have rule over you and all the
[2:42:23] saints."
[2:42:25] the amplified. Give our greetings to all
[2:42:26] your spiritual leaders and to all the
[2:42:29] saints, God consecrated believers. May
[2:42:32] God bless you saints of God. The ears
[2:42:35] must be under teachers and governors.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; All these self-style believers who want
[2:42:40] to just do their own thing.
[2:42:43] I want to put that correctly for you.
[2:42:47] When a centrist is about to sew that
[2:42:48] dress, she has a pattern.
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; The cloth is a material. Hallelujah.
[2:42:55] &gt;&gt; The pattern is what she's cutting from.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; She rest the pattern.
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; I begin to cut.
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; She's cutting that dress according to
[2:43:03] the pattern.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; What remains outside of the pattern is
[2:43:08] the remnant.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; You don't want to be that.
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; You want to be the one that is being
[2:43:14] cut.
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; Cut means you're cutting according to
[2:43:17] God's order,
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; God's plan.
[2:43:20] If you choose to just be the cloth and
[2:43:23] you want to remain as piece of the
[2:43:25] remnant of that cloth, that's your
[2:43:26] choice.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; But you have a choice. The foolish
[2:43:31] virgins, they do their own thing.
[2:43:34] The foolish virgins are self-willed.
[2:43:37] They going by their own feelings and
[2:43:38] emotion. They know they needed oil. They
[2:43:42] choose not to get any extra. When the
[2:43:44] cry came, the bride would come and go to
[2:43:46] meet him. They asked the wise, give us
[2:43:48] some of your oil. The wise said not so.
[2:43:51] The wise was wise tell them not so. All
[2:43:54] these years you have chance to get oil.
[2:43:55] You come to harass me for oil. No, it's
[2:43:57] time to go.
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; You can't get none of kindness. Wrong
[2:44:00] scripture.
[2:44:02] &gt;&gt; Don't quote that now. You have a
[2:44:04] problem.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; You had a chance to get the oil. You had
[2:44:08] a chance to pay the price. You had a

[3:05:04] time we want to close in a word of
[3:05:06] prayer and but I think we'll sing us as
[3:05:07] the usher come forward. Let's close in a
[3:05:09] word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we
[3:05:11] thank you for your visitation this
[3:05:13] morning by your word. And God is such
[3:05:16] something that was moving upon our
[3:05:18] hearts for a while now under tutors and
[3:05:21] governors. And when I saw it, it was
[3:05:24] such a a a sight to see is not what
[3:05:27] people think it to be, is what you have
[3:05:30] ordained. And must come through churches
[3:05:33] and governance. best part of your
[3:05:35] program in getting us to where we want
[3:05:37] where you want us to be and getting us
[3:05:40] to the place that you want us to be
[3:05:42] because you said power apart from
[3:05:44] character is satanic but power with
[3:05:46] character is fit to rule and if you have
[3:05:49] to endure this with power it means that
[3:05:51] you have to have us in character and
[3:05:53] character is not a gift character is a
[3:05:55] victory. So that means we have to go
[3:05:57] through stuff, go through things that
[3:05:59] would hone us and shape us and mold us
[3:06:02] and that that we could reflect you and
[3:06:04] that you could trust us with your
[3:06:05] presence and power. So as your people go
[3:06:07] to their homes, may they meditate and
[3:06:09] think on these things. I ask in Jesus
[3:06:12] name I commit their lives into their
[3:06:13] hands the entire church from the
[3:06:15] eldership straight down. Oh God to each
[3:06:18] one be with them in a special way. Bless
[3:06:20] the upcoming Wednesday service. Bless
[3:06:22] the Friday Zoom meeting. Bless the
[3:06:24] three-day prayer and fast Thursday,
[3:06:25] Friday, Saturday, and bless the special
[3:06:27] services coming Sunday. In Jesus name I
[3:06:29] ask it. Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord.
[3:06:32] And remember to invite someone out.
[3:06:34] Amen. Praise God. The song I think Jesus
[3:06:37] sing last. We
[3:06:40] must work
[3:06:43] while it is day
[3:06:47] spreading the word of God as we walk the
[3:06:53] narrow way
[3:06:57] willing
