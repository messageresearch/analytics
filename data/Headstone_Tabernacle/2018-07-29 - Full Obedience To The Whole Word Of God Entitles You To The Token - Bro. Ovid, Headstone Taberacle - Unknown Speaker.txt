blessing welcome to the desolate Abenaki brazen him of the Lord amen and amen we'll be looking forward for three time this morning in the Lord when a time last week to recognizing your D on this message and that was a love letter LeBron on being a messenger to send you a message you're the brain message come in to you so this morning we see what Lord will do and I know I guess many of you would have heard about this eclipse and I was speaking about a Gabriel stuck initiate something with me I want to share with you considering that this morning was the longest Blood Moon the special Blood Moon of July 27 the Eclipse that we just witnessed in is the second total lunar eclipse of 2018 totality lasted 103 minutes making it the longest eclipse of the 21st century total lunar eclipses occur at full moon when the moon shadow of the earth the world is projected on the moon the longest eclipse of the century 1:03 minutes which is the number 13 again which indeed we first the Revelation chapter 13 doing the total lunar eclipse the Sun did it and Moon line up in space as for war the greatest battle ever fought light versus darkness the Prophet said and the great message Shalom the world is in one of the most chaotic times of darkness that it ever stood in there's this red blood lunar eclipse speaks of total complete apostasy the church has gone into and this is where you know God has her to bring back that restoration anointing because the church fell away demon activity came into the church by preachers and men and on all these kind of things and crushed the church and drive it right on into darkness and Gotha to raise up looter a Catholic there was everybody was wiped out almost gone after going to Catholic Church a final man could imagine that God had to go into the Catholic Church the final man looking for breakthrough and from luta and Luther was a protest n't and that God was restoring to luta then Wesley then Pentecost and then goes on a prophet to gather all the word together that it can have a bright in the last days see we're not here to have church we are here to become bright it's two different things all together you could go to us anywhere today but this is different this is if you want to become bright and you can only come bright by his word so you don't come here to hear nice things and I'm floor everything to hear you come here to hear the word isn't that right so this will glue this with this red blood lunar eclipse speaks of total complete apostasy the church is gone and the message of Malachi 4 has been completely turned on by many of his followers however all these eclipses that occur every year a special signs that God showing us kind to remind his bride that in spite of gross darkness comedy earth and the people he the gritty over shallow is here to make his worth more positive in the midst of this great chaotic time and all the distress of the nation's his says he says to his bride Shalom my beloved Brian arise and shine for the glory of the Lord has come upon you peace be on to you I'm coming to take you home and to judge this sinful world like in said in Isaiah the morning comet and the night also I'm Wendy before the morning star comes out the darkness come first and then the mornings as the morning star come out it's not right so you're gonna get that the light first and then darkness gonna strike the will after Amen the moon turning red is very significant science is that whenever the sunlight passes through the atmosphere the air molecules filter different types of light for instant blues and purples are more easily scattered since they have a shorter we've linked while red and orange which have a longer wavelength can more easily passed your atmosphere they get bent redirected onto the moon service as we all know the profit message the color red represent perfect love anything I had a beginning has an end its door sting with not have any beginning has an end husband land and did you have a think of that gourd great master in what Isabella random in the skies we see like seven spirits of God red perfect love this home you must be born again and when that Great Spirit of God which is love God was like a great rainbow we would imagine when he looks like he looks like the rainbow dam spirits the perfect spirit of love red blue the poof experian of fellowship just all those proof experience and when they begin to cognizant coming down they come down all the way from a gap all of the feel your love and don't a lust and on to the lowest this great forerunner has gone before us making a way he become from spirit the great fountains of the rainbow of God who had no beginning no no end he was forever God this ray of life went thought it was a ray of love that's the main one read the spiritual application of this super blood moon is that in the midst of the total blackout as the church is feeling to shine and as everything is literally feeling in the earth God's perfect love it's glowing shining true a bride indeed charity never feel it this speaks of the great victory in the love divine that is no taking place in the bride right when the love of many is Watson coal for he said from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride of vision to his word and true them here we go and by them will be fulfill all that has been promised for his word in the Virgin who knows no man man creeps isn't that right god bless you but a Gabriel is so please go we appreciate that this morning blessed be the name of the Lord oh praise the Lord 11 this morning we tango to be here is always a blessing privilege to be here they gather around the word the word is God and the devil is still a liar every time he's open his mouth this wood could transform you this would have power and weight a scripture in prayer meeting on Tuesday about a man who died and it was about a barium and then some bandits or robbers was coming by and they just pitch him over into the sea falco of elijah elijah and when what happened the man jump up and come back up to life and stand up on his feet praise God because the quickening power was still on Elijah bones there was hustling to throw the man o bring his cup of the quickening power wasn't Elijah bones and you see all these courts we have here all these wood we have yet he's not quitting them power inside of that God take away our prophet but that quick them power is in the world it could transform you it could heal you it could deliver you it could deliver you could make the plans around you or glory no God hallelujah may be seated you I don't know they won't destroy your life the devil is against every marriage every poem every family you know what I

prophecy say that there'll be lukewarm and will be cold unform 'el and rich and have need of nothing I know how this has had a big shot some people taking it easy and rocking back in the church chair thinking everything will be nice and that time darkness just ease in ease and reason you don't see like darkness like the spirit that get down in Egypt darkness coming over your feet coming to your house coming through the back doors that you open we want to shut them back doors toss them Devils out make no place for the devil that's what this is about [Music] [Applause] though I can't repay

father may come on a might all in our midst a night and speak to us through your word bless the reading of the word miss the hairs of the world and in this meeting may you be glorified in Jesus and we ask it amen amen god bless that we want to turn the tree portion scriptures this morning Habakkuk chapter two while I read from verse one to four Filipinas chapter two we want to read from verse five to twelve and he was five one verse was eat praise God ibaka chapter to read in verse one to four you have it say Amen I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower I will watch to see what he will see unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that reads it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end I shall speak and not lie do it Terry wait for it because it will surely come and it will not tarry behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the josh i live by his feet we turn to Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 this is a great scripture a beautiful scripture let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who been in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant it was me in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross the wherefore God also had highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father and he won't and wherefore my beloved as he have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling and one verse in Hebrews chapter 5 verse 8 the door he will a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered may God bless the world and greetings to those connected as an Internet may God bless you may be seated oh praise God amen so god bless you and welcome at our Sunday feast where we feast around the Word of God yes so sit down buckle your belt we're in for a ride please God have a title this morning full obedience to the whole Word of God entitle you to the token that's the title follow billions to the whole Word of God and title you to the token another subject godswood calls for total separation from all unbelief that's what the word calls for that's not the pastor or the church that's what God calls for and have an inspiration catch the vision and cope with the word that's the inspiration I have catch the vision and cope with the word okay and this is brother Branham he's speaking about from it is not idea not afraid he's talking about have you any bread among you we have a boy here a few loaves and fishes about five loaves and two fishes or something like that he's not bring them here now if you notice okay if you notice in order to do something Jesus takes something to do something with now in order to bring faith in this building tonight for healing there we go Jesus has to take something to do something with the first thing else to get is to get somebody here that's got faith to be healed just one somebody here that wonder if I were just one somebody want deliverance just one somebody wanna brick you just one somebody want to go pass themselves just one he has to get to get somebody here that's got faith to be healed that will and that will strike into the audience so what are you saying this one person is like a match now when that one person breakout is like a it just light up the audience you ever sit in the service I know one person give a good praise of God and then it says like that because something's happening they broke into the supernatural the broken already mentioned all together get the break inside not any mention here this morning and the person makes you don't even know but you break in there cause a hole rupture inside of this place it takes one person to make a difference it takes one person to light up the place you could be that one person this morning the set your ordinary you are son of God you are daughter of God don't set yet like we don't know who you are we know you are son maybe you don't know but we know you are son we know you a daughter of God we know God perfect inside your soul let's continue I noticed last evening when the man that was blind was brought up to the platform and receive his sight that struck fire right away the Deaf woman that come while I was yet holding a hand and asking the IVA to leave her she began to quiver all over she said I can hear you I can hear you I'm quickly extract fire and by the time I was leaving the whole building seemed to be illuminated with God's presence so that is why you come not to just sit you come to participate you come to see when they log on to speak to you and respond because if you don't respond you're messy healing your mission deliverance your mister blessing your mr. Brett row [Music] one time the Prophet was spoken to somebody and they take too long to respond he said that's best the healing they have to respond it's God talking to you or cast a vision if you think is a man here talking is God talking to you cast a fish and you know what a gift is I give this to get out of the way so if he said better or whatever gift you have a gift instead get out of the way if I get out of the way who's in the way yeah I'm a man just like you I born in sin shape me iniquity but a gift is to get out of the way and if the man behind the pulpit gets all to wait and who's speaking who's inspiring who is pump in the world who is shaking is out there who's trying to set your soul on fire it's not the man so if you're looking at the man you in the flesh you natural you can begin a fight with ye I gotta fight with this one you in the natural you have nothing to get because those in the flesh cannot please God it's only those with faith can please God [Music] glory hallelujah glory no God behind this desk I'm not your friend [Applause] [Music] did you get that behind his desk I am NOT your friend [Music] behind his desk I'm Cosmo trees to you Oh glory to God amen the Jesus you may be seated taken what Fiat the blind man had or what faith the woman had I was deaf and started with that building feet see what I mean he takes something to do something with now in order for him to get something somebody has to surrender something and that's the problem people don't want to give up they come like you in your home on your marriage on your family or as parents you do what you know maybe I know what your mother used to do and your father said one day will you do into to your children you know time come but is that the best way for it before I show you a better way a more excellent way there is always a better way to do things so if you keep into yourself and your shame nobody and what kind of thing like that how you get help when all you know is what you have always known there is no new mix they see from the bush and your bushwhack excuse the expression of all you know is in the bush you don't act like from the bush that's all you know but you get to learn Jesus had to learn we read the scripture he learned obedience so we have born obedience we have to learn it easy so I expect you to learn nothing so we were assuming anything amen assistant pastor we are human nothing inside of here now we have pressed the reset button we checking your one by one family by family man by man okay the Lord has shouta feel I feel the anointing and SATA here nobody hiding [Applause] you know what I come from right go to Joshua when we fight him so no man shall give the stand before you all the piece of light and they fightin and all of a sudden started get defeated just to see something wrong something is wrong and they camp we're not supposed to have this yes no we had to get plaster I have dr. Orly can be fightin no cut no bruise we just wiping them people all of a sudden man game kill and my game ended what is wrong he says ha to have sin in the camp get the finest out he's a tribe by tribe family by family man by man we're gonna stretch it out we got to find it out I'll be going to wash it out because God told me victory on top of it [Applause] [Music] all glories of God hallelujah and they form the family and the family man my name it can i what a mean he can hide them I don't cool wedge among his stuffy I didn't stuff this told him his entire family hallelujah done when they went back to victory after that did anybody send and go back to victory deal with the unbelief and go back to victory sinners unbelief and God call it a total separation from all unbelief you have to believe God ahead of the doctor you have to believe God ahead of your mother yeah I believe God ahead of your father brother my husband you believe God talk about when it came to the fullness of believing because even though God tells Abraham to Sarah II another hey guy I know he arises because it isn't fully belief and he yields his wife interpretation of how this thing supposed to happen so we don't need somebody's interpretation of whole dynamics is to strike this balance toward promise dynamics I am looking for it Luther had mechanics and dynamics Wesley as mechanics and dynamics the Pentecostal Messiah manage we have courts for know a nice explanation and revelation and inspiration but we are promised can't you forget that pray don't you ever forget that we are promised dynamics to our mechanics we are promised the spirit upon the word that's our promise no no Sid no more stock judge member but the revived saint of God the pendulum I revived son of God God [Applause] want you to be a independent powerhouse self-powered out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water not somebody else belly your belly [Applause] [Music] [Applause] inside inside blessed is the man that walketh mother comes to them godly not melena we have sinners beset in the cinema scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted not floating on the water acted his fruit shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper that's my promise to be planted then living waters no man come movement no pop good movement nor demon could movement but thank you nobody could have brutal idle or hot panted give us a liar this morning I trust this morning taking off of your mind that the shadows of your heart that the over your spirit [Music] [Applause] so Jesus farm said a little boy hottest her in this lunch Oh a little dad the lunch a little boy hand was very much he could only partially feed himself box but once placed in the hands of Jesus it fed 5000 now maybe your fear to make me not very much but if what little feet you got you put it in his hands it might cause a revival the breakout you say in Chicago he'll what's it you have could cause a revival the record and headstone tabernacle and light under the pants of those that death and dying or glory knows what my wand equipment power to fire fire fire I assured the people you know go to the cemetery go somewhere else go to the Catholic Church go and sit down on what that I come to that my god I come in I was on a horse Anna not to me blessed is he that cometh I come to people and I took a young woman just to find it is the rising of the Sun it is the rising of the Sun we see in Jesus you seen a light he was dead three days but he's no raise the angel tell me to tell you you say he is not here in that savolta he is raised from the dead [Applause] we'll be seated oh let's go that's okay that's okay this is the place amid noise nor Norris nor God wherever God is there is noise we want to break the silence of the seventh seal because of life under there I went that seal of life when I seen of my brakes don't be so ten that we praise Him they'll be worshiping when Nazi love life [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the question is are your Christian and you cannot be a Christian until you have received Christ Christ in you I'm taking my time tonight don't think I'm worried and know taking my time next time I come into church I wanted to bring a notebook and pen we were started take some notes now many people say I will go to heaven because my faith tells me so I belong to church and my feet trust me that I'm all right now I will even agrees of God to but look no matter what your faith is you are not going to be judged by your feet you're going to be judged by your works so the confession I believe brother Branham there is a conversion of it then too far from the Apostles Creed I believe the Bible never said he'd ever believed and trembles too so you have too far from what he believes so it's not a matter of what a confession you believe is what your faith brought you into the activity of works the proof is really the fact because your faith is expressed by by your works so these are a poor consent this is an active living fate catch the vision because when Abraham taught is his hip make him step out from his country come out from among his people and walk among a new people seeking a city whose maker and builder is God that's what it does it brings you all to comfort zone and bring you all the butcher a custom wind it breaks that circle that has kept you bound for all these years because you see like Samson a possibility do you get it catch the vision Samson caught something yes he paid a price yes the fool by Delilah yes he was in sin yes he was in prison but when he caught the vision with our eyes did you hear that he had no eyes I see a vision and the vision he had make him say once more Lord I see a possibility I know the anointing I know that power to come back upon me I'm down in the dumps where I know because I tasted it before [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yesterday before Jesus didn't come this only seal you become to redeem you and to redeem you is to bring you back the way you were before it means you had a position before and God bringing you back to that super consciousness she put awareness of your sonship of the blood ship of your inheritance we are going back to that oh my you will be seated since God image and likeness telling again even you think you're taking that you take part taking natural Satan coming courtesan Satan was the cherubim that was kicked off in heaven telomere I'm told on God's image in the camera Eden which was Adam and his wife Eve you think or taken that back so what purpose in his heart I'm gonna bring back that image I like this person here [Music] [Applause] my god or glowing Akagi may be seated so call that was to introduce a second atom which was Jesus Christ he was the second atom to prove to the devil he prefers atom a bigger next one and Q dot next one to the seed of that next one and I seed shall possess the gates of the enemy she that second atom I'll restore the hauler she that second atom I'll release the spirit to bring the bass and big manases the season-ending left [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is in the building [Applause] maybe season so you're not gonna be judged by your feet if you judge by your works are you ready and when you die that does not change your spirit this is deep I know you're here already but you gotta hear the game until it strike you until I catch the vision you have to be changed because of me like the devil here you'll be me like the devil over there so you wouldn't make it so quiet no because the truth and the truth will set you free you have to be corrected here once a pastor blood there's no correction there's nothing to change I hope this sticks now let's continue that does not change your spirit it only changes a dwelling place it only changes houses for you and if you die in your sins you go to a woods habitation that you are living in now if you die in Christ you shall be with Christ for he is the way continue I stayed the other day watching my mother me holding her on my arm I helped my dad a little bit before that and watch him go I have seen them come to the end of the road who taught that they were really alright they say brother Branham who if I could only have live a little longer he said to leave them and remember that doesn't change the soul it only changes its dwelling place if you see that something within you if you see that something within you is making you act that way and feel that way like you ought not to feel repent this morning with your friend your knowing inside is not right repent repent in your heart right now repent sin Lord change me I I can't leave this way my attitude towards my husband my attitude was my wife my original was my children my attitude towards others I cannot go that way I have to change now is the time to change he alone catch angel he was changed by the Holy Ghost you don't have to be like that your miserable person recognized in your dance message you were saying remember right between those CEOs come forth six seal 144,000 chosen and called between the sixth and seventh trumpet version he let them appears exactly nine with the sixth seal but mostly lights are going to the Jews the core 144,000 with the

showing one thing that man when you die when you leave this world your nature doesn't change if you are lying now you'll be a liar if you're hot-headed here you'll be hot-headed here if your daughter here you'll be a daughter dear men and woman is trying to shake yourself and examine yourself and see where we are standing for death does not change this is serious this is not light stuff top my Moses and Elijah go on for two thousand years more than for 2500 years electrify ever since almost 2500 years is like argon and Mozambique all they return with the same nature and to the same thing or chlorine Oh God that's why we have to be like Jesus your nature dies and this nature comes in that is what you come here for if that is not what you come before you come for the wrong thing they're

thing afterwards you live what is for you is for you what God ordained nobody nobody no man on earth could take obey what God has predestinated and ordained for your life your blessing could be delayed but not denied so don't ever take it curse of like and not gonna be blessed you will be blessed he told Abraham feeling the spirit now [Applause] you know I feel enough here listen use about obedience is about full obedience after 25 years waiting for this child 25 year the testimony but I Rajkumar said listen testifying all over that I will have a son to this old woman named Sarah

speed up donkey let me know we've looked at them all today looking like going I gonna win I offer this alive but Abraham in the spirit abraham ridin ridin his donkey or horse whatever we go in with a camel or whatever it is and course at this mom 1000 glory to God even Buddhist monk and he tell them fellas he tell them in the wrong and I on the lap we going up and I'm glad we coming back down he

growing up and becoming down climb up the mountain find a big sky Barack his son sonship it he says daddy I see the would a city fire but where is he sacrifice those are the words cerebral God will

was at the street level he wasn't in that vision level so when fission broke up on Abraham shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do because the elect have a vision it has to have a bigger picture presented to you because of who you are the Lord you should show them that this is not for every everybody this is for the elect that's why the angel came to Abraham to speak to him what was supposed to happen things that are to be [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh glory no fur this is what we talking about one skip this I reckon that the present suffering of this world it's not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in the sea you can't even compare it what God wants to bless you with question answers if the church is saved even though she does not go in the rapture I believe you're taught she must go to the tradition for purifying but what about these that are dead how would it be purified answer Nirvana the bride taught need no purification she's already purified and those that are dead back there they never received the light that these church has received they live under the justification sonification so far like that they live to the light of the age maybe in a way they suffered whatever they went through and the persecutions but now here we go in this rapture in time she's called in prophecy a time he's gonna rupture in time they will have to come a time now that this bride he meant Church that reject the head part of the bride will have to suffer for her rejection so he's talking about in this message the church people in this message that reject the head part which is a headstone and the thunders capped the pyramid so ratandas is the headstone that comes in two part revelation and manifestation they fight the revelation because it is the word but it will be coming a manifestation he said what we see should make a church not from it a revival that we will find them everywhere saying the seven promise is manifested that's bright promise [Applause] thus the Tumnus mean that my bedroom then the Tumnus is this perimeter is capped by the seven thunders then the Tungus is the capstone itself it's the capstone revelation of some man no it's the captain revelation of Jesus Christ you know what I said it's the capstone final revelation of Jesus Christ the stone that the builders fusion come upon you as the headstone of the corner and it's an Lord's to him and his marvelous in our hands this is the thing that the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it I see a vision I see the headstone I see the stone cut out without hands of man no minister Association could bring down that stone no Cooper man to bring the new soul no special gifted ministry a stone cut off with all the hands a man crisis that stone I'm gonna come to that bride and smite the image for glory Decorah the boy peace system [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah I Daniel saw that stone cut out you know the hands of man is the common of the stone to finish the Gentile dispensation it's the coming of the stone to bring the bride anointing is the coming of the stone the joseon power [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you may be seated Jesus talk you you really think things will continue normal normal normal Jesus described it as the beginning of Sorrows wars and rumors of wars quits and tigress places signs in the heavens just like that Eclipse talk about the beginning of Sorrows and the bride is that you have so no because you're in travails to bring Fort Hope glory have got a woman when she was in travail she's in sorrow but when she have joy when a man child is born so right now you're pregnant with Claudia the pregnant with Messiah the pregnant with Jesus you have a promise to produce Messiah or chlorine Oh God hallelujah glory to God and he's calling on you to fool you'll be in a word determined full obedience the what to say you supposed you'll have to suffer because of a rejection because a customer was made man paid the name back there like his made plain to you you see is so plain you have done all these years and examples the seams open the churches laid out everything else is just a plain you can't miss it praise God and then if you fully reject it there's only one thing to do suffer fear so all those who reject the fullness of the wood they will pay the price of the tribulation Bible said it is really very nicely when that which is perfect is come then that person part is done away with so your tolerated that which is in part until that which is perfect when profession comes the C standard no I want to be a man or not I want a bigger Amen on that from you when perfection comes that is the standard beautiful perfect perfection didn't Saturn earth we know that my perfect nose and perfect movie not talking about that but fetching the spirit God is perfect before there was an earth before there was a moon it was perfection the rainbow so we have to go back to that perfection which is the rainbow or give the Lord a show so your human spirit will be replaced by the hallelujah that is making me excited [Applause] you're taking out your daughter and putting fit taking out your visa put them foot you taking in your ignorance I put the knowledge but in temperance but in patience but then puffiness but then brotherly kindness the stature of a perfect man the image and likeness of God restored more atoms on the earth [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh God of mercy the Lord Himself has already descended with the title deed with a shout oh my let me season we don't we don't have to send for the Lord the Lord already descended the progress of the angel orders on the earth now fixing things are all for his coming he is fixing you today he's fixing the service he is in the service that's an angel oh he's here [Applause] [Music] Oh glory to God hallelujah may be seated my god question after the bride is ruptured will any of the foolish version be saved or will they all be lost answer no everything will be finished for the Gentile church when the bride is ticking on the earth the Spirit of God leaves the it he that has filthiest filthy still he is righteous righteous still he is holy as holy still in other words essentially becomes smoky Christ leaves the century his military work is over the rapture comes he leaves from the century he calls fought and takes the book of redemption and claims everything that he has redeemed let's continue will the foolish religion be saved no whatever happens happens now after that time she will have to go to the tribulation the reason it is she has rejected the atonement in his fullness she is a believer a professed believer but she will have to go to the tribulation period because she didn't accept the fullness of the world or did the Lord a shout we can't go halfway it makes no sense you have to go all the way or glory to God you have to accept the fullness of the atonement all seven six or seven thunders all seven mysteries such a public man continually goes person of Christ or glory living world living Christ now that's a full-body word or chlorine of God how do you accept it [Applause] [Music] based on through deliverance but around when the church is away from its principles it can never seal the scenes well they've got to stay together be unified you've got to be in one hand I wanna record see you have to go beyond this video see beyond this property there's so many people see in just you know Amanda saying it ain't but what is the power behind it what is the emotion and inspiration we have you're reaching we make up these things always put together who inspiring it put them together but I'm talking about that we can see the plainest of God the message that may reveal that we can see the plainness of God how to conduct ourselves have a right the vision make it plain that he really walks newly not anybody he that we let me run write the vision make it plain that's what we here doing this morning when you see it top division you don't work with it you run with it it put you into action the vision Abraham God put him into action what about Elijah and Elijah when he likes a court division already lighted it was a drop the mantle on that young man and pull it off God told him that man replacing him but look what God did to get my touch and pull it off [Music] what if you give me whole thing then sit back and relax and honestly still with the oxen hunting oximetry annoying to not know when god topol-m pull it off you can't handle ten dollars reward give you a hundred you look about Tosun and the kite one hundred look at one hundred thousand five hundred ten thousand so gonna drop it and see way do with it well give you I tend to see if you're worthy of the hundred quad chop the mantel on the light shaft and then pull it off and then something a young man said wait a minute I'm coming about Jon Snow kisses mother and father and bond EOCs bandha stop them everything back to that like seven stare he says still where are you see in here it's efficient this is profit telling on next month's the yellow you know even listening to that because efficient

my soul to the Lord a shock in the house he saw something beyond what Elijah had you may be seated if you didn't see it he could have never said abortion you'll say I want what you have thank you Lord

one press M or Chloe that God you nobody controlling you you create any atmosphere to live in your own world or tell the Lord of prayers [Applause] let's continue we gotta be one on one accord or we never serve God as people unless mean one other one Accord the stand by the principles of the Bible and the things that God has said that was right you must always stand by them I hope I never announced this morning back there that it kind of come to my mind that the people seemingly I get to know me from deliverance you don't hear much about that any message yet people going to church and getting more knowledge and information but their need for deliverance yes the liver and some your habits for the attitude from your wisdom different demons cast out you don't know what kind of spirits upon your life Oh glow and what spirits haunting you and following you well glory to God let's continue here this little spot now that the people see me again from deliverance it seems to be something like the people seen it so they just push it to one side or God can do it but I study attitude I don't know if butter on the answer victorious yesterday yesterday the dog says okay okay man but I want to salute them they walk they coming up the corner on Tuesday night and they have two small children I told him to zest a brandy I see you remind him and me and I we were packing our children without

everything that he has needed and caught cause a man to be a preacher he puts something in him to preach with if he calling to be a teacher he puts something them to teach with if he calls a meme to be a prophet he puts something in him to see visions and to be a prophet God always completely eclipses man isn't that right praise God and if you are Christian God don't make half recursions God make complete Christians go to make are free preachers but preachers can be halfway and God meets his children Christians and sometime they are halfway Christians which that God's intention for them to be that way it's they're always got mixed up with the plan of God for their lives so there's a plan of God for your life and you have your plans and your plans has conflict with God's plan so then you're all messed up because you're fighting God but the script already Jesus humbled himself and become obedient you can become obedient until you begin to humble yourself come and push back to me somebody

and bunch of Philistine well glory they're going to do only way some your road is cut out for you you know Samson couldn't get there nor away hallelujah so even on one side it look like eel Island this happened that happened but all things work together for good to them that love the Lord to them who had he told give the Lord a shout if you know it's working together for your good every trial every sickness every ambition every situation is he always got mixed up with the plan of God for their life and that's what makes them the way they are gonna want them to be halfway Christians or halfway preachers compromising on either side he wants them completely stand in the breach now Moses God made him a company profit for completely liberals and more they was completely surrendered into the hands of God and that's the reason he was what he was he was so completely God till God could trust him anyway I wonder this morning as Christians if we have yield our own will and yielded ourselves so completely to God till God can trust us the place yes put us I wonder this morning or myself if I could be so heated to God he's talking with himself if I could be so even to God your God could trust me could trust but I never could trust our trustee board our Deacon board all members of our church we all have a place and we got a duty the minister has got a place to stand and preach the unsearchable riches of Christ without compromising if he is called to be a preacher he wouldn't steal one thing for a person he was called to be a preacher and a member of the church if he's caught to be a member of this sitting group then he would not compromise if the Church believes we should not gamble then member should never touch a deck of cards we don't believe in drinking he should instead complete home drinking we don't believe in gambling or smoking and so on if we will complete the level of stress into his hands then go and live in us Christ hope of glory and when one member we're talking is another member you know that you're all you're commanded death to pray for one another not talk about one another now see somebody's thinking about this thinking this thinking no pick them up create for them not not not telling ministry with elimination the telling ministry to tell nobody don't tell nobody and afterwards ap health it they pay the price for not seeing not talking and you're just as guilty because you're an evil in the wrong things it will keep silent I'd have a knowledge of sinner or whatever kind think they enable in that person and what they're doing some time parents enable their children and do wrong things it is so sad some time parents actually unable to destroy their own children any blows please gone so when one member we're talking against another member you know that's wrong you command it to pray for one another not to talk against one other but alone one another if someone is don't let's pick him up help him now that makes us a unified group of believers when we don't obey that we don't obey God we displease God therefore our church or people kind of prosper I just kind of go on as a just unified together now what we don't want to have Richard wanna be a real church or no church at all want to be real Christians or no questions at all we won't talk deliverance from our habits from our sins for more evil thinking for more evil doing for more negligence whatever we have done we want total deliverance so when the people come into this church to be prayed for there will be this little group maybe not over 100 sitting here completely hands of God and when we breathe God will hear from heaven and the only way we can do that is unified our hearts together with brotherly love or be the offices of the church and the pastor the pastor obey God then God works to the pastor to the board known to the church and they all together one unit to the kingdom of God Fira wanted to agree said Moses you can go but leave your
