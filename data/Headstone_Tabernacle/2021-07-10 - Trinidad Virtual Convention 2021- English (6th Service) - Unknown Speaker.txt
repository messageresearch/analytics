heart for this convention and making me bring greetings to the body of christ around the world that will be listening to this tape and i just want to thank you very much and the saints as well for making it possible that all of us could at least be in his presence to hear the words of eternal life shall we bother our heads in prayer this moment heavenly father we bless your name and thank you for your grace and mercy your bridal of jesus christ around the world this moment lord through the inspiration you've lit upon the heart of your son your servant our dear brother theophilus who has endeavored lord to put this together in virtual form that your children will hear the word scripture says that blessed are those who hear and those who read and so we want to thank you for the ears you've given us to be able to hear and discern what the spirit of god is saying to your body your children but you come through the word anointed and bless us all this hour in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen so our personal brother especially upon him is for us to speak on the dispensation of another ephesians and just uh my name is john duncan passing the church here in mississauga canada here in the province of ontario uh message is our church name is grace and truth message tabernacle i've been pastoring this local church for close to 20 years now and so happen to meet your pastor by the grace of god and it's an honor for me to bring greetings from my family my dear wife the church here the elders as we just approached in a short while my greetings for you all uh in the name of the lord jesus christ as we are all pressing on this battle uh to make it a home and so in uh the scriptures that we want to read today ephesians 1 3 5 2. jesus 1 3 to 5 is the blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him having predestinated us onto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will i read ephesians also 4 1-7 i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation whereby you are called with all loneliness meekness with long suffering forbidden one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one body one spirit even as you are calling one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of you uh every one of us is giving grace according to the measure of the gifts of christ and he gave some apostles and some prophets some evangelists and pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints and for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ and so because we are uh speaking on another ephesians the dispensation that we are coming in though we're living in the nordician church age which is the final age of all ages the age of lukewarmness the age of total blackout god is looking at this church coming back into his first love just like the first church had in ephesus and uh the prophet told us in the message paradox for 61 he said the ephesus now we find the same thing that old testament i think that this book of joshua fits a fitting word for it will be that the book of ephesus of the old testament so the book of ephesians of the old testament will be a good thing to title this book of joshua because it certainly fits and it goes on to say that we find that joshua also represents the aid of grace or some proposition that it could not exist in the same time that the law was in existence in other words joshua is typing grace where moses was typing the law and the two of them could not be in his existence at the same time one has to go for the other one will have to come in in paragraph 66 it says therefore was joshua representing grace was right along with the law but could not be enforced as long as the law was in his proper place and so we want to just take a few uh thoughts as to how joshua the ministry is typing the ephesian church of our time just as the ages have gone on uh they've all brought in their catechisms and their everything and they run their time but we have entered into another age again where the headstone itself is coming down with the shoutings of grace in our time we know the shout is the message of the hour and it was the more joshua's time that we had a word of shout for the first time and so let's go into that for a second as we enter into this ephesians typing joshua in our time here today and so we realized that when moses had to first of all depart this here to go the scriptures already told us that joshua was a faithful minister to the ministry of moses and that is what requires in this end time as we are crossing over faithful ministers ministers like joshua who are standing with the word of god and when moses crossed over it was god that came and spoke to joshua and gave him a ministry and told him it says that moses my seventh is gone but i've chosen you be not be discouraged be encouraged stay with the word if you want to prosper i want to bless you don't turn to the left don't turn to the right stay with the word as i was with moses i will be with you in other words though the dispensation seems to change from law to grace the message which god brought cannot be uh substituted for any other thing joshua had to stay in the same context of the word the ephesian church had to do the same thing and as joshua was about to cross over many of the uh unbelievers the med believers the borderline believers have all died on the moses ministry but joshua is taking a brand new people and people who were many of them were born around the journey they've come in and circumcised around the journey having a sign around them of a representation of coming out of egypt and now they are getting into the promise i also want you to see that under this joshua's ministry for them to continue the journey into the promised land his ministry was to take israel from the wilderness from one moses let them off into the promised land and divide or positionally place the church place the body into the promised land where god is taking them into and as joshua god's seventh was uh thinking of these things he led two spies or anointed two spies to go down there and minister it was under the minister of joshua under the minister of grace when his processing chained from law to grace the first place they went was the house of a gentile woman who has been in the house of bondage a house of jericho a house of bondage and in there like the you know the denominations uh the bible calls them prostitutes and harlots and so she was identified with them and therefore her lifestyle was categoric was categorized as one like that ray have been harlot because she was identified with the prostitutes of their time just like all of us who have been identified with a catholic church or methodists or denominations we came out of prostitution but the holy spirit led these spies to the house of this rehab and then god caught her out she represented the messengers she recognized the message they were bringing she was recognizing the power of god in the ministry to save her and the joshua's commission so when she received it she had the talking upon her life that talking brought it out when death was in every place in talking about ephesus striking to come in it was a place where they have to rightly divide the land but abraham says that when they cross over joshua alotted or divided divided this land to believers so this book of ephesus or joshua coming to the promised land is not for evangelical teaching it's for those who have already come out of egypt who are already being established who come into the promised land that god is going to divide his portion to them blessing of sons in other words adopting of sons bringing god's sons and daughters into the promised land where god is going to rightfully divide the word of god to them is the ephesians called we're crossing over and the promise is in revelation 10 when those seven thunders are going to sound and the mysteries are going to be revealed and the word of god is going to come to god's children when the message begins to come across them that message they receive that message that is there they are going to have upon their heart is what divides us from every organization revelation 10 the word of god came and it was that a mighty angel descended under joshua's ministry we saw the captain of the host also started with a sword the drone sword the sword was caught in the sheath it was drawn which was ready for battle it was out of the sheet it was an open sword which is the type that the word of god is no more a closed book is now an open book and because it's an open book god's student can take that word feed upon it eat upon the word and by eating upon the word we are positionally placed into the body of christ for god's word to have its own purpose in our lives and here we are today the ephesian church a ministry of life ministry that god is giving a fivefold apostles pastors prophets eating that book they are prophesying of the message of the hour and every one of us here know our position our sisters know their position our brothers know their position the deity the congregation the uh the laity the congregate the ministry everybody has a power to play and we have all been positioned in place right now into the body of christ prepare for a rapture to come we know it will be long the dead in christ will rise this ephesian church when he brought rehab out redhat when he came into israel she solidified solidified her status of inheritance in the land by her marriage and we have an inheritance today by our marriage to the lamb of god so when the land's book of life was opened that became our marriage certificate the land book of life was opened the bride was married and is the lamb's wife that he's taking for us to have a joint us with him on the throne we have an inheritance with him as well and so i bring this greatness to you all in the name of the lord jesus christ and i trust the law that

your care in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you sins before we take our seats i would just like for us to reach the scriptures i would like for us to turn to the book of joshua chapter one i want to read the first three verses joshua chapter one the first three verses now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord speak unto joshua the son of noon moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all these people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your food shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even onto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the ethics and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with him i will not filthy nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage for unto these people shall doubt divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest this book of the lord shall not depart from thy mouth out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for them thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be doubt is made for the lord thy god is with thee with whatsoever thou goest may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his holy wedge god bless you all you may be seated feel free in the presence of the lord and the god will bless you amen i would like to thank the lord for giving me this opportunity to be part of this program in year 2021 amen and i would like to also appreciate our dear pastor theovic and his associate brother isaac ovid and the entire board of the church and the entire sense the believers everywhere for affording me this privilege to be of service to the people of god or i can say the peoples of god because they came from different tribes and many backgrounds from all over the countries of the earth amen and we trust that somewhere along the line we can be of a blessing and i'm sending my warm regards to all the sins all over the world that we view this there'll be parts of this program i pray that the richest of god's blessings will be your portion in the name of jesus christ i also want to appreciate all the other servants of god that will be speaking in the program or that have spoken before me and will speak after me as the arrangement will be that the law will bless them the lord will prosper their ministries make their feet and their part beautiful watch over them and their families and keep them in the center of the of the will of god i want to commensurate with uh pastor raymond thompson once again on the passage of his dear wife and i pray that the old man will receive encouragement the lord knows all things sometimes you feel for a man like that being older than 70 or a little over this will be the time that he needs the association of his wife most and that was the time or is that time the lord also took the decision to take mama home but in god's in god's program in god's doing there is no mistakes and the capstone revelation that we have as believers is that god can never be wrong we might not understand some of his decisions and some of his decisions might feel very painful but we have a consolation that by and by we will understand it it is where we pastor raymond it is well with the family it is well with the saints in south africa god bless every one of you i just want him to know that we are perfectly identified with him and we share his pains and feel his grief and we identify with him we are part of it and we pray the lord will bless mama with the family i remember that our last trip to south africa for the convention in conquer it was such a it was such motherly making sure everything with us my seven wife they were just fine and dandy and we were hoping that we shall see again sometime but and we know we will still see anyhow amen not in this planet plane again maybe at the resurrection here for a brief meeting and up then glory for the wedding supper and thereafter for the millennium and thereafter for eternity till then we shall keep the faith and we pray that the lord will keep pastor healthy god bless everyone in the name of jesus christ we want to thank god for the inspiration the lord has given a servant again this year to gather us i'll be virtual now for most people who will have converged in the port of spain trinidad at this time but uh for the saints that'll be physically present there we salute you all and for those who are on virtual land we also salute everyone and we thank god for uh the theme for this convention it is called the dispensation of another ephesians amen and i seem to have read a very hot scripture when we are talking about ephesians i was reading the book of joshua but uh by the grace of god uh will transceive by god's grace where this meets with each other and i believe if we follow faithfully the teachings of the prophets concerning the ephesians it has its rooted background in the old testament and when we look for ephesians in the old testament we find the book of ephesians in the old testament in the book of joshua so much so that the prophet search we might as well call the book of ephesians as the book of joshua as the book of ephesians in the new testament and the book of ephesians as the book of joshua in the old testament and while meditating on that it gave me a very good background the lord pointed out some things to me there to be able to be of service and maybe be of blessing in this program and i thought that the lord will bless each and every one of you amen now the prophet said this book of ephesians perfectly parallels the old testament book of joshua amen i'm trusting that god will help me this time around to do a lot of reading so i prayed for the quest i asked the congregation to pray for me amen and he said um it said the ephesus now we find the same thing the old testament i think this book of joshua feats a fitting word for it will be the book of ephesus or the book of ephesians of the old testament the book of ephesians of the old testament would be a good thing to title this book of joshua because it's certainly fitting amen and since we are speaking of dispensation of another efficient i would like to go back a bit to build into the dispensation of efficiency because if you said dispensation of efficiency it is possible that you have a pre-dispensation before that and it is likely you may have a post dispensation after that but if you look at the dispensation of division itself it will look like a period of time which at a beginning and in the beginning there will be a lot of events that build up to a climax and those are some of the things i want to look at and i trust that god will help all the servants of god to come from various angles in order to paint a perfect picture that would reflect the mind of god amen all right from the scriptures that were reached the first thoughts that struck our hearts here was that the glorge caught the attention of joshua by telling him moses my servant is dead amen so according to god moses died amen but nobody could uh point to his grave amen because moses had an angelic paul biera and wherever they kept his body i don't know amen but god was interested in that body keeping and that was why when moses died god did something unusual he sent down angels to pick the body amen ordinarily when men died satan who is the author of death seemingly will have a right to the dead body especially in the dispensation when moses lived because he lived at the time that nothing has paid for the sin of mankind he lived at the time that the blood of jesus christ has not been shared the blood of bulls and gods and lambs were only figurative we're only a symbol and what they do they couldn't remit the sin of man they only covered each and that is why everybody who died before the advent of christ couldn't go into the presence of god they were all kept the bible said the prophet said they were kept in the paradise that then was which looks more like a vip section in the prison house of death but guess what the man who has the possession of the key of the prisoners of death that locked up the body was satan himself are you catching it so from the first man to the last one who died before the shedding of the blood if they are saints their bodies are locked up by the devil they are dead bodies because satan had a right to that body but when moses the servant of the lord died that was a man whom the lord personalized as a servant when he died god sent the power bearers of angels and that was why satan also came around and started fighting with them the bible said it was disputing with them over the body of moses amen and the ark angel michael the bible said he never brought a railing accusation even though satan deserves all accusations we can give him he never use bad words because there is no bad word in the saints there is no vulgar word in the sense if you are still speaking vulgarly acting vulgarly you are very abusive you need conversion it is not actually your mouth that needs your conversion it is your heart because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh if the art is taken care of the mouth will be taken care of i'm saying that my angel michael the act anger did not speak abusive words amen he only said the lord rebuked it satan was interested in that body because he feel a sense of entitlement to every dead body but because this body is to be preserved and used in the future god took interest and took care of the body by himself so moses my servant is dead but don't forget joshua was always around before the death of moses but joshua couldn't become the picture until after the death of moses so there was a dispensation before joshua's dispensation amen so i would say there was a dispensation or there was a period within this dispensation before the advent of joshua amen there was a period there was a stage there was a time hallelujah before the advent of joshua before that time joshua was laying low waiting for his own time but i tell you everything joshua will need has been prepared the ground has got to be prepared for joshua amen in order for him to take over because the ministry of joshua the job description of joshua as stated by god was for him to take the people into that inheritance and divide it in other words joshua at the ministry of placing everybody into their inheritance amen and it is that blessing if you look at the book of ephesians the book of ephesians dealt more with the blessing of the church into the inheritance ephesians stressed your origin it took you away from time it took you into eternity ephesians told you that even your adoption was not an afterthought it was not a timely conception it said your adoption was a predestination your adoption was a predestinated mystery of his will which was revealed to you amen in time immensely meaning that everything god wanted to do he has already done it was that and it is that that the book of ephesians come to bring you to the reality of and that is why in ephesians you see the blessing of the ministries you see the placing of the church the ministries have got to be placed for the church to be placed just follow every bit of my statement it is the word of the lord amen the ministries have got to be placed before what before the church is placed you know why because the ministries have a responsibility in the blessing of the church the ministry have a responsibility to be able to bring you to the recognition of who you are you don't talk of a placement if you don't even know who you are one of the books of the bible that connected us to our origin that we can boldly affirm our personality in god was the book of ephesians he told us where we came from he taught us how not to linger between two opinions he told us our salvation can be sure to the believer it knocks out the doubt of identity am i a child of god am i not a child of god you will find those things in the book of ephesians because it instilled it in you that you are a seed of god and if you are a seed of god you must unfold then it came to a point he told you what not your grief he showed you your ceiling he said you are sealed by the holy ghost until the day of your watch your redemption amen which we know the fullness of your redemption is your body change and with apostle paul told the church the perfection of your redemption is your body change he said to which the redemption of our body the book of ephesians showed us all those things the book of ephesians blessed the family amen but before he started those things it connected you to your origin it made you to know who you are then it brought the ministry to put you in your inheritance are we together amen i'm not by that calling the fivefold joshua i want that known all over the surface of the earth the five-fold is not joshua you will see who the joshua is as we go along just enjoy the lord amen but it placed the ministries and after the ministry's place the church is placed then it began to place our families it was inefficient that we are told that if we are ever going to have a successful family we must have it like christ christ has a family is god a church he's got a bride and if he has a bride he has a family even if he does not have children man and wife they are a family and the book of ephesians took time to place the families he told the husband the position he must be are we together are we together he told that husband the position you must be amen it said you are the head in the family he placed the wife in a position you are the body of the family amen and when the edge and the body come together ephesians show us the mystery of oneness amen that when a man and a woman is to get marriage what god is interested in in the man is his age amen what god is interested in in the woman is our body hallelujah and we can begin to lend this placement for our lives so when both of you come forward to be married god cuts the edge off of the man and threw his body away his body lost and loses identity in marriage then when a woman comes up it cuts his head off throws his head off and takes a body then he puts the head of the man on the body of the woman i'm talking spiritual and the two had become one so if you see yourself as a personality my sister you are just a body if you see yourself as a personality my brother you are just a hedge amen and he told us because there are many faculties in the age amen and there are many faculties in the body and he told us that the body that entire personality can only progress when there is coordination amen the church of god can only progress when there is what coordination because in the brain you have the head is that right so the brain can conceive lofty ideas but can the brain carry it out by himself are we together it you know in describing us in describing his church he said you he said i am divine you are the branches i may not remember that now divine life lost within the vine fruit is actually manufactured from the vine but can you see the fruit on the vine you see the fruit on the branches amen so the vine has to interact with the branch in order to bear the fruit meaning that everything that tree has in itself cannot come to fruition or manifestation without expressing it through the branches christ the head has got lofty programs and plans but they can never come to fruition without expressing it through his bride which is his body which is you and i hallelujah ephesians sure does that he showed us that no matter how great the plan is that the brain the intelligence of a man at conceived it takes the body to drive it amen you need your hands to implement it the ants are not in the edge it's in there in the body you need your leg to move it the legs are not in the edge they are in the body the brain sends messages to the leg and that is why the legs can move what if the legs say i am not moving every vision every thought every plan no matter how great will rotten right on the spot i want you to know church that god is conscious of that and that is why he's careful to choose his bride he's not choosing any our people because his program cannot be defeated and he must work at that program through the bride of his own chosen that is why that bride must have his nature in himself in order for their thoughts to agree they are thinking to be the same they are taught to be the same that is why if you want to be the bride of christ you've got no ideas or thoughts coming you must drop it you will lose your individualism for the lord jesus christ as long as you want to remain yourself you cannot be the bride of christ this is why in the book of ephesians he told the man you are the head it's a placement amen he told the woman you are the body and he said how do you function as a body you function by reverence did you catch that that's placing you into your inheritance so that you can enjoy the things that have been freely given unto you he said you men how do you function as a head he said you function by love amen that is why he said husbands love your wife now the quality of this love according to ephesians must go beyond failure did you hear me church the quality of this love must gone into a gap out it must be love divine amen he said even us oh church underline that always in your mind there is no less quality and the only person that can love as christ is a man or a woman who has christ in them this is what the prophet said only christian can love because what it means to be christian is christ-like christ like is a carrier of the nature of christ you can't make it without the life of christ you need to be born again without the holy ghost you are finished [Applause] are you following me i want to get married i want to get married get the holy ghost first did you hear me because you will only marry your reflection you will only marry your type like beget like deep collects to the deep the bride of christ has to be predestinated or danged to become bright she is not he's not just going to pick any other people because god appreciates a perfect harmony he needs an harmony to execute his plan and i'm telling us even in our houses amen because the word of the hour has come to place us you don't catch that when you are thinking these things are still in the future that is why you are that is why you feel you are you can accommodate carelessness and excesses and bad practice and bad habits i will show you this morning that the prophet said we are here in the ephesians it is not a future if it remains a future the word of god has worked for nothing amen i'm building a case just follow me gradually it said the bride you must have what reverence it said you husbands you must love your wife let's look at the quality of the love even as christ loved his church and gave himself for each amen christ was willing to give what his life is all for that bride that is the quality of the love that he had that has gone beyond failure that is divine love are you catching a church a love that does not value his life above that of his wife a love that was ready to become a ransom for his own wife and he said for you sister your placement is in reverence amen and let me tell you the word reverence is deeper than the word respect is a king to worship amen this is why if you don't feel that man deserves your reference don't marry him if you marry him you must reverence him your position is to reverence your husband and how do you come about reverence you accept him as your singular hedge amen from where you take instructions whatever it says does not comfort with arguments even if you are strongly opinionated otherwise you can only engage in simplicity and humility are you catching it because the bible said you must reverence him in all things i know many are becoming modern amen but i would rather you take your modernity from the scripture jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever there will never be a better civilization than that amen it does not get any better than that if you want peace in your home if you want healing in your womb if you want joy if you want heaven and earth you've got to take divine prescriptions because god sent his servants to place the church if you cannot respect him if you would like to argue with him if you would like to abuse him don't ever get married when you don't have the nature of christ in you two you are not submissive he doesn't deserve you or you don't deserve him when the family is placed correctly the church of the lord will be in their position these are the things that you'll find amen in the book of ephesians and then finally after he dealt with us he dealt with our family the bible said he finally dealt with the church he said finally my brethren that is now addressing the church he has stressed your origin he has shown you who you are he has given you a witness that you are a child of god and he instilled it in you by a great fate that nothing can shake it not in present not in future the prophet said the book of ephesians was the solution that we needed between calvinism and armenianism because the book of ephesians approached god and his word to the church from a balanced point of view amen it took the blessings of the calvinists who will turn the grace of god into disgrace and the truth the blessings from the armenians who think that it is only by human effort that you can achieve holiness amen it took the blessings of the true way and it blessed us two ways and he placed us in the middle of the road because the middle of the road is the most balanced area on the road somebody said if you drive in the middle of the road you are preparing for a crash because it thought that it's a two-way opposite traffic lanes no sir it's a one-way road amen in a one-way lane there's no opposite traffic coming it is just one direction you don't go to heaven and come out of it we keep going into each that is the way to holiness that is the way to the kingdom of god is an highway of holiness when you stand in the middle of it you are balanced and i'm so glad the message we receive is an efficient message i will come to it to round up just follow me this morning i'm speaking on the efficient the efficiency of this journey amen the theme of the convention is the dispensation of the ephesians but i'm speaking on the efficiency of this journey hallelujah so he blessed you he made you know who you are he established you into your inheritance then he went after the family amen before he went for the family he went for the ministries amen he located a five-fold into their positions hallelujah he told us that there are teachers amen he told us there are apostles he told us there are pastors he told us there are prophets he told us there are evangelists amen and there are no less ministries they are all five-fold ministry you never hear such concept in the world even though church listen to me even though it's in the scripture you don't hear those concepts in the world what you hear in the world is more of graded title approach amen and it's a pity that is creeping around the message it's not in the message amen grade that title approach you hear it past us and what do you call other ministers if it is not a pastor it's in the lesser category no no truly the local bishop the local header is a pastor are you following but there are other ministries also in the church and the functioning of all these ministries is to achieve excellent things and that will deal with those who think also we don't need the five-fold is because your understanding of the program of god in this last dispensation is very shallow you need the ministries and watch who was writing the book of ephesians the man god used to write the book of ephesians was the messenger for that hour are you are you listening something ephesians originated from god but it never came from god directly to you it came through the medium of the messenger the messenger places the church into the inheritance by the holy spirit before paul left the church was set in order setting each other setting the church in other is putting everybody into their positions did you hear me church that was why we could hear from him the mystery of our life in your personal dealing with god he establish a relationship between you and god to make sure to make you have the assurance that you are a seed of god when they finish with that he went for the ministries why will he go for the ministries because after the messenger some people must keep that voice alive and that was why the quote that says that when god comes down it goes through the messenger amen and from that messenger those who are faithfully touched hallelujah those who are watched faithfully touch they carry on with that message their faithful teaching is that they've been brought up in a manner not to add or suppress they themselves also become an eunuch to this world they don't teach experience for truth they teach the world as the truth they can learn from the experience but experience will not become the church order experience will not become the doctrine experience will not become the conduct and they will they won't do it oh man you hear people teaching experience for truth today and they do it in flagrance opposition to even watch the review what had said you are not building a church for god because you will come to realize that the ephesians are not corinthians oh my the church needs to catch that if you look at the messenger to the current messages to the corinthian church if a man is not careful in the corinthian church it should be difficult for you to come to perfection because if they are not having gift problems they are dealing with the fornicator if they are not dealing with the compulator they are dealing with those who have segregated who have chosen their stars and heroes i am for apollos i am for courage when there is so much crisis church don't churches don't advance because you are spending more time dealing with crisis amen you are spending more time dealing with small small things love your brother don't fight don't eat don't bug bites don't gossip don't hate your brother don't effort don't be influenced by funny dreams and all kind of things you are still in the corinthian church don't live in sin we have to pilot you around and guide you so that you are not fletching around those are corinthian tendencies i want you to compare the message to the church of corinthians with that of the ephesians you will know that they are not the same you will know that the quality of believing is different and it is the quality of your believing that determines the messages you hear did you hear me church the messages that comes to you depends on the quality of your believing if you have environments that they are still preaching and don't do this don't do that don't do this it's because there are a lot of doings god will not have a servant to open his mouth for fun if he has yielded himself to the spirit is because the lord who is the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the art is discerning things he's seen that girl who is wayward but pretend like a dove in the house of the lord it's in that brother who is a church presenting to pray pretending to be christian in the church you will keep the church on the same spot hallelujah but you watch the ephesian church oh apostle paul to tell the church let us live the principles let us go on to perfection he said if time permits we shall still dwell on distance is part of our fetch but we cannot always dwell on abc's we cannot always do arithmetic arithmetic we've got to go into some further mats we've got to go into algebras hallelujah and inside the algebras you still find repentance you still find salvation god has to go to coinage differently because the efficient church can only be produced by what they are eating you've got to eat correctly hallelujah let me tell you there's a man there's a difference between messages of preparation and messages of adoption there's a difference between messages for children and messages for maturity they all came from god but they do different things apostle paul told the corinthian church when i was a child i act as a child i behave like a child i eat as a child it is milk that is for children hallelujah it's about you you should count number of years because the joy of life of living can only be sustained if there is growth hallelujah if there is no growth there is a problem whether growth as an individual or as a family or as a church of the living god there must be growth there must be the things that have plagued us in the past that are no longer plaguing us we might not have gotten to where we are going but each day should be a celebration that we are not who we used to be if that is not happening you will short change yourself but the quality of the messages that will be coming to you [Music] milk sucking churches it's only good for bone form it's much more bone formation but you see that baby is going to reject you and make one of these diseases you know what it's going to be insufficient um and when it becomes insufficient and you are not giving the child real food the prophet in the message running from the presence of the lord he said we've got to rob out make believe from the church and go into the deeper things of god and when we say the deep patterns of god not intellectual gymnastics that we end up with the people not getting anything from that service not human concussion the people who are sent must realize how necessary to say only what the messenger of search it's a church in progression the ministry of the prophet was in progression before he came to perfection the prophet came to a point that he told us that his bible in his hand became a watch a new book it was the same old bible what makes it new the advent of the angel of the lord that made a difference to revelation to understanding spiritual understanding of the world we must come to each because it is that perfect understanding that will achieve a literal work of working on the atoms of your body to translate you from children to the fate of the apostolic fathers exactly so all these the book of ephesians taught us i'm just bringing the corinthians to draw a parallel to make you appreciate the necessity for the ephesians the book of ephesians it was given by the messenger amen but the messenger asked to place the ministry because when the messenger leaves the messenger was happy to leave the messenger knew he was going to leave paul told his church he said i am ready to be watched to be offered amen prophet agar boss did a sign he said i'm not he said why are you people sorry i'm not even afraid to go and be in bondage i'm happy to go and die for him did he not say so he said then spot is led for me a crown of glory not for me alone but for as many as love it is appearing if my love is appearing the crown is waiting for me if you do is waiting for you he was not afraid to die he knew he was going to leave but before he left he set the church in order he taught communion it touched church order amen he placed the ministries into their position after the ministries he dealt with gifts oh that's a true church standing friends then he came into the family he dealt with marriage he dealt with family life hallelujah no one that the prophet said god gave us a remedy on how to marry our wives and to live with them amen if you don't know those remedies go back to the messages he dealt with it then finally then finally my brethren is dealing with the church and he began to allocate weapons for our warfare amen you knew you were going to have battles he knew in your inheritance hallelujah you've got to take it by force because there are already invaders and settlers in the land and we've got to chase them out hallelujah when joshua came into the land of canaan the land of the inheritance amen if that wasn't heaven that wasn't healthy land they met settlers there they met people they had to deal with there amen but their uncle they are driving force their passion was that great faith i have given you the land wherever the soul of your fish are touched it is your inheritance but guess what after joshua divided the lad and placed people into their inheritance you tribe of this movie you this one move here you this one moved here it wasn't an easy occupation you see this was why i went back to the book of joshua amen so you can so you can see the making of the ephesians it wasn't an easy watch occupation when they got into the inheritance they met in vedas they met quarters they made you surpass in the land amen and these usurpers were ready to claim this as their land they probably even have history of ownership but does it bother the believer what the believer is concerned is what god said i have given you the land caleb told joshua don't give me support just write it off just give the command for me to take it he said as my strength was then so is my strength now that is an efficient hallelujah that is an efficient that is a man who knows the ground is standing that is a man who has escaped the corruption he has kept it in kadesh i'm coming to those things he has kept all those troubles he has kept the temptations he has kept all the oppositions he came out on his cottage and he got a double portion and the personally god preserved him every promise to the efficient church will preserve them you will enjoy every bit of it without fail and god will keep you in the shape to enjoy it when he got into canaan the inheritance he said joshua remember oh hallelujah it's it's not it's not the way i want to bring it but i think god is helping us joshua remember in those days of our temptation in kadesh bania that is on 45 years ago when you and i went to spy the lunch and we came with good report because we have another spirit you must have another spirit contrary to the spirit of others you must have the holy spirit it's in the bible exactly is that my covenant of peace will be with caleb and joshua because they have another spirit their spirit was different from the spirit of the ten elders the ten elders were all fighters i'm going to locate them for you shortly [Music] oh yes he said you have another spirit and because you do i will give you extra portion let me tell you there will be spacious portions there will be special reward to those who are faithfully following this message don't follow it in half manner don't follow it affectedly follow it with the whole of your heart there will be a special blessing some are building goats some are building stubbles some are building silver some are building bronze paul said i am the master builder let every man watch what is building because every walk will be tried by fire the believers will not come to judgment but there will be a future judgment of your work that's the wage and that is why around the wedding supper there's going to be price giving day hallelujah for those who are outstanding all of us will go to class isn't it all of us will graduate amen but there'll be some outstanding students isn't this physical times they're spiritual i want my name to be called out for outstanding followership and don't get followership fanatical followership of this message of the hour i don't want my dears coming into it i don't want my opinions or my thoughts coming amen some things will not jeopardize your eternity but it will make you lose reward some things will not change your sonship but it will shortchange you i read it some time ago that you will never be able to come to the fullness of the benefit of your sonship let's think on that friends amen [Music] is that finally my brethren he talked to them and he said finally put on the whole ammo amen apostle paul left a kitten church did you hear me he left a fully kitted fully equipped church and that was why after paul left when some folks were coming we switched out to preach you gaga's things these ephesians listen carefully when they finish their gymnastics and their theories and their parabulations permutations and combinations they said brethren thank you very much for the effort he said but you know what you did not say what paul said if you have problem with me saying what the prophet said you will have it as a permanent problem because i'm an efficient of this hour he said you did not say what paul said therefore with all your anointing you are false they tried every anointing every spirit every manifestation every demonstration but the message of their hour even in the absence of apostle paul they remain loyal because paul affirmatively told them he was so convinced of what god gave him that which i received from the lord the same i delivered to you he was so convinced until he said even if it is we or an angel we shall come back to say we don't mean or it is now different it says let us be a curse brother brahm said there is a hanging cause over those who we hurt over those who we surprised even if we don't pray against them they are already on that course [Applause] [Music] if you step by distance and impurity you already under blessing he said because blessed are those who read and meditate on the words of this prophecy to read the lord is a blessing brothers read your bible sisters read your bible reading alone is a blessing [Applause] how can a man be so sure of his revelation the prophet said when god gives a revelation he cannot change it he said he can add to his to further its understanding but he can never bring something opposite and i throw it as a challenge today god cannot give two opposing truths on one subject of doctrine of his words the true truths are opposing each other and we said they are true no sir the prophet said one is false one is true or both of them are false but the probability that cannot happen is for both of them to be true because god is not a double tongue god is only one tongue amen finally my brethren then you know what he did he kitted the church he prepared the church for the battle to claim their ground and stay in age i have shown you i have placed you but you need this to retain your victory church of the living god this is the junction where we are amen with that as a background i won't take your time so much let's go back to the book of joshua moses my servant is dead so moses are the periods before joshua but all along joshua was part of that economy are you catching it before before moses came to bring his message which was law grace was ruling that church because this church started as a people from egypt while they were in egypt for there to be deliverance grace sent them a prophet when they never even asked for one they were only crying for deliverance how their deliverance would come they never knew grace brought the pillar of fire grace gave them the pillar of clouds are you connecting with us grace brought the word for that hour and grace puts them under the atonement it was the atonement that saved them from the plagues of egypt and it is the atonement that we are living under that is keeping us in the last days while these people do not even know who they were because egypt was the type of the world while they were in the world the grace of god that appeared to all men already appeared unto them that is why why we were yet sinners love has been commended to us it was the work of grace god never waited for you to impress him and that was why in the book of ephesians apostle paul could show you that that could happen because you were predestinated in his will before the foundation of the world mercy found you before sin found you sin find you by your natural breath but messi find you by your election election existed before your natural birth and the conditions of natural breath can never change election this was what ephesians is making you realize to give you the assurance of salvation so there was the egyptian period and god who was ready to help them he came down in that messenger it testified to them all these things they saw the cloud they saw the pillar of fire even though they might not see it physically they accepted the testimony and decided that the right thing for them is to leave egypt church are we together church are we together the writing for them is to do what live the world and the things of the world the prophet call it the repentance of the church as i'm looking at the program of god for this day i have to go back to the old testament to show you those events so you can understand the dispensation of the ephesians because the prophet said every christian journey every christian move of god has always had its efficiency so we are taking the thoughts and the understanding of the prophet with regarding efficiency he said that was your repentance in acts chapter 2 38 the first thing a man does is to what repent if you have not repented this morning i'm calling you to repentance be sorry for all your wrongs don't rationalize it don't find the reason behind wrong living if you keep finding the reason behind wrong living you are going to have the faith of soul be like a david this morning so you can come into your adoption david came into his inheritance because he valued repentance that is the journey of an official after they repented god brought them to the period of the red sea in which the bible described it as their baptism how many ever read that in the bible he said that we are baptized unto moses oh gracious almighty god so this moses wasn't as ordinary as you think they were baptized onto the message of moses the message that called them to repentance that's what the bible said as many as went through the red sea we are baptized unto who moses so you see where you are seeing moses god was seeing himself because the commission was be you god let aaron be your what now how was moses god to the people he never came with his own message they were not feeding on moses amen whatever they repented of was not because of moses was because of the message moses brought and all the messages that moses brought was called moses read your bible that deliverance was called moses oh man if we use those words today you will think we are religious all those of you believing back to the bible that is the bible i'm coaching and i hope you don't have problems with that because today you have problem with the mention of the name of the prophet you have problem with william brahm and you told me you don't have problem with moses you are an hypocrite are you a confused man let me give you another shock it said wherever moses is preached how many read it in the scriptures the bible says moses was preached was it moses they were preaching the message moses brought was called moses and the ephesians believe it like that there are literally two things that will prepare your mind to accept the totality of the words some of you will talk about back to the bible you can't even believe bible if bible was actually preached to you i'm preaching the bible now let's see how many struggling with that didn't the bible say wherever moses is preached so will it be strange for the people of that age to say moses search and with the true convert of that exodus i have problems with that if you do you are not a vision you are just a sophisticated pentecostal denomination looking around the message [Music] come on church we're speaking to the world amen so we better hear it correctly and get it correctly in the light of its revelation because i'm celebrating the ephesians the ephesians who will look at you in the face you didn't speak it like paul said it therefore you are false it was a building block debut to that maturity they were loyal to the world let's be loyal to this message anything you cannot find a seat for throw it away in your conduct in your order in your doctrine stop sympathizing with creatures god called you a night out of preach lester sent the message ultimately the message has order it has conduct it does doctrine the message is not a cesspool we are anything can harry anything goes no sir if you travel with it there will be a generation that will be loyal to each [Music] oh glory to god they came to the red sea and they were baptized amen so there are so many ways we can look at these things but this is the direction today after their baptism they started their wilderness journey isn't it their wilderness journey was a place of trials that is your sanctification [Music] and the prophet said sanctification presents a trying time in the message of a present water from the living rock he said this is the stage many people will rebel and go back as i'm speaking of that church be looking at yourself and i'm going to speak of it in terms of end time program of god looking at dispensation that was why from the red sea to kadesh bhania which was the length of the entire wilderness experience because after kadesh bernier was the inheritance they would have come into the fullness of the baptism of the holy ghost after kadesh banier but let me tell you go read your bible every trial that exodus church heard they heard it between the red sea and category they had the dayton quran abraham in that spell of time they had balance in that spell of time shall we go into the activities they have the ten elders who preach the message of we cannot make it in that spell of time in all the messages of jubilee the prophet called this generation of people old fighters and he said before you and i can enter into our inheritance and enjoy it all the old fighters must give way [Music] what was the function of dayton quran and aberrant they don't want to stay with one-man message that was the exact x-ray of the messenger they feel the length of the journey is too wide enough to stay only with what moses said and because they are eloquent men of renewed big guys they were not the prophet messengers they are people you can call the fivefold because they were levites come on church they were ministers they were not priests but ministers in the levitical order you have the priesthood and you have the ministry the priesthood are those who are for intercession it's just like in the new testament the lord divided the ministry into five folds then you have the ministry in about three fold also that's not cast in stone but you have them as a priest you have them as the ministers those who reach the scrolls and preach they are from and you have them as the singers those who minister through songs they are all delivered and these guys hallelujah they were renowned ministers they are powerful preachers if they are staged under the ministry of the messenger no problem but the prophet said the undoing of korra dayton and habiram was because they couldn't stay with one man message they had i want to be the continuity of the message or they want to be the better part of the message or they want to be the oh man we had many joshuas before joshua himself are you following me this is a serious matter because what did they succeed in doing they needed the message to get legitimacy but they are not of the message so what we are seeing today is not different from what we have seen people have repented so to say people have been baptized in the name of jesus christ onto the message of the hour amen and the same people they claim the holy spirit they have preached this message for a long time until they start having corrupt data and aburam ideas and they began to have so much influence in the art mind soul spirit body head of the believers until the believers unconsciously drop the message for their own teachings and you god look at the teachings of most of them it's far away from the message [Music] they never left the message but they became liabilities to the message did you ever see quran left to the message of daddy he remained there but it became liability until it was consumed [Applause] there is nothing new under the sun whatever is happening has been before and if there is a tomorrow more will come but why is god allowing those things to prove you to test you amen to make you sure god to make you the real efficiency [Music] because let me tell you in the midst of these cantacarous tendencies the believers stood there was a generation that was not carried away there was a generation that remained unpolluted hallelujah they are not going to accept the interpretation of the five-fold they will only stay with interpretation of the messenger there is nobody preaching any mystery that is where they deceive your mind and swindle you is a spiritual sunderland all mysteries have been revealed what we are preaching is the revelation of mysteries who are you to preach mystery did the word of the lord come to you are doing gymnastics on the puppy you calling ministries ask your audience how much understanding do they have you left them more confused after you are leaving than the time you match them and because they themselves do not put a value on their souls it's okay they don't want to offend and you dummy your soul is high time the efficiency rolls up and say give us the message and nothing else don't give us colored water the water that has been colored by a daytime colored by an hobby ram colored by a cora we don't need colored water it brings pollution nobody drinks normal pure water and gets sick except it's contaminated but you drink too much coke you suffer sickness you drink too much fanta it's a problem drink all the water it cleanses your system give us the pure watch not the ones colored and painted by the touch of men [Applause] none of them was sent to you amen but distance are there to prove you to be sure you come into your inheritance the reason a lot of you are not coming into your inheritance is because you are still taking colored waters i use the word water because the word of god is a water that is supposed to be for your cleansing you can use coke to wash your bleach amen you use water to wash your plate that is proper cleaning do you use coca cola to take your bath hey if you use coca-cola to take your bath your body will be coming you won't even feel clean ants and circles will be attracted to you but use clean water hallelujah and the bride is washed by the water of his word those who use colored water perish in the wilderness no inheritance for you no adoption for you using colored water using the interpretation of men see how many have risen up in these days because of offense i won't mention names but i'm not afraid they are all colored waters amen and that is why some of you must even repent and be pushed of those things they have put in you amen don't think it is right amen if you want to come into efficient dispensation if you want to be mature you want to come into adoption punch yourself of all colored waters they are not the truth throw them books away come back to the message of the hour take it from 46 to 65 hallelujah take it all the way you will see the light of god you will see the program of god you will see the purity of god then you are on your road to efficient masterpiece if it sounds offensive to you anywhere oh may god have mercy i can't apologize for the truth but i can ask the lord we have mercy let the lord have mercy upon me let the lord have mercy upon you it's all i can say the hour is getting late we've got to come into trueness the message is either right or wrong if it is right let us give our whole to it i'm showing you things that prevented some people from coming into the inheritance the inheritance is the dispensation of the ephesians [Music] cora dayton and haram had their time amen it never shook the church even aaron who was so close to the blessing at this time did you realize that god is not respecter of persons aaron was the man used to building golden calf and the prophet said we still have the golden calf schemes today let me show you the golden calf schemes quickly when moses was absent from them what did he go for he went to collect the watch that will govern that hour is that not the truth church before it came what did men say as for these moses we don't know what has become of him so they used a priest they used the fivefold hear me clearly to invent a scheme to substitute what they were to have expected and that was where everyone came into the picture church what was the confession of aaron i fear the people he doesn't want to lose his popularity before the people he doesn't want to lose his scholarship he still wants to be in their good books i don't care for good books i want peace with god are you listening to me i'm telling you the confession of aaron some of you knew the truth and you still know it but because of pecuniary objectives because of some benefits physical benefit for your body fun-seeking pleasure loving generation at the expense of your soul you can't stand right you think aaron never knew better errant because of popularity he confessed it himself i'm not describing it that was what he said he said you know your people it was left there to guide the people it was legs there to keep them in the path of righteousness hallelujah but the people became of his stature to intimidate the ministry jezebel religion here jezebel is him here and heron boccucc under popularity impression and they told them to bring all the things they brought from the world what do you do with them anyway you still keep them they will lead into idolatry it did in the beginning we do at the end time they brought all their earrings and so forth all those things they borrowed from egyptians it wasn't their way it was what they watched in the egyptians they are not completely poached yet that is why justification is not your absolute project listen to me it takes care of them of your past but if you don't move beyond them the root of that sin what makes you live like a sinner is stealing you even under justification when you are sanctified you prune the branches you need the holy ghost which is fire to kill the roots place himself in your life so this church in the wilderness having gone through directive baptism is still not much they still have a strong influence of egypt after all how many of them made it many perish in the wilderness because you of the overbearing influence of egypt anything light affliction any small challenge are there no graves in egypt come on george you can be worldly and be christian at the same time you must choose one you cannot serve god and mamman at the same time you must choose one he gathered it all together and he made for them a golden calf and a man who got carried away by the time he finished making it the action of those people converted iran do you know what he said he said beyond israel your god that brought you out of here the high priest of israel church don't carry the image of any holy man no matter how nice they are to you if they leave the world leave them alone [Applause] they didn't die for you their blood was not shared for you they can't take they didn't bring you here they can't take you anywhere be concerned about your soul some of you money is your god and that is why you can detach yourself from evil the whole high priest of israel said beyond your god and israel started worshiping the moment the worship began it created such a revival the prophet called it the golden calf scheme how many five-fold ministries are doing it today what is the intention to replace the message they don't tell you frontally because they are no bulge but by the time they finish with you you will realize that you are out of the range of the message you are in another economy and those of you who have suffered the faith you know better oh sure if you want to be honest with yourself it is the old fighters at work then after this after they came out of that they came to the ten elders or was it the balaam just unlike that and the ten elders told them you cannot make it the spirit of the ten elders are see here amen after that they came to balance doctrine we are all one we are all the same the prophet said what was what was is that the prophecy of balaam was correct but the teaching of balaam was dangerous because balaam's attempt to run contrary to the message of that day makes him false to begin with amen but when it speaks prophecies it was correct when his prophecy couldn't curse the people of god he brought a teaching we all won so in the feast of balaam you have all kinds of people those who dress and look like moabites full moabites in appearance they have their lifestyle forget it they have the appearance they as worldly as worldly can be amen the face is painted they came out of the world from painting they got into they got into the message we padded until a black sister will look like a a brownish sister god knows your house address [Music] if sons of gods are still who they are they won't marry anything like that pancaking your face it didn't start now the prophet said before you marry i tell her to go and wash your face because yeah it's a quotation it's a quotation i don't care what you call it the devil will take you from lipstick and it will start giving you some funny funny things it will take you from from full blown painting it will give you the one they call organic at the end of the day it changes your face if it's hurting you please forgive me for hurting you but i cannot repent of what i'm saying if your pastor appreciates that's fine go on with it but the prophet told me some of it is balaamism and i told you if they were not making up their face he will not tell you to go and watch why are you doing those things you want to have a beautiful identity if that is what the boy marries don't forget you will always take time home to wash and the devil polish a lot of you when you are doing your evening beauty routine you can spend two hours removing this removing that a christian sister it's balaamism amen it brought them together oh all we know is that we are united by common purpose we are not the same look let me tell you why some people were collapsing for these things you know 25 000 people died in the battle of bala the entire people died in the matter of ten elders many also died in the matter of colorado and abraham because even after seeing the obvious hand of the lord that was heavy upon those men some people were still sympathizers who came to attack moses you have killed the people of god and god wiped them out just the same it didn't cost god anything then it wouldn't cost him anything now generation of sympathizers with evil osha it didn't begin now read your bible and why was god doing all this pudging along the way because the efficient church must be pure it will take the cream of the cream the survival of the fetus amen so god at every state was pudging that church reducing it to a number that it will only accommodate the predestinated unto adoption those who are meant for that inheritance depositing continues church you see their parents today you can't tell a difference the illy so i as if no as i don't blame them they don't read the message they read other authorities the guys who want to be popular the old fighters amen we are living in the days that this one is a judgment that one is a joshua we have had duplications of jews who are more than 25 or 30 people claiming joshua he tells me they are counterfeits you don't even know who joshua is so what was happening it brought them eventually to the border it brought them to that poison level when the church was perfectly pushed the movement began am i still preaching the bible then god told the messenger it is now time for you to leave now you must begin to decrease hallelujah something else must increase amen then the lord told him go and anoint joshua church of the living god joshua was anointed and moses the servant of the lord left the prophet said the mess he said in our dispensation we have come through a lot of persians in our justification sanctification we have been pushed until we came to these last days entering into our inheritance and before the prophet left in 1965 he said now we are here in the efficient in the efficient age when joshua was to take over god told him do everything as moses has given you joshua had no idea of how to pull down the barrier that would take the saints into the inheritance the angel of the lord had to come down from on high amen from 1946 to 1962 we have lived in the dispensation of the messenger to the laudacian church age as a matter of fact we are all in love this year i'm winding down closely but you must get this speech because i want to show you who you are now from the ministry of the signing the hands to that that discern the thoughts of men and the wonderful evangelisms that went on the efficient church the efficient congregation was in the background the people of joshua were in the background nobody knew them the ministry of the prophet for those number of years could only produce all manner of congregation from among these numbers god must sieve out certain people are you listening to me god must identify the people who are ready to be placed into the inheritance the messenger of the hour cannot place you into your inheritance moses never pleased them he saw them he called them out through their call-outs he saw them through their purging in the wilderness but he handed them over to joshua to please them didn't william brahm came to a point that he said i must decrease how many have i read it and he must increase is that if i am not that person i am laying the foundation for that person so that when it does come i must decrease and he must increase those statements were not made for nothing when john the baptist made that statement is because his own ministry as the messenger and the foreigner was ready to give way to the ministry of the lord jesus christ himself who are you to call yourself joshua you do not fit java means joshua means jehovah savior it's only christ that bears that name that is why in some scriptures interpretation in the place of joshua they put jesus even i think in the authorized king james version in the new testament there was a place they should have used joshua they used the word jesus it's a revelation somebody must present us we must have years of preparation amen and let me tell you as a church we have added by the pro i'm not talking of as a local church as the move of god for this age we have added the years of preparations the years of persians the world fighters are going out because if they remain they will keep you from your inheritance their ministries can never bring you to inheritance because their ministries intended to be substitute to the message of the hour joshua was not a substitute for moses joshua was the captain of moses that was why the instruction to joshua was that do not depart may god give his church revelation meditate in this day and night joshua watched unto his that everything he did was according to what he was given common church those who teach you that the messenger was only a prophet he's not a teacher they want to destroy the also they are hold fighters they must give away i say it prophetically and they are giving way because the children of jubilee must see their lives they must come into their full inheritance they are ready in the land of ephesians they must enjoy every benefit we must come to full adoption amen so joshua did you ever see anywhere where joshua contradicted moses the things you don't know the things you read moses act joshua acted it out amen the pleasant of everybody was according to the message of moses let me harmonize it for you when john said i must increase i must decrease our name was increased who did he refer to the lord jesus christ isn't it if moses decrees and he increased who was he referring to jesus christ joshua jehovah savior [Music] that was why joseph joshua needed the visitation from above a full manifestation of the angel of the lord who gave him its seven seals i can read it for you here the prophet said for a week for us to come into our efficient dispensation efficient blessing we need the opening of the seals he's right here what was it to lose it was to lose jericho completely it was to december jericho so that because that was the wall that separated that exodus church from the inheritance when it is disarmed they will see the blessings and even joshua as a person couldn't do it it would take the real he took the real joshua amen you say who was that who was that did joshua worship that man or not hey hey hey did he worship him or not the angel that came down did he reject the worship did he accept the worship why would he accept the worship who was he [Music] so who did moses actually decrees for ah church of god who did it decrees for you thinking joshua was moses minister a fivefold moses cannot decrease for joshua [Music] moses left the sin for the god of exodus himself to take over his business the god of exodus took over and they walk through the five volts to bless the people in their blessings isn't this the scripture it's as simple as it can be but the five-fold couldn't have any thought they don't have any idea they don't have any opinion because the rule of engagement is say what the tip says say only what moses had said if they do not say according to the law and the prophet the spirit of god is not in them that's what the scripture said i'm nailing it here for you now as i went down in these last days the prophet said i must decrease enemas increase who did it decrease for it decreased for me it will decrease for you when i am to look up to him to him the word of the lord came and the proof that i am a genuine minister is the grace i received to follow what he touched paul said follow me as i follow christ it cannot decrease for you [Applause] [Music] if it decreased for you that shows it was foreign in you that wasn't the message at oil river as john the baptist was sent to forron the first coming of who the first coming of christ you are sent with the message that we do what for run the second coming of who of jesus christ so if william brahm decrees and he said he must increase it decrease for christ and that was why christ had to come in 1963 swallow he church the old fighters are fighting that they said it is the smoke of aeroplane some people are saying let's not say not to create offense they are already offensive and they must get the offense because they are prone to offence but blessed are those who are not offended in the gospel of righteousness if you feel offended it is your personal headache backsliders sinful souls i'm making issues out of the mystery cloud whether you like it or not it was our lord up there you generations of old fighters children you must fill up the cup of your fathers you are not doing anything new we expected you and you came it's a further proof that the message is the truth [Applause] if this message parallels that of moses it must have everything moses heard amen moses ministry suffered implosion an explosion explosion from pharaoh implosion from dayton quran and aberrant dating quran and abirah there were enemies within they created earthquakes from within they claimed to be believers these guys claimed to have preached the message for 40 something years what a credential but it is not in the beginning it is not how much you wrong it is how much you can endure to the end the reward is for those who finish who finish the line but the grace of god we shall finish all of us are still in the race nobody has arrived but by the grace of god god keeping us like this keeping us standing with the world we shall arrive [Applause] backsliding generation sinful man it's too late you can't dissuade us look at it since you have started your destruction how many converts have you taken out of the message for everyone that leaves the message because they have your material they are like you god is bringing 10 20 people we keep baptizing souls hallelujah and you are fighting a man who is supposedly not alive amen you are finding a messenger who is not presently here even in debt is defeating all of you you claim to know the truth and you are righteous but the very first thing is that your leader your wife started wearing trousers is that what you want those who believe you are even worse than pentecostal you never believe nothing your wife started becoming abundables with your daughters backsliders hallelujah somebody has got us age i'm sorry if you feel bad about it somebody has got to say it truth doesn't make you popular but it will give me narrations it will give me heaven god the whole world against me convey i will preach the message i will stand by age i'm not a sympathizer i'm a believer amen when it decrease brought your god bless you for dispensation of efficiency when it decreased the one who increased was the lord jesus christ what happened the ministry of moses gave way to the ministry of christ because only christ can place you and bring you to perfection brother abraham according to revelations 2 revelations 3 was it 14 a 14-21 was a messenger to laudacian age but when he wanted to tell you the ministry that would bring you to ephesian age efficient blessing it went into revelation 10. and came back to revelation 6 is dear in the quotations what is revelations is opening of the seals the seals of god will be opened and the seals have been opened the open seals is your inheritance amen and in revelation 10 he brought the open book and he made it available to you as the john of this hour in order to do what in order to eat [Music] are you catching it now when it decreased and the mighty angel appeared the ring of mystery appeared amen what was the testimony of the prophet i don't care about the testimony of sinners i care only for the testimony of the messenger that is who was sent to me if those guys were sent to you listen to them i'm reckoning with who was sent to me amen the testimony of the prophet was and it was our lord up there and that god supernaturally came down during the service to tilt this picture amen to how it should be before now we used to turn it like this and the spirit of lord said tonight this way and the prophet said only god knows the right angle and when it was turned correctly two eyes became visible nose and mouth became visible the prophet screamed oh it was our lord up there that was who he decrees for [Applause] and what was their commission they brought the revelation of the seven cells through the angels that form the cloud oh glory to god if you don't believe the cloud experience you can never be truly converted you can never come into adoption coach me anywhere because the ministry till that day was a ministry of preparation the ministry of science and wonders the healing ministry it wasn't it was a ministry for all congregation amen the the ephesians need more than that our congregation brought in the pentecostals and that was the climax that was the end of laodicea age for the seed of god to come out of loudesia they need the thoughtpool they need the opening of the seals which is the revelation of the entire bible to the undenominated bride to those who carried the seed of god by predestination according to the book of ephesus when they begin to hear such things the bible becomes a new book they will come out [Applause] and they came out they came out what is the evidence hi you all of us we came out glory to god we knew the message that will perfect us amen it is beyond signs and wonders those things we see follow us it was beyond we don't have the move of god which move do you don't have the greatest move is the message of the hour the greatest move is the revelation of the watch divinely revealed mystery truth the entire bible revealed to walk upon you to regenerate you from glory to glory to make sense out of a sinner to make victory out of a failure to make courage out of despair hallelujah to bring you personally the assurance of salvation to give you identity and when you receive the kingdom you receive all the kingdom's blessings that is why we don't run after signs the signs follow us the signs shall follow those that believe and they are following us we are casting out demons we are healing the sick we are raising the dead with that ants are straightened out deaths here have been non-stop tumors are disappearing oh deaths have been raised cancers are disappearing here's a testimony your wife all the lumps that was tumor that was they said was malignant disappeared the sister is here seated the lord is doing his work we have come to a point in our life we know he can do all things we respect his sovereignty if he chooses not to do it it doesn't mean he cannot do it but he told he never told us to where which one did we do or not he told us to only believe he told us to ask we will keep asking and we will stand upon it and he will keep doing as he desires don't ever disappear don't ever be discouraged only believe all things are possible where is there no move there is move of gods [Applause] sinners are coming to christ backsliders are restoring those who haven't been citizens are having victories and he said things are not taking place come and church you love him you love him from that point that the angel came down oh man they told him go back you were in the west it was a setting of the song for loud this year but now go back to east because it should be the rising of the sun for the ephesians the real elect from among the crowds the god will come out by that hallelujah and we begin to feast on eternal things and the body said our the prophet said in the message it is the rising of the sun our body begin to respond to each he said this body cannot be delivered but we receive a power that put it under subjection and he said that is why whatever the word says we are just so each we are just to it we are losing our whole identity we are coming to new creature identity we are testifying in our lives that if any man be in christ is a new creature all things are indeed passed away because we are witnesses of the change taking place in our system the word is healing the word is delivering the word is setting free the law oh man the word is blessing the word is provided the word is satisfying us the word is becoming our eternal portion it's getting real and real we are connecting with where we are going that blessed land is becoming real and we are more than willing to give up anything for the sake of the kingdom hallelujah it's a major deliverance guess what i write down with this thoughts the prophet said when those angels came and they brought those truths by the unction of christ god still needed him amen to by that revelation set the church in order announce our efficient economy and give us the message of our pleasing that was why god never took him early 63. he witnessed it and the truth was deposited in its earthen vessel to bless the church to place the fivefold to bless the families amen that was why we have the correctness the truth of marriage and divorce the truth of serpentine you say has been preached before watch the trail everything came to perfection by the teaching of the world through the angel of the lord that came down and this is the reason the prophet said my bible in my hand became watch did he say so oh it should be sinful for you not to say he didn't say that he said my bible became a new book in my hands hallelujah he said he said we have said things before that we need to pull back we need to reverse back and put real lives on edge it talked about 70 weeks of daniel he told us now it remains three and a half years he talked about those living creators that even the prophet himself had called some of them had called the white house writer jesus christ by better understanding and revelation for whom it decreased for the ministry of christ that took over he said now we know better it is satan in his deceptive form coming to the church you cannot tell me that seven seal was not a blessing it brought the capstone blessing it brought the correctness and the perfect truth of marriage and divorce and all the other blessings which you need to come into your full blessing this was the efficient church of the bible heart and this is what these last day ephesians will have in order to come into their full inheritance and as we feast on this we'll be punished yeah that's my closing shot you will be tried you will be tempted you will be cleansed you will face challenges sometimes your business will fail for god to test your love for him i have no time i could read it out of the coach you say business faith god allows it to pudge you because you need character to carry the blessings that are ahead a wonderful time is ahead the prophet said it is the efficient church that will fulfill mark 11. it is the efficient church that will speak to the mountains it is the efficient church that will speak the need of the believers among themselves it is that church that his brother will say i need dream that will give him reign it is a vision church that will speak cancer out of existence it is the efficient church that will bring grain for his brother it is a vision church that would demonstrate the power of spoken word it wasn't the preserve of the prophet alone it was waved as the first chief to create faith in you and i for a perfect return because before they fall in genesis that was who you are you speak and everything obeys you will come into that dominance you will come into that domain you will come into that blessings if you feel we are that part of the church way man whoever lives with the coming of the lord amen you are that part of the church that will put a capstone on all the sins of all ages they without us cannot be brought to perfection you are the perfection of that church and because you are going to carry a great blessing god must pudge you you must know what to do with the gift of god character is not a gift it is a watch is a watch it's a victory for every higher ground for every higher possession there must be pudging there must be cleansing that is why god will allow the devil to attack you like he did rule just to watch your action just to watch your manner and after those challenges are gone you will stand pure as the god of god god will set you aside amen he may not be all everybody who look forward to it is part of it but those of us who live till that hour will have more more demonstration the prophet said the antichrist is tightening up the antichrist is tightening up to bring out the best in us this is not the age of massacre it is not an ox age it is flying eagle age when the enemy comes like a flood the standard they'll be raising this age is for us to match him is for us to match him there is going to be a pressure that will give us a press until we are almost preserved the efficient church will be ready to demonstrate the thoughtful then he said watch the thoughtful then a great time lays ahead we aren't going to live here without some sort of display and it should be the church of ephesians but before the display we must eat much more things we must eat bones we must eat things that we robert make believe that we take pretty nature that will take peter living that with the pretty tendencies that will bring us into that masterpiece that we that we have femme to us where the sons of the most are and when that our king will not be a casualty will be a fixture those are the efficients it is their time and they will enjoy it they will display it shalom to the bride of christ [Music] lord i worship you i worship you for your name is holy holy [Music] lord for your name is holy for your name is holy [Music] i enter i enter the
