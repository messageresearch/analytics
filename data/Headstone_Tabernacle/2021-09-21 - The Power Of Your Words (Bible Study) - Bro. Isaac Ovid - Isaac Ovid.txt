just bow our heads for word of prayer our gracious heavenly father we come tonight lord gathered in this virtual setting not having a clear understanding that where there are two lord of three gathered in your name lord there you are in the midst of them so father we come tonight the lord as a body of believers lord with faith in our hearts lord to believe that anything is possible lord and all things are possible lord may you touch the hearts minds the lives of every son and every daughter that's here lord i don't believe that anyone is here by accident tonight i don't believe anyone is here by chance tonight but lord it is predetermined that we are here lord and we are in this room tonight because we understand that we have to keep looking into the word so we can line up with this word father so help us tonight lord as we go into your scriptures during this bible study this time when we can have a conversation around your word lord may you speak to us lord in the way that only you can we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen and amen well certainly a great privilege to be back here tonight in our time of conversation around the world our bible study and certainly appreciate one and all for taking the time and making the effort uh to be here and it is a sacrifice but beyond the sacrifice it is a responsibility it is an understanding it is a commitment and it's not a commitment to impress anybody it's not a commitment to please anybody it is a responsibility and a commitment to the destiny of your soul of your household of your life you know and i think many times we underestimate how much our activities have a role to play in our destiny how much our thoughts our words our actions have an impact on us and the things around us you know and in fact by the grace of god this study tonight is you know many times you go through different experiences and then you find the answers to it in the word you know and it kind of shocks you it shakes you it sort of reminds you of how important some of these things are and as believers and ideas see as message believers it is really important for us to understand that the whole purpose of the message was to open the bible that is in and of itself is a deep understanding because the bible is a closed book without the ministry of that great elijah prophet but when you have access to the open book you could go in there and relook at things that you may have assumed or we look at things you may have read and catch a deeper understanding to prepare us for the rapture to prepare us for the resurrection to prepare for walking in perfection as god would say to abraham walk before me and be perfect you know so i want to challenge and encourage us tonight as we go into this simple study i don't know how long i will be i am here tonight at my post of duty as it were i was sharing with brother ovid um this evening uh my body is on a little pressure but i have a responsibility tonight i wish every single time i come i'm at 100 strength but we don't control these things in life and there are times we report for duty it doesn't matter how we feel it doesn't matter what else is going on but we have a responsibility ahead of us and that's part of of the way god sets things up that time you know so i have a thought tonight and like i would have said before sometimes i you know give a back story and a background before getting into the theme or to the topic but tonight i want to you know get straight to what i want to speak on tonight and it is a topic that i think will help us in so many ways so for a title tonight the power of your words the power of your words we're going to go through a bible study on the power of your words and we're going to read from different places so i trust that you have your bible in a bible study i trust you may have some kind of notepad or some kind of way to kind of remember because unlike other teachings where i would have spent a lot of time in perhaps one specific chapter i do have different places we're going to spend time in and we do have three main areas we will look at but i do think that each of these scriptures are really important for us to take a look at and to see to what extent our successes our failures our victories and our challenges uh of our own doing and more than that really as a result of what we see what we speak to understand how important words are you know and if we take it back to the very beginning the world was created by the spoken word and that it of itself is powerful because we understand that this old prophetic ministry is to bring us back to the spoken word which is the original seed and the same way god would create and say let there be light and let there be you know and and we know what genesis has in it it's the same way down to the end sons have to come into manifestation and be able to speak and the brother adam teaches us that what they speak what they say is going to happen the way they speak it so i want to start firstly just to kind of lay a background before i get into kind of digging into this topic a bit about words and the impact of words and you know before i even get to the scripture words are powerful and words and if you think about it and um today i i was able to drop my daughter by by by her grandparents for a short while today you know so passed over it was babysitting um sort of babysitting today you know when i got back my dad was telling me about how much woods isabel was speaking you know what you were saying and you know um you know as and my dad calls it the birth of language you know as a child begins to connect the dots and words become phrases and sentences and then entire conversations you know and when you really think about it you know words are powerful and they are means of communication in fact out of every creature that god created out of all of the living creations as it were you know no matter how intelligent or how unique different animals are only one you know being as it will was given that ability to speak which is an attribute that until that man was created you know only god was the one who could speak you know and that ability to actually form words as a means of communication but beyond the fact that it is a means of communication we all know that words are powerful words can inspire us words can encourage us words can motivate us words can push us to go beyond what we believe was even possible but words can also discourage us words can depress us someone can say something to you and those words can just take your victory away brother branham would reference someone spoke a blue streak so he was so cautious of who he allowed in his atmosphere if i could use that phrase because he was so conscious of the power of what words can be and the same way god can use words to create and god could could use words to heal and so many ways we see true examples the real question becomes as sons and daughters of god how are we using words because the words we speak and impact our relationships it can impact our families it can impact our businesses it can impact our success or failure how you speak about your business how you speak about your boss how you speak about your country how you speak about you have to realize that for us under the covenant that we are under our words are really powerful so i want to kind of lay a thing there and then i'm going to get a bit deeper as we progress so i trust you come tonight to kind of look at yourself and i find that in studying some of these things it is it becomes very introspective to weigh now carefully and it it makes even more valuable this time that we have together so i'm going to start in hebrews 11. you know we're going to touch a few places but hebrew 11 which is the that is a chapter of faith you know but there's there's one verse in there i want to start with tonight at the foundation hebrews 11 verse 3 through faith so this gives a context because this is the fifth chapter and before and and we will recall that hebrews 11 goes into by faith abraham by faith and it goes through all the heroes of it but before paul and and and i always leave this as a context paul is speaking here to hebrews all right this is not a letter to the romans this is not a letter to the corinthians this is this is a letter to people who were steeped in a deep understanding as it were of of where they came from their heritage and their their tribal origin and on and all of of of these things right so he's speaking and he's laying the foundation by faith abel you know later by fake enough by faith abraham but before he even gets into all of these heroes of faith that they can actually identify with he speaks of through faith so the first reference of theaters that's what he uses is through fate we understand that the worlds plural were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and that itself is really powerful because it speaks right there of two powerful things one is defeat that without faith you can't even have this conversation that's everything because it's true faith we can have an understanding so through faith we understand so our understanding of this thing is based on our faith so if you have no fear tonight you can't even go into an understanding of the things that we're going to discuss all right the foundation of this mystery this revelation this understanding this journey is based on faith so through faith we understand that the words were framed by the word of god and i want you to think of this for a second the word framing framing so words framed by the word of god for anybody who has seen construction in action and you're framing something to do something you're you're creating something i want you to see it more than just god speaking and it's being created because paul gives us a deeper context to the power of god's words he said god's words actually frame the world so to even go deeper i want to relatively amplified and in the amplified it says by faith that is with an inherent trust and enduring confidence in the power wisdom and goodness of god that is the so if you want to want to know what fear paul talking about that day is he fatim by faith that is the inherent trust do we have inherent trust tonight and enduring confidence this is just confidence that don't stop being confident enduring confidence in the power wisdom and goodness of god we understand that the worlds and in the amplified it said universe ages were framed and created and in the amplified it clarifies formed put in order and equipped for their intended purpose by the word of god i wanted to catch this so the word of god when god said let there be it was not just a word just create that word that was released from the mouth of god was able to form was able to put in order and able to equip for its intended purpose everything that god spoke so i want us to understand because i'm not just speaking about the power of words to understand well god speaks it needs to be contextual to our lives because we could speak peace we could speak god jesus spoke to the storm peace be still words affected the environment words affected somebody who was sick and was down healed words lazarus comfort affected someone from one dimension coming into another dimension how are we using our words tonight so i just want to lay this foundation here true fate and i believe if we are here tonight we have faith or our faith is growing our faith is increasing because our faith comes by hearing and by hearing the word of god and here we are focused on seeing what god wants us to see from scripture tonight so that our faith can be rooted in a foundation that we can now go deeper into what we want to get into tonight but i just want to read this part one more time because i think it's really powerful by faith that is with an inherent trust an inherent trust means nobody can really shift that trust in it built in you don't know why you trust god so much it's like inherent trust you may not understand everything but it's inherent it's somehow you can't you can't put words to it but you truly believe this thing is real it's not a powerful a powerful concept paul is speaking about an inherent trust that god is going to heal you and inherent trust that he's going to make a way where there seems to be no way and heroin trusts that he could take impossible situations and make it possible i'm i'm teaching tonight but i feel like i'm preaching an inherent trust and enduring confidence a confidence that don't take vacation a confidence that don't take sick days a coincidence that no matter what a doctor's report says you still have an enduring confidence in the power wisdom and goodness of god we understand that the world's universe ages were framed and created formed put in order and equipped for the intended purpose by the word of god so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible now we're talking about power of your words so we want to make a couple references to see through the old and new testament about this subject about what comes out of our mouth all right so go with me if you can to proverbs 12 and verse 6. proverbs 12 and verse 6. for those who haven't read their bible in a while so these are like a workout it's like a like an exercise moving through scripture we're gonna make a few laps old testament new testament we're gonna make a you know doing like thing we're going back and forth and comfortable comfortable right so proverbs 12 6 says the words of the wicked are to lie and wait for blood but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them and until you begin to look closely you realize that throughout scripture there's this referencing continually of words and the character behind the words now in the amplified that same verse we just read says the malevolent or bad words of the wicked lie and wait for innocent blood to slander that's the amplified but the mouth of the upright will rescue and protect them so we're seeing right here that words could kill words could rescue words could protect anybody with me tonight let's move a little further still in the book of proverbs to chapter 18 and verse 21. we should all know this particular verse of scripture proverbs 18 21 death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof i want to read it one more time death and life are in the power of the tongue so we just said in the previous verse we read we talk about words can kill words can rescue words can deliver words can protect and now we are seeing that death and life are in the power of the tongue and then i love it shall eat the fruit thereof now that second part of this verse few people spend time to really think about it and understand what is being said here so in the amplified it says death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it and indulge it will eat its fruit and bear the consequences of their words so in other words this shall eat the fruit thereof is not positive fruit it is any kind of fruit negative or positive in other words words are also a seed so the life and death of words are a seed that when it comes to fruition will have a fruit in other words are you prepared for the fruit of your words because you could speak positive into your children you could speak positive into your wife into your husband into a situation or you could speak negative and when you speak and there is a fruit out of your results in other words the fruit don't even have to be the same day the same week the same month the same year but you say something to somebody and you reap a harvest at some point and the harvest can be positive i have had people say to me brother isaac something you said five years ago stay with me and help me make certain decisions that is the fruit of a positive statement and you hear people say well my father tell me so and so and i never among to nobody and it took me 20 years to get an open system because the fruit of that statement created a situation so i want us to understand that a lot of the things that we go through in life is as a result of our words if we can get that to resonate and if i could encourage you even the lesson we want to get tonight is we need to stop speaking negative we have to kill it tonight the negative talk the talk of failure the talk of it not possible it cannot happen i cannot make it in the natural world business leaders motivational speakers talk about the the the need of speaking positive i was sharing it but over somebody i heard about not a spiritual person not a religious person and he said his grandmother encouraged him to speak positive every night no matter how bad a day was he had a good day out and no matter how it was and he said that helped frame him for life and set into so much achievements so i was pondering when the bible say let the weak say i am strong it is a contrast there it is a mind-blowing contrast because i could have come in here and said church i am exhausted a white other tired i can't even make and if i spend time digging the hole in a kind of concrete deposition and i cast the floor and by time i don't care moving them but if i come tonight saying listen i've got to make it i've got to do this we got to overcome and you speak whatever the situation in your house my business has to survive my home has to make it my son must be delivered that is that is powerful let the weak the bible not seeing you're not weakening this is mind-blowing it acknowledging the fact that you're in weakness but you are declaring the complete opposite of your present reality isn't that a powerful thing so so this is not saying let me weak say i will be stronger so this is not you seeing i will be strong this is let the weak say i am strong so you are declaring now what god's thoughts about you already are oh i hope this whole year tonight you are declaring in the present what god's perspective the picture that god has when he looks at his picture and he looks at you is two different pictures until you align with his picture i want us to appreciate that god is not trying to get his picture to line up with ours what god wants us for our pity to line up with his so true joel in chapter three he said let the weak say it say i am strong ignore your feelings ignore what's going on and the power of your world just like you say if you shall see it in this mountain it's it's spoken word so let's go on now let's get a little deeper into this thing and this is when by the grace of god as i was looking through the scripture i said i said boy we have some work to do we have some work to do here these are written in red we're going to matthew 12. so this is jesus talking now so this is not not that we are placing different values or different scriptures but we have to acknowledge that when it written in red we need to pay a particular attention because this is jesus himself who take time to pen these things or articulate these things so we could have a context of what jesus himself said now this is a a scripture i know some are aware of it and others really have been spending quality time to look at this carefully yeah matthew 12 31 jesus is speaking here wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but so the fact that there's a but speaks that there is actions or activities or things outside of all manner of sin that god have a real issue with so let's take this slowly now because we need to drive on this road it will get all bumpy there'll be a little turbulence on this flight but we need to get to the other side are we going to make it true all right wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men jesus goes on he says and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever now notice this is again jesus is going after what he's saying i want us to understand the power of words here all right so this is not about belief this is not about even actions this whole conversation jesus is addressing is about speaking all right so verse 32 whosoever speaketh a word not a sentence not a paragraph not write an article not out of a conversation whosoever speaking a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaking against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come i want this to resonate with you to understand the liberty you know they will talk about freedom of speech where does freedom of speech fit in when you bring scripture like this are you free to say what you want against the holy ghost are you really free is there such a thing as freedom of speech when you come into this spiritual realm are you free to speak against the message are you free to speak against the holy ghost are you free to speak against god's word are you free to speak against a brother or sister to how much freedom do we really have to say what we want to say or or think we should see all right so i want this to to help us to grow to understand that our words and we'll see how jesus builds on it all right it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come verse 33 either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit jesus now begins to rip into them now in verse 34 o generation of vipers listen to jesus how can he be an evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speak it so i could tell what's in you by your word by a conversation what would you like to talk about what entertains you i want us to look at this we going somewhere 35 a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringing forth good things and that evil man out of the evil treasure bringing forth evil things verse 36 i want to nail it down here now but i say unto you this one shook even me and i am a kind of fellow who i don't already play around and i i i don't have time with stupidness but this year shook me the bible said but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment you ever think about that every idol would what do you spend time talking about what are the subject of your conversations what do you focus on when you're talking or or doesn't scripture and this is not this is not paul speaking this is not abraham speak again this is not moses speaking this is jesus speaking saying but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment verse 37 for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned now doesn't this suddenly change this whole conversation about the power of our words i want to read those last two verses in the amplified but i tell you on the day of judgment people will have to give an accounting for every careless or useless word they speak for by your words and listen in the amplified it says reflecting your spiritual condition so your word is like a thermometer to god my my mind for by your words reflecting your spiritual condition you will be justified and acquitted of the guilt of sin and by your words rejecting me you will be condemned and sentenced now let's go deeper into the new testament ephesians we're going to go to ephesians 4 verse 29. i hope this is helping somebody tonight because too many of us take the liberty to say what we want about what we want in any kind of way we want and we're actually seeing through scripture that we don't have that license you could get a license to drive a car to drive a truck but you have a license to say what you want how you want and people have they believe that well it's my view and i'm entitled to my opinion really really understand if you consider yourself entitled to your opinion understand that he who liked that tongue because we read the scripture who will love the tongue be prepared to deal with the consequences or the fruit of what you see with your tongue this is challenging us all tonight to rethink how we speak what we say how we address things because we want to be in alignment with what god wants and how he wants us to speak and the subject of our conversations ephesians 4 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth now this is paul addressing the ephesians church this is not current this is not the other churches this is ephesus and we talk about we want another ephesians look at paul's instruction to this ephesus church let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but i know he's telling him what to talk about but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers i want to read it in the amplified because i wanted to be clear to resonate with us do not let unwholesome foul profane worthless vulgar words ever come out of your mouth hey let's say it is sometimes uh what's not he gave me watched i was good at but kena he gave me so vexa you even understand how i was good enough until and die when i tell him this scripture saying do not let unwholesome foul profane worthless vulgar words ever come out of your mouth but only such speech as is good for building up others according to the need and the occasion so that it will be a blessing to those who hear you speak so tell me something friends how come people can tell me the indie message and they can't say something good something nice something kind because this is bible teaching anybody with me am i speaking to anybody this year is like abc thing we dealing with you know we are going into any deep mystery we are going here into the tent we are reaching paul we dealing here with bible teaching that paul said to the church in ephesus left no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying in other words when you're talking encourage somebody you know lift somebody up build somebody up say something nice say something kind say something loyal say something peaceful say something to have somebody know hey you can make it so good to see you things might be rough but you're going to get over that mountain you might be in a valley but keep your head up your redemption draw at night spend time quality time using your words to encourage yourself not negative self-talk positive self-talk i hope this happens by tonight luke 4 22. i'm not going to be too much longer with you luke 4 22 in speaking now so that so so so we went to what jesus said in the book of matthew we went to paul's admonition to the ephesus church or his exhortations in the ephesians church and now we're into luke this is testifying of jesus now so this is the people's view of jesus and i want us to note something about this luke 4 22 luke 4 22. and all bear him witness and wandered at the gracious woods which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this joseph's son so many times we have a reference this statement is not this joseph's son but he is not this joseph's son actually was not in reference to any miracle it was not in references signs and wonders it was in reference to the way jesus spoke and that's powerful so can people identify that you are christian by the way you speak or when you're in work and in the lunchroom you all are printing you're in the middle you know all the baccanal all the gossip all the latest news and people come to you because you are you are the in person you you are the inside track or can people identify you by the way you speak and carry yourself you see that that that young man that young lady that that that that man over there they're different boy they don't they know they're not involved in talking japanese or something don't even go to them with that is that your testimony do people know and and and do people know what they can come and tell you because if you cut off certain things people wouldn't come to you with your finishing them i remember in school students used to say nah i don't want them over that boy not on that kind of thing men making joking squinting no no one tell him that he's nothing nothing nothing or is it that when he any worker in your studio family you they you want to know you want to know as a joke you want to know what you want to know what they're talking about because i wonder yeah one of you left out or worse yet worse yet you are the one carrying the joke you are the one spreading you anyone any again is this christian behavior is this what jesus from all the scripture you read thus far will the real christians stand up or is it that we have some homework to do in what we talk about and the conversations we have and the subject and the way because now we know and and and again the way we speak on the job most of us and i say it you see the church behavior god bless you how are you doing you know but always say i'm too blessed to be stressed you know and you have all these wonderful things and and you could handle that part real good you have a bachelor's degree in that aspect but let something happen in neighborhood and you caught any village in the company and you see a wall next side of you and your language airline enough with the to bless you it's just god bless you and if there's no there's no correlation between the the you that that when nobody from churches are wrong your conversation and god is saying you have to answer i hope that resonates you know for every idol word so everyone mean is account there's a count of idle words it's not a scary thought i want us to recep tonight in them every idol would how many idol words do we have to repent for how many positive words do we have to now break up to hopefully kind of draw them idle words idle conversations anybody with me tonight i don't know i say well because there's a bible study talk about our bible character and we dig up in that thing but here we know we're going into this thing boy idol words words that have an impact on our destiny i want to touch briefly before we close out tonight not too long three examples as it were three passages of scripture to kind of tie this teaching together uh with and i want to kind of focus on on on saying the right thing you know we know the example that brother branham would have given it's a sahati where he was sharing the testimony of the squirrels and as he was sharing it she said he said that's nothing but the truth but iran would have said she said the right thing and god was so pleased he told the prophet teller whatever she asked for she could get it she had a sick family member she was a poor woman but a brandon would have referenced the fact that she had a little bit of money and when she would have paid her tithes the officers say oh gosh why are we why are we allowing her to do that and she have no money at all but ibrahim said he wanted to give her back to her but god stopped him and said don't give it back to her she'll get blessed by the banana and say eventually he saw how it all connected to the kind of person she was and when the opportunity presented itself on brother branham say whatever you ask for you will get you want money you can get it you want your your your family member to be healed you can get it and she said i wanted salvation of my two boys and she got it amber branham said it was triggered by the fact that she said the right thing she used the power of her words to bring salvation to her house do you realize tonight that your words can bring salvation and healing to your family that if you find a way to put the right words together your family's situation could change tonight is not a message about rebuking you or trying to make you feel bad it's about rethinking how can i say things differently to have a different effect be it in your marriage be it with your children be it with your co-workers be it with your neighbor is there a key to saying the right thing that something would unlock in people around you wouldn't that be a wonderful thing if you could find the key to unlock situations because if words can frame the world and if words can bring healing and words can bring peace and words can bring a level of comfort and you could you could release somebody by your words when you say i forgive you you you bring a release to somebody isn't that powerful to understand the power of words so let's go we're going to go to second kings 20. just six weeks is there not going to be too long but i just want you to see something here second kings 20. and we're going to read from verse one in those days and i'm not gonna spend too much time on this we'll do a separate teaching on hezekiah but there are a couple things with hezekiah we want to bring out but this is a different perspective we want to look at this here second kings 20 verse 1 in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet isaiah major prophet the son of amos came to him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live what are what else does say the lord what a statement you don't see the major prophet come to your house hezekiah is king he is sick unto death and the prophet isaiah son of amos came to him and sent him thus said the lord as if when you're sick your mind already be raised hear the prophet come to confirm your deepest fear as it will thus say the lord set that in house and all in other words write your will put things in place you know if you do have money for casket order that all that stuff for those shall die and not live verse two then he turned his face to the wall so this is hezekiah's response and i love it here this is his response to what he heard then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord saying and and this year is mind-blowing in the context here because what we have is the prayer so i want us to go to this and to see where this goes so hezekiah pray say i beseech thee oh lord remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept so and it came to pass a four isaiah so a four is before isaiah was gone out into the middle court now the word of the lord came to him saying turn again so i want us to picture this a man is sick in his room the prophet of god comes and says say the lord write your will because you're gonna die isaiah is walking out of the house before he is going on the middle court so he'll leave the palace yet he's still walking out god tap him and say turn back around go back inside why because hezekiah prayed a prayer with a combination of words that unlock god's response what was thus said the lord god come now and say hold up hold up pull up verse 5 turn again and tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer isn't prayer putting the right words and having a conversation with god you see the power of words i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord and i will add unto thy days 15 years and i will deliver thee so not only did the prayer in other words the words that hezekiah spoke not only brought healing to his body but because of his prayer look at what god did and i will add unto thy days 15 years and i will deliver thee and the city out of the hand of the king of syria and i will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant davidson have you figured out the right combination of words the right approach to god your right approach to any situation if you understand words are key doesn't it now refrain you to say lord help me to say things the right way anybody with me tonight is this helping anybody let's go on now this is a little deeper and it's a bit a bit harder to see because it we preach it but i want us to catch it now let's go to the book of matthew 15. this is the second the last reading for tonight so we are working within a little time here matthew 15 and reading from verse 22. matthew 15 and verse 22 and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil verse 23 look at jesus's first response but he answered her not a word i want us to be in this woman's shoes for a minute she has come from the course obviously on a mission to fight find jesus she is begging for mercy she acknowledges that he's the son of david she makes her petition known and jesus's first response is to not answer her i cannot explain why god did that but i'm not looking at it from god's side because we can't judge him we can't assess him but we can look at this woman because sometimes when we approach god it may feel like here responding and if he ever went through a thing and said like god are responding here we see playing in scripture god a response but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she cried after us so i wanted to watch the progression of this woman so she came and cried unto jesus jesus in response so she said well guess what if jesus is ignoring me i try to i don't bother everybody around jesus ain't so much because and check this out the fact that the disciples have to ask jesus to send her away one would have to believe that they would have tried to tell her oh gosh going on that attempt obviously failed for them to have to come back and say jesus is like we telling her to go but she no go it's like she'll recognize she's not really programmed right now that you're not paying any attention and she is coming after us she would have had to done that in such a way that it brought a level of frustration as it were to his disciples that they felt they have to come back to jesus with the same situation so they come back to jesus saying send her away for she cried after us i want us to understand now the buildup of situations in life and in this teaching you have a woman who has a need a desire a goal a problem or situation it is already clear that she is relentless about getting what she wants she has made it a business to find jesus she has she knows what she is after she knows he could solve the problem his first as it were perception or her belief that you're ignoring her that didn't lead to her the disciples telling them you can't bother jesus your car bother us go away that didn't stop her it became so much that they could handle it they're going back to the board and say boss we have a customer in his store we tell her that you're kanye chicassia but she said shiago in nowhere can you please tell us to leave this store i wanted to see this scenario the boss i want you to picture it imagine you're going to a store you're going to talk to the boss the owner in store you also look at the aim there you go on to all the people the all the customer attendants and you're burning them until they tell you we cannot serve you and it becomes so but it's um they're going to say boss tell her to leave your store please because she not leaving us so when they come back to jesus now and say listen send our way jesus responds for the first time he's had to speak but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel in other words this woman is here asking for something but i wasn't sent for her she is operating outside of the jurisdiction that i'm on the portfolio that i'm responsible for so i want you to see first attempt from her jesus ignored her second attempt she went to the disciples take on the help but they tried to push away she know verse 25 but came she and worshipped him saying lord help me so even after that she asked up him but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs now we have preached this many times and by the ubid would always say if it had facebook and twitter and them kind of things his tweet is viral is what jesus said jesus said she's a dog dad you become a hashtag it's not a trend but she said verse 27. now remember talk about the power of words now i want to bring a contrast between hezekiah and a contract between this woman because this woman wasn't fighting for herself oh lord help me tonight her need was not her own hezekiah's words unlock deliverance for him this woman the need was not her need one of the greatest drivers of human behavior is self-preservation when you are desperate for something for you you will go at length to get it because your life this woman her love for her daughter i wanted to catch us tonight was so great i want you to catch us now so hezekiah's words unlock deliverance for him this woman was trying to get the key to unlock deliverance for her house so i want you to know tonight that you may not even realize that the key to helping your home may very well lie in your choice of words tonight going forward how you speak to your backseating son your daughter how you speak and deal with conflict in the womb i don't have time to go there but a soft answer turns away rat how you respond to situations could unlock doors or close them shut permanently relationships have broken for years because of words until people can't even remember what the words were but it's still not talking but what broke the relationship was something somebody said that was so painful it was worse than a physical infliction of pain because words can get on the inside inside and hurt you more than you can even communicate the level of pain you feel but this woman had a choice the love for her daughter led her to see beyond the statement jesus made so in there i wanted to catch something is your love for your family for your situation for your deliverance your desire big enough to see beyond the tests that god puts in your way and situations because she had every right after all of the resistance she got to say that the last straw are going back home how do we respond because most of us can deal with it we read this but most of us cannot deal with this most of us cannot deal with this situation right here we might think we could because many of us get so upset with things people tell us not only is what jesus saying to her or to from an ultimate somewhat disturbing you know but it is who is also saying it this is jesus speaking now friends i am here tonight not to please nobody it is very important to me that god is pleased the only only check mark i want on my performance on my responsibility on coming tonight if god says this is not what i wanted that has an effect i don't need man's approval god's approval is what matters here it is this woman is standing in front of jesus not her uncle not a family member not somebody you could take talk from when they'd rub off your back this is jesus who is dealing with her and he says it is not fit to take the children's bread and casted a dog effectively calling her a dog that's a perceptually painful situation but power of words look what she unlocks she said truth lord truth yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table then jesus answered and said to her oh woman that old woman is like just saying oh woman you're bullies they're born with something when i want oh woman oh woman great is thy fate be it unto thee even as dog wilt and her daughter was made a wall from that very hour so what unlocked the healing of her daughter it wasn't prayer she simply said the right thing how different would your life be if you really really really work at seeing the right thing could you reach a level of maturity to say the right thing to your neighbor the right thing to your brother you write thing to your co-worker do you write thing to the usher the deacon to a believer to the garbage man but a branch i respect the garbage man it don't matter who it is can we as believers practice to say the right thing let me close over this last scripture reading i trust this has helped us tonight in some way james chapter 3 and i'm closing out with the scripture that led to this whole teaching tonight this is really where i've been trying to go all night long james after three because it really blew my mind when i saw how james looked at this james 3 and we'll see how far we get into this my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation and that statement basically means my brethren don't everybody try to be preachers or teachers because there's great judgment if we teach the wrong thing that's what james in there the judgment that's upon the head of preachers leaders leadership is greater because we have a responsibility to fact check and make sure it's an alignment what god wants so james is reminding my brethren don't try to be teachers knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for in many things we offend all if any man offend not in word the same [Music] is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body i want to read these first two verses in the amplified not many of you should become teachers serving in an official teaching capacity my brothers and sisters for you know that we who are teachers will be judged by a higher standard because we have assumed greater accountability and more condemnation if we teach incorrectly sobering scripture that one verse verse two for we all stumble and sin in many ways if anyone does not stumble in what he says never seeing the wrong thing he is a perfect man fully developed in character without serious flaws able to bridle his whole body and reign in his entire nature taming his human faults and weaknesses this is worthy friends of reading and studying in your own time to let us really soak in i don't think i have time to do full justice to this because i really want to get a certain part that james builds into verse 3. so james is beginning to build a case here against what really impacts your life your future your destiny your purpose your calling on the results he said behold we put bits in the horse's mouth and if you ever see a horse race you will see that they will put something in the horse's mouth along the blinders it's a controlling horse right this is not a modern thing this is a very old tradition he said behold we put bits in the horse's mouth that they may obey us and return about their whole body so james is starting to and you will see through scripture jesus used parables stories metaphors so james is trying for people to see a picture of what he's trying to describe all right he says that behold we put bits in the horse's mouth that they may obey us and return about the whole body so you see in this this small bit that is placing a horse's mouth the control of that bit is actually controlling the entire horse everybody with me verse 4 behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce wins yet they are turned about with a very small helm whether so ever the governor listed all right so that helm is what we call a rudder in a ship it's almost the smallest moving machinery part of the ship so let's read that in the mp5 and look at the ships even though they are so large and are driven by strong winds they are still directed by a very small rider wherever the impulse of the helmsman or the captain determines verse five now let's get to this now even so the tongue is a little member and boasted great things behold how great a matter a little fire timberland verse six and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defiled the whole body and set it on fire the course of nature and it is set on fire of hell so i want to nail down james takes them through a journey in this message saying listen you see how a small bit on a horse can move the whole house the whole house how this small rather than a ship no matter how big the ship is the ship can take wind fierce winds but that small radar could turn the entire ship it could be a big ship a ship of iron a ship [Music] a black ship a blue ship it a dramatic color bishop it don't matter who on this ship wants who in control are the rudder and control leadership it can be a ship of poor people a ship or rich people the same rudder control the ship no matter what kind of ship it is the same way who you are as a person the rudder of your life the bit of your life is your tongue that's real serious let's go on verse seven for every kind of beast and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is steamed and hath been tamed of mankind so in the amplified i want to read this by the ambulance i just said nailed this down we read it uh from who is five in the amplified in the same sense the tongue is a small part of the body and yet it boasts a great thing see by comparison how great a forest is set on fire by a small spark so james is saying a small spark that could burn in a whole forest is like tongue the impact of the tongue on your body and on your life and the tongue is in in a sense of fire the very world of on injustice and unrighteousness this the tongue is set among our members as that which contaminates the entire body and sets on fire the course of our life the cycle of man's existence and is itself set on fire by hell and now he goes on into verse seven for every kind of beast and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is steamed and have been teamed up mankind so you're saying man has been able to tame everything we have been able to build skyscrapers put animals and cages we've been able to do what we want with the planet but it was it but the tongue can no man team man could team lion mankind could do all can go underwater build submarines do all kinds of different things but the tonka no man team it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison you see how we build now into into ready nailing this thing now how powerful your tongues are we almost done they're wet in other words with this same tongue we bless god even the father and dare with curse we men which are made after the simult of god in the amplified it says with it we bless our lord and father and with it because men who are made in the likeness of god with this same tongue with this same tongue depending on the day we meet you you're telling me god bless you see him tongue and he never been any bad day said i will talk to you you know same time james goes on he nailing his dung he said out of the same mouth proceeded blessing and cursing and then he challenged and said my bridging these things ought not so to be so church these things are not so to be in the amplified this verse 10 says out of the same amount come both blessing and kissing these things my brothers should not be this way for we have a moral obligation to speak in a manner that reflects our fear of god and profound respect for his precepts hallelujah almost done verse 11 that a fountain sent fought at the same place sweet water and bitter he said when when he got the fountain again sweet and bitter water you say that that that that don't make sense can the fig tree my bedroom be olive berries could a mango tree bear orange either a vine figs so can no fountain brought you salt water and fresh water anybody with me verse 13 who is a wise man and endured with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom and i'll end there tonight may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word i trust that tonight we can take another look at how we speak what we see the words we use our choice of words if you don't have nothing good to say don't say anything but the bible says see something kind something nice something loyal we need to be very careful with this weapon of a tongue because if we use it in the wrong way not only do we bring destruction to our homes we bring destruction to our souls but if we use it the right way and find the key to unlock situations in our lives and to open the doors then we could truly be blessed and rewarded for seeing the right thing can we bow our heads up with a friend our heavenly father lord a little teaching tonight lord on this subject of the power of our words power of our words lord to see how you were able to speak let there be let there be let there be lord even when you walked in the earth and say lazarus come forth it took the spoken word to create it took the spoken word to resurrect it took the spoken word to bring life lord you spoke so many times here on earth to bring healing to cast out devils lord and through this great message of the hour lord we are back to the spoken word again father help us to be like you lord when they said it's not this joseph's son they were marveling at the gracious words the way you spoke was different from how other people spoke and we too must be different as believers as sons and daughters of the living god we have to speak like the royalty that we are walking into help us to speak like sons and daughters of the living god knowing that we can speak life lord even when you were here you demonstrated the power of your words when you were hungry and you went to the fig tree and you look for food and there was no food there lord and you cursed that tree and said no man eat from thee right there demonstrating that with the word lord you could heal and you could shut down that tree dried up right there lord help us to understand that we could speak life and healing and strength or we could speak destruction help us to speak positive into our lives and into our families into our situations help us to apply like joel lord 310 as it were let the weak say i am strong help us from this day forward to say the right thing to say positive things help us father to find the right words when we pray when we have to speak with our loved ones whenever to speak with our families we could say the right thing we could say not only the right thing but we can say it the right way help us tonight that you strengthen your people and strengthen your children may you bless the service tomorrow night may you bless the special streaming service friday night at 8 pm and lord may you bless the service coming sunday as we
