[12:23] prophet and we have an opportunity for
[12:25] redemption we have an opportunity for
[12:27] your adoption we have an opportunity for
[12:30] perfection for the baptism of the holy
[12:32] ghost to give the devil a run to push
[12:35] back the darkness can the church say
[12:37] amen i don't care if it's five people if

[13:02] minutes

[13:10] services i love the thursday prayer
[13:11] meetings because on a thursday night you
[13:13] see the real church

[13:39] lift him higher
[13:41] lift him higher so that all the world
[13:43] could see can the church say amen
[13:47] hey amen i silly when agreed brother
[13:49] george kangali for the exhortation on
[13:51] thursday night what a blessing
[13:53] what a real real real tremendous
[13:56] tremendous blessing
[13:58] i told him afterwards i said brother
[13:59] george i was blessed
[14:01] you know when he said something that was
[14:03] really it stayed with me you know he was
[14:05] speaking about the parable that jesus
[14:07] gave about the soul that went forth to
[14:09] sow and some fell on the wayside and
[14:11] some fell on the thorny but some fell on
[14:13] good ground and and he brought to my
[14:15] remembrance the fact that he said when
[14:17] he said listen god is not coming to see
[14:20] the seed
[14:22] he sowed the seeds are coming to say
[14:24] what you did with the seed he's coming
[14:26] to see fruit
[14:28] that's what this is all about to see
[14:29] fruit
[14:30] that after all these years there's fruit
[14:32] in your life
[14:33] there's joy in your life there's peace
[14:36] in your life there's victory in your
[14:38] life there's long suffering in your life
[14:41] there's meekness in your life and listen
[14:44] for it to have fruit things have to come
[14:46] against you to make the fruit stand out
[14:49] you have to have something to be long
[14:52] suffering about
[14:53] the situation have to come to pull out
[14:55] the meekness to pull out the humility
[14:58] so count yourself blessed tonight for
[15:00] the situations that god sent your way
[15:04] that you could have some long
[15:06] suffering that he would have patience
[15:08] that you could have virtue
[15:10] glory to god
[15:12] glory to god hallelujah
[15:15] you may be seated
[15:17] we have to reframe how we look at the
[15:20] problems because no problem can come
[15:23] your way unless god allowed it
[15:26] so count yourself blessed because the
[15:28] problem you have is what god allowed you
[15:30] to have to bring something out of you
[15:33] listen god couldn't give your problems
[15:35] to anybody else they couldn't handle it
[15:39] come on brother kangalei god couldn't
[15:41] give your triumph to the person next to
[15:44] you your trial was designed for you
[15:48] your trial is your trial and you are
[15:51] going to overcome you are going to be
[15:53] victorious
[15:59] hallelujah
[16:00] hallelujah
[16:02] glory to khan you may be seated i'm just
[16:05] here to encourage your fate just
[16:08] encourage your faith a little bit so
[16:10] when the pastor comes back he can look
[16:11] at the church and we can say we were
[16:13] good stewards
[16:16] hallelujah
[16:17] understand this
[16:19] we make it seem like the trial and the
[16:21] test is so big and such a problem and
[16:24] god is saying you don't even know the
[16:25] strength on the inside
[16:27] i wanted to give this problem to
[16:29] somebody else and i was looking for
[16:30] somebody to give this
[16:34] glory for a long time i wanted to see
[16:37] somebody go through this kind of thing
[16:38] and still have a testimony like job
[16:41] hallelujah told the skin worms
[16:43] destroying my body yet in my flesh i'm
[16:46] gonna see god
[16:48] doesn't matter what the doctor says
[16:50] doesn't matter what the neighbor says
[16:52] doesn't matter what my wife said doesn't
[16:54] matter what the children say i'm going
[16:56] to serve god anyhow
[17:00] hallelujah
[17:02] glory
[17:08] i will i see some i certainly see some
[17:10] more smiles and i did a few minutes ago
[17:12] so somebody was struggling with a trial
[17:15] somebody was struggling with a problem
[17:17] and i listen if the devil is not
[17:19] attacking you you should be very worried
[17:23] if all hell isn't against you you should
[17:26] be very concerned
[17:27] because all hell is against the elect of
[17:30] god if the devil is not after you you
[17:33] might be on his side
[17:37] but if you woke up this morning and your
[17:39] car didn't want to start
[17:42] and all four tires were flat
[17:44] and there was no power to iron the
[17:46] clothes and you just didn't know how
[17:48] you're going to make it through the day
[17:50] count yourself blessed because the devil
[17:52] is chill trying to stop you and listen
[17:54] if he's trying to stop you it means he
[17:56] hasn't stopped you yet
[17:59] if you're still trying it means there's
[18:01] still some life in you
[18:02] there's still some faith in you they're
[18:04] still ah
[18:06] glory to god
[18:08] hallelujah you may be seated
[18:12] you know son of man look at the soldiers
[18:14] of the cross who've been in the battle a
[18:16] long time and sometimes when you're in a
[18:18] battle a long time you get kind of
[18:19] battle weary
[18:21] get kind of battle scarred you've seen
[18:22] so much fights you've seen so much
[18:25] soldiers fall along the way side you you
[18:27] just almost put yourself in a position
[18:29] where you just buy it in time
[18:33] but i got good news for you to see them
[18:35] there are some people who are just going
[18:37] to barely make it but they're going to
[18:38] make it
[18:40] but the platinum said when you look
[18:41] around heaven you're going to look at a
[18:43] bunch of people who you made it
[18:47] you make
[18:49] i i don't want to say i didn't think you
[18:51] could make it but you made it
[18:55] when it looked like it wasn't gonna make
[18:57] it you're gonna make it
[18:59] when it looked like the honey not gonna
[19:00] stick it don't stick
[19:02] when it looked like the devil got you in
[19:04] the corner there's gonna be your power
[19:06] watch the third pull then
[19:08] watch the power of this church rise
[19:12] glory to god
[19:15] so count yourselves blessed
[19:19] for the specially designed trials
[19:23] god didn't just throw the child he took
[19:24] his time
[19:26] to configure the trial to fit your need
[19:29] so that the best could come out of you
[19:31] because he's going to have a bride that
[19:34] you could say whatever you want about
[19:35] her she's still going to have love you
[19:37] could curse her she's still gonna
[19:39] forgive you could do whatever you want
[19:41] but it's not gonna be seed it's gonna be
[19:43] fruit the fruit will remain the fruit
[19:46] will escape the fruit will be the
[19:47] evidence that you have met jesus
[19:50] can the church say amen
[19:54] i don't know if to finish or have to
[19:55] start preaching
[19:57] but can we stand our feet
[19:59] two portions of scripture we're going to
[20:01] read from the book of ecclesiastes and
[20:03] the book of revelation thank you
[20:04] musicians
[20:07] we're going to read from ecclesiastes
[20:09] chapter 3
[20:11] and verse 1 and we're going to read from
[20:13] the book of revelation
[20:14] chapter 8
[20:18] amen i certainly appreciate everyone
[20:21] here
[20:22] this evening
[20:24] to have the confidence
[20:29] that we are not here to see a man but we
[20:30] are here to see the lord
[20:33] you know i tell people all the time
[20:35] you look in the corporate world
[20:37] you always know when the boss is not in
[20:39] a building
[20:41] there's a certain behavior that people
[20:42] operate with when the boss is not in the
[20:44] building and
[20:46] the holy spirit takes special note
[20:49] how you behave in the past is that in
[20:50] the house
[20:52] because your accountability is not to
[20:55] brother over in the flesh your
[20:56] accountability is to god the holy spirit
[20:59] we're not here to see any man you're not
[21:00] here to see brother over with the
[21:01] anthony myself you hear that hear direct
[21:03] from god
[21:04] we are merely instruments god could use
[21:06] anybody to speak the word because
[21:08] brother branham said one day the right
[21:09] word will be spoken and god could use
[21:12] anybody to speak the word so i commend
[21:14] your fate and your confidence to be here
[21:16] today for these two services and for
[21:18] your prayer and support for the ministry
[21:20] can the church say amen
[21:25] the book of ecclesiastes chapter three
[21:27] and verse one to everything there is a
[21:28] season and a time to every purpose under
[21:32] the heaven
[21:33] a time to be born and a time to die a
[21:36] time to plant and a time to pluck up
[21:39] that which is planted
[21:41] a time to kill and a time to heal a time
[21:43] to break down and a time to build up
[21:46] a time to weep and a time to laugh
[21:49] a time to mourn and a time to dance
[21:53] a time to cast away stones and a time to
[21:55] gather stones together
[21:58] a time to embrace and a time to refrain
[22:00] from embracing
[22:01] a time to get and a time to lose
[22:05] a time to keep and a time to cast away
[22:08] a time to rend and a time to sow a time
[22:11] to keep silence and the time to speak
[22:14] a time to love and a time to hate a time
[22:17] of war
[22:18] and a time
[22:20] of peace and reading from the book of
[22:22] revelation 8 and reading verse 1.
[22:31] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[22:33] there was silence in heaven about the
[22:35] space of half an hour may the lord had a
[22:38] blessing
[22:39] to the reading of his word
[22:41] you may be seated
[22:51] i have a title this evening
[22:55] and my title is
[23:15] breaking
[23:17] the silence
[23:21] my title is breaking
[23:23] the silence
[23:25] and for a subject
[23:26] the spoken word in due season
[23:29] and an inspiration the final voice
[23:32] to the final age
[23:34] and in the message jesus christ the same
[23:35] yesterday today and forever but the
[23:37] madam said it is my humble belief that
[23:39] we're living near the end time
[23:41] oh may i make it a little more personal
[23:43] than that we are living in the end time
[23:45] and i believe it's time for restoration
[23:47] of the church that was promised that god
[23:49] would sin in the last day and i believe
[23:52] that this is the day that when the world
[23:54] has been preached so much and the day
[23:56] has gotten so dark and so evil until
[23:58] according to god's word he was to
[23:59] restore all that the caterpillar had
[24:02] eaten the palmer worm had eaten will be
[24:04] restored back again do you believe that
[24:06] this evening
[24:08] so tonight or this heat we're going to
[24:10] speak a bit about silence because the
[24:12] bible said is a time to keep silence
[24:16] and there is a time to speak
[24:19] there are a lot that's written about
[24:21] silence said that a a fool when he is
[24:24] silent is considered wise
[24:27] because
[24:28] he doesn't say anything that exposes
[24:30] what's really on the inside
[24:33] but silence is defined as an absence of
[24:36] words or an absence
[24:38] of noise
[24:41] you know and uh
[24:43] there was a gentleman by the name of
[24:45] martin nimola who was born in germany in
[24:48] 1892
[24:50] he would later become
[24:52] a famous lutheran pastor
[24:55] and he is best known for how he
[24:56] addressed the issue of silence in his
[24:58] day by his very famous following words
[25:03] and these are his words
[25:04] first they came for the socialists
[25:09] and i did not speak out
[25:11] because i was not a socialist
[25:15] then they came for the trade unionists
[25:18] and i did not speak out
[25:20] because i was not
[25:21] a trade unionist
[25:24] then they came for the jews
[25:26] and i did not speak out
[25:28] because i was not a jew
[25:31] then they came for me
[25:34] and there was no one left
[25:36] to speak for me
[25:39] he was imprisoned
[25:41] in concentration comes from 1937
[25:44] to 1945
[25:46] for coming against the german nazi
[25:48] regime
[25:50] he narrowly escaped execution and barely
[25:53] survived imprisonment
[25:56] but after his imprisonment he expresses
[25:58] deep regret about not having done enough
[26:02] to help the victims of the nazis
[26:06] he regretted that he had been silent
[26:09] about something that he had the power to
[26:11] speak
[26:12] up about
[26:14] tonight we want to speak about breaking
[26:17] the silence
[26:19] now there are different types of silence
[26:21] there's a silence that exists
[26:23] as a result of fear you become so afraid
[26:25] that
[26:26] you're afraid to speak
[26:28] there is a silence that exists as a
[26:30] result of shame you feel so embarrassed
[26:33] you're afraid to speak
[26:35] there is a silence that exists because
[26:37] of ignorance you just don't know so you
[26:40] stay silent you don't know quite what to
[26:42] say
[26:43] there is a silence that exists as a
[26:45] defense
[26:48] you don't want anybody to reach you so
[26:49] you are silent you put up these walls
[26:53] in your job walls in the church these
[26:56] walls of silence that exist
[26:58] that nobody could reach you for some
[27:00] people silence
[27:02] is an offense
[27:04] i'm going to give him the silent
[27:05] treatment
[27:06] i'm not going to talk to him for a week
[27:08] two weeks
[27:09] silence used
[27:11] as a weapon
[27:13] yes there is a time to keep silent
[27:17] but it's also
[27:18] a time for us to speak
[27:21] we have all been in our own moments of
[27:24] silence
[27:25] in situations in our life when all we
[27:28] needed to hear
[27:30] were the right words
[27:32] to break the silence
[27:34] words like it's going to be all right
[27:37] that's all we would have needed to hear
[27:39] to break the silence in our lives words
[27:42] like god will make a way
[27:45] words like
[27:46] all things work together for good
[27:49] words like it's only a test
[27:52] word like you can't give up now there
[27:54] you are sitting in a room all by
[27:55] yourself in your moment of silence but
[27:58] the right word comes across to break
[28:00] that silence and that word comes as a
[28:03] deliverance to you and many of us we
[28:05] lived our life in silence until a word
[28:08] came to us to pull us out of that
[28:10] silence
[28:13] the silence was almost evidence it would
[28:16] seem that nothing was going on because
[28:18] where there is something going on
[28:19] there's usually some kind of noise
[28:21] where there is activity there is usually
[28:23] somebody talking but in your life before
[28:26] this word came to you there was only
[28:29] silence
[28:31] many of our daily struggles the failures
[28:34] we face the pains and the
[28:35] disappointments we go through
[28:38] are because we are silent
[28:42] we are afraid of doctors and it's
[28:44] something very interesting
[28:46] you know there are people who have real
[28:47] phobias of doctors
[28:50] and they rather suffer in pain
[28:53] than tell anybody that they're in pain
[28:57] they are so afraid of going to the
[28:58] hospital that they keep the pain locked
[29:00] up inside and they suffer in silence
[29:04] many of us in the church we don't want
[29:06] the pastor to know
[29:08] so we suffer
[29:10] in silence
[29:12] but there's a reason the bible says if
[29:14] you shall say to this mountain
[29:17] be thou removed
[29:19] you will have what you asked for
[29:21] there something happens when you begin
[29:24] to speak
[29:25] that's why the bible says let the weak
[29:27] see
[29:28] i am strong
[29:31] you can be strong but unless you speak
[29:33] it you will stay in weakness because you
[29:35] are living
[29:37] in silence
[29:38] you have to know when it's time to be
[29:41] silent and and when it's time to speak
[29:44] even more real to us there are some of
[29:47] us we love to talk about all the wrong
[29:49] things but the right things we're silent
[29:52] about
[29:53] we talk about the politics and we talk
[29:55] about the world of fears and we talk
[29:57] about all these things we are silent
[29:59] about talking about getting back to the
[30:01] altar of prayer we are silent about
[30:03] trying to fix up the marriages we are
[30:05] silent about making a church to make a
[30:08] revival it's easy to talk about the
[30:11] sports and talk about the movies
[30:13] thousands and talk about the
[30:14] entertainers but when it comes about
[30:16] what brother branham said we want to
[30:18] stay silent i'm saying church the time
[30:21] has come for us to break the silence
[30:32] can the church say man
[30:34] i want to encourage you church
[30:36] as we prepare to take communion don't
[30:38] struggle
[30:39] in silence
[30:41] don't go to your pain in silence
[30:44] the bible says in james 5 and verse 16
[30:47] confess your faults in other words don't
[30:50] sit there in silence confess your fault
[30:52] one to another and pray one for another
[30:56] that he may be healed we have too many
[30:58] people silent in the church
[31:03] you cannot be silent and have a prayer
[31:05] life they are complete polar opposites
[31:08] we need to move from being silent to you
[31:10] are so much in communication with god
[31:13] god is like is is he calling again
[31:16] is he calling again is he calling again
[31:19] every day he's on the phone why because
[31:21] your need is so great is there anybody
[31:23] in the church wants to break the silence
[31:33] i pray this to you
[31:35] on the inside
[31:38] how many times you walk past somebody
[31:40] maybe you walk downstairs maybe you walk
[31:42] to your car and you look at somebody and
[31:45] and you know all is not well but
[31:47] you stay silent
[31:50] you go to your car
[31:52] you start you drive off and
[31:54] in a few moments you have missed an
[31:56] opportunity
[31:58] to say a word to somebody
[32:01] that could be jesus speaking to them
[32:03] through you
[32:05] but we stay silent
[32:07] silence for some of us is the product of
[32:10] our selfishness
[32:12] we get so concerned about our situation
[32:14] that we don't want to talk
[32:17] to anybody we don't want to testify to
[32:19] anybody but jesus went to peter and
[32:21] found him and said listen come come come
[32:23] stop talking to the fishes
[32:26] i want you to talk to somebody i want
[32:28] you to testify to somebody i want to
[32:30] break the silence in your life
[32:32] so that you could be just like me can
[32:34] the church say amen
[32:38] first john 1 9 says if we confess our
[32:40] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[32:43] us our sins
[32:46] this something happens when you break
[32:48] out of the silence and to cleanse us
[32:50] from all unrighteousness
[32:52] listen demons don't want to be exposed
[32:54] so they hide
[32:57] in silence
[33:01] that's one of the reasons people can't
[33:02] really worship and they really can't
[33:04] break through because there's a demon
[33:05] saying don't say nothing
[33:07] don't say nothing that's why the prophet
[33:09] always says you want to be healed stand
[33:11] up
[33:13] do something
[33:14] because listen speaking could be not
[33:16] just verbal speaking because brother
[33:18] branham taught us your life speaks
[33:20] your actions speaks louder than your
[33:22] words so when you begin to do something
[33:24] about your situation you are beginning
[33:26] to break out of your silence when you
[33:28] begin to do something you haven't done
[33:30] in a long time you haven't lifted up
[33:32] both your hands you used to lift in one
[33:33] hand all of a sudden
[33:39] you are breaking the silence
[33:42] you are breaking the silence because
[33:44] your worship is a noise to god in heaven
[33:47] somebody say man
[33:52] we are here tonight to break the silence
[33:55] in this church to break the silence in
[33:57] your life to break the silence
[34:00] can the church say amen
[34:03] but isaac i've never heard someone like
[34:05] this preach
[34:07] and neither have i
[34:10] but i'm doing what he told me to do
[34:13] we have people with jealousy
[34:16] hiding in silence
[34:19] hatred
[34:20] hiding in silence
[34:22] fornication
[34:24] hiding in silence
[34:26] adultery
[34:27] hiding in silence greed
[34:30] hiding in silence selfishness hiding in
[34:33] silence but we are here to break the
[34:35] silence so deliverance could come to
[34:37] your house deliverance can come to your
[34:40] door
[34:46] don't be silent to your wife about your
[34:49] love
[34:52] you have a silent love
[34:55] your love is never expressed verbally
[34:57] never expressed by action you're
[34:59] silently in love
[35:02] that's when you're in a secret admirer
[35:04] status
[35:05] but you can be married and tell me
[35:07] you're silently in love
[35:11] can the church say amen
[35:13] you're loving in silence you're
[35:14] respecting in silence wives reverencing
[35:17] their husband in silence no evidence of
[35:18] the of respect no
[35:21] in silence but we hit a break
[35:24] the silence
[35:26] but let's take it just a little deeper
[35:28] i'm not going to be too long with you
[35:30] this is one of those thought provoking
[35:31] messages heart searching messages
[35:36] deeper than the silence we experience is
[35:39] is almost i could say the flip side of
[35:41] it
[35:42] when it would appear it would seem as if
[35:44] god is silent
[35:47] and that is the more profound of an
[35:49] issue
[35:50] that people have to wrestle with and
[35:52] deal with
[35:53] not too long ago a brother called me on
[35:56] the phone and i had to go and meet him
[35:58] because he asked a deep question he's
[35:59] like
[36:00] brother isaac
[36:05] where's the
[36:06] outpouring of the power
[36:11] where's the cripples walking
[36:14] is god silent
[36:17] where is the manifestation we have
[36:19] longed for
[36:21] and how many times in your life you
[36:24] journey and you struggle and you peed
[36:25] and you ask yourself the question
[36:28] where is god in this
[36:31] and it might seem as if
[36:33] god has gone silent
[36:36] you pray and you pray and you pray and
[36:38] it would seem as if you get no answer
[36:42] and when you read the prophet's messages
[36:43] you would recognize that he expressed
[36:45] similar sentiments of him calling out to
[36:47] god and god where are you
[36:50] him looking for god to move a certain
[36:52] way and he's like
[36:53] where is the response for five years
[36:58] god pulled the rug from under him
[37:01] one time when the random said he saw the
[37:04] angel of the lord
[37:06] he hadn't seen him for six months
[37:09] he came in he turned around and he
[37:11] walked away
[37:18] it makes you wonder sometimes what god
[37:20] is doing in that moment
[37:22] of silence
[37:26] be a sword this evening if you ever
[37:28] wonder that god is a god who understands
[37:30] silence
[37:32] because at times he is a god of silence
[37:36] but silence doesn't mean he's not
[37:38] present
[37:40] silence and absence are two different
[37:42] words
[37:44] so when it seems as if he's not speaking
[37:46] don't make no mistake about it he's
[37:48] still here
[37:53] can the church say amen
[37:56] god is always with us
[37:58] he's always working and god will always
[38:01] keep his
[38:02] promises could you take some more
[38:07] and as you look through the scripture
[38:09] and true by the pranam's message
[38:11] we find something very interesting
[38:14] it's a great drama that has been
[38:16] unfolding and a great drama could only
[38:19] have a great director
[38:22] and every great director knows how to
[38:24] use sound and music and silence to
[38:28] create the right effect
[38:31] if you ever see a drama where there's
[38:32] always noise it becomes boring after a
[38:35] while because you have to create a
[38:37] moment of silence so that when the sound
[38:39] comes back it catches you a certain way
[38:44] anybody knows what i'm talking about
[38:46] so dear in genesis god wanted to
[38:49] make a special type of appearance so he
[38:52] created everything before he even
[38:54] created he just had what he had was just
[38:56] a moment of silence
[38:59] and out of the silence he spoke
[39:02] and said let there be
[39:05] so before the spoken word there was
[39:08] silence
[39:10] before there was let there be there was
[39:12] a moment of silence
[39:14] so i want to see it tonight that before
[39:16] there's a spoken word in your life
[39:19] there's going to be some silence before
[39:21] that
[39:22] there's going to be some darkness before
[39:24] that there's going to be a period of
[39:25] calm before that because god don't want
[39:28] the devil to know what's about to happen
[39:29] in your life can the church say amen
[39:34] and after god finished do everything for
[39:36] the first six days on the seventh day
[39:40] there was silence
[39:43] god went back to silence
[39:45] on the seventh day he rested
[39:47] can the church say amen
[39:50] and through the bible we see many
[39:52] examples in the days of noah
[39:54] god was watching everything unfold and
[39:56] he was silent until he just couldn't
[39:58] take it anymore
[40:01] he had watched man just become worse and
[40:03] worse until he could not take it anymore
[40:05] and god was forced to break his silence
[40:09] he had watched for a long time until he
[40:11] found the right man that he could use
[40:14] to do what he needed in that day and he
[40:15] found noah and god broke his silence
[40:18] somebody's saying man i'm building to
[40:20] something church in the days of more on
[40:23] the days of moses there was 400 years of
[40:26] silence 400 years of bondage when they
[40:29] knew there was a prophecy and i could
[40:31] imagine there were young people saying
[40:33] are you sure god is going to deliver
[40:35] are you sure we're going to get free
[40:37] from this because my grandfather he died
[40:39] a slave my father he died of a slave my
[40:42] great-grandpappa died a slave are you
[40:45] telling me there's still going to be a
[40:46] deliverer for 400 years of prophecy
[40:49] hovered over them and they were living
[40:51] on the silence they were working on the
[40:53] silence but they came a day that god
[40:55] decided to break the silence
[40:59] hallelujah church we're not going to
[41:01] have silence all the time it's not going
[41:04] to be calm all the time it's not going
[41:06] to be quiet all the time but if branham
[41:08] said the pride hasn't had a revival yet
[41:10] all these years we've been waiting on
[41:12] the silence for a seventh on the revival
[41:15] i've got news for you this evening it's
[41:18] coming god is about to break his silence
[41:21] once more the world will hear direct
[41:24] from god can the church say amen
[41:34] moses
[41:35] killed a man and went running and hiding
[41:38] for 40 years with the george he lived in
[41:40] silence
[41:41] there was no word there was no prophecy
[41:43] there was no prophet there was no
[41:44] encouragement he was just living in
[41:46] silence waiting for the appointed time
[41:49] for the silence in his life to be broken
[41:52] there was silas in gideon's life there
[41:54] he was
[41:55] working hard and wondering where is god
[41:57] and all the miracles and god broke
[41:59] interrupted the silence of his life and
[42:02] said almighty man of hell i've got
[42:04] something for you can the church say
[42:06] ma'am the children of israel were pinned
[42:08] down by goliath there was noise in the
[42:11] camp of the philistines and the children
[42:13] of israel were all cried but god had
[42:15] somebody who could break the silence up
[42:18] here comes little david a little nobody
[42:21] he was too small for the army but he
[42:23] broke the silence and asked the question
[42:26] who is this uncircumcised fillers time
[42:28] trying to defy the armies of the living
[42:31] god is there somebody in the church of
[42:34] the living god that's ready to break the
[42:36] silence up for a long time we have
[42:39] waited for such a time as this but god
[42:41] is raising up an army in this tape to
[42:44] break the silence
[42:48] hallelujah
[42:49] i feel tonight if i hold my piece up the
[42:53] rocks are going to cry out i'm not going

[45:55] place you know what the bible says the
[45:57] dumb will sing search for it there's a
[45:59] script that says the dumb will sing
[46:01] listen there are people who could speak
[46:03] that don't know how to sing so when my
[46:04] bible tells me that the dumb will make
[46:07] the choir brother
[46:12] the dumb will jump to singing
[46:18] brother i feel so excited to know that
[46:20] there's coming a time when the bride
[46:22] will have a voice it will not be her
[46:24] voice but it'll be his voice because she
[46:27] will only say what he once said and when
[46:30] she speaks he backs it up god what a
[46:33] time for the silence to be broken listen
[46:37] you may be seated
[46:42] under the silence
[46:43] it would seem as if your son
[46:46] has no hope
[46:47] your daughter
[46:48] has no hope
[46:50] no god moving in their lives but in that
[46:53] season when the silence breaks and you

[47:02] brother branham he broke the silence in
[47:05] her life she had been praying for a long
[47:07] time
[47:08] because that listen listen remember the
[47:10] branham spoke to her and he asked her
[47:12] you said the writing what do you want
[47:14] she said what was on her heart what was
[47:16] in her mind this was something that was
[47:18] a burden to her i don't know how long to
[47:21] sahati was praying for her two boys i
[47:24] don't know how many times she fasted for
[47:26] her two boys and maybe she felt like god
[47:29] wasn't gonna answer maybe she felt like
[47:32] she just turned him over the lord and
[47:34] she was gonna happen but that day was
[47:37] the right tape for the silence in her
[47:39] life to be broken because remember
[47:41] branham said i give you your two boys
[47:44] that was the answer she had prayed for
[47:47] for all those years and the silence in
[47:50] her life
[48:03] if i hold my peace
[48:05] the rocks
[48:07] they're going to be forced to cry out
[48:09] i'm not going to hold my peace anymore
[48:12] i'm not going to hold my peace anymore
[48:15] there will be no peace with the enemy
[48:17] there will be no peace for the enemy
[48:19] trying to take our young men there will
[48:21] be no peace with the enemy trying to
[48:24] take over young women there will be no
[48:26] peace with the enemy trying to break up
[48:28] marriages i'm not going to hold my peace
[48:31] i'm going to speak against it because i
[48:33] know once it's the word of god god's
[48:35] word cannot return void so i'm not gonna
[48:39] hold my peace i'm not gonna hold my
[48:41] peace i'm gonna break the silence and
[48:44] speak against it we will seek against
[48:46] sin we will speak against doubt we will
[48:49] speak against fear and watch it
[48:51] disappear can the church say amen
[48:59] hallelujah
[49:00] could you take some more
[49:02] hallelujah
[49:06] there is a time
[49:09] to keep silent
[49:11] and there is a time
[49:14] to speak
[49:17] the old testament closes
[49:20] with words
[49:22] that hold very special meaning to us
[49:25] the last two verses
[49:28] of the old testament
[49:30] malachi 4
[49:32] verses 5 and 6
[49:34] behold i will send you elijah the
[49:36] prophet
[49:37] before the coming
[49:39] of the great and dreadful day of the
[49:41] lord
[49:42] and he shall turn the heart of the
[49:44] fathers to the children and the heart of
[49:46] the children to their fathers lest i
[49:48] come
[49:48] as mighty earth
[49:50] with a curse
[49:53] after these prophetic words
[49:55] there was a period of great silence
[50:01] for 400 years
[50:04] there was silence
[50:06] for 400 years there was
[50:08] no message from god
[50:10] for 400 years no prophet arose to give
[50:14] god's word for 400 years no angels
[50:16] visited with a word from god there was
[50:18] just
[50:19] silence
[50:21] like the calm or the stillness before
[50:23] the storm
[50:24] there was just silence
[50:26] until god decides
[50:28] to break his silence
[50:31] hallelujah amen
[50:34] here we find
[50:36] after malachi the
[50:38] story switches to zechariah
[50:41] and his wife elizabeth
[50:44] and they are suffering two pains
[50:47] the pain is not from one sources two
[50:49] pains
[50:50] they are suffering on the one hand
[50:53] because they are part of a nation
[50:55] that it seem that if god has abandoned
[50:57] them
[50:59] after all that they have went through
[51:01] through the later years before jesus
[51:03] through the hands of the of the greeks
[51:05] and the mids and the persians and the
[51:06] babylonians they have now fallen into
[51:08] the hands of the romans
[51:11] and the people to whom god had said
[51:12] wherever you put your foot is yours and
[51:15] slay all the amalekites and the hittites
[51:17] and the jebusites here they were
[51:18] oppressed
[51:20] by the romans after 400 years
[51:24] of silence i could imagine that way down
[51:27] on every jew at that time
[51:30] as they wondered where is god
[51:33] beyond that problem that zechariah and
[51:35] elizabeth had they had their own
[51:38] personal grief
[51:41] they were childless
[51:43] and as they got older they had almost
[51:45] resigned themselves to accepting this
[51:48] might just be our lot
[51:50] and i can imagine elizabeth had lived
[51:52] for a long time with the shame and
[51:54] disgrace of being barren
[51:57] that was what defined her her barrenness
[52:00] they didn't call her elizabeth the cake
[52:02] maker
[52:03] elizabeth who cooks a good palau
[52:05] elizabeth who makes nice stew chicken
[52:07] this was elizabeth
[52:09] the childless
[52:11] whether they said it to her or not this
[52:12] is how she felt because it was it was
[52:15] real to her
[52:16] zachary zechariah agreed because he had
[52:18] no one to follow in his footsteps
[52:21] and i could imagine they prayed
[52:23] zechariah being of the priesthood
[52:26] he was a spiritual man he prayed and he
[52:28] cried for a child but there seemed to be
[52:30] no son
[52:31] but after 400 years of silence while
[52:34] zachariah is doing his priestly duty he
[52:36] is visited
[52:38] and you still listen god has answered
[52:41] your prayer
[52:42] what a way to break the silence
[52:45] with an angel saying don't worry all the
[52:47] prayers that you've been praying for all
[52:48] these years for the holy ghost god has
[52:50] answered your prayer
[52:52] you have been praying for all these
[52:53] years for a breakthrough don't worry god
[52:56] has heard your prayer
[52:58] why have you come gabriel i've come to
[53:00] break the silence
[53:01] i have come to break the silence for all
[53:04] these years it seemed as if nothing was
[53:05] moving but i've come to break the
[53:07] silence
[53:12] and god breaks the silence
[53:15] by speaking to mary through the angel
[53:17] gabriel
[53:19] and that's how
[53:22] jesus enters into the picture
[53:26] can the church say amen
[53:29] so friends don't be discouraged
[53:31] if sometimes you feel the silence
[53:33] becomes overbearing
[53:36] jesus growing up at age 12 he has the
[53:38] famous word says mother don't you know
[53:41] i'm about my father's business
[53:44] and i can imagine the great director of
[53:46] the great drama said the word cut
[53:49] and jesus exits the stage at age 12.
[53:53] and from age 12 to 30 jesus grows up in
[53:57] silence
[54:04] there is no scripture that speaks about
[54:05] age 12-30
[54:08] except that he was tempted and tried
[54:10] and he didn't sin
[54:12] but from age 12 to 30 under that silence
[54:15] he was going through the struggles that
[54:17] we go through
[54:18] without giving up
[54:20] so that he could be touched
[54:23] by the feeling of your infirmities
[54:25] that when you feel all down and low he
[54:27] can identify with that because during
[54:29] his period of silence
[54:31] he would have experienced
[54:33] what you experienced
[54:39] at age 30 jesus re-enters
[54:41] the great drama
[54:43] for 18 years he had been getting ready
[54:46] 18 years of silence
[54:48] he had been
[54:49] preparing for this moment
[54:52] in the wilderness
[54:55] satan probed
[54:56] at jesus because jesus was silent
[55:00] about who he was
[55:02] there is a time to keep silent
[55:04] and there's a time to speak
[55:06] satan say if thou be
[55:09] if thou be
[55:10] jesus knew
[55:12] it was not the time to speak yet
[55:14] so he didn't tell the devil who he was
[55:17] he just said it is written
[55:19] it is written it is written there is a
[55:21] time to keep silent
[55:24] but after jesus walked out of the
[55:26] wilderness and retaining the power of
[55:28] the spirit
[55:29] come on now
[55:31] he went into the temple
[55:33] on a regular church day
[55:35] when everybody was in church and they
[55:37] just happened to look and say let's call
[55:38] joseph's son today
[55:42] to read the scriptures
[55:44] and joseph's son seemingly got up and
[55:46] took the scrolls
[55:47] for 30 years there had been silence 18
[55:50] years in particular no word about him
[55:52] but jesus begins to read
[55:54] here it is before they even realize
[55:56] what's happening he is breaking the
[55:57] silence
[55:58] about who he really is about what he
[56:01] came to do about what his purpose was
[56:03] and he says the spirit of the lord is
[56:04] upon me for he had anointed me to bring
[56:07] and he began to read the scriptures they
[56:10] still didn't even realize what was going
[56:12] on but then jesus really broke it open
[56:14] and he said this day
[56:16] this scripture
[56:17] is fulfilled and when jesus did that all
[56:21] of heaven shook all of the earth shook
[56:23] all of nature shocked the trees began to
[56:26] rustle the animals put their heads
[56:28] because they realize that for all the
[56:30] years since adam fell the silence was
[56:33] about to be broken can the church say
[56:36] amen
[56:41] i pray you are encouraged this evening
[56:44] i'm not going to be too much longer i'm
[56:46] about halfway through
[56:48] could you take some more
[56:52] and jesus does this interplay it would
[56:55] seem between being active and being
[56:57] silent and the remote the most profound
[56:59] silence
[57:00] in his ministry is really
[57:02] as he's being beaten
[57:04] and being mocked
[57:06] on his way to being crucified
[57:08] jesus doesn't say a word
[57:13] he doesn't curse anybody
[57:15] he doesn't scream at anybody
[57:17] they beat him and he says nothing
[57:20] he is deliberately silent
[57:23] his silence is by a choice
[57:25] because he is focused
[57:27] on his mission
[57:28] he is focused
[57:30] on his purpose
[57:31] and leading up to calvary to those last
[57:34] moments
[57:35] only in the conversation with the
[57:37] thieves and
[57:38] just a couple moments and he climaxes
[57:41] his speech but it is finished
[57:44] and those words break the silence and
[57:48] shatters it once again
[57:50] can the church
[57:52] say amen the musician can get ready to
[57:55] come i'm not going to be too much longer
[57:58] i'll skip most of this i'll have to pick
[57:59] it up
[58:00] some of the time
[58:02] but i read that scripture i'm going to
[58:04] skip over these quotes for now
[58:07] on revelation 8 1
[58:10] that there was silence
[58:12] for the space
[58:14] of half an hour
[58:15] and by the brand i'm told that the seal
[58:17] signifies a finish work so that seven
[58:19] seal or any seal signifies a finished
[58:22] work or signifies approval and he gives
[58:24] the type of the boxcar when it's filled
[58:26] the right way it is sealed until its
[58:29] destination
[58:31] the seal is necessary to protect what's
[58:33] on the inside until the time appointed
[58:36] for it to be opened
[58:38] you're not to touch it you're not
[58:39] supposed to touch it until it reaches
[58:41] its destination
[58:42] and we know the seven seals
[58:45] was the book of redemption
[58:46] and only when you opened the seal you
[58:48] could look at the contents to know
[58:51] what's redeemed in that seal
[58:53] and the first seal to the fourth seal
[58:56] identifies how satan infiltrated the
[58:59] church by the antichrist spirit with the
[59:02] four riders the white horse red horse
[59:03] black horse and pillows and even though
[59:06] satan caused havoc in the church god
[59:09] still did a work of redemption
[59:11] he sent for the lion the ox man and
[59:13] eagle the great drama was being
[59:16] unfolded when he opened the fifth seal
[59:19] it's another work of redemption
[59:20] redemption for the jews
[59:22] the sixth seal to come the judgment sea
[59:24] but when he opened the seven seal
[59:27] there was silence
[59:29] can the church say amen there was
[59:32] something happening under the radar
[59:35] visible yet invisible
[59:38] the god that was once invisible that had
[59:40] become visible to god it was once silent
[59:43] and spoke jesus christ the same
[59:45] yesterday today and forever he had once
[59:47] again changed form
[59:49] a work of redemption was going on and
[59:51] satan was mad god hid something under
[59:54] silence because if the devil only knew
[59:57] what it was he would do great damage so
[59:59] god had to use silence but that silence
[1:00:02] couldn't last forever it was for the
[1:00:04] space of half an hour because after half
[1:00:06] an hour the silence must be broken after
[1:00:09] the half an hour whatever is hidden
[1:00:11] under that silence has got to come forth
[1:00:19] hallelujah
[1:00:21] hallelujah
[1:00:22] every other seal had a symbol had a
[1:00:25] noise had a sign that something first
[1:00:26] seal second seal third seal fourth fifth
[1:00:29] sixth but the seventh seal
[1:00:31] not that seal that seal silence god
[1:00:34] didn't want to take any chance with that
[1:00:36] seal that seal was too important jesus
[1:00:39] didn't even want to talk about that seal
[1:00:41] john was so not to write about that seal
[1:00:43] because that seal was the key to
[1:00:45] everything that seal was tied to taking
[1:00:48] somebody back to eden that seal was tied
[1:00:50] to the hole of redemption that seal was
[1:00:53] tied to the coming of the lord that seal
[1:00:55] was tied to these virtues being made
[1:00:58] manifest that seal was the great mystery
[1:01:01] hidden on the silencer but it's coming
[1:01:03] or breaking of the silence
[1:01:11] can the church say amen
[1:01:13] hallelujah we're in the word now
[1:01:16] we're in the message now all of it is
[1:01:18] building up to this anybody can preach
[1:01:20] the first part but this part that's a
[1:01:22] different story we are in the seventh
[1:01:24] seal because under there i looked under
[1:01:26] the first ceiling i wasn't there i
[1:01:28] looked under the second ceiling i wasn't
[1:01:30] there i looked under the third seal i
[1:01:32] couldn't find myself i looked on the
[1:01:33] fort i couldn't see myself i looked on
[1:01:36] the fifth i'm not a jew i can't be there
[1:01:38] i look at the six i'm not going to the
[1:01:40] tribulation i've got to be somewhere and
[1:01:43] i say tonight i come from under the
[1:01:45] seventh seal
[1:01:50] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:53] can the church say man do you know what
[1:01:55] seal you come from under that's why the
[1:01:57] devil is afraid tonight because once you
[1:02:00] know who you are he's finished
[1:02:04] don't let them get the secret that god
[1:02:07] hid the very best thing for us
[1:02:09] christ in you the hope of glory seven
[1:02:12] thunders banging one two three four five
[1:02:15] six seven
[1:02:20] can the church say man
[1:02:25] hallelujah
[1:02:26] though i feel religious this evening i
[1:02:28] feel religious deceiving him we are not
[1:02:30] a message search we are seven sealed
[1:02:33] church we are whoa
[1:02:38] hallelujah brother branham said that
[1:02:40] seventh seal is tied to the third pull
[1:02:42] brother
[1:02:44] when when you have your course but i
[1:02:46] don't have time to read it when brother
[1:02:47] brahman spoke about it he was getting so
[1:02:49] excited he was like
[1:02:50] he would use all kind of sounds because
[1:02:52] he was running out of words but he
[1:02:54] himself was instructed to not give too
[1:02:57] much about it because it couldn't happen
[1:02:59] then
[1:03:01] you don't hear me
[1:03:03] you may be seated
[1:03:12] god had to wait for a certain people to
[1:03:16] be in position
[1:03:17] it couldn't happen before it's time but
[1:03:19] a christophe it couldn't happen before
[1:03:21] it's time because listen god had to wait
[1:03:25] all these years and do something under
[1:03:28] silence it's visible yet invisible it
[1:03:31] seems as if you're just coming to church
[1:03:33] but under the silence of coming to
[1:03:35] church god is doing a hidden work of
[1:03:38] redemption to bring our people together
[1:03:40] on the silence the word is being planted
[1:03:43] in your heart under silence your spirit
[1:03:47] is getting to connect with the world on
[1:03:49] one of these days the silence will be
[1:03:52] broken an outward come a pride a living
[1:03:55] pride a powerful pride
[1:04:03] you may be seated
[1:04:05] hallelujah
[1:04:07] glory to god
[1:04:09] hallelujah
[1:04:11] hallelujah
[1:04:12] let the church say man
[1:04:14] let the regime say so
[1:04:16] hallelujah you are being redeemed right
[1:04:19] now
[1:04:28] hallelujah
[1:04:29] but i see some smiling faces but at
[1:04:32] night i see you hitting your head on the
[1:04:34] wall like the eagle tonight i see that
[1:04:36] renewing power moving to the camp when
[1:04:39] you're going to recognize wait a minute
[1:04:41] the devil tried to keep me from seeing
[1:04:42] this great thing trying to keep men from
[1:04:45] great places like this to recognize that
[1:04:48] all for all these years
[1:04:49] when god listen
[1:04:52] you may be seated
[1:04:53] when the pentecostals had a zoo's street
[1:04:56] the holy ghost poured out but the
[1:04:58] branham asks a question he said lord
[1:05:01] this brother got this gift he's speaking
[1:05:03] in tongues and behind the scenes they're
[1:05:05] living in sin committing adultery all
[1:05:08] kind of filthy living and it would seem
[1:05:10] in the message that god held back held
[1:05:13] back certain power held back certain
[1:05:15] thing because god said this time i'm
[1:05:17] doing it on the silence i don't want
[1:05:19] nobody to understand what's going on
[1:05:20] because i don't want no impersonation of
[1:05:23] this
[1:05:24] in the seventh seat but the battle said
[1:05:25] the devil couldn't impersonate anything
[1:05:28] but this
[1:05:32] he could impersonate any kind of gift
[1:05:34] but this because this seventh seal
[1:05:38] is christ
[1:05:39] you can impersonate christ you could
[1:05:42] impersonate td jakes you could
[1:05:44] impersonate benny him you could
[1:05:45] impersonate oral roberts you can
[1:05:47] impersonate any kind of gift but not
[1:05:49] jesus christ
[1:05:51] you gotta
[1:05:54] you gotta have him on the inside inside
[1:05:57] there's only one like him there's no
[1:05:59] copy of him it's either him and him
[1:06:01] alone there's no other there's no other
[1:06:04] god like this god there's no other king
[1:06:07] like this king you may be seated
[1:06:10] that's why
[1:06:12] when jesus died
[1:06:14] and the devil
[1:06:15] was holding the party because it went
[1:06:18] silent after jesus that but then all of
[1:06:20] a sudden
[1:06:21] under the silence even when the holy
[1:06:24] ghost poured out the devil didn't bat an
[1:06:26] eye he didn't move with that but you see
[1:06:28] when peter went by the cave called
[1:06:30] beautiful and he said this is that
[1:06:33] what happened in hell was the allowance
[1:06:35] of jesus is black they didn't see peter
[1:06:37] it was jesus he had come back again he
[1:06:40] was inside of peter he was inside of
[1:06:43] james he was inside of john this wasn't
[1:06:46] james this wasn't john this wasn't peter
[1:06:49] it's not the acts of the apostles it's
[1:06:51] the act of the holy ghost that shame
[1:06:53] jesus the seventh seal
[1:06:58] he is the one who created the silence he
[1:07:00] is the one to break the silence
[1:07:09] hallelujah
[1:07:10] somebody give god a shout of praise
[1:07:15] could he take a little more
[1:07:17] my my my this is supposed to be a short
[1:07:19] service to get to community but to see
[1:07:21] when you have to forgive me but i feel
[1:07:22] like with a george on thursday night but
[1:07:24] the george says i'm finished then he
[1:07:26] said i'm finished then he said i'm
[1:07:27] finished and he still wasn't finished
[1:07:29] but when the going gets so good and you
[1:07:31] begin to un to feast on the hidden
[1:07:34] manner under the seventh seal it begins
[1:07:36] to eat good
[1:07:38] and it begins to eat good and you can't
[1:07:40] stop eating because it's joy to us this
[1:07:43] is my joy this is my peace this is my
[1:07:46] high this is what i live for this is why
[1:07:48] i woke up this morning
[1:07:51] to know that god called me out of every
[1:07:54] age out of every people
[1:07:57] for his namesake for his glory for his
[1:08:00] honor
[1:08:07] mine
[1:08:09] brother one of these days
[1:08:11] the silence will break so much that
[1:08:12] you're going to find yourself screaming
[1:08:14] you didn't even know you could scream
[1:08:15] you're going to find yourself shouting
[1:08:16] you didn't know you could shout you say
[1:08:18] listen a baby
[1:08:20] when a baby is
[1:08:22] is
[1:08:23] what's the right word it's growing in
[1:08:24] the mother's womb
[1:08:26] the baby is moving
[1:08:27] under silence it's not right the baby
[1:08:30] can't talk the baby can't the baby can't
[1:08:32] say anything for nine months it seems as
[1:08:34] if nothing is happening
[1:08:35] for nine months just silence and you
[1:08:37] just stare you listen to the heartbeat
[1:08:39] you know there's something there you
[1:08:41] haven't seen it yet you haven't talked
[1:08:43] to it yet you haven't shake his hand yet
[1:08:45] you haven't done anything it's just on
[1:08:47] the silence but when that baby comes
[1:08:49] forth
[1:08:50] and that baby begins to scream there's
[1:08:52] no shutting up that baby because that
[1:08:54] baby is no longer under silence it's no
[1:08:56] longer goo gaga that lasts for only a
[1:08:58] certain season but as that baby breaks
[1:09:01] out from under the silence there comes a
[1:09:02] point but the anthony's going to come
[1:09:04] soon when the baby just won't stop
[1:09:05] talking
[1:09:08] the baby begins to make up for those
[1:09:10] nine months of silence and it just
[1:09:12] begins to talk and begins to talk and
[1:09:14] there's nothing you could do because
[1:09:16] it's built in and there's something
[1:09:18] built inside of you that was growing
[1:09:20] under silence under nine months nine
[1:09:23] years
[1:09:25] under the years since the prophet left
[1:09:27] there's been a baby growing
[1:09:30] and that baby has been feasting and
[1:09:32] feeding
[1:09:33] on the word of god
[1:09:35] for all these years but that baby as it
[1:09:38] comes forward the silence is broken and
[1:09:40] the baby screams out and you can't put
[1:09:42] that baby back in the womb you can't put
[1:09:45] me back where i came from you can put me
[1:09:47] back into the condition i came from
[1:09:50] god brought me out he will keep me out
[1:09:53] and he who started to work in me is more
[1:09:56] than able to bring it to completion
[1:09:58] brother i feel so happy i feel so
[1:10:01] excited
[1:10:05] i'm trying to close out and brother
[1:10:07] george i can't close out here
[1:10:13] my god my
[1:10:14] god hallelujah could it take a couple of
[1:10:17] minutes more
[1:10:20] i got a few more pages i'm not going to
[1:10:21] read all of it
[1:10:22] but i just want to end with this
[1:10:24] every seal
[1:10:25] had this word
[1:10:27] history
[1:10:29] age vision and the people
[1:10:33] so the first to the the first sea to the
[1:10:35] fourth seal all had their ages history
[1:10:37] the church ages the fifth seal has its
[1:10:40] age with the jews the sixth seal has its
[1:10:42] age is the tribulation isn't that right
[1:10:45] the sixth seal would have a history
[1:10:47] it'll be three and a half years that's
[1:10:49] how long the tribulation will be but
[1:10:50] what about the seventh seal
[1:10:52] the seventh seal
[1:10:54] has its own history
[1:10:56] in 1963 the seventh seal couldn't have a
[1:10:58] history because the mighty god was now
[1:11:00] breaking he was now breaking but after
[1:11:03] all these years now we can look back
[1:11:05] from when the prophet left and see we
[1:11:07] have a history
[1:11:09] every seat has to have a people the
[1:11:11] people weren't around in 1963 but i look
[1:11:14] out at the audience tonight and i see a
[1:11:16] people who have been hidden under the
[1:11:17] silence of the seventh seal sir is this
[1:11:21] the time for the breaking of the silence
[1:11:24] of cells is this the time for once more
[1:11:27] the world will hear direct from god
[1:11:29] still is this the time for the final
[1:11:31] voice up to the final age i'm finished
[1:11:35] may the lord richly bless you
[1:11:37] may the lord keep you stay on fire and
[1:11:41] don't ever don't ever stay silent

[1:22:34] evening
[1:22:36] praise god amen and
[1:22:38] sister into our bibles to first
[1:22:40] corinthians
[1:22:41] chapter 11.
[1:22:49] verses 23-32
[1:22:52] praise god amen
[1:22:58] amen it goes like this
[1:23:01] for i have received of the lord
[1:23:04] that which also i delivered unto you
[1:23:07] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:23:09] which he was betrayed
[1:23:11] took bread
[1:23:13] and when he had given thanks he broke it
[1:23:15] and said
[1:23:17] take eat
[1:23:18] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:23:21] this do in remembrance of me
[1:23:25] after the same manner also he took the
[1:23:27] cup when he had stopped saying
[1:23:30] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:23:32] blood this dewey as oft as you drink it
[1:23:36] in remembrance of me
[1:23:38] for as often as eat this bread and drink
[1:23:41] this cup
[1:23:42] you do show the lord's death till he
[1:23:44] come
[1:23:46] wherefore
[1:23:47] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:23:50] the scope of the lord unworthily
[1:23:53] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:23:55] the lord
[1:23:57] but let a man examine himself
[1:23:59] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:24:02] drink of that cup
[1:24:04] for he that eateth eateth and drinketh
[1:24:07] unworthily
[1:24:08] eat death and drink of damnation to
[1:24:10] himself
[1:24:11] not resealing the lord's body
[1:24:14] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:24:17] among you and many sleep
[1:24:20] for if we will judge ourselves
[1:24:23] we should not be judged
[1:24:24] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:24:27] of the lord
[1:24:28] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:24:30] world
