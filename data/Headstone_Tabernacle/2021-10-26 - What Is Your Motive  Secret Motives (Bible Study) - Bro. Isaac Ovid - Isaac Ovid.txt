we are not here because we have nothing else to do but we are here because we really in our hearts want to hear from you so lord may you speak to us tonight lord and if there's someone who's backslidden tonight someone's struggling lord that maybe they're not even in a position to talk about it or speak about it but they are going through a struggle tonight lord may you be with them and may you deliver transform change lord break chains and shackles if there's anyone sick tonight under the sound of my voice may healing rain pour out tonight even as the word goes forth lord that by the time this service is over lord the power of that sickness will be broken we live in perilous times as it will but we thank you for the opportunity that you have given us to knock lord and the cedar door open to ask and for lord our request to be made known and to our request to be answered so we commit this teaching and this service into your hands tonight may you take complete control in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen and amen certainly appreciate everyone tonight for being here it's been a while i was uh saying to my wife i i feel like i'm i'm in strange territory a little bit but um but it's good to be back in fellowship where the purchase of the blood of jesus christ i said we want to salute our pastor in a special way for uh the last series of bible studies i have been truly blessed and verified and i know you have been as well and we salute him uh for that and uh salute the church as we become you know seasoned out and more mature in in so much of the word that is opening up to us uh in so many different ways to bring us closer to him closer to each other and a greater clarity of god's thoughts uh to us you know so i'd like to get straight into tonight i i'm not quite sure how long i'm going to be tonight and i'm i'm trusting god to unfold this so i can't see if it'll be short i can't say if it will be long but we are here in our homes are connected by faith connected by the blood of the lord and on the expectation for god to help us in some way so before i get into the actual teaching you know i want to kind of lay a little background um taken uh something from paul uh in philippians so we're gonna go to philippians 1 and we're going to start there only because it kind of sets the tone for where i want to go it's not our substantive text tonight but i just feel led to start there to kind of help us uh as we go into this tonight so philippians one and this one i trust you have your bibles i trust you're here ready for action i trust that you have you know taken your coffee you have put things in place you have you know to know of all the distractions you have you know put your cell phone on silence you've done everything in your power to do to be able to be fully present and fully engaged you know um we want to be able uh you know for the time that we are here and when you really look at it it's not much time we get together you know when you really look at it compared to how much time you spend on work and and commuting to work or doing other things you know if you are like those who are really into watching the news and and stuff you know people who are consistent at that you know when you do that seven days a week you might actually challenge the time you spend together in church and a wrong church business you know so we don't want this to be you know a side show for us but we are here tonight because we want this to be the main thing you know we want to come tonight you know for this to be our our excitement our joy we are we are under great expectation for this to unfold to us that we could be stronger all right so i want to read philippians one and we're going to reach the philippians uh pretty quickly only because it's still a foundation of where we want to go so this is paul and he is he is writing actually um in prison he's writing in in prison and and i want us to to kind of see the perspective here um or he's writing kind hannah you know so let's take it so paul and timotheus which is timothy bond the servants of or servants of jesus christ i'll be happy five years so i cannot jump in between paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi with the bishops and deacons so paul is addressing all the believers so so it's a call to action to all of the believers tonight all right i want us to take a cue from paul and how he approaches things because we now truly would that when brother branham referenced paul he would always say that paul was the gold standard he was the the the measuring rod by which every messenger would come afterwards you know and and for for as much as we go through our adversity it is really something else to watch paul speak through his adversity grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ i thank my god upon every remembrance of you that's a powerful statement how lightly how how casual do we take the remembrance of the brethren sometimes when i read these things it makes me pause to look at myself and say but wait a minute look at how paul approaching this thing i thank my god upon every remembrance of you every time he remembers the believers he thanks god for it doesn't that kind of shake you a little bit to how paul's love for the people and the brethren well let listen to verse four now always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy so so in his prayer is not a case of he ever run out of things to pray for because in every prayer he was praying for them with a request for joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ what what an encouragement you know so so reading this should kind of give us a lift kind of increases but anthony would say sometimes getting temperature we're testing in temperature a little bit verse seven even as as it is meat for me or fit for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart in as much as both in my bonds i want us to catch that there all right so so i want to read that personally amplified it is right for me to feel this way about you because you have me in your heart as i have you in my heart since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the good news all of you share in grace with me verse 8 for god is my record how greatly i long after you all in the bowels of jesus christ and this i pray that you'll love me abound yet more and more in knowledge and all judgment i want to capture that in the amplified we are building somewhere and this i pray you that your love may abound more and more displaying itself in greater depth in real knowledge and practical insight now i love that because one of the challenges we have as believers is the practical application of the word our daily lives and this is what we really are contending for that we are not super spiritual beings floating around but we have a practical application of the word to deal with the real issues that come up every day from a real seasoned mature perspective so paul is saying i pray that you'll love me about yet more and more in knowledge so we are here tonight in our bible study to grow in our knowledge and in all judgment and our understanding in our decision making our situations arise and come to us that we have never had to deal with before decisions and questions and but but but because we are getting stronger and because we are growing and because we are getting more mature we can handle it and paul's prayer itself speaks to the fact that there was more growing to be done that there was more knowledge to be acquired that there was more insight and judgment to begin right listen to verse 10 that he may approve things that are excellent you see how paul speaking in the amplified it says so that you may learn to recognize and treasure what is excellent you see how paul is challenging them to step beyond mediocrity this is not the substantive text you know this is just paul writing in prison that he may approve things that are excellent so he's challenging them here in verse 10 so that you may learn to recognize and treasure what is excellent listen in the amplified it says identifying the best and distinguishing moral differences you see what paul is desiring what was in paul's heart for those believers and see why this bible study and these sessions have so much meaning to us because it is helping us to become more discerning in what we treasure discerning in the conversations we have discerning and how we spend our time discerning and what we do where we go what we see that and continuing verse 10 that he may be sincere and without offense till the day of christ so he's challenging them that you may be in the amplified pure and blameless until the day of christ listen actually living lives that lead others away from sin my my mind you see that there so you see it it's not a selfish life you know i in the message and and the bride i know the bride is called and you in your little cubicle yeah it is paul is challenging them that you would be sincere and without offense and in the amplified it speaks of living lives that lead others away from sin what a challenge to us all what kind of encouragement to us verse 11 being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god but listen this is where i really want to get to now this is that's just paul you know getting to his own point as well and bringing me closer to my point as well but i would you should understand bredrin and this is how we should speak you know and and and this reminds me if i can mention it of sister palms no to praise last sunday that blew me away completely it's very rare to see but somebody write a note of praise that speaks of going into a situation you know until they really get our revelation the clarity of what this all means but fear paul saying it speaking since about speaking like like paul but i would he should understand regin that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel in other words i don't want to totally feel sorry for me because a greater thing has happened because of my situation okay so listen to this in the amplified now i want you to know believers that what has happened to me this imprisonment that was meant to stop me has actually served to advance the spread of the good news regarding salvation all right verse 13 so that in my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places in other words paul is saying my imprisonment in the course of christ has become common knowledge throughout the whole imperial god so they put paul in prison and he was convincing the imperial god he pales god to become christians only seeing this so not because paul in prison he abandoned the call upon his life not because in prison he said only moping i wonder the believers praying for me i wanna i know nobody come and check me and nobody come and call me i go into a hard time paul in his prison and he instead of walking on the streets he's had to walk in the prison oh lord help me anybody with me he's had to convert the imperial god and to everyone else the bible says now let's go verse 14 we're building into where trying to go tonight and many of the brethren in the lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear so paul is saying that because of how i am living my life in my trial because when you're living and everything is good there's really not much learning to come from that but paul is saying that many of the brethren waxed him confident by my bonds you don't realize tonight how much how you deal with your trial could affect somebody else let me say that one more time how you deal with your situation your trial your obstacle your prison whatever that is tonight has an impact on other people so clearly paul was addressing other brethren who were perhaps weaker than he was who when they saw how he was fearing in the face of his challenge they got courage and confidence from it anybody with me all right now we are still building to where i want to go verse 15 this is where it gets interesting for me now some indeed preach christ listen evil of envy and strife and some also of good will now just blow my mind completely so paul is said christ is being preached some of envy and strife and in verse 15 and he amplified some it is true are actually preaching christ out of envy and rivalry toward me for no better reason than a competitive spirit or misguided ambition so this this thing here with church conflict and ministry conflict and competition and ambition is not a new thing you know paul is in prison acknowledging listen here that that some it is true are actually preaching christ out of envy and rivalry toward me so paul had rivals there were other preachers who were rivals to paul there were other ministers who were envious of paul and he says and he amplified for no other reason than a competitive spirit so there are people who just have a competitive spirit and paul was calling it out or misguided ambition the issue is not ambition the issue is misguided ambition all right so some indeed preach christ even of envy and strive to be contentious and some also of good will in the amplified they say others out of good will and a loyal spirit toward me listen to verse 16 the one preached christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds no this is this is serious stuff here so paul is saying here the latter the troublemakers preach christ out of love the latter preach uh christ out of love because they know that i've been put here by god for the defense of the gospel but the former preached christ insincerely out of selfish ambition just self-promotion thinking that they are causing me distress in my imprisonment that is the amplified version of it but others have love in verse 17 knowing that i am set for the defense of the gospel and listen to how paul concludes this so what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretense or in truth christ is preached and i there and do rejoice here and will rejoice so paul takes a super mature position he is saying i'm locked up there are people who are preaching because they want to cause issue they're preaching because i can be out there preaching so because of that they are taking full advantage of my absence from the field and there are those who are preaching to encourage me they are those who are preaching and i want you to catch this with selfish motives with different agendas and they are those preaching with good motives different motives at work but they all have the same objective to preach christ and paul is saying you know what in verse 18 notwithstanding so i'm overlooking the motive at this point because once christ is preached i am rejoicing in this thing but what really caught my attention friends and this is where we want to kind of spend some time tonight by the grace of god is really this issue of motive because paul up until this point was highlighted to the believers in filipi listen people could be doing things and their motives is a whole different story and tonight for a few minutes i want to ask a question which is the theme of my bible study tonight and a statement what is your motive secret motives bible study what is your motive secret motives bible study let's have a conversation tonight behind every action is a motive it's impossible for you to do anything without a motive behind every word there's a motive behind anything that is created there is a motive motive is the why behind what we do motive the why behind what anybody does the action may be a good action but the why or the motive may not be good when satan started his conversation with eve he had a motive he wasn't feeling as bad over would say conversationish he wasn't feeling to just have a conversation he came to have a conversation with a motive eve did not understand the motives if eve knew where this conversation would have led or understood the intent of the conversation the reason behind the conversation the motive of the conversation she would have hit the bricks because she didn't understand the road that she was going down anybody with me and here's our first lesson tonight if we don't understand the motive it doesn't change the fact that the motive is there now motives drive us motives don't have to all be negative they are positive motives could be positive motives could be negative and motives are connected to words and to actions so i found myself thinking recently you know my daughter picked up something and i said you know if she put it in her mouth that's a problem so when i take it from her she of course is disappointed she cries she will draw a tantrum she doesn't understand at this point in time that that could be a danger my motive is not to make her cry my motive is not to get to the throat tantrum my motive is to protect her because she doesn't understand the danger or the motive we have a conflict anybody with me motive is all about the heart so we're going to kind of get a bit deeper tonight because this year could be a turning point for somebody in this room tonight we're speaking about motive why we do what we do why we say what we see and i had like four questions what is your motive what is their motive what is god's motive what is satan's motive and it comes all down to motive because you who have a motive for what you do there are people around us who may appear to be our friends who have very very demonic motives behind what they do and they are people who may be rough or unfavorable to us who actually have good motives how many people say well but robert spoke rough to men oh yeah what what was the motive when god corrects somebody through certain things why god do that what is the motive so i'm going to come and i'm going to come into your house a little bit but i want to kind of build a little bit into that motive is all about the heart motive speaks our deeper desires which can be good or bad so somebody you have a friend you have a family member you have somebody who you know living a certain kind of life and you're and you're drawing closer to them what is your motive for doing that because i've come to the realization that when somebody backslide it is because of an issue of motive before it became an issue of action anybody with me tonight now let's kind of go a little deeper there are many types of motives it will be impossible to go through them all tonight for somebody their motive is recognition and all they really want is recognition that doesn't have to be a bad motive but sometimes in the desire for recognition people compromise and the motive of wanting to be recognized the motive of wanting to be respected so that's emotive so they want respect so because they want respect they they they they join a gang befo because they want respect and emotive is like nobody respect me nobody noticed me nobody when you dig deeper to the reason and they are motives that are surface level and they are even deeper all right arrive at me ride with me maybe our motive is to teach somebody a lesson you find you had it hard so nobody must have it easy so your motive is to make things as hard for people as possible anybody with me i want to just help you process some of this tonight as we get closer to god we need to start to look at both actions and motives we need to begin to look at both words and motives when we look closely at our lives and i want us to catch just tonight if it's one thing we catch tonight is this when we look closely at our lives there are really only two things that affect us on a daily basis we're dealing now with the issues of life we're dealing with life and godliness we're dealing with challenges and stresses they're really only two things that affect us when a day comes it's words and actions that's it you know that's it somebody says something to us that we don't like that could throw your whole day in a tailspin somebody says something to you that's good that could change your whole day because somebody said he write words to you but somebody can say something to you that is a bad thing get you upset and they can actually have the right motive behind it and somebody can at least see something good that have you feeling like like a queen or a king but behind here is evil and you riding the wave of that how many young brothers young sisters get trapped with nice words and bad motives anybody with me tonight can i can we can we can we go a little bit all of our challenges issues and frustrations come from our failure to understand motives i will say that twice all not some all of our challenges issues and frustrations come from our failure to understand motives we're gonna get into the scriptures in a bit how many arguments in your home could be avoided if you paused to understand the motives i'll say that one more time how many arguments in your home could be avoided if you paused to understand the motive sometimes people desire to do a good thing a nice thing a right thing but it will come out too good and you fly off the handle because it'll come out good but you fear to even consider the motive the desire what are they trying to achieve so simple things why decide to eye on these shirts and the the line not holy i i hear big arguments over the way the shirt was a hand the wife trying to do a a favor blessing and i said and a man said well he got ironic so you ever seen him i should also and that turned a whole break in the home because the man couldn't see beyond the action to go to the motive the motive wasn't to put a new crease on your shirt the motive was to be a blessing by surprise junior by ironing his shirt and because you can't see beyond the action to the motive you will become a volcano a dormant volcano explode because you couldn't separate action from motive i don't know who this is going to help tonight but as we become more like god because the scripture speaks about god filtering way in both actions and motives he doesn't look at one in isolation so we talk about wanting to be more like jesus we want to be more like god well the closer we get to god we suddenly develop this ability to consider both the action and the motive behind the action how many conflicts or situations in your job could be mitigated if you pause to understand the motive would you have the same friends in your neighborhood in your family on your job if you really knew the motive you see because god could discern the the heart and the issue that he had you know somebody bring food for you and if you is my connection fine yeah and if you don't understand the motive and you realize what's going on say my wife don't cook sooner it might sound simple friends but if you don't know the motive behind the action you'll find yourself in the problem this is not no deep mystery but i've seen too many brothers fall with it with this so i don't want to act i don't want us to act as if we we don't know these these things happen we are not naive we we want to be we want to be sharp and understand if we don't pause now i had to learn to walk around with a magnifying glass on everybody and try to figure out what's the motive i'm not telling you walk because they are spirits operating upon people and we see it when we get into the book of acts about the door being open to spirits operating and you now recognize that you are now exposed let's talk about family a little bit before we get into the scriptures this is what the lord put on my heart i don't know if if it's helping anybody because it's one of the things that i think troubles me with young people and their relationships with their parents i would have touched on husband and wife and on it any motive so so for example you grew up in your house eating food a certain way and your wife make it different and because of that uvex you know i know how it's supposed to make it and that's a whole issue friends it might be your issue but there are people this is the issue so bear with us while i help somebody with this issue and you fail to see the motive behind trying to prepare a meal and you so focus on the action of the food not the way you thought it's supposed to be that it creates contention in your home and if you can't i want to say this look beyond the action even the word people say things they don't mean because the motive behind it is to actually improve the situation but they don't know how to do it so they said the wrong thing in an attempt to improve the situation the more previous right you know but the words they use to try to fix this situation maybe the wrong words but they already genuinely honestly have the motive of commentary resolution anybody with me so i want us to become more mature because paul in the scripture we read was beginning to highlight this nuance in motive and action and showing that there is a difference there are times to focus on the action that times are really warning on the motive because the motive ultimately is what is what is most important so back to the parents i find it very hard i wrote it here no i find it hard to believe that a believer has a negative motive when it comes to their children that's what i wrote in my notes i find it hard to believe that a believer has a negative motive when it comes to their children and if the younger ones not just children but as we mature as we get older to really deserve and understand i may not be a hundred percent in agreement but what is the motive because if i try to understand a motive that could help bring resolution to a conflict why believers have so much conflict in home in marriage on the job among believers too much conflict paul spent a lot of time through different letters dealing with conflicting anybody with me have you stopped to consider the motive so your parents said don't go so and so don't i don't waste spending time with someone so my parents are either help they're trying to scrap my style they try to think anything and you don't understand that they're trying to protect you because of love for you because of concern for you because they don't know how that will turn out they don't know where that road will lead and you're going on a road that you may not see and and they may not have the education you have but in their heart they see this thing and they know something not adding up and the motive is to protect you but you and your arrogance because you have two subjects and two piece of paper decide to say well i know better and then when you hit your head you still come back home to the same home to the same father the same mother the same person who cramped your style why do we have to go through that cycle of pain before we come back to resolution because if we really understand the motive i look back at my own life and i contemplate conversations when i was younger i asked myself if i really had listened and understood and paused and really considered the motive what would have been different now we can't live and regret because you can't change your past but i'm challenging us as a people to reboot the system as it will be transformed the bible said by the renewing of your mind a paradigm shift as it will to recalibrate into what god's motive is whatever i'm saying you could take it to a better sickness he could turn your wife against him turn the church against you what is the motive to frustrate you was he the motive to punish need to bring your character into a level of maturity and you can say there's my spirit flowing freely so if you see god's motive for what he's doing then should our attitude be different our approach different our response different front is this helping anybody tonight so go deeper into this issue of motive is about really asking deep questions why do you do what you do i have seen people remove from being a deacon and leave the church because a change in the situation uncovered deeper motives could you do what you do for the lord if nobody says thank you because if you're feeding on the thank you and the recognition the moment that is not there because that becomes some people that is the motive they long for appreciation and intention and these things so when you feed them that give them that gasoline there's some people you tell them great job great job great job just every time you're doing a great job they get wings they're ready to fly because i'm feeling it at the moment you take away the great job great job they can't fly anymore so the motive for doing what they do is not so much that they want to get their job done you know it's because they feed off of something else anybody with me all right so again it's a lot i want just taking a look at why we do what we do what we do and why we do it all right in a message seeking after jesus just two sentences we're looking to get somebody closer to god that's our motive of being here no other motive at all and i drop that in there because this is what we pushed in towards we have a motivational agent and the motive is for us to get closer to god to be more like him to think like him to act like him to live like him let's look at some scriptures we're doing we're doing good with time proverbs 16 2. you could take note of it if you if you could move quickly you could get to it a little equalism to tape as well but but listen to what solomon says here in proverbs 16 2 all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the lord with the spirits this one verse is mind blowing all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the lord with the spirits so what we're talking about tonight is waving spirit i'm going to get to the amplified and you're going to see where this is going in the amplified it says all the ways of a man are clean and innocent in his eyes and he may see nothing wrong with his actions but the lord weighs and examines the motives and intent of the heart and knows the truth now i really find this is powerful because you may not realize that you have a hidden motive because in your eyes what you doing seemed like the right thing to do and this is when this is where the rubber meets the road or the real issue is because people sometimes move by their conviction which is wrong and they cannot see that they are wrong they cannot see that this thing this road in this thought this approach this way of thinking because i have grandfather tell you how to do it and you genuinely believe that and the approach you're taking so in your eyes as the scripture said it's clean it making sense but the lord goes beyond the action and examine the motive and the intent why are you spending all that time with him why are you spending time with her why are you giving that money why are you doing that thing why are you why you didn't say that why you did that and we're going to get into some examples right jeremiah 17 9 jeremiah 17 and verse 9 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can do it the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can do it i want to read it in the amplified the heart is deceitful above all things and it is extremely sick this is not the sick of health sick who can understand it fully and know its secret motives this is where i get the second part of my title tonight secret motives what is your motive secret motives because there are motives that you may very well be aware of but there'll be motives that you're not even conscious of anybody with me tonight is this helping anybody no let's push even deeper james four and verse three james four and verse three now let's really come to the heart of your spiritual work noah and listen to what james is saying here ye ask and receive not so you're praying and your prayer not getting answered listen carefully to this one he asked and receive not because you ask a miss that he may consume it upon your lusts now what does this really mean because if you don't pause to really consider this and now check back what god really tested for let's look in the amplified at this same scripture we just read you ask god for something and do not receive it because you ask with a wrong motive out of selfishness or with an unrighteous agenda that's what the armistice is referring to anybody with me so you asking god and god looking at the request and the motive he's not taking the request alone when the prayer requests come he asking what is the motive for this request so so you want a new car and the motive is to impress somebody to impress a girl on the walk you want a car but it's really because of jealousy so when the request comes to god you see the request for the car and his jealousy is emotive because your neighbor buy a new car so he getting bought to them at the same time you know you didn't submit the motive you submitted requests but the motive came when you request any anybody say i didn't see the picture you want a promotion on a job and the request comes and he said promotion come and we have a scripture you send it to the lord and the lord said where is he motive anybody with me tonight and when he motivates up because the request might come before the motive when we so i want us to see it like that so you request reach up brother so-and-so looking for a promotion on the job and and and and the motive when he motivates up and he look at him what if he say but this motive this motive here is he want this money to do something and if he do this he he he did you want a job in some quite quite too and the motive is is that the other day you want to spend more time away from your family denied anybody seen it i remember about over the years ago saying people pray lord give me if i get a car i'll serve him more i'll beat any moment again by the beach sometimes god denying your loan application denying stuff because if he don't know the motive he said if you get instinct you won't find you in him the deacons can't find you i want this to sink in so every request coming to god out saying before i even act on angels check the motive so i want the reader to give me amplified you asked and again i want us to nail down body quality overt motive and the covert the known motive and the unknown because there are things in us that we sometimes don't realize are there and we have been through this jonah didn't realize part of what was in him that these situations around him elevated so god is able to go and understand what's in you and his desire his motive to protect you his motive to keep you his motive to bring you to perfection his motive to adopt you he is also making certain decisions and actions and blessings and closing doors and opening doors and closing windows because he has a motive he said i know the plans i have for you i know the thoughts i have for you thoughts of peace taught a blessing to give the unexpected end he has made that very clear but if you are a danger to yourself because of either a motive or desire you have to be a somebody so whatever it is or a motive you don't even know you have god he has this element thank god he can know the taught and the intent of our heart anybody so again i want to nail this down no god not saying no acts of big things whatever i'm talking you say ask god for big things that's a direct quote but the issue is not just asking for big things you know there has to be the right motive behind it because if god see him giving you a million dollars will get into trouble you will never get it to know nothing you could ever do because god don't want you to get injured into trouble now if you can act more mature and then your motive would be different now god could trust you because if you get a million dollars and you you you couldn't party behind your house and it starts off innocent you know but in your heart deep down you even know you had a party spirit you you always had a little desire to to be a place where you will come and lie there's nothing wrong with with linemen and fellowship and anything you know but a little piece of you deep down inside you never knew you knew it was there that if this thing happened every single week afterward you feel like you you you are the king what's in that spirit is what are going against i don't know if this helping anybody james 4 3 we still there you ask god for something and do not have selfishness so again here is james talking about selfishness so you're asking but what is for your own you're selfish you're not looking for god's will you're not looking to bless somebody it's me is i is myself or with unrighteous agenda so james is actually equating unrighteous agenda with selfishness mind-blowing so that when you get what you want you may spend it on your hedonistic desires that's the same james 4 in the amplified let's go on a little bit i just have a few more examples i want to go to acts 5. i want to look at this a little bit and then we have one more scripture we're going to go back to samuel we're going to bring some closure here on this one this one is we we know it but our water's still going so acts 5 1. and how many know we're going back to another ephesians we're going for another book of acts anybody anybody in the house wonderful wonderful so when the book of acts come back acts five you can't get any booker acts without acts 5. so if we're going back to the book of acts then we won the whole book right we want we want to be able to measure up to these standards all right so act five verse one let me just get it in the amplified as well but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a possession now to put things in context and it is brought out a bit but students of history biblical history would understand that in the book of acts the bible speaks of they had all things in common which meant at that time there was no big me little you the church operated as a family a bond the believers would bring what they had and the diaconated deacons would ensure that everybody had what they needed and these these kind of things so this certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a possession it was a piece of property all right so i'm going to parallel this with the amplified solar piece of property and verse 2 and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet now the first point i wanted us to appreciate here is there was no obligation to do this this was not a mandatory thing this was a choice that ananias and sapphira came to the bedroom and say since i am going to sell a piece of property and i'm going to bring it for the benefit of the saints and the church and that kind of stuff all right so you understand the context so it was not that it was an instruction ananias was given he was to operate from his heart so we're going to read one other question we're not going to descript it with that as well verse 3 but peter said ananias and this is what i was referring to why had satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost so in other words basically ananias allowed because the only way the devil will come into your heart is if you allow it let me let me kneel this down the devil has no authority this is not the devil came into his mind all right in the amplified wires it unfilled your heart to lie to the holy spirit right so peter said in time why had satan filled that heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land verse 4 while it remained was it not thine own in other words as long as you would remain unsold did it not remain your own to do as you please so in other words you had a choice you didn't have to sell it you could have kept it you had a choice of what you're doing so so then it brings up a big question if ananias could have kept the property and not sell it why would he offer to do it because no any action any word is driven by a motive anybody with me in other words ananias was doing something and the real issue here we're reading is one of motiva because he had a choice he wasn't forced to do it he made a choice to do it now i cannot tell you what it was maybe he wanted to come across well i'm the biggest donator maybe he wanted to come across i don't know it doesn't tell us the motive but there had to be a motive all right let's go why has thou conceived this thing in thine heart remember motivism body heart thou has not lied onto men but unto god and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost died on the spot in the amplified and here are these words and an eyes fell along suddenly and died and great fear came on all them that heard these things and the young men in the congregation arose wound them up and carried them out and buried him and it was about a space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in and peter answered unto her tell me whether he saw the land for so much and she said yeah for so much and peter's then peter said unto her how is it that he have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord what was the motive it still perplexes me for the clarence still to this day because you had a choice you didn't have to sell it even if you sold it you could have come clean and say listen this to what i want to do you had a choice so what why would somebody do this and also agree to lie about it what would the motive be and that's to show you peter caller doesn't know he said why alexa didn't come into your heart to do this thing in other words what driving your behavior this what i can call almost irrational behavior because if you have the power to sell your land or not sell it and he choose to do it and they say you got to do something and then you you hold back on your promise because you promised it to god and peter's saying here lying to manny are you lying to god how is it that he have agreed together to the term the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband that itself is a statement there in other words them brothers no come back inside you say look look they walk in there the jazz burial bunny see that dirt on the on the foot look look at the feet they are the door and shall carry the out then fell straight down straight away at his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young man came in and found her dead and carrying her fault buried her by her husband and great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things now we still dealing with motive your heart what's your desire last scripture in the new testament before we finish up in the old testament second corinthians 9 6. second corinthians chapter 9 verse 6 but this i say he which sow it sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which sow it bountifully shall reap also bountifully for every man or corning as he had purpose it in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god love it a cheerful giver no we know this scripture but i want us to understand what god is saying here he is saying your motive forgiven is is critical to how i receive what you're given and this giving could speak to many different things you know so so it is not just financial gonna be talking about you know you're giving to the lord you're giving up your time so even being here tonight is giving you know but are you here out of necessity are you here grudgingly or are you here giving up your time cheerfully anybody you have a processor that way or even financially you put in your offering and putting your ties you know but you're doing it grudgingly because or you're doing out of necessity because you would say you have to wait but there's no chair there's no there's no joy cause you don't understand what god doing so there's no chair i don't want to start tonight you know and gossip as your purpose in your heart this here is also tied to that acts five you know because purpose in your heart to give but not grudgingly god i really are giving it to no but uh oh ugliness says to me well the law says that's ultimately lord the lord the legal you say give your giving you're not giving it because you want to give way or you understand why to give but because it's a necessity you're given because you're afraid judgment that's the only reason if it wasn't because of judgment he wasn't going to give that is necessity what is the difference between because the fact that paul have to address this issue meant it was an issue that existed he not addressing issues out of i'm never feeling i feel that dress up tonight yes nobody has addressed something no he is confronting situations that people were battling with to help them anybody with me all right i hope this helping somebody tonight all right so let's go back to the old testament two bible studies ago two that the second the last one before that that i did we dealt with when you're under attack and we dealt with david and goliath and we would have addressed basically battles that david had to overcome to even deal with goliath that goliath was the end game the big battle but before that he had to deal right before with saul saying you can't do it you're too young you can't make it and just before that he had to deal with eliab his own brother with the family issues the family stresses the family questioning if you could why you're here that kind of stuff so i want to look at firstly first samuel 17. 28 just to re-look at this conversation with eliab and if you recall eliab was the first born of jesse i believe i would have mentioned if you would have looked at his graduation card he was most likely to succeed he was tall he was handsome even when samuel saw it samuel said this have to be the king if god didn't stop samuel he was going to anoint eliab king of israel god had to stop samuel and say hold up don't look at the outward appearance i look at the heart anybody anybody with me and this is just represent being hard because david was a man of the godhead samuel the prophet samuel unhindered or stopped by god was about to anoint elia the next king of israel if god didn't interrupt samuel we would have never had a king david and god's saying my issue with elia is the hat and the heart speaks the motive because out of your heart is what drives your motive anybody with me right so first samuel 17 28 and elia his eldest brother hood when he speak unto the men that's when david they asked him what going on who is this philistine thing and elijah's anger was kindled against david and he said why chemists dull down hither in other words here is a man with issues in his heart questioning david's motive i want us to see this now so i want to understand now there are people around us because of their own issues will put pressure on us and actually make it about your motive so in other words some time ago somebody asked a little bit why are you going on the fields if you don't want to go on the field that's your issue you know anybody with me in other words you could i could just keep it motive is such a thing and here it is i want to see elias you want me with the issues and oh god listen we're not wondering if elijah had issues in them we're not suggesting god said because of his issues hika you're not qualified you have issues to deal with and here is the man with issues to walk into human after god's own heart and the man with issues questioning the motive of the man after god owners anybody with me why came as down here hither question a motive and with whom has thou left those few sheep in the wilderness and listen not only is it a question he's now stated stating the issues in david's lives he said i know thy pride i know as pride is your motive and the naughtiness of thine heart i know what's driving you i know what makes you tick and know why you're doing what you're doing for though i come down that don't make the cd battle that is anybody's anybody's anybody seeing this here and david's response is what have i done or what have i now done is there not a cause in other words the cause is motive or anybody help me tonight the cause is my motive because i came here my father sent me david didn't choose to be there you know i wanted to appreciate how backstage elia was david didn't ask about and applied to go there he father sent him but the questions he was asking was because of goliath anybody with me no last body of scripture next chapter last time we did david we would have ended in first samuel 17. now let's go to both samuel 18 and this is where we will end tonight first time you are 18 verse one are you being blessed tonight anybody anybody enjoyed this anybody being blessed anybody i know i can't see all the faces i trust everybody is awake and and on fire and getting inspiration and and and we're looking at themselves and you know so let's deal with this situation in full samuel 18. and it came to pass now we will recall for samuel 17 ended with saul asking who is this boy david whose son is he all right and david say well i am son of jesse and nothing right good so first time 18 verse 1 and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul all right we're building and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his father's house so saul is so blown away by this young boy named david that he said listen you're not going home back again you're staying here with me boy because i really like your style i like you you think there's something about you so and i mean that that is itself is our honor when the king say listen stay here in the king's palace something you know so so it's a great honor david clearly had something going for him to cut the attention of saul but let's build verse 3. then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul and jonathan stripped himself up the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garment even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle and david went out with us whoever saul sent him and listen i love this and behaved himself wisely we will see this repeated multiple times in this chapter behaved himself wisely that itself is mind-blowing to me because this is a young david at this point in david's life he is actually too young to be in the army so this is not the issue of age it's an issue of spiritual wisdom because this is an anointed david he's already anointed but the fact that it is mentioned that he behave himself wisely it's the highlight not only that he did but it also gives us the contrast that that he did he also was not behaving ridiculous anybody with me can people say the same of us that we behave wisely because behaving wisely means we deal with situations a certain kind of way right and as a young man listen to it saul set him over the men of war so saul is so blown away with this young man who behaves wisely he sets him over the men of war big season men men of war in this context are the seasoned soldiers and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of saul's servants let's go we're not going to meet too much longer ride with me and it came to pass as they came when david was returned from the slaughter of the philistines that the woman came out of all cities of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with tabret with joy and with instruments of music but over when he preaches they said they sang the wrong special when they came back from the battle brother thompson the special that the sisters started to sing in the convention is very seven and the woman answered one another as they played and said saul had slain his thousands and david his ten thousands and there's rejoicing there's jubilee and saul in verse eight is furious saul is losing it the bible says and sort where saul was very wrought which is very angry and the saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed on the david ten thousands and to me they have ascribed by thousands what can he have more body kingdom in other words saul was so caught up in that song that he said david don't have every single thing he could ever have in other words saul attributed that praise as valuable as to everything in the world except the crown on his head he said the only thing david missing is this room this is a little boy in the palace who have a few men under him and that song affected king saul so much he said the only thing this man missing is this krong anybody with me i love i love verse nine and you have to get a joy when you read a new scripture there and so i that david from that day i thought i didn't even possess in other words every after that soldiers i endeavor it's just affecting them yes i ain't given but listen this wasn't david's doing this wasn't david choose to be this way anybody with me this wasn't this was just he was living what god put in him out so don't be bothering people eyeing you when you live in what god put you here to do there's not anybody with me you just living you doing you based on what god plan is for you and people eyeing you it's not it's not your fault don't feel bad about that anybody with me verse 10 [Music] and it came to pass on the morrow that the very next day that this thing take place did they have to require sin and require the right they got fired and ending the very next day that the evil spirit from god came upon saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and david played with his hand as at other times and there was a javelin in seoul's hand and saw casty javelin so an assassination attempt for instead i would smile david even to the wall with it so he was eyeing him eyeing him eyeing him eyeing him until he couldn't i am no more decided to take this i need to kill this boy and david avoided out of his presence twice verse 12 let's go and saul was afraid of david you see the tone of scripture changes now fear is upon soul david hasn't made a move there has been no attempted coup there has been no cry for david to assume leadership saul is afraid of david because the lord was with him so all those soul is backslidden he sees the presence of god anybody with me you know what the comfort it is i have the presence of the lord oh my hallelujah to know that the lord is with you you stumble here your your your shake up here but the lord is with you you can't help yourself the lord is with you because he promised to never leave you never forsake you anybody with me so listen now to soil dealing with this situation and i want to see all this unfolds let's ride with me we're going to be a few more therefore saul remove him from him in other words he want to create distance between him and david and made him captain over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people listen to verse 14 again and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways you see the repeating of it and the lord was with him verse 15 wherefore when saul saw listen listen listen to what bothered skin soul when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of him so this is his second fear the first fear was based on the lord being with him the other fear was he behaved himself wisely that itself created fear for soul do you know that when you conduct yourself the right way the devil gets afraid you understand when you're supposed to blow your top lose your cool act all crazy and you act wisely you never say now boy this one different oh you don't hear me tonight anybody with me when you act wisely that is a problem for the devil look at i don't think you catch listen up the fact that david behaved himself wisely created fear do you know when you act wise on your job it creates fear we're 16 but all israel and judah love david because he went out and came in before them listen why in the amplified but all israel and judah love david because he publicly associated with them you see that king saul never lived in the palace i could go places but i would reverse the car verse 17 and saul said to david behold my elder daughter mira who will i give thee to wife only be the valiant for me and fight the lord's battles now we get him closer to where i want to go to now so listen to how saul positions it i will give you my elder daughter who will i give thee to wife listen but it is conditional you need to be valiant for me and he actually bring god in it he said and fight the lord's battle in other words he threw in terminology in there that david could identify because if you're on the lord's side you'll want to fight the lord's battle all right but but this is being said but there's a motive behind it right let's go first by the road back to right for saul said not left not my hand be upon him but let the hand of the philippines be upon him so in other words saul is seen in his heart it is in his heart for saul thought in the amplified my hand shall not be against it but let me handle the philosophy against him so saul is thinking if i send david out promise him my daughter tell him it's for the lord i don't have to kill him myself but he philistine will kill him that is what saul is thinking you know so the motive and i want us to catch us here saul put in the lord in the air and the motive is the devil the motive is to kill david but he using words and terminologies to persuade david to do certain things but he motivated it so it's for the lord anybody seeing this how many but truly lord to get people to manipulate people because that's what really he using the lord he's in his office he's in his position to manipulate people you know the lord wants you to watch my car i've seen it happen but i've seen abusive ministries meri versica verse 18. let's go and david said unto saul who am i so david himself you know trying to figure out what's going on because you know he conducts himself wisely can we think we almost died nobody falling asleep right so and davidson said who am i and what is my life or my father's family in israel that that i should be son and to the king is it this office is too high for me all right verse 19. but it came to pass at a time when marab no this is the height of manipulation reference saul offered his daughter what kind of man are you when he will offer your daughter in a whole plan to assassinate not only that you layer on top of your daughter the lord name and says the lord battleground fight and your goal is that this man and die in battle because of the special that was sung two certainly but it came to pass at the time when marab saul's daughter should have been given to david that she was given unto adriel the mahala side to wife right so so that didn't work out so to show you how serious saul is in his heart meaning the motive is there so he told the first daughter air worker because she ended up getting married listen to verse 20. and misel source daughter love david and they told soul and the thing please him and so i said i will give him her that she may be listen a snare to him so again motiva he had given him her to be a good wife to be a help mate to be a support to be an encouragement to be a shoulder to cry on to be somebody you go to when you're feeling down no no no no wrong message he is giving her to david to be a snare to him anybody with me listen to the amplified sword said i will give her to him so that she may become a snare bad influence source of trouble to him oh lord help us help us jesus and that the hand of the philistines may be against him in other words so also it as a way to weaken david so that he's not vulnerable go on now wherefore saul said to david thou shall this day be my son-in-law in the one of twin let's go almost done verse 22 listen to the lengths that saul is going to and this is about motive and it's also this is this is really a deep teaching because this is a king somebody in power somebody in authority somebody who was once anointed because samuel did anoint him anybody with me and saw commanded himself and saying commune with david secretly in other words take david into your confidence do it don't let him be overwhelming and say behold the king had the light in thee and all his servants loved thee now therefore be the king's son-in-law early on tonight i say people could say nice things to you that you're in your feed off of it but look saul is telling them in secret don't make it a public show invite david out carry him pizza hut carry him somewhere cut him nice place commune with him talk with him fellowship with them tell him the king like you you can please richard they couldn't want to promote it he can't impress with you you see how motive could now turn into situations that if you are not guided to what you're dealing with you're in trouble verse 23 and saul's servants speak these words in the ears of david and david said submit it to you a light thing to be a king's son-in-law seeing that i'm a poor man and lightly esteemed so one thing i want to highlight here is that clearly the song that his sister sang never got to be he never changed the perception of himself he never saying well i deserve this i'm entitled to this all you know who i am i'm the one who killed goliath i threw out all of the conversation with david we see david asking are you sure i'm not sure i qualified you know my family a small family i'm a poor man i'm likely esteemed he never even pay attention to how the people treated him no wonder god called him a man after his own hand there's a few voices left verse 24 and the servants of saul told him seeing on this manner spake david so in other words they went back to seoul and telling saul this is how david talking all right so it's almost like david had taken he beat in that kind of way then right verse 25 so so now in response to david not falling because he didn't accept the offers he didn't accept the first offer he didn't accept his second offer every time they bring me offer he played down he said listen i'm not worthy i'm not qualified i'm a nobody this thing's too good i don't know what's going on verse 25 and saul said thus shall he say to david the king desired not any dory if you know anything about that culture a dory is a mandatory thing the king said to bend in law the law started to get twisted for his agenda he said the kings are not any dory in other words don't bring no money don't bring because in that culture you had to bring sheep goat cattle thing to show how much you really validity daughter it was supposed to be a tree to show listen this is what you're doing to me i've given you all this and let's say but a hundred four skins of the philistines in other words and when they go and kill a hundred philistines and bring the four skins to be revenge of the king's enemies but soul again look at the motives now friends this is not david against a philistine this is david against not our brother you know this is the king of the brothers this is to show you this is spiritual wickedness in high places disappear this this is serious you know this is in the church this is in your house it's in the family but david thought to make david fall by the hand of the philistines now dear soul is thinking everything you're doing it's not being seen i got it saul is doing all of this thing with an evil motive against you talking about king david we're addressing you know all right let's go and when his servants told david these words it pleased david well to be the king's son-in-law and the days were not expired so when david here know that there's no dory the king one just fell assigned dead david cannot he kind of could roll with that because he only felt his ankle in business he he he kills it so where for verse 27 david arose and went he and his men and slew of the philistines two hundred men he he killed double the requirement well let's see it this thing what's now when you're readers things so and again this thing's here isn't them the king acts are a hundred now bear in mind i wanted a picture of this movie the king's expectation is a hundred philistines should be able to wipe out david he and his mind thinking if i say is a hundred men at least by the time he killed 95 the last five go wipe him out he can't make the hundred because the king wouldn't give up figure that is attainable if he's trying to get him killed if you want it easy say kill ten men he said kill a hundred men in his mind he thinks that's impossible david could never kill a hundred men by then he should be dead for sure here it is david said no problem challenge accepted david slew 200 men double the requirements and david brought their foreskins and they gave them in full teal to the king that he might be son-in-law hallelujah and saul gave him mitchell his daughter to wife and soul soul and new i like that let that be your testimony let it be my testimony and saul saw and knew that the lord was with david and that mitchell saw's daughter loved him and saul looking again this is now all the way volume all the way up was yet the more afraid of david we this is the third time or more we see him saw his fear for david keep rising it arrived when he said god is with him and rise when he saw you was behave wisely it rise even more now and saul was yet the more afraid of david and saul became david's enemy continually last verse to close out tonight then the princes of the philistines went fought and it came to pass after they went forth that david behaved himself more wisely and all the servants of soul so that his name was much set by and in the amplified so his name was highly esteemed friends this brings to a close tonight's teaching and i highlighted this because one would expect that someone anointed by the prophet samuel would have always had pure motives one would expect that someone anointed by the prophet samuel would only want the best for somebody under their care but here we see how much attempts saul made to destroy david's life and as far as so all concerned he wasn't showing what he was doing it was in his thinking it was in his heart it was the motive that was there but david as we know was protected he was anointed he would be part of the lineage that jesus would come from so there was nothing that could come his way but it didn't take away from the fact that there were motives that are ugly i want us to realize tonight in closing that motives are real and we need to try these spirits we need to see what's around us family friends relatives word spoken what is the objective of it what are people trying to achieve and we have to discern tonight that in all of these things and then coming to these bible studies and these sessions is for us to become more sensitive for us to become more mature so when people tell you stuff you could unfilter it from the word and say well i've seen this player before you know because your motive is not right i will close out with this quote from the prophet in jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever let your objective be right let your motive be right for anything outside of the right motive and the right objective god can't use it so i want to encourage us tonight as believers let this be what we take away tonight let your objective be right let your motive be right because anything outside of the right motive and the right objective god can't use it shall we head so would have prayed our heavenly father tonight we thank you for your grace your love your mercy we thank you for this teaching on motives secret motives motives of the heart what is your motive lord
