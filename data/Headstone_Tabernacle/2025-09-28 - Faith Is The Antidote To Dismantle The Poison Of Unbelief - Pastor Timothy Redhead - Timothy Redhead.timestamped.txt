[34:52] [Applause]
[34:53] [Music]

[35:04] You are
[35:08] the truth. away.
[35:13] I bless your name.
[35:18] I bless your name.
[35:21] Father God, we thank you for this
[35:22] morning. We thank you for your presence.
[35:24] We thank you because we are dependent on
[35:27] you. We see your moving of your spirit.
[35:31] You release an end time message that we
[35:32] can receive in our hearts. Lord, come
[35:35] and live among us this morning and come
[35:37] and confirm your word with signs,
[35:38] wonders, and miracles. I ask in Jesus
[35:40] name. Amen. Amen and amen. God bless you
[35:44] and welcome to our Sunday morning feast
[35:46] with the Lord. Amen.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So I want to welcome each
[35:50] and everyone one of you here this
[35:52] morning. And uh first I want to salute
[35:54] brother Jonathan Martin for the three
[35:56] inspiring messages
[35:58] given over the last weekend. Will I find
[36:01] faith? The motivating force of our lives
[36:04] and the dynamics is here.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; It was such a refreshing experience to
[36:09] know truly God had his men everywhere.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Men without agendas, men who are
[36:14] fearless, men who are not ashamed of the
[36:17] son of man or his words.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Also want to salute my precious brother
[36:21] here, brother Timothy Redhead,
[36:23] &gt;&gt; for ministering to us. and he'll be
[36:26] speaking to us this morning and blessing
[36:28] us with a word the gospel not so much
[36:30] for jump for joy but for a heart
[36:33] searching experience
[36:35] &gt;&gt; where men and women can get right with
[36:36] God. Now Deuteronomy chapter 28 is a
[36:40] powerful book, a powerful scripture
[36:42] where God say if you obey him what he
[36:44] will do for you and then he he talk
[36:47] about the curses if you don't want to
[36:49] obey him
[36:50] &gt;&gt; and if you obey him he'll bless you
[36:52] going out going in and everywhere and
[36:54] multiply and everything else
[36:56] &gt;&gt; but there's a particular verse there
[36:57] that was quite striking
[37:00] and uh brother Andrew uh Lulen brought
[37:03] that to my attention and I he says and
[37:05] and they shall be upon thee for a sign
[37:07] and for under upon the sea forever
[37:09] because thou servest not the Lord thy
[37:12] God with joyfulness
[37:14] and with gladness of heart for the
[37:17] abundance of all things. So God want you
[37:20] to serve him with joyfulness
[37:22] &gt;&gt; and gladness of heart
[37:24] &gt;&gt; not with grump
[37:26] &gt;&gt; with grumpiness and every other negative
[37:28] sort of thing. And this is where Psalms
[37:30] 100 is so powerful. Make a joyful noise
[37:34] unto the Lord all the lands. Serve the
[37:37] Lord with gladness.
[37:40] Come before his presence with singing.
[37:42] Know ye that the Lord, he is God. It is
[37:46] he that hath made us and not we
[37:47] ourselves. We are his people and the
[37:50] sheep of his pasture. Enter into his
[37:53] gates with thanksgiving and into his
[37:55] court with praise. Be thankful unto him
[37:58] and bless his name. For the Lord is
[38:00] good, his mercy is everlasting, and his
[38:03] truth endureth to all generations. Oh,
[38:06] give the Lord some praises this morning.
[38:08] So, that's how God want us to come into
[38:09] his house. Not with a long face, not
[38:12] like the whole burden like you carry the
[38:13] whole burden of the world upon your
[38:15] shoulder. No, but with joyfulness,
[38:17] &gt;&gt; with gratefulness. You don't hold
[38:19] tomorrow, but today. Today is your day.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; You are blessed to be here today. You
[38:24] are blessed to be alive today. You are
[38:26] blessed to have activity in your limbs
[38:28] today. So open your mouth and give God
[38:31] some praises.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Let us stand. Praise God.
[38:35] [Applause]
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; The cross. I want to sing that song in
[38:42] the cross. Jesus
[38:46] keeps
[38:49] winning
[38:52] the cross.
[38:54] Oh dear, my Lord.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Preious,
[39:03] [Music]
[39:08] &gt;&gt; free to all.
[39:13] A healing
[39:16] stream that flows that flows

[39:25] mountain
[39:29] in the cross.
[39:32] Hallelujah.
[39:34] In the cross,
[39:37] [Music]
[39:40] the cross
[39:45] be my glory.
[39:47] [Music]
[39:50] Hallelujah.
[39:53] Oh,
[39:55] [Music]
[39:57] in my wrath
[40:00] your soul
[40:03] shall find
[40:05] [Music]
[40:06] rest
[40:09] beyond
[40:12] the rain.
[40:14] Come on, sing it again. Oh,
[40:19] [Music]
[40:20] the cross.
[40:23] [Music]
[40:26] The cross
[40:32] be my glory.
[40:35] Glory
[40:36] [Music]
[40:38] in
[40:39] [Music]
[40:44] my wrestling
[40:47] [Music]
[41:05] Hallelujah.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Give him praise.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Lift your hands and give him praise.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Give him praise. Give him praise. Give
[41:16] him praise.
[41:18] I feel his presence.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; I feel his presence.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[41:28] Hallelujah.
[41:31] Hallelujah.
[41:34] Glory. Glory.
[41:38] Thank you.
[41:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory.
[41:44] [Music]
[41:48] Glory.
[41:50] Praise.
[41:54] Praise the name.
[41:56] Hallelujah.
[42:00] Hallelujah.
[42:11] Yeah.
[42:12] [Music]
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:21] [Music]
[42:29] Glory to God.
[42:37] Hallelujah.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[42:48] Omnipotent God. Hallelujah.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; We are grateful
[42:54] &gt;&gt; and we are blessed
[42:57] &gt;&gt; to be in your house
[42:59] &gt;&gt; this August morning.
[43:02] Lord, you alone know
[43:05] and nothing happens just by chance. It's
[43:08] all part of your plan.
[43:11] And we are here this morning to be so
[43:13] small
[43:15] that you can be seen
[43:18] and that you can be heard
[43:21] Lord because you always use men but Lord
[43:25] we have found out that we need to become
[43:28] invisible
[43:29] so that you become visible.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; We don't have a message. We all were
[43:35] born in sin.
[43:37] Came to this world speaking lies without
[43:40] a hope.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Had it not been for you
[43:50] and your power to seek
[43:53] &gt;&gt; and to save,
[43:55] &gt;&gt; we would not be here.
[43:58] And so we deem it a privilege
[44:01] &gt;&gt; and we deem it an honor
[44:04] &gt;&gt; to represent and to be part of the
[44:06] kingdom of heaven,
[44:08] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of heaven,
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, because without you, we are
[44:14] nothing.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; And without your presence,
[44:18] &gt;&gt; we would know nothing.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; And so I pray that you will just have
[44:22] your own way.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Help me. Help us
[44:27] &gt;&gt; and build faith
[44:29] &gt;&gt; and dismantle unbelief.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; May your presence that we feel now
[44:36] become visible
[44:38] &gt;&gt; and explode among us.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[44:40] &gt;&gt; and do your thing
[44:42] &gt;&gt; and achieve your plan.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; For we are unprofitable servants
[44:50] &gt;&gt; and there's nothing good in us.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know what is in man. So I have
[44:54] not come here for fame
[44:57] or for any other reason but that your
[45:00] people can receive a word from heaven.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; And so Lord God, we need your help. We
[45:07] need your help. We're in a dark hall.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; And if you don't help us, we perish. And
[45:11] you said in your word that gives us
[45:13] hope. You're not willing that we perish.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; But that we make it.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; And your journey to the cross will not
[45:20] be in vain. Amen.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; There will be
[45:24] &gt;&gt; a bride.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; There will be somebody to identify and
[45:28] said, "I appreciate you."
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Your coming was not in vain.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; The blood you shed.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; The drops you shed,
[45:37] &gt;&gt; the pain you went through, the anxieties
[45:39] you had, you even wept.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be in vain.
[45:52] So help us. God is not going to be in
[45:54] vain.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; And we will yet win
[45:58] &gt;&gt; and the bride, that little bride will
[46:00] yet overcome.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; We thank you that you were about your
[46:05] father's business and you would never
[46:06] deviated. You could have got married.
[46:09] You could have built a house. You could
[46:10] have done a lot of things, but
[46:14] we were more important.
[46:18] And our livelihood was more important.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; And you denied yourself these things.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; So that we wret sinners can become
[46:28] saints.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; We owe you.
[46:32] We can never repay you, but we can show
[46:35] appreciation.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; And that's why we are here this morning.
[46:39] Bless the brothers. Bless the people.
[46:41] Bless us all.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; And then don't forget me. Give me a
[46:44] blessing too. And we'll not forget to
[46:47] give you the praise, the honor, and the
[46:48] glory that is due to your mighty name,
[46:53] &gt;&gt; speak, touch,
[46:56] deliver, heal, raise up as only you
[46:59] alone can do.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; These things we ask in your magnificent
[47:03] name. I think of my brothers in Grenada
[47:07] who are listening and watching. May you
[47:09] touch them too. And wherever there are
[47:11] people of yours, wherever they may be
[47:13] this morning, don't forget them, Lord.
[47:16] We need you.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; If there was ever a time, if there was
[47:20] ever a moment, there was ever a period
[47:23] that we needed to get a word from you
[47:27] is now.
[47:30] And so, Father, I pray that you will we
[47:32] will not be disappointed because we come
[47:34] in faith so that you can meet our needs.
[47:38] These things I ask in Jesus precious
[47:40] name.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the people says,
[47:45] &gt;&gt; "Amen." And turn around and greet the
[47:48] person next to you.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can have your seats
[48:03] and just bear with me for being a
[48:07] &gt;&gt; cry baby.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[48:16] Hallelujah. I
[48:20] &gt;&gt; usually before I preach or not preach
[48:24] before God uses me, I spend the day in
[48:27] his presence and I avoid going anywhere
[48:31] so that I can
[48:33] first of all consecrate myself cuz this
[48:37] place might look simple but this is a
[48:40] place of life and death.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. and your souls and my soul
[48:46] are involved and therefore the things
[48:49] that you hear from me it must be from
[48:51] him.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; I cannot save you. He has already done
[48:55] that.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; I cannot heal you. He has already done
[48:59] that.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; But he can use me to reach you
[49:02] &gt;&gt; and he can use you to hear what we say.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; And we are praying that that's what's
[49:08] going to be done this morning.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:11] I yesterday I had a real battle
[49:16] and I realized that
[49:19] God wanted you to get something. But the
[49:21] enemy was determined to fight
[49:24] and whatever you do this morning. Even
[49:27] if you don't remember me, remember these
[49:30] words
[49:32] because words are what is going to judge
[49:34] us by
[49:35] &gt;&gt; his word.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Words are not ordinary. They are
[49:39] spirits.
[49:40] and they have life or death in them.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to pay close attention to
[49:45] the things that I'm going to share with
[49:47] you this morning that the Lord has given
[49:49] me cuz I myself cannot do this. I don't
[49:52] have enough brains and I do not have
[49:55] enough
[49:57] degrees.
[49:59] I did not even go to a university. I I
[50:02] you notice I can't even use a computer.
[50:04] This is my computer.
[50:06] So, I am the least of the preachers
[50:10] and I pray that the Lord will be able to
[50:13] speak to you this morning.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Isaac told me I don't have to
[50:17] panic about time. That don't mean I
[50:20] won't go forever, but it just means that
[50:23] I'll be able to go as God desires and
[50:27] stop when he says stop. Cuz whatever I
[50:30] say is not going to mean nothing. But
[50:32] whatever he says, it will be used on
[50:36] that day.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; So remember, you're not here to see one
[50:40] another, which is good. You're not here
[50:42] to show off the nice dand, which is
[50:45] good, but you're here to hear words of
[50:48] eternal life.
[50:51] [Applause]
[50:54] &gt;&gt; In Grenada, whenever somebody dies, they
[50:57] say, "Rest in peace." But of course,
[51:00] that's because they don't know better.
[51:02] Cuz if you did not take the word and
[51:06] become the word, then how you going to
[51:08] have peace when everything the word said
[51:12] is stored in your computer, your heart?
[51:16] And every time you had an opportunity
[51:19] to hear those words and to live those
[51:22] words,
[51:23] &gt;&gt; it's recorded. God don't chase you. He
[51:26] doesn't have to follow you and to come
[51:28] behind you and see where you're going.
[51:30] This is what does it
[51:32] &gt;&gt; and therefore
[51:34] whatever you hear is what you're going
[51:36] to be judged by.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Because as the people say in Grenada,
[51:40] you're big on your sense.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; So therefore, you use that to be able to
[51:46] live the word that you hear.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; So let's go to the word cuz as I said,
[51:51] you didn't come to hear me. You come to
[51:54] hear the word. And this morning for
[51:56] those who did not see what the uh
[51:59] monitor put up, I'm going to try to
[52:02] speak on faith is the antidote to
[52:05] dismantle the poison of unbelief.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know that unbelief is
[52:11] a poison.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Unbelief is the dreadest phenomena the
[52:17] Christian bride will ever have to deal
[52:20] with. Amen.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; And the only difference between the
[52:24] bride that cannot be deceived and the
[52:25] one that is deceived is unbelief.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; And because unbelief is a deadly thing,
[52:31] we want to make sure we are not walking
[52:33] with it. We are not carrying it. And we
[52:36] are not we don't have it in us.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Because after all is said and done,
[52:40] you're balling, you're crying. It's not
[52:43] going to help you over there.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Anything you have to do is here.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Everything you have to do is here. Once
[52:50] you close your eyes, that's it.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; And as a tree leans, it falls. You can't
[52:57] be leaning so fall back. So,
[52:59] and your works testify
[53:02] of your life.
[53:05] So, let's turn our Bibles to
[53:09] John 14:12.
[53:17] John 14:12.
[53:20] And I know that you are younger than me,
[53:22] so you'll get it before me. So I'm going
[53:25] to read now because I'm going to believe
[53:27] you have it. Father God, these are red
[53:29] letter words in this holy Bible. That
[53:33] means they can never die. And even
[53:35] though they were spoken 2,000 years ago,
[53:38] it is as real as it is today.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; And so, Father God, I pray you will
[53:43] bless it, multiply it, and let it bring
[53:46] back that which you sent it out for.
[53:48] Amen. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he
[53:52] that believeth on me, the works that I
[53:55] do shall he do also. And greater works
[53:59] than these shall ye do, because I go
[54:02] unto my father. And whatsoever you shall
[54:05] ask in my name, that will I do, that the
[54:08] father may be glorified in the Son. The
[54:10] second one is Matthew 13.
[54:14] Matthew 13.
[54:19] reading from verse
[54:21] 53
[54:24] and that's tongue in the back.
[54:30] And may the Lord bless the word. And it
[54:32] came to pass that when Jesus had
[54:34] finished these parables, he departed
[54:36] then. And when he was come into his own
[54:38] country, he taught them in their
[54:40] synagogue in so much that they were
[54:42] astonished and said, "Whence had this
[54:44] man this wisdom and these mighty works?
[54:47] Is not this the carpenter son? Is not
[54:49] his mother called Mary and his brethren
[54:52] James and Josie and Simon and Judas and
[54:55] his sisters? Are they not all with us?"
[54:57] When's then had this man all these
[54:59] things? Watch that. And they were
[55:01] offended in him. were offended in him
[55:05] because they didn't know that a man like
[55:08] that could be doing these works.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; And they said, "And he said unto them, a
[55:13] prophet is without not without honor,
[55:15] save in his own country and in his own
[55:18] house." Watch verse 58. You could read
[55:20] with me. And he did not many mighty
[55:24] works there because of their unbelief.
[55:27] He didn't say he didn't speak but he did
[55:31] not let the words that he spoke manifest
[55:33] itself into works. So you can hear a lot
[55:37] of words but the manifestation of that
[55:39] word to become life is a whole different
[55:42] thing
[55:43] &gt;&gt; because unbelief can block that word
[55:46] from birthing
[55:49] &gt;&gt; fake things like miracles and signs and
[55:52] wonders. You can have your seats
[55:55] and I'm going to go straight into the
[55:56] meat.
[55:59] As we said, faith is the antidote to
[56:01] this monthlong belief. We started it
[56:02] some time ago. And by the way, let me
[56:04] give thanks and praise to brother to God
[56:07] for men like brother or Isaac and and
[56:10] for bringing me here this Sunday morning
[56:12] so I can share these things with you.
[56:14] And as I said, I trust that it will help
[56:16] you. Now the most common reason I'm
[56:20] going to share these things and then get
[56:22] into the word to dismantle something
[56:26] is for maintenance,
[56:28] repair or to remove unsafe or obsolete
[56:31] items. The purpose can range from
[56:34] getting a better understanding of how a
[56:37] complex system works and we can also
[56:40] dismantle something to identify
[56:42] weaknesses or faulty parts
[56:45] &gt;&gt; so as to replace the damage or worn out
[56:47] parts worn out parts and it looked like
[56:51] some of the bride some of the people in
[56:53] this message have become a little worn
[56:56] out
[56:57] &gt;&gt; and it's visible in the way you sing
[57:01] in the way you worship. ship.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; It may look good,
[57:04] &gt;&gt; but God who has been in there since when
[57:06] the angels were in heaven and he compare
[57:09] how you were singing there and how you
[57:12] are singing here. He says, "Tim, go and
[57:15] talk to them cuz they can't come back up
[57:18] there the way they are now.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; They have to return to that old original
[57:23] place
[57:24] &gt;&gt; as Job saw."
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; When he was asked, "Where were you?" G.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; And if we were there and we came from
[57:34] God and we going back to God,
[57:36] &gt;&gt; we definitely can't go how we are now
[57:39] &gt;&gt; because heaven is a wonderful place.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; You think you're wonderful? Turns to
[57:43] somebody and say, "I am wonderful
[57:47] with that face."
[57:52] Wonderful speaks of spontaneous joy and
[57:56] and light.
[57:58] Your eyes have light.
[58:00] It speaks of no offense, no uh whatever
[58:05] we call hindrances,
[58:07] &gt;&gt; no guide.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; It speaks of being trusting.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Wonderful. Is a wonderful
[58:14] place filled with glory and grace.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; And then we say, I want to see my
[58:22] savior's face. Heaven is a wonderful.
[58:25] Heaven is a glorious. Heaven ain't going
[58:28] to have people who are not wonderful.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; You got to prepare now.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; You can't wait until after dead and do
[58:38] like the Roman Catholics. What you
[58:39] going? We're going to do a Dina and we
[58:40] going and see if we could raise the
[58:42] dead.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; You have to do that now.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Fix it now.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; You remember how you were 25 years ago?
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Pull the tape and show you worshiping 25
[58:56] years ago. and show you worshiping now.
[58:59] And the question would be, what have you
[59:00] lost?
[59:03] What have we lost? Uh why is there a a
[59:07] worn out
[59:09] service? Now, I'm not talking to you
[59:11] alone. Grenada is listening to me now.
[59:13] So, I'm talking to everybody. And I'm
[59:15] glad because you can't say who I talking
[59:17] to.
[59:20] So, if the parts are worn out, you have
[59:23] to dismantle. So once the change is
[59:26] done, it leads to improvement,
[59:28] smoother operation, more efficiency,
[59:32] superior performance.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; I remember uh uh fellowshipping with
[59:37] brother Clarence and we were talking
[59:40] about Abel and we were talking about
[59:42] Cain and Abel's sacrifice was similar to
[59:46] Cain but there was a difference.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Abel's sacrifice was what? More
[59:50] excellent.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Excellent. Excellent is a word that is
[59:54] only given to above normal.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; You don't say excellent is something
[59:58] that passed degrade or he did well.
[1:00:01] Excellent means beyond
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; what is expected.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; And his sacrifice.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; So talk to me.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; His sacrifice was more excellent
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; than Cain.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Cain was there.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Cain brought his sacrifice and he had
[1:00:20] all his fandangle and his rituals and so
[1:00:22] on. But Abel,
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Abel
[1:00:26] went down into the soul.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; He went down into a place where his
[1:00:30] hands got dirty
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; with blood.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; You know we are scornful. I want to
[1:00:38] touch this. Uh-uh. He was identified
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; with that bloody sacrifice. He was not
[1:00:46] ashamed to be identified with his
[1:00:49] origin.
[1:00:54] But Kane who was a nice proper sad child
[1:00:58] you know decent
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; came permanent proper
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; oh me papa oh me you know what I'm
[1:01:07] talking about and God did not even stay
[1:01:11] turn his back on him and send no smoke
[1:01:13] to stifle him and chase him out
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; he was not accepted
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; and God can't change.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Remember, you're not dealing with papa
[1:01:23] or brother T or me. Many times people
[1:01:27] come to please the pastor, but you're
[1:01:28] missing it.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; You here to please God.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; You're not breathing my air. I don't
[1:01:35] tell you breathe. Breathe. I don't tell
[1:01:38] you that. And you don't wait for me to
[1:01:40] say, "Okay, can I stop breathing?" No.
[1:01:43] God is the one that giving you breath.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Then give him his praise.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Give him his honor.
[1:01:49] give him his glory.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; So, let's go on with this um dismantling
[1:01:55] because for those ladies, you know,
[1:01:56] they're not too familiar with these
[1:01:58] words. So, I want you to get it.
[1:01:59] Dismantling means to break it up, twist
[1:02:02] it, mash it up, move it from where it
[1:02:05] was.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; And what is are we doing that to
[1:02:08] unbelief?
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Look at you sitting here. Can anybody
[1:02:11] see if you have unbelief?
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Where would he be hiding?
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Not in your shoes. Not in your socks,
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; not in your handbag.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; That old criminal is hiding inside.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; He took a trip. He took a trip with you
[1:02:28] and he says, "We're going to church this
[1:02:30] morning."
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; And he and he jing it with you on the
[1:02:34] highway.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; And as I was driving, I watched 100 and
[1:02:39] I watched June. I said 100.
[1:02:43] And I realized in Trinidad, those signs
[1:02:46] are not for you. is for the birds.
[1:02:49] Might as well they remove it. Nobody
[1:02:52] don't study it. People are just gone.
[1:02:56] And brother T was talking about
[1:02:58] boundaries that is not for Trinies.
[1:03:02] I'm like I'm amazed. Everybody's boom.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; I wonder if they take out the signs what
[1:03:09] they would do.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; I wonder what you do
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; behind God. I tell you what. But so I
[1:03:18] maybe that's for the birds.
[1:03:21] Now to bring this into a spiritual
[1:03:23] context,
[1:03:25] when unbelief is dismantled in a
[1:03:27] believer, it leads to a deeper, more
[1:03:30] trusting and powerful relationship with
[1:03:32] God.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; The defeat of doubt and unbelief allows
[1:03:37] for increased spiritual maturity,
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; greater fruitfulness in one's life.
[1:03:43] Faith is definitely stronger because the
[1:03:46] previous obstacles between a person and
[1:03:48] God are obliterated.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Big word but means destroyed.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Do you agree?
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now don't want I don't want you to
[1:03:59] just say amen. I want you to think about
[1:04:01] it.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; As I told you already, I'm a person that
[1:04:04] observes. I like to observe things
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; because many people act automatic. Yes.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; they just do thing, but they don't even
[1:04:12] know why they do it.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; I like to observe. Why did I do that?
[1:04:15] Why did I say that? Where is it coming
[1:04:18] from? What's the source? That explosive
[1:04:21] temper. Where is it coming from?
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Is that really me?
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; All right. So, it leads to a more
[1:04:30] intimate connection where one can
[1:04:32] actively taste and see that the Lord is
[1:04:35] good. Now these are notes on dismantling
[1:04:38] unbelief. So I ain't preaching yet. I'm
[1:04:41] just giving you the notes. So it does
[1:04:44] heighten personal experiences. Are you
[1:04:46] getting that?
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; So notice them things. Intimate
[1:04:49] connection,
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; closer walk, fruitfulness. So if these
[1:04:54] things are missing, you should by now
[1:04:56] deduce cuz I know you're big and you
[1:04:58] have sense
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; why you don't have those things or why
[1:05:02] those things are existing. So, I'm not
[1:05:05] here to unsave you. I'm here to help you
[1:05:08] to really get saved
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; to really connect with God
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; so that when you leave here, the the
[1:05:15] anointing doesn't leave you.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz too many times the anointing lasts
[1:05:21] as long as you're driving down the
[1:05:22] highway
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; and by the time you come to the next
[1:05:25] service, you got to crank up again.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; That should not be bride.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Leave that for Pentecost. Leave that for
[1:05:34] people who looking for something.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; But you're supposed to have something.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to have something more
[1:05:40] valuable, more excellent.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Then we have to demonstrate it. And I am
[1:05:47] one of those people. Like I said, I have
[1:05:49] a lot of good preachers. You had the
[1:05:50] brother from thing. And these are men. I
[1:05:52] can't even dream of preaching like them.
[1:05:54] But I like to when I come to you and God
[1:05:58] uses me that when you finish you have to
[1:06:00] check yourself
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; because in the message you have a lot of
[1:06:04] nice people
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; but not many Christians.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Glory. So let's go on. So overcoming
[1:06:16] unbelief replaces anxiety and fear
[1:06:19] because you have got peace that passes
[1:06:22] all understanding.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; So now we graduate from questioning why
[1:06:27] me and instead realize that God is doing
[1:06:29] a work in you that is working for your
[1:06:32] good.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; A lot of people hear that verse all
[1:06:34] things work together for the good not
[1:06:36] me.
[1:06:38] It is for the believer. The things in
[1:06:40] your life are working for God's good in
[1:06:43] you, not your good. We don't we not
[1:06:45] good.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; We don't even know he's good.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Because what we should do, we don't do.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know it's good for you to obey
[1:06:54] the speed limit?
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Your car, not mine.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Everybody get quiet, please. I'm
[1:07:06] visiting.
[1:07:08] All right.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham taught that too
[1:07:11] because he told Billy Paul, he said,
[1:07:12] "No, I'm my hand will behind your head
[1:07:14] like a hammer. So every time you go over
[1:07:16] the speed limit, you knock it."
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I was talking to June. She
[1:07:20] say, "I'm going to pay this speed
[1:07:21] limit." So I look across, I peep and I
[1:07:23] see 104,
[1:07:25] 108.
[1:07:28] I'm so sorry. Forgive me.
[1:07:33] So additionally,
[1:07:36] it's for your good. So, additionally,
[1:07:38] rather than placing a personal
[1:07:39] experience in judgment against what the
[1:07:41] Bible teaches, this new faith allows a
[1:07:44] believer to accept the word as the final
[1:07:47] authority in the issues we face in life,
[1:07:52] leading to a more excellent
[1:07:53] understanding of God and his plan.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; If the people of God could come to that
[1:07:58] place, then we could go back to the
[1:08:00] apostolic days. We talk apostolic. We
[1:08:03] like what we heard, but what about what
[1:08:05] we seeing, what we experiencing? Aren't
[1:08:08] you concerned? Where are those days?
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; I believe in the book of Acts. I believe
[1:08:14] in the works that we saw in the book of
[1:08:16] Acts, but that is not for us to hear as
[1:08:18] history.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; That's for us to to model ourselves
[1:08:22] after. So the same baptism they got, we
[1:08:26] must have. And the same God they met, we
[1:08:28] must meet. And if we are not doing what
[1:08:31] they did,
[1:08:34] Call a heart.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; As I said, this is what God gave me to
[1:08:40] give you.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; If you vex, read the text.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; You would realize by now that unbelief
[1:08:48] acts as a barrier to the unbeliever,
[1:08:51] thus limiting what God can do in their
[1:08:53] life. However, once unbelief is
[1:08:56] dismantled completely, there is an
[1:08:58] immediate flow of God's blessings for
[1:09:01] it's a lifegiving power of explosion,
[1:09:05] what you call dynamics. It is restored
[1:09:07] and then the promises of God begin to
[1:09:09] come to pass.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; The promises of God is not for them
[1:09:12] alone.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible says is the seed is is not
[1:09:16] seed, not every Abraham alone, but the
[1:09:18] Abraham and his seed. Seed refers to
[1:09:22] faith. Cuz Abraham is the father of
[1:09:26] faith.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; And if we don't have faith, what do we
[1:09:29] have?
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; You get the picture? Cuz you either have
[1:09:32] one or the other. You either have a
[1:09:34] doubting devil or a believing faith.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; And if we have a believing faith, it
[1:09:42] don't make us like that.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; We go up.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Not like that. Cuz we are climbing into
[1:09:50] the statue of a perfect man. You can't
[1:09:52] be climbing into a stat in the statue of
[1:09:54] perfect man and every day you're going
[1:09:56] back to see what wrong with patience
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; and you climb back down to see I wonder
[1:10:01] if my faith fix who move it and then you
[1:10:04] going back up faith virtue knowledge and
[1:10:06] then temperance and then you had to go
[1:10:08] back to see the knowledge right
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; every day up and down what you think
[1:10:13] guys up and down the deck
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; this is statue god building you not
[1:10:18] building it
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; so leave it alone
[1:10:22] Amen.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Let the word build faith. Let the word
[1:10:26] build virtue. Let the word build
[1:10:28] knowledge.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; And you can't build those things if you
[1:10:32] don't believe the word.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to come to the end of
[1:10:38] your way and then you say them preachers
[1:10:39] lie to me.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to make you feel good. I am
[1:10:44] not here to rub you and give massage.
[1:10:45] Got to go in them therapist to do that.
[1:10:50] I am here to make you check
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; is all right. Is everything all right?
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Are you dying? Do you need the antidote?
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; How is it going to be when you come to
[1:11:01] cross Jordan? Are you going to be at
[1:11:03] rest? Why you going to be screaming run
[1:11:04] all over the place?
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; I had a grand uncle cousin rather and he
[1:11:12] wanted me to do his will cuz you know I
[1:11:14] work in the bank. I have a little bit of
[1:11:16] banking knowledge but he thought I have
[1:11:18] supposed to have legal knowledge. So he
[1:11:20] said I want you to do the will and he
[1:11:22] had a lot of children but very mis
[1:11:24] disagreeable and mischievous. So when I
[1:11:27] came to do it he was also sick and
[1:11:28] dying. So I said listen I'm going to New
[1:11:30] York and I came here to do the will to
[1:11:32] write it up. So he wrote it up and he
[1:11:36] leave people. I said what you do number
[1:11:37] that one is all your children. So I help
[1:11:39] him put them in because he said left of
[1:11:41] them they gain nothing.
[1:11:43] So I say if I sign and that I want to
[1:11:45] make sure it's as fair as possible.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; So we do everything ready to sign in
[1:11:50] ready.
[1:11:52] I say you sign it. I'm going away now.
[1:11:54] He said go and come back.
[1:11:58] Truth be told while I'm over there they
[1:12:00] said oh my god when he lying down he
[1:12:02] just getting up and run. He just g up
[1:12:04] and run. He can't sit down. Why the
[1:12:06] devil after him?
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Playback time.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; He ain't dead yet and he running. Amen.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz he did a lot of wrong.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; He did a lot of things that he should
[1:12:18] not have done. And he he he prayed dead.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Many of us looked like we okay
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; until
[1:12:28] we start gasping
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; and then all of a sudden you want to
[1:12:32] know. You know there's a lot of people
[1:12:33] like that. They have a lot of secrets
[1:12:34] but they ain't going to let them go
[1:12:36] unless they're dying.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Been making things right unless they're
[1:12:40] dying. didn't fixing offenses and as
[1:12:43] said my God
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; who does hinder us where we get that
[1:12:50] from
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; unbelief.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; You don't can't be waiting until he
[1:12:57] dying to fix things.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Don't man that ever get that chance was
[1:13:00] the thief
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; and the thief had repent and Jesus
[1:13:04] forgive his sins.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; You there with Jesus you dying when he
[1:13:07] there by you right now. Amen.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Only if you're in me. So you can claim
[1:13:13] that you thief and at the last minute I
[1:13:16] go wait until I get and then say Lord I
[1:13:18] surrender myself to thee.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Back home in Grenada
[1:13:26] in the revolution. My my
[1:13:29] cousin was the wife of Morris Bishop and
[1:13:32] I found myself in the revolution. In the
[1:13:34] revolution the revolution was not in me.
[1:13:36] I found myself in a big following thing.
[1:13:40] My father kicked me out of the house. He
[1:13:41] said the Bible and the gun don't go
[1:13:42] together. And there I was in the what do
[1:13:45] we call the radio station looking for
[1:13:47] Americans and we were singing let them
[1:13:49] come. We go bury them in the sea. When
[1:13:52] you're stupid, you're blind.
[1:13:58] We even have a plane.
[1:14:01] We even have a helicopter.
[1:14:04] Let them come. Let them come. We go bury
[1:14:07] them in the sea. And we set a truck from
[1:14:09] Cuba.
[1:14:11] And I them
[1:14:14] cuz I don't know better. And I had a
[1:14:16] little Beretta.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; It's a little Beretta.
[1:14:22] And we felt that we were defending the
[1:14:24] country.
[1:14:27] I don't know if you hearing me.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; And I was defending something that I
[1:14:32] didn't believe in. Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; How do I know that? Because all they
[1:14:36] have to say is crack
[1:14:38] and I home home.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And many people come to church cuz the
[1:14:47] day with them.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Light and we
[1:14:56] take it to them.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Any let's go on.
[1:15:03] So when you dismantle unbelief, a
[1:15:05] Christian can begin to bear fruit,
[1:15:07] spiritual fruit. As they say, you're
[1:15:09] connected to Jesus Christ, the true
[1:15:10] vine, because unbelief is dismantled.
[1:15:13] Faith is replaced. It strengthens this
[1:15:15] spiritual connection leading to a life
[1:15:17] that automatically produce the fruit of
[1:15:20] the spirit. Then here comes our lovely
[1:15:22] family walking through life. Here comes
[1:15:25] love, joy, longsuffering, brotherly
[1:15:27] kindness, temperance, patience. It's
[1:15:29] like a a lovely family going down. you
[1:15:31] is that family all that in you
[1:15:35] [Applause]
[1:15:39] but the devil don't want you to have
[1:15:41] that so he's giving you his lie he's
[1:15:44] giving you his truth that he turned his
[1:15:46] truth which is a lie you know the devil
[1:15:48] have truth
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; the devil truth is his lie anything you
[1:15:54] hold on to is your truth
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; you have god truth and you have your
[1:15:59] truth and when you go in court you have
[1:16:00] them truth
[1:16:03] That's right.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; We have three truth.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; But I know it's only one
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; because if you are if you are called to
[1:16:10] connect and to give a account for
[1:16:12] something that happened, you have your
[1:16:14] side.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Your side is your truth.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; And your truth is to protect what you
[1:16:18] did even though you're wrong.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; I wonder if you're hearing me. And then
[1:16:26] there's God truth,
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; which is total truth. And that's his
[1:16:31] word.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm bringing to you this
[1:16:34] morning. And I pray God by the time you
[1:16:35] finish it's so dismantled that you even
[1:16:37] pick it up.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; You'll never touch it again.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz you need faith to have these
[1:16:44] qualities. Love, joy, peace,
[1:16:45] longsuffering. Something you get now and
[1:16:47] 6 months after it gone.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; God don't give like Indians.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; I mean American Indians don't take this
[1:16:55] wrong.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Give and take back. you will give you
[1:17:00] because you know that you will keep it.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; So if you have eternal life, here comes
[1:17:04] the things that goes with them. Love,
[1:17:06] joy, peace, love that is permanent.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Then what happened to the church? You
[1:17:12] came in a message full of joy, full of
[1:17:13] praise. You jump in your bubble and
[1:17:15] right now you ain't even have a bottle.
[1:17:18] [Music]
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Way it went.
[1:17:22] That's why I'm here this morning
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; to challenge you
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; to stop playing
[1:17:31] [Applause]
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; this thing real
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; is power as we dealing with
[1:17:39] principalities not because you see the
[1:17:41] devil don't mean there
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; cuz if you had power over the devil he
[1:17:46] would not be able to dominate your
[1:17:47] thoughts
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; and make you negative and make You have
[1:17:52] art.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; You know, I don't know if anybody have
[1:17:56] art against anybody and not even look at
[1:17:58] it as art and say that my right.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; How could art be right?
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; She would do it. Not me.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Hey, and I ain't Not because
[1:18:10] you're a Christian, you stupid.
[1:18:12] When the Bible says if you're going to
[1:18:14] pray and you what? Fix it.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Make it right.
[1:18:21] It had nothing to do with he wrong and I
[1:18:23] right. You just identify you're in a
[1:18:25] place where there's you fix years.
[1:18:32] [Applause]
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; I am married and my wife is still like
[1:18:36] bobbing outside
[1:18:39] and she acts in certain ways that
[1:18:42] doesn't affect me. I be I am still a
[1:18:45] Christian. So I don't care what she do
[1:18:48] it. And when I say that we guard it now,
[1:18:51] I don't mean you don't you just do
[1:18:52] anything. But I'm saying whatever it is,
[1:18:54] it doesn't interfere with my
[1:18:57] responsibility and my faith to God to be
[1:19:01] a Christian to love them and deal with
[1:19:04] them in love
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; because I said to God till death
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; better or was
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; still dead. If she behaving bad that
[1:19:19] don't change me
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; it's still that
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; otherwise don't don't interfere with
[1:19:25] them people think
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; marriage is not for everybody
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; marriage is not the white dress alone
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; cuz after the white come many colors
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; and some is black
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; are you hearing me
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; so as no matter what she does I am still
[1:19:45] her husband
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; and I still Treat them with love
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; regardless.
[1:19:51] [Applause]
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; That's my faith.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; If God really do something for you, you
[1:20:01] don't have to go and and sauterize them.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; That's a word we have in Grenada.
[1:20:05] Sautterize
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; and say, "Well, that could work, but not
[1:20:09] that. This could work, but not that."
[1:20:11] The life of Christ is everywhere. Jesus
[1:20:14] was so cool with Judas that Judas taking
[1:20:16] for granted.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Every time you see him friend, it's not
[1:20:21] that time he call him friend. He was
[1:20:22] always calling him friend.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus was always calling friend and he
[1:20:27] get carried away with that.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; And he give him the bag.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; If he wasn't calling friend, he wouldn't
[1:20:34] take it.
[1:20:36] Amen.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we are set up to see what
[1:20:40] we would do
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; just to see what is in you.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; God knew Job, but he he wanted him Job
[1:20:48] to know what is in him.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; All those men that came and and dealt
[1:20:56] with Job, listen, if you listen to them,
[1:20:59] they were inspired by the devil.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Yet they were believers. Amen.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Everything they tell him is to take away
[1:21:06] his faith to dismantle his faith and
[1:21:09] bring in unbelief.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Job wife who was we don't know if she's
[1:21:15] a believer but she tell him boy cause
[1:21:17] God.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Therefore you can't tell him cause God
[1:21:21] if you're in
[1:21:23] she god
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; and she said boy your conditions too
[1:21:28] terrible cause God back up. There we go.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz you're done dead already.
[1:21:34] What? Job said,
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; did he listen to his wife?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "You speak." He said, "I
[1:21:40] foolish.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; You and the man have the Holy Ghost yet.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; He just have faith in God.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; The atonement was not yet made. Men
[1:21:48] still going in paradise.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; So don't tell me it can't be done."
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me, "Well, you know, I ain't
[1:21:57] had the Holy Ghost." Hush. Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; This is an easy thing Pharisees did.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; You don't need the Holy Ghost to be
[1:22:05] kind.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Normal, but we get so into the thing
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; that we have to say something to justify
[1:22:17] our wickedness.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Come on now, man.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; We could do better than that. And the
[1:22:27] devil love to hear you talk toishness.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, die." How you see it? Give
[1:22:32] him more.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; And you there in a proverbial, you know
[1:22:36] why you call it the decimal that don't
[1:22:38] stop.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; I mean, you you satisfied living like
[1:22:41] that.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; You come into church all the time and
[1:22:43] you even worried. Let me go and get
[1:22:45] brother to pray for me because this
[1:22:46] devil is time for me to burn him.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; But he gets so the devil smart because
[1:22:53] when he see that you're getting frantic,
[1:22:54] he just cool. Cool.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden the torment on the
[1:23:00] way you were it get nice
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; and you have people like that in church
[1:23:04] nice in church.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Go and meet them home.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; I'm dismantling unbelief.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying it's time for the church
[1:23:14] of God clean up
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; and go back to God. Go back to the word.
[1:23:18] Go back to the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; And if we don't take stock, we ain't
[1:23:24] going nowhere. That's right.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; And I don't think brother go sit down
[1:23:27] and let the church jo me I ain't doing
[1:23:30] that.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you this. If it's between
[1:23:33] me and you and going in heaven, you
[1:23:35] lose.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; There's no way I will push you in.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Let me go up and see if I can pull you
[1:23:44] up.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; I go through all this life. I want to
[1:23:49] make heaven and I go play with it.
[1:23:52] When the rich young ruler did all ten
[1:23:54] commandments
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; and Jesus say go and sell all that you
[1:23:58] have and come
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; and the man could come.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; He could have come to ask him but he
[1:24:04] cannot come to live.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Why it easy to talk
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; something else to live
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; and home have real donsai
[1:24:17] cash ching
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; counting it every morning.
[1:24:22] And many people in the message every day
[1:24:24] they watch your bank book balance.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you did.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; You staying here.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Let me move on cuz I really don't want
[1:24:37] to get in trouble.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; So, here comes the lovely family. Love,
[1:24:42] joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
[1:24:43] and so on. And and at the helm is
[1:24:46] charity. Oh my. Instead of allowing
[1:24:48] doubts to cause hesitation and
[1:24:50] disobedience, this believer is now
[1:24:52] conquering the attributes of unbelief.
[1:24:54] The sin that once ruled you, now you
[1:24:57] have to overcome it. They have whipped
[1:24:59] it. They have conquered it. Watch out.
[1:25:01] Here comes an unstoppable energy of life
[1:25:04] emanating from the close position with
[1:25:06] God. And that's what the devil knows.
[1:25:07] And that's what he's afraid of. And
[1:25:09] that's what he keep coming to you in
[1:25:11] these things.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; He knows the power.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; How many years in a message are we
[1:25:16] saying? wait until the church get to
[1:25:18] know who she is. When
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; when all are we dead?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; It's supposed to be now.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; And we as preachers had to get backbone
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; and get some gill
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; so we could get belly
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; and preach it.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; We not here to please you. We are here
[1:25:39] to destroy the devil and please God.
[1:25:48] So
[1:25:50] watch it now. So you have overcome it
[1:25:53] the close. All right. So they are
[1:25:56] through with mental reasoning. They are
[1:25:58] through with mental um
[1:26:01] s swings. Oh mental swings, mood swings.
[1:26:04] That's another thing we just blame. We
[1:26:06] just say but you know the menopause
[1:26:08] the hormones.
[1:26:10] I didn't know hormones is a devil. You
[1:26:13] thought hormones is a thing in your
[1:26:14] body, a biological thing. We blame
[1:26:17] hormones for all the way we react and
[1:26:19] then we fly off in the house. Yeah. You
[1:26:21] say you know how the hormones be
[1:26:24] or this is monten
[1:26:27] month making you be so
[1:26:30] but we need to rip at the end

[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Don't you fear God?
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; You have enough word to be able to raise
[1:27:30] the dead.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; I can't bring you no message mysteries.

[1:27:39] to me? How come you can't overcome the
[1:27:41] devil?
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; A lot of churches they they graduate
[1:27:46] mysteries
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; when they preaching. You know many time
[1:27:49] I meet people in certain churches in
[1:27:50] this message and when they start to talk
[1:27:52] I mean I just listen to everybody. When
[1:27:53] they start to talk I I lost.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; When I tell you lost I in the message
[1:27:59] I'm send seven. I read the Bible about
[1:28:01] 15 times and them men lose me
[1:28:05] between this and that and how brother t
[1:28:07] this and tie that and I said brother
[1:28:09] must a seven them even making him

[1:28:58] you.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; I was coming down there and they were
[1:29:01] saying you know the the graveyard and
[1:29:03] them fill up they using new hole and
[1:29:05] because them hole and them full up and I
[1:29:07] was thinking well all them bodies in
[1:29:09] there where they going and then I
[1:29:11] realized that is irrelevant.
[1:29:14] This thing here
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; is like a person that used to live in a
[1:29:18] nice nice house and the dead and now the
[1:29:19] house they have cockroach
[1:29:22] weed snake
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; and all kind of thing in a house that
[1:29:26] was once a mansion.
[1:29:28] So don't don't so concern about this
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; concern about which your soul going
[1:29:35] [Applause]
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; in your patience possess what
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; and people here have no patience
[1:29:46] everybody want to drive
[1:29:48] one little road so you're supposed to
[1:29:50] wait because you have a traffic so they
[1:29:52] coming through
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Christians
[1:29:59] Sorry.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And the devil love when we disobey and
[1:30:07] when we behave like that because he's an
[1:30:09] accuser. So you say, "God, watch that.
[1:30:11] Watch watch watch
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; watch."
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; And God sigh and say, "Okay, I'll keep
[1:30:19] sending them the word."
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; And you get preachers from all over.
[1:30:28] What you do with it is important. You
[1:30:30] think you're getting away from this
[1:30:31] message this morning.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; It's good to be here, but it's better to
[1:30:35] be up there.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; All right, let's move on. I don't want
[1:30:41] to get bogged down.
[1:30:43] So, they are there with mental reasoning
[1:30:47] through with mental
[1:30:49] swings. One day low, next day high. They
[1:30:52] are no longer leaning on their own
[1:30:53] understanding. Why they are fully and
[1:30:55] unreservedly trusting in God. Watch that
[1:30:58] life
[1:31:00] worries are eroded because who the son
[1:31:02] of man said prays what
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; is that only a memory verse? I see some
[1:31:05] school long say memory verse. What you
[1:31:07] think a memory verse for? To learn and
[1:31:08] forget
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; to live.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; You give it to the children so they
[1:31:15] would live later. He said train them in
[1:31:17] the young and then when they old they
[1:31:18] wouldn't forget.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; I'm a product of that.
[1:31:22] Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; But this generation ain't even going to
[1:31:24] church much less Sunday on Sunday
[1:31:25] school.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; I got while I was preparing, I had a
[1:31:32] real hard fight preparing this message.
[1:31:35] And the Lord gave me a dream this
[1:31:37] morning. And I tell you what, the bride
[1:31:40] needs to check herself
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; and take action.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; And I'm using the word bride because I
[1:31:45] can't tell you nothing. But I can tell
[1:31:46] you this, things are not so clicking.
[1:31:49] things are not so what we would call
[1:31:51] okay.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; There's darkness
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; in the place
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; and we need to put on the light.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Don't take things for granted. Check
[1:32:02] your life.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; This is time to leave. This is not time
[1:32:06] to stay.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; This is time to check yourself.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; All these messages is think oh my god.
[1:32:12] Are you going to be waiting until that
[1:32:14] time to say, "Oh my god, the rich man,
[1:32:17] remember what I told you about him in
[1:32:19] hell.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; He opened his eyes."
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me this man ain't seen
[1:32:24] nothing on earth, but he see it in hell.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Open eyes means what? He's enlightened.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; He now wake up and for the first time he
[1:32:33] want prayer. For the first time you want
[1:32:35] to talk to God and for the first time
[1:32:36] you want to talk all of a sudden, Father
[1:32:38] Abraham,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; you didn't know him when he was here.
[1:32:42] Amen.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; And he's so bold. He didn't even say,
[1:32:46] "Can I ask a question?" He said, "Send."
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Boy, your days of having control is
[1:32:51] over.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; You ain't telling nobody to send
[1:32:54] nothing.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; The time for you to cast the devil out
[1:32:58] is here.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Not over there.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; We have the We have the word and we have
[1:33:04] to use the word to deal with these
[1:33:06] things.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; But if we make the devil accommodating
[1:33:08] and we make him comfortable, you know
[1:33:10] what happened?
[1:33:15] in most ears than we think.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; The noise in the fish market is not
[1:33:22] sailor official.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; So we need to check myself. Now as I
[1:33:28] said you don't have to listen to me but
[1:33:29] later on you'll see it because this is
[1:33:31] what came to me after spending the day
[1:33:34] going through re waking up sleep waking
[1:33:37] up and on stressing going through all
[1:33:39] these things. Lord, what am I going to
[1:33:41] do
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; that life? Okay, so let me continue. Do
[1:33:48] you realize unbelief robs a person from
[1:33:50] spiritual power?
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Do you realize rob the church from the
[1:33:54] power?
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; The apostolic power.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Hello. Don't you agree?
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Don't you agree that we should have been
[1:34:02] fured of where we are?
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; If you not agree, something wrong with
[1:34:05] you.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:09] And what you think is the reason
[1:34:12] unbelief and people don't want to say
[1:34:14] that listen brother Brennham have a
[1:34:15] message if God is with us where all the
[1:34:18] miracles you know how much views he have
[1:34:20] 666
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; other messages have 20,000
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; who will not challenge that
[1:34:29] who's willing to go down in the on the
[1:34:31] grind and say God something wrong
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; God what happening here
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; you mean to tell me you just keep
[1:34:37] walking along moving along and you the
[1:34:40] word saying certain things you ain't
[1:34:41] seen it and it don't have you worried
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; I rather be done
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; and worry
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; and go to God and ask him for something
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; nobody want that hard work who going and
[1:34:56] spend time listen you living here so
[1:34:58] fast and so busy I just wonder how you
[1:35:00] making it
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; because to go anywhere is not just jump
[1:35:04] and driving in Grenada we reach and we
[1:35:06] reach we go in the car you reach
[1:35:08] Yeah, he had to drive by
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; and brother take me down in Arizona. I
[1:35:13] kind of g that drive so long and you say
[1:35:15] m what's wrong with you? You're too long
[1:35:18] because to go from here today and where
[1:35:20] you getting time to pray where you
[1:35:21] getting time to deal with them demons
[1:35:23] that's chasing you. The prophet said
[1:35:25] when a devil is cast out from a person,
[1:35:27] he's right behind here.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Right here
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; waiting to what?
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Come back.
[1:35:35] What you think this is?
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; He tracking you
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; day all the place because Dy house you
[1:35:45] want it back. Although
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; vagrants now chasing people going in
[1:35:51] people house and taking it over.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Same thing the devil doing.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; As long as they seeing life in the house
[1:35:58] they're going in.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Where is the life in me? Where is the
[1:36:01] life in you? to prove that there is
[1:36:04] something dynamic in there.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; This is not no joking message. This is a
[1:36:12] message with power. The pillar of fire,
[1:36:14] the angel of the Lord.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; This is what I came to. I left down
[1:36:21] there to come up here, not to sit down
[1:36:24] there.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; And I will go before God. Yeah. and
[1:36:29] keeps me alone. I will go before God and
[1:36:30] ask God what what are we doing wrong?
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Where are we?
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Most churches closed down now. They want
[1:36:40] to pay people registration
[1:36:43] and say that the mark of the beast the
[1:36:44] mark of the beast the mark of
[1:36:45] non-payment.
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:53] You find any B see any BCI
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; ain't prepar
[1:36:59] nonsense. They're robbing God. They're
[1:37:00] robbing the government. They're robbing
[1:37:01] everybody.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; I don't I am business.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; So let me continue. So do you realize
[1:37:13] unbelief robs a person from spiritual
[1:37:14] power?
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Faith restores this power. Jesus said
[1:37:19] when I come when you think is that when
[1:37:22] I come shall I what find
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; God who knows everything asking that
[1:37:29] question we should ask yourself what do
[1:37:31] you mean by that
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; God
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; who knows all things
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; trying to give us a little signal
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; faith will be scant
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; and faith is word
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; because faith come by hearing the word.
[1:37:48] It means people will no longer be
[1:37:50] listening to the word
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; or hearing the word. They'll listen but
[1:37:53] not hear.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; So a person could sit here and hear 20
[1:37:56] message and then do not even 20 things.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; So what you have more of the same
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; and then is much I much do about
[1:38:08] nothing.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; I ain't going I ain't going. You going
[1:38:13] to take your debts off.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; You will be you leave this, you leave
[1:38:16] that. You come here, you're looking for
[1:38:18] God, and you notices something wrong,
[1:38:19] and you sit down there
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; sleeping.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Now, I can't tell you what to do, but I
[1:38:27] know I will do
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; or make noise.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going call. And he said, "When you
[1:38:32] call, I'll answer."
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; It's true. We are lambs, but not to die
[1:38:42] like that.
[1:38:45] Lamb supposed to hear the shepherd voice
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; and the shepherd voice supposed to give
[1:38:49] them strength
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; and supposed to give them taking care of
[1:38:52] them. If they have a break, he come and
[1:38:53] he touch it
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; and they jump again.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Some of us can't even walk.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; I'm here to challenge you.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not a nice brother. I'm a Christian.
[1:39:08] Amen.
[1:39:10] So a lot of preachers preach for people
[1:39:12] to hey
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; and when they done hey tell me why you
[1:39:15] preach a word
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; um
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; kind of hungry now you know after
[1:39:20] sitting there so long wait until he come
[1:39:23] back
[1:39:27] where's the conviction
[1:39:29] cuz the word brings conviction
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit brings conviction
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; when you let go the Holy Spirit you know
[1:39:36] he go fight
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; do you know the lamb Sorry. The dove
[1:39:40] flies at the slightest provocation.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; You could walk down there with the dove
[1:39:44] and the wrong behavior.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Make that dove gone.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Dove gone and you ain't even know.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; No more cooling.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Let me finish.
[1:40:03] He grew up among them. So he says
[1:40:06] because here what he says he brings God
[1:40:08] yet could he could not do any miraculous
[1:40:11] works because the people he grew up with
[1:40:13] and and were with his harshest critics
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; they did not believe why they were
[1:40:19] afraid of him. And let me tell you
[1:40:20] something that the Lord revealed to me.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; You know one of the reason why they
[1:40:23] afraid Jesus because when he was small
[1:40:25] he said disappear in rooms.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; He's not disappearing when the Pharisees
[1:40:31] looking for him. Long he doing that.
[1:40:34] So they worried what kind of child is
[1:40:36] that
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; they'll be talking bad about him and
[1:40:40] they say come and see and when they
[1:40:41] going in there
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; he knowing them you know God never tell
[1:40:46] us all the things that happened from
[1:40:48] from the time he born to 30
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; you have a reason
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; but I know because he's God and he's
[1:40:55] always God and he's the same yesterday
[1:40:57] and he start doing the thing young
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; he knew he had the
[1:41:03] Here's his parents soal.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; You go three days. Have you ever been in
[1:41:09] your house? You have a 12-y old child
[1:41:11] and you in the room and you worried.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; First night, nothing. You ain't even
[1:41:17] checked
[1:41:19] and you all went on a far country and
[1:41:21] you're going back home.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; You didn't check. I wonder how much Mary
[1:41:26] and Joseph have.
[1:41:29] Mary didn't even Mary is the one that
[1:41:31] made the confession that the angel of
[1:41:34] God spoke to her and she believed and
[1:41:36] she said be it unto me. Then after it
[1:41:39] became a reality
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; after you came in the message
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; now you're having issues
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; and he was always correcting her don't
[1:41:48] you know your father and I hold on
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; your what? and dies without disrespect.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Dies without disrespect because God
[1:41:57] still can't break the word to fulfill
[1:41:58] it.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; And he said the scriptures cannot be
[1:42:01] broken.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Don't you know what be
[1:42:04] about my what? Father's business."
[1:42:06] Telling her careful.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; He's not my daddy.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; And the Bible didn't say that he steps
[1:42:13] on
[1:42:16] a
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; you didn't know about that.
[1:42:21] Jesus. Jesus didn't have no stepfather.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Are you What's wrong with all?
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; He didn't have no stepfather. But he was
[1:42:33] there and his brothers didn't like him.
[1:42:35] His sisters didn't like him because
[1:42:36] there was something about this boy, this
[1:42:40] young man that they could not stomach.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; They had unbelief in them.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; He had faith in him. and faith and
[1:42:51] unbelief could never agree.
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; You would always have a problem with
[1:42:56] people with faith.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Your unbelief in you would make you feel
[1:43:01] bad.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; You didn't even want to be around them.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; So Jesus had to deal with that. He was
[1:43:07] just like David. David had problems with
[1:43:09] the brothers and sisters. Why? He always
[1:43:10] singing a psalm. Them nos to sing.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Them never fac no lion. The never face
[1:43:15] no bear. You could imagine David
[1:43:17] brothers facing a lion gone.
[1:43:20] He done that for himself. He father put
[1:43:22] him outside. Why? Because when he was
[1:43:24] born, they thought that is not his.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; What they did with Jesus? They thought
[1:43:30] that was not his.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; That right Jesus and David could
[1:43:35] connect.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; They had issues growing up.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; You want to tell me that your younger
[1:43:40] son and you there in the in the bush and
[1:43:42] all them big boy and them in the house.
[1:43:43] The biggest supposed to be out there.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; You go and take care of the sheep.
[1:43:49] Little brother home. Thy father sent
[1:43:52] David.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; And there is David making 150 psalms.
[1:43:57] How much make
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; not song psalms. You know where it come
[1:44:02] from?
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; His experience.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; His connection with God.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; That man had faith.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; What is your experience?
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Where is your faith?
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; No faith, no experience.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; And if you have an experience, then how
[1:44:16] you going to believe?
[1:44:18] That's why it's difficult
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; until you see God move. It's going to be
[1:44:22] difficult for you to touch God.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; So we have a problem.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Why am I able to speak like that?
[1:44:34] Because I experienced a move of faith in
[1:44:36] my life.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; And until you experience one, you can't
[1:44:39] talk about it. You'll be afraid.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Supposed in what? Suppose something
[1:44:43] happens. Supposedly, suppose that
[1:44:46] [Music]
[1:44:49] sit up.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; That is like old time where we go to
[1:44:54] church and everybody have testimony and
[1:44:55] what is the testimony? You know, I have
[1:44:57] a testimony. I was passing so and I had
[1:44:59] food on the on the pot and it was I was
[1:45:01] cooking oil down. Hey,
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; they used to drop that on us on church
[1:45:07] that was there blanket. No more
[1:45:09] testimony. Nobody standing up inside
[1:45:10] there and do what they want.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; It was not a testimony. Amen.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz we had to talk about what we know.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; We talking about God.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; What is your connection with the
[1:45:26] supernatural?
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; How long you serving God? 20 years. And
[1:45:31] you want to tell me you have never had a
[1:45:32] supernatural experience in the 20 years?
[1:45:34] Who you been meeting? Who you been
[1:45:35] talking to? Who you been hearing from?
[1:45:37] Oh God, wake up.
[1:45:48] You dealing with a supernatural God and
[1:45:50] he can't give one supernatural sign.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; You can't even stop cussing.
[1:45:55] [Music]
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; And they tell me slip
[1:46:00] crouch slip.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Now you're probably changing your mind
[1:46:15] about me now.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; But remember it not means the word
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; and the word is what? Dig in into your
[1:46:21] what?
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Unbelief. If it have
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; and that's why it it becomes a place
[1:46:29] where uh I agree with that. I agree that
[1:46:33] I don't agree that I don't agree that.
[1:46:35] But it's the life.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; If you're not alive, you can agree.
[1:46:39] Jesus was not agreed by everybody
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; even among his own. He said he could not
[1:46:44] do any miracles there because of what
[1:46:47] their unbelief where Nazareth he born.
[1:46:49] Nazareth he wanted to do the work and
[1:46:51] Nazareth said no.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Where should the works be done? In the
[1:46:57] message
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; the prophet showed us. The prophet told
[1:47:02] us we heard about it. I want to see it.
[1:47:06] Amen.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; I can live alone on what he said. That
[1:47:09] gives me faith. But where's mine?
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Where's mine?
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; I want mine.
[1:47:16] [Applause]
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Burnham and them had needs.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; So I don't have
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; them want to live. I don't want to live.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Sickness come because of sin. I don't
[1:47:31] want it to go.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You mean you believe in doctor so
[1:47:36] much
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; and when he done what you do go to God
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; that why the the king he tell him you
[1:47:43] coming home from the bed you know
[1:47:45] because you should have first check God
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; and then let God tell you what to do but
[1:47:50] you went and check the ob man so you go
[1:47:52] dead on that bed
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; if offensive Um, forgive me.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. He displayed strange and
[1:48:11] wonderful attributes that they could not
[1:48:12] deal with because it was what? Foreign
[1:48:14] to them. And that's where the problem
[1:48:16] is. Anything you seen that is foreign to
[1:48:18] you, you can't handle it. And the
[1:48:20] disciples just like us when they see a
[1:48:23] ghost. Everything is there's a ghost.
[1:48:24] Oh, God. And they're afraid.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Men chosen by God.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Afraid to go into the night. Amen.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus walk in a water
[1:48:39] it
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; because he was a praying. You notice
[1:48:42] they were never praying with him.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Their eyes always heavy
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; like some of you do when you zoom
[1:48:51] and the brother think you're listening
[1:48:53] and you're in Zoom land
[1:48:55] [Music]
[1:48:58] and you even have the bed say brother I
[1:49:00] sleep here. are knocking off
[1:49:03] and he talking to phone
[1:49:09] all you have real belly
[1:49:13] and nobody making confession you know
[1:49:16] brother the other night when you're
[1:49:17] speaking I drop asleep please forgive me
[1:49:20] for the disrespect
[1:49:24] let me tell you when when wrong become
[1:49:26] normal
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; normal is wrong
[1:49:36] I'm coming down.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; All right. Where am I? So, one of Jesus.
[1:49:43] Okay. So, I was talking about him
[1:49:44] walking on water.
[1:49:47] He was always about his father's
[1:49:48] business. What about us today? I come
[1:49:51] visiting you this morning and I ask you
[1:49:53] to present him. Is he with you? Okay. So
[1:49:56] you are talking about him walking on
[1:49:57] water and here he is walking on water
[1:49:59] and who who in the boat see him? Peter.
[1:50:01] Peter is like us in the message who
[1:50:02] trying best but we still need faith.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; We still need that that anointing from
[1:50:08] God but we there we jam it. We ain't
[1:50:10] giving up.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; We will not rest
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; until
[1:50:18] he touch me.
[1:50:19] [Applause]
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; That should be your attitude. Don't come
[1:50:24] and say well that's so is boring and if
[1:50:27] everything is one of the same hello
[1:50:28] ain't you still the same
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; you could be the same but the service
[1:50:32] can't be the same
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; hello I ain't saying the service is the
[1:50:37] same but it's what you look for
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; and it's your mind
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; that's why it has come late
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; you should be here early
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; to talk to God before he comes
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; but we come any old time God could wait
[1:50:51] on me
[1:50:54] Sorry if you're hurting you.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; You know what caused that? When we just
[1:51:01] get get saved in the message, we reach
[1:51:03] him before the song leader.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Now the song leader had to call us. You
[1:51:08] come in.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; We We need help.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; We definitely need help.
[1:51:22] Amen.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; So let me finish with that. Um Jesus on
[1:51:26] the water. Here he is coming and Peter
[1:51:29] see me say Lord because at first the
[1:51:31] door was a ghost. Imagine them men
[1:51:33] talking ghost and you know what ghost
[1:51:35] that jump behind
[1:51:40] believers.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; The whole thing in them still
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; all true. You see them men and I'm
[1:51:48] afraid Jesus appear. Hey. Oh Lord, he
[1:51:51] come through the room.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Peter outside knocking. They're praying
[1:51:57] for me. They in jail. The guy run back.
[1:52:00] I jump in in the door. I go in the door,
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Christians.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Believers,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; this is no joke.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; This thing deadly. It started in Eden.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Listen, this thing is not easy and the
[1:52:22] churches don't realize numbers don't
[1:52:25] mean Holy Ghost.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; In fact, where the Holy Ghost is people
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; because where the Holy Ghost is, you
[1:52:33] have what? Judgment.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Why you just have also you can't play
[1:52:37] around and an Sarah could not play
[1:52:39] around. God killed them. Not Peter.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; And everybody free to bring that that
[1:52:44] apostolic time today.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Why we want to play? We come out to
[1:52:49] play. We want to dally. We want to do it
[1:52:51] how we want.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; You can't tell me what to do. You're not
[1:52:57] my father.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; As a big man,
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; I'm king.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; I thought you surrendered your life to
[1:53:10] God
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; and you say, "Lord, you be my master
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; and you be my Lord." You know what Lord
[1:53:15] mean? Amen.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; You know Lord,
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; absolute and complete ruler. You know,
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; you have no say anymore. You know,
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; you have given up your rights to him.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; If he say bend, bend. If you say run,
[1:53:30] run. If he say stop, stop.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; That's why the the prophet quotes, we
[1:53:36] only do what the word says or we keep.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:53:44] He said keep still. He then said dead.
[1:53:47] [Music]

[1:55:09] and die.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; God promised you certain things.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; And you're not saying, "Brother,
[1:55:15] brother, hold on. Hold on. We We were
[1:55:17] supposed to promise this. We ain't seen

[1:55:35] Get up.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Me ain't changing. You a change.

[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Go and check.

[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; had sin.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; So don't blame and say well them brother
[1:55:53] this and you part

[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; You have a role to play.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Brother say all of you have a post.
[1:56:03] Hello. Some of us have we post but we
[1:56:04] hitting it worse than how we walking
[1:56:06] outside.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; You have a post of duty
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; to be here.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; And if you have a walk that keeping you
[1:56:16] from your post, fire the work.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; God will give a work because not all the
[1:56:21] time God has give us. Let me tell you
[1:56:23] something less is more
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; because the devil does give job too. And
[1:56:27] his job is to make sure you die being
[1:56:30] rich.
[1:56:37] You think I will take a job that I can
[1:56:39] serve my God?
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; I vom that job
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; bounce. Hey, later
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; my God will supply.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; I let the devil show up on me.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; But we want the highest job with the
[1:56:55] highest pay for the less work.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; And then you have to make the sacrifice.
[1:57:02] Every day you're walking like a dog.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; And then when you die, you bury like a
[1:57:07] pig.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; You ain't even coming to your funeral.
[1:57:10] Who you walking with?
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; You're on your own.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; That make sense?
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Let me continue.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; I find all you quiet. What happened? I'm
[1:57:24] doing something wrong.
[1:57:33] Oh, I was talking about the um walking
[1:57:35] on the water and he said if it's you
[1:57:36] come and Jesus said come now watch this
[1:57:39] Peter who ain't have the Holy Ghost yet
[1:57:42] but have faith to do what Jesus said
[1:57:45] began to walk
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; so don't say but I ain't have the Holy
[1:57:47] Ghost yet listen where's your faith
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; faith come for salvation
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; if you say if you have faith
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; all you have to do is build
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; but you can't build if you have unbelief
[1:58:00] cuz unbelief would be like a vine
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; that wrap around the good tree. I have
[1:58:05] some land, you know, farm land in
[1:58:07] Grenada and and I even come and they
[1:58:10] grow up and not make trees. So I asked
[1:58:12] the government for help. So we went
[1:58:13] there one day my daughter and I and we
[1:58:15] said well you going to clean up and when
[1:58:17] we went we couldn't tell the difference
[1:58:18] between a good tree and vine and then
[1:58:21] the man sat cutting he say you see that
[1:58:23] not make tree but they not make tree
[1:58:25] their own soul
[1:58:27] and what they white vine choke it let me
[1:58:30] tell you you think you bad you should
[1:58:33] see them pride they're wicked they wrap
[1:58:36] it wrong they to passo they pass they
[1:58:38] passo listen somebody doing
[1:58:43] You can't tell me that doing that
[1:58:44] myself.
[1:58:50] The the leaves that get black, no
[1:58:52] sunlight.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; No light, no rain. It just make sure I
[1:58:57] don't take life while I eating life.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; So you think the devil will just let you
[1:59:05] walk away
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; when he come to kill and destroy? You
[1:59:09] think that joke? Everything the devil
[1:59:11] say mean it.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; You need to mean what you say.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; And I watch that thing and I feel sorry
[1:59:22] for the vine. We have to cut, hack, cut,
[1:59:24] hack, dismantle the vine.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; It took a lot. And you had to be careful
[1:59:30] how you cut it out because you cut the
[1:59:31] tree
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; because that scamp over them leaf that
[1:59:35] is important with the nutmeg.
[1:59:40] He knows how to cover you. Take over
[1:59:41] your prayer life. Take over your
[1:59:43] service. Take over this. Take over that.
[1:59:44] Keep your py peasy peasy peasy.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; And the power you have, you have it
[1:59:51] again. You become powerless and a crying
[1:59:53] Christian. Everything is a cry. Oh God.
[1:59:57] Oh God. Not because of the Holy Ghost,
[1:59:58] but because you left the ghost.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; God didn't make you how you are. You do
[2:00:06] that. Amen.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; The God I serve make us victorious. Make
[2:00:11] us powerful.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Make us with conquering power.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; His church is a conquering church.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Not a church of their lazy loss of fear
[2:00:23] with no zeal with no nothing, no
[2:00:25] ambition.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; You know who do that? The same God that
[2:00:29] killed Pentecost come in a message.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; What's Pentecost? It worse than the
[2:00:37] Roman Catholic Church back home.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Didn't even have a symbol of God.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; It bad.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; You might get a virtue from a Roman
[2:00:48] Catholic but not from a Pentecost.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; It bad. What did the prophet say in 50
[2:00:53] years?
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; What?
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; It could be worse.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; That's thus said the Lord. It is worse.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Now you came from Pentecost.
[2:01:05] Ask them to come and see you worship
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; and if they will take anything when they
[2:01:08] go in. What if they go back where they
[2:01:10] was?
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; You think they will be impressed? You
[2:01:17] think they will see a life behind the
[2:01:19] name
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; that makes them hungry
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; that makes them want to gravitate from
[2:01:25] where they are
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; in the darkness.
[2:01:30] One of the worst feeling is in the home
[2:01:32] and current go
[2:01:34] so dread and the darkness so dread just
[2:01:36] sit down
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; can't move
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; cuz to move means accident
[2:01:43] especially if your house have everything
[2:01:45] close
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; those rich ones everything spread out
[2:01:49] kitchen quiet down so
[2:01:51] there doesn't even play ball in it not
[2:01:53] for us poor ones everything you want
[2:01:56] when that current gone you stay and you
[2:01:58] pray.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with Grenlet?
[2:02:02] And Grenlet received the the verbal
[2:02:05] abuse
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; cuz my payment bill
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; and current corn when I'm ready to eat
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; and we give like a mouthful.
[2:02:19] You dying
[2:02:22] spiritually starving.
[2:02:24] You're not as you were
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; and you're not complaining.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; You complaining about light in your
[2:02:33] house
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; that you going to leave one day.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; The real complaint should be here. Come
[2:02:42] let us reason together and said the Lord
[2:02:43] though your skin be as sins be as scal.
[2:02:45] I will make them white as snow. Lord
[2:02:47] what's up with mine?
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; I seen shades of black. I seen shades of
[2:02:50] blue. I want white.
[2:02:56] Are you not concerned?
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; By the time we finish, it's either you
[2:03:02] hate me or you love me or you go check
[2:03:05] yourself.
[2:03:10] [Applause]
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Let me move on.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; So, I'll go. You know where I'm going?
[2:03:21] I'll flip all that. skip all that and
[2:03:23] run to where I want to be.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Gideon, I like that story.
[2:03:31] Gideon the prophet,
[2:03:34] he was approached by the angel of the
[2:03:35] Lord and it's in Judges 6 verse 11.
[2:03:41] Because you know a lot of things. So, I
[2:03:42] just want to just touch the highlights
[2:03:45] because I don't want to spend all the
[2:03:46] time telling you something you already
[2:03:48] know.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; But I want to touch your heart that was
[2:03:51] probably hidden by you.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz you could hide things.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Your conscience could become a snare to
[2:03:57] you.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Because instead of you receiving the
[2:03:59] word and changing, you receive the word
[2:04:01] and hide it.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; And you're not comfortable.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; You're not even happy.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; And you're not even making noise.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there came an angel of the
[2:04:11] Lord and sat under oak which was in Ofra
[2:04:14] that pertained unto Josh the Azerite.
[2:04:16] And the son Gideon thr wheat by the wine
[2:04:18] press to hide it from the Midianites.
[2:04:20] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[2:04:22] him and said to him, "The Lord is with
[2:04:23] thee, thou mighty man of valor."
[2:04:25] Whenever I reach your brother, I read
[2:04:26] your brother. Isaac said, "Thou mighty
[2:04:28] one of me."
[2:04:31] And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord,
[2:04:33] if the Lord be with us, why then is all
[2:04:36] this befallening us? And where be all
[2:04:38] his miracles which our fathers told us?
[2:04:40] Saying, did not the Lord bring us out
[2:04:42] from Egypt? But now the Lord has
[2:04:44] forsaken us and delivered us into the
[2:04:46] hands of the Midionites. And the Lord
[2:04:48] look upon him. Didn't our angel God now?
[2:04:51] And he said, "Go in thy might, and thou
[2:04:53] shalt save Israel from the hand of the
[2:04:54] Midianites. Have I not sent thee?"
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Did he not raise us up?
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; You don't have no questions. Hallelujah.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Have I not sent thee? And he said unto
[2:05:09] him, "Oh my Lord, where shall I save
[2:05:10] Israel? Behold, my family is poor in
[2:05:12] Manasseh, and I'm the least in my
[2:05:14] father's house." And the Lord said unto
[2:05:15] him, "Surely I will be with thee, and
[2:05:17] thou shalt smite the Medidionites as one
[2:05:20] man." You hear that? As one man. Now,
[2:05:22] one of the things you have to understand
[2:05:23] is every word God say is important.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't say go smite the as army as
[2:05:28] one man.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; One man.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you see it? And when the
[2:05:35] church comes into a unity, they're not
[2:05:39] moving like a a set of people, you know.
[2:05:41] They move like one.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Everybody saying the same thing.
[2:05:44] Everybody had the same desire. Everybody
[2:05:46] moving in the same direction. And they
[2:05:48] had all things
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; and they had all things.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; They were not commoners. They had all
[2:05:57] things in common.
[2:05:59] So where you going this D mine I want
[2:06:01] nobody touch it and look you take the
[2:06:03] bus my car clean I don't want nobody
[2:06:06] driving it
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; and don't come in my house um stay
[2:06:11] outside in the ver here's two sandwich
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; you know them nonsense going on
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; for real because we have grades why that
[2:06:20] brother there he ordinary he he d a not
[2:06:23] he have a car so let's stay outside
[2:06:26] another one coming oh here is Isaac
[2:06:28] Isaac Come in. Come in. I sit down. You
[2:06:30] can even sit down over here. This is my
[2:06:32] soft chair.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Isaac don't know what you're doing, but
[2:06:39] he appreciate what you're doing.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; But God,
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; God upset with you
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; because what you are doing is a
[2:06:48] preference
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; from unbelief.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Unbelief.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; They had all things in common. And
[2:06:56] that's what we supposed to have here.
[2:06:58] All of us should be saying brother
[2:06:59] brother Oid we we be we concerned
[2:07:04] be concerned. I was speaking to a fellow
[2:07:07] in the message while we were w um
[2:07:09] witnessing and they don't take communion
[2:07:10] and they don't do fit worship. So me and
[2:07:12] another pastor we jam him and we start
[2:07:16] to feed him the word. Feed him the word
[2:07:17] and he tried to block. Let me tell you
[2:07:19] he has some desperate people outside.
[2:07:21] They hearing the word and they're trying
[2:07:22] to dodge it. Eventually say okay
[2:07:26] feet washing. Jesus say if you're in
[2:07:28] wash you have no part
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; and communion these are sacred things
[2:07:32] that we we have not to stop
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; so he decide he going to deal with it
[2:07:37] how
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; you know he had to face
[2:07:43] it's not something you could just go and
[2:07:45] change
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; when the people become as one man
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; then it's different
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; but when this pulling so that pulling so
[2:07:52] that pulling so you ain't making no
[2:07:54] change you have strife
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; what is the reason why the message
[2:07:58] churches are unable to produce the works
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; that should have been there long
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; and we keep waiting. We can't wait until
[2:08:05] we dead.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; I want mine now.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; I can be preaching up with God and
[2:08:13] talking about the miracles and I and
[2:08:14] they say when you see it uh
[2:08:18] and just walk away. Amen.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; This God we serving supposed to deal
[2:08:24] with your needs.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you desire.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; I have a lot of whatsoever.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; How much you have? You know what we have
[2:08:34] done? We throw it away. Well, it look we
[2:08:36] have that again. So, forget that. Let me
[2:08:38] fight up with what I have. Let me try
[2:08:40] and eat healthy and and by God's grace,
[2:08:42] I will see what could do. like the
[2:08:44] church where you reach.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Here what the prophet said.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; He said if God is with us, where is the
[2:08:55] miracles that the prophet told us about?
[2:08:58] Because he knowed everywhere God went,
[2:09:00] miracles followed him.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Wherever God would be, miracles would be
[2:09:05] there.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; And how can you expect God today to walk
[2:09:08] and amongst the people who doesn't
[2:09:10] believe
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; in miracles? This you need to check.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Do you know some of us really believe in
[2:09:17] God but the miracle part?
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; We cannot directly say yes.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; We could believe miracles for that
[2:09:29] brother or that sister cuz it's not me.
[2:09:32] But when it comes from me,
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; you going Miami.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; I didn't even know that the Lord just
[2:09:41] dropped that in Miami.
[2:09:43] and see some Dr. Harry
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Haiti
[2:09:51] [Laughter]
[2:09:54] that one is a stretch.
[2:09:57] So he said would how can you expect God
[2:10:01] today to walk amongst the people who
[2:10:03] doesn't believe in miracles? How can it
[2:10:05] be? Gideon again said may my Lord if God
[2:10:08] be with us then why is all this trouble
[2:10:10] upon us
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; and where is the miracles that we were
[2:10:13] told about
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; where is the things that God used to do
[2:10:16] among us now remember we are going
[2:10:18] there's a reason for the for the cutting
[2:10:20] down of miracles or for the cutting off
[2:10:22] of miracles there's a reason why Jesus
[2:10:25] could not do miracles why
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; don't blame the pastor he trying
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; but if he believe and you don't believe
[2:10:33] nothing happening
[2:10:36] He could have all the faith to raise the
[2:10:40] roof
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; and you ain't believe.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet says you make the
[2:10:46] gift work.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Your faith pull the angel.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Your faith bring the power of God.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Come down.
[2:11:03] So he said, "Lord, if God with us, why
[2:11:05] is all this trouble upon us? Where is
[2:11:07] the miracles that we were told about?
[2:11:09] Where is the things that God used to
[2:11:10] do?"
[2:11:12] There is a good way to trust whether the
[2:11:15] messenger is right or wrong. If he has a
[2:11:17] form of godliness, he will deny that
[2:11:19] power to do those miracles. If he's a
[2:11:21] messenger from God, he will not only
[2:11:22] speak of it, but he will have it.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; To produce it and to show that God that
[2:11:28] he talks about is with him and in him.
[2:11:31] Gideon was spiritual or scriptural in
[2:11:33] his response to the Lord. And if we
[2:11:35] understand that God is a great God of
[2:11:37] mighty works and he's a great God of
[2:11:39] miracles and if he's for us and if he's
[2:11:42] with us and he's the same yesterday,
[2:11:43] today and forever, where can I see his
[2:11:46] miracles? Where
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; can I see this God in action?
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Where is he at? Coming down in my last
[2:11:53] bit. If he's for us the mighty man of
[2:11:56] valor, he said he could refer back to
[2:11:58] the old time.
[2:12:00] I heard of it
[2:12:02] and I know it's right because he know
[2:12:04] that God is a supernatural being and
[2:12:06] wherever a supernatural being is, he
[2:12:08] will do supernatural signs.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Because the supernatural is in him,
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; you just can't get out of it. How can
[2:12:15] you stand the face the face of wind? How
[2:12:19] can you stand in the face of wind
[2:12:21] without the wind blowing? How can you
[2:12:23] get in the water without getting wet?
[2:12:26] Water is wet and that's the chemical of
[2:12:28] it. When you set in water, you are going
[2:12:30] to get wet. And when you're in the
[2:12:32] presence of God, the supernatural,
[2:12:34] there's going to be supernatural signs,
[2:12:37] supernatural workings of a supernatural
[2:12:39] God. That's why it's a legitimate
[2:12:41] question. He asks, "Where are the
[2:12:43] miracles?"
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Where are the signs of his being with us
[2:12:47] and in us?
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Where God says, where God is, miracles
[2:12:51] are.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; God is a sign he's there. Gideon may be
[2:12:55] taught, I am a man maybe of 50 years old
[2:12:57] and I heard them talk about a God that
[2:12:59] work miracles and I went to church and I
[2:13:02] have believed the priests. I believe the
[2:13:03] prophets. I believe the written word all
[2:13:05] the scrolls and I read in the scrolls
[2:13:07] where God when he comes among his people
[2:13:09] something takes place.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Gideon had a legitimate question. If
[2:13:13] there is a God and he's with us then let
[2:13:15] me see his signs.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; He does because he let me see the signs
[2:13:21] that he does perform. Then if this great
[2:13:23] tax last before me, this question could
[2:13:26] be easily said this morning amongst our
[2:13:28] churches. Where is that God
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; that once lived? Did he die?
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Is he gone pursuing? Is he on a trip? No
[2:13:37] sir. Then if we say we are of God, then
[2:13:39] let's see where God is.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; If this tabernacle stands for God, let's
[2:13:43] see God moving among us.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Let's see souls being born in the
[2:13:47] kingdom.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Let's see lives being straightened up.
[2:13:50] Let's see the sick, the blind, the deaf
[2:13:53] healed. Let's see his mighty works being
[2:13:56] performed. We must ask the question, if
[2:13:58] God is with his people and in his
[2:14:00] people, that person cannot help but do
[2:14:02] the things
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; the same thing that God did.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; You can't help it.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; God is in the man. If that man sin, then
[2:14:12] God is not in him.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; If he loves the world, then God is not
[2:14:15] there. And we know that God has no
[2:14:17] dealings with sin. Jesus asked the
[2:14:19] question. Jesus was asked a question. He
[2:14:21] said, "You being a man, make yourself
[2:14:23] God." When he had healed the man with
[2:14:25] the policy, he said, "Thy sins be
[2:14:27] forgiven thee." Now wait a minute. You
[2:14:29] being a man forgive sins. He said that
[2:14:31] you might know that the son of man had
[2:14:32] power on earth to forgive sins or to
[2:14:35] heal. Whichever is easier to say, take
[2:14:37] up thy bed and walk or say, "Thy sins be
[2:14:39] forgiven thee." And the man got up and
[2:14:42] walked away.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees questioned Jesus.
[2:14:46] If you don't believe me, he said, then
[2:14:48] believe the signs.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; If I do that I do for the signs follow
[2:14:52] the word.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; the word we preach.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; The signs must follow it.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; If you don't see the signs, then we got
[2:15:01] to check.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Is it me? Is it you? Where is the
[2:15:05] problem? God in dead. He's the same
[2:15:07] yesterday. Hebrews touching it. I am
[2:15:09] here to challenge you.
[2:15:13] And don't tell me God doing it. God will
[2:15:16] do it
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; is if we want it
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; and God will wait until all of us in
[2:15:22] trouble
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; and all of us cry
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; and then he will come but it might be
[2:15:28] late.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; You don't want to wait until you're in
[2:15:32] trouble. Take in front.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; Take in front regardless of what other
[2:15:35] churches do. Who is willing to go down
[2:15:37] before God and say, "Father, here is the
[2:15:39] word. Here's the word. Brother Tim,
[2:15:41] preach and where are the signs in my
[2:15:42] life?
[2:15:43] the signs in my soul.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; I'm hungry. I'm starving. I am wretched.
[2:15:49] I didn't used to be like that. I g the
[2:15:51] message long ago. But now I'm cold. I'm
[2:15:54] feeling sick. I'm spiritually vampish.
[2:15:58] I need deliverance.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; I'm not telling you come and get saved.
[2:16:04] I'm telling you come and connect to God.
[2:16:05] Come and touch God. Come and be touched
[2:16:07] by God.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; We need to go higher.
[2:16:11] The prophet said what we have cannot do
[2:16:13] it. We have to lift ourselves. The
[2:16:15] church wants to lift. How you going to
[2:16:16] lift by the word?
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to be willing to preach it.
[2:16:21] Somebody had to be willing to believe
[2:16:22] it. Somebody had to be willing to lead.
[2:16:26] But I don't care. Nobody coming. I'm
[2:16:28] going. Lord.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; He tired. Call me. Now let me call him.
[2:16:39] Amen.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; I don't need
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; the end is upon us. The other day they
[2:16:46] say the the rapture is the 23rd. Now the
[2:16:48] fellow making apologies. You know the
[2:16:50] other people saying he know that again.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Coming events what? Cast forth what?
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Their shadows.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; You know that quote only stop read
[2:17:01] books.
[2:17:03] Coming events cast forth their shadows.
[2:17:05] So if you see a man saying that is the
[2:17:07] rapture watch because when people stop
[2:17:10] look
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; suddenly
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; he shows he says in the last days like a
[2:17:16] snare
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; pride of life
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; lust of the eye
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; lust of the flesh
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; and the Bible said it will come upon
[2:17:25] who? Every single man
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; woman and child.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Why you going to do it on Bible? Why you
[2:17:32] going do it on what? Got it. You better
[2:17:34] wake up. Every word must be fulfilled.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; And God wouldn't send this prophet with
[2:17:42] a message like that for us to watch it,
[2:17:44] listen to it, and say, "Well, that's not
[2:17:46] for us."
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; He expect better than that.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; It's time for us to reach a place.
[2:17:53] Listen, you're never going to go high
[2:17:55] unless you hit bottom.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz when you're going down, you ain't
[2:17:58] looking up.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Now we at the bottom. It's time for us
[2:18:03] to go up.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; I want to see God. I want to see some
[2:18:06] miracles in me.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Even as I'm speaking over confessing it,
[2:18:10] I want I have a miracle I need.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; I have some children that ain't safe
[2:18:14] yet. Am I going to let them go in hell?
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; When he said the faith you had to save
[2:18:20] yourself could bring them.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Well then, Lord, increase my faith.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; I ain't got one, I got two. I ain't got
[2:18:28] two, I got three. I ain't got three, I
[2:18:29] got four, I got five. Then I need fight.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; You stay and let your family die and go
[2:18:38] to hell. You think hell nice.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; You know why it is to leave your loss.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; I can preach this in Pentecost. I can
[2:18:47] preach this in Rome. The only place you
[2:18:49] can preach it is in the B.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; But the bride must know who she is.
[2:18:55] This is the time for action.
[2:18:59] Don't leave it for tomorrow now.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Now.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; You want to see the works of God, then
[2:19:08] you have to have the word of God.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Then you have to believe in him.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; God is not going to send a mighty
[2:19:15] rushing wind upon you and you even have
[2:19:17] nothing for the wind.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; We want to do a lot of mighty things and
[2:19:21] we can't even do simple things.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; Just to believe is a problem. Is God
[2:19:26] going to give you his power and you even
[2:19:29] have faith to have control?
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; You want to bring down fire on people.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; You're not going to do that.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; And this is the hour for us to have a
[2:19:42] manifestation.
[2:19:44] Message has been going on for years.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; This is manifestation time. This is not
[2:19:48] no time for us to bring new message, new
[2:19:50] revelation and new gifts,
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; new done.
[2:19:54] This is a time for all the word that
[2:19:56] been swed
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; to show itself.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; And if you have received the word, then
[2:20:01] I got to see your faith. God must see
[2:20:04] your faith.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; And we got to get the devil on the run.
[2:20:10] God moved Gideon army from 32,000 men to
[2:20:15] 22,000 left.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; Them men answer the call. These
[2:20:20] preachers answer the call. And God tell
[2:20:23] him is unbelievers. Let it go back home.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; 32,000 become what? 10.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; And God still didn't finish.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; Wake up.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Don't wait for people to come.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; You are to be the champion. You are to
[2:20:41] be the the demonst. The demo. You are
[2:20:44] the pilot.
[2:20:47] You have it on the air. Everybody
[2:20:49] watching you. There's a reason for that.
[2:20:50] I told brother this years ago. You have
[2:20:53] the battle in your hand.
[2:20:56] It begins somewhere. I am not here for
[2:20:59] chance.
[2:21:03] It has to start somewhere. And God wants
[2:21:06] you and you and you
[2:21:10] call to action. Call to the
[2:21:12] resurrection. Call to the dynamics. It's
[2:21:15] time.
[2:21:16] [Applause]
[2:21:18] And when my people which are called by
[2:21:20] my name
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; shall humble themselves
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; and get rid all the pride
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; and get rid all the vain glory.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to get no name. I don't
[2:21:30] care what you say about me, but I care
[2:21:31] what you say about your Lord and where
[2:21:34] you go.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; I have no axe to grind. I don't want to
[2:21:43] be a celebrity. I don't tell God. You
[2:21:45] know why God can't trust us?
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; Soon as I let a miracle gone, we gone
[2:21:49] with the miracle of God. Hey, I can
[2:21:50] heal. You know why? You know, God, okay.
[2:21:54] And you want six men in front of you and
[2:21:55] six men behind you and a limousine.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Why? Because somebody who was blind,
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; they say
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; can now see.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; So you going in another place. God can't
[2:22:09] trust nobody. Amen.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; So, he's looking for a few
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; good men
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; and women
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; that he could trust
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; and that will put him first
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; and will put him at the forefront.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; So, we know it's not me. We know it's
[2:22:25] not you.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; It is him.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; I love Jesus.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; When I watch how we move in the earth
[2:22:32] and the things he say, oh God, I love
[2:22:34] that man.
[2:22:37] Every word was measured. Every word was
[2:22:39] complete. Every word was powerful. Every
[2:22:42] action was deliverance. That man was a
[2:22:46] man from heaven.
[2:22:48] I emulate him. I want to be like him. I
[2:22:51] love that man.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; He gave up everything for me. I love him
[2:22:58] alone. I don't want nobody else with
[2:23:00] him. I love him alone. What a man.
[2:23:05] [Music]
[2:23:08] Jesus,
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; I want him here.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; I need him.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; Oh God, Trinidad,
[2:23:18] [Music]
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; are you going to go home the way you
[2:23:21] came?
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; Are you going to find yourself here and
[2:23:24] said, "Oh God, I'm not leaving. I'm not
[2:23:27] leaving
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; until I connect.
[2:23:33] Until I connect. If God be with us, we
[2:23:37] are the miracles. Lord, the miracle
[2:23:38] begins in me.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; Change me, mold me, circumcise me. Oh
[2:23:44] God, dismantle me.
[2:23:58] Then something has to happen.
[2:24:01] Come out in your station. Come out in
[2:24:03] your selfishness. Come in now old sh
[2:24:08] get right with God. Fix the unbroken.
[2:24:11] Fix the broken line.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; I feel like stopping now.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; You're leaving here today.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Are you going to this be the same?
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Are you going to let this word be your
[2:24:27] judgment?
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; Are you going to let this word be your
[2:24:30] praise? Amen.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Are you not going to stop them nonsense?
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; And get right with God.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, God is always holy.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; God never changes.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; He is always holy. And he says, "Be a
[2:24:43] holy
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; as I am holy."
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; How you can be holy with that kind of
[2:24:48] strippingness?
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; How you can be holy and that kind of
[2:24:51] behavior man strip it, dismantle it,
[2:24:54] mash it up. I call for his destruction.
[2:24:59] Who will go with me?
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; Who will go with me?
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand.
[2:25:12] [Music]
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Remember, faith is not sensation.
[2:25:19] By pass sensation, bypass emotion and
[2:25:22] get right with God.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Don't leave here.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Don't be busy today.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; Do some stock taking
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; check all your shelves empty.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; You need some grace.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; Softly.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; He was nailed to the cross for me.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; All the shelves empty.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; Somebody come, they can't even get
[2:25:49] virtue.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Can't even get no strength.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; All they getting is why you hate and why
[2:25:55] you like and what you do. Time to stop
[2:25:57] that. Graviate.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Graduate.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Come out of that nonsense that ain't
[2:26:03] helping you get something that's
[2:26:05] profitable.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; I was with those guys talking and then
[2:26:08] they move in. I said, "Listen, I out of
[2:26:10] that because I not profitable."
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; Vain words.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; Something must mean something.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; We are losing time.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Well, not getting not getting younger.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; What's going to happen to you?
[2:26:26] Hallelujah.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; It begins now.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; You need to cry out to God and go back.
[2:26:33] Come back.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; if God is with me, then why am I like
[2:26:39] this?
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; And then if you are like that, you say,
[2:26:43] "Come,
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; come home. It's supper time. Come home.
[2:26:48] Come and get clean up. Come and get pure
[2:26:50] up. Come let me dismantle
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; the unbelief in you.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; The altar is open. You can make your
[2:26:55] walk.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; You saying your bench should die like
[2:27:00] that
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; and you go on and never get change. Why?
[2:27:05] Because when God sent it, you didn't
[2:27:07] recognize it.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Your assent here
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; will determine your legacy.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; What you do this morning,
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; what you do now,
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; you know God spoke to you. Hallelujah.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; Make the decision.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; Is it you or him
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; who's on the throne?
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; I can't give you. You got to ask him.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; You move away. You come back.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; Because when me tell you, sin brought
[2:27:39] you away.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Repentance brings you back.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; Don't stay in your in your bench and
[2:27:47] say, "I wonder if I should go." That's
[2:27:48] the devil reasoning with you.
[2:27:52] Yes, Lord.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; Am I in a place where he could not do
[2:27:55] much because of unbelief?
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; Break the break it.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; Mash it up.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; You wives,
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; come on.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; You husbands,
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; let me tell you, a business without a
[2:28:11] sign is a sign of no business.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; A church without a sign is a sign of no
[2:28:16] God.
[2:28:18] Hallelujah.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; Where are the signs
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; in your life?
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; My daughter was suffering from epilepsy
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; in sleep
[2:28:31] and it drove me to desperation.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; And I cried before God.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; And everything I tried, it didn't seem
[2:28:41] to work.
[2:28:43] And one day I read the book and he said,
[2:28:46] "Take off the clothes and in desperation
[2:28:50] I ripped that thing off of her and burn
[2:28:52] it." She never had another attack from
[2:28:54] that day. That's about 20 years ago.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; I know this God is real.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; I talked to him. He spoke to me and he
[2:29:04] showed me something about Trinidad. I
[2:29:07] can't tell you. But I can tell you this.
[2:29:09] You don't make that move now.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; When the other time come,
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; you may not be able to.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; But there's darkness over the land.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; And the darkness ain't good.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz I tried to put on the light and it
[2:29:24] was not coming on.
[2:29:27] Unbelief will a church.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; Unbelief will you. It's a
[2:29:32] poison. Take the antidote.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed to walk down
[2:29:39] You walk into sin, walk down to God.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; That's what you have to do. He says,
[2:29:45] "You are ashamed of me, I'll be ashamed
[2:29:47] of you."
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; Young people, what do you put with it?
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; You know, I've been telling you the
[2:29:52] truth. Back in the world, you sisters,
[2:29:56] I'm polishing your fingernails at home
[2:29:58] and when you come to church, clean it
[2:29:59] off.
[2:30:02] All right.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; Looking at things of the world and the
[2:30:05] systems of the world and the designs of
[2:30:07] the world.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; Want to be in the latest this and latest
[2:30:10] that. Where is the latest prayer?
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Where is the latest move of God in your
[2:30:14] life? Aren't you God?
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; Oh God, you mean to tell me we get to a
[2:30:20] place brother Brennan preach and he said
[2:30:21] but 10 people came.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; 10.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; You mean this unbelief so trapped?
[2:30:29] Hallelujah.
[2:30:32] And then he said, "If you can't see, you
[2:30:34] cannot come." Cuz you could only come if
[2:30:37] you call. I'm not calling you to get
[2:30:39] saved. I'm coming here to get
[2:30:40] dismantled. Dismantle unbelief.
[2:30:42] Dismantle. You're not coming to say,
[2:30:44] "Well, I want to get saved." You are
[2:30:45] dismantling unbelief. Right? The
[2:30:46] disciples had it.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; The people had it. Even in his
[2:30:51] resurrection,
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; the disciples had it.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; It's only when the Holy Ghost came, they
[2:30:57] lost it.
[2:30:59] Can you really say when you're going
[2:31:00] home that you have no unbelief?
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; Young man, I call you because you're
[2:31:07] strong.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do? You're going
[2:31:09] to leave and go home.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; Are you going to say, "Well, that
[2:31:13] grenadian know he's talking about."
[2:31:15] Remember this is not grenadian talking
[2:31:16] to you. This is the Holy Spirit.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; You don't want to let this day pass
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; and then it doesn't return.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; It is dark.
[2:31:28] I lie you not.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; Very dark. Yes, sir.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; And darkness represent sin.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; And you don't want to be committing
[2:31:37] adultery.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; Just have unbelief.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; Some of you probably need to get healed.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; But you lose faith because I went up so
[2:31:47] much time and nothing happened. Oh, you
[2:31:50] expect to get healed on your what?
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; Healing and forgiveness go together.
[2:31:56] Not even if Jesus pray for you, he could
[2:31:58] fix you. He had to make it right. You
[2:32:01] say, "I can't make it right. What I did
[2:32:03] to me, I can't forget." Then God forget
[2:32:05] you.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; Nobody can do something so bad that you
[2:32:10] can't forget and forgive. When God
[2:32:12] forgive your sins, when God delivered
[2:32:15] you from where you are, you don't know
[2:32:17] if you're going down the road, you die.
[2:32:20] Are you taking a chance
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; for somebody to pray over you and send
[2:32:23] you in a grave where there's no life?
[2:32:30] [Music]
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; I'm closing now. I can't wait forever.
[2:32:34] And remember, you're not you're not
[2:32:36] staying back because of me. You're
[2:32:38] staying because you don't believe.
[2:32:42] Because if you believe, you'll say,
[2:32:43] "Lord, let me get myself before you and
[2:32:46] get my victory
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; and get my deliverance." Or are you so
[2:32:50] caught up in your way that you ain't
[2:32:52] prepared to exchange it? The rich young
[2:32:54] ruler was not prepared,
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; to give up his band
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; for heaven.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; People are still coming. I'll wait.
[2:33:11] If God is speaking to you, don't don't
[2:33:13] show up on him now.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; Do something now. You know, I'm telling
[2:33:19] you the truth.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; You know,
[2:33:24] do something.
[2:33:27] Don't leave as you came.
[2:33:31] Some of you in the message, but I don't
[2:33:32] mean the message in you.
[2:33:35] Some of us come to church and we
[2:33:36] discontented. We ain't happy. How you
[2:33:38] going to live like that?
[2:33:42] God bless these little children. So for
[2:33:44] the little children to come unto me and
[2:33:46] forbid them not for such is the kingdom
[2:33:48] of heaven. What about you veterans
[2:33:51] in the message that nobody can teach
[2:33:54] nothing because you have all the books
[2:33:56] and yet you have enough grace to say
[2:33:59] Lord help me.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; Is that going to be your response?
[2:34:08] God wants to revolutionize your life.
[2:34:11] Bring back power in it.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; Bring back victory in it.
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; Aren't you tired living a defeated life?

[3:01:58] [Music]
[3:02:09] Hallelujah.
[3:02:21] Can we give the Lord a hand of praise?
[3:02:24] You love the Lord.
[3:02:26] Hallelujah.
[3:02:29] Amen. And what can we say about the
[3:02:32] presence of the Lord in our midst
[3:02:34] &gt;&gt; and to see God's desire to dismantle
[3:02:39] unbelief
[3:02:40] &gt;&gt; to remove all hindrance, all obstacles
[3:02:44] so that faith could stand and
[3:02:46] &gt;&gt; faith could speak.
[3:02:48] &gt;&gt; The power is here, brother Brandham
[3:02:50] said, but it takes faith to move the
[3:02:52] power. Amen.
[3:02:53] &gt;&gt; You know, and perfect faith is based on
[3:02:55] your knowledge and revelation of your
[3:02:58] position in Christ.
[3:02:59] &gt;&gt; So the preaching of the word brings
[3:03:01] clarity to your position
[3:03:03] &gt;&gt; and lets you understand clearly what
[3:03:05] belongs to you and the authority that is
[3:03:08] tied to your position.
[3:03:09] &gt;&gt; Because when you are on your property,
[3:03:11] you can speak because you're on your
[3:03:13] property and the law is designed to
[3:03:15] protect you on your property.
[3:03:17] &gt;&gt; So we thank the Lord for the message
[3:03:19] this morning. How many appreciate the
[3:03:21] message? Appreciate God's servant,
[3:03:24] Brother Redhead, who stood behind his
[3:03:27] sacred desk with a burden to see lives
[3:03:30] changed and transformed.
[3:03:33] So, uh, may God continue to strengthen
[3:03:35] him and use him mightily and grant him
[3:03:38] and his daughter who is here with us
[3:03:39] safe journeys back to Grenada. And by
[3:03:42] the grace of God, we look for more
[3:03:43] fellowship in the future. Amen. Can we
[3:03:46] put our hands together one more time?
[3:03:53] We do have a prayer request. This is
[3:03:56] from Sister Victoria Brown. Please pray
[3:03:58] for Celeste Wrio. She has been through a
[3:04:01] lot but made it to see her 10th birthday
[3:04:03] worthy today. So, we want to remember uh
[3:04:06] her in prayer. And if there's a request
[3:04:08] this morning that you want to show by
[3:04:09] raise of hand as we approach the throne
[3:04:11] of grace this morning uh with faith
[3:04:15] knowing that we could confess it with
[3:04:18] our mouth and know that there's
[3:04:19] something that happens when you speak it
[3:04:21] when you say it. So as you lift your
[3:04:23] hands say it into the atmosphere. Lord
[3:04:27] I'm coming to you for this. I'm coming
[3:04:29] to you for this need. This is the need
[3:04:30] I'm bringing to you. So, it's not just
[3:04:33] to lift your hands this morning, but we
[3:04:35] want to bring it before the throne of
[3:04:36] grace as we come in prayer and unite as
[3:04:39] a church, knowing that there's power in
[3:04:42] the church of the living God. And
[3:04:43] whatever we bind on earth, he has
[3:04:45] promised to bind in heaven. And whatever
[3:04:47] we loose on earth, he has promised to
[3:04:48] loose in heaven. So can we unite as a
[3:04:51] church in prayer all over the building
[3:04:54] downstairs in the kitchen wherever you
[3:04:56] might be online wherever you might be
[3:04:58] right now as we unite in faith if two
[3:05:01] shall agree touching anything we can
[3:05:03] have what we ask for almighty God the
[3:05:05] word has gone forth Lord with clarity
[3:05:10] of this enemy of unbelief that has crept
[3:05:13] in and has taken root but by the grace
[3:05:15] of God and by the wisdom of almighty God
[3:05:18] this demon demon of unbelief has been
[3:05:20] dismantled and we stand on the faith
[3:05:23] that you are the same yesterday, the
[3:05:25] same today, the same forever and there
[3:05:28] is nothing that's impossible Lord with
[3:05:30] you father and through you all things
[3:05:33] are possible father and Lord we bring
[3:05:35] this request for Celeste Dabrio Lord
[3:05:38] whatever it might be father we bring it
[3:05:40] to you Lord that you would touch this
[3:05:43] child in the mighty name of Jesus Christ
[3:05:45] Lord may you continue the work of
[3:05:47] healing deliverance restoration ation
[3:05:49] and all over the building to every hand
[3:05:51] that was raised. Father, every
[3:05:53] declaration that was made, every
[3:05:56] confession that was brought before you,
[3:05:58] Lord, you promise to be the high priest
[3:06:01] of our confession, Father. And unless we
[3:06:03] bring it to you as a confession, you
[3:06:05] can't operate as high priests. So,
[3:06:07] Father, there are there are needs in the
[3:06:09] house this morning of sons and daughters
[3:06:11] who are speaking for their healing. They
[3:06:14] are speaking for their breakthrough.
[3:06:16] They are speaking for their sons, for
[3:06:17] their daughters, for their wives, for
[3:06:19] their husbands, for their finances, for
[3:06:22] their health, for their whatever it
[3:06:24] might be this morning. Lord, we bring it
[3:06:26] to our high priest this morning knowing
[3:06:28] that you could be touched. You are
[3:06:31] touched by the infirmities. Lord, you
[3:06:33] are touched and you walk this journey.
[3:06:35] And Lord, you know what we are going
[3:06:36] through this morning. And Lord, he said
[3:06:38] healing is the children's bread. We come
[3:06:41] to eat of that bread this morning. May
[3:06:43] you minister to your sons. May you
[3:06:45] minister to your daughters. May you
[3:06:47] minister to everyone here in the
[3:06:48] sanctuary, those that are downstairs,
[3:06:50] those that are connected online. We pray
[3:06:53] dear God that every request would come
[3:06:55] back as a note of praise, Father. Lord,
[3:06:57] we pray for your servant with the
[3:06:59] Timothy red hand. Lord, that you will
[3:07:00] touch him. You will restore virtue and
[3:07:03] strength to him. You would anoint him
[3:07:04] aesh from the crown of his head to the
[3:07:06] so of his feet. May you bless his
[3:07:09] daughter is here, his wife, his family,
[3:07:11] the church in Grenada. May they go from
[3:07:14] strength to strength. May a revival
[3:07:16] break forth in that island that will
[3:07:18] shake and ricochet across the region and
[3:07:21] across the world. Father, may you touch
[3:07:23] your church here. Father, may you touch
[3:07:25] our pastor in a special way, his wife,
[3:07:28] Lord, the ministers, elders, deacons,
[3:07:30] ushers, trustees, musicians, helps and
[3:07:33] governments. Father, may you lift a
[3:07:35] standard. Father, you said when the
[3:07:37] enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit
[3:07:39] will raise a stand up. Lord, and there
[3:07:41] are so many churches gathered now,
[3:07:43] gathered earlier, well, gathered today.
[3:07:46] Father, Lord, all claiming, crying,
[3:07:48] pleading for something. May you move
[3:07:50] upon your bride body. We know there's
[3:07:52] not much more time left. Father, may you
[3:07:54] touch your people one more time. May you
[3:07:56] bring us back at the appointed time. May
[3:07:59] you grant traveling mercies and be with
[3:08:01] your people in the precious name of
[3:08:03] Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[3:08:06] &gt;&gt; And the church says,
[3:08:08] &gt;&gt; amen and amen. You may be seated for a
[3:08:10] few announcements.
[3:08:15] [Music]
[3:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:20] I'm going to give a few announcements
[3:08:22] and then
[3:08:25] we have some housekeeping comments that
[3:08:28] I'd like to give. So, I'll cue the tech
[3:08:31] team for when we will wind down the
[3:08:34] streaming. We could address
[3:08:37] a few housekeeping matters.
[3:08:41] We like to welcome Bobby Prince invited
[3:08:42] by brother Shane. God bless you and
[3:08:44] welcome to Headstone Tabernacle. Happy
[3:08:46] to have you here. We trust that the
[3:08:49] service was a blessing to you in a
[3:08:52] mighty way. Service continues this
[3:08:55] Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. We encourage you
[3:08:58] to make every effort to be here. We
[3:09:00] believe a season has changed and we have
[3:09:02] turned a corner and God is requiring
[3:09:05] more from us. So service continues this
[3:09:08] coming Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. This
[3:09:11] coming Friday is the first Friday of the
[3:09:13] month and we are into the last three
[3:09:16] months of 2025.
[3:09:18] So this coming Friday is our day of
[3:09:21] prayer and fasting as a church and that
[3:09:24] will uh lead into our Zoom prayer
[3:09:27] meeting on Friday night at 8:00 p.m. And
[3:09:31] I want to encourage you as a church to
[3:09:34] take this very seriously. We have not
[3:09:36] been this way before, but the Holy
[3:09:37] Spirit is here to guide us and lead us.
[3:09:39] And I don't want you to take any service
[3:09:42] for granted. Whether it's online,
[3:09:44] whether it's in person, whatever it
[3:09:46] might be, treat every single service
[3:09:49] with a level of sacredness, sincerity,
[3:09:52] honesty, transparency because we are
[3:09:54] looking for God to do something. And God
[3:09:56] could speak through the Zoom meeting
[3:09:58] straight into your home
[3:10:00] &gt;&gt; and break chains and shackles. And I
[3:10:01] want to challenge the parents as well.
[3:10:03] it is your responsibility to bring your
[3:10:06] home in order uh for the Zoom Bible
[3:10:10] study for the Zoom prayer meeting as
[3:10:12] well. So, uh and this coming Sunday,
[3:10:14] we'll have two services.
[3:10:17] Service at 10:00 a.m. and the Lord's
[3:10:19] supper at 300 p.m. And I want to remind
[3:10:22] the church as well that Jesus himself
[3:10:25] said, "Do this in remembrance of me."
[3:10:28] And you know in that whole uh expression
[3:10:32] of the Lord's supper, he said, "If you
[3:10:34] don't do this, you have no part of me."
[3:10:37] You know, so it behooves us to fulfill
[3:10:39] all righteousness. It behooves us to get
[3:10:41] our homes in order. It behooves us to
[3:10:44] rebuild the altars of our prayer lives
[3:10:47] and our sacredness and his sanctity and
[3:10:50] all of the messages that have been
[3:10:51] unfolding. And you have to be blind to
[3:10:54] not see that God has been doing
[3:10:55] something. This last three months in
[3:10:57] particular have been a real turning
[3:10:59] point from the convention in July into
[3:11:03] God unfolding things in August to what I
[3:11:07] could only say is one the grace of God
[3:11:09] but to the divine plan of God. Because
[3:11:12] as we would have said, if you would have
[3:11:14] asked us in August what this month would
[3:11:17] have looked like, there is no way on the
[3:11:20] plan that we could have had both brother
[3:11:22] Jonathan Martin and brother Timothy
[3:11:24] Redhead would have been here with us.
[3:11:26] But God in his grace saw it fit to send
[3:11:28] love gifts that are in the body to give
[3:11:31] food to the body. That this mystical
[3:11:34] body that we are in is not just this
[3:11:35] local church, but God sent his love
[3:11:37] gifts to us to encourage us along the
[3:11:40] journey. And we don't want to ever take
[3:11:41] that for granted. So we appreciate the
[3:11:43] Lord's grace to us over these three
[3:11:45] months in particular and to see how God
[3:11:47] has unfolding what he wants to do to
[3:11:49] bring us to our spot because truly time
[3:11:51] is short. So once again, service is
[3:11:54] coming Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. Uh our day
[3:11:57] of prayer and fasting and and church.
[3:11:59] This is for us to pray and to fast. Uh
[3:12:02] it's not something to be taken lightly.
[3:12:04] And uh I want to encourage you to commit
[3:12:07] to it. Do it. It's a small sacrifice.
[3:12:10] It's a small sacrifice to make. And
[3:12:12] we'll talk a bit more about some of
[3:12:14] these things uh in in the housekeeping.
[3:12:16] Uh and of course this Sunday we have
[3:12:19] double service 8 a.m. uh sorry 10:00
[3:12:21] a.m. and 3 p.m. with the Lord's supper.
[3:12:24] Maintenance team group one, please meet
[3:12:27] with brother Popwell after the service.
[3:12:29] And next week, Lord willing, group three
[3:12:32] is carded to serve with his brother Andy
[3:12:35] Henry's group. So may the Lord bless you
[3:12:37] richly and I'll ask the tech team to uh
[3:12:41] wind off the connection.
