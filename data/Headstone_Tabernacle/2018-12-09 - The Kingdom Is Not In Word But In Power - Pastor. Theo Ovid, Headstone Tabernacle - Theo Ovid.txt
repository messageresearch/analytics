and forever knowing that you are still a healer you are still away maker you are still a restorer you Estella Baptizer you could still change a situation not even now you can change the situation even now you can change the situation I don't care what the doctor says the situation could be changed we will receive the report of the Lord let the doctors it won't be finished let the neighbors report me finish let the bosses report be finished but we will receive today the report of the Lord of we will receive what the Lord says concerning us a father made a fireball today me shackles be broken me chains be broken in the name of Jesus Christ and the church says [Music] if you have your Bibles will you turn it me with one the one question scripture just to greet you this morning I'm not going to preach but it's gonna greet you Philippians 3 and verse 13 Philippians 3 and verse 13 brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus made a lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning before I greet you we do have some notes of praise brother Joseph Williams giving thanks to God for my dad who swelling has gone down a man we can't go to that today amen and I'm just the christine i would like to turn the scenes for the prayer and give God all the glory for healing me on Sunday last after prayer was offered he may have we thank God for that [Applause] from sis from Marcia Nicholas Luther priest times given for healing from a terrible head cold and from coughing we do have a special visitor in our gates Cadell o Lonard way you acted alone welcome to head so Tabernacle invited by but it again for Francis we're so happy to have you here well certainly it's good to be in the house of God today said me happy to be in fellowship this morning and I bring greetings from by the Petersham law I ministered in London twice about three weeks ago Wednesday night and three Sundays ago and then I was in Argentina two Sundays ago and then last week the enemy tried to knock me out with some cool virus and I'm still kind of corporate from it but the devil is defeated random said you know you have to let the devil know whose side you're on you're not just gonna let God know whose side you have to let it devil know whose side you're on and when it seemed like you're on the roof and you bring us sacrifice of praise because the sacrifice of praise as well you don't maybe feel like praising or the situation doesn't allow you to do it the way you want to but you make a sacrifice you make a sacrifice because it costs a bit more to do it because the expectation is you don't do it but when the cost is greater because the situation is rough then the fragrance that comes up to God is sweeter so the trials and the testing and the problem in the situations that we go through are to make the fragrance of our worship more acceptable to God because it comes from a better place and it is not just a casual worship somebody help me this morning it is not just a casual worship but it comes from a place of of being and understanding and knowing that you went through something to be here this morning can the church a man so if you have been through something and when you say hallelujah and God says yes that's my son or when you've been through something and you say thank you Jesus he touched my daughter because the angels can't sing like we can see me angels don't know about amazing Graceland anybody knows about his amazing grace that took us through this year it's it's amazing greens nothing but the grace of God when you look back you may be seated on you when you look back in your soul you'll never make it true you'll never be that bill you'll never be able to accomplish this you'll never be able to make that breakthrough you'll never be able to to get back on your feet and the devil told you you wouldn't even last this year but here you are this morning it's not you holding yourself at least when I am trying knows what I'm talking about if it's one person in the house and I'm not gonna call it I don't know anybody else you've got it but when your testimony becomes if it hadn't been for the Lord who was on my side where would I meet [Music] and the Bible said the Lord had cheated me soul but he had not given me your unto death because he's taking me through a process III can't define the process but he knows what it'll take to bring me to perfection he knows just what it'll take to bring me to adoption he knows the process to take me through that when the future is taking notes and walking around behind you he say yes that's a that's a good son that's a good daughter you throw this at him and he still worship you did this to her and she's still the worship oh come on somebody freaks back to me [Music] and above all else as the Apostle Paul said forgetting the things that are past you have to let go what's behind you to step our you cannot press the gas and the brakes at the same time let today be the beginning of a new creation let today be a team where you say I don't want to hear but yesterday I don't want to hear what last month I don't want to hear what last year God is the only employer who doesn't look at your resume [Applause] because your resume speaks of your past what you did whether it's good or bad is irrelevant to God he does not look at your past he is only interested in your destination he is only he's the blood of your future yes he's the god of yesterday yes he's the god of today but he is also a coda tomorrow and truly Apostle Paul he said forget about the past don't let your sin wear you down let's don't let go [Music] and it's it's it's not Jess you know and when Paul is speaking he's speaking from a place of deep understanding so brethren I count not myself and I know what he's saying after all I've been through I don't consider myself to know a lot I don't consider myself to understand a lot there's a lot that I don't know but this one thing I do it is one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth of the boss things which are before I press towards the month but the prize of the high calling of God Almighty and the Bible tells me that since the days of John the kingdom of God is Prince and every man every man [Applause] [Music] I just wanna encourage you this morning because I believe that the devil has a job to do and he is very good don't underestimate how good is at doing his job but don't also underestimate how good god is doing his job and don't also underestimate how good you are because as a seed in you that has a job to do also that just needs the right environment and in the right environment that see that has no choice but to perform in the right environment and when you plant the seed the seeds are planted in sugar it's not planted in the floor it's not planted in a clean please expanded in the mess in the muck and the mire in the manure and the messed up the more messed up it is is the more nutrients because the Bible said his strength is made perfect in our weakness so you look at your situation and see it's so messed up and Collison I led you there so that I can make you prosper it would not be your ability it will not be your wisdom it'll not be your thinking it will not be your strategy it will not be you but it will be me living through you for that when people see you they will take not that it is Jesus on the inside working on the else oh what a change in my life somebody cement so we came to the house of God to worship we came to the house of God to get reminded that we are creatures of eternity that is trapped in time as a proving ground and once we have been proven and tried we get to do what Abraham wanted to do and what David wanted to do and what Joshua wanted to do which was give the devil the poolman out Nahor blue we are here this morning as a wave sheaf for our family we are here as a wave sheaf for our love words we are here as a wave sheaf to prove that others are coming this is just a 40th of a glory NAT supporter unfold what is supposed to do something great in this season we are the end of the end you know there are many people would never talk [Music] and I said it in London I believe and a mere citizen in in Argentina as well we are not leaving in the rapture Oh a ton gonna make it no that's not how we are living here Victoria we are leaving here with our foot properly positioned on the devil's neck you will take your time to put your foot and the Bible said the question is this the man who caused all these trouble is this the devil that caused all this for all easy is this is this the one or when you recognize who you are but the Branham said then it'll be over when the bride recognizes who she is it is gonna be finished can the church say man so today's especially after service today we have our church luncheon fellowship after service so we are on the green expedition for that and this morning we have a very short message with a powerful message it's part of its second message in Argentina it was the closing out message and the Holy Ghost really rocked the service no intent dropped down for those of you I've seen it you can be blessed again and to those who have not entered it forget who's next to you forget who's at the side of you and the messages the kingdom is not in word but in power and that's what we are looking for in this season but the kingdom to become a reality us not just as wood but as power power to change our lives power to cheat off families I was achieved
