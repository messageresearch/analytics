thank you but anthony a great privilege to be here once again tonight uh in his presence gathered around the word of god in such a time as this and we thank god for his grace for his mercy for his love to us that we could be called in such a time as this it's it's it's a tough time for the world but for the bride of jesus christ she is being challenged to look up because that's where our redemption is coming from so i'm happy to be here tonight uh looking for god to speak to us and before we um get started tonight i do want to read our note of praise and then take two prayer requests before we open in uh prayer this evening i believe it was uh last sunday uh we'd have had this prayer request from sister bernadette uh for her sister i think who would have had uh the coronavirus i believe and um we would have prayed for her and she sent a note to praise good morning brother ovid i would like to give the lord a high note of praise and to thank the saints for their prayers my sister is feeling much better the numbness and her fingers are gone she is also off the oxygen because the doctor says that she no longer needs it please continue to pray to keep her in prayer that she's still at the hospital for further observation because of the ravages and the after effects to the virus but thank you jesus so we want to thank god for taking her out of that rough spot and we want to continue to remember her in prayer also i also saw that uh sister judith samuel requested prayer feeling a little unwell and a slight discomfort in her tonsil when she swallows and also a request from sister christine for her father experiencing headaches dizziness and stiffness in his chest and for naomi with an infection on her belly pain so can we just bow our heads for a word of prayer and if there's any requests a night that was not sent in but you want to be remembered in prayer and you want to lift your hands where you at god is able this evening to know what is both spoken and what is also not spoken so can we approach the throne of grace tonight our gracious heavenly father lord we are so humble to be able to gather lord in this way and at this time and in this season for the lord as a people understanding lord and when you walk the earth lord and that centurion had enough faith lord to come and to make his petition known lord you didn't decide to go to his house father because that man had enough faith to know that if you just speak the word lord what you declared would have to come to pass so tonight father without having to be in the physical presence lord of every situation lord that's represented in this virtual room tonight we pray that lord you will dispatch your angels that the presence of the lord will descend into every room into every house lord to those that are on this lord this meeting tonight is bible study tonight lord and that you would touch us at the point of our needs lord we pray right now for our sister judith samuel right now that whatever discomfort whatever feeling oh lord virus or otherwise or whatever it is we come against it tonight in the name of jesus christ we say satan take your hands off of god's daughter tonight lord god we pray for sister christine and for lord her father with that sickness and that tightness of chest and all of that lord we committed into your hands knowing that you are still a miracle worker you are still a healer and for little naomi may you completely heal her and lord for sister bernadette sister who is on a road to recovery may you complete that recovery tonight and for everyone tonight who lord lifted their hands lord expressed a need lord those that i can see those i cannot see those that lord express themselves in whatever way father you see our hearts you see our needs we are needy people tonight lord and we are so grateful that you are god that hears our cries and hear our prayers so may you lord god hear our cry tonight and as we approach your word may you open our understanding to the scriptures may you walk out the pages of the bible may it become a new book to us tonight lord may become a reality to us tonight that we could see lord to see you in all your glory to see you in your power to see what you want us to see tonight lord we commit this bible study into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen and amen well certainly it's a great privilege to be here tonight once more and so happy everyone was able to make it out i uh i uh i don't know where to start tonight um i have a little thought a little uh trying to bring something out of of the scripture for us tonight i'm still in second kings and um god has it in such a way that it's unfolding without a plan it's not my plan i believe we are walking in his plan and um you know i was sitting down kind of meditating over the last few days and seeing we i'm actually doing a series and i didn't know i was doing a series and it actually started with second kings five when we spoke about neiman and then we went into six and seven uh where we dealt with uh the lepers and now trying to go into eight but to go into eight i have to go back to four so we are in the the second king series uh tonight seeing how god is revealing himself to us and uh a lot of what we have been discussing has surrounded elisha um and we know elisha um you know would have you know been mentored by elijah as it were um he would have seen this great prophet you know operate and we know the story how elijah took the mantle and put it on elisha and we know throughout scripture that there are five identifications of this ministry of elijah we see it identified with elijah we see it identified with elisha we see it identified with john the baptist we see it identified with brother branham and we also see it in the book of revelation identified with moses and elijah that would minister to the jews so we know that elijah has a special place special place in scripture special place to us and i was sharing with brett ovid you know as i delve deeper into scripture and slow things down i like i like to slow things on because and it really comes from a deeper understanding that every single word in scripture is important so if within the the great mind of christ the great mind of god you know and i was sharing with brother ovid i believe on saturday as on saturday that you know it's as if it's as if you had a great grandfather to see the context of the gravity of it that you never knew you never met you never you know but you knew he was a man of great wisdom and and you happened to stumble upon some of his writings that that would kind of give you advice and then you realize that when you read it you know it's showing you how to live showing you how to showing you how to operate and i want you to multiply that by 10 million thousand times and to see the great mind of god you know that that god tried to capture himself you know and put it in word form that if you were to spend time in that word and see him as brother branham said if you don't see jesus in every verse of scripture you know read it again because he is there and that's that's a problem to find him go and look and find him in there you know so as we approach the word tonight it's a familiar text and um i know we we refer to it many times with with preaching and speaking but i just want to kind of sew down tonight uh not going to be too long with you i think i've been seeing that um for a few um times and and um it's kind of you know i think i i get a bit excited but it's a positive excitement because now more than ever the word must be your comfort no more than ever your word must be your inspiration there are many voices out there but this voice is so inspired and to think that god would send our elijah in this day to give us full insight into this book that when we read it now we're not reading it as the pentecostals do or as the theologians do but we are reading it you know through the eyes of the prophet as he would have brought a reveal word to bring light to the written word so our text tonight uh if i were to give it a title i wrote it down somewhere um for a title of this bible study tonight it is the title is it as well a study of the sonomite woman it is well a study of the sonamite woman and i'm sure you know everyone would have heard of the shona might woman before so we want to kind of look at this sister today a little bit and see what god wants us to see out of you know this this story tonight so we find this in second kings uh chapter four and verse eight and i'm reading of course from the king james but i also have a reference from the amplified and i have also some other notes um because i'm trying to capture the essence you know there's a lot said there and brother branham also said certain things about this that brought light that is not very obvious to see so we want to really take our time through this tonight and also to get into that situation you know kind of kind of rewind and go back as it were you know to that point in time so the bible said so we had second kings four and verse eight um and it fell on a day that elijah passed to sunum where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread all right so and it fell on a day that elijah passed to shunam where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread now the king james here uses the word great but in the amplified it says there came a day when elijah went over to show them where there was a prominent and influential woman so that's what great we're referring to is prominent it's influential then we come across now there's another translation where it says where a wealthy woman lived so we know clearly that this woman is a woman of substance she's a woman of influence she's a woman of authority she's a woman who is has a certain level of command she is in a position of strength as it will and she lived in shunam very much like the woman with the issue of blood we are not given her name we are just told that she's the woman from sunum and by definition she is the sunamite which is the descriptor the description of somebody who lived in that particular area that very small village of shunam which was under at that time the control of the tribe of issachar so as it would happen this great prophet elisha he would be somewhat in the earlier parts of his ministry because it was only about any beginning of second kings or thereabouts is when that mantle would have been passed on so we don't know what the prophet is up to we don't know what he's doing but it would so happen that as he's passing through sunum where this great woman she constrained him to eat bread that word constrained means to to persuade so it's not as if elisha was walking with his hands out looking for food it's not that he walking saying you have food here it's not that he thought he was a restaurant and he's not like he was passing and he smelled the food and said let me let me pass by and see this thing smiling let me let me see if she will give me something he is passing by but this woman sees something about him and we'll see in scripture you know she reveals what she sees about him but the bible said she constrains she persuades uh in another translation it says urge him so it is almost as if to use the word urge to use the word constrain to use the word persuade means it's almost the prophet displayed a certain level of reluctance you know he didn't want to impose he didn't want to place demands on this woman you know as as much as she's a woman of means and a woman of wealth and a woman of substance and a woman of prominence he's not taking that for granted to say what she has might as well take it he is still reserved in his action you know and but abraham and speaking about this particular situation you know says that that god doesn't show his prophets everything you know so it is not as if elisha is is have a radar and knows her motive he doesn't know her objective he doesn't know what her agenda is so he is he is being constrained he's being pushed you know to to to stop and and and eat as it were so and it goes on and so it was that as oft as he passed by he turned in feather to eat bread so that one encounter of stopping and eating let to a habit be informed let a relationship be informed and i want to strike that would relationship be informed that as often as elisha was in this area it was no longer a matter of being constrained or urged but it was like a reach how how how are you doing you know he developed a relationship with with him afterwards in another chance afterwards whenever he passed by he stopped there for a meal so at that point in time elisha is comfortable to stop by this woman of substance of means is happy to have such good company so to speak in her house as it were and verse nine says she said to her husband and she said unto her husband now she said to honor behold now i perceive that this is the holy man of god which passed it by us continually so this woman now is showing determinant and we're building into something she deserves it's a holy man and as much as she is prominent as much as she is wealthy as much as she is influential this is also the first time we are hearing the husband and we're hearing him in context and she said unto her husband behold now i perceive that this is the holy man of god which passed by us continually let us make a little chamber i pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick and it shall be when he comes to us that he shall turn in feather now i don't know what it was that she saw about elisha maybe i would imagine that as he ate and she saw him traveling because he was on his way somewhere so it's not as if he was as it's not as if that house was the destination it was merely a point as he was passing by he was stopping somebody to eat and maybe she said well witness the prophet looking a little tired maybe the prophet place to rest and she didn't just take it upon herself as much as and i want to stress this as much as she is powerful and and clearly seems to be running things a certain way and operating a certain way she still goes down to within the context of a husband in a house and saying i discern this is a man of god this is not an ordinary visitor as much as we are hospitable and hospitality is is what we do and we from the tribe of issachar you know in this city we operate a certain way that city would have been a farming city how wealth more than likely would have come from farming and agriculture and cattle and we'll see where we get that a little later on as we study tonight but i discern that this is a man of god and because it's a man of god i want to give him a bit more respect i want to honor him and give him a little more than food i wanted to see the context of this thing being built up because these are the actions that she took that led to first order and second order consequences in other words if she didn't do this then other things would not have happened all right so i wanted to understand that all of our decisions and actions and thought processes in other words she saw a need and she also saw that she had the means to do something about a need she saw she saw that she could have done more for this man of god and the bible says let us make a little chamber i pray on the wall and in another chance he says please let us make a little fully wall upper room it was it was on the house stop in in the amplified and put a bed there for him so so he could relax so he could rest with a table and a chair and a lampstand and whenever he comes to visit he can turn in there he'll have his privacy he'll feel at home he'll feel comfortable he wouldn't feel he's imposing because we put him on top of the house in those days the architectural structure would have been almost like a flat roof so to speak so it would have been almost like a flat structure and on top of this flat structure she decided to go up and put a little staircase so that the prophet would have to climb to go a little higher to sit on top of the house where after you have a wonderful meal i want you to see this though after you have a wonderful meal he could sit on he could relax he could write some notes he could meditate he could take a dr he could take a rest and when he's ready and he's resting he's comfortable he can continue along his journey and the bible goes on to verse 11 and it fell on india that he came thinner and he turned into the chamber and leave here in other words one day he came there he was used to doing it he was comfortable doing it he felt so good about doing it he turned into the upper room and laid down to rest and verse 12 and he said to jahazi his servant call this tsunamite in other words it's almost like a realization dawned upon him call this to the man and when he had called us she stood before him so clearly elisha was there and and something hit him so he said call her and he said unto her he said unto him and i want i wanted to see this and and it's a big lesson here because there are a lot of lessons here all right so we spent some time talking about hospitality we talk about entertaining gets almost unawares because it would seem from scripture the discernment of who he was came after spending enough quality time with him to understand who she was dealing with it's almost as if she wasn't sure at first and he said i perceive that perceiving took some time to perceive that this is a man of god and she's doing this she's been hospitable she clearly has no agenda because she's not asking anything for return this is her way of just doing something positive but this has such an impact on the prophet that the prophet now wants to do something for her but yet he doesn't even address her directly i find this to be a very interesting thing he is very respectful he is showing great respect for her he's not saying because i'm a prophet i can do what i want i can no no he calls his servant in verse 12 and he said to jahazie and call this shunammite so he doesn't call her he tells jazzy to call her and when he had called her she stood before him and he said unto him in other words elisha is speaking true jihazi to the woman that's the level of respect say now unto her behold thou has been careful for us with all this care in other words you have been doing all this stuff for us this thing cannot go unrewarded what is to be done for thee question in other words what can i do for you so far you have done all this for me you cook you didn't give me a room you know you built a whole you're built you went into construction out of respect for the office what can i do for you in another translation he said you have gone to all this trouble for us what can i do for you what has thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host question so elisha and i want us to catch this because there's a mystery in this gives her two options what can i do for you and i want us to stick a pencil here or a pin here or a little bookmark here because it's important and i want you to understand that when a prophet speaks sometimes the prophet is speaking and he's not even sure i want to be careful to say this how his words will become manifest i want to be very careful in saying this but he is connected to the spiritual dimension so he's asking her he's looking at a woman in power looking at a woman with means looking at the weapon in substance and he's saying what can i do for you do you need me to speak to the king do you need me to speak to the captain of the guard but the branham in speaking about this said that and he was dramatizing elisha would have said i've been annoyed king personally i could put in a word for you i have a relationship with him i know the captain of the god so he's given these two options a favor from the king in another translation he said uh would you like to be mentioned with a king or to be captain of the army and listen to her response and she answered i dwell among my own people and it's a it's like a loaded statement i dwell among my own people in the amplified she answered i live among my own people in peace and security and need no special fevers in other words she is content she is comfortable she is happy what a place to be how many people you know who can say i am content i am happy i don't need i don't need anything you know what i want to buy i could buy where i want to go i could go i could if i want to build a room i could build a room you know here with you know and and this is how she was and it was it was it was also a few things being said there as well because this statement actually almost bothered elisha all right now minor people now verse 14 and he said you have to go into other translations to see that there's actually a pause there so it's as if when she said this she actually almost went away because in the amplified it says later elisha said so it is not as if this is a continuing conversation it's as if elijah say to her what can i do for you you want me to speak to the king on your behalf you need a favor from the king you need any help is there anything you need to enforce you need army you need security is there anything you need to get get is there anything you need to to to to be enforced and she said no i am good i am among my people i am fine and that was the end of the conversation but there's something going on in the supernatural realm that elijah still cannot can't rest so to speak you know he's not comfortable because he is seeing this great effort and by now he is more convinced than ever that this woman has no agenda i want this i want this to catch this no she is doing something unto the lord without a plan to get anything i want this to catch just for a minute you know many people do things unto the lord with a with a plan to get something back but this was not this woman this woman was doing something genuinely if there ever was a person in scripture who we could find who was doing something 100 genuinely without any desire for anything in return this is the example if you ever want to take note of of how to live for god and how to live in service for his people and how to support the kingdom without anything in return this is one of the greatest if not the greatest example in scripture because if elisha didn't pursue this further this would have continued this way we don't know how long because she said i don't want anything and it's i could imagine it's that response that forced elijah to dig deeper wondering if perhaps there was something that she needed that maybe she didn't want to see something that she had need of that she wasn't comfortable to express some dream that perhaps she had that maybe for so long she wanted it and it didn't happen that she gave up hope on this dream and this dream ended up a very dream a dream that she may think could never come to pass so why ask about it why look for it why expect it you know when i was younger i thought i could achieve it but now that i'm at this stage and i'm i'm comfortable why stress about it anymore so verse 14 and he said what then is to be done for her in other words i am not leaving this house without doing something with this lady that's a powerful place to be here so in other words i want to find the key the key to give and and i want us to see what attributes elisha is displaying here you know what abraham said god wants to give us your holy ghost born i want to receive it in other words this is the christ-like nature upon elijah saying this sister is worthy of reward but i don't want to just give her any reward i want to give her a reward that that would bless her and give her joy and fulfill her desire so i want you to understand that god wants to be able to grant the desires of your heart because as much as she was expressing she had comfort and she was content and she needed nothing there was a desire that she had that she was not expressing everybody with me tonight all right so we we we on we we're going a bit slowly i hope i'm going too slow and he said what there needs to be done for her this is verse 14. and jahazi answered verily she had no child and her husband is old and he said call her in other words elisha is saying that's it and this year a fan is also mind-blowing so elisha called her and when he had called her she stood in the door and i find it such a great lesson of humility a lesson of respect you know it have people when they do something for you you could never ever get all your mind they do something for you they hold it over your head so i want you to picture this is really her house the room elisha is in is her room it's on loan to the prophet but now elisha calls for her the second time and she stops by the door in other words she has so much respect for the man of god it's not like some people you know we say well well i walk in here my room is is my house and i build it my money is your is my money when you build your own room you go away in your room but not this woman this woman was was completely respectful so she stood and and again i want us to understand why i say every word is important because the fact that it's written here in scripture is not for us to speak past it and not consider what god wants us to get out of this many times we do things and we take it back we bless people and we unbless them we operate in such a way that people have to know what you do and how you impacted them i wanted to understand the complete selfless nature and how she operated even though she was a woman of needs and influence she operated almost like a servant almost like somebody said well i'm not even worried they committed his room she she had no claim on on the room i want us to catch that because it's there for a reason and she stood in the door and he said so now he's speaking clearly now called her and she called her and she came and stood in the door elijah said at this caller and and he said about this season according to the time of life thou shalt embrace a son so in in other words he didn't ask her if you want a child he he the asking part was finished the question and answer part was over that was dealt with in the formal conversation this now was not a conversation about what you want it it wasn't like would you be interested in a child no he just prophesied hallelujah he just prophesied over her and he spoke a prophecy to her that she had to get enough faith to catch the prophecy because her statement was he said about this season according to the time of life thou shalt embrace his son and she said nay my lord it was almost overwhelming to her this woman who was a friend to the prophet hallelujah almost almost went into doubt without doubting because she can't believe that the prophet deserved that the prophet figured out that the prophet and his servant figured out what what that that unspoken request that she had that she never talks about anymore because it's so long she gave up hope on this thing she can't believe this could be this could ever be a reality i want us to catch this nowhere because this has significance as we go further all right i just said name my lord dumb man of god do not lie unto that handmaiden no this statement is big because it's the first time she almost come in um it would almost appear as if she's coming against the man of god because this is it it shows how god was shocking her system i want you to understand this god is coming against every her whole life that was structured a certain way you know because sometimes people push for success to mask things they can't achieve or or they don't want people to know there's hurt in there oh god help us tonight there are there are things that people push to achieve and acquire to to to give this impression of success and happiness and achievement to already mercy hidden pain and basically elijah was calling out that hidden pain so much that she was saying don't go there don't touch that that's a sore spot in my heart i gave up hope a long time ago don't lie to me in in other words i feel like i've been lied too many times before oh help us i feel like i had to deal with this issue and deal with the rejection and the pain of it before so i don't want to i don't i can't relive the emotions of this thing but again just like sarah her fear her insecurity about this had nothing to do with the word of prophecy spoken i want us to catch this tonight the word of prophecy spoken about her situation was bigger than her fears her insecurity her dream what she taught about it the fact that she thought it was possible or impossible was irrelevant because at that time like i said it was no longer a question it was the prophecy and we know that when a prophet speaks hallelujah the prophecy has got to come to pass there's no devil there's no demon no principality your doubt your fears your unbelief it's irrelevant in the economy of god can the church say amen and i love it from 16 to 17 and the woman conceived in other words it is it is one leap from verse 6 universe 17. it's it's in one verse it's prophecy and the next verse is fulfillment so and understand the context at this season they say this time my life it means a year would have passed so you you carry this like a novel elijah said at this season next year you will embrace a son in the amplified so this verse 16 between verse 16 and verse 17 is a year between verse 16 and verse 17 time alive between verse 16 and verse 17 whole life transformed between verse 69 verse 17 she needs to think about how to put crib and how to get training for baby and what to put in place kind of church say amen everybody with me so i want us to catch now prophecy how god is dealing with her now right and the woman conceived and bear a son at that season that elisha had said according to the time of life in other words what the prophet spoke came to pass exactly the way the prophet spoke it and if you understand that we are in a message with a vindicated prophet then whatever the prophet spoke has got to come to pass in the right season and at the right time whether you believe it you don't believe it whatever it does not matter it's got to come to pass can the church say amen now between verse 17 and verse 18 is years between 16 and 17 is one year between 17 and 18 is years we don't know how many years but it's enough years is because this boy now is a is a is either one or two things and you'll see it it's either elijah wasn't too tall or his boy was he or was was was very tall for his age because he was he was grown and when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the reapers now i want to just say something in passing here because we cannot i think i went a little too fast over that point this woman said don't lie to me but at the same time the bible is saying the husband was older so the miracle of delivering a child to this woman was not just a miracle to her it would have been a miracle in other words there is very little said about her husband one thing we see clearly is there is respect for her husband so we have this situation where we have a seemingly younger wife this you know my woman who clearly is a is a woman of business she's a business woman she's married to an older man who from all appearances doesn't seem to be too involved in the running of the business as it were he is kept in the loop he's kept in conversation it would appear and we'll see that she would have greater faith than he does but her faith is great enough that even in his old age he is part of the process to have a child i want this to catch that right so when the child was grown it fell on the day that he went out to his father to the reapers in other words he went out to work and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to the father in seeing this like many fathers do karate child by him you know what went on carry my mother anybody ever experienced it carry him to his mother and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died now i want us to process this for a little bit how are we doing with the time we have time i i didn't check so and when you're taking him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died till noon meant he was there for a while for some period of time it was not all of a sudden type situation it was progressive a situation like this progress it meant that the mother would have been battling between hope and not having hope she is reliving that protection she would have had that belief she would have had maybe if she was running through a mind that i never thought i'd have a child and against hope there's a miracle but now the miracle the thing that i thought was not even possible is sitting down on me and life is leaving dream is dying possibilities of what would happen when i'm gone is feeling because this is my only child the clock is ticking and she is watching watching it's a private moment as it were because we would see that your father is not even in a loop on what's going on i want us to pause for a minute and process this out of all of our achievements this would have been her greatest because anything that she thought she would never have but yet by god's grace it has come to life for her and the life is being slowly taken away minute by minute the heaviness would increase heaviness would increase until by noon she died he died and died this woman is a lesson in i didn't ask for this son god give me the son this thing can't be over i didn't ask for this blessing i didn't try to get this blessing this blessing came to me this thing cannot be over i didn't hunt for this message i didn't look for this message this message came to me this thing cannot be over the experience i had i didn't hunt for it i didn't look for it i was doing my own thing living my own life and this thing interrupted my life and now it would seem as if there's no life in it it looks dead it looks dead it looks like it's finished but i'm not going to accept no this is huge she is not willing to accept that after all that she went through not what she did i want you to catch this but what god did after she would have gone through that because if this gift this blessing she had was not based on her trying to get it i wanted to catch that for a minute it was based on god doing something for her she could not accept that this was how her story was going to end if i could connect into last week's teaching it was i'm not gonna just sit here and let this happen she was just unwilling to allow this to be the closing chapter of the closing verse of this story was not going to be then died oh hallelujah this this was not going to be the end of chapter 4 of second king i want us to catch us and i want us to see against hope that she had enough fit to do something and i want us to catch that you have to have faith to do something so instead of crying instead of balling on the police instead of holding a head and any whole neighbor i said stop working because work still going on i want us to see the picture the boy had went up with the father to work so work is going on the father still out there on the field this woman is there this thing happens and she air cry she had ball she had changed clothes she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god and shot the door behind him and went out hallelujah in other words you see this boy you see that room that is your room where this thing started you see that upper room okay you ruined up the house where the man of god rested i didn't ask for this it's god gave me this gift i'm putting him right back on the bed where the man of god slept and the bible said she laid him on the bed of the man of god and shut the door upon him and went out and she called on to her husband not to say your son is dead she called on to her husband not to say i am depressed she called on to her husband not to say i live in a church she called on to her husband not to say i do believe the prophet she called on to her husband saying i think it's time to backslide she called unto her husband i think it's time to adopt she called on to her husband not to say everything negative you say send me i pray the one of the young men and one of the asses that i may run to the man of god and come again in other words i just want to run down the road and come again now run down the road is 30 kilometers to mount carmel because that is where elisha would spend now quality time it may be that he was on the road to carmel whenever he was passing through there we don't know but that is where he spent time the same camel that his predecessor elijah had his showdown with the false prophets of baal who came out from under jezebel's foolishness but that he said i want to run down by elisha and i'll be back and the husband is old but he is stupid he he oh but you can't pull all over your eyes he said and he said wherefore will thou go to him today in other words what day is it it is neither the new moon nor sabbath and if you know your jewish history those were the two days that the prophets would speak right in other words the church days as much as in the northern kingdoms people were backslidden under ahab and now under jehoram underground in those days the prophets the priests the levites who are around would still have their little service on either the the new moon or the sabbath so she said so in other words he's thinking it was a new moon or the sabbath i could understand you're going to see elisha but but why are going on scenes today and she said it shall be well i love your response it shall be well so shia tell her husband your son did she even explain why she wouldn't she'll say it shall be well and friends this builds on the positive you need to change your language i want us to catch this tonight if it's anything you get tonight it's it's change your language you need to speak positive you need to speak positive take the negative words out of your language it doesn't belong it doesn't belong to us you see those things that are revealed those things belong to us not negative things see she said it shall be well and we're gonna build a little bit on that and she suddenly asked and said to her servant drive and go forward slack not die riding for me except i bid thee in the amplified it says then she saddled the donkey and set herself and drive the animal fast do not slow down the pace for me unless i tell you in other words just race so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel and it came to pass in other words so she's she's on the way to cameron and it came to pass now it's about 30 kilometers so at the rate of a donkey at 30 kilometers this wasn't really a short trip you know theologists have debated how long it already took her to make it there and back it it was some effort donkeys are not known for being the race animal there are no donkey races it's horse racing donkeys is a it's a it's a process so she is going as fast as she possibly can on a donkey so poor elisha is seeing this sight because the donkey is being this is has to be a site so elisha now i want us to see now how god operates you know we prophesy in part but whenever just perfect has come so the prophet is there and and when she came it came that when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to jehoshaphat behold yonder is that tsunami now this in and of itself is interesting because he has seen her coming but up to no there's there's no mention of her name after this is this is not a year this is this is years later so all that time elisha in the house eat food sleep a year pass child born child grow up child die he don't even know and up to no he don't hurt a woman and i love stories like these because i always say when the scripture doesn't name the person you could slip your name there because it could be anybody it's like the woman with the issue of blood whatever issue you have it doesn't say a woman from there's no description for her name it's a situation we're dealing with we're dealing with people who trying their best to serve god and god saying i've given you a blessing and yet life happens and you have to fight to preserve the blessing and have faith that god also will keep that blessing that he promised you because he made a promise to you what you have today is because of his blessings many people could say if not all you have things you never knew you would have you have had experiences you never knew you would have what you have been able to achieve in life you never thought you would achieve and it's not your ability it's not even your works but god's favor has been on your life you've got as much as you choose to complain at times you have more reason to be thankful than to complain you have more reasons to be happy than to be sad you have more reasons to be encouraged than to be discouraged anybody with me tonight so she went and came unto the man of god in verse 25 to mount carmel and it came to pass when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to jahazi his servant behold yonder is that shunammite run now i pray in other words close the gap because you you rate this spectacle i see happening here you reach you come into me go and close the gap because whatever going on go out there find out what what it is run now i pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee listen to it is it well with thy husband is it well with thy child and she answered it as well now i want us to pause there for a minute just to catch this so elisha we don't know when he passed by that house but he is conscious that is the woman it's the husband it's a child and he wants to know all as well but i want us to also notice that this woman's response to jihadi the sylvan because it wasn't elijah asking her the question it was jahazi asking another question and when he asked her the question she said it is well and i want you to catch this teaching here and and i'll get to it because i need to reach the next part to reverse back to this right and when she came to the man of god to the hill she caught him by the feet but jehazi came near to trust her away and the man of god said leave her alone for her soulless vexed within her and the lord had hid it from me and hath not told me so to this point now elisha has no idea what is going on i want to say catch kajal but abram stressed this as well that god would hold certain things those things revealed belong to us but here it is he lies with the prophet himself you don't know what's going on then she said did i desire a son of my lord in other words did i ask my son hallelujah did i ask for sun from my lord did i not say don't give me false hope do not deceive me now i want us to notice now for the first time we see a difference in her narrative when her husband asks at the questions he said it shall be well when jahazi asked her he said she said it is well in other words she refused to communicate her situation to people who couldn't help her i think i want to say that one more time she refused to communicate her problems to people who could not help her stop talking to people who cannot help you can i say that one more time stop talking to people who cannot help you when her husband asks her what going on it shall be well in other words you can't help me you can't help my son i put my son in the best place i could put him in the hands of that bed where the man of god was i need to get to the man of god it shall be well don't worry about it because you can't help me jahazi as as honest and blessing are you trying to be trying to be a good servant to the prophet he asking good deacon good help protecting the man of god all is well you say yeah all is well soon she come in contact with the man of god she has to say no it is well enough because she came into an encounter with the man of god she came into an encounter with somebody who she believed had access to do something about her situation she came into contact with the source of the prophecy she came into contact from the conversation and started it all i wanted to catch that but i want to stress again stop having conversations with people who cannot advance your spiritual work cannot advance your financial work cannot advance your goals in life how things with your business it is well you cannot get advice from people who don't know where to carry you know so either poor not your whole stress your whole problem to them and they cannot help you but when they can come in contact with a supernatural or somebody who can then you could be honest with them then he could open up to them can the church say amen she said did i desire son of my lord did i not say do not deceive me and this is where brother branham say no the prophet so the profit now is under pressure the profit is under some pressure the prophet doesn't know what to do but ivana made it very very clear i have a quote i'll see if we get it tonight depending on your time so the prophet now is beginning to marshall he said then he said to jahazi get up thy loins take my staff in nine hands and go that way if they'll meet any man salute him not in other words stay focused somebody wave here doorway back and if any salute me answer him not again and lay my stuff upon the face of the child and the mother of the child said as the lord live it so she is here in this conversation see she is seeing jahazi leaving with his staff heading down the road to go and character lay elijah's stuff staff upon her son and that is not enough for her she is here you can send your zero but as the lord live it and as that soul of it i will not leave me he said until my son is restored to me prophet elijah you will have to live with me next to you every day because i am moving until i get a confirmation until i get a selfie until i get a picture until i see for myself that my boy's alive you have me to deal with but a random preaches and perseverance so he brought a type that this tsunami woman was also a class act on perseverance he said i am not accepting this situation i don't care what you do i don't care how much we have i am not accepting this situation there has to be a transformation there must be achieved there must be a turnaround and listen and and you can see value in why she's operating that way because we don't know what lesson god is also teaching his prophet we are seeing we are focusing here on the shuna might but he prophet himself is going through his own experience because he sends jahazi to deal with the situation and uh let me get back as a verse 30 as the lord live it and as i so live it i will not leave thee and he arose and he followed her and verse 31 and jahazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing so in other words when jahazi finished with his staff this boy didn't come back to life wherefore he went again to meet him and told him in other words jazzy come back to elijah and saying the child is not awakened now one thing i have to take note of here is jay has here come back and say the child is still dead i want us to understand that when you enter spiritual things and spiritual experiences and spiritual situations and spiritual examples and that the language of it this year is still so it was it's still positive it is not the child you know i went and put his staff and he tried to say that no the child is not yet awakened in other words there's an expectation of waking up this didn't do it i don't know what next to do but the child i wake up yet and when elisha was come into the house so elijah now realize that he himself have to come he couldn't send jahazi because when jahazi went with his staff that didn't work so elisha comes into the house and behold for the first time he had now the child was dead and laid upon his bed and he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twin and prayed unto the lord so i want us to see now the value the importance we talk about prayer we talk about prayer meetings we talk about your consequences we talk about your life because and i want us to step into elisha's shoes for a minute here is a prophet here is the seed of prophecy the prophecy the seed of it the fruit of it is laying there he said jahazi that didn't work so the prophet himself have to see god i want us to catch us now right so he is praying and i would bring back holy prophet presented it as well and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and he stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed warm then he returned in other words he returned i guess some theologian will say no it was out of out of that room back probably into the house downstairs in other words he gave us space then he returned and walked in the house once back and forth went up again amplified he said went up again so as if he was up there any room with the boy he prayed he laid on the boy the boy a little warm he's not up yet he leaves the room close the room comes back downstairs so i want us to see something building now so he's staffed with jahazi elijah goes into the room lays his butt he prays he comes back downstairs and he pieces the floor no theologians don't know what that is but the prophet how many appreciate the ministry of the prophet but iran said in the message then jesus came and called he said where elijah didn't have the answer and he said he didn't know what to do so remember he walked up and down the floor and just back and forth back and forth until the spirit come on him glory so here it is this is like brother branham said you know what i'm waiting on you know what i'm waiting on and then he is here so brother branham taped that piercing on the floor with elisha was waiting for the spirit to drop down hallelujah waiting for it waiting for the present waiting for the spirit but around said direct quote there's another quote let me see why this pulled up quickly in perseverance but if adam said she was positive and elijah didn't know what to do he just went into the room walk back and forth until listen here until the spirit of god the presence of god come you see it so i want to draw reference everybody with me tonight so now then he returned walked in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes and he called jahazi and said call this sunamite he's still calling her we shoulda might so he called her and when she was coming unto him he said take up dyson then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up a son and went out can the church say amen no you remember we're not done yet we're not done yet you remember i said that last week we were in six and seven and i was trying to go to eight but i can't go up to eight until i go back to four so i want us to catch now so we're going to eat second kings eight i want to get a different translations here good second kings eight verse one then speak elisha so now by second kings eight if you're taking the bible chronologically within the context of this and that is some you know let's take it within context for now so this is now after the lepers this is after all it is go on here now this is after uh open this boy eyes and all these times so we we reached on further now in elijah's ministry it would it would seem as if elisha's commitment to this family after this boy never left it because then speak elijah unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go thou and thine household answer journey wheresoever thou can sajun in other words take up your household and go wherever you can find a place to live for the lord had called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land for seven years so elisha imagine a relationship that god showed the prophet seven years of famine coming this is something that the prophet would hold to his heart i don't know who else he would have told how else would have expressed it if we shared it with how we declared it but here it was with this understanding he is he feels a level of obligation to go to this same woman and say hey oh god honey the lord show me this is like this is like this is this is this a secret discovery this is something that he takes response i want you to catch it imagine you live such a life that god will come to you to let you know how to protect yourself in this season clearly her hospitality i want you to catch this her hospitality and her care to the prophet had such an impact in his life that not only she got the reward of a son which was beyond her understanding and expectation but after the son died and is not restored to life elisha can't leave them alone he comes and says listen go and find some place to live for seven years not seven months not seven weeks seven years your call wherever you want to go i'm just telling you it's seven years of famine if you stay here you will die go out there find a place take you on your household leave your people leave your nice house the house with the roof with you with my whole room on top you have to leave that too leave everything and go because if you stay where you're at you're going to die and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of god and went with her household so journeyed in the land of the philistines for seven years so it's a woman from the tribe of isaka from the village of sunum finds herself for seven years in the land of the philistines while she is there in the land of the philistines during the period of famine people would have come and taken over her house people would have come taken over her lands people would have come and taken over her fields whatever was left of a property were people there who should not have been there this woman who had found favor in the eyes of the prophet i want you to see it now comes back home after seven years and i want you to see how much god takes interest in the affairs of your life after seven years she comes back to see her house only to find people living in it i want you to see the picture her property is covered by people she don't know and maybe she stood for a while saying this is my house this is my house why are you in my house but but but miss you wasn't here this place was empty nobody was here we look we knock we ask is yes we live in here you know what years been here no you come from nowhere and you're saying it's yours you know how people will be i plan that piece of thing there i do that you can say it's yours so this woman does the only thing that she could do because in her own strength she cannot take back her property i want you to catch this now i'll go in somewhere in her own strength she cannot reclaim her land in her own strength she can't get back what she had so she really need two things she needs the favor of the king and she need help from the army now i want to go back to second kings 4 to remind us that the first time that elisha spoke to this woman he said what can i do for this woman does she need a favor from the king does she need help from the army and she said no her response was i am among my people so the prophet and i said it i hinted it to you the prophet was speaking in his spiritual realm but the time was not yet for that request to even be needed or fulfilled but now she was no longer in her land she was coming from the land of the philistines she was no longer with her people her people was nowhere around so she needed the favor of the king and she needed the help of the army to get back what was hers i want us to catch that so let's keep reading second kings eight and verse three and it came to pass at the at the seven years end that a woman returned out of the land of the fellow signs and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land this was a woman who was a woman of influence and power and she didn't need help from anybody she was among her people but now she like anybody else have a need to cry for the help of the king for for what for two things a house and for her land house was something the king could give back land is something you need enforcement for everybody with me i wanted to see how the prophet having a casual conversation but he dropping prophecy over her that she didn't even know she would need it'll take seven years for it even need this and the king talked with jahazi so i want you to see it now all these years pass i don't know when last the king would have seen elisha it is very evident it's been quite some time because the bible says verse 4 and the king talked with jehoshi the servant of the man of god saying tell me i pray thee all the great things that elisha had done so not only is the king trying to get an understanding of what has transpired for years the bible says and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life so this now goes back more than seven years because this raising of the dead was more so in other words the king i hear from the plan of god for over seven years so it is news to the king that elisha actually raised this boy from the dead now if there was ever a situation in scripture where you have perfect timing i want you to go through scripture and find perfect timing if there was ever i wanted i want you to see this i wish i was standing up preaching this right and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body life that behold a woman whose son he actually started like crying to the king for a house so i say and you know there was this woman this tsunami woman who used to keep us in her house and the food was good and every time we passed she had this good food and she decided to build his house on top of the house and we stay and when he boy she had no child and we talked to her and we offered her this and the child grew up and when he tried dead but that wasn't the end of it she run to carmel i run to him i carried his stuff and then and as he is testifying this thing you see but look see there look over here the bible says cry and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body like that behold the woman whose son had restored it i cried to the king for a house and for a land and jihad he said my lord o king this is the woman and this is her son whom elisha restored to life perfect time in it and when the king asks the woman she told him in the amplified it says and when the king asks the woman let me find it here when the king actually she told him everything in other words she verified the testimony all right so the king listen now appointed unto her a certain officer and and in this one move here the king is fulfilling the request that was veiled as a mystery that was actually a prophecy oh lord help us the request that was veiled as a prophecy that was hidden as a mystery that she and maybe lies so we don't know but she didn't even understand and the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now oh my can we give the lord a hand a praise so this woman didn't even realize that and i'm trying to when you cannot think about it israeli is mind-boggling the prophet they're sitting on his bed what i can do for this woman and maybe maybe he he's seeing it but if i meant to come but she will lose her house she will lose her land she will need a favor of the king you know she will need she will need an army i'm gonna call her and see what she wants she say can i give you a fear of the king can i get you to talk to the car after the army maybe at least if you know them you'd never know how the relationship would turn out and there it was this woman not seeing that what she taught was permanent was temporary oh god help us that the comfort she loved of her house and her wealth was going to be stripped away sometime and what was seen as something she didn't need was something she actually needed because the prophet was not speaking from a simplistic natural perspective but he was speaking from our spiritual realm and she walked away but god still purpose in his heart to give her that thing even though she didn't understand she needed it and she had to have found such favor that god was willing to give us something more than that thing and give our son and that commitment to that son was so powerful that god was going to honor and keep that son even when he died that's not to come back to life and even while they're living the normal living god tap his prophet and say listen go talk to that woman tell her to move out now because i have to preserve her life and in the economy of god god's saying look how she's going to need the favor of the king look how she's going to need the army and god bring complete restoration i'm almost done my time is up i just want to read this from the prophet to close out here and it is a testimony of the prophet and it's kind of touched me and because it ties so much into this you're familiar with it but like scripture to slow down many times people don't slow down on these things so i'm going to end with this and then we're going to close them prayer tonight in a message god has a provided lamb preached on june 20th 1964. but abraham said he is the same yesterday today and forever one call tonight will bring him on the scene just the same as it did then how he remains the same and but the branham said here i remember one night coming from dallas texas it's been several years ago i was grounded at memphis and they put me up there in that famous hotel the airlines did peabody hotel and they told me they'd call me the next morning in time to catch the limousine to go back to the plane and i had slept good through the night got up the next morning had written some letters was going down to the post office to mail them i went out and started down the street and all of a sudden i felt something said stop and go back well you know how people get impressions and i thought well that's probably what it was maybe an impression went a little further and it kept saying again stop and go back when i got up in a corner there was a big irish cop out there on the corner and i was looking at fishing reels and things in the window and i might have stood a little too long and he might get suspicious i was trying to get one of those reels so i just turned around and started walking back and as i walked back faster faster and i passed right on by the hotel and went down towards the river way down i don't know guess i could find a place tonight i taught here's getting late do you believe being led of god but but random acting church and as i went down along i was getting late and i know that i had to hurry but something just kept saying go on go on and as i got almost too late to go back and catch my plane i thought well i must follow this leading and i happen to be singing this little song i just met up with you pentecostal people about they were gathered in the upper room and were praying in his name i'm baptized in the holy ghost and powerful silver scheme did you ever sing that song and i'm so glad i could say i'm one of them i was trying to repeat that over saying come my brother seek this blessing that will cleanse your heart from sin and as i went along down the street i looked and there was an old typical ann jemima leaning out over a little fence and a little colored house there a little whitewashed cabin like leaning out over the fence she had a mansion tile around her head and i just quit singing and started walking on i didn't know where i was going he just said keep just keep walking and so when i got pretty close to her i seen she was kind of smiling and i looked her over at her and turned my head and walked on she said good morning person now in the south passing means minister and i said good morning auntie i look back and i thought how did she know i was a person didn't have a bible or nothing i turned back i said how did you know i was a person she said i know you was coming and i said kind of strange to me and she said did you ever read in the bible about the sunnah might woman i said oh yes ma'am he said you know she was barren she couldn't have children i said yes ma'am i remember the story said she promised the lord that she was going to raise that baby to the lord of course and he said you know and said you know i was that kind of woman she said i couldn't have no children the husband and i and said i promised the lord if he'd give me a baby that i would raise it for him she said he gave me a baby i raised that boy the best i could to serve the lord he said but you know he got in the wrong company and got a disease in his body said the doctor man has done give him all the shots he can't give him and he's done went in his blood is four plus social disease syphilis so she said the part of his blood drops back to his heart his heart has got holes in it and said he's laying in there unconscious the doctor man was here two days ago and said he'll never wake up no more he is gone and said i just can't stand to see my baby die like that she says i prayed all night lord if you're gonna take him i want to hear him say he is saved you know i'll beat him again and i prayed and i prayed the prayer like about mentioned the sona might woman and i said i went to sleep and i dreamed the dream she said i said to the lord lord you gave me this baby and said i was like the shunammite woman but where is your prophet and said he looked come in here and i seen a man with a little hat sitting on the side of his head wearing that gray suit coming down the street and said that was about four o'clock this morning she said i've been standing here ever since oh my lord jesus he is still god he answers on both ends i said my name is branham i pray for the sick did you ever hear of my ministry she said no sir person branham i never did hear of you and she said won't you come in and when i opened the gate it had a little old fence there and the gate had a plow point hanging on it like back in arkansas it was just across the river from it anyhow so you know what that was so i pulled the gate and went in when i went in that home i've been in king's palaces three or four different kings the king of england king gustaf of sweden many places going in and praying with them and i've been in some of the finest homes i get in hollywood but i never was any more welcome than i was in in that one you hear what the prophet says he felt welcome in a little place just a plain little room two rooms a little kitchen on the back little bedroom here and a little old poster bed there was no pinups on the wall but there was a sign there said god bless our home i looked laying there a great big negro boy looked to be about 18 years old great strong healthy looking boy and he had the blanket in his hand and he was going uh almost ate in pain and i said what's the matter with him she said he thinks he's out in a dark sea lost and says he keeps saying he's lost out on the sea and can't find his way he thinks he's rowing a boat said he's been doing that for two or three days he said i can't just let him die like that said will you pray for him i said yes ma'am i got to talking about healing she wasn't interested in that head just now she was interested in that she wanted only to hear him see he was saved that's all he was interested in that he was saved and i said he is she walked over and took him by the head and pulled him back kissed him with the cheek and she said god bless mama's baby me standing there looking at that i thought yeah that's it no matter how much this grace he has brought to the family how far away he is no matter what trouble he is he is still mama's baby and i thought the bible said a mother can forget her suckling babe how can't forget you how much love there is your names are engraved on the palms of my hand she kissed him we knelt down i sat at the foot of the bed i put my hands upon his feet they were hot sticky i said auntie will you pray first and my friend i knowed she had talked to him before oh my my my mama that just that just speaks to my heart i don't know how that's so she started praying and brother branham said i know she had talked to him before the way she prayed the prophet knew she had a relationship with the lord does this touch you tonight or what a prayer she made to god then she said will you pray and i said yes ma'am i said heavenly father i'm at least an hour late for the plane you told me to come down here and just keep coming and i don't know whether this is where you wanted me or not but this is where i've stopped if you've sent me to pray for this boy so the prophet is praying now and about that time he said oh mama she said what does babies what does mama's baby want he said is getting light in the room remember he was in darkness all the time about five minutes he was sitting up on the bed hallelujah oh my my my my five minutes he's sitting up on the bed five minutes i rushed out went on down i thought well i can just only get a cab that's all and wait over a day or whenever i can get another plane just as i was
