[13:16] from time and space into Lord an eternal
[13:19] calling an eternal destination and
[13:22] eternal purpose lord it's so easy Lord
[13:25] to get caught up and blindsided by this
[13:29] natural world in which we live Lord and
[13:31] how the enemy has done so much to do
[13:34] Lord so many things to distract us to
[13:36] pull our tension away from what matters

[13:42] would Lord Shake ourselves and go beyond

[13:59] no better place to distress than in your
[14:02] presence tonight Lord there's no better
[14:05] place to have a conversation Lord after
[14:07] the issues of Life to Come Lord into
[14:11] your presence where you could give us

[14:15] word in due season Lord and as you have
[14:17] granted us the opportunity to be in each
[14:20] of these homes tonight father May the

[14:32] there's anyone sick in our midst father
[14:34] may you touch them from the crown of
[14:36] their heads so The Souls of their feet
[14:38] father may you bring healing even as the
[14:39] word Goes Forth Lord if there's anyone
[14:42] discouraged Lord down depressed whatever
[14:44] it might be we lord pray a special
[14:46] blessing upon them tonight if there's a

[14:55] encouragement father we are we are
[14:56] nothing Lord we are just microphones we
[14:58] are looking for you to speak so may you
[15:00] take me out of the way Lord It's a
[15:02] humbling experience to sit before your
[15:05] people to speak to your people Lord is
[15:07] not something we take for granted it's
[15:08] not something we take lightly Lord our
[15:11] only desire and our only Endeavor and
[15:13] purpose is to be a blessing to your
[15:15] people so we pray a special blessing
[15:17] upon every brother every sister may you
[15:19] bless our pastor his wife the ministry
[15:21] the officers of the church the Believers
[15:23] that are here any visitors who might be
[15:25] Lord in the meeting tonight anyone that
[15:27] might listen to the recording father may
[15:29] they Lord feel Lord the spiritual
[15:32] vibrations lord of the impact of your
[15:34] word and may the spirit of God follow
[15:37] the word and bring it to life and into a
[15:39] manifestation in the hearts of your
[15:40] people granted now we ask in the
[15:42] precious name of Jesus Christ amen and
[15:45] amen so certainly thank you all for
[15:47] being here tonight uh it's certainly
[15:51] appreciated if you are not here and I'm
[15:53] here by myself we'll have a different
[15:55] kind of a study so we appreciate uh
[15:58] everyone being here tonight to support
[16:00] and to take a little time from the
[16:02] schedule of life and work to spend some
[16:05] time with the word we know that the word
[16:07] is God the God is the word and as our
[16:09] Prophet taught us if you read the Bible
[16:11] and you don't see Jesus in every verse
[16:13] you need to go read it again so we are
[16:14] here to see Jesus we're not here to see
[16:16] man I encourage you as I always say
[16:19] don't take these Bible studies for
[16:21] granted don't take it lightly and I
[16:23] encourage you to pay attention don't
[16:25] treat it like he in news and and you're
[16:28] doing something and is there's something
[16:29] else that's going on but I believe that
[16:31] God call us for a purpose and I believe
[16:34] something could be said tonight that
[16:35] could have an impact on us tonight I
[16:38] encourage you as well if um you're not
[16:41] seeing someone here tonight send them a
[16:42] message tell them we're in Bible study
[16:45] and something is about to happen so we
[16:46] want to make sure that we get the
[16:49] benefits of it and that the effort you
[16:52] know in everything you do in life you
[16:54] reap the benefits based on what you put
[16:56] into it so you put you know 5% of your
[16:59] energy into your school workor and in
[17:01] school you're only going to get 5%
[17:02] results but if you put more effort into
[17:05] it so too you will reap the results and
[17:07] so it is in your spiritual journey the
[17:10] more you put into your spiritual journey
[17:12] is the greater the results that you
[17:14] going to get from it so I want to
[17:16] encourage you tonight those of you who
[17:18] have little ones sit them down let them
[17:21] join the study with us as well um I have
[17:24] come to the realization and I was saying
[17:26] it in a meeting just this week people do
[17:29] what they want to do you know when
[17:30] someone uh says they can't do this or
[17:32] can't do that that that's never the the
[17:34] the whole truth what it really means is
[17:37] that they are valuing certain things
[17:39] more than other things you know and this
[17:41] is not about me it's not about you it's
[17:43] about God and about God really
[17:47] understanding what you place your
[17:48] priority to so for those of who are here
[17:52] and you're at your post of Duty good to
[17:53] see you brother Clarence um good to see
[17:58] like to see Brothers with to the sword
[17:59] shop you know so I know the church has
[18:02] been praying for you and it's good to
[18:05] see that that that smile and now I feel
[18:07] like it now I feel like it I I want to
[18:10] switch from Bible study to to preach you
[18:12] know so but it's good to see you good to
[18:15] see all of you who are who are allowing
[18:17] us to see your face tonight as well so
[18:20] we we have a little thought tonight and
[18:21] I trust it'll be a blessing I I said to
[18:24] my wife when I came home and um I was
[18:27] say about over as well you know Bible
[18:28] studies are different it's not it's not
[18:30] like you're in church in this setting of
[18:33] church so it feels a bit different in
[18:35] how you could have S certain
[18:36] conversations and certain things you may
[18:38] not approach that way in the pulpit in a
[18:41] forum like this we could be a bit more
[18:43] expressive you know so normally going
[18:45] into the pulpit you wouldn't say I'm I'm
[18:47] tired and I'm wiped out and I had a
[18:49] frustrating day or it was overwhelming
[18:51] you know but in this in this setting
[18:54] where we somewhat somewhat more relaxed
[18:56] we could have a conversation around how
[18:58] overwhelming do we was and as I I came
[19:00] home this evening I said to my wife
[19:02] tonight will be a short one I don't I
[19:04] don't have the strength to go for too
[19:06] long um you know today felt like one of
[19:09] those days when you trying to keep up
[19:11] with the day the day moving faster than
[19:12] you can keep up you know and sometime
[19:14] that's how life is sometimes the pace of
[19:16] Life moving so fast you feel like you're
[19:17] in the treadmill and sometime you feel
[19:19] like you're going nowhere you know so
[19:21] but we thank God for his grace we thank
[19:23] God for preserving us we thank God for
[19:25] his word we thank God for the purpose we
[19:27] thank God that the message from found us
[19:29] we didn't find the message but Bram said
[19:31] the message would find itself in the
[19:32] hands of the predestinated so we
[19:33] consider ourselves a privileged people
[19:35] not by virtue of what we have achieved
[19:37] what we have learned what we have done
[19:39] but by the grace of almighty God so
[19:41] tonight I have a bit of a thought um we
[19:45] have preached around this topic we have
[19:47] had studies around this topic but I want
[19:49] to Horn in on it a little different um
[19:51] some years ago I preached a message for
[19:53] such a time as this and um I remember
[19:56] when I was preaching that message it
[19:57] really impacted me because I saw
[20:00] something and I had a subtext you know
[20:03] we should have killed all the amalekites
[20:05] because we traced where Amal pursued
[20:07] Israel and God would have told King Saul
[20:10] to kill the amalekites and then he let
[20:12] King agag you know kind of TI him up a
[20:15] little bit and then AAR come all the way
[20:17] down to hmon in the time of Esther and
[20:20] then uh during the Bible studies we
[20:22] would have done the queen who did not
[20:23] know her purpose where we kind of zoomed
[20:25] in on Queen Esther again and you know
[20:29] sometimes you could be in a position and
[20:30] you don't really understand the purpose
[20:32] of why you are there um but tonight I
[20:34] want to Horn in on morai so for a title
[20:37] tonight the legacy of
[20:40] morai you know the Book of Esther is
[20:43] interesting the the Book of Esther is
[20:46] named actually after the main character
[20:48] in the book um but the reality is we
[20:51] have to admit you know that if you study
[20:53] the life of Esther study the story of
[20:55] Esther Esther would not be Esther if it
[20:59] was not for morai and many times we see
[21:02] things and we see success we see
[21:04] achievement we see people go through
[21:06] struggles go through and was like Wow
[21:08] Esther made it and and and for such a
[21:11] time as this you know we preach M for
[21:12] such a time but those were not Esther's
[21:15] words the whole context of for such a
[21:17] time of this was really morai
[21:19] encouraging Esther to go beyond herself
[21:23] so I really want us to kind of dial in
[21:25] now on morai a bit from two perspectives
[21:28] one do you have a morai who is your
[21:32] morai because without morai we wouldn't
[21:35] have an Esther and on the other side of
[21:38] it can you be a morai so the legacy of
[21:42] morai is is two sides of it because what
[21:45] we find in the study of Queen Esther is
[21:47] this almost silent second character who
[21:51] is one could argue almost of as critical
[21:54] importance as Esther because he is
[21:57] almost the hidden guiding hand for
[21:59] Esther the mentor of Esther and we know
[22:01] the background and story of it but the
[22:03] reality is he's done looking for credit
[22:05] he's not looking for praise he's not
[22:07] looking to have a name on the wall and
[22:09] many of us whether in the natural or in
[22:11] the spiritual we're looking to be
[22:14] recognized we're looking to be
[22:16] acknowledged we're looking for someone
[22:18] to say you're doing a good job and for
[22:20] some reason that is not morai morai was
[22:24] never seeking attention he was never
[22:26] trying to be in the Forefront you know
[22:28] and I'm kind of getting ahead of myself
[22:30] because I just feel to have the
[22:31] conversation around it but the reality
[22:33] is it's important for us to understand
[22:36] how God uses things behind the scene
[22:39] right so so let's go into it and we'll
[22:41] see what the Lord will do have a few
[22:43] notes a few scriptures but just for our
[22:47] memory and for those who have studied it
[22:48] and maybe for those who have not looked
[22:50] at it the entire first chapter of
[22:53] Esther deals with this issue of the king
[22:56] of the day King a hus who is having a a
[23:00] big event a big party a big celebration
[23:03] as it were and the Bible goes at Great
[23:05] Lengths to describe you know white green
[23:07] and blue hangings fastened with cords of
[23:10] fine linen and purple to silver rings
[23:12] and pillars of marble and beds were of
[23:15] gold and silver upon a pavement of red
[23:17] and blue and white and black marble this
[23:19] is chapter 1 verse 6 verse 7 and they
[23:22] give them drink in vessels of gold and
[23:24] the vessels being diverse one from
[23:26] another so it just paints this picture
[23:28] of celebration I mean it speaks of no
[23:31] money being spared it speaks about this
[23:34] is the biggest celebration we have had
[23:35] and we're going all out and if you do it
[23:37] do it big go hard or go home however you
[23:39] want to describe it they are going in
[23:42] and at some point in time the king gets
[23:44] this bright idea on the seventh day uh
[23:49] verse 10 on the seventh day when the
[23:51] heart of the King was merry with wine he
[23:53] commanded meum bista harona bcta Baka
[23:59] Zeta and kakas the Seven
[24:01] Chamberlin the fact that he have to call
[24:04] Seven men to even do this task speaks of
[24:06] him having an understanding of what he
[24:08] was dealing with that served in the
[24:10] presence of hus the king and this was
[24:13] their mission seven men mission to bring
[24:15] vashti the queen before the king with
[24:18] the Crown Royal to show the people and
[24:20] the princes her beauty for she was fair
[24:23] to look on but verse 12 and I always
[24:26] remember brother Terry speaking about
[24:28] these but Terry is really really good at
[24:29] going but the queen vas refused to come
[24:33] at the king's commandment by his
[24:35] chamberlains therefore was the king very
[24:38] rough and his anger burned in him and
[24:40] this sort of plays out its history but
[24:43] is also now because these these men then
[24:46] King said to the wise men which knew the
[24:48] times for so was the king's manner to
[24:50] all that knew law and judgment he was
[24:52] always surrounding himself with men who
[24:54] could give him advice and thing and next
[24:56] onto him was Kash sha adata tashes all
[25:00] these big men the seven princes of the
[25:02] Persia and media which saw the king's
[25:05] face clearly the King was
[25:07] embarrassed clearly the king is feeling
[25:09] uncomfortable you are King you call your
[25:12] wife and your wife say I
[25:13] coming verse 15 what shall we do unto
[25:16] the queen Vash according to the law
[25:18] because she hath not performed the
[25:20] Commandment of the King by the
[25:23] chamberlains and mukan answered before
[25:26] the king and the princes vashi the queen
[25:28] had not done wrong to the king only but
[25:31] also to all the princes and to all the
[25:34] people that are in all the provinces of
[25:36] the king for this deed of the queen
[25:39] shall come abroad unto all women whether
[25:42] it's by Facebook Instagram WhatsApp so
[25:44] that they shall despise their husbands
[25:46] in their eyes when it shall be
[25:49] reported and the King Asus commanded
[25:53] vashi the queen to be brought in before
[25:55] him but she came not
[25:58] so it CES a situation where these men
[26:01] say if we don't deal with vashy all of
[26:02] us going home in trouble let's find a
[26:05] solution to this problem and we know the
[26:08] story vashi is put
[26:10] away and by chapter two it takes four
[26:14] years so for four years there's no queen
[26:17] as the king is trying to find the right
[26:19] Queen chapter two around verse five we
[26:24] see now the introduction of morai now in
[26:27] sh the palace there was a certain Jew I
[26:30] like when the Bible talks about a
[26:32] certain character it just identifies
[26:34] there a certain brother there's a
[26:35] certain there's a certain Jew whose name
[26:37] was Mori the son of Jer the son of
[26:41] shimel the son of Kish a benjamite so it
[26:46] it kind of paints a picture and and here
[26:48] you see in genealogy history background
[26:51] context and the subtle narrative that
[26:54] morai is actually related to King
[26:57] Saul so there are some subtle parallels
[26:59] here and it is almost as if God is
[27:02] giving a second opportunity to deal with
[27:04] the amalekites because one of Saul's
[27:06] greatest responsibilities was to deal
[27:08] with the amalekites and here is someone
[27:11] in the lineage of Saul is about to
[27:14] encounter an agagite which is a son of
[27:17] agag so so what Saul didn't deal with
[27:20] King agag we have morai who is a son of
[27:23] Saul coming to deal with hmon who is a
[27:26] son of King agag and it shows that one
[27:28] Spirits never die and two when God gives
[27:31] an instruction to finish something he
[27:33] means for it to be finished and if one
[27:36] generation don't finish it he coming
[27:37] back around for another generation to
[27:39] deal with it is it the same way the
[27:41] enemy who has been after God's people
[27:43] for every generation and every age that
[27:46] couldn't handle it is coming out to this
[27:47] bride age for a bride to give you final
[27:49] knockout punch so what the devil thought
[27:51] he got away in the first age in the
[27:53] second age and the third age and all
[27:54] these ages now we coming to a round of
[27:56] it here right so we are getting a
[27:59] background of morai verse six who had
[28:01] been carried away from Jerusalem with
[28:04] the Captivity which had been carried
[28:06] away with jeconiah king of Judah whom
[28:09] Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had
[28:11] carried away so here we have a man just
[28:14] like we discussed with the Hebrew Boys
[28:16] in our last meeting two weeks ago he is
[28:18] here against his will he didn't ask to
[28:20] be here he didn't volunteer to be here
[28:22] he was forcibly placed into a into a
[28:25] country among a people he had no choice
[28:28] but yet still he have a testimony he
[28:31] have a stand he have a position and
[28:32] nothing is going to shake that verse S
[28:35] and he brought up hadassa that is Esther
[28:38] his uncle's daughter so it's not his
[28:40] daughter this is this is his uncle's
[28:41] daughter which means it's his cousin
[28:43] right for she had neither father nor
[28:46] mother an orphan and the maid was fair
[28:48] and beautiful whom Mori when her father
[28:50] and mother were dead took for his own
[28:53] daughter so it came to pass when the
[28:55] king's commandment and his decree Was
[28:57] Heard and when many maidens were
[28:58] gathered together unto shushan the
[29:00] palace to the custody of hegi that
[29:03] Esther was brought unto the King's house
[29:05] to the custody of higi Keeper of the
[29:07] woman and I want to just draw to verse
[29:10] 11 and morai walked every day before the
[29:14] court of the woman's house to know how
[29:17] Esther did and what should become of her
[29:20] so we see an interesting character
[29:22] here's a here is a man who who who who I
[29:25] I want to paint it Esther being an
[29:27] orphan morai didn't have to take her in
[29:31] it was his choice and it was clear that
[29:34] he had an interest in making sure that
[29:37] she got the support the care the the
[29:40] attention and even when she was in the
[29:43] king's place for Preparation every day
[29:46] he there how is how is she going how is
[29:47] she
[29:50] going what kind of man this morai is so
[29:54] mori's Story begins not in power or
[29:59] prominence because he begins as an
[30:02] exile a Jew living in shusa the capital
[30:06] of the Persian Empire displaced from his
[30:09] homeland though living in a foreign land
[30:12] under Pagan rule mori's life his
[30:16] approach displays something truly unique
[30:20] we would know for those who have study
[30:22] the story of morai and it's actually
[30:24] captured in that same chapter 2 when he
[30:28] overheard in verse 21 in those days
[30:31] while morai sat in the king's gate now
[30:34] the king's gate is not literally a gate
[30:36] we talking about here it's it's a place
[30:39] of politics it's a place of influence it
[30:42] like lot who sat at the Gate of the city
[30:44] it was Commerce it was tray so here it
[30:47] is he is an exile but he's in a place
[30:50] where he could overhear certain kind of
[30:52] kinds of conversations all
[30:54] right two of the king's chamberlains big
[30:57] th and terish of those who kept the door
[30:59] were rought and sought to lay hands on
[31:01] the king so there's an assassination
[31:03] attempt so because and and I want us to
[31:06] understand this and we're building to
[31:07] something your job your street your
[31:11] background your family is not by
[31:14] accident Mori is at his place of work he
[31:18] is at his job and he's not there by
[31:20] chance behind the scene God is
[31:23] orchestrating every single piece of a of
[31:26] a narrative of a story of a purpose that
[31:29] Mori at the time doesn't even understand
[31:33] and what is interesting Mori reports
[31:35] this to
[31:37] Esther Esther would advise an action
[31:40] would be taken but the Bible says and
[31:41] the thing was known to Mori who told it
[31:44] unto Esther the queen and Esther
[31:46] certified the king thereof in mori's
[31:48] name so Esther is in a place that morai
[31:52] can't
[31:53] access morai is hearing things that
[31:55] Esther can't hear but because because
[31:58] there's a connection between them
[31:59] they're able to have an influence on the
[32:00] king everybody with me so I want us to
[32:03] understand that no matter where you are
[32:05] in life there's a purpose for you being
[32:08] where you are in life at that particular
[32:10] point in time I trust this is helping
[32:13] someone this
[32:17] evening so just like Joseph is in Egypt
[32:20] sold into slavery and Daniel is in
[32:22] Babylon we have this character morai who
[32:25] has a critical role to play because as
[32:28] much as Esther is the main character
[32:31] Esther will have her struggles Esther
[32:33] will have her doubts Esther will not
[32:36] know how to approach certain things
[32:38] because the Bible says in chapter 2:1
[32:41] Esther had not shown her people nor her
[32:43] Kindred in other words Esther didn't
[32:45] tell them what she was she didn't tell
[32:47] them she was the Drew and why was it so
[32:49] for morai had charged her that she
[32:52] should not show it so in other words
[32:55] Esther was operating under guidance
[32:58] if Mori was not there and Esther had
[33:01] just gone her own way what how different
[33:04] the story would have been if there was
[33:05] no morai in Esther's life so I want to
[33:08] underscore again who is the morai in
[33:11] your life who is giving you the advice
[33:13] who are you taking advice from because
[33:15] if Esther had taken bad advice she would
[33:18] have end up in a different
[33:20] place and one of the biggest challenges
[33:23] with us is we take advice from the wrong
[33:26] people
[33:28] and if you don't know you lack the
[33:30] wisdom and understanding to
[33:31] differentiate at times good advice from
[33:34] bad advice because if you don't know you
[33:36] just don't know so it is critical for us
[33:39] to understand who the people of
[33:42] influence because that's what morai was
[33:44] to eser he was a person of influence who
[33:47] is influencing us who is guiding how you
[33:51] move on your job in your marriage
[33:53] amongst your family in your business
[33:55] Affairs in your conversations in your
[33:58] interactions because the Bible speaks
[34:00] about the wisdom of and the safety of
[34:02] counsel and good advice many of us if we
[34:05] reflect in our lives we'll see half of
[34:07] the trouble we got into is because we
[34:09] went into things without good
[34:12] advice so the legacy of morai is
[34:15] actually a legacy of getting good advice
[34:19] the advice that comes from a genuine
[34:21] heart without any ulterior motive
[34:23] because what we see throughout The
[34:25] Narrative of morai is morai was never
[34:28] looking for anything in
[34:30] return in fact for those who know this
[34:33] story they forgot that morai reported
[34:36] the assassination attempt on the king it
[34:39] was only when the king couldn't sleep
[34:40] and he say well read the Chronicles to
[34:42] missaka tried to fall asleep when they
[34:44] had to read and in so and so day there
[34:46] was an assassination attempt and morai
[34:48] reported it and the King say well what
[34:50] was ever done for this man morai in
[34:52] other words morai sat day after day week
[34:56] after week month after month he I walk
[34:58] around saying well you know they never
[34:59] reward me you know they never give me a
[35:01] medal you know they never give me a
[35:03] thank you email you know if if it wasn't
[35:06] for me the king would have be dead and
[35:08] they even they even put up a sign for
[35:11] me this is why I said at the beginning
[35:14] how many of us could do the right
[35:16] thing without the need for
[35:19] acknowledgement can I say that
[35:22] again it sounds as if it's a contrarian
[35:27] concept because human nature suggests
[35:30] that there should be a reward and a
[35:32] recognition for doing the right thing I
[35:35] think I want to dig into that a little
[35:37] bit we have become such a society of
[35:41] entitlement and of trade and of tit
[35:44] fortat and that that it's almost as if
[35:46] you have to incentivize people to do the
[35:49] right thing where are the people who
[35:50] could do the right thing without the
[35:52] consideration of a
[35:55] reward where are the people who will do
[35:57] the right thing if you don't know if
[35:58] there's a blessing in store for it
[36:01] because you're doing the right thing
[36:02] because the right thing is what you're
[36:04] supposed to do Mori did the right thing
[36:08] and he it would seem he was never
[36:10] rewarded but I want to assure you
[36:12] tonight everything you do for the Lord
[36:14] there's a reward in there but you can't
[36:17] tell God how to do it you cannot tell
[36:19] God when to do it but in due season when
[36:22] it really matters God will do it can
[36:25] somebody say Amen
[36:28] so morai being where he was was not
[36:31] accidental you being where you are is
[36:34] not accidental the experiences in your
[36:36] life is not accidental the school you
[36:39] went to is not
[36:44] accidental everybody feeling
[36:46] fine let's
[36:49] go mori's
[36:51] role as Esther's guardian and Mentor is
[36:56] critical to the unfolding of This Book
[36:58] of
[36:59] Esther I want us to understand that when
[37:02] Esther's parents died Esther could have
[37:05] been left vulnerable we don't spend time
[37:07] talking about this we talk about the
[37:09] parts with if I perish I perish and Es
[37:12] being prep but I do not want us to for
[37:15] one second place or take lightly the
[37:19] role that morai played this speaks to us
[37:21] as parents it speak to us as Guardians
[37:24] and it's challenging us to go beyond our
[37:26] family Circle
[37:28] because Esther is not mori's daughter he
[37:30] take her as a
[37:32] daughter so he is making a real choice
[37:35] now listen parents don't have a choice
[37:37] you're supposed to love your children
[37:38] you don't already have a
[37:40] choice but morai had a choice because
[37:43] it's not his
[37:45] child so he is choosing love over the
[37:49] love being something that is expected I
[37:51] want us to understand the subtle
[37:53] difference
[37:54] there Esther could have been left
[37:56] vulnerable
[37:58] forgotten but Mori steps in adopting her
[38:02] as his own daughter what's the word
[38:04] adoption there his care his wisdom his
[38:08] guidance not just in the natural but in
[38:10] the spiritual shapes Esther into a
[38:14] courageous leader that God could use to
[38:16] deliver his
[38:19] people this aspect of morai highlights
[38:23] the power of sacrificial love because
[38:26] Mori would have had to make decision
[38:27] because there's a young girl in his
[38:29] house you can't move a certain way you
[38:32] can't operate a certain way these are
[38:34] the impact of life decisions just as the
[38:37] decision to be a Christian to live a
[38:40] certain way their sacrifices we make
[38:42] their choices we make their decisions we
[38:43] make but I want to underscore that for
[38:47] morai it was a choice and every one of
[38:50] us have a choice
[38:52] tonight everybody feeling fine
[38:59] in a
[39:00] situation where Esther is an exile
[39:04] morai would have brought a level of
[39:07] structure and peace to Esther in an
[39:10] uncertain
[39:12] environment giving her what could be
[39:14] described as a home and a sense of
[39:16] belonging and it's very evident that
[39:19] this was real when you read the
[39:21] scripture and morai walked every day
[39:23] before the court to know how Esther did
[39:27] and what should become of her what going
[39:29] on with the girl she she okay she eating
[39:31] good everything all right I just
[39:33] checking everybody feeling
[39:37] fine mori's influence is also
[39:41] evident in Esther's
[39:46] obedience maybe years later the Lord Tes
[39:48] we hear this but my wife told my
[39:50] daughter don't touch the ice
[39:54] cream but
[39:56] over today Isabelle found a way to put a
[39:59] chair and something else and reach the
[40:02] top of the fridge open the thing get
[40:05] into the ice cream take it out seal it
[40:08] back as if never did Sin there was no
[40:11] evidence around the fridge that the ACT
[40:13] took place the evidence was found when
[40:15] the cup was found at the side of the bed
[40:18] if it had not been for that there would
[40:20] have been no evidence
[40:23] today so I'm making a point that the
[40:26] shaping and influence has to reach a
[40:28] point where it reaches a level of
[40:32] obedience Esther say Mor tell them I
[40:35] telling them I telling them I'm a
[40:39] Jew I is my own
[40:43] woman you understand how many of us
[40:46] overstep under step so clearly something
[40:49] because there is no point in The
[40:51] Narrative of Esther where we ever see
[40:53] Esther not obeying
[40:55] morai go to the scripture 10 chapters in
[40:59] The Book of
[41:00] Esther even when Esther is reluctant
[41:02] even when Esther is uncertain even when
[41:03] Esther in a state of what and and even
[41:06] when Mo when Mori say how do you not
[41:08] know for such a time as this you are
[41:09] raised up did Esther
[41:12] follows that is the impact of a
[41:14] relationship of trust and even for us as
[41:17] parents as Leaders as managers because
[41:20] at the end of the and I've said it many
[41:22] times God expects more from us as
[41:24] Believers you know you are royalty you
[41:27] are Prince on the earth you are leader
[41:29] on the earth so it is expected that your
[41:31] operation come across a certain way this
[41:34] has nothing to do with your educational
[41:36] level it hases nothing to do with what
[41:37] school you went to the fact is you are
[41:39] born into a
[41:41] family your father own
[41:45] everything and you have by virtue of
[41:48] birth and being part of this mystical
[41:51] body you have Divine access into what
[41:53] others cannot access there is an
[41:55] expectation that comes with that there's
[41:57] a a way to behave that comes with that
[41:59] there's a way you approach language and
[42:01] your conduct and your behavior that's
[42:03] because of that you cannot do what you
[42:05] want because you're part of a royal
[42:07] family we have referenced the UK the
[42:10] British family because you can't just
[42:11] get up and do what you
[42:13] want one time they interviewed President
[42:16] Obama and he said well he can't drive
[42:18] one one of the things he misses he can't
[42:19] just drive on the road anymore because
[42:22] as the president the Secret Service
[42:23] controls where you going how you drive
[42:26] because your safety is their
[42:28] responsibility and he spoke of a
[42:30] situation where there was a car that
[42:31] came on the White House ground and he
[42:33] wanted to drive the car so bad and he
[42:35] step into it and he make a little turn
[42:36] before he go so far the secret block him
[42:38] he can't go he can't go beyond a certain
[42:40] and he's the president but because of
[42:42] his role he cannot do what he wants to
[42:45] do anybody with me so obedience that I'm
[42:48] talking about here is not just about
[42:50] well I obeying our being it is also a
[42:52] recognition that as a Son of God as a
[42:54] daughter of God you can't do what you
[42:58] want to
[42:59] do because there's an expectation of how
[43:02] you live how you dress how you speak it
[43:05] is hard because some you want to fly out
[43:07] the handle find me somebody who don't
[43:09] want to fly out the
[43:11] handle but as your character becomes
[43:13] shaped you learn to begin to control
[43:16] your tongue Mark the perfect man the man
[43:19] who could Bridle his
[43:22] tongue and a bridal a bridal is a
[43:25] serious thing you know
[43:28] it's not just control it's Bridal is
[43:30] bring it under subjection and a bridal
[43:32] mean using an external device almost as
[43:35] way you know it's like putting on
[43:37] blinders you
[43:38] know can you church say amen I hope this
[43:41] is helping us in some way
[43:43] right so modi's influence and I really
[43:48] what what we holding in tonight I'm not
[43:50] going to be too long is about who is
[43:52] influencing you and what kind of
[43:54] influence are you on others because we
[43:56] said the beginning we're looking at
[43:58] modai from two perspectives who is your
[44:01] modai your person who's influencing you
[44:05] and who are you
[44:08] influencing because I don't want it to
[44:10] be selfish to be always the one on the
[44:13] receiving end well I looking for
[44:14] somebody to influence me positively but
[44:17] at the same time God put you somewhere
[44:19] to have a positive
[44:23] impact and it may be in your circle of
[44:26] your family it could be beyond that and
[44:28] God help us we want to be beyond that
[44:30] can the church say
[44:33] Amen Mori taught Esther wisdom Mori
[44:38] advised Esther to conceal her Jewish
[44:40] identity until the right time this was
[44:42] not an act of fear it was wisdom at
[44:46] work because wisdom allowed Esther to
[44:49] become
[44:50] Queen can the church say Amen this
[44:53] decision was not about compromise but
[44:55] call it strategic with
[45:03] wisdom can we go
[45:12] on mori's wisdom and we finally speaking
[45:15] a lot about wisdom here and I did a
[45:17] bible study on
[45:19] wisdom is especially
[45:23] evident in how he advises
[45:27] in dealing with the
[45:34] palace he recognized the potential
[45:37] dangers of revealing her identity too
[45:39] early and he understood the importance
[45:42] of
[45:43] timing even Jesus in Mark instructed his
[45:48] disciples to keep his identity a secret
[45:50] he said tell no
[45:52] one now this is disciples so Jesus
[45:54] telling disciple tell no one and brother
[45:57] so and so feeling inspired he feeling a
[46:00] something just tell him to tell to tell
[46:03] somebody you understand why discipleship
[46:06] and training is so important because
[46:09] discipleship speaks about being a
[46:11] disciplined
[46:12] Warner he charged them to tell no
[46:15] one in fact and I've preached this many
[46:18] times up until the time of Lazarus the
[46:20] word was always tell no one tell no one
[46:22] tell no one and Jesus have them at his
[46:25] side somewhere tell no man tell no man
[46:27] tell no man is when Lazarus raised from
[46:29] the dead that's when it just they
[46:31] couldn't Contin it
[46:36] anymore everybody feeling
[46:40] fine throughout
[46:43] scripture and this is where again we're
[46:45] looking at scriptural
[46:47] wisdom now this is not you hiding your
[46:51] testimony to get away with
[46:55] foolishness this is not well well no
[46:58] brother Isaac say well don't really tell
[46:59] them I'm a Christian I'm I'm a
[47:00] undercover Christian that is not what we
[47:02] teaching tonight what we teaching is
[47:04] wisdom so I don't want know why you know
[47:06] I'm I'm a Believer so I just want to
[47:09] because Esther didn't tell them at first
[47:12] and no no no that's not what we talking
[47:13] about tonight I want us to be clear on
[47:16] what we addressing we we we're trying to
[47:18] get into an understanding of of
[47:21] wisdom which goes beyond knowledge it
[47:24] goes beyond information to have the mind
[47:27] of Christ the intelligence to know what
[47:30] God wants done with the word the
[47:32] understanding that that it takes wisdom
[47:34] to navigate the Bible say be gentle as a
[47:37] dove but be wise as a serpent that's
[47:39] scripture you need to be wise in your
[47:41] Affairs you cannot be making foolish
[47:44] decisions there's a book written called
[47:47] you Road Less stupid it's a business
[47:50] book The Road Less stupid and the
[47:53] premise of it is most people make
[47:56] relatively good decision the problem is
[47:58] we make too many stupid
[48:00] decisions and if we eliminate these
[48:03] stupid decisions you will actually end
[48:05] up in a better position than most
[48:09] things and what that simply mean is if
[48:12] you apply spiritual wisdom Godly wisdom
[48:15] in your Affairs you know how much
[48:17] problems you'll avoid that's a lesson to
[48:20] all of us that's me that's you that's
[48:21] everybody can the Church Say Amen
[48:28] Moses mother hid him for three months to
[48:30] protect him from
[48:32] Pharaoh Rahab hid the SP imagine if
[48:34] Rahab C Des spis right here our Bible be
[48:37] totally different you
[48:41] know all
[48:45] right wisdom requires
[48:48] patience let's go so the narrative goes
[48:51] on so by the time we reach Exodus
[48:53] chapter 3 the Bible said esus chap 3:1
[48:56] after these things did King aerus
[49:00] promote hmon the son of hamata the
[49:03] agagite agagite from the line of agar so
[49:06] he's an not just an amalekite but of the
[49:09] line of King agar who should have been
[49:11] dead in fact he shouldn't have been born
[49:13] if King sa had done his job all right
[49:16] did he promote hmon the son of hamata
[49:19] the agagite and Advance him and set his
[49:22] seat above all the princes that were
[49:24] with him in other words hmon is now the
[49:26] king's right right hand
[49:28] man and all the king's servants that
[49:31] were in the king's gate that is like
[49:33] almost like a parliament is almost like
[49:35] a is a political arena in the king's
[49:37] gate bowed and reverence himon for the
[49:40] king had so commanded him but Mori bowed
[49:44] not nor did him
[49:51] reverence then the king's servants which
[49:53] were in the king's Gates said unto Mori
[49:55] why transgressed thou the king's
[49:59] commandment now it came to pass when
[50:01] they spake daily unto him and he hacked
[50:04] not unto them that they told him and to
[50:07] see whether morai matters would stand
[50:09] for he had told them that he was a Jew
[50:12] so I want us to see that morai is one he
[50:16] knows where he stand two he's
[50:18] comfortable with his identity he is not
[50:21] compromising his fate he not taking the
[50:23] undercover route as Esther because that
[50:25] is strategic wisdom but in the public
[50:27] light in his office in his job he said
[50:30] tell the reason I about it is very clear
[50:31] I'm a Jew it is my conviction is my
[50:34] belief that's why I'm I'm in this
[50:36] position verse five and when hymon saw
[50:39] that morai bowed not nor did him
[50:41] reverence then was hmon full of
[50:45] Wrath and he thought scorn to lay hands
[50:48] on morai alone I want us to catch this
[50:50] in other words he said this thing is so
[50:52] such an affront that is a it's not good
[50:55] enough for me to just punish
[50:57] morai alone he felt so
[51:00] offended he thought it scorned to lay
[51:02] hands on Mori alone for they had shown
[51:04] him the people of morai wherefore hmon
[51:08] sought to destroy all the Jews that were
[51:10] throughout the whole Kingdom of aestus
[51:13] even the people of
[51:18] Mori now it's up until this time we see
[51:22] morai as the guide the mentor the other
[51:26] figure the advisor to
[51:30] Esther he heard about the attempt on the
[51:32] king he reports it so far it's almost
[51:35] like okay there's nothing you might deem
[51:38] controversial if you could use that word
[51:39] around him but this stand that morai
[51:42] takes is the defining moment of his
[51:46] character this act of conviction was a
[51:50] profound Declaration of his
[51:52] feet and mori's courage has an impact
[51:56] not just on him but on all of the people
[51:59] so when we look at the Book of Esther it
[52:01] is modi's action as one person that
[52:03] actually put all of the Jews at Jeopardy
[52:07] I want us to understand the significance
[52:08] of the
[52:11] role mori's refusal as rooted in his
[52:14] faith and his loyalty to God's
[52:19] Commandments and no
[52:21] doubt Mori would have understood what it
[52:24] meant when he say I'm a Jew because as
[52:26] he hon was an agagite and he was a son
[52:28] of Saul he would have been sharp on the
[52:32] word as it were and morai being a
[52:35] Statesman would have been aware of the
[52:38] consequences of his
[52:40] actions Mori refused that to Bow made
[52:44] him a
[52:47] Target his choice brought danger not
[52:49] only to himself but to all the
[52:52] Jews and his refusal sets him apart
[52:59] and it's a pattern of Can You Stand now
[53:02] we would have addressed this in our last
[53:04] Bible study with the Hebrew boys who
[53:05] they had a choice Mori had a choice he
[53:08] could to say well you know what let me
[53:09] just go with the flow but as Believers
[53:11] we are often confronted with situations
[53:14] where you have to take a stand what I
[53:16] want to draw attention to particularly
[53:17] for the young people it's every day they
[53:19] were trying to convince him to change
[53:21] his
[53:22] manner is daily they hacker onto and and
[53:26] daily they spake un him and he hacken
[53:28] not unto them so I want us to understand
[53:30] that when the world trying to bend you
[53:32] or twist you is not going to be one time
[53:34] they come at you it's going to be over
[53:36] and over again
[53:40] right now the moment that hmon adjust
[53:45] his position and see going after the
[53:46] Jews as we know he went to the king and
[53:50] said there are certain people scattered
[53:51] abroad this is verse 8 in all the
[53:54] provinces of thy kingdom and their laws
[53:55] are diverse ver from all people neither
[53:57] keep they the king's law devid is not
[54:00] for the king's profet to suffer them if
[54:02] it please the king Let It Be written
[54:04] that they may be destroyed and I will
[54:05] pay 10,000 Talons of silver to the hands
[54:07] of those that have the charge of the
[54:09] business to bring it to the king's
[54:11] Treasury and the King acts on this now
[54:15] what I
[54:16] admire about morai is the beginning of
[54:20] chapter 4 when Mori perceived all that
[54:24] was done Mori rent his clothes put on
[54:29] saot with ashes and went out into the
[54:32] midst of the city and cried with a loud
[54:35] and a bitter Cry came even before the
[54:38] king's gate for none might enter into
[54:40] the king's gate clothed with
[54:42] sackl and in every Province whether
[54:46] soever the king's commandment and his
[54:47] decree came there was a great
[54:49] M among the Jews and fasting and weeping
[54:52] and wailing and many laying
[54:54] sackcloth and Ashes is he went straight
[54:58] into morning he went straight into
[55:00] prayer he went straight into trying to
[55:02] seek what God wanted to achieve about
[55:06] this his immediate reaction is one of
[55:09] grief but he also quickly transitions
[55:14] into a
[55:16] role of guidance in the
[55:18] situation because Esther's maid the
[55:21] Bible said and a chamberlains came and
[55:23] told it to her and she sent cloth know
[55:26] we know toori to take away sacot so we
[55:30] would have addressed it with Esther that
[55:31] she didn't know what was going on
[55:32] because she's in the comfort of the
[55:35] palace and the
[55:37] moment that she gets word of what Mori
[55:40] would have done morai now begins to get
[55:44] involved in having a
[55:46] conversation by Esther 4:3 morai
[55:50] commanded to answer Esther think not
[55:52] with thyself that thou shall Escape in
[55:54] the King's house more than all the Jews
[55:57] for if altogether
[56:00] holdest thy peace at this time then
[56:03] shall there enlargement and deliverance
[56:06] arise to the Jews from another place but
[56:09] thou and thy father's house shall be
[56:11] destroyed and who knoweth whether thou
[56:13] had come to the kingdom for such a time
[56:15] as this and this may be one of the most
[56:18] critical pieces of mori's testimony in
[56:20] the Book of Esther but I like this from
[56:23] two perspectives one modai is saying God
[56:26] will deliver
[56:29] us he said if you hold your peace then
[56:33] there shall arise enlargement and
[56:36] deliverance from another place in other
[56:38] words God is going to solve
[56:40] it I'm not worried about God's
[56:43] Deliverance I'm not worried about God
[56:46] changing the situation around Mori was a
[56:49] man of Faith Mori was a man who was
[56:51] fixed and Resolute in his confidence
[56:54] just like the Hebrew voice our God is
[56:55] going to Deliver Us I want us to see a
[56:58] recurring pattern because if we
[57:00] understand the pattern and we can fall
[57:02] into the same pattern the Hebrew boy
[57:04] says our God will deliver and if he
[57:05] don't deliver we still not going to bow
[57:07] down here is Mori saying Deliverance is
[57:11] going to come but how do you not know
[57:13] that you are here for such a time as
[57:15] this isn't that such an encouragement to
[57:17] us all because friends crisis will come
[57:20] to our homes to our lives to our
[57:22] businesses and how do you not know that
[57:25] the situation you in his for specific
[57:27] purpose can the church say
[57:34] Amen despite his grief Mori begins to
[57:37] formulate a plan talking to Esther his
[57:40] famous words for such a time of as this
[57:45] recognizing Esther's rise to a queen was
[57:49] all part of God's
[57:53] plan Esther wasn't thinking it the
[57:56] thought of using as it were her position
[57:59] to be her influence was not Esther's
[58:03] idea Esther didn't suggest well let me
[58:06] go and see what I could do had it not
[58:09] been morai said Esther I want you to
[58:11] refrain your thinking because you think
[58:12] you're safe in there you didn't even
[58:14] know I was out here in all of this you
[58:16] even know all this going on but how do
[58:18] you not know that all of the work that
[58:20] took to bring in this place is for God
[58:21] to use you in your situation and I want
[58:24] to bring the question for you
[58:26] how do you not know the thing you might
[58:28] complain about the challenge you might
[58:30] be facing the family situation you're in
[58:32] how do you not know that God has
[58:34] orchestrated it for such a time as this
[58:37] for you to be a blessing when you don't
[58:39] even realize that God has positioned you
[58:41] to be a blessing I want to say that one
[58:42] more time how do you not know that the
[58:44] place you're in is to be a blessing but
[58:46] you there looking somewhere else or
[58:49] thinking you're not part of the story or
[58:51] thinking you don't have a role to play
[58:54] and here it is modai is saying you might
[58:56] think you are not a piece of the story
[58:58] here but how do you not know that you
[59:01] are the piece that God wants to use in
[59:03] this time can the church say
[59:07] Amen Mori in this scripture here is also
[59:11] warning Esther again the role of an
[59:13] influence your role of a guide the role
[59:15] of telling someone you think you're all
[59:17] right now but how do you not know and
[59:20] he's going beyond that to say don't
[59:22] assume that your position is going to
[59:25] protect you
[59:28] could I say that one more
[59:30] time don't assume that because you're in
[59:33] the palace you're safe don't assume
[59:36] because and I want to bring this now on
[59:37] a higher level the world is finished
[59:40] there's there's nothing else the economy
[59:42] the global economy every is
[59:44] finished we try to find comfort and
[59:47] safety in your savings your bank account
[59:49] whatever whatever is your safety net
[59:51] because Mori was saying you think you
[59:53] have a safety net because you're in the
[59:55] palace and because you're under the
[59:57] king's protection this wouldn't affect
[59:58] you but I'm telling you when they find
[1:00:00] out who you are you in trouble
[1:00:02] too anybody with me it might be obvious
[1:00:06] now but somebody going to tell them you
[1:00:08] also a Jew and the reality is when you
[1:00:11] look at the scripture the law of that
[1:00:13] edict that the king passed could not
[1:00:15] have been
[1:00:16] reversed throughout the story of Esther
[1:00:19] it it took a new law to overwrite what
[1:00:22] that was but that law was in place in
[1:00:24] those days when a king wrote a law he
[1:00:25] couldn't on write the
[1:00:27] law it took a new law that had to be
[1:00:30] written to deal with what that law could
[1:00:33] not
[1:00:34] cover thank God for a higher law because
[1:00:37] if it were not for a higher law we don't
[1:00:38] stand a
[1:00:40] chance because the law said that sin
[1:00:42] should lead to
[1:00:44] death but he went to a higher law and he
[1:00:47] paid the price and create a a legal
[1:00:49] loophole that he could be your judge and
[1:00:52] he could be your lawyer
[1:00:56] and he used the law to protect you can
[1:00:58] the church say
[1:00:59] Amen so I want us to understand what you
[1:01:02] might think is your safety could be a
[1:01:04] comfort that's a false
[1:01:07] Comfort anybody with me
[1:01:10] tonight so morai was telling us don't
[1:01:13] rely on your bank account you know don't
[1:01:15] rely on your business don't rely on
[1:01:18] where you're living don't rely on who
[1:01:20] you're related to don't rely on the fact
[1:01:22] you're living in the palace and I living
[1:01:23] on the outside don't rely on the fact
[1:01:25] that that you have food in say every day
[1:01:27] and men have to go and find for
[1:01:29] food because there's coming a time when
[1:01:32] who you are will be found out and
[1:01:34] because the law says Jews to die you are
[1:01:37] going to be on that list too it might
[1:01:39] come today it might come tomorrow but
[1:01:40] it's going to come how do you not know
[1:01:42] that God have you there for such a time
[1:01:44] as
[1:01:45] this there was a time for you to hide
[1:01:47] who you were but this is not that time
[1:01:49] oh come on now anybody with me when we
[1:01:52] started the journey I told you don't
[1:01:53] tell anybody who you are but for such a
[1:01:56] time as this this is the time to declare
[1:01:58] who side you're
[1:01:59] on this is the time to make it very
[1:02:02] clear who what line you're born into
[1:02:05] what your purpose is what your calling
[1:02:07] is anybody with
[1:02:11] me and the church say
[1:02:15] Amen morai warns Esther to not assume
[1:02:19] that her royal Position will shield her
[1:02:22] from the degree
[1:02:34] let's go
[1:02:36] on leadership in
[1:02:41] crisis morai didn't fall
[1:02:44] apart morai didn't throp his hand and
[1:02:46] say I don't know what to do in the midst
[1:02:49] of a crisis death is on the door
[1:02:52] judgment is on the door the law has
[1:02:54] already changed the Seas has already
[1:02:56] changed and morai is leveraging what he
[1:02:59] could
[1:03:00] leverage in the midst of Crisis friends
[1:03:03] you don't go to school to become a
[1:03:05] manager to manage when things are just
[1:03:07] good anybody could do that you see in
[1:03:09] crisis you see in Conflict you see when
[1:03:12] things go wrong that is what
[1:03:14] distinguishes somebody who is great from
[1:03:17] somebody who is good if you are captain
[1:03:19] of a ship and your ship never meet bad
[1:03:22] water are you ready a captain
[1:03:26] I'm not questioning your your captain
[1:03:28] captain C or whatever you want to use
[1:03:31] but a real Captain is one who could
[1:03:33] handle hey I went through two storms and
[1:03:36] I lose this and I lose that and I
[1:03:37] somehow are able to the kind of
[1:03:39] experience to go through some of these
[1:03:41] things really is is what make a season
[1:03:43] but he battle scar
[1:03:47] veterans it's time we own our scars as
[1:03:49] it were
[1:03:52] yes modi's leadership in the moment of
[1:03:55] of Crisis Reveals His Faith his Courage
[1:04:00] the ability to inspire we talk about
[1:04:03] morai and Sir this could be you and your
[1:04:05] son it could be you and your wife it
[1:04:07] could be you and your coworker we have a
[1:04:09] crisis we have a situation there there
[1:04:10] has to be a way out morai position is
[1:04:14] morai never said there's no way out he
[1:04:15] said God will sort it
[1:04:17] out but I think you could help in this
[1:04:20] situation he maintain a positive outlook
[1:04:24] some of us and we have said before we
[1:04:25] are to negative our default is we're in
[1:04:27] trouble is falling apart we don't know
[1:04:30] what to do this is morai ignoring the
[1:04:33] news report ignoring the legal document
[1:04:36] ignoring the pending danger saying they
[1:04:38] has to be away is either God going to do
[1:04:40] it and how he do it that's on him or we
[1:04:43] have to find a way to make something
[1:04:44] happen here and Esther how do you not
[1:04:47] know for such a time as this but we're
[1:04:49] not saying a NE we're not seeing in a
[1:04:51] negative vein if we could just lift our
[1:04:54] thinking away from the negative
[1:04:59] Because unless you reframe and we
[1:05:01] started it in this year shifting in
[1:05:03] narrative from why is this happening to
[1:05:06] me to why is it happening for me that's
[1:05:08] a first step in starting to find out how
[1:05:11] do
[1:05:13] I not can I achieve it but how can how
[1:05:17] can I achieve it because if you don't
[1:05:19] believe you can you're already lost but
[1:05:21] if you shift and I shared this with the
[1:05:23] church before some time ago when they
[1:05:25] study successful people across the board
[1:05:27] and they ask them in your moment of
[1:05:29] greatest difficulty what what was
[1:05:32] driving you and the Common Thread was
[1:05:35] they all did not know what was coming
[1:05:38] next but they all believed they will get
[1:05:39] through
[1:05:42] it the greatest leaders don't have all
[1:05:44] the answers but what they have is a
[1:05:46] tenacity and the belief that we'll find
[1:05:49] a
[1:05:50] way we'll work it out we'll figure it
[1:05:53] out others have been in different
[1:05:56] situations there's got to be a way
[1:05:59] somebody else figured it out somewhere
[1:06:00] else we have to figure it out and once
[1:06:03] you approach life that way your whole
[1:06:06] disposition because you begin to now
[1:06:08] look at what could have been closed
[1:06:09] doors and you begin to see
[1:06:11] opportunities we have shared the story
[1:06:13] many time somebody went to sell shoes
[1:06:15] and they two guys and they come with the
[1:06:17] same the same report
[1:06:20] boss nobody here wearing shoes we can't
[1:06:23] sell shoes another B say hey boss nobody
[1:06:26] here wear shoes you know the amount of
[1:06:28] shoes we can sell I never even see a
[1:06:30] place with so much opportunity before
[1:06:31] they look at the same the same thing you
[1:06:33] know but their perspective is
[1:06:36] different and as a Believer I don't care
[1:06:39] who backslide I don't care who give up I
[1:06:41] don't care who discourage that's not
[1:06:45] you giving up is not you backsliding is
[1:06:49] not you throwing in the towel is not
[1:06:52] you there are so many examples and
[1:06:55] testimonies of chrisis morning and for
[1:06:57] some of us we have seen experiences and
[1:06:59] pain but here it is somebody looking and
[1:07:01] saying but wait a minute they just pass
[1:07:03] a Lord and say I have to get
[1:07:05] killed do I just accept that as my fi do
[1:07:07] I just say well okay well I sit down and
[1:07:09] accept
[1:07:10] that more I say I'm not accepting that
[1:07:13] how many things have been true at you
[1:07:15] always I I accepted the doctor say I
[1:07:18] don't care what the doctor say whose
[1:07:20] report will you
[1:07:23] believe and this is why words are so
[1:07:27] important
[1:07:29] did even did the doctors say are not
[1:07:33] well those walk around saying you're not
[1:07:34] well
[1:07:35] or that what the doctor
[1:07:39] say that know your
[1:07:41] confession that's not your
[1:07:45] confession so if somebody asks you the
[1:07:47] doctors and them is who saying
[1:07:49] it but I am well I'm
[1:07:54] Healed if you to the doctors if you want
[1:07:56] to talk to doctors talk to them let them
[1:07:58] tell you but if you ask it from my mouth
[1:08:01] by his stripes I'm
[1:08:02] Healed I am well all is well we're going
[1:08:06] to make it we're going to overcome we're
[1:08:09] going to have the
[1:08:11] victory that is Bible but over preached
[1:08:14] on this some time ago where brother Bram
[1:08:17] G the example he said I wasn't lying I'm
[1:08:19] I'm I'm speaking my My Confession and we
[1:08:22] bring our bodies under subjection to
[1:08:24] obey our confession
[1:08:27] your life this is not living in an
[1:08:29] unrealistic way because Mori had a
[1:08:31] choice the same way he had a choice to
[1:08:33] bring Esther into his home it's the same
[1:08:35] he had a choice you know how Mory would
[1:08:37] have feel walking the street knowing
[1:08:38] everybody around you know how them Jews
[1:08:41] was watching
[1:08:43] him think about his context for a
[1:08:46] minute if Mory could have been walking
[1:08:48] on saying boy you know boy boy I really
[1:08:52] wasn't thinking with everybody you know
[1:08:53] but church I really sorry yeah I was you
[1:08:56] know I was a little zealous and if I
[1:08:57] didn't know that if I did didn't bow all
[1:09:00] of you was getting killed you understand
[1:09:02] the church meetings they was
[1:09:06] having I want us to understand the
[1:09:08] context because sometimes we don't
[1:09:09] realize that our actions have
[1:09:11] consequences morai could have gone into
[1:09:14] a valley of
[1:09:16] depression where is brother morai we
[1:09:18] haven't seen morai since they announced
[1:09:20] that they killing the Jews since hmon
[1:09:23] and morai fall out we haven't found
[1:09:25] anybody known brother morai number we
[1:09:27] WhatsApp him we call him he not
[1:09:29] answering because he gone into deep
[1:09:30] depression since this all the Fate he
[1:09:33] had dwindled
[1:09:34] on I want us to understand that life is
[1:09:38] about choices and every day we have a
[1:09:40] choice to keep moving forward or we have
[1:09:42] a choice to retreat and I'm saying
[1:09:43] whatever happens you have to keep moving
[1:09:46] forward so modai went from sackcloth and
[1:09:48] Ashes and after what he stopped that and
[1:09:51] went into
[1:09:52] strategy he said Esther here's what
[1:09:56] simple help is coming I can't tell you
[1:09:59] how I can't tell you where our God is a
[1:10:01] deliverer but when I look at the
[1:10:03] situation and look to my left I look to
[1:10:05] my right the only person I think could
[1:10:07] dun this thing home is you how do you
[1:10:09] not know that for such a time as this
[1:10:12] you are not in that position anybody
[1:10:14] with
[1:10:16] me I trust this is helping us a little
[1:10:18] bit and this is not for you to to look
[1:10:21] around your world to see who in position
[1:10:23] to this is you in position or no
[1:10:25] in this teaching tonight you are both
[1:10:28] morai and Esther you are both the
[1:10:30] influencer and the
[1:10:32] influency you are about the one in the
[1:10:34] position it's it's all of the above I
[1:10:37] want you to take lessons from this in
[1:10:40] your daily life in your spiritual work
[1:10:42] in your business work in your job take
[1:10:45] all of the issues and turn it into
[1:10:47] opportunities for God to get the
[1:10:50] glory leadership in crisis
[1:10:56] the Jews went into fasting and prayer
[1:10:57] and all these things in the narrative
[1:10:59] here let's go and let's find a place to
[1:11:02] land so we know the story
[1:11:07] that the next series of events is the
[1:11:11] sleepless night of the
[1:11:12] [Music]
[1:11:14] king and it's just amazing
[1:11:17] because who interrupted his sleeper the
[1:11:21] king God is behind the scene and he the
[1:11:25] every time the king tried to fall asleep
[1:11:27] God just hit
[1:11:28] him every time the king TR to fall
[1:11:31] asleep God just hit him and the King
[1:11:33] just car fall
[1:11:40] asleep this is chapter six of
[1:11:44] Esther on that night could not the king
[1:11:47] sleep and he commanded to bring the book
[1:11:49] of records of The Chronicles and they
[1:11:51] were read before the king so the the
[1:11:53] only reason the King won the book
[1:11:55] Chronicles it's not to get aware of the
[1:11:57] Chronicles it's to try to fall
[1:12:01] asleep and sometimes you wake up in the
[1:12:03] night and they cast sleep you know what
[1:12:05] the best thing to do when you're W your
[1:12:06] C sleep just go and pray
[1:12:09] you talk talk to God you get C just talk
[1:12:14] to
[1:12:16] God that's the Believers we have dealing
[1:12:18] with no sleep have a Comm with the
[1:12:22] Lord when you is God tap say let's
[1:12:27] talk but here it is this King God set it
[1:12:31] up this way because this is not by
[1:12:32] accident because the actions that come
[1:12:34] out of this is not by accident is All By
[1:12:39] Design chapter 6 verse two and it was
[1:12:41] found written that
[1:12:43] morai had told big tana and and and
[1:12:47] terce two of the Kings Chine the keep of
[1:12:48] the door who sought to lay hand on the
[1:12:51] king and the King said what honor and
[1:12:54] dignity
[1:12:55] had been done to morai for
[1:12:59] this and this to me just mindblowing and
[1:13:02] I want to Circle back on this again
[1:13:05] because here it is morai being faithful
[1:13:08] morai did not even use this experience
[1:13:11] to try to get out out out of the
[1:13:13] situation with
[1:13:16] t many of us would have said but look
[1:13:18] how the king treat me now Bo look how
[1:13:20] but King you don't remember when how
[1:13:23] much thing it was and I I save your life
[1:13:26] to show that modai act was genuine he
[1:13:29] didn't even use it as leverage you know
[1:13:31] some people are used as leverage over
[1:13:32] here 20 years later you remember the $2
[1:13:34] that they give you when they want to buy
[1:13:35] the Coke and the Pepsi and thing the pie
[1:13:38] the
[1:13:39] doubles it was 22 years ago I remember
[1:13:42] the day you wanted the doubles and I
[1:13:44] bought it for you and you still they
[1:13:46] want to collect thing 22 years
[1:13:48] afterwards here it is modai facing trial
[1:13:53] tribulation and testing and he pull out
[1:13:55] this if it's ever is if it's ever
[1:13:57] somebody can leverage at that point say
[1:13:59] but King oh gosh spare my life now
[1:14:00] remember our
[1:14:02] savior so the king now under under
[1:14:05] strategic guidance asking the question
[1:14:08] because again the king trying to sleep
[1:14:10] you know so clearly the issue is about
[1:14:13] sleep because you ask
[1:14:15] what what what what what honor and
[1:14:18] dignity had been done to morai for this
[1:14:21] then said the king servant and
[1:14:22] ministered unto him there's nothing done
[1:14:24] for him
[1:14:27] and the King said who is in the court
[1:14:29] now hon had come into the outward Court
[1:14:31] of the King's house to speak unto the
[1:14:33] king to hang
[1:14:35] Mori
[1:14:38] so your car there's no script writer on
[1:14:41] the earth who could write this kind of
[1:14:44] thing you know while the king trying to
[1:14:46] figure out who in court to deal with
[1:14:48] what he want to deal with hmon coming
[1:14:50] under inspiration under judgment
[1:14:52] anointing to hang morai so apart from
[1:14:56] going after the Jews he can't even wait
[1:14:59] to go after the Jews he want to hang he
[1:15:00] want to H hang monai
[1:15:05] now now him had come into the outward
[1:15:07] Court of the Kings house to speak and
[1:15:09] the King to hang M on The Gallows that
[1:15:11] he had prepared so hmon a government
[1:15:14] Minister a
[1:15:16] leader take time out of his work
[1:15:19] schedule to order an architect and a
[1:15:22] builder to build a Gallows
[1:15:25] to hang morai instead of the Affairs of
[1:15:29] State he take good government time to
[1:15:32] spend design and then waiting to get the
[1:15:35] king's ear to get permission to go and
[1:15:37] hang Mori
[1:15:39] right verse five and the King servant
[1:15:41] said unto him behold hmon standed in the
[1:15:43] court and the King said let him come on
[1:15:45] let him come in so hmon came in and the
[1:15:47] King said unto him what shall be
[1:15:50] done unto the man whom the king
[1:15:53] delighted to honor
[1:15:56] now hmon taught in his heart to whom
[1:16:00] would the king Delight to do honor more
[1:16:02] than myself no this is just this is just
[1:16:06] all every time I read the scripture you
[1:16:07] could never get over this so so so again
[1:16:10] talk about an OV exaggerated sense of
[1:16:12] selfworth overestimating your S price
[1:16:15] thinking higher than yourself than you
[1:16:17] are thinking beyond your station hmon
[1:16:20] can't even see beyond himself he said
[1:16:23] when I look around this could only be
[1:16:26] talking about me who else would the king
[1:16:28] be thinking about to ask this question
[1:16:31] and this is in his heart what is in your
[1:16:33] heart when when when people want to
[1:16:36] bless in does your heart say me me me me
[1:16:41] me and hymon answered the king for the
[1:16:44] man whom the king delighted on her let
[1:16:46] the Royal apparel so you can see now
[1:16:49] what in his heart all time he there but
[1:16:51] now you get to unlock you deep with his
[1:16:53] eyes in the heart let Royal apparel the
[1:16:56] brought which the King used it to wear
[1:17:00] and the horse that the king rideth upon
[1:17:04] and the Crown Royal which is set upon
[1:17:06] his head now if I was the king I'd would
[1:17:09] be a little concerned they be go here
[1:17:10] himon watching all the king things you
[1:17:12] recognize the king horse the king
[1:17:14] clothes the king
[1:17:17] crown hereon there as a second in
[1:17:20] command and he want to be first in
[1:17:21] command
[1:17:22] bad that's in he had he said
[1:17:25] let the Royal apparel be brought which
[1:17:27] the King used it to
[1:17:29] wear he closed the man the horse that he
[1:17:33] King ride it upon the crown Ro is set
[1:17:36] upon his head and let this apparel and
[1:17:38] horse be delivered to the hand of one of
[1:17:41] the king's most noble
[1:17:43] princes that they may array the man with
[1:17:46] all whom the king delighted honor and
[1:17:49] bring him on Horseback through the
[1:17:51] street of the city and Proclaim before
[1:17:54] him thus shall it be done to the man
[1:17:57] whom the king delighted to
[1:18:00] honor and you can imagine you know when
[1:18:03] some people describe some things as if
[1:18:05] they're seeing it so you could see hmon
[1:18:07] could have gone into a certain anointing
[1:18:09] a certain gear he's seeing it he's
[1:18:11] seeing himself on the horse he seeing he
[1:18:13] say boy hey that that would look good
[1:18:15] that would look that is the picture that
[1:18:17] is like your your ambition your your
[1:18:19] your your thing upon your wall to watch
[1:18:21] when you wake up in the morning this is
[1:18:22] what I want to see and King's response
[1:18:25] then the king said to him and make
[1:18:28] his and take the apparel and the horse
[1:18:31] and th and thou Hast as thou said and do
[1:18:34] even so to Mori the Jew that set it at
[1:18:37] the king's gate let nothing fail of all
[1:18:40] that thou has spoken in other words
[1:18:42] every single thing that you describe
[1:18:45] that need to happen let none of it fail
[1:18:46] in other words execute this thing to
[1:18:52] Perfection you call that the Divine
[1:18:54] reversal
[1:18:55] [Laughter]
[1:18:58] then took him on the apparel and the
[1:19:00] horse and arrayed Mori and brought him
[1:19:02] on horse back through and you know hmon
[1:19:05] that would have been tough hmon but Mora
[1:19:07] himself had to be reconciling but wait a
[1:19:09] minute what really going on here
[1:19:11] boy you know when the psalmist David
[1:19:14] says the Lord will prepare a table for
[1:19:16] you in the presence of the enemies I
[1:19:18] shared with somebody recently how could
[1:19:20] that scripture ever be fulfilled if you
[1:19:22] don't have enemies
[1:19:25] the Lord wants to prepare a table for
[1:19:28] you in the presence of the enemies how
[1:19:30] could that scripture ever be fulfilled
[1:19:32] if you don't have enemies and this
[1:19:35] scripture the Bible said he preparest
[1:19:38] preparest is is an activity this is not
[1:19:41] you walk into a room and the table is
[1:19:43] set this is God is taking time to lay
[1:19:45] the sheet on the thing put he he put the
[1:19:47] cloth he put the cup he put the spoon he
[1:19:50] put the fork he is preparing as an
[1:19:52] activity the table while the enemy
[1:19:54] watching they watching the prepared for
[1:19:57] you in the presence of the enemies Isn't
[1:19:58] Our God a wonderful God to think of His
[1:20:01] blessings in the face of difficulty and
[1:20:03] challenges here it is Mori is walking
[1:20:07] here and he his his enemies you want to
[1:20:09] guide the whole Pro the
[1:20:13] procession what a rush of emotions what
[1:20:16] a rush of a journey of a man who took it
[1:20:19] upon himself to raise a daughter who was
[1:20:21] not his
[1:20:22] own to help a king with out the desire
[1:20:26] for recompense or
[1:20:28] reward to just do his duty and follow
[1:20:30] his conviction and to be at the mercy of
[1:20:33] debt and now to be rewarded but still
[1:20:36] has you wisdom to know that the issue is
[1:20:38] not closed but something is Shifting in
[1:20:40] the
[1:20:41] atmosphere can the church say
[1:20:47] Amen then took himmon this is verse 11
[1:20:50] the the apparel and the horse and AR
[1:20:52] raay Mori and brought him on horse back
[1:20:53] through the street of the SE City and
[1:20:54] proclaimed before him thus shall it be
[1:20:56] done unto the man whom the king
[1:20:58] delighted to honor and Mori came again
[1:21:00] to the king's gate but hmon hasted to
[1:21:02] his house mourning and having his head
[1:21:04] covered hon
[1:21:06] embarrassed you see this we never really
[1:21:08] spend time on these verses so after this
[1:21:11] Hon do even want to show his face
[1:21:15] now and hymon told Zares his wife and
[1:21:18] all his friends everything that had
[1:21:20] befallen him so as far as hmon is
[1:21:22] concerned his life fall apart him
[1:21:25] the Bible said what have befallen him
[1:21:28] then said his wise men and Zares his
[1:21:30] wife unto him if Mori be of the seed of
[1:21:33] the Jews before whom thou Hast begun to
[1:21:35] fall Thou shalt not Prevail against him
[1:21:38] but Thou shalt surely fall before him so
[1:21:41] the wife start to say listen himon you
[1:21:43] need to check yourself because this
[1:21:45] thing are looking good it looking
[1:21:48] good what your plan was start to fall
[1:21:50] apart real fast and if in fact this Jew
[1:21:53] just get the highest award it look as if
[1:21:55] a plan about to fall
[1:21:57] apart and while they were yet talking
[1:21:59] with him came the king's chiming and
[1:22:01] hastened to bring hmon onto the banquet
[1:22:03] that Esther had prepared and we know the
[1:22:06] story that Esther begins to reveal to
[1:22:08] the king that there are people out to
[1:22:10] try to kill her and to destroy her and
[1:22:12] when he ask who it is he say well it's
[1:22:14] he all right so I want us to see here
[1:22:17] this narrative and I want us to
[1:22:20] understand
[1:22:21] that the shaping of our character Our
[1:22:25] Lives there's a role of a mentor for all
[1:22:29] of us and there's opportunities for all
[1:22:32] of us to be a mentor or an influence to
[1:22:35] others the the most important lesson
[1:22:38] here is Esther had a mentor Esther had a
[1:22:41] guide Esther had someone who was able to
[1:22:44] point her at the right time in the right
[1:22:46] way that person was there to shape to
[1:22:48] mold to encourage to direct that led her
[1:22:52] being receptive being obedient being
[1:22:53] responsive being
[1:22:55] respectful we live in an age now where
[1:22:58] young people inherently entitled
[1:23:00] disrespectful they want to do their own
[1:23:02] they don't want to hear nobody they want
[1:23:03] to try they they have a better idea and
[1:23:05] technology has enabled
[1:23:07] that but technology is not wisdom
[1:23:10] knowledge is not
[1:23:12] wisdom and there's a room for all of us
[1:23:15] to have the right influences on our own
[1:23:17] lives and to also be the right influence
[1:23:22] on others I'm getting ready to close
[1:23:30] out morai was
[1:23:35] instrumental in this entire Narrative of
[1:23:40] Esther morai provided the
[1:23:44] strategy Esther focus on the
[1:23:49] execution using her position as Queen to
[1:23:53] advocate for her people people before
[1:23:56] the
[1:23:58] king according to Persian
[1:24:00] law the king's original decree to
[1:24:03] destroy the Jews could not be
[1:24:10] revoked in chapter 8 ver7 then the king
[1:24:14] said unto Esther the queen andto Mori
[1:24:17] behold I have given Esther the house of
[1:24:20] hmon and him they have hanged upon the
[1:24:22] Gallows because he his hand upon the
[1:24:25] Jews write ye also for the Jews as it
[1:24:29] liketh you in the king's name and seal
[1:24:33] it with the king's ring for the writing
[1:24:35] which is written in the king's name and
[1:24:37] seal with the king's Ring May no man
[1:24:41] reverse so the power to write a new law
[1:24:45] went to Esther and morai to write the
[1:24:49] law to reverse the law or to address the
[1:24:52] law rather that was originally written
[1:24:54] so you have a man who was sitting in the
[1:24:56] gate now he's writing laws in this new
[1:24:59] environment isn't that in that is that
[1:25:01] mind-blowing to see the progress of a
[1:25:04] simple man who had who took the risk of
[1:25:06] taking on a young girl and now he's
[1:25:07] writing
[1:25:10] laws we closing out
[1:25:15] now just finding a place to land
[1:25:27] closing out here in Esther
[1:25:34] 10 and the
[1:25:37] Kingus laid a tribute upon the land and
[1:25:40] upon the Isles of the sea and all the
[1:25:42] acts of his power and of his might and
[1:25:44] the Declaration of the greatness of
[1:25:48] Mori where unto the king Advanced him
[1:25:51] are he not written in the book of
[1:25:53] Chronicles of the kings of media and the
[1:25:55] Persia for morai the Jew was next unto
[1:25:59] King aurus and great among the Jews so
[1:26:03] in other words Mori went from being just
[1:26:05] a simple man in the gate to being the
[1:26:07] most powerful man in the
[1:26:10] entire country the entire Kingdom right
[1:26:14] on man the
[1:26:17] king what an encouragement to
[1:26:20] us about being the right type of
[1:26:22] influence
[1:26:24] about being able to navigate
[1:26:27] challenges of being able to do the right
[1:26:30] thing without expecting a reward and to
[1:26:32] see God come and do it because at the
[1:26:33] end of the day how this transpired was
[1:26:36] not man morai didn't orchestrate this
[1:26:38] whole thing every piece of this was God
[1:26:41] achieving a great purpose and
[1:26:43] encouragement tonight is God is going to
[1:26:46] achieve a great purpose in your life and
[1:26:49] the lesson I want you to take is ensure
[1:26:51] that you have the right influence and
[1:26:53] ensure that you being your right type of
[1:26:55] influence can we bow our heads for word
[1:26:57] of
[1:26:57] prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we
[1:27:00] thank you tonight for this opportunity
[1:27:02] to just share this Bible study Lord to
[1:27:05] look at familiar scriptures and maybe
[1:27:08] see something in it that we have not
[1:27:09] looked at in that way before I pray
[1:27:12] there God that you encourage your people
[1:27:13] you would bless your people that you
[1:27:15] would open their understanding to how
[1:27:17] they could be better Christians and Lord
[1:27:20] become better influences and Lord even
[1:27:22] more importantly s under the right
[1:27:24] influence lord it's so easy in this time
[1:27:27] to be influenced the wrong way your
[1:27:29] Prophet preached about there only two
[1:27:30] influences influence from above
[1:27:32] influence from below and father the lid
[1:27:34] of Hell being uncovered and leveraging
[1:27:36] so many things from technology and all
[1:27:38] these things to try to influence people
[1:27:40] to Lord be so many things Lord Lord to
[1:27:43] be able to come to your word to get
[1:27:45] Divine influence from you through your
[1:27:46] scriptures and how you have laid it out
[1:27:48] in so many different ways that we could
[1:27:50] find peace and encouragement that no
[1:27:52] matter the adversity no matter the
[1:27:54] testimony no matter the the report of
[1:27:56] the doctor or the business or the job or
[1:27:57] the economy or whatever it might be
[1:28:00] there is a way out Lord and you are a
[1:28:01] way Lord but you also placees on this
[1:28:03] Earth to have dominion to figure things
[1:28:05] out to work things out father you put
[1:28:07] man on the earth to have dominion on on
[1:28:10] on on in in in this existence father
[1:28:12] because the Earth belongs to us father
[1:28:14] Lord you placed us here to have dominion
[1:28:16] you placed us here to be reflections of
[1:28:18] your deity of your majesty of your power
[1:28:20] on the earth father may you bless your

[1:28:28] Mori this testimony Lord of Lord this
[1:28:32] this this this almost second character
[1:28:34] to Esther but Lord the Book of Esther
[1:28:36] ends Lord not speaking about Esther but
[1:28:38] it ends speaking about Mori who was
[1:28:40] second only to the king Lord so in many
[1:28:43] ways Lord we see this Hidden Hand this
[1:28:45] this hidden presence as it were as as
[1:28:47] morai was a hidden hand and a hidden
[1:28:50] expression and a support Lord to Esther
[1:28:53] to help her be watch is Father Lord we
[1:28:55] see you Lord also helping to guide a
[1:28:58] bride helping to show us how to go and
[1:29:00] how to prepare and what we should put in

[1:29:23] silent to know when to run when to hide
[1:29:25] when to move when to attack father Lord
[1:29:27] we see David saying Lord shall I pursue
[1:29:29] he he wanted more than just his emotion
[1:29:32] more than his knowledge more than his
[1:29:33] strength he was looking for Lord a
[1:29:35] Divine influence Lord and and when you
