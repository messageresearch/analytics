[31:10] be present
[31:12] release the unction to speak your word
[31:15] lord
[31:15] speak truth to the people i don't think
[31:17] we ever did this before
[31:19] but beyond our new grounds lord we on
[31:22] holy grounds father and i pray that you
[31:24] would heal the sicken helmets
[31:26] raise up those that are struggling and
[31:29] don't trodden and maybe depressed
[31:31] touch those who are connected to us live
[31:33] here now and those that they would hear
[31:35] the message
[31:36] that the anointing of the holy spirit
[31:38] would go into their homes
[31:39] into their hearts into their lives and
[31:41] change and transform them
[31:43] and jesus may ask it amen and amen
[31:46] god bless you before you have your seats
[31:49] i'd like to go into the scriptures this
[31:51] morning
[31:55] we will take the prayer requests and so
[31:56] on after service
[31:58] i want to read luke 17 reading from 26
[32:01] to 30
[32:03] first thessalonians chapter four we want
[32:05] to read from 14 to 18
[32:08] revelation 8 1 and revelation 10 1-4 so
[32:11] four personal scriptures
[32:12] this morning luke 17 26-30
[32:16] first thessalonians 4 14-18 is writing a
[32:19] down
[32:20] revelation 8 1 and revelation 10 1-4
[32:23] good to see all of you all this morning
[32:26] we are looking to the lord
[32:30] remember governments may change
[32:33] times changed system laws change but
[32:35] this word
[32:37] can't change this is the only thing we
[32:40] have constant
[32:43] so let's look to luke 17 reading from
[32:45] verse 26
[32:47] jesus speaking and it wasn't as it was
[32:49] in the days of noah
[32:51] so shall it also be in the days of the
[32:53] son of man watch it
[32:55] days of the son of man they did eat they
[32:59] drank they married wives they were given
[33:00] marriage
[33:01] until the day that noah entered in the
[33:02] ark and the flood came
[33:04] and destroyed them all likewise also as
[33:07] it was in the days of lot
[33:09] they did eat they drank they bought they
[33:11] sold they planted they built it as you
[33:13] noticed normal living
[33:15] but the same day that lot went out of
[33:17] saturn
[33:18] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[33:21] and destroyed them all
[33:23] even thus shall it be in the day
[33:27] when the son of man is revealed sister
[33:30] celine chapter 4
[33:32] 10 verse 14
[33:35] for if we believe that jesus died and
[33:37] rose again even so them also which sleep
[33:40] in jesus will god bring with him
[33:42] for this we say unto you by the word of
[33:44] the lord that we which are alive and
[33:46] remain
[33:46] unto the coming of the lord shall not
[33:49] prevent them which are asleep
[33:51] for the lord himself shall descend from
[33:54] heaven with a shout
[33:55] and the voice of the archangel and with
[33:58] the trump of god
[34:00] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[34:02] then we which are alive
[34:04] and remain shall be caught up together
[34:06] with them in the clouds
[34:07] to meet the lord in the ear and so shall
[34:10] we ever be with the lord
[34:12] wherefore comfort one another with these
[34:15] words
[34:16] revelation eight one verse verse one and
[34:19] when he had opened
[34:20] the seventh seal there was silence in
[34:23] heaven
[34:24] about his peace of half an hour let me
[34:27] go over to revelation 10
[34:28] reading from verse one to four i saw
[34:31] another
[34:31] angel come down from heaven close with a
[34:33] cloud a rainbow was upon his head
[34:36] his face as good as sun his feet
[34:39] as well as a fire he had in his hand a
[34:42] little book open
[34:43] he set his right foot upon the sea his
[34:46] left foot
[34:46] on the earth and cried with a loud voice
[34:49] as when a lion roared
[34:51] and when he cried seven thunders uttered
[34:54] the voices
[34:55] when the seven thunders had uttered the
[34:56] voices i was about to write
[34:58] and i heard a voice of heaven seen unto
[35:01] me seal up those things
[35:02] which the seven thunders uttered and
[35:04] write them not
[35:05] let's pray father we thank you for your
[35:07] word tonight and we this morning and we
[35:09] pray come and interpret it to our hearts
[35:11] we wait on you in jesus name we ask it
[35:13] email you may be seated
[35:15] praise god god bless you and welcome
[35:17] again it's so good to be here
[35:19] and as we said last week we couldn't
[35:22] complete and i
[35:24] i'm not even sure about this week but
[35:25] we're going to try to see the best that
[35:26] we can
[35:28] i know there's so much to pull out of
[35:30] what we are sharing
[35:32] so we see what the lord do in other
[35:34] messages to come
[35:35] but the title of this message is but
[35:39] under the seven seal the bride's message
[35:43] i know it sounds kind of odd it start
[35:45] with a butt
[35:47] but we continuing from last sunday
[35:50] so last sunday was uh uh
[35:53] six seals ties up the loose ends
[35:56] but this is this sunday now but
[36:00] under the seven seal the bride's message
[36:02] that's the title
[36:04] but under the seven sea of the bride's
[36:05] message of a subject
[36:08] the seal of life the seventh
[36:12] seal and have an inspiration
[36:15] let the main thing be the main thing
[36:18] oh hallelujah we get so much uh
[36:21] distracted by things that are not the
[36:24] main thing
[36:25] uh we get uh sidetrack in homes and
[36:29] business and marriages and situations
[36:31] in churches we we focus sometimes too
[36:34] much on things that
[36:35] that doesn't really count it doesn't
[36:37] hold really value and
[36:39] in matthew 13 44 jesus said this again
[36:42] the kingdom of heaven
[36:44] is like a treasure hidden in the field
[36:47] the witch when the man found he hide it
[36:50] and for joy thereof go it and sell it
[36:52] all that he had
[36:54] and buy it that field he found the
[36:56] treasure in the field
[36:57] and then nothing else mattered after
[36:59] that his job was to sell everything
[37:02] by the field and get the treasure so we
[37:05] under a treasure hunt this morning
[37:07] oh glory to god so we just want to
[37:10] make a bridge from last week to now and
[37:12] i trust you'll go blessed by the
[37:18] i trust you were blessed by uh this
[37:21] week's service
[37:22] tie up the loose ends in your life and
[37:24] that message wednesday was a subset
[37:26] as we say of the sunday service about
[37:28] the messenger come to tie up the loose
[37:30] ends and the word
[37:31] and god don't like loose ends god like
[37:33] to close the gap
[37:35] close the circle go to all right
[37:37] solutions
[37:38] things have to be tied up before the
[37:40] full blessing could come
[37:42] isn't that right so therefore and then
[37:45] we had
[37:46] the will of god sanctification the bible
[37:47] study if you haven't listened to it just
[37:49] go back and listen
[37:50] to it but that message about tying up
[37:52] delusions in your life
[37:53] is very important it is the things that
[37:56] you have to do
[37:57] the pastor cannot do it for you let me
[37:59] tell you this your husband can't do it
[38:00] for you
[38:01] your wife cannot do it for you your
[38:03] children cannot do it for you
[38:04] you have to do that for yourself oh
[38:07] glory to god so time you sit in front of
[38:09] the mirror and say you know what i have
[38:10] to deal with me
[38:12] hallelujah you have to get that guy
[38:14] cornered he always ducking and bobbing
[38:15] scorn him and say where you're going
[38:18] with all them loose ends with all them
[38:20] outstanding things
[38:21] in your life that you have to take care
[38:22] of it's time you begin to look again
[38:24] and begin to take here go afterwards
[38:27] thing just run away you know
[38:28] yeah and it remains unhandled oh glory
[38:32] to god and i was reading
[38:34] for a meeting exhorting on friday we're
[38:36] talking about he that's private
[38:38] for the mastery his temperate and all
[38:40] things
[38:41] that is a different level altogether
[38:42] that is not he that working to be
[38:44] mediocre and we were saying
[38:47] that is not entering the race is the
[38:49] issue if
[38:50] entering the race they get a tick and
[38:52] the congratulations they enter
[38:53] then everybody who enter have a tick but
[38:56] sometimes enter and drop off the race
[38:58] it's not him who starts it's him who
[39:00] finishes so it's not that matter you're
[39:02] coming to church or you're entering to
[39:04] christianity is if you're going to
[39:05] finish the course
[39:06] and if you finish the course it have a
[39:08] target and a goal
[39:09] that's the only way it could be
[39:11] measurable nothing that have a goal and
[39:13] a target
[39:14] if you don't have a golden target it can
[39:16] be measured then anything goes
[39:18] live any kind of life and come to church
[39:21] and you're a christian but that's not
[39:22] true
[39:23] you will find out them spirits will take
[39:25] up everybody who on the loose ends
[39:27] so we warning you because then titan
[39:30] spirit has jumped and echassical spirits
[39:32] just jump behind the pulpit to pick up
[39:33] ministers on the loose ends
[39:35] ministers under six seals ministers that
[39:37] have interpretation on their own idea
[39:39] demon powers has dropped behind them oh
[39:42] yes
[39:43] an enticing spirit will drop behind
[39:44] believers who have loosens in their life
[39:48] oh glory to god because you wouldn't
[39:49] have the confidence to approach god
[39:52] and sincerity brings power and if you're
[39:54] doing the wrong thing and you're
[39:55] carrying
[39:56] it with foolishness you wouldn't be
[39:57] sincere to approach god for him to
[39:59] answer your prayer and you want god to
[40:01] answer your prayer
[40:02] if your heart condemned you he's greater
[40:04] than your heart i want to get in the
[40:06] message but i have to go through all
[40:07] that
[40:07] all that all that all that because the
[40:09] spirit must be picking up all that
[40:11] all that right here oh give the lord
[40:13] some praises
[40:14] so don't just take it as another message
[40:16] take it as something to apply
[40:21] all right when you see the message
[40:24] nothing else matters
[40:27] nothing else matters jesus blessed him
[40:29] except a man forsake mother father
[40:30] brother wife husband
[40:32] follow me not worry at me hallelujah
[40:35] because it's not the only world
[40:37] don't get tired you know this is not the
[40:39] only world you know
[40:40] worse is yet to come you know this
[40:42] coronavirus is the introduction
[40:45] and how was hot words had to come he
[40:47] said the
[40:48] man will die in the flesh and the word
[40:49] even die rotten in the flesh and they're
[40:50] not even dying
[40:51] calling for death and that ain't coming
[40:54] oh glory to god what is it
[40:55] the plagues didn't the bible talk about
[40:58] that
[40:59] poor defile and plagues on the earth but
[41:01] they are coming some sons
[41:03] born sons
[41:06] predestinated sons adopted sons
[41:09] they're going to stop the plagues stop
[41:12] the cancer stop the tumor
[41:16] you understand what happened when
[41:18] doctors can't do nothing about it and
[41:20] science cabinet
[41:21] and all them countries billions of
[41:23] billion dollars scrambling
[41:25] and god waited for a church to get an
[41:27] order
[41:29] for he could pour out the omnipotence
[41:31] and when omnipotence speak
[41:33] the miraculous take place don't you want
[41:36] to see that
[41:37] or you want an injection
[41:41] let me be seated
[41:44] hallelujah hallelujah glory
[41:48] so since the prophet left another
[41:50] interpreter's interpreters come after
[41:52] that
[41:52] loose and sexy what kind of
[41:54] interpretation on men's idea and
[41:55] thoughts and who is many prophets and
[41:57] who want to be a mini malachi 4 and all
[41:59] them kind of stories
[42:00] whose apostle is this who is this
[42:02] prophet and everything else
[42:03] and what happened to that we see what
[42:05] would live out it's just interpretation
[42:07] they were just laughing at that because
[42:09] we're coming up to johnson and jumpers
[42:11] you know
[42:12] we're here yet tonight janice and james
[42:14] and all skull degree people in
[42:16] them in witchcraft them under anointing
[42:20] they withstand moses when they drop them
[42:23] rot them drop down raw two
[42:24] they're rotten to snake too so they're
[42:27] operating under our power
[42:29] and he said as janice and jamborees
[42:31] which stood moses
[42:33] so they committed wisdom so it's no game
[42:35] it's not text versus text
[42:37] it's power versus power come on give me
[42:38] a come on now come on now preach back to
[42:40] me now
[42:45] [Applause]
[42:48] it's not tax versus tax in them no no no
[42:51] it's power
[42:53] versus power but you have a promise you
[42:56] shall receive power
[42:58] after the holy ghost come upon you so
[43:00] hear what how
[43:01] good
[43:05] so now what what we have known
[43:09] in the past is church
[43:12] church and i want to compare it to what
[43:15] jesus encountered
[43:16] when he came on the scene what he ended
[43:18] the concept was church
[43:20] pharisees sadducees herodians church
[43:24] john the baptist outside the system
[43:26] small church man
[43:28] blessing repent for the kingdom of god
[43:31] is at hand
[43:33] and crow satirical wrong john because
[43:35] there's a different move now
[43:36] there's a different beat now with
[43:38] different vibes now for years
[43:40] they know the pharisees and the services
[43:41] tall hats long guns pretty garments
[43:43] customized
[43:45] they hear a man with rugged camel skin
[43:49] while honey and a man come on the
[43:52] wilderness blast in the hole and they
[43:54] know he was anointed
[43:55] and from all her parents he looked like
[43:57] he was commissioned
[43:58] and he said to baptize people and they
[44:01] come down they know something moving you
[44:02] know
[44:03] and they want to ask are you are you the
[44:05] messiah should we look
[44:06] who are you he said i am one kind in the
[44:08] wilderness
[44:11] because all of them knew according to
[44:14] prophecy something supposed to happen
[44:17] they don't know when they don't know
[44:20] where
[44:21] they don't know how but they could feel
[44:24] it
[44:25] they could sense it they know it's going
[44:28] to come true
[44:38] some of them guess how they get
[44:39] conviction they start to get baptized
[44:41] he's had a bust at one time you better
[44:43] bring forth fruit
[44:44] oh come on me to talk talk if it's a act
[44:46] upon what we say in here
[44:47] bring fruit for repentance don't say
[44:49] you're sorry i'm doing nothing about it
[44:51] act
[44:52] do act do
[45:01] and one day john the baptist felt so
[45:04] anointed
[45:06] he started to preach he said there was
[45:08] one standing among you
[45:10] and jesus right there looking he said
[45:13] there is one standing among you
[45:15] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[45:19] and with fire oh jesus hallelujah
[45:23] jesus sat down for 18 years hearing the
[45:27] interpretation under the sixth seal
[45:29] anointing of the old testament
[45:30] that they were wrongly interpreting and
[45:33] he was the seal of god
[45:34] himself and he said nothing
[45:38] and he came to john and get baptized and
[45:40] the holy ghost struck him
[45:41] and jesus led by the holy ghost into the
[45:44] wilderness tempted of the devil
[45:46] overcome by the word return in power
[45:48] found the place where it is written
[45:50] find his scripture and said this day
[45:53] this scripture
[45:54] is fulfilled and i could see a bright
[45:56] anointed
[45:57] power led into the wilderness overcome
[46:00] the devil
[46:01] come back to the scriptures find your
[46:03] scripture and
[46:04] get them devils running but are we on
[46:07] our way to our rapture
[46:08] we on our way to resurrection oh we on
[46:11] our way to the millennium
[46:12] what glory to god and this is what we're
[46:14] going into there will be no
[46:16] impersonation to it
[46:18] the devil cannot impersonate what we are
[46:21] going into
[46:22] there is absolutely positively
[46:25] no impersonation to it because it will
[46:28] not be man
[46:29] oh glory to god it will be god himself

[54:51] but on the back side it was sealed with
[54:53] some seals
[54:54] so to go inside the book you have to
[54:56] break the seals from the back of the
[54:58] book if you don't break the series off
[54:59] the book you can't go inside the book
[55:01] hallelujah so those backside seas are
[55:03] very important
[55:04] all right let's continue he said all
[55:07] right john
[55:11] but on the backs of the bible the
[55:12] revelation has shown to daniel say
[55:15] that there is seven voices to be uttered
[55:19] that no man could open no man know what
[55:23] it was but the bible said
[55:25] as it was told to daniel in the last
[55:27] days these
[55:29] seven voices would be known by the real
[55:32] true church
[55:34] not the false church that real true
[55:36] church oh glory to god and christ
[55:39] setting his foot upon the land upon the
[55:40] sea the rainbow over his head remember
[55:42] this seven angels on the earth at the
[55:45] time of his coming
[55:47] oh glory to god so when that angel
[55:48] brought down the book look at the
[55:49] scriptures you know man like that
[55:52] events happen in heaven and events
[55:54] happen on
[55:55] it oh glory to god let me say it again
[55:58] events happening in heaven
[56:00] and events happening in it on earth adam
[56:03] lost the book when he fell
[56:05] satan's greasy hands tried to hold it it
[56:07] slipped out his hands because he do
[56:09] afraid to hold it
[56:10] his unbelief slip out his hands and the
[56:12] book had no choice but to go back to the
[56:14] hands of the
[56:14] original owner which is god himself
[56:18] and it waited for the last days for
[56:20] redemption claims to be made
[56:23] because our angel in the book of
[56:24] revelation who is were they who is were
[56:26] they
[56:27] christ have to come to pay the price
[56:29] blood price and calvary
[56:31] not just to save your soul but to get
[56:33] the book
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:37] how many no this is not a predicate
[56:39] church now we're not talking about jesus
[56:40] save now
[56:41] we talk about you being redeemed
[56:43] redeemers to bring you back
[56:45] now the devil don't want you to know
[56:47] that the pentagon said they don't know
[56:48] nothing about that
[56:49] all the evangelicals and so on they know
[56:51] nothing no jesus i'm saved i'm saved
[56:53] they want to dress how they want to
[56:55] dress
[56:55] wear what clothes they want to wear
[56:56] behave however they want to be and i am
[56:58] saying we're not talking about salvation
[57:00] we are talking about redemption and
[57:02] redemption have two parts
[57:04] coming out of and going into the
[57:07] majority of people have come out of the
[57:08] baptist and methodists but they haven't
[57:09] gone into
[57:10] what we're coming into here right now
[57:13] god has just called you all to believe
[57:14] our message
[57:15] go and call you out to go into something
[57:20] let me jam it now go there call you out
[57:22] to go into six
[57:25] well your seals weapon is argument
[57:31] under 16 is the only weapon is argument
[57:33] i am right you are wrong i am right you
[57:35] are wrong you are wrong i am right
[57:40] the devil is not intimidated by six
[57:42] seals
[57:47] jesus what are you gonna do with the
[57:48] first seal history
[57:50] that pass i can see pass
[57:54] third seal pass fought seal
[57:57] tribulation fifth seal souls on the
[57:59] altar
[58:00] for what fifty sixty rather
[58:05] it's tribulation isn't that right but
[58:07] the seventh seal
[58:09] silence
[58:13] nothing for a space of half an hour
[58:18] so up in heaven something taking place
[58:20] oh glory to god half an hour
[58:22] is fixed for that seven seal that means
[58:24] there's a time limit
[58:26] to get you out if you don't shout about
[58:30] that
[58:32] right now i feel god is throwing
[58:34] emergency mode and emergency
[58:36] gear oh glory to god the devil knows
[58:39] time is short time running no
[58:41] therefore the spirit has to go after
[58:43] your family no
[58:44] after loved ones know all go after their
[58:47] children after them backstage got the
[58:49] spirit
[58:50] of god oh glory mighty work of god a
[58:52] supernatural work of god
[58:56] let's continue so then
[59:00] you see at the end of the pentecostal
[59:02] age we are supposed to receive according
[59:03] to the word of god
[59:05] we are supposed to leave a messenger
[59:07] that will take all the loose ends out
[59:09] there
[59:10] and reveal the secret the whole secret
[59:13] of god
[59:14] for the rapting of the church and then
[59:16] there's coming forth seven mysterious
[59:18] standards
[59:19] that are not written at all and i
[59:21] believe that through
[59:22] these those seven thunders will be
[59:25] revealed
[59:25] purpose in the last days in order
[59:28] to get the bride together for rapture
[59:31] and fate
[59:32] and that's why i say in coronavirus have
[59:34] a limit too
[59:37] because there will be a great gathering
[59:39] i
[59:40] don't want a social discipline you know
[59:41] there will be a great gathering
[59:45] so everything i've had time under the
[59:46] sun so corona have a time too
[59:49] just now the corona time will be up
[59:54] i can say so before the scientists say
[59:56] so i could say so before they have
[59:59] vaccine
[1:00:00] i can say so before they say anything
[1:00:02] because that was the word declare
[1:00:04] and the word can't lie virus or no virus
[1:00:08] this word can't like
[1:00:15] because what we got with what we got
[1:00:17] right now rough feet
[1:00:18] we won't be able to do it i wonder if
[1:00:21] you understand that
[1:00:22] this is not going to church business ago
[1:00:26] interrupted
[1:00:28] understand if there's a book in the back
[1:00:29] a pocket or a bible tap your head or
[1:00:31] you're sleeping with a set of bibles on
[1:00:32] top of you
[1:00:33] like a bible like a cloak that ain't
[1:00:36] gonna make it do
[1:00:37] god senior make a robot a or a
[1:00:41] you bible you know what he said you know
[1:00:44] he said what we have hardly able to do
[1:00:47] it
[1:00:48] there is we have got to step further
[1:00:53] a lot of people don't want to push they
[1:00:56] want a shortcut
[1:00:58] that's why they love the person so bad
[1:01:01] because he is the priest
[1:01:04] they have no work to do as long as he
[1:01:06] busts mysteries on them as long as they
[1:01:08] press the history on them
[1:01:09] as long as we bring the revelation to
[1:01:10] them they chill
[1:01:13] and they sit on the premises
[1:01:16] instead of understanding you have to
[1:01:18] bring an atmosphere
[1:01:20] you have to bring a revival you have to
[1:01:22] get fire
[1:01:23] and you have to start in your house
[1:01:26] don't come here and start it you know
[1:01:27] start it in your house bring it from
[1:01:29] your house to the church i'm not hearing

[1:01:32] [Applause]
[1:01:35] i don't know if i can get you half of
[1:01:36] this
[1:01:39] bring it from your house
[1:01:43] it's a quarrel in your house bring it
[1:01:45] there

[1:01:49] coral but deal with it go and pray
[1:01:52] satan i hear you i see you
[1:01:56] i understand how you're moving but i'm

[1:02:08] atmosphere in my house

[1:02:38] church is doing
[1:02:40] and what other person is doing i am an
[1:02:42] emergency road
[1:02:44] and when you have emergency conditions
[1:02:46] you have to take emergency
[1:02:48] action so if you see me be even a little
[1:02:50] crazy
[1:02:51] forgive me and excuse me but this is not
[1:02:54] normal times
[1:02:55] and the sermon can be like normal
[1:02:57] sermons i have come to preach no normal
[1:02:59] message
[1:03:00] i have no normal expectation for this
[1:03:03] morning i'm sorry about that
[1:03:05] i am seeing something great something
[1:03:07] awesome
[1:03:08] something supernatural something
[1:03:10] powerful
[1:03:11] oh glory to god under this seventh seal
[1:03:14] that have to do with you and i
[1:03:16] and the devil is clueless because you
[1:03:18] don't know what on the deer
[1:03:21] oh he can't look on the deer he can't go
[1:03:24] under here
[1:03:24] he can't get an invite

[1:03:31] shout

[1:03:42] glory to god yes yes yes
[1:03:46] this is for you this is your message
[1:03:51] this is the prize message not loose ends
[1:03:54] not six seals but the seventh seal
[1:03:56] what's under there
[1:03:59] let's be seated so i hope it doesn't
[1:04:01] sound complex it shouldn't
[1:04:03] you are so plain and simple you're gonna
[1:04:06] bring it to you today
[1:04:08] hallelujah he said what we got right now
[1:04:12] we can hardly do it
[1:04:13] we have got to step further we can't
[1:04:15] have
[1:04:16] enough faith for divine healing hardly
[1:04:20] we have got to have enough faith
[1:04:23] to be changed you ever making something
[1:04:26] home and you don't have enough sugar
[1:04:28] or flour you can't finish make it
[1:04:31] you have to leave all the mixture dear
[1:04:33] go to the grocery
[1:04:35] buy what you need to have enough of it
[1:04:38] because you'll make it with what you
[1:04:39] have it didn't come out right
[1:04:43] so we have to have enough say enough
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:50] so if it's anybody supposed to be hungry
[1:04:52] is the bright
[1:04:54] the wise version want extra oil she want
[1:04:57] to have
[1:04:58] enough the foolish versions on
[1:05:01] run out
[1:05:07] so when they come here you have to come
[1:05:09] empty
[1:05:11] oh god i'm hungry oh i ain't no i ain't
[1:05:14] nothing
[1:05:15] i need him i need him i need him
[1:05:18] if you don't i do i come in here hungry
[1:05:22] every service
[1:05:23] looking for him every service i know
[1:05:26] you're gonna ride in one day
[1:05:28] maybe today's the day i don't know what
[1:05:31] if today is the day
[1:05:33] what the day is your day what's he
[1:05:35] coming to you today
[1:05:37] are you ready for him what if today's
[1:05:40] your day of healing
[1:05:41] what if the days are due of deliverance
[1:05:42] think about it now it's not just letter
[1:05:45] letter word word word
[1:05:46] what is the day of power coming to you
[1:05:51] all right so watch we have got to have
[1:05:55] enough faith to be changed in a moment
[1:05:57] and be swept up
[1:05:58] of this earth and we will find after a
[1:06:00] while the lord will
[1:06:01] find ways written what written by the
[1:06:03] thunders
[1:06:04] are written he's talking about the
[1:06:06] messenger to come
[1:06:07] he's come for the gentile dispensation
[1:06:09] is to be finished with the church age
[1:06:11] and then this anointed messenger arrived
[1:06:14] of course
[1:06:15] he will plant the seed of the entire
[1:06:17] bible
[1:06:19] plum from serpent to the messenger
[1:06:20] uniform marine your plant what
[1:06:23] the seed of the entire bible
[1:06:28] and the secret is what the word is in
[1:06:31] the bride right
[1:06:32] so when that seed is in you the law of
[1:06:36] genesis 1 11 says what every seed
[1:06:39] bring forth after its kind so that's
[1:06:42] seed of the entire bible
[1:06:44] and there are three bibles right the
[1:06:45] zodiac this bible here
[1:06:47] and the pyramid so this seed what we
[1:06:49] preach and becomes
[1:06:50] that pyramid in you
[1:06:54] you can't put this bible in you this
[1:06:55] physical rhetoric can't go in you
[1:06:59] unless you have a real good operating
[1:07:01] doctor
[1:07:03] cut you open push it back inside you and
[1:07:04] tell the people that you're packing the
[1:07:06] word
[1:07:07] that's not how we go inside of you the
[1:07:09] words that jesus speak
[1:07:12] he said they are spirit and they are
[1:07:14] life
[1:07:15] so this text is not just text this is
[1:07:18] spirit given words
[1:07:19] so this word coming to you and form that
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:25] give the lord a shout under do you
[1:07:27] understand that
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:30] let me go a little further the mystery
[1:07:32] of god
[1:07:34] comes down from god as the word of god
[1:07:37] and reveal the revelation of god and
[1:07:39] christ
[1:07:40] is him in his own word
[1:07:44] so theologians reading this text and
[1:07:45] christ is saturday and they can't seem
[1:07:47] at all
[1:07:48] they only see in greek and hebrew
[1:07:53] and all kind of understanding and text
[1:07:55] and they're reading so
[1:07:56] and uh an ordinary believer pick up a
[1:07:58] scripture and christ
[1:08:00] christ says jesus look look look
[1:08:03] look me here you're spitting here in the
[1:08:05] psalms you see him

[1:08:51] still trying to break a bridge from
[1:08:53] sunday to here watch this here
[1:08:57] i hope i conclude with this
[1:09:00] we are do you believe we are living in
[1:09:01] the last days
[1:09:03] when the son of man wants to be
[1:09:04] manifested
[1:09:06] that would be all the word that's
[1:09:09] gathered up to luther
[1:09:11] wesley and all that and the pentecostal
[1:09:15] all gathered up into revelation of what
[1:09:17] it has been
[1:09:18] you see because all the ages already
[1:09:20] passed so what
[1:09:22] god offered to us is to reflect
[1:09:26] and show the clarity of what has gone in
[1:09:28] the past ages
[1:09:30] that we could look back where we are at
[1:09:32] it become like i could stand up here now
[1:09:35] and look back and see my children and
[1:09:38] see grandchildren
[1:09:39] you if all i'm saying then i can look
[1:09:41] back to the years
[1:09:43] because i'm reaching a certain stage in
[1:09:44] my life right now where my life has
[1:09:46] unfolded to this
[1:09:48] first was one me and one wife after
[1:09:52] then three little ones two little ones
[1:09:54] get big
[1:09:55] then them have little ones you and sam
[1:09:57] saying so now when we stand here we can
[1:09:59] look back and see the trail
[1:10:01] right so there are seven ages that was a
[1:10:04] mystery nobody knew
[1:10:05] they were reading that in simple form
[1:10:07] unto the church of ephesus i was just
[1:10:08] allowed these here
[1:10:09] but now we come to the end a prophet
[1:10:11] come and open the scroll
[1:10:13] and roll it out and say look this
[1:10:16] happened
[1:10:17] this happened that happened that
[1:10:19] happened
[1:10:20] and as you see it you want to know where
[1:10:22] we act
[1:10:24] because we at the end when it's unfold
[1:10:27] like this they recognize the cliff is
[1:10:28] right there we are the end
[1:10:31] there is no more ages okay the lord i
[1:10:34] shout
[1:10:36] glory to god there is no more ages
[1:10:40] this is not the asia born arrow and
[1:10:42] slingshot
[1:10:46] the last hundred years has been the most
[1:10:49] potent
[1:10:50] since man is on the earth in terms of
[1:10:54] inventions and computer and technology
[1:10:58] right now they could track a fly
[1:11:03] there's nothing they can do right now
[1:11:05] look how long the prophet got the vision
[1:11:07] he said which must come to pass
[1:11:09] cars driving on their own he says
[1:11:12] sensors
[1:11:14] a vision he saw it way back then
[1:11:17] 1933 he said this have to happen before
[1:11:19] jesus come
[1:11:21] no the technology is right it is here
[1:11:25] no cheers could come but the bride has
[1:11:29] to be made ready
[1:11:30] it's not just technology you have to
[1:11:32] improve you have to improve
[1:11:34] oh give the lord a shadow looked at me

[1:14:26] you see that giant i will take
[1:14:30] his head off
[1:14:31] [Music]
[1:14:36] i don't want to take nobody hell of it
[1:14:39] somebody giant in your life
[1:14:41] you have to see your giant you have to
[1:14:44] see what is binding you what
[1:14:45] affecting your freedom and liberty oh
[1:14:48] hallelujah my
[1:14:49] lord help me jesus
[1:14:54] all right let's go
[1:14:57] now there are seven five sevens in god's
[1:15:00] plan of redemption now watch
[1:15:02] there are seven seals or seven
[1:15:06] stages in this great plan of redemption
[1:15:08] now remember redemption
[1:15:10] to redeem is to bring you back to bring
[1:15:13] you back you have to be dear before
[1:15:17] if it wasn't there before you can't go
[1:15:19] back we were there before
[1:15:21] because adam represented us so that's
[1:15:24] why we had to go back to eden
[1:15:28] that is why like if you put ink and
[1:15:30] bleach it disappears
[1:15:31] and that's what the blood of jesus does
[1:15:33] you have to cancel all your sin and your
[1:15:35] issues
[1:15:36] to justify you later as if you never did
[1:15:40] sin
[1:15:42] because going back to even mean going
[1:15:44] back before the fall
[1:15:49] so that's why moses was like almost like
[1:15:52] a test run
[1:15:53] of what it is to have a man that could
[1:15:55] speak flies and speak frogs as if he is
[1:15:57] god
[1:16:00] and that was not the blood of jesus that
[1:16:02] was the blood of bulls and goats
[1:16:04] caused a sinful man an angry man a
[1:16:06] temper man like moses
[1:16:08] to speak for flogs and fries
[1:16:11] what would the blood of jesus do
[1:16:15] that justify us as if
[1:16:20] we never did it and by
[1:16:23] revelation you never did it
[1:16:27] because you are joseph nothing against
[1:16:30] him
[1:16:32] that is god in you the word working his
[1:16:36] way out
[1:16:37] [Applause]
[1:16:37] [Music]
[1:16:39] so the devil got deceived because god
[1:16:42] dropped the seed in you
[1:16:44] and that seed of a life in itself
[1:16:47] starting to work its way out
[1:16:49] and when the life in the seed in you
[1:16:52] connects with the life on the out
[1:16:54] something going to happen inside because
[1:16:57] your body is in between
[1:17:00] fire on the inside
[1:17:01] [Applause]
[1:17:05] i don't know how much you know about
[1:17:07] long time before it had stove has been
[1:17:09] no stove
[1:17:10] i have a cool pot and i put it bake
[1:17:14] i have fire on top and fire below
[1:17:17] and the beak in between and you're
[1:17:20] waiting is fire on top and fire below
[1:17:23] and think cooking in between that's what
[1:17:25] we're talking about now
[1:17:26] fire will be on your inside fire coming
[1:17:29] around your outside
[1:17:31] and we shall be changed
[1:17:34] in a moment oh glory to god this motel
[1:17:38] will put on immortality
[1:17:40] this corruption will put on incorruption
[1:17:42] you shall be changed
[1:17:44] oh is this fairy tale or this for real
[1:17:47] man i believe this better than
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:55] [Applause]
[1:17:56] i trust this word more than my senses
[1:18:00] i believe in god for this because i know
[1:18:02] when things begin to shake
[1:18:04] when los angeles sings not if when it
[1:18:07] sinks
[1:18:08] what do you think will happen to america
[1:18:09] economy what do you think china will do
[1:18:12] and russia will do
[1:18:13] and the opportunities that they have
[1:18:15] when they see america is full
[1:18:19] but abandoned preachers called the
[1:18:20] invasion of the usa and you wonder if
[1:18:23] it's real if it's
[1:18:24] physical spiritual you talk about the
[1:18:25] vision of devils we also say
[1:18:27] imagine when russia say stop you stop
[1:18:30] what you're doing we'll take charge or
[1:18:32] we'll shoot you down wherever it is it's
[1:18:33] over choice america has
[1:18:35] think about it what choice do they have
[1:18:38] right now
[1:18:39] if if back in if pakistan get a vaccine
[1:18:44] america will pay whatever they want to
[1:18:45] pay to get the vaccine to
[1:18:47] inoculate the people that's the power of
[1:18:50] having the answer
[1:18:56] that is the power of having the cure
[1:18:59] so you could understand why the prophet
[1:19:01] said the world
[1:19:03] will bow at the feet
[1:19:07] of men and women who have crossed jordan
[1:19:11] [Music]
[1:19:12] [Applause]
[1:19:18] hallelujah god breaks
[1:19:22] the seals on the back of the book
[1:19:26] oh glory to god that's jordan

[1:30:54] hit seven but that number something good
[1:30:57] but then nobody might be here when i
[1:31:00] finish

[1:31:42] that means elijah going to pack all the
[1:31:44] mysteries in him
[1:31:46] let's pull back a bit to adam what
[1:31:47] animal was supposed to do call names
[1:31:50] because adam had the book you know it
[1:31:53] was the book of names
[1:31:54] so adam was supposed to call you into
[1:31:57] existence
[1:31:58] as a spoken word son
[1:32:02] born of the word
[1:32:07] when adam fell we fell along to sex
[1:32:13] born of a woman let's continue but when
[1:32:16] jesus comes he says you have to be born
[1:32:18] again
[1:32:20] of what of the word and of spirit
[1:32:24] which bring you back to how adam was
[1:32:26] supposed to have you
[1:32:30] come on come on come on come on
[1:32:34] so when you talk about born again you
[1:32:36] actually have gone back to the original
[1:32:42] born again of the spoken word which is
[1:32:45] the original seed
[1:32:48] adam was a seed he was supposed to bring
[1:32:50] forth asset is kind
[1:32:52] when god finished christ he is called
[1:32:53] the creation god has seen nothing like
[1:32:55] him he said let us make man in our image
[1:32:57] god put an image and likeness intent and
[1:33:00] purpose i put a man there a spirit man
[1:33:04] [Music]
[1:33:07] and that man fell that man wasn't the
[1:33:10] holy ghost you know he was like the holy
[1:33:11] ghost he wasn't the only ghost
[1:33:13] holy ghost can fall
[1:33:18] let me say it again the holy ghost can't
[1:33:20] fall adam fell
[1:33:22] because he was in the image of
[1:33:28] when he fell the authority of the book
[1:33:30] slipped his hands
[1:33:32] and satan was squatting because he get
[1:33:34] kicked out he have access to heaven's
[1:33:36] portal oh they say heavens gallery
[1:33:41] but we're talking about the mind pure
[1:33:43] business up there
[1:33:45] and complaining and sons up there look
[1:33:47] what they're doing look what they do
[1:33:48] when complaining
[1:33:48] they call the accuser of the bedroom so
[1:33:51] he have what they call the accuser
[1:33:53] gallery
[1:33:56] you have a special place you can step up
[1:33:58] i said i see them or see them
[1:34:00] see what's smoking you see that yukiya
[1:34:02] bless them
[1:34:05] are you see it look at here i could play
[1:34:07] it back for you
[1:34:11] and he doing that day and night yeah
[1:34:14] where am i
[1:34:15] all over the earth you're looking for
[1:34:16] saints you're looking for you're looking
[1:34:17] for what they're doing
[1:34:18] he's he's looking over you
[1:34:23] some of them people look at me very
[1:34:24] strange and like it's real
[1:34:26] yeah but you're saying my blood
[1:34:30] my blood my blood
[1:34:33] my blood you better have blood there for
[1:34:36] you you know
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:34:39] because jesus blood is what covering you
[1:34:41] and i
[1:34:43] without breath be finished
[1:34:48] you see satan can't get god to come for
[1:34:50] your sonship
[1:34:52] because sonship can be cancelled
[1:34:55] but he'll get you to mess up to screw up
[1:34:57] your blessing
[1:34:58] because blessing could be delayed but
[1:35:00] not denied it
[1:35:01] [Applause]
[1:35:03] oh give the lord a shout come on now
[1:35:07] so the purpose of getting in all kind of
[1:35:09] stuff
[1:35:10] is to affect the blessing because the
[1:35:12] blessing comes to laws
[1:35:18] the power comes to laws also
[1:35:21] that's why i told the prophet be more
[1:35:22] sincere it comes to certain laws
[1:35:25] he wants something from you hallelujah
[1:35:28] be more sincere
[1:35:30] the outside will not see in that god
[1:35:31] seeing that you see that certain things
[1:35:34] outside could see
[1:35:35] but that's something god could see what
[1:35:37] you have to be interested in is what god
[1:35:38] has seen in you
[1:35:41] yeah you could act in front of your
[1:35:43] husband you could act in front of your
[1:35:44] wife
[1:35:44] but what god sees in you that's the most
[1:35:47] important thing
[1:35:49] oh glory to god because he's giving the
[1:35:51] liberty to go before god
[1:35:53] when that man was saved a sentence that
[1:35:55] he was about to die
[1:35:57] oh glory to god god say make up your bed

[1:47:16] it's your spirit
[1:47:20] he said you could talk to somebody in
[1:47:21] five minutes know if there's a question
[1:47:22] it's by your spirit
[1:47:31] he said absolutely would live in an
[1:47:33] individual i'll take one leave one i'll
[1:47:34] take this and leave this one
[1:47:36] no strings no denominations
[1:47:39] no bindings or nothing it's the heart
[1:47:42] with god and him alone no strings and a
[1:47:45] title or group

[1:47:47] not titan no headquarters not tied to
[1:47:50] anybody
[1:47:51] i happen on spider-man or even a web
[1:48:00] north strings you're connected to god
[1:48:05] to resource them to headquarters
[1:48:09] okay what we've seen in this day the
[1:48:12] quickening power has come to us
[1:48:13] to open the seven seals
[1:48:16] what was the intel what was that the
[1:48:18] intelligence of man no
[1:48:19] the quickening power of god see the
[1:48:22] quicken power foretold
[1:48:23] what would take place oh blessed be the
[1:48:26] name of the lord you love him
[1:48:28] o praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:48:33] so the seven thunders which are seven
[1:48:36] voices
[1:48:38] seals the book they hold
[1:48:42] the secret or the mysteries
[1:48:45] that are hidden in the book
[1:48:48] the book written within its
[1:48:52] six seal mystery is revealed or unfolded
[1:48:56] by revelation 10 7 the seventh angels
[1:48:59] messenger
[1:49:00] to the seventh each age of revelation
[1:49:02] three
[1:49:03] even the prophet of malachi 4 and the
[1:49:04] person of william aaron branham
[1:49:07] a star on the right hand of god seven
[1:49:10] voices
[1:49:12] seven spirits to reveal or
[1:49:15] unfold to make manifest the book
[1:49:19] now when they asked brother branham
[1:49:20] about what was outside the book he said
[1:49:22] cannot be something outside the book
[1:49:24] because you can add to the book it has
[1:49:26] to be something hidden in the book
[1:49:29] so the seven voices is to reveal what is
[1:49:33] hidden
[1:49:34] he said it cannot be something outside
[1:49:36] of the book because god can't do that
[1:49:38] it has to be something that are hidden
[1:49:40] in the book therefore
[1:49:42] the prophet took the thunders
[1:49:46] that was uttered in revelation 10 3 and
[1:49:48] 4
[1:49:49] and slide it under revelation 8 1.
[1:49:55] and that's why i read for you he already
[1:49:57] prophesied and said
[1:49:58] when the seventh seal break and open
[1:50:02] you'll find it in version 10.
[1:50:05] so that night that seven seal night
[1:50:08] he came and he said
[1:50:12] it unfolded but i only see one fold of
[1:50:15] it
[1:50:16] and the four he saw was seven thunders
[1:50:18] uttering one two three four five six
[1:50:20] seven
[1:50:21] banging in that order let's continue now
[1:50:24] therefore the prophet put the thunders
[1:50:27] that was uttered in version 10 3 and 4
[1:50:30] and slid it on the revolution 8 1
[1:50:32] silence
[1:50:33] for this piece of half an hour o praise
[1:50:36] the name of the lord
[1:50:37] so while heaven the angel
[1:50:40] lamb taken the book and things unfolding
[1:50:43] in heaven
[1:50:45] something happened in the earth god set
[1:50:48] another prophet to catch the book
[1:50:50] because if version 10 the angel brings
[1:50:52] down the book
[1:50:53] somebody must be on the earth to catch
[1:50:56] the book
[1:50:58] isn't that right the scriptures cannot
[1:51:00] be broken
[1:51:02] john was on the earth isn't that right
[1:51:04] the voice said come up in the spirit
[1:51:06] you begin to see things unfold first
[1:51:08] seal
[1:51:09] second seal third seal fourth seal
[1:51:13] six seals now the devil i have written
[1:51:16] here is the respiration i wrote
[1:51:17] is not intimidated by the first six
[1:51:19] seals or by 16 ministers
[1:51:22] or by ministers who preach this message
[1:51:25] under the anointing of loose ends
[1:51:27] what intimidates the devil is the
[1:51:31] seventh
[1:51:31] seal because he
[1:51:34] don't know what it is he don't
[1:51:37] understand it
[1:51:38] because the seventh seal is the seal of
[1:51:42] life the life of elohim
[1:51:46] seven perfect spirits that connects with
[1:51:49] the coming of the lord
[1:51:51] oh glory to god that's why the seventh
[1:51:52] seal is connected to the coming of the
[1:51:55] lord
[1:51:55] because the seventh seed brings them
[1:51:56] back who is he the capstone
[1:52:02] so them seven thunders have to be
[1:52:04] connected with the seven steps
[1:52:07] to bring back the capstone and that will
[1:52:10] be christ
[1:52:10] coming isn't that right

[1:52:17] couldn't touch or denominate
[1:52:21] this is the book in the book all that
[1:52:24] get to the book

[1:56:27] captains and the mighty men and every
[1:56:28] bond man every free man
[1:56:30] hid themselves in the dens and the rocks
[1:56:32] and the mountains sit on the mountains
[1:56:33] and rocks fall on us
[1:56:34] hide us from the face of him that sits
[1:56:37] on the throne from the wrath of the lamb
[1:56:39] for the great day of his right to come
[1:56:40] who shall be able to stand
[1:56:42] this is six years here up today the six
[1:56:44] seals
[1:56:46] and it's interesting because the numbers
[1:56:48] by the cliff
[1:56:49] was perfect this is the sixth chapter
[1:56:53] and it closed out the six seals
[1:56:56] when you go to chapter seven that's an
[1:56:58] interruption
[1:57:04] chapter seven is an interruption and
[1:57:06] chapter seven
[1:57:08] interrupts with after these things i saw
[1:57:11] four angels stand the of
[1:57:12] it stopping the four winds the angel
[1:57:15] from the east
[1:57:16] identifying the jews to be sealed watch
[1:57:19] how god numbers working
[1:57:21] so chapter six reveal up to six years
[1:57:24] chapter seven
[1:57:25] is an interruption and then you go to
[1:57:26] chapter eight
[1:57:30] when you open the seventh seal there was
[1:57:33] silence
[1:57:34] oh my first piece of half an hour
[1:57:37] hallelujah
[1:57:38] praise god and look at chapter seven
[1:57:42] after all the robes they tried to
[1:57:45] identify
[1:57:46] and if we see them said and all the
[1:57:47] interested around the throne
[1:57:49] and about the elders four beasts and
[1:57:50] fell down at the throne
[1:57:52] on their faces and worshiped god saying
[1:57:54] blessing and glory and wisdom and
[1:57:56] thanksgiving and honor
[1:57:57] and power so a lot of noise
[1:58:00] a lot of activity in heaven a lot of
[1:58:03] shouting
[1:58:04] and praising and worshiping that is in
[1:58:07] chapter seven
[1:58:09] and all of a sudden i could imagine the
[1:58:11] tension now because six seal already
[1:58:13] gone
[1:58:14] there's an interruption with his vision
[1:58:16] of the four angels
[1:58:17] are you with me of the angel from the
[1:58:20] east
[1:58:20] of all these tribes being sealed and
[1:58:22] instead of worship and rejoice and thank
[1:58:24] god
[1:58:25] and all of a sudden and when he had
[1:58:27] opened the seventh sea there was silence
[1:58:30] it was a shocking thing he said they
[1:58:32] were owed by
[1:58:33] it all heaven all the activity just
[1:58:36] stopped
[1:58:37] all of a sudden it stopped silence
[1:58:41] for half an hour oh glory to god
[1:58:45] and that opening of the seventh seal is
[1:58:47] revealed or unfolded in revelation 10.
[1:58:50] so from there you go to 10 i saw another
[1:58:53] mighty angel
[1:58:54] come down from heaven with a book open
[1:58:58] all seals broke now oh glory to god
[1:59:01] where was those voices in him
[1:59:04] and he opened his mouth the book was
[1:59:08] open
[1:59:09] all the written mysteries was open but
[1:59:12] when he opened his mouth
[1:59:14] as when a lion roared seven
[1:59:17] thunders seven thunders
[1:59:21] threw their voices out it was irregular
[1:59:24] voices
[1:59:25] this is supernatural voices
[1:59:32] i'm about to write just seal it don't
[1:59:33] write it
[1:59:35] oh my hallelujah
[1:59:38] oh glory to god thank you lord jesus
[1:59:43] the worship activity in heaven noise in
[1:59:46] heaven
[1:59:47] has been identified these are days who
[1:59:50] come out the great tribulation this is
[1:59:51] revelation chapter seven
[1:59:53] and then you go to revelations chapter
[1:59:54] eight all this taken place in heaven
[1:59:56] and in the meantime something is taking
[1:59:59] place on earth
[2:00:00] a prophet is getting ready prepared by a
[2:00:03] vision
[2:00:04] that came and a message preached
[2:00:07] december 30th 1962
[2:00:09] says what time is it so he had the
[2:00:11] prophecy the prophetic utterance
[2:00:13] and vision he identified his church and
[2:00:16] now he's going to connect with his
[2:00:17] angels now
[2:00:19] are you with me hallelujah then he went
[2:00:22] now
[2:00:23] to the open of the seals on it
[2:00:26] sees breaking heaven now they break into
[2:00:29] it now
[2:00:30] and that seize was on march 18 1963
[2:00:33] to march 24th 1963
[2:00:37] but before the first seal was unfolded
[2:00:40] there were two messages preached before
[2:00:43] he opened the first seal
[2:00:45] the morning of march the 17th he
[2:00:48] preached god
[2:00:49] hiding himself in simplicity then
[2:00:51] revealed himself in the same
[2:00:53] and that evening 1963 17th march
[2:00:57] he preached the breach between the 70
[2:00:59] changes
[2:01:01] and the seven seals then for march 18
[2:01:04] full seal then second seal to the sixth
[2:01:07] seal
[2:01:08] on march 23rd after the sixth seal
[2:01:13] there was an interruption instead of
[2:01:15] preaching the seventh seal
[2:01:18] in the morning he preached question and
[2:01:21] answers
[2:01:22] on the seals and then in the evening of
[2:01:25] march 24th
[2:01:27] he preached the seventh seal the devil
[2:01:30] was
[2:01:30] clueless because the silence was on
[2:01:34] and he said when the seventh seed break
[2:01:36] it starts in silence
[2:01:38] but at the finishing of the seventh seal
[2:01:40] you're supposed to be all the way up
[2:01:42] here
[2:01:43] to know who god is how he lives
[2:01:46] his being his nature oh glory to god
[2:01:50] hallelujah and i say this morning the
[2:01:53] devil is clueless still
[2:01:56] and if i get the time and i'm going to
[2:01:58] read it for you
[2:01:59] where he said the prophet said it's the
[2:02:00] turtle and the devil don't understand it
[2:02:03] he just can't get it so let me just
[2:02:05] continue he is the one who opened those
[2:02:07] seals
[2:02:08] he is those seals for the whole word of
[2:02:11] god is christ
[2:02:13] and christ is the seals that was opened
[2:02:17] what is the open of the seals then
[2:02:18] revealing christ
[2:02:20] first six seals as loose ends mysteries
[2:02:23] to be tied up
[2:02:24] and then a hidden mystery of christ
[2:02:26] himself
[2:02:28] that is only for his wife
[2:02:33] could the wife say amen this morning
[2:02:38] don't say you're not worthy and i'm
[2:02:39] thinking i don't go there
[2:02:41] don't go there because you say you don't
[2:02:43] have to you know you have not chosen me
[2:02:46] he said i have chosen you so don't try
[2:02:49] to pick yourself he chose you
[2:02:51] and he chose you as you are not that
[2:02:54] you're going to remain as you are he
[2:02:55] chose you as you are
[2:02:57] because you will become his wife
[2:03:00] remember when this full revelation break
[2:03:02] only his wife
[2:03:04] could make herself ready because the
[2:03:07] wife will catch a revelation of
[2:03:08] preparation
[2:03:10] or give the lord a shout now
[2:03:16] you see i keep thinking how do you get a
[2:03:19] people
[2:03:20] that have been sitting for 50 plus years
[2:03:23] listen to messages
[2:03:24] listen to preachers listen to teachers
[2:03:25] listen to revelation how you could get
[2:03:27] them
[2:03:28] activated to begin to act upon what they
[2:03:31] hear
[2:03:32] someone never become very arrogant
[2:03:33] somebody very annoyed all cattle and
[2:03:35] nothing
[2:03:36] and last service which is something you
[2:03:38] should listen to tie up the loose sense
[2:03:40] but i'm talking about make yourself a
[2:03:42] christian
[2:03:45] you're not born a christian fight as a
[2:03:46] christian you're christian too we're
[2:03:47] here that from where you get it from
[2:03:48] god on a grandchildren it doesn't work
[2:03:50] soon
[2:03:52] you have to become a christian go to the
[2:03:55] samurai against the wall
[2:03:57] and you do yeah are you capable because
[2:03:58] this happened when god took away brahm's
[2:04:01] wife
[2:04:03] and the daughter was next little baby
[2:04:04] daughter when the wife dead and gone the
[2:04:07] devil telling brother branham
[2:04:08] you're
[2:04:18] people in the flood rescuing people
[2:04:21] and his own family perishing
[2:04:24] and the devil he said he started
[2:04:26] listening davis had to tell him things
[2:04:27] that i write
[2:04:28] he said look at that little baby day and
[2:04:30] you say god is a god of love
[2:04:33] i explain he's playing up here there's
[2:04:35] all these senses to anoint all these
[2:04:37] senses
[2:04:38] and emotions and things and he said
[2:04:40] something in him
[2:04:42] then that he thinking and figured okay
[2:04:44] how to deal with this no it wasn't
[2:04:46] something in him says the lord gave
[2:04:52] now you see we could say amen to these
[2:04:54] things i talk about me too
[2:04:55] but when you're going through the
[2:04:56] process it's not easy you know
[2:05:02] [Applause]
[2:05:05] it's not nice to lose our loved ones and
[2:05:07] with a loved one you know
[2:05:09] he was young but he didn't listen to the
[2:05:12] lord
[2:05:14] and the lord was disciplining him
[2:05:18] not punishing him
[2:05:22] so when an adoption he said he could
[2:05:24] take your wife again you could turn your
[2:05:25] wife against you
[2:05:28] i know people might even want to see him
[2:05:29] into that but that's okay let's continue
[2:05:31] he could turn your husband against you
[2:05:33] he could take nature he can turn the
[2:05:34] church against you that's the easy one
[2:05:36] you know you'll just walk in that church
[2:05:37] and escape
[2:05:40] you overcome the test no virgin
[2:05:44] supposedly children who changed against
[2:05:45] me now they gone
[2:05:48] no i still got silly wood
[2:05:51] he could do this he could do that he
[2:05:52] could cast about a sickness what do you
[2:05:54] say
[2:05:56] all of this is adoption tests and when
[2:05:59] god finished with him he was still a
[2:06:00] prophet
[2:06:01] he was still a servant of god he lost
[2:06:04] there not even five years and he had
[2:06:05] curse
[2:06:07] i think other than five years nobody got
[2:06:09] healed because he didn't have the
[2:06:10] anointing
[2:06:12] but he still saved god he tried to shoot
[2:06:14] himself shut him shoot himself and the
[2:06:16] bullet wouldn't go off
[2:06:18] he didn't try one center more than once
[2:06:21] and when he finished
[2:06:22] with that foolishness and he shoot the
[2:06:23] bullet went off
[2:06:25] god can stop bullets
[2:06:30] god could hijack your disaster plan
[2:06:33] [Applause]
[2:06:38] yes god could hijack your your
[2:06:40] destructive element
[2:06:42] to protect you from yourself because he
[2:06:44] purposed to get glory out of your life
[2:06:47] devil can rob you of that he can't
[2:06:50] cancel what god raised you up for
[2:06:53] moses run over 40 years and that and
[2:06:55] that commission was not cancelled he was
[2:06:58] waiting to be activated by pillar of
[2:06:59] fire
[2:07:00] and the purifier couldn't meet him in
[2:07:02] egypt it had a museum on the back side
[2:07:05] there's something about that backside
[2:07:07] there were seven seals on the back side

[2:24:56] and this was spoken uh
[2:25:02] i think 1963 but but but in what shall i
[2:25:05] do which is called the christ he said
[2:25:06] the first thing
[2:25:07] no right yes this is the 24th of
[2:25:10] november 1963
[2:25:12] but the rapture just before barbara died
[2:25:15] the 12th of the 4th of december 1965
[2:25:18] he said the first thing comes he starts
[2:25:21] descending
[2:25:22] from heaven after reading thessalonians
[2:25:24] 4 16

[2:25:40] get the people together
[2:25:41] what the seven thunders were supposed to
[2:25:43] do guarded the bride together
[2:25:46] so then you see the first fall of the
[2:25:48] shout
[2:25:49] of the seven seals the seven thunders
[2:25:51] and that
[2:25:52] seven thunders was not identified in the
[2:25:54] coming of the lord

[2:26:22] doesn't have life
[2:26:23] he says back to the word he said they
[2:26:25] are built so many systems around the
[2:26:27] world
[2:26:28] he says it's back to the word so life
[2:26:31] systems doesn't have
[2:26:32] life it's only god's word it has life
[2:26:36] so the systems is built around it but it
[2:26:38] doesn't have
[2:26:39] life and it has to comfort something
[2:26:41] that cannot be denominated
[2:26:43] the entire seed has to come forth see
[2:26:46] how they nominated on one word and
[2:26:48] another word in another word
[2:26:49] there's got to be something that cannot
[2:26:51] be denominated
[2:26:52] it is the entirety of the life that's in
[2:26:56] there
[2:26:57] has to produce itself again on a bride
[2:27:00] so you get it now the life itself
[2:27:02] cannot be dominated and here is where i
[2:27:04] get the believers will be called out
[2:27:06] the true believers listen to this notice
[2:27:09] here
[2:27:10] the life that was in the stork and
[2:27:13] castle
[2:27:14] also end up in the seed the life comes
[2:27:16] out of the original seed
[2:27:18] come to different processes the seven
[2:27:20] ages three different processes and then
[2:27:22] turns back to its original condition
[2:27:24] i am the happiest person in the world
[2:27:26] that god will let me see this
[2:27:28] because this is a hidden mystery that
[2:27:30] god will put the seed in you
[2:27:32] let it unfold and then it comes back to
[2:27:34] the original life
[2:27:35] isn't that right they waited the ages
[2:27:37] seed rendon in the ground
[2:27:39] and then god reproduced that seed isn't
[2:27:40] that right three stages
[2:27:42] hallelujah praise god amen all right
[2:27:45] let me just skip here now
[2:27:52] oh here we go there is not okay when it
[2:27:55] comes forward it looks just like the
[2:27:56] green
[2:27:57] but when the green light begins to leave
[2:28:00] the husk
[2:28:01] to go to make the grain the bride the
[2:28:04] horse open up and excommunicate the
[2:28:05] green
[2:28:06] is that right that's exactly what it is
[2:28:08] now when the seed word begins to grow
[2:28:10] forth
[2:28:11] the husk puts from itself the life
[2:28:15] here we go and i'm close with this are
[2:28:17] we going to continue by god's grace
[2:28:19] the life leaves all
[2:28:23] others to follow it that's the true
[2:28:26] believers
[2:28:28] they follow the life wherever the life
[2:28:31] goes
[2:28:34] oh i'm done for now
[2:28:38] i reach half the message but i want you
[2:28:40] to get that
[2:28:41] the true believers they don't follow
[2:28:44] bishops
[2:28:45] archbishops churches systems

[2:28:52] in the old testament when the pillar

[2:29:12] given the pillar fire instructions

[2:29:16] to god
[2:29:18] when the cloud came down and the cloud
[2:29:20] came down
[2:29:21] god asks the prophet if you're looking
[2:29:22] at the cloud the right way
[2:29:24] he said turn the picture to the right
[2:29:26] and the seven become one
[2:29:28] and one day this same seven
