[6:52] Father, may you bless the service
[6:54] tonight Lord. May your anointing be
[6:56] here. May your Holy Spirit be here. May
[6:59] there be refilling after refilling,
[7:01] Lord. Father, may your Holy Spirit come
[7:03] down upon your young people, upon the
[7:06] children, Lord. Father, may the sick be
[7:08] healed. May the the the wounded be,
[7:11] Lord, the broken up, Lord. May they be
[7:14] uplifted, Lord. Oh God, one of these
[7:18] days a man 66 years in a wheelchair and
[7:22] come by his side. A prophecy was
[7:24] fulfilled and he was healed. May we Lord
[7:28] receive our complete healing. Lord, may
[7:30] the body of Christ receive deliverance,
[7:34] receive healing tonight. Father, I'm
[7:36] another man 38 years. 38 years he was
[7:41] sick, Lord, but you come by his way and
[7:44] he was healed. Another woman at the
[7:46] well, many years lost in the world. Six
[7:49] husbands, but you come by and you change
[7:52] the whole situation. Father, I pray in
[7:54] the name of Jesus Christ, that you may
[7:56] change the whole situation tonight,
[7:59] Lord, and you come by and take a step
[8:01] into this building, Lord, and meet our
[8:03] every need, Lord. That the sick would be
[8:05] free, that the sick would be delivered.
[8:07] Lord, we ask for your blessing, Lord.
[8:10] Father, whatever would be spoken, Lord.
[8:12] Would you bless the specials, Lord?
[8:14] Would you bless the ministers that would
[8:16] be ministering, Lord, that they would be
[8:18] ministering the word according to your
[8:20] word, Lord? you would open their mouths
[8:22] and shut their mouths, Lord, and it
[8:23] would be all to your glory, Father, when
[8:25] we come to the end of the service, Lord.
[8:27] Father, when the ministers will be
[8:29] laying hands upon the people, I pray in
[8:31] the name of Jesus Christ, Lord, you said
[8:33] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[8:35] they shall recover, that there'll be
[8:37] many recover and will not forget, Lord,
[8:39] to encourage one another, that you will
[8:41] come and comfort one another, that we'll
[8:43] see us one one of these days again.
[8:46] Father, we want to be careful and get
[8:48] ready for your coming in this service.
[8:50] That's the reason of this meeting to get
[8:53] ready to meet you again. Lord, we love
[8:56] you and we have one request
[8:59] Lord that you would come Lord and we
[9:02] would be in your
[9:04] presence. Your presence makes all the
[9:08] difference. That's my heart's desire
[9:10] Lord. I just want to be in your presence
[9:14] that you are here Lord and by your
[9:17] word you said that you would be here
[9:21] where 203 are gathered. You said it,
[9:23] Lord, and we believe it, Lord. We stand
[9:26] upon your
[9:28] word and we pray you'd bless this
[9:30] service in Jesus name. Lord, give us
[9:33] strength, Lord, in our tired, weary
[9:35] bodies, Lord. We don't want to miss the
[9:38] service,
[9:39] Lord. But after all has been said and
[9:42] done, Lord, it's you,
[9:45] Jesus Christ. And we want to be
[9:48] careful to give you alone all the glory,
[9:52] all the praise, and tell you how much we
[9:54] love
[9:54] you, how much we thank you for your
[9:57] grace, and how much we thank you for
[9:59] your
[10:00] mercy, and thank you for your presence
[10:02] even right
[10:03] now. We
[10:06] recognize that you're
[10:09] here, Father. We
[10:11] believe. We thank you for what you're
[10:13] doing tonight.
[10:15] We we thank you in advance and we praise
[10:18] your holy name Jesus name. Amen. Why
[10:21] don't you turn around, greet your
[10:23] brother and sister, welcome them to the
[10:24] evening service.
[10:27] These are the specials. Okay, just one
[10:29] special.
[10:30] We have praises and prayer requests.
[10:32] Um just
[10:37] just
[10:39] [Music]
[10:44] pray in your presence. In your presence
[10:47] that's where I
[10:50] belong.
[10:52] Amen. Just share this quickly with you.
[10:55] There was a service we had
[10:57] Easter and I was talking to the Lord.
[11:00] Lord, help me not to do a mistake.
[11:02] Sometimes the anointing is so strong in
[11:04] a service and you just
[11:07] [Music]
[11:08] want to receive what the Lord has for
[11:11] you. I prayed, Lord, how can I what do I
[11:14] need to do? And just something in my
[11:17] heart spoke to me.
[11:19] If I can recognize that he's here, Jesus
[11:23] Christ, then everything's going to be
[11:25] well. And I pray that's what we've come
[11:28] to meet here tonight is Jesus Christ. To
[11:31] be in his presence, that's what matters.
[11:34] Then everything's going to be okay. And
[11:36] he's going to fulfill his word certainly
[11:39] in our midst. Do you believe that? Do
[11:41] you love
[11:42] him? Amen. I just want to sing that
[11:44] song. In your presence, that is where I
[11:48] belong. In your
[11:53] presence, Lord, that's where I
[11:58] belong. In your
[12:03] presence and that's where I am strong.
[12:08] Seeking your face. I'm seeking your
[12:11] face.
[12:13] touching your
[12:16] grace in the cliff of that
[12:18] [Music]
[12:20] rock. In the cliff of the
[12:24] rock, hide me, Jesus Christ.
[12:30] Oh, in your presence, oh
[12:36] God, in your
[12:38] [Music]
[12:42] presence. Oh, that's where I
[12:46] belong. In your
[12:52] presence. Oh
[12:54] Lord, you want
[12:56] healing. Healing is there in his
[12:58] presence.
[13:00] Whatever you
[13:02] need, you can receive it
[13:05] [Music]
[13:08] tonight. But you have to ask
[13:11] him. And that's the time to ask
[13:14] [Music]
[13:17] him in the cliff of the rock.
[13:27] Oh, in your presence, oh
[13:32] God. You can just play
[13:35] softly. Amen. And if the deacons and
[13:37] nurses can come also for the offering
[13:40] just to keep it short, preserve your
[13:42] time if they could already make their
[13:44] way up. We're going to pray then after
[13:47] we've read the word and also pray for
[13:48] the offering together. I want you to
[13:50] take Psalms
[13:52] 103 and it's the prayer line tonight.
[13:59] Amen. God is obligated to meet us on the
[14:02] basis of the
[14:06] word. And it says, "Bless the Lord, oh
[14:09] my
[14:10] soul, and all that is within me, bless
[14:14] his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my
[14:18] soul, and forget not all of his
[14:21] benefits. Who forgiveth all thine
[14:26] iniquities, who health all thy
[14:29] diseases, who redeemth thy life from
[14:31] destruction, and who groundeth thee with
[14:33] love and kindness and tender mercies.
[14:36] Who satisfyth thy mouth with good things
[14:39] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[14:41] eagles. And we'll be reading together
[14:43] verse three again.
[14:45] who forgiveth all thine iniquities, and
[14:49] who health all thy
[14:52] diseases. God bless
[14:55] you. If you could come for the offering
[15:01] collection. Thank you,
[15:06] Jesus. If we only knew what God wants to
[15:09] do
[15:10] tonight and enter in, I'm sure he will
[15:13] do something special tonight. Let us bow
[15:15] our
[15:17] heads. Gracious heavenly father, once
[15:19] again we come before your throne of
[15:21] mercy. Thank you that you forgive us all
[15:24] of our iniquities. That's a
[15:26] good good foundation Lord to come to
[15:30] this approach this prayer line and that
[15:32] you heal all of our diseases. We ask the
[15:35] blessing upon this offering. Bless the
[15:38] people that can give, those that cannot
[15:40] give. May you use it for your glory
[15:43] alone in Jesus Christ's name.
[15:49] Amen. You actually can take a seat, get
[15:53] some
[15:56] strength. Amen. Just want to take this
[15:59] opportunity also to thank you all for
[16:01] your kindness. It's such a privilege to
[16:04] be with you in fellowship. And I believe
[16:08] that there's a portion of the bride of
[16:10] Jesus Christ here gathered in this tent.
[16:14] And it's our blessing for my dad and
[16:19] myself to be here.
[16:22] Amen. Already on this side of the river.
[16:26] We believe we're going to see us again
[16:28] on the other side of the river. How good
[16:30] it is already to meet here together.
[16:33] Certainly we want to show you that we
[16:36] love
[16:37] you. Amen. As the sister Lily Ako Joey
[16:40] would make her way to the front for the
[16:42] for the special of tonight, we have one
[16:46] special. Let's sing a song. Let's talk
[16:48] about
[16:49] Jesus. That was amazing. Brother Bam
[16:52] says when you talk about him, he draws
[16:53] nigh. Yeah,
[16:57] let's talk about
[17:00] Jesus, the King of Kings. Is he the Lord
[17:05] of the Lord
[17:07] supreme throughout
[17:16] [Music]
[17:20] eternity more and more sing about Jesus
[17:25] let's sing about
[17:27] Jesus oh the king of kings I
[17:34] See, oh the great I am, the way, the
[17:40] truth, the life, the
[17:42] door, the truth, the life, the door. Oh,
[17:46] let's talk about
[17:48] Jesus more. And let's clap our hands,
[17:52] hear the musicians.
[18:03] [Music]
[18:10] the great I am. Whatever you need is in
[18:17] him. More and
[18:20] [Laughter]
[18:22] more. It's a beautiful song special.
[18:26] Sister Lily Akojobi is going to be
[18:27] singing about the alabaster box and
[18:31] she's obviously from brother Charles
[18:32] Akujobi's church anointed bride of
[18:34] Christ Assembly. Thank you. Such a
[18:38] beautiful fitting song for tonight.
[18:41] [Music]
[18:47] Thank you.
[18:53] [Music]
[19:19] The room grew
[19:21] still as she made her way to
[19:27] Jesus. She
[19:29] stumbled through the tears that made
[19:33] her life.
[19:37] [Music]
[19:39] She felt such
[19:44] pain, some spoken
[19:47] anger, heard folks
[19:50] whisper, "There's no place here for her
[19:55] kind."
[20:00] Still on she
[20:02] came through the shame that flushed the
[20:07] face until at
[20:10] last she knelt
[20:13] before his
[20:17] feet. And though she spoke no
[20:22] words, everything she said was heard.
[20:28] as she bought her love for the
[20:32] master from her cup of alabaster.
[20:40] And I've come to
[20:46] pour my praise on
[20:49] him like
[20:52] all from
[20:55] Mary's alabaster
[21:00] [Music]
[21:02] box. Don't be
[21:05] angry if I wash his feet with my tears.
[21:11] tears and I dry them with my
[21:18] head.
[21:21] Oh, you were in there.
[21:27] The night he found
[21:30] me, you did not feel what I felt when he
[21:37] wrapped his loving arms around me. And
[21:43] you don't know the
[21:46] cost of the
[21:48] oil in my alabaster.
[21:55] [Music]
[22:03] I can't
[22:07] forget the way life used to be. I was a
[22:13] prisoner to the sins that had me bound.
[22:22] I spent my
[22:25] days pouring my life without
[22:29] measure into a little treasure box. I
[22:34] thought I had found.
[22:39] Oh, until the
[22:42] day when my Jesus came to me and he
[22:48] healed my
[22:50] soul with a wonder of his
[22:55] touch. And now I'm giving back to him.
[23:01] All the praise he's worthy of. I've been
[23:08] forgi and that's
[23:10] why I love him so much.
[23:19] I've come to
[23:23] pour my praise on him like
[23:29] all from
[23:31] Mary's alabaster.
[23:34] [Music]
[23:39] Oh, won't be
[23:41] angry if I wash his feet with my
[23:47] tears and I dry them with my
[23:55] hair. Cuz
[23:57] you were in
[24:00] there the night my Jesus found
[24:05] me. You did not feel what I felt when he
[24:11] wrapped his loving arms around me. And
[24:17] you don't know the
[24:20] cause of the oil.
[24:23] [Music]
[24:25] No, you don't know the
[24:29] cost of my
[24:35] praise. You don't know the
[24:40] cost of
[24:42] your in my
[24:48] pest box.
[24:55] Thank you so
[25:01] [Music]
[25:14] much. There's one thing this woman
[25:18] had. It was love to Jesus Christ.
[25:22] Thank you very much, Sister Lily, for
[25:24] that beautiful
[25:26] [Applause]
[25:29] song. Down from his glory, ever living
[25:32] story. Oh, how I love
[25:37] him. You love him
[25:41] tonight. Oh,
[25:44] how Oh, how I
[25:48] love him.
[25:52] How
[25:54] I adore. Just lift your hands and make
[25:58] love to him
[25:59] tonight. Wash his feet. My
[26:02] breath, my
[26:06] sun. Lord
[26:08] Jesus. You're my
[26:11] all in all.
[26:16] When I'm
[26:17] alone, the
[26:20] great creator.
[26:26] Oh, he
[26:28] became my
[26:35] savior and
[26:37] all God's
[26:40] [Music]
[26:43] fullness
[26:45] dwelling in him. If you know the hymn,
[26:48] then sing it loud. Down from his glory.
[26:51] Down from all his glory.
[26:56] [Music]

[55:11] thank

[55:19] you. So what I have got also to say to
[55:24] my precious friend and
[55:26] brother from
[55:29] Trinidad. He's been such a wonderful
[55:33] trailblazer and he has been able to make
[55:36] it possible for the entire
[55:39] world to have a live broadcast of this
[55:42] meeting. My friend Isaac Oid and your
[55:47] wife, I really appreciate you.
[55:57] I want to tell you this little story
[55:59] about
[56:00] Isaac. I've not been too close to Isaac,
[56:03] but my association with him is with a
[56:05] mystery.
[56:08] 2013 where we had just sat where the
[56:12] ministers were having some
[56:15] fellowship and um the father hinted that
[56:19] Isaac is coming out and um that is why
[56:22] the wife was not in Germany so he has
[56:25] gone to welcome
[56:27] Isaac. So I went to the bathroom in that
[56:30] hotel to ease myself and there the voice
[56:33] of God spoke to
[56:35] me. He said that young man bring him to
[56:40] Calaba convention to
[56:42] testify. So I was a little bit afraid
[56:45] but that voice was very real because it
[56:48] has always been like that the way God
[56:50] ministers to me what he wants to
[56:53] do. And I went I spoke to brother Tio.
[56:57] Would it be nice for Isaac to come over
[57:00] to Calaba to speak to the young
[57:03] people? and he said he would get back to
[57:06] me and later on he said that's fine and
[57:09] that was why we were able to see Isaac
[57:11] and
[57:19] Calaba and from
[57:21] now till eternity Isaac will remain with
[57:24] us.
[57:26] Brother Isaac we love
[57:30] you. Amen.
[57:36] Those of you that have been visiting the
[57:38] website of
[57:40] uh Charity Tac Trinidad, St. Sorry, I'm
[57:45] sorry. Hon Tabernacle
[57:47] Trinidad. You will agree with
[57:50] me. Amen. The architect of what goes
[57:54] there is all
[57:57] compendium of
[58:01] Isaac. what I
[58:04] call I don't know how to explain it
[58:07] but he came with this
[58:10] initiative to really
[58:12] get every word and to let the people to
[58:16] see it read it in short form as much as
[58:20] it can be shown to the entire world to
[58:22] the internet or any of the social
[58:26] uh multimedia systems. So as a matter of
[58:31] fact, we know that the devil is using
[58:34] this forum to catch a lot of young
[58:36] people and Isaac was inspired to put in
[58:40] the word of God there to trap the
[58:42] children of God. Young people, are you
[58:44] happy about
[58:47] that Isaac? You don't need to worry. God
[58:51] is rewarding us and God will reward you.
[58:55] Amen. So the devil can go doing whatever
[58:58] he wants to do. He lost the battle.
[59:02] Praise the Lord.
[59:04] Amen.
[59:05] [Music]
[59:07] We love you, my brother. God richly
[59:09] bless you and your precious wife. We're
[59:12] glad to have you in Enugu. God bless
[59:15] you.
[59:18] So we want to thank the Lord for the
[59:21] song
[59:22] leaders, Brother
[59:30] Femy, my little
[59:33] boy, Brother
[59:35] [Applause]
[59:36] Moses, Brother
[59:40] Johnny. You appreciate them.
[59:52] Amen. You know, I call him my little boy
[59:55] and some of you smiled because now I
[59:57] look at him at an angle of uh elevation
[1:00:00] of almost about
[1:00:02] 70°. But it doesn't matter. No matter
[1:00:05] his height, I still believe that I can
[1:00:08] still climb the
[1:00:09] seat and then draw him closer and still
[1:00:13] discipline him. So that is why he's
[1:00:15] still my little
[1:00:16] boy. Amen. I I thank the Lord for the
[1:00:20] gift of God in his life.
[1:00:23] [Applause]
[1:00:26] Amen. So I want to thank the
[1:00:30] musicians, Joseph
[1:00:35] of

[1:00:48] appreciate all of you. I cannot mention
[1:00:49] all your
[1:00:50] [Applause]
[1:00:54] names. I want to apologize to the young
[1:00:57] people. I really had desired that we

[1:07:28] our precious pastor and brother, Pastor
[1:07:31] Olu Omoto Ibo?
[1:07:46] the culture of
[1:07:48] [Applause]
[1:07:49] silence. When he came on the scene, I
[1:07:52] said, "Oh," he mentioned his title
[1:07:54] again. I said, "Broou had come again
[1:07:56] with another strange title."
[1:08:03] Amen. You agree with me? Whenever he
[1:08:06] picks his title, it's strange.
[1:08:10] But when he comes down to nailing it
[1:08:12] down, brother, you you can now see the
[1:08:14] culture of silence.
[1:08:17] How many appreciate our brother once
[1:08:19] again? Brother Olu, I love you from the
[1:08:22] bottom of my
[1:08:24] heart. I want to thank God for the gift

[1:09:12] rapture. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name
[1:09:15] of the Lord. Amen. You may be

[1:09:41] noon. Amen. And then at the end of uh
[1:09:45] tonight's
[1:09:46] service um at the request of one of our
[1:09:50] brothers, he would like to take
[1:09:53] picture with all the
[1:09:55] ministers that came to this meeting. And
[1:09:59] I will really suggest that at the end of
[1:10:01] the service after everybody is um
[1:10:04] ushered out, we will request the
[1:10:06] ministers and the wives to set back on
[1:10:09] their seats so that the picture can be
[1:10:11] taken
[1:10:13] immediately. Ministers, do you approve
[1:10:16] that for for me? Is it
[1:10:19] okay? Is it okay? If it's okay, can the
[1:10:23] ministers say amen? Amen. I'm talking
[1:10:25] about pastors and ministers.
[1:10:28] a brother we like us to really have
[1:10:30] picture with him and to bring back home.
[1:10:33] Amen. He's a wellrespected brother in
[1:10:36] your midst. Praise the Lord. Amen. So if
[1:10:40] you would like to, it's not compelling,
[1:10:42] but it is just to show fellow ministers
[1:10:45] in the battlefield. He wants to just
[1:10:48] like to see your faces. When he gets
[1:10:51] back home, then he feels good. when he
[1:10:54] wants to remember Africa, he wants to
[1:10:56] look at the minister's faces. You
[1:10:58] appreciate
[1:11:04] that? Amen. So, tonight I have the
[1:11:08] pleasure to introduce to you, Amen. the
[1:11:12] preacher, the speaker for
[1:11:15] tonight, Reverend Theoid.

[1:11:28] comes over to take
[1:11:30] over. Amen. As soon as he's
[1:11:33] done, I believe that God is going to
[1:11:37] stimulate the hearts and brother Johnny
[1:11:40] Conte comes immediately right behind.
[1:11:42] Amen. And then we go into the prayer
[1:11:46] line. Amen.
[1:11:48] May God richly bless you. Thank you for
[1:11:51] coming. We love you. God bless

[1:14:30] [Music]
[1:14:34] Let's bow our heads over a
[1:14:37] prayer. Almighty God, we thank you for
[1:14:39] your presence. We thank you for your
[1:14:41] love. We thank you for your grace, your
[1:14:43] blood, and the opportunity that you give
[1:14:46] us to come and worship you with
[1:14:49] believers of like precious faith.
[1:14:51] Father, I pray you come down in a
[1:14:53] special way tonight and speak to our
[1:14:55] hearts. Take me out of the way and may
[1:14:58] be glorified. And at the end of it all,

[1:15:02] Thine the glory. Be glorified in all
[1:15:06] that we see and do. May you get honor
[1:15:08] and glory in the name of thy holy child
[1:15:10] Jesus. Grant it father in Jesus name I
[1:15:13] ask it. Amen and amen. Well, greetings
[1:15:17] from the headstone tabernacle,
[1:15:19] Trinidad. On behalf of my wife here,
[1:15:21] Sister Anmarie, son Isaaki and his wife,
[1:15:24] Sister Karen. Want to greet brother
[1:15:26] Akachchobee, his wife, family and
[1:15:29] church. Greet the fellow ministers,
[1:15:31] fellow laborers in the vineard. We
[1:15:33] certainly appreciate you coming out. We
[1:15:36] thank God for you. Want to
[1:15:39] salute brother. You may be seated just a
[1:15:42] minute or two just before we read the
[1:15:44] scriptures. Want to salute the message
[1:15:46] this morning. Brother
[1:15:48] Ulu, God bless you. And what I could
[1:15:53] say, he stood up like an angel.
[1:15:56] and spoke truth.
[1:15:58] You know that's what David did, right?
[1:16:00] David saw Goliath and spoke truth to
[1:16:02] Goliath. Because Goliath wanted to know
[1:16:05] who is this little boy coming to him
[1:16:08] like that. And Goliath told David a lie.
[1:16:12] He said, I'm going to feed you to the
[1:16:14] birds. And Goliath was spoken truth.
[1:16:18] David said, "You come to me with spear
[1:16:19] and shield and whatever you come with,
[1:16:21] but I just come in the name of the Lord
[1:16:24] and I'm going to cut your head off, you
[1:16:26] intellectual giant." And I feel that was
[1:16:29] like David and that this morning. Praise
[1:16:32] God. Who is this
[1:16:34] uncircumcised
[1:16:36] Philistine
[1:16:38] defying the armies of the living
[1:16:42] God? How dare you? defy the armies of
[1:16:47] the living God. They are more for us
[1:16:50] than against us. Oh, hallelujah. Praise
[1:16:53] God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Oh, glory to God.
[1:16:57] Oh, glory. Don't get me started this
[1:16:59] night. Glory to God. Don't get me
[1:17:01] started. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:05] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Don't defy
[1:17:10] this army. You may be seated. Praise
[1:17:12] God. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory
[1:17:16] to God. And that is when truth speaks
[1:17:20] the power, the power of position.
[1:17:24] Hallelujah. Goliath was was was
[1:17:27] embarrassed to see who was challenging
[1:17:29] him. He felt he was so powerful because
[1:17:33] of his position. But once truth speaks
[1:17:36] the power or position, truth will
[1:17:40] prevail.
[1:17:44] Oh, hallelujah. Glory to God. That is
[1:17:48] what we need. You shall know the truth
[1:17:52] and the truth shall set you free. Oh the
[1:17:57] Lord I shout in the house.
[1:18:04] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:18:08] You may be seated. I remember reading
[1:18:11] something. thing brother Brandham said
[1:18:13] he was telling somebody the truth about
[1:18:15] their life and so on and when it came
[1:18:17] out they got free they got healed he
[1:18:21] said because the truth is what sets you
[1:18:23] free I'm not talking about the freedom
[1:18:25] that the devil come and take you back
[1:18:28] I'm talking about the freedom that Jesus
[1:18:30] said who the son of man set free is free
[1:18:35] indeed
[1:18:40] oh hallelujah Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:18:44] You may be seated. Praise God. The devil
[1:18:48] didn't believe Israel was free when
[1:18:50] Moses took them out. You may be seated.
[1:18:52] The devil thought Pharaoh thought the
[1:18:56] people still belong to him.
[1:18:58] Pharaoh thought that. And many times the
[1:19:01] devil think that he you still belong to
[1:19:03] him. So he see you as a runaway slave to
[1:19:07] bring you back in. So when Pharaoh saw
[1:19:10] those people going out, he couldn't take
[1:19:11] it anymore. He said, "Let's go after
[1:19:14] them." But God wanted that battle. God
[1:19:17] wanted that devil to come after because
[1:19:20] God wanted to prove he's the same
[1:19:23] yesterday and forever. And I feel
[1:19:26] tonight that God want to prove,
[1:19:29] hallelujah, that he is with this bride.
[1:19:33] [Applause]
[1:19:36] Glory. Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[1:19:40] Not because he is silent, he doesn't
[1:19:42] hear. Not because God is silent, he is
[1:19:45] not watching and looking. Don't
[1:19:48] misinterpret God's silence. Brother
[1:19:51] Brandham said when God is silent, that's
[1:19:54] the hour to be certain of God. When you
[1:19:57] pray and God doesn't answer, that's the
[1:20:02] very hour to be certain of God. And in
[1:20:06] this hour we are certain that we are
[1:20:09] standing on the rock. In this hour we
[1:20:12] are certain that we are standing on the
[1:20:15] promises. In this hour the devil can't
[1:20:18] move us. We are certain this is the
[1:20:22] truth.
[1:20:27] Oh glory to
[1:20:29] God. Amen. So turn your Bibles to
[1:20:32] Genesis chapter 1. Want to read from
[1:20:35] verse 26 to
[1:20:37] 28. Psalms
[1:20:39] 8. Want to read from verse
[1:20:42] 4-6. Revelation 5 2:es 9 and
[1:20:50] 10. Genesis
[1:20:52] 1 verse 26.
[1:20:57] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[1:20:59] image, after our likeness, sir, and let
[1:21:03] them have dominion over the fish of the
[1:21:06] sea, over the fowl of the air, and over
[1:21:09] the cattle, and
[1:21:12] over all the earth, and over every
[1:21:16] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:21:17] earth." So God created man in his own
[1:21:20] image, in the image of God created he
[1:21:23] him. male and female created them. And
[1:21:27] God blessed them. And God said unto
[1:21:30] them, "Be fruitful and
[1:21:33] multiply, replenish the earth, subdue
[1:21:36] it, and have dominion over the fish of
[1:21:39] the sea, over the fowl of the air, over
[1:21:42] every living thing that moveth upon the
[1:21:46] earth." We want to go to Psalms
[1:21:50] 8, reading from verse 4.
[1:21:58] What is man that thou art mindful of
[1:22:00] him?
[1:22:02] And the son of man that thou visitest
[1:22:05] him? For thou has made him a little
[1:22:07] lower than the angels. And has crowned
[1:22:10] him with glory and honor. Thou madeest
[1:22:14] him to have dominion over the works of
[1:22:17] thy hand. Thou has put all things under
[1:22:22] his feet.
[1:22:24] Final scripture from Revelation chapter
[1:22:25] 5. Want to read verse 9 and 10. This is
[1:22:30] after the lamb took the
[1:22:33] book and they sung a new song saying,
[1:22:36] "Thou art worthy to take the book and to
[1:22:39] open the seals thereof. For thou was
[1:22:43] slain and has redeemed us to God by thy
[1:22:47] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[1:22:51] and people and nation and has made us
[1:22:54] unto our God kings and priests and we
[1:22:58] shall reign on the earth. Let's pray
[1:23:01] once more. Father, we thank you for your
[1:23:03] word. Inspire to hearts. May it get
[1:23:07] wings Lord by the spirit and and fly
[1:23:11] into our hearts Lord. May the word
[1:23:13] became become flesh and dwell among us
[1:23:15] tonight in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and
[1:23:18] amen. You may be seated. Oh blessed be
[1:23:21] the name of the Lord. And tonight is the
[1:23:23] prayer line night. And I trust them that
[1:23:26] the words that we're going to share with
[1:23:28] you will inspire you tonight and set you
[1:23:30] free from your sickness, from your
[1:23:33] bondage, from whatever condition you're
[1:23:35] in. That freedom will reign in your
[1:23:38] life. I have a title
[1:23:43] tonight. We shall reign on the earth.
[1:23:48] That's my title tonight. We shall reign
[1:23:52] on the earth. I have a context scripture
[1:23:54] from Ephesians 1 11-14.
[1:23:58] It says, "In whom also we have obtained
[1:24:00] an inheritance, being predestinated
[1:24:03] according to the purpose of him, who
[1:24:05] workketh at all things after the council
[1:24:08] of his own will, that we should be to
[1:24:11] the praise of his glory, who first
[1:24:12] trusted in Christ, in whom also you
[1:24:15] trusted, after you heard the word of
[1:24:18] truth, the gospel of your salvation, in
[1:24:21] whom also after you believe, you were
[1:24:24] sealed, here we go, with that Holy
[1:24:27] Spirit of promise.
[1:24:28] which is the earnest or down payment of
[1:24:31] our inheritance until the redemption of
[1:24:35] the purchased possession unto the praise
[1:24:37] of his glory. So if this is a down
[1:24:40] payment, it means it have more to come.
[1:24:43] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Do
[1:24:45] you believe that? And he was talking
[1:24:48] about uh uh you know the the the
[1:24:51] tabernacle and the most holy place and
[1:24:54] so on. He talking about Aaron and he
[1:24:56] said, "Watch and them that took out the
[1:24:58] blood of the covenant, the blood." He
[1:24:59] was anointed. He had garments on that
[1:25:02] had little jingle bells on them, a
[1:25:05] pomegranate and a bell. And that man,
[1:25:08] here we go, of Aaron. That man had to
[1:25:11] walk in such a
[1:25:15] way, not just walk, but walk in such a
[1:25:20] way. Watch that. Every time when he move
[1:25:23] his leg, they played holy, holy, holy
[1:25:28] unto the Lord. So Aaron couldn't walk
[1:25:31] just how he, you know, he just want to
[1:25:32] walk. He had to walk away. That the
[1:25:35] bells will ring and the bells ringing
[1:25:39] would be signaling holy, holy, holy,
[1:25:43] holy unto the Lord. Listen to brother
[1:25:45] Brham. You say, "What am I talking
[1:25:48] about?" Hear it. Brandham tabernacle.
[1:25:50] You had your chance.
[1:25:53] When a man once is anointed with the
[1:25:58] Holy Ghost
[1:26:00] to be adopted into the family of God,
[1:26:04] to be positionally placed by the father
[1:26:08] and set into a service out there into
[1:26:12] his purpose of life of what God has
[1:26:15] called him for. His walk must be holy,
[1:26:20] holy, holy unto the Lord. That is what
[1:26:24] the anointing going to produce. A walk,
[1:26:29] a special walk. Hallelujah. Are you with
[1:26:32] me? Now watch. But Abraham is
[1:26:34] dramatizing. Oh, you must turn aside to
[1:26:36] this. No. Holy, holy, holy unto the
[1:26:40] Lord. Oh, you must believe all what the
[1:26:42] elder said this, but holy, holy unto the
[1:26:45] Lord. Not holy, holy unto a group.
[1:26:49] Not holy, holy unto a bishop. Or a
[1:26:52] message pope. No. Holy holy unto the
[1:26:56] Lord. Are you with me? Holy, holy. Let
[1:27:00] his word be first. Let it be in
[1:27:03] everything here and settle it in your
[1:27:06] heart. This is what has to happen now.
[1:27:08] You have to settle it in your heart.
[1:27:10] Your walk must be in the word.
[1:27:15] In other words, it doesn't matter what
[1:27:17] Bishop so and so said. It doesn't matter
[1:27:20] what this group said. It doesn't matter
[1:27:22] what the ministers association said.
[1:27:25] It's got to be a walk in the word. Are
[1:27:29] you with me? But the Brand is still
[1:27:31] dramatized. He said, "Oh, if you just
[1:27:33] come over here, I'll tell you what we
[1:27:35] will do. We'll organize and put you in
[1:27:37] our organization. You'll be a great
[1:27:39] man." No. Holy, holy unto the Lord. It
[1:27:45] don't make a difference what anybody
[1:27:48] says.
[1:27:51] Oh, we coming unto that now. Now
[1:27:53] remember, it wasn't the whole of Israel
[1:27:56] going to that most holy place. It was
[1:27:59] one man. It was an individual. And
[1:28:02] listen to this. The Bible said God has
[1:28:05] made you kings and priests. Then you as
[1:28:10] an individual has to go in yourself with
[1:28:14] a certain walk holy holy unto the Lord
[1:28:19] because you are be made kings and
[1:28:21] priests. Oh glory to God. You may be
[1:28:24] seated. Glory to God. Listen to brother
[1:28:27] man. With all these tapes do this do
[1:28:32] that. No holy holy unto the Lord. You
[1:28:36] got your eyes set towards Calvary and
[1:28:38] there's nothing going to stop you. The
[1:28:40] very walk of your life. You are walking
[1:28:43] on the king's highway anointed with the
[1:28:46] precious anointing oil moving into the
[1:28:49] holiest of the holiest years. Oh, you
[1:28:52] may be seated. Oh, praise God. What is
[1:28:55] he saying? Like brother Raymond Thompson
[1:28:57] says, your connection becomes vertical,
[1:29:03] not horizontal,
[1:29:05] but vertical. Right now, tonight, the
[1:29:08] connections come vertical then
[1:29:11] horizontal. When the angel drop down, we
[1:29:14] could speak to you. It comes vertical
[1:29:17] then horizontal. If you don't have the
[1:29:20] vertical, you will need some man to
[1:29:23] connect to you or you will have to
[1:29:25] connect to some man. But when you
[1:29:27] connect to the source of power, when you
[1:29:31] connect to the headstone itself, when
[1:29:34] you connect to I Jesus that have sent
[1:29:37] mine angel, when you connect to the
[1:29:40] pillar of fire, when you connect to that
[1:29:43] power source that comes down, the angel
[1:29:46] of the Lord, it drops down. He send
[1:29:50] ministering spirits that drops down. Oh,
[1:29:53] give the Lord a shout of praise.
[1:29:56] Oh hallelujah. Glory to God. You may be
[1:30:00] seated. Then our walk must be in the
[1:30:04] word recognizing here we go. No other
[1:30:08] headship
[1:30:10] but the word. And I don't think the
[1:30:12] people get that the headship is not in
[1:30:14] Brandham tabernacle. The headship is not
[1:30:17] in this tabernacle. The headship is not
[1:30:19] in some hookup connection. No. The
[1:30:21] headship is Christ.
[1:30:23] the mighty angel, the word itself.
[1:30:27] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are you with
[1:30:30] me? You may be seated. And brother
[1:30:32] Brandon in Christ, the mystery of God
[1:30:34] will real. He said, "Now watch." Oh,
[1:30:36] this is a powerhouse. He said the body
[1:30:39] and the head was took from the grave. So
[1:30:42] the body must follow him back to Eden.
[1:30:46] where the head of the family, the man,
[1:30:47] the bridegroom, the bride being the body
[1:30:51] of the bridegroom must follow the
[1:30:53] bridegroom because that's the head. And
[1:30:56] when the head is revealed and come back
[1:30:58] with eternal life, the body must follow
[1:31:01] that because it's husband and wife
[1:31:03] again. As long as you are pregnantated,
[1:31:06] here we go, with the same word which is
[1:31:09] his body. You took his body. You become
[1:31:11] in him. Then you took the word not a
[1:31:15] creed the word. Therefore the
[1:31:18] body cannot
[1:31:21] recognize any other headset.
[1:31:27] The church want headquarters. The church
[1:31:31] want some headman but the body, the
[1:31:35] bride body cannot recognize.
[1:31:39] Sir, the bride body cannot
[1:31:44] recognize any other headship. Or give
[1:31:47] the Lord a shout.
[1:31:50] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:31:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:31:55] Praise God. Listen to this. The prophet,
[1:31:59] you may be seated. The prophet is
[1:32:01] driving it down. Listen. The head is the
[1:32:05] word. Therefore,
[1:32:08] denominations, holy fathers, and
[1:32:11] everything else is dead.
[1:32:16] I'm reading. He call it dead dong.
[1:32:21] That is filth.
[1:32:25] No holy father, no holy denomination, no
[1:32:29] holy man, no holy pope. If a angel come
[1:32:33] from heaven, we going to smoke him out.
[1:32:37] If he don't say it what the prophets
[1:32:40] say, that is what we talking about.
[1:32:46] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:32:49] God. You may be seated. I told my church
[1:32:53] when I come behind the pulpit, I come
[1:32:55] with every weapon possible. When I open
[1:32:57] this part of my jacket, it have guns,
[1:33:00] bombs. Open the spot I have behind here.
[1:33:04] I am
[1:33:05] loaded. This is
[1:33:08] war. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. When
[1:33:12] you think I don't have weapons, I'll
[1:33:14] pull it all from behind here. Praise
[1:33:16] God. All behind here, brother. I'm a
[1:33:19] war. This is life and
[1:33:25] death. Glory to God. Listen to this.
[1:33:30] Adam fell and his book left his
[1:33:37] hands. The book was sealed.
[1:33:42] All creation is grown.
[1:33:45] Because when Adam fell,
[1:33:48] the earth fell, creation fell. Oh
[1:33:52] hallelujah. So we fell down. But when
[1:33:56] the lamb took the book, it means that we
[1:34:00] are going to be restored. When the lamb
[1:34:03] took the book, it means that son's
[1:34:06] getting back. The Bible said when the
[1:34:08] lamb took the book, they sang a new
[1:34:11] song. Not the same old song, a new song.
[1:34:17] And the song was, we shall
[1:34:22] reign on the
[1:34:24] earth. In other words, heaven is not our
[1:34:29] destination. Heaven is part of the
[1:34:31] itinerary. We are going up and we are
[1:34:35] coming
[1:34:36] back. Oh, glory to God. You heard what I
[1:34:41] said. That's not the destination. That's
[1:34:44] part of the itinerary. We going up to
[1:34:48] compact tongue, but we going to reign on
[1:34:51] the earth because God has
[1:34:54] appointed man to have
[1:34:57] dominion. Oh,
[1:34:59] glory. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:35:02] Oh,
[1:35:04] hallelujah.
[1:35:05] Hallelujah.
[1:35:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God said, "Let
[1:35:11] us make man in our image and let that
[1:35:15] man have dominion." So the image is
[1:35:18] connected to the book. That's why the
[1:35:21] book was sealed. The image is connected
[1:35:24] to the book because the image is
[1:35:26] connected to power. The power of
[1:35:29] dominion. Oh hallelujah.
[1:35:32] Are you with me? This is it, brother
[1:35:34] Brandham. Then our headship, I love this
[1:35:37] is a kingdom.
[1:35:43] The kingdom of God is within you. That's
[1:35:46] why Jesus blow disciples mind. He said
[1:35:48] when they say low here, come and get the
[1:35:50] connection here. Come and go there.
[1:35:54] Fivefold is over there. He said forget
[1:35:56] it. Behold the kingdom is within you.
[1:36:00] Oh, glory to God. The kingdom of God is
[1:36:04] the word becoming power in our life. The
[1:36:07] devil is shaking tonight because we It's
[1:36:11] not possible that we might reign on the
[1:36:13] earth. It didn't say we might reign on
[1:36:15] the earth. It is possible that we will
[1:36:18] rain. They say
[1:36:19] we
[1:36:21] shall
[1:36:23] shall
[1:36:25] shall shall no if no buts we
[1:36:32] shall reign on the earth. Oh, give the
[1:36:35] Lord a shout of praise. Oh, glory to
[1:36:38] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory
[1:36:42] to God. Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[1:36:47] So, God's original intent was for man to
[1:36:51] have dominion over the fish, over the
[1:36:55] beast. And brother Brandham came and
[1:36:57] demonstrate what God was talking about.
[1:37:01] Therefore, you have to confront the bull
[1:37:03] to show there is power over beast. There
[1:37:06] is power over the bull. There is power
[1:37:10] over the bees. There is power in the
[1:37:12] blood. There is power here at night. Oh,
[1:37:15] glory to God. It's not tomorrow we are
[1:37:18] going to be the sons. He said now are we
[1:37:21] the sons of God. You have to talk like
[1:37:24] one. You have to act like one. You have
[1:37:26] to reflect one. The son is just like his
[1:37:29] father and the father spoke and created
[1:37:33] just like that. Oh, glory to God.
[1:37:36] Hallelujah. Are you with me tonight? Oh,
[1:37:39] glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:37:42] You may be seated,
[1:37:45] please. Have a seat. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:37:50] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Oh,
[1:37:53] glory. Hallelujah.
[1:37:56] Let's take a look at the program of God.
[1:37:59] His holy spirit
[1:38:01] here. He is trying to place his
[1:38:05] church to get his church in
[1:38:09] order and place it in the promised land
[1:38:12] so they could enter and all the enemies
[1:38:16] can be drove out.
[1:38:20] God is not interested with the
[1:38:24] Philistines and the Hittites and the
[1:38:26] Jebusites living with you. If you don't
[1:38:30] drive them out, they're going to stay
[1:38:32] with you. They're going to terrorize
[1:38:35] you. They're going to harass your
[1:38:37] church. You better start to
[1:38:39] drive these Philistines, these Hittites,
[1:38:44] these Jebusites, these Canaanites, these
[1:38:48] Amorites, all
[1:38:53] theites.
[1:38:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are more than
[1:38:58] conquerors. God has put all things under
[1:39:02] our feet. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God.
[1:39:06] Amen. You may be seated. Praise God. You
[1:39:09] may be seated. Brother Brandham Man
[1:39:12] can't take his land.
[1:39:16] How you going to act? Man won't keep his
[1:39:19] ground. Ephraim won't keep his ground.
[1:39:22] God won't keep his ground. When God
[1:39:24] blessing him, somebody called him on the
[1:39:25] phone and say, "You know what happening?
[1:39:26] You should preach so and so and so." And
[1:39:28] he said, "I want to know if I should
[1:39:29] preach that and what because he
[1:39:31] connected horizontal."
[1:39:34] Somebody send him mommy email. Somebody
[1:39:37] send him a text. God is send text from
[1:39:39] from
[1:39:40] horizontal. God does come
[1:39:44] vertical. Horizontal is man. Vertical is
[1:39:48] God. When the Elohim drop upon Peter,
[1:39:50] Jesus said, "Flesh and blood have not
[1:39:53] revealed this unto you.
[1:39:57] [Applause]
[1:39:58] But my father who comes hurry comes down
[1:40:01] vertical.
[1:40:05] You want to be seated? So watch watch.
[1:40:10] Benjamin won't keep his ground. They all
[1:40:12] run out here with the Philistines all
[1:40:13] mixed up. How are we going to be placed?
[1:40:18] We But we have been born by the Holy
[1:40:21] Ghost. All of us. Is that right? What
[1:40:24] are we born to? Watch. We are
[1:40:28] predestinated. Here we go. Then after
[1:40:31] being born, we are predestinated into
[1:40:34] the adoptional
[1:40:36] watch to be placed in the body of
[1:40:39] Christ.
[1:40:41] After you are born, you may be seated.
[1:40:43] All right. So
[1:40:46] before Jesus came forth as a manifested
[1:40:51] son, after he was filled with the Holy
[1:40:55] Ghost, he was led
[1:40:58] by the spirit
[1:41:00] into the
[1:41:01] wilderness to
[1:41:03] overcome the lust of the eyes, the lust
[1:41:07] of the flesh, and the pride of the
[1:41:10] earth, the pride of life. So Jesus had
[1:41:15] to reign over his
[1:41:18] earth, over his tongue, over his flesh,
[1:41:23] over his eyes, over his desires, over
[1:41:28] himself. He conquered he conquered
[1:41:31] himself and was then ready to move on in
[1:41:36] the adoption ministry. Now the easier
[1:41:39] one is to rule over man like pope or Mr.
[1:41:44] Frances or or like some president or so.
[1:41:48] That's the easy part. And we have these
[1:41:51] message popes who want to re reign over
[1:41:53] people, reign over others, and they have
[1:41:56] no power over themselves. But before
[1:41:59] Jesus was sent out into the adoption
[1:42:03] ministry, yet was to prove he had power
[1:42:06] over himself.
[1:42:08] Isn't that right? Because first John 2
[1:42:11] said, "All that is in the world, the
[1:42:14] lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
[1:42:17] and the pride of the life is not of the
[1:42:19] father but of the world." So all that is
[1:42:22] in the world is either under the lust of
[1:42:25] the flesh or the lust of the eyes or the
[1:42:27] pride of life. That is why the devil
[1:42:30] told Eve, hallelujah, that tree is good.
[1:42:33] When she saw the good, she will see the
[1:42:35] tree, she look at her eyes. Then the
[1:42:37] devil says good for food. Then he's
[1:42:39] going to make you wise. So since in the
[1:42:41] garden of Eden it was introduced the
[1:42:44] lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh
[1:42:46] and the pride of life. And once we could
[1:42:48] handle that and put that under our feet,
[1:42:52] we have overcome.
[1:42:54] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:42:57] Oh hallelujah. Hal are you with me this
[1:43:01] morning, this evening? May be seated.
[1:43:04] Adoption. Brother man, what is
[1:43:05] everything waiting for? What is the
[1:43:07] whole creation waiting for? The
[1:43:09] manifestation of the sons of God. It is
[1:43:12] waiting for the church to come in
[1:43:14] position. Oh, hallelujah. So, now it's
[1:43:18] talking something different now. It's
[1:43:19] not waiting for church. We have
[1:43:21] thousands.
[1:43:23] It's waiting for the church to come in
[1:43:27] position. That's different. That That's
[1:43:29] different. You may be seated. That's
[1:43:31] That's different. That's different.
[1:43:33] Jesus from age 12 to 18 or age 12 to to
[1:43:38] to 30 18 years it took Jesus to write
[1:43:42] that seed and when he was right he went
[1:43:45] in the scriptures to find out his
[1:43:48] position in Isaiah 61 and went in the
[1:43:52] temple to read the spirit is upon me. He
[1:43:55] was taking it present tense and bringing
[1:43:57] the word alive to himself. He was
[1:44:00] anointing the promise to himself. He was
[1:44:02] saying the spirit is upon me because he
[1:44:05] anointed me to perform these things
[1:44:07] because when the power come it come to
[1:44:09] do a work. If you are ready for work yet
[1:44:11] no power coming to you. If you are lazy
[1:44:14] there is no power coming to you. If you
[1:44:17] are not interested in your father's
[1:44:19] business nothing is coming to you. God
[1:44:22] looking for sons who could testify. I am
[1:44:25] about my father's
[1:44:29] business, not the association of
[1:44:31] ministers business. No, my father's
[1:44:35] business. It's an individual affair. You
[1:44:38] don't have a group father. You only have
[1:44:40] one father. Oh, glory to God. No group
[1:44:43] is your father. How? No church is your
[1:44:45] father. You only have one father. That's
[1:44:47] the Lord. And the thing of it is this
[1:44:50] message that introduced is of adoption
[1:44:53] is to bring men to maturity not to stay
[1:44:56] as a little child where you have to be
[1:44:58] led and fed spoonfed and people have to
[1:45:02] tell you don't go here don't do that
[1:45:05] there and stop doing that here no when I
[1:45:09] was a child I spake as a child I
[1:45:12] understood as a child but when I become
[1:45:17] A man forgive the Lord. Let the men in
[1:45:21] the house
[1:45:23] shout. Let me hear you brother
[1:45:29] shout. When I become a man, I put away
[1:45:32] childish thing. Oh, glory to God. God's
[1:45:36] objective is to bring you to Christian
[1:45:38] maturity where you know what and how and
[1:45:41] what to do in the awe of trying times.
[1:45:44] Oh, hallelujah. You may be seated. Oh,
[1:45:47] glory to God.
[1:45:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God wanting to
[1:45:52] place his church. Sons and daughters,
[1:45:55] listen to the man of God. Let me live to
[1:45:58] see it. Is my prayer. It's so close. You
[1:46:02] having a vision. He's seeing you coming
[1:46:04] into power. He's seeing all what's going
[1:46:06] to come upon you. Oh, I feel a rumbling
[1:46:08] in the camp. Brother Brandham say it's
[1:46:10] so close. It's so close. I could feel it
[1:46:13] with my hands almost. That's what I long
[1:46:16] to see. Waiting for the time. There lays
[1:46:19] a laying there from his mother's
[1:46:22] womb. And we say, "Look, a book.
[1:46:28] Here is a tape to listen to." No, that's
[1:46:31] not what is here. Walk up to a
[1:46:33] and say, "Silver and gold have I none."
[1:46:38] Waiting, watch for the manifestations of
[1:46:42] the sons of God. Hallelujah. When God
[1:46:45] will make himself known, when they will
[1:46:49] stop sickness,
[1:46:53] you know what that means? Arrest
[1:46:56] sickness. Lock it up. Bolt it down. Oh,
[1:47:02] hallelujah. Remove cancer. Remove the
[1:47:05] tumor. Let the walk. The blind
[1:47:09] eye pop open. Hope that's we talking
[1:47:12] about. Oh, hallelujah. Are you ready for
[1:47:15] it?
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:19] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:47:21] Oh, glory to God. We're going to reign
[1:47:22] on this earth, on the earth. We're going
[1:47:25] to reign over it. We're going to reign
[1:47:27] over sickness, over disease. Oh,
[1:47:30] hallelu. Any any condition whatsoever,
[1:47:33] nothing going to stop this bride. Oh,
[1:47:35] glory to God. I have a shocker for you.
[1:47:37] You're going to have dominion over
[1:47:38] nothing at all.
[1:47:42] Say, brother, what you say? Power over
[1:47:44] nothing. Yes, you'll create something.
[1:47:49] [Music]
[1:47:50] There was no squirrel.
[1:47:54] [Applause]
[1:47:56] There was nothing. And he said, "Let
[1:47:58] there be a squirrel." So, you going to
[1:48:00] have power over nothing. Oh, glory to
[1:48:03] God. When there is nothing, you're going
[1:48:06] to create. Hallelujah. So there is no
[1:48:09] atmosphere but we could create it
[1:48:11] tonight. Oh
[1:48:14] hallelujah. Whatever you want you could
[1:48:17] have tonight.
[1:48:19] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:48:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. They're going to
[1:48:24] stop cancer. They're going to stop
[1:48:25] diseases. You think cancer is something?
[1:48:28] The Bible said it's coming a time when
[1:48:29] men will rot in their flesh and the
[1:48:31] buzzers will eat off the carcass before
[1:48:33] they even die. Cancer is a true take to
[1:48:35] what's coming. But remember the horrible
[1:48:37] thing was forbidden in that day to touch
[1:48:40] those who had the seal of God. And
[1:48:43] that's what we are striving for now. To
[1:48:45] get in one and be positionally placed.
[1:48:51] Now remember redemption is in two parts.
[1:48:54] Coming out of and going into. If you
[1:48:57] only come out that's one part. It's two
[1:49:00] parts. You need the two parts for it to
[1:49:03] be completed. But I have a word for you.
[1:49:06] The Bible said, it said when the lamb
[1:49:08] took the book, it says, "And thou hast
[1:49:10] redeemed us by thy blood." So that means
[1:49:14] we're going to get through the two
[1:49:15] parts. We're going to come out and we're
[1:49:18] going to go into, do you believe that?
[1:49:20] That you ordained to go into into what?
[1:49:23] The land of promise, the Holy Ghost
[1:49:26] land. Oh, hallelujah. So we are striving
[1:49:29] to get in and be positionally placed
[1:49:32] into the kingdom of God before these
[1:49:35] plagues strike. Inheritance. You said
[1:49:38] Jesus left your inheritance. He said beg
[1:49:40] your pardon. Jesus never left the
[1:49:42] inheritance. Jesus never left you an
[1:49:44] inheritance. He only came down and paid
[1:49:46] for inheritance. Brought you to your
[1:49:49] inheritance. Your name was put on the
[1:49:51] lamb's book of life and God give you an
[1:49:54] inheritance. Your inheritance was first.
[1:49:57] Your inheritance was what? Your
[1:49:59] inheritance was first. What inheritance
[1:50:02] did I have? I didn't have any, but God
[1:50:05] left me an inheritance and put my name
[1:50:08] on the lamb's book of life. And God sent
[1:50:11] Jesus to make that inheritance real to
[1:50:15] me because there was nothing I could do
[1:50:17] to inherit it. It was blank. But in the
[1:50:20] fullness of time, God sent his own good
[1:50:23] time. Jesus the lamb slain from the
[1:50:26] foundation of the world. The blood was
[1:50:28] shed that I might go to my inheritance.
[1:50:33] So the blood was shed not for you to say
[1:50:35] I am saved. Thank you Lord. I'm saved.
[1:50:38] No, a little more than that. The blood
[1:50:40] was shed for you to go to inheritance.
[1:50:44] What inheritance? To
[1:50:47] sunship to be a son of God. You may be
[1:50:52] seated. Oh hallelujah. You mean my
[1:50:55] inheritance is sunship? Yes. What kind
[1:50:58] of sunship? The kind that Adam had
[1:51:01] before the fall. Oh, I'm not hearing you
[1:51:04] tonight. That is what we are talking
[1:51:06] about. Going back to dominion. Going
[1:51:10] back not for this to conquer you and
[1:51:12] that conquer you. No, he put all things
[1:51:14] under your feet. Oh, glory to God. Your
[1:51:17] sons, you're going to have power. God
[1:51:20] promised you power, brother. Oh my, we
[1:51:23] are waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:51:25] sons of God who will come back and take
[1:51:28] it over. Waiting for the fullness of
[1:51:30] time. When the pyramid gets to the top,
[1:51:32] when the full sons of God will be
[1:51:34] manifested, when the power of God will
[1:51:36] walk out, hallelujah, and will take
[1:51:38] every power that Satan got away from
[1:51:40] him, it belongs to God. Isn't that
[1:51:42] right? Oh, glory to God. So, this book
[1:51:45] is connected to our inheritance. And
[1:51:48] that is why when the lamb took the book,
[1:51:50] it said we shall reign on the earth. Now
[1:51:53] to reign is to rule, to conquer, to
[1:51:56] dominate, to have dominion over, to hold
[1:51:59] royal office. It is royal authority. It
[1:52:02] is dominance. It is domination.
[1:52:05] Hallelujah. It is preeminence.
[1:52:07] Hallelujah. So God want us to dominate
[1:52:09] the scene. You not hearing me tonight?
[1:52:12] God don't want you hoping and wondering.
[1:52:14] God want you to be dominant. God want
[1:52:16] you to dominate the scene. When you
[1:52:18] walk, demons must run. I'm not hearing
[1:52:21] you tonight. When you walk, demons must
[1:52:25] run. Demons have to say they coming
[1:52:27] again. They coming again. They coming
[1:52:29] again. They're coming again. They coming
[1:52:31] again. They coming back. They coming
[1:52:33] back. Sons of God are coming back.
[1:52:35] Brother, we're going to be proud of you.
[1:52:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. You may
[1:52:42] be seated. I told my church, I said,
[1:52:44] "Listen, when you get to heaven, when
[1:52:46] you see David, you don't want to be duck
[1:52:48] and hiding.
[1:52:50] Shadrach, Mish, and Abednego, you so
[1:52:52] ashamed you have no testimony.
[1:52:55] You just went to church." Hallelujah.
[1:52:57] Daniel went to the lion's den. Daniel
[1:52:59] looking to ask you how you made it. He
[1:53:01] said, "Daniel said, I saw hell come up
[1:53:03] on earth. Hell you or hell in the
[1:53:05] school, hell in the streets, and you
[1:53:08] pastor that come and testify to me. And
[1:53:10] you must be able to testify to Daniel."
[1:53:12] And then Daniel calling Shadrach,
[1:53:13] Meshach, and Abednego. And you sitting
[1:53:15] down testifying, my God, they try to
[1:53:18] kill me, but I overcome. They hate me,
[1:53:21] but I overcome by brotherly kindness, by
[1:53:24] forgiveness, by the power of love. I
[1:53:27] overcome, my God. I step on serpents. I
[1:53:30] step on this. Praise God. I'm overcomer.
[1:53:34] I'm a king. I'm royalty. I'm a son of
[1:53:38] the king. I know where I come from. know
[1:53:40] I am going. I know who I am. I know who
[1:53:44] son I am. I know who my father is. I
[1:53:47] come from God. Go back to God. Go give
[1:53:49] the Lord a shout. Oh,
[1:53:53] hallelujah.
[1:53:54] Hallelujah.
[1:53:56] Hallelujah. The shout of the king is in
[1:54:00] the camp. Oh, blessed be the name of the
[1:54:03] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:54:07] God. You may be seated. And I love God.
[1:54:11] I love his word. I love how he does
[1:54:13] things. He put brotherly kindness at the
[1:54:15] top.
[1:54:17] That's right.
[1:54:20] Before you enter into the love, he put
[1:54:22] brotherly kindness there. So how you get
[1:54:24] entering the love and you hate your
[1:54:25] brother? How you enter the love and you
[1:54:27] of order against the brother? He said,
[1:54:29] "Leave your gift at the altar. Make it
[1:54:31] right and then come back and I'm going
[1:54:32] to bless you. I'm going to pour it on
[1:54:34] you." He makes sure faith is based upon
[1:54:36] forgiveness. He put all these laws
[1:54:39] inside of here. Understand this. We
[1:54:42] belong to a different kingdom. Bible
[1:54:44] said we are citizens. We are no longer
[1:54:47] strangers. We are not immigrants. We
[1:54:50] belong here. This is our land.
[1:54:55] Glory to God. This seven thunders, this
[1:54:59] is our
[1:55:00] [Applause]
[1:55:04] land in Nigeria. All you Nigerians here,
[1:55:08] you could protest. Nobody got throw you
[1:55:10] out. You got all a plaqueard. Nobody got
[1:55:13] throw you out. Nobody got kick you out
[1:55:15] and boot you out. You a Nigerian. You
[1:55:18] have your passport. You a citizen of
[1:55:19] this country. But if somebody come from
[1:55:21] the some other country and and and
[1:55:23] hanging around here, they can't protest.
[1:55:25] They be booted out and deported. So
[1:55:28] what's something? God has made a citizen
[1:55:30] of this kingdom. You cannot be deported.
[1:55:43] Nobody could sentence you to hell.
[1:55:47] [Applause]
[1:55:50] When Jesus When Jesus went down to hell,
[1:55:55] hell couldn't hold him.
[1:55:59] Hell couldn't hold him. The grave
[1:56:03] couldn't hold them. Which denomination
[1:56:05] could hold us? Which message pope could
[1:56:09] hold us? But are we are free
[1:56:11] tonight? Glory to God. Where was thou?
[1:56:16] Where was thou when I laid the
[1:56:19] foundation of the earth and the morning
[1:56:22] star sang together. And sons of God
[1:56:27] shouted for
[1:56:29] joy. Oh. Oh. Feel like shouting now.
[1:56:35] Feel like shouting now. Feel like
[1:56:38] shouting
[1:56:42] now. We shall rain on the earth.
[1:56:53] Oh glory. Hallelujah. Oh glory to God.
[1:56:58] So when you leave here, you're not
[1:57:00] leaving here in weakness. You're not
[1:57:02] leaving here in weakness. You're leaving
[1:57:03] here in strength. Because Paul said, "I
[1:57:07] can do all things through Christ that
[1:57:10] strengthenth me."
[1:57:16] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:57:19] Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. Blessed
[1:57:25] be the rock of our salvation. He's my
[1:57:29] shield. He's my song. He's my deliverer.
[1:57:32] He's my strong and mighty tower. Hallelu
[1:57:35] my God. Hallelujah. My rock. Oh,
[1:57:39] hallelujah. Oh, praise the name of the
[1:57:42] Lord. Thou has made him a little lower
[1:57:44] than the angels and has crowned him with
[1:57:47] glory and honor. Thou madeest him to
[1:57:50] have dominion over the works of thy
[1:57:53] hands. Thou has put all things under his
[1:57:57] feet. As brother, he didn't say he made
[1:58:00] us higher than the animals. So, stop
[1:58:03] acting like an animal. Stop behaving
[1:58:05] like an animal. He didn't say we are
[1:58:07] higher than the animals. He say we a
[1:58:09] little lower than the angels and he put
[1:58:12] all things under our feet. Some of you
[1:58:15] shaking tonight because you never
[1:58:17] considered all things under your feet.
[1:58:20] You feel the devil is over you. Why I'm
[1:58:22] saying that's a lie. He is bluffing you
[1:58:24] tonight. The word said, God said, he put
[1:58:29] all things under our feet. All things.
[1:58:33] All things. We are more than conquerors
[1:58:35] tonight. Greater is he that's in you.
[1:58:39] Greater is he that's in you. Greater is
[1:58:42] he that's in you than he that is in the
[1:58:46] world. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:58:50] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:58:54] Glory, glory, glory, glory. Praise God.
[1:59:01] Let me say this to you.
[1:59:04] Elijah, when he came down to the river,
[1:59:07] he took his mantle and he struck the
[1:59:09] Jordan River. He didn't even talk.
[1:59:15] [Applause]
[1:59:15] [Music]
[1:59:16] [Applause]
[1:59:17] He didn't have to talk. When he strike
[1:59:19] the river, the river know what to do.
[1:59:25] [Music]
[1:59:28] Notice we could strike the water and
[1:59:32] open it up but when Jesus come he decide
[1:59:35] he don't even want to open it up. He
[1:59:37] going to walk on
[1:59:43] it. We could do either one. We could do
[1:59:46] either one. Open up or walk on it.
[1:59:58] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[2:00:03] Glory. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:00:07] Hallelujah.
[2:00:08] Hallelujah.
[2:00:10] Now remember the destination is not
[2:00:13] heaven that says pass of the itinerary.
[2:00:16] But God created earth and placed man on
[2:00:19] this earth. right now Putin and and
[2:00:22] Obama and all them only temporary
[2:00:24] holding the position but we shall reign
[2:00:27] on the earth and the meek shall inherit
[2:00:29] the earth they can't stop us right now
[2:00:32] this is the Satan's Eden but we are
[2:00:34] coming back to take over but before we
[2:00:37] leave before we leave there'll be one
[2:00:40] blast there'll be one demonstration of
[2:00:44] what the power was supposed to be in the
[2:00:46] garden of Eden there'll be one more ride
[2:00:50] Woo! Glory,
[2:00:53] glory, glory, glory to God. When brother
[2:00:58] Brennham was alive, they couldn't bring
[2:01:01] that foolishness. They couldn't bring
[2:01:03] all the have the nonsense they have
[2:01:04] today because the prophet know the
[2:01:06] secret of the heart. He could see
[2:01:08] through them from a far off. He knew all
[2:01:10] the tricks in the books. God gave him
[2:01:12] visions and everything else. But guess
[2:01:14] what? The spirit of Elijah is coming
[2:01:17] right back to rest upon Elisha. Guess
[2:01:20] what? There'll be another Acts four.
[2:01:22] Guess what? There'll be another Acts
[2:01:24] two. Guess what? There'll be another
[2:01:27] Acts five. Guess what? The pillar of
[2:01:29] fire going to dwell in the sons of God
[2:01:33] in the last
[2:01:38] days. Who's going to stop it? Nobody
[2:01:42] could stop it. Hallelujah. Do you
[2:01:45] understand that the canker woman, the
[2:01:47] caterpillar, and the pal eat down that
[2:01:50] tree and is not man trying to restore?
[2:01:53] God said, "I
[2:01:57] somebody say I." God said, "I will
[2:02:01] restore unto you."
[2:02:05] Oh, give the Lord a praise. Give the
[2:02:08] Lord a shout.
[2:02:10] God set
[2:02:13] I glory. Hallelujah. Will restore unto
[2:02:18] you. All the years you missed out. All
[2:02:22] the years the devil mess with your mind.
[2:02:25] One of these days God going to take the
[2:02:27] cap and think roll back your
[2:02:30] understanding. God going to bring back
[2:02:32] your right mind. Right now you have
[2:02:34] amnesia. But God is bringing it right
[2:02:36] back. Because when the lamb took the
[2:02:38] book, it wasn't for the lamb. No, the
[2:02:41] lamb took the book. It was for his wife.
[2:02:44] That's why the mighty angel came down
[2:02:47] with the book open. Not closed, but
[2:02:50] open. And brother Brandham, evidence of
[2:02:53] the open book when he said, "Little
[2:02:55] fishy, I give you back your life." That
[2:02:59] was an Adamic son. There was a son back
[2:03:03] in the garden of Eden again vindicating
[2:03:06] the power that going to be in the last
[2:03:08] day church little fishy I'll give you
[2:03:10] back your life and when the storm was
[2:03:14] coming that prophet said son come out
[2:03:16] and shine 4 days that was power over the
[2:03:18] elements that was Joshua saying son
[2:03:21] stand still that's what the son supposed
[2:03:24] to do speak and the word is created just
[2:03:27] like that one of these days we're going
[2:03:29] to have a 15minute service. Oh, glory.
[2:03:31] Just 15 minutes and the power of God
[2:03:34] will be moving in your being. Every
[2:03:36] fiber of your being, the minister will
[2:03:39] not be able to minister because of the
[2:03:42] glory of God because the glory of God
[2:03:44] going to fill the whole tabernacle. Oh,
[2:03:46] glory to God. His wife was sick. He was
[2:03:49] in a fixed country and the wife was
[2:03:51] going on an operation. And brother Rama
[2:03:53] spoke. He said, "Before the doctor's
[2:03:55] hand touches my wife, the tumor," very
[2:03:59] specific like that, Brother Ulo, not uh
[2:04:02] bless my wife, Lord. Uh, touch my wife,
[2:04:04] Lord. No, no, no. We send an arrow
[2:04:07] straight to the
[2:04:11] tumor. We can't
[2:04:15] miss. We are not going to miss. We will
[2:04:19] be very
[2:04:20] specific. John was specific. He said,
[2:04:23] "We shall reign on the earth."
[2:04:28] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[2:04:36] Listen, this is not fairy tale.
[2:04:41] The evidence is already on the earth.
[2:04:43] But man said little had right, I give
[2:04:45] you your two boys. He had power of
[2:04:49] salvation.
[2:04:50] All of that is already on. He had the
[2:04:53] power of creation. Let there be a
[2:04:55] squirrel. So nothing is not stopping
[2:04:58] him. If there is nothing, we'll create
[2:05:00] something. So why we can't create a
[2:05:03] revival? Why we can't create a seven
[2:05:06] thunder? I am telling you there is going
[2:05:09] to be a revival. Oh my my my
[2:05:13] my. Okay. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God.
[2:05:19] Praise God. I'm going to finish off with
[2:05:20] this. Hallelujah.
[2:05:24] Hallelujah. In the last days, the true
[2:05:28] church comes to the headstone. Will be a
[2:05:32] super church. A super race. Hallelujah.
[2:05:35] Praise God. Do you believe that? The
[2:05:38] last days there going to be a super
[2:05:40] church. A super race. Isn't that right?
[2:05:43] They will be so much like him.
[2:05:48] Uh-huh. We not talk about talk now. We
[2:05:51] talking about image.
[2:05:55] So he's saying in the last days this
[2:05:56] super church go be like him not the
[2:05:59] talk. This is plentiful.
[2:06:04] Bow and no arrows. I call it verbal
[2:06:07] gymnastics.
[2:06:09] Flipping here and flipping here.
[2:06:11] Flipping words here and flipping doing
[2:06:13] some assaults and people
[2:06:14] going never see that way. Woo. Silly
[2:06:18] woman laden with divers lust. Woohoo!
[2:06:20] Ever learning, never coming to the
[2:06:22] knowledge of the truth. They have
[2:06:24] itching ears to hear new doctrine, new
[2:06:27] teachings, new revelations, new
[2:06:29] mysteries
[2:06:32] that come out hidden from Satan's black
[2:06:34] bag.
[2:06:40] Hallelujah.
[2:06:41] Hallelujah. But that bride going to be
[2:06:44] in his very image. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:06:47] Brother Bham said denominations can
[2:06:49] never produce this. What is his image?
[2:06:52] Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[2:06:56] patience, godliness, brotherly kindness.
[2:06:58] Brotherly kindness is true.
[2:07:01] Because brotherly kindness, you have to
[2:07:03] put yourself in your brother's place on
[2:07:04] the matter.
[2:07:07] You can't go around it.
[2:07:10] You can't escape it. That blood have to
[2:07:12] be upon you. No, no grudge. Amen.
[2:07:17] Because you have to conf you have to
[2:07:18] have confidence to speak the word. So
[2:07:20] there have to be no condemnation.
[2:07:26] Let let me let me out here. Hallelujah.
[2:07:28] Oh glory. So then from a group of the
[2:07:31] true seed of the word God represent
[2:07:33] Christ the beloved bride. Watch a
[2:07:36] virgin.
[2:07:38] A version to his word. That means no
[2:07:40] man's interpretation. So no man can come
[2:07:42] and say he's fivefold. Which fold is
[2:07:44] that? It have fall and fold. Which pole
[2:07:46] is that? It take dynamics to produce a
[2:07:49] five-fold. Say if the dynamics and
[2:07:51] strike yet there's a five-fold ministry
[2:07:54] yet you can't take out yet.
[2:07:58] No man have the authority to take out
[2:08:00] yet. That's a false authority. Dynamics
[2:08:04] have to strike the bride. And when the
[2:08:06] dynamics strike the bride then sons
[2:08:08] positionally placed then they have to be
[2:08:10] tested.
[2:08:12] or I thought I reach. No, they now start
[2:08:20] these virtues have to be living and
[2:08:22] tested. You can't tell me you're living
[2:08:26] only the test will prove if it living or
[2:08:28] not and I have news for you. But say the
[2:08:31] devil make you prove it. Not brother
[2:08:33] oid. You could pass by.
[2:08:37] It's you and the devil. Oh hal, you
[2:08:39] don't want to say amen to that one.
[2:08:42] I didn't say that. That's the word. You
[2:08:44] know, the devil will make you prove it.
[2:08:47] That's why I'm fighting for every inch.
[2:08:49] Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm not going to sit
[2:08:51] back. If I have to die, I have a cookst
[2:08:54] stick up here. I'm going to hold a
[2:08:55] cookst stick here. If I lose my teeth,
[2:08:56] I'll use my gums. But I'm going to fight
[2:08:59] every way.
[2:09:02] Hallelujah. Are you with me? Because
[2:09:04] there is going to be revival in this
[2:09:06] land. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:09:10] through them and by them will be
[2:09:14] fulfilled. All that was promised.
[2:09:17] Through them, by them, what a church. I
[2:09:22] could feel it. I could sense it. I could
[2:09:26] sense it. What a people, a royal
[2:09:29] priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
[2:09:32] people. Oh, glory to God. Be one of
[2:09:36] them. Oh, hallelujah. I love this part.
[2:09:40] Notice the harmony. Jesus never did
[2:09:42] anything until the father show him
[2:09:44] first. He can do nothing and the bride
[2:09:46] will do nothing until you have thus said
[2:09:48] the Lord. Oh hallelujah. So if they
[2:09:52] leave the church, they went out from us
[2:09:54] because they were not of us. So
[2:09:56] therefore there is no thunders without
[2:09:58] dying. It have no thunders without
[2:10:00] death. I hear people preaching all kind
[2:10:02] of gospel and there's no death in it.
[2:10:04] There's no killing. I just listen for
[2:10:05] death because I know a seed have to go
[2:10:08] down in the ground. Somebody mistake
[2:10:10] something the seed said he thought I was
[2:10:13] a stone or rock. He didn't know I was a
[2:10:14] seed and he bury me. That's the wrong
[2:10:17] thing to do as seed. You know because
[2:10:19] once you bury it, it will come forth. So
[2:10:21] therefore this gospel has to come with
[2:10:23] that. Okay, let me close. God made man,
[2:10:27] brother Brandham said to predominate
[2:10:28] over the earth. He had dominion. He said
[2:10:31] in Genesis when he make man he said I am
[2:10:33] Yahweh Jvhu Jehovah. What did it mean?
[2:10:37] He mean I am the allexistent one who has
[2:10:41] created something over myself to be a
[2:10:43] son of mine. A temporary or an amateur
[2:10:47] little one of me. So God was to reign
[2:10:50] over heaven and the sons reign on earth.
[2:10:53] That was God's original intent. But
[2:10:56] because of the fall with the
[2:10:58] introduction of the lust of the eyes,
[2:10:59] the lust of the flesh and the pride of
[2:11:00] life and Eve take up that tree. We went
[2:11:03] through a process and God make the whole
[2:11:05] cycle. Must be born again. Get to the
[2:11:07] book. The book reveal your name. You go
[2:11:09] through the process. Bring it to
[2:11:11] positionally place tested virtue image
[2:11:13] come right back to the image of God.
[2:11:15] You're back to Eden on the earth and the
[2:11:19] devil is confused.
[2:11:23] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:11:26] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to
[2:11:29] Lord. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:11:33] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:11:36] Finally, brother Bham said, this great
[2:11:39] outpouring of God's spirit in the last
[2:11:40] days. That's the thing to bring faith
[2:11:43] into the people that will take a rapture
[2:11:45] in faith that will take the church into
[2:11:48] glory. And he said the church have to be
[2:11:50] rebuilt in the power of the spirit. And
[2:11:53] the final quote I'm going to read, he
[2:11:55] talking about from feast of the
[2:11:56] trumpets. He said this group here,
[2:11:58] they've got 2,000 B of the river
[2:11:59] Euphrates has been bound for 2,000
[2:12:02] years. The church has bound the Holy
[2:12:04] Ghost for nearly 2,000 years under
[2:12:07] martrdom. But the hol the Holy Spirit
[2:12:09] can't work in the church because of
[2:12:12] man-made systems. But she is going to be
[2:12:14] liberated. She is coming back. The
[2:12:17] evening type message liberates the Holy
[2:12:19] Ghost. God couldn't release the Holy
[2:12:21] Ghost as spirit because he wasn't ready
[2:12:23] for it yet. So he released the Holy
[2:12:25] Ghost in the form of promises that by
[2:12:27] these promises you can become partakers
[2:12:30] of his divine nature to come back in
[2:12:33] God's image to come back to dominion.
[2:12:35] May the Lord bless you.
[2:12:50] [Applause]
[2:12:52] Hallelujah. Come on, do something. Come
[2:12:55] on, do something. Come on. Come on. Come
[2:12:58] on. Come on. Come
[2:13:00] on. We shall reign on the earth. We

[2:13:09] We shall reign on the earth. We shall
[2:13:13] reign on the earth.
[2:13:15] Come on, give your testimony.
[2:13:18] We shall see the king when he comes.

[2:13:40] doctor touches my wife. Let that tumor
[2:13:43] be gone.
[2:13:44] Be
[2:13:45] [Music]
[2:13:53] specific. Clap your
[2:13:57] [Music]
[2:14:02] hands. We shall see the king when it
[2:14:06] [Music]
[2:14:08] comes. Oh, we shall see the king.

[2:14:51] with the blessing power. Oh, I shall see
[2:14:56] it again. When it comes, we shall see it
[2:15:00] again. We shall see it
[2:15:04] again. We shall see it

[2:16:36] hour. Oh, we shall see the
[2:16:40] king when he comes.

[2:17:35] the prayer
[2:17:37] line. The
[2:17:39] devil is already
[2:17:43] defeated. God has placed everything
[2:17:45] under our feet. So we know who we are.
[2:17:49] We know we have dominion over sickness,
[2:17:53] over diseases, over afflictions. Satan
[2:17:57] has no right to afflict you. is a
[2:18:00] squatter. And tonight we are serving him
[2:18:02] with notice. I don't care what the
[2:18:05] doctor might call it. They might call it
[2:18:07] cancer. They might call it whatever they
[2:18:09] want to call it. But tonight in the name
[2:18:11] of the Lord, we are serving every
[2:18:14] sickness, every disease, every
[2:18:17] affliction. We are serving a quick
[2:18:19] notice and we are coming behind as the

[2:18:25] Spirit will enforce the law against
[2:18:28] Satan to give up whatever he has
[2:18:31] unlawfully and deceitfully taken away
[2:18:34] from
[2:18:36] you. Brother John said this morning is
[2:18:38] your own
[2:18:39] decision. It's your decision. If you
[2:18:42] want to go back with your sickness, it's
[2:18:44] your decision. But the power of God is
[2:18:46] there tonight to heal
[2:18:48] you. Because he's not going to heal you.
[2:18:51] He has already healed you. is a finished

[2:19:17] health because it's your right to live
[2:19:20] healthy. is your right to live healthy.

[2:19:27] infirmity on you. Hallelujah. Do you

[2:20:18] request and so forth should come forward
