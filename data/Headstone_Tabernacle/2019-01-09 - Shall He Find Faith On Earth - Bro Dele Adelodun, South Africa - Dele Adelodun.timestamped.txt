[37:18] anointed singers to place the pride of

[37:25] read a quote now the day he says God
[37:27] heals by medicine

[38:45] recognized we just want to say God bless
[38:47] you
[38:48] mine what can we say about this one but
[38:51] the radio we appreciate our brother
[38:58] obeyed oh my what a masterpiece god
[39:01] bless you my the manifestation of the
[39:08] original faith amen so what a blessing
[39:12] and he said so many inspired things it's
[39:18] such a masterpiece and I liked Whitney
[39:20] when he struck in octane and he said you
[39:23] know please God with rapture in faith
[39:29] and Enoch was the type of the bride and
[39:34] our inspiration is well the Son of man
[39:38] find faith when he returned I wonder if
[39:43] that faith is enrapturing faith well
[39:48] somebody's gonna answer the question
[39:50] somebody's gotta say well I have a
[39:53] revelation but the famous saying you
[39:55] just can't say you must have a
[39:58] revelation of what is that faith so you
[40:03] can't just say it's any faith because
[40:05] the Pentecostals they have faith so that
[40:09] will make them right many other
[40:14] religions a faith people that goes to a
[40:18] witch doctor they have faith but this
[40:22] faith we speak in my brother had to be
[40:25] restored had to be contained for had to
[40:28] be for dead to be bring back and God
[40:31] sent a prophet in this day to restore
[40:34] the faith now brother
[40:36] I believe that faith is on the earth
[40:38] tonight and I believe that faith is
[40:40] gonna be what what's gonna translate
[40:43] these bodies that we live in it's gonna
[40:46] change our 16 elements it's gonna bring
[40:49] you to a place like I spray the quote to
[40:52] a sphere where you never look before
[40:54] it's gonna be a faith that God will
[40:58] speak to you and Rama says it will be
[41:01] such a perfect faith that when you go to
[41:04] a hospital to pray for a sick person
[41:06] it's revealed to you what's gonna happen
[41:10] when you walk in there and when you walk
[41:13] in there brother the doctors is about to
[41:16] close the man's head and say he passed
[41:18] away he walking is their holy doctor
[41:21] it's been revealed to me that this man
[41:24] is gonna love he's gonna get up again
[41:26] why that's the fight Alleluia
[41:32] that's a faith that we're looking for
[41:33] and brother we trust in God that is
[41:36] going to happen in these meetings it's
[41:39] gonna happen to individuals you can have
[41:42] to pull you can have to draw you would
[41:45] have to say god that's me so thank you
[41:58] brother obeyed Oh God richly bless you

[42:15] place in tonight so I just wanna read a

[42:55] of way every heart right now may fall

[43:05] that you get victory Pope he says we are
[43:10] high priest offering up spiritual
[43:13] sacrifices the fruits of our looks and

[54:56] the earth with a curse amen finally
[55:02] revelations chapter 10 revelations
[55:11] chapter 10 I would like to read the
[55:15] first seven verses and I saw another
[55:19] mighty angel come down from heaven
[55:21] clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was
[55:25] upon his head and his face was as it
[55:27] where the Sun and his feet as pillars of
[55:31] fire and he had in his hand a little
[55:33] book open and he sat and he set his
[55:37] right foot upon the sea and his left
[55:39] foot upon on the earth and cried with a
[55:42] loud voice as when a lion roar äj--
[55:45] and when he had cried seven thunders
[55:48] attached their voices and when the seven
[55:51] thunders had hotter their voices I was
[55:53] about to write and I had a voice from
[55:56] heaven saying unto me seal up those
[55:58] things which the seven thunders uttered
[56:01] and write them math and the angel which
[56:04] I saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[56:06] earth lifted up his hand to heaven and
[56:09] swear by him that liveth for ever and
[56:12] ever who created heaven and the things
[56:14] that therein are and the earth and the
[56:18] things that therein are and the sea and
[56:21] the things which are daring that there
[56:24] should be time no longer but in the days
[56:27] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[56:30] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[56:34] God should be finished

[1:01:20] pastor chandler and we had a wonderful
[1:01:24] time looking at this subject from a
[1:01:27] beautiful simple perspective yesterday
[1:01:30] and it was such a faith challenging
[1:01:33] thing and they will pray that Allah will
[1:01:35] bless the labor of his servant over
[1:01:37] horse
[1:01:42] we thank God for this morning also the
[1:01:46] attempts and the expansion of his word
[1:01:48] to see faith in another dimension and we
[1:01:53] are grateful for His goodness and for
[1:01:55] the yielding of Pesaro blade o to the
[1:01:57] grace of God to bring the wonderful
[1:02:00] blessings to the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:02:04] I know God is an inexhaustible fountain
[1:02:10] and that we can never preach everything
[1:02:13] in the world we'll keep preaching till
[1:02:16] he comes amen so I prayed tonight one
[1:02:19] it's a blessing unto you and in advance
[1:02:21] I want to appreciate the servants of God
[1:02:24] I will come after because I know the law
[1:02:26] we use them also vary tremendously for
[1:02:29] horse may God bless you are and how I
[1:02:33] want to appreciate God's servants who
[1:02:36] are helping us to put the air in the
[1:02:40] Hoggins so the Hagen can make a
[1:02:41] beautiful sound they are more qualified
[1:02:45] than me I don't know of orders to stand
[1:02:48] before here but since it felt a lot of
[1:02:51] some of us they find the grace of God as
[1:02:54] men of God some came from far places
[1:02:56] some came from within the country just
[1:02:59] to be a support for those nations
[1:03:01] I pray that the Lord would bless your
[1:03:05] article that I pray the local SEO
[1:03:09] scholarship of us and bless everything
[1:03:12] you've done to support their missions
[1:03:14] churches who brought in their pastors
[1:03:17] who brought in their churches so many
[1:03:20] things you have done you know when a
[1:03:21] preacher comes to town is not expecting
[1:03:24] to see empty benches is expecting to
[1:03:28] preach to people and when God give us
[1:03:31] human beings like you it's such a
[1:03:33] privilege we can see that the Hall
[1:03:35] tonight is filling up so much until you
[1:03:38] may need to get expansion so we thank
[1:03:41] the Lord for what is done and we pray
[1:03:43] that you will be our blessing again this
[1:03:46] night so tonight if the Lord will be our
[1:03:52] help which I trust he will I want to
[1:03:55] speak on a subject just in line with the
[1:04:00] theme of the convention which I called
[1:04:04] shall he find faith on the earth amen
[1:04:09] you know when we read that scripture it
[1:04:14] was one asking by himself
[1:04:17] is that when the son of man comment it
[1:04:20] was referring to himself is there Willie
[1:04:24] fine faith so I can't say will I find
[1:04:28] faith because I am not the son of man
[1:04:32] amen
[1:04:34] so that's why I say shall he find faith
[1:04:38] on the head and for a subject we are
[1:04:43] looking at faith in this hour I want to
[1:04:59] trust God tonight to be very patient so
[1:05:02] I can read some from Brutus scriptures
[1:05:05] and the messages you pray along for me
[1:05:08] all right from the scripture that we
[1:05:12] have read in the Book of Luke chapter 18
[1:05:14] Jesus our Lord was drawing a parable now
[1:05:22] the part that parable is not as
[1:05:25] important as the thought was bringing
[1:05:28] her there we found a king who was unjust
[1:05:33] who does not care for God and has no
[1:05:37] regard for man so you can't even use God
[1:05:40] to appeal to him you can't go to him and
[1:05:44] say even if you don't honor the name of
[1:05:47] President Ramaphosa I think there's a
[1:05:49] president here at least fear the name of
[1:05:52] God is God no regard for it so you can
[1:05:56] pray in Jesus name to this man so
[1:05:59] meaning that for you as a Christian it's
[1:06:02] absolutely impossible for any man to get
[1:06:06] anything from this guy it does whatever
[1:06:10] I will are you catch an edge
[1:06:16] but here was a woman who said however
[1:06:21] we're in loops whatever Isis manner
[1:06:24] whatever Isis orientation however we
[1:06:27] could if thought is me I would get what
[1:06:31] I want
[1:06:32] [Applause]
[1:06:35] so we can say that women as an
[1:06:39] unstoppable fate is that right the woman
[1:06:45] as a face that does not take no for an
[1:06:49] answer she seemed to have something that
[1:06:54] you cannot challenge she must get what
[1:07:01] she wants that is what I want us to get
[1:07:06] out of there and I tell you she got what
[1:07:10] she wanted from an impossible King all
[1:07:19] right all right
[1:07:20] okay now you will expect Jesus Christ
[1:07:25] himself to be impressed by his own
[1:07:28] parable but I tell you it wasn't
[1:07:32] impressed he appreciate what that woman
[1:07:38] could do but it wasn't still impressed
[1:07:43] as powerful as that fed wash that isn't
[1:07:48] the kind of faith that impressed Christ
[1:07:52] I'm sorry I'm not doubling your revival
[1:07:57] but follow me on a road we're going to a
[1:07:59] journey
[1:08:02] shortly before Jesus give this parable
[1:08:05] this parable was in Luke chapter 18
[1:08:08] Jesus Christ has been impressed by a
[1:08:14] faith exploit one from the Jews and one
[1:08:18] from a Gentile
[1:08:20] in Luke chapter 5 some folks you know
[1:08:25] the Bible said when some people add that
[1:08:28] Jesus was in the house teaching the
[1:08:30] gospel my mind everybody and some
[1:08:36] friends for men for good friends and
[1:08:41] said this is an opportunity to procure
[1:08:45] Ilyn for our friend this their friend
[1:08:50] couldn't get off from the bed
[1:08:52] they said whether you able to get up or
[1:08:55] not if we have to bring you in
[1:08:58] wheelchair if we have to bring you on
[1:09:00] your bed or on a stretcher we catch you
[1:09:04] that mission Oh brethren when I go to
[1:09:09] that meeting there was no way for them
[1:09:12] to join the prayer line that crowd was
[1:09:16] too much but these guys were not going
[1:09:20] to buckle down they go to their friend
[1:09:23] and tell him you had going back like
[1:09:26] this what a night it takes we are gonna
[1:09:32] get you back alright it's gonna be all
[1:09:37] right
[1:09:41] and just like the woman in the parable
[1:09:45] they are fed knows no stoppage you can
[1:09:49] challenge it you can stop it
[1:09:52] the Bible said when they look for
[1:09:54] everywhere and they couldn't get their
[1:09:56] friends in they got the ladder and start
[1:09:59] walking on the roof they remove the
[1:10:02] roofs they remove the ceiling crazy guys
[1:10:05] what are you doing here our friend must
[1:10:08] go on better
[1:10:13] then when they move the rules and they
[1:10:15] lower their brother down here the Bible
[1:10:19] says Jesus saw their faith is it not
[1:10:31] wonderful I tell you is this is that
[1:10:35] tonight is still watch on that tonight
[1:10:38] but guess what by what is said in Luke
[1:10:42] 18 it doesn't seem to be too impressed
[1:10:45] still then can look chapter 7 some
[1:10:58] Israelites felt that this Centurion even
[1:11:02] though is a Gentile it was a Gentile is
[1:11:05] done so well for the economy and for
[1:11:08] their security and for their structure
[1:11:11] until even it's a favor
[1:11:13] we must avail him and they went to the
[1:11:17] Lord Jesus Christ and spoke on behalf of
[1:11:19] the Roman centurion the Roman centurion
[1:11:23] 7 was very sick and there's not much the
[1:11:26] specialist could do for him and they met
[1:11:29] a case they stood in the gap and they
[1:11:35] pleaded the cause of this man say he is
[1:11:39] worthy for whom deeds shall be done and
[1:11:42] the Bible said the Lord resolved and
[1:11:44] follow them when the Roman centurion
[1:11:49] heard that Jesus was coming
[1:11:52] excuse me it hasn't gotten to that
[1:11:56] extent it doesn't have to account you
[1:12:02] see this is the difference between the
[1:12:03] Jew and the Gentiles the gentle wants
[1:12:07] that touch they wants to be laid and
[1:12:11] upon I am NOT condemning in that gets me
[1:12:15] very well but at the Jews wanted - but
[1:12:19] the Gentiles don't wait for -
[1:12:23] because the channel of salvation never
[1:12:27] opens to them by hands lane the channel
[1:12:33] of salvation was open to them by spoken
[1:12:36] word while Peter yet spake the fate of
[1:12:44] the Gentiles rose to a level that great
[1:12:47] in South was excited and he has two
[1:12:51] purposes one protocol the protocol is
[1:12:55] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:12:59] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:13:01] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:13:03] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:04] but God was too excited before those
[1:13:08] folks could do that if fill them with
[1:13:10] the Holy Ghost and is for the center
[1:13:13] tonight Alleluia
[1:13:18] right on your seat things can take place
[1:13:22] tonight because it's still the same God
[1:13:26] we live in another economy we are
[1:13:30] unbeliever can unbelief cannot stop us
[1:13:33] brother browser inspire insight
[1:13:36] spiritual food in due season we have
[1:13:39] access to our healings and to everything
[1:13:43] we have need of even when the doctors
[1:13:46] are failed just click the wedge and
[1:13:50] things will take place of sin hernias
[1:13:54] disappeared at the preaching of the
[1:13:57] gospel of sin without hands stretch out
[1:14:00] at the preaching of the gospel and that
[1:14:03] wasn't in the Bible - that wasn't even
[1:14:07] with the prophet in this time among us
[1:14:12] only believe all things are possible
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:19] the ten times don't wait they just came
[1:14:24] to eat and as such I won't sorry I want
[1:14:27] to agree to the bread and in UK who I
[1:14:29] was told they are making special meeting
[1:14:33] house of these tonight god bless them
[1:14:35] amen
[1:14:36] all right so it was picks and things
[1:14:39] take place
[1:14:41] you love him tonight so this was your
[1:14:44] intention of this Roman centurion then
[1:14:47] they look at himself if you me that
[1:14:51] governs hundred people I cannot give a
[1:14:55] command as little me and anybody will be
[1:15:00] checking they will be reasoning they
[1:15:03] will be examining it could amounts to
[1:15:06] treason once I give it the muscle page
[1:15:10] and it must be carried out them by that
[1:15:13] orientation he had a picture of who
[1:15:16] Christ was and as an infant Christ is
[1:15:19] much more is that some nobody to put you
[1:15:25] under my roof right there where you ask
[1:15:27] pick the wedge when Jesus saw that it
[1:15:36] turns to the people again in exitement I
[1:15:46] said he turning excitement
[1:15:48] maybe must have picked one of them and
[1:15:51] say I have never seen such a faith like
[1:15:54] this not even one in Israel so true now
[1:16:00] is someone with the Jews it's so another
[1:16:04] one with the Gentiles but they came in
[1:16:06] Luke 18 despite all that we are saying
[1:16:13] it will look like after a while the
[1:16:18] impression and excitement died down when
[1:16:23] I come when the Son of Man comes will he
[1:16:25] find faith we can tell him what you have
[1:16:28] seen some things are excited you
[1:16:32] so far you know what this man Jesus must
[1:16:37] be looking for something else all right
[1:16:48] let's travel with our Lord a beach in
[1:16:53] the message unbelievers not in the God
[1:16:57] the Prophet said in the last days what
[1:17:03] it's going to take to stand is a
[1:17:06] scripturally trend church on the line
[1:17:11] for there's going to be camel
[1:17:14] impersonations rise the Bibles are as
[1:17:17] Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses so
[1:17:21] will this man of reprobate mind
[1:17:24] concerning the truth we realize that
[1:17:27] we're in that day to where anything can
[1:17:30] look so real but yet if it is of the
[1:17:35] scripture leave it alone no matter what
[1:17:41] kind of a sensation what results you
[1:17:45] find out of it the thing is even
[1:17:49] producing results the vindication of the
[1:17:57] true bride is that they finds themselves
[1:18:01] in the word
[1:18:03] don't say pardon resolved amen those are
[1:18:09] there who never came to light are
[1:18:11] getting resolved
[1:18:15] don't call it a fake result if you have
[1:18:19] a perfect understanding over ninety
[1:18:22] eight ones at the end time
[1:18:23] don't call it a fake result if you
[1:18:27] understand Matthew 13
[1:18:30] it is the pure rain falling on the just
[1:18:35] and on the unjust the dynamics of the
[1:18:40] true church and the false charge is in
[1:18:44] the hand of one man listen to me church
[1:18:48] what you need to come to your full
[1:18:52] adoption it's in the hand of Christ
[1:18:55] aha wait for it what the other guys
[1:18:59] needs to come also to their full
[1:19:02] adoption when we talk about adoption
[1:19:09] don't view it on the positive alone the
[1:19:14] Prophet who touch the trail of the
[1:19:16] bride's touch the trail of the serpent
[1:19:21] are you here Church if I became pontiff
[1:19:26] maximus it started as a saying the same
[1:19:31] became a ditch it looks for unless but
[1:19:35] the devil knew the journey was going
[1:19:37] until he came to his crowning and there
[1:19:40] was DP one monk crowny he's going to be
[1:19:43] given the heart of a beast and that
[1:19:49] would be his full adoption because
[1:19:52] brother Brahms that thou be Satan
[1:19:53] incarnate in fullness so the other side
[1:20:00] is walking right according to the
[1:20:03] scriptures this other side must also be
[1:20:07] walking right according to the
[1:20:10] scriptures
[1:20:11] we are winding up to a level the field
[1:20:15] sons of God 1 sons of God will speak and
[1:20:20] heaven will back up their ways don't
[1:20:29] struggle with dynamics dynamics doesn't
[1:20:32] belong to the right side alone it goes
[1:20:34] both ways
[1:20:35] and there is only one thing that all
[1:20:40] life's can interact with this is the
[1:20:44] reason judas iscariot as to interact
[1:20:47] with jesus christ there is no way can be
[1:20:50] inspired to do his work without
[1:20:52] interacting with Christ there is no way
[1:20:59] Peter could manifest himself as a
[1:21:01] genuine sage without interacting with
[1:21:04] Christ the two of them need Christ
[1:21:10] because it is the same ring it is the
[1:21:14] same as you hand and it is the same as
[1:21:17] all hand when Judas was ready to fulfill
[1:21:24] his own column Jesus gave him his
[1:21:27] dynamics that which they'll do it too
[1:21:31] quickly nobody has understood it was
[1:21:36] only him he received that message
[1:21:39] it became anointed and the Bible said
[1:21:42] eros oh and went to betray Christ for
[1:21:48] those of you struggle with it does the
[1:21:50] scripture
[1:21:54] [Applause]
[1:21:58] you love him tonight so we are living at
[1:22:02] the time that things can look so real so
[1:22:07] there are so many things competing for
[1:22:09] your loyalty
[1:22:10] and anything that gets your loyalty get
[1:22:14] your faith anything that gets your fits
[1:22:19] get your love mm-hmm anything that gets
[1:22:26] your love gets you affection get your
[1:22:29] resources get your support and that is
[1:22:34] your worship right there the prophets
[1:22:37] that we are living at a tower that
[1:22:40] things can look so real but if it is of
[1:22:44] the scripture even though it's producing
[1:22:48] results when a time many people are
[1:22:52] plotting to come back as a messiah in
[1:22:55] these last days they are with me I have
[1:22:58] been told to be at liberty but I won't
[1:23:02] trample on my liberties as brother
[1:23:06] Robledo said if it is nothing that what
[1:23:08] I won't say bye if it is in the water I
[1:23:11] know you love the way even if it feels
[1:23:14] strange you take it you go home and look
[1:23:17] at it and the spirit of the law will
[1:23:20] take care of it people are purporting to
[1:23:25] be messiahs in the end time and they are
[1:23:28] coming to show us Masonic designs let me
[1:23:35] tell you it is beyond you it is beyond
[1:23:39] you as a faithful minister to be telling
[1:23:42] the secrets of hearts
[1:23:45] in this sense of brother bruh I'm
[1:23:47] bringing Masonic designs I repeat it is
[1:23:51] beyond hero and I said it's not a spliff
[1:23:54] of tongue coach me anytime I say it is
[1:23:57] beyond you you say but they are getting
[1:24:01] and what are they getting they get one a
[1:24:06] mr. hodda brother brand sir we are not
[1:24:08] of those who take a gift by margin of
[1:24:11] error that you pray for me God is
[1:24:15] cultivating his gift that is where your
[1:24:17] message masonic this salmon gift is not
[1:24:21] cultivated is a gift by which Messiah is
[1:24:24] known and the Messiah been totally
[1:24:28] identified in these last days we don't
[1:24:31] need no man to identify in again this is
[1:24:37] my brother Brown search your pastors
[1:24:40] will never show this gift they will
[1:24:43] never show it there will be only one in
[1:24:47] unhinge that gift is not even the gift
[1:24:51] of william brown it is the gift of God
[1:24:54] himself
[1:24:55] he shortage to the Samaritans is
[1:24:58] shortage to the Jews but he never showed
[1:25:01] to the Gentiles but he left us a promise
[1:25:04] according to Luke 17 title even does
[1:25:08] shall it be in the day when the Son of
[1:25:11] Man is been revealed and right here is
[1:25:15] the hell of that revelation so since it
[1:25:22] will not be here physically if acquitted
[1:25:25] that grace to a son of man the son of
[1:25:30] man is not the son of man
[1:25:33] hallelujah that was why when he came he
[1:25:36] testified I was not the one that
[1:25:39] appeared at Ohio River I was only the
[1:25:42] person Neera
[1:25:45] you are not fitting on me and man is
[1:25:49] what will fair why you are fitting on
[1:25:52] the unfailing body ward of the son of
[1:25:55] man if you live by that arrow you better
[1:26:01] repent if we take a scripturally trained
[1:26:10] Church to survive this hour all right
[1:26:13] all right that's just by the side
[1:26:15] where's he going you love him tonight
[1:26:19] all right
[1:26:21] let's enjoy it a lot a little bit here
[1:26:23] no matter what kind of a sensation what
[1:26:27] results you'll find out if it isn't the
[1:26:30] scripture stay away from it stay right
[1:26:33] with the word now you say you are
[1:26:36] getting the people won't believe you
[1:26:38] don't want them to be believers you
[1:26:40] don't want them to get excited I'm what
[1:26:42] topping the things of God the professor
[1:26:46] no I'm trying to get them to faith faith
[1:26:52] comment by hearing hearing decreed that
[1:26:57] might be in the harmonic but that's not
[1:27:00] the Bible faith comes by hearing the
[1:27:03] Word of God you see why is not impressed
[1:27:09] I'm coming faith coming back here in the
[1:27:12] world that's who that is what brings
[1:27:15] faith to hear the word of God so if it
[1:27:21] is not the Word of God is their faith
[1:27:23] but not the faith of this hour
[1:27:27] all right it's a now listen real close
[1:27:32] to this remark faith don't forget to get
[1:27:37] this now Phet is designed to see what
[1:27:42] God wills and once
[1:27:47] there is no knowledge that can do that
[1:27:51] faith alone is designed and given to the
[1:27:55] human race to find out what the will of
[1:27:59] God is and you take your feather to God
[1:28:03] and it doesn't focus with the word then
[1:28:05] leave it alone
[1:28:06] you got faith but you gotta run faith
[1:28:11] but when your god-given faithful cause
[1:28:14] you with the wedge you are directly in
[1:28:17] line and zeroed in oh my god across this
[1:28:23] our great hour that we live in faith
[1:28:27] designed to see what God wants how do
[1:28:30] you see it through the camera of his
[1:28:33] word is promise this is the full
[1:28:37] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:28:38] now today you see faith is designed to
[1:28:42] do this sanphet today sees the same
[1:28:45] thing AFET of the church today should
[1:28:49] see the same program of God I want you
[1:28:52] to not miss this now that church today
[1:28:56] that's called of God will suddenly see
[1:28:59] the program of God
[1:29:01] ah because the program of God is written
[1:29:05] out here and the holy spirit by faith is
[1:29:09] the one who reads it and set it together
[1:29:12] then I'll call him man say is filled
[1:29:15] with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit
[1:29:18] say a certain way to do something in the
[1:29:21] Bible and this man comes around and say
[1:29:24] oh that is fanatism could the only
[1:29:28] spirit be real only spirit and deny his
[1:29:31] own word no it has to stay with the
[1:29:37] wedge
[1:29:37] [Music]
[1:29:38] [Applause]
[1:29:43] coming back to this fetch that excited
[1:29:48] Christ I want to get this very clearly
[1:29:52] when Jesus came the Prophet told us you
[1:29:59] may have different languages to describe
[1:30:01] his ministry but he told us that Christ
[1:30:05] preface ministry the first two phases
[1:30:11] II called accorded phases in some way II
[1:30:15] called the pools when they use the word
[1:30:19] God explained is a ministry to him truth
[1:30:23] fishing experiment so these are
[1:30:27] languages I believe the believers are
[1:30:29] familiar with the pools face that other
[1:30:33] now the first two phases thank you sir
[1:30:37] the first two phases or the first two
[1:30:41] pools brother Brahm called the Ilyn
[1:30:43] service now since it came to bring the
[1:30:50] Ministry of Christ wash it follows that
[1:30:53] the same way the Ministry of Christ rang
[1:30:56] that is the same way the Ministry of the
[1:31:00] son of man been revealed by a son of man
[1:31:03] will also work so this was why when he
[1:31:11] came the fastener was doing in India six
[1:31:16] then he brought the Salmons telling
[1:31:20] their secrets just to raise their faith
[1:31:23] brother Brahm said that was not healing
[1:31:26] itself but you can raise your faith to
[1:31:29] receive your request now brother Brown
[1:31:33] called these two phases or these two
[1:31:36] pools eCollege the Ilyn service and the
[1:31:42] immediate clear by the study of the
[1:31:44] scriptures and the message that you
[1:31:47] really don't need a great level of faith
[1:31:52] to enjoy those blessings I'm showing you
[1:32:01] why is not so impressed he taught us
[1:32:06] that with human fate what a proper
[1:32:09] column and fate because brother Bram
[1:32:11] taught levels of faith it's at with
[1:32:17] human faith you can enjoy any of those
[1:32:21] things that is where an unbeliever who
[1:32:25] has never believed and who will never
[1:32:28] believe who will never become our church
[1:32:31] remember if we came in here tonight and
[1:32:34] is just listening or you testify to him
[1:32:37] of the seven power of God to heal the
[1:32:40] sick to resident it can increase and
[1:32:43] receive his miracle what you need is
[1:32:50] your belief of only ease this is my
[1:32:54] brother Brahms and many believed him to
[1:32:56] be really la but they never said that he
[1:32:59] must be a lodge and he actually healed
[1:33:05] them and it did wonderful things but the
[1:33:09] danger is that human faith doesn't go
[1:33:12] far when he had a mighty convention and
[1:33:17] there was nothing to eat and he gave
[1:33:19] them bread and so forth the soy does an
[1:33:22] outstanding miracle because right there
[1:33:25] God was growing his wheat plant in his
[1:33:28] which cultivation is with maturing is
[1:33:32] with Avastin is with taking it to the
[1:33:35] mill processing is with making it flour
[1:33:39] and from flour bakery and baking it as
[1:33:42] bread and sharing it right in his and
[1:33:45] there it was running all the protocols
[1:33:49] it was too much for these people
[1:33:52] is that what kind of a man is this
[1:33:56] there's an ANA we have come to a
[1:33:59] conclusion we shall make him our king
[1:34:02] it's in your Bible and the Bible said
[1:34:05] Jesus withdrew from them these people
[1:34:09] contributed their money and chartered a
[1:34:12] boat or a ship to go and look for Jesus
[1:34:17] at the other side in other to install
[1:34:20] him as king don't you think they have
[1:34:23] faith but the Bible said look look look
[1:34:28] look these guys are not doing it because
[1:34:32] of his words huh
[1:34:35] they are doing it because of the
[1:34:38] miracles they are not doing it because
[1:34:43] of his thought pool they are doing it
[1:34:46] because of the benefits of the first and
[1:34:49] the second all this while Jesus has not
[1:34:57] begun to sound his message this was the
[1:35:03] face then are you enjoying the Lord that
[1:35:06] was the face he has began his message he
[1:35:11] has not began to teach his revelations
[1:35:14] he has not began to teach his doctrines
[1:35:18] so it so easy for them to pack it along
[1:35:23] whatever is saying them they are
[1:35:25] comfortable with it as long as they can
[1:35:28] enjoy all those wonderful miracles but
[1:35:31] let me tell you it will come to a point
[1:35:33] that those miracles will still be there
[1:35:35] what the depth to which the world will
[1:35:38] go they will reject everything and the
[1:35:42] guys who wanted to install him as king
[1:35:45] will be ready to crucify in
[1:35:48] as a sinner that is when it begins to
[1:35:55] enter into another fate dimension then
[1:36:01] when it began to sound is message all
[1:36:05] these guys who are excited who are so
[1:36:08] impressive by the logic of faith but
[1:36:12] they are pushed and they're pulling
[1:36:18] except you eat my flesh pasta repeat it
[1:36:24] again as I accept you eat my flesh and
[1:36:29] you drink my blood no life in excuse me
[1:36:34] pastor
[1:36:36] that's last date three weeks ago when
[1:36:39] you came to my house and my wife and I
[1:36:43] we serve you food can you remind us of
[1:36:45] the men who we served that's taking
[1:36:57] particular doesn't look like okay thank
[1:37:10] you Pastor I thought you will say we
[1:37:13] serve you the ribs of a human being
[1:37:18] isn't that exactly what you are
[1:37:20] preaching you want to turn us to
[1:37:23] cannabis except we heat your flesh good
[1:37:26] whoever hears such a thing as to stay
[1:37:29] with you no way today I pack my family
[1:37:32] and we live your church this were the
[1:37:39] same guys who wanted to make him King
[1:37:42] yesterday by the time Jesus looked back
[1:37:47] you know it was a gradual breaking of
[1:37:50] the church until it remains 70
[1:37:55] Jesus didn't make much a simple it catch
[1:37:58] making it worse each day is one
[1:38:01] revelation or the other until another 70
[1:38:07] or 50 something I don't know depletion
[1:38:10] had to take offense and left even that
[1:38:14] night service Jesus thought everybody
[1:38:16] had gun but by the time in look back is
[1:38:19] this awesome to have standing I want you
[1:38:24] also call what are you waiting for
[1:38:30] but I had faith yesterday they were
[1:38:33] pulling signs and wonders clouds and
[1:38:36] storms and reigns with this is my voice
[1:38:42] came now they couldn't absorb it fetch
[1:38:46] with that continuity's not a godly fate
[1:38:54] then Peter say excuse me pastor unto
[1:38:59] whom shall we go
[1:39:04] we have reached their final Bostock even
[1:39:09] if we don't understand it who was there
[1:39:12] here because as far as we are concerned
[1:39:15] you cannot be wrong
[1:39:18] what you say is always right the
[1:39:21] capstone revelation you must have is
[1:39:24] that this message cannot be wrong
[1:39:27] [Applause]
[1:39:29] sometimes it may come contrary to your
[1:39:33] personal judgment or to what you believe
[1:39:36] I think you know but dig into these
[1:39:39] blessings because it can never be run
[1:39:43] [Applause]
[1:39:47] that is the capstone revelation you must
[1:39:50] have that one will keep you standing
[1:39:52] that one will keep you consistent that
[1:39:55] will keep you faithful it isn't the
[1:39:58] multitude of what you can understand
[1:40:00] where it is how much you can absorb
[1:40:03] because Jesus can never be wrong
[1:40:07] [Applause]
[1:40:14] it was the push of Revelation that shuts
[1:40:18] Jesus - okay okay if that's the way you
[1:40:22] feel that you get more of it and they
[1:40:26] kept teaching them and they kept
[1:40:28] teaching them but these other guys they
[1:40:31] so went away and they never came back
[1:40:34] this is what the prophets and the
[1:40:37] message spiritual food in due season I'm
[1:40:39] trying to reach tonight please bear with
[1:40:41] me because faith cometh by hearing and
[1:40:45] here in the wedge in the message
[1:40:49] spiritual food in due season paragraph
[1:40:52] four is that I want you to get built up
[1:40:55] now in the only horror cools of God in
[1:40:59] the faith the faith of this hour isn't
[1:41:05] it interesting that Tommy husband and
[1:41:08] all these great men of God who talk
[1:41:11] outstandingly about the power in the
[1:41:13] hour they saw around the Prophet and yet
[1:41:17] they couldn't come into the message of
[1:41:19] the house is it an interesting lebron
[1:41:26] Robledo was saying I've had Lee ever
[1:41:28] seen any man even in a message who gave
[1:41:31] the level of compliments Tommy husband
[1:41:34] gave to brother Brown
[1:41:37] he said we preach Christ in lift Christ
[1:41:41] Christ walking the streets of Java's
[1:41:44] over some of those words were too
[1:41:46] powerful I'm Tommy Osmond said I'm
[1:41:49] conscious of what I'm saying
[1:41:55] but if it come into the fullness of the
[1:41:58] wedge no I want you to get huge up now
[1:42:09] in the only Oracles of God in the faith
[1:42:13] the fate of this hour the faith it's
[1:42:18] going to take my faith listen to your
[1:42:22] prophet then have ours in any age for
[1:42:28] this us to be rapture in faith so it's
[1:42:36] gonna be beyond something that will give
[1:42:39] you the benefits of the first pool it's
[1:42:42] gonna be beyond something that will give
[1:42:45] you the benefit of the second pool what
[1:42:52] you need to enjoy those sins I repeat is
[1:42:55] your belief of whom you think Jesus is
[1:42:58] [Applause]
[1:43:00] but the Prophet said it doesn't last is
[1:43:05] that human faith has never been enough
[1:43:08] it wasn't enough then and it will not be
[1:43:12] enough now this was when the book of
[1:43:16] Galatians chapter 1 or chapter 2 is that
[1:43:19] Paul never said I live by my faith in
[1:43:23] the Son of God but is that I live by the
[1:43:29] faith of the Son of God two different
[1:43:33] things
[1:43:36] did you catch that if I live by my faith
[1:43:41] in the Son of God what that means is
[1:43:44] that whatever I think whoever I think
[1:43:47] the son of God is that is what I'm
[1:43:51] living back
[1:43:53] and many lived by that and a still
[1:43:55] living by that that is what some of you
[1:43:59] think that message is just it's just an
[1:44:02] avenue for additional information you
[1:44:06] still appeal to all kind of books
[1:44:10] teachings and preaches is that after - a
[1:44:13] proper comparison if you are still at
[1:44:17] the gate of a lingering between two
[1:44:19] opinions at this hour I don't know where
[1:44:23] you will end up you are seat drying
[1:44:30] comparison postures we gotta wake up
[1:44:34] church amen because brother Bram said if
[1:44:38] we stop the church the children we go
[1:44:41] into the garbage cans
[1:44:43] if we find graceful present the beauty
[1:44:46] of this wedge Alleluia and move the
[1:44:50] offense into the realm of channels to
[1:44:53] see the total picture of this hour then
[1:44:56] we find out our Cloris on our switch
[1:44:59] this great revelation is
[1:45:01] [Applause]
[1:45:07] [Music]

[1:45:13] Oh may God help us George I'm trusting
[1:45:19] God to present this sense in the level
[1:45:22] of grace that you revealed it to me he
[1:45:29] said is gonna take my faith now I live
[1:45:36] by faith in the Son of God what I
[1:45:41] believe the Son of God is you see why
[1:45:44] Jesus in Matthew 13
[1:45:45] or is this extensor whom do men say i
[1:45:50] the son of man harm some say you're
[1:45:55] Elijah is when they are saying that they
[1:45:58] were excited coating orders they never
[1:46:01] taught it will come back to them some
[1:46:04] say one of the prophets
[1:46:06] some say why Jeremiah
[1:46:08] maybe as I had a reserve all those
[1:46:12] Saints at the belief of people about
[1:46:16] Christ's own and watch they thought a
[1:46:19] wash are you college but it on to them
[1:46:25] okay let's leave what what as I say
[1:46:27] let's come on into you
[1:46:31] let me tell you when you now have to cut
[1:46:35] yourself you've gotta be careful all the
[1:46:39] guys have been excited cotton orders
[1:46:41] they all kept why you know why you
[1:46:48] cannot answer that anyhow brother brands
[1:46:55] have PETA dropped into the channel
[1:46:58] [Applause]
[1:47:00] you've got to drop into a channel where
[1:47:05] it is no longer you opinionated on who
[1:47:11] you think he is it's got to be a gift
[1:47:15] from God a revelation this was why when
[1:47:20] he met a declaration the Lord said flesh
[1:47:24] and blood has not revealed this to you
[1:47:27] it is beyond your human senses it is
[1:47:31] beyond your reasoning it is beyond your
[1:47:34] intellect hallelujah it is beyond your
[1:47:37] five senses you surrendered to the super
[1:47:41] sense your man faith was nothing of that
[1:47:47] and it is not enough now to come into
[1:47:54] this rage of the our brother Bram said
[1:47:59] you got no thoughts coming you must be
[1:48:04] ready to lose your mind how many are
[1:48:08] ready to lose their minds tonight you
[1:48:12] must be ready to give up your opinions
[1:48:14] you must be ready to give up your
[1:48:17] feelings you must be ready to give up
[1:48:20] this is the way I see it doesn't matter
[1:48:23] how you see what matters is our Christ
[1:48:26] himself
[1:48:30] and brother Prem said if you are honest
[1:48:33] and sincere and you will believe Christ
[1:48:36] will reveal his mind to you is that you
[1:48:43] God knows thoughts coming so let's drop
[1:48:47] our thoughts tonight let's drop our
[1:48:50] opinions tonight
[1:48:51] let's drop our feelings tonight let us
[1:48:54] take what he says if we don't read it
[1:48:57] from him plant a search each we don't
[1:49:00] accept revelation by impression we don't
[1:49:03] accept revelation bioassay in it forget
[1:49:07] about me
[1:49:08] as such it because Christ says so and
[1:49:11] how does Christ speaking these last days
[1:49:14] through the bad piece of his prophets
[1:49:19] [Applause]
[1:49:29] what must we do to do the works of God
[1:49:33] Jesus and such is that believed on him
[1:49:37] umeå sense only dissension these last
[1:49:41] days
[1:49:41] behold I sank behold eyes behold I only
[1:49:50] descends in such a messenger let us take
[1:49:55] what she says and we will be fine don't
[1:50:00] be uncomfortable your seats be fine you
[1:50:04] are a child of God he meant human fate
[1:50:12] wasn't enough then and it is not enough
[1:50:15] now it takes the very fate of the Son of
[1:50:19] God to drop into a man's heart so that
[1:50:23] it can receive the Lord of glory into
[1:50:25] the temple not made with hands this was
[1:50:30] a living faith I live by the faith of
[1:50:33] the Son of God Paul did not say that he
[1:50:37] lived by faith in the Son of God
[1:50:40] it was the faith of the Son of God that
[1:50:43] had given him life and kept him living
[1:50:46] in Christian victory if you want to live
[1:50:50] in victory asserts the faith of the son
[1:50:54] let every man who would be a lie let all
[1:50:59] these were beat that truth let's survey
[1:51:08] the name of the Lord
[1:51:09] Oh know what I am the message perfect
[1:51:13] fit is that all I've been doing is to
[1:51:15] receive it in a bracket is all right
[1:51:19] posture it starts from you believe in
[1:51:22] the healings and if you can believe all
[1:51:24] those first pose I can pull and you can
[1:51:27] come into the opening of the wedge which
[1:51:30] is the tadpole it's a vindication though
[1:51:32] you are the seed of God
[1:51:36] many enjoyed the fests they enjoyed the
[1:51:41] second it wasn't your money that took
[1:51:44] the profile on the world seven times it
[1:51:47] was the money of the pentacle stars
[1:51:49] Assemblies of God United Pentecostal one
[1:51:53] nest to nest Trina's five fulness Pascua
[1:51:56] and no squirrel it was their money not
[1:52:01] years but don't forget a preacher
[1:52:06] message present stage of my ministry and
[1:52:09] in that message he said I was a good guy
[1:52:12] when I came among you and God was using
[1:52:15] me to heal your sick and raise the dead
[1:52:17] oh my disciple because the face is
[1:52:21] changing I became a bad guy what do they
[1:52:26] hold against the prophets who they
[1:52:28] listen to me charge why do they hold
[1:52:30] against our prophet they had no problem
[1:52:33] with the healings this is where every
[1:52:36] testimony of the Pentecostal man if my
[1:52:38] brother Brahms centered along the
[1:52:40] exploits but when it comes to the
[1:52:46] opening of the wedge there's an e met
[1:52:49] miss takes they did not query the
[1:52:53] festival they did not question the
[1:52:56] second poll why are you challenging the
[1:52:58] taught poll why why are you challenging
[1:53:05] the topple this is the only offense of
[1:53:10] William Braja they will tell you India
[1:53:15] Bush if there was one man who started
[1:53:19] post-world War II whether it was William
[1:53:22] Brown they can tell you either where we
[1:53:24] team here out there where with him there
[1:53:27] I will read out there Los coches where
[1:53:29] is thought out this and that happen then
[1:53:32] we say with such a grace that you know
[1:53:35] we didn't even see it you have there why
[1:53:38] didn't you follow on so
[1:53:42] you see you will have stayed on with
[1:53:45] that but when it started coming into
[1:53:49] interpreting the wedge it made mistakes
[1:53:53] brother Brahms that you will call me a
[1:53:56] prophet and you will come back and said
[1:53:59] I make mistakes with the wedge I cannot
[1:54:02] put it together you we understand what
[1:54:05] you meant now you call me a prophet and
[1:54:09] you say I'm messing up with the wedge I
[1:54:11] can't understand and even tonight I
[1:54:15] can't understand and if you think that
[1:54:23] that problem is only how there I want to
[1:54:26] bring it home tonight for those of you
[1:54:35] who believe that since the opening of
[1:54:38] the word we should throw out all the
[1:54:40] messages from 46 to 62 you are a fanatic
[1:54:44] on one hinge and for those of you who
[1:54:52] touch that whatever is from 1946 to 62
[1:54:57] is the only thing every other fan says
[1:54:59] they are after we don't care you are not
[1:55:01] a fanatic on the other hand both of you
[1:55:08] have got faith but you got a wrong one
[1:55:10] you won't offer simple understanding of
[1:55:16] life tells you that life can only
[1:55:18] survive when there is motion
[1:55:24] anytime life's become static that life
[1:55:27] is dead life does not come to a full
[1:55:32] stop until it has fully grown and call
[1:55:35] himself an adult are we here so don't
[1:55:41] get stopped if God if God never took the
[1:55:46] profits in 1962 is because it's got some
[1:55:49] muffins for you up to 1965 if you don't
[1:55:57] take the revelation that comes by the
[1:55:59] seals you cannot be a complete believer
[1:56:07] you see as a bridge all right I'm
[1:56:10] preaching one of the Dickens's I
[1:56:13] shouldn't play with the cannon I should
[1:56:15] as you shoot the fire I hope you realize
[1:56:25] what you're talking about if I start
[1:56:28] shooting man you find grace to accept a
[1:56:31] shot amen
[1:56:33] you love him tonight all right
[1:56:38] so if God continues amen we must follow
[1:56:43] the continuity of the wedge this is what
[1:56:47] the Prophet started a message it will
[1:56:50] appreciate many people and even said the
[1:56:53] Holy Ghost filled before the shoes were
[1:56:55] opened said dr. robots of the penty of
[1:56:59] the United Pentecostal a man filled with
[1:57:01] the Holy Ghost
[1:57:02] it wasn't switched talking those folks
[1:57:05] but then it came to a point I began to
[1:57:08] say if you are actually filled with the
[1:57:12] Holy Ghost you will follow the word to
[1:57:15] the storehouse
[1:57:16] [Music]
[1:57:21] amen oh I pretty low we have for tonight
[1:57:29] you will follow the world as it were
[1:57:32] moves that was when this seals became
[1:57:36] opened which I'm coming to you will
[1:57:38] appreciate the connection brother Bram
[1:57:40] said that Bible in my hands became what
[1:57:43] a new book I mean ever era is rather he
[1:57:49] said because many things the Lord
[1:57:51] revealed came better than my personal
[1:57:55] understanding they came better than my
[1:57:59] personal judgment meaning that our faith
[1:58:02] wasn't perfected until the opening of
[1:58:07] the seals so don't get talked follow the
[1:58:15] continuity of the word when you are able
[1:58:19] to follow the warning continuity it will
[1:58:22] solve our every question after all it is
[1:58:25] not you that is a state now that is my
[1:58:28] reputation that is a stake brother brown
[1:58:31] says say what I said I will be
[1:58:35] responsible I'm hiding under the
[1:58:37] beautiful cover tonight don't hold me
[1:58:41] responsible for nothing hold brother
[1:58:43] Brown responsible
[1:58:45] [Applause]
[1:58:52] you love him tonight
[1:58:55] so don't guess talk Church of the Living
[1:58:58] God our faith is on a journey it's been
[1:59:01] rests within a bracket and until we get
[1:59:04] to the end of the bracket we cannot stop
[1:59:08] because perfect faith we produce
[1:59:11] perfectly love for a perfectly ruptured
[1:59:15] church that is the word French all right
[1:59:23] let's go on in other to come to this
[1:59:28] feet I love the quotation brother
[1:59:32] obliterate we're sick or need to come
[1:59:34] back to eat we need the son of man that
[1:59:40] was why I said when the Son of Man
[1:59:44] returns
[1:59:45] shall we find faith when we may return
[1:59:53] do you think is talking of the rapture
[2:00:00] when it comes for rapture it doesn't
[2:00:02] need to find faith it's only coming for
[2:00:06] the faithful
[2:00:07] [Applause]
[2:00:14] are you yeah because there'll be no
[2:00:17] salmon at a time
[2:00:18] no Pridgen shortly before he comes let
[2:00:22] me tell you shortly before he comes in
[2:00:28] within the error of his coming
[2:00:31] conviction will have left the Spirit of
[2:00:35] the Lord will be withdrawn if that is
[2:00:39] only will be holy still
[2:00:40] he that is filthy will be filled this
[2:00:43] till the coming of Jesus does not give a
[2:00:47] second chance it'll rupture coming so
[2:00:51] it's not looking for faith for the
[2:00:53] rapture coming if he's to look for faith
[2:00:56] it's gonna be a son of this son of man
[2:00:59] coming when is it when we able to a
[2:01:08] place that we fit the rest and will
[2:01:10] trust the law to take over the rest for
[2:01:12] you
[2:01:13] you love him tonight now the Prophet can
[2:01:17] you please put on the picture for me
[2:01:20] that picture you and I agreed upon the
[2:01:23] brother
[2:01:23] praise the Lord pastor can i am i
[2:01:26] permitted all right there with me all
[2:01:30] right now brother Brahm started teaching
[2:01:38] us about the thoughts on the Son of Man
[2:01:42] amen and he said when God came in flesh
[2:01:46] in the body called Jesus it came to
[2:01:51] fulfill what Moses in Deuteronomy told
[2:01:56] Israel a prophet likened unto me amen
[2:02:01] and said that color was necessary
[2:02:05] because people need to be taught that we
[2:02:08] are right Alleluia and it is only a
[2:02:12] prophet who brings God to the people
[2:02:15] this prophet is not an ordinary prophet
[2:02:18] is a capital P prophet even when you
[2:02:20] read it in the book of Deuteronomy the
[2:02:22] scripture Rajat has a capital P
[2:02:24] profits for you to know that this would
[2:02:28] be a god profit but in terms of sonship
[2:02:31] ministry you will assume the identity of
[2:02:34] the Son of Man are you following so it
[2:02:39] came as the son of man to do what to
[2:02:42] bring the way of right so that a charge
[2:02:45] an alpha charge can be inaugurated that
[2:02:51] was why after the Son of man has done
[2:02:54] justice to his coming Pentecost took
[2:02:58] place is that right and the fire of the
[2:03:03] revelation of Pentecost continuing
[2:03:05] officiant age oh thank you my brother
[2:03:09] do I know how to use this okay the red
[2:03:11] button haha technology all right so the
[2:03:16] fire of that revival of the teaching of
[2:03:18] the son of man continued in Ephesus that
[2:03:20] was why you saw so much light and less
[2:03:24] of darkness because people we are living
[2:03:28] off of the Son of Man revival the Son of
[2:03:33] Man River produced the church in
[2:03:35] Jerusalem it produced the Apostles amen
[2:03:41] which included Apostle Paul was Patton
[2:03:46] with Ed opposed to Peter and the rest of
[2:03:48] them are you here and a touch that the
[2:03:53] church must be established on apostles
[2:03:55] and prophets foundation that is the only
[2:03:58] foundation that Christ will be the
[2:04:00] cornerstone contending for the faith
[2:04:04] which was once delivered so you could
[2:04:11] say the light continues in Smyrna but
[2:04:15] why the addends manner was not as
[2:04:17] awesome as were they had in Ephesus amen
[2:04:22] the first of darkness has begun to do
[2:04:26] what exact price on the charge
[2:04:29] human and gradually by the time they
[2:04:33] came to the top church age greater
[2:04:35] pressure so much so that falsehood
[2:04:39] was much more than the truth by the time
[2:04:44] they reach the far first church age it
[2:04:48] was almost in complete darkness because
[2:04:53] this were the era of persecutions people
[2:04:56] don't want to hear the truth as was once
[2:05:00] delivered and some great guys whom God
[2:05:03] will have even used for dispensation of
[2:05:06] purposes they buckled under pressure
[2:05:09] people like Polycarp he never came to
[2:05:14] the full realization of his sonship oh
[2:05:17] yes the prophets that you've got to
[2:05:21] reconcile yourself to each but Polly
[2:05:24] Chabad a bit of the leaning towards
[2:05:26] organization because it doesn't want to
[2:05:28] offend and they robbed him from coming
[2:05:31] to his full potential that's what the
[2:05:33] Prophet said let me tell you if you a
[2:05:38] son of God you a daughter of God if God
[2:05:40] has healed you nothing will jump up with
[2:05:43] your eternity but listen to me
[2:05:46] you can shortchange yourself you might
[2:05:50] never come to the full realization of
[2:05:53] your sonship because you fail to
[2:05:56] reconcile yourself to fullness is a
[2:05:59] quotation that was Upali kibosh if you
[2:06:06] get your glory you will see Saul King
[2:06:09] Saul you will see him there but you're
[2:06:12] not Jerusalem that was called the city
[2:06:13] of David brother Brahms I should have
[2:06:15] been called the city of Saul
[2:06:20] but because I failed to keep the total
[2:06:24] Word of God so this is a challenge not
[2:06:30] for your association but for you
[2:06:32] personally do a favor to your soul
[2:06:37] tonight sorry
[2:06:43] so by the time it reached the first Jay
[2:06:46] Church edge you can see that darkness
[2:06:48] has taken over it was the darkest at the
[2:06:52] foot age then God stepped in under sin
[2:06:59] again but this time it couldn't bring
[2:07:03] the fullness but it started the work of
[2:07:06] Reformation and that was why you see
[2:07:09] that the light portion expanded a bit
[2:07:13] though in significantly but it was more
[2:07:17] better than what it was in Thyatira you
[2:07:22] follow him then it got a bit more light
[2:07:25] and started becoming conspicuous in
[2:07:29] Philadelphia it was the age of open door
[2:07:34] bar by the time it came into laudation
[2:07:37] its recessed again you know it's
[2:07:42] research it was in this laudation age
[2:07:50] that the fullness of the wedge that
[2:07:54] whirlpool was born into manifestation
[2:07:59] for you know watch
[2:08:01] oh my when it came to this age let me
[2:08:06] say something here it doesn't matter
[2:08:07] when I stop or if I can go don't worry
[2:08:09] the Lord will take care now when it came
[2:08:12] to this age people realized laudation
[2:08:16] age started as a Pentecostal age and for
[2:08:21] the first time it was a true account it
[2:08:24] witnessed the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:08:27] as it was in this beginning
[2:08:30] are you hearing what the Prophet said
[2:08:36] what a baptism did was muttering study
[2:08:39] gifts back into the church now that
[2:08:47] baptism was a template to bring the
[2:08:50] fullness because the people who have
[2:08:53] been born now they needed to grow life
[2:08:57] can only survive when there is motion if
[2:09:03] life becomes taunted that is a still
[2:09:05] faith or death so which tells us the
[2:09:09] Pentecostals cannot be the end of the
[2:09:12] redemption plan but it's a vital plan in
[2:09:16] the redemption plan so the life that
[2:09:21] gave us justification under luta in
[2:09:24] saudis and gave us sanctification in
[2:09:27] Philadelphia as brought to us
[2:09:30] restoration of gift allowed this year
[2:09:33] that was the beginning of law decision H
[2:09:37] what you see that is not the end to life
[2:09:41] so allow the same age we have the true
[2:09:44] justification we have the true
[2:09:46] sanctification we have the true baptism
[2:09:50] but if a child is born shouldn't he grow
[2:09:53] he must grow so this child was born in
[2:09:57] 1906 by the time he came to 1950s is
[2:10:01] that a crime for something better than
[2:10:04] milk
[2:10:08] [Applause]
[2:10:11] are you yeah
[2:10:13] milk will suffice for a charge as some
[2:10:17] certain stage but when the Huggins grew
[2:10:20] better stronger than milk continuous
[2:10:23] giving of milk with stunts the growth of
[2:10:25] that child because now it needs to break
[2:10:28] bones in need some solid that was why in
[2:10:35] 1962 coming 20 1963 the cry for revival
[2:10:39] was so much fast and prayer we need a
[2:10:45] revival and God Hodge their cry watch
[2:10:51] the kadhi way crying for in 1963 God
[2:10:55] give it because the Prophet said what
[2:10:59] they are crying for is the unveiling of
[2:11:01] the 10 - that's what I said in the film
[2:11:04] him n so but when this forward
[2:11:08] was born into manifestation that church
[2:11:11] who was crying for Aviva pushed it away
[2:11:17] that was why the light recess so quietly
[2:11:22] God was pushed out of loud sa that was
[2:11:28] why in Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 to
[2:11:31] 21 a terrible sad picture was presented
[2:11:35] before loud this young age it was
[2:11:38] Philadelphia New Age Philadelphian age
[2:11:41] was the age of the open door but just an
[2:11:46] age after Philadelphia became the edge
[2:11:49] of a closed door
[2:11:52] and who did a shot out they shot up life
[2:11:57] they shot out Christ they shot up lights
[2:12:06] this is what the darkness began again
[2:12:10] darkness is absence of light that is
[2:12:15] absence of life this was like the
[2:12:18] diagnosis of God over loud this year is
[2:12:21] that the unrighteous naked miserable
[2:12:26] poor blind and on top of it and they
[2:12:30] know it
[2:12:31] not some little gems of God we are
[2:12:41] trapped in that darkness
[2:12:45] how are we gonna get him out brother
[2:12:50] Brahms all through the church edges God
[2:12:55] was identifying himself as a son of God
[2:12:59] working of the Holy Spirit except or to
[2:13:03] bring these people how he must return
[2:13:08] again as the son of man because it takes
[2:13:20] the prophetic ministry
[2:13:24] to place the word correctly and it takes
[2:13:29] them what place correctly to deliver the
[2:13:33] people you can see that it is not signs
[2:13:39] and wonders that truly delivers signs
[2:13:42] and wonders were still taking place in
[2:13:44] loud Asia even till now but you know
[2:13:49] what the professor is that the attach do
[2:13:55] you know what is that
[2:13:56] he said the a composite redemption -
[2:14:03] ugly brother is that so in recognizing
[2:14:07] your D on its message the Prophet
[2:14:10] brought this again and he searched
[2:14:14] everywhere they were crying before
[2:14:16] Reviver he said why were they crying Ben
[2:14:22] Christians they felt the pull of the
[2:14:24] hawa he said but they don't know what
[2:14:28] had already taken place in cities - they
[2:14:32] were crying instance the treaty were
[2:14:35] crying in 64 they were see crying we are
[2:14:38] as it was in 63 God and sadhya cry when
[2:14:42] the a cry was answered they pushed it
[2:14:44] out
[2:14:45] and in 1964 brother bran like the son of
[2:14:50] man who came the first time as to stand
[2:14:53] over Los Angeles and say oh Capernaum
[2:14:59] those tens of spiritual significance
[2:15:02] then brother Brahmaputra is that not in
[2:15:06] any way like my lord
[2:15:07] is that what i'ma say Oh
[2:15:10] Capernaum or Los Angeles uddaka let
[2:15:15] yourself at the name of hinges all the
[2:15:18] profit away ascend to you in the name of
[2:15:21] the Lord you have killed is happy Holi
[2:15:24] or how has come then is had not in any
[2:15:28] way like rice what is that I want to say
[2:15:32] this I believe that Pentecost allowed
[2:15:36] this year is come past Redemption
[2:15:41] brother bran said that is my opinion you
[2:15:45] can have yours I choose the prophets
[2:15:48] opinion because that is perfect fetch
[2:15:52] [Applause]
[2:16:02] this design not the Lord I may never
[2:16:06] read it in the Bible
[2:16:07] this is I not the Lord did you read it
[2:16:11] later answer me what God was pleased to
[2:16:16] make this design not a lot but of all
[2:16:18] scripture that you and I need to be
[2:16:21] thoroughly furnished unto good works so
[2:16:24] if the professor this is my opinion I
[2:16:27] stand by it
[2:16:28] if I don't stand by his own easy user we
[2:16:31] take inside she is come past Redemption
[2:16:37] and that has been some four five six
[2:16:41] years ago I'm quoting will umbra then I
[2:16:44] told the church remember Chicago what
[2:16:49] happened in Chicago for on the prophets
[2:16:53] of Baal again kadaj against these days
[2:16:57] Elijah
[2:16:59] and what was a showdown on man camel

[2:20:07] remember somebody paid Elia is that so
[2:20:11] sorry but we'll make another arrangement
[2:20:13] and the arrangement they made was
[2:20:15] exactly where the Prophet said God said
[2:20:18] the Lord can never feel when they all
[2:20:24] came in they could resist sitting and
[2:20:27] appearing like he told them then when
[2:20:31] they invite the Prophet to come to their
[2:20:33] puppet that brother who brought
[2:20:35] invitation say excuse me I I gotta talk
[2:20:42] before brother Brahm talk it said you
[2:20:45] might not you may not believe him you
[2:20:47] might have a bad impression of him what
[2:20:50] I want you to know it knows what is
[2:20:52] talking about and is not afraid of any
[2:20:56] of you this was what he told me we

[2:21:05] we'll be we are here brother he told me
[2:21:08] this is the color of your shirt that's
[2:21:10] what where we are it he told me it is
[2:21:12] the color of your time that's what you
[2:21:14] are wearing I think God was given the
[2:21:17] final message to date loud Sen Church
[2:21:21] Pentecost everybody who had that rule of
[2:21:27] repentance but they refused to repent
[2:21:31] because the Lord will slay them brother
[2:21:37] Brown came to the porridge you give all
[2:21:40] the things that we follow and he said if
[2:21:43] there's anybody with your Bible contrary
[2:21:46] opinion come here they couldn't come out
[2:21:50] till today they couldn't come out after
[2:21:54] service after the service they all went
[2:21:58] to the Prophet problem I don't know -
[2:22:00] wait is mine I will buy 70 of these tips
[2:22:04] and send to all my parishes as a matter
[2:22:07] of fact we all are coming to be baptized
[2:22:09] over again
[2:22:12] then in 1963 are you following me
[2:22:16] brother Brown brought the message
[2:22:18] indictment indictment is not judgment is
[2:22:25] to give the public report of an enquiry
[2:22:28] that we have done an investigation and
[2:22:32] you are implicated we shall now send you
[2:22:35] for trial so when the profit was written
[2:22:41] the reports to the church world he say
[2:22:45] you ministers in the camp gathered in
[2:22:48] Chicago this is about five or six years
[2:22:52] that you promised coming to be baptized
[2:22:55] over again is that but you haven't come
[2:22:59] because the price is too great you link
[2:23:04] too much on your organization's and it's
[2:23:07] not happy you to appreciate the truth is
[2:23:10] that but you know what you have done
[2:23:12] brother Brahm said the church was
[2:23:14] committed on pardonable same oh yes go
[2:23:19] read the message and document that's
[2:23:21] what it says
[2:23:22] it brought it blue six as their final
[2:23:24] sentence and you know I in the message
[2:23:28] unpardonable sin brother Bram said if
[2:23:31] you hear the truth and you acknowledge
[2:23:34] it is the truth but you refuse to work
[2:23:38] image dia is your pattern a person went
[2:23:45] acosta allowed this year acknowledged it
[2:23:48] was the truth they said they are coming
[2:23:52] to be baptized but they never came in
[2:23:55] the message indictment I repeat brother
[2:23:58] Brahm said they committed on pardonable
[2:24:01] same and from that day he said God will
[2:24:04] never save them as a denomination
[2:24:08] is that what the seeds of Karuma hinder
[2:24:11] will come out so there is not a lycra
[2:24:15] team charge it is written individual
[2:24:20] then in 1964 it pronounced them past the
[2:24:25] redemption in 1965 it pronounced them
[2:24:29] dead so what you have been seen since
[2:24:32] 1965 is a dead form of loud Asia and
[2:24:36] when something is that is such a rough
[2:24:39] name does why is not getting any better
[2:24:42] with them if you are still getting
[2:24:45] excited by that you have not come into
[2:24:47] the light but since they are dead
[2:24:56] anything death cannot obtain a true life
[2:24:59] there are people of God in lower this
[2:25:02] year who a carrier of God's it James
[2:25:07] you can call it James you can call it
[2:25:10] genes of God these ones are not going to
[2:25:14] stop dead there they want something
[2:25:18] better they wants to go on to higher
[2:25:22] ground the inheritance is not before
[2:25:26] Jordan they want to cross over Jordan in
[2:25:36] harder to cross over Jordan they need a
[2:25:40] ministry beyond the Ministry of the
[2:25:43] messenger to allow the C&H
[2:25:48] hey hey so that God prophet must return
[2:25:53] as the son of man again this is my
[2:26:03] brother Brahms edge in between his
[2:26:06] ministry as the Son of God in the church
[2:26:08] edges and his ministry as the son of
[2:26:11] David in the Millennium in between is to
[2:26:15] return a game as the son of man and I
[2:26:23] tell you he actually returns a man and
[2:26:28] when he returns he never found fate on
[2:26:31] earth if he found it wouldn't introduce
[2:26:42] is because I never found in other to
[2:26:50] bring back the faith you see if you
[2:26:53] started a message masterpiece this is
[2:26:56] where you will appreciate what the
[2:26:57] Prophet said he said I am the Alpha and
[2:27:00] the Omega is a party never said it was
[2:27:04] everything in between I'm an evil a
[2:27:07] recluse because everything in between is
[2:27:13] actually not God there were some
[2:27:19] dangerous teachings by even some
[2:27:22] messengers in the church edges this is
[2:27:27] why some people become confused whether
[2:27:30] to assess the prophets position that
[2:27:33] certain people the messenger of that age
[2:27:38] Martin Luther was a smoker is pocked
[2:27:41] pipe and was the messenger for his age
[2:27:45] swallow it
[2:27:49] is that the Jews are hungry Christ and
[2:27:52] they need to be as dominated and it was
[2:27:56] the messenger for the age after
[2:28:01] Pentecostal age of love Dacia they
[2:28:03] taught Trinity hmm
[2:28:07] the truth of pure goodness of one God
[2:28:10] and that in pyjamas age from that
[2:28:16] falseness falsehood entered a charge
[2:28:19] v wasn't pure again this was my brother
[2:28:24] Brown came in the message the bridge
[2:28:25] between the seven Church edges and the
[2:28:28] opening of the seven cells the bridge is
[2:28:32] too close loud Asia and to open another
[2:28:35] dispensation this was why when it came
[2:28:39] to do that he said what as the Lumbee
[2:28:42] doing for two thousand years sitting on
[2:28:46] the throne before it came again as the
[2:28:50] son of man through the ministry of his
[2:28:52] messenger he said it's been sitting
[2:28:55] there interceding for the ignorance of
[2:29:01] the people you see why the question as
[2:29:05] the messenger in that age that was why
[2:29:08] it was called the age of reformers the
[2:29:12] entire sermon church age is our only
[2:29:15] true prophets in this sense of whom the
[2:29:19] word of the Lord came to Paul and
[2:29:21] William Blaha Alpha and Omega but not
[2:29:28] everything in between
[2:29:32] [Music]
[2:29:37] are you following just not everything
[2:29:41] him between but for him to come again
[2:29:46] for perform a looter
[2:29:49] John Wesley and are the rest of those
[2:29:52] great men of the hope an age for them to
[2:29:54] make it the lamp stood interceding for
[2:29:57] the ignorant then the Prophet came back
[2:30:02] he said there is coming a time when to
[2:30:05] be sincere in wrong teaching you will be
[2:30:07] sincerely wrong he said Trinity came
[2:30:12] from the pit of hell is that you will
[2:30:16] ask me are all those two Rotarians of
[2:30:18] the ages would they go to hell
[2:30:20] he said no son this is why the land has
[2:30:24] been there interceding for that
[2:30:26] ignorance for one day in revelations
[2:30:30] five alleluia the lamb came and took the
[2:30:35] book to bring back prophetic ministry
[2:30:41] again the man to whom the what of the
[2:30:45] how attempt to Alleluia okay how many
[2:30:54] minutes I have twenty minutes all right
[2:30:56] praise the Lord let's see what we're
[2:30:59] doing to animal that's why the lamb came
[2:31:01] to bring back what to bring back the
[2:31:06] pure watch as it was again in the
[2:31:09] beginning to short the Alpha bride and
[2:31:14] they will make a bride will be the same
[2:31:17] judge watch this beautifully what you
[2:31:21] plant in the plant a season undergo some
[2:31:25] rottenness in the ground
[2:31:28] if you dig it off you are going to stand
[2:31:32] hopeless but allow the grounds to keep
[2:31:35] covering wait for the harvest exactly
[2:31:40] what you planted you will get in
[2:31:42] multiples but the process of getting
[2:31:46] names might be sawed off this is exactly
[2:31:51] God was following nature in order to get
[2:31:55] back is great variety so in between in
[2:32:00] common as son of God and Son of David he
[2:32:03] appeared again as the Son of Man
[2:32:06] brother bronzer to do us let's see what
[2:32:12] we do a son of man when he appeared he
[2:32:21] never found what is you love but it
[2:32:26] wasn't an hopeless case you know I there
[2:32:29] were people on Hajj who carried the
[2:32:34] likeness of what Abram had they don't as
[2:32:44] yet
[2:32:44] understood Judy her but there's great
[2:32:48] hope for them this is what the Son of
[2:32:52] Man was sent to bring them to that
[2:32:56] realization then we are locked in the
[2:32:59] gates of loud this year there were lot
[2:33:03] indicates of out of air
[2:33:11] and you watch they started crying for
[2:33:16] deliverance do you realize that because
[2:33:20] the conditions of that house wasn't okay
[2:33:24] for them it doesn't meet with their
[2:33:27] configuration but I'm so glad the people
[2:33:33] who were interested in for them went
[2:33:35] only to one person in that dream in that
[2:33:39] vision in their revelation everybody run
[2:33:42] - brother Brandi said delivered a it's a
[2:33:48] delivered delivered and brother Brahm
[2:33:52] was wondering how can I do it then a
[2:33:57] great stretch of a william brown and
[2:34:01] they rose up and said House of El give
[2:34:05] way and all those who could find the
[2:34:11] linkage with Abraham started tripping
[2:34:15] out what is the job of this son of man
[2:34:22] brother Bram said the germ of this son
[2:34:25] of man I won't be able to read much
[2:34:27] again now but I'll bring you the job of
[2:34:31] this son of man was Malachi for you
[2:34:34] ready
[2:34:36] he said didn't the Bible said the Son of
[2:34:40] Man will return and we can say yes the
[2:34:44] Bible says and brother Bram said and
[2:34:48] that is Malachi 4 and to make us
[2:34:55] appreciate what he meant is that when it
[2:34:58] begins to sound his message so what is
[2:35:04] the job of Malachi 4 is to turn the odds
[2:35:08] of the children back to the father's
[2:35:13] then the prophet expanded a scripture is
[2:35:16] that actually it is turning their heart
[2:35:19] back to the faith of the Apostolic Faith
[2:35:24] [Music]
[2:35:27] the hearts that have been let us trade
[2:35:29] the faith that has been taken away is to
[2:35:33] be restored through the Ministry of
[2:35:38] Malachi for I will dis restoration they
[2:35:43] tonin be done will it take us to a
[2:35:46] laboratory or it's surgery theater and
[2:35:51] perform a surgery and remove our hearts
[2:35:55] and put the ads of the Peter and the
[2:35:58] rest of them in there it's fit connected
[2:36:02] yet there'll be a surgery but not the
[2:36:06] physical one any such in Revelation 10
[2:36:13] he said he will reveal the mysteries of
[2:36:16] the seven thunders they read it for us
[2:36:19] an opponent is aright
[2:36:20] then he said it is this divinely
[2:36:24] revealed mystery truth that achieves
[2:36:27] Malachi 4 it is revelation 10 that we
[2:36:32] accomplish Malachi for the surgery that
[2:36:36] we need is revelation 10 when we undergo
[2:36:41] the surgery we will come out as Malachi
[2:36:44] 4 is that clear to the hesitance
[2:36:50] amen so we need to know what those seals
[2:36:57] amen I will not shy her from it we need
[2:37:01] to know what those seals are
[2:37:03] he told us is such he will in Revelation
[2:37:07] 10 7 is that it will reveal the
[2:37:09] mysteries of the world seven thunders
[2:37:11] seven thunders which are the revelations
[2:37:14] contained where in the seven seals is
[2:37:18] our research is our probably knowledge
[2:37:21] today I love that
[2:37:25] so the revelations that the seals watch
[2:37:28] is what we need to have a ton of us
[2:37:37] so if we really want our hot stones
[2:37:40] let's look for that a revelation that is
[2:37:43] in horse
[2:37:45] once we know them and we start enjoying
[2:37:49] them and start living by them
[2:37:52] automatically something will be taking
[2:37:55] place is that what it was says we want
[2:38:01] our heart turned that's our destination
[2:38:06] when I was coming from Nigeria South
[2:38:10] Africa was my destination is that right
[2:38:13] but for me to get to South Africa and
[2:38:16] was imported South African here wish it
[2:38:21] will be wrong for me even if I enjoy all
[2:38:24] the comforts of the plane to think that
[2:38:26] that plane is South Africa if the heart
[2:38:33] wisdom let him up understand if you be
[2:38:36] wrong for me to take that plane
[2:38:39] as my South Africa but I need that plane
[2:38:44] if I must catch to South the Word of God
[2:38:53] is a certain sound amen do you agree
[2:38:58] with me on that if I sell my even if I'm
[2:39:02] in business class and I sit on my chair
[2:39:05] like a sofa or like a bear and start
[2:39:08] rolling on it am I in South Africa and
[2:39:12] if I think brother Kosmas that that is
[2:39:15] South Africa to me and we should change
[2:39:18] myself when I came into South Africa and
[2:39:21] injured my gauge I went to Durban I'm
[2:39:24] into a nice ball if I have time there
[2:39:27] are many other places to go to I won't
[2:39:29] get to those places on the plane
[2:39:33] the plane was landing in South Africa
[2:39:36] and I begin to enjoy the fullness that
[2:39:41] is what the seven thunders are something
[2:39:44] to land us in our destination this is
[2:39:48] our arrival we near the opening of the
[2:39:53] word to achieve this in our lives the
[2:39:57] Word of God has no confusion and said
[2:40:00] those who choose to be confused you
[2:40:05] think I don't believe in the virtues
[2:40:06] with all my heart you will never make it
[2:40:09] without this but it will take something
[2:40:12] from my tortoise in you brother Bram
[2:40:15] said where you are born again all this
[2:40:18] was automatically in you and he said as
[2:40:22] you fellowship along the ravine watch

[2:40:30] without adding himself then we bring it
[2:40:32] to a full stature that is the face of
[2:40:35] the hour and we must not shy away from
[2:40:39] it you love in French okay let me read
[2:40:48] it to you let's say the content Oh glory
[2:40:54] to God at the end of the day we find out
[2:40:58] that we are saying the same thing we
[2:41:00] just need for that grace and revelation
[2:41:02] to come into its fullness you love him
[2:41:06] too Nagi
[2:41:08] hallelujah Church the tour pool is the
[2:41:12] opening of the sails and the content of
[2:41:15] what was opened is the seven thunders
[2:41:17] amen brother Brown said that is the job
[2:41:21] of that son of man is that it is in
[2:41:26] bringing the contacts that connect you
[2:41:28] that gives you an avenue to fellowship
[2:41:31] with your bridegroom that connects the
[2:41:34] body to the head my so the son of man
[2:41:38] was necessary to bring back their faith
[2:41:42] that we bet that will establish a
[2:41:44] relationship between God and is bright
[2:41:48] again because their marriage is on right
[2:41:51] now the wedding is on right now that is
[2:41:54] right to everyone of God the Bride of
[2:41:57] Christ say Amen
[2:41:59] the only thing we are waiting for is the
[2:42:02] shopper you love him French don't feel
[2:42:11] bad about her is the word of the Lord
[2:42:15] amen thought pool was the opening of
[2:42:18] them seven seals I want to read
[2:42:20] something here
[2:42:21] amen you love him let me see if I can
[2:42:25] get it within the little time I have
[2:42:27] left
[2:42:29] brother Brown searched the several seas
[2:42:35] was the mystery of the book is all right
[2:42:38] and he said until we concede those who
[2:42:42] watch those seven seals are sealed in we
[2:42:45] are only presuming them things so we
[2:42:49] lived by presumption until 1963 this is
[2:42:56] your prophet talking amen
[2:42:58] because it was in 1963 that the seals
[2:43:02] were opened and s aren t we see it we
[2:43:05] are presuming not denomination as a
[2:43:08] right to interpret it no man has a right
[2:43:12] it is the lamp odors that is the reason
[2:43:16] the thing is in such a scruple tonight
[2:43:21] they pick up a bluetooth option and the
[2:43:24] run of air to one side and say this is
[2:43:26] it another one picks another one
[2:43:28] doctrine run off to the side and said
[2:43:31] this is it and each one builds a
[2:43:33] denomination on diet many of us have
[2:43:36] come through that already until we got
[2:43:39] hundreds of denominations within the
[2:43:41] message again
[2:43:42] you know why you know why the problem is
[2:43:48] here jr. Jackson dream I'm gonna close
[2:43:54] on that give me time on day because this
[2:43:56] is important for you when the seals were
[2:44:00] to be opened
[2:44:02] God gives seven dreams if your recess is
[2:44:07] this the time and each of them was
[2:44:09] perfectly interpreted which became
[2:44:12] prophecy and prophetic now the one I'm
[2:44:16] talking of now is that of jr. Jackson he
[2:44:19] saw the Brethren surrounding a stone
[2:44:22] structure like a pyramid and it's a
[2:44:24] problem explaining things that are
[2:44:27] around it is that right let me let me
[2:44:29] read what she calls Dodge
[2:44:31] let's read what he calls that you love
[2:44:34] him tonight we enjoying the Lord in such
[2:44:42] and I stood there a little bit till the
[2:44:46] only spirit revealed it does junior
[2:44:48] Jackson telling him I said the entire
[2:44:51] Bible as much has been revealed to man
[2:44:54] truth justification sanctification
[2:44:56] despotism of the Holy Ghost the party
[2:44:59] seemed in Jesus name and no distance has
[2:45:02] been revealed but there is secrets that
[2:45:05] are eat inside because the Bible is
[2:45:08] sealed with seven seals
[2:45:10] and what's good here to find it that
[2:45:13] morning when those seven angels came
[2:45:15] down and blasted a heart and rocks flew
[2:45:18] everywhere seven angels you remember
[2:45:21] resinous on such amen it's a return back
[2:45:24] to Java's oval where you come from for
[2:45:27] the seven seas of the seven mysteries
[2:45:29] will be watch will be opened amen
[2:45:32] so while he was explaining things here
[2:45:35] the bread and we're rejoicing and the
[2:45:38] touch that was all of it but the Prophet
[2:45:40] took a crowbar and knock off the edge
[2:45:42] and means that was revealed something a
[2:45:45] precious white stone looking so innocent
[2:45:48] as if no light as fallen upon each
[2:45:51] brother bronzer I always thought those
[2:45:54] things were things outside the Bible
[2:45:56] it's about God corrected me and said
[2:45:59] they couldn't be out of the Bible
[2:46:01] because they'll be adding and
[2:46:03] subtracting they add things in the Bible
[2:46:05] upon whom nobody has understood then God
[2:46:12] told him go west and they went to sunset
[2:46:16] you are not the account of sunset seven
[2:46:19] angels came down they gave him watch
[2:46:22] they gave him the prophets the mystery
[2:46:25] of nothing less in the image and when
[2:46:28] they finish with him they told him to
[2:46:29] come back to Jeff to do what to preach
[2:46:32] the seven seals are you writers so
[2:46:36] weather sealed outside sealed inside is
[2:46:39] to preach the content of the seals hey
[2:46:44] man all right but you see well it went
[2:46:47] away
[2:46:47] brother Brahm said even Gina Jackson
[2:46:50] himself told him it looked off and
[2:46:52] before he came back as it is in every
[2:46:55] Exodus
[2:46:56] everybody got at the opinion of what
[2:46:58] they thought it was thought pool in
[2:47:01] challenge now this one fluid this this
[2:47:04] one fluid ah this one fluid is and the
[2:47:07] professor they made several
[2:47:08] denominations what Claude called us out
[2:47:12] of people brought themself back into it
[2:47:15] again but I will not remove the fact
[2:47:17] that in the midst of counterfeits there
[2:47:20] will be original let's see what a man
[2:47:23] who brought the son of man ministry told
[2:47:25] us those things are himself and now pity
[2:47:29] him for tonight you love him
[2:47:33] let's see what he caused all right that
[2:47:37] morning when those seven angels came
[2:47:40] down and blasted the earth and the rocks
[2:47:43] flew every way seven inches Trudy and
[2:47:46] said return back to Javas oval from
[2:47:50] where you come from for the seven seals
[2:47:52] of the seven mysteries will be watch
[2:47:54] opened yeah we are today understanding
[2:48:00] sir concede
[2:48:02] in a few days if God willing we will
[2:48:06] understand the correctness of marriage
[2:48:08] and divorce and all these things that
[2:48:12] got us opened every seal the mistress
[2:48:16] since the foundation of the world and we
[2:48:19] have been enjoying the presence of His
[2:48:22] blessings that is true this day this
[2:48:25] scripture is fulfilled
[2:48:28] [Music]
[2:48:31] [Applause]
[2:48:32] revelations contained in the seals these
[2:48:36] are the revelations today we know what a
[2:48:39] white ostrich is isn't it we can't deny
[2:48:42] that before this is open we call him
[2:48:44] Jesus Christ after the opening of the
[2:48:47] seals we saw him as a son before the
[2:48:50] opening of the seals were sent seventy
[2:48:52] weeks of Daniel remain seven years
[2:48:53] but the brands that have that the
[2:48:55] opening of the seals it became three and
[2:48:57] a half years before the opening of the
[2:49:00] seals eternal security was a question
[2:49:02] after the opening of the seals God took
[2:49:05] care of it
[2:49:06] if you think you understood seven
[2:49:08] serpent seed by what I taught in 1958
[2:49:12] you need to check your understanding
[2:49:15] because it was running a trail that's
[2:49:18] why I'm stopping tonight until he
[2:49:20] brought it to even those who claim they
[2:49:24] believe the message in John chapter 8
[2:49:28] certain Jews the Bible said and the Jews
[2:49:32] who believed on Jesus Christ
[2:49:34] I may never read out what Jesus told
[2:49:38] them is that if you continue god bless
[2:49:43] you sir if you continue if you are not
[2:49:46] stopped by the healing if you are not
[2:49:48] stopped by this if you continue to the
[2:49:50] opening you will be my disciples indeed
[2:49:54] even though the Bible said they believed
[2:49:57] on Jesus they had questions with him
[2:49:59] right there
[2:50:01] many have come this far believing but
[2:50:05] they couldn't go into the total
[2:50:07] revelation of the total let's get our
[2:50:11] church back to Genesis to Revelation
[2:50:14] company all them divinely revealed
[2:50:16] mystery truths of God by the time we
[2:50:19] teach the church the deeper things of
[2:50:21] God in the message running from the
[2:50:24] presence of the Lord
[2:50:25] but the Blum said every make-belief
[2:50:27] would be locked away and the Church of
[2:50:30] God will come to perfection last coach
[2:50:32] and I will stop last coach and I will
[2:50:43] stop there with me
[2:50:44] the professor we're not drinking and
[2:50:48] carry on is not sane but the whole thing
[2:50:50] is because of unbelief because if you
[2:50:53] believe and Jesus Christ to be son you
[2:50:56] are absolutely not going to do those
[2:50:58] things you believe that if that spawn of
[2:51:01] God does not commit sin you must believe
[2:51:05] the whole thing listen faith jesus said
[2:51:09] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[2:51:11] him that sent me
[2:51:12] that's everlasting life shall not come
[2:51:15] into condemnation was already passed
[2:51:17] from death to life do you believe that
[2:51:19] the truth yeah it lays there isn't
[2:51:23] nothing else that you can do only
[2:51:25] believe and if you believe them lead to
[2:51:28] immoral things we just drop off as you
[2:51:32] believe you become loved I'm coaching
[2:51:37] the Prophet are you here amen and love
[2:51:44] is God and you begin to wind yourself
[2:51:46] into Christ and these other things you
[2:51:50] don't have to quit doing they just quit
[2:51:52] themselves there's just not desire to do
[2:51:57] it
[2:51:57] they worship of him Porsche has no more
[2:52:00] conscience or desire for saying Amen
[2:52:03] when the worship eyes Porsche is when is
[2:52:06] born again his old nature dies out and
[2:52:09] the new nature sets in then it becomes a
[2:52:12] part of God and the body of Jesus
[2:52:15] the bride will be part of his body he
[2:52:18] was their watch and their bride will
[2:52:20] love to be the word what a dead
[2:52:23] to word add to what Luther's

[2:52:37] word jam on top of Jam life on top of
[2:52:43] life to bring out the full stature of
[2:52:46] the plight of the Lord Jesus Christ this

[2:52:53] upon watch will bring out the full
[2:52:57] stature of the pride of the Lord Jesus
[2:53:00] Christ so let's go back to our
[2:53:03] temptations
[2:53:04] let's go home and be feasting on the
[2:53:06] wedge spiritual food in due season as

[3:00:23] thank you Jesus
[3:00:25] my appreciator brother Kelly Sully Sully
[3:00:30] find faith on the earth and I believe
[3:00:34] that faith is already been revealed and
[3:00:37] I believe the pride as a secret to that
[3:00:40] faith because he said the six years
[3:00:46] didn't bother him but it was that
[3:00:49] seventh seal that he wanted all his life
[3:00:53] was that seven see you brother
[3:00:56] he says the six years one place he says
[3:00:58] they dead seals but is his under that
[3:01:02] seventh seal was a live seal was the
[3:01:06] seven thunders he says any connected to
[3:01:10] the faith that will change this body and
[3:01:14] translated brother from from corruption
[3:01:18] to incorruption from natural to
[3:01:22] supernatural so the six teams won't do
[3:01:25] that it already played out the pub seal
[3:01:28] is for the Jews the sixth seal is the
[3:01:32] tribulation but the Seventh Seal
[3:01:36] Alleluia that's a deal
[3:01:39] steal that the same is going to take us
[3:01:42] out of here because under there he said
[3:01:45] as seven things pagan one two three four
[3:01:48] five six seven and he said why he
[3:01:51] connected it to the thunders hallelujah
[3:01:55] he said this mighty angel came down all
[3:01:58] the earthly angels was finished and he
[3:02:03] said and the seven thunders of the world
[3:02:05] and throw their voices out he says is it
[3:02:09] something to let us know how to enter
[3:02:12] into that rapture in faith well knew
[3:02:16] your brother
[3:02:17] there's something under that seven seal
[3:02:19] that the pride is caught together
[3:02:22] revelation and I believe she has a
[3:02:25] revelation that the Son of Man was the
[3:02:29] only one listen man
[3:02:31] not even the prophet could reveal the
[3:02:33] Seventh Seal it was the mighty angel
[3:02:40] that flew in to him and the ninety
[3:02:48] priests the Seventh Seal brother
[3:02:50] it wasn't the prophet it was at my
[3:02:54] danger that came in him and what he
[3:02:57] spoke under that seven sail wasn't a
[3:03:00] prophet it was a son of man and he said
[3:03:04] the rapture the faith the bride needs
[3:03:07] lays under the Seventh Seal hallelujah
[3:03:14] it's not going home she'll it's a
[3:03:17] rapture in sailor he says that seven
[3:03:21] seal is like a rocket ship out five
[3:03:24] stars
[3:03:25] those five saucisson another five it
[3:03:28] keeps going on and on and on he says
[3:03:31] until you break into eternity
[3:03:35] so they tried to stop it here they tried
[3:03:39] to stop it here but everyone must and
[3:03:41] when they stopped Ian Paisley
[3:03:44] when they stopped papers there brother
[3:03:47] you cannot stop it then laughs cheering
[3:03:50] faith is up on the earth and the plan is
[3:03:53] a revelation is gonna take out of here
[3:03:57] come on people man this you deliveries
[3:04:00] here
[3:04:01] that's your laughter Issei oh that's the
[3:04:03] one that's got annoying Tina there's the
[3:04:06] one that anointed the Prophet oh I'm so
[3:04:10] happy brother and listen man I'm so glad
[3:04:13] brother Deli says our destination and I
[3:04:17] love that you see the message brother
[3:04:19] mem says Oh God
[3:04:22] he said you know I've been very Salas of
[3:04:29] the seeds that I planted for this body
[3:04:34] he says because the rain is coming he
[3:04:38] says I mean the real rain the chilling
[3:04:43] rain is coming brother first that we
[3:04:46] have is just a shower and a blessing
[3:04:49] year but brother Ivan the real rain
[3:04:52] that's gonna change these bodies Oh
[3:04:55] hallelujah
[3:04:57] and can I tell you something he didn't
[3:04:59] say that I sold but what I planted
[3:05:03] there's a big difference between sowing
[3:05:06] and planting so when you just throw the
[3:05:10] sheet and you throw it there and the
[3:05:13] birds come and some bees among rocks
[3:05:16] some is among Thrones but he said I
[3:05:19] planted
[3:05:23] come on please back please back to me
[3:05:26] brother please back when you plan
