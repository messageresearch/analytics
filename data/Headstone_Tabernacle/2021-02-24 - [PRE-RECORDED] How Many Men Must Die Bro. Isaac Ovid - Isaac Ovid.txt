bride around the world out of different nations countries peoples and tongues and there's going to be a bride called by this end time message followed by the spoken word it's going to be a spoken word brian she will be the very manifestation of the spoken word of god try to make it a reality here this morning in the name of jesus inhabit the praise of your people in jesus name i ask it amen and amen this is the final quote i believe that the same thing we live in today god bearing record of his word by vindicating what he said he would do now we know that this is the day of salvation where god is calling men from the world from a life of sin into a life of service and in the day that god has poured out his spirit from an eye great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day this is when the former and lettering have fallen together and we know that there is supposed to be great signs and wonders which great denominations have turned on but i'm thankful for these open doors and the inspiration it gives the young men like your pastor here and i'm beginning to get old i know that my days are numbered i know now that these young men shall take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the lord if he doesn't come in my generation i hope to see him i'm looking daily for him i'm keeping myself prepared for that hour and i wanted to close and say this may these young men praise god isaac and anthony may they take this message and sweep it on fearlessly to the coming of the lord could we all stand oh hallelujah and sing all over the world the spirit is moving oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god all over the world the spirit is moving [Music] over and over oh as the general greet somebody in jesus name oh hallelujah [Music] coming of the lord as

waters cover the sea [Music] give the lord a hand of praise this morning hallelujah you love the lord this morning you appreciate his presence this morning you appreciate his grace this morning you appreciate the holy spirit this morning [Music] amen amen amen amen will i greet you this morning in the precious name of jesus christ you may be seated for a few minutes before i get to the message so i lied to greet one and all in the precious theme of the lord jesus christ this morning i'm reporting for duty amen i would like to salute my precious pastor with the oven and his wife sister anne-marie and i'd like to amen greet you on behalf of my wife also it is truly a great honor to stand before the purchase of the blood of jesus christ on behalf of my wife and i we would like to express our sincere appreciation to the pastor the elders and the entire headstone tabernacle family for the confidence and the trust that you have placed in us we are truly humbled and stand united to do all we can to make a church that would make a revival amen i do want to send special greetings to those connected on the internet wherever this tape may be played and to all the visitors in our gates cheers the season has changed hallelujah the season has changed it's not changing it has already changed hallelujah and i believe something is going to happen this morning we know what's going to happen because god's prophet told us to expect what's going to happen so it should come as no surprise to us what's about to take place it should not be a surprise to you because for 40 years you'll be hearing promise after promise after promise so when we move from promise to manifestation then it's time to rejoice it's time to celebrate it's time for revival it's time for the outpouring it's time for deliverance amen you may be seated brother preached five messages to lay the platform for setting the church in order amen the ministry of jesus christ identified by prophecy the true church identified by prophecy rebuilding the true church the robe of the holy spirit and last week the true joshua generation identified in another ephesians and i believe that the bride has turned the corner can the church say amen and for those who were here last thursday but the terence exhorted the church before the prayer meeting on the conditions that must be met for you to receive the baptism of the holy ghost and the holy spirit moved all over the prayer meeting don't you miss these prayer meetings because the holy ghost is about to pour out and once you meet the same conditions that they met in the upper room the same thing is going to happen to you once you meet the same conditions god is obligated to do the same thing he did back there because he's the same yesterday he is the same today he is the same forever let the church say man amen hallelujah [Applause] so i believe this morning we're in a different season the pastor is in his place the ministers are in their place the elders are in their place the deacons are in their place the trustees are in their place the ushers are in their place the musicians are in their place the technicians are in the place the church is being set in all up what for for the dynamics for the outpouring of the holy ghost for the same signs for the same wonders for the same miracles a seventh under revival can the church say amen amen i truly believe that we are preparing for the fulfillment of the prophet's word in the message of second coming of the lord where he said when that time comes when the church finds its brotherly love when the church finds its holy decency when the church finds its place in christ it'll call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us and i believe that serves is this the time for the bride to reach that third step up is this the time for place in christ is this the time for you to take your position can the church say amen amen so are you ready for the word this morning amen you know there are different types of services you know there are services where you teach your services where you preach your services where you minister their services that are a bit of a bible study a bit of a sunday school and this morning we're going to have a little sunday school this morning you're going to go back to the bible this morning so can we stand to our feet we're going to go to one portion of scripture we're going to go to joshua 7 this morning joshua chapter 7. amen joshua chapter 7 in the book of joshua joshua chapter 7 and verse 1. but the children of israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing for acon the son of kamai the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah took of the accursed thing and the anger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel and joshua sent men from jericho to ai or i or ie some people say i'll go with ai for the service which is beside that haven on the east side of bethel and spake under them saying go up and view the country and the men went up and viewed ai and they returned to joshua and said unto him let not all the people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite ai and make not all the people the labor feather for they are but a few so they went up to the of the people about three thousand men and they fled before the men of ai and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men for they chased them from before the gate even under sherbarim and smote them in the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water and joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the lord until the evening time he and the elders of israel and put dust upon their heads and joshua said alas oh lord god wherefore has thou had all brought this people over jordan to deliver us into the hands of the amorites to destroy us what to god we had been content and dwelt on the other side of jordan oh lord what shall i say when israel turned their backs before the enemies for the canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us round and cut off our name from the earth what will thou do unto thy great name and the lord said unto joshua get thee up wherefore lie is thou thus upon thy face israel had sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them for they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff therefore the children of israel could not stand before their enemies but turn their backs before their enemies because they were accused neither will i be with you anymore except ye destroy the accursed from among you up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourself against tomorrow for thus they are the lord god of israel there is an accursed thing in the midst of the o israel thou canst not stand before their enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you shall we bow our heads for a word of prayer gracious heavenly father we thank you lord for the word lord that is so precious to us lord it is so real to us this morning lord any man can read the scriptures but it takes the holy spirit to walk out of the pages of the bible and bring it as a reality to your church this morning father god we are a needy people this morning we have not come to hear man this morning we have not just come together this morning lord but we have come to hear a word from the lord this morning that's the greatest need lord the word from the lord lord may you give us a word this morning may you take me out of the way and speak to your people this morning may you bring great deliverance among your people this morning father god may the holy ghost pour out this morning lord may backsliders be restored up this morning father may those who are living on the edge come running back to calvary this morning father may those that are sick be healed this morning father may those that are weary and tired and depressed and frustrated lord like joshua was when he rent his clothes and fell to the earth lord may they hear the words this morning of arise get up because there's much more land to be taken father may you take me out of the way and speak to your people in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says and the church says amen you may be seated this morning [Applause] we are in the bible this morning we are in the wood this morning in the message what was the holy ghost given for but abraham said the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans that sanctify the methodists that baptize the pentecostals is now present tense setting in order the coming of the lord jesus that's why we're here this morning and brother branham said the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word which means back to the bible so we're going back to the bible this morning because i've come to realize a lot of people don't know the bible they don't know even know the message but we want to dig deep this morning in the message oneness but at random say here we are in the end time coming from the east and the west and the north and the south what are we doing getting ready for that rapture getting ready listen holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the holy ghost that's what we came here this morning till every five up every fiber is filled with the holy ghost can the church say amen that's what this just what generation is all about it's about every fiber being filled with the holy ghost i want it all over me i want it all in me i want it all around me i can't live without it the good old-fashioned sin killing sky blue holy ghost revival [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated we're going to shake things up a little bit this morning because i'm tired of church how could the preacher say that yes i'm tired of church listen to the prophet in the message paradox he said and so has a church world in this last day it's come along church world has come along it's played its part but there's coming a time when it must cease it's coming a time when church politics will cease there's coming a time when coming to church for coming to church it's going to cease why there has got to come an ephesians of this journey just as other journeys there must come an ephesians [Applause] hallelujah and brother branham taught us that ephesians parallels joshua so when we read ephesians we're reading about joshua and when we read joshua we're reading ephesians so i read from joshua and i read to me eastern this morning because that's the word of god you may be seated don't worry i know i haven't given my title yet i'm just building a background in the message adoption tonight our script is divine in the book of ephesians is the book of joshua of the new testament it's dividing up and setting in order the overcome ones it's setting in order who the overcome ones so if you didn't have anything to overcome there's no setting in order for you but you are here this morning as an overcomer you overcome staying home to be in the house of god this morning some of you overcome sickness you drive yourself into the house of god you overcame something and you're going to overcome the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life you're going to overcome a false dick doctrine towards teaching for christ why there's something in you to overcome and the devil he can't take it away he can't stop it it's built here on the inside inside amen brother michael hallelujah you may be seated brother branham said in paradox joshua here is a type of the last day ministry he's not a type of the first ministry he's the type of the last day ministry so some things we could only preach a certain way in this season right now because it couldn't happen in luther's day it couldn't happen in wesley's days it couldn't happen in the pentecostal day it couldn't even happen when brother branham was here he had to wait till it turned to his voice because in the days of the voice of the seven angels when he shall begin to sound the mystery should be finished is anybody in the house this morning do we have any overcomers in the house this morning are you getting ready to possess your inheritance yes sister christina it's time to possess your healing it is your land whatever your need is you want the holy ghost you can possess it this morning you could stand up and say lord this is my portion this is my inheritance hallelujah hallelujah death services are over lukewarm services are over if you want to be lukewarm stay home you don't need to come here there are 40 message churches on this island but i'm here to make a church that will make a revival [Applause] somebody help me somebody help me come on benjamin help me i'm looking for the men of war we are the men of war this morning we are the men of war who are ready to do battle i can't hear you this morning we're the men of war who will draw their thoughts and fight up every philistine every ammo writer every amalekite hallelujah hallelujah a member of the knights that's a man of war amen brother michael that's a man of war do we have any men of war in the church this morning who are ready to possess up every inch of ground you may be seeing it don't worry i know i haven't given my title yet we'll get this in a minute you know this is a definition of insanity is when you do the same thing and expect a different result so brother branham said you got to do something for something to happen so they're going to be church services brother george like no other church servants it's not going to be the same way we did it 40 years ago 30 years ago because in joshua joshua told the people keep a couple pieces back give some room for the levites because we have not been this way before i know how we walk through the wilderness but this time is different because we're getting ready to cross over don't stay too close to me because the holy spirit oh you don't hear me this morning we are having church this morning he may be seated in joshua he had the spoken word he needed some more time to reach his family he needed some more time to reach his husband to reach a wife to reach the children to reach the one who's drinking right now and he said you know what i could win this battle but i need some more sunlight for the jerome he said sun stands still moon hangover agilent the enemy didn't know what was coming they say the battle is supposed to be over we are into overtime joshua say yes we are into overtime because i'm not a creature of time i'm a creature of eternity oh somebody helped me this morning i'm just building a background this morning you may be seated in joshua they put their feet on the neck of the kings read joshua 12 i believe this king got killed and this king god killed him and this king got killed you think god is going to leave kings devil kings alive around your life no no we are serving notice we are serving notice we are serving notice that we are coming [Applause] serve notice to the devil we are coming hallelujah you may be seated that's what happened to the people of jericho they heard a word of what joshua did they heard how on the other side of jordan they had wiped out some amorites they had heard how the jordan river opened up they had heard how the red sea opened up and they started to trim up because they said joshua is coming and i want to say this morning joshua is coming to your house he is coming to your son he is coming to your daughter he is coming to your job he is committed represents the holy ghost and he's coming he's coming let me prophesy he is here right now [Applause] [Music] you may be seated so we are promised according to revelation 10 according to malachi 4 that there must be an ephesians to this there must come an ephesians that these sevenfold mysteries of the word of god must be unfolded and ephesus here sets us like joshua positionally in adoption but ibrahim said you notice joshua after crossing over the land and taking the land he divided the land if from here manasseh here this one here god here oh how it just burns your heart every one of those hebrew mothers gave birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains where they would position where they would be positioned in the promised land and joshua not knowing this but by inspiration letter of the holy spirit after being promised the land give every man his promise exactly what the holy spirit promised through the birth back there i almost reached my title went on how that god has set some in the church through their labor [Music] he said oh they get tremendous sometimes is anybody groaning this morning when a church has grown in the persecution of the outside world believing in the lord jesus that the promise of the holy ghost is just as real to us as it was to pentecost how they groan and cry on the labor pains he said but wait a minute but when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom of god then the holy ghost has set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists then he gives in there speaking with town's interpretation and he goes on you may be seated [Applause] so i have a title this morning and it's only going to make sense halfway through the message but my title is morning how many men must die how many men die my subject coming out of the valley of echo my inspiration ephesians parallels joshua and for a bit of background for a few minutes i'm not going to keep you long this morning but in joshua 1 joshua receives the joshua commission amen joshua 1 begins now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord speak unto joshua the son of none moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and this is your first mission go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel what land was he talking about in question and answer but the branham said the promised land is to live in this land of the holy spirit that's god's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit it's another world it's another land you have to come out of the condition that you've been in to come out to live in this promised land to receive the promise hallelujah and we know that redemption is in two parts coming out of and going into it's not good enough to just come out you've got to go into something [Applause] but the pranama's message has brought a lot of people out but how many will go in when moses went down to egypt he brought everybody out [Music] but only two went in are you with me this morning listen to brother man i'm in redemption my power just a few quotes and then i'll get to my text in redemption my power by the ban i'm saying that's what god has did today he gives every one of you that wants it the baptism of the holy ghost but you've got to go in possess it that's all fight out the differences tear down the walls and get started in there and get it you say listen listen to brother adam you say the pastor said it's not for us today just walk right on past it mother said i'll run your way away from home go right on past him husband said i'll leave you go right on pass it that's it got to go and possess it that's all hallelujah is there anybody want to possess their promise this morning you may be seated but the branham said divine healings for every one of you every one of you sitting here tonight with cancer with heart trouble whatever it is god has given you the promise it's yours but you have to go and possess it listen to the prophet but you say well i don't feel too good that has nothing to do with it the promise is yours god gave it to you just go right in and slay philistines from one side to the other take out the hivites and the amorites just kill them out go and take it it's yours [Applause] hallelujah glory to god you feeling fine this morning just building a background told him he would give them the land same message redemption my power send an angel before them to take care of the way to bring them to the place where it is and this is where the problem begins right here he sends some spies over to bring back a report of how good this land is because for a long time we have heard about the land the children of israel were important for 400 years in egypt and all they talked about between the weapons of the taskmaster was this land flowing with milk and honey and with big grapes and then they come out of egypt and they walk 40 years in the wilderness because the spies went over and 10 of them came back with the same testimony same message same inspiration it's too much to take it's too much to handle while this convention was going on joshua and caleb were not in the service joshua and caleb i don't know he who came back last it was a competition for who came back last because but the branham said they had they hadn't had grapes for 40 years there were no grapes in the wilderness and but iran said they were big grapes and it took two men to bring out a bunch of these grapes caleb and joshua they were feasting on some grapes [Applause] i don't know if they ever had grapes before but when they tasted these grapes caleb's clothes was soaked in grape juice grape juice was running on his face he put grape juice on his hair i don't know but this was something that he wanted more of he didn't want just to have some grapes and and go back home and say i came and got some grapes he wanted this all the time and he wanted to stay as long as possible in the presence of the evidence of the new land is there anybody with me this morning [Applause] so here it is just one caleb come back to the convention late convention is over and instead of jubilee instead of this is here jubilee brett anthony instead of noma and ala nasi they come to see lord not even singing just crying in a camp joshua looked at caleb caleb looked at joshua did they eat the same grapes did these brothers tell them how good this holy ghost land is how good this adoption land is how good this perfection land is that the sun they've been trying to reach for all these years that they could get delivered now if we just go into the holy ghost land that that the daughter that's all messed up if she could just get in contact with this holy ghost land something not may happen but something has got to happen do they know that the testimony of jesus is still the spirit of prophecy at every place every place and because of the majority the consensus the going trend the whole children of israel end up walking for 40 years and caleb all caleb knows i'm going to keep on fighting because we're going to come back around we're going to come back around with a new people who don't know about egypt a new people who don't know about negativity and new people who don't know about the old ways and how we used to do it and what you did to me in egypt and why the test method none of that all they know is promised land all they know is promised land all they know is promised land a new generation he may be seated i'm just building a background this morning how you feeling everybody feeling fine i know it's raining outside i know it's flooded all over the country but you are here this morning under the canopy of his presence sheltered abiding on the eye under the shekinah glory we don't need to go back home you know the only one i want to go to is the one on the other side brother let them listen you know what's going on you may be seen the whole creation is grown in it's travailing i was driving up i look at the clouds and say what am i driving into look all dark and gloomy but it's something triggered on the inside that's the creation grown in they are waiting for this message this morning they are waiting for you to come forth this morning the flood is waiting for somebody to say move back somebody to move back the cloud somebody to say sun come on and shine four days we are going to have our episodes we are going to have another ephesians in this church amen you may be seated don't you see in shadow stop here a minute improving his word you know this quote there's got to be a place prepared for the world to be made manifest and we are now living by the evidence of the new land amen the son of man hallelujah hallelujah it's your promise it's your promise it's your promise this morning hallelujah but iran i'm saying turning northward possess the promise the promises unto you and to your children to them that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call christian brothers sisters we have been on this land long enough we have been around this mountain long enough he said when there's powers that's unknown when the resources is untapped haven't even touched the power yet he made me see this the purpose of the end time message was to loose the holy ghost the holy ghost was bound at the river euphrates for almost two thousand years but christ the son of man failed in a son of man the prophet lose the holy ghost lose your inheritance lose your promise in the form of the word but god didn't want the holy ghost to fall on your flesh on your ideas on your emotions and your pride and your foolishness because we'll be just under the pentecostal church so for all these years it has been disguised as the word and service after service we are supposed to echo what the prophet said waiting for the right people for the just for generation waiting for the old heads in the message who were there for a long time to not be here anymore that's why the prophet say the secret is the word is in the bride not the words in the message churches the word is in the bride and how do you know who is bride she can take the full word you know i really wonder sometimes people tell me they got the holy ghost but i'm saying many times if you got the holy ghost you'll say what the word says so if you say you have the holy ghost and you're not seeing what the word says then i know you have no holy ghost because if you have the holy ghost and you make see something wrong you quick to correct it because the holy ghost could only identify with the word can the church say man so how do you know who the bride is she can take the full word she could take correction she could take rebuke hallelujah so if he didn't find this morning so we're in joshua one just laying the background for a few more minutes verse three every place in the soul of your foot shall tread upon that i have given you as i said to moses in other words the same word that moses got now it's more positive now it's present tense and god begins to give them the drawing map he gives joshua to draw him he don't want just what to miss one inch of ground with a kangaroo so he says from the wilderness and this lebanon unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites they might be there right now but it's your land and onto the great sea towards the growing town of the sun in other words as far as the eye can see when the sun goes down all day is your land shall be your coast you may be seated i told you we haven't sunday school this morning right we're just reading the bible we're just having a good time around the scriptures hallelujah like i said to them in the midweek services i said there should be a joy that comes from reading the scripture and i know all of you spend time every day reading the scripture right in the morning and in the evening and midday you read the scriptures right so sunday should be just a refresher i said to them on wednesday they said there is a direct correlation a direct relationship between how much time you spend with the bible and how fast you find the scripture on sunday morning season people struggling 20 minutes the minister read the scripture 20 minutes ago and they're still trying to find the scripture but the more you in the word are we gonna get it listen to what god told joshua there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life not for the first 10 years not for 20 years all the days of thy life there shall not be any man be able to stand before you there shall be no problem be able to stand before you no trial no temptation no sickness no evil nothing will stand before you as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not steal thee nor forsake thee is this the scripture or not be strong enough for good courage for a reason no it's not just be strong and courageous be strong and for good courage and there's a difference between strength and courage you could have a real muscle and be real strong and real scared working out lifting iron bench pressing 300 pounds and the moment you see a squirrel you're running in that direction strength and courage are two different things you could be strong but courage is when you could face the devil in the face brother branham say and say boo right back the devil said boo and some of us with all the muscles all the world all the mechanics we have when the devil said boo we say oh sorry sorry that no not this land sorry sorry sorry i'll see you right here but courage means yeah boo you want you want a piece of this boo what you you really want to try this you know who my god is you know where i come from you know where i'm going i'm not backing down yeah i'll stand up right here to your face and take you maybe see this so be strong enough for good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them but the random said and i see shall possess together his enemy joshua was taking a promised people to a promised land by a promise of god verse 7 only be thou strong and very courageous now students of the bible would realize that whenever god repeats something there's a reason for it he says be strong enough for good courage to divide the inheritance but he brings it back now and i want you to take note of this only be thou strong and very courageous thou thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right or to the left that thou mayest prosper whethers whoever thou goes in other words this word that we have received from brother branham we can turn to the left we can turn to the right we can look around and listen god told joshua be strong and very courageous to do this thing the first strength and courage was about dividing the inheritance the second was strong and very courageous to not turn to the left when people tell you go this way turn to the right when they say try this way but stay focused on the word that i gave through my prophet moses listen to what brother branham said in harvest time he said don't never never anytime leave that scripture for anything not one word of it stay exactly with that scripture do we have any bible believers here this morning [Applause] listen to this verse eight how we doing this morning we came to spend a while right let the flood water subside we're gonna be here we're breaking it to eternity this morning [Applause] verse 8 this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth what a testimony it's always in your mouth you're always talking about god you're always meditating on the word you don't have time for politics you don't have time for gossip you don't have time to backbite you don't have time to talk about people this book of the law shall not depart out of thy amount but listen but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe he is repeating it to do according to all that is written therein in other words even doing that the first time let me see it again what god is doing is laying down some conditions in the joshua commission for what is to happen in the 24 chapters of the book of joshua [Music] to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shall make that way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success verse nine have not i commanded thee be strong enough for good courage for the third time be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee with us whoever thou goes but abraham said in god's power to transform the true predestinated believers will stay with the word because they are part of that word listen to brother branham and satan's eden in august of 1965 that's a few months before he left he said i don't care what it is see if it's against god's word be against it that's your enemy anything that's against the word is your enemy everything that's for the word is your brother he's a part of you that's the prophet you love the lord this morning how many men must die we're going to touch it in a few minutes so that was joshua 1. in joshua 2 he sends out the spies aspire jericho in joshua 3 the chairman cross jordan and god tells josh what to leave some stones as a memorial for what god did for you that day that's in joshua four in just four five joshua orders the second circumcision and we are introduced to the captain of the host who gives joshua instruction on how to take jericho joshua was inclined to wait on god and when he waited on god to hear a word from the lord he looked up and there was somebody standing there with and who are you for us against us and it was the captain of the house and he gave him the strategy to take the land to take jericho the first city that they were to conquer coming out of jordan they had to deal with jericho or they couldn't go anywhere jericho was the first point of contact and i'm getting close to my text now god told them for six days i want you to just walk around jericho it's going to look as if nothing is happening it's going to look as if you're just going to church and going back home let them talk about you let them laugh on the walls and say is this the great army of israel that defeated the amorites and walked through the jordan and walked through the red sea and it's going to look as if nothing is happening but be quiet just walk around jericho just walk around your problem just just take a good look at your promise walk around it and and tell yourself quietly in your heart it's coming down it's coming down it's coming down don't don't make any noise about it just look in your heart and say this situation is coming down it's up the walls are going to come down they can't stay up forever just walk around there in your heart you just know that you know that you know it might look as if nothing is going on for six days for the kangaroo [Applause] but on the seventh day you're going to walk around seven times and i can imagine whether michael as they walked around that first time by now the guys on the wall had put away their weapons and they were playing monopoly and playing uno and planes gravel because it's like these people just came to work out this is like the savannah just walk around in savannah some people walk around savannah on a monday on a wednesday maybe they're just working hard this week but then all of a sudden there was a second time they went around and the men are going to take note well today seems to be you know the hard day when they woke up and there's a hard day do you push extra you see maybe this is that day and they walk strong a third time and a fourth time and a fifth time in the sixth time and on the seventh time after the seventh time decided to do something different go to joshua when you tell the people to shout let them begin to shout when i built a shout shout and see the wall just come down and brother they started to shout and they blew the trumpet and the men in jericho didn't even know what to expect because this was not the kind of warfare they were expecting they expected a different kind of warfare but god gave them a strategy to take the land because god is a god of strategy can the church say amen [Music] so all of that i said to reach this point of the message to come to my text in joshua six as they are plundering jericho god gives joshua an instruction because when god calls the people brother madam said he calls for a total separation from all the things of the world but random calls it an annihilation from the worldly things he said separate yourself and god will bless you come out from among them be not partakers of their sins york yourself not up among unbelievers but york yourself with believers fellow citizens of the kingdom so god told joshua joshua jericho is a cursed city keep yourselves from the accursed things i've given you the victory but whatever you do don't mess with the accursed things he told us to bring all the silver the gold the vessels of brass and iron into the treasury of the lord but burn everything else in jericho because jericho is cursed i don't want you to be like them i don't want you dressed like them i don't want you to do what they do except for rahab and her family and what she has burn everything else don't try to see what you could use don't try to see what you can salvage don't try to see what you could take back to your house burn it don't listen to their dvds and their movies to see what's on it to see how you could use it burn it burn everything kill everything destroy everything amen and joshua and his men they go to the city and they burn and they destroy and they kill and they do what god says and joshua six ends with so the lord was with joshua and his fame was noise throughout the city but now i can really strike my text jericho is in ruins the smoke is still rising as the ashes blow over the surrounding land the children of israel get ready for the next move the next destination is really bethel because bethel was a sacred place to israel in bethel there abraham built his altar bethel is where jacob saw his ladder bethel was of strategic importance to the children of israel because bethel was plum straight heading into the promised land brethren was a holy and sacred place but to get to bethel you have to pass through ai ai was a city that covered the road on the way to bethel so the bible said that joshua sent out some men to look at ai and these men came back with a very intellectual message we have analyzed it we have looked it over we have done the research after we have the evidence of taking jericho which had a wall this city has no wall jericho was a big city this is a smaller city i think we could just take maybe two thousand or three thousand men and take ai joshua says all right let's do it now bear in mind the bible says that 40 000 men of war crossed jordan with joshua three thousand men went up to ai to take ai they were confident they knew joshua won they knew every place the soul of the foot tread upon was theirs and they went to vanquish the next destination and the bible says before they reached the kid the amorites started to beat them and the amorites chased them down into our valley when they should have had the victory they had to turn their backs on the enemy and they ran away to retreat to the valley of depression retreat to the valley of contemplation retreat to the valley of wondering what went wrong retreat to the valley of confusion retreat to the valley of self-pity what happened to me and why did this happen and how did this happen not only were they chased out not only did they lose the battle but when they had a scripture such as no man shall stand before you the bible said 36 men died on that day 36 funerals were attended that should not been attended 36 eulogies were read by the terrence that should not have been read 36 reits were laid down at graves at men who should have been alive because something had gone wrong after you read joshua 1 to 6 this defeat was not supposed to happen just what did not expect it joshua did not understand it instead of gaining ground the bible said the people's hearts melted they were afraid to worship they were afraid to cry out free to claim what is their own they're covered in a valley don't know what to do joshua could not go on because something had to change joshua got desperate just what tore his clothes rent his clothes laid his head down at the ground and he began to cry and he along with the elders covered dust on their faces and they cried the bible said until evening time and i asked the question this morning how many men must die before we really get desperate amen how many men must die before we truly call on god how many men must die before we realize we need to hear from the lord because joshua this time had not heard from the lord how many men must die before we realize that this is not a game and this is not playing church how many men must die before we realize that satan is not taking prisoners he is out to kill you how many men must die before we call for real real premier how many men must die before realize that without the token we are finished how many men must die before we realize that it's a life it's a thunder that shakes the devil i asked you this morning how many more men must die before realizes not by might not by power but by the spirit of the lord how many more young people must backslide how many of our young women must get pregnant out of marriage how many of our young men must be drunk in clubs how many men must die before the church gets back on track how many marriages must suffer how many men must die before realize that god will only keep his word how many men must die before we realize that there's a price for disobeying god's word 36 men good men mighty men men who weren't even part of the problem died on that day we are in joshua and this message is a cautionary tale to all of us because had they stayed with the world those men would have been alive with their wives with their children with their families [Music] i challenge you church how many men thank you lord first die praise god before we realize that coming the church is not good enough how many men must die before i realize that a house divided against itself cannot stand how many men must die before realize that brethren cannot persecute prejudice how many men must die for real life without love we're not going anywhere how many men must die before we clean the sin out of our lives how many men must die before we clean the sin out of the church how many men must die before we can make a church that would make a revival how many men must die before husbands can love their wives and wives could reference their husband and children can obey their parents how many men must die before we put on the whole armor of god haven't we lost enough haven't we pained enough haven't we cried enough haven't there been enough of a sacrifice for moving away from god's word how many men must die for us to come back to god and say god i am sorry i didn't know what i was doing i didn't realize i went off somewhere how many men must die before we see real repentance and joshua lay down his head and cried until evening time he and all the elders because they could not go on they could not go on they couldn't just go to church as if it was normal they couldn't just open their bible as if it was normal because god said i was with you and it looked as if god was knocked out those men who went to a.i they did not hear from god they were overconfident they didn't realize that they didn't even win the battle in jericho it was the captain of the host who had led them to victory it was not their strength it was not their ideas it was not how much quotes they knew how much scripture they understood it was only the grace of god that the captain of the host had come down to tell him what to do and their idea was let us have a convention take three thousand men and we're going to do it amen they did not hear from god but not only that there was sin in the camp sin in the camp as they found themselves in the valley the valley that is named the valley of eco and that's why i got my inspiration coming out of the valley of echo because there's no coming out until you clean the sin out there's no coming out until you get back to the word there's no coming out until you hear from god there's no coming out until there's real confession there's no coming out until there's real repentance there's no coming out unless husband make things white with their eye wives and wives make things right where their husbands and children repent to their parents there is no coming back unless brother repents to brother there's no coming back unless we are in order and i looked through the church this morning and there are many people in their own valley of echo after great victory at jericho after great victory on a mountaintop after hearing the gospel after salvation after being baptized after coming to this message you find yourself in your own trouble that would that word echo means troubling so it's a valley of trouble a valley of troubling a valley of depression that value a value where you wonder where you are and i believe that this morning we have been in the valley long enough friends the valley is not forever the valley is just for a season we don't belong down in the valley the valleys are not inheritance there's more land to be taken and many people found themselves stuck in the valley of eco but i want to refocus what that value represents this morning are you with me this morning i know there's not one of those jump for joy preach happy services but i told the brothers i had that gift of preaching people happy i don't have that one i believe in getting right with god that's the only real message friends get right with god amen the valley is our opportunity to regroup to retrain to refocus to get ready let the devil laugh while we're in the valley but satan we're coming out the valley friends coming out this valley will not be by accident there's a way out of the valley god told joshua joshua you have cried long enough you have wept long enough that's enough of that get up let's fix the problem get up from your condition stop crying lift your head up lift your chest up square your shoulders back look up i didn't call you to cry according to possess the land that land that the amorites have that you got defeated at you you got to go back there because this is not your promise there's a lot more land to be taken so let's get focused on getting the bride in position let's get focused on getting a super church a super race as we near the headstone is there anybody with me this morning enough minimum time [Music] god told joshua the people have mixed the acoustic with their own stuff with their own stuff makes the world with our own stuff friends god is not going to do anything for you if you're mixing the world with your own stuff we've got us had a burn that occurs stuff this morning burn it out this morning the same god who told joshua i took you out of egypt i took you to the red sea i took you to jordan i'll go with you i'll never leave you he said i'm not with you until you take away the accursed thing some of us need to clean our closets out clean our cell phones out clean our inboxes out clean our libraries out clean our cars out clean our houses out clean our list of friends out because we are mixing the accursed thing with our stuff but the branham and adoption he said why did they die innocent men because one man stepped out of line listen to listen to brother branham you see the reason this needs to be taught the church lining up lining up with the word of god lining up with god and lining up with each other walking perfectly upright soberly before all men fearing god that's from the prophet listen to the prophet in presuming acon why when he took that little wedge and that babylonian garment he taught it will never be seen he said well what's that just a little garment i'll stick it under here and probably my family will enjoy it if we ever get into a tight place i got a little wedge of gold nobody will see it just wrap the thing together and put it under my coat and go on he presumed that it was all right but god's commandment was take nothing out of that clear city don't have nothing around you that's cursed friends this message is not about your life when you're in church shaking people's hands it's that hidden life when nobody's around because akon couldn't tear the garment and walk with it through the child no no because he knew that that's why he had to hide it because he couldn't wear it openly so it's a challenge to all of us friends listen to what god did in getting this cleaned out could you take some more [Applause] joshua 7 14 in the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes and it shall be that the tribe is the lord take each other and come according to the families and the family which the lord shall take shall come by household and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man there is no hiding in church anymore there's no hiding in the message anymore man by man and it shall be listen that he that is taken with your cursed thing shall be burned with fire is that what happened to ananias and sapphira dead on the spot is that the kind of church we're coming back to yes you stray from the word death you lie to the holy ghost death serious hour friends he that is taken with the accursed things shall be burned with fire he and all that he have because he had transgressed the covenant of the lord and because he had wrought folly in israel so joshua rose up early in the morning and brought israel by their tribes and the tribe of judah was taken and he brought the family of judah and he took the family of the zaha heights and he brought the family of the zeitgeist man by man and zapdi was taken and he brought his household man by man and a khan the son of kamai the son of zabday the son of zerah of the tribe of judah was taken and joshua said unto achan my son give i pray thee glory to the god of israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what thou has done hide it not from me now when i read up to this point i i began to pray and think about i said listen akon wasn't stupid he knew what he took he knew what he did he had an opportunity to willingly come and say stop the search stop the search stop the search i am the man he knew what was going on he knew what he hid he could have stopped it but he really wasn't repentant and we see in scripture it was in his heart and it can answer just once said indeed i have sinned it's almost like when you're calling him you're ready to call on him focus now is he okay here yeah it was me it was me it was me use me friends before it reached that point where the holy ghost calls out because it's prophesied the holy spirit will call sin out in the church before the holy spirit calls it out you better run to the pastor run to the ministers run to the elders and you get prayer for your condition because the holy ghost will judge you from this day on out by the word you living loose you live in foolish you not doing what you're supposed to do in the world the holy ghost is going to judge you from this day on you are walking on dangerous ground and he can answer joshua and said indeed i have sinned against the law god of israel and thus and thus have i done and this part bothered me even more listen to what happened when i saw among the spoils listen carefully a goodly babylonish garment and i want to stop right there imagine you under the gun for the george you under the pressure all 12 tribes of israel all of the elders all of the people when we are supposed to be fighting we have called a halt you standing in front of joshua and the elders and you will still describe the garment as goodly he picked up a comment in jericho or babylonish the bible says a garment from babylon that god said because of your covenant i don't want you to wear their clothes i don't want you to look like them talk like them walk like them live like them and in his heart he say it's a goodly garment i like it it looks nice it was good to him isn't it funny the stuff that we think is good that god said is cursed friends it's time we check up what we value as good that god said don't touch and some people might think they're above this message this is a simple message but you see when judgment strikes you're going to come back to this service and say oh you mean that book i was reading and that close i was reading because but the brandon said anything of the word how small it is you're going to get judged by it that's why he said full obedience to the world is what will entitle you to the token is anybody with me this morning he said when i saw among the spoils of goodly babylon his government in the world looking good these tires in the water looking good the fashion of the world looking good and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels weight then i coveted them and i took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it money that was supposed to be in the temple because god told them take it to the treasury of the lord you people who don't want to pay tights that's that's you right there you keeping the money for a rainy day god will judge you by it yes that's the world we're back to the bible what's supposed to be god's supposed to be god that money was supposed to be in the temple not under his bed not hiding somewhere in his house he hit the garment and the money for a rainy day a year well the rainy day has come judgment day has come and joshua sent messengers and iran unto the tent and behold it was hidden his tent and the silver under it and listen and they took him out of the midst of the ten and brought them unto joshua and unto all the children of israel and laid them out before the lord and joshua and all israel with him took econ all of israel was watching this happen took aikon the son of sarah and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold because now it is all kirst and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and they brought them into the valley of echo and joshua said why hast thou troubled us the lord shall trouble thee this day and all israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day so the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of echo unto this day i hope this message stirs your heart i know it's going to kind of jump for joy message but friends this is real this is reality it's back to the bible it's back to the word it's back to the principles laid down on the day of pentecost listen to what brother bannon said in the message presuming acon thought this little old wedge it won't make any difference listen to brother random the rest of the ladies are cutting their hair i'll do the same it won't make any difference but what did they do it never brought pleasure to his family it brought depth to every one of them and listen to brother adam and when we compromise on any commandment of god to please the people we kill the thing right there one little wedge one babylonian garment stop the marching army brother one thing that we permit the church to do that's wrong one thing that we won't call out against to make the people straighten it up it will stop the march of the church what are we doing we are still setting the church in order listen to brother brother they presume you're going on we may be in name we may be in numbers but that ain't what counts it isn't what counts is god with us god in us god moving through us his word alive in us listen carefully friends but the brandon when he would do the prayer line many times he would tell the people if you have unconfessed sin don't pass through this line because you can leave worse he said even if god heals you it's on you because you got unconfessed in your life many times you say if you have unconfessing step out of the prayer line go make it right and then come back in listen to what brother branham said in south africa testimony he said as long as you got on confessing something that you ought to have done or ought not to have done you could anoint with oil do anything you wish he talk about the devil will not leave he has a legal right to hold there so friends this service is a service for you to bring all that you have and burn it [Music] don't you leave the service the same way you come before the holy spirit calls it right out you burn it today you hit the altar today you say lord i'm not leaving with this anymore i'm not doing it anymore can the church say man everybody feeling fine everybody's shaking here this morning i'm almost finished your musicians can come up josh was seven should not have happened those men were not supposed to die a heavy price was paid for what akan did not only did the 36 good men die but he lost his children he lost his family he lost everything he had including his own life because he disobeyed god friends all god wants his obedience to his word and that's why he says full obedience to the world will entitle you to the token i can't worry about who doesn't want to believe who was one to obey but i have to see lord as for me and my house i want to live the way you want me to live i want to clean my life up because it's the grace of god friends but you have to do what you're supposed to do because joshua eight is coming and in joshua eight god twelves joshua get up you gotta overcome i want you to go back to ai because now that you clean up the camp it's time for you to have the victory [Applause] can the church say amen now that you get the house back in order it's time for you to have the victory now that the sin was out the camp now just what he needs to hear from god this time he can't go in his own strength anymore and what i love about this is the first time they went with three thousand men but this time god tells them i want you to take all the men of war don't leave any men cutting potatoes don't leave any men in the kitchen take all the men of war take all 40 000 men and take them to fight do we have any men of war who are ready to fight now not only because you see it you see the remarkable difference between hearing from man and here from god man says let's take two thousand men and they were whooped god says here's what take all the men of war and just as in jericho god said i'm going to give you a strategy i want you to put 30 000 men over the nights send them overnight 30 000 men and put them on one side of ai don't let anybody know they're there i want you to put another 5 000 men on the other side and i want you to ride out to face ai and when you go this time with a george they're gonna come out to fight you thinking it was like the first time and he says they're gonna chase you and i want you to turn your back and i want you to run away from them because i wanted to look as if you're still defeated i want you to look as if you're washed up i want you to look as if you can't have a revival i want you to look as if you still don't have the holy ghost i want you to look as if you're not adopted i want you to look as if you never had the victory and when you run away from them and they come out raise your spear and let all the men of israel charge the bible says the men of the amorites when they look to the left they were israelites when they looked to the right they were israelites when they looked in front of them they were israelites when they looked at the back there were israelites he said burn that city he said i will do to ai what i did to jericho burn everything you maybe see them not only that the bible said the men from bethel the next city they came to help the amorites the bible said all of them died too because this time they heard from god brother sister i pray you hear from god this morning and you get your house in order you get your life and all up and watch your holy ghost sweep into this place can the church say man oh hallelujah sir this is the time for i will ride this trail one more time hallelujah that defeated position that you've been in that weaken position that's just temporary you're going to have the victory there's a prophecy over you god's prophecy still applies but when you are in order when you're in your position not the devil could move not a demon can move you may be seated as they get ready to close out the ephesians church had word and spirit together the ephesian church had mechanics and dynamics the ephesians church heard from the lord just like jericho there was no stronghold that would stand before them can the church say amen but something went wrong the church fell away from the word because only the world could conduct the spirit four enemy agents the power worm the caterpillar that can't go on the locust had come and eat down the tree they had lost their right their entitlement to the token because only for obedience to the world will entitle you to the token and from a state of great victory from the day of pentecost they found themselves in their valley of echo but daniel 12 says and at that time shall michael stand up in that time of trouble in that valley of trouble at that time shall michael stand up that great prince which standing for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be written in the book so is this a time for great deliverance since it's just a time for a great victory oh hallelujah you maybe see there the great church hallelujah had stopped hearing from god there was sin in the camp and what a sin unbelief anything moving away from the word of god but in the valley god began to set his church in order try by tribe age by age family by finally house by his house in the very world by individual what was it i will restore saith the lord we will ride this trail one more time the tree of life will grow again the alpha church and the omega church will be the same power the same signs the same wonders the same miracles can the transcendent hallelujah [Applause] i feel like samson this morning after a while samson said the devil had no right to take on my eyes yes i may have been defeated yes i may have made mistakes but the devil had no right to take on my eyes and the devil had no right to kill those 36 men yes things might have been shaken but satan don't forget for a minute that we are still the people of god we have lost enough men but we are still the army of the lord you made a mistake when you kill those men you made a mistake when you attacked my family you made a mistake when you attacked the church of the living god somebody say man hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what are you looking for but isaac i'm looking for all the men of war to begin to take their place to get into their position because when you're in your position there's nothing could move you perfect fate is based on your position i'm looking for men of god who would take up their rightful place in the kingdom of god can the church help me this morning do we have men of war who are ready to take back their children take back take back take back oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated the prophet introduced messiah he restored back to fate he revealed every mystery and left us with a promise of dynamics but you have got to take the lana it's a good land we have the evidence of the land we have been living by the evidence of the land the son of man from adoption is that right god trying to place his church in position what has all been god trying to place his church in position to manifest himself that's what he wanted place his church in position that he can manifest himself tears my spirit flowing freely is that what we're looking for this morning then let the church see amen hallelujah and hear him that's the thing that god will do to his sons here on earth someday he will call you aside if you will one obey him two stay with the word three believe it and he will place into the church before the coming of jesus christ he will place into the church all the powers that christ had will be in the church can the church say man do you feel that way this morning there'll be a power put into the church that is now coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen powers like this coming yet but the time is now brother we're getting ready to kill some amorites you wait till your adopted sons get into action then you see the philistines go to backing up those personal keyboards that you've been fighting you waited the holy spirit takes complete control of you you watch the devil begin to move out oh hallelujah hallelujah you love the lord this morning are you ready to come on the valley is there anybody ready to come on the valley and go back to battle we have been in the valley long enough let's get ready to go to war let's get ready to
