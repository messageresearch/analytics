[14:49] well may you visit them in a special way
[14:52] in Jesus name I ask it amen I have one
[14:55] scripture to read tonight Matthew
[14:56] chapter 11 reading for from 28 to 30
[15:01] Jesus
[15:02] speaks come unto me all ye that labor
[15:05] and a heavy laden and I will give you
[15:09] rest take my yoke upon you and learn of
[15:13] me for I am
[15:15] meek and lowly in heart and he shall
[15:19] find rest unto your
[15:21] souls for my yoke is easy and my burden
[15:25] is light maybe tonight it might be
[15:28] burden out
[15:30] burden with family issues stress
[15:33] something troubling you and you're
[15:36] heavy but Jesus said take my y upon you
[15:41] there are two kind of burdens burdens of
[15:44] God and the burden of the
[15:47] devil the burden of the devil is is a
[15:50] hard
[15:51] one because go the end after serving him
[15:55] his whims and fancies and will dead the
[15:58] devil the wages of sin is still dead but
[16:03] the Yoke of Jesus you still find
[16:05] yourself with eternal life other title
[16:08] of this exhortation I want to give you
[16:09] tonight is the burden of the word that
[16:12] leads to prayer that's what I want to
[16:14] share with you tonight the burden of the
[16:16] word that leads to prayer okay let's go
[16:20] there a question somebody asked brother
[16:23] brandom it seems among the Ministers of
[16:26] the word that we have little or no
[16:29] burden to pray to preach to fast or for
[16:34] lost souls that might still be out there
[16:38] somewhere in the world would you please
[16:40] tell us what to do about this condition
[16:44] thank you very much brother Brandon for
[16:47] this and he
[16:49] answers that must be a minister he
[16:52] didn't sign any name for these word
[16:55] brother I I had to answer them when I
[16:58] was tired and worn out and kind of you
[17:00] know don't feel too good so I trust that
[17:03] it answer the question I thank you very
[17:06] much and I forgot what I was going to
[17:09] answer him then he continues preachers a
[17:14] minister why we have these burdens don't
[17:18] have a burden for lost souls I believe
[17:20] it's a lacking of the
[17:22] Revival I believe we should still try to
[17:26] pray to God to give us passions for lost
[17:30] souls until Jesus comes so even though
[17:34] it might be dry and hard which it still
[17:37] continue to pray pray God for Revival
[17:40] pray God to give a passion for lost
[17:42] souls pray God to go beyond you let's
[17:45] continue Revelation 2:9 I Know Thy works
[17:48] and thy tribulations and poverty but
[17:51] Thou Art rich I know the blasphemy of
[17:55] them which say they are Jews and are not
[17:57] but are
[17:59] the synagogue of
[18:00] SATA now the Lord God Almighty says I
[18:04] know there is walking in the midst of
[18:08] his
[18:09] people there he is the chief Shepherd of
[18:12] the flock but does he hold back the
[18:15] persecution does he stem the tribulation
[18:18] no he does not he simply says I know
[18:23] your tribulation I am not at all
[18:26] unmindful of your
[18:28] suffering what a stumbling block this is
[18:32] to so many people like
[18:35] Israel they wonder if God really loves
[18:38] them and how can God be just and loving
[18:43] if he stands by and watch his people
[18:45] suffer so I was amazed tonight how
[18:48] brother Anthony sing that song uh yes
[18:51] Jesus loves me the Bible tells me so
[18:53] because I knew what I had
[18:55] here I'm speaking
[18:57] about speaking about um love I went to
[19:01] the bank today have some transaction to
[19:03] pay on my credit card and some kind of
[19:04] things like that and I had to get some
[19:07] money from elsewhere and put it together
[19:09] and I got mixed up somehow and I didn't
[19:12] realize I got mixed up and
[19:14] I I do what I normally do to pay on the
[19:17] credit card and stuff and the g was take
[19:20] staying quite long and I didn't know why
[19:23] and I started to get irritated and I'm
[19:26] twisting and turning and like that
[19:27] something we have the right
[19:29] attitude and I
[19:32] adjust and take take it easy and so like
[19:35] that and after a while I recognized I
[19:39] give them the wrong amount so they had
[19:41] more money than they could account for
[19:44] and it was an amazing experience to me
[19:47] because here it is I've never seen that
[19:49] girl before maybe she's a new person so
[19:51] I tell myself she is new she we don't
[19:53] know what she's doing and all kind of
[19:55] thoughts hit in my mind but I realiz it
[19:59] doesn't matter what the circumstances
[20:01] and what the challenges is it's p right
[20:04] attitude at the end of it all I was
[20:07] wrong not the girl it cost it it was it
[20:10] take up 25 minutes when it was supposed
[20:12] to take about five six minutes and it's
[20:15] after a while when I get settled now I
[20:17] say wait a minute what I give you is not
[20:20] what I thought I give you and we work at
[20:22] all out but I I just shared it with you
[20:25] so sometimes in going forward when you
[20:27] think might be somebody else it might
[20:30] just be you so I thank God for that
[20:32] lesson tonight of being patient and
[20:35] being understanding and just waiting and
[20:37] just watching even though so even if she
[20:40] was new and fumbling just like a new
[20:42] driver on the road I was still supposed
[20:45] to have a level of patience and
[20:46] understanding and it so happened that I
[20:48] was at fault that was very interesting
[20:50] experience so I'll share with you
[20:51] tonight so let's continue the burden
[20:54] this and this is a scripture now from
[20:55] Malachi chapter 1 the burden of the word
[20:58] of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have
[21:01] loved you sayth the Lord yet be saved
[21:04] wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau
[21:06] Jacob's brother and the Lord said yet I
[21:09] love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his
[21:13] mountain and Heritage waste for the
[21:14] dragons of the Wilderness here we go
[21:17] tonight this is for us here
[21:19] tonight you see they could not figure
[21:23] out God's
[21:25] love they thought that love meant no
[21:30] suffering Believers especially you here
[21:33] tonight who feel that you entitled I
[21:35] don't know what you think you might be
[21:36] entitled to or anybody that will hear
[21:38] this thing think you might be entitled
[21:40] to this entitled to that entitled to
[21:42] that but let's hear closer what the Lord
[21:46] is saying here they thought that love
[21:50] meant no suffering they thought that
[21:53] love meant a baby with parental care but
[21:58] God said that his love was elective love
[22:03] the proof of his love is election and no
[22:07] matter what happened his love was proven
[22:10] truly by the fact they were chosen on
[22:13] the Salvation because God had chosen you
[22:17] to Salvation through sanctification of
[22:21] the spirit and belief of the truth he
[22:25] may commit you to death as it did Paul
[22:29] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[22:32] job that is his prerogative how many
[22:36] could say Amen tonight and you see when
[22:38] you could say Amen to this that's been
[22:40] presented it means you are getting
[22:43] mature because you see the younger and
[22:46] the baby and whatnot and the child
[22:48] wouldn't be able to grasp this just here
[22:51] so because you're growing you could
[22:53] actually acquire a higher knowledge to
[22:56] understand your placement and your issue
[22:59] that you wouldn't backslide in spirit or
[23:00] in mind because it's not working
[23:03] according to your thoughts and thinking
[23:05] so what he may commit you to death as he
[23:08] did Paul he may commit you to suffering
[23:10] as he did job that is his prerogative he
[23:13] is
[23:14] Sovereign but it all with a purpose if
[23:18] he did not have a purpose then here we
[23:21] go he would be the author of frustration
[23:24] and not
[23:25] peace his purpose
[23:29] is that after we have suffered a while
[23:32] we would be made perfect so when people
[23:35] complaining and blaming and pointing
[23:38] finger and all kind of thing like that
[23:41] they don't want to sit back relax and
[23:44] ask God what is your mind in this
[23:47] situation I want to catch your mind I
[23:50] don't want to get caught up in my flesh
[23:52] because the flesh is not Guided by the
[23:55] spirit okay is as many as a led by the
[23:58] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[24:01] if you yield to your senses and your
[24:03] flesh and your own desires you wouldn't
[24:05] get very far because you're a
[24:08] human okay but you're looking to be
[24:11] Quicken from above so let's go if he
[24:15] didn't have a purpose then he would be
[24:17] the auor of frustration and not peace
[24:20] his purpose is that after we have
[24:22] suffered a while we would be made
[24:24] perfect be established strengthened and
[24:27] settled as job says he put strength in
[24:30] US you see he himself suffered from
[24:32] Christ he learned
[24:35] obedience by the things that he suffered
[24:39] he actually made perfect by the things
[24:43] that he suffered and we have Hebrews 58
[24:46] to9 quoted here though he was a
[24:51] son yet learn obedience by the things
[24:55] which he suffered what about that
[24:56] long-standing church M who fig that it's
[24:59] supposed to work up because they there a
[25:00] long time the Bible says though he was a
[25:03] son in other words son doesn't give him
[25:06] the right to be excused son doesn't give
[25:09] him the right to be entitled The Bible
[25:12] specifically detailed though he were a
[25:15] son yet learned he obedience by the
[25:18] things which he suffered and being made
[25:20] perfect he became the auter of Eternal
[25:24] salvation unto all them that obey him in
[25:28] plain language here we go the very
[25:31] character of Jesus was perfected by
[25:34] suffering and according to Paul he has
[25:38] left his church his church upon his TR I
[25:41] my church he left his church a measure
[25:44] of suffering that they too by their
[25:47] faith in God while suffering for him
[25:52] would come to a place of
[25:55] perfection why did he want this pause a
[25:58] bit so in other words you could have a
[26:00] fivestory house you could have 10 cars
[26:04] 10 ships 10 planes 10 Rockets you could
[26:07] be a multi-billionaire it doesn't
[26:11] exclude you from this word
[26:15] here
[26:17] watch so Paul said he has left his
[26:20] church a measure of suffering a measure
[26:22] of suffering that they too by their
[26:25] faith in God one
[26:28] suffering for him would come to a place
[26:32] of perfection why did he want this and
[26:34] the answer that is James 1 2- 4 my
[26:37] brethren con your joy when you fall into
[26:40] diverse Temptations knowing this that
[26:42] the try of your faith work at patience
[26:46] and let patience have a perfect work
[26:48] that you may be perfect and entire
[26:52] wanting nothing and we find out he said
[26:55] patience Perfection waiting on God and
[26:56] waiting for God let's continue quickly
[26:59] why does he stand
[27:01] by the reason is in Romans 8:1 1718 if
[27:06] children and we stru that last night on
[27:08] Wednesday night then ears ears of God
[27:12] joint ears with Christ if so be that we
[27:15] suffer with him that we may be glorified
[27:17] together for I reckon that the
[27:20] sufferings of this present time are not
[27:22] worthy to be compared with the glory
[27:25] that shall be reveal in us on unless we
[27:28] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[27:30] you have to suffer to reain the reason
[27:32] for this is that character simply is
[27:36] never made without suffering character
[27:39] is a victory not a gift a man without
[27:41] character can't Reign because power
[27:44] apart from character is satanic but
[27:47] Power with character is fit to rule and
[27:49] since he wants us to share even his
[27:52] throne on the same basis that he
[27:55] overcame and he set down in his father's
[27:58] Throne then we have to overcome to sit
[28:01] with him how could we overcome if
[28:05] there's no test given and the little
[28:08] here we go temporary sufferings we go
[28:11] through now is not worthy to be compared
[28:14] to the tremendous Glory that will be
[28:17] revealed in us when he comes what a
[28:20] treasure lad up for those who are
[28:23] willing to enter into his kingdom too
[28:25] much tribulation
[28:28] okay
[28:30] now in trying to do God service without
[28:33] being is God's will he's talking about
[28:36] David got caught up in the anointing the
[28:39] anointing was all right but in doing it
[28:42] he got in Ted and stepped over the
[28:43] boundary line what did he do instead of
[28:46] putting the Arc in it original position
[28:49] he carried it on a new cart and not over
[28:52] the hearts of the Levites it was
[28:54] supposed to be carried on the shoulder
[28:57] of of Levites which is over the heart
[29:00] the word is not in the mind it's in the
[29:03] heart not in a new cat and the new C
[29:06] represented every denomination there
[29:08] will ever be God word must be obeyed God
[29:11] words must be carried not carried by
[29:13] state persp or Bishops here we go it is
[29:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[29:18] heart of man and not some ecclesiastical
[29:22] move the holy spirit is a treasure of
[29:25] God's love in the heart of man and woman
[29:27] Obe now what we are saying the anointing
[29:31] not supposed to shake you off the word
[29:33] you have to Zone into the word and leave
[29:36] everything out the anointing the true
[29:39] anointing has to make will make you
[29:41] focus on the word not on your own
[29:43] thoughts and feelings and emotions and
[29:45] your ideas and your dreams now hear this
[29:48] part they were supposed to put it on
[29:50] their left shoulder pack the ark and
[29:53] because it was up over their heart they
[29:54] had the burden of the word
[29:58] on their heart so when you get caught up
[30:02] in the word you get the burden of the
[30:04] word or the burden of what is promised
[30:07] and we can see tonight why some people
[30:09] doesn't have any burden how some people
[30:10] get a burden and they operate from that
[30:12] burden and they feel a fulfillment of
[30:14] their lies in praying and seeking God
[30:17] because upon them there's a burden so
[30:19] hear what he's saying here now this is
[30:20] so
[30:22] big he
[30:25] says people have different bird
[30:28] burden of their own denomination and
[30:30] like that he said the burden of how many
[30:32] more you're going to get in your
[30:33] denomination instead of here we go the
[30:36] burden of the word of the Lord till
[30:39] people will see only the word and
[30:41] nothing else if you're seeing brother ID
[30:44] you're Missy Bo if you're seeing the
[30:47] church you're Missy Bo you have to see
[30:49] the word and you have to see the word
[30:53] given to us in time and even though God
[30:56] is in eternity his word must be obeyed
[31:00] in time just as Jesus prayed thy will be
[31:02] done in earth as it is in heaven God
[31:06] cannot change anything of his word his
[31:09] word is original his word is perfect and
[31:13] his word must be obeyed so instead of
[31:15] the burden of the word of God till the
[31:17] people will see only the word of God and
[31:20] nothing else no new C all right so this
[31:23] is the stretch now we're going to hit
[31:25] and this is something something so
[31:26] beautiful
[31:27] and I want to get it from the teaching
[31:29] on Moses but R was teaching I think it
[31:32] was a Sunday school class young children
[31:34] but it have something very very
[31:36] important that we want to look at in
[31:38] prayer and he's talking about amam Joi
[31:42] dead and he said oh gosh you're putting
[31:45] all woman to work is getting worse and
[31:47] worse and that night he said I'm going
[31:49] up and pray like I never prayed before
[31:51] I'm and B I'm saying that's the way to
[31:53] pray pray like you never prayed before
[31:57] really get to business all right don't
[31:59] go and say Lord bless so and so and and
[32:02] don't take interest no when you little
[32:04] boys pray get down to business and he
[32:07] said do you do that in school God to
[32:08] help you in your school and your grades
[32:10] and so on do you pray and he ask that
[32:11] but here one again so amam he goes
[32:14] upstairs he didn't want no
[32:17] supper she said you must eat that she
[32:19] said I can't do it you see dead I can't
[32:22] do it she said you're losing weight
[32:24] you're nervous you're pale in your face
[32:26] you vomit up your food and things he
[32:28] said I know what to do he said dear if
[32:31] somebody don't take the people to heart
[32:33] if somebody don't pray for the people
[32:35] what will we do we we getting worse
[32:37] surely sometime God will
[32:41] hear and he say God will hear when you
[32:44] get on to business just stay there this
[32:47] time so he accustom going upstairs and
[32:49] praying and whatnot listen to these
[32:51] words this time he goes upstairs
[32:54] different and when he goes upstairs his
[32:57] time he kneels down he puts his hands in
[33:00] the air and holler that means he talking
[33:03] loud to God God I am speaking to you
[33:08] now God thou has ears and you can hear
[33:13] you have eyes and you can see you have a
[33:17] memory I love how it is phrased here and
[33:20] this could teach us a Channel of praying
[33:23] tonight you know your word you know your
[33:27] promise so you can't approach God if you
[33:31] know nothing about God nothing about
[33:32] what his promised so the word the true
[33:36] connection with the word brings a burden
[33:39] and that burden could get you in the
[33:41] right channel in prayer so this is how
[33:44] he's praying you have ears you have you
[33:46] can hear you have eyes you can see you
[33:48] have memory you know your word you know
[33:50] your promise I plead to you God look
[33:53] down here the god of Abraham Isaac and
[33:55] Jacob that your people are in distress
[33:58] and they are dying do something for us
[34:01] God so you can apply to your family to
[34:03] your wife to your children to your home
[34:06] we have got to have you at once we have
[34:08] just got to have you or we will perish
[34:10] we must have you we just got to if we
[34:13] live and that's when you really pray and
[34:16] he prayed you know sometimes people when
[34:18] they pray they get tired don't they he
[34:21] said brother bam sometime get so tired I
[34:24] almost faint when I go to praying a long
[34:26] time just faint I go without eating and
[34:29] things for days and pray and pray and
[34:31] pray and preach I just get to a place
[34:34] I'm going to faint there sometimes
[34:36] people get that way there's no time to
[34:38] give up so he's dramatizing continue now
[34:42] so he goes up to the old cricky steps so
[34:45] there's a place where he go and pray I
[34:47] see Yoshi come by and says honey he says
[34:51] you she you are fine lovely she was
[34:53] beautiful pretty little mother he kept
[34:55] going and patched her like that he
[34:57] mother you go back put Aon and little
[34:59] Miriam to bed I'm going up to pray and
[35:01] now if you hear me weeping don't you
[35:03] come well but amram what are you going
[35:06] to do honey you you're about dead he
[35:09] said yes but I got the burden of the
[35:11] people on my heart I got to do something
[35:13] about it I got to St on my knees so he
[35:16] said today only today down in the brick
[35:18] Hill I was down there I kept saying well
[35:20] Children of Children God will hear and
[35:23] one big old man come up and put his hand
[35:25] on his hips and said when will he hear
[35:27] when will he hear you see people are
[35:30] getting bitter they are getting against
[35:33] God because they pray and pray and pray
[35:36] and nothing happens and this one prays
[35:38] and praise and prays and nothing happen
[35:40] and all the priests say the days of
[35:42] Miracle pass only thing we can do is
[35:44] just just get right down to the old task
[35:46] Masters worship Heen but I believe this
[35:50] is said in Jehovah I believe he still
[35:53] answers prayer so his little old frail
[35:56] body now now lost a lot of weight up the
[35:58] creeky steps he goes and he kns down and
[36:01] say oh
[36:02] Jehovah and he prayed like he never
[36:06] prayed before he said Jehovah look here
[36:09] you are real God we believe that you got
[36:12] ears we believe you have got eyes you
[36:14] know all things we believe you're the
[36:16] god of the Hebrews and we are the people
[36:18] of promise we believe you keep your word
[36:21] look at these heathens out here they are
[36:24] taking our cheap labor building great
[36:26] big RADS and Idols everything else you
[36:28] Jehovah would you set in heaven and let
[36:30] the Heathen rule over
[36:33] you and he said you said what we need
[36:36] today somebody like amram got the burden
[36:39] on their heart who will stay there and
[36:42] pray it through until Heaven is split
[36:44] open under and God come and answer now
[36:48] listen to this now he said God do you
[36:51] let the heathens mock at your people
[36:53] like this weeks and months and and years
[36:57] have passed we pray constantly the tears
[37:02] bath he said Lord will you permit such a
[37:05] thing I wonder today when hundreds of
[37:08] little babies are thrown into the rivers
[37:10] a cesspool and abortion he's talking
[37:11] about that let just he said Jehovah will
[37:14] you permit such nonsense to go on he
[37:17] will answer one day his WRA is Terror
[37:20] when it's come now we go a little
[37:23] further we find him almost done we find
[37:25] him praying he just gets so tired he
[37:28] lays down he just prays he just falls on
[37:31] the floor he can't go any further and he
[37:33] look take a little nap he woke up what's
[37:35] the matter he look around where that
[37:38] light was coming from standing in the
[37:41] corner there stood an angel his sword
[37:44] hanging there on his side and he rubbed
[37:47] his eyes he pulled up his knee he said
[37:49] Lord what would you want from me he said
[37:53] amram I am the angel of God I have been
[37:57] sent from heaven to tell you God heard
[38:01] your prayers I've come to tell you that
[38:05] he's going to send a deliverer he
[38:07] remembers all of his promises I see the
[38:11] angel now look at him he's pulling out
[38:13] his sword he pointed to the north and
[38:15] RAM looks he said just the point of this
[38:18] sword lays the promised land and I
[38:21] promis Abraham Isaac and Jacob your
[38:23] fathers that you people would inherit
[38:25] the land of heard the groaning of the
[38:27] people I've heard the crying of the
[38:29] children I've come down I want you to
[38:32] know that you are going to play a great
[38:34] part in this listen to this part my God
[38:40] amam
[38:42] because you were faithful in
[38:45] prayer you were faithful in your house
[38:49] and about this time next year jied your
[38:53] lovely little wife is going to embrace
[38:57] a little baby boy and that little baby
[39:01] boy is going to be a deliverer and say
[39:05] Glory oh my God pause Reon just reading
[39:08] that That's so exciting oh blessed be
[39:11] the name of the Lord I'm going to
[39:13] close but
[39:16] brand Pharaoh was training Moses Pharaoh
[39:20] had 40 years to train him then God took
[39:23] 40 years to train him let him forget all
[39:25] about it man's training and God's
[39:28] training Pharaoh was training a son to
[39:30] be a leader a diplomat a warrior a
[39:32] fighter for another coming Pharaoh now
[39:36] watch this here but God took him Moses
[39:39] on the backside of the desert and took
[39:41] all that out of him and showed him in
[39:44] five minutes time by the burning bush
[39:47] that he was the Living God it took all
[39:50] Fe out of him and got him ready and I
[39:53] close with these words here and it's
[39:55] words that you know
[39:57] God wants his people to
[40:00] pray and when Israel got so taxed in
[40:03] such a condition that they could not go
[40:05] any further their time was fulfilled and
[40:09] their burdens was laid further than what
[40:12] they taught then they begin to pray when
[40:15] the people begin to pray then God begin
[40:17] to hear it was time for that word to be
[40:20] fill so when Amon and Yoshi saw it was
[40:23] time for the word to be fulfilled this
[40:26] is the
[40:27] what did they see they were seeing it
[40:30] was time for the word to be fulfilled
[40:34] what do you see tonight when I say
[40:36] fulfilled you have to begin to see time
[40:40] for the word to fulfill in your life I
[40:43] believe it was Wednesday night we were
[40:44] saying you cannot claim what is not
[40:46] yours and this message come to reveal to
[40:50] you what is yours what is your property
[40:52] what God has given to you or released to
[40:55] you died and PID the price for you so
[40:58] you don't want to walk in ignorance that
[40:59] you don't know and you don't know what
[41:01] inheritance is about no that's why you
[41:02] come to church for that's why you here
[41:04] tonight let's wrap up here here
[41:08] is when am and Yoshi saw that it was
[41:13] time for the word to be fulfilled they
[41:16] went to pray to God and it is
[41:21] usually those who pray is the one who's
[41:24] got the burden the one who gets
[41:27] something it is those who pray that's
[41:31] ordained of God to do so let us bow our
[41:35] heads father God I thank you tonight for
[41:37] these words that I was given to share
[41:39] with your people tonight and may bring a
[41:42] burden the burden of the word may open
[41:45] up a channel a Channel of prayer may it
[41:49] open up an understanding an
[41:51] understanding of their own personal
[41:53] calling by Your Love by your
[41:56] election knowing that they have been
[41:59] elected and chosen for this hour they
[42:02] could thank you in advance for what
[42:04] you're about to do in and through them
[42:07] because you said by and through the
[42:09] bride will be fulfilled all that was
[42:11] promised bless your sons and daughters
[42:13] here tonight give them a Special Touch

[42:17] in their own homes in their hearts and
[42:19] lives in Jesus name I ask it praise the
[42:22] Lord thank you so much for being here
[42:25] I'm looking forward to see what the Lord
[42:26] will do praise the Lord so God bless you

[1:33:29] because J Jonah was called for this
[1:33:30] purpose it had to work out that way to
[1:33:32] accomplish God purpose and we as humans
[1:33:35] may not understand the tribulations the
[1:33:38] testings the trials the challenges that
[1:33:40] we have but at the end of it all is for
[1:33:43] our own purification is our own
[1:33:45] character formation it is how this word
[1:33:47] image is going to be formed this word
[1:33:50] image that we talking about this fi and
