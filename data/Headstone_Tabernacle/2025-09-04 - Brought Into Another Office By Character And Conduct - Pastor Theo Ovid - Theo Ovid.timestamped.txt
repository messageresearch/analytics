[3:50] Oh, blessed be your holy name. Praise
[3:53] the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank
[3:56] you, Jesus.
[3:58] Oh, do you love him tonight?
[4:01] Happy to be in the house of the Lord.
[4:05] And just for a reading of the Psalms,
[4:09] you don't have to find it, but Psalms 46
[4:13] says, "God is our refuge and strength,
[4:16] a very present help in trouble.
[4:20] Therefore will not we fear, though the
[4:23] earth be removed, and though the
[4:26] mountains be carried into the midst of
[4:28] the sea, though the waters thereof roar
[4:31] and be troubled, though the mountains
[4:34] shake with the swelling thereof,
[4:37] there is a river. The streams whereof
[4:40] shall make glad the city of God, the
[4:44] holy place of the tabernacles of the
[4:47] most high. God is in the midst of her.
[4:51] She shall not be moved.
[4:54] God shall help her. And that right
[4:57] early, the heathen raged, the kingdoms
[5:01] were moved. He uttered his voice, the
[5:04] earth melted. The Lord of hosts is with
[5:07] us. The God of Jacob is our refuge.
[5:12] Sailor, may God add blessing to the
[5:14] region of Israel. Let let us bow our
[5:17] heads. Almighty God, we are we are here
[5:21] to praise you tonight. Lord, we are here
[5:23] to worship you, Father. We're here to
[5:25] create an atmosphere, Lord, to declare
[5:28] you uh King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[5:31] Father, you are our refuge, Lord. You
[5:34] have been our help, Father. We come to
[5:36] testify of your goodness. We come to
[5:39] testify of your mercy, Lord. We come to
[5:42] testify of your grace in our lives,
[5:44] Lord. Father, where would you have been
[5:46] without your grace and your mercy upon
[5:48] us, dear God? You deserve all the glory
[5:51] and the honor and the praise, a
[5:53] victorious praise tonight. So, Father,
[5:55] we give you glory. And we pray that your
[5:57] anointing would come down in a special
[6:00] way, Lord, and bless us in our hearts.
[6:02] Bless our spirits, Lord. Bless our souls
[6:05] as we lift it up to thee tonight in
[6:07] worship and praise as living sacrifices.
[6:11] Oh God, we come into your house to honor
[6:13] and adore you. Lord, we pray your mighty
[6:15] presence would drop down in this place.
[6:18] The weight of your glory fill this room
[6:20] tonight. Lord, they may be few in
[6:22] number, Lord, but you suffer no man to
[6:24] do them wrong, saying, "Touch not my
[6:26] anointing. Do my prophets no harm." Oh
[6:30] God, may I anoint your speaker here
[6:31] tonight. Anoint your minister, Lord.
[6:34] Anoint him as a flame of fire to speak
[6:36] the word of God. And may the spirit of
[6:39] God, Lord, come behind that word and
[6:41] make it alive by the fire of the living
[6:44] God. Lord, may the lives of the people
[6:46] be changed. Fill them, seal them with
[6:48] the Holy Ghost, heal, deliver, restore,
[6:51] and minister to us tonight.
[6:54] We yield ourselves to your mighty will
[6:57] in Jesus Christ's precious name we pray.
[7:00] Amen and amen. Praise God. Hallelujah.

[23:27] This is our heart to hear our cry. We
[23:30] cry to you tonight for your help, for
[23:32] your mercy, for your grace, for your
[23:35] cleansing, for your forgiveness, for
[23:38] your restoration, for your healing, for
[23:40] your revival, for your power, for your
[23:42] uncction, for the inspiration, for the
[23:45] revelation. Oh God, hear our cry
[23:47] tonight. Lord, we want that Lord, that
[23:50] cry to get in the spirit. We want that
[23:53] passion to know the word. We want that
[23:55] fervent desire to please God. May that
[23:58] be our heart's desire tonight. And may
[24:01] you hear our prayer. Bless your people.
[24:03] Take me out of the way and be glorified
[24:05] tonight in our midst. In Jesus name we
[24:07] ask it. Amen. And amen. It's great to be
[24:10] in God's presence. Thank you for coming
[24:12] out tonight. God bless you. Have your
[24:15] Bibles. I like to turn to three portion
[24:17] of scripture. Romans 8. Want to read
[24:19] from 14 to18, Ephesians 1, one verse
[24:22] there, verse 11, and 1 Peter 1 1:5.
[24:27] So Romans 8:14
[24:31] to 18, it says, "For as many as are led
[24:33] by the spirit of God, they are the sons
[24:37] of God. For we have not received the
[24:39] spirit of bondage again to fear, but we
[24:42] have received the spirit of adoption,
[24:45] whereby we cry above, Father, the spirit
[24:48] itself be witness with our spirit that
[24:51] we are the children of God." And listen,
[24:54] if children, then ears. You can't split
[24:58] it. You can't separate it. If children,
[25:01] then ears. Ears of God and joint ears
[25:05] with Christ. If so be that we suffer
[25:08] with him, that we may be glorified
[25:11] together. For I reckon that the
[25:13] sufferings of this present time are not
[25:16] worthy to be compared with the glory
[25:18] which shall be revealed in us. Ephesians
[25:22] 1 and we want to read verse 11.
[25:30] I know uh yes we 11.
[25:35] Uh
[25:42] some of the page got stuck. All right.
[25:45] Verse 11 said, "In whom also we have
[25:48] obtained an inheritance,
[25:50] being predestinated according to the
[25:53] purpose of him who workketh all things
[25:57] after the council of his will." Our last
[26:01] scripture from 1 Peter 1, St. Peter, an
[26:03] apostle of the Jesus Christ to the
[26:05] strangers scattered throughout Pontto,
[26:07] Galatia, Capidosia, Asia, and Bethnia.
[26:10] elect according to the fornowledge of
[26:12] God the Father through sanctification of
[26:15] the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling
[26:19] of the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace unto
[26:21] you and peace be multiplied. Blessed be
[26:24] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
[26:25] Christ, which according to his abundant
[26:27] mercy, had begotten us again unto a
[26:30] lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[26:33] from the dead to an inheritance
[26:35] incorruptible and undefiled, and that
[26:38] fadeth not away reserved in heaven for
[26:42] you. May God bless his word. Let's pray.
[26:44] Father, we thank you for your word
[26:46] tonight. May you come and make it
[26:47] manifest. come and reveal it, unfold it,
[26:50] and Lord be glorified and in our midst
[26:52] in Jesus name we ask it. Amen.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Praise God.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's good to be here
[27:00] tonight. Feel good.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. After
[27:04] Sunday, powerful message Sunday.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Don't sell your birthright.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, tonight have a title, brought
[27:12] into another office
[27:14] by character and conduct.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the title tonight. Brought
[27:20] into another office by character and
[27:24] conduct and have an inspiration
[27:27] inheritance.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; So tonight we'll talk about about
[27:30] inheritance.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; We still hooking up to the messages past
[27:34] even Sunday.
[27:36] Inheritance the rights of the firstborn.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Don't sell your birthright.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; That's what Esau did, right? Listen to
[27:45] the scripture in Deuteronomy 21:15.
[27:48] If a man of two wives, those times they
[27:50] could have that one beloved and another
[27:53] hated,
[27:55] and they have borne him children, both
[27:58] the beloved and the hated. If the
[28:01] firstborn son be hers that was hated,
[28:05] then it shall be when he maketh his sons
[28:08] to inherit that which he hath, that he
[28:11] may not make the son of the beloved
[28:15] firstborn before the son of the hated,
[28:19] &gt;&gt; which is indeed the firstborn. But he
[28:22] shall acknowledge the son of the hated
[28:24] for the firstborn
[28:26] &gt;&gt; by giving him a double portion of all
[28:29] that he hath for he is the beginning of
[28:32] his strength. The right of the firstborn
[28:35] is his.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; So inheritance is the rights of the
[28:40] firstborn.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Don't sell your birthright.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; That is what Esau give up.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; The rights
[28:47] &gt;&gt; is inheritance.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; His portion. Isn't that right?
[28:51] &gt;&gt; So, inheritance meaning any money or
[28:53] property you receive from the debt of a
[28:56] friend or relative or as is an
[28:57] inheritance. Inheritance can be defined
[29:00] as the passing down of property, rights,
[29:03] titles, responsibilities or privileges
[29:06] from one generation to another,
[29:08] &gt;&gt; usually after the death of the owner.
[29:12] Exodus 6:8, God said, "I will bring you
[29:14] into the land."
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Concerning the which I did swear to give
[29:19] to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and
[29:22] I will give it to you as a heritage.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; So you don't work for inheritance. You
[29:28] are given inheritance.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; It is reserved in heaven spiritually. We
[29:32] read that for you.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; It's not something you earn. I want
[29:36] inheritance. Women inherit. No, no, no.
[29:37] It's already given for you. Your own is
[29:40] already reserved
[29:42] &gt;&gt; in heaven.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; That mean your name on that.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; That mean nobody could take that.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; It is undefiled. It's not corrupted. God
[29:49] has already stored that away for you
[29:51] already. Do you believe that tonight
[29:53] &gt;&gt; that you actually have an inheritance?
[29:55] &gt;&gt; You don't have to earn it, work for it.
[29:57] God just give it
[29:58] &gt;&gt; and you want to know it's for you. Isn't
[30:00] that right?
[30:01] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; But man, the promise watch. The promise
[30:06] is the baptism of the spirit. Amen.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Which is promised through the Old
[30:10] Testament and the new two.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Behold, I will give send the promise of
[30:15] my father upon you.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; So now he's talking about the promised
[30:18] land now.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; That is the promise.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; The promised land which was given as
[30:22] inheritance which is the Holy Ghost
[30:25] &gt;&gt; is to live in the land of the Holy
[30:27] Spirit.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; Not some church, not some group, not
[30:31] some tabernacle, not some assembly. The
[30:34] promise is to land a land is to live in
[30:37] the land of the Holy Spirit.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; That is God's promise for the church.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Could we get amen from that?
[30:43] &gt;&gt; That is who?
[30:45] &gt;&gt; God's promise to the church. Now, you
[30:47] know, man interpreted that and he that
[30:49] is God promise. God promised that you
[30:52] going to live in that land.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; He he told a people that they say, "I
[30:56] give you this land. I promised Abraham,
[30:58] Isaac, and Jacob, and you're going to
[31:00] have it
[31:01] &gt;&gt; as a heritage, as an inheritance. That
[31:03] going to be your land. And when you
[31:05] begin to understand that by revelation,
[31:07] healing is yours. Deliverance is yours.
[31:10] Amen. Hallelujah. Revival is yours.
[31:12] Breakthrough, that's yours, too. Oh,
[31:14] glory. Joy, that is yours. Peace of
[31:17] mind, that is yours. That is your land.
[31:19] Praise God. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[31:25] [Music]
[31:26] So that is what this revealing of the
[31:28] seals is about.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; That is what revealing the book is all
[31:32] about. To reveal your inheritance to
[31:35] reveal what you're going back to. If a
[31:37] child then an heir.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Oh glory. If a son then an heir. We
[31:42] preach that your heir have to be under
[31:44] tutors and governors. But if you are
[31:45] heir yet means you have an inheritance.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord some praises.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[31:52] There are people in America
[31:53] multi-billionaire, multi-millionaire
[31:55] with the dead and gone. They leave it
[31:56] for the children and the children is
[31:57] rascals now but they have money
[32:00] &gt;&gt; inheritance
[32:01] &gt;&gt; because they got it as
[32:04] an inheritance.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; You can't have sex with them. Is the
[32:07] mother and father work 100 years ago
[32:09] &gt;&gt; and they leave it for their children and
[32:10] them leave for their children. It
[32:12] doesn't matter if the children doing
[32:13] coke, smoking, drinking, drunk. It
[32:15] doesn't matter.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; They have an inheritance
[32:18] &gt;&gt; and you have
[32:19] &gt;&gt; an inheritance. The devil is a liar
[32:22] tonight. Regardless of what the devil
[32:23] think or what the devil feel, what this
[32:25] one feel and that one feel, you have an
[32:27] inheritance. If it's one thing you must
[32:29] leave here tonight, you must leave here
[32:31] believing that you have an inheritance.
[32:33] You don't have to deserve it. You don't
[32:35] have to earn it. God,
[32:40] &gt;&gt; listen. The promised land is to live in
[32:42] the land of the Holy Spirit. That's God
[32:43] promise for the church is to live in the
[32:46] power of the spirit. It's another world.
[32:48] It's another land. You have to come out
[32:50] of the condition you have been in to
[32:52] come out and live in this promised land
[32:54] to receive the promise. Oh, praise the
[32:56] name of the Lord. That's not the train
[32:58] that spirit. That is not putting eyes
[33:00] bright. I'm the eye and the bride are in
[33:01] Trinidad and all kind of nonsense.
[33:02] People are to get busted out of the
[33:04] train spirit, out of the human spirit,
[33:06] out of the religious spirits. Told my
[33:08] wife this message is a petri dish of
[33:11] religious spirits.
[33:14] Multiplication of that's in science term
[33:17] not a petri mixing up and things.
[33:21] Oh, inheritance. Somebody has to leave
[33:24] you something to inherit. Is that right?
[33:26] An inheritance. What do we have? What
[33:29] inheritance do we have? I didn't have
[33:31] any, but God left me an inheritance.
[33:35] Amen.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; You see, this is when the word come into
[33:40] you and challenges you to have faith to
[33:42] believe what this is saying here.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Is that you believe this or you don't
[33:48] believe this or no?
[33:50] &gt;&gt; I didn't say this. I repeating what the
[33:52] tape say.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; God left me an inheritance
[33:56] &gt;&gt; when when he put my name
[34:00] &gt;&gt; on the lamb's book of life
[34:02] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. This
[34:05] have nothing to do with who your mother
[34:06] is, who your father is, how much you
[34:07] sin, how much you fall, how much you
[34:09] backslide, how much you will backslide,
[34:11] how much you're going to sin, how much
[34:13] it doesn't have to do with that, you
[34:14] know. Before the foundation of the
[34:16] world, when he put your name on the
[34:18] lamb's book of life, he have
[34:20] inheritance. We read it reserved for
[34:22] you.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Could we hear a shout in the house?
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Peter said that.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Now you say, now wait a minute, brother.
[34:34] Jesus did that when he died for you? No,
[34:36] he never. Jesus come to purchase that
[34:40] for me. Read the very next line. In whom
[34:44] we have obtained an inheritance, being
[34:46] predestinated according to the purpose
[34:49] of him who workketh all things after the
[34:52] council of his own goodwill. Look, has
[34:54] predestinated us unto this inheritance.
[34:58] Predestinated means you are
[35:00] predetermined
[35:01] &gt;&gt; to get to this journey
[35:03] &gt;&gt; to get to this destination.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; If I am right
[35:07] inheritance of something, if God is
[35:10] knocking at my heart saying, William
[35:12] Brandon, I called you a long time ago
[35:15] before the foundation of the world to
[35:16] preach the gospel. I have an inheritance
[35:19] of eternal life. Now God sent Jesus. Get
[35:24] the bum.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; To make that inheritance real to me.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; I know you didn't get that
[35:37] &gt;&gt; because a fighter even think okay sperm
[35:40] and egg. He say there's a million sperm.
[35:42] How much sperms and one sperm hit one
[35:43] egg and that's a baby born and whatnot.
[35:45] He said and we just get problems to
[35:46] think about before the foundation of the
[35:48] world.
[35:50] You you understand what going on there
[35:52] now?
[35:52] &gt;&gt; You have to believe this. You know, this
[35:54] is what faith is about. You know,
[35:56] &gt;&gt; he said, "Watch." He said, "Uh, okay.
[35:59] So, God sent Jesus to to make that
[36:01] inheritance real to me because there was
[36:04] nothing I could do to inherit it."
[36:07] &gt;&gt; So, you are fighting yourself, your
[36:09] flesh, your past, your history, your
[36:11] memory, your life, your father, mother,
[36:14] all what your fault. You're fighting all
[36:16] of that to come to the place to believe.
[36:18] Amen.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; That God have left that inheritance for
[36:22] you
[36:23] &gt;&gt; because there's nothing you could do to
[36:25] inherit it.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; It was blank. There was nothing I can
[36:28] do. But in the fullness of time, God
[36:30] sent his own time. Jesus the lamb from
[36:33] the foundation of the world. His blood
[36:35] was shed that I might go to my
[36:38] inheritance
[36:40] &gt;&gt; to be what? What? Inheritance? To
[36:42] sunship?
[36:43] &gt;&gt; To be a son of God. So eternal life is
[36:46] inheritance and sunship is inheritance.
[36:49] As men are led by the spirit of God,
[36:50] they are the sons of God. We have to go
[36:52] back to inheritance which is your
[36:54] sunship and your sunship have godship
[36:56] with it. Your sunship have inheritance
[36:59] with it. Oh give the Lord a shout.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; This son thing is not a Trinidad sun
[37:04] thing. You know that's not something we
[37:05] talking about. You know this son is
[37:07] attribute sons of his spirit. Amen.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; This is not your natural birth thing we
[37:15] talking about. You know when he says
[37:17] sunship, it is going back to how Adam
[37:20] was
[37:21] &gt;&gt; before the fall
[37:24] &gt;&gt; because Adam was a son of God in the
[37:26] image of God and he was a a god of the
[37:29] earth.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Small G.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; And God was God of the universe. Big G,
[37:34] but Adam was small G.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; God of the earth. That was what sunship
[37:39] was about. He could speak to the
[37:41] mountain. He had power of words. He had
[37:43] power of fellowship. Oh, he had power
[37:46] over the animals. He had power over
[37:47] every creeping thing. When man fell, the
[37:50] animal bother with him
[37:54] &gt;&gt; because he out of order.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; So the animals themselves couldn't
[37:59] recognize man as their master anymore.
[38:07] When Adam sinned by heeding to his wife
[38:10] reasoning instead of hold on to the
[38:12] words of God, Adam turned loose the word
[38:15] and sold out. He lost also his
[38:19] inheritance. When he lost his fellowship
[38:22] and right to life because the day you
[38:24] eat thereof, that day you die. Here we
[38:26] go. When he lost his life, he lost also
[38:29] his inheritance in life.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; So with life have an inheritance.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; You lose your life, you lose
[38:37] inheritance.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; He was a God of the earth. God is a God
[38:41] of the universe everywhere. But his son
[38:43] had this earth under his own control.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; He could
[38:51] Hallelujah.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He could speak.
[39:09] He was a God of the earth. Go. Right.
[39:11] Go. He could speak. He could name. He
[39:13] could say, he could stop nature. He
[39:15] could do anything he wanted to. When he
[39:17] did that, when he fell, he lost his
[39:19] inheritance. Adam could say, "Let this
[39:21] mountain be moved here. Let this tree be
[39:22] planted here." He had complete control
[39:26] as a minor God under God our father
[39:29] because he was a son of God.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; So going back to inheritance being going
[39:34] back under control, under dominion,
[39:36] under conquering, under overcoming,
[39:39] under what Jesus had, just think about
[39:41] it to meet the challenge of the hour.
[39:43] All them cancer and diseases. Praise
[39:45] God. Them sons of God was going through
[39:47] them things. The Bible said Jesus healed
[39:49] all manner of sickness. All manner of
[39:52] diseases. Not some, all all manner of
[39:56] sickness. All manner of diseases. If
[40:00] Jesus come back, he will do the same
[40:01] thing. And when the sons of God come
[40:03] back to their inheritance, that same
[40:05] thing will be done.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; The same power that rested in God rest
[40:09] in Jesus Christ. The same power to rest
[40:12] in Jesus Christ will rest in placed sons
[40:15] in the body of Christ. Sons with
[40:17] inheritance, not sons with talk, sons
[40:20] that have the walk.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Praise
[40:23] God. Hallelujah. Can we give the Lord a
[40:25] shout?
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; So, Adam forfeited the book of life and
[40:31] knowledge of Satan, lost his
[40:34] inheritance, lost everything, and there
[40:37] was no way for redemption. Then God made
[40:40] the likeness of men came down and become
[40:42] a redeemer to redeem us. And John heard
[40:45] the announcement. He come to make
[40:47] claims. No man in heaven, no man under
[40:49] the earth. That's where the book come
[40:51] now. That's why all this thing coming
[40:52] here. No man in heaven. Because it it
[40:55] have to do with inheritance. It have to
[40:57] do with sunship. It have to do with
[40:59] possession. People say, "What about them
[41:00] seals?" And the seed is a mysterious
[41:02] thing. No, it's not a mysterious thing.
[41:03] You know, in that way, you know, it's
[41:04] about the title deed of the earth. It's
[41:07] what we had in the beginning. It's what
[41:08] was making sons in the beginning. That
[41:11] is what Adam lost. Satan couldn't hold
[41:13] that deed. So it went back in the hands
[41:15] of original owner waiting for redemption
[41:17] claims, waiting for redeemer. So Jesus
[41:20] didn't die just to save us. He died to
[41:22] get the book.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Did you
[41:27] get that? Now Jesus didn't just die how
[41:30] the Pentecostals and the rest of the
[41:31] church will see it. But the reality is
[41:33] this. He died to get the book.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Because once the book is restored and
[41:37] the book had to be brought down to the
[41:39] earth, the book went up into heaven. But
[41:42] Revelation 10 said, "I saw another
[41:43] mighty angel come down from heaven and
[41:46] the book was open. He come to bring it
[41:48] on the earth to show that the book is be
[41:51] restored. Sunship is be restored.
[41:53] Inheritance is be restored." Because
[41:56] when the lamb took the book,
[41:58] &gt;&gt; the first thing John said was what? We
[42:01] shall reign on the earth. We couldn't
[42:04] reign without the book.
[42:06] [Music]
[42:13] Do you catch
[42:15] &gt;&gt; that? Sickness have a beginning.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Sex have an ending.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Everything had a beginning. Have to have
[42:21] an ending.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Disease and all what Satan have to do
[42:24] and have a be have an ending.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; So we not here just to kill time.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; The whole creation is waiting for this
[42:31] birth where sons of God will be born
[42:33] into manifestation. Do you understand
[42:36] that God was waiting for the capstone
[42:38] time, headstone time, fullness of the
[42:42] Godhead, fullness of time to produce the
[42:44] sons of God?
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's continue.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Watch. No chance of redemption.
[42:51] Everything failed. Then he had the land
[42:53] and tribe of Judah prevail and overcome
[42:55] and conquered. No one in heaven under
[42:58] the earth was willing to open a book
[43:00] because if that book was not taken out
[43:02] of the hand of original owner would have
[43:03] been lost and went back after the
[43:05] forfeiture right we couldn't get our
[43:07] promises what couldn't have forfeit the
[43:09] rights of the word the promises and the
[43:11] inheritance
[43:12] &gt;&gt; so getting back the book means a
[43:14] restoration of our promises
[43:16] &gt;&gt; and our inheritance
[43:18] &gt;&gt; oh how we have to praise God tonight
[43:20] listen to this it was a lamb redeemer a
[43:23] lamb redeemer the first redeemer was a
[43:25] lamb in the garden of Eden it was a lamb
[43:26] that God offered and he had come again
[43:28] plumbing in revelation. A lamb to redeem
[43:30] what? Redeem what? Fallen the fallen
[43:34] condition and the fallen inheritance of
[43:36] a fallen race of people. A lamb come to
[43:39] redeem back like ours was in the
[43:41] beginning to to redeem what what was he
[43:44] going to redeem? Why this word
[43:45] redemption? What he was going to redeem?
[43:48] Anything that has been redeemed is
[43:50] something that have been lost.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Is something that have been lost has
[43:53] been brought back again. What does he
[43:55] bring back to us this lamb? Everything
[43:58] we had at the beginning.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Shout out everything.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; So this redemption brings back
[44:03] everything.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; That is why Abraham said if this tree
[44:07] put forth another
[44:09] &gt;&gt; original branch, it will produce another
[44:12] day of Pentecost.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Not message churches, another day of
[44:15] Pentecost.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; This church thing is a means to an end.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Let me say it again.
[44:21] This church thing is a means to an end.
[44:23] This is not the end game. God prod have
[44:26] have to reproduce the original seed
[44:28] &gt;&gt; which was on the day of Pentecost. And
[44:30] that original seed produced another book
[44:32] of acts. What was the book of acts? The
[44:34] acts of the holy ghost among god's
[44:36] people.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Not the acts that the preachers giving
[44:38] exhortation and preaching. Something
[44:40] seem to be going off.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Oh praise God.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything. What did we have
[44:47] at the beginning? Eternal life.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; We were hes. We had life. We never had
[44:52] to die. We never had to be sick. We
[44:55] never had to get old. We never had any
[44:58] worries. There was no funerals, no
[45:00] graves, no evil, no death, no gray hair,
[45:04] no stoop shoulders, no mourning, no
[45:06] crying. We had life eternal. We had a
[45:09] jurisdiction over the earth. Hallelujah.
[45:12] So where eternal life had dominion,
[45:15] &gt;&gt; had authority.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. When Jesus speak, you
[45:19] know what they said? Never a man spake
[45:21] like that man because he spoke with one
[45:24] having authority because he was the book
[45:26] itself. Okay the Lord I shout in the
[45:29] house. Hallelujah. With the book comes
[45:31] authority. I take every spirit under my
[45:34] control for the glory of God. You heard
[45:37] William Brandham say that. What did he
[45:39] do? He took authority.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every demon know that the
[45:43] whole of heaven was behind him. Oh give
[45:45] the Lord some praises in the house.
[45:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And one of these
[45:50] days, every devil will know the whole of
[45:52] heaven is behind you
[45:54] &gt;&gt; because the angel of the Lord encamp
[45:55] around them that fear him.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You're going to come
[45:59] into power. You're going to come into
[46:00] possession and you're going to come into
[46:02] your inheritance. Do you believe that?
[46:13] &gt;&gt; This Bible is a beautiful book. Amen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; So even though you talk about
[46:17] inheritance, remember what we read when
[46:19] I preach about two sons back that a son
[46:22] if he's a child though he's a heir,
[46:25] &gt;&gt; you can't tell the child go and take the
[46:27] land and take the car and take this and
[46:28] drive and whatn not.
[46:31] So a father leave back a car for the
[46:32] child as inheritance. 6 years old, 7
[46:35] years old, he go and start the car to
[46:36] drive, go and kill himself. The child is
[46:39] under tutors and governance until
[46:42] &gt;&gt; until he's mature enough
[46:44] &gt;&gt; to deal with the responsibilities of
[46:46] inheritance
[46:48] &gt;&gt; or the business.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Do you get it? So if in the natural
[46:53] world they have this why must God break
[46:55] his own law and do like if he's not I
[46:57] mean not even a business person will
[46:59] allow
[47:01] somebody tell me that the Syrians and
[47:03] and they with all these clothes some of
[47:04] them these children they start to learn
[47:07] to to the the roles are cloth from from
[47:11] the containers.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; They're not dropping them behind the
[47:15] cash register to the boss and CEO. No.
[47:18] So the children will know the work from
[47:20] the bottom up. Yes. Yes.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Nobody can say, "Oh, that's not my job.
[47:24] I'm not going to carry no clothes." That
[47:26] how they making all the money
[47:28] &gt;&gt; from the container.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; And then putting people can buy how to
[47:31] cut the cloth and they know every part
[47:33] of the job.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; So when you complain, they know what
[47:37] what you're complaining about if if it's
[47:39] serious.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Because that is the training.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; No, every son might want to take that.
[47:43] They always had the Rascals one, the
[47:45] Judas one, all kind of characters and
[47:46] sons.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; And the same thing in God's program too.
[47:51] And you're going to find out today the
[47:53] title why we call it brought into
[47:55] another office by character and conduct.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; It's not the same words.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Character and conduct. Character is who
[48:03] you are. Conduct is how you behave.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Character is internal. Conduct is
[48:10] external.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Character is what God see.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Conduct is what the people see.
[48:20] Hallelujah.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Character is like the root
[48:23] &gt;&gt; and conduct is like the fruit.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Your conduct reveals your character.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Or we can say this way, your behavior
[48:33] reveals who you are.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[48:42] So nature is groaning for the sons of
[48:45] God to be manifested. I skipped down
[48:47] because nature was cursed with his
[48:49] master. When his master was cursed the
[48:51] highest then nature fell with the
[48:53] master. But when this kinsman redeemer
[48:55] come and redeem back the man that was
[48:58] master over nature then all nature is
[49:01] waiting for the man master.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Now that child here we go in the old
[49:06] testament he never had any inheritance.
[49:10] Why the father couldn't trust him with
[49:12] anything? What kind of fellow would he
[49:14] be? But he couldn't trust him. He's
[49:18] always a son, but he never had any
[49:20] inheritance. And if you don't watch
[49:22] Pentecostal church, there's going to be
[49:24] a lot of no inheritance. Notice in the
[49:27] Old Testament now, this boy when he is
[49:28] born into a family, the first thing the
[49:30] father did when he got old enough, he
[49:32] said, "We thought he born into the
[49:33] family, he had no inheritance yet." Here
[49:36] the part I want to get to. But he had to
[49:39] find out what kind of person that's
[49:42] going to be before he has an
[49:43] inheritance.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; So that's my child. You having this, you
[49:48] having that? No, not not not like that.
[49:49] I want to know
[49:52] &gt;&gt; what kind of person this is here.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; So then you put time on that.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus was starring age 12. Knowing not
[50:03] about my father's business, God put 18
[50:05] years on that.
[50:08] Hallelujah.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; 18 and 12.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; He cannot go to advance and university.
[50:12] You know, he was a bright guy.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; But God make sure he had 18 years of
[50:18] silence.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; 18 years under Joseph
[50:21] &gt;&gt; in the carpenter shop.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; 18 years listening to the scribe and
[50:25] Pharisees misinterpreting scripture.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't say nothing. He couldn't
[50:34] say liar. make havoc in the church and
[50:36] mash up. Hallelujah.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; False shock. Jesus. Jesus. Good. He had
[50:44] to keep quiet.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; He had all the false interpretation,
[50:47] false revelation, false inspiration, no
[50:49] inspiration, no anointing, half dead men
[50:52] &gt;&gt; and he had to wait
[50:54] &gt;&gt; until the time.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; God loosed John the Baptist sign
[51:01] forunner. Jesus knew because the
[51:03] scripture talk about behold I send my
[51:05] messenger before my face.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; He knew John was coming.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; He still had to wait
[51:10] &gt;&gt; until God tell him stand up in line.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; And he is in line like everybody else.
[51:16] He saying you know you who I am supposed
[51:18] to be in front.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; What behavior is that?
[51:22] &gt;&gt; What what conduct is that?
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[51:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't push himself. He stand up in
[51:27] line and John baptizing baptizing when
[51:30] Jesus he said my goodness you should
[51:32] baptize me. You see what going on there
[51:34] now?
[51:35] &gt;&gt; He said that is so but it behooves us to
[51:37] fulfill all righteousness.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Oh Messiah is on the earth now. Nobody
[51:42] knows but John. Oh give the Lord a
[51:44] shout. Hallelujah. Nobody know but John
[51:48] because God tell John the one that you
[51:49] see that dove rest upon
[51:52] &gt;&gt; and remain
[51:53] &gt;&gt; and remain. Don't forget that part you
[51:54] like that the most important part you
[51:55] know because dove does land and bust it
[51:58] you know land and take off you know cuz
[52:00] the dove thinking is some lamb wolf wolf
[52:04] wolf roof roof wolf wolf and as the dove
[52:09] land like that imagine God looking for a
[52:12] lamb preacher when he think is a lamb
[52:14] preacher he us say you do them so it
[52:17] pull like a cat
[52:19] &gt;&gt; he said do them the other way
[52:21] &gt;&gt; do them this way
[52:22] &gt;&gt; I want do this way that when he grow
[52:25] that when he grow come out
[52:27] &gt;&gt; dove take off. So when that dove remain
[52:29] on Jesus, he knew that was the lamb.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus come now and Jesus going to heal
[52:35] the sick, raise the dead, cast out
[52:36] devils on his way to Calvary,
[52:39] &gt;&gt; on his way to present the blood price to
[52:41] purchase us
[52:43] &gt;&gt; as a possession.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are like his inheritance.
[52:47] He purchased you with his own blood.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; He's not going to lose you. All that the
[52:51] father hath given me will come.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So nobody can
[52:59] put you out the kingdom.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; They could put you out with their mouth,
[53:02] but they can put you out the kingdom.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Now, if someone or some
[53:14] individual lost their inheritance that
[53:15] was given to them by God, there come a
[53:18] year called the Jubilee year.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Every seven years a Sabbath. Every seven
[53:22] days they had a Sabbath. Every seven
[53:23] years they had a Sabbath. And seventh
[53:25] Sabbath was 49 years. And the 50th year
[53:28] was a jubilee. And in this jubilee,
[53:30] every man that had lost an inheritance
[53:32] by some means. He was freeborn through
[53:35] blood of Israelite. No matter who held
[53:37] the possession, it had to go back to him
[53:40] &gt;&gt; because God set us up this way.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; They could keep it for so long and no
[53:44] more.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; That devil could keep it for so long and
[53:47] no more. He has to loose you and let you
[53:50] go. He has to put his hands off of you.
[53:52] When you hear that Jubilee trumpet, when
[53:54] you hear that freedom road, hallelujah,
[53:57] that devil have to pack up, give up, let
[53:59] go.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Without this revelation, you wouldn't
[54:08] know you could go free. So the revealing
[54:10] of the seals, the revealing of the book,
[54:12] the real of the mystery reveals to you
[54:14] your inheritance that you could know
[54:16] what you have to go and possess. Oh,
[54:19] glory to God. So you wouldn't just sit
[54:21] and steer. You would worship and give
[54:23] God praise
[54:24] &gt;&gt; and begin to make your claims.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Note what that chat person cry who is
[54:37] worthy to take the book.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Not as faith.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Note the words.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; But Abraham said when the lamb took the
[54:49] book, I like that. Hallelujah.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; He was saying, "I claim them."
[54:54] &gt;&gt; He was taking it to claim it. Not for
[54:56] himself,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; but for his people.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Not for himself, but for you and I. I
[55:02] claim them. They are mines. Oh, glory to
[55:05] God. Give the Lord some praises.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; The lamb did that. The lamb had to claim
[55:10] it. What do you think you have to do? I
[55:13] claim my son. I claim my daughter. I
[55:16] claim my health. I claim restoration. I
[55:19] claim a revival. You have to open your
[55:22] mouth and make your claim.
[55:25] [Applause]
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Do I have a shout in the house tonight?
[55:31] &gt;&gt; You cannot claim what is not yours.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There's enough
[55:36] to shout tonight. That's why the
[55:38] revelation reveals what is yours. You
[55:41] said this is mine. My father left it for
[55:44] me. No squatter is going to be on my
[55:46] land. This is my land.
[55:50] [Music]
[55:58] Watch this. In this jubilee, every man
[56:02] that had lost his inheritance by some
[56:04] means, if he was freeborn, no matter who
[56:06] held the possession, it had to go back
[56:09] to him free.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to pay a thing.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to do a thing. just stop
[56:16] what he was doing and go back to
[56:17] inheritance.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; And listen,
[56:20] &gt;&gt; this is a big one.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; He had a right to it.
[56:23] [Music]
[56:27] &gt;&gt; It was a Godgiven right.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Write with me.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Because he by grace had inherited it.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Not by works,
[56:39] &gt;&gt; by grace.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; And it would have been given to his
[56:41] fathers, handed down year upon after
[56:44] year. No matter what taking place, if he
[56:46] lost it, it must go free.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; It meant grace is way provided for each
[56:52] individual to return to their rightful
[56:55] inheritance.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; What a picture it gives tonight of the
[57:00] church in this last day. You see what
[57:02] man can do and then you see what God
[57:05] does. What man does is failing and will
[57:08] fail has failed. Always will fail. But
[57:10] what God does is eternal and must
[57:12] forever remain. Nothing can ever take
[57:15] its place. God give it. It's a free gift
[57:18] by sovereign foresight. He saw it and
[57:21] placed it and there is nothing could
[57:22] move it. It is there eternally. And at
[57:25] Jubilee was God's manner of expressing
[57:28] grace to his people for restoring what
[57:31] he brought them back to their rightful
[57:32] position.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; That's why he said if the power is to
[57:35] come among the people, it wouldn't even
[57:37] be their prayers. It will be the grace
[57:39] of God. That don't mean you will stop
[57:41] praying. Oh, give the Lord some praises
[57:43] tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory
[57:46] to God. Glory to God. Glory to God.
[57:49] Hallelujah.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; But God is trying to place his church in
[57:57] position
[57:58] &gt;&gt; to manifest himself.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Not to say we right others wrong. We
[58:04] have it. That that church will have it.
[58:06] And you know, everybody else kind of
[58:08] foolishness that come out minister's
[58:09] mouth. bringing division and bringing a
[58:12] set of nasty disrespectful attitudes
[58:14] among believers thinking that they're
[58:16] superior to other churches. Bunch of
[58:18] nonsense. Every church have three kinds.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; They're doing like they only have one
[58:21] kind. Oh, give the Lord some praises. He
[58:24] said in the church you find good, bad,
[58:26] and renegades. Who said that? The
[58:28] prophet said that.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; And now you're changing that. You're
[58:32] still on the same page. You can read it
[58:34] over and over and over. He said the Holy
[58:36] Ghost is poured out on individuals. When
[58:38] you see that, you could tell yourself
[58:40] that is for me tonight.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; That mean I can receive the Holy Ghost
[58:43] tonight. I had to I don't have to wait
[58:45] for sister dum dum or sister dry up or
[58:47] sister no praise or no praise brother.
[58:49] Oh praise God. I don't wait for nobody
[58:51] dead as a doornail. I don't have to wait
[58:53] for who behind me who in front of me.
[58:55] The Holy Ghost is poured individual and
[58:56] I'm an individual in good. That mean God
[58:59] can pour it on me tonight.
[59:01] [Music]
[59:03] &gt;&gt; If you don't want it, I'm taking it.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight.
[59:07] certainly
[59:16] not this certain not the trinity gospel
[59:18] right all right so God is trying to
[59:22] place the church in position what for to
[59:25] boast
[59:26] &gt;&gt; to be proud
[59:27] &gt;&gt; to post on Instagram and and and social
[59:29] media no the church in a position to
[59:32] manifest himself
[59:35] &gt;&gt; not for ministers to parade their beef
[59:38] for Christ to manifest himself.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Watch. Getting one that he could work
[59:43] through like this and say, "There is my
[59:46] spirit
[59:47] &gt;&gt; flowing freely."
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Not the minister's mouth ringing. There
[59:50] is my spirit
[59:52] &gt;&gt; flowing freely.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; I can work here. Get another one and
[59:56] place him. I can place him. Adoption
[59:58] placing manifesting. Take him in out
[1:00:01] there and put a ceremony. Visit him with
[1:00:03] an angel. Tell him something.
[1:00:05] [Music]
[1:00:09] If he making up something, it won't
[1:00:10] work.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; You see, there are a lot of them have
[1:00:13] that. I mean manifestation of sons of
[1:00:16] God. When God manifests himself and he
[1:00:18] sends him out or when he goes forth,
[1:00:21] what he says is truth. What he does is
[1:00:23] the truth. What he does, he manifests
[1:00:25] Christ.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; How do you judge him?
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; By the way he stays with the word.
[1:00:32] But if the people not trained with the
[1:00:34] word, they judge them by the pink
[1:00:37] glasses the ministers put on their eyes
[1:00:38] before they get out the church.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; When they when the deacons or whoever
[1:00:44] else fit them with them glasses,
[1:00:46] everybody see pink, you know
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; because the glasses is pink.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; How do you judge him? By the way, he
[1:00:55] stays
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; with the word.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; All right. So let's go a little bit down
[1:01:01] to this character and conduct.
[1:01:03] Character is a person on the inside.
[1:01:07] It's a sum of one's moral qualities,
[1:01:09] values, integrity, honesty,
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; and inner disposition.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Character have to do with the heart,
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; motives,
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; objectives.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; One time some minister said, brother
[1:01:21] Brandham, he says there's oil somewhere
[1:01:22] there. I said, brother, when we get
[1:01:24] that, we'll serve the Lord. We'll pay
[1:01:26] for this and that and the other. Bra say
[1:01:29] don't use the gift for commercial thing
[1:01:30] but somebody some one of them went down
[1:01:33] there they get a little dripping of oil
[1:01:35] and afterwards they going the selfish
[1:01:36] mode and all that or what all they say
[1:01:38] with their mouth they change
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; and they didn't realize it's a little
[1:01:41] vain they get and to confirm what the
[1:01:43] prophet saw somebody else come and get
[1:01:45] the real thing
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; so God has watched people motive
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; an objective
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; isn't that right
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; praise God Job
[1:01:58] Bible say there was a man in the land of
[1:01:59] Oz whose I don't know how to pronounce
[1:02:02] it whose name was Job and that man was
[1:02:04] perfect and upright one that feared God
[1:02:08] and isued evil.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; That's speaking to the character of the
[1:02:12] man.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Daniel 18 but Daniel purposed in his
[1:02:17] heart that he would not defile himself
[1:02:20] with the portions of the king's meat,
[1:02:22] nor with the wine which he drank.
[1:02:24] Therefore, he requested of the prince of
[1:02:27] the unox that he might not defile
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; himself.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; That determines the kind of character
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; that's in the man. In other words,
[1:02:35] character is what you are when nobody
[1:02:37] else is around.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Conduct. Conduct is what somebody does
[1:02:46] outwardly.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; An expression of behavior,
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; action and choices in life. Conduct is a
[1:02:55] demonstrations of one's character.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Job 1:22. In all this job sin not nor
[1:03:04] charged God foolishly.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; So Job character and behavior was lining
[1:03:09] up.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; It was in alignment.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; 1st Samuel 18:14
[1:03:16] says, "And David behaved himself wisely
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; in all his ways,
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; and the Lord was with him. So the
[1:03:24] character is the inner man,
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; what you really are
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; and your conduct or behavior is what
[1:03:30] others will see what is reflected and so
[1:03:33] on.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Now the Pharisees had a different thing.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus said you are like whited sea
[1:03:38] fulkers which indeed appear beautiful
[1:03:41] outward
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; but within full of dead men's bone.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; So their conduct and their character was
[1:03:47] two different kind of things.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; They're saying something and living
[1:03:51] something else. Pharisee.
[1:03:55] We see it.
[1:03:59] Character shapes conduct.
[1:04:03] Conduct reveals character.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Not always. The hypocrites could always
[1:04:09] put on an Oscar award
[1:04:11] in their behavior. Different character.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; In Colossians 3, this is both character
[1:04:19] and conduct. How Paul speaks here. In
[1:04:21] Colossians 3:12-13 says, "Put on
[1:04:23] therefore the elect of God, holy
[1:04:25] beloved,
[1:04:26] Paul speaks bubbles of mercies,
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; that's inside,
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; kindness, that's inside. Humbleness of
[1:04:34] mind, meekness, longsuffering, you don't
[1:04:36] see those things."
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Then he comes after and said,
[1:04:39] "Forbearing one another,
[1:04:42] that is a display to others.
[1:04:45] And forgiving one another,
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; that is to others. If any man have a
[1:04:50] quarrel against any, as Christ forgive
[1:04:51] you, so do ye. So this thing about
[1:04:54] forgiveness and forbearing is
[1:04:56] demonstrated Christianity
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; based upon what is on the inside.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Character is who you are before God.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham, he said this,
[1:05:10] the burden of the word of the Lord to
[1:05:11] Israel by Malachi. I have loved you say
[1:05:14] the Lord. Yet you say, wherein hast thou
[1:05:16] love us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother?
[1:05:18] sayeth the Lord. Yet I love Jacob.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; I hated Esau
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; and laid his mountains and his heritage
[1:05:25] waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
[1:05:27] You see, they could not figure out God's
[1:05:29] love.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; They thought that love meant no
[1:05:32] suffering.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; They thought that love meant a baby with
[1:05:35] parental care. But God said his love was
[1:05:38] elective love.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; The proof of his love was election. And
[1:05:42] no matter what happened, his love was
[1:05:45] truly proven by the fact they were
[1:05:47] chosen under salvation. Because God had
[1:05:49] chosen you to salvation, through
[1:05:51] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[1:05:53] of the truth.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; He may commit you to death as he did
[1:05:55] Paul. He may commit you to suffering as
[1:05:57] he did Job. That is his prerogative. He
[1:06:00] is sovereign, but is all with a purpose.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; If he did not have a purpose, then he
[1:06:05] would be the author of frustration and
[1:06:06] not peace. His purpose is that after we
[1:06:10] have suffered a while,
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; we would be made perfect,
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; be established, strengthened, settled.
[1:06:17] As Job said, he put his strength in us.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; You see, he himself, talking about
[1:06:22] Jesus, suffered.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; He learned obedience by the things that
[1:06:26] he suffered. He was actually made
[1:06:28] perfect by the things that he suffered.
[1:06:30] And then he quoted Hebrews 5:8. Though
[1:06:32] he was a son, yet learning obedience by
[1:06:34] the things that he suffered. and being
[1:06:36] made perfect, he became the author of
[1:06:38] eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:06:40] obey him.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Are we ready? Now,
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; in plain language, the very character of
[1:06:46] Jesus was perfected by suffering.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; And according to Paul, he has left his
[1:06:51] church a measure of suffering that they
[1:06:53] too by their faith in God while
[1:06:55] suffering with for him would come to a
[1:06:58] place
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; of perfection.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Question, why did he want this? Answer
[1:07:04] James 1 2 and 4. My brethren, count it
[1:07:08] all joy
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; when you fall into temptation. That is
[1:07:12] that revelation right there. Knowing
[1:07:13] this that the trying of your faith work
[1:07:15] at patience.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; So God has frustrated those who hurry,
[1:07:21] who anxious, who feel that they're
[1:07:23] supposed to have it right away and they
[1:07:25] want to lock God neck and pack with God.
[1:07:27] He said the try and ref work with
[1:07:29] patience and let patience have a perfect
[1:07:31] work that you may be perfect and entire
[1:07:33] wanting nothing.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Why does he stand by? The reason is
[1:07:37] this. Romans 8. If children then hes the
[1:07:42] scripture I read tonight.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Hairs joints with Christ if so that we
[1:07:46] suffer with him that we may be glorified
[1:07:48] together.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; So you see how this thing I the bride
[1:07:51] and think is it does it fit in here
[1:07:53] tonight like that? like it was a
[1:07:54] carnival man just chipping down the road
[1:07:56] going to the rapture it working no not
[1:07:58] carnival anymore for I reckon that the
[1:08:01] suffering of this present time are not
[1:08:04] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:08:06] which shall reveal in us
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; unless we suffer with him
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; we cannot reign with him
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; you have to suffer to reign
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; the reason for this is character which
[1:08:18] is the inner part
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; which is the inside part which is the
[1:08:21] part people can't see with their Guys,
[1:08:23] character simply is never made without
[1:08:27] suffering.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Wake up inside of here.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Wake up, church.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Wake up, bride
[1:08:34] of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. There's no
[1:08:36] other way. Shaking the pastor hand.
[1:08:39] Singing specials don't give character.
[1:08:41] Writing message songs don't give
[1:08:43] character. Preaching night sermons don't
[1:08:45] give character. Coming to church don't
[1:08:47] give character. Sitting on the events
[1:08:48] don't give character. Saying amen don't
[1:08:50] give character. Suffering brings
[1:08:52] character. Pain br character. Oh God,
[1:08:54] don't get me started tonight.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; We are reach. We are reach. There's only
[1:09:02] 12 pages. I reach eight. So we just have
[1:09:04] four more again.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; I said narrow the pages when I come out
[1:09:07] Wednesday night.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't this sweet tonight?
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; This is sweet gospel.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. People don't
[1:09:19] like to hear about cross, debt, death of
[1:09:21] a corner wheat, dying out, debt to self,
[1:09:24] uh, giving up their own ideas, giving
[1:09:26] they don't want to hear that.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; They want to say you are this, you will
[1:09:30] unveil God, you are perfect, you are all
[1:09:31] kind of thing like them like all them
[1:09:33] modern people have been speaking them
[1:09:35] new age speaking this thing. What the
[1:09:38] affirmation thing I am strong um, I'm
[1:09:41] strong, I'm good, I'm right, I'm this,
[1:09:44] I'm healthy, I'm this.
[1:09:47] that that that has nothing to do with
[1:09:48] the Bible.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; So watch a man without character can't
[1:09:54] reign because power apart from character
[1:09:56] is satanic.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; But power with character is fit to rule.
[1:10:00] And since he wants us to share even his
[1:10:03] throne on the same basis that he
[1:10:05] overcame and is set down in his father's
[1:10:08] throne, then we have to overcome to set
[1:10:10] with him and the little temporary
[1:10:14] suffering.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; What you're going through is not
[1:10:16] permanent. Though God man
[1:10:20] the little temporary suffering we go
[1:10:22] through is not worthy to be compared to
[1:10:24] the tremendous glory that will be
[1:10:26] revealed in us when he comes. What
[1:10:28] treasures are laid up for those who are
[1:10:30] willing to enter into his kingdom
[1:10:31] through much tribulation. Think it not
[1:10:33] strange concerning the fiery trial that
[1:10:37] comes to try you. That is what Peter
[1:10:39] said. Isn't it strange? Here we go. That
[1:10:41] God wants us to develop a Christlike
[1:10:43] character that comes through suffering.
[1:10:46] We have we all have trials. We all are
[1:10:49] tried and chasened as sons. Not one but
[1:10:51] goes through that. The church that is
[1:10:52] not suffering is not being tried hasn't
[1:10:56] isn't of God.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Who and he quotes Hebrews 12:6. For
[1:11:02] though for whom the Lord loveth, he
[1:11:05] chasen it.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Jacob I love licks. You know
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; when Jacob thinking he getting one bride
[1:11:12] he had to work on XM years again. Yeah.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; God God gave him a run for your money.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; For whom the Lord loveth, he chastenth
[1:11:21] it and scorcheth every son whom he
[1:11:23] receiveth. But if ye are without
[1:11:25] chastisement whereof all are partakers,
[1:11:28] then you are bastard and not sons. Now
[1:11:31] this special condition in Smyrna must be
[1:11:35] applied to every age. There's no age
[1:11:37] free from it. There's no true believer
[1:11:39] free from it. This is of God. This is
[1:11:42] the will of God. It is needful and we
[1:11:45] need the Lord to teach us the truth that
[1:11:48] we are to suffer and be Christlike in
[1:11:51] doing it.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Love suffering long and is kind.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Now, this is where we get the title
[1:11:56] from. Are we going to close? All right.
[1:12:00] Notice when the child is born, he was a
[1:12:02] son.
[1:12:04] You ready?
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; But his conduct had to do with his
[1:12:08] inheritance.
[1:12:09] Not the sermon,
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; not his gift.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Now I want to be real honest now. Don't
[1:12:18] you think that we have tried to push the
[1:12:20] inheritance just a little further than
[1:12:21] God our conduct went? What's the matter
[1:12:24] today? We should be way up down the road
[1:12:27] yonder, but we are way down here. It's
[1:12:29] been our conduct.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; We have no respect.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; And you know, brother George is here
[1:12:35] from Kaiwa. I always say want our church
[1:12:37] to know by two things. bright love and
[1:12:39] respects.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; My scare was this bunch of disrespectful
[1:12:42] trainard spirit God will judge it.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; People get killing this message for the
[1:12:46] disrespects
[1:12:48] and over the years I've seen it. And one
[1:12:50] thing I wanted to get the group to be is
[1:12:52] under bly kindness and respects not even
[1:12:54] knowing that a revision broadcast was
[1:12:56] going to break
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; but I was concerned and I didn't want
[1:12:59] the people to be saying this and saying
[1:13:01] that that's why we don't come and talk
[1:13:02] to Banal and confusion things here
[1:13:05] because I want you to have the right
[1:13:06] attitude.
[1:13:08] say our man bad. So you are still a son
[1:13:10] and daughter but you are So you are
[1:13:12] still a son and daughter but you are
[1:13:15] living under your privilege and your
[1:13:17] conduct each day as the Holy Spirit
[1:13:19] brings it before the father gives away
[1:13:21] the things that you do. You're still a
[1:13:23] son and daughter but you never brought
[1:13:25] to the place that you should be.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Great gifts that are in the church are
[1:13:28] so misused. No reverence to it. Just a
[1:13:31] bunch of carrying on. I'll skip quickly.
[1:13:34] Sometime ministers Oh, I skip that.
[1:13:36] Notice the tutor brought the message to
[1:13:37] the father and said the child is
[1:13:38] progressing right or wrong. No matter
[1:13:40] what the outside people had to say about
[1:13:42] this child, what the servants or the
[1:13:44] farmer had to say, he tried to work
[1:13:45] every way to please the father. And no
[1:13:48] matter what the world has to say about
[1:13:49] you, here we go. Come on, bride. Work to
[1:13:51] please God.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Do everything to build the kingdom of
[1:13:55] God.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Don't never separate it. Build it
[1:13:57] together. Don't never divide it by
[1:14:00] denominational barriers. Don't do those
[1:14:02] things. Watch. Don't let those little
[1:14:04] things that man put into the church ever
[1:14:06] separate brotherhood because you are
[1:14:07] Methodist. Shake hands with the Baptist
[1:14:09] because you're Presbyterian. Shake hand
[1:14:11] with the Pentecostals. We are brethren.
[1:14:13] Don't let little barb wires barriers
[1:14:16] separate you from fellowship of the
[1:14:17] saints of the living God who are
[1:14:19] brethren in precious faith. If they
[1:14:22] don't know how much watch if they don't
[1:14:24] know how just how much you feel then you
[1:14:25] pray for them
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; and associate with them
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; and fellowship with them
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; and God will spread his love abroad
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; into their hearts. Oh, praise the name
[1:14:34] of the Lord.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Notice when the son had come to a place
[1:14:40] of accountability say 21 we call it
[1:14:42] today. If the tutor had brought a word
[1:14:43] to the father and told him everything
[1:14:45] was fine, almost done, and he done all
[1:14:48] he could do to improve and better the
[1:14:49] kingdom, then this boy had we called the
[1:14:51] placing of the son. The father taken him
[1:14:53] out in a public place, set him up before
[1:14:55] the public. The same son that have been
[1:14:57] born in the home years ago all the time
[1:15:00] his son, but his character
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; and his conduct has brought him
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; to another office.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; That is where I get the title from. Not
[1:15:11] just sons
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; in the message
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; but character
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; and conduct.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; You see where the virtues come in now?
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; You see why Baram said this being
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; when it's completed
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; is the servant of God
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; in the church of God
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; that's going in the rapture. Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; He never said this sermon, this message,
[1:15:38] this mystery, this revelation, this
[1:15:40] unfolding of the word. He never said
[1:15:41] that.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; He said this being
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; when it's completed
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; is the servant of God
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; in the church of God
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; that's going in the rapture.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Then he said, I hope you see it. Music
[1:15:55] come, please. Our character should have
[1:15:57] us up into a place where we can be in an
[1:16:01] office to meet the crisis of the hour
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; that we are in.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; I know I never read this before.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; I know this. This is fresh. This is new.
[1:16:17] But is it is the word. I'll read it
[1:16:18] again. Our characters should have us up
[1:16:21] into a place
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; where we can be in an office
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; to meet the crisis of this hour
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; that we are in.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; What a shame we are. But will God answer
[1:16:33] in a time of crisis? He will not only
[1:16:36] answer but he will make manifest in the
[1:16:39] time of crisis.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; No matter if there's two or three.
[1:16:42] Notice the tutor brought the message and
[1:16:44] the father finally take the son to the
[1:16:46] place where he has to be manifested.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; It is time. There's a bomb here for the
[1:16:52] church today to be manifested.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; If the other fellow draw the line, you
[1:16:58] just live right along this line.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; You be the salt.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; And God will make him thirsty
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; if you be the salt.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we see the father come
[1:17:09] and roe the son and then have a public
[1:17:12] ceremony with the rights. In other
[1:17:14] words, his name is on the check just as
[1:17:17] good as the father.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; And this is a closing here. Now page 11,
[1:17:22] we find in this last day in our
[1:17:24] organization of Pentecost, we have come
[1:17:26] in and organized ourselves and rejected
[1:17:28] the leadership of the Holy Spirit by the
[1:17:30] wisdom of some groups of people. instead
[1:17:32] of having fellowship one with another is
[1:17:35] divided and separate into several
[1:17:37] different groups. Skip now. Now a man
[1:17:40] and woman and his family could go back
[1:17:43] to their original inheritance if they
[1:17:45] could hear the Jubilee trumpet song. We
[1:17:48] haven't walled ourselves away from it so
[1:17:50] far as we could hear what somebody say
[1:17:52] instead of thus say the Lord is. He said
[1:17:55] come back to the original inheritance to
[1:17:58] the real Holy Ghost again.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Listen, I'm
[1:18:02] close with this thing. There is no such
[1:18:04] thing as joining the church.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; There is no word for it in the Bible.
[1:18:09] You cannot join the church. The church
[1:18:12] is the mystical body of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:15] And you got to be born into it by the
[1:18:17] baptism of the Holy Spirit. Let's all
[1:18:20] stand and give God some praises. Father,
[1:18:22] we bless you tonight. We thank you for
[1:18:24] your truth. Another office by character
[1:18:27] and conduct. May the people see it in
[1:18:30] Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God
[1:18:32] bless you. Praise the Lord.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, give him praise tonight. Give him
[1:18:43] glory. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you Jesus.
[1:18:47] Thank you father. Hallelujah.
[1:18:48] Hallelujah. Oh, glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. How many love the word
[1:18:56] tonight? How many appreciate the word of
