you may be seated I just come here to introduce the tape this evening the tape is the message called the second com of the Lord 43 years ago 1981 while up in kwall up in a house that we used to have service in we had a prayer meeting just about five of four six of us and a vision broke I saw this vision and the sheet dropped down and I saw this message the second coming of the Lord and at that time we hadly have of books and stuff we don't know all what the m mes was all coming to Trinidad and so like that I wanted to know if but Bram preached a message second come of the Lord and I discovered that he did and I went into that message and when it reached the spot where it say when the church finds his brotherly love when the church finds hold decency when the church finds his place in Christ it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us to cut a long story short December the 31st that Independence Day weekend 43 years ago this August here God brought a revelation of Brotherly kindness to us in kW to me and that was the key to if you see what brotherly kindness is just above that you would see the Holy Spirit slot so brotherly kindness is the key to access this called the holy spirit so realize that faith is based upon forgiveness and to access God's presence with Faith by faith you have to come through blly love so this is a key key message in our ministry in my life it was a key moment in my life through this message I saw brother Michael mcmo I got introduced be introduced to B Heman in 1981 that's how we met we met by Revelation I went with Revelation up there and so on and that was a door that was open so I pray and trust that God bless you today as we go straight into deep right now but a shame praise the Lord the second come of the Lord and it will tie to this morning's message praise the Lord heavenly father as we come to thee tonight in that lovely name of the Lord Jesus we are so happy as we approach these holy days knowing that this represents the greatest time on Earth is when that all sufficient sacrifice was made that poor lost Sinners might be made free and have this great hope that we have within our bosoms tonight that someday he will come again and tonight as approaching this Pulpit coming through the door and hearing this old song We'll have a grand homecoming week the first 10,000 years brings back memories of many years ago when we met here in the Tabernacle before the great worldwide Revival started and father God we just cherish those thoughts and seemingly good in our soul that we return again tonight to begin another one of those oldfashioned revivals where Sinners call out for mercy and more the backslider makes things right with God again and the Holy Spirit is the main person in the meeting who takes hope and rules and brings to us the bread of life through the word and we pray that he'll minister to us night after night in this revival heal the sick and the needy sanctify every believer and get Glory out of these efforts that we put forth for Father God it's only to the honor and Glory of his name that we asked it [Music] amen this is to fulfill a promise that I made 11 years ago long time getting around to it but to return back to the Tabernacle for Revival and now we know that our little Tabernacle is insufficient in room for a Revival but we'll just Jam in here and the best we can for the next few nights for the glory of God and uh I love to have a meeting in the church many places we have them in stadiums and out in the outdoors in the Arenas but there's something different when you have it in the church there seems to be that it's a sweeter closer Fellowship when you're in the church out in those Arenas worldly places we are grateful for the privilege of being out there but it seems like that you find uh an oppression like a demon power that you have to break through before the Revival ever starts and then when you come into the church it's the place where God dwell it's coming to his house to haveen need and now we're glad tonight to see many of the old faces that I saw years ago in the ending up of my ministry here at the Tabernacle see brother Grim in brother Curtis and sister Angie and sister Gertie here brother Cox and sister Cox and oh my so many of you sister Spencer and brother Spencer and all of you in here we're so happy Mama Miss Slaughter and brother over here just great groups of these still how many's in here from the time we started back I mean when I left in the Revival to go out let's see your hands all over the church tonight just look at the hands that's very fine now we are know that revivals only come by the Holy Spirit he's the one who brings Revival and we can't do it ourself we can only make make that effort and God has to bless that effort and we trust that he will now in the Blessed word I wish to read just a a verse or a line or two out of St Luke's gospel and the 15th chapter the 8th verse either walk woman having 10 pieces of silver if she shall lose one piece does not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she has found it and when she has found it she calleth her friends and her neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I have lost now that may seem like a very OD God scripture for the second coming of Christ and but it's speaking of the second coming of Christ and this great subject that we have here before us now is one of the most vital subjects in the entire holy RI there's nothing so important as the coming of the Lord Jesus for if he does not come we have been found false Witnesses are dead that's in the grave are perished and there is no hope left for us if Jesus doesn't come visibly the second time and in the very this light in the very light of the second coming was so important that this Holy Week that we are now approaching that Jesus when he was approaching it at the first time in the very Shadows of the Cross he spoke very little of his death burial and Resurrection he spoke more on his second coming than he did on his death burial and Resurrection so in the light of this it must be a very important subject in the Old Testament there is many times more scriptures in the Old Testament pertaining to the second coming of Christ than there was to the first coming of Christ everything to the human race now after the atonement has been made rest solemnly upon the second coming of the Lord now we have different religions and we have different uh uh bodies and different theologies but our Christian religion is based solemnly upon death burial and Resurrection and the second coming of the Lord oh it's an important question and as we are now approaching to my most sincere thoughts we are living in the very Shadows of his second coming are there to my way of seeing By the Light of the scripture there is not one hope left for the church outside the second coming of the Lord the world in its wild panamon condition has got completely out of control of every manmade organization in the world Kings cannot hold their subjects no more neither can dictators hold their subjects anymore democracy cannot hold its subject anymore and there is no hope left but the second coming of the Lord Jesus and it's now one of the most uh horrible time for the unb believe and sinner that he is ever witnessed because the Doom time is close at hand and it's the most blessed time for the believer for his Redemption is at handise there's two factions in the Earth tonight the believer and unbeliever the one the Lord is coming to receive and the one the Lord is coming to condemn at his coming will bless one and will curse the other at his appearing and being that this is such a vital thing I think just before at the Eve brother of our little Revival that we should look solemnly and into the scriptures and see how close that we are if I wanted to know what time it was I would look at my watch if I wanted to know what day of the week we was living in or the month of the year I would look at the calendar and if I want to know the approaching time of this great event I look at the word of God it tells the time when it is at hand for the Bible said when these things begin to come to pass lift up your head your Redemption is drawing n the time is at hand it was such a great thing to John the Revelator on the aisle of patmas that when he saw the preview of the coming of the Lord when he saw the curses that rested upon the unbeliever and the blessings that rest upon the believer he screamed out even so come Lord Jesus amen it so thrilled his heart after all he had seen the events before his coming he screamed even so come Lord Jesus amen and when the whole church age had been passed in his you and he seen everything and major the way it would happen then the scream come Lord Jesus it must be a glorious thing that the coming of the Lord draws near at hand Jesus when his disciples had got to a place that they were looking at the carnal or the Natural Things of the earth now here we want to stop just a few minutes it doesn't have to always be carnal that will draw us away sometimes just the natural things will draw us away Jesus servants or his disciples was pointing to him the City Temple Jerusalem the Great temple word the god in his kind of Glory had appeared in the holiest of holies and when they told him of how goodly the stones was placed in how the Great Master Mind Of God had ordained these Stones was cut in many places in the world and come together and in 40 Years of its erecting there was wasn't even to a buzz of a saw or the sound of a hammer it was so masterly put together and it how God had come in over the chair and and it showed forth his shakina glory and how they had great hope in this great church and Jesus told them see not all these things yet it was a holy place it was a good place it was a place House of the dwelling of the Lord but Jesus said don't see these things I've got something to tell you that's far greater than this Lord for there's coming a time he said that there will not be one stone left up on the other no matter how well we try to take care of our physical being no matter how hard we work for our organization how hard we work in the church for our our orders of the church there's coming a time when all those things will vanish and pass away Jesus begin to tell them that and they said what will be the sign of the coming of the end of the world and Jesus begin to speak to them the time will come when there will not be Stone left upon the others you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars pestilence earthquakes in diverse places and the other day over in California up in Oakland when it was our privilege to be there in a meeting and it was the first time that my wife had ever been in an earthquake I was sitting in the barber shop and I the room shook just a little and the radio quickly announced our earthquake was on said they're looking for another in about 8 minutes and I felt oh what if this is the last one I hurried from the barber shop met my wife who was waiting on the street walked into a little drug store to get some little picture cards to send back to our loved ones and while we were there one of the most mysterious funny feelings that man could ever feel the whole Earth earth begin to rock the bottles begin to fall from the Shelf the flu begin to fall off the building and into the street overrun the people screaming and crying as the plaster fell from the walls and the big buildings with 30 and 40 stories Rock together until the smoke or dust from the Marty went up like great mushrooms and people begin to scream and run I said that is the finger of almighty God saying the handwritings on the wall Jesus said when you hear of earthquakes in diverse places the Earth split open down a highway for a long ways about 5T and went way down hundreds of feet in the earth one place the entire Highway dropped in and I thought as that split open I could just almost see the finger of almighty God saying and there shall be earthquakes in diverse places while the day was going on eight different earthquakes rocked that City and beard J open and drunk swarmed into the streets and women walked the streets half dressed and everything as if nothing had ever happened people are so Earthbound today to I don't know what it will take to shape this country they just seem to be so unconcerned they don't notice and one man even made a remark as I heard him with my own eye said did you see what I did I shook my fist I am the Superman and I thought such blasing I never thought so much of that as Blas me as I did right here in our own city as I was going out the highway last evening to Georgetown as you cross the sections out here just before you hit the new highway coming forth there was a great sign sticking up there and it said he is risen has life and the very next sign then to alone said where there is but wiser beer there is life I thought that's all there is to it and the Bible said that before the second coming of Christ that men should be blasphemers walking in their own ungodly lust truce Breakers and false accusers how the world has become in such a delusion in Bombay India recently when Billy my boy and I were there in a great meeting where T of thousands of Hindus gave their life to Christ there come a great warning now I want you to watch the intelligence of Nature and all of a sudden for some unknown reason all the little birds in the city begin to leave for the country and Birds by swarm left for the country and they begin to notice all the cattle and the sheep and the ox but in India their fences is not like I they're not wooden fences they're great Rock fences that's built high and all the cattle begin to get away from the walls and get away from the buildings and go way out in the middle of the field and begin to Mill around out in the middle of the field then all of a sudden the Great Earthquake struck and shut down the Walls trees Rock Miss flew and the birds never returned and the cattle stayed out in the field and man went right along thinking it was all right and the next day another earth quake rocked and more buildings turned over and the missiles flew and on the third day the cattle went back to the walls and the bir words return to the city amen oh he who feeds the sparrow he that brought his little creatures into the ark still lives and Reigns and they seem to have more intelligence about God than man does who he created in his when man blessing the little creatures of the Earth Earth God provides for them and they made their way away from the big walls that have been killed the birds would have been mased in the cracks of the rock as it Rock to and fro signs of his coming oh it's a great day that we're now living in earthquakes and diverse places pestilence all those things that Jesus Jesus spoke of is here to my way seeing it I don't see anything left but the coming of the lord it's at hand Jesus in the also in his address to his people he said learn a parable of the Fig dream when it is tender and begins to put forth leaves you say summer is not and when you see these things begin to come to pass know that the time is at hand notice what the Fig Tree was the fig tree has always been the Jewish Nation he said not only the Fig Tree but the other tree when you see the Fig Tree and all the other trees putting forth their buds now he spoke not only of the Fig Tree but the other tree now let's just notice when it's putting forth its Bud we have lived in a very peculiar time in the past few years the Gentile church has had one of the greatest Revival that has ever had since there since the days of the Apostles or the Gentile Church didn't have the Revival then it was the Jewish church that had the Revival but the Gentile Church in the past 10 or 12 years has had the greatest Revival of the history we are thinking of the Martin Luther Revival yester it was a great but that was in Germany alone we're thinking of the Wesley Revival that that was in England it spread forth over here in a few of the British aisles but never took too much effect but in this day this revival at on of the supernatural as absolutely covered from sea to boundless sea amen the world over to Great radio and magazin and advances who went out on sponsored by mankind and a daughter Revival that tens of thousands times thousands of souls have been born into the kingdom of God In my own little fragile Ministry that the Lord has given me I've seen well over a million Souls come to the kingdom of God Amen think of it when others of these great Ministries who sweep out radio and so forth to the millions there's Revival fires that's burnt on every hill in the world practically since I since about 10 years ago since uh we got started in the Revival we're at the end time now notice then just before that he prophesied here and said the walls of Jerusalem will be Tred down down by the Gentiles until the Gentile dispensation would be finished the Mohamad have tuck it over we realize that and I want you to look at the crisis tonight how ishma and Isaac are still at each other's neck right at Jerusalem where it's predicted they would be and a few years ago there was hardly any Jews at all in Jerusalem now Jesus speaking when you see the Fig Tree put forth its Bud now the Jews has been scattered to all the world great numbers millions in Germany and in Italy and in the United States all over the world and God as he did in the early days hardened Pharaoh's heart he hardened muscan his heart on the Jews and the Jews was ousted from Italy he hardened Hitler's heart and they were oued from Germany he hardened Stalin's heart and they were Ed from uh Russia and have you been noticing the paper that we the United States are taking sides with the Arabs amen oh brother the handwritings on the wall God said whoever blesses Israel will be blessed who curses Israel shall be cursed amen now I have a picture at home or I believe it's loaned out at the time called but the scientist 3 minutes before midnight if the scientific world has said the clock has went around until it's 3 minutes before midnight and I think they cut that down now to about 1 minute before midnight when they discovered hydrogen uh oxygen Atomic all those great powers that they could harness could completely cause a total annihilation in 5 minutes time they could absolutely tonight not be one living person on the entire North America continent in 30 minutes and it's laying right in a bunch of infidel TS who ha us and besides that we've got barges and ships set all placed around on both to Siberia over in Hungaria and different places where our ships are setting loaded with the same type of missiles Breen if later than you think Solomon Gore little knew that night that they were living their last hour little in Egypt know that the death angel that had been predicted to come would come that night little did Pearl Harbor realize that raised the tough [Music] place we are we in the bounce and found warning we are near the end time what would happen if they right in Moscow could direct them missile Guided by the stars and radar could land that bomb exactly on Fourth Street in Lille if you wanted to right and we can stand out there in the seon somewhere on our ships and direct one right straight on the Caple of Moscow if we want to what would happen my brother if that great missile turning would take place and this country would receive a shake at the same hour we turn loose the same things and shake it to the other side and we're living on a little bitty tiny thin crust anyhow when the earthquake say eat around and eat around until it's like pwing out an egg it you make one big burst and this 8,000 M stick of lav would spurt into the air it would do exactly what God Said would take place we're at the end time we are here no way to stop it all the begging we might put a Eisenhower and ever County and it will never stop it Jesus Christ said these times would come we are here the Fig Tree putting forth its bug in this picture way down in Iran you read in the look magazine how that they took big planes and went down there got plane loads of these Jews thousands of them been down there since the carrying away of Babylon been in there for 2500 years and had been left down there they were apping with old wooden instruments they know nothing about Jesus ever being on Earth they know nothing about anything but their old Jewish tradition Traditions that they had lived by and when these planes set out and begin to load these Jews on to take them back to the Homeland the prophet prophesied 28 or 300 years ago and said when they come out of that captivity God will bring them forth on the wings of eagles amen the prophet saw the plane coming he saw them sitting down on and picking them up and taking them back to the Homeland he didn't know what to call it he just looked like an eagle to him so he said they'd be brought back on the wings of eagles and when they got out of the airships and the young was he the old they were interviewed and they said have have you come back to the homelands to die they said no we've come back to see the Messiah oh great steamship from around the world in the last few years has steamed into Jerusalem with aged Jews young and old dress in their gar com from the east from the west and hanging over the Capal of Jerusalem is that old six point star of David the oldest in the world that hasn't fed for 2500 years is declared a nation tonight amen Big Trees is putting forth her buds Jerusalem is growing the Lord is restoring the signs that the prophet foretold that Gentile days numbered with farrows and crumbers return oh disperse to your own amen for the day of redemption is near man's hearts are failing for fear be filled with God's spirit your lamp trimmed and clear look up your redemption's drawing near it's later than we think we don't come to church to occupy a Pew we do not come to church to hear a good sermon or come to church to hear good music they're all got their place but what we better come to church to do us check up with God and our soul salvation for the day of redemption is near Jesus Christ God's son liken this he said to a woman and in our subject tonight we find this woman her husband had gone and she had lost one of the coins out of her tablet now I will try to explain that the day if a woman is married she should wear a wedding ring as a sign that she's married that's to keep other men from having anything to do with her they look and they see she's a married woman those days they didn't have wedding rings they had a tablet they call it tablet they put on their head it had 10 coins and it went around their head and that was a sign they were a married woman and no man must have fool with them no boys was to flirt with them they were married each one of those coins if we only had time but I hav't I'm going to try to keep my word as close as possible I can tell you what each one of those coins meant it was placed in there and each coin meant a certain virtue of that woman the first meaning her love to her husband second her pledge of virtue to live clean for him and the third and fourth and fifth all to the n9th and 10th if you want to look it up look in Galatians 5 you'll find out that that woman represented the church and the church is an espoused wife to Christ and the tablet that the church is supposed to wear is found in Galatians 5 which is love joy peace longsuffering goodness weakness patience that is the tablet that's supposed to be worn in the church Brotherly Love kindness fellowship and this woman when it must have been along about dark that she realized that she lost one of those kind oh if there ever wasn't time that the church ought to take inventory to find out if you got all the coins on it should be now it's getting dark the the very haunt and clouds of destroying civilization is hanging over the Earth sin and deot on every hand we're living in a tremendous time when there's wickedness people who go to church just for a shame people who go to church to try to hide from their meanness people who go to church and profess Christianity and live like the rest of the world drinking smoking gambling winning immorally dressed wearing clothes that they ought to wear in the in their own dressing room out on the street before public and Brotherly Love is a thing that's pass me almost we have not lost one coin but we've lost prly every one of them and it was getting nice and remember her husband would return and if he found her with one of those coins out it showed she'd been marked a harlot if she had defiled or defiled herself in any way and it was seen by the people they brought her before the priest and brought witness that she had been found such and the priest seeing that she was a married woman took the coin out of her tablet that she'd been doing wrong by if she had marred her virtues they took that out if she had been flirting showing that she wasn't true to her husband they tuck that one out whatever it was they tuck it out and when her husband returned he found that she had been marked and he would divorce her immediately and have nothing to do with such a woman he did not want such a woman so it was getting along towards dark when she realized that she had lost something time for her husband to come and it's getting late the church better be examining theirself by the word of God Amen all our Purity our loyalty our devotion we become tlers taale bearers cigarettes smokers backbiters painted up Jey Bells everything in the calendar that the rest of the world of the Christian church is associating in those things today so you can't hardly tell the one from the other it's time weat tough inventory it's getting late now in order it was so late so she had to light a candle and she got a candle not only did she get a candle but she got a brw amen and she went to house clean oh brother if there ever was a need of a time of a lighting of the candle the sending forth of the Gospel Light the Holy Ghost back into the church not so much for emotion not for some fantastic not for some emotional workup not for a jumper or Joy but for a heart searching experience when man and women get right with God Amen we're at the end time and she lit a tanel to give her life and brother every little candle in here ought to be lit tonight not only that but she got the bru and the neighbors could see the dust flying she had a real house cleaning time for her husband was about to come and if he called her with that one coin out she was a harlot brother we the Church of the Living God these great hours that we're now living it use us to check up go before God light the candle of the word of the gospel and examine ourselves and find out if we're not falling sharp and especially when we see all these things coming we're at the end time the coming of Christ is at hand there's not another hope in the world for the church and look the church is lying the church has no conscience you can hardly wake them up the Bible said there would come in that condition when they say l our Lord the L is coming and they'll be devouring and biting one another and so forth and fighting around it's just exactly that hour everything's ready the pages is turned as it was like that and it's ready the coming of the Lord the Lutheran Church lost her life the Methodist Church lost her life the Baptist Church lost her life the Pentecostal Church lost her life every light seems to be gone the Pentecostal people the Holiness people is acting just exactly like the Methodist the Methodist is acting like the Baptist the Baptist is acting like the Lutheran the Lutheran is acting like the Catholic and it's all gone back to one great big conglomeration of sin right we're in the end time the coming of the Lord now she had a house P time she scrubbed the Flor she swept the wall she took down the Cog web she kept on until she found what she had lost and when she did she called her little sister churches to come now I don't care if your Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian come let us rejoice together amen that time comes when the church finds his brotherly love when the church Finds Its holy decency amen when the church Finds Its place in Christ it'll call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us amen God wants the church to love him I believe it was Sunday morning when I was speaking on the virtues of woman how blessed who could find a sweeter thing than to come home tired when God has given a man a wife a woman and a man is inseparable they are one in the creation God created them first both together and they're one heart soul mind and everything when he made man in the dust of Earth he separated from his wife when he made Eve he didn't go make a woman pick up some more dirt but he took from the side of Adam a rib and made his wife he said she's bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh they were one in heart soul and body it's a type of Christ God didn't take Christ Church from a Creed neither did he take it from a denomination he taken it from the heart of Christ the spirit in his side through the blood my brother sister I don't care how religious you might be if you're not covered by the blood you're lost amen we'll get into that de tomorrow night sure how vital it is but you're lost without the blood now then when he made that wife she was a companion it was something for him to love it was part of him now listen close g a man or a woman can never go to heaven except they are borned again amen I don't mean because you spoke with tongues I don't mean because you've shouted I don't mean because you've danced I don't mean because you went to church and been regular wear a button for your faithfulness those things are all right but that's not it there has got to be absolutely a union connection between you and Christ that you become one praise the Lord you are one and if you're not how could you imagine coming in at night time tired weary War if you're a farmer mechanic preacher whatever you are come in when you go into your little home you're long until you can get there you open the door and a sweet little wife stands there she greets you she's all preted and cleaned up she walks over and kisses you on the cheek she says Dad you're tired she sets you down in a chair she sets herself down on your lap she put her arms around you and she Pat you it just seems like then you're not tired something picked you up it's something something that God gave you for that purpose it's a part of you now if she's a true wife but what if those lips has kissed another man that day or some other time what if you're conscious of that what if them arms has hugged another man she is absolutely Abomination on your lap that kiss burns like a Judas kiss those AR you Rel wouldn't be around you oh she may be all preted up her hair may be curly her eyes may be brown her cheeks may be Rosy her little skirts may be armed she may be so pretty but if that real genuine Godly respect and love and confidence isn't there she'd be better off to stay off your life you don't want nothing to do with her she's a she's an edate to you I don't care how pretty she makes herself she's still wrong until she has proven to be a real genuine sweetheart loving nobody but you no other kiss from her lips but yours no other arms to hold her but yours and you know it What a Feeling what a consolation that is husband and wife which is type of Christ and his church and when you go to your church you may have the best pews in the city you may have the highest people there is in the city you may have the best pipe organs you may dress the best you may sing like a mocking bird but all of that if you're kissing and flirting with the world that kiss on the cheeks of Christ is a judari kiss he doesn't want nothing to do with you he looks upon your wedding G uh engagement range and he finds the tablet mov he finds Love Has Gone it's a form he finds loyalty has gone you've committed fornication with the world you go to dances and Boogie wogie parties and watch old dirty television programs you are committing adultery with Christ on him and calling him your husband the Bible said you say I am rich I have need of nothing but he said you don't know that you are naked miserable blind poor and don't know it's it's time we lit a candle and Str the house the coming of the Lord is at hand let's think that over just a few minutes while we bow our heads will you would you turn to your P sister what have you been doing Church what's your conditions tonight when your hands

God bless you just look at the hand I didn't come here to be seen I come to find out something and I believe that God spoke to my heart while you're preaching and I realize that I'm wrong I I want to be a real true Christian I want to be a real lover that when I go to my Lord and kneel on my knees I want him to embrace me in his on say oh my lover remember Solomon how he spoke of it he said come my love let us walk through the pomegranate let us walk through the garden of spices how he said her lips look like rose buds and so forth how he loved his little wife said come let us go and take our fill of love when you get down to your altar to pray is your heart so true and your soul so adulterated that you said Lord God let us take our love and he said yes my lover I love you or have you been committing fornication have you been flirting with the world and the hour of the Lord is at hand on all these signs and wonders with tens of thousands of other things that's taking place por every markers porny is getting dark there's a cooling off in the church the Revival seems to be over the last bit is about finished and here we find oursel in adultery what will he do he'll shove us from his lap and say depart from me you workers of iniquity now if there's someone here would like to be remembered again I might ask at this minute raise your hands to God say I now surrender and Sav by

than I do I believe in coming to the altar that's good but that doesn't save you it's your opinion your decision of Christ you say well if I walk up to the altar that's good but brother did you realize when you raise your hand you break every scientific law there is your hand by Nature by gravitation ought to hang down if you raise your hand it shows there's a supernatural being in you that's able to defy the laws of nature to raise your hand toward your creator something in your heart made a decision God sees you raising your hands just the same as he sees you at the altar that's exactly right if you mean it God means it too but look friend you can't be halfway you've got to mean it now let us pray blessed Heavenly Father tonight at the beginning of this revival as our time has swept up now a little pass I pray thee to be merciful to these people and Grant almighty God that here tonight at least 20 hands went up in the building that they needed Christ oh God it's their souls the spirit of oil is just about burnt out there won't be much more when the last drops gone from the bucket or the container there will be no more or put in lamps they realize that they're in the last days there's not a Hope on Earth for us outside of Christ I pray tonight Lord that somehow in the solemnness of this moment this solity that you will now send the holy spirit that made them raise their hands and save them from a life of sin granted father and may before this meeting shall end May there be literally dozens of them many shouting with the Holy Spirit may this baptistry just be just one after the other baptized in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ on Easter morning rising to newness of life oh Eternal blessed father I pray that you will bless them granted Lord
