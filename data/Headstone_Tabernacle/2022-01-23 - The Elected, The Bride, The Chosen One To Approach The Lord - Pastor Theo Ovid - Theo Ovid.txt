heads oh jesus we love you this morning and we invite you to in our midst of the preeminences lord and visit your people in a special way father you want to remember sandra mobin and tf muhammad requested lord of prayer virus lord may they be healed in the name of jesus for better hugh williams lord in his foot condition lord may that swell and go down and may he be healed father god lord we thank you for the praise from sister janice thanking you for the doctors say her foot is healing well father and she's thanking the saints for their prayers may continue to may she be quickly be restored and any person's sick lord those connected to us may have visited them in a special way and touched them in the name of jesus and father god as we approach your word this morning may the holy spirit come into your word and pause your love and minister to your people in jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you welcome thanks for coming it's good to be here it's good to have you here this morning and if i have your bibles i'd like you to turn to one portion of scripture this morning psalm 65. i want to read from verse one to four the scripture that we used in um in the parameeting exhortation on friday psalm 65 verse 1 to 4 to some i just love the first line is just something to me praise waited for thee and my my mind and thoughts and that is not grumpiness not not complaining but praise waited for thee oh god in zion unto thee shall the vow be performed o doubt that here is prayer unto thee shall all flesh come iniquities prevail against me as for our transgression thou shalt perch them away blessed is the man whom thou chooses and causes to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple but let's pray one more time father i thank you to be here this morning and for these scriptures it's awesome these scriptures and i pray you would give context inspiration revelation i don't even know how to bring this out but may you just take all the words and just fit it together and edify and strengthen and build up your people and jesus might ask it amen and amen you will be seated oh praise god so this scripture means a lot to me and um i just want to bring back some things from the first just before we get into it from the prime meeting um on friday and the title was revisiting the altar of incense and we read from psalm 65 also psalms 141 and i read from matthew 5 just want to read that back quickly and jesus was talking about um you have heard in old time said in old time though shall not kill whomsoever shall kill shall be in danger of judgment but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment now this is back to the bible now this is not in church and i believe the message this is the word now angry brother brother cause shall be danger of judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa shall be in danger of the consul and but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be danger of hell fire therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there remembers that thy brother had ought against thee leave dear thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift and this is the amplified okay he said i say unto you that everyone who continues to be angry continues to be angry remember hear me talk about people renewing the anger renewing like is a driver's permit or some kind of thing like that or the bank they're renewing every year right watch i said to you that everyone who continued continues to be angry with his brother or harbors malice enmity of heart against him shall be liable and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the court and whosoever speaks speaks contemptuously and insultingly to his brother shall be liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the sahedrin and whosoever say you curse fool you empty-headed idiot shall be liable to and unable to escape the hell of fire so if you are offering your gift at the altar you dare remember that your brother has any grievance against you leave your gift at the altar go first make peace with your brother then come back and present the gift so now we're talking about a god now not going to church a lot of people go to church but they're not studying who they're going to meet and god is the god of the word not your feeling no but god is the word now so you say if you want to receive you want me to receive your gift or your prayer or your request do what is right and when you do what is right to come back surely i'll receive what you offer up oh praise god isn't that something else isn't that what elijah did he said lord all this i do according to your name and on will father let the firefall and fire came and consumed the rocks consume everything because he did it according to god's will god couldn't deny him oh blessed be name of the lord so first just sell summary and let we go and continue you come to the brass altar that's the place and then that's the first place the brass altar that's the altar where the sacrifice is laid but we're trying to get to the altar of incense because the old of incense is where genuine prayer is offered okay so watch the sacrifice is to be offered daily and god placed that breath that ought of incense just before the most holy place so you place it in a special place sacrifice is to be offered daily morning and evening daily lighting daily training of whips no not saying that just for words you know you have to see your life connected into this in a daily way daily prayer daily reading the books when you're doing something put on a tape so you just won't be idle doing something you're listening while you're doing praise be to jesus that's the key while you're doing something you have a tape playing there and you're you're being soaked into with the word and the devil have no room to give any old foolish thoughts oh praise god because you're always flying with this i'm flying with that he's the prince of the poor of the air so he on that wavelength to put thoughts into your mind praise god and the word of a wavelength to bring thoughts into your mind and if you have the thoughts of the word you will speak the word could somebody say amen so on the daily we have to die daily to have the altar of confession amen that is where we die daily isn't that right the brass altar praise god woe is me amen no confession no cleansing no cleansing no commission you must be washed by the washing of the water of the world first the brass altar where the sacrifice must be accepted and fire is the confirmation of the acceptance of the offering of the fire of the holy ghost so when god come down is that put an offering and walk away god always come down and confirm if the orphan is correct he send fire on it to confirm he have accepted your sacrifice and when you lay upon the brass altar and god accept your sacrifice fire break upon your soul holy ghost and fire it's not talk about much but you still have fire it's still a brass altar it still have a calvary experience it's another depth of self it have all of that but people praise god cuckoo in their mind looking for fresh revelation fresh torch itchiness oh glory to god hallelujah who started the fire first the first fire god himself started the fire and the other fire was lit from that fire but the fire came from god is not right the brass altar the lever to wash this and then the seven golden candlesticks are trim life partaking of the bread of the word then the altar of incense nothing to burn there no strange fire on the altar oh praise god just breaking into the inner veil where the glory never failed i feel so good coming here today because i feel praise god you're getting a great picture that is not church oh glory to god you're coming to him this morning the title of the message is the elected the bride the chosen one to approach the lord oh praise god let me say it again the elected the pride the chosen one to approach the lord and what scripture we read this morning blessed is the man whom thou chooses and causes to approach unto thee oh glory to god if if you ever invite oh hallelujah you know sometimes things going wrong and you didn't you didn't get to invite if you get to invite to cause you to approach god you should be the happiest person in tnt you get to invite you chosen and invited to be able to be in a position to approach god you know what we're talking about there's an approach in the past there's an approach in the church there's no on bishop there's not a person's own prophet this is approaching god himself oh give the lord some praises praise god you were blessed this morning bless for this invitation i like how it is worded hallelujah blessed is the man whom don't choose us or give the lord i shout many are called many accord give me give me scripture but few are chosen blessed is the man whom thou chooses and causes to approach the glory of god that means listen saints you have got to come to a place where you have to approach your god there is no escaping of it oh my hallelujah let's go let's go but the branham he's speaking i think this is some studying and church see i know the blasphemy of them would say they're jews and they're not but have the synagogue of satan church folks would call them synagogue of satan here is a voice that will be a considerable thought not only because it is most peculiar in its contents but is also virtually repeated in an age that is over a thousand years later revelation 2 9 i know that works and tribulation and poverty but are rich i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are of the synagogue of satan to begin with the word jews does not describe the religion of the jewish people it refers only to the people of judah and has the same precise meaning if i were to say i am irish born these people were saying that they were actually jews real jews by birth but they were liars they were not jews by birth and they weren't jews by religion if all this is true what were they they were deceived people who already part of the church they belong to the false vine remember the last week message praise god brother isaac be not deceived so these people call themselves jews and they were liars now listen to this they were not of the true church but of the false church because god said they were the synagogue of satan now the word for synagogue is not the same word as we use for church in the bible church means the callout ones or the summoned ones and here's where he slipped this end now the psalm is said about these elect people are you ready and you know what he quote after that blessed is the man whom thou chooses and causes to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts psalm 65 4. so in other words when david was writing psalm 65 4 he was talking about you and i he was talking about the bride he was talking about the elected whom the lord chooses so you are not just drifting by chance and find yourself falling into this message no you have not chosen me jesus said but i have chosen you oh glory to god holly i'll not take you to bring forth fruit isn't that right so then he said about the meaning of synagogue is assembly or gathering this can be good or bad in this case it's bad for these were assembling is not of god but of their own selves isaiah said of them behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake isaiah 54 15 and since these were surely against the true vine god will only deal with them in destruction now why do we have a people mixed in the framework of the church and callings of jews the reason is this since they are liars they could make any claim they wish they could say what they wanted as though it were a fact and then stick to it in this case they could be lying with a very powerful thought in mind was it not so that the early church was almost if not entirely composed of jews making them original members of his body the 12 apostles were jews and later apostles were either jews or proselytes thus for men to swear they were jews would give them a preeminence and a claim to originality and listen to this bomb and we know this especially in america tell a lie stick to it never mind fact of history just say it and keep saying it to the people and soon the people will receive it i decided that america full allies troopers are ready to go there by knockers a microscope to find truth in america right now found to be very elected people they can't even get to know them all let me say it again tell a lie stick to it never mind a fact or history just say it keep saying it to the people and soon people will receive it did you cut something here isn't that the spirit right in the church today isn't there a group that claims to be original true church salvation is wrong in her don't they claim to have the keys of the kingdom that they receive from peter don't they claim that peter was the first pope that he resided in rome and there's absolutely no historical factor and even more most educated and knowing of heroes adherence believer lies satan's synagogue and if satan be your father he's the father of lies then it's not a strange thing that those synagogues are liars also oh blessed be the name of the lord blessed is the man whom thou chooses i hope this engrave in your heart and you know that you have been chosen oh glory to god when god was finished with saul he tells samuel i'll find a better man than that man oh glory to god i chose a king already go to the house at jesse and dear i will pick out one that i have chosen or give the lord a shout and god waited how much hundreds and thousands of years to find a people he could call for his namesake a gentile bride a gentile woman or give the lord a shout in the house he came unto his own his own receive him not that's the jews but as many as receive him to them give me power to become the sons of god who he for nearly called who we call it justified who is justified he has already glorified oh come on you gentile pride oh glory to god you come come come on you already let hallelujah you may be seated praise god amen notice the approach to god god has a way of approach you know if you're going to visit a king there's a way to approach a king there's a way to approach well he said now watch and there's a way to approach all things think that for a minute there's a way to approach all things normally we just see what we want to see do we want to do we wouldn't even pause to say is this the better approach could i have approached this differently i told my wife something you know discover you know somebody get offended because you get offended i mean you're right that's what people are doing you know i met your grandson let's talk about my feelings he's he's six years old i quit his feelings i think i didn't get a note at all because he could write notes when he write the note my wife asked him who the note for he said he heard his ideas he didn't commit to that note so now i get bad notes so what i'm saying is this because you get offended that means you're right i feel hurt yeah you're wrong people feel that hurt feelings make that right you didn't have to act so you didn't say it so you're gonna do it so i feel hurt hurt and you're going with your heart feeling is that right your hurt feelings your spirit are the breakup go out to wreck your human spirit [Applause] you'd rather see immensely true gentlemen [Music] i not begging for any man you know when you say amen you say lord i want that all right so watch there's approach to all things and that's why paul after paul runs through the gifts and people want gifts and tongues and whatnot he said behold i show you a more excellent way then he dropped do i speak with tongues of men and angels i have that charity do i get my body to be burned do i have all knowledge do i know on mysteries do i have all faith to move mountains without charity or nothing charity suffered long and is kind that not puffed up itself it's not easily provoked didn't get no evil rejoices nothing iniquity but we are read all things believe in all things hope in all things enjoy it all things charity never fail it will give the lord some praises oh glory to god and that's why i share with husband and wife is there a better way this has to be a better way there has to be an approach there's a right approach a wrong approach a better approach oh glory to god you want the best approach to get the results oh give the lord a shout we don't want to waste time we want to get the right results three is gonna say i don't have no long drawn out like some long mob service you're not getting that you can then come back compress you can go and listen to it digest it we have no wasted words to give you we have spoken word we have original seed we have what the tapes say jamming it in your soul oh glory to god give the lord a shout the secret is the word is in the bride god has sent a prophet for me to bring my own thoughts and ideas that's foolishness oh give the lord a shout goddess and a prophet for me to preach my own revelation that is nonsense god reject that oh hallelujah man shall not live with it alone but by every word peter proceed out of the mouth of god and the mouth of god is his prophets oh give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god i love it i love it i love it i love him i love how he call me all these years and i'm still standing praise god praise god praise god hallelujah hallelujah praise be to jesus oh glory to god you saw the message on wednesday night that was way way way in south africa over twenty hundred years ago and we still talk about ephesians we have not changed our message it's the same message we're preaching oh it will rain fire coming there's a fightful ministry yet you're gonna see adopted sons you're gonna see a prize revival you're tired don't get wary don't get tired there that wait upon the lord show you their strength oh come on now take courage oh glory to god the prison is true but the time is long hanging deer you're gonna make it oh glory to god the world is falling apart everything is falling apart war is beginning to stir once more because the green and lust of men is being activated but power is going to be activated also because there is a church promised in the last days that the short of the king will be in the camp no no preacher bring in mysteries to shout of the king with fire with power with signs with wonders with miracles oh glory to god jesus amanda approve of god not read word only but with signs and wonders oh give the lord a shout they don't like to talk about it but i will talk about it with signs and wonders a man approved of god not by the minister association man approve of god glory to god glory glory there's a way to push all things talk about dwell with the wife with wisdom there's a way to push all things hallelujah to have wisdom you have to have knowledge and understanding then they can get promoted into wisdom hallelujah they get something inside your head ask god for knowledge you don't have it ask god for it oh glory to god the lord i shout in the house people too lazy that's why they are deceived they wouldn't even listen to the message don't know if what the preacher is saying is in the word that's why they're tied up and tangled up and wrapped up in foolishness oh give the lord a shout but we're not here to deceive you we either tell you the truth like it or not the truth is we're gonna set you free [Applause] hurry to go on when god made when god made his word flesh among his people in the age of jesus at the first christmas what did the pharisees moves and all them notions said don't you even go to one of them meetings if you do you'll be excommunicated when you do it so then go do go and visit the next church but go ahead and bother with them yeah long before now before they streaming i used to talk about a church without walls because i was sitting by the power of the internet yeah since we're in the bush i was seeing it now all the ministers who are trying to block the sheep and don't go here and don't go here you have any internet while i'm saying the block the sheep listen don't burn the disease they're off the word and you keep listening to the word [Music] nobody can stop that there'll be a hunger in here that dividing them those ministers don't even know they only have be elected up to the human spirit they can't touch the seed in their soul and once the spirit began to move deceiving them god [Music] you think noah went looking for two geese two alligator two days and two days no didn't go and look for them you know them started walking you know them was hearing a call you know no and said hey twofold up where are you running come here no no i wasn't running no no goat no nothing two by two then my name has no judgment coming barman said when them animals go earthquake coming let's go and huddle in the middle then birds there's fly somewhere god have something built in waiting god why you think we're moving in this direction because something built him oh glory to god before you're getting a rapture you're going to get to approach your god [Music] so don't get fight with me i i am i need holding a raptor ticket should you get fight with me don't don't rush with me but you keep keep keep keeping my back i keeping you back there between my bed one taking one left i keep on you back i hear you from the rapture i hit him from your chair and being delivered let's continue all right now watch so what they say don't go to those meetings because you'll be exclamated when you do it don't you see how things repeated right back again listen but i'm dramatizing who is this man what school did he come from what fellowship car does he have what group does he have when's coming this man and he as he comes today like he did then we will not have this man rule over us we will not have nobody tell us what to do this is the problem right here people don't want to be told what to do they don't want christ to be the lord of their lives by the word they want the lord when they want him as lord but they want their own thoughts too they want their own ideas see watch this here we are oneness we are trainers we are presbyterian we are this we don't have to put up with it but abraham said i know you don't but you'll either take the word or perish that's all there is no other way but that and that is what holds us together god's kingdom is not a kingdom of this it's not a kingdom it's another system of this world jesus said so my kingdom is not of this world he says we are like abraham ibrahim received the word anything was contrary to the word he called it as if it wasn't and any true born child of god receives god's word i don't care what anybody says but the system speaks against it the word is true here we go are you ready god is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises [Applause] i want to this be engraved in your heart he said when you see the message the wrist is filling material i don't preach filler material much because filler material does take a lot of space you ever get a gift a big box like that and you fill a material and let us draw lighting inside there but to give it a small thing in the middle right first you had to undo the package you had to strip the thing around it the bow tie and everything else open the box then you'll pull all them things inside that you see all right it's filler material now you have to put that because the gift will make a big noise back the tongue down people lose that small thing but you put it in a big box with a small thing and you put filler material around it but the main thing is the main thing you ain't going to put this jaw and put this straw on top of your house and put it until this is the filament no you want the gift it could be a cologne it could be a broach it could be whatever a watch it could be anything but we want the main thing well the main thing is the main thing so we have to preach the main thing or give the lord some praises so i want you to know how god gonna meet you he says god is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises so is there anybody asking what you're breaching up here said bro over the speech promises that's all i'm a promised preacher what god promised i preaching once i find it i've given it to you promise to the holy ghost promise a revival promise you will not be deceived promise you wisdom and knowledge understanding promise your power oh glory to god promise victory promise every place you put your foot is yours oh give me give the lord a shout promise to adopt you position replace you oh glory to god that's what he preaches out of here i'm not preaching about dr fauci i'm not preaching united nations i'm not talking about america about england our fans doing and what pope francis doing that is his business i want to find out what jesus is doing okay the lord i shout glory to god i imported but now the church is doing oh hallelujah we have enough promise to wrestle with oh glory to god wrestle with them promises fight up with that promises amen are you ready you see if we don't read this thing you wouldn't notice these are key things god is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises outside of them promises he can't meet you because you don't cut yourself off from him that's the reason the world is falling apart that's when the message the world is falling apart so in other words you have to have a promise you must have a promise on the basis of that god could meet you when you could go to god and say god you promised a bright revival and i want what you promised god you promised me the holy ghost and i want what you promised god you promised a rain to come upon my life you promise i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you promise the angel of the lord and camp around those that fear him you you that is that a rock god with them promises and he is obligated to back up his promises because god can't lie oh give the lord a shout we aren't talking about miss and hit god can't lie hallelujah glory to god that's why when we prophesy hallelujah we can only prophesy according to revelation 10 8-11 that is in the scriptures though must prophesy again and you could only prophesy from the book if you eat the book or give the lord a shout i can't prophesy what biden would do fighting on his own oh glory to god i ain't no prophet i could only prophesy from the book concerning the bride concerning the world according to the book [Applause] but when a man has become a son a son he approach his father he just walk up to his father say father i come to visit you or see you that's his approach now to a stranger there's another approach there's an approach to god for many different things now if i was going to my father i was living and i want to approach him on a financial matter it would be a little different from another kind of approach i want to tell him how much i thought of him and so forth it's approach you have to use to meet god and when a man's sin in the beginning the garden of eden he separated himself and severed himself from all approach to god his very lifeline he was separated from his maker with no way at all of seeing him again because his sin his unbelief in trust in god had separated him here we go there's only that's the only sin there is is your sin of unbelief unbelief is your sin and the only reason today we are not where we should be it's because of our unbelief that's it it's because the miracles and things isn't in the church as it should be is because of unbelief separating us so this is the word now see and because that poor man out there is a sinning and murder and stuff in our world today all kind of disastrous things happen is because of unbelief in god that's all if we believe this is two things you either believe or believe not if you do believe then the works of righteousness follow a believer and if you do not believe the works of unrighteousness follows only thing is lying stealing tough and so forth is attributes of unbelief and long-suffering patience goodness mercies and so forth are the attributes of belief in god or faith in god but when man was cutting off there was no way to approach his only lifeline everything was cut off he was left back to approach his maker so just polishing and joining a church and reading a whole lot and knowing a lot of books and orders and so forth doesn't mean you are converted because you have an intellectual mind and that makes you have a mental conception that there's a god somewhere still you're not a christian yet until you actually become a personal in contact with christ that changes your heart and nature not personal connection with christ and you're bringing your own revelations and there's different things no no no that changes your heart and nature then you become a child of god old things pass away and all things become new brother branham never changed this teaching mystery additional mystery new mystery further mystery he never changed that a life has to be changed you could pour mystery upon unconverted people there were just no mysteries but a life change you could put mystery on that too oh give the lord a shout what do you want glory to god look at your own life is it matching with the word then you need a transformation you need something to happen to you isn't that right but then keep pressing on because it will happen to you you have a personal appointment with the supernatural oh give the lord a shout blessed is the man whom god chooses glory to god to be invited into his presence hallelujah hallelujah glory to god jesus said no man can come to me except praise god my father draw him is not right hallelujah now the way that god made for adam to approach now watch adam made himself an approach he said i got a made god so he made a thick skin leave to cover with shame and god refused that approach so adam had his own inspiration do you know he said god said i have my dogs are coming i come and i come and i come in fake leave and all dressed up adam fully dressed he said he is he who are you looking so who told he was naked i didn't give you that revelation you had a holy veil over you all the time oh come home come here wrap up show like that are you tired like that he said you know this story god refused adam approach and then god went and made an approach for adam he made adam an approach to himself and by doing that he slayed some sheep or something get some skins through the blood brought the first approach of the world for without a shed in the blood there is no remission of sins so god provided an approach there for adam in the garden of eden that through the shedding of blood of the innocent to appropriate and approach him then adam could once more come to the shed blood of the lamb to approach that was in the very beginning the gardener eden it was required blood and through the blood you have an approach to god to the blood you have access to god it's not you doing this and you stop doing that that is you and a religious beat but through the blood you have nothing you do when you do is the blood of jesus that gives you direct access oh praise god isn't that right so when jesus said you must be born again and you know share some of my wife i said everything in life have a process there is nothing without a process you said i am going to get my driver's license you don't just go and walk and have a machine and put a coin and bring on your license you work with it it doesn't work so you have an exam to sit your people should read you have to go and take some driving training then you have to go on exam to pass and then after you pass through all that process you're getting licensed cause i'm going to get a house you ain't just seeing a house i'm walking about this is my house it doesn't work so you'll be arrested you're just going to take up somebody's house you're somewhere house this is i claim it in jesus name amen that's false thing you see they get a house yeah that's right you're going to get a house sure but do you have the documents do you have the qualifications your salary could afford it but the mortgage company approved that and when you go to the process you buy the house that is your host so everything in life i'm going to get a job how do you get a job this is what i said my job i come from a job it doesn't work so you have to apply for the job they have to invite you to get give your interview and you have to pass the interview and then they give you the test and whatnot then they get a probation and then you could get a confirmation and get the permanency on the job so everything has a process there is no escape from it i'm going to be a successful farmer but you have to plant you could cut grass whole week and say a farming no you need farming grass until you put the seed on the ground to sow something and have the patience to wait for it to come to maturity to bear fruit you have no fruit to get or give the lord a shout so buckle down and get ready get ready get ready to culture the process to culturally approach to be successful oh glory to god to be overcomer to be victorious whatever capacity you're in there is a process oh give the lord some praises a lot of people don't like the process a lot of people end up lazy slutful because they don't want the process yeah but some people say um they want to open their own business they want to work for nobody they say working with itself what they're really running from is discipline because before you go for yourself you have to know what you can do and i always say this before you can lead you have to learn to follow oh glory to god before you want others to work for you you should work for somebody else then you understand the discipline and what it takes to be in the channel down there on the floor down there oh give the lord a shout so when you know the world from the bottom up when you get to the top you know it from the bottom up oh give the lord a shout that's the problem with adam adam goes let there be let there be let there be and that let there be man fell and god said i ain't sending it back so again i'm gonna bring a seed and that baby gonna grow and jesus grew and grace and knowledge because adam didn't have the character formation come on same as somebody he was just forming the image and likeness of god but jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered oh come on now same and somebody and that word image gonna be formed in you by the child of your faith oh give the lord a shout you ain't going to know raptor without that image inside of you glory to god i say you're not going in the rapture without the image form inside of you you are predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son his image is faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness that his image this being when it's completed is the servant of god in the church of god that's going in the rapture if it is not completed he is not going oh give the lord a show [Applause] do you get that do you understand what we just said here but this being this being i'm going to do with what you should go to this being when it's completed not when it starts when it's completed is the servant of god this is it here this is what have to be behind the pulpit this is the servant of god in the church of god that's called in the rapture now this measure is what ephesians 4 11 is about pastor prophet teacher evangelist the ephesians 4 ministry gonna be christ's own ministry in men some of the pastors of minnesota because of the ministry a long time this ministry that they have they figured this rival told somebody they're fightful in the body and fight for all the body the man was begging for money and peter was one of the rarest scrunton no money apostle they casted that no they're loaded but no power that is money but no power daddy crowd and people but no power but peter said wait a minute seven gold i do have but such as i have what he put in his hand not in his pocket to give him you know it was inside of him it was part of him it was resident in him oh glory to god he had it therefore you could give it you can't give what you don't have you can't release what you don't have you can't impact what you don't have come on preach back to me preach back to me come on say him and somebody i look at who it is who they think they are they can't give what they don't have he says such as i have i give rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ oh glory to god we have to have something to give our children we have to have something to give our loved ones we have to have something to give our family stop complaining blessed is the man whom don't choose us just begin to rejoice this morning that you are chosen to come into his courts to come into his house to come into his temple to come into his presence who is that the elected lady the bride she's the one to chosen to do there oh gloria they're gone so brother branham he's talking about you must be born again know the approach to this bit it's not just your muscle born again no the approach to this boot there is an approach to it and to be to approach this boot you have to go through a process just like anything that lives anything that lives again has got to die first you cannot keep your same spirit you cannot keep your same habits you cannot keep your same thoughts how many of you love your thoughts love your ways love how yes do things and say things praise god hallelujah that applies to me too you know i'm so glad i got a scripture that i share with you from permitting friday and i said back again because thinking about some intellectual idiots in my mind are going through that like that and and they come with my heart don't say that and i didn't know why i didn't call over you i'd ever even mind you know thinking about these people are so smart they're smart to like become stupid that kind of kind of you know but then i recognize that i can't see that especially with my brethren so so i asking god to help me with my own thoughts because you see if i take it too long i was because you know afterwards it does spill out you see so what you really want is god thoughts and you want to get the way god sees it see and when we begin to get that way then we get insensitive to how god thinks and feels about things you see so it's different from my own concept you see so it's a debt because i have to die i know tea of it i know what he's capable of see and god know what he's capable of to see so he said you gotta die you've got to die like he died you've got to die on on his altar abel did with islam you got to die with your lamb you got to die die to your own thinking he's hitting again so this new buddhist approach you want to get a breakthrough you want to go look what he said here he said when you want to say your one fate and virtue when you say i want to get closer to god what you are actually saying you want to grow in god say you want to grow in god god give your faith a revelation oh god draw me closer i want more of you he gave a vote to you oh god i want more of you you give your knowledge you're getting more of him you're walking towards him hallelujah until they go right up to where somebody mash your corn that's why you put barley cans underneath all the other virtues right and i said you see that one on top there you most troublesome somewhere else god always had evil people around me is that over the people at the back talking you do nothing and they come to do you oh my gosh spirits and sometimes they they hate you without a cause see no cause the only cause is no cause they don't even know why they don't like you and when they don't like it you like here it's not people when they when they turn over they turn over you know nothing you do you get them pumpkin you get them bananas you get them a basket of dish cherries berries it doesn't matter where you give them give them nothing i still don't like you take an egg you know they take it now but they still don't like you if you if you want to give them give them still praise god just give them give them some cold water keep things on top of the head be nice it doesn't matter they can't help it but the test is on you to forgive because forgiveness gives you access to where we want to go this morning oh glory to god blessed is the man whom now chooses the cause to come into his presence his presence is on top the seventh step glory to god right ready the uncommon meet the king oh glory to god you have to get up on the seventh step so sometimes your children get your problems and you wish there wasn't even your children you see all this problem selling but you see these problems within the heart you see and afterwards things becomes you know certainly all right let's continue now so jesus when he died he died till he was so dead that even his blood and water separated in his body his death was so tremendous the will of the nervous breakdown it shook it trembled until rocks fell off from the mountains what what could die like that no pope dying would do that no pastor dying would do that but when god in flesh died on the cross the earth had a nervous breakdown to know that the very spoken word of god rocks and dirt sticks and clubs trees hanging in the earth the stars the moon his very spoken word see their creator become flesh and sin poured upon him the wrath of god poured out upon him until the moon shot of his light the sun shot of his light the earth had never shaken breakdown would have the of pieces if it hadn't been the future of us and everything else and if in elements of the earth upon looking seeing what was taken place shook them to that condition what ought it to do me and you what ought our souls to do when we look and see what god did for us it was for you and me what ought to do for us continuing sin god forbid but to abstain from sin and die to sin don't you seen what sin has done sin killed him he took the penalty of sin that he might bring the righteousness of god to you and me so when the rations of god comes to us sin is dead in our mortal being yes to be born again you must go through the process of death and everything does you take a grain of corn if that corn ever expect to live again it's got to die first if the crane of wheat expects to live again it's totally impossible and all these modern creatures in the world out there you know what they're telling people god doesn't want to change you and make your difference you know god won't reveal who you always was that's a lie from the pet of hell that is lucifer himself talking no experience necessary jesus come and god god revealed it was always a son and always this year that he's saying as those who say and you are the holy ghost lying spirits still lights hallelujah you're not telling me you must be born again must tell you not to die just come and believe who you are and i'm the i and the bride b-r-i-d-e and annie i i in the bride that only a word that countries you're not sure it'd be bright you know you'll find how to get me by just now and by one spirit baptism to one body no minutes i could push you any brain no book could hold anybody you could you could balance a spoken book on your head and put one you could put seven books on your head you're not bright because you read books you're bright because you're part of that bright body oh my do you believe that praise god shall we talk about that now he said watch i'm going to say something national force put israel in homeland national force will put the church in the brooklyn churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride what say it again power of god the power of god will put the people in the bride what will put the people in right but you will put the people in the right no they are scripted for that the power of god the fightful will put the people in the bride no they don't have no fightful putting people in the bride it has the power of god to put the people in the pride could we say amen how many want to say amen to the power of god the power of god will put the people in the bride the world forces this way the world forces that way but god forces upward so we have to have an approach to the power of god we can't do like it doesn't exist we can't do like we don't want it because the promise in the last days another kind of church highly high-minded lovers of places more than lovers of god fierce incontinent despisers of those that are good have in the form of the godliness but denying what denying what denying what in the message denying the pogba they don't want no power they had the books they don't want to pour they had the tips they don't want to tell the power they are fine preachers oh glory to god the power is no longer necessary you see the power comes from god and people like false religion because man make it oh glory to god and man could maintain it he could maintain what he make oh glory to god but the power of god is different hallelujah that's why when elijah tell them fellas he said call upon all your god go first do all they want to do call let the god answer by fire then be god and then father is a customer drama you know they killed seven lambs they have all the numbers right you know all the mechanics right they cut themselves and love you let's just come and say oh you only finished yet maybe only god god went going for a rest maybe he tired maybe he's sleeping crying louder they started crying louder he's had to mock them because he know they are serving a real god oh glory to god hallelujah when elijah time he had enough when it comes to evening time from morning time they've done all their foolishness all the carrying on and even time he said listen that's enough okay nothing happening give me my chance now you say all right he sets out the dignity trench dig the trench ding dong dig dig dig dig dig dig dig dig dig dig dig dig dig they want to know why they're getting so much dig dig dig deep dig deep and then pour water pour water pour water pour water then he's had to build the altar oh glory to god you can't go anywhere without rebuilding that altar pull that out in your heart but let alter your home he build the altar we restore the altar oh glory to god i want to mash up the altar bring back the altar and when he brought back the altar the altar of prayer the altar of incense oh glory to god he cut back and brought back the altar said no the incense could go up and he always had to begin to pray father i've done all this at your name oh god and then the fire come oh glory to god and lick up the rocks and lick up the old lick up the stone lick up the wood lick up the sacrifice all the water was there then lick it up god wanted a show there's fire coming from above no man is that in this fire they don't have kerosene fire they're not pitch on fire they're going to work on fire it's fire from above what happened to their pentecost well glory to god they were in the upper room and they were dialed to themselves and all of a sudden there was a sound from heaven from heaven from heaven not some pastor walking to the pulpit a song from heaven as a russian mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and every one of them had the portion of fire are you gonna get your fire this morning do you want your fire this morning do you want your portion this morning blessed is the man whom don't choose us to approach thee oh glory to god glory to god you are called brethren glory to god you had chosen to come into presence to live in that presence this is the promise of the hour it's another land oh glory to god hallelujah my lord my lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen hallelujah glory jesus in his life was the most beautiful ever lived but he could remain that way cause oh god cause he had an anointed church to approach his holiness oh glory to god he lived a perfect life but he could remain that way hallelujah hallelujah so his life was squeezed out and the same holy ghost that was upon him is put upon the church and make him the same yesterday today and forever so when he was broken when he was beaten when he was trying to bear the cross to go to calvary and they had to help him and he's tagging he is going up there that he could be broken that the spirit could be released that you could have access to be anointed by his spirit to approach his holiness oh give the lord some praises glory to god you could walk in the church any hour you can walk into almost anyhow but praise god he had to release the anointing to anoint the church oh god to approach his holiness you mean brother over there's an approach to his holiness yes sir there is an approach to his holiness the mercy seat was guarded isn't that right hallelujah and the only way i get you that is self-will he said you come true what she kind of glory what is the shekinah glory it is god's presence and when a man a woman walking is reflecting this kind of glory he don't go to gambling dance and carry on no oh praise god hallelujah so all this blood all this anointing is the tools released for us to approach god oh hallelujah are you with me now praise god the woman she touched the hem of his garment abraham talking about the soul that spit on his face and put a torn cronkite on his head and felt no virtue so they touch him they touch him but no virtue a woman come and touch him and she got virtue and then he dropped this down it's your approach it's the attitude of what it takes and that what it is tonight dear friend it takes the attitude we i believe that we are in the presence of jesus christ what is your attitude that brings the results the mechanics is here and so is the dynamics if you can just get started god will do the rest oh give the lord a praise hallelujah when if you could get started and that's what we're fighting for all these years to get a bunch of people to be started not up today and dunk tomorrow and you're cranking up next week and next week you're struggling and you're struggling you're fighting but you want to get started and get this ball rolling oh glory to god you want to get involved in this great move of god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god i'm hitting home hallelujah halfway are talking about home stretch only 20 pages by reach 10 so we're going good all right so brother brown he's talking about this experience he had with a woman who baby that died he's talking about a little lady was trying to get in the prayer line right and the whole group of ushers her baby was dead in the afternoon and she couldn't speak spanish she could uh she couldn't speak english or something like that she said not watch she was frantic a lovely little lady weighed about 110 pounds about 28 years old i suppose she was screaming holding a dead body baby in this blanket and billy come to me and said daddy we're gonna have to do something said they haven't got enough ushers there to stop her she would climb over the top of them anything she was desperate i said to brother jackmore many of you know giacomo from shreveport i said brother jack go over and pray for the baby that will satisfy her i turned to look this way and i seen a little baby sitting smiling looking at me so right away he broke in the vision i said wait a minute i walked over to where the little one was she had it all covered over where she fell down i said bring up bring her here you see what fate does faith will take it on the back and bring it to the front so barramundi that woman carrying on they go down and pray for her but vision break so have faith pass through to heaven and heaven touch his servant break a vision for him and then she becomes from the back to the front she got first attention because her faith was so high and under the anointing of desperation heaven had to respond or give the lord some praises heaven heaven couldn't hold back and when you are desperate heaven can hold back you know heaven have to respond oh glory to god hallelujah feel the anointing here today hallelujah hallelujah praise god so i walk over to her say bring her here she begins she begins screaming padre padre it means father padre and i got her up i said the baby is dead she couldn't speak of course i laid my hands in the ponder baby and i said heavenly father is that the little one you just see just then and her baby screamed and let her a big kick and started yelling the top of his voice now brother espinoza chased that down to the doctors everything as the doctor pronounced it dead at two o'clock that afternoon this was 9 30 that night the baby is living today healthy dog in mexico because of the grace of god it's your approach to anything the lady herself was a catholic take that take that message world take that message believer take that you legalist take that [Applause] glory she was a catholic and she get a baby raised from the dead because the faith not in a catholic soul should you have a catholic soul of faith in god glory to god make that god respond so you could be passing here you could be a wrong sitter inside of here you could be methodist baptist one seal no seal half seal oh god they don't know what scene they believe it doesn't matter what you believe but if you have faith in god you can be healed this morning you can be sealed this morning you can be delivered this morning got to give you a miracle this morning hallelujah it's your approach to anything the lady yourself was a catholic that didn't mind that didn't stand in her way metadata shouldn't stand because the pentecost is having a revival let's get the christ is the main thing no matter what it is not the messenger it is the message oh my hallelujah praise be to jesus glory to martin mary he says your attitude was your approach you said if you would have been here my brother would not have died it's your attitude your approach to what's a divine working of god so when you see god begin to move change your attitude change your approach when you see the divine begin to work the spirit began to move i didn't know what the music was expecting by expecting the divine i expect in the supernatural i speak in the power i'm not expecting to be preaching preaching preaching preaching you know no i speaking 15 minutes service i half an hour service and we finish and then the holy ghost take over and the man have nothing more to say oh give the lord a shout in the house we say him for 40 years oh glory to god hallelujah but when that mighty angel one with the swept back wings one with the seventh seal step into the building i'm saying you know what i'm waiting on oh glory they've got to know if you come but anymore he is here not a spirit move till i say so okay the lord i shout you me we're going into that cycle yes we have to glory to god could we give a shout again could we give the lord a hallelujah glory to god that is where we heading for [Applause] amen amen amen listen to this now abraham was a man that god gave the promise to made a covenant absolutely unconditionally and abraham abraham see you you have your abraham seed your absolutely heirs of the promise just like abraham was now i don't mean physical seeds because they're my jews but paul said that which is jew outwardly is not a jew it is a spiritual jew inside a real spiritual jew is a man who believes god's word just like abraham believed oh glory to god not that natural jew with the black chickens of the head we don't talk about that we don't want you who believe god just like abraham did i hear the bomb now and that's the kind of church if we could get that type of church if we could get that time a group right here tonight under them kind of condition there will be a revival break in this space here where at 12 o'clock one o'clock in the morning five o'clock in the morning we'll be walking these floors in this building all night long praising the lord there will be a revival break out here the newspaper men would be standing in the door in the morning he was scattered across the world everywhere a revival broke out in angeles temple and we were saying headstone tabernacle there was something like the what day of pentecost going on god wants that god wants that i'm still reading god wants that but he can't wake his children up he can't get them to realize that you must know that is what god wants he want a revival that will shed the whole nation oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah praise god hallelujah what abraham say i'm saying us he said the same thing we believe on the lord jesus he saved us from sin and we are baptized in the name of jesus christ we bring disgrace to him if we do the things that is wrong we have to pay for that and another thing when we do that we are trying to profess one thing and do another and that's the trouble today and i think i'm saying us me and the church that the lord has let me speak to in these last hours and we believe we're in the closing time we believe that god has given us a message it's been ordained of god it's been proven of god it's been shown of god now we must come to him with reverence with love with beauty of heart and mind and soul you know the always soon arise when right among us the holy spirit will speak out like a ditto anastasia sapphira remember that allah is arriving and now remember that see god is going to dwell among his people that's not a court there's not a minister preaching for hours that is not my minister feeling mysteries that's peter saying you lied to the holy ghost you are like a man you lie to god oh give the lord some praises oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god and in type to enter into this holy place whatever i'm talking about the man come on aaron you had to be dressed a certain way a certain garment hallelujah he had to hurt because he had to offer the sacrifice isn't that right he had a head for the whole use of holies isn't that right he had to dress a certain way certain garment he had bells and pomegranate and he was walking when he walked it appeared holy holy unto the lord so all the natural things they had was type in the heavenly world hallelujah them bells are wrong abraham garment when it ringing it was a testimony the angels up there bringing holy holy holy lord god almighty so when abraham when aaron walk the bells are ringing and when you walk the bells have to be ringing too we'll give the lord a shout because we are kings and priests come on now ride with me ride with me ride with me hallelujah what was it he was approaching god having the blood of

to reestablish the washing of hands and i believe it was early in the pandemic when they would have mentioned that it's a lot more effective to wash hands as opposed to the hand sanitizers even though it is a good measure but we want to just make doubly sure that uh persons coming into the building are cleansed well enough amen and uh we then all we can all fellowship in the grace of god and safety
