[1:01:04] privilege to be in the house of God a
[1:01:07] privilege where God could speak to your
[1:01:09] heart and you could meet upon him
[1:01:11] blessed be the name of the Lord isn't he
[1:01:13] wonderful this name I wanted to read
[1:01:23] something here the book I get it from
[1:01:27] but a Sigma convention in Germany if in
[1:01:30] together I shared with you well I think
[1:01:32] it was a real blessing
[1:01:33] about what a man talking about his
[1:01:35] objective and motives to point people to
[1:01:37] Christ not to himself but a group put a
[1:01:41] point people to Christ I say you could
[1:01:43] together for me I want to get that part
[1:01:45] that quotation the objective the
[1:01:47] Convention I want to read it for you and
[1:01:48] will be a blessing to you you see the
[1:01:50] objective and motive must be right for
[1:01:53] it to happen just as you have to run the
[1:01:55] race right for you to correctly get the
[1:01:58] gold medal because they don't run the
[1:02:00] race right to be disqualified at the end
[1:02:03] of the race so this is where I come down
[1:02:06] to the purity of heart and mind and
[1:02:08] spirit
[1:02:08] you never know we're just now still
[1:02:10] waiting I'm still waitin but Obama says
[1:02:12] I'd rather be right in my spirit and
[1:02:14] wrong in my doctrine than to be right in
[1:02:19] my doctrine and wrong in my spirit that
[1:02:23] would Kooten again I rather be right in
[1:02:26] my spirit and long in my doctrine that
[1:02:30] doesn't to be right in my doctrine and
[1:02:33] wrong in my spirit
[1:02:34] you see further right spirit you could
[1:02:36] get connected to the right doctrine but
[1:02:38] if you have the wrong spirit you in
[1:02:40] trouble big time
[1:02:47] this is the inspiration for this
[1:02:49] international summer convention over 70
[1:02:52] 14th the convention aesthetically time a
[1:02:55] prayer consecration worship speaking
[1:02:57] receiving the truth in love and being
[1:02:59] filled and we filled and sealed by the
[1:03:01] Spirit of God lays and God promises
[1:03:04] since many eyewitnesses of the Ministry
[1:03:07] of Allah William Branham were known to
[1:03:08] be with the Lord is but it was Sigma the
[1:03:10] huge pastor I have in my heart to invite
[1:03:13] still living eyewitnesses of God's
[1:03:15] prophet to come and give witness
[1:03:16] personally of the presence of God and a
[1:03:19] confirmation of his word and the power
[1:03:21] of the Resurrection in Jesus Christ in
[1:03:23] this man of God and the things that
[1:03:25] personally have seen and heard you know
[1:03:28] it is our hearts desire to experience
[1:03:31] the very same presence of the
[1:03:32] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ moments I
[1:03:34] was vindicated in better balance meeting
[1:03:37] there will be what he was filled
[1:03:39] ministers and the body of Christ and
[1:03:40] minister under the holy spirit let us
[1:03:43] pray that the bright promises will be
[1:03:45] preached in such a way that the Holy
[1:03:47] Spirit may give to the hungry heart such
[1:03:49] instructions such an experience that
[1:03:52] they will know perfectly how to submit
[1:03:54] antique a whole of God's promises and
[1:03:58] how to let the world promise them
[1:04:00] through to the bone against endless
[1:04:02] nature to defeat the enemy we therefore
[1:04:06] if you gave me God said I will restore
[1:04:08] the feet again in the last days where is
[1:04:10] sending the Holy Virgin such a we upon
[1:04:13] planted wood that it will be stored
[1:04:15] there for coated invite you to this
[1:04:17] convention and please give them
[1:04:19] petitions to your brothers and sisters
[1:04:20] and especially to our young people in
[1:04:22] the church may the following quotes
[1:04:27] express the attitude and vision for this
[1:04:29] convention and this is what I want to
[1:04:30] read this is Vera Brian not for one
[1:04:33] moment do I bring a message to the
[1:04:35] people
[1:04:36] they may follow me or join my church or
[1:04:41] start some fellowship and organization I
[1:04:44] have never done that I will not do that
[1:04:48] no I have no interest in those things
[1:04:53] but I do have an interest in the things
[1:04:58] of God and people and if I can
[1:05:01] accomplish just one thing I will be
[1:05:04] satisfied the one thing is to see
[1:05:07] established a true spiritual
[1:05:11] relationship between God and men wear it
[1:05:16] men become new Christians creations in
[1:05:19] Christ film at his spirit and live
[1:05:22] according to his world I would invite
[1:05:25] lead and warn all to hear his voice at
[1:05:30] this time I mean your lives completed to
[1:05:33] him even as I trust in my heart that
[1:05:36] I've given my all to him god bless you
[1:05:39] and me his command rejoice your heart
[1:05:41] this is what about I'm speaking for the
[1:05:44] to Chileans
[1:05:44] we need a conference a universal
[1:05:49] permitting for the Church of the Living
[1:05:50] God to be called together and this is
[1:05:53] the last quote
[1:05:54] I believe it's coming to a time till
[1:05:57] when the Saints will get together like
[1:05:58] this I'm just a love spirit will sweep
[1:06:01] before the audience and every person in
[1:06:04] dear
[1:06:05] all that is wrong will be taken out it
[1:06:08] will be such a presence of the Holy
[1:06:10] Spirit
[1:06:10] and I believe it's coming a time Jesus
[1:06:13] prophecy I believe it's coming a time
[1:06:15] when God Church is going to be calling
[1:06:19] out like that does he usually by the way
[1:06:21] to use call up like that where the
[1:06:23] scenes will set together and the Holy
[1:06:27] Spirit will just come in unjust room
[1:06:31] just like it was already at Pentecost
[1:06:34] and just heal the people and raise up
[1:06:37] the people and create things are begin
[1:06:39] to see it happen it's the love of God we
[1:06:42] will be standing preaching like this
[1:06:44] talkin and just love it was settled over
[1:06:47] the buildin this is from God keeps his
[1:06:50] word
[1:06:50] that was very important for you to
[1:06:53] understand and hear God's promises
[1:06:55] because God is God if you didn't
[1:06:58] understand that God said I was gonna go
[1:07:01] deep flood was coming in all day we was
[1:07:03] gonna miss the ark you have to hear what
[1:07:06] God promised not what you feel and what
[1:07:08] you think because you could feel certain
[1:07:11] these are certain scriptures but
[1:07:12] admitted apply to your age or your time
[1:07:15] or your season suppose you feel led to
[1:07:17] apply blood right now and kill a boat
[1:07:18] Cannell a man and put the blood you feel
[1:07:21] led by the spirit that is a different
[1:07:23] spirit because that was some Moses time
[1:07:25] God word for you know is not to take
[1:07:28] blood literal blood and apply it on the
[1:07:30] doorpost so you have to find out what is
[1:07:33] your word and you get a word for your
[1:07:36] life so god bless you and thank you
[1:07:38] again we want to be praying for those
[1:07:40] meetings for what a Sigma in Germany
[1:07:43] that God will bless and we expecting
[1:07:45] work to do great things
[1:07:46] amen so many gonna pray for the meetings

[1:07:56] Jesus Christ now she does the meat

[1:08:01] not Church this is Christ's life the
[1:08:07] Bible said is right at me yourself ready
[1:08:09] so this is not one Bumpus no no it's a
[1:08:13] universal right buddy people that call
[1:08:16] to love God
[1:08:17] people that have a deep in your soul
[1:08:19] remember you didn't call yourself you
[1:08:22] are wretched miserable naked poor plain
[1:08:24] something higher than you something more
[1:08:27] powerful than you before you top a
[1:08:30] self-righteous and look come on nobody
[1:08:35] because he raised you up
[1:08:38] he's the one that raised you up do you
[1:08:41] wanna give your eyes salad you might see
[1:08:43] he did it show tunes of grace grace
[1:08:51] works works they're gonna be the grace
[1:08:54] of God and the powers I'm alone of

[1:09:04] mercy Oh hallelujah praise the name of
[1:09:08] the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:09:12] so don't call up people to walk with God
[1:09:15] alone alone it's not right not being
[1:09:19] called by a bishop or built up by being
[1:09:22] gone by Christ it is maasai kingdom that
[1:09:25] we live in where Christ is the king an
[1:09:28] antichrist spirit tries to get call the
[1:09:31] people organization the organization to
[1:09:34] organization organize them together
[1:09:36] which was never the will of God people
[1:09:39] are fuss with me because I structure
[1:09:41] hard organization it isn't the people in
[1:09:44] the I'm striking that it's that
[1:09:46] dominating spirit that makes people
[1:09:49] think we are the people and you are not
[1:09:53] that's what it does it brings I am
[1:09:57] better than you I am higher than you I'm
[1:09:58] a revelation of you I'm a powerful of
[1:10:00] you and as foolish as a designer God

[1:12:20] you can take the pass and put it behind
[1:12:23] you
[1:12:25] [Music]
[1:12:34] it appears as though we see it Moses was
[1:12:39] study in his past he never met each
[1:12:42] other because he was wanted all together
[1:12:55] to the last quiz I want to bring back to
[1:12:57] you oh praise the name of the Lord the
[1:13:01] Church of the Living God can never be
