[29:47] you sure you can do better man a so
[29:49] penis
[29:53] praise God
[29:56] so failure Bibles three portions of
[30:06] Scripture short ones Psalms 1 3 3 9
[30:10] verse 17 and 18 Psalms 40 verse 5 and
[30:14] Jeremiah 29 in verse 11 if you have sums
[30:25] 139 17 and 18
[30:28] it reads how precious are their thoughts
[30:32] unto me O God how great is the sum of
[30:37] them if I should count them they are
[30:40] more in number than the same when I
[30:45] awake I am still worthy my hallelujah
[30:53] isn't that beautiful why
[30:56] and then sounds 40 verse 5 he says many
[31:02] O Lord my God are thy wonderful works
[31:04] which is always done and I thoughts
[31:07] which are to us word they cannot be
[31:11] reckoned up in order unto thee if I
[31:15] would declare and speak of them they are
[31:18] more than can be numbered my that's the
[31:23] thoughts of God what he thinks of us
[31:26] each more than can be numbered and
[31:30] Jeremiah
[31:33] this one I like verse 11 if you have it
[31:40] Jeremiah 29 verse 11
[31:48] that's what it's easier for I know the
[31:52] thoughts that I think toward you says
[31:56] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[32:01] evil to give you an expected end can I
[32:07] read it again for I know the thoughts
[32:10] that I think toward you it's goal is
[32:14] trying to get it to see what he thinks
[32:16] of you not someone else what he thinks
[32:20] of you say the Lord thoughts of peace
[32:24] and not of evil to give you an expected
[32:29] end may God add a blessing to the
[32:31] devious world you may be seated
[32:42] so tonight I like to take a title the
[32:46] pride of Christ is God's ether eternal
[32:48] thoughts made manifest hallelujah the
[32:53] word eternal my subject you are always
[32:58] sons you did not become a son you are
[33:02] always the son and then my inspiration
[33:05] God is going to give to you an expected
[33:08] end
[33:10] [Applause]
[33:15] so tonight who is we I want to speak of
[33:19] the bride's pre-existence you come from
[33:25] you not just from here brother Isaac
[33:28] said we're not from Nigeria we're not
[33:30] from Trinidad you existed somewhere
[33:34] before and you were there some way and
[33:42] promises somehow in your human mind you
[33:44] cannot remember it but somehow God sent
[33:49] a prophet in this day and I love this he
[33:52] went so I that he broke into the mind of
[33:57] God and caught the thoughts that was in
[34:02] the mind of God and pulled it down and
[34:06] then came and revealed it to the bride
[34:11] now I have a revelation then I was
[34:15] somewhere else how did I he'd know that
[34:17] godson as a prophet would thus sayeth
[34:21] the Lord
[34:21] that wins oh hi brother that he could
[34:24] catch the thoughts of God and today when
[34:27] it's been preached that's the very mind
[34:30] of God that you sitting within your lap
[34:34] that you have in your shelves that times
[34:37] that you are listening to is the very
[34:39] mind of God so we know now what God
[34:43] fought for this day we have a revelation
[34:47] what God fought for this day brother
[34:50] hallelujah so I'm gonna do can I float
[34:54] on the quotes but he says here before it
[34:57] could be a word spoken it has to be a
[35:00] thought and because a word is the
[35:03] thought made manifest when God speaks
[35:05] now back in the beginning when God
[35:07] looked down through the corridors of
[35:09] heaven he saw all things that were going
[35:11] to happen on earth did you ever just sit
[35:14] and draw a picture in your mind an idea
[35:16] or pinion now that's the way God did
[35:19] perhaps in the beginning then he see it
[35:21] seemed good so what you know he spoke it
[35:25] and as soon as it was spoken it become a
[35:30] word the thought was expressed he's
[35:35] thought and makes it a word and he says
[35:39] once it is spoken he can never take it
[35:42] back again hallelujah brother
[35:48] so once God speaks that word that word
[35:51] can never be taken back again why it's
[35:53] already spoken Oh hallelujah The Devil's

[35:59] you but you're gonna find out God is a
[36:01] different plane for your life and for
[36:03] you and your situation uh he has
[36:06] thoughts about you that never mind what

[36:14] what they say about me I'm not gonna
[36:17] become a product or some man's opinion
[36:20] but I want to know what God thinks about
[36:22] me what God says about me what these
[36:26] thoughts about me that's what I'm
[36:28] looking and you must never become a
[36:30] product or some men's opinion never
[36:35] allow that none don't let the devil even

[37:02] says let me inject a fourteen-year even
[37:05] your natural birth is based upon the
[37:07] election now you think you think this is
[37:11] a mystery to be saved in this day and
[37:13] being a message he says your natural
[37:16] birth was based on election and it's a
[37:20] mixed audience but he says the female
[37:22] ovaries produce so many eggs but why is
[37:24] it that at the certain time a certain
[37:26] air comes down and not another one and
[37:29] then amongst the male sperm for wee-wee
[37:31] and for no known reason a certain term
[37:35] attaches itself to the egg while others
[37:38] that could have just as easily attached
[37:40] themselves or had a better opportunity
[37:42] to do so but they did not eat perish

[37:49] this otherwise what determines whether
[37:52] the baby is a boy whether it's a girl a
[37:55] blonde the brunette like that boy he

[46:12] my he says Jesus poured back his own
[46:16] listen hold us careful in mind take the
[46:21] next step Reidy means to buy back it
[46:25] restores to the original owner God by
[46:28] his death the shed blood bought back his
[46:31] own he bought back the spoken word seed
[46:34] bride my sheep hear my voice the word
[46:38] and they follow me
[46:40] you were always a sheep you were never a
[46:42] pig or a dog turned into a sheep you
[46:45] always this heap to me brother Damon I
[46:50] always was a sheep in my heart though I
[46:52] was in the Sabine's and I was in all the
[46:55] ungodly places wherever you went there
[46:58] was a seed in your heart you are never
[47:01] pretty

[47:05] brother and my sheep will hear my voice
[47:09] hallelujah hallelujah oh praise God
[47:14] [Applause]
[47:19] okay so Jesus had to pay the price to
[47:24] die he had to die and he bought back his
[47:28] own by his blood redeemed the spoken
[47:30] word see bride because Satan would have
[47:32] held it against him and against us but
[47:36] now we can point back and say about that
[47:37] day he paid the price and why did he die
[47:42] brother the brain was saying that a
[47:44] little circle and there was a hickey
[47:47] but that Hickey was when he came down
[47:50] and and to redeem us
[47:52] there's only reason he died he came
[47:56] because someone had to pay the price and
[47:59] then god looked down in the Adam's human
[48:03] race was in chaos no one could redeemer
[48:07] and God says man listen those are my
[48:10] thoughts though they were in my mind
[48:13] holiday a part of me I'm going down to
[48:17] the earth I'm gonna take on the body of
[48:19] flesh and when they nailed him to the
[48:21] cross hallelujah
[48:23] yeah and you and me on his mind and he
[48:25] paid the price brother and here we are
[48:28] tonight we are shocked in the victory we
[48:31] are praising God why we can tell the
[48:34] devil the price was paid you can point
[48:38] back Satan the price was paid the blood
[48:41] is hog accompany some of the work
[48:46] [Music]
[48:47] my mind it's time you preach back to the
[48:50] devil man say that he owned Calvary was
[48:52] for me hallelujah it was for Eamon
[48:57] Thompson it was for just in a play-doh
[48:59] it was rising over it was for you you
[49:02] put your name in there that day he died
[49:05] for me and Satan can no more put
[49:09] anything on you because that day the
[49:11] price was paid and he died to redeem
[49:13] back and he says redeem is to bring it
[49:17] back to the original owner so you're not
[49:22] in the hands of a man
[49:23] he's not in the hands of a group you
[49:25] know in the hands of any Church we are
[49:27] not your underpinner of any no we under
[49:30] the banner of Jesus Christ and you
[49:33] redeemed back to God's hands
[49:38] shake of any sport brother shake of
[49:41] anything that's hanging on you shake it
[49:43] off be like poor winter when the serpent
[49:47] put him in an honest and one important
[49:51] shook it off shake it off into the fire
[49:54] the fire God is here

[50:03] said that about me shake it off they
[50:06] said that about you shake it off
[50:10] hallelujah hallelujah come on young
[50:15] people shake it off
[50:17] [Applause]
[50:24] [Music]
[50:25] my now we can point back to the day of
[50:30] Calvary Jesus speed it all not just
[50:33] power payment but full payments full
[50:37] payments paid in full
[50:41] hallelujah paid in full my he says yea
[50:47] and brother Peter spoke of the little
[50:49] ego it says yeah but when when he heard
[50:52] the call of the great ego he came to his
[50:55] own place he was in the chicken yard
[50:57] remember but he heard mama eager and
[51:00] once a true son of God hears the cry of
[51:02] the Spirit by the word he too will
[51:06] realize who he is and run to the great
[51:09] prophet eager and be with him forever
[51:12] more seated in heavenly places in Christ
[51:14] Jesus then he says Maki Sonicare then
[51:17] after you recognized the very word of
[51:19] God was eager food then you left the
[51:23] other thing I like this man when you
[51:27] have the message you left the other
[51:29] thing you ran for your life
[51:31] you saw the false you saw they they not
[51:34] true you heard he says you recognized
[51:36] the very word was iike food then you
[51:39] left the other thing he says right there
[51:42] you heard from your theophany
[51:44] [Applause]
[51:49] remember the Raymond the day I heard it
[51:51] that was mighty awfully speaking back to
[51:53] me I heard and he pulled me out of there
[51:55] brother you better believe it
[51:57] you got your own theophany you're not
[52:00] born from some ministers day or phanie
[52:02] you're not born from no organization you
[52:05] born from your own theophany hallelujah
[52:08] the thing you bypass came and called you
[52:12] and you saw it and you learned for your
[52:14] life
[52:15] and we're still learning
[52:18] glory be to God we're learning from
[52:21] every force we running from every
[52:24] interpretation we're running by the way
[52:26] we heard from a theophany Galatians 4
[52:36] verse 47 and because he has sons God is
[52:39] sent for the spirit of his son into your
[52:41] hearts crying Abba Father
[52:43] wherefore thou are no more a servant but
[52:47] a son and I think too many of us still
[52:50] look at us as servants and Burmese is a
[52:53] servant e-e-e works and he gets his
[52:56] wages he gets his reward but it is a son
[53:03] a son is a person who's in authority
[53:10] [Music]
[53:11] because he comes from his father now we
[53:15] were always sons we come from where of
[53:18] Heavenly Father
[53:20] so we not servants when we are sons
[53:23] speak the word hallelujah
[53:26] speak the word but a son he says and if
[53:29] a son then an heir of God through Christ
[53:33] ladies Jesus Christ came for died upon
[53:35] the cross accomplished redemption
[53:37] restoring to the region only by means of
[53:39] purchase and paying the price thereby he
[53:42] placed us as sons he did not make a
[53:45] sense that's why I made my subject list
[53:47] you were always sons let's see what it
[53:51] says he did not make her sons for we
[53:54] were already his sons but he placed us
[53:57] his sons so brother you were always the
[54:00] sons sister you were always a part of
[54:02] God you didn't become the day you gave
[54:04] your heart to the Lord the day you made
[54:06] the mess you know you are always a
[54:08] Sunnah and I'm speaking to the eighth
[54:10] day people they will recognize this is
[54:13] the sons familiar manner I was somewhere
[54:16] before
[54:19] hallelujah that's why Jesus prayed in
[54:21] John 17 he says father I do not pray for
[54:24] the world but I pray for them that stay
[54:26] in the world but they not of the world
[54:28] but I pray Lord that you keep them while
[54:31] they in the world he says you at glory
[54:34] with him before the foundation of the
[54:36] world you were there
[54:40] [Music]
[54:42] hallelujah and because yes honest God I
[54:45] said for the spirit of a son into your
[54:48] hearts whereby you cry father father
[54:51] hallelujah open wounded the spirit fall
[54:53] in penico sons hoody is fallen on a
[54:56] corinth upon sons while they heard the
[54:59] word he says yeah
[55:00] what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[55:02] is the Spotted baptizing you into the
[55:04] body of Christ it is the new birth it is
[55:08] a Spirit of God coming in and falling
[55:10] you after you have repented ever heard
[55:13] the word and been baptized in water as
[55:15] an answer to good conscience towards God
[55:17] but now the Holy Spirit that's why I
[55:20] don't know who said it one of the
[55:22] minister said the question should be
[55:23] asked have you received the Holy Ghost
[55:26] since you believed and many hasn't gone
[55:33] that far they just happy to be in the
[55:35] message just happy to be in the church
[55:37] but brother we should be hungry for the
[55:40] fully of the Holy Spirit day and night
[55:44] coming in here Lord for me that's my
[55:47] desire to be anointed to be filled with
[55:50] the Holy Spirit ministers should be so
[55:52] bad and the Holy Ghost making sure the
[55:56] people brother listen man that's how
[55:58] winning this brother feels burden that's
[56:00] right this holy convocation is called
[56:02] why for the outpouring of the Holy
[56:05] Spirit upon the people young people
[56:07] you're not gonna make it out there
[56:09] without the Holy Spirit the only thing
[56:12] that will keep you he's the Holy Spirit
[56:15] hallelujah one one man has brother
[56:18] Branham he says I have two children they
[56:21] 16 and 17 he says how can I make them
[56:24] stay in the message or stay in the
[56:26] church he says there's no way they can
[56:28] make it only by the Holy Ghost Oh
[56:31] hallelujah and the Holy Ghost is here
[56:34] tonight and the Holy Ghost is in this
[56:36] meetings
[56:36] you don't walk from here without being
[56:39] Florida it will be upon your own head
[56:41] but tonight you to find out you ordained
[56:44] to receive the Holy Spirit
[56:48] hallelujah so don't be just don't just
[57:01] be satisfied with the first experience
[57:06] when I don't know pharmacy let's the man
[57:09] he says I'll take away the stony heart
[57:11] I'll give you a new heart he says and
[57:14] then I'll give you a new spirit he says
[57:16] many people must understand that they
[57:18] think they have the Holy Ghost but they
[57:20] only have a new spirit he said but then
[57:25] I put my spirit in that spirit that's
[57:28] where you gotta go brother that's why
[57:30] you were you into the Holy of Holies
[57:32] where the Holy Spirit told you I need
[57:35] you lay in a court and it places you
[57:37] right in there and phones you with the
[57:39] Holy Ghost
[57:40] [Applause]
[57:44] my let's see all that is the Splane
[57:48] showing by type like the whole Bible God
[57:50] coming together with a redeemed wife
[57:53] says yeah I pride that God had in his
[57:57] mind now watches so when it comes to the
[58:00] bride it's got to do with God it's got
[58:03] nothing to do with the minister nothing
[58:06] to do with a group got nothing to do
[58:08] with the five for what God coming
[58:15] together with a redeemed wife a bride
[58:17] that God had in his mind before the
[58:21] foundation work that was the attribute
[58:23] of God being displayed and now to make a
[58:26] character that would redeem this woman
[58:29] it had to be something greater than her
[58:32] to Redeemer
[58:34] so God is in his mind how this bride
[58:36] must look but it had to be a great the
[58:38] character so you see goddess is you
[58:43] can't go in on your own merits please
[58:45] man you can't go in on your good
[58:47] cellphone and how good I am and I know
[58:51] this has got to do with redemption and
[58:54] he's choosing so he took a greater
[58:57] character than us to redeem us he says
[59:06] if he is the Redeemer he comes to redeem
[59:10] it is to pick up that which is fallen to
[59:13] redeem back to the place where it was at
[59:16] the beginning so you use me me no profit
[59:21] centers this is the thoughts of God now
[59:23] so none will be picked up by them that
[59:26] was in the thoughts at the beginning he
[59:28] come to the dream not the cannon fodder
[59:30] that we see around professing to be
[59:32] Christians but that he come to redeem
[59:35] that was his attitude which made fresh
[59:38] and redeemable so the minute you come
[59:42] into a body of flesh you become
[59:45] redeemable that's why the Holy Spirit
[59:48] process one other coat the Holy Spirit
[59:51] follows the blood all the way from the
[59:54] book of redemption so the man that you
[59:57] born your name was in the plan section
[59:59] of the book
[1:00:00] brother that's why you're uncomfortable
[1:00:02] you'll never be happy in that condition
[1:00:04] you know why your name is in the blood
[1:00:06] section of the book and now the Holy
[1:00:08] Spirit is on your trail and he's gonna
[1:00:10] bring you to a place where you need to
[1:00:12] be that's what the Holy Ghost is here
[1:00:14] for that's why you feel condemn you
[1:00:18] ought to feel condemn that that's the
[1:00:20] Holy Spirit don't burn that down

[1:00:28] so you made flesh and redeemable so the
[1:00:31] manager came into your body you are now
[1:00:33] redeemable so the Holy Ghost goes to
[1:00:35] hunting oh I don't care where you run I
[1:00:39] don't care how are you trying to hide

[1:01:10] all those who was redeemable believed it
[1:01:12] because they were in the thoughts of God
[1:01:14] the attributes of him at the beginning

[1:01:55] love having predestinated us unto the
[1:01:58] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:02:01] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:02:03] of his will let me point out here that
[1:02:06] according to these verses Jesus Christ
[1:02:09] is doing the choosing
[1:02:15] halleluyah says got nothing to do with
[1:02:19] the minister
[1:02:20] the chosen is according to him now Jesus
[1:02:24] Christ is choosing his shoes in his own
[1:02:27] bride just the same as any man chooses
[1:02:30] their Brides today the bride today does
[1:02:33] not suddenly decide she's going to take
[1:02:35] a certain man for a husband Oh sir

[1:02:40] sentient human for his bride hallelujah
[1:02:43] he have not chosen me but I have chosen
[1:02:45] you now according to the Word of God the
[1:02:48] bride was chosen before the foundation
[1:02:50] of the world the choosing of the bride
[1:02:53] was purposed in himself brother Jesus
[1:02:56] Christ purpose in himself he's gonna
[1:02:59] choose a bride and he chose you to be
[1:03:01] holy and without blame before you mean
[1:03:04] love when did he do it brother Raymond
[1:03:06] not the night that you were born not the
[1:03:09] night you gave your heart to the Lord

[1:03:52] [Music]
[1:03:58] my
[1:04:01] so I chosen before this world what was
[1:04:03] in himself he says Ephesians 1 9 in
[1:04:06] Romans and I'm 11 it says that the
[1:04:08] purpose of God according to election
[1:04:09] might stand you can't leave it any other
[1:04:12] way the heart purpose the eternal
[1:04:14] purpose of God was to take a pride of
[1:04:16] his own choosing and that purpose was in
[1:04:19] himself and being eternal was decreed
[1:04:22] before the foundation of the world
[1:04:24] so Jesus didn't decide now I'm gonna
[1:04:28] choose a bride no he didn't decide well
[1:04:31] at this holy convocation I'm gonna
[1:04:33] choose right now he chose this bride win

[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:21] he says what's carefully now and see
[1:05:24] this before they was ever speck of
[1:05:26] Stardust though God was caught even an
[1:05:28] odd job of adoration no one was there to
[1:05:31] worship him so he was at that time only
[1:05:35] a potentially God and he was known only
[1:05:38] as the Eternal Spirit the bride was
[1:05:41] already in his mind so I'm speaking of
[1:05:45] your pre-existence oh you're not a
[1:05:52] creature of time and we're now broken
[1:05:54] into eternity we push you back up and
[1:05:58] and even a year brother says if you see
[1:06:01] this you'll see many other things if you
[1:06:06] can see that you're a part of God in his
[1:06:09] mind come to the earth for a purpose
[1:06:13] hallelujah when I see that he says you
[1:06:15] see many more other things brother
[1:06:20] my he says they known only as the
[1:06:24] turtles wouldn't the bride was already
[1:06:26] in his mind yes she was she was existing
[1:06:28] in his thoughts and what about those
[1:06:30] thoughts of God they Aeterna
[1:06:32] are they not that's what I said my title
[1:06:35] the bride is the eternal thoughts of God
[1:06:38] made manifest now the devil that that's
[1:06:44] shaking her do you think of people like
[1:06:47] this with all the mistakes they the
[1:06:49] bride yes they'd applied here that say
[1:06:53] that they are the bride this is a
[1:06:55] portion of them sitting here tonight and
[1:06:58] she's all across the world brother
[1:07:00] there's a people that's called by his
[1:07:02] name
[1:07:03] hallelujah that was in the thoughts of
[1:07:05] God they I eternal are they not the
[1:07:10] eternal thoughts of God let me ask you
[1:07:12] are the thoughts of God eternal now yes
[1:07:16] sir yes he says if you can see this you
[1:07:19] will see many other things if you can
[1:07:25] see this you'll see many other things
[1:07:28] hallelujah God is unchangeable in both
[1:07:31] essence and behavior he has never had a
[1:07:33] new thought about anything because all
[1:07:35] his thoughts he has always had and
[1:07:37] always will have and knows the end from
[1:07:40] the beginning because he's God
[1:07:42] hallelujah they are not something like a
[1:07:46] man with a blueprint he has grown up in
[1:07:49] which one day will be translated into
[1:07:51] substance and form but they are already
[1:07:54] real an eternal and a part of God so man
[1:07:59] is gonna build a house so he gets all
[1:08:01] the bricks and the food in the cement
[1:08:03] you see he still gotta put the thing
[1:08:05] together
[1:08:09] but he's got a blueprint is gonna work
[1:08:11] by and this foundation must be so deep
[1:08:14] in this raid and everything and the
[1:08:15] walls must go up in the roof trust us
[1:08:17] brother that's what he does but when God
[1:08:20] looks at this bride she's complete
[1:08:24] she's already burned up he don't see you
[1:08:27] with your mistakes and all what is wrong
[1:08:29] with you he sees you perfect brother he
[1:08:32] sees you complete hallelujah that's a
[1:08:36] god I serve man hallelujah is a party
[1:08:39] and he says yeah so I'm speaking to any
[1:08:42] people and we're looking with their with
[1:08:45] a eternal I remember now we're looking
[1:08:47] with a eternal I it's already real to
[1:08:50] God so God sees you complete he sees the
[1:08:53] building standing he sees the house
[1:08:56] already completed he already sees you as
[1:08:59] a statue of a perfect man this is you
[1:09:02] already adopted this is you already
[1:09:04] coming to your officience he sees you
[1:09:06] coming into your position he sees you
[1:09:09] perfected he sees you baptized wasn't
[1:09:12] filled with the Holy Ghost he sees you
[1:09:14] already in your in a holy convocation
[1:09:17] this is you great to free you going free
[1:09:21] in this time of Jubilee on the eighth
[1:09:23] day this is you already in that eternal
[1:09:26] city the brother of Plato spoke he
[1:09:29] already sees you there you're not a
[1:09:32] creature of time don't even ever lie to

[1:10:02] looks at you you completely separate the
[1:10:07] lumen I have so many mistakes he sees

[1:28:08] that's what we're waiting for the
[1:28:09] dynamics could it be this convention

[1:28:16] people and you don't question me a chief
[1:28:20] taken a me embrace it and tell us me
[1:28:26] hallelujah the reason I believe when the
[1:28:30] bride is called and elected and set in
[1:28:32] the book of life
[1:28:33] there will come a song from heaven that
[1:28:35] will take such a baptism of the holy
[1:28:37] spirit into their pride that it will
[1:28:39] take her from the earth in rapture in
[1:28:41] Christ God promises don't care how many
[1:28:43] signs and how many astronauts and signs
[1:28:45] are being everything else how many
[1:28:47] million miles they can see I don't care
[1:28:48] nothing about that there is a heaven and
[1:28:51] there is the little Jesus now he told us
[1:28:55] earlier there's a little pride now he
[1:28:58] says there's a little Jesus the easel
[1:29:00] heaven and there is a little Jesus
[1:29:04] hallelujah there's a little Jesus Christ
[1:29:07] that there that will come in a body form
[1:29:10] to receive his church himself no matter
[1:29:12] how old the story seems it's still the
[1:29:14] truth God said so that's what believers
[1:29:17] believe can I hear the eight they
[1:29:20] believe us
[1:29:21] hallelujah o blessed be the name of the
[1:29:25] Lord
[1:29:26] okay now we're gonna hit Jeremiah 29:11
[1:29:30] now the thought that got things we
[1:29:33] always worried what what do you think
[1:29:34] about me what does she think about me
[1:29:36] that is not got one thing what anybody
[1:29:39] thinks about you it's got nothing to do
[1:29:41] with it
[1:29:42] I'm interested what does God think about
[1:29:44] me hallelujah and if I can see that
[1:29:49] brother I'm gonna see many more things
[1:29:52] hallelujah
[1:29:54] so we're gonna hit that speck to the end
[1:29:59] [Music]
[1:30:04] my thoughts that I think toward you
[1:30:06] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:30:09] give you an expected end and when you
[1:30:12] going through the trial in through your
[1:30:13] situation you always think God is
[1:30:15] judging you but if you take that
[1:30:17] scripture it says my thoughts towards
[1:30:20] you that I think they are good and peace
[1:30:23] and they are not evil so God on the evil
[1:30:27] of his bride what man will do that
[1:30:30] brother God don't think evil of his
[1:30:32] bride
[1:30:33] [Applause]
[1:30:36] my it says what it says my thoughts that
[1:30:41] I think toward you the thoughts of peace
[1:30:43] and not of evil so we for ever thinking
[1:30:47] that when we go through a situation it's
[1:30:49] evil I must have done something wrong
[1:30:51] God is punishing me
[1:30:52] no God got you where he wants you he got
[1:30:57] you in that situation in your job well
[1:30:59] you don't know which way I do have a job

[1:31:06] to pay your rent
[1:31:07] he got your next situation not because
[1:31:10] he thinks evil but my thoughts are peace
[1:31:13] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:31:17] end hallelujah Philippians will seek
[1:31:19] been confident of this very thing that
[1:31:21] he has become a good work in you will
[1:31:24] complete it until the day of Jesus I
[1:31:29] sort of looked up expected end they say

[1:31:36] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:31:37] give me watch a future hope whoa annex
[1:31:45] so you see we were in here in-between
[1:31:48] but God is looking at the end he said
[1:31:51] I'm the first and I'm the last he's not
[1:31:53] worried what happens in between he took
[1:31:56] care of the bad end and the beginning he
[1:31:59] took care of it and yet you worried
