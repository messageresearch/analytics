[40:23] my attention to a few portions of

[40:26] revelation 12.
[40:29] um Romans 8 and psalm 119.
[40:35] in relation to all
[40:45] original verse 1 and this is speaking
[40:48] about you know the one in heaven and the
[40:51] church Israel and all of that
[40:54] and there appeared a great wander in
[40:56] heaven a woman clothed with a son and
[40:59] the moon under her feet
[41:01] and upon her head a queen of 12 Stars
[41:04] and she been with child cried travailing
[41:07] in birth and pinned to be delivered
[41:11] and they have paid another Wonder in
[41:13] heaven
[41:14] verse one says the great Wonder in
[41:16] heaven this is another Wonder in heaven
[41:18] so the focus must be on heaven
[41:21] and behold a great red dragon
[41:24] having seven heads and ten horns
[41:27] and seven crons upon his heads and his
[41:30] tail drew the third part of the stars of
[41:32] Heaven
[41:33] and did cast them to the Earth and the
[41:36] dragons stood before the woman which was
[41:38] ready to be delivered for to devour her
[41:40] child as soon as he was born
[41:44] and she brought forth a man child who
[41:46] was to rule all nations with a rod of
[41:48] iron
[41:49] and a child was cut up unto God unto his
[41:52] throne
[41:53] and the woman fled to the Wilderness
[41:55] where she had the police prepared of God
[41:58] that they they should feed her her there
[42:02] a thousand two hundred and three score
[42:04] days
[42:06] and there was a war in heaven
[42:08] Michael and his angels fought against
[42:11] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[42:14] angels and prevailed not neither was
[42:18] their place found anymore in heaven
[42:21] amen
[42:23] Romans 8
[42:31] I read from verse 28.
[42:33] and we know that all things work
[42:35] together for good to them that love God
[42:37] to them who are the call according to
[42:39] his purpose
[42:40] for whom it is for no he also did
[42:43] pedestrians to be conformed to the image
[42:45] of his son watch the order there
[42:47] for knowledge then predestination and
[42:51] the word image
[42:54] for whom he did follow verse 29 again he
[42:58] also did a predestinator to be conformed
[43:01] to the image of his son that he might be
[43:03] the firstborn among many Brethren
[43:06] moreover whom it predestinate them he
[43:10] also called and whom he called them he
[43:13] also Justified and only Justified then
[43:16] he also glorify So when you say you are
[43:19] predestinated verse 30 is explained to
[43:22] you breaking down for you what your
[43:23] predestination means in your
[43:26] predestination you are called in your
[43:29] predestination you are justified in your
[43:31] destination you are glorified and that
[43:34] takes in your Justified Sanctified
[43:36] baptized the Holy Ghost and glorified
[43:38] and glorified is the adoption time amen
[43:42] amen and verse 31 what shall we then say
[43:46] to these things if God be for us
[43:49] who can be against us
[43:52] amen Psalm 119 verse 89.

[45:33] and I also want to you know agree to all
[45:35] these ministers and the churches that
[45:37] are here the pastors missions that are
[45:40] here and to say it's good to be together
[45:42] again to fellowship with you all one
[45:46] more time Under The Canopy of Malachi
[45:48] first message from the back of the Bible
[45:51] God should bless you and it's good to be
[45:53] with you again amen
[45:55] so anyway
[45:57] um
[45:58] um brother Branham
[46:00] um our Prophet came with a message and a
[46:03] message that opened up the entire uh
[46:07] Book of Life
[46:08] amen like brother Tamara was talking
[46:10] about this morning and brother Branham
[46:12] had a Ministry and a message to open up
[46:15] the entire book
[46:17] amen so I know these days you know a lot
[46:20] of us in the message are not quite
[46:22] satisfied with the message and we feel
[46:24] there's so many L's out there to go look
[46:27] for and then we look at this and look at
[46:30] that and look at this and look at that
[46:32] but Frankly Speaking I mean it's fine I
[46:34] mean if that's the way you feel that's
[46:36] fine but God sent us a prophet
[46:39] a man who had a Ministry to go into the
[46:42] prince of God
[46:44] to bring down the word of God because
[46:46] God is not abortioning his word now he's
[46:50] not deciding like okay this is what I'm
[46:52] going to do now the Bible said forever
[46:54] oh Lord that what is settled in heaven
[46:57] amen is settled John finished done
[47:00] finished work
[47:02] can I hear an amen
[47:04] amen amen so our faith our our Christian
[47:09] faith tonight is based upon a word
[47:12] that's already settled in heaven it's
[47:15] not going to be it already happened amen
[47:18] can you say Amen
[47:19] it already happened way back amen
[47:23] already happened amen
[47:26] now brother Branham
[47:28] I had a Ministry to go into the praise
[47:30] of God
[47:31] because he said a prophet is only a gift
[47:33] of knowledge and what is the gift of
[47:36] knowledge to go into the prayers of God
[47:37] and see what God has said for All Time
[47:40] and Eternity and bring it back down
[47:42] I will embraham went before the
[47:44] finishing of the world and brought the
[47:45] water got down for you and I the one
[47:48] that got apportioned for all-time and
[47:50] Eternity whether we believe it or we
[47:52] don't believe it God's word will come to
[47:54] pass exactly as God said it will be
[47:57] so God don't need us he don't need me he
[48:00] don't need you he don't need any man he
[48:03] is God all by himself he don't need you
[48:05] and not to be God he's God without you
[48:08] without me but we thank God to be part
[48:11] of his economy can you say Amen
[48:13] [Applause]
[48:15] amen amen
[48:20] you appreciate it
[48:26] this is the book
[48:29] that was reading before the foundation
[48:31] of the world forever O Lord thy who
[48:34] already said in heaven this is the word
[48:35] of God settled before the foundation of
[48:37] the world
[48:40] everything's written nothing has been
[48:43] added to it nothing has been taken away
[48:45] from it settle in heaven and we can rest
[48:48] our souls on that how I cannot fail will
[48:51] not fail is not about to fail can never
[48:54] fail amen amen
[48:57] amen and you know the story amen William
[49:02] Branham
[49:03] uh uh um it has this good question maybe
[49:07] I should read the quote to you so you
[49:08] know brother Matthew said he said when
[49:10] was this book of Revelation ever wrote
[49:13] amen
[49:14] [Applause]
[49:16] um excuse me
[49:26] on the Revelation book of symbols but
[49:28] from cried out now when was this book of
[49:32] Revelation ever wrote the first place it
[49:36] was wrought before the foundation of the
[49:39] world never mind the English this is
[49:40] King's English not Queens English King's
[49:43] English in the first place it was wrote
[49:45] before The Phoenician of the world and
[49:48] John only by the Spirit-filled heart
[49:51] and soon in Branham this word of God
[49:54] that was written settled before the
[49:56] fashion of the world Amen everybody else
[49:58] is preaching on these Realms here but if
[50:01] the word was before the profession of
[50:03] the world so a man has got to be here a
[50:05] minister or someone has to be here to
[50:07] have the ministry to go before the
[50:09] foundation of the world and bring down
[50:11] that Revelation to you and I and that's
[50:14] the way William Branham
[50:15] but it gets so common to us in the
[50:18] message till we're busy ourselves with
[50:20] nonsense you maybe say that you may be
[50:22] seated all right
[50:26] amen amen so let's go on a journey to
[50:31] now with William Branham into the
[50:33] pictures of the Bible
[50:35] and see this word
[50:37] that was wrote before definition of the
[50:39] world then you'll find your place in the
[50:42] Lamb's Book of Life and you'll know the
[50:44] devil don't even stand a chance between
[50:47] you and Satan no contest
[50:50] no contest because you never did in the
[50:54] first place
[50:55] do you realize you maybe see that do you
[50:58] realize the devil the devil's power over
[51:01] you is because he can accuse you but if
[51:05] you ever lose that power of accusation
[51:08] over you the devil will be totally
[51:09] paralyzed before you
[51:11] and I tell you tonight you'll never deal
[51:14] in the first place
[51:15] Hallelujah not guilty because you never
[51:19] did in the first place not forgiven
[51:21] Justified you never did it in the first
[51:25] place and I'm gonna show you tonight how
[51:28] you'll never be in the first place sure
[51:30] you'll go out of this convention by the
[51:33] time we finish tomorrow night looking
[51:34] for every devil every accusing devil
[51:37] Hallelujah
[51:39] you'll tell the devil Hallelujah I went
[51:42] to a convention over the weekend and I
[51:44] found out the secret you are a liar I
[51:47] never did it in the first place
[51:52] amen
[51:56] [Applause]
[52:01] you maybe see that
[52:02] [Music]
[52:05] so the world was telling me heaven
[52:09] but foreign
[52:12] The Book of Revelation The Book of Life
[52:14] was written before the foundation of the
[52:17] world
[52:19] but you and I know before it became the
[52:22] word
[52:24] it wasn't always word before he became
[52:26] the word America you want to hear these
[52:29] things from Kenneth Hagin or Roberts at
[52:32] the boy you don't hear it from them it's
[52:34] not given to them to understand that but
[52:36] before I became the word
[52:39] the word is set in heaven but before he
[52:41] became the word it was spirit
[52:44] Elohim
[52:45] [Applause]
[52:50] but for the beginning
[52:52] amen maybe see that before the beginning
[52:55] before I became the world it was the
[52:58] spirit Eli Elohim seven perfect Spirits
[53:03] with his seven company names dwelling
[53:05] all by himself and on the back part of
[53:08] his mind there he was on the back part
[53:11] of his mind and we always talk about the
[53:13] back part of his mind and on the back
[53:15] part of his mind there he was with his
[53:17] attributes and you are an attribute son
[53:20] of the spirit that was the spirit and
[53:23] you were there not in flesh like this
[53:25] you are there as a thought it is
[53:28] thinking you are there before the devil
[53:31] ever was created you were there
[53:35] thinking
[53:36] let me see that
[53:38] [Applause]
[53:44] sure I know you know that but let's just
[53:47] follow our story tonight amen you maybe
[53:49] see that
[53:51] amen you are there in his thinking but
[53:54] for the foundation of the world and it
[53:56] is thinking on the back part of his mind
[53:58] we were all there and there was God his
[54:01] great attributes was there in him in his
[54:04] thinking but if you if it was really
[54:06] truly God which he was truly and is
[54:09] still really truly got tonight he's got
[54:11] to know everything so it is thinking on
[54:14] the back part of his mind he needed to
[54:16] know everything he never know what was
[54:17] going to take place in the world I was
[54:19] going to create he had to take away
[54:21] what's going to happen in the future you
[54:22] need to know every bird every animal
[54:25] every fly that will ever be on the face
[54:27] of this Earth You need to know every sin
[54:30] every wrong that would ever take place
[54:32] only Praise of these are there
[54:33] Hallelujah who are there with us in his
[54:35] thinking no while they're with us on the
[54:38] back side no we were we were elected on
[54:42] the back part of elohim's behind all
[54:45] they feel that was going to take place
[54:46] before I mean are going to take place in
[54:48] the world coming on was not on the back
[54:50] part of is mine
[54:52] you maybe see that
[54:54] so here's the point here before the
[54:57] beginning while Elohim was there if he
[54:59] had to be God he had to know everything
[55:01] so on the back part of his mind there
[55:03] you were and he had another path called
[55:06] the foreign knowledge called the front
[55:08] part of his mind we talk about the bad
[55:10] part but that was the front part of his
[55:12] mind the Bible doesn't call it from her
[55:14] but he causes the fore knowledge the
[55:17] former like not that's not him just to
[55:19] know he just knew what was going to
[55:21] happen that wasn't him he just knew the
[55:23] devil was going to deceive Adam I mean
[55:25] even he got no vegan he knew the devil
[55:26] is going to cause trouble his father
[55:28] just knew that he just knew that was
[55:30] going to happen so that's why you call
[55:32] them for knowledge which is the front
[55:34] part of his mind but on the back part
[55:36] you are but the front part knew
[55:38] everything every wrong every right every
[55:41] filthiness that was going to take prison
[55:43] on the first of the Earth but on the
[55:45] back path there you were
[55:47] chopped away and Elohim is thinking
[55:50] before the foundation of the world and
[55:52] the devil couldn't touch her
[55:54] amen you'll receive their Glory
[55:59] amen hallelujah
[56:02] [Applause]
[56:02] [Music]
[56:05] so before the beginning that was the
[56:07] Elohim
[56:08] with his backpack and his foreign
[56:17] [Music]
[56:26] every evil thing every good thing every
[56:29] great thing the U.S elections Nigerian
[56:31] elections Nigerian economy you could see
[56:33] everything but that was not him what was
[56:37] on the back path that was him are you
[56:39] with me tonight are you following our
[56:42] story tonight
[56:44] Hallelujah so you can rightly divide the
[56:47] word of God when the Devil comes and
[56:49] knocking you will tell the devil I know
[56:52] that I know that I know you ain't
[56:54] fooling around with me glory to God I
[56:57] know who I am I come from the back part
[56:59] of elohim's mind
[57:02] you maybe see the glory
[57:04] glory glory to God Amen
[57:10] so just take a mental picture
[57:13] just give mental picture I don't belong
[57:15] with you I promise you that took him
[57:17] into a picture and say hello him
[57:19] here he was part of his mind
[57:22] in a safe part of his mind
[57:25] here he was his attributes to be a God
[57:28] to be a savior to be to be a father to
[57:31] be to be a Healer to be a deliverer on
[57:33] the back of who he was and there were
[57:35] attribute Sons Sons of the sons who had
[57:37] his attributes on the inside of them on
[57:39] the back part of his mind but also
[57:41] before the beginning he also knew
[57:43] everything that was going to take place
[57:45] on this Earth here in the universe
[57:50] he knew every single time they were
[57:52] going to take his name in vain
[57:54] from eating right down to the end of the
[57:57] world he knew all that
[57:59] amen
[58:01] and then in the beginning
[58:03] hemorphated himself and became
[58:07] the logos let me see that
[58:12] [Applause]
[58:14] [Music]
[58:15] [Applause]
[58:23] became the logos
[58:25] and all that was in Elohim
[58:29] came into the logos
[58:32] nor is now
[58:33] all the attributes that was in him
[58:37] came into the logos
[58:38] and in the logos
[58:41] the front pad was also displayed there
[58:43] the four knowledge was also displayed
[58:44] there
[58:45] amen
[58:47] we come from the backpacks but in the
[58:49] logos when he poured all of himself to
[58:52] begin to begin to start this work
[58:55] to come to the Earth to demonstrate and
[58:57] manifest you and I in the logos here he
[59:00] was everything on the back part of his
[59:02] mind he was going to start making them
[59:04] come to pass now and at the same time
[59:06] all the things that you saw in the
[59:08] foreign was going to begin to take place
[59:10] amen so what happened when he unmoved
[59:14] and became the logos
[59:16] he quitted angels and angels watching
[59:19] him for aliens that means millions and
[59:21] millions and millions of years because
[59:23] they don't count time in heaven like we
[59:24] don't have here Angels just worshiped
[59:26] him and worship them and washing them
[59:28] and worship him
[59:31] until an angel had another idea
[59:35] a ninja collusive I had another idea
[59:38] and there was war in heaven
[59:41] we don't start a fight but we never run
[59:44] away from a fight
[59:45] amen
[59:46] [Applause]
[59:49] and God
[59:51] represented by the uh Archangel Michael
[59:55] amen there he was
[59:58] and his angels fought
[1:00:00] and Revelation 12 lets us understand and
[1:00:02] know that one thought of the Angels were
[1:00:05] deceived to come and rise up against
[1:00:08] Michael and his kingdom
[1:00:10] and two in other words one thought rose
[1:00:13] up in other words there were two
[1:00:14] thoughts there is no side with Lucifer
[1:00:16] can you get the math are you with me one
[1:00:20] thought one thought were deceived
[1:00:22] meaning two thoughts were not deceived
[1:00:24] what it simply means is giving into it
[1:00:26] it wasn't one-third number it was given
[1:00:28] to three parts there were three parts
[1:00:29] here one part what you see and two parts
[1:00:32] were not deceived that's why I was
[1:00:34] telling you it's not a numerical one
[1:00:36] through 100 and that's not what he's
[1:00:38] talking about there were three parts
[1:00:40] here
[1:00:44] and Michael fought and Lucifer fraud
[1:00:47] Michael fought and Lucifer fraud and
[1:00:50] when Lucifer his place could not be
[1:00:52] found anymore in heaven he was kicked
[1:00:54] out of heaven and his angels
[1:00:57] and then after the war in heaven
[1:01:01] then at that time
[1:01:03] The Book of Life was expressed all
[1:01:07] written in heaven forever oh Lord
[1:01:11] Thy word is settle in heaven so in this
[1:01:14] book of life here you have a record of
[1:01:16] events that took place before the finish
[1:01:19] of the war in elohim's mind on the back
[1:01:21] part of his mind you have a record on
[1:01:23] what the prison is for knowledge
[1:01:26] and then you have a record of what took
[1:01:27] place in the beginning the war in heaven
[1:01:31] all that will take place on the face of
[1:01:34] the Earth was previewed in heaven before
[1:01:37] the foundation of the world so we are
[1:01:39] here in the finished work we are here to
[1:01:42] finish work oh Hallelujah
[1:01:45] glory to God Amen and we know tonight
[1:01:49] we're not neither Devil Couldn't deceive
[1:01:52] Us in heaven he can't do it right here

[1:01:59] no I'm not hearing you
[1:02:02] [Applause]
[1:02:05] I said I am not hearing you
[1:02:07] the Devil Couldn't deceive Us in heaven
[1:02:09] he can't deceive us here now
[1:02:14] we were not in the foreknowledge we were
[1:02:17] in the backpacks of his mind you maybe
[1:02:19] see the glory glory

[1:02:42] [Applause]
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:45] I try to show you the whole picture
[1:02:48] but for the definition of the world
[1:02:49] Elohim part of his mind for knowledge
[1:02:52] for knowledge knows who was going to
[1:02:53] take it or he's going to accept he's not
[1:02:55] going to accept it
[1:02:56] I'd say he's gonna be on the face of the
[1:02:57] Earth everything that's going to happen
[1:02:58] every time a cow will pass on this
[1:03:01] street here every time people will come
[1:03:03] into this another Hall he saw all of
[1:03:04] them but that's not who he is just the
[1:03:07] ability to know his phone knowledge let
[1:03:09] him know that
[1:03:12] [Applause]
[1:03:15] and then he came into the beginning and
[1:03:19] there was hell on him become the logos
[1:03:22] and in the logos was the backpacks and
[1:03:26] the foreknowledge
[1:03:28] expressed in the beginning as the logos
[1:03:30] which is the word
[1:03:32] which was expressed and and forever
[1:03:34] settled in heaven
[1:03:35] [Applause]
[1:03:36] the word was inside on Heaven before I
[1:03:38] became the word
[1:03:42] and then the logos began to do the work
[1:03:44] of creation
[1:03:45] the work of creation and all that was
[1:03:47] going to take place on the other side to
[1:03:49] play out try to play out send it to a
[1:03:51] play out send it to a play out
[1:03:53] and then Lucifer came
[1:03:55] and fought against the plan on the
[1:03:58] program of God
[1:04:00] and God fought back
[1:04:02] he didn't start a fight but go far back
[1:04:05] for the devil back don't don't scream
[1:04:07] away from the devil he stood flat-footed
[1:04:10] and fought back
[1:04:13] and Lucifer isn't going to give up just
[1:04:15] because you fight back he's gonna fight
[1:04:17] you he wants to be sure you know what
[1:04:19] you're talking about
[1:04:20] amen and when he couldn't do he could
[1:04:24] overcome he was kicked out of heaven
[1:04:27] and when was Kingdom of Heaven
[1:04:29] there was peace in heaven now then at
[1:04:31] that time The Book of Life
[1:04:34] because Revelation was written or
[1:04:36] expressed or settle in heaven forever O
[1:04:41] Lord and that's why this book contains a
[1:04:44] record of everything that took place in
[1:04:46] elohim's mind the foreknowledge the back
[1:04:49] path that's why this book contains
[1:04:51] everything that took place in the
[1:04:52] beginning Michael Lucifer Angels created
[1:04:56] universe everything there this book
[1:04:58] contains it Loose if I kick down this
[1:05:01] book contains it but he had to take a
[1:05:03] 20th century Prophet to go before the

[1:09:13] first one among many presidents moreover
[1:09:17] human just never study then he also
[1:09:21] called and whom he called them he also

[1:36:06] Earth and we call that the Lamb's Book
[1:36:09] of Life

[1:36:12] and these two books wine elohim's mind
[1:36:16] and Elohim on Moffett and became the
[1:36:18] logos and we saw these two books begin
[1:36:20] to play out
[1:36:22] so the Lamb's Book began to play out
[1:36:24] hell on him his arteries coming forth
[1:36:26] began to create made Angels created
[1:36:30] angels Gonna Worship Him and became an
[1:36:32] object of worship and then from there
[1:36:33] amen angels watching for a long time
[1:36:36] and then Lucifer and his angels came
[1:36:39] against
[1:36:40] all life
[1:36:41] The Book of Life versus
[1:36:43] the Lamb's Book are you with me
[1:36:47] that's what's always been
[1:36:49] the force anointed the true seat of the
[1:36:51] word of the word of God that's where

[1:36:55] don't want to get into that amen
[1:36:57] oh my mama

[1:37:09] last book of life where he elected you
[1:37:12] and I and put our names in Splash our
[1:37:14] names in Blood and then when he created
[1:37:17] angels those angels represented you and
[1:37:19] I and then Lucifer came
[1:37:23] the dragon came
[1:37:25] to come against that
[1:37:27] and that's been the story of the world
[1:37:29] playing out kept coming against that in
[1:37:32] the Book of Life all these fights and
[1:37:34] things don't take place in the Lamb's
[1:37:35] Book of Life
[1:37:36] is in the Book of Life

[1:38:23] our closing about 10 15 minutes you
[1:38:25] never see that
[1:38:27] so what happened Elohim
[1:38:30] Michael logos
[1:38:33] fought Lucifer fought Michael fought and
[1:38:37] Lucifer foot Michael foot and Lucifer
[1:38:38] Ford and one is so I could not Prevail
[1:38:40] he was cast out of heaven and I said
[1:38:42] after that the book of life was
[1:38:44] expressed and in The Book of Life
[1:38:46] were two books
[1:38:48] The Book of Life and the lambsuka life
[1:38:51] they turn us to our section A record of
[1:38:54] every name on the face of the Earth and
[1:38:56] also a record of all those special names
[1:38:58] on elohim's mind before the foundation
[1:39:01] of the world
[1:39:02] amen
[1:39:06] and what are these four parts here
[1:39:09] one part the internal section that's you
[1:39:13] coming from the back part of elohim's
[1:39:15] mind that's one patch where you are
[1:39:17] Justified where the blood of Jesus
[1:39:19] Christ is sprinkled on you where the
[1:39:21] blood of the Lamb is pickled on you and
[1:39:23] the devil couldn't touch you that's why
[1:39:25] he couldn't deceive you with those tail
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:29] that's one part of The Book of Life
[1:39:34] another one part was this believed
[1:39:38] one power was received
[1:39:41] so there's another path
[1:39:46] brother Benham said
[1:39:47] there are four parts of the Book of Life
[1:39:49] number one
[1:39:51] Eternal section number two is the
[1:39:53] foolish virgins
[1:39:56] and number three is the borderline
[1:39:58] Believers the Judas group amen the
[1:40:01] Balaam group who had their names taken
[1:40:04] out of the book who are their names
[1:40:05] taken out of the book in other words
[1:40:07] they were deceived by Lucifer and they
[1:40:09] were cast out of heaven
[1:40:12] and their names were not found in the
[1:40:14] book anymore they were there they were
[1:40:16] there they were there in the beginning
[1:40:18] they were there in the book
[1:40:26] when the what of God came into being in
[1:40:29] heaven they were there
[1:40:32] and then listen to Lucifer
[1:40:34] who deceived them and because of our
[1:40:37] deceived that they were taken out and
[1:40:39] their place their names was not found
[1:40:42] any more in heaven
[1:40:45] that's the borderline believers
[1:40:48] but there's this other group also
[1:40:54] who did not fall for Lucifer's lies
[1:40:59] and they are not the bride
[1:41:01] they don't come from the Battle of
[1:41:03] elohim's mind yet they did not fall for
[1:41:05] Lucifer's lies oh I don't know if you
[1:41:07] are getting me amen one thought fell for
[1:41:10] Elizabeth's lies one thought came from
[1:41:12] the back of the battle of his mind but
[1:41:13] there's a path also that didn't come
[1:41:15] from Elohim is back part of his mind but
[1:41:17] not for police first lives where's
[1:41:19] brother Brian I'm getting these things
[1:41:20] from this is where he's coming from
[1:41:22] because as another group amen the
[1:41:25] foolish virgins remember see that you
[1:41:27] never see that
[1:41:27] [Applause]
[1:41:30] foreign
[1:41:33] [Applause]
[1:41:39] s
[1:41:43] they're not bright
[1:41:45] but they're not one of them Believers
[1:41:46] either
[1:41:48] and that's why it's wrong for you and
[1:41:49] how many times just condemn Pentecostals
[1:41:51] they're demons their feelings they're
[1:41:52] all that stuff look listen welcome to
[1:41:54] the focus This Book of Life here number
[1:41:56] one the prayer Eternal section number
[1:41:58] two the foolish virgins amen they never
[1:42:01] had a knowledge of the truth
[1:42:03] they never have the truth preaching them
[1:42:05] they were deceived by all the big
[1:42:06] Pentecostal shots
[1:42:08] but minister with signs and wonders and
[1:42:10] miracles amen they never had a chance to
[1:42:13] have the real true gospel but many of
[1:42:15] them in their hearts they want to please
[1:42:17] God
[1:42:18] Hallelujah they not have oil in their
[1:42:21] lambs because they do not have the word
[1:42:23] of the Living God the lamb is the word
[1:42:25] of God the message of the hour they did
[1:42:27] not have that
[1:42:28] but God who is rich in Mercy is going to

[1:43:16] a record at all that's your four parts
[1:43:19] of the Book of Life

[1:44:15] Lucifer's intention
[1:44:18] in the wine heaven
[1:44:20] Romans 12 tells us
[1:44:23] it was to come against
[1:44:25] The Man Child he stayed upon that woman
[1:44:28] to make sure the monkey doesn't come
[1:44:31] alive doesn't get born
[1:44:36] who is The Man Child Adam
[1:44:39] because God
[1:44:41] created Adam from Adam in the Garden of
[1:44:44] Eden and Adam was a man-child
[1:44:46] there was a man who was a child he was
[1:44:49] born in Manchester like the woman in
[1:44:51] version 12. and a man child represents
[1:44:54] an adopted glorified Son of God that's
[1:44:56] changed on the beauty of his Holiness
[1:44:58] another devil that's what the devil is
[1:45:00] after that's why devil is afraid for
[1:45:02] that's what devil is standing against
[1:45:03] devil doesn't care what you do the devil
[1:45:06] is to make sure that bride doesn't come
[1:45:10] to this turtle
[1:45:12] although fullness of Jesus Christ
[1:45:16] well God is determined he's going to
[1:45:19] have a bride
[1:45:20] oh he's going to have a perfect bride
[1:45:22] and that's why amen God tonight amen as
[1:45:27] long as you come to God you'll give your
[1:45:29] heart and love to Jesus Christ amen you
[1:45:32] come to him he repentance of your sins

[1:45:37] did every filthiness every young
[1:45:39] godliness every sin he wipes it out in
[1:45:43] the sea of his forgetfulness because you
[1:45:45] never did in the first place
[1:45:47] I am in your ignorance the devil
[1:45:49] deceived you but you'll never in the
[1:45:51] first place and he cancels out that book
[1:45:54] and has another record of you a new
[1:45:57] record of you Amen on the back part of
[1:46:00] his mind that's your recording now that

[1:46:42] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:46:44] Adam was manifested in the Garden of
[1:46:47] Eden he was from the Son of God
[1:46:50] but he needed to have the what image and
[1:46:52] not into his flesh
