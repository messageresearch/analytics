[23:45] it
[23:46] whether there be prophecies they shall
[23:47] fail whether there be tongues they shall
[23:49] cease whether there be knowledge it
[23:50] shall finish away for we know in part
[23:52] and we prophesy in part
[23:54] but when that which is perfect is come
[23:57] then that which is in part shall be done
[24:00] away
[24:00] when i was a child speak like a child
[24:02] understood as a child i thought as a
[24:04] child but when i became a man i put away

[24:12] know in part but then shall i know even
[24:15] as also i am known now abided faith hope

[24:21] these is charity let's continue follow

[24:27] first peter chapter 2
[24:29] i want to read from verse 4.
[24:37] to homecoming also as a living stone
[24:40] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[24:42] god and precious
[24:44] ye also here's the description as lively
[24:47] stones not dead ones
[24:49] i built up a spiritual house a holy
[24:51] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[24:52] sacrifices
[24:54] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[24:56] wherefore also it is contained in the
[24:58] scripture behold elaine zane
[25:01] achieve cornerstone elect precious he
[25:03] that believeth on him shall not be
[25:05] confounded unto you therefore which
[25:07] believe he is precious but unto them
[25:09] would be disobedient the stone which the
[25:11] builders
[25:12] disallowed the same is made head of the
[25:15] corner stone of stumbling
[25:17] rock of offense even to them which
[25:18] stumbled at the word
[25:20] being disobedient where unto they were
[25:23] appointed
[25:24] but yeah chosen generation the royal
[25:27] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[25:29] people that you should show forth the
[25:31] praises of him who had called you out of
[25:34] darkness into his marvelous light
[25:37] which in time past were not a people but
[25:39] are now the people of god which had not
[25:42] obtained mercy but now have obtained
[25:44] mercy daily beloved i beseech you as
[25:47] strangers and pilgrims abstain from
[25:49] fleshly lust which war against the soul
[25:52] let's pray once more father we love you
[25:54] and we thank you for your word
[25:56] feed us
[25:57] lord with your the bread of life break
[25:59] the bread of life unto us this morning
[26:02] lord may the people be strengthening the
[26:04] inner man may the love of god vibrate
[26:07] through this building here take all the
[26:08] evil out lord take all the unbelief out
[26:11] father i may a revival fire break into
[26:14] every soul here in jesus name i ask and
[26:17] if they are sicken or misheal them if
[26:19] they are bonding on its freedom if their
[26:21] backsliders and omits restore them if
[26:23] they are sinners and omits save them in
[26:26] jesus we ask it amen and amen as you
[26:29] stake your seed give the lord some
[26:30] praises
[26:32] [Applause]
[26:45] our title
[26:47] follow after charity
[26:50] i amen
[26:51] an inspiration charity
[26:53] never feel it
[26:55] follow after charity and that word
[26:57] and amplified is to eagerly pursue
[27:01] and seek to acquire this love
[27:04] make it your aim or your great quest
[27:08] pursue it
[27:10] go after it
[27:12] press towards it
[27:14] make that effort
[27:16] so just to connect back to last week's
[27:19] service we read the scripture from 1st
[27:21] peter 4 8 and above all things have
[27:23] fulfilled charity among yourselves
[27:26] for charity shall cover
[27:27] a multitude of sins colossians 3
[27:31] above all these things put on charity
[27:33] which is the bond of perfectness
[27:36] and where we got that inspiration from
[27:39] uh it was god by second corinthians 5 it
[27:41] was god personally present in christ
[27:44] reconciling and restoring the world to
[27:46] fever with himself not counting up and
[27:49] holding against men their trespasses
[27:52] but canceling them and committing to us
[27:55] the message of reconciliation or
[27:57] restoration to fever
[27:59] so what purpose this morning is that
[28:01] each one of you
[28:02] will be restored into favor with god
[28:06] that's why we are here we are here to be
[28:08] restored
[28:09] in the favor
[28:11] with god
[28:12] when man fell we fell out of favor with
[28:15] god and god put angels to guard the tree
[28:17] in the garden of eden that man in that
[28:19] fallen condition wouldn't partake of
[28:21] that tree of life
[28:22] isn't that right but when jesus came he
[28:25] bring the bring the connection it come
[28:28] like your phone get cut and what jesus
[28:30] came he come to restore the phone line
[28:33] that you're gonna have access to your
[28:34] father
[28:35] so when he died he paid a price to
[28:37] reconnect you
[28:39] into heavenly places
[28:40] to reconnect you into your sonship into
[28:42] a godship to reconnect you with your
[28:45] inheritance because adam lost it adam
[28:47] forfeited it and god wants to reconnect
[28:49] his people because it belongs to you
[28:52] the devil can't own it his hand is too
[28:54] greasy and filthy
[28:56] to own this inheritance it belongs to
[28:59] our the sons of god
[29:01] so we have to come to a place to
[29:02] recognize what is our redemptive rights
[29:05] because the devil can't interfere with
[29:07] it and you can't partake of it if you
[29:08] don't know it's yours
[29:10] that is given for you and you have a
[29:12] right to it
[29:14] glory to god how many understand that
[29:15] now
[29:16] oh glory to god to the devil he is only
[29:19] jealous because he cannot possess what
[29:21] it belongs to you
[29:23] he cannot ever inherited it because the
[29:25] book that adam had he went back in the
[29:27] hands of the original owner satan was
[29:30] written to catch the book because he saw
[29:32] the book slipping under adam's hand that
[29:34] was the objective to take away the book
[29:36] of redemption but it was healed the
[29:38] mystery of it was sealed so when the
[29:40] devil looking to get the deed
[29:42] to take over the earth it went back in
[29:45] the hands of the original owner waiting
[29:48] for the cry to come out who is ready
[29:52] to take the book and to lose the seventh
[29:55] season
[29:56] oh glory god and john was weeping
[29:59] because there was no man worthy a man
[30:01] had to come forth a kinsmen had to
[30:03] comfort and here come that bloody
[30:06] bleeding lamb of god
[30:08] here come that bloody bleeding lamb of
[30:11] god even jesus oh he died to take the
[30:15] book or we are free this morning well
[30:18] hallelujah hallelujah here am i to
[30:20] worship where am i to bow down i'm the
[30:23] four bc amen and the 24 hours they begin

[30:53] before
[30:55] oh hallelujah
[30:57] you've been restored back to favor
[31:00] so god take you to plant you by the
[31:03] rivers of water where your leaves will
[31:05] not rhythm and whatsoever you do want to
[31:08] prosper when the ungodly is not so
[31:10] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[31:12] the counsel of the ungodly stand in the
[31:14] way of sinners or set in the seat of the
[31:17] scornful but as the light is in the law
[31:19] of god and in that lord that he meditate

[55:34] than
[55:36] more powerful than
[55:38] it's the greatest weapon for god so
[55:40] loved the world
[55:41] my god satan had the world so wrapped up
[55:43] but god so loved the world he gave his
[55:46] only begotten son what was it it was the
[55:49] love of god that released the grace of
[55:51] god and that is why we are here this
[55:53] morning could somebody give god a shout
[55:55] in the house
[56:05] so we know we are passing that on their
[56:06] life because we love the brethren
[56:09] he does love it not his brother abides
[56:10] in debt
[56:12] still going to church
[56:26] no don't think i'm angry with you
[56:29] i just read in the scriptures
[56:31] don't bother to rush me and try to say
[56:33] hey preachers say this no no no no no
[56:37] no no whosoever hates his brother is a
[56:39] murderer and you know that no murderer
[56:42] had eternal life
[56:44] [Applause]
[56:51] hereby perceive me the love of god
[56:54] because
[56:55] this is a big one
[56:57] because he laid on his life for us we
[56:59] ought to lay down our lives for the
[57:01] brethren amen
[57:03] oh that is a huge one
[57:06] they call it big one
[57:08] amen
[57:10] see please get quiet
[57:13] hallelujah
[57:14] i think i'll read it again because
[57:16] that's so big you have to take it in
[57:17] deuces
[57:20] i don't repeat this one because there
[57:21] was one fly over your head
[57:25] hereby perceive me the love of god
[57:27] because he had laid on his life for us
[57:29] we ought to lean on our lives
[57:31] for the brethren
[57:33] but whosoever had this world good and
[57:36] see his brother have need and shuttered
[57:38] up his bowels of compassion from him
[57:40] how dwell at
[57:42] the love of god in him
[57:47] amen is getting light bro
[57:50] i say long time some people don't like
[57:51] to ask how you're going to know because
[57:52] they're afraid you say you're going bad
[57:54] and they could do it a raise you could
[57:55] do with a sandwich and they don't want
[57:56] to put out anything from their pocket
[57:59] so that's a question to ask at all
[58:02] all right all right
[58:05] open your mouth and ask them how
[58:07] are you going
[58:10] and if you have a five dollars you know
[58:11] one dollar here and they're not going so
[58:12] good take the five and give them it
[58:16] and see god add to the one dollar in
[58:17] this pocket here
[58:22] that's a challenge i know but i know
[58:24] people live that out
[58:26] and you never know how much they have
[58:28] but always given always cheerful always
[58:30] helpful always blessing is something
[58:33] that they choose to do
[58:35] oh hallelujah praise god amen
[58:38] all right
[58:41] my little children let us not love in
[58:43] word
[58:45] neither in tongue
[58:48] but deed
[58:50] and truth
[58:53] and hereby we know we are in truth and
[58:55] shall be assured in our hearts
[58:57] okay
[59:00] question four almost almost done this
[59:02] part after this part i got this morning
[59:05] right there in the office
[59:06] to bring this part to you
[59:10] [Music]
[59:12] beloved
[59:13] let us love one another amen for love is
[59:16] of god and everyone that love it is born
[59:19] of god
[59:20] and know it god
[59:22] he that love it not know it not god for
[59:24] god is love
[59:25] in this was manifested the love of god
[59:28] towards us because that god sent his
[59:31] only begotten son into the world that we
[59:33] might live through him hearing his love
[59:36] not that we love god but that he loved
[59:38] us sent his son to be a propagation for
[59:40] our sins beloved if god so love us we
[59:44] ought also to love one another
[59:46] no man had seen god at any time if we
[59:48] love one another god dwelleth in us and
[59:51] his love is perfected in us
[59:54] hereby know we that we dwell in him and
[59:56] he and us because he had given us of his
[59:59] spirit
[1:00:00] was 16 and we not have known and
[1:00:03] believed the love that god had to us god
[1:00:05] is love he that dwelleth in love
[1:00:08] dwelleth in god
[1:00:09] and god in him
[1:00:11] this is the last scripture i have here
[1:00:14] hearing is our love made perfect amen
[1:00:17] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:00:18] judgment
[1:00:19] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:00:23] there is no fear in love
[1:00:26] but perfect love casted out fear because
[1:00:30] fear had torment he that fear it is not
[1:00:34] made perfect
[1:00:35] in love
[1:00:36] what is he saying as you walk towards
[1:00:38] love
[1:00:39] you get less fear
[1:00:44] follow after charity as you walk in love
[1:00:47] the fear of men be fear of failure the
[1:00:51] fear of falling the fear of mistakes all
[1:00:54] of that begun to dissolve because you're
[1:00:56] walking in the love
[1:00:58] of god nothing could hurt you or harm
[1:01:01] you
[1:01:01] because you're in the will
[1:01:04] of god he doesn't fear it it's not made
[1:01:06] perfect in love we love him because the
[1:01:08] first love of ever man say i love god
[1:01:11] and hated his brother he's a liar for he
[1:01:14] had he had that love it not his brother
[1:01:16] whom he had seen
[1:01:17] how can you love god whom you are not
[1:01:19] seeing amen
[1:01:22] and this commandment has read from him
[1:01:24] that he will love god love his brother
[1:01:26] also
[1:01:27] oh praise god do you love the lord this
[1:01:30] morning
[1:01:32] praise the lord
[1:01:35] hallelujah
[1:01:37] hallelujah
[1:01:39] for a message called love but abraham i
[1:01:40] say this tonight as a minister of the
[1:01:42] gospel i've tried i have had the
[1:01:45] privilege of preaching around the world
[1:01:46] before tens of thousands of people and
[1:01:48] every divine promise in the bible is
[1:01:49] true and if you take the right mental
[1:01:51] attitude towards any of god's divine
[1:01:54] promises it will bring it to pass
[1:01:56] if you can take the right attitude our
[1:01:58] scripture tonight is god so loved the
[1:02:01] world and if there's anything that the
[1:02:03] world is dying for today is love
[1:02:05] in my travels i find that
[1:02:07] it's the rejected stone
[1:02:10] that keeps the building from being fit
[1:02:12] together where the assemblies in the
[1:02:14] church of god the baptist methodists
[1:02:16] will shake hands and be brothers if they
[1:02:18] just had love one for another
[1:02:21] that is the great need the world is
[1:02:22] dying for and god is love when you find
[1:02:25] the church that what's hindered the
[1:02:27] church has been a wrong conception of
[1:02:29] love now love there are two different
[1:02:31] types of love that's real love one of
[1:02:34] them is a greek word called agapo that's
[1:02:35] god's love and there's a perverted love
[1:02:37] called filio love which is human love
[1:02:40] failure comes from the word fellowship
[1:02:42] the fill your love is what you have for
[1:02:44] your wife a man might flirt with her or
[1:02:46] insult her you will shoot his brains out
[1:02:48] over her that's what failure love will
[1:02:50] do it accompanies jealousy and many
[1:02:52] other things goes with it but agape love
[1:02:54] will make you pray for his sinful soul
[1:02:56] that's the difference between the two
[1:02:58] loves god's love is the beginning of
[1:03:01] love it's a fountain of love and the
[1:03:02] church today is lacking in that
[1:03:05] that real agape love that makes you have
[1:03:08] love for your enemy
[1:03:10] and if we only have that kind of a love
[1:03:12] there'll be a revival sweet this nation
[1:03:15] from coast to coast from north to south
[1:03:18] and the reason that we do not have that
[1:03:20] love the main reason the church is not
[1:03:22] progressing like it should we don't need
[1:03:25] theology we need real love to go with
[1:03:28] theology we already know
[1:03:33] we don't need another doctrine
[1:03:35] we don't need another mystery we had
[1:03:37] them for 40 plus years what we need is
[1:03:40] the spirit
[1:03:42] love dynamics
[1:03:44] the holy ghost
[1:03:46] charity
[1:03:47] love divine to come upon what you
[1:03:49] already know
[1:03:50] hallelujah
[1:03:52] we only need love real love to go with
[1:03:54] the theology we already know we all
[1:03:56] argue so much whether we should be
[1:03:58] baptized forward backwards whatever more
[1:04:00] but that don't make any difference how
[1:04:02] you're baptized or what church you
[1:04:03] belong to or what evidence that you have
[1:04:05] that you're a christian if you haven't
[1:04:07] got love you haven't got god
[1:04:09] we need love
[1:04:11] god so loved the world that he gave his
[1:04:12] only begotten son now when love is
[1:04:14] projected and come to its end sovereign
[1:04:16] grace produced to project
[1:04:19] without love projected o praise the name
[1:04:21] of the lord
[1:04:23] what a bran of our mind new ministry
[1:04:25] justin neville
[1:04:26] brother brown
[1:04:27] as soon as i returned from california
[1:04:29] the lord willing
[1:04:30] what the branham tabernacle needs is a
[1:04:32] revival
[1:04:33] they need a revival and a filling of the
[1:04:35] holy ghost
[1:04:36] and that's the great need of the
[1:04:38] tabernacle some of the finest people in
[1:04:40] the world comes here but what we need is
[1:04:42] the baptism of the holy ghost i feel it
[1:04:44] i can tell it and as soon as we return
[1:04:47] back if the lord willing we're going to
[1:04:49] have a revival for that very purpose
[1:04:52] that's the members of this tabernacle
[1:04:54] and other people who are seeking the
[1:04:55] holy ghost might come in and give
[1:04:58] instructions and everything half prayer
[1:04:59] meetings in here to receive the holy
[1:05:01] ghost and that the church might get back
[1:05:04] into the will of god and move on with
[1:05:06] the program of god as it moves on amen
[1:05:09] oh hallelujah so bahrain himself saw the
[1:05:12] need for the holy ghost
[1:05:14] in his church isn't that right so he
[1:05:16] said what god calls foolish what man is
[1:05:18] called foolish god called great
[1:05:20] so that we have got to do is to get back
[1:05:22] into the program of god are you in god's
[1:05:24] program or are you coming to church you
[1:05:27] have to know the program of god and you
[1:05:29] know you're in the program of god
[1:05:30] they're not devil control you're off
[1:05:32] beat no devil control you're off balance
[1:05:34] because you're in god's program
[1:05:37] it's god's program for you you're here
[1:05:38] this morning because he said don't
[1:05:40] forsake the assembling of yourself
[1:05:41] together as the man of psalm is the cast
[1:05:44] still man listen to the books and just
[1:05:46] play tape that's the purpose to get be
[1:05:48] in the church there's a purpose to be in
[1:05:50] fellowship there is unction and
[1:05:52] words coming from god that you need to
[1:05:54] hear and need to know but more than that
[1:05:56] is a ruinous environment you could get
[1:05:58] to access broadly kindness
[1:06:02] only in a group scenario can somebody
[1:06:04] mash your corn mash your toes affect
[1:06:07] your life or straight your life and only
[1:06:09] in this circumstance you can get the
[1:06:11] opportunity to forgive and repent and
[1:06:13] say forgive me say i'm sorry say i'm
[1:06:16] wrong bless god to be in a group
[1:06:19] that feels the spirit of god
[1:06:24] can somebody upset you you're in the
[1:06:25] right place
[1:06:27] [Applause]
[1:06:28] somebody hurt you is the right place
[1:06:30] you're feeling bad about this when
[1:06:32] you're in the right place what you're
[1:06:33] gonna do about it
[1:06:35] christian man
[1:06:37] christian woman what you're gonna do
[1:06:39] about it
[1:06:40] oh hallelujah this we're gonna live
[1:06:43] it's going to thunder
[1:06:45] the tower gonna be stunned
[1:06:47] because it looked like the honeymoon
[1:06:48] stick
[1:06:49] but the honey will stick
[1:06:52] oh give the lord a shout
[1:06:53] [Applause]
[1:06:58] now watch all this forgiveness
[1:07:00] forgiveness most of the time is just
[1:07:02] talk
[1:07:03] just words just more going
[1:07:05] there is something i call the spirit of
[1:07:07] forgiveness until i get to that spirit
[1:07:09] it's a forgiveness yet
[1:07:15] when you're getting the spirit of
[1:07:16] forgiveness it's really forgiving
[1:07:18] it's really released it's really it's
[1:07:20] come true because you're in the spirit
[1:07:21] of it
[1:07:25] hallelujah now you're to need the spirit
[1:07:28] of forgiveness in order to approach
[1:07:30] charity
[1:07:33] no we get into something
[1:07:35] because he said we have to come to this
[1:07:37] ministry what ministry the ministry of
[1:07:39] jesus christ we have to come to the king
[1:07:41] you can't just walk up to the king you
[1:07:44] have to have on the right dress
[1:07:45] [Applause]
[1:07:49] that's the thing with esther
[1:07:52] esther was getting instructions
[1:07:54] of hold the dress
[1:07:56] you couldn't just go in like that
[1:07:59] but because of the press
[1:08:01] we have to go
[1:08:03] let's just say if i perish i perish
[1:08:05] [Applause]
[1:08:07] but i'm going in the presence of the
[1:08:09] king
[1:08:10] who is the king the capstone
[1:08:13] charity
[1:08:18] [Applause]
[1:08:21] so we've got to get back into the
[1:08:22] program of god and finally here we go
[1:08:26] what god wants us to do
[1:08:28] and the only way i know to do it is
[1:08:30] prayer
[1:08:31] [Applause]
[1:08:34] could you say it again sure
[1:08:37] sure
[1:08:39] we have got to do we have got to get
[1:08:41] back into the program of god
[1:08:43] and find out after all what
[1:08:46] god
[1:08:46] wants us to do
[1:08:49] and the only way i know to do is prayer
[1:08:52] prayer is the key
[1:08:54] that's the answer prayer changes things
[1:08:57] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[1:09:00] was ever put in the control
[1:09:02] of a human being
[1:09:04] [Applause]
[1:09:07] so when you ball your head
[1:09:09] and open your mouth it's a weapon of
[1:09:12] warfare
[1:09:18] one time jesus before last week he said
[1:09:20] lord god
[1:09:22] i know that thou always hearst me
[1:09:24] but for dear sakes
[1:09:28] he was living real more together
[1:09:31] that power
[1:09:32] of that prayer
[1:09:34] that's why you should keep on praying
[1:09:36] because your prayer could ricochet in
[1:09:37] heaven angels dispatch based upon your
[1:09:40] prayer
[1:09:41] i've heard the cries of
[1:09:44] my people and i've come down
[1:09:46] today you could just walk or heal
[1:09:48] totally completely
[1:09:50] right now

[1:09:58] and there was an indian lady from apache
[1:10:00] in india she had crutches and so on and
[1:10:02] she came up on a platform with her
[1:10:04] crutches and when she got up there she
[1:10:06] just handed him the crutches and walked
[1:10:07] back home
[1:10:10] he didn't have to pray for her her faith
[1:10:12] was so anointed
[1:10:13] her faith was so anointed another woman
[1:10:16] she was in a wheelchair she got a
[1:10:18] preclude and she put that prayer card on
[1:10:20] her legs and said satan come out of
[1:10:21] there in the name of jesus the people
[1:10:23] spirit and she come with a wheelchair

[1:13:02] 1962 he preached such a perfect man
[1:13:05] faith and virtual knowledge so he
[1:13:06] understood all of that so he is praying
[1:13:09] looking for the cap
[1:13:12] not on the people there because they
[1:13:13] they
[1:13:14] they wasn't there in that

[1:13:18] the pyramid of our lives

[1:13:49] that we might see the program of god
[1:13:51] then put on the capstone
[1:13:53] cap the perimeter of our lives what are
[1:13:55] you saying someday you're gonna wake up
[1:13:57] to understand a pyramid was being built
[1:13:59] in you
[1:14:02] come on now ride with me write me don't
[1:14:04] don't don't don't slow down now
[1:14:06] one day gonna wake up and recognize a
[1:14:08] pyramid was being built in you
[1:14:11] and you're gonna have to ask god to cap
[1:14:14] the pyramid
[1:14:15] [Applause]
[1:14:16] of your life
[1:14:18] hallelujah because the cap is promised
[1:14:20] isn't that right
[1:14:22] this great servant moses message but
[1:14:25] moses had no fellowship not one thing in
[1:14:27] that 40 years was spoke that god did for
[1:14:29] him or any way any supernatural he was
[1:14:32] out of fellowship
[1:14:33] or when a church gets out of fellowship
[1:14:35] with god miracles cease
[1:14:37] signs of wonder cease revival cease just
[1:14:40] moves right out when you when you get
[1:14:42] out of the fellowship
[1:14:44] oh
[1:14:44] so you said the bride hasn't had a
[1:14:46] revival as yet
[1:14:47] it will take them seven thunders that
[1:14:49] means sometimes have to bring back the
[1:14:50] blood amen because the blood is not
[1:14:52] going to bring fellowship
[1:14:53] and fellowship we're going to bring
[1:14:55] okay now the thing to do is keep is keep
[1:14:58] that's what i'm trying to say a while
[1:15:00] the love of god in your heart
[1:15:03] keep
[1:15:03] fellowshipping with him and he will add
[1:15:06] these other things
[1:15:08] just as we mature
[1:15:12] that's very important hallelujah but i'm
[1:15:14] talking about somebody got their baptism
[1:15:16] shall i ask god for gifts he said become
[1:15:18] a stuffed shirt
[1:15:22] because that's what people do they get
[1:15:23] the blessing they get puffed up so he
[1:15:25] said no don't do that let the lord lead
[1:15:26] you and different things like that
[1:15:28] so watch i'll keep fellowship with him
[1:15:31] and he will add these things
[1:15:34] other things just as we mature don't you
[1:15:36] think so so moses
[1:15:38] was out of fellowship no fellowship
[1:15:40] dear what
[1:15:43] no fellowship out there in a strange
[1:15:45] country among strangers not his own
[1:15:47] people she was his the people there was
[1:15:49] ethiopians and he was a jew
[1:15:51] completely out of the reach of god
[1:15:54] seemingly
[1:15:55] are you ready
[1:15:57] and god all the time knowing that no
[1:16:00] matter how much of a mess
[1:16:02] that god that man makes out of the
[1:16:04] program of god god is going to
[1:16:06] straighten it out
[1:16:09] [Applause]
[1:16:11] no matter what mess
[1:16:13] is in this message
[1:16:15] god
[1:16:18] will straighten it out
[1:16:21] moses was 40 years under silence
[1:16:24] normal living and god waited for his
[1:16:27] time
[1:16:28] to reconnect back moses
[1:16:30] to his commission and purpose
[1:16:32] nothing could stop it
[1:16:34] not his backside not just running
[1:16:36] nothing could stop it and you're back
[1:16:38] sliding and running that ain't going to
[1:16:39] stop it this happened that happened that
[1:16:41] ain't going to stop it the purpose that
[1:16:43] god put inside for your life that
[1:16:46] must
[1:16:48] must
[1:16:50] must
[1:16:51] be accomplished because he said my word
[1:16:54] shall not
[1:16:56] return unto me boy
[1:16:58] oh hallelujah
[1:17:00] glory to god what it shall accomplish
[1:17:04] oh praise him of the lord
[1:17:05] [Applause]
[1:17:09] david says god is my rock
[1:17:10] you know what a rock is referred to a
[1:17:12] rock is a revelation like the word the
[1:17:14] christ
[1:17:15] david was crying out saying god is my
[1:17:17] rock
[1:17:18] my revelation
[1:17:20] now peter rock confession which we know
[1:17:23] he would build his church on the rock
[1:17:25] not peter being a stone as a roman
[1:17:27] catholic tries to say it but peter's
[1:17:29] confession of the revelation that's the
[1:17:32] church
[1:17:32] god will reveal it not a confession of
[1:17:35] this man because later he backslid
[1:17:38] not in not a confession of him being the
[1:17:41] son of god because they knew he was the
[1:17:43] son of god
[1:17:44] peter just said it but it what it was it
[1:17:47] was the revelation that had been
[1:17:49] revealed from heaven that he was the son
[1:17:51] of god
[1:17:52] so it wasn't the words that was the son
[1:17:54] of god no
[1:17:56] it was the fact that peter heard from
[1:17:57] him
[1:17:59] that he was the son of god
[1:18:01] that was divine revelation coming to
[1:18:04] peter
[1:18:05] and you have the ability
[1:18:06] come on i want to give a shout on that
[1:18:09] you have the ability
[1:18:10] to hear from god

[1:18:16] don't let the devil tell you backstage
[1:18:17] you cannot hear from god don't let the
[1:18:19] devil tell you you sin you cannot hear

[1:27:56] it just nearly kills you
[1:27:58] we can
[1:27:59] obtain brotherly kindness
[1:28:02] and feeling for one another
[1:28:04] to maintain it in a group
[1:28:06] why do you care for that brother because
[1:28:07] you broke bread with him at the altar
[1:28:09] you fellowship with him you shook his
[1:28:11] hands you worship at him he's your
[1:28:13] brother listen he might do something in
[1:28:15] the flesh that you would disagree with
[1:28:18] because you kind of stay you ought to do
[1:28:20] it shun a little bit but at the bottom
[1:28:22] of your heart if something under that
[1:28:24] brother it will only kill you or that
[1:28:26] sister i'm an old man i have once young
[1:28:29] and now i'm old i've seen it through the
[1:28:31] ages here people say i won't have no
[1:28:32] more to do with him and something
[1:28:34] happened that man it nearly kills him oh
[1:28:36] god i let my precious brother go without
[1:28:39] making friends with him see
[1:28:40] it's broadly love there we go it looks
[1:28:43] like it won't stick
[1:28:44] but it does stick
[1:28:46] the honey
[1:28:47] it sticks
[1:28:49] real honey
[1:28:52] it has the fast food honey
[1:28:53] it's just sticking at all it's just a
[1:28:54] fast thing a temporary temple day

[1:28:59] each one of these age had that rock
[1:29:01] confession
[1:29:02] and whatever i'm talking about uh the
[1:29:04] saints sleeping wait and wait and wait
[1:29:06] and see until this age but soon the holy
[1:29:08] ghost being poured out from christ will
[1:29:10] come and seal at the church then the
[1:29:12] church will be raptured it will be a
[1:29:14] complete unit of the lord god
[1:29:16] oh hallelujah could you take some more
[1:29:20] the other night i made a statement at
[1:29:22] the pulpit saying this that i would
[1:29:24] rather see burly love existing among the
[1:29:25] church if we didn't have one case of
[1:29:27] divine healing or anything else we must
[1:29:30] know what these things are for i rather
[1:29:32] have a church listen just a moment i
[1:29:35] would rather have a church that knows
[1:29:36] nothing about spiritual gift and just be
[1:29:38] so in love with each other and with
[1:29:40] christ
[1:29:42] i'd rather have that than every
[1:29:45] spiritual gift operated in the church
[1:29:47] now i know that my son had in a
[1:29:49] pentecostal group but i would rather
[1:29:51] have it where there is gifts they would
[1:29:53] feel where there is gifts there'll be
[1:29:55] confusion where there is gifts they can
[1:29:58] be questioned
[1:29:59] but where there is love it's perfect
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:03] that's right so if you are perfect love
[1:30:06] you are perfect gifts that's right so
[1:30:08] work first with love
[1:30:10] that
[1:30:12] brings
[1:30:13] fellowship
[1:30:15] and fellowship
[1:30:17] brings gifts
[1:30:19] so when people switch off the switch and
[1:30:21] fall in the darkness there's no
[1:30:22] fellowship it is evidence there is no
[1:30:24] love
[1:30:26] because you don't have to agree with me
[1:30:28] to fellowship with me
[1:30:31] we don't have to believe the same thing
[1:30:33] for you to be a friend with me there are
[1:30:34] people evil toward each other in church
[1:30:37] but they're talking to unbeliever in
[1:30:39] their job they're talking to people they
[1:30:41] don't know they will go and eat dinner
[1:30:43] with them they will go on have
[1:30:44] fellowship with them and that is not a
[1:30:46] problem but they have a big problem to
[1:30:48] repent and repent unto somebody at the
[1:30:51] offending church
[1:30:59] whether you say hallelujah or not that
[1:31:00] doesn't bother me
[1:31:02] i cannot proof that long time ago
[1:31:05] i i don't that don't but whether you see
[1:31:07] even or not as long as i'm speaking what
[1:31:09] i believe god lay upon my heart that's
[1:31:10] it
[1:31:11] whether your face hard what do you say
[1:31:14] don't say that doesn't matter i'll see
[1:31:16] it still
[1:31:17] that's just how i am built
[1:31:20] i guess you know who i am built
[1:31:22] just have to bring the wood and just
[1:31:23] slam it in
[1:31:25] the bridge just eat it all up
[1:31:27] because she loves her husband
[1:31:29] her mate
[1:31:30] the revealed word
[1:31:32] so once they're hearing the revealed
[1:31:33] word they say that's mine that's my come
[1:31:35] on preacher give it to me give it to me
[1:31:36] don't hold back give it to me
[1:31:38] i don't want to hear a dream like you
[1:31:40] had last night no give it the dream
[1:31:41] you've been like nobody's dream last
[1:31:42] night
[1:31:45] all right so now work with love first
[1:31:48] love brings fellowship fellowship bring
[1:31:51] gifts
[1:31:52] you say what the world need today is a
[1:31:53] filling
[1:31:55] a filling
[1:31:56] and when the dumping out comes it needs
[1:31:58] a filling
[1:31:59] what does that feeling do when it comes
[1:32:01] in what does the filling do
[1:32:04] what it does where you have doubts it
[1:32:06] brings fate where you have indifference
[1:32:09] it brings love when you have hatred it
[1:32:11] brings fellowship
[1:32:15] so this message need a big dumping in of
[1:32:17] the holy ghost
[1:32:19] [Applause]
[1:32:20] oh hallelujah and when the church of the
[1:32:23] living god someday
[1:32:25] will be united
[1:32:27] under one great head amen that will be
[1:32:30] the head of god go into the unity of the
[1:32:33] body of christ will be the governor and
[1:32:35] the king and the lord over the entire
[1:32:37] church under his control
[1:32:39] that head will not be the pope
[1:32:42] that will be the lord himself
[1:32:44] could you take any more
[1:32:46] we have more it's coming
[1:32:48] watch you talking about the lutheran
[1:32:50] just lost the light one more the lost
[1:32:51] coin the pentecostal just lost their
[1:32:53] light and so on he said but watch i
[1:32:55] don't care if you're messing she had a
[1:32:56] hostility in time she scrubbed the floor
[1:32:58] she swept the walls she took down the
[1:33:00] cobwebs she kept on until she found what
[1:33:02] she had lost and when she did she called
[1:33:05] her little sister changes to come now i
[1:33:07] don't care if you're a methodist here we
[1:33:08] go baptist pentecostal presbyterian let
[1:33:11] us rejoice together when that time come
[1:33:14] prophecy when the church finds his
[1:33:16] brotherly love so the prophet knew it
[1:33:18] would be absent he prophet knew it would
[1:33:20] be something that was lost but he also
[1:33:22] knew we would find it
[1:33:24] when the church finds this broadly love
[1:33:26] when the church finds his whole
[1:33:27] relationship when it just finds his
[1:33:29] place in christ it will call to the
[1:33:30] members of the body come and rejoice
[1:33:32] with us god wants the church to love him
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:41] people love the pastor but he want the
[1:33:43] church to love
[1:33:44] him
[1:33:46] hallelujah praise god amen
[1:33:49] no you know a confession
[1:33:50] a decision is a confession the
[1:33:52] confession is a stone you say what could
[1:33:54] it do to pile up a bunch of stones
[1:33:56] if you haven't got a stone cutter
[1:33:58] here we go to shape them by a sharp
[1:34:02] twitched sword of the word in the son
[1:34:04] and daughters of god
[1:34:05] so the object of the word coming to us
[1:34:07] is to shape us
[1:34:09] not for us to get a blessing on our
[1:34:11] sunday but for you to be shaped
[1:34:14] because you are a stone
[1:34:16] i want to say a living stone
[1:34:18] a lively stone but you have to be cut to
[1:34:21] be fitted in
[1:34:25] some people like themselves they don't
[1:34:26] want to change
[1:34:28] because they are satisfied
[1:34:30] with themselves
[1:34:34] but when you get trouble in your spirit
[1:34:37] that you are not all right amen
[1:34:40] you need something more
[1:34:42] then you can say lord chip me
[1:34:45] hold me
[1:34:46] cut me
[1:34:48] amen
[1:34:49] hallelujah
[1:34:50] oh praise god
[1:34:52] so watch
[1:34:55] let them run around here with all kind
[1:34:56] of women dressed like skinned women and
[1:34:58] columns of christian men letting them do
[1:35:00] it and call themselves servants of
[1:35:01] christ and the church in a lukewarm
[1:35:03] condition we need stones here we go
[1:35:05] cut
[1:35:06] into son and daughters of god
[1:35:08] that's why the prophet when he left he
[1:35:10] left a ministry on the earth to continue
[1:35:13] bringing the word say what the tapes say
[1:35:16] that we could be cut
[1:35:18] to be shaped another time he said make
[1:35:20] himself a christian

[1:35:23] a tablet a puppet inside you and become

[1:35:50] and we say some time ago action is
[1:35:52] caused inertia just happens
[1:35:55] but action is caused

[1:40:10] in the morning from the neighbors gets
[1:40:12] his wife for the goodbye and you're
[1:40:14] walking on the road but it's not right
[1:40:16] that is traditionally elders that's
[1:40:18] intellectual that's mechanic
[1:40:21] then he turned around and come and give
[1:40:22] his wife a proper kiss
[1:40:23] then he got in the spirit anything then
[1:40:26] that was the real one the first one
[1:40:28] bogus
[1:40:31] the first one was an impostor the first
[1:40:34] one was bogus the second one was the
[1:40:36] real one but let's get real people

[1:40:41] [Applause]
[1:40:44] not only you forgiving others you know
[1:40:45] but you accept and god has forgiven you
[1:40:48] because some of you walk around
[1:40:50] condemning your own self and god has
[1:40:52] nothing to do with that because jesus
[1:40:55] dropped the charges
[1:40:57] dismiss your case
[1:41:04] me see if i can
[1:41:05] enter evangelism but ram says watch
[1:41:09] confession is a stone now what peter
[1:41:10] good stone now watch you're piling up a
[1:41:13] bunch of rocks is that right it isn't
[1:41:15] doing a bit of good
[1:41:17] the water
[1:41:18] wear it away the stone so all these
[1:41:21] books and tapes and the message sweeping
[1:41:22] over the stones it's not doing good only
[1:41:24] getting smooth stones
[1:41:27] the stone's getting wary
[1:41:29] here what he says but you got watch you
[1:41:31] haven't got a true stone mason with a
[1:41:34] good sharp tool to shape you into
[1:41:37] fitting place in the house of god
[1:41:39] that is what is needed real stone mesa
[1:41:43] packs
[1:41:44] packs go and move
[1:41:47] packs be getting through
[1:41:50] packs
[1:41:52] or give the lord a salt
[1:41:55] in the house
[1:41:57] stone mix with a hammer and a chisel
[1:42:00] because you are a lively stone
[1:42:04] that you could call you the darkness
[1:42:07] to show forth his praises
[1:42:10] that is why you should be praising god
[1:42:12] continually
[1:42:15] [Applause]
[1:42:22] that is end time evangelism
[1:42:25] taking stones and shaping them
[1:42:27] if the stone mason isn't there they will
[1:42:29] shape them and make them quit this and
[1:42:30] that and cut them and make them miss
[1:42:32] wait praise god all right
[1:42:34] it's not right
[1:42:36] wife obey your husband that's the word
[1:42:39] some woman taking them off spiritually

[1:42:42] your mind by their ears or something
[1:42:43] like that

[1:53:33] okay let me go first seven things faith
[1:53:36] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[1:53:38] godliness brotherly love advertise and
[1:53:41] then the love of god
[1:53:43] the holy ghost
[1:53:44] christ and the person of the holy ghost
[1:53:47] comes upon you in the true
[1:53:49] baptism of the holy ghost when you get
[1:53:52] all these virtues sealed in you then god
[1:53:54] lives in a tabernacle called the
[1:53:56] building the living tabernacle of the
[1:53:58] living god's dwelling place and when a
[1:53:59] man possesses these things then the holy
[1:54:03] ghost comes upon him no matter you might
[1:54:06] speak with tongues no matter
[1:54:07] impersonatory gift but you still might
[1:54:09] do that but until these virtues go into
[1:54:11] you you are still off the real true
[1:54:13] foundation of faith and then these
[1:54:15] virtues grow in and you add to that then
[1:54:18] you are living
[1:54:19] monument you are living moving idle
[1:54:22] amen hallelujah where i'm going with all
[1:54:25] of this well
[1:54:27] on the message got the guide baron says
[1:54:30] if god gave a duck
[1:54:32] enough sense to dodge the coldness how
[1:54:35] ought to give the church if a duck can
[1:54:38] by instinct
[1:54:39] what about the holy ghost in the church
[1:54:42] it ought to lead us
[1:54:43] from formalities and creeds into a
[1:54:46] glorious
[1:54:47] wonderful
[1:54:48] baptism of the holy ghost that brings
[1:54:50] virtue and knowledge and patience so
[1:54:54] since the prophet left the guide was
[1:54:57] supposed to guide us to this
[1:55:00] oh man you should be shouting
[1:55:02] since the prophet left
[1:55:04] the guide was supposed to guide the
[1:55:06] people not the ministerial associations
[1:55:10] not the message popes and bishops but to
[1:55:12] this year to watch the church watch it
[1:55:15] ought to lead us from foreign creeds and
[1:55:17] things into a glorious wonderful
[1:55:20] baptismal holy ghost where it brings
[1:55:22] virtue and knowledge patience godliness
[1:55:23] and the holy spirit that's what the real
[1:55:26] guide will lead
[1:55:28] because he will breed nothing else but
[1:55:29] the
[1:55:30] gospel amen
[1:55:32] oh hallelujah
[1:55:34] glory
[1:55:36] when that bridge is perfect it's come
[1:55:37] and we have it today by god's help the
[1:55:39] perfect interpretation of the word
[1:55:41] with divine vindication perfect
[1:55:44] interpretation of the word where you
[1:55:45] could see where you are and see what god
[1:55:47] wants you to be deal with us not made
[1:55:49] perfect isn't that right oh hallelujah
[1:55:52] praise god
[1:55:54] praise god so the prophet said the
[1:55:56] people in the message their faith isn't
[1:55:58] ripe enough oh my god he's talking about
[1:56:01] the writing of your fate we have to come
[1:56:02] into brotherly kindness which ripens
[1:56:04] your fate because faith is based on
[1:56:07] forgiveness fate is based on
[1:56:09] so therefore in the ripening of your
[1:56:11] faith it has to have the application of
[1:56:13] the blood of brotherly kindness isn't
[1:56:14] that right

[1:57:07] of charity we're talking about agape
[1:57:10] love
[1:57:11] spontaneous divine love
