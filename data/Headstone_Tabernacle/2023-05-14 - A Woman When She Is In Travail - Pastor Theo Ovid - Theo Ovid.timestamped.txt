[52:12] verse 9 says remember the former things
[52:14] of old
[52:15] for I am God and there is none else
[52:19] I am God and there is none like me
[52:24] declaring the end from the beginning and
[52:27] from ancient times the things that are
[52:30] not yet done seeing my Congress shall
[52:33] stand and I will do all my pleasure
[52:36] he declares the end from the beginning
[52:38] what declares him to be such a God is
[52:40] that he could prophesy through His
[52:42] prophets and see it come to pass surely
[52:45] there's a bride on the Earth
[52:47] surely there's a Next Generation that's
[52:50] going to be the final voice
[52:51] to the final age oh praise the Lord amen
[52:55] so we want to say happy Mother's Day to
[52:57] all the mothers here this morning
[53:00] and it's a challenge
[53:02] especially in times like this to be
[53:04] mother and Mother's Day shouldn't be
[53:06] like just Mother's Day one day but it
[53:08] should be every day
[53:09] amen praise God 365 years a day and
[53:15] there's a real Spirit of motherhood
[53:17] some people just make children
[53:19] and they just have children
[53:20] but there are there's what they call the
[53:22] spirit of motherhood that not just make
[53:24] sure but raise children
[53:26] raise them unto God
[53:28] wisdom to fear the lord
[53:30] raise them in the things and the ways of
[53:32] God Point them to the Cross Point them
[53:35] to righteousness Point them to the
[53:37] things that that you want them to walk
[53:39] in light
[53:40] I have your parents say give them a
[53:42] chance let them live their life and and
[53:45] they're young and instead of foolishness
[53:46] I wonder and and from that time the
[53:49] child won the off keys to be way way off
[53:51] and then it's hell to get them back
[53:54] and you know when if a plane is going
[53:57] a degree a little degree off after a
[54:01] while there's a little
[54:03] off track
[54:04] after so much hours they find yourself
[54:07] way way way from the destination point
[54:10] and as a Christian you have to be
[54:12] careful
[54:13] just a little and your time just roll
[54:16] onto that little thing there and you
[54:18] find yourself the correct line is here
[54:19] and you quite quite also and you want to
[54:22] know how did I get here your turn here
[54:24] that little thing that let's return
[54:28] on all the way
[54:30] so we thank God for his grace this
[54:32] morning
[54:33] and we thank God for the services passed
[54:35] we thank God for the special service we
[54:37] had on Friday by the Cali salt
[54:39] for those who taste come I know a couple
[54:42] of years he gave a testimony and so on
[54:44] and a testimony still holds
[54:46] to show his God and God do a workout he
[54:49] doesn't do halfway working
[54:50] when God openly blind man he blamed like
[54:52] one I see in one accident no no the band
[54:54] saw
[54:55] walked the claim amen God straightened
[55:00] out the dumb spoke and that's why when
[55:02] God awoken you is he do not work in you
[55:04] it has nothing to do with who like you
[55:06] who talking about you is God doing the
[55:08] work in you amen praise God by the
[55:12] Gideon the last crying keep on crying
[55:15] keep on saying one day you wanna have
[55:18] your last cry we're gonna step into your
[55:21] situation we're gonna step into your
[55:24] what you have need of Amen but ULU are
[55:28] generational issues and the abstract to
[55:30] the title deed and he share that people
[55:32] talk Mysteries and whatnot but many
[55:34] times you don't hear how to live
[55:36] how to have the wisdom the guidance the
[55:38] knowledge we need it because brother
[55:40] Branham says sin will get worse and
[55:42] worse things are not getting better
[55:44] things are getting worse people getting
[55:47] an issue they come and that's where
[55:49] either come at the motors of the heart
[55:51] the issues of life and the challenges
[55:53] what's inside your heart
[55:55] everything is under being what's inside
[55:56] the heart people have jealousy Envy
[55:58] malice this defile you not by going you
[56:01] know what comes out and God is make sure
[56:03] the situation comes up that it shows
[56:06] what is in the heart as we said the
[56:07] older brother with the prodigal son he
[56:09] may not even knew what was in his heart
[56:11] until his back sitting money spending
[56:14] wisdom slacker brother came back home
[56:17] hallelujah praise God and they killed
[56:19] fatted calf another big Feast for this
[56:21] brother who was terrible he wasn't a
[56:22] nice guy you know he was terrible
[56:24] Behavior he went far no WhatsApp no call
[56:26] no no phone call nothing at all but his
[56:29] father was waiting on him just like your
[56:31] father today is waiting on you his
[56:33] father was waiting for him that sucker
[56:35] was coming back he said I will arise
[56:37] I'll tell my father I've sinned I'm no
[56:39] longer worthy to be called your son let
[56:41] me be a servant but once a son
[56:43] or with the Sun a father can make a
[56:46] service and a servant a servant is a
[56:48] servant a son is a son I'll be thank God
[56:51] for that today so God looks at the heart
[56:53] that's the first thing people talk about
[56:55] their message and believing and
[56:57] scriptures and everything else but
[56:58] what's in your heart it's got to be deep
[57:01] down in your heart your soul a desire
[57:03] amen for God a desire for righteousness
[57:06] oh my thank God may God bless me it's 16
[57:10] hungering until sin after righteousness
[57:13] oh God I was like I was going crazy it's
[57:16] 16. and how God has done something I
[57:19] said Lord do something for me this year
[57:21] that was 1974. I say God I don't know
[57:24] you but I want to know you I want to
[57:27] know you I want to know who you are I
[57:28] was struggling in my spirit because I
[57:30] know there's a reality somewhere
[57:32] 1975 how can I forget that year God came
[57:35] into my life done something for me so
[57:37] real that's kept me all these years I
[57:40] can keep myself God kept me I am here by
[57:43] God's grace I am here by God's mercy
[57:46] it's a long time you know 75 is way back
[57:49] when
[57:50] praise God number one if it's really
[57:51] real
[57:54] great is really really
[57:57] did my wife says
[57:59] Oh Praise the Lord what I would do
[58:05] I don't know
[58:07] but this is life
[58:09] that is life so we are grateful to be
[58:12] here this morning so I want to share
[58:14] something with you this morning and even
[58:16] with mothers in mind but let's tune to
[58:18] Hebrews chapter 4 let's stand sin John
[58:20] chapter 16.
[58:22] when we from 12 to 22 Saint John four
[58:24] thank you brothers and thank you brother
[58:26] Stephen for that anointed song service
[58:29] this morning certainly appreciate the
[58:31] music
[58:31] man these brothers are inspired
[58:34] musicians are inspired this is the
[58:37] inspired Church
[58:39] it's bad bunch I love that men move by
[58:43] the Holy Ghost not move by other men you
[58:45] know men not men not men you know men
[58:48] move women move by the Holy Spirit love
[58:51] that love that love that okay Hebrews
[58:53] chapter 4
[58:55] want to read verse one let us therefore
[58:57] fear lest a promise being lifters of
[59:00] entering into his rest any of you should
[59:02] seem to come short of it
[59:04] but fun to us was the Gospel preached as
[59:07] well as unto them
[59:08] but the word preached did not profit
[59:10] them not being mixed with faith for we
[59:14] which have believed do enter into rest
[59:18] as he said as I've sworn in my wrath if
[59:21] they shall enter my rest although the
[59:23] works was finished from the foundation
[59:25] of the world
[59:26] for you speak in a certain place
[59:29] on of the seventh day on this wise and
[59:32] God did rest the seventh day from all
[59:35] his works and in this place again if
[59:38] they shall enter into my rest see in
[59:41] therefore it remained that some must
[59:44] enter therein and dear to whom it was
[59:46] first preached entered not in because of
[59:49] unbelief again he limited a certain day
[59:52] seen in David today after so long a time
[59:54] as it is said today if he will hear my
[59:57] voice Harden not your hearts for if
[59:59] Jesus here we go had given them rest
[1:00:02] then would he not afterwards I've spoken
[1:00:04] of another day
[1:00:05] therefore those nine they remained
[1:00:07] therefore arrest to the people of God
[1:00:10] foreign
[1:00:15] he had also ceased from his own works as
[1:00:20] God did from his
[1:00:22] let us labor therefore to enter into
[1:00:25] that rest at least any man fall after
[1:00:30] the same example of unbelief and reading
[1:00:33] from
[1:00:34] uh Saint John chapter 16
[1:00:39] verse 12.
[1:00:41] Jesus speaks I have many things to say
[1:00:43] unto you but you cannot bear them now
[1:00:45] how be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[1:00:49] come he will guide you into all Truth
[1:00:51] for he will shall not speak of himself
[1:00:54] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:00:57] he speak and he shall show you things to
[1:00:59] come he shall glorify me for he shall
[1:01:01] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[1:01:04] you all things that the father had are
[1:01:06] mine therefore said I that he shall take
[1:01:09] of mine and shall show it unto you a
[1:01:11] little while on the world and he shall
[1:01:13] not see me and again a little while and
[1:01:15] he shall see me because I go to my
[1:01:17] father then said some of the disciples
[1:01:19] among themselves what is this that he
[1:01:21] said unto us a little while and he shall
[1:01:24] not see me and again a little while he
[1:01:26] shall see me because I go to my father
[1:01:28] and when they therefore
[1:01:30] they said therefore what is this that is
[1:01:33] here a little while we cannot tell what
[1:01:35] he's here now Jesus knew what they were
[1:01:38] desires to ask him and said unto them do
[1:01:40] you inquire among yourselves of what I
[1:01:42] said a little while he shall not see me
[1:01:44] and again why you shall see me verily I
[1:01:47] see unto you
[1:01:48] that he shall weep and lament but the
[1:01:51] world shall rejoice it shall be
[1:01:53] sorrowful but your sorrow shall be
[1:01:56] turned into Joy a woman when she's in
[1:01:59] travail had sorrow because her awe is
[1:02:02] come but as soon as she's delivered of
[1:02:04] the child she remembered no more the
[1:02:06] anguish for joy that a man is Born Into
[1:02:10] the world ye therefore have sorrow but I
[1:02:13] will see you again and your heart shall
[1:02:15] rejoice and your joy no man take it from
[1:02:18] you let's pray father we thank you for
[1:02:20] your word we pray interpreted our hearts
[1:02:22] blessed father we pray and may anointed
[1:02:24] to the house of your children and take
[1:02:26] me out of the way and Jesus name I ask
[1:02:27] it amen and amen you may be seated oh
[1:02:30] praise the Lord
[1:02:32] thank you Jesus
[1:02:34] Hallelujah
[1:02:36] praise God don't go quiet Amino
[1:02:39] keep us keep the mutual summon
[1:02:42] praise God keep it in neutral
[1:02:45] and then it was written again
[1:02:47] praise the Lord amen so this morning I
[1:02:49] have a title a woman when she's in
[1:02:52] travail
[1:02:53] that's the title woman when she's in
[1:02:55] travil and I've had an inspiration labor
[1:02:58] pains you know what mothers but the only
[1:03:01] way to become a mother is to go through
[1:03:03] this process
[1:03:04] travel
[1:03:05] and Libertines and that identifies
[1:03:09] somebody being gets into the position of
[1:03:12] becoming a mother
[1:03:14] no Hebrews 4
[1:03:16] I want to bring back something from the
[1:03:17] Amplified for he this is verse 10 who
[1:03:21] once entered God's rest has ceased from
[1:03:25] the weariness and pain of human labors
[1:03:28] just as God rested from those labors
[1:03:30] peculiarism
[1:03:32] yes verse 11 verse 11 let me know let us
[1:03:35] labor listen to it in the Amplified let
[1:03:37] us therefore be zealous
[1:03:40] Not Dead
[1:03:43] not having no passion and Zeal let us be
[1:03:46] zealous and exert ourselves
[1:03:49] and strive diligently to enter that
[1:03:52] quest of God
[1:03:54] to know and experience it for ourselves
[1:03:58] it must start there oh look it up there
[1:04:00] ourselves that no one may fall or perish
[1:04:04] by the same kind of unbelief and
[1:04:05] Disobedience into those that fell into
[1:04:08] the wilderness
[1:04:09] oh Hallelujah I for contact scripture I
[1:04:12] have Isaiah 66 8 who had heard such a
[1:04:14] thing who was seeing such a thing shall
[1:04:16] the Earth be made to bring forth in one
[1:04:17] day shall the nation be born at once for
[1:04:20] as soon as Zion travail she brought
[1:04:22] forth her children
[1:04:23] oh Blessed Be when as soon as Zion
[1:04:26] travio she brought forth her children of
[1:04:29] course they have who have heard of this
[1:04:30] kind of thing oh glory to God shall they
[1:04:32] come for them one day what did the
[1:04:33] prophet said God will do in one year but
[1:04:35] all that erosion failed to do in 2000
[1:04:38] years that year is coming that year
[1:04:40] could start today oh praise the name of
[1:04:43] the Lord but that year is coming Oh
[1:04:45] Glory to God hallelujah
[1:04:48] praise the name of the Lord no I trust
[1:04:51] all of you have heard it so shared and
[1:04:54] it's in the word his own experience and
[1:04:56] it's part of the message of the Bible
[1:04:58] and the gospel and understand this the
[1:05:01] Bible is our absolute
[1:05:04] what the prophet came to reveal was the
[1:05:06] scriptures
[1:05:06] the scriptures is first that is our
[1:05:09] absolute that is what you have to plug
[1:05:11] right back into and the reveal would
[1:05:13] come on top of that oh glory to God the
[1:05:15] Bible is first the Bible is the is the
[1:05:18] Testament of God
[1:05:20] isn't that right
[1:05:21] now listen to this
[1:05:24] oh boy
[1:05:25] in the Life lays the blood
[1:05:28] and the blood is the life
[1:05:29] that's the only man that could bleed the
[1:05:32] right kind of blood because he was God's
[1:05:33] own blood so because all of us was born
[1:05:36] in sin and shape energy God had to do a
[1:05:38] miracle
[1:05:39] to identify by prophecy a virgin shall
[1:05:43] conceive he will take care of the egg
[1:05:44] and the sperm he go take care of the
[1:05:47] whole process to bring forth a man that
[1:05:50] is not of this world this man is from
[1:05:52] outside oh close this man from outer
[1:05:54] space this man not of the Earth the
[1:05:57] sperm The Germ the seed the egg that
[1:06:01] came from God so when Mary brought for
[1:06:03] Jesus he was God he was the word made
[1:06:07] flesh
[1:06:09] or glory to God God couldn't Deliver us
[1:06:13] as God yet to come down like us he had
[1:06:16] to be one of us you have to be born of a
[1:06:18] man to take on the robe of Flesh to come
[1:06:21] to redeem us to come to make the
[1:06:24] purchase price take Ransom us from the
[1:06:27] hands of the enemy because the devil had
[1:06:29] us in grip and corner to break the grip
[1:06:31] of the hands of the devil upon you upon
[1:06:34] your family upon your loved ones our
[1:06:37] power to come to do that so Jesus had to
[1:06:40] come to do that
[1:06:43] Glory Glory
[1:06:46] so what goes on blood and he bled the
[1:06:49] blood that redeemed you so our Salvation
[1:06:51] lays in Christ Jesus what he did for us
[1:06:55] at Calvary no matter how low we get
[1:06:58] how immoral we get how polluted we get
[1:07:02] when we look at Calvary with a true
[1:07:06] heart and confess our sins there on
[1:07:09] Calvary that settles it
[1:07:12] that
[1:07:14] settles it
[1:07:16] when you confess your sins you look to
[1:07:18] Calvary because that is where your
[1:07:20] source is you could stop drinking stop
[1:07:22] smoking you're still going to hell
[1:07:24] you're still a sinner stop and doing
[1:07:26] what because that is you doing it or
[1:07:28] give the Lord some Praises but it's not
[1:07:31] what you do
[1:07:32] I don't think people get a nut you know
[1:07:33] is what he has done and what you have
[1:07:37] accepted what he has done
[1:07:39] Oh Glory after he pardon you or hear
[1:07:41] pardon you and he forgive you or even
[1:07:43] he'll forgive you and if he forgive you
[1:07:46] of your sins you have a right to rejoice
[1:07:48] you have a right to praise God if the
[1:07:51] whole world know you are a sinner that
[1:07:53] has nothing to do with anybody
[1:07:55] or give the Lord some Praises if
[1:07:58] everybody know have what you have done
[1:08:00] so what
[1:08:04] nothing to do with anybody else
[1:08:06] Jesus dropped your charges
[1:08:08] Jesus dismissed your case
[1:08:10] Jesus gave you by his grace
[1:08:14] [Music]
[1:08:15] [Applause]
[1:08:17] so let's see it again
[1:08:18] no matter how low you get
[1:08:20] we get
[1:08:21] how immoral we are
[1:08:23] how polluted we get when we look at
[1:08:26] Calvary in a true heart and confess our
[1:08:28] sins the uncovery that selflessly that
[1:08:31] right no more than your confession can
[1:08:34] go from your lips still God has under
[1:08:35] obligation to answer you
[1:08:37] no you ain't get that yet no more than
[1:08:40] your confession go from your lips till
[1:08:43] God is under obligation to answer you so
[1:08:46] once you try to confess God make an
[1:08:48] obligation he has to answer that
[1:08:51] he cannot let your confession go
[1:08:53] unanswered
[1:08:55] he has to come and answer that he has to
[1:08:57] he's under obligation to respond to that
[1:09:00] could we give the Lord a prison
[1:09:02] [Applause]
[1:09:02] [Music]
[1:09:04] Hallelujah
[1:09:05] Glory
[1:09:08] he said now watch this Christian this
[1:09:09] Ahab jeze will have plenty to eat and
[1:09:13] you know Prosperity isn't a sign of God
[1:09:15] being with you if that is so our nation
[1:09:17] blessed and all the people are
[1:09:18] Christians so Prosperity then vice versa
[1:09:21] no watch
[1:09:22] he's talking about the widow woman right
[1:09:24] now God telling Elijah Commander where
[1:09:26] the woman feels you she's ordered
[1:09:28] she doesn't know that God
[1:09:31] think about it go ahead and talk to and
[1:09:32] say listen feed that man you know he
[1:09:34] said I have commanded a widow woman to
[1:09:36] feed you because Elijah shut up the
[1:09:38] Heavens either with him for three and a
[1:09:40] half years he said no rain no food and
[1:09:43] he have to eat he said go down there I
[1:09:45] have a woman there like a man I want to
[1:09:47] feed you
[1:09:48] she looking to die because she has a
[1:09:50] little meal a little oil she became one
[1:09:51] last big Shepherd baby her husband has
[1:09:53] died so she's a widow woman so she's
[1:09:56] gonna make that big and oil and thing
[1:09:58] like that and Konan
[1:10:00] watch this
[1:10:02] this poor little woman she looked at
[1:10:04] that little baby all night long she
[1:10:05] couldn't sleep first place she was so
[1:10:07] hungry she couldn't sleep
[1:10:08] she knew that one handful of me stood
[1:10:10] between her and death what would she do
[1:10:12] she couldn't stand us any longer she's
[1:10:14] frail she's walking reeling she walked
[1:10:17] little fellow crying for a more full of
[1:10:19] bread yet she was a Christian
[1:10:22] oh
[1:10:23] do bless
[1:10:27] is that Christian we talk about it
[1:10:28] pressure
[1:10:33] go see him in there
[1:10:35] still the word people died
[1:10:39] who said who said you're going to be no
[1:10:40] bread
[1:10:41] you're starting to get frightened
[1:10:42] already
[1:10:44] what she was a Christian right
[1:10:46] she doesn't believe in Jehovah we call
[1:10:48] Christian today loyal prove that God
[1:10:50] selected above all the women he selected
[1:10:52] her yet she done all that she could be
[1:10:55] done
[1:10:56] along towards daylight the birds
[1:10:58] wouldn't even holler they were all
[1:10:59] starved and gone they begin to break
[1:11:02] across the room I can see her so you see
[1:11:04] the Whip or the promise presented it
[1:11:05] he's seen it by vision
[1:11:07] the way he's presenting that he's seeing
[1:11:09] the story so these the gifts that he had
[1:11:11] could go right back in time
[1:11:13] because time is still here you know you
[1:11:16] just have to go back in it and the
[1:11:18] future is also here you have to go
[1:11:19] forward into it and what a prophet does
[1:11:21] he go up in the spirit go in the future
[1:11:23] come back and take your present tense
[1:11:25] because see what's going on there and if
[1:11:27] you can see the future he can see the
[1:11:28] past
[1:11:29] because the world is the reason of the
[1:11:30] Torso an intense of the heart that's
[1:11:32] what the word comes to do isn't that
[1:11:34] something there so the prophet is going
[1:11:36] back and seeing this story now okay
[1:11:38] Along Came the daylight the boys with
[1:11:39] him hello the world stops and gone they
[1:11:41] begin to break across the room I can see
[1:11:43] a certain old rocking chair ringing a
[1:11:45] hand the tears running on her cheeks as
[1:11:47] she looked little boy had spent the rest
[1:11:49] inside mama can't you just find one
[1:11:51] little piece of bread Papa was a good
[1:11:53] man God take name what's matter Mama but
[1:11:56] the woman stood she knew she met the
[1:11:58] requirement of God she had one little
[1:12:01] handful of meal she went in took a
[1:12:03] little handful of meal into the pan pour
[1:12:05] the oil in it begin to mix it up now
[1:12:07] that me was Christ Christ is the meal
[1:12:09] offering and if you're clear G-Man no
[1:12:12] and the oil represents spirit and that's
[1:12:15] the reason we anoint my oil when Elijah
[1:12:17] one time at the school of the prophets
[1:12:18] had come down there he sent some men out
[1:12:21] of the school they didn't know any
[1:12:22] difference between wild goals and peas
[1:12:24] some prophets but they pick up Allah of
[1:12:26] wild gods and Church in the pot and one
[1:12:28] of them will scream out there's death in
[1:12:29] the pot
[1:12:31] and next interpretation where a wild
[1:12:34] goat looking close to the resulting put
[1:12:35] it in the pot inside each has gone dead
[1:12:37] death in the pot that is that don't get
[1:12:40] excited he went got a handful of meal
[1:12:42] threw it into the pot and said eat why
[1:12:45] when Christ is put in debt life comes
[1:12:48] instead of death
[1:12:49] praise God
[1:12:51] and he said don't care how far you have
[1:12:53] gone
[1:12:54] how low you have sunk how immoral you
[1:12:57] are how degraded you are how sinful you
[1:13:01] are when Christ comes into the heart
[1:13:04] death Fades away and life comes into the
[1:13:07] same place from getting to the pot King
[1:13:10] life in the pot see if the cancer eat
[1:13:13] you up if tubercula the doctor turn you
[1:13:15] down nothing else can be done let a
[1:13:17] handful of Christ come into you let
[1:13:18] Jesus the same yesterday not a handful
[1:13:21] of religion now but a handful of Christ
[1:13:22] the Holy Ghost come into your heart with
[1:13:25] genuine faith and death will free out
[1:13:28] and life will take its place
[1:13:31] the oil is the spirit now what is that
[1:13:33] Christ is the word in the beginning was
[1:13:35] the word the word was with God the Word
[1:13:37] was God and the widows made flesh the
[1:13:40] spirit and Jesus told the one in the
[1:13:42] world the time is coming when God seeks
[1:13:44] people that will worship Him in spirit
[1:13:45] and in truth that is the word with the
[1:13:48] spirit some people ask the word others
[1:13:51] has the spirit but when you get the
[1:13:52] spirit and two together something's got
[1:13:54] to happen
[1:13:55] that's why the devil trying to
[1:13:57] disconnect the spirit from the truth
[1:13:59] first he's trying to make the truth not
[1:14:01] the truth praise God and they want no
[1:14:03] Spirit they have the message they have
[1:14:05] the word but then dead and our Lord we
[1:14:07] stay that way nothing happening but once
[1:14:09] you get the truth and the spirit
[1:14:11] together something have to move
[1:14:13] glory to God hallelujah something have
[1:14:16] to move it have to move in your heart it
[1:14:19] has to move in your life you're not
[1:14:21] going to leave here the same way if we
[1:14:22] get the word and spirit together the
[1:14:25] Brazilian Lord amen
[1:14:27] when you get the spirit on two together
[1:14:29] something gonna happen but just a little
[1:14:31] bit just a little bit it was all she
[1:14:33] needed God let this sink deep into
[1:14:34] people's heart you may be down to your
[1:14:37] last handful
[1:14:38] that's what Buddhism preached on The
[1:14:40] Last Cry

[1:20:55] standing at the gate with long flowing
[1:20:57] whiskers he said would you fetch me a
[1:20:59] little drink of water

[1:21:18] maybe where's the night I sent a
[1:21:19] WhatsApp and he was ready for Friday why
[1:21:22] because he has something in his heart
[1:21:24] God prepared him
[1:21:26] before I ask him
[1:21:27] God has worked on both sides to play it
[1:21:30] to show is God in the mode of two or
[1:21:33] three Witnesses let everything be
[1:21:35] established don't just hear things and
[1:21:37] believe it because somebody said it
[1:21:39] could be a big executive lie established
[1:21:42] in the motor two or three witnesses will
[1:21:45] give the Lord some praises
[1:21:47] did the Lord I shout

[1:22:51] one day we will say this is that that
[1:22:54] the prophet William Branham speak of
[1:22:57] okay the Lord a shout in the house
[1:23:00] Oh Glory to God Hallelujah to be a
[1:23:04] Christian you must be identified and the
[1:23:06] prophet said I'm identified whether a
[1:23:09] group that feel the spirit of God that
[1:23:11] know he's unveiled and no he's the same
[1:23:14] yesterday the day and forever and this

[1:32:16] you get the word and the spirit why do
[1:32:19] you think it's supposed to work out let
[1:32:21] me just ask this a little bit
[1:32:24] as Christians why do you think it's
[1:32:27] supposed to work out for you because
[1:32:28] you're a Christian
[1:32:29] because you come to church
[1:32:31] why do we feel entitled because we
[1:32:34] baptized in Jesus name everything we've
[1:32:35] got everything will be all right
[1:32:36] Hallelujah Glory Glory why supposed to
[1:32:38] be so
[1:32:40] have you not read the scriptures
[1:32:42] does these things happen for our
[1:32:44] examples
[1:32:47] we always believe no trials no testing
[1:32:50] no tribulation no disappointment we want
[1:32:52] to live or we want to live and expect
[1:32:53] more to control how we want to live that
[1:32:55] is still you
[1:32:58] and somehow God have to break you
[1:33:03] I can't
[1:33:05] because you're in real trouble
[1:33:09] because I look at my own breaking
[1:33:11] man can't break yourself you know the
[1:33:13] Bible said the heart is desperately
[1:33:14] wicked who can know it but God
[1:33:18] sometimes man don't even know what's
[1:33:19] inside their heart
[1:33:24] that's why you offer a new heart
[1:33:27] or for you a new spirit or for you his
[1:33:29] Spirit he said let's deal let's let's
[1:33:32] trade let's bargain a new utter will
[1:33:34] give you if you're willing to give me
[1:33:35] your stone here
[1:33:38] you can have two hearts inside that they
[1:33:39] are Stony Island

[1:33:43] give you a heart of Flesh give me your
[1:33:45] own humans I'll give you my spirit give
[1:33:48] you a Sanctified Spirit on my spirit
[1:33:52] now watch this here I can see you're not
[1:33:54] in obedient
[1:33:55] and that's what God requires you get the
[1:33:57] word and spirit mixed together
[1:33:58] self-sacrifice obedience
[1:34:00] and when God say a certain thing cause
[1:34:02] prophecy or something just hold on to
[1:34:04] just do it she borrow ahead and say yes

[1:34:22] good that song's good Hallelujah the
[1:34:26] barrel shall will not go empty or the
[1:34:28] crews will fail until the way that God
[1:34:31] sends rain on the earth there it was my
[1:34:33] field charged with that I feel an
[1:34:35] anointed come down upon that oh glory to
[1:34:38] God she was at the very end and in
[1:34:40] obedience because she turned in
[1:34:41] obedience she had thus say at The Lord
[1:34:43] Oh Glory to God and every day after that
[1:34:46] when she dipped there was meal where she
[1:34:48] dipped there was oil when she dipped
[1:34:50] there is meal when she dipped there was
[1:34:52] oil once you have need of it is there or
[1:34:54] you're here provider he's a way maker oh
[1:34:57] Gloria called Hallelujah because he said
[1:34:59] the Lord do you want to hear that that's
[1:35:02] the greatest thing you could hear Oh
[1:35:04] Glory to God hallelujah praise God let's
[1:35:07] go so no matter how far you're stupid

[1:35:24] by the devil that's right but still you
[1:35:26] are Sons and Daughters of God he is not
[1:35:28] willing and you should perish but all
[1:35:30] might come to repentance he has done
[1:35:32] everything possible for only God could
[1:35:35] do this to give the opportunities to the
[1:35:38] creators to the creatures of his to
[1:35:41] accept and to be what he wants you to be
[1:35:42] back in your right estate again so God's
[1:35:46] burden is to bring us in back into a
[1:35:48] right estate you're not in the right
[1:35:50] mind if you haven't received Jesus
[1:35:51] Christ Oh Glory the God hallelujah
[1:35:53] you're not in the right position if you
[1:35:55] haven't already accepted Christ for him

[1:36:01] believe that
[1:36:03] amen amen amen
[1:36:05] now watch he's the one he created your
[1:36:07] being you'll be crazy to the world when
[1:36:10] you do that when you're what I'm a
[1:36:12] Christian genuine Christian he said when
[1:36:14] you do it you know not an atmosphere and
[1:36:16] when you do that God lists you right up
[1:36:18] from the world and you live in a
[1:36:20] Heavenly atmosphere so say in another
[1:36:22] world he said Heavenly atmosphere see
[1:36:24] then to the world you just contrary to
[1:36:27] what it is and this is contrary to the
[1:36:29] world now what you want to do is to be
[1:36:31] lifted by Christ here we go what you
[1:36:34] want to do is to be lifted up by Christ
[1:36:37] into an atmosphere to where you are
[1:36:41] happy
[1:36:42] peaceful
[1:36:43] then in dear you create a situation that
[1:36:47] may seem strange the people get wanted a
[1:36:50] spirit in churches instead of getting
[1:36:52] the Holy Spirit you go about a group of
[1:36:54] people you wash the way a person acts
[1:36:55] then the kind of people coming to that
[1:36:57] congregation the first thing you know
[1:36:58] they act the same way you take a good
[1:37:00] one woman
[1:37:02] and a bad man
[1:37:06] a good woman and a bad man guess what
[1:37:09] they know
[1:37:11] she he will become a good man
[1:37:14] or her a bad woman
[1:37:18] good man
[1:37:19] bad woman
[1:37:29] he will either become a good man or a
[1:37:30] bad or a bad woman in the atmosphere
[1:37:33] that you live you project to your
[1:37:35] Associates what you are
[1:37:38] so without saying a word as our father
[1:37:41] you have a projection to your children
[1:37:43] without even a word spoken
[1:37:45] because that is the realm of the spirit
[1:37:48] as a husband you are projecting
[1:37:50] something with only my words spoken as a
[1:37:53] wife you're projecting something without
[1:37:54] email word spoken
[1:37:57] otherwise he could cook the meal Without
[1:37:59] Love
[1:38:01] you could do meals and so forth as a
[1:38:02] duty and you hate doing that what you're
[1:38:04] doing
[1:38:05] but you're doing it you can't say by
[1:38:07] virtue of sight you can see we should do
[1:38:09] it
[1:38:11] but with your spirit terrible
[1:38:14] is that people so-called Christians who
[1:38:15] not happy at all
[1:38:17] because they are messed up in
[1:38:18] selfishness messed up in their own cells
[1:38:20] they're unresolved issues within their
[1:38:23] heart
[1:38:24] and that's why I love the words of Jesus
[1:38:26] will though be made whole
[1:38:41] you're sick
[1:38:46] but you're in the right place
[1:38:48] because sectors come to get to the
[1:38:50] physician Oh Glory to God you need a
[1:38:53] mind transfusion brain transfusion heart

[1:46:41] man is a Christian
[1:46:43] than anything I know of you know what it
[1:46:45] is
[1:46:46] it's a travail of soul
[1:46:49] a person that is always
[1:46:51] so hungering and testing for God I pick
[1:46:54] up a message listening a message and but
[1:46:55] I'm talking about he's so hungry for God
[1:46:57] and I'm listening to the prophet saying
[1:46:59] this 1965.
[1:47:02] he's just months away from God taking
[1:47:04] him home
[1:47:05] and he's talking about he's hunger and
[1:47:07] too sin for God
[1:47:09] question you ready
[1:47:11] are you hungry and testing for God
[1:47:16] what is what is your deep
[1:47:19] what is your desires

[1:47:24] night they just can't stand they got to
[1:47:26] do something they got to do something
[1:47:27] for God they're full of love they're

[1:48:24] thoughts coming to words words come into
[1:48:26] action and the action that we do on a
[1:48:29] daily basis

[1:50:52] praising God daily
[1:50:54] Thanksgiving on a daily basis on a daily
[1:50:56] basis the consistency is what is going
[1:50:59] to make a difference
[1:51:07] I remember having a financial 700 years
[1:51:09] ago
[1:51:10] on asking the young men at that time
[1:51:13] how much double series by a week
[1:51:16] how much soft drink how much distance
[1:51:17] buying and whatnot all right I said to
[1:51:19] them I said I don't want audio to stop
[1:51:21] mine I just wanted to reduce what you're
[1:51:24] buying and save the rest
[1:51:26] and some of them laughed
[1:51:28] and I was serious at that time
[1:51:30] I was about 30 or something like that
[1:51:32] and there were brothers 45 50 much older
[1:51:34] than me I was talking about retirement
[1:51:37] and one brother came up to me and tell
[1:51:38] me how you could even talk about
[1:51:41] but his retirement come so fast
[1:51:45] it was real I was showing them
[1:51:48] accumulated savings after 30 years 25
[1:51:50] years 20 years at a chart
[1:51:53] what have to do with Stevens consistency
[1:51:56] every time you put away something it's a
[1:51:59] consistent thing it could be small
[1:52:01] but after a while it adds up
[1:52:06] but when you spend all on your act you
[1:52:09] uh
[1:52:10] irrational like if
[1:52:12] it always will be dear your finals
[1:52:15] haven't want
[1:52:16] I remember when I got married I told my
[1:52:18] wife I said I don't want to Pelt my
[1:52:19] heart and try to reach it to her some
[1:52:21] people spell they have a hope quite also
[1:52:23] and they barely had pretty hand coverage
[1:52:25] I said I am not into that
[1:52:28] yo and I always believe in living below
[1:52:30] your means not above
[1:52:33] living below your means
[1:52:36] in other words you could afford but you
[1:52:37] choose not to
[1:52:38] because you want to live below your
[1:52:40] means
[1:52:41] then you always have a steady kind of
[1:52:43] thing you want me anxious oh God I can't
[1:52:45] I can't buy this you know because you
[1:52:46] buy something you buy something you
[1:52:47] didn't need
[1:52:50] remember precious brother you're going
[1:52:51] to be with the Lord you always like to
[1:52:52] buy yourself and everything you come up
[1:52:55] just give it some a month or three
[1:52:58] months and see if I really need it
[1:52:59] afterwards he didn't even just wanted it
[1:53:03] because the devil have so flash here boy
[1:53:05] your eyes has just blinked so plates
[1:53:06] four or five times and you catch you
[1:53:09] devil making sure all the offers now
[1:53:11] were so shiny and and Dandy's he keeps
[1:53:14] on your eyes
[1:53:20] like Mother's Day the amount of people
[1:53:22] with gifts out there everybody has
[1:53:23] something selling for Mother's Day it's
[1:53:24] a commercial thing
[1:53:26] mother's money
[1:53:29] how much money I could make on this
[1:53:31] Mother's Day that's what you're really
[1:53:32] about
[1:53:34] consistency is what going to make a
[1:53:37] difference
[1:53:38] consistency is connected to perseverance
[1:53:42] perseverance is because it's a goal and
[1:53:46] there's a Target you can't persevere if
[1:53:48] you have no goal on target
[1:53:50] if you want to pass mathematics Advance
[1:53:51] you have a goal if you want to pass
[1:53:54] English Spanish French technology
[1:53:56] whatever it is there's a goal there's a
[1:53:59] Target and you press towards it
[1:54:00] if there's no target here you're
[1:54:02] pressing away you just keep on going
[1:54:06] you want a job what kind of job
[1:54:09] then when you find out what kind of job
[1:54:10] you want do you have the qualification
[1:54:11] for that job
[1:54:13] if you don't are you going to get the
[1:54:15] qualification for that job then you
[1:54:17] don't want the job
[1:54:18] you're not serious
[1:54:20] you only talk and you talk
[1:54:22] you're not walking you talk yet when you
[1:54:24] are serious you will say wait a minute I
[1:54:25] want to be in the Army therefore they
[1:54:27] need this da da da
[1:54:29] in the Army you can just go with your
[1:54:31] own hairstyle but you know young is 20
[1:54:32] years
[1:54:36] when they passed through that says
[1:54:37] there's a normal machine you're using
[1:54:39] when they pass that motion in your head
[1:54:41] there's one cut you know
[1:54:46] you can't say this is who I am they will
[1:54:48] throw you out next
[1:54:49] they surely exit
[1:54:51] because you have to come under
[1:54:52] discipline
[1:54:54] because that was the Army is about and
[1:54:56] guess what God have an army Glory
[1:54:59] Hallelujah and you whether you like it
[1:55:01] or not have to come on the discipline
[1:55:03] [Applause]
[1:55:05] because you will get yourself killed or
[1:55:07] somebody killed
[1:55:08] or get the Lord some Praises my God we
[1:55:11] send some things today
[1:55:12] hallelujah hallelujah so perseverance is
[1:55:15] because he has a goal there's a Target
[1:55:17] do you have a goal
[1:55:19] you have a Target in this church you
[1:55:20] know to make a church I'll make a
[1:55:21] Revival as a Target as a goal that's
[1:55:23] only person in two we're getting back to
[1:55:25] the feet
[1:55:26] we can't have a Unity of the faith until
[1:55:28] we come back to the faith itself
[1:55:30] only when we come back to the field
[1:55:31] because about Unity we care about get
[1:55:33] unity and unity you have to come back to
[1:55:35] the faith phase and when we come out to
[1:55:37] the faith we can have a Unity of the
[1:55:38] Fate
[1:55:39] we'll give the Lord some Praises that's
[1:55:42] why ghosts are not passenger and a
[1:55:43] message to turn our hearts back to the
[1:55:46] faith of the fathers we have to have the
[1:55:48] same faith that Peter had and Paul and
[1:55:50] all them had
[1:55:51] the feet of the fathers isn't that right
[1:55:54] all right
[1:55:55] if there's no Mark okay so there's a
[1:55:57] Target and that's why Paul said I press
[1:56:00] towards
[1:56:02] the mark
[1:56:04] you must have a Target whether you're
[1:56:06] planting garden whether you're doing
[1:56:07] mechanic whatever you must have ambition
[1:56:10] you must want Excellence you're able to
[1:56:11] talk about do all that you can do do the
[1:56:13] best that you can be the best in what
[1:56:16] you're in you'll just be in it be the
[1:56:18] best of it
[1:56:20] light
[1:56:23] if your family be the best farmer your
[1:56:25] teacher be the best teacher you are
[1:56:27] engineer be the best engineer praise God
[1:56:29] your taxi driver be the best taxi driver
[1:56:31] Oh Glory to God dress the road that's
[1:56:34] the rule
[1:56:39] if there is no mark
[1:56:43] and if we are satisfied Who We Are
[1:56:46] if we don't want to change then there is
[1:56:47] nothing to press unto
[1:56:49] that person comes to church
[1:56:51] and they go back home
[1:56:54] they just do their own thing
[1:56:56] there's no need to tell me to Target
[1:56:58] there's no need to press that word press
[1:57:01] like press into the kingdom the kingdom
[1:57:03] is preached and Every Man Press into it
[1:57:05] it's a Target
[1:57:07] it's a goal it's a goal and the Bible in
[1:57:11] Hebrews 4 says let us labor to enter
[1:57:14] into that rest
[1:57:16] that rest is the goal
[1:57:18] like charity is the goal charity is the
[1:57:21] rest and before the rest of Charity is a
[1:57:23] labor the labor of Faith the labor of
[1:57:27] virtue you're not there yet the labor of
[1:57:29] knowledge look at there the labor of
[1:57:32] temperance the labor of patience the
[1:57:34] labor of godliness come on now the labor

[1:58:57] birth into all these things and then
[1:58:59] Christ come down and steal all these
[1:59:00] things in me then what does he do when

[2:14:20] that Those portions how Joshua loted
[2:14:23] them in Palestine was given by
[2:14:24] inspiration
[2:14:26] how those Hebrew mothers of those
[2:14:28] Patriarchs when the baby was coming
[2:14:30] forward in a travailing pain
[2:14:33] to deliver the child
[2:14:35] she uttered the very spot
[2:14:38] that those paycheck would settle down
[2:14:40] and being the last days so the mother's
[2:14:43] grown in was grown in Prophecy
[2:14:45] of where the son's children children
[2:14:49] will be placed positionally
[2:14:51] in the land of Palestine
[2:14:54] you talk about inspiration
[2:14:55] this Bible is inspired no matter how
[2:14:58] little just every little scripture is an
[2:15:00] outstanding in the script
[2:15:02] even those mothers when the baby was
[2:15:04] born she uttered their voice placed them
[2:15:07] positionally when they will be in a
[2:15:09] Promised Land hundreds of years later
[2:15:11] Joshua not knowing that yet by the same
[2:15:15] inspiration
[2:15:16] place them exactly where they was to be
[2:15:20] here the mothers giving birth under the
[2:15:21] anointing grown in the child's name
[2:15:24] Ephraim manner said Benjamin
[2:15:29] Judah she's ruining their names and then
[2:15:32] going in the name the name identify the
[2:15:35] position of birth
[2:15:36] in the land of promise Oh Glory to God
[2:15:39] and Joshua not knowing what the mothers
[2:15:41] did the same anointing that came upon
[2:15:44] the mothers is the same anointing coming
[2:15:47] upon Joshua to identify where the
[2:15:51] positionally placed you buy your prayers
[2:15:53] okay the Lord I shout hey
[2:15:58] Hallelujah
[2:15:59] real mothers
[2:16:01] Hebrew mothers glory to God
[2:16:04] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:16:07] look Joshua dividing up divided judah's
[2:16:10] portion if you notice on the map it's
[2:16:12] geographically just west of the plain
[2:16:13] sea a few miles south of Jerusalem at
[2:16:15] the capital let's continue he had to
[2:16:17] divide the lands and there were 12
[2:16:19] tribes divided what if he had some picks
[2:16:22] and pets what if he liked the tribe of
[2:16:24] God better than United tribe of Ephraim
[2:16:26] tribal Joseph at Judah but he didn't do
[2:16:30] it that way
[2:16:31] he divided it here we go according to
[2:16:34] the word revealed by the spirit
[2:16:37] he divided it according to the tribe and
[2:16:39] noticed he done it by the Revelation by
[2:16:41] this element of God's spirit
[2:16:43] each one of those Hebrew mothers given
[2:16:45] birth to those babies called their name
[2:16:46] and each name have a meaning Jacob means
[2:16:50] a planter but when he overcome and
[2:16:52] wrestled with Angel got him Jacob the
[2:16:54] prince to Israel
[2:16:56] the name has something to do with your
[2:16:58] life when Peter a fisherman had overcome
[2:17:01] by his faith Jesus said your name is
[2:17:03] Simon I'm going to call you Peter which
[2:17:05] means there's a rock when this great
[2:17:07] thing take place each one of these
[2:17:10] Hebrew mothers in their travailing in
[2:17:12] childbirth because that's what make a
[2:17:14] mother a mother they have to bring forth
[2:17:16] to be a mother
[2:17:17] and child would call it Reuben that
[2:17:20] placed him positionally in Palestine
[2:17:21] exactly the way that mothers call his
[2:17:24] name
[2:17:25] Reuben means she heard her God means
[2:17:28] cataresa Ephraim means corn razor one is
[2:17:32] she put her one is kakarisa one is corn
[2:17:36] razor isn't that right but watch a
[2:17:38] beautiful tight today

[2:17:58] don't have to give up wisdom all don't
[2:18:00] prophesy all don't speak in tongues all
[2:18:03] are not prophets and God has set in the
[2:18:05] church some that prophesy some that

[2:29:52] eternal life to believers

[2:29:58] the Holy Ghost was coming
[2:30:01] and given into the hands of the church
[2:30:03] to impact life
[2:30:06] that is what Calvary meant it took
[2:30:09] degraded men and women
[2:30:12] just like you and I and lifted them into
[2:30:15] a place
[2:30:16] to be Sons and Daughters of God
