[22:54] to them it is not for you to know the
[22:56] times or the seasons which the father

[23:26] he doesn't just let me burn just till he
[23:29] the really filthy let him be filthy
[23:31] still he that is righteous let him be
[23:33] righteous still he that is holy let him
[23:36] be holy still I me who like come quickly
[23:38] and my reward is with me to do what to
[23:42] give every man according on his work

[23:48] last
[23:49] blessed the data do his commandments
[23:50] that they may have right to the Tree of
[23:53] Life
[23:54] the enter in through the gates into the
[23:56] city for without are dogs and sorcerers
[23:57] and whoremongers and murderers idolaters
[23:59] who shovel love it'll make it a lie and
[24:02] I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify
[24:05] unto you these things in the churches
[24:08] I'm the root an offspring of David and
[24:10] the bright and Morning Star and the
[24:12] spirit and the bride say come
[24:14] let him but here it say come let him
[24:16] that is athirst come and whosoever will
[24:18] let him take the water of life freely
[24:21] may God bless his word you may be seated
[24:24] oh praise God is such a blessing to be
[24:26] here tonight and together wrong the hood
[24:29] of God and that is what we got a wrong
[24:31] here we not gotten our own newspaper
[24:34] clippings or talk chats or talk readers
[24:38] talk shows we come here to hear the word
[24:39] of God the news is the same as the
[24:42] different people
[24:43] crooks bandit steals information just
[24:46] different people happening to but this
[24:48] word is eternal this word have
[24:50] deliverance in it this would have power
[24:52] in a dish would have the encouragement
[24:54] and strength and grease what you need
[24:57] amen praise God amen so tonight title of
[25:00] is wait for the promise of the Father
[25:04] the promise of the father not some
[25:06] Minister not some poop not some bishop
[25:08] wait for the promise because God came
[25:10] and give you a promise it's the promise
[25:12] of the Father God give you a promise he
[25:15] said behold I will send you Elijah the
[25:18] prophet he said me Elijah to the entire
[25:20] world
[25:20] that's that mean this Messi belong to
[25:23] all of us and he but if I see Elijah
[25:25] shall turn the hearts of the children
[25:27] back to the fate of the father's I
[25:28] witness a he Amin his message so we
[25:32] don't even have our own message we
[25:34] preach another man's message oh praise
[25:36] the name of the Lord so this promise of
[25:39] the father is from AK from Luke 24 this
[25:42] is Jesus he said behold I send the
[25:46] promise of my father
[25:47] so all this thing about children in
[25:48] their hearts back to the faith of the
[25:50] fathers you have the nobody father's ad
[25:51] you have to know what was promised at
[25:53] the father and you have to know what you
[25:55] went back to hallelujah you're not going
[25:57] back to school you came back to the
[25:58] Father the faith of the fathers because
[26:01] these guys they had the original fate
[26:04] hallelujah they had the power of God
[26:06] among them is not right so when Jesus
[26:09] these are guys with all the Holy Ghost
[26:10] now these are guys that following
[26:12] Solomon ministry these are guys that
[26:14] once was preaching had signs one of the
[26:16] miracles but there was that didn't a
[26:18] permanent power they were anointed with
[26:21] temporary power to have a ministry to
[26:24] work with Jesus they were under training
[26:26] under Jesus they were under teachings
[26:29] under Jesus but they had not yet
[26:31] received that resident personal power
[26:34] that is promised to make sons of God
[26:37] manifest because Jesus by the word is
[26:40] that in the beginning of the world it
[26:42] was with God and the Word was God
[26:44] that's good but the word became flesh
[26:46] that's even better
[26:47] and the purpose the word become flesh is
[26:49] that he could connect us to bring us
[26:51] back into position and the word became
[26:53] flesh and well Amara's he came unto his
[26:56] own one is although receiving his own
[26:58] rejected but whoever receive him to them
[27:03] Givi power not just more words but power
[27:06] to become the sons of God
[27:09] so all this Jesus come in word made
[27:11] flesh is that bringing atmosphere a
[27:13] channel that we could become sons of God
[27:17] now when God talking about become sons
[27:19] of God me essence of God but the sons of
[27:22] God he is talking about his tribute sons
[27:24] of the Spirit that's a different thing
[27:27] that's not attribute in you and taught
[27:30] in you and Germany that's not that we'll
[27:32] be talking about we're talking about
[27:34] coming it to be a manifested son a
[27:36] current film son I've indicated son the
[27:39] issues that about the sons you know is
[27:41] if you come a little a manifestation or
[27:43] glory they'll also talk over I went talk
[27:46] over you have to see the results behold
[27:48] I come quickly
[27:49] maybe waters with me so God give a space
[27:52] a time to see what these sons these last
[27:54] days sons what they will do or give the
[27:58] Lord a show we have the same subject the
[28:01] prophetic vision of the end time and our
[28:03] inspiration is the same as Sunday let us
[28:05] hold fast to the professional of faith
[28:07] little wavering because you see from
[28:09] that promise Heath is people that
[28:11] promise or glory to God if the passes or
[28:14] crooked doesn't matter he is faithful
[28:16] that promised he gave a promise and he
[28:19] can't lie God will change man God will
[28:22] change bishops Palmer change whoever
[28:24] have the change shake up this and shake
[28:26] up that back but he's not gonna change
[28:27] his promise to be with you
[28:29] Oh glory to God he said by myself have I
[28:33] sworn I went God's where it's got to
[28:36] happen or they believe that so this year
[28:40] what Jesus said behold I send the
[28:42] promise of my father upon you but
[28:44] tyranny City of Jerusalem until
[28:49] until you have a clear understanding no
[28:53] that is what they had before Jesus spent
[28:55] always with them open up the
[28:56] understanding open up the word open the
[28:59] seeds of the Old Testament to reveals it
[29:01] and what must be released
[29:03] hallelujah so after they understand and
[29:06] open up Bella hungry after the word open
[29:08] up they have something to receive it
[29:10] have not understand and Obama say Allah
[29:13] understanding no no no no is
[29:15] understanding of what you're going to
[29:17] receive them shout out receive you have
[29:21] to receive something you have to get
[29:23] something when they come to church you
[29:25] come to get something or glory their God
[29:28] and once you come to get is beyond
[29:29] director of the word you've come to
[29:32] receive power or glory to God not when
[29:35] the press come down like nothing
[29:36] promised I am looking for no precedent
[29:45] and on my chromosome when the press come
[29:52] don't want you to put and that is the
[29:54] press coming on base that but this is
[29:57] this so I'm not looking for press I
[30:00] looking for the bride hundred looking
[30:02] for hunted somebody hunted me unto me I
[30:04] looking for power this is the promise of
[30:07] the father I will deal with that when
[30:10] that comes but I taken this year know
[30:12] did you know what I'm saying
[30:14] I will t be depressed I will be been
[30:16] hunted persecuted
[30:17] I will even order when that hand come
[30:19] but you see no this is the promise and
[30:21] this nobody can change that nobody can
[30:23] remove that from Saturday and nobody can
[30:26] stop you I'm accessing that because when
[30:28] Jesus had at Calvary he Buster fail from
[30:30] the top to the bottom and kill all the
[30:32] Old Testament High Priest stuff that you
[30:35] could have direct access no Mary no
[30:39] secretary nobody or get the Lord I sure
[30:42] I wanted to see that to my channel
[30:46] you have to see that you know because
[30:49] the Nicolaitans will come because they
[30:51] put all the anointed and power over on a
[30:53] man and gosh I hit that oh yeah I am
[31:00] here cause I hate that because he's a
[31:04] quarter of the audience I want to be
[31:06] among my people I'm gonna walk among
[31:08] them but among them I'm gonna live among
[31:10] them or give the Lord a shout hallelujah
[31:17] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[31:21] so Jesus purpose of coming and it wasn't
[31:24] the parade himself
[31:25] assembly Messiah I am God I'm no no it
[31:28] was not he came specifically to pay the
[31:32] price to release his spirit to get the
[31:35] produce of the sons way Adam field Jesus
[31:38] couldn't feel so Adam was supposed to
[31:40] reproduce sons sons of God Adam fell he
[31:44] couldn't do it telling the sex and
[31:46] reflection whatever it is but when Jesus
[31:48] come he come to release the word because
[31:51] you have to be born by the word you must
[31:53] be born again by the word and spirit so
[31:55] Jesus came to bring the word to bring us
[31:57] back to the Katmai even before the fall
[32:00] let us make man in our image and
[32:02] likeness that was spoken word man that
[32:04] was man to be born by the word and
[32:06] spirit so when he sent a prophet to
[32:08] gather all the scattered word the tide
[32:10] back in the world to bring on the Holy
[32:12] Ghost wants to bring back the image of
[32:14] God back a meal together so we are not
[32:17] normal sun's rays that's why Paul said I
[32:20] didn't come among you with words of
[32:22] enticing man's words but I came to
[32:24] preach that power that your faith may
[32:27] rest not in man but in the power of God
[32:29] your fear can rest on a man or get the
[32:32] Lord a shout I will say it again your
[32:35] feet
[32:39] your faith can address on a man you have
[32:42] the resin the power of God behold I send
[32:50] the promise of my father upon you
[32:56] there's a whole message myself behold
[32:59] let everybody else would be alive don't
[33:03] listen to nobody else Jesus talking
[33:05] behold I talkin I send the promise of
[33:11] the father upon you hallelu I assented
[33:15] to a next month
[33:16] I attend to some Bishop a servant upon
[33:19] you hallelujah but tarry in the city of
[33:22] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[33:25] from on high
[33:27] not perform shaking me pastor Han not
[33:30] perform fix Imelda hand on some teaching
[33:32] hand power from where that power coming
[33:35] from that power not come from the earth
[33:37] that Park on high and he left them as
[33:41] fast the Bethany he lifted up his hands
[33:43] and blessed them and it came to Pat
[33:46] Metheny same Jesus they was crying about
[33:47] on the m11 the Jesus Jesus gone he was
[33:50] dead and they crying and they sad and
[33:51] everything else alone this time you said
[33:53] he bless in the right blessing upon you
[34:00] wait for the promise of the Father Oh
[34:03] glory to God the breath of God is upon
[34:06] them the world is open up to them
[34:09] the faith is in their soul nothing but
[34:11] stop them they are afraid to shut the
[34:14] doors because the Romans looking for
[34:16] them looking for these disciples looking
[34:18] for this type of Jesus they calls it off
[34:20] by the waitin the reason until but
[34:23] they're waiting in a certain atmosphere
[34:25] they are waiting idolan there with the
[34:28] frustration of setup how long no reason
[34:30] no and all these 40 years moody not
[34:32] talking that kind of talk did not with
[34:34] it in that spirit they know what is
[34:36] faithful then no God can't lie then
[34:39] they could hold to the promise they know
[34:41] they can have confidence in what court
[34:43] said or glory their court so they are
[34:45] waiting they're waiting on something
[34:47] people laughs on an ember this the
[34:49] waited we will claim to have this and
[34:51] claim to have that but they still with
[34:52] him or plural accord because man didn't
[34:55] make the promise and man can keep the
[34:57] promise and God is big enough to promise
[34:59] if he's big enough to promise he is big
[35:01] enough to bring his promise to pass or
[35:03] give the Lord a show tonight I will say
[35:06] it again if God big enough to make a
[35:08] promise he is be enough to bring that
[35:09] promise to pass I don't care what the
[35:12] circumstances look like now I get an
[35:17] excited little God that is why I read
[35:22] the scripture here observing the will
[35:23] shall not show what does that mean it
[35:26] means you don't regard the circumstance
[35:30] you don't regard what your eyes see
[35:33] you don't regard what their ears hear
[35:35] that is nothing for you you're not
[35:38] regarded not much anybody else in your
[35:40] news hole either but when everybody
[35:43] watching you are showing when you don't
[35:45] want to review I read them you will do
[35:47] exactly opposite so what all the sense
[35:50] unhuman the sea realm is hot enough
[35:52] hallelujah praise God
[35:54] [Applause]
[35:56] so we're not observing the wind
[36:01] we have observing anything external
[36:04] focus on the promise
[36:07] the promise of the Father and when you
[36:09] walk probably go to Gaza he that
[36:13] observer the wind shall not sow god I
[36:17] can't look at the condition everybody
[36:22] with a very bright condition to act the
[36:26] right at most right everything will be
[36:28] nice and and and already eyes had to see
[36:31] and the ears hear the convey unjust and
[36:34] the brightest completely opposite to
[36:35] that because when a mulatto Sarah if
[36:38] Abram taken Sarah looks Abram you sure
[36:43] are you sure
[36:46] but because of what was revealed to
[36:48] Abraham it was who save as looks and
[36:51] condition and wrinkle and age was
[36:54] irrelevant
[36:55] Barbossa did conquer things are not as
[36:57] though they were he flipped the script
[37:00] on the devil when the devil expect him
[37:03] to be pressed he was joyful when they
[37:05] expect devil expected to be sad he was
[37:06] happy when the devil expectable citizen
[37:09] though he was standing up or glory there
[37:11] Gordon and court and court say that his
[37:14] fate and I have proven that and paintin
[37:17] fountain that kind of faith as
[37:19] righteousness
[37:21] do I wrote in the host PC corner and
[37:25] working with this human Instagram thing
[37:30] [Music]
[37:32] unless you come to the spot to
[37:34] demonstrate active feet you just a new
[37:36] flesh natural believer halle-loo that's
[37:41] why I say out of a group of the true see
[37:42] they would call would represent a
[37:44] beloved bride because in that group of
[37:46] the to seat of the world who have
[37:47] natural and spiritual and the spiritual
[37:49] could be called out because the
[37:51] spiritual is the seed of Abraham or
[37:53] glory to God do you believe that still
[37:56] trying to come to know something he can
[37:57] they pass he blessed them he parted from
[37:59] them tied up at the heaven and they
[38:01] worship Him
[38:02] and they returned to Jerusalem with with
[38:05] smiles no if I see that here you know
[38:07] smiles and Joy's are the same thing I
[38:09] know yeah yeah smile and joy joy listen

[38:27] had great joy and that great joy now

[38:36] home continually temple praising and
[38:39] blessing God as I'm Big Shot staying

[38:42] channel moving from church to church the
[38:44] channel moving this is and they were
[38:51] continually in the temple praising and
[38:53] blessing God so they were in an
[38:55] atmosphere of worship they worship in a
[38:58] revelation

[43:46] Lord may be seated
[43:48] all right let's read something you know
[43:52] [Applause]
[43:56] God promised that he would send us a
[43:59] true prophet of the true way with a
[44:03] message to return to the original Word
[44:07] of God and the fate of the fathers what
[44:12] for
[44:13] here the continuation to bring down the
[44:16] power of the Holy Ghost amongst the
[44:19] people
[44:24] so let's break it up now he promised to
[44:29] send a light up of it to bring us back
[44:32] to original world and the faith of the
[44:37] fathers to bring down the power of the
[44:41] Holy Ghost among the people with a power
[44:45] that will raise her above these things
[44:49] and take him at that time
[44:54] so work can't take the bright in so why
[45:02] the church is not crying for power
[45:03] because you know why they think they
[45:05] have it already
[45:06] the screwed the messed up so they kept
[45:11] Christ feared because I think they have
[45:13] it already and they got it to get but
[45:16] tonight I am Telling You wait for the
[45:21] promise of the Father
[45:22] Oh give the Lord some praises because
[45:26] it's coming who want to laugh let them
[45:29] laugh you wanna make fun let them fun
[45:32] one new name who are injured who have
[45:35] mighty engine who measure any temporal
[45:38] who have Michael and this side and gable
[45:41] on that side of the elements who is God
[45:44] who is the Holy Ghost
[45:48] is that all kind of revelations or all
[45:51] kinda thing you know yeah
[45:57] let's continue he said no watch let me
[46:01] see let me just know what you're talking
[46:06] about adoption you know please love a
[46:07] son
[46:07] please love a son right take him out a
[46:10] certain please have a ceremony before
[46:12] angels and please him positionally what
[46:15] he is in the body of Christ then that
[46:19] person has the authority let me say this
[46:22] if you want me to be a fanatic
[46:24] now all this adoption talk is not a
[46:25] question of sonship and is a question of
[46:28] behavior it's not the question of
[46:30] Simmons and teachings and revelation
[46:34] speech will be any pulpit adoption is
[46:37] really based upon behavior I don't think
[46:40] you get that if that is not so then
[46:44] sisters can be a doctor because this is
[46:45] the bridge so the mighty sermon that is
[46:49] behind the pulpit does not what been
[46:50] adopted
[46:51] Gordana doctor listen Manila got adopted
[46:54] in prison
[46:58] and forgot to adopt the person the
[47:00] behavior of that person have to be
[47:02] examined not by men but by God so he
[47:08] have the Holy Spirit the tutor the guide
[47:11] to report back to the father on people's
[47:14] behavior so then he said behold I come
[47:17] with me my reward with me to reward
[47:19] every man according to his Will shall be
[47:22] so we don't have to boss we don't have
[47:25] to raise a big flag the words will speak
[47:28] for itself the results will speak for
[47:31] itself one and one will or is equal to
[47:34] you could never make one on one tree
[47:39] much stuff to add up so when you said he
[47:42] must I don't know if you know something
[47:43] not right you must not add enough he
[47:46] must have to add up all praising of the
[47:48] Lord are you with me now so the only
[47:51] issue become not sons either brother is
[47:53] a suddenly the sun little sun know it
[47:55] what kind do I am the issue is not sons
[48:02] and daughters is what kind of daughter
[48:03] is what kind of a son I know your son I
[48:06] know your daughter but what pain and
[48:11] that trying have to do with your
[48:14] behavior
[48:17] not belief that's a big one that's a big
[48:21] one let me say again not belief but
[48:26] behavior because a lot of people
[48:28] confessing beliefs but the people behave
[48:31] is horrible the behavior is nasty
[48:34] the behaviors evil and jealous and
[48:36] wicked the behavior is intentionally
[48:39] evil and they'll in church hallelujah
[48:47] so many acquired by the shout but a few
[48:52] could be called by the voice hallelujah
[48:56] I say this with the show-quality kinda
[48:59] believers william branham malachi falls
[49:03] short message of calls three trains but
[49:06] only one can go in the rapture they
[49:09] believe i believe a shame
[49:10] hallelujah it called virgins but only
[49:15] the wiser because a wife and foolish
[49:18] it's a wise behavior and foolish
[49:20] behavior Alleluia is a wise action and
[49:23] foolish actions
[49:24] oh come on come on now come on now
[49:28] a wise version is a wise version not a
[49:30] stupid version not the foolish version
[49:33] but a wise version she'd know she has to
[49:35] get extra oil or glory to God and she
[49:41] this version is prepared to do whatever
[49:43] is necessary
[49:44] oh I love that tonight whatever is
[49:47] necessary to get extra Oh glory to God
[49:50] so you don't want to be barely a

[55:08] Joelle - sure well descripton Izod 28

[55:17] so they had it clear
[55:19] Peter fish and man can read and write we
[55:21] know the scriptures you know what become

[55:24] the Prophet George Baker he gathered
[55:26] from Jesus Jesus fit everything into
[55:29] them so that they will look for the
[55:31] correct thing but what something
[55:34] teaching and doctrine couldn't bring
[55:35] clarity it takes the dynamics to kill
[55:39] the confusion right we're right where I

[1:30:27] good it's one of my favorites I have
[1:30:29] favorite schools the one my favorite
[1:30:31] like Israel back in a homeland she was
[1:30:34] automatically she was just automatically
[1:30:36] put there why national force put her in
[1:30:40] a place true Hitler
[1:30:43] Eichmann Stalin God use them to drive
[1:30:46] his right back to the homeland he said
[1:30:48] it gentle hand of Jehovah guiding them
[1:30:50] back all glory to God gentle hand six
[1:30:54] million Jews died and it's called a
[1:30:57] gentle hand of Jehovah gotten back to
[1:30:58] the promised land guiding them into
[1:31:01] position is I'm going to say something
[1:31:03] you ready he's a national force but
[1:31:06] Israel in the homeland national force
[1:31:09] will put the church in the World Council
[1:31:11] of Churches but the power of God will
[1:31:16] put the people in the bright you want to
[1:31:21] be in the bright it takes the power of
[1:31:24] God to put you inside idea not a man not
[1:31:27] a church not a doctrine not a Titian not
[1:31:30] a revelation and will take the power of
[1:31:32] God let me say I gave not a man not a
[1:31:36] church not a doctrine not a teaching but
[1:31:38] the power of God whatever we teach what
[1:31:42] I we preach it has to produce the power
[1:31:45] of God
[1:31:47] let's finish the quote and we gonna
[1:31:49] close so I'm thinking edges on national
[1:31:52] force put Ethan on homeland national
[1:31:54] force will put the church in the work on
[1:31:56] searches but the power of God will put
[1:31:59] the people in the bride the world forces
[1:32:02] this way the world force is that way but
[1:32:04] court forces upward the Spirit of God
[1:32:06] which is the word of God cause my word
[1:32:09] his spirit and life will put the bride
[1:32:12] in her place cause she will recognize
[1:32:15] the positional word then she's in Christ
[1:32:18] we'll put her in a place no national
[1:32:21] force will do it if all Peter needed was
[1:32:25] his understanding to be opened and the
[1:32:28] book to be open then there was no need
[1:32:30] for him to win yup a room Peter could
[1:32:34] have explained the people I know what
[1:32:36] God said in the world Peter could have
[1:32:38] explained what Jesus explained he could
[1:32:41] have shared what Jesus said to them
[1:32:42] because of the others but Jesus tell
[1:32:44] them listen man but all you know with
[1:32:47] all your understand in the upper room
[1:32:49] yeah to wait for the promise of the
[1:32:51] Father

[1:32:53] Jerusalem until until until you receive
[1:32:59] power from on high
[1:33:00] when they receive that you'll be

[1:33:04] revelation but by power and butter
[1:33:07] Branham said gourville call some aside
[1:33:08] some sons aside by power by
