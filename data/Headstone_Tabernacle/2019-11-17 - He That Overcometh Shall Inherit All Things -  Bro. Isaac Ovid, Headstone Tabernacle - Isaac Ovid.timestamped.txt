[22:13] [Music]
[22:14] while we're standing let's turn to our
[22:16] scriptures greet you in the precious
[22:19] name of Jesus I want to read two
[22:24] portions of scripture reading from
[22:27] second Peter 3 and reading from verse 1
[22:32] certainly a great privilege to be in a
[22:34] house of the Lord
[22:40] second Peter 3 and reading from verse 1
[22:43] this second epistle beloved I now write
[22:47] unto you in both which I stir up your
[22:51] pure Minds by way of remembrance that II
[22:55] may be mindful of the words which was
[22:57] spoken before by the holy prophets and
[22:59] of the commandment of us the apostles of
[23:03] the Lord and Savior now Peter is
[23:05] speaking here and
[23:07] this is in essence the last text we
[23:10] would have of Peter and there's
[23:12] something that I find very special about
[23:14] last words I was sharing with the young
[23:16] people yesterday that last words are
[23:19] important they have a certain weight if
[23:21] you know is the last you're going to be
[23:23] speaking you approach things a certain
[23:25] way as someone is preparing to leave the
[23:27] earth they're very careful with what
[23:29] they say because this may be the last
[23:30] time that they're seeing something so
[23:32] peter has been very careful with how
[23:34] he's speaking here knowing this first
[23:36] was three that they shall come in the
[23:38] last days scoffers walking after their
[23:40] own lusts and seeing where is the
[23:43] promise of his coming for since the
[23:46] father's fell asleep all things continue
[23:48] as the world from the beginning of
[23:51] creation for this they willingly are
[23:55] ignorant in other words they are making
[23:57] a choice to be ignorant in other words
[24:00] they know better but they are pushing
[24:03] aside what they know they are willingly
[24:04] ignorant that by the Word of God the
[24:08] heavens were of old and the earth
[24:09] standing out of the water and in the
[24:13] water whereby the world that then was
[24:15] being overflowed with water perish but
[24:18] the heavens and the earth which I know
[24:20] by the same word are kept in store so
[24:23] the word created and the word is also
[24:25] keeping in store so it's the word that
[24:28] is keeping you here it's the word that's
[24:30] keeping you alive it's the word that is
[24:33] keeping you moving without the word you
[24:35] have nothing because the word is God can
[24:37] the church say man reserved unto fire
[24:39] against the day of judgment and
[24:41] perdition of ungodly men but beloved be
[24:45] not ignorant of this one thing that one
[24:48] day is with the Lord as a thousand years
[24:50] and a thousand years as one day and the
[24:52] Lord is not slack concerning his promise
[24:55] as some men count slackness but is
[24:58] long-suffering to us-ward not willing
[25:01] that any should perish but that all all
[25:05] in English means all although means some
[25:09] all should come to repentance so it's
[25:11] God's desire that all should come to
[25:13] repentance and he goes on but the day of
[25:15] the Lord shall come as a thief in the
[25:17] night
[25:17] into which the heavens shall pass away
[25:19] with a great noise and the elements
[25:21] shall melt with fervent heat the earth
[25:24] also and the works at therein shall be
[25:26] burned up seeing them that all these
[25:27] things shall be dissolved what manner of
[25:30] persons ought ye to be in all holy
[25:33] conversation and godliness looking for
[25:36] and hasting unto the coming of the day
[25:39] of God wherein the heavens being on fire
[25:41] shall be dissolved and the elements
[25:43] shall melt with fervent heat
[25:45] nevertheless we according to his promise
[25:48] look for new heavens and a new earth
[25:50] wherein dwelleth righteousness
[25:52] wherefore beloved seeing that he look
[25:55] for such things be diligent and this is
[25:57] the instruction to us that ye be found
[25:59] of him in peace without spot and
[26:03] blameless an account at the
[26:05] long-suffering of our Lord is salvation
[26:07] even as our beloved brother Paul also
[26:10] according to the wisdom given unto him
[26:13] had written unto you as also in all his
[26:16] epistles speaking in them of these
[26:19] things in which are some things hard to
[26:21] be understood which they that are
[26:24] unlearned and unstable wrest as they do
[26:28] also the other scriptures unto their own
[26:30] destruction EVF o beloved seeing you
[26:35] know these things before beware lest ye
[26:37] also being led away with the error of
[26:40] the wicked fall from your own
[26:42] steadfastness but grow in grace and in
[26:46] the knowledge of our Lord and Savior
[26:47] Jesus Christ to him be glory both now
[26:50] and forever
[26:51] amen and our last reading from
[26:54] revelation 21 with moving revelation 21
[26:58] verse 1
[27:07] and I saw a new heaven and a new earth
[27:08] for the first heaven and the first Earth
[27:10] were passed away and there was no more
[27:12] sea and I John saw the holy city New
[27:15] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[27:17] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[27:20] her husband and I heard a great voice
[27:22] out of heaven saying behold the
[27:24] tabernacle of God is with men and he
[27:27] will dwell with them and they shall be
[27:28] his people and God himself shall be with
[27:31] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[27:33] away all tears from their eyes and there
[27:36] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[27:37] nor crying neither shall there be any
[27:40] more pain for the former things are
[27:42] passed away and he that sat upon the
[27:45] throne said behold I make all things new
[27:48] and he said unto me write for these
[27:50] words are true and faithful and he said
[27:53] unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega
[27:55] the beginning and the end I will give
[27:57] unto him that is athirst of the fountain
[27:59] of the water of life freely
[28:02] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[28:04] things and I will be his God and he
[28:05] shall be my son may the Lord a blessing
[28:08] to the reading of his word you may be
[28:10] seated this morning in the presence of
[28:12] the Lord and he could give the Lord a
[28:13] hand or praise amen we are so happy to
[28:20] be here once again and we had a
[28:22] tremendous time in the youth service
[28:24] yesterday for those that were here those
[28:26] overhear you appreciating youth service
[28:28] yesterday
[28:29] amen a wonderful time we tomber the
[28:32] Great Commission and we're talking about
[28:34] Jesus's last words that he was sharing
[28:37] with his disciples before he left and
[28:41] the Bible says in acts 1 and verse 9 as
[28:44] he was seeing these things and fact let
[28:46] me just drop it here some of you would
[28:48] know it certainly and certainly for
[28:49] those we would do what Peter said to
[28:52] bring it back to your remembrance is
[28:54] that okay this morning October drove it
[28:57] I'm not gonna be too long but I want to
[28:58] take my time a little bit so you
[29:00] appreciate a pastor this morning
[29:03] amen what a tremendous time we had last
[29:06] Sunday and this week and all mark I
[29:09] can't even I can't even get enough of it
[29:11] and I feel unworthy to stand here this
[29:14] morning but I have to put my shoulder to
[29:17] the wheel to give him a little rest I
[29:18] love him said catch his breath a little
[29:20] bit Amen so I'm here to put my shoulder
[29:23] to the wheel this morning amen
[29:25] so in acts 1 and verse 9 and axud as a
[29:29] question to the young people what would
[29:31] Jesus last words you know I have this
[29:34] thing about last was a few months ago I
[29:36] preached a message the last words of the
[29:37] great warrior Joshua I'm seeing whenever
[29:40] somebody's about to leave the scene what
[29:42] they see they are very careful in what
[29:44] they say you had already talked
[29:46] stupidness when about to leave people
[29:47] serve up and Archimedean Suva when they
[29:50] come down to their last words that's why
[29:52] the Bible said is better to be in a
[29:53] house of mourning than the house of
[29:55] laughter because in the house of
[29:57] mourning you get wisdom you know so in
[29:59] in in in Jesus's last words you find in
[30:03] Acts chapter 1 and verse 9 and when he
[30:06] had spoken these things while they
[30:08] beheld he was taken up and a cloud
[30:10] received him out of their sight so it
[30:14] means that whatever Jesus was talking
[30:15] about before acts 1:9 was what were the
[30:19] last thing that he was talking about it
[30:21] was a things he was leaving with the
[30:23] people after his whole ministry after
[30:25] his three and a half years ministry
[30:26] after he went to the cross after he rose
[30:29] again after in his resurrection ministry
[30:32] after he dealt with him as he was
[30:33] parting with them and what did he say
[30:36] acts 1:7 he said unto them it is not for
[30:39] you to know the times or the seasons
[30:40] which the father had put in his own
[30:43] power he's the one controlling that but
[30:45] here is your promise he shall receive
[30:47] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[30:50] upon you so he mansion the disciples are
[30:52] now taking these notes now there they
[30:54] have already experienced a lot and he's
[30:55] about to leave and this is his word to
[30:57] them he shall receive power after that
[31:00] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and it
[31:02] doesn't end there and ye shall be
[31:05] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[31:09] in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[31:12] uttermost part of the
[31:14] and that is what he was talking about
[31:16] and while he was saying this Jesus began
[31:19] to disappear from them while he was
[31:21] sharing this with them he began to move
[31:24] from them so he left them with a promise
[31:26] of power and a promise of being a
[31:28] witness and a witness is not a here see
[31:31] a thing is not somebody tell me that
[31:33] that you could be healed
[31:35] a witness is jesus healed me so I could
[31:38] tell you what it did for me Jesus
[31:41] changed me so I can tell you by my own
[31:44] personal experience with a pillar of
[31:47] fire that he did it for me not if he did
[31:50] it for the pasta but if he did it for me
[31:52] then he could do it for you and unless
[31:55] you have your own experience you cannot
[31:57] be a witness so we want experience
[32:01] witnesses we want witnesses who've been
[32:04] in the backside of the desert we want
[32:06] witnesses who a pin through the fire pin
[32:08] through the flood been through all kind
[32:10] of trials but you could all see you been
[32:13] through the blood can the church say man
[32:16] that's what we need with this is and he
[32:19] said witnesses in Jerusalem in other
[32:21] words right where you are right now
[32:22] you're supposed to be your witness
[32:24] you're supposed to be a witness in your
[32:26] house on your job in your school even in
[32:30] the church give you another witness
[32:32] there's something wrong with you because
[32:34] you supposed to be a witness everybody
[32:37] in your neighborhood of Jerusalem
[32:38] wherever your Jerusalem is you should
[32:41] know that you know Jesus and Jesus knows
[32:44] you it's two sides of this you must know
[32:47] Jesus and Jesus must know you does he
[32:50] know your name this morning does he know
[32:53] where you come from
[32:54] does he know where you've been this
[32:55] morning can the church give a lot of
[32:58] shout of praise hallelujah you may be
[33:04] seated
[33:04] I'm not preaching it I'm just recapping
[33:06] a little bit from yesterday I'm trying
[33:08] to bridge into this morning hallelujah
[33:12] testing the temperature sister 7 gotta
[33:15] make sure the temperature is right some
[33:18] of you didn't warm up this morning so we
[33:19] have to warm up before we get into the
[33:21] word this morning some people came
[33:23] yes we'll have another service but
[33:25] that's not everybody not everybody is
[33:27] like that no no no no no no not
[33:29] everybody some people because we know in
[33:31] every church have three kinds of
[33:33] believers so it's expected it doesn't
[33:35] come as a surprise to us when we see
[33:37] people looking all this way and that way
[33:39] but when we come into the house of God
[33:41] we come to preach the sons and daughters
[33:43] who knows their names are under book
[33:46] condemnation has nothing to do with it
[33:48] your past has nothing to do with it what
[33:51] went wrong has nothing to do with it you
[33:54] are heaven bound you're looking for a
[33:56] new heaven you're looking for a new
[33:58] earth you're looking for sin to be
[34:00] dissolved you're looking for the baptism
[34:02] of the Holy Ghost and fire you looking
[34:04] for a snake in your heart to be
[34:06] permanently burnt until the devil has to
[34:09] release you
[34:10] he could have nothing to hold on to you
[34:12] he has nothing to say about you
[34:15] can the church say man Oh hallelujah
[34:20] you may be seated I said it a few weeks
[34:23] ago I said my past is under the blood
[34:26] and my future is under the seventh seal
[34:28] the devil has nothing on me and he has
[34:31] nothing under you if you made any
[34:34] mistakes put it under the blood whatever
[34:37] that ever sees lies because he has no
[34:40] evidence he has nothing on you your past
[34:43] under the blood your future under the
[34:46] seven shield Satan who you talking about
[34:49] you don't know who I am
[34:51] you don't know who I am he didn't even
[34:53] know who Jesus was if the devil didn't
[34:56] know who Jesus was
[34:57] you think you know who you are all power
[35:00] that was in God dropped down on the
[35:03] earth and the devil had to ask if Doby
[35:05] I'm not sure are you the one are you the
[35:09] one because God is a master at feeling
[35:13] himself he's a master at disguising
[35:16] himself he could use a donkey he could
[35:18] use a stone he said if you don't want to
[35:21] worship the rocks are gonna cry out he
[35:24] could use whatever he wants he doesn't
[35:26] need me he doesn't need you he can raise
[35:28] up a generation who will remember the
[35:33] words of the prophets
[35:35] and the words of the Apostles because
[35:37] that's the foundation of this church
[35:39] it's built upon the foundation of the
[35:42] prophets and the apostles can the church
[35:54] amen you may be seated
[35:57] it's not built on the pastor it stampede
[36:02] somebody over it's based on a show for
[36:05] nation but never has had a motive Korah
[36:07] his prophets it's based on the prophets
[36:10] and the apostles peter himself we read
[36:13] it and I love it - nobody time Peter is
[36:19] right in this Peter is making sure that
[36:22] everybody know there's nothing between
[36:24] him and Paul because when Paul arrived
[36:34] pause at the shake things up and he back
[36:38] said Paul withstood Peter to his face
[36:39] yeah anything real belly to do that it
[36:42] had to be God that was in Paul that put
[36:45] upon him to approach pizza and say Pizza
[36:47] ability have the wrong approach towards
[36:49] these Gentiles you can speak for these
[36:52] Jews but for these Gentiles this group
[36:54] is a different bunch of people their
[36:57] natural bloodline may not be Abraham but
[37:00] call them grafted them into the Covenant
[37:05] the hidden messages will be revealed is
[37:07] that God blinded the eyes of the Jews
[37:10] because he had some Gentiles that he had
[37:13] to print the pass and God only if he
[37:18] didn't do that we wouldn't be here Oh
[37:19] God happy this mornin but for this
[37:23] Gentile dispensation
[37:28] so pizza couldn't end off without
[37:31] letting everybody know Paul and I may
[37:33] have had disagreements Alleluia Paul and
[37:41] I may have had no misunderstandings and
[37:51] Peter chose to end his discourse and I
[37:55] counted long-suffering awful Lord
[37:57] salvation even as our beloved brother
[37:59] Paul he didn't want people to say I am a
[38:05] pizza and I'm appalled he said my
[38:06] beloved brother Paul also come to the
[38:09] wisdom given unto him it wasn't by my
[38:11] instruction of advice or due to our
[38:13] deliberations but the wisdom given unto
[38:16] him and written unto you as also in all
[38:19] his epistles so PJ is about to leave the
[38:22] scene but Paul as the master that was
[38:24] age the battle is already passed on and
[38:27] Peter is making an old hesitation look
[38:29] at all the stuff that Paul has written
[38:31] about and our prophet said Paul was the
[38:34] gold standard by which every messenger
[38:38] was supposed to be measured that's why
[38:44] even after all the ages but the Branham
[38:47] said I rest on the fact that I preached
[38:50] what Paul preached by the wisdom given
[38:55] unto Him that's imported for a joke come
[38:59] from heaven and see anything else let
[39:02] that interfere cus check that angel
[39:05] passport see where he came from and find
[39:10] out where he come from because that's
[39:13] not what I preach
[39:14] [Applause]
[39:15] Paul was super Sweden he said if I come
[39:19] back next week Sunday and say something
[39:23] different from what I said
[39:24] this Sunday let me be accurst also
[39:27] because the revelation I received came
[39:30] direct from God and I'm resting on that
[39:34] [Applause]
[39:41] come to church hey man we talked my
[39:44] rugged Christians we talk about tough
[39:47] christians christians with backbone
[39:49] Christians who are warriors am i talking
[39:52] to that group of people this morning

[39:59] the way are going I might forget to give
[40:00] it so I don't want to forget he that

[40:24] all do have no exceptions

[40:34] ever counted as part of inheritance it's
[40:38] counted in this thing called all the
[40:41] overcomers are somebody all is the
[40:43] inheritance that is all the inheritance
[40:45] goes to the son who overcome because not
[40:47] everybody but a nice will overcome but

[40:52] scripture if you find someone a
[40:53] qualified as inheritance material put it

[42:15] but you don't want to be an overcomer
[42:18] well yes well you have to have so much

[43:28] the body tired but their soul is on fire
[43:32] this soul is on fire can the church say
[43:35] Amen so I needed to preach back to me
[43:38] this morning
[43:38] I needed to carry some of this burden
[43:41] with me I can't do it alone but if two
[43:43] shall agree touching anything that's
[43:45] what my Bible tells me if two shall
[43:47] agree touching anything they can have
[43:50] what I asked for

[43:53] morning what happened when three people
[43:55] agreed what happens when four people
[43:56] agree what happens when everyone agrees
[43:59] the Bible says they were in one mind
[44:02] they were in one Accord

[44:49] teaching greater shall you do when

[45:17] fire more the spirit more of the word so
[45:38] let me finish wrap up what I was singing
[45:40] yesterday then touch this and see where
[45:41] we go so our 70 young people about the
[45:44] Great Commission that the message has
[45:47] also created a bunch of lazy selfish
[45:50] people who don't who only think about
[45:53] themselves and they miss the Great
[45:56] Commission which Jesus some said isn't
[45:59] the Commission given by a prophet this
[46:02] is a commission given by an apostle this
[46:04] is Jesus himself seen you shall receive
[46:07] power after you Holy Ghost is upon you
[46:10] and it's a conjunction not so it's a
[46:12] continuation right you shall be
[46:14] witnesses unto me in Jerusalem in all
[46:17] Judea and he goes on Samaria and it's in
[46:21] the autumn ook so what have you done for
[46:24] the kingdom who have you witnessed
[46:33] you know buddy Branham said if you don't
[46:35] testify you'll find yourself back soon
[46:38] one knee and let somebody recently and
[46:49] know when people ready ready to leave
[46:50] this little everything about you speaks
[46:53] leaving everything about you speaks I
[46:58] can come out to hear everything but it
[47:00] says you I am leaving this place how
[47:02] your approach service what time you come
[47:05] this is how your pre when he comes
[47:07] everything you do says the people you go
[47:09] in somewhere you see where somebody
[47:12] about to fly out doesn't even in fly not
[47:14] any state sending two weeks before they
[47:16] fly but they start back on could be
[47:18] excited to go ahead you know that way
[47:22] you going somewhere
[47:24] sorry they even tell it is fun and claim
[47:25] to get something and all kind of
[47:26] different things
[47:27] see them carrying bargain is like you
[47:29] will somewhere here and I waited waited
[47:31] without you we're good because they're
[47:35] making preparations your behavior such
[47:38] as just the people that you fly in on
[47:44] can the church say Amen wonderful but I
[47:49] just wanna go back into something here
[47:51] in the scripture we read even when Peter
[47:54] was speaking about Paul I want to take
[47:56] it a little slower even as our beloved
[47:58] brother Paul also according to the
[48:01] wisdom given unto him have written unto
[48:04] you as also in all his epistles speaking
[48:07] in them of these things in which listen
[48:10] carefully as some things hard to be
[48:12] understood so Peter say and know Paul
[48:15] said some things that is not easy to
[48:17] understand but listen he qualified is
[48:20] who happy problem
[48:21] which theater unlearned and unstable
[48:24] wrest that word rest means battle so
[48:30] people who are unlearned and unstable
[48:32] have trouble withi we think that Paul
[48:35] always mention there are difficulties
[48:38] with our challenges they know why Paul's
[48:40] or often as they do also the
[48:45] scriptures so it's not just Paul's if
[48:46] you have a problem with their
[48:48] preliminary sketches unto their own
[48:51] destruction
[48:53] ye therefore beloved seeing ye know
[48:57] these things before beware less he also
[49:01] being led away with the error of the
[49:03] wicked fall from your own steadfastness
[49:06] so I want to encourage you church this
[49:09] morning that the world that we have
[49:12] received for all these years
[49:14] don't take it for granted don't fight it
[49:18] don't battle with it but embrace it as
[49:21] even what you don't understand there's a
[49:23] promise of understanding coming to you
[49:25] but have the right attitude towards it
[49:28] and be ready to see a mentor you would
[49:31] even if it rub you the wrong way because
[49:34] you don't want to fall into that
[49:36] category of people who have trouble with
[49:38] these scriptures have trouble with you
[49:40] would I want to make that clear to
[49:42] everybody this morning can the church
[49:43] say Amen so we talked about overcoming
[49:46] this morning he that overcometh shall
[49:48] inherit all things and but I'm Adam said
[49:53] many times and we know it to be the case
[49:55] that you can't overcome unless you have
[49:58] something to overcome you can't have a
[50:01] victory unless you have a battle you
[50:06] can't win unless it's a sacrifice the
[50:11] thing about God is he don't let us
[50:13] choose his sacrifice he let us choose if
[50:16] God tell you choose your child your
[50:19] nature would be the truly trial and you
[50:20] know you the pass if in your school is
[50:24] na you right III questions for your exam
[50:26] and you answer did you concern what what
[50:28] you gonna do you will be foolish the
[50:31] true chuka chuka answer you will always
[50:35] put chickens in your New Ager answer if
[50:38] you give em much sense and hybridize
[50:39] that to a man says write your own tests
[50:41] write your answer and correct people one
[50:44] plus one is two less question 1 2 plus 2
[50:46] is 4 4 plus 4 is 8 I said my whole paper
[50:49] submitted because of my nature would be
[50:52] to go to the easiest thing why would I
[50:54] want to put plus or minus a square root
[50:57] of B squared my
[50:58] for over 2 e and work the square root
[51:01] and I didn't approve something that no
[51:03] that's not our nature but when it comes
[51:06] to God God designs trials for us not as
[51:10] a collective so you can't look at
[51:14] somebody else trial and say well well
[51:16] yes he if I was he I wish I had his
[51:18] trial you know how his back make you
[51:25] looking at it and you think you couldn't
[51:26] handle any style and you're back at
[51:29] least I don't know you don't know what
[51:31] he had telling you about each other it
[51:34] might sound simple but the reality is
[51:36] somehow we look around and be like
[51:37] nobody but God and dealing with you in
[51:39] the context of anybody else
[51:41] he has no grandchildren and he only has
[51:44] sons and daughters and he has taken time
[51:46] to look at what you need and create
[51:49] situations are wrong your life
[51:51] specifically designed for you
[51:54] your boss waiting for you tomorrow with
[51:56] a world trial he done anointed for that
[52:00] she didn't no idea at all ready to make
[52:02] sure that patients have a perfect to
[52:05] make sure that time he waiting for you
[52:06] you know you can avoid it this is not no
[52:09] ostrich gospel I put my head in his sand
[52:11] and because I'm not watching the boss
[52:13] the boss turn watching me that's not
[52:14] what we're talking about because if you
[52:17] want to inherit all things you have to
[52:19] overcome everything the same way Jesus
[52:23] overcame and he overcame to prove that
[52:26] you are also overcoming and he's to give
[52:29] you a key he said I conquered and he
[52:31] said you are more than conquerors
[52:33] because I live you gonna live also oh
[52:36] come on now the same words I do you are
[52:39] gonna do also as my father sent me so
[52:43] send I you
[52:44] the same Commission the father gave me I
[52:47] pass the baton of the Great Commission
[52:50] to you that you can finish the work that
[52:55] this bride will be a continuation of the
[52:57] book of acts can the church Haman can we
[53:01] give a lot of shouter praise
[53:04] I'm just encouraging you this morning
[53:06] how lonely this overcome anything
[53:13] because we have a promise Prince I
[53:15] promise to break out of this motel to
[53:18] put on immortality we have to keep
[53:20] nailing it down there is an eternal
[53:23] place there's an eternal age where
[53:26] there's no beginning and no end we want
[53:28] to break out of this time and break in
[53:31] the eternal age where we came from it's
[53:34] not foreign to us we were there before
[53:36] but God wiped our memories to give the
[53:40] devil us belief that he could take out
[53:43] his bride but when the time comes he
[53:46] will restore your memory Oh God and you
[53:49] will remember what you were before you
[53:54] were here and at that tea you wanna know
[53:57] that the father is come on now you're
[54:00] gonna remember the DNA and the genes of
[54:03] God you may be seated
[54:11] it's only when your memory is restored
[54:13] could you walk into all that is your
[54:15] zero with this new and this new
[54:21] technology might make it a little
[54:22] clearer in cryptocurrency is it in you
[54:25] will have cryptocurrency blockchain and
[54:26] the world is going they say if you have
[54:29] Bitcoin and you forget your password
[54:32] there's no way on the planet
[54:34] anybody could recover your money it is
[54:37] lost forever
[54:39] you see with the banking system now if
[54:42] you forget your PIN you could go back

[54:46] pin I want to reset a pin in this
[54:47] cryptocurrency work if you forget your
[54:49] password your money lost in them so if
[54:54] you forget your password you could be
[54:56] living on the all kind of pressure or
[54:59] cannot stress you don't know where your
[55:00] bread coming from but your money you
[55:03] know but you're totally possible nobody
[55:05] can help you get it but what is
[55:07] happening you need to get into a state
[55:09] of relaxation because I my stresses make
[55:11] you forget the child's make you forget
[55:14] but as I get more confident
[55:16] this walking this journey you'll get
[55:17] more calm and relaxed Jesus went when he
[55:20] was any poor here he comes chess enough
[55:22] he just gets up he's looking wrong he
[55:24] said peace be still and he went back and
[55:26] sleep that is what made this I've asked
[55:28] what manner of man is this when they're
[55:31] maintaining their undying appeal on
[55:32] water he was calm he was relaxed he said
[55:35] peace be still went back and sleep
[55:38] curled back up to see look at this man
[55:40] can the church say man so what will
[55:44] happen one of these days you will get so
[55:47] calm in his presence he got so relaxed
[55:49] in his presence when you got to know who
[55:51] you are where you come from and then
[55:53] your memories had to come back like the
[55:54] prodigal somebody came to his senses in
[55:56] other words he remember his password he
[55:59] remembered that in his father's house
[56:01] even these servers eat better and when
[56:03] they gonna remember your password and
[56:06] when you remember your password and you
[56:07] put it in your password opens up a new
[56:09] world streets of gold The Tree of Life
[56:13] come on now somebody preached back to me
[56:15] this morning so this whole great message
[56:27] of overcoming inspire us overcoming
[56:30] everything included in this world
[56:31] because this message of the seven seals
[56:34] and the finishing of the seven church
[56:35] ages is a message with a brown set on
[56:38] teaching that ties the man that's going
[56:41] to be redeemed in that church in the
[56:45] eternal church age at the end of the
[56:47] seals so this church thing is temporary
[56:50] but I Mikey I'm tired of children
[56:55] I'm tired of church this won't cost for
[56:59] the two of us let's have church you know
[57:00] church is not the end people treat you
[57:02] like you see and children means at the
[57:04] end we are on a destination and eternal
[57:08] destination commented service is you and
[57:11] part of the process get already this is
[57:14] the astronaut training room zero-gravity
[57:17] you're floating in his presence
[57:20] you're practising in his presence
[57:22] because we are leaving here for another
[57:24] place
[57:26] can the church Sam and Friends you may
[57:33] be seated
[57:34] this understanding is what pushed me a
[57:37] few weeks ago to preach the message
[57:39] salvation Redemption a perfection and
[57:42] adoption because they're people who are
[57:45] satisfied with being saved but that's
[57:48] not inherited all things they're people
[57:52] satisfied us to come to church but
[57:53] that's not my promise that's not the
[57:55] inheritance that when Jesus died and he
[57:58] wrote his will and he said to my sons
[58:00] who overcome I leave this and I leave
[58:03] this and I leave that and I leave that I
[58:07] [Music]
[58:13] read the will do we'll have real things
[58:16] on it and I hope you will say well I
[58:18] will take a cookie and that cookie in
[58:21] the fridge I will take a cookie butter
[58:28] in that list of cookie fridge stove
[58:31] house clean
[58:33] planet Universe constellation stars
[58:36] whatever it have on that will I wanted
[58:38] to know my Bible tells me once I
[58:42] overcome I'm entitled to everything and
[58:44] he will I can't talk about nobody else
[58:46] but once I overcome he that overcometh
[58:49] shall inherit all things if there's
[58:52] anybody else in here who wants overcome
[58:54] as well and tap into all things because
[58:57] this will is inexhaustible this is the
[58:59] only will that pivot to take and take a
[59:02] little run out because this bank account
[59:04] does never get bankrupt
[59:08] [Applause]
[59:12] hallelujah
[59:14] you could never exhaust him you can
[59:16] never take away everything from him he
[59:18] has all power he has all anointing he
[59:21] has everything can the church see him
[59:30] and go I don't have to wait until he
[59:33] faced over the gorge to walking where
[59:35] the Eclipse and then we to be filtered
[59:36] by the Eclipse to walk around among us
[59:38] talk to do it all at the same time he
[59:40] could touch by the gorge and touch by
[59:42] the Mundus and he could touch you meet
[59:44] you may be seated for a minute I was
[59:46] having a conversation with some
[59:48] Christian businessman and we going back
[59:50] and forth because it's different beliefs
[59:51] and listen some of these dialogue does
[59:53] be good just be good because it is
[59:57] helped you understand how much you're
[59:59] really blessed a notice thing when I
[1:00:07] talk now is he's smiling because they
[1:00:09] look at me like where you come from way
[1:00:11] I need to use wisdom you know so we are
[1:00:17] talking about this whole thing about
[1:00:18] about going into all the world and I
[1:00:20] learn it man this is a little bit man
[1:00:22] qualified scholar decrease upon decrease
[1:00:26] you see going to the only world is
[1:00:28] impossible I see well brother that much
[1:00:30] scripture because he back she will all
[1:00:32] God all things are possible so they say
[1:00:36] where do I embarrass him so we couldn't
[1:00:38] back and forth so you say what salvation
[1:00:41] is are indeed very watching as a simple
[1:00:43] one and one and somebody I say no
[1:00:47] scriptural because India Pentecost when
[1:00:50] Peter preached free chosen one says and

[1:01:11] said all I was in corn he ported to
[1:01:13] Christ
[1:01:13] all that is in Christ he parted the
[1:01:15] church the power is here this morning
[1:01:20] can the church say man you may be seated
[1:01:23] but a Branham taught us that the word is
[1:01:26] the conductor of the Spirit and the
[1:01:28] Spirit is power for the revealing of
[1:01:31] every mystery the tying up of the loose
[1:01:33] ends to bring it together of this word
[1:01:36] means there's nothing that's stopping

[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:35] somebody say man so I'm looking for a
[1:11:42] city whose builder and maker is God we
[1:11:47] get so caught up any simple little
[1:11:49] things but if we still focus on these
[1:11:51] spiritual things it puts these small
[1:11:53] things in perspective if those ministers
[1:12:00] who left Joshua who left Moses rather to
[1:12:04] go and look at the promised land and
[1:12:08] still looking at the scripture and he
[1:12:10] promised
[1:12:11] like just one Caleb did then I come up
[1:12:14] with a good report no but they lost
[1:12:17] sight of the promise that's what a lost
[1:12:22] sight of it was not 30 Giants were big
[1:12:24] because Caleb and Josh were looked at
[1:12:26] the same tires I had a different report
[1:12:28] it meant that they were looking for
[1:12:30] occurrence at a different thing that
[1:12:32] they were not prepared to look at that
[1:12:35] giant and call it a giant
[1:12:39] the promise was bigger than them many
[1:12:42] time when David look at Goliath he
[1:12:46] wasn't seen a giant he said who's this
[1:12:49] uncircumcised villain he can I say who
[1:12:51] is his giant yes he called my dad he
[1:12:55] said who is this uncircumcised all I see
[1:12:57] him is he not circumcised
[1:12:59] I know as for this Ian but I would I
[1:13:02] know he not circumcised and maybe not
[1:13:04] second tehina on with under this
[1:13:05] covenant so he you know have the
[1:13:07] protection I have so I don't know
[1:13:09] electrum million about because I see no
[1:13:11] uncircumcised philistine and my word
[1:13:13] tells me that if he not circumcised he
[1:13:15] is meat for the chicken just like a lion
[1:13:17] and me beer and where where's my sling
[1:13:20] where the sling soil so Batson saw this
[1:13:29] studying Oh to kill a giant for
[1:13:33] strategies for giant killin three ways
[1:13:38] to poison a giant five wins proven
[1:13:42] strategies for giant conquering the
[1:13:45] chronicle of all all the five times
[1:13:47] before died times fall in his room
[1:13:56] historians in there where Giants come
[1:13:58] from or just live how long has died if
[1:14:02] we have to wait whisky scenario if you
[1:14:05] get the weirdest thing out would eat I
[1:14:07] suddenly the biology of Jhansi chemistry
[1:14:13] physiology the mental state do they go
[1:14:15] crazy what can we expect because we
[1:14:17] don't know what to do we're sinking and
[1:14:21] they were just sayin wanting who is this
[1:14:24] uncircumcised Philistine
[1:14:29] quite like you see unlikely was and a
[1:14:31] simple feature no simple principles you
[1:14:33] know this Gospels are complicated it's
[1:14:36] fear to wield the gospel you see the
[1:14:39] simple principle I will come in I was
[1:14:41] there with my sheep and when a lion came
[1:14:43] the Lord helped me a property lion I was
[1:14:46] there
[1:14:46] he became I took a leap here this
[1:14:48] uncircumcised Philistine correct me mama
[1:14:51] wrong I was nearly a minute earlier but
[1:14:53] I was led to believe that we are
[1:14:54] mightier than the uncircumcised
[1:14:56] philistine
[1:14:58] [Applause]
[1:15:01] so what trouble you have in school I
[1:15:03] trouble you have on your job you are
[1:15:05] mighty a greater is He that's in you
[1:15:07] that's peanuts in the world overcoming

[1:33:40] claimed these promises because he had

[1:37:07] the Bible said Jesus was walking between
[1:37:10] two villages as it were he didn't take
[1:37:15] the main road it was deliberate because
[1:37:18] he had an encounter with these ten
[1:37:21] lepers because these lepers lepers were
[1:37:25] not allowed to be near the villages so
[1:37:29] for him to ever make to meet them he had
[1:37:31] to go out of his way so only he knew why
[1:37:34] he was passing that way and the Bible
[1:37:37] said they cried out to him if you study
[1:37:41] medicine and biology leprosy damages
[1:37:45] your vocal chords so you can't really
[1:37:48] scream so they've I've said they scream
[1:37:49] it had to be in unison for them to even
[1:37:52] catch his attention and when Jesus heard
[1:37:55] them he didn't lay hands on him he told
[1:37:59] them to fulfill what Leviticus says
[1:38:02] because under Levitical law if you have
[1:38:04] a rash if you have any mark if you have
[1:38:07] any kind of something formal and his
[1:38:09] skin the law was go to the sons of
[1:38:11] Levites of Levi let them examine you to
[1:38:15] tell you if you could go back among
[1:38:18] civilization that was a Levitical law so
[1:38:21] he told them to go show yourself to the
[1:38:22] priest which to them is like okay well
[1:38:26] he presided check us out the CV so they
[1:38:29] were walking out with I guess some
[1:38:30] measure of faith because if Jesus a go
[1:38:32] show yourself to the priest and the back
[1:38:34] said why they were walking God heal them
[1:38:40] but what is interesting friends is that
[1:38:42] it was not ten Jews it was not ten Jews
[1:38:47] it was named Jews and one Samaritan you
[1:38:53] would expect that the Jews who
[1:38:56] understood the context of the law would
[1:38:58] understand where their healing came from
[1:39:00] but they are the ones who kept walking
[1:39:02] and this Samaritan who didn't even
[1:39:05] understand why he had to go to the
[1:39:07] prison he first please say well what he
[1:39:09] pleases to do with this let me go back
[1:39:12] because it had to be this man had
[1:39:16] something to do with it and Jesus said
[1:39:20] where are the others
[1:39:22] only one come back and it is notable
[1:39:25] that he's a Samaritan which is like say
[1:39:28] he's a Gentile here not under the law he
[1:39:31] not too caught up in the religious
[1:39:32] fanciness everyday but he came back to
[1:39:35] give things and God gives special
[1:39:38] recognition to him because he gave us
[1:39:43] friends overcoming is on in different
[1:39:46] levels to be here this morning your
