thank you for your presence and the love and the opportunity that you have given us to serve you lord it's just your grace we are what we are by your grace and we pray for a special visitation tonight not just here but lord all those who are connected lives all those who would hear it lord you would make a supernatural touch a supernatural visitation father oh god minister to them by your word by your spirit speak to their hearts and transform their lives because this is what the gospel is all about lord a lives transformed a sinner to a saint a rich person lord a saint of the living god father may you come among us in a special way and and be with us lord we are dependent upon you tonight we we can't do anything without you lord we we we could reach scriptures and texts and quotes but it take the spirit to give the unction and the witness father have your way i pray in jesus name we ask it keep your head boss wherever you are we have a special prayer request tonight uh it's for sister bernadette's sister alana stilling who is down with the coveted virus she's now at the cover hospital on the ventilation and she wants to also pray for two children that will be well with them so let's pray father god we pray tonight for atlanta still in that your holy spirit will visit her father and remove her from under that ventilation father that should be completely delivered father toucher and healer and look over the lives of the two children father visit them in a special way tonight in the name of jesus we love you lord we adore you we know you are the same yesterday then forever and lord you're waiting on people how hearts and lies are prepared that you could send on your spirit that you could say there is my spirit flowing freely so let your spirit fall freely tonight and heal and touch in jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you and thank you for uh being with us tonight i have two portions of scripture like to read uh from isaiah chapter six we want to read from one to eight and also from second corinthians four we want to read from verse 1 to 18. reading isaiah 6 reading from verse 1 in the year that king uzziah died i saw the lord sitting up on the throne high and lifted up his strain filled the temple above it stood the cell phones each one had six wings with twain he covered his face with twain he covered his feet with twain he did fly and one cried unto another said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said i woe is me if i'm undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a life call in his hand which he had taken from the tongue some of the altar laid it upon my mouth and said lord this have touched my lips that iniquity is taken away thy sin purged and also i hear the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send who will go for us then said here am i send me from ii corinthians uh chapter four we're gonna read from verse one paul speaking therefore seeing we have this ministry we have received mercy we faint not but i've renounced the hidden things of dishonesty so this is real quality spirit at the ministry level but we have renounced the hidden things of this honesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god but if our gospel be heard it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world had blinded the minds of them which believe not at least the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is in the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for christ's sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness had shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled in every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in the spear persecuted but not for satan cast down but not destroyed always burn about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh like how specific he is speaking about it life of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh verse 12 so then death worketh in us but life in you we have in the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believe and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raise up the lord jesus shall raise us up also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are of yours for your sakes that the abundant grace my true the thanksgiving of many redone to the glory of god for which cause we think not but do our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worked for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory why we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen i turn on may god bless his word let's pray one more time father i thank you for your word tonight the scriptures and only you could put it together father and make sense out of it and make life out of it and and speak truth to your people follow once again i ask you take me out of the way and be glorified in our midst tonight in jesus name we ask at him and you may be seated praise the name of the lord appetite tonight tonight influenced by the word that's the title influenced by the word and inspiration is a word to you press into the unseen press into the unseen hallelujah praise god because the things that are seen as temporal but the things that are not seen are eternal hallelujah isn't that something all right let's go tonight praise the lord all right the spirit of god is not something that it is cooled into you it is something that is predestinated into you by the hand of almighty god your experiences cannot be schooled or taught into you and this thing about your experiences we're not talking about teaching and learning and saying amen to the world we're talking about your experience the spirit of god coming into you is an experience your experience cannot be schooled or taught into you it is predestinated by the god's hand and god's foreknowledge into you oh praise god that's why i i enjoy and love the sovereignty of god how god does things and he does it to whomsoever he will isn't that something so then nobody could hinder you or stop you from getting a divine encounters or experience it with god and tonight we are pushing that button on the supernatural i was thinking that the natural man went out of the unseen of his eye and pulled an atom down out of the sky and split that atom in two that destroy human life and if the natural man that knows nothing of god and cannot know nothing of god except he be converted then his soul comes alive with the supernatural if he could do that in the natural realm what ought the man of god to be doing my friends the church is so far behind let us pray that by god we will move the church up the natural man with the natural resources is getting greater results than people that causes of christians let's press into the unseen and that's where i get it from press into the unseen he said let's press into the unseen the blessings are yours they are for you oh could i hear our amen wherever you are shout him in on that let's press into the unseen moses being born with his great gift of faith he was anointed and commissioned at the berlin bush to deliver god's people you see what great qualities this man had he was born for certainty god had a purpose and god has a purpose for your life or you've been here and if you can only be if you could get to that place how much trouble you will save god in yourself moses born and afterwards he was brought to the place where he was anointed notice the seed laying there with that intellectual conception with all the faith he was born to deliver his people and yet it never come to life until that light from the burning bush flashed across it the man of everything inside of him the seed the calling the words from his parents hallelujah the predestination everything correct but it couldn't come to life until hallelujah that light from the burning bush flashed across it until he seen something not something he read about oh glory to god not something he read about until he's something that he's seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it how that bring things to life what is it the supernatural oh glory not explanation the supernatural it brings things to life let's press into the on scene and i think any man woman boy or girl i think in the intellectual conception of what they think the word is can never have a full foundation stand until they have met that light that brings that word to a reality no man could do that revelation doesn't come from man hallelujah man can give understanding but revelation comes from god that's when the father reveal it that's when the spirit reveal it oh glory to god that's why he's asked the question who do men say i am meant to say whatever they want but when the father reveal it that a man talking that's god talking that's the revelation of god and upon that rock he'll build his church and the gates of hell could never prevail against it hallelujah oh glory to god amen amen amen so he said until then he said what i think in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth a woman or boy or girl can never have a full foundation stand until they have met that light that brings that word to reality i think no church in its practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be that church cannot strive until the supernatural is made known among that people and they see it something that they can talk to that will talk back to them that vindicates this written word i love that that vindicates the written word nothing wrong with the word but there is a supernatural to come to vindicate the supernatural world is that word vindicating word is that mysteries will negate the word it's the supernatural to vindicate the word that's why you say when omnipotence speaks the miraculous takes place that's when god talking that's when god speaking that's not man explaining that's pillow fire failed oh hallelujah and in the last days the pillow fire will be veiling your adopted sons god said so god can't lie hallelujah that word will not return void they are going to be adopted sons plural in the last days or give the lord a shout tonight hallelujah in the church today there are two systems working listen really close i want to see if you're going to see even on this there are two systems working in the church today he's i'm going to get this off my shoulder then i have it over with we all know that the word of god and the nominational system there are two systems at work jacob and esau one is after the spirit and the other one is after the flesh what is it esau and jacob was fighting in the womb of the mother even to the time they were born and so is the nominations and the word fight him one against the other that has been since today is a looter first reformation i hope that is simple enough that you can understand it see these men talking about men to come hallelujah if they pick it up if they pick up this and goes out with it they said press play thing no they said no playing back the tapes on the prophet not that if these men will pick up this and go out with it they can make more sense to it and to see bring it to a place you would i want to just lay the seed then hope they make it come to life all these beautiful seeds in this message that laying on books and tips laying there waiting for god spiritual scientists waiting for men of god to pick it up and make more sense to it and connect this with this and this with this and put this here and put this here and then a bonfire break out then a revival break out oh glory to god some some amen hallelujah glory to god them fail in the wilderness because the word that they heard wasn't mixed with fate oh glory to god two million people came out and just two went in oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god this message coming with a rude awakening hallelujah praise god god is alive god is not dead he is not a god of the message he is a god of the word the god of moses the god of abraham the god of isaac he is alive tonight he's not going to change hallelujah he will not play as if you as you have a book i got to tell you he's not going to say that he's got to obey the message got to obey the word hallelujah oh my thank you lord praise god when he was here he was born in the world he come here with a black mark on his name that jesus because questionable how does mary have a baby and she married and so jesus come undercover different kind of cover god had his soul so he had my black mark already so his reputation at his start wasn't that good because of how it was implied about mary they may believe no words are conceived so jesus and that black man how that god so marvelously brought him here just before his coming the age had got just like it has come recently into a backseating condition israel has been brought into captivity by the romans and they have been taken away and the priest has got to a place and got away yes from the supernatural part of god they that they have been teaching just upon doctrine of their own theories of what they taught so the priests at that time they got away from the supernatural part hallelujah and just teaching doctrine of their own theories and jesus said you teach for commandments the words of men making the word of god of non-effect hallelujah because when john came and introduced jesus right there it moved from the prophet to the prophecy oh glory to god in this message it moves from the prophet to the prophecy we are being influenced tonight by the prophecy of malachi 4. oh glory not gossiping a prophet that finished with the last is already come what is the prophecy elias brought oh glory the god of all this bride becoming a super church about this bride becoming a super race are coming upon his bride that he will be proud of hallelujah praise god so jesus busted them he said you teach the commandments the words of men making the word of god of non-effect hallelujah they're christian friends we looked at the unseen hallelujah the supernatural is what you do not see but what you believe and act on as though it was and what a tremendous bible study we had last night hallelujah praise god what a tremendous bible study we had last night with those four lepers hallelujah having a little conference they say if we stay here we will die if we go inside the city we're going to die if we go out to the syrians we have a 50 50 chance if they kill us be there already but if they feed us we might live oh glory to god and they made a decision not to go back in familiar grounds that's the easiest part to do when you see you're in some kind of condition you tend to want to go back to where you're accustomed to where you relax you don't want to venture out but by faith call it dingy fate they say we are staying here why sit here and die i refuse to die in this message oh glory to god i left the catholic church not to come and die in this message no no i reject that i reject the tradition of the elders hallelujah i reject every interpretation they want to feed on me i reject it i will be influenced by the word and by the word only by the prophecy brought by malachi 4 not by jesus will not by function of god recording but by the word itself or give the lord a shout not by a man from anywhere hallelujah praise god anywhere no man hallelujah god put seven angels seven stars in his right hand and bring a message oh glory to god i was telling somebody oh my god i see him for the first time but the brandon had pastor prophet t.j evangelist all that inside him easy how do you find holy side so when you hear the tape you hear the whole fight for oh people are going so far off this word i'll tell him i said boy brown wasn't 95 fold he was not in the fightful that is just looter wesley spirit man spirit that come back in the message but brown was 950 he was a major prophet major prophet nothing no fifo that five-fold prophet is not a major prophet that that that he come there at all with the greatest prophet that walked the earth in this last day to catch the mighty angel that cuts the open book that adam lost what was lost in genesis was caught back in this last day and you want to put him in the fightful that's nuts oh glory to god god have men to come behind to make more sense to this to bring clarity to this that you could see hallelujah how are you getting into god's presence oh glory to god that's the purpose of the message not to have church and pews and deacons and elders there is mechanics there's governments there's systems and forms hollywood administrations and order that have nothing to do with a man sent from god that have nothing to do with elijah walking down to the jordan and striking it and shorten open it because a shot of god is walking i need me to walk across jordan i have nothing to do with the power of god to strike the church it's struck gideon oh shock samson it struck the heroes of faith of all and they're going to strike this bride oh chloe if it's chocolate upon him they're going to strike this pride because he was the first one that came to maturity the first one to be waived and when his way would mean others coming oh glory to god we know a lot of time pass but others still coming hallelujah over 50 plus years past but others coming oh glory to god the sheep has already been waived not some man from america oh god a man sent from god oh hallelujah are some man from africa europe south america caribbean i'm not no caribbean man god put son a man not caribbean man solomon jesus christ failed in a prophet to wave these promises to us this wave over us oh hallelujah i feel good tonight glory to god hallelujah praise god and when the supernatural comes upon a mortal being it causes a conflict with the flesh it weakens the human being that's why daniel said fellas one dead john phillips one dead and that power hit the prophet he was back up in a room numb for days now you know rejoicing and jumping and arguing that's presence hallelujah oh glory to god that's power that's presence and isaiah was leading on king uzziah nice guy called of god god put him as a king honorable man hallelujah but he wanted to do priestly work and they warn him and tell him no don't do it hallelujah he still want to do it because he was blessed what's that word now he was so blessed he thought he could do anything i'm not talking about the kingpin trying to be priests i talked about the best part trying to do anything because you are blessed like brother isaac say not because god forgave your sins you escaped the consequences hallelujah you plan trouble you reap trouble because you see they don't replant it and you reap that trouble whatever man so he gonna reap oh god forgive you yes but there are consequences of actions and decisions oh hallelujah virtue went out of jesus when the supernatural word virtue and jesus in many cases went into a siege and he one person and left the city oh my hallelujah thank you lord a few years ago when i started there was none of that going on talking about the supernatural the only thing that this has done this supernatural has awakened ministers out of their sense bound realm into the place where they see god is present that is what the message need right now the supernatural the power of god hallelujah you're gonna shake people out of this natural carnal realm oh glory to god and those lepers hallelujah glory to god it was so dramatized last night one woman complaining to the king oh king help me say what's the problem you say the syrians already sieged bc's wrong the city and afterwards she said this neighbor say we're going to boil mine some today and eat and tomorrow we're going to boil your son she hide him and when the king hear that he rent his clothes what an experience hallelujah was really brought her beautifully last night and what did that king said he said today i have to find elijah head elijah elijah don't already know the man coming isn't that right and then elijah could say tomorrow to this same time it went 24 hours my god barley will be self sold for shekel in other words you have food you have everything everything cancelled everything changed overnight hallelujah what is he saying he said there's going to be a supernatural intervention that you can't even explain and figure out and elijah wasn't even trying to figure it out he just said tomorrow oh glory to god tomorrow and tomorrow is connected with foreman leopard hallelujah you hear that that tomorrow he's talking about is connected with foreign lepers who are negotiating hallelujah by logic as to what to do do we stay here in this church and die or do we move and live oh glory to god are we gonna stay in this interpretation and die we died for so long he said no i'm gonna move i'm gonna move where i didn't think i was going i'm gonna move i can't stay where i am i've got to move oh glory to god and as it began to move go of course i ramble god cause i ramble god calls them thunders to roar out and shake up the enemy's camp those syrians run they drop everything they think about the horses the fear that god put upon them the hallelujah and you talk about fear when god starts to anoint that bride fear going to take people because they're going to hear what the lord did here and what the lord did here and what the lord spoke here and what the lord manifested here oh glory i shall send my fear before you oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord jesus oh blessed be the name of the lord they dropped everything and then four men got food got rain men got gold went back and dealt the city you'd have more than you have needed hallelujah thank you lord you're the prophet 80 percent of jesus ministry was divine healing 80 of his ministry was on the miraculous side showing the people the supernatural god was working in human flesh and what did that prophet say the word was invisible until the word became flesh let me say it again so i don't have to argue with nobody let them talk the talk but the word was invisible until the word became flesh and when the word become visible when it became flesh then the word become visible how how how by manifestation of god that is the only way not more talk we word that's why the supernatural have to vindicate the talk of what is written hallelujah has to come behind us oh man i want a close up of this part with this my god this is something that i feel to share tonight about the spirit of blindness now mother i want you to look here to me you see me you see me good i want you to put your finger on my nose this was not blind can you see my fingers all right could you see my fingers now you can see them how many have i up how many now there you are mother you have your sight you speak what has happened satan a blind spirit now the bible said when the death and dumb spirit now the doctor would say it was your eardrums when dead your eyes went dead the nerves you know but listen what is it the only thing he says the nerve went dead but what made it die there was something taking a hold of it supernaturally it didn't die all over your body it just died deer now if i had a transparent ban around my hand holding it like that it will shut the circulation off all the sound i put on fingers wouldn't help the thing to do is to get loose so nature can flow again is that right well the energy the sight the optical nerve wasn't flowing in your eye because a supernatural being a demon a blind spirit had caught your nerve and holding it now he is gone that's the reason you can see better so the prophet wasn't talking about nerves and no he's seeing the spirit banging that nerve affecting the eye i went that demon go out person could see you are going to be all right you can see good now all right she says she sees well now god bless you my mother go off the platform by yourself rejoicing and praising god and then he said he said then how are you sister come forward you want to be healed of your eyes also don't you do you believe god if he could make that woman who was almost blunt blind and that last one totally blind uh can he give you your sight sister now i what i want you to do is to believe that this which is near now to bless you now if you will believe with all your heart that god will do it he will flow right down to you and heal you bless you your eyes going bad they're getting worse isn't that right that's the same thing it's the power of the devil sister doctors can do no more of it because it's over it's it said so it's shutting off the nerve there the optical nail the energy wouldn't flow no more now the nerve is not shot off in your hand or nowhere else it's in your eye it was in your ears then you couldn't hear now the doctor would say the nerve is dead course he just works on five senses but jesus said when the death spirit went out of a man the death spirit then the blind spirit went out of a man it's a spirit it's supernatural now do you believe that upon the authority of god's word that i have been sent here to pray a prayer of faith and that i will cast that spirit away from you you will get well come forward my sister oh glory to god hallelujah that is where we head in that is where we going oh glory to god because demons are supernatural and the holy ghost is supernatural oh harlow do you believe that tonight so i thought i would share that that that would edify you and strengthen you now this uzia he got lifted up he took the censer went to the altar which was for consecrated men to that office he tried to take a minister's place they tell him you got off the beaten road we honor you we respect you you're great man don't try to do that was he humbled no sir he said god bless me so i'll do what i want to do you say brethren be careful there because here we go no matter how much god has filled you with his spirit how much you have done how well you have been blessed you stay with the calling of god don't get caught off of some traditions organizational schemes and so forth come better back to come come back to the part you better come back to what god laid down at the beginning we find out this man when he was corrected instead of humbling himself and admitting that the word was right and god was right he became angry in other words he was ready to kick him out of the organization no he was very upset about it very perplexed he got angry i have to turn and say no you just wait a minute do you realize who i am i'm an apostle i'm a pastor i'm a bishop i'm in charge of this side message long time you know who i am that's that's the pride let's see arrogance notice people who afterwards they have small salaries they get big salaries they get bigger salaries afterwards they feel like they do anything no because they they reach there are more money i could handle and they kick god up usually when people get blessed they get arrogant they get and god looking for somebody the more he blesses is the more humble it becomes how they find that because pride and power is a very strong thing see so watch he said when you're corrected by the word of god listen you must be subject to the word the minister have to be subject to the word also everybody is subject to the word i don't care prophet pastor priest king it doesn't matter it's the word god straight not moses and moses god straight not others i'm saying there's a man that i speak liberty here too but god straight on moses who's the boss god is the boss go straight no joshua go straight out noah gaustras not all the brothers every son that commented god gonna be corrected straight in chastise and we are authorized by the word to try the spirits not to take every claim somebody make somebody claim this he said try it test it see if it's right if it's right work with it if it wrong bust it get rid of it throw it off so our authority by the scriptures is to try hallelujah praise god i don't care they come from justinville or new york or america or england or wherever try it it doesn't matter where minister come from try it see if it's right if it's right work with it hallelujah it doesn't matter where they come from oh glory to god you have to be influenced by the word you see all the time isaiah was influenced by usia he was lean on king uzziah when you lean and think that is not the word god of a way of shifting the prop and getting it broken for more for you and let you stagger because you have no more props you see you're leaning and when you're leaning and relaxing when you're leaning you have no pressure to do when you're leaning you have no fighting to fight because you're leaning you're being a man you're a priest you're an organization you're leaning on on the books and the tips you're leaning on you're pressing and playing you're leading all kind of stuff so there's no need to press there's no need to push there's no need to fight hallelujah let me sing you a little bit some people just lean on their own ability god give them their ability and they're not honing that ability they're not improving with that ability just going with natural talent and that is where that man get busted with the one thousand two thousand five thousand and god gave them the master give them according to his discernment according to their gifts the one with one thousand buriat the one with two produced two the one with five produced them hallelujah and the one with with with one have a lot of talk i know you're a hard man i know you're just repeating so i know this i know that and also why if you know all of that why didn't do something with it he bury it and say well just what you're giving me just want to give him back hallelujah same way for the last 40 years god didn't want that he said virtue active virtual knowledge god is in increasing multiplying adding god is never in staying how you are and if you are who you are last 10 years something wrong hallelujah praise god is every place you put your foot in not mocking time god is a god that's make progress hallelujah he's a progressive god abraham faith exactly love jacob grace drew the perfection he's unfolding something he's always unfolding something doesn't stand sell the pill of fire moves you have to move with it isn't that right oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah so when he wasn't pleased then what happened he was smitten with leprosy's anger raised the priest detected leprosy in his face leprosy represents sin when a man won't stand correction by the word of god he's full of leprosy blows up carries on what does that do it ruin your influence and this young prophet what a lesson that was to him then when he seen this king by the very thing isaiah learned here we go one of his greatest lessons listen to the lesson that no matter how great a man might be how much influence he might have when he fails to walk in light when he fails to obey god then his influence is ruined he took off the field i would say that i remember when branham listened to his mother-in-law and didn't do what god wanted to do he lost his wife he lost his daughter and that's still changing from being a prophet god didn't say all right as is you you heard the prophet no no god didn't do that and i am saying if god didn't spare him why would god spear you or spear this message people hallelujah god is the word we have to come back to be influenced by what is written by what is spoken hallelujah by what has been revealed by waters on the unveiled no compromise oh glory to god like i tell exact stay with the world regardless of what look go my feelings this one that one stay with the world whose ex-vets who angry with you angry let them get vex them get angry let them criticize them laugh but don't get god angry please god hallelujah stay under god it's god you have to fear not man man right now only have mouth do your talk hallelujah praise god fear god another thing isaiah learned he learned by this that god orders his man to his place not putting yourself in that place but god put a man in his place who want to pick fivefold and who that and he followed whom he followed who only followed who caller what i said that nonsense hallelujah i said some man could make a way for the fivefold it have don't have that in the word no man can make away from no fivefold is god places a man the bible said for god set in the church first apostle prophet teaches the violence and so like that then where around when long in detail put a magnifying glass and that he said when a church is growing in that the holy ghost is just as real as it was to pentecost how they groan and cry but when they are born and positionally born then god sets in the church hallelujah so the prophet bring the unfolding of all god sets it hallelujah is not fivefold like pentecostal fivefold and them spiritual man fifo that's not this this is the ministry of jesus christ in the form of pastor in the form of a prophet in the fall evangelist no politics no man trying to create his own kingdom and his own influence and fear of influence and they come to this territory and they're controlling this territory and they're not respecting the sovereignty of the local church hallelujah oh glory to god i love sovereignty sovereignty means no bishop no external forces no exploding influences you hear from god you speak what god put upon your heart that's it oh glory to god who vex laws hallelujah who upset that is the business who want to criticize criticize but we will preach the word fearlessly oh glory to god with conviction and revelation and vision oh glory to god we will stay with this word hallelujah the god that started this work is able to complete it oh glory to god and the stone hallelujah that the bill of refuge has become the headstone of the corner that's a prophecy oh glory to god and that's the rock revelation this church was built upon hallelujah this church was placed upon oh hallelujah hallelujah christ the rejected stone oh hallelujah stone the bill has build the building and they can't find where they stronger fitting hallelujah praises god let's continue hold david our man after god's own heart man david who's like david after god's own heart god away from the word thou shalt not commit adultery but if it was lifted up he thought well god will pay attention to this god pays attention to every thought you think of not this adultery you know every thought you think of let your torch be exactly right what does it matter is because he forgot he went away about it never forgot because he was still better but god puts a man in his place he will never send another when isaiah break out into this vision because the condition drove him into prayer it drove him into the house of god it drove him to have a supernatural encounter because it shocked him what could happen to a man of such stature hallelujah it's like how we say it boy a cautionary tale something to warn you that if that has happened to that brother that could happen to me even paul paul said i keep my body in subjection least i be condemned with the rest of the world i i have to get myself in order i i can't just take things for granted because i'm a prophet i am paul no he still have to subject himself he still have to order himself even said he that's striving for the mastery is temporary in all things he's not talking about novice or apprentice he's talking about mastery or give the lord a shout when that is perfect he's come he's talking about mastery oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god to these guys was talking about the level of spiritual excellence not just staying in baby stage he rebuked the hebrews of that hallelujah but to grow in maturity in christ where you're anchored where you're sort of like a rock nobody could move you i look at how big they think they are how powerful they are how great the revelation is nobody can move you because you have a rock inside your soul that the devil didn't put there and he can't take out or give the lord a shout in the house hallelujah thank god for that revelation oh glory to god wife or no wife husband or husband if the roof if you lost your house lost your money it doesn't matter what you lose you can't lose what god put inside of you all glory to god tonight we look to the unseen for the things that are unseen are permanent oh glory eternal things that are seen are temporary oh hallelujah you realize if the lord terry is coming will you drop down on the ground and somebody will continue on you realize we have no sense of permanence here we can stop the days the hours the years are just rolling on whether you're ready or not qualified or not study or not improve yourself or not it's rolling on you be careful oh see we'll wrap up yourself israel two million people they dance by the river they're happy to leave egypt it's 400 long years generation grandpa telling this grandchildren he will be delivered you'll be delivered the day did himself become grandpa looking for deliverance and here come moses pulling two people off two million people two million people that's why you have to hear the whole story if you take part story you get messed up in your mind bad story means two million people coming out the full story doesn't mean two people million people going in what did god see by pulling two million people out serious what did god really look at god was looking at all them who were getting pregnant in the wilderness because god looking for the next generation he know that two million we messed up is this joshua and caleb hallelujah how much funerals they have attended how much committals they have done with brethren that perish in the wilderness and they've seen a young generation coming up because god can lie if god promised it god cannot lie hallelujah i don't care if god cut the cut off the old heads he will cut off the old heads but there's gonna be a generation that gonna hit that promised land there's gonna be a generation that's gonna strike the coming of the lord oh glory to god even brother branham himself still helped me to live to see it oh god to save this these sons of god manifested when silver and gold have my none rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ he said he longed to live the sea god didn't let him live to see it he saw it in prophecy he saw it by vision and we are walking in that vision right now a vision that prophet saw oh glory to god ain't no word there's no text he saw it he saw a vision he said i see the bright call i see she's sealed into the kingdom of god oh glory to god he saw our super church he saw our super race is already done in the mind of god we are walking tonight in a vision coronavirus or no corona virus the virus can stop the vision the virus is enforced in the vision because sons of google stop diseases they will stop the plagues they will stop cancer oh glory to god it enforces the vision we are doubling up we in faith we are doubling up to believe the supernatural the same god that came among sinai hallelujah promised in his last day we believe in the same holy ghost not no more than holy ghost nothing on you holy ghost save holy ghost same holy ghost hallelujah the seraphims he called the berliners the beginners that that prepares people to come into god's presence he said the temple was moved hallelujah they are the burners of the sacrifice making way for the worshippers hallelujah they just burn the sacrifice to make way for the worshipper the saints and two wings they cover their faces i call that the presence with reverence two wings their feet he called that humility you compare that with moses take off your shoes wings they cover their feet and they realize them they're on holy ground is that right and when you're recognized on holy ground you wouldn't go into places that is wrong and listen be conscious of your littleness unless you heard that be conscious of your littleness be conscious of your littleness the consciousness of it how you can be conscious of it that is not normal we more conscious how big we are what would he have what we could do and everything else but this give a change mindset now this changes your mind and your attitude approach that you're little you're nobody your dust everybody beats it and see sun think about you being a greener sun and you look and see wow the whole bitch's son and you are one little green there and you think you are big you kind of like a ants raising a voice and shouting and shouting at you an aunt one aunt and all you do you take your shoes and just smash it like that cooks and all that shout out that's where we are that lands shouting shouting hallelujah defending arguing battling fighting sword fighting word fighting church fighting all kind of foolishness and god have promises here to fulfill to see who will be influenced truly by the word because this experience that isaiah had showed the quality that god expect is that a threefold key a tree level key is that a three-pronged key is a three stage that god allows or what permits or god wants for us to have hallelujah first one reverence second one humility and then he said now let's do two wings cover his face he was showing watch and then he two wings uh flying and that was wings in action two wings two more wings covered his face in reverence two wings couple of speech and humility and two wings he was an action what was he doing he was showing the prophet by this by this he was showing the prophet how his prepared servants must be how reverence humility and an action if you don't have the reverence and humility and your action it can work it must be all together so your season brother is arrogant and carrying on and there are plenty of action and drama it can work it can't work if you uncover your face and cover your feet and your action isn't going to do you no good because you are stood wrong it takes it all to guide you reverent humble and in action and that is what god wants this pentecostal group to be for god wants his church to be in action he said and they will watch and listen the people at pentecost they cover their feet they cover their faces they didn't care what the jews said they had a commission from god a word of god to go up to the temple to jerusalem and wait until the holy spirit came wait until the holy spirit not wait in our revelation that they are the holy spirit that's a lie die some hell hallelujah yeah yeah wait until the holy spirit came and there it was obeying his word oh glory to god because they were influenced by the word the word said tarry in the city of jerusalem until you be endured with power from an eye not until brother so and so come down to explain the revelation to you that's not what he's saying until you're endured with powerful on high now there is it brother so and so come to reveal the mystery that you didn't know until you'd be entered with powerful manhair no god was bringing power resurrection power because they had power before you know there was cast no devils and doing stuff that was temporary power and that temporary power is what peter draws sword with playing star boy trying to draw sword but when come the crucifixion night he running and denying because that power wasn't resident but this power that jesus christ appeared and said behold who received the holy ghost that power of promise that was breed upon them that was to be permanent that was to connect with what he said he that believeth on me out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water this fake he of the spirit which was not yet given or give the lord a shout he was speaking specifically about the adhesion well to break inside a man's soul change and transform his walk talk life attitude and spirit oh glory to god amen and they're in the upper room and humility bowing and when the church was laughing at them the same church i was laughing a bunch of heretics in the upper room they go on pentecostal they shouted their job jumping for face covered in the presence of god i want to be like them jews and a willing wall you know they said why are they shaking why they reckon so they wanted they said they want god to know they're not dead [Music] they shake him hallelujah oh god the church neither shaken faces covered in the presence of god listen what they were saying faces covered in the presence of god oh lord the upper room he's dramatizing you give the promise if there's any evil in me cleanse me lord that's the upper room experience take it out take out all these things out of me i want to be filled with your spirit you promised me the holy ghost lord i need it empty me i'll tell me upside down and shake me out i'm almost done musician they who were scared couldn't give a testimony out in the street and there was in the ultimate street speaking in tongues and in action and so much of people said these men are full of new wine hallelujah and peter said these are not full of new wine but this is that i've always said if this isn't that i'll keep this till that comes what is it they have seen gorge promise fulfill and it put them into action we just finally cover yourselves get into and then get an action and that is the backdrop of this quote we're about to read cover yourselves and get into action and then he says here this year what we have seen happen here should put every soul in action it should make a church that would make a revival here in phoenix that people will be flying from europe to see what's taking place they will say there's a place in arizona called the maricopa valley a city called phoenix there is something broke out here until the seven thunders of revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the bible is being manifested not revealed not taught not unfolded but being manifested oh glory to god there's a revolution packed and there's a manifestation part we could talk from no till the tribulation on the revolution part but if it don't get manifested we'll be all in the tribulation and that can happen because there's going to be a pride going in the rapture so there's going to be a manifestation part the capstone revelation gonna be turned into a capstone manifestation oh glory to god the capstone manifestation of jesus christ god final view to the world upon a bride hallelujah take the robe of that lady this is my wife oh glory hallelujah praise the name of the lord thank you lord jesus you already said the power of god the end time is here the angel has guarded up the loose hands we are here he's about to write those thunders don't write them seal them up on the day of the son of this last seven angels the loudest and churches the mystery of god all about god how that god is not a bunch of gods but one god all these things should be finished at that time oh my god the great battles back there got loose ends hanging out it ought to be all wrapped up together and when that songs angel calmed down and said time shall be no more. so after buddha brahman wrapped up the loose ends that wasn't his message they signed up things in the past next time something we didn't know about like tying up things that the messengers didn't didn't unfold when that finished don't come the angel what an angel is grace what was john the baptist to do introduce christ what was brahman to do he said you have a message out for my second coming and brother branham came to introduce the messiah and the messiah came down in revelation 10 which was son of man that's why he had a message come to the unveiling almighty god and christ veiled the prophet began to speak all these mysteries that were gonna catch that bride hallelujah i'm almost finished we're going to play something what happened isaiah saw a great man lose his influence and die he saw a man with great influence lose his hole because he failed to keep the word oh my we have lived to see that same day denominations are losing the influence these great denominations by their creeds lose their whole why they are trying to manufacture something to take the place of the office of the anointed you see there'll be no impersonation to the table this final thing is here it's be god himself doing it the word to the bride he said god himself acted at that time to fulfill the word to the virgin nobody and manufacture and call mary out and get married quotes i got books and say press play and listen to that no mary hear the word when the time came the angel appeared to mary hail mary highly favored mary oda on one question how shall this be the holy ghost will come and bring this thing to life isn't that right he said you will never be able to do it god will take his anointed and you cannot impersonate that office god anoints he chooses who he wills he condemns who he wills it is god that does the justifying it is god that does the choosing and he raises it up we see god made him king that's right when he tried to take himself into make himself a priest he couldn't do it we can make ourselves nothing you can't make bishops and prophets and so forth you can't manufacture it's got to be born in you we've got to be the spirit of god predestinated from the foundation of the world you get it you get in the presence of one you see a vision a true vision from god you will see how little you are like one brother tell me one associates our minds one time associate tell me bro your problem is you will preach yourself i said brother never seen that you know you hear the scripture here tonight we don't preach ourselves we praise christ the lord said i'm saying people believe you don't even cancel anyway that's what god tells the prophet that god they tell me that i'm not trying to get people believe me i have getting people believe what god promised god didn't tell me that you know so i can't say the god tell the prophet that they ever believe me no no no no no no no believe this die in the morning wait wait believe in me though god this promise can't lie if i conclude in the morning was he was he pointing believe in me are you trying to stay with this word i'm trying to bring these promises to you you hold to this and be influenced by it paul said follow me oh as i follow christ oh hallelujah as long as i'm following christ you can follow me anytime i move off run for your life oh glory to god hallelujah i'm closing what he did he confessed notice when he confessed hallelujah then come the cleansing coming into the presence he recognized he was a sinner coming into presence he was a prophet he recognized he was a
