[56:34] Him the plagues that are written in this
[56:36] book and if any man shall take away from
[56:38] the words of the book of this prophecy
[56:39] God shall take away his part out of the
[56:43] book of life out of the holy city and
[56:45] from the things that are written in this
[56:47] book he that which testified these
[56:50] things here surely I come quickly
[56:52] amen even so come Lord Jesus may God
[56:56] bless us well let's pray one more time
[56:57] father we thank you for the scriptures
[56:58] that have been read I repair coming
[57:00] interpreters to our hearts and Lord move
[57:02] upon the hearts and lives of the people

[57:22] the Lord it's always good to be where
[57:25] you could come to hear from God and if
[57:28] you change your mindset instead of
[57:30] coming to church you come in to hear
[57:32] from God you would listen and you
[57:35] receive direct from God so this morning
[57:39] our title I will execute judgment I am
[57:44] the Lord took that from the scripture I
[57:48] will execute judgment I am the Lord
[57:52] subject the token has to be displayed
[57:58] inspiration no free pass no shortcuts
[58:03] God's requirement must be met I wanna
[58:08] read it again no free pass no shortcuts
[58:13] god requirement must be met
[58:16] the even time message is to apply the
[58:19] token so we want to go straight in the
[58:22] world are you ready just to come here to
[58:25] receive fun to hear and to be edified
[58:28] and to be strengthened them to be built
[58:29] up a man we not come here to entertain
[58:32] you you come here because we believe
[58:34] that we have something to say to you
[58:35] from the Lord I just backtrack a little
[58:39] bit from last week you come like Adam
[58:41] like me what about him speaking you
[58:43] become from attribute to flesh to be
[58:46] tempted but when this life is finished
[58:48] here if our earthly temple nappedam naka
[58:51] be resolved we have one already waited
[58:54] now we don't have no permanent thing on
[58:56] this life here we only have a time slot
[58:59] but as the 70 80 90 100 that's all we
[59:03] have to leave here this flesh have to
[59:05] give up one day he told the man in the
[59:08] beginning the start at the dust thou
[59:09] shalt return because he came from thus
[59:12] the first man was not dust man the first
[59:15] man was the spirit man that was the
[59:17] first created image the first image was
[59:20] in dust man Gordon make dust man and put
[59:23] spirit man in dust man but the first
[59:25] created image was spirit man so you are
[59:27] not just flash flash you have to bow in
[59:29] a flash
[59:30] you were spirit Unversed and you have to
[59:33] come back to that recorded empower you
[59:35] in your spirit in your heart that you
[59:39] wouldn't walk after the flesh but you
[59:41] would walk after the spirit because the
[59:44] flesh had a law and the spirit have a
[59:46] law and if the yields of the law of the
[59:48] flesh you will do the things of the
[59:49] flesh but if the yields of the law of
[59:51] the Spirit people do the team of the
[59:53] Spirit you come here to get empowered in
[59:56] your spirit or glory no God you're in
[1:00:00] comments on knowing the flesh land
[1:00:02] you're commenting on the spirit man
[1:00:04] because you're more than meet the eye
[1:00:06] you're more than flesh and blood there
[1:00:09] is something beyond your flesh there is
[1:00:11] something inside your soul that's what
[1:00:14] the word come to address go glory to God
[1:00:18] Amen hallelujah hallelujah so we have
[1:00:23] never listened
[1:00:24] we have never become the word we just
[1:00:26] become freshmen not the word because we
[1:00:30] come from taught the flesh so you walk
[1:00:32] in the orginal ordinary because I'm talk
[1:00:35] to the flesh who could reveal that was
[1:00:37] in a prophet to reveal that we did for
[1:00:40] granted but that's a revelation that he
[1:00:42] was any accurate mind of God you can be
[1:00:45] loss of here trying praise God you come
[1:00:48] from God they went back to God don't let
[1:00:51] the devil tie you up he was not there
[1:00:53] before the beginning he is not property
[1:00:55] attributes that wasn't God's mind he was
[1:00:58] created in the beginning with the rest
[1:01:00] of the Angels when God created angels
[1:01:03] but you
[1:01:10] you may be seated but you see in order
[1:01:14] to stand temptation you have to bypass
[1:01:18] the theophany you have to come down here
[1:01:21] in the flesh to be tempted by sin so if
[1:01:25] you didn't bypass the theophany then you
[1:01:27] couldn't be helped you couldn't be
[1:01:28] written that ye listen whatsoever but
[1:01:31] God to the fall make you skip the word
[1:01:34] party but because you had a thought Pat
[1:01:37] a words that thought expressed that
[1:01:40] means the thought has to come to

[1:01:48] put the thought in flesh and your wasn't
[1:01:50] any lawyers and dancer with and Pappy
[1:01:52] was in fact it was invisible but that

[1:02:16] manifestation of the attribute that you

[1:02:29] bypass your tyranny or your word body or
[1:02:31] your expression you have to come down in
[1:02:34] flesh to be tempted by sin and if you

[1:15:41] the affiant of people's got a final
[1:15:43] piece of garment everybody had to look
[1:15:44] the same and they get the garment at the

[1:15:58] friend he's in normal oh hi hey
[1:16:00] oh it's just like that how you looking
[1:16:04] so different who you look is who early

[1:16:14] bush I thought I thought was what I
[1:16:17] thought was one you supposed to be
[1:16:19] looking one
[1:16:20] you see when that's the one garnet you
[1:16:21] don't know Richard a loophole
[1:16:23] you don't who have you don't know who
[1:16:25] have and that's what the Holy Ghost make
[1:16:30] us humble it make us one I don't

[1:16:36] up and dresses you are still one in
[1:16:38] Christ isn't that right what did the man
[1:16:43] say cast him out hand and foot
[1:16:45] they shall be weeping and wailing and
[1:16:47] gnashing of teeth because of what
[1:16:48] Bertram says he didn't come to the door
[1:16:50] not me you slipped to the window it was
[1:16:52] open and you take a chance and take a
[1:16:56] shortcut what he should have done was
[1:16:58] kept me the garment and then jumped in a
[1:16:59] window the only problem is the gamut is
[1:17:02] on the front door so he couldn't get the
[1:17:04] gummy could snatch one so you understand
[1:17:06] boy we can open boy nobody there not
[1:17:08] eaten no police go my god I'm gonna move
[1:17:12] it move it
[1:17:14] no don't my second idea to Ethan agree
[1:17:17] with the earth glasses sharing you drink
[1:17:20] like nobody else nobody about a man that
[1:17:22] you know because he can be a souvent he
[1:17:24] can be anybody didn't who yes it's many
[1:17:26] guests they have there is a man come on
[1:17:28] knowing all my guests supposed to have
[1:17:30] red orange yellow green and ego violent
[1:17:36] all my guests supposed to have seven
[1:17:37] colors all my guests I'm looking for
[1:17:40] those seven colors how come that that
[1:17:42] man don't have those colors out he goes
[1:17:45] no shortcuts not either start he that
[1:17:49] finishes many start the race but there
[1:17:52] is one finish in it there have been many
[1:17:54] churches start many girls are people
[1:17:56] better be one group finish that's the
[1:18:00] overcomers
[1:18:00] and then he went on to define the
[1:18:03] overcomers not a group who say but
[1:18:05] individuals it's not the dam that
[1:18:08] overcometh or a church body is he that
[1:18:10] overcometh so that group will be made up
[1:18:13] of individuals who are overcomers do you
[1:18:16] see yourself as all over come up you
[1:18:18] have to begin to see yourself as over
[1:18:19] come on
[1:18:20] you're still gonna take charge of your
[1:18:21] life or glory to God and don't be a
[1:18:24] driftwood and let the stream of life
[1:18:26] just drift you along Oh hallelujah
[1:18:29] praise God isn't that right
[1:18:32] thank you Lord Jesus okay here we go so
[1:18:36] Israel was to gather together to apply
[1:18:39] the token because it was exodus time you
[1:18:44] heard what I say
[1:18:45] it was leavin time and before you leave
[1:18:49] it has blood to apply because God good
[1:18:52] an execute judgment hallelujah
[1:18:55] against the will and the wolf system
[1:18:58] against Egypt
[1:18:59] so God couldn't judge his people along
[1:19:02] with the Egyptians he had to make a
[1:19:04] provision for them and we have escaped
[1:19:06] and he bring that provision to the lamb
[1:19:09] which had the blood so he give
[1:19:12] instructions a family a house a lamb for
[1:19:15] house if you're hopeful too small join
[1:19:18] with somebody else but make sure
[1:19:19] everybody on the inside and the outside
[1:19:22] must be blood and I would recognize that
[1:19:25] blood as a token that I can touch once
[1:19:29] that but is there is blood because when
[1:19:52] I see the blood I'm gonna pass over you
[1:19:55] if I don't see the blood I'm going to
[1:19:57] pass through I will execute judgment I
[1:20:00] am the Lord will give the law some
[1:20:03] praises hallelujah so they came out get
[1:20:09] together to apply the token and they had
[1:20:13] to have faith in that token that under
[1:20:16] the blood sacrifice that there will be
[1:20:18] under exodus out of Egypt that was a
[1:20:21] second Exodus and we are promised a
[1:20:23] t-rex or us the first Exodus was a
[1:20:25] natural and into a natural and second a
[1:20:28] second a third Exodus was a natural and
[1:20:30] into a spiritual baptism in the upper
[1:20:33] room but this Exodus is from a spiritual
[1:20:36] baptism
[1:20:36] it's a laminar millennium we are live in
[1:20:39] here it's a rapture train to get
[1:20:42] he never rapped Express to pick up wit
[1:20:43] Oh glory that Gordon and hallelujah
[1:20:47] so the token was their sign of what God
[1:20:51] was gonna do for them
[1:20:52] he was taking them up out of Egypt oh
[1:20:56] praise God
[1:20:57] so the token what's a token I took is a
[1:21:00] sign that the price has been paid so
[1:21:03] when you go to get the bus ticket you
[1:21:05] know Honda driving by the money you pay
[1:21:07] for the ticket and the driver takes the
[1:21:10] ticket the ticket is the token and at
[1:21:13] some Xena Mia Cara go and take that
[1:21:16] ticket and ride on a taxi and say listen
[1:21:18] taxi look look the ticket taxi was a
[1:21:21] wrong listen wrong please we don't take
[1:21:24] those tickets you have to go to the bus
[1:21:27] isn't that right so that talk morning
[1:21:29] walking sitting please so when God said
[1:21:32] that token he means that you have to get
[1:21:34] token and when you get that talking to
[1:21:37] Joe Vicario that's all right
[1:21:39] the board when the drivers see that cuz

[1:21:53] right hallelujah you cannot be denied
[1:21:57] because you are paid a price it must be

[1:22:06] Israel no other token will work it can
[1:22:09] be recognized and you cannot have the
[1:22:11] token until the fair speed then you are
[1:22:14] possessor of the token which gives you
[1:22:16] the privilege of a free pass what give
[1:22:23] it a free pass up the token so when

[1:50:26] applied in the evening time the token
[1:50:29] never come into existence until the even
[1:50:32] time Luther Wesley did never talking the
[1:50:37] token come in the evening time with the
[1:50:39] even time message mr. Burnham this is
[1:50:42] the even time of the age we live in this
[1:50:44] is the even time for the church this is
[1:50:46] even same for me this is the even some
[1:50:48] of my message and Dan I am going I'm
[1:50:50] moving out we have come through
[1:50:52] justification but this is a time that

[1:51:01] got to be done God's requirement must be
[1:51:04] met
[1:51:05] that's why selling you're doing look
[1:51:07] what anybody else does I don't care who
[1:51:09] do what go on the clip they here who
[1:51:12] want to do this want the West crews who
[1:51:13] want to wear pants want to do this

[1:51:21] friends is not a church affair
[1:51:24] [Applause]
[1:51:26] it's dr. Churchill fear the Bible and
[1:51:29] say there'll be two churches 151 else
[1:51:31] not too in the field who in my bed two
[1:51:35] days to that point and what laughs it's
[1:51:39] the individual why the animal Christ
[1:51:47] didn't come yet he was a real arm of God
[1:51:50] and the animal life couldn't come upon a
[1:51:52] human being when the blood left left the
[1:51:54] animal the life was gone from it it was
[1:51:56] a different life from the blood so the
[1:51:58] blood so God God accepted the chemistry
[1:52:00] of the blood that read physical thing
[1:52:03] that's what he accepted because the life
[1:52:05] of the animal couldn't come back but
[1:52:08] Jesus had a living soul in that right so
[1:52:13] when he died his soul his spirit could
[1:52:17] be released and come back upon the
[1:52:20] worshiper right then divided Christ at
[1:52:23] Calvary that's what you become born
[1:52:25] again because his Spirit released to
[1:52:28] break into your spirit let me offer you
[1:52:31] a new heart I will give you a new spirit
[1:52:34] I will give you and I put my spirit in
[1:52:36] your spirit
[1:52:38] [Applause]
[1:52:41] that's what he said could we give it all
[1:52:44] some praises what about say in this
[1:52:51] covenant today there's a difference in
[1:52:53] the blood and the life the token for the
[1:52:56] believer today is the Holy Ghost
[1:52:59] that's the token it's the Holy Ghost not
[1:53:03] blood chemistry but the Holy Spirit of
[1:53:07] God that is the token that God requires
[1:53:10] of the church today
[1:53:11] God must see this token he must see it
[1:53:16] in every one of us
[1:53:17] Oh glorious God you must see it in every
[1:53:20] one of us so I wanted to get up with him
[1:53:22] for the token I put it for the Holy
[1:53:26] Ghost I put it to catch up with you
[1:53:28] you've got to get a button fair

[3:04:23] says Amen you may be seated for few
[3:04:28] announcements we have quite a few
[3:04:31] announcements so I want you to pay close
[3:04:34] attention service continues this coming

[3:04:52] after the service members are asked to
[3:04:55] meet about 15 minutes after service is
[3:04:58] dismissed and we also have a reminder
[3:05:01] about our church praise and worship
[3:05:05] service and banquet on December the 9th
[3:05:08] the poster is on the notice board
[3:05:11] downstairs please see sister Abbey and
[3:05:14] sister Ruth downstairs after the service
[3:05:16] if you have not yet registered for that
[3:05:19] opportunity to come into the house of
[3:05:22] God and worship and have fellowship and
[3:05:25] have something to eat and as whether
[3:05:27] Steven would say it's quite a delicious
[3:05:29] menu so we encourage everyone to make it
[3:05:32] out it is being managed a certain way so
[3:05:36] if you are part of the cooking support
[3:05:39] then that part is arranged and if you're
[3:05:41] not one of the cooks or arranging part
[3:05:45] of the food and is a contribution
[3:05:46] required the person of $75 and we
[3:05:51] encourage you to make that payment as
[3:05:53] soon as possible and ideally by next
[3:05:56] Sunday so that everything can be put in
[3:05:58] place for December the 9th and it's it's
[3:06:04] very important that we make that
[3:06:05] deadline for that in addition this
[3:06:08] coming Saturday just ahead we have a
[3:06:11] youth-oriented service and we call it
[3:06:13] youth oriented because it's not just for
[3:06:16] the young people it is for the entire
[3:06:18] church and for the last few services we
[3:06:21] have had we have been speaking about
[3:06:23] life and godliness how Peter speak
[3:06:26] of God gives us all things pertaining to
[3:06:28] life and godliness and speaking about
[3:06:30] that balance that Christian balance of
[3:06:34] managing within the context of the
[3:06:36] spirit as well as a natural a school
[3:06:38] work family church being a Christian
[3:06:41] your daily walk and for this coming
[3:06:43] Saturday I believe it's imperative that
[3:06:45] if everyone can make it out it will be
[3:06:48] worth the time and the effort because we
[3:06:50] want to speak about good success in the
[3:06:53] book of Joshua cartel's just short to
[3:06:55] meditate on the word dia night and you
[3:06:58] will have good success how do we define
[3:07:01] that good success both in the spiritual
[3:07:03] and in the natural because God wants us
[3:07:06] to be successful but a random speaks
[3:07:08] about success he speaks about God wants
[3:07:10] you to be smiling you wants you to be
[3:07:11] happy when you look at the biblical
[3:07:14] principles laid out in Scripture and the
[3:07:16] way by the brown and presented it he
[3:07:18] speaks of successful marriage success in
[3:07:20] your financial life success in your
[3:07:22] spiritual life so we want to go through
[3:07:24] the scripture and spend some time as we
[3:07:26] sit down in the trenches particularly
[3:07:29] with the young people but what will be
[3:07:31] shared we know many of the older ones
[3:07:33] would not have here before and certainly
[3:07:35] if you have read it before it'll be
[3:07:37] worth the revision because but the
[3:07:40] Branham said we ought to be God's
[3:07:41] advertisement board so if it is that
[3:07:44] someone sees us walk in the street we
[3:07:46] should have good success because if you
[3:07:49] apply the principles as Joshua was
[3:07:51] instructed meditate on the word day and
[3:07:54] night and you will have good success
[3:07:55] then you ought to be successful in your
[3:07:57] marriage you ought to be successful in
[3:07:59] your financial planning you ought to be
[3:08:01] successful in your prayer life you ought
[3:08:03] to be successful in every area of your
[3:08:05] life so for those who are not here
[3:08:07] please let them know that this coming
[3:08:10] Saturday at 5 p.m. downstairs we will
[3:08:15] have a special youth oriented service
[3:08:17] speaking about good success there's no
[3:08:20] reason as a Christian you ought to be
[3:08:21] failing exams in school that's
[3:08:24] unacceptable
[3:08:25] because whatever you put your effort
[3:08:27] into you will get two results for
[3:08:29] whatever you put your effort into if you
[3:08:32] put more effort into the things of God
[3:08:34] you'll get more results in the things of
[3:08:36] God if you put more effort
[3:08:37] whatsapp and Facebook you will get the
[3:08:39] results that come with that which really
[3:08:41] is no result other than wasting time so
[3:08:44] we want to be able to find that balance
[3:08:45] with young people and we encourage you
[3:08:48] with that as well and very importantly
[3:08:51] as well we are officially making the
[3:08:53] announcement for our annual convention
[3:08:57] our annual July convention which will be
[3:09:00] held July 6th 7th and 8th of 2018 so the
[3:09:05] announcement officially went up on
[3:09:07] social media and we will be updating it
[3:09:09] on our website as well so keep those
[3:09:12] deets in mind the countdown has begun
[3:09:14] and we're getting ready for have a grand
[3:09:17] time in the Lord knowing that one of
[3:09:20] these days it'll be the last convention
[3:09:22] one of these days will be the last
[3:09:24] service but a random said one of these
[3:09:26] days will be the last song one of these
[3:09:28] days we'll read the Bible for the last
[3:09:29] time because it'll be homecoming time
[3:09:31] but before we leave this place we want
[3:09:34] to do all that we can do for the kingdom
[3:09:36] of God and for his people and in closing
[3:09:39] I do want to encourage you I was reading
[3:09:43] this morning where the Prophet was
[3:09:44] speaking and he was speaking about
[3:09:46] children right in his church and he was
[3:09:48] saying and we have a responsibility and
[3:09:50] he was speaking to the mothers and he
[3:09:52] said don't you know that you are
[3:09:53] preachers you said we speak about a
[3:09:55] woman preaching but I'm talking about
[3:09:57] the woman you are preachers in your
[3:09:59] houses and you supposed to preach to
[3:10:01] your children
[3:10:02] and he was making a point of we have a
[3:10:04] responsibility to share this gospel we
[3:10:07] have a responsibility to live a life and
[3:10:09] but the Branham a believer about two
[3:10:12] weeks ago we spoke about it but the
[3:10:13] Branham said he felt so bad that he did
[3:10:15] not do enough so I want to encourage you
[3:10:18] this coming week be an influence on
[3:10:20] somebody's life there are only two
[3:10:23] influences where the random speaks about
[3:10:25] influence from above and influence from
[3:10:26] below but the reality is we are also an
[3:10:29] influence the people around us and we
[3:10:32] have a responsibility to be a positive
[3:10:34] influence to somebody's lives because
[3:10:36] the enemy is using people to influence
[3:10:39] one another and we have a responsibility
[3:10:41] to tell somebody about Jesus tell
[3:10:44] somebody about the Prophet tell somebody
[3:10:46] about this message tell somebody that
[3:10:48] there's hope beyond just
[3:10:50] the bills and living the life but
[3:10:52] there's a land beyond the river and even
[3:10:54] though we are trapped in time we are
[3:10:56] really creatures of eternity and that we
[3:10:58] are born for a purpose so have a
[3:11:00] wonderful blessed week and give the
[3:11:03] devil trouble I love her but Ruben said
[3:11:05] he said he has gasoline because when he
[3:11:07] is driving he wants to leave smoke in
[3:11:09] the devil's face and you need to have
[3:11:11] enough gas to leave smoke in the devil's
[3:11:13] face so this week I challenge you to
[3:11:15] leave smoke in the devil's face I
[3:11:18] challenge you to lift your head high and
[3:11:20] lift your hands in worship no matter
[3:11:22] what trial comes your way no matter what
[3:11:25] situation comes your way you are born to
[3:11:28] overcome you are born to make it you are
[3:11:30] born to be victorious the trials are
[3:11:33] just to push you into your position the
[3:11:36] test is just to push you into position
[3:11:38] every obstacle you face is to push you
[3:11:41] into your position and with the random
[3:11:43] tortas perfect fit is based on your
[3:11:45] position so when you get into your
[3:11:48] position now you have the authority to
[3:11:50] speak to the devil and see Satan
[3:11:52] get out the way because I'm on my way to
[3:11:54] Kenan slam and it's gonna be well so may
[3:11:57] the Lord richly bless you with Anthony
