[43:04] neither shall one thrust another they
[43:05] shall walk everyone in his path and when
[43:08] they fall upon the sword they shall not
[43:09] be wounded do you imagine Peter James
[43:12] and John going before
[43:15] Sak remember that 120 up there couldn't
[43:17] even sign their own names before Sak see
[43:20] if they if all of their if their reflex
[43:23] was just right and so forth they had a
[43:25] reflex but it wasn't they intellectual
[43:28] conception or scientific research it
[43:29] would through the power of God when it's
[43:31] suck they know nothing to do but act out
[43:33] what the Holy Ghost said to they didn't
[43:36] pay attention to any intellectual what
[43:38] the church said and what the priest said
[43:39] what this said that said they move by
[43:41] the spirit Fearless
[43:44] man usually ministers when they get into
[43:47] the pull pit they begin to think if I
[43:51] speak on a certain certain
[43:54] thing here is a certain member of my
[43:58] church that's a a good pay in this
[44:01] church they'll leave the
[44:04] church and then you go to looking at the
[44:07] flesh
[44:08] again then God can't lead that
[44:12] Minister you've got to say what the
[44:15] spirit says to say then we are led by
[44:20] the spirit of God
[44:24] [Applause]
[44:28] oh
[44:32] [Applause]
[44:33] [Music]
[44:40] [Applause]
[44:41] [Music]
[44:42] [Applause]
[44:42] [Music]
[44:51] [Applause]
[44:54] [Music]
[45:05] praise the
[45:07] Lord so all things are ready hallelujah
[45:12] our hearts have to be ready oh praise
[45:14] the name of the Lord so we expect God to
[45:16] do great things among us and we thank
[45:18] God for that
[45:20] amen so you ready for this morning
[45:24] service all right let's all stand as we
[45:26] want to go into the word
[45:28] Hebrews 12
[45:30] 5-11 Proverbs
[45:32] 31-12 and Proverbs 5
[45:36] 11-4 reading verse Hebrews 12 reading
[45:41] from verse 5 and he have forgotten the
[45:44] exaltation which speaketh unto you as
[45:45] unto children my son despise not thou
[45:49] the chasten of the Lord nor faint when
[45:51] thou art rebuked by him for whom the
[45:54] Lord loveth he chasten it and scorge
[45:57] every son whom he receiveth sir if he
[45:59] endure chastening God dealth with you as
[46:02] with sons for what son is he whom the
[46:04] father chasteneth not but if he be
[46:07] without chastisement whereof all are
[46:10] partakers then are ye bastards and not
[46:13] Sons furthermore we have had fathers of
[46:16] our flesh which corrected us and we give
[46:18] them reverence shall we not much rather
[46:21] be in subjection unto the father of
[46:23] spirits and live for they verily for a
[46:25] few days Chase us after their own
[46:28] pleasure but he for our Prophet that we
[46:31] might be partakers of his Holiness now
[46:34] no chastening for the present seem to be
[46:36] joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[46:39] afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit
[46:42] of righteousness unto them which are
[46:44] exercised thereby Proverbs 3 want to
[46:48] read verse 11 and
[46:50] 12 my son despise not the chasten of the
[46:54] Lord neither be wary of his correction
[46:57] for whom the Lord loveth he corrected
[47:00] even as a father the son in whom he
[47:04] delighted our last scripture is from
[47:06] Proverbs 5 reading from verse 11 and
[47:10] thou mourn at the last when thy flesh
[47:13] and thy body are consumed and say how
[47:16] have I hated instruction and my heart
[47:19] despised reproof and have not obeyed the
[47:22] voice of my teachers nor inclin mine ear
[47:26] to them that in instructed me I was
[47:29] almost in an evil in the midst of the
[47:32] congregation and assembly bhe heads
[47:34] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord any
[47:36] man could read the scriptures but it
[47:38] takes you to come and unfold it our
[47:40] hearts and our Lives May you bless it
[47:42] and interpret our lives in Jesus name we
[47:43] ask it and confirm your word pour your
[47:46] spirit upon your people bring them and
[47:47] into wisdom into Enlightenment into
[47:49] discernment into Revelation and
[47:51] inspiration in Jesus name I ask it amen
[47:53] and amen you may be seated oh praise God
[47:57] thank you
[47:58] Jesus
[48:00] okay so the title of this message I
[48:05] preach on it on Sunday the 26th of May
[48:08] and then all the current just in the
[48:10] area just went out and it stopped
[48:12] suddenly so this is a part two to that
[48:15] the pain of discipline or the pain of
[48:18] regret your choice this is a part two I
[48:21] didn't get to complet it but I'll try to
[48:22] see if we could complete it this morning
[48:25] and yesterday we had had a real special
[48:28] time uh in the I call it things
[48:31] pertaining to life and godliness was an
[48:34] amazing
[48:35] session and with brother Andrew sharing
[48:38] some things and brother Anthony sharing
[48:39] some things and what what a blessing it
[48:41] was to be dear but Andrew shared about
[48:45] coming out of Egypt and going through
[48:47] the Wilderness and then going into the
[48:50] promised land in
[48:52] Egypt the Believers or the Israelites he
[48:57] had anything at all that's the Egypt
[49:00] stage and in the wilderness he shared
[49:03] that they had just enough man of Fallen
[49:07] every day but God promised them that
[49:10] they will have
[49:11] abundance in the promised
[49:13] land and he was saying being moved from
[49:17] being blessed to become a blessing and I
[49:21] find was just a powerful thing I want
[49:24] you to think about it there are lots of
[49:26] people like to be blessed but how about
[49:28] changing that to become a blessing and
[49:33] to become a blessing you have to be in
[49:35] abundance that you could share that you
[49:38] could help that you could give and he
[49:40] referenced about that Samaritan who
[49:43] helped that man who was wounded priest
[49:45] passing by this one passing by and a
[49:48] Samaritan took him put him in the hotel
[49:51] and paid for his bills and said if there
[49:53] anything more when a PB I'll pay it that
[49:55] is a man that be has become a blessing
[49:58] and that is where God want us to be in a
[50:00] position that we could bless others and
[50:03] when you look at the equal sign eternal
[50:05] life is ready living for others those
[50:08] people who live selfish lives most of
[50:10] the times they are miserable they could
[50:14] be wealthy and miserable they could have
[50:16] big house and miserable new car and
[50:18] miserable but they are miserable because
[50:21] they're not in service but the life of
[50:24] God comes to bring us into true service
[50:27] unto others isn't that something else so
[50:30] then God told them when you come into
[50:32] abundance don't forget me all right that
[50:35] brought you out to Egypt because this is
[50:37] what has happened when God start to
[50:39] bless people they forget him and they
[50:42] believe is their own strength that get
[50:44] them what they get but the Bible said it
[50:46] is God that give you power to get wealth
[50:50] God give your energy God give you mind
[50:53] God give you health God give you
[50:55] strength to get what what you get he
[50:58] said don't forget me when you get and
[51:00] your cup running over don't forget me
[51:02] remember God who brought you out of
[51:04] Egypt remembered him who brought you to
[51:06] the Wilderness what a blessing praise
[51:09] God hallelujah and then brother Anthony
[51:12] came behind and spoke about time an
[51:15] appointed time and god holds time in his
[51:19] hand and he is he knows what is going to
[51:23] happen next and the issue today for a
[51:25] lot of people is anxiety
[51:27] they are anxious about their future
[51:28] anxious about their career anxious about
[51:30] their children anxious about this and
[51:32] anxious about that but when I look at it
[51:34] closer anxiousness is also a reflection
[51:37] of lack of trust in God because he hold
[51:40] time but there is time and there's
[51:42] appointed time you have your time but
[51:45] God have an appointed time for your
[51:46] deliverance for your breakthrough
[51:48] whatever he has for you there's an
[51:50] appointed time oh give the Lord some
[51:52] Praises so you are in time Hallelujah a
[51:57] time to get a breakthrough a time to be
[51:59] healed a time for whatever it is but
[52:00] guess what you have to wait for the
[52:02] appointed time and you have a time also
[52:05] to fulfill the purpose that God raised
[52:07] you for and God called you for we don't
[52:10] have time to waste isn't that right time
[52:12] is a valuable asset and it doesn't come
[52:14] back when you lose it you lose it if you
[52:17] waste yesterday yesterday not coming
[52:19] back it's gone Hallelujah so you cannot
[52:22] just reflect on the past and hold a lot
[52:24] of regrets you have to learn from your
[52:26] faith failures you have to learn from
[52:28] your past if you don't learn from your
[52:30] failures in your past you'll repeat
[52:34] them so it's time to get serious about
[52:37] life about your future even if you're
[52:40] not serious life moves
[52:44] on and according to what you do you
[52:46] would either fail or succeed now if you
[52:49] not how God speak to his children in
[52:52] blessing I Will Bless thee in
[52:53] multiplying I'll multiply thee God want
[52:56] his children succeed because he wants
[52:58] his children to be Witnesses on the
[53:00] earth of his grace of his power of his
[53:03] Blessing don't let the devil tell you
[53:05] God want you to fail God don't want you
[53:08] to fail your enemy and haters and
[53:10] jealous people will want that but not
[53:12] God okay the Lord some Praises do you
[53:14] get me this morning your haters enemies
[53:16] and jealous people going to want that
[53:18] but not
[53:19] [Applause]
[53:24] God God want you to succeed
[53:27] and you must want others to succeed you
[53:30] not you must want others fail that your
[53:32] success might look glorious no no no you
[53:35] want others to succeed and and when the
[53:37] tide raise every boat will rise well
[53:40] give the Lord some Praises did you get
[53:42] that but when the tide raise every boort
[53:45] going to rise we we got to make it we
[53:48] have to make it the world don't like us
[53:51] the world is against us all them demonic
[53:53] activity they against us let's stand for
[53:56] one another let's support one another
[53:59] let's love one another let's encourage
[54:01] one another let's pick up somebody oh
[54:03] give the Lord some
[54:04] [Applause]
[54:06] Praises glory to God hallelujah
[54:09] hallelujah life itself is a struggle we
[54:12] struggle to live we struggle to die we
[54:15] struggle to press we struggle every day
[54:17] of struggle we can't stop now we got to
[54:20] press towards the mark of the high
[54:22] calling in Christ Jesus you struggle
[54:24] against tiredness against sickness yes
[54:27] against age against children issue
[54:29] husband issue wife issue money issue
[54:32] marital issue but you have to struggle
[54:34] any all oh give the Lord has praise in
[54:37] the
[54:38] [Applause]
[54:42] house I have news for you God set it up
[54:46] that way what did he set up we bypass a
[54:50] theophany our word body in order to be
[54:54] tempted in order to be tested said
[54:56] that's the only purpose if we were the
[54:58] word we will know all things and we
[55:00] couldn't fall but because we bypass the
[55:03] theophany we are on earth now to give
[55:06] witness to God that we are not part of
[55:08] the bunch of the angels that Rebel in
[55:11] heaven Oh Glory to God we are part of
[55:13] the Victorious spirits that rotated over
[55:16] God that never fell in the
[55:18] beginning Oh Glory to God did you get
[55:22] that this morning do you get that this
[55:24] morning you are part heart of the
[55:27] Victorious spirits that rotated off off
[55:30] of God that never fell in the
[55:32] [Applause]
[55:35] beginning may be
[55:38] [Applause]
[55:42] seated the pain of
[55:44] discipline or the pain of
[55:48] regret your
[55:50] choice part
[55:52] two pain from
[55:54] discipline leading from G root to
[55:58] righteousness the contrast of Godly
[56:00] discipline versus the consequences of
[56:03] sin all right discipline may be painful
[56:06] in a moment but It ultimately leads to
[56:10] righteousness and peace and I feel that
[56:13] if we get clarity all right as to the
[56:16] vision for our lives and for God we
[56:19] would be prepared to accept the
[56:21] discipline effectively and better that
[56:23] comes our way because it must come
[56:27] this week I believe is test for
[56:29] students the test is based upon what
[56:32] they have learned or what they have
[56:33] supposed to learn but this is crunch
[56:37] time in a few days exam over is either
[56:40] you learn or you didn't learn I he was
[56:43] playing video games or he was
[56:45] disciplined to study and as as Andrew
[56:49] was sharing yesterday God want
[56:53] profit God don't want your break even
[56:57] never see that like way because the man
[57:00] who took the talent and bury it he said
[57:02] you give me one and after so
[57:05] long I have one back for
[57:08] you and the man said the wicked an
[57:13] unprofitable servant you could do better
[57:15] than that oh give the Lord some
[57:18] Praises so God don't want your break
[57:21] even God don't want you to lose he want
[57:25] you to make
[57:27] a prophet and but as you were sharing
[57:30] Prophet doesn't only mean like
[57:32] money because in all labor there's
[57:36] reward if you plant peas you get peas if
[57:39] you don't plant you get
[57:41] grass don't ask me where they're coming
[57:43] from but they coming did you get that
[57:46] you plant corn you get corn you don't
[57:48] plant you get grass weed that you still
[57:51] to
[57:52] cut plant
[57:54] corn plant PE
[57:57] plan something do something do it today
[58:02] do it now get something in your heart
[58:04] this coming service that you are going
[58:06] to change today you want to be a better
[58:09] wife want to be a better
[58:11] husband all right Hebrews 12 just
[58:14] running quickly just just to connect
[58:15] back with what we had before and we'll
[58:17] go on to the other part Hebrews 1211 for
[58:19] the time being no discipline brings Joy
[58:22] all right but seemingly Grievous and
[58:24] painful
[58:26] afterwards it yields a Peaceable fruit
[58:29] of righteousness to those who have been
[58:30] trained by it I remember rebuking one of
[58:33] my sons and it was some hard things I
[58:36] told him he said Daddy a
[58:40] Vex are
[58:43] upset but I'll make you
[58:45] proud now that was golden words he could
[58:48] have say Vex upset and and and done no
[58:50] he didn't say that he said I'll make you
[58:52] proud meaning I will act upon what you
[58:55] told me even though it's painful what
[58:57] you have to share with me because
[59:00] sometimes you who under the receiving as
[59:03] a son or as a daughter it doesn't sound
[59:06] good it doesn't come across good but it
[59:09] is good for you now I will show you
[59:13] where that will apply later on in life
[59:16] when you become a
[59:18] parent when you become a mother or a
[59:20] father and you have your children then
[59:23] you will understand what your parents
[59:24] had to deal with you
[59:27] and if you felt you could get away with
[59:29] stuff when you get your children let
[59:32] them get away with
[59:33] stuff I sure it'll be different then so
[59:37] sometimes your learning is not even for
[59:38] you presently your learning is to take
[59:41] you through life oh give the Lord some
[59:43] Praises your learning takes you through
[59:46] lessons of life that they don't teach
[59:48] you in school they take geography and
[59:50] chemistry and biology and physics but
[59:51] they don't teach you lessons of life
[59:53] that's what they come to church for Jus
[59:55] I come that you might have life and have
[59:58] and live that life abundantly so God
[1:00:01] want you to have the Abundant Life
[1:00:02] living oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:00:04] isn't that right so the pain of regret
[1:00:07] comes from rejecting wisdom and
[1:00:09] discipline leading to Serious
[1:00:11] consequences and remorse ration 3:19 as
[1:00:14] many as I love still just backtracking I
[1:00:16] rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore
[1:00:18] repent note is not as many as love him
[1:00:21] as many as I love so what's the issue
[1:00:23] with you being rebuked and instructed
[1:00:25] and corrected why Pastor can't give
[1:00:26] words why go put words in his mouth to
[1:00:28] tell you what you need to know not what
[1:00:29] you need not what you want to know
[1:00:31] that's politics Minister preaching what
[1:00:33] people want to hear that is
[1:00:38] politics so I try to avoid fluff you
[1:00:41] know fluff is just making up time man
[1:00:43] understand winging it you talk about
[1:00:45] this whoever come to you here
[1:00:49] talking like years
[1:00:51] ago talk a box of cigarette and preach
[1:00:54] thinking maxfilter and he said he could
[1:00:56] watch a fan see fan spinning there all
[1:00:58] the parts together and he started and
[1:00:59] even half an hour with a
[1:01:01] fan and I listen to this thing this is
[1:01:03] crazy he's not a SP it all together you
[1:01:06] know if one part missing the F working
[1:01:09] good and Revelation I that as I tell the
[1:01:13] ministers I am not here to hear people
[1:01:15] thoughts ideas and what they think God's
[1:01:17] in a prophet for me to hear the words of
[1:01:19] that Prophet I want to hear what is
[1:01:22] Promised because promise give me a goal
[1:01:25] promise give me an expectation promise
[1:01:27] give me a desire that's what promise
[1:01:29] does I promise you the Holy Ghost I
[1:01:31] promise you power I promise you healing
[1:01:34] I promise you Deliverance I promise you
[1:01:35] the quick power I promise you the
[1:01:37] anointing to break your y I promise you
[1:01:39] your family I promise you your loved
[1:01:41] ones I promise to take you out I promise
[1:01:43] to bring you in all these are precious
[1:01:45] Promises by these promises we can be
[1:01:47] partakers of his divine nature by the
[1:01:49] promises not by my talk and talk and
[1:01:52] talk and spending two hours with long
[1:01:54] talk we not here for that oh give the
[1:01:56] Lord some Praises you want to hear
[1:01:58] promise after promise after promise Oh
[1:02:01] Glory to God when you leave here you
[1:02:02] must walking out knowing the devil is a
[1:02:05] liar he don't have a promise but you
[1:02:07] have oh come on now preach back to
[1:02:10] [Applause]
[1:02:12] me listen listen listen even if you're
[1:02:15] backing inside of here the devil still
[1:02:17] don't have a promise but you have
[1:02:20] because God could restore you God could
[1:02:22] heal you God can bring you out not only
[1:02:26] you but your family also oh give the
[1:02:28] Lord some
[1:02:29] Praises Oh Glory to
[1:02:32] God even if you're lazy the devil don't
[1:02:35] have a promise you have oh God could
[1:02:37] bring that Spirit of diligence upon you
[1:02:39] amen all right so therefore rebuke and
[1:02:43] chasen to rebuke is to reprove come on
[1:02:45] now to reprove is to expose with a view
[1:02:48] to correction all right not just to
[1:02:50] expose like I say if somebody is naked
[1:02:52] don't go you they have old clothes and
[1:02:54] you want to expose them take off that
[1:02:56] you have close to
[1:02:57] them tell them take off that only if you
[1:02:59] have close to them you know you're
[1:03:01] rebuking and then they they walk naked
[1:03:04] get close first and then talk your talk
[1:03:07] oh give the Lord some Praises leave them
[1:03:09] as they are until you can help them
[1:03:11] until you could do better if you can't
[1:03:13] do better shut up keep quiet oh we going
[1:03:17] to Revival here this morning oh glory to
[1:03:20] God we going to Revival here this
[1:03:21] morning exposed with a view of
[1:03:23] Correction chasing doesn't mean to
[1:03:26] punish here we go Chason does not mean
[1:03:30] to punish it means to discipline because
[1:03:33] the subject amendment is in mind when
[1:03:37] you see people getting licked and beaten
[1:03:39] they want to punish have people like
[1:03:40] that you know because they get punished
[1:03:41] they punishing too they say abuse people
[1:03:44] abuse people because they are abused
[1:03:46] they abuse we not talking about abuse we
[1:03:49] talking about
[1:03:50] discipline amen so hearing is the love

[1:26:02] say don't mock them and you God don't
[1:26:05] like that you know something hitting
[1:26:07] somebody and you smiling and you
[1:26:09] carrying all good good for them they s
[1:26:11] where they reap and they s and they
[1:26:12] carrying on carrying some God has pull
[1:26:14] back the Judgment
[1:26:15] off you can't talk like that walk
[1:26:19] humble be little I was telling my wife
[1:26:22] they say I want to S right in the ground
[1:26:23] and fall when I down
[1:26:26] there you see when you climb up high and
[1:26:29] you fall you had to look for your body
[1:26:30] and you
[1:26:33] SC but when you keep humble and you stay
[1:26:36] in the dust my wife always tell me that
[1:26:38] you know she say she want to walk if she
[1:26:40] fall down she could just dust and get
[1:26:42] back
[1:26:43] up when you climb up there some people
[1:26:46] take the ladder and climb up and then
[1:26:47] throw down the lad
[1:26:49] know they they looking to come down
[1:26:52] they're looking to climb Harder They the
[1:26:54] lad up and they kick down the ladder Bo
[1:26:57] they go George and when they climb up
[1:26:59] there and they do fall forget it you to
[1:27:01] find a hand their foot day all this
[1:27:04] C he that he that he that proud shall be
[1:27:08] humbled and he just humble himself shall
[1:27:10] be exalted walk humble walk close to the
[1:27:14] dust anybody should be able to talk to
[1:27:16] you anybody should be able to correct
[1:27:19] you and share with you you have have to
[1:27:21] be up there somewhere where you think he
[1:27:23] is and when people think they are up
[1:27:25] there the market is calling when you're
[1:27:27] overvalued when you're stuck overvalued
[1:27:30] the commentator say you are due for
[1:27:32] correction oh give the Lord a shout in
[1:27:34] the house when people stuck overvalued
[1:27:36] they are due for correction it climbing
[1:27:39] Higher and Higher and Higher and
[1:27:40] afterward it too high the market is
[1:27:44] corrected come back down oh glory to God
[1:27:47] but when you stay down God will bless
[1:27:49] you God and what baram says God looking
[1:27:52] for a man the more he blessed
[1:27:54] is the more humble he becomes that's a
[1:27:59] odd thing because most time people get
[1:28:01] proud but God I know brother he wanted a
[1:28:04] back to come to service and what when he
[1:28:06] get he by the beach you see why he all
[1:28:09] along God was trying to save him all
[1:28:11] along he come to service he traveling
[1:28:13] what he want a car he could serve God
[1:28:15] better when he get the car he by the
[1:28:16] beach on a
[1:28:18] Sunday that what God talking about the
[1:28:21] heart of man desperately wicked let's
[1:28:25] let me see if I get to where but I'm
[1:28:27] talking about this now he's talking
[1:28:29] about um when a son is Born Into the
[1:28:31] family he was a son at Birth but his
[1:28:35] inheritance was not determined was not
[1:28:37] yet determined it depended on his
[1:28:40] character so everybody in his message
[1:28:42] come like on the same page all called of
[1:28:45] God all selected and elected of God and
[1:28:49] God has not given out inheritance yet
[1:28:51] right even as much as the ministers try
[1:28:53] to make it it's so but it's not really
[1:28:55] so yet because inheritance could only
[1:28:57] come by Dynamics because when the Holy
[1:29:00] Ghost fell on Pentecost that is when
[1:29:02] inheritance was given and each one got
[1:29:04] their lick of fire or each one get their
[1:29:07] portion both Pastor and janitor in the
[1:29:10] upper room got their portion oh give the
[1:29:12] Lord some Praises deacons Elders got
[1:29:14] their portion in the upper room God
[1:29:16] divided everybody get a chance to get
[1:29:18] the own portion own L of fire in the
[1:29:21] upper room that coming back oh give the
[1:29:23] Lord a shout the Dynamics of this church
[1:29:25] will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:28] God placing you positionally in the body
[1:29:30] what you are in God oh give the Lord
[1:29:33] some Praises so your portion
[1:29:37] coming note is your portion not your
[1:29:40] brother portion that is your brother own
[1:29:43] I'm talking about your own portion that
[1:29:45] is coming it is mine I claim it it
[1:29:48] belongs to me oh give the Lord a shout
[1:29:50] in the house come on come on preach back
[1:29:53] to me
[1:29:54] that portion I claim it it is M it
[1:29:59] belongs to me so therefore the birth is
[1:30:02] not the issue the issue going to be the
[1:30:05] inheritance that is not
[1:30:07] determined it have family when come to
[1:30:10] read inheritance and will and whatnot
[1:30:13] son Beav this way that way that way that
[1:30:15] way this one get his house this one get
[1:30:16] land whatnot and that other
[1:30:19] son father just leave a thank you you
[1:30:21] know
[1:30:24] a thank you note nothing at all why
[1:30:28] because of
[1:30:30] behavior you you understand sometime it
[1:30:33] got to leave a will because without a
[1:30:34] will is is pure
[1:30:38] problems real problems you know so I
[1:30:41] like what Jesus did he left a will don't
[1:30:44] get me start here this
[1:30:45] morning he died and left he a will and
[1:30:49] he come back as the enforcer to ensure
[1:30:50] you get what is
[1:30:52] yours so when Caleb stood up and said
[1:30:54] give me my mountain that was part of the
[1:30:56] contract that was part of the will you
[1:30:58] know what Moses say about me you know
[1:30:59] what the prophet say about this end time
[1:31:01] prde you know this bright supposed to be
[1:31:02] a super Church a super race a she near
[1:31:04] The Headstone you know all of that what
[1:31:06] the prophet
[1:31:06] [Applause]
[1:31:07] [Music]
[1:31:16] said so says the sun right it's your
[1:31:20] character from then on what means the
[1:31:23] difference
[1:31:25] not going to church there are some
[1:31:28] people go to church as a ritual just
[1:31:29] like they going to the Catholic this
[1:31:30] morning you know you come to the
[1:31:32] Catholics they go to church Ash
[1:31:33] Wednesday take ashes they they dance
[1:31:35] hanal Monday and Tuesday and and and and
[1:31:38] and Wednesday they take the ashes and so
[1:31:39] on and said the priest the priest
[1:31:41] exonerate them from the party that they
[1:31:43] had for the last two things and they
[1:31:45] comfortable with that they go back next
[1:31:47] year to party for two days Monday and
[1:31:48] Tuesday take the ashes and things and
[1:31:50] they do it for years and they figure
[1:31:52] that God
[1:31:54] so you could come here with the same
[1:31:58] thinking so come this morning to get the
[1:32:00] lashes this morning you know get
[1:32:04] lashes but we don't have ashes here we
[1:32:07] have a word here a word from God and if
[1:32:11] you take it and apply it it becomes
[1:32:13] effective to you because Jesus said by
[1:32:16] preaching the word a word of none effect
[1:32:18] it have no effect to the people because
[1:32:20] they have the pots and P doct the
[1:32:22] disciples came describe and phes came to
[1:32:24] Jesus it was a very important issue they
[1:32:26] had on hand you know what the issue was
[1:32:29] how come your disciples not washing
[1:32:33] hands before they eat before they drink
[1:32:37] before they do anything because this is
[1:32:39] what we
[1:32:40] do Jesus said you
[1:32:43] Hypocrites well did Isaiah speak of you
[1:32:47] your heart is far from me your mou talk
[1:32:49] in this church talk thing and then Jesus
[1:32:52] said in vain do you work worship me
[1:32:54] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[1:32:56] of man but more than that he says not
[1:32:58] what go into you that defile you it what
[1:33:01] was come out of you that defile you for
[1:33:03] out of the heart proceed adulteries and
[1:33:06] fornications and stealing he was showing
[1:33:08] is a heart is you oh give the Lord I
[1:33:10] shout the defilement comes from a heart
[1:33:12] is to Lord send the fire Oh Glory to God
[1:33:16] we take Holy Ghost Fire it take the sffs
[1:33:20] with the c of the altar Hallelujah the
[1:33:23] drop on the human heart to burn them
[1:33:26] things
[1:33:27] [Music]
[1:33:30] [Applause]
[1:33:31] out all
[1:33:38] right so I'm going to skip down you talk
[1:33:41] about fasting and fighting among one
[1:33:43] another there's no cooporation at all
[1:33:45] and I said to you where there's no when
[1:33:47] there's competition there's no
[1:33:48] cooperation and I'm talking about
[1:33:49] supernatural among a church the other
[1:33:51] Church don't want to cooperate they
[1:33:52] don't want to have the meetings and so
[1:33:53] on because jealous and set of issues and
[1:33:55] so on he talk about immature and if you
[1:33:57] we blast that kind of stuff but it is
[1:34:00] what it is but then this is where I
[1:34:02] close off at and it cut off I believe if
[1:34:04] God has permitted sickness to come to
[1:34:06] you to bring you to discipline and you
[1:34:09] refuse to discipline yourself before God
[1:34:12] so God give you a choice you could
[1:34:15] discipline yourself before God when we
[1:34:18] talk about communion what the Bible said
[1:34:19] let a
[1:34:21] man say it say it out loud
[1:34:24] examine himself not the pastor examin
[1:34:26] him you know you examine yourself to see
[1:34:30] your condition whether or not you should
[1:34:33] partake of the
[1:34:35] communion if God has the six to come to
[1:34:38] you to bring you to discipline and you
[1:34:40] refuse to discipline yourself before God
[1:34:42] then step out of line don't come in here
[1:34:44] it makes it worse if you are sinful and
[1:34:47] you've got UNC confessing make it right
[1:34:49] before God before you come to prayer and
[1:34:52] that's is where this thing cut off so we
[1:34:53] can here do weart tonight one Proverbs
[1:34:57] 19:3 the Bible said the foolishness of
[1:35:00] man perverted his way and his heart Fred
[1:35:05] against the Lord the Amplified says the
[1:35:08] foolishness of man subverts his way it
[1:35:11] ruins his Affairs his own foolishness
[1:35:14] right ruin his own Affairs then his
[1:35:18] heart is resentful and fight against the
[1:35:19] Lord what the Lord have to do with
[1:35:21] that you and your
[1:35:24] foolishness screw up mess up and then
[1:35:27] you Vex with
[1:35:29] God Jeremiah 29 says thine own
[1:35:33] wickedness shall correct thee and thy
[1:35:36] backsliding shall reprove thee no
[1:35:39] therefore and see that isn't an evil
[1:35:42] thing and bitter that thou was forsaken
[1:35:44] the Lord thy God that my fear is not in
[1:35:46] theed sayth the Lord of host and the
[1:35:49] Amplified it says your own wickedness
[1:35:53] shall change and correct you and your
[1:35:55] backsliding and desertion of faith shall
[1:35:58] reprove you know therefore and recognize
[1:36:02] that this is an evil and bitter thing
[1:36:04] first you are forsaken the Lord your God
[1:36:06] second you are indifferent to me and the
[1:36:08] fear of me is nothing you see the Lord
[1:36:11] of hosts oh give the Lord some
[1:36:14] Praises
[1:36:15] Hallelujah watch this bomb here now
[1:36:18] watch the son that is righteous he's a
[1:36:21] gentleman loved his father he loved his
[1:36:23] father's business and you know what
[1:36:25] happened when that boy come up certain
[1:36:26] age the boy was adopted into the family
[1:36:29] now what did he do they took him out to
[1:36:31] a public place put a special robe on him
[1:36:34] had a ceremony and all the people of the
[1:36:37] city gathered around looked and they
[1:36:39] look upon the boy and had a father had a
[1:36:42] ceremony of adoption all right now don't
[1:36:46] miss this after that son was adopted his
[1:36:49] name on the checkbook was just as good
[1:36:51] as his daddy's that is where watch watch
[1:36:56] that is where God is trying to get his
[1:36:57] church to say be mov it will move and
[1:37:00] sickness going to be arise it will be
[1:37:02] that way the blind will receive their
[1:37:04] sight deaf and dumb we pray for them now
[1:37:07] but then you'll command it isn't that
[1:37:10] right if you say to this mountain watch
[1:37:13] what we need is
[1:37:15] adoption Sons and Daughters need
[1:37:17] adoption but this is the part I want to
[1:37:19] get
[1:37:19] to and this is the part that catches my
[1:37:22] eye not so much the end part but the
[1:37:26] process part my eyes sees that watch
[1:37:30] this now but how can the church the
[1:37:33] Pentecostal Church the Methodist and
[1:37:35] Baptist Church be adopted until they
[1:37:38] come to
[1:37:40] discipline but Jo this mystery is not
[1:37:42] being preached much right this this
[1:37:43] unfolding this we have got to be
[1:37:46] disciplined first when before
[1:37:51] adoption who said that God said that
[1:37:54] so this speaking the word I speak the
[1:37:55] word what speaking what word you're
[1:37:57] speaking the word
[1:37:58] now watch this
[1:38:01] God could not trust this power with the
[1:38:05] church it's hard to tell what you would
[1:38:07] do that's
[1:38:09] right somebody Vex their like brother
[1:38:12] you know and they want to speak
[1:38:16] existence what this is
[1:38:25] husband disappear you because somebody
[1:38:27] Vex God can lose that kind of power
[1:38:29] these people dangerous you know these
[1:38:31] are dangerous men out there I don't want
[1:38:34] that I don't want any power you know I
[1:38:36] want
[1:38:38] character because if I have the
[1:38:40] character I will be able to handle
[1:38:43] power I can't even trust myself with
[1:38:45] that power I'm telling you so not yet
[1:38:49] Lord not yet not yet not
[1:38:51] yet God does nothing for sure
[1:38:54] whatever God does it have a mind behind
[1:38:57] it he let Moses time out for 40 years
[1:39:00] until he ready for Moses then is when
[1:39:02] the pillar fire appear not to get a
[1:39:05] picture for Instagram but to get in
[1:39:07] contact with Moses to give him the
[1:39:09] commission to go and get his people out
[1:39:10] from Egypt do you get what I'm saying so
[1:39:13] whenever God come down there's a purpose
[1:39:15] behind that whenever the witness come
[1:39:17] down there's a purpose behind that
[1:39:19] whenever rebuke comes down there's a
[1:39:20] purpose behind that whenever a word come
[1:39:22] there's a purpose behind that this word

[1:49:00] years when the horse bolt out of
[1:49:03] the the horse Bol on the stable you're
[1:49:06] trying to
[1:49:10] run the horse born
[1:49:15] big you have to shape the tree
[1:49:18] early and then it could then to form you
[1:49:21] teach a child that it will the things of
[1:49:23] the Lord and then when the child get
[1:49:24] grow that will be in
[1:49:27] him tell my wife next year around
[1:49:29] February uh if God T is coming I'm still
[1:49:32] alive next year about the 15th of

[1:50:09] decisions that you make and you could
[1:50:11] make decisions today to be a better
[1:50:14] person to change your way because what
[1:50:16] you know is your culture your way your

[1:54:08] that Rich Young Ruler he come good
[1:54:11] Master what shall I do to her it in your

[2:02:29] us to behave but the word the Mysteries
[2:02:34] the Revelation come to teach you in
[2:02:36] church how to behave yourself and
[2:02:40] conduct yourself so nobody supposed to
[2:02:42] be misbehaving in the
[2:02:46] church do you get that now in other
[2:02:48] words the word supposed to bring you in
[2:02:50] line and bring you in order oh give the
[2:02:54] Lord a shout Proverbs 1: 12-31 says
[2:02:57] wisdom cry out she uttered her voice in
[2:03:00] the streets she cried in the chief place
[2:03:03] of concourse in the open of the gates in
[2:03:05] the city she uttered a word saying how
[2:03:06] long he simple ones will you love
[2:03:09] Simplicity and the scorners Delight in
[2:03:11] their scorning and fools hate knowledge
[2:03:15] turn you at my reproof behold I will
[2:03:17] pour out my spirit upon you I will make
[2:03:20] known my words unto you
[2:03:22] because I have called and you refused I
[2:03:24] have stretched out my hand and no man
[2:03:26] regarded you have set at not all my
[2:03:28] counsel and with none of my reproof I
[2:03:30] will also laugh at your Calamity so when
[2:03:33] you don't want correction God say when
[2:03:35] you get in your trouble I would laugh at
[2:03:37] you I would laugh at your Calamity I
[2:03:39] will mock when your fear cometh when
[2:03:42] your fear cometh as a desolation and
[2:03:44] your destruction cometh as a worldwind
[2:03:46] when distress and anguish come upon you
[2:03:48] then shall they call upon me but I will
[2:03:49] not answer
[2:03:51] they will seek me early but they shall
[2:03:53] not find me for they hated knowledge and
[2:03:56] they choose they did not choose to fear
[2:03:59] the lord they with none of my counsel
[2:04:02] they despise my reproof therefore shall
[2:04:05] they eat yes the fruit of their own way
[2:04:09] and be filled with their own devices and
[2:04:11] the Amplified verse 22 says oh how long
[2:04:13] oh simple ones open to evil would you
[2:04:16] love being simple and the scuffers the
[2:04:19] light in scuffing and self-confident
[2:04:21] fool fools hate knowledge he the Bible
[2:04:23] say right self confident fools hate
[2:04:28] knowledge the Bible said my people
[2:04:30] perish because of lack of knowledge this
[2:04:34] is knowledge of God not
[2:04:35] information knowledge of
[2:04:38] God verse 26 in the Amplified said I
[2:04:41] will also laugh at your Calamity I will
[2:04:42] mock when thing come that will cause you
[2:04:44] Terror and panic and when your Panic
[2:04:47] comes as a storm and desolation and your
[2:04:49] Calamity comes as a whirlwind when
[2:04:51] distress come upon you then you will
[2:04:54] call upon me but I will not answer oh we
[2:04:56] almost done mus come please job 5:17 to
[2:05:00] 18 behold happy is the man whom God
[2:05:04] corrected therefore despise not thou the
[2:05:07] chasten of the almighty for he make it
[2:05:10] sore and bind it up he wounded and his
[2:05:13] hand makes
[2:05:14] whole Amplified say happy and fortunate
[2:05:17] is the man whom God reproves so do not
[2:05:19] despise or reject the correction of them
[2:05:21] Almighty for he wounds but he binds up
[2:05:24] he Smite and His Hands heal so the same
[2:05:27] God that break you he would heal you
[2:05:29] don't move and fight up with the sword
[2:05:31] let the sword go in and cut and as it
[2:05:33] comes out it's going to heal too oh give
[2:05:36] the Lord a shout in the House 2
[2:05:38] Corinthians 7:8 says for though I made
[2:05:41] you sorry with a letter I do not
[2:05:44] repent though I did repent for I
[2:05:46] perceived that the same epistle had made
[2:05:48] you sorry though it were for a season
[2:05:51] but now I Rejoice not that you were made
[2:05:54] sorry but that you sorrowed to
[2:05:56] repentance for ye were made sorry after
[2:05:59] a Godly manner that you might receive
[2:06:02] damage by us in nothing for Godly sorrow
[2:06:05] worketh repentance to salvation but the
[2:06:09] sorrow of the world work at death in the
[2:06:12] Amplified Paul speaks 2 Corinthians 7:8
[2:06:15] for even though I did grieve you with my
[2:06:17] letter I do not regret it now though I
[2:06:20] did regret it for I see the letter that
[2:06:23] pain you though only for a little while
[2:06:26] yet I am glad now because you were
[2:06:29] pained but because you were pained into
[2:06:32] repentance that's the objective that
[2:06:35] people get pained into repentance not a
[2:06:38] pain a hurt a hurt and you still a
[2:06:41] repent pain and repentance and so turn
[2:06:43] back to God for you felt grief such as
[2:06:46] God meant you to feel so that in nothing
[2:06:48] you might suffer lost through us or har
[2:06:51] for what we did for Godly grief and the
[2:06:54] pain of God is permitted is to direct
[2:06:57] produce a repentance that leads and
[2:06:59] contributes salvation and deliverance
[2:07:02] from Evil and it never brings
[2:07:05] regret the pain of discipline or the
[2:07:08] pain of regret so Paul brings here the
[2:07:11] difference between Godly sorrow which
[2:07:13] lead to repentance and salvation as
[2:07:16] opposed to worldly sorrow that leads to
[2:07:19] death so you come like Adam like me you
[2:07:22] became from attribute to flesh to be
[2:07:24] tempted you see in order to stand
[2:07:26] Temptation you have to bypass your
[2:07:28] theophany you had to come down here in
[2:07:31] flesh to be tempted by sin so we bypass
[2:07:34] theop to be tempted by sin now you could
[2:07:37] have say oh if I could quit drinking
[2:07:39] just get into Christ and it'll all go on
[2:07:42] because your body is subject to that
[2:07:43] Spirit oh my and when you become subject
[2:07:47] to that Spirit it CHS your whole being
[2:07:50] subject to that spirit and that Spirit
[2:07:52] here we go is nothing in the world but
[2:07:54] the seed word made manifest or
[2:07:57] Quicken and believe it or not I'm almost
[2:07:59] there but was praying and he was praying
[2:08:03] from choosing of Bri let us pray he said
[2:08:05] dear God in my spirit is a shaken my
[2:08:07] heart is dropping tear drops of warning
[2:08:09] Grant God that men and women will not
[2:08:11] think I've said it as a joke and the
[2:08:13] people may not think as something that
[2:08:15] was prejudice against them may they see
[2:08:18] it it is love thou bear me record
[2:08:20] almighty God that up and down this
[2:08:22] course I went year after year
[2:08:23] proclaiming the word bear me I took your
[2:08:26] name by it and said it was thus sayth
[2:08:28] the Lord so I pray father in the name of
[2:08:31] the Lord Jesus let people shake
[2:08:33] themselves tonight and flee from the
[2:08:36] Wrath that is to come for IUD is rote
[2:08:39] over the doors and over the Nations a
[2:08:42] black check mark has come across it the
[2:08:45] spirit of God is grieved from it and
[2:08:49] they are weighed in the balance and f
[2:08:51] one W the Feast of King Nebuchadnezzar
[2:08:53] has repeated again with drunken parties
[2:08:56] half-dressed women calling theel

[2:44:29] was asked uh after the service or just
[2:44:31] before the service ended about this
[2:44:33] year's convention and how many
[2:44:35] appreciate the trailer but oid played
[2:44:37] about the convention we encourage you to
[2:44:40] take a look at it it was shared in the
[2:44:42] WhatsApp group it's also on the YouTube
[2:44:44] channel and everything like that and the
[2:44:46] Lord has put it on brother ID's heart uh
[2:44:48] to not not have a set theme for this
[2:44:51] convention we believe that the Lord
[2:44:53] wants to set his own theme via speaking
[2:44:56] through his servants in the way that he
[2:44:58] wants to speak through his servants so
[2:45:00] somebody asked me what's the theme of
[2:45:02] this year's convention the theme of the
[2:45:04] convention is what the Lord will decide
