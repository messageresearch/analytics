rejoice afterwards yeah yeah really get you yes shout him to rejoice him because quantity of good success may be seated Jesus Christ him yesterday's ever this is the 27th of June 1963 this is after the seals vertebra there's a difference between the church and the bride the church goes to the tribulation the sixth seal to purify it but the bride don't she goes in the rapture before that it's time for the bride to be called out so now I believe it's a calling all time so God call you out of the world stay out God called out a fornication adultery wickedness let's stay out got a lot of foolishness help because he called you out okay the Lord a shout because we for you he called for the out of the world not to bring the world in the church he called the altar nonsense not to bring nonsense in the church he call you out stay out and shout because she called her out just the fact that you get a call is enough to show ya every salon yeah just a call you might be Egypt right now but you're here tonight God and I are moving to what's that call it's an EVA call it's a bride call it's God calling no man could come except the father draw him it's God join you tonight to a higher calling to a higher purpose or glory to God amen hallelujah Anfisa the trumpets but around ciliate rages the matter age when they kill early Christians Catholic Church kills 68 million Christians died during that time and they thought there was doing God a service matter age then had a reformers he called the Reformers each and now is the poly no time changes matter age reformers age and callin all time according to revelation 10 the mysteries of all the Bible would be known to the bride so no devil in hell could stop us from going in revelation 10 and here in seven thunders banging one two three four five eight seven because it is a mystery of the entire Bible of all the Bible pulled me known to the bride shun take the bride and he heard them voices and you have to hear those voices also or give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah the Lord Himself descends with a shout to call you out glory of God so the call of God came from revelation 10 hallelujah the lion roared and seven thunders twenty voices out to call you out Oh hallelujah praise God oh man hallelujah and as we said the devil God put the silence under the 7cu when he opened the Seventh Seal There was silence that's what the scriptures say but it took a prophet to take the tunnels from the back of the book and put it under the Seventh Seal nobody have the authority to do that that's a hidden mystery he put the thunders day and said the bride will find that inside there there because I'll go give the bride fate not gonna cancer the bright together that was taught about how to repair or chlorine liqueur you put that there for bride exclusive right promise who is the bride elected or give the Lord a shout so we're not talking about church members tonight no we're not addressing church members tonight we I adjusted elected tonight and if you believe you elected it means a few are called to be elected body let you and God call you and there's a privilege and an honor to be called by God in this dark hour there are many people smoking and drinking right now wish they're gonna get that call there are many people fornicating and I've got you right now the wish something to the wrong side AHA and God turn you a roll and told you oh my god imprison him denied and I tank an MD ni for the privilege and the opportunity to save this resurrected Christ all glory to God so let's raise it back again according to Revelation 10 the mushiya Warner Bible would be known to the bride is that right revelation 10 listen close the brain called out by the word Christ himself calling all the bride may complain Hebrews 13:8 so what the Lord Himself comes on to what he said a bunch of men just to be manhandled the bride no he's our the Lord Himself came down to bring word that the would come to the bride because William Branham was a messenger but he had a message or plural of God we don't have a message he brought the message we echo a message that was brought by a prophet because he was called messenger or give the Lord a shout brought in not 27,000 his hand is only seven stars in his hand seven stars hallelujah and brother Branham was one of those stars in his right hand of Almighty God that's why he said the spirit and the prophet and the bride will say the same thing Oh glory to God so the bride is caller by the word isn't that right breathe an assumed as this church the bride is drawn together she is taken up and that the mystery of the seventh seal or the mystery of the seventh seal the mystery of is going so the bride had to be got a together to be caught up into the mystery of the seventh seal and the Jews is caught by the mystery of the seventh trumpet which is two prophets Elijah and Moses and they come back oh praise get noticed God doing this and the people didn't know it the cannon man was going with reason God Aereo is now calling a spiritual Exodus where he calling natural exodus boys people he's calling a spiritual exercise today yes only to be selected so this Exodus is not everybody everybody come into church but the electical be exodus churches for everybody but this path here this is for the elected or cattle or - out how many zealand launcher tonight how many feel inspired or glory regard yeah but I'm Adam now Egypt could not see Israel being right to the Lambs blood on the door lintel post thinks they can place God's dong there moving his prophet taking a man's word and he said let there be flies and blow over the Egyptians walk back nothing happened I'm just a little while all greenfly start cycling around and while they were probably and then there were two pumps per square yard he said Moses or let there be flies and when he said nothing that's always one fly and then two pumps per square yard so much' fire Chi you see I come like how the Dead was raised back in Africa a good testimony on the same message but a little preach he uncontrol you should go and listen back to it we call we didn't have that was before the preach and I said but you gonna listen back to the testimonies of the Dead been raised the church crying sister felt that in church and the crying and praying and whatnot and they pray and my name is you know wonderfully wrong senator yes result his best-ever they can receive him one day she need to go to the mock hospital they pick more wine anyway on the rigid Imam sister Obama is coming so that tells you they still have it not like an instant thing no no you could pray and just walk away you could prefer a child and just walk away Griffin son daughter husband wife children and just walk away and your word will prosper just like God would as prosper he said my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish the purpose that I sent in for to accomplish my son you start to speak like God talk like God amen hallelujah praise God isn't that right let's go a little bit know there was intellectual Ramsey standing there that was against a very religious man against the spirit of living God natural Michael only see Ramses but the spiritual minds in the promise you see know if people watching right now they're watchin Ramses look at the garment look at his robe because it's or look at his army look at this palace I've seen a bunch of mud dobbers look at them but these them is the people of promise these mud daubers looking bitter people is the God's children that that Darius Ian they them is the elected them is he called out ones gone and : so if somebody watching and choosing was warning on a pic the eyes will be pick Ramses you looking good looking on top of his game but these people have a promise don't mess with anybody with a promise don't fool with no man or woman who with a promise once you under promise the devil is shaken where is God you just risen to come into your reality of your promise so I promise you to heal you the devil shaken because the doctor tell you your google finish this and that and that doctor give you so much a time but that your time is in God God will collect your papers not the doctor or give the Lord some praise his people all right now if just one killer could call those Americans and Hittites and Jabba sites as dude it wasn't there yet twice and three on four times their sides and the natural man Akina is what he said yeah dren - oh look at em fellas and them is for tiny size alone and he do like if they're not even it I have seen them all I seen as he promised our God I see him big grapes so here not time here at aminal Giants they were so big the crime scene they real big you know but then other guys those other tech ministers do any looking a giant we can't take it boy 40-plus years gone and we still here tired we never do promise you nearer for your gray here to come back black you nearer to go back to nineteen again you never talk about 19 again you walking into your future when they never thing you cut you off here you walk it into your future you going back to where you were before because you have a promise of restoration remember your body is your body you know you get in a resurrected body you know you can send a glorified body you know if I still be you you know because Adam was supposed to speak for you but I don't sell so you can only be spoken in prophecy [Applause] you know good the earth was made to take your body out of did you hear that you were spirit gene taught man but God put man in the dust of the earth because God gave man to rule yet it was supposed to be our inheritance that's why when the lamp of the book jeong's and we shall reign on the earth because john understood the restoration of the book means the restoration of the earth and i lost the book Adam lost the authority if we get back to book we kept back the authority you heard Sunday as long as God in control of Adam Adam to control the earth and if you praise God got to get you under control as the head of your house the house will come in a control if the parents get under the control of God the children will come under control we need the control of door [Applause] oh my just one key left seeing God's promise we are more than able to do it why they were looking what said I give you the land the camera mine don't get it but the spiritual mine picks it up what actually something why didn't he different see these things because they were not elected go tell a man before it happened get out sleep in church God told Abram what happened your seed was a jinn in Egypt for hundred years I bring them out that's the reason they seen it because they were elected to see it there is a election Israel was elected to see the sign of God and they went out of Egypt where the unbelievers perish and today God his call is elected listen he's elected the spiritual seed of Abraham by the faith that he had in the Word of God it's being called from big denominations into the presence of Jesus Christ what is this beautiful called from big denomination into the into the presence of Jesus Christ was that clear did you get it or praise God they never see it because it wasn't elected remember this election is coming now it's not going to another nation it is going to glory so we're not going to excellest on their country we go into glory I guess not here God is calling these elected people and they are elected now Oh hallelujah they're not will be elected they are elected now or what elected for a resurrection ok the law some praises what sign is he showing up a resurrection sign what was he showing them a delivering sign to deliver them from bondage a sign up power I could shut the heavens and show under black disguise so I am saying tonight that God gonna give you a deliverance and a breakthrough and a freedom then let you know that you are elected you have to give you that deliverance and that is yours and the tea that I revealed the law under us and to our children every revelation that had been revealed the secret things we love the God but points is revealed that's mine that's mine see it belongs to me it belongs to me one more time it belongs to me that's what we're talking about the what is reveal it's been long to us oh praise God praise God give him praise give him praise God listen listen God bringing out of Egypt Israel out of Egypt to the promised land are you ready was the type of Christ bringing the bride out of the church to the promised land we are in another exodus as God brought a nation out of a nation God will bring a bride out of a church the bride will be called from all the churches so your church can lock down the bride because it's caught doing the callin all the ministers who figure they're in charge God going to retrench them they will still serve the church but not the bride because Jesus himself came not to get that bribe the shock the voice and Trump Jesus does all three oh I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven when a book open that book had names that's how you were called you name had to be in that bottle - the law - oh my god you should be shouting and praising and dancing your name was in that book that book was sealed but now the book is unsealed then that's our names there then the name has to be manifested you are the words of the book or give the Lord some praise those people God will bring a bride out of a church the bride will be the call lot from all the churches it will be the elected of God will be brought out and we on the verge of Exodus right now on the talk merely talking was the thing that made the difference between Egypt and Israel two nations Alico he presented it here they were all human beings all human beings nice people husband wife children and grandparents and everything else or human beings but here this but they're all human beings all God created all the hands of God but the difference when the death penalty was passed the difference between life and that was the token not the pasta not the church not the church name not the elders not not a doctrine like we see when when a boy was coming to us by the Baron and he studied he had a gun in a shootie Bullen and P for the bull but then he had no gun so then he was appear to be gored by the bull and then he said something came over him and then that's something make him good talkable language as a quality if you can talk about language a bull a girl listen to you so you have to talk to the language people understand because I don't gotta talk bull language lion language any animal and I'm go talk to the animals and they understand what is in so I'm gonna speak in tongues it was the language of love now look love this conquer everything or glory their God love love never feels it can feel it's impossible for love the veil everything else good feel but love can fail and that's what God wanted cap the bride off with this bride will be the final revelation of the love of God on the earth that's why realism 2017 is the word the spirit and the bride will say come whoever will weather the windpants on meniscus it doesn't matter they still had to come because the spirit will be upon the bride to find more final ride finally Oh glory to God God open God open this missa missa broad open this open door in the age of Philadelphia he opened a door of the Holy Ghost no man didn't open that door he said that's the door that no man could shut when God open it when God open it moment got shattered when God shuttered no man can open it God open that door befall out this year before coal and miserable and poor and naked God open a Holy Ghost door so no man have to pull your true you have to see that door and know by revelation that you have to get into that door you have to get into the kingdom but when he got push you into the kingdom the kingdom has reached an everyman press Shoto press Soto press every man pressed away into it that is what reality tonight [Applause] if you don't want to use Presta can you fight push strive better be a man keep on moving you can hidden drugs don't book my Amen you're not turning back you're still going forward you're battered and bruised whatever for whatever feeling good tonight we had a press we come tonight to press if no guess when it comes in iOS 5 people will use that press before we close for this and we expect autumn meet us we have crossed back daughter works with us maybe season and only buddies reward people don't deliver the expected go to just get them a land no Hittites the Jebusites no fight just land cut cut with a lawnmower they want to sneak they want a frog they want no insects there were no animals there on a land no tiger no nothing just land and walking with the dog oh god see none of that he's our ticket eel and the Hittites Jebusites this item that I did live in there but the land is yours them demons living all around you but I understand yours don't feel comfortable with them Hittite enter besides serve them notice they have to leave every place them fellas living there they comfortable there but the batter said every place you put seven me by the hittite boy an apartment upstairs optional just off you have announced a living options well the biggest a besides and he had family green and you don't want it is didn't be upstairs and who know she's yours some extensional had to decide are you anymore you're passing them annually hello good morning gotta tell you do that run them all they're not your friends laughing ensemble is the word you know thank not your friends you know because it will kill if they got chance so you had to be paired to fight and press and that's why Caleb said if the Lord be with me I shall be able to try them out I like a lab he's the 80-something years old and he said if the Lord be with me these are giants on the hill I shall be able to judge them out so I could see Caleb civil damages are coming up to get you and that's all you have to begin to speak tonight you're coming out to get because the teams that are revealed belong to us and god save from this river from the river Euphrates from here to dedicate that is yours it's revealed every mystery has been revealed the book where the Torrance is all planned we could go to any part of the world I am the lord I call a guillotine we can go and put our hands upon that and we have to get our healing because what God said that I am THE LORD thy God that healeth thee dr. skocy Luke God is a healer with this God that is a healer he's also deliverer this God as a liver is also a Baptizer this corners about Isaac is also a restorer so the differences in a bribe the church was too token oh my hallelujah Moses had his intellectual experience because he had the information of what he was supposed to be so he figured he had the knowledge

he said like somebody's to love property and hold the property captive then you can take the law and go to this person and the law and forces is pushing to restore this property back this natural owner enforcement and force and then he said we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and as good is a law is a law and Gordon is would meet certain claims to the church for example he shall be like a tree blessed is the man whose delight is in the law of the Lord God see you in the law you in the word you are blessed like not my word that this

go right down on where we don't want to go down but that's where you had to go down go down on our knees and says dustier the Lord he's got to give it up because the Holy Spirit is dear to make him do it the law of the land is to enforce its by the lamb for the land but the law of the Spirit is the spirit is the force eaten the fortune the give up which he has unrightfully and deceitfully taken from God souls of men he took from God so the woman children sicknesses of the body he placed upon people where God made him in His image and to be like him and the chase is given the rightful legal
