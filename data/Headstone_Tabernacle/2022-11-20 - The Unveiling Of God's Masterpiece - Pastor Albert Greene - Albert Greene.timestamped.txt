[53:01] Genesis chapter 1
[53:04] Romans 8 29.
[53:13] Genesis chapter 1
[53:15] verses 26
[53:17] and 27.
[53:21] let us read together just two verses of
[53:24] scripture
[53:26] and God said let us make man in our
[53:30] image after our likeness and let them
[53:34] have dominion over
[53:38] of the sea and over the fall of the air
[53:41] and over the cattle and over all the
[53:45] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[53:48] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[53:52] man in his own image in the image of God
[53:56] created he
[53:58] male and female he created them Romans 8
[54:03] 29
[54:07] amen and amen and amen
[54:14] for whom he did for new he also did
[54:19] predestinate to be conformed to the
[54:22] image of his son that he might be the
[54:25] firstborn among many Brethren may the
[54:29] Lord God bless his precious words to our
[54:31] hearts amen you may be seated
[54:34] I see what God's Prophet once said he
[54:36] said that I ministers never preach a
[54:39] message yet
[54:40] they they take notes they write down
[54:42] things but as the Holy Spirit by
[54:45] inspiration that preaches the message so
[54:48] so we pray God that the Blessed Holy
[54:50] Ghost amen will bless our hearts amen
[54:55] so I'm reminded as God's Prophet said
[54:58] you know you take care when you come
[54:59] before God's people say because if I
[55:01] have a drop of the literal blood of
[55:04] Jesus in a charger how I take care of
[55:06] that how much more you the purchase of
[55:10] the blood
[55:11] God helped me this morning
[55:14] I would like to identify a taught by
[55:17] God's grace
[55:18] the unveiling of God's masterpiece
[55:22] better yet when will God Masterpiece be
[55:27] unveiled when
[55:30] when will God's Masterpiece be unveiled
[55:34] amen
[55:36] we start with this thought that when a
[55:39] Sculptor
[55:40] going to produce a work that is in his
[55:44] mind he has a work in his mind and when
[55:48] he's going to start to produce that work
[55:51] the Sculptor
[55:53] covers the work
[55:59] this this work means nothing to the
[56:02] other people
[56:04] it means something to him
[56:07] you coming along my work the sculptor's
[56:11] work will confuse me
[56:13] it's like The Boatman who said I had to
[56:16] throw it ate both in in a rubber ship
[56:18] because everybody want to come and tell
[56:20] me how to build a boat
[56:21] but the sculptor covers his word
[56:28] his word wrong
[56:33] he has a vision of what he is going to
[56:37] he has something in his mind so he hides
[56:41] the work
[56:42] you don't expose it
[56:44] he masked the work
[56:46] he put on a mask on what he is doing
[56:50] amen because he he who have something in
[56:55] his mind it is in his his mind and he
[57:00] has something he wants to achieve
[57:02] Hallelujah
[57:05] so
[57:07] he now keeps this piece of work covered
[57:12] amen he covers the mask whatever he's
[57:16] doing he don't want nobody get involved
[57:18] with it he don't want nobody to
[57:19] interrupt him you don't want nobody to
[57:22] him come on Church division is his
[57:25] vision the vision is not somebody's
[57:29] Vision his speechland is his vision so
[57:32] because it is his vision anybody else
[57:36] will interrupt it is not a cup it is not
[57:39] a collective Vision it is this Vision so
[57:43] he is working on his vision Hallelujah
[57:49] to The Outsider it would look like
[57:52] nonsense
[57:54] hallelujah it's a nonsense to them some
[57:57] mad manafulla trying to do something in
[57:58] a bad day that's to The Outsider
[58:01] man it don't look like very much
[58:05] and even the outsider get a peep
[58:08] even if you get a peep
[58:11] it confused
[58:13] so it is hidden from him
[58:17] so this sculptor going to go through a
[58:20] period of distress
[58:23] he's going to go through sorrow
[58:25] you're going to go through sweat
[58:28] he going to be confronted with critics
[58:31] maybe even from his own family but he's
[58:35] going to go through critics amen but
[58:38] he's going to stay with his vision
[58:42] you can God is a personal revelation
[58:45] it's a personal Vision you know this is
[58:49] not a collective work this is a personal
[58:51] work blessed be the name of the Lord
[58:56] Glory
[58:58] so sculptor is going to stay with this
[59:01] Vision until his vision is complete
[59:07] hallelujah amen amen so he's going to
[59:11] cover the work
[59:13] until the time come to take off the
[59:17] coverage
[59:18] until the time come to unveil
[59:22] until that time you cannot see what he's
[59:25] doing you cannot grasp what he is doing
[59:28] glory to God amen
[59:32] so when does culture's work is complete
[59:37] amen he unveils the work
[59:40] he takes off the Veil
[59:43] it is a time that he will going to
[59:46] expose what he is doing to the onlooker
[59:50] the onlooker have a time they have to
[59:54] wait their time they have to wait in the
[59:56] background amen until the time comes for
[1:00:01] the onlooker
[1:00:03] it's a church this morning the day will
[1:00:06] arrive amen his work got to be unveiled
[1:00:11] the day will arrive when the curtain
[1:00:15] will be taken off

[1:00:20] unveiling

[1:00:25] church this morning I hope you're seeing
[1:00:27] ahead I hope you know what we're talking
[1:00:29] about I hope you have an idea where we
[1:00:32] going in this morning
[1:00:33] blessed be the name of the Lord so the
[1:00:37] day will arrive when the cloth will be
[1:00:40] taken off to expose what he was doing
[1:00:45] dear is what I am
[1:00:48] this is my product
[1:00:51] this is what I was doing
[1:00:53] the day come that he is going to
[1:00:56] identify
[1:00:58] amen amen is going to be exposed the day
[1:01:03] come when it's going to be revealed what
[1:01:06] is behind of you
[1:01:08] [Applause]
[1:01:10] a lot of people only see in the Veil but
[1:01:13] they don't know what behind of you
[1:01:16] you are available
[1:01:18] [Applause]
[1:01:21] but what is behind that Veil glory to
[1:01:25] God Amen and amen
[1:01:28] so the question this morning
[1:01:31] is
[1:01:32] when will God's masterpieces
[1:01:36] be unveiled
[1:01:42] when
[1:01:44] will God's Masterpiece do you believe
[1:01:47] you are a God's Masterpiece do you
[1:01:50] believe that he's what you are one of
[1:01:52] his masterpiece

[1:01:56] Masterpiece be unveiled
[1:01:59] when his work will be unveiled
[1:02:02] when will it be exposed
[1:02:05] to the onlookers
[1:02:07] when will the curtain be taken off amen
[1:02:12] so this is where we're going to be this
[1:02:14] morning the Lord help us
[1:02:16] when you talk about sculpting
[1:02:19] to outcome on the money called Michelle
[1:02:22] Angelo
[1:02:23] great sculptor amen and it is said of
[1:02:27] him when he was an infant he was nursed
[1:02:31] by a sculptor's wife
[1:02:34] so as he and he got breast milk from a
[1:02:39] sculptor's wife
[1:02:41] implying sculpting was really in his
[1:02:43] blood
[1:02:45] grew up in a sculptural shop amen
[1:02:49] it is also said of him he never marry
[1:02:52] his wife was that art of sculpting amen
[1:02:56] so Mr Angelo
[1:03:00] want to sculpt
[1:03:02] Moses
[1:03:04] there was no picture of Moses
[1:03:06] nobody know how Moses looked like
[1:03:10] and he was going to work on this vision
[1:03:13] of making a skunk of Moses
[1:03:17] amen and amen and it took him a great
[1:03:21] part of his life
[1:03:23] it taken many years to produce
[1:03:26] Moses
[1:03:28] Hallelujah Mitchell Angelo had no
[1:03:30] picture but he had inspiration
[1:03:34] yard inspiration
[1:03:37] hallelujah what Moses look like
[1:03:40] so he did not have a picture but he had
[1:03:43] a picture in his mind
[1:03:45] you had a picture in his mind what Moses
[1:03:49] looked like
[1:03:50] so yeah after yeah
[1:03:53] he worked on the image of Moses
[1:03:57] that was his his vision is that image of
[1:04:01] Moses and one day
[1:04:03] one day
[1:04:05] Vision was no longer Vision one day
[1:04:08] Vision was no longer Vision one day
[1:04:11] Finland became reality
[1:04:14] glory to God
[1:04:22] Larry
[1:04:24] so Vision then became reality
[1:04:29] amen and this Vision looks so real
[1:04:34] this thing looked like it had life in it
[1:04:37] the pattern Looks So Perfect
[1:04:40] it looked like this thing had feelings

[1:04:51] production of Glory to God Amen come on
[1:04:55] church is God producing you thank you

[1:05:18] he got beside himself
[1:05:21] glory to God
[1:05:23] Amen and amen he got beside himself and
[1:05:27] he take a Harmony

[1:05:40] Linda
[1:05:41] blessed be the name of the Lord Glory
[1:05:45] Glory Glory
[1:05:47] but remember
[1:05:49] we want to check the pattern
[1:05:52] the pattern is Michelle Angelo had
[1:05:56] something in his mind
[1:06:00] it's tatted with something in his mind
[1:06:04] it started with a vision
[1:06:07] glory to God
[1:06:09] and the vision is to create the image of
[1:06:15] Moses that's what he wanted he want to
[1:06:18] create the image of Moses he come on
[1:06:22] church he he had displayed it before he
[1:06:25] created
[1:06:26] he got to create the image of Moses he
[1:06:30] got to have that image for us and when
[1:06:33] he have the image then he's going to
[1:06:36] display
[1:06:37] and that image was so good to him it
[1:06:40] wasn't an image
[1:06:42] you get them he was so thrilled that the
[1:06:44] image became a person he thought the
[1:06:47] image at life
[1:06:48] so that is the road he could that's why
[1:06:50] you know in search of a perfect man
[1:06:52] God's Prophet tells us derelicts
[1:06:57] ministers as well as a lady
[1:07:00] right you can't reflect Jesus or you
[1:07:03] can't serve the Lord without Force
[1:07:04] reflecting him you have to first have a
[1:07:07] reflection of him amen so Michelle
[1:07:10] Angelo amen but we want to talk about
[1:07:13] the greatest culture
[1:07:16] amen Michelangelo is an illustration to
[1:07:20] us but we want to look to the greatest
[1:07:22] sculptor Hallelujah the one that's
[1:07:25] called Eternal things

[1:08:29] glory to God here it is
[1:08:32] the Mighty God achieved a man in his own
[1:08:38] image Hallelujah
[1:08:40] but we know this man was by himself
[1:08:45] so God took the masterpiece
[1:08:48] I made him a helmet
[1:08:51] out of the Masterpiece he made a helmet
[1:08:54] God struck the Masterpiece Hallelujah
[1:08:57] and Adam had himself a wife
[1:09:00] and then God take his Masterpiece to the
[1:09:05] split you see you don't have a
[1:09:07] masterpiece and hide it you don't hide
[1:09:09] your Masterpiece so God is ready now to

[1:42:30] Glory but back to the two other thought
[1:42:33] is always correct it takes the perfect
[1:42:36] word
[1:42:37] to bring that Perfect Image
[1:42:40] right at the point I was trying to make
[1:42:42] is that we live in an age
[1:42:44] is that everybody exposed to what is
[1:42:46] called wood everybody
[1:42:49] right but that is not a revelation
[1:42:53] that has caused debate
[1:42:55] that is cause argument
[1:42:57] that is because we are the most
[1:42:58] intellectual Church
[1:43:00] we have the most quote unquote
[1:43:03] revelation
[1:43:05] something that'll drop from your head to
[1:43:07] your heart for you to be a revelation

[1:43:27] the fella who has seen like you
[1:43:28] you go pray for him
[1:43:31] instead of despising him you could trust
[1:43:33] God for him
[1:43:35] Revelation is something different
[1:43:36] brother Revelation is not intellect but
[1:43:40] we live in an intellectual age

[1:47:33] to be tempted
[1:47:35] to be tested by sin
[1:47:38] like Adam did
[1:47:41] but when the testing of his word is over
[1:47:44] then we are taken up to this body
[1:47:48] that was prepared for us before the
[1:47:50] foundation of the world
[1:47:52] it is the word
[1:47:54] that we skipped
[1:47:56] to come here to that
[1:47:59] there would not be no temptation
[1:48:01] we've learned all things
[1:48:04] yes that's the reason Jesus knowed all
[1:48:07] things

[1:54:47] quotation
[1:54:49] here
[1:54:51] we are formed
[1:54:53] to the word image
[1:54:56] here
[1:54:57] to be a partaker of the world
[1:55:00] to feed on the world
[1:55:04] we thank God we can see another light by
[1:55:06] being predestinated since the beginning
[1:55:09] amen so this is a great talk right there
[1:55:11] brother sister amen
[1:55:15] to be a son or daughter of God God had
[1:55:17] to predestinate you
[1:55:19] [Applause]
[1:55:19] [Music]
[1:55:21] isn't the message Rapture there's this
[1:55:23] quotation that I preaching at once
[1:55:25] unless you are a gene of God you're
[1:55:26] finished
[1:55:29] unless you are a gene of God
[1:55:33] you are finished
[1:55:35] you can't make yourself a Christian
[1:55:41] you can't make yourself
[1:55:44] a gene unless God's probably said unless
[1:55:47] you are Gina God
[1:55:49] for instance I cannot bear from my body
[1:55:54] somebody else children
[1:55:56] I could only bear my sons and my
[1:55:59] daughters
[1:56:01] so you have to be in
[1:56:04] to be in God
[1:56:06] before they fall for ocean of the world
[1:56:08] [Applause]
[1:56:09] [Music]

[1:56:11] [Music]
[1:56:12] [Applause]
[1:56:18] is true God's Prophet said it all there
[1:56:20] are some things is not too palatable to
[1:56:23] see among sinners
[1:56:25] but it is the word of God
[1:56:28] Hallelujah my sheep hear my voice
[1:56:32] [Applause]
[1:56:36] amen
[1:56:38] my sheep
[1:56:39] sheep and and my sheep was never big
[1:56:45] my sheep was never a hog
[1:56:48] my sheep was always a sheep
[1:56:51] grew up in a wrong place grew up in a
[1:56:54] wrong atmosphere but one day because
[1:56:57] it's my ship
[1:56:59] because it is mighty
[1:57:02] that sheep will bear my voice and nobody
[1:57:07] could stop them
[1:57:16] glory to God
[1:57:18] yeah man
[1:57:19] [Applause]
[1:57:23] and why in the message why why it had to
[1:57:26] be Shepherds God's Prophet said God has
[1:57:28] an image of you
[1:57:30] God has an image of you
[1:57:33] amen before they formed nation of the
[1:57:35] world
[1:57:37] and though there be a thousand years
[1:57:40] nothing could stop you from coming to
[1:57:43] that Perfect Image that God have of you
[1:57:50] is God
[1:57:54] thank you
[1:57:57] not
[1:58:00] understanding God is not seeing me
[1:58:05] he has seen his image
