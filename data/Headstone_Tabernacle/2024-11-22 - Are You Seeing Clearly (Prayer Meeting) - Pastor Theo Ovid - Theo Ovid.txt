prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for Gathering us together Lord It's about 4 years or so since we have been doing these Zoom meetings and we are grateful for this opportunity that we could connect this way in this time we know a lot of things are happening around the world at this point and we want you to prepare our hearts Lord to hear from you every son and daughter have access to hear from their father speak to us tonight by Your Word speak to us tonight in our rooms in our homes speak to us in our hearts in our Spirits things that we need to know things we need to hear direct from you you said Upon This Rock I build my church you have built and you are building a church that church is built by Revelation May the revelation of God strike the people's heart as we hear your word in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you thanks for being out here and we tapering down this in 2024 and tomorrow we have our last uh sort of service or seminar uh things pertain to life and godliness and we have it like a a financial breakthrough and if you have challenges with your finances and especially how all these Merchants just waiting to collect this Christmas season there because there the anointing that has come down Christmas time to shop the spend and to buy and so on and if you know I want to challenge you don't let it be business as usual uh take a time out and pause and rethink what you do how you do how you spend what you spent on and why and um you know I'm trying to challenge people to think it is not business as usual forget this SK forget how things looking outside things are taking uh place in the spirit realm that is beyond what you could and I could imagine but it's Warfare that is going on right now so tonight I have something special to share with you I hope you are excited like how I am uh but I like you to go to your Bibles and we want to speak from Luke chapter 6 a couple of verses there from 27 and we will hear what Jesus have to say from Luke chapter 6 we want to read from verse 27 Luke chapter 6 verse 27 but I sayto you which hear love your enemies so this is Christianity in action here love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you pray for them which despitefully use you unto him that smiteth thee on the One Cheek offer him also the other him that taketh away thy cloak forbid him not to take thy quat also give to every man that ask it of thee of him that taketh away thy Goods ask them not again and as he would that men would do to you do you do also to them likewise if you love them which love you what thank have ye for Sinners also love those who love them and if you do good to them which do good to you what than have ye for Sinners also do even the same and if he lend to them of whom he hope to receive what T have you for Sinners also lend to Sinners to receive as much again but love ye your enemies and do good lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and he shall be the CH of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful andto the evil be therefore merciful as your father also is merciful judge not and he shall not be judged condemn not he shall not be condemned forgive and he shall be forgiven give and it shall be given unto you good measure press down shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with it shall be measure to you again and he spake a parable unto them can the blind lead the blind shall they not both fall into the ditch verse 14 the disciple is not above his master interesting praise afterwards but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master this is the part I want to get down to verse 41 why beholdest thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but perceivest not the beam that is in th own eye either how can thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mo that is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first The Beam of out of thine own eye and then Thou shalt See Clearly to pull out the moat that is in thy brother's eye for a good tree bringeth forth not corrupt fruit neither that a corrupt tree bringeth forth good fruit for every tree is known by his own fruit may God bless his word so we have something here tonight I have a little title for it are you seeing clearly are you seeing clearly all right let's brother Brown he was reading the scripture as many as I love I rebuke and Chason be zealous therefore and repent and brother was saying here this is the same message that John had cried out repent there is no other cause there's no other course now there's no other way get back to God there's no other way now it is repent listen to these words change your mind turn around repent for while will you die so some people mind in a frozen Condition it's fixed it's stubborn it's bullheaded it is just how it is but repentance means to change change your mind now listen to this I know we said it before but I want you to hear it again tonight there's a reason why I'm going here let us examine the first phrase as many as I love in the Greek the emphasis is upon the personal PR I he does not say as many would feel he should say as many as love me no sir we must never try to make Jesus the object of human love in this verse no it is the many that are the loved ones of God it is his love in question not ours so once again we find ourselves gloring in Salvation his purpose his plan we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignity of God even as he said in Romans 9:13 Jacob have I loved does it now obtain that since he loved only the many is he therefore in a state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn n to him by no means is this so for he declared in Romans 93 Esau have I hated and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither having done good or evil that the purpose of God according to the election might stand not of works but of him that call it this love is elective love it is his love for his elect and his love for them is apart from Human Merit okay glory to God this is this is enough to run out your chair right now he say his love for them is apart from Human Merit this is his love we talking about for it says that the purpose of God stands in election which is exactly opposite to works or anything man has in himself so because before the children were born you already said Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated now let's drill long now to us now now he says to his own as many as I love I rebuke and chasen this is the part here now to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view of Correction so it is not exposing for exposing sake he's not rebuking his children for just rebuke sake he's not correcting them just for correction sake no he's he's rebuking them because he says chasing doesn't mean to punish it means to discipline because the subject amendment is in mind just as we could discipline our children because we want them to stay right now this amendment in Behavior relates to a deliberate change or Improvement in someone's action habits attitudes so when he says discipline because he have the subject amendment in mind he means he is looking to see change in this subject talking about us now change in our actions in our habits in our attitudes it implies that the person has recognized the need for growth or correction and making an effort to get their behavior lined up to better standards values and expectations change so I don't want you to hear this tonight just as words pelting out because I have some examples here like someone want to improve their communication style some of us we have a certain way we speak and we have been speaking that way for years but we could shift it we could change it from being critical to being more encouraging everybody know like like a little critic everything you to criticize you to criticize you criticize but where's the encouragement or like if somebody is working and they missing deadlines that they could adjust better time management that they wouldn't be complaining you miss the deadline you miss the deadline you miss the deadline so everybody in every area have to adjust a manager who give vague instructions and have to learn how to communicate clearly to give specific guidance to a team or a person that recognize they lack generosity the the people mean and stingy they give no one they help no one they serve no one they are for themselves and the themselves only then they if they recognize that they need to be more generous that would need an adjustment a wife or husband who always interrupting when they have communicating always a spouse any one of them and they could adjust to say you know what I would listen respectfully I would listen again I don't have to interrupt and but and say listen or student who missing the homework and and slacking their work but say you know what I'm going to adjust I'm going to take time off to study I'm going to get off a games I'm going to apply myself because I want to get my exam or spender coming as Christmas time here who always over over the budget they don't even know what the expenses are so they're spending freely and they crashing their finances freely because they don't want to adjust and sit down and think through or parent who with their children in a strict manner without re listening to what a child is going through and how to deal the manner with a child so let's go to the story that Jesus G here and the story Jesus give here is which one of you having a mo seeing a moot in your brother eye and then you have a beam in your eye now a mo is a speck or a splinter or a chip of wood it's interesting because both the moat and the beam is of the same material one happen to be very small more tiny and one happen to be a beam a big piece of wood and Jesus used this word in this Parable to deal with the self-righteous people who look for specks of dust in the eyes of others while ignoring planks lugs or beams of wood in their own eyes and refer to them as Hypocrites this is church folks right we not talking about people outside you're referring to the hypocrisy of people who try to improve others while remaining blind to their own faults this word MO is a aric English word referring to small particles or spec and when Jesus used it is an example to contrast a slight moral fault one may enjoy pointing out in others while neglecting one's own heinous fault represent by the log plank beam in one eye that is why we ask are you seeing clearly a log how Jesus call it a beam and the way he say a beam is like a big blockage and a big that beam will distort one's vision and to see this small moat in somebody's eye and having this big beam it means that you can't see right you're not seeing right Our obligation is to put out our lives those glaring fors that prevents us from properly appraising the character of another before we seek to deal with tiny fults of someone the person with the l in his eye who attempts to deal with the tiny force of another Jesus called them a hypocrite a hypocrite and this is what we have to get away from I won't beong with you tonight but the thing about it and what I love is the object is not just to say look you have a mo no the object is how do I help that brother because Jesus was trying to bring a point that we need some level of self-reflection some level of how to say it when you begin to examine you examine yourself that you could realize the obstruction of your faults sins failures whatever you have affects you from seeing clearly to help another you ever get something small in your eye and it but in you a little tiny with or something whether it's a piece of cloth or piece of tread or something of dust and you keep rubbing eye is miserable it is harassing it is terrible it's not a big thing but it's an irritant in your eye and they keep rubbing sometime you get eye gets red and you warn Somebody Sometime you pull your eye up and they say blow it blow it that happen to me already and somebody and it blowing this little spot out your Idols whatever it is so therefore this introspection I could use the word or self uh you know self you know you're looking at yourself then helps you to be able to clear up the stuff around you that you could effectively and clearly see how you could help your brother with the beam in thine eye you're staring at your brother's little failure pulling out the beam that you can see clearly not only the fault but how to get your brother to get rid of it that is the ultimate goal is not and you see this is what happened to people people just mounting the self making acquisition put talking on fors condemning this one judging this one criticizing this one criticizing this one with no help in mind the object is to criticize and then when you go and talk it with somebody else you're adding you know layer on top of Labor of fault finding criticizing judging and you're adding like a spirit atmosphere towards a particular person but listen to the same scripture in Matthew chapter 7 you don't have to find it Jesus was saying it judge not that he may not be judged for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged and with what measure you met it shall be measured to you again for why beholdest thou the mo that is in thy brother's eye but considerest not the beam in thine own eye how will thou say to thy brother let me pull out the moood out of th eye and behold a beam is in th own eye th hypocrite first here we go cast out the beam out of th own eye get it out whatever it is that beam could be that Pride that beam could be jealousy that beam could be mean meanness that beam could be greedy that you could put that Beam for whatever it is but he said get that out it then thou sht See Clearly the cast out the mo out of thy brother's eye so this to cast out the Lord's word assume the object of SC is not only or mainly detection but correction so you're not trying just to detect or see somebody's faults or somebody failures or somebody shortcomings but you want to be able to help correct so therefore you have to see clearly God help us tonight and he Amplified and I want to close you know it talk about a student is not above his master here this a pupil is not Superior to his teacher but everyone when he is completely trained readjusted restored sets to rights and perfected will be as his teacher this is beautiful will be as their lord when you come into that maturity why do you see the spec that's in your brother's eye do not notice and consider the beam or Timber that is in your own eye how can you say to your brother brother allow me to take out the speck that is in your eye when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye you actor Pretender hypocrite first take the beam out of your own eye and then and then you shall see clearly to take out the spec that in your brother's eye for there is no good healthy tree that bears decayed worthless stale fruit nor the other hand does decayed w stickly tree bear good fruit for each tree is known and identified by its own fruit let's let's recap as we close a moat a small Speck of Splinter a beam a large piece of wood Jesus was identifying self-reflection and encouraging us as individuals to address our own shortcomings before criticizing other he is making us aware or making us to become self-aware of our of of our own self and so before confronting someone about your mistakes take time for honest self-reflection are there areas in your life where you struggle with similar issues and attitudes so the question tonight is are you seeing clearly almost done removing the beam before helping others mood emphas ize the importance of introspection or self-reflection if you are in a position as a parent as a leader we have to make sure as leaders and that's the position we are in that we our life is reflecting the principles that we are pressing others to to stand up to them so that we become authentic and original where we we we live our word our word is true true to us and therefore we say it is true to us we demand it of ourselves first then we can demand it out of you so this clear this see this beam is not just to take the beam out it's for you to see clearly for I to see clearly that we could properly help our Brethren so Jesus is saying before you could really help somebody effectively with their stuff get your stuff in order he didn't say ignore what in the person's eye he did not say that don't bother with that no you see it you know it is something there but you want to get that person helped you want to connect with that person that they could get their breakthrough and deliverance you see that mod you want to help them but you have to check yourself and make sure that you are seeing clearly so Jesus is insisting that we have a Clear Vision before helping others and what we call constructive you know some people there criticize well is only constructive criticism but they want to destroy you you know they hitting your hard they coming down at you and they call it constructive criticism behind their bitterness and the anger and so on but Galatians 6 tells us Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself least thou also be tempted so the Bible is also saying when you see somebody with a fault look at the approach we have to have in getting that person back on track in the Amplified it says Brethren if any person is overtaken in a misconduct or sin or of any sort You Are Spiritual who are responsive to and controlled by the spirit should set him right and restore and reinstate him without any sense of superiority with all gentleness keeping an attentive eye on yourself least you should be tempted also so Saints this is what his PRM is about tonight addressing self-reflection addressing any beam that may affect us from seeing l Street thingss I could identify here he says Jesus talk about the hypocrite so he was saying you have to cleanse your own life before you can help others then he reference this cast The Beam out of thine own eye which is a type of pgeon get rid of stuff TR it out and then you shall see clearly to cast out the moat out of thy brother's eye so we cannot we cannot live hypocritically and able to help others spiritually let's go Heavenly Father these few words I pray that you would write them in the people's heart a time of self introspection a type of self-awareness a type of Consciousness that how we are doing it's so easy to talk about others we talk less about our own selves it's so easy to see others fall fults and failure and we turn a blind eye to what we see in us but this word Lord this word of Truth this word of righteousness these Parables that Jesus brought have so much depth and Revelation and inspiration in it it BR brings Clarity to how life supposed to be and the purpose you put us on Earth bless the people tonight as we wait upon you in Jesus name I ask it amen amen I before we go into actual prayer I want to play something for you tonight want to share some you tonight a tee that I have here and um let's see if I can get it praise the Lord yes I want to share and then we get on into prayer for their native song of farewell Jay Edwin was so
