[45:28] he shall bring forth the headstone
[45:31] thereof with shoutings crying grease

[45:40] cried also in mine ears with a lot
[45:42] voicing caused them that have charged
[45:44] over the city to draw near even every
[45:47] man with his destroyed weapon in his
[45:49] hand and behold six men came from the
[45:51] way of the higher gate which lied
[45:53] towards the north and every man a
[45:55] slaughter weapon in his hand and one man
[45:57] among them was clear with linen with a
[46:00] writer's inkhorn by his side and they
[46:02] went in and stood beside a brazen altar
[46:04] and the glory of the God of Israel was
[46:07] gone up from the chair
[46:08] whereupon he was to the threshold of the
[46:09] house and he called to the man clothed
[46:12] linen which had the writers ink one by
[46:14] his side and the Lord said unto Him the
[46:18] Lord said unto him go to the midst of
[46:21] the city through the midst of Jerusalem
[46:22] and set a mark upon the foreheads of the
[46:26] men that sigh and that cry for all the
[46:28] abominations that be done in the midst
[46:31] thereof unto the others he said in my
[46:33] hearing go ye after him through the city
[46:35] and smite let not your eyes spear
[46:39] neither Javie pity slay utterly all and
[46:44] young both maids a little children and
[46:47] woman but come not near any man upon
[46:50] whom is the mark and begin at my
[46:53] sanctuary then they begin are the
[46:56] ancient men which were before the house
[46:59] or last scripture reading some first
[47:04] Peter chapter 4 verse 17 for the time
[47:10] has come that judgment must begin at the
[47:13] house of God and never just first begin
[47:17] at us what shall the end be of them that
[47:21] will be not the gospel of God and if the
[47:24] righteous scarcely be seen where shall
[47:27] the ungodly and the sinner appear let us
[47:31] pray father we thank you for your word
[47:32] and we thank you for the Scriptures been
[47:33] read and I and I pray you take me out of
[47:36] the way and circumcised the hearers of
[47:40] the word circumcise my own heart I mean
[47:42] your torch drop down Lord and speak lip
[47:44] to hear to your people even as your
[47:46] promise that the spirit and the bride
[47:47] will speak the spirit come upon the
[47:50] bride and speak the world and the world
[47:51] we hear direct from God may the
[47:53] believers hear hear direc from you this
[47:56] morning granted Lord in GSM I ask at a
[47:58] man you may be seated
[47:59] or praise the Lord don't know how many
[48:04] of you have heard Wednesday night
[48:06] service if you have no good Wednesday
[48:07] night service go back and listen to it
[48:10] and I know it was something that the
[48:13] Lord give and I believe it will bless
[48:15] you the angel from the east
[48:18] having the seal of the Living God this
[48:22] is not more brother and special minister
[48:26] or bishop or whatever it is this is the
[48:29] Holy Spirit God's even angel so this
[48:35] morning of an inspiration of two
[48:37] scriptures sort of context scriptures
[48:39] there's some acts 19 I want to read it
[48:41] and he came to pass that while Apollo's
[48:43] was at Corinth Paul having passed
[48:45] through the upper coast came to Ephesus
[48:47] and finance it and disciples he said
[48:49] unto them have ye received the Holy
[48:51] Ghost since you believed and they said
[48:53] unto Him we have not understood whether
[48:56] there be any all he goes so this was a
[48:58] new ting all together they haven't heard
[49:00] about this thing called Holy Ghost and
[49:03] when he said unto them unto what will
[49:04] you baptize this another John baptism
[49:06] and he's then paul said john verily
[49:10] baptized with the baptism of repentance
[49:11] similar to the people that they should
[49:13] believe on him which should come after
[49:15] him that is done Christ Jesus
[49:17] when they it is they were baptized in
[49:19] the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul
[49:22] had laid his hands upon them here we go
[49:24] the Holy Ghost came on them and they
[49:30] speak with tongues and prophesied
[49:32] so this Holy Ghost not a imaginary thing
[49:35] it could come on you it could come into
[49:38] you
[49:39] it could fill you Oprah do believe that
[49:43] it's not a explainin ting explain you
[49:46] have it already and no no no we not
[49:48] explain all of that this is what he will
[49:50] say so Amanda Paul laid his hands upon
[49:53] them I went poorly as hell upon them the
[49:58] Holy Ghost came on them and they speak
[50:00] with tongues and prophesied by the other
[50:02] scripture I have is Matthew 5:6 from in
[50:04] the scripture blessed are they which do
[50:07] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[50:11] for they shall be filled
[50:14] not educated not in form not to bring at
[50:19] a booth they shall be filled those who
[50:25] hunger in and to stand after
[50:27] righteousness
[50:28] so the title this morning is seal dosed
[50:31] at Sian cry that's the title dis morning
[50:34] seal those that sigh and cry you know
[50:39] Jesus said as one of these a sudden man
[50:41] switch B come in and they eat they drank
[50:44] they bought the soul and different
[50:46] things like that
[50:46] normal livin different nothing look this
[50:51] up them that happen no they eat the
[50:52] drunk is soul but luck was luck was
[50:55] called out and when luck came out fire
[50:58] fell so you can wash disguise and you
[51:01] can watch the Sun any moon and you can't
[51:03] watch or the grass growing and and corn
[51:05] barren and you're getting fruit and some
[51:07] on harvests it can't just watch that if
[51:09] doors you will you have to focus on what
[51:12] God said and then you could get clarity
[51:14] or what I stopped think this is please
[51:16] it didn't get you it tuned into you know

[52:05] Angel and the plagues was commissioned
[52:07] by God don't come near any of those who

[1:02:50] I'm the way the truth and the life he is
[1:02:52] the world is not right and when the
[1:02:54] churches did they reject how can we ever

[1:05:10] with an e Men because the Holy Spirit
[1:05:13] will not lead you any other way
[1:05:15] Oh glory to God so you could only
[1:05:17] confirm the word when you hear the word
[1:05:20] your spirit your heart you say Amen so
[1:05:25] you see you need a guide he will guide
[1:05:28] you to truth and the truth is the world
[1:05:30] and it always has been God has never had
[1:05:33] to change nothing but his infinite and
[1:05:37] he knows what's best he is omnipresent
[1:05:40] he's omniscient he's God is not right
[1:05:43] and the Holy Ghost the guide is the
[1:05:45] confirma
[1:05:46] of the word that he is teaching so if
[1:05:50] the Holy Spirit is teaching he confirms
[1:05:52] the word that he is teaching this he
[1:05:54] doesn't confirm it then something wrong
[1:05:56] with it but he's the consumer of the
[1:05:58] word he is teaching or glory to God and
[1:06:02] Luke said Luke was led by the guy to say
[1:06:05] go into all the world and preach the
[1:06:07] gospel to every creature he that
[1:06:08] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:06:10] he that believeth not shall be damned
[1:06:12] and please sign shall follow them that
[1:06:13] believe
[1:06:15] what was it signs following what was it
[1:06:18] the guide vindicated that was to the
[1:06:20] truth that was gotcha policy
[1:06:22] that's the Whitley down that's his
[1:06:24] program it can change them it because
[1:06:26] he's infinite he can't change from it he
[1:06:29] is God I can't I can change
[1:06:32] I'm a man you can change your man a
[1:06:35] woman
[1:06:36] but God cannot change I am finite I can
[1:06:40] make mistakes and say things that is
[1:06:41] wrong the whole that is how did that
[1:06:44] compare to all these ministers with more
[1:06:47] mistakes are made like if they absolute
[1:06:49] how does this you know what a prophecy
[1:06:52] you know I am finite I can make mistakes
[1:06:55] and see things that are wrong no it's
[1:06:59] easy if you're saying that I wrong we
[1:07:01] come back and say we're sorry we said
[1:07:04] the wrong thing if we do something wrong
[1:07:06] with wrong wrong can be right wrong is
[1:07:11] wrong one minute says that infinite and
[1:07:14] absolute suddenly make some big goons
[1:07:17] and bigotes

[1:12:31] explaining mistakes and Grahm can make
[1:12:32] more mistakes on top the mistakes they
[1:12:39] call it Dublin del W on to make a
[1:12:44] feeling right my steer behind a word now
[1:12:49] that the guide leads you family or no
[1:12:54] family friend or no friend people don't
[1:12:59] know that yet he will guide you into all
[1:13:09] truth
[1:13:10] I reveal these things to you I've talked
[1:13:11] to you about he will show you that he
[1:13:13] will tell you things that is to come the
[1:13:15] true God don't go to the bishop go to
[1:13:19] the guide don't go to anyone but the
[1:13:23] guide he's the one that was sent to
[1:13:26] guide you what if I for ministry is for
[1:13:30] let's go to again and that's the
[1:13:32] Ministry of Christ and a form of paths
[1:13:33] the teacher prophet is for the
[1:13:35] perfecting scenes and that is a
[1:13:37] revelation by itself you can't just say
[1:13:38] like them coming up affect you and pinch
[1:13:40] you up with all them colors and then
[1:13:42] they will finally paint you over it's
[1:13:43] not that for the perfectional saints for
[1:13:46] the work wo RK has a work not for the on
[1:13:51] the tone of the ministry for the work of
[1:13:54] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:13:56] body of Christ till we all come so that
[1:14:01] all all come into the unity so we have
[1:14:06] the faith now all over but where is the
[1:14:08] unity of the faith
[1:14:09] so something have to step forward to
[1:14:11] bring about the unity of the faith but
[1:14:15] that faith has to be identified
[1:14:16] come on reason to me push back to me not
[1:14:20] unity of the message unity of the faith
[1:14:25] but that's what the Prophet came to tell
[1:14:28] us about you the faith of the father's
[1:14:31] not message politics the faith of the
[1:14:34] fathers what they had and the father had
[1:14:38] a hard week over 30 scriptures
[1:14:42] descriptors daylight when the day of
[1:14:45] Pentecost was fully come descriptors
[1:14:47] Carol I still ran gold have I none such
[1:14:50] as I have I give it a descriptor scale I
[1:14:52] won't blow it they were beaten and I
[1:14:55] went back to service and they call upon
[1:14:56] God honor never refill with the Holy
[1:14:59] Ghost descriptor scale I is that the
[1:15:02] dynamics of this church will be a refill
[1:15:06] of the Holy Ghost not more talk get the
[1:15:09] Lord a show when they ask for for power

[1:59:08] that joy this morning it's the joy of
[1:59:10] the Lord this is our strength
[1:59:19] may this is that his human element get
[1:59:25] busted out the believers they had all
[1:59:29] things in common they painted tights
[1:59:32] painting they're offering the
[1:59:34] contributing to the church under the
[1:59:36] cause of the gospel some promise to sell
[1:59:39] and bring and share nobody asked him to
[1:59:42] do
[1:59:42] they were fallen t really do listing an
[1:59:45] ass is a fire up butter an ass sis a
[1:59:48] fire shaking their hands every Sunday
[1:59:51] they come and bring the goods before
[1:59:53] Peter and said he said is this all just
[1:59:56] happened to see that and it is all just
[1:59:58] in case this is a dumb payment and you
[2:00:01] call me buddy rest next week
[2:00:03] this year a wall to show you how this
[2:00:11] thing is not human Peter said you didn't
[2:00:14] lie to me you lie to the Holy Ghost so
[2:00:19] the Holy Ghost discerned the fact that
[2:00:21] there was a lie idea the husband dropped
[2:00:25] down dead the person Pramod his wife
[2:00:29] because if I flew he's a liar she live
[2:00:31] with him she know the manager Oscar he
[2:00:35] dead already
[2:00:39] you go back him up
[2:00:45] she lied to another call delgros funeral
[2:00:51] home take them all after that nobody
[2:00:56] joining is using crank up the church
[2:01:01] nobody talked another after that the
[2:01:04] whole thing change because the people
[2:01:06] themselves realize God is in the midst
[2:01:10] of those people it is not a game
[2:01:14] stop playing Oh Gloria God
[2:01:21] this wasn't a man imposing himself on
[2:01:24] the people saying is the faithful
[2:01:26] minister or his son Minnie Solomon or he
[2:01:28] is whatever you want to think either be
[2:01:30] meaning apostle or mean it is no no no
[2:01:33] many versions this was the operation of
[2:01:37] God
[2:01:39] these are Amanda Lee preferred bits in
[2:01:41] the people beaten them because you have
[2:01:43] Authority bully pulpit bullying people
[2:01:46] from in the pulpit and beaten them in
[2:01:48] line this is not that this is the
[2:01:51] operation of God and the Prophet
[2:01:53] prophesied not gonna repeat what gonna
[2:01:56] repeat the same Holy Ghost coming back
[2:01:59] in operation so here this year the
[2:02:03] parent when I get to you cannot say I
[2:02:06] know Peter he's a liar he's a teenager
[2:02:10] he's a curse but that was what he was
[2:02:15] but you was not dear to see what
[2:02:18] happened to him what he is
[2:02:22] Oh what God made him so your
[2:02:31] responsibility is to have respect in
[2:02:33] fact I respect the man respect the
[2:02:36] office he holes have respect recopies
[2:02:41] [Music]
[2:02:45] and I told a bunch of ministers and
[2:02:48] Trinidad I said let me tell you

[2:02:52] anyone who commands a breach I said
[2:02:55] because I have not so no Cesar gets
[2:02:56] nobody in Trinidad I said the reason for
[2:03:01] is I don't know who quad will change
[2:03:03] from Saul to Paul I don't know who God
[2:03:07] want to use who taught to anoint so my
[2:03:10] responsibility is the key from
[2:03:12] foolishness and from nonsense and I did
[2:03:15] that so I have been after mine against
[2:03:22] no church against no pastor no minister
[2:03:24] I deliberately did that by choice to
[2:03:31] keep your heart and mind clean that you

[2:03:35] sell I know they can't invite me because
[2:03:40] they're my problems with me

[2:15:25] heart ought to be to him back to
[2:15:26] faithful to pull along this this
[2:15:30] capstone never see we right that is
[2:15:34] wrong but the cup of perfection which is
[2:15:38] the power of love after come seal the
[2:15:43] brand up up here diamonds is a long long
[2:15:48] time my voice hasn't gone like this but
[2:15:50] let me just continue here right now this
[2:15:53] water was stopped listen to what went on
[2:15:56] at a deeper level we know what whoooo
[2:15:58] one lemon towel and and so on but at a
[2:16:01] deeper level 1933
[2:16:02] God gave but at random seven visions
[2:16:04] which he said must come to pass before
[2:16:07] Jesus coming in the seventh vision is
[2:16:11] when America was bombed up we're not
[2:16:14] even sure America making the Tribulation
[2:16:16] Period bombs all over America America
[2:16:20] destroyed listen to what he said the he
[2:16:24] said the world went to war 1914 never
[2:16:27] been pissed peace since constantly
[2:16:28] swinging and swinging and swinging and
[2:16:30] they are doing it the very same thing
[2:16:32] yet and what was good doing talking
[2:16:34] about the Angels more length he said Oh
[2:16:36] God have mercy
[2:16:37] hold him that great thing that I saw in
[2:16:41] the vision the whole thing becomes a
[2:16:44] destruction wall in the atomic hole in
[2:16:47] the wars that they don't destroy
[2:16:48] themselves until the thing come to
[2:16:50] destroy it until is returns back and
[2:16:53] gets herself with together and then the
[2:16:55] message will go to Israel and she'll be
[2:16:57] sealed with the seal of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:59] after the Gentiles is called out the
[2:17:02] people for his name's sake will be
[2:17:04] called out which is this age right here
[2:17:06] now then Israel only receives a tree and
[2:17:09] a half and six-month message so Israel
[2:17:13] only and a half years left for a message
[2:17:16] with Moses Elijah those two lamps those
[2:17:19] two standing by the lamps those two
[2:17:22] trees it's not right
[2:17:23] Moses and Elijah just read a half years
[2:17:26] for them the Gentiles you and I it is
[2:17:29] called the times of the Gentiles it is
[2:17:32] called until the fullness of the
[2:17:34] come in we have no specific time the
[2:17:37] Bible talk about we call it the times of
[2:17:40] the Gentiles until the fullness of the
[2:17:42] Gentiles come in so in other words once
[2:17:44] this come in and the seal of God begin
[2:17:48] to be applied to your heart and life it
[2:17:50] is over this book is then closed so you
[2:17:55] don't have all the time to mix that
[2:17:58] because the slaughter in angel is next
[2:18:01] after the ink one writer went forth
[2:18:03] first with a commission to put a mark
[2:18:06] upon those hallelujah not upon those who
[2:18:11] say in the message not upon doors going
[2:18:13] to church doors have certain
[2:18:15] characteristics that tsiyon cry
[2:18:19] that means the burden go and beyond you
[2:18:21] it can be selfish for this thing you you
[2:18:25] see what is happening you know you need
[2:18:27] a manifestation of God you needed fire

[2:18:49] to increase in pay you increase coming
[2:18:51] because you're praying seek first the
[2:18:53] kingdom and all other things will be
[2:18:56] added rich you will be added deliverance

[2:19:01] you want more ties or my host what I've
[2:19:04] planted after give

[2:19:14] returned on preach to the Jews two men
[2:19:16] anointed with that spirit isn't that
[2:19:20] right
[2:19:21] and then about a third of the earth was
[2:19:23] blown to bits at that time until it of
[2:19:27] the earth Sheba listen for these foolish
[2:19:30] virgins if that man with the ink one
[2:19:39] writer was the Holy Ghost we realize
[2:19:43] everybody reads the Bible so is the same
[2:19:47] angel coming again with the Holy Ghost
[2:19:51] the last enemy the last plague that
[2:19:54] struck the earth was dead and the last
[2:19:57] enemy that's gonna strike the church
[2:19:58] snow is dead strike the what judge dead
[2:20:04] spiritually speaking those who will not
[2:20:08] follow Christ and the baptism of the
[2:20:10] Holy Spirit will spiritually dry up and
[2:20:13] die the churches you can see it now oh
[2:20:24] my you say are you a Christian that's

[2:22:09] mysteries from heaven from below from on
[2:22:14] top from beside from everywhere else in

[2:29:32] shaking inside idea you are then sealed
[2:29:34] until the day of redemption
[2:29:36] he said God come along to find a lot of
[2:29:39] foolishness in us he just don't see it
[2:29:41] yet he sees a lot of unbelief he just
[2:29:44] don't steal it yet Oh glory to God so
[2:29:47] here we go
[2:29:48] and one the church itself when it
[2:29:51] strikes the power of God the baptism of
[2:29:53] the Holy Ghost out of denominational
[2:29:55] churches he's talking with us now out of
[2:29:58] the Catholic Church otama in the message
[2:30:00] now wherever it is when the baptism of
[2:30:03] the Holy Ghost is made real to the
[2:30:04] people when them that are predestinated
[2:30:07] like you people here they tell you life
[2:30:08] ceases and walks on it it's a super sign
[2:30:11] it has to be made real to you
[2:30:13] you mean this Holy Ghost yes for you to
[2:30:17] be baptized with the Holy Ghost yes
[2:30:19] you're not contented just to be the
[2:30:21] message no you want the real thing Oh
[2:30:23] glory to God and he promised we know
[2:30:27] that the scripture say that Jesus is the
[2:30:29] chief Cornerstone he also has a
[2:30:30] headstone now if we will remember that
[2:30:32] the 70s Messenger was to restore the
[2:30:35] faith of the churun back to the father's
[2:30:37] in other words rebuild it again under
[2:30:39] the power of the Spirit Oh glory to God
[2:30:42] I wanna my give there are some prizes
[2:30:52] [Applause]
[2:30:54] whoo I know I jump in just listen to
[2:31:10] this know in this rupture in time there
[2:31:14] will come a time know that this bride
[2:31:18] will that rejects the head part of the
[2:31:22] bride so it should be this church that
[2:31:25] rejects the head part of the bride will
[2:31:28] have to suffer for her rejection because
[2:31:31] the gospel wasn't made plain to them
[2:31:33] back there it's Miriam to you today see
[2:31:36] it was made plain you done all these
[2:31:38] years and examples the season so he's
[2:31:41] saying there will come a time when the
[2:31:44] head part will be rejected and the
[2:31:47] people that reject the head part will
[2:31:49] have to suffer fear the head part is the
[2:31:54] headstone the best part is the capstone
[2:31:57] the head part is a dynamics Jesus is the
[2:32:00] cornerstone he is also the headstone and
[2:32:02] he was a cornerstone of what the early
[2:32:05] church our church he comes to keep off
[2:32:07] the breath so therefore you have to grow
[2:32:09] into the pyramid that you're pretty
[2:32:10] maybe capped off you yourself
[2:32:13] has to become a pyramid and he come into
[2:32:15] the cap to your pyramid the individual
[2:32:18] pyramid so you have a promise of him
[2:32:21] coming to you or glory that God quickly
[2:32:25] now
[2:32:25] after the baddest rap that is a question
[2:32:27] answers will any of the foolish women be
[2:32:29] same or will they all be lost he said
[2:32:31] will the fully be saved no whatever
[2:32:35] happens no after that time she she fully
[2:32:39] version will have to go to the
[2:32:41] Tribulation Period and the reason for it
[2:32:44] is because she has rejected the
[2:32:47] atonement in its fullness
[2:32:50] and I was they believe pastor the
[2:32:51] message not all the message or glory
[2:32:55] d'accord
[2:32:55] what she is a believer a professed
[2:32:58] believer but she will have to go through
[2:33:00] the tribulation period so you don't want
[2:33:02] to be a professor believer you want to
[2:33:05] be a believer with the proof possession
[2:33:07] not a believer with the profession did
[2:33:13] you get that you want to be a believer
[2:33:15] with the possession you actually have a
[2:33:19] possession not a profession Oh glory to
[2:33:23] God hallelujah my god here we go
[2:33:29] and is abomino clues when the spirit
[2:33:33] falls not if Saul told whether that mean
