[32:42] something good is about to happen and
[32:44] something great is in
[32:46] store amen amen amen thank you Jesus
[32:51] hallu at this time I just want to switch
[32:56] over so the word portion of the
[33:03] service
[33:05] amen you love him
[33:15] tonight amen thank you Jesus and just a
[33:19] a little thought I have to share
[33:22] tonight and I know
[33:28] I know that it'll be a blessing
[33:30] amen so if you have your Bibles I'd like
[33:34] you to turn with me to a very familiar
[33:38] scripture from The Book of Matthew
[33:41] reading chapter
[33:42] 19 vers 16- 22 we'll read for
[33:56] now when you get it say
[34:02] amen and this speaks of the what we
[34:05] funly call the Rich Young
[34:07] Ruler
[34:16] amen and reading from verse 16 it says
[34:19] and behold one came and said unto him
[34:21] good Master what good thing shall I do
[34:25] that I may have eternal life
[34:28] and he said unto him why call thou me
[34:31] good there is none good but one that is
[34:33] God but if thou wil enter into life keep
[34:37] the Commandments he said unto him
[34:40] which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder
[34:44] Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou
[34:47] shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear
[34:49] false witness honor thy father and thy
[34:51] mother and thou shallal love thy
[34:53] neighbor as thyself the young man said
[34:56] unto him
[34:58] all these things have I kept from my
[35:00] youth up what lack I yet Jesus said unto
[35:04] him if thou will be perfect go and sell
[35:08] that thou Hast and give to the poor and
[35:11] thou shalt have treasure in heaven and
[35:13] come and follow me but when the young
[35:16] man heard that saying he went away
[35:18] sorrowful for he had great
[35:22] possessions let's just bow our heads and
[35:24] pray once more oh Heavenly Father
[35:28] Lord we thank you once again when we
[35:30] pause at this time lord as we've read
[35:31] your word Lord I pray that you would
[35:33] breath life into it Lord that you'll
[35:35] open our understanding Lord that that
[35:37] you will speak lip to air to your people
[35:38] tonight Lord I pray that you would take
[35:41] me out of the way and have your perfect
[35:43] will tonight in Jesus name amen you may
[35:46] have your seats you know and I read that
[35:48] portion of the scripture and and hope
[35:50] hopefully we would continue in a little
[35:52] bit reading some more
[35:55] but for a title I want to speak on the
[35:58] main
[35:59] thing right the main thing that's it
[36:03] just the main thing we don't want to
[36:05] deal with too much sides shows and go
[36:08] around in circles we want to talk about
[36:11] the main thing want to address the main
[36:13] thing
[36:15] amen can you for a second just imagine
[36:18] if somebody says you know I want to I
[36:19] want to bake a a bread I'm not much of a
[36:21] baker but if been bacon bread and they
[36:24] say you know what I have the Oren the
[36:25] Oren is preheated to whatever
[36:27] temperature the preheat ovens and they
[36:30] have everything laid out there you know
[36:32] the bowls the I don't know water salt
[36:36] baking powder probably yeast um whatever
[36:39] else you put in bread and they have it
[36:42] there and they say well I going to make
[36:44] bread if you were to see
[36:46] that you should either warn them run
[36:49] away or be horrified because they're
[36:51] missing the main thing the main thing is
[36:54] flour right so in the absence of that
[36:57] you're not make bread you're saying
[36:58] you're making bread but what you're
[37:00] saying not really lining up with your
[37:02] actions and what you want to actually
[37:05] achieve and accomplish amen so we want
[37:07] to focus like that so we don't want to
[37:09] end up like like like like that scenario
[37:12] in which we are trying to say we doing
[37:14] something or trying to do some something
[37:17] and we miss the mark because we missed
[37:18] the main thing you know I I could recall
[37:22] when Jesus was in the temple speaking
[37:26] and Mary and Joseph went away for 3
[37:29] days and 3 days later they realize they
[37:33] left the main thing
[37:35] back they left him right where he was 3
[37:40] days before speaking to the the elders
[37:44] and and the Learned men and they had
[37:47] forgotten the main thing at that time
[37:49] and we don't want to be like that you
[37:52] know and in another context I want to
[37:54] ask you know if you had the opportunity
[37:56] to work to work
[37:58] hard you really had to to sacrifice time
[38:03] effort energy resources to work hard to
[38:06] attain say say pay some money you you
[38:10] you earned it through hard work and you
[38:13] saved it up to buy something that was of
[38:15] significance or meaningful to you how
[38:18] you think you'll approach the store when
[38:20] you're going to buy it you think you'll
[38:22] just go and just pick up one and walk
[38:24] out and say you know what I save for
[38:26] this and I'm go on you think the way
[38:27] you'll approach it no you think you'll
[38:31] be careful and you will watch it and
[38:32] you'll sit down and you'll Ponder and
[38:33] say you know I deserve this you know
[38:36] because I work hard for it and this is
[38:38] what I want I don't want that one with
[38:40] the scratch you know I want this one
[38:41] because it's seal and look perfect I
[38:44] want the one that looks like what I
[38:47] believe I save towards and what I work
[38:49] towards and that's the way that God is
[38:53] he wanted a bride to be perfect amen he
[38:57] wanted it so bad that he paid a price
[39:00] with his only begotten son so after
[39:04] paying this price which was significant
[39:06] his only son you think he want a halfway
[39:09] bride you think he want any old bride no
[39:13] you see you're looking for a particular
[39:16] type of
[39:17] bride not any kind of
[39:20] bride you know he wants this bride that
[39:23] he chose before the foundation of the
[39:25] world to be perfect to be just the way
[39:28] he expected and to do so what he did he
[39:32] gives some guidelines he gives some
[39:35] instructions he gives some requirements
[39:38] he gives some you know these attributes
[39:41] that he looking for you know if you
[39:43] don't know what you're looking for
[39:44] you'll never find it so he give these
[39:46] things and he say you know if you could
[39:49] match up to this this is what is
[39:51] perfection to me amen not what not
[39:54] anybody else says or your opinion or
[39:56] what you feel this is what he has
[39:59] outlined as as to what he's looking for
[40:02] amen so going through the scripture I
[40:06] went and I discovered and I know you
[40:08] know it it's nothing new it's nothing I
[40:10] created or invented but I was looking at
[40:13] if God wants a bride in this hour in
[40:16] this age in this evil age in the end
[40:18] time what he looking for and you know he
[40:23] left the attributes for us plain and
[40:25] simple that we could read you don't have
[40:27] to find it but in second Peter
[40:29] 1 vers 5-7 you know what he says he say
[40:33] add to your faith virtue and to Virtue
[40:36] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance
[40:39] and to Temperance patience and to
[40:41] patience godliness and to Godliness
[40:43] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[40:44] kindness charity so he really want those
[40:48] virtues to be in his bride Hallelujah he
[40:51] want those virtues to live in his bride
[40:54] because when he looks at that that's the
[40:56] image he's looking for that's the image
[40:59] he's coming for he's not coming for talk
[41:03] that's the main thing when all is said
[41:06] and done that is the main thing that you
[41:08] add that so if you're missing Hallelujah
[41:12] you're missing the faith The Virtue the
[41:14] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[41:17] broadly kind you're missing those things
[41:19] you're missing the main thing but listen
[41:22] he went further in 1 Corinthians
[41:25] 13 Hallelujah from verses 1 to 10 here's
[41:28] what he say he describ his bride in this
[41:30] way he said listen though his bride
[41:34] speak with the tongues of men and angels
[41:37] if you don't have
[41:39] charity you become a sounding brass or a
[41:42] tinkling symbol because you're missing
[41:45] the main thing that's it and though I
[41:48] have the gift of Prophecy and understand
[41:50] all Mysteries and all knowledge and
[41:52] though I have all Faith so that I could
[41:54] remove mountains and have not charity
[41:57] you're missing the main thing because
[41:59] you're
[42:00] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[42:03] to feel the poor and though I give my
[42:05] body to be Burns and have not charity it
[42:08] profiteth me nothing Hallelujah so after
[42:12] all that after you featured on on on
[42:15] wherever you're featured and everybody
[42:17] talk about you and they get the
[42:18] accolades and awards if you miss the
[42:21] main thing he still don't want
[42:25] that it goes on to say
[42:28] charity suffereth long and is kind amen
[42:31] amen so you can't be rude and
[42:34] rough he say Envy it not vaunt it not
[42:38] itself and is not puffed up so he's
[42:40] still looking for humility in this
[42:43] bride these are the attributes he laid
[42:46] out you know this is what he looking
[42:49] for he said rejoice it not in
[42:52] iniquity sorry in verse five do not
[42:56] behave it self unseemingly unseemly
[42:59] seeketh not her own is not easily
[43:02] provoked think it no evil rejoice it not
[43:06] in iniquity but rejoice it in the truth
[43:08] bear it all things believe it all things
[43:11] hope it all things endure it all things
[43:13] charity never faileth that's the main
[43:16] thing we talking about that's the main
[43:19] thing but whether there be prophecies
[43:21] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[43:23] they shall cease whether there be
[43:24] knowledge it shall vanish away for we
[43:26] know in part and we prophesy in part but
[43:29] when that which is perfect has come he's
[43:31] still looking for Perfection know not no
[43:33] halfway bride not what halfway Church
[43:36] Halfway Christian no he looking for
[43:38] Perfection that's the main thing but he
[43:41] say that which is perfect has come then
[43:43] that which is in part shall be done away
[43:45] amenallah so that's what he looking for
[43:48] he wants a Perfect Bride that could love
[43:50] him that's a bride who could be humble
[43:54] kind loving loving your neighbor loving
[43:57] your enemy loving the boss loving that
[44:00] employee that you know don't like you
[44:01] that's it he wants you to be wise not
[44:05] not foolish obedient to his word am
[44:08] caring am trusting him and his word
[44:11] having faith to believe that he who made
[44:14] the promise is able to complete it by
[44:17] himself with or without you he don't
[44:20] need your help or support that's the
[44:22] kind of bride he looking for that's the
[44:24] main thing that's it he wants that you
[44:26] stay with the word
[44:28] hallelujah not run off and do your own
[44:30] thing he want you to stick with the word
[44:33] because he said listen prophecies will
[44:38] fail knowledge will vanish away but his
[44:41] word cannot fail it will never fail it's
[44:45] the same yesterday today and
[44:48] forever hallu thank you
[44:55] Lord like I said Jesus is coming for a
[44:58] Perfect Bride so what he did he dropped
[45:00] some time right so he give the bride the
[45:03] ability to to add these things because
[45:06] he want the bride to get ready you know
[45:09] in in Noah's day you could have do what
[45:12] you want but you see when the time came
[45:15] it was only one thing was important you
[45:17] know if you're in the ark if you was out
[45:20] the ark it didn't matter how long you
[45:22] went to church how much books you read
[45:24] or if Noah was your cousin it didn't
[45:26] matter
[45:27] the main thing was you had to be in the
[45:30] ark to be
[45:32] saved Amen in Moses day it didn't matter
[45:37] if Moses was your longtime distant
[45:39] cousin because when he was in Egypt you
[45:40] did a favor for him it didn't matter
[45:43] what he wanted is that he wanted
[45:44] something on the
[45:46] doorpost when I see that blood I will
[45:49] pass it didn't have favors and because
[45:52] it's you and be real good and it's long
[45:54] time no it didn't matter as matter of
[45:57] fact he say when judgment come you want
[45:59] to start from the ancient men come come
[46:02] down no respect to persons it didn't
[46:05] matter how how long you're there how
[46:08] long how how much you help and how much
[46:10] you contribute and how much you give of
[46:12] yourself it didn't matter because when
[46:14] we check the attributes there if you
[46:16] don't have love and love for his word
[46:19] hallelujah this is not mandated and and
[46:23] he will beat you to do this no because
[46:26] you love him and because you respect him
[46:28] then you're obedient to his word so you
[46:32] will honor him and you will do the
[46:34] things that is pleasing to him and the
[46:36] things that he want done amen it that's
[46:40] the main thing that's it so it's no
[46:42] longer about you but it's about him
[46:45] that's it that's what he's coming for
[46:47] you know
[46:48] hallelujah what he want is he want his
[46:51] Spirit to dwell in you so when he look
[46:53] at you he could say there is my spirit
[46:56] flowing freely yes when he look at you
[46:58] you leaking Faith virtue leaking out it
[47:03] it it it running over yes all them
[47:06] virtues that you love just because you
[47:09] don't even know why where where the
[47:12] world feel that you should hate and you
[47:14] should condemn you just love because
[47:18] that's not you know that's Christ in
[47:21] you that's the word being in the bride
[47:25] and when the word is in the bride you
[47:27] have no choice it's innate there's a
[47:29] word in English called innate it mean
[47:31] building it's not putting on a Sprinkle
[47:34] a little bit and you get a little bit
[47:36] and you know what you have patience
[47:37] today no it's in you so it's the only
[47:41] thing that could come out of you amen
[47:44] that's how he wants us he wants his word
[47:47] to be in us so when we walk you could
[47:51] see Jesus amen when you open the Bible
[47:54] every chapter every verse every line you
[47:56] see see Jesus when you speak you speak
[48:00] Jesus when you you you you have
[48:02] interaction with somebody else they know
[48:05] listen this is not you there's Christ in
[48:09] you that's what they see it's no longer
[48:13] about you so you can't take glory in
[48:15] that so you reflect him amen that's what
[48:20] he looking for he want the word to live
[48:22] in you he want to dwell in you thank you
[48:26] thank you Lord now from from a message a
[48:30] paradox paragraph
[48:33] 168 where Bram said now Pentecost was a
[48:37] paradox all right how that God chose a
[48:40] bunch of illiterate fishermen that
[48:43] didn't even know their
[48:46] ABCs there is soul that Peter couldn't
[48:48] even sign his own name huah the Bible
[48:52] said he and John in Acts for was
[48:54] ignorant and unlearned but yet yet they
[48:57] take notice you know what they took
[48:59] notice of that they've been with
[49:03] Jesus so once again that that eliminates
[49:06] intellect it it eliminates your Academia
[49:10] and and your
[49:11] qualifications and and how worthy you
[49:13] are and how long you wrong and you study
[49:16] the Scripture it eliminates all that
[49:19] because yes when you've been with Jesus
[49:23] you know what say he say that's the main
[49:26] thing
[49:27] that is the main
[49:33] thing in a message leadership paragraph
[49:36] 36 and I want to stay here a little bit
[49:38] all right you you know what before I go
[49:40] there all right let let me read the rest
[49:42] of that scripture all right I stopped at
[49:45] at verse 22 so I just want to go on from
[49:48] verse 23 to 30 amen so that's Matthew 19
[49:53] verse
[49:54] 23-30 and it said then said Jesus unto
[49:58] his disciples now this is after he spoke
[50:01] to the Rich Young Ruler and he went away
[50:02] very sorrowful amen because he had great
[50:06] possessions right in verse 23 then said
[50:08] Jesus unto his disciples verily I say
[50:11] unto you yes that a rich man shall
[50:13] hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven
[50:16] all right and again I say unto you it is
[50:19] easier for a camel to go through the eye
[50:21] of a needle and for a rich man to enter
[50:23] into the kingdom of heaven so you're
[50:25] making sure you understand the point yes
[50:27] in verse 25 he says when his disciples
[50:30] heard it they were exceedingly amazed
[50:33] saying who then can be saved because if
[50:37] the Rich Young Ruler who was here before
[50:40] who who obey all the Commandments and he
[50:43] is not rich because because he wants to
[50:46] be rich he he is Rich because he has
[50:48] followed everything that he's supposed
[50:50] to do and the world will call him a
[50:51] successful guy right so when you tell us
[50:55] that it's hard difficult for a rich man
[50:58] to enter the Kingdom of Heaven who then
[51:00] can be saved and
[51:03] and in verse 26 Jesus beheld them and
[51:06] said unto them with men this is
[51:10] impossible but With God all things are
[51:12] possible then answered Peter and said
[51:15] unto him behold this our testimony now
[51:19] we have forsaken all and followed thee
[51:23] what shall we have therefore
[51:27] and Jesus said unto them verily I say
[51:29] unto you that ye which have followed me
[51:31] in the Regeneration when the son of man
[51:34] shall sit in the Throne of his glory ye
[51:36] also shall sit upon 12 Thrones judging
[51:38] the 12 tribes of Israel and then he gave
[51:41] the answer that the Rich Young Ruler had
[51:43] asked him initially by this time he was
[51:45] gone but he was given the disciples the
[51:47] answer in verse 29 and everyone that had
[51:50] forsaken houses or Brethren or sisters
[51:54] or father or mother or wife or children
[51:57] or lands for my name's sake my name sake
[52:00] shall receive and H hundredfold and
[52:03] shall inherit everlasting
[52:06] life but many that are first shall be
[52:10] last and last shall be first amen
[52:12] hallelujah now it's very clear that the
[52:15] Rich Young Ruler came and asked what do
[52:18] I need to do yes to inherit eternal life
[52:23] what has to
[52:24] happen what what are not doing what are
[52:26] doing wrong because when I check
[52:29] checklist I take off everything that a
[52:30] Believer supposed to
[52:33] do and in a message leadership paragraph
[52:36] 36 Hallelujah the prophet said because
[52:42] remember you're going to you're going to
[52:45] die someday and either be translated
[52:48] into heaven and if you die before his
[52:50] coming you'll be raptured first did did
[52:53] you know know that did you know those
[52:55] who are dead if Mama and Papa dies
[52:57] before you and Jesus doesn't come in our
[53:00] generation do you know these Mama Papa
[53:02] and Mama will come forth first glorified
[53:05] before you see the trumpet of God shall
[53:08] sound and the dead in Christ shall rise
[53:10] first then we which are alive and remain
[53:13] shall be caught up with them we'll be
[53:15] changed like that we've got to remember
[53:18] that's the main thing in life he said
[53:21] you understand now that's the main thing
[53:23] in life we got to do is to get ready to
[53:26] meet God Amen so after all is said and
[53:29] done after all the scriptures after all
[53:32] the sermons the messages and you share a
[53:35] thought the main thing is you have to
[53:38] get ready to meet God
[53:41] Amen now it continues Hallelujah in
[53:45] paragraph 37 and he says now just
[53:47] religion won't work see the young this
[53:52] one Young Ruler here said good Master
[53:54] now remember before I say it
[53:57] he had been taught to walk right so this
[54:00] is not a hooligan this is not somebody
[54:02] who pretending to be good yeah this is
[54:06] not somebody pretending to be a success
[54:09] he had been taught to work right he had
[54:11] a good education he had been taught
[54:14] business he was rich he was a ruler and
[54:17] had religion but he was confronted with
[54:19] another problem and it confronts all of
[54:22] us all of us eternal life
[54:26] Hallelujah because we know the main
[54:29] thing is you have to get ready to meet
[54:32] God Amen am so this is the issue he had
[54:36] religion doesn't give us eternal life
[54:39] coming to church don't give you Eternal
[54:41] Life Fellowship don't give you eternal
[54:44] life singing on a morning to give you
[54:46] eternal
[54:49] life religious is a covering but it
[54:52] don't give us eternal life and yet
[54:57] him taught with the best teachers there
[55:00] was he was yet lacking something and the
[55:04] young man knew it because he said good
[55:05] Master what can I do to inherit eternal
[55:09] life
[55:11] now you you believe Jesus as God don't
[55:15] you so he knew the thoughts of the young
[55:18] man so Jesus knew what he was thinking
[55:21] Jesus could have addressed him
[55:22] immediately he knew his thoughts
[55:25] Hallelujah
[55:28] but he said keep the Commandments he
[55:30] went right back to his religion to see
[55:33] what he would say about his religion all
[55:35] right he said now in other words keep
[55:37] your religion yes he said I have did
[55:41] this since a boy little boys like you my
[55:44] mama and papa my priests taught me
[55:46] religion but I know in my religion that
[55:50] I still don't have eternal life see you
[55:53] can be good don't steal don't smoke
[55:56] don't don't lie don't lie to Papa and
[55:58] Mama don't tell the first lie because
[56:01] when you tell the first lie it's easy to
[56:03] tell another one see but you mustn't do
[56:06] it don't tell the first
[56:08] one Prophet said in paragraph 41 did you
[56:12] know your body is not made to lie we're
[56:15] not created to lie chemically
[56:18] scientifically we were not created to
[56:21] lie he said why because
[56:26] lie is such a horrible thing the body
[56:28] wasn't made to lie it's such a horrible
[56:31] thing till it upsets the whole nerve
[56:33] system when you
[56:35] lie upsets like that will give you
[56:39] ulcers fungus growth it'll kill you and
[56:43] then a li is a Bad Thing C see you're
[56:46] not supposed to lie to steal to do any
[56:48] of these things
[56:51] so this young man had probably been he
[56:55] hadn't lied died he never stole he was
[56:59] conscious that he needed ever eternal
[57:02] life that's what he needed he was aware
[57:04] of that so he said what can I do to have
[57:07] it and Jesus is showing here that
[57:10] religion won't do it so being present on
[57:14] a Sunday and a Wednesday and in Zoom
[57:17] prayer meeting on a Friday is not good
[57:19] enough amen that won't do it you know
[57:22] you have to be able to focus on the main
[57:25] thing yes and know the main thing and
[57:28] what is important to you and to God Amen
[57:31] Hallelujah so he knew he didn't have
[57:33] eternal life so he said if you would
[57:35] enter into life eternal life want to be
[57:39] perfect then if you want that you need
[57:41] to go sell all you
[57:44] have see now it's all right to have
[57:47] money see it's all right to be rich to
[57:52] be a ruler all those things are right
[57:54] yes the challenge with him wasn't
[57:56] because he had money you know wasn't
[57:58] because he was a young fell wasn't
[58:01] because he was a ruler but he had
[58:03] another
[58:04] challenge and the prophet here he said
[58:07] that's all right but it's the way you
[58:10] act after you become that see so when he
[58:14] said go sell what you've got and give it
[58:16] to the poor them people that hasn't got
[58:19] anything then come follow me and you
[58:22] will have Treasures in Heaven but the
[58:25] young man had so much money till he
[58:27] didn't know what to do with it now he
[58:30] was very popular that young man he was
[58:32] very well equipped for life the way his
[58:35] father and mother and the priest and all
[58:37] of them had equipped him but he still
[58:39] know he lacked something now I'm talking
[58:41] to the
[58:43] adults he know he lacked something and
[58:46] he didn't have eternal life he knew it
[58:48] religion wouldn't produce itlu form
[58:51] sensation you feel some something you
[58:53] get scared you feel something crying GL
[58:57] that still ain't it all right you're
[58:59] confronted with eternal life so now we
[59:02] digging a little deeper into what this
[59:04] main thing is right we don't just want
[59:06] to live and operate and have religion
[59:08] and go to church and say we believe and
[59:10] we trying to be good but we need to seek
[59:14] out those things that we lack the things
[59:16] we need amen don't worry I I wouldn't be
[59:23] long so in a message Harvest time yes
[59:27] still speaking of the main thing
[59:29] paragraph 108 he said now notice God in
[59:32] the beginning we're going to back to the
[59:34] word the very first thing he gave his
[59:37] children to live by was his
[59:39] word now we find that is the truth amen
[59:43] then in the middle of the Bible we hear
[59:44] Jesus come and say man shall live by
[59:48] every word that proceeds out of the
[59:51] mouth of God Amen and then in revelation
[59:54] 22 Jesus himself speaking again said I
[59:57] testify of these things if any man shall
[1:00:00] add one word to this or take one word
[1:00:02] out this book word of this book out his
[1:00:06] part will be taken from the book of life
[1:00:08] now see it's not our good living that's
[1:00:12] just something that goes with it it
[1:00:14] isn't our church loyalty that goes with
[1:00:17] it but the main thing is staying with
[1:00:20] that word don't eat nothing else but
[1:00:24] that word stay with it
[1:00:26] he is that word that's what you want you
[1:00:30] want to stay with that word that's the
[1:00:32] main thing because the word is what's
[1:00:34] going to prepare you to meet God the
[1:00:37] word is what's going to clothe you with
[1:00:40] that wedding garment the word will give
[1:00:43] you the guidelines and the
[1:00:45] instructions in order to fulfill that
[1:00:47] role as bride because he paid a price
[1:00:51] not just for for any old shabby thing he
[1:00:54] want a perfect Brad who could handle his
[1:00:57] word and could slice and cut and stay
[1:01:00] with it and say this is the main thing
[1:01:02] and I staying with this and I have faith
[1:01:04] and I believe this word and I trust this
[1:01:06] word and I stay in with this word amen
[1:01:09] that's what he
[1:01:11] wants that's the main thing that's it in
[1:01:14] the message of Absolut and absolute yes
[1:01:17] paragraph 19 he say it's nothing nothing
[1:01:20] so mysterious he say it's finding God
[1:01:23] right earlier on we say Peter and they
[1:01:28] their testimony that was that they've
[1:01:30] been with Jesus in this case you say
[1:01:32] it's finding God to getting yourself out
[1:01:36] the way and letting the Holy Spirit use
[1:01:39] you to do whatever he wants to do that's
[1:01:42] it he said that's the main thing of any
[1:01:44] gift is getting your own ideas away and
[1:01:48] let Christ be in charge he must have
[1:01:51] control he say then what what he said if
[1:01:55] you want to know whether it's Christ or
[1:01:58] not if it's just a sensation leave it
[1:02:00] alone but if it's just an emotion leave
[1:02:03] it alone but if it's written in the word
[1:02:06] then it's godu if you could find it in
[1:02:08] the word then it's God he say always
[1:02:11] judge everything it doesn't matter who
[1:02:14] presents it judge everything by
[1:02:16] presenting the word test drop the word
[1:02:19] test on it and see if it could pass that
[1:02:22] if it can't pass the word test it fail
[1:02:24] am it fall it it it's of no use we want
[1:02:28] to stick with the main thing and the
[1:02:30] main thing is it must match the word the
[1:02:33] main thing is you have to stay with the
[1:02:35] word the main thing is it must line up
[1:02:37] with the word line upon line it must be
[1:02:40] found there Hallelujah you say if you
[1:02:43] don't do do do that you're lost you know
[1:02:45] if you don't do that you're
[1:02:51] lost thank you Lord hallelujah in a
[1:02:55] message
[1:02:57] token paragraph
[1:03:04] 131 he says and I tell you today
[1:03:08] brother it ain't how you comb your hair
[1:03:12] or what you do hallelujah or what kind
[1:03:14] of clothes you wear what kind of PhD you
[1:03:17] got I if I hear that God is among you
[1:03:21] that's the main
[1:03:22] thing that's the kind of church you want
[1:03:25] to be in
[1:03:26] a church with God walking moving yeah it
[1:03:30] doesn't matter how how intelligent you
[1:03:33] believe you are how much degrees you
[1:03:35] think you have hallelujah how much suits
[1:03:37] your we if it's a three piece or a two
[1:03:38] piece or no none at all at the end of
[1:03:41] the day he say the main thing is that
[1:03:44] God is among
[1:03:45] you whether you have a suit or a tie or
[1:03:48] not God have to be among you he has to
[1:03:51] dwell among you amen amen he said want
[1:03:56] to know where God is among this look at
[1:03:59] the organizations Hallelujah today I
[1:04:01] said look at the churches look at groups
[1:04:04] where are they going to is God among
[1:04:07] them is if not they being led straight
[1:04:10] to the Council of churches straight on a
[1:04:14] straight pathu it doesn't matter who the
[1:04:16] pastor ISJ if God is not among them they
[1:04:19] have a
[1:04:24] problem that lead straight back to the
[1:04:26] mark of the beast God is not in that God
[1:04:29] is in his word for he is the word that's
[1:04:34] exactly I have heard the faith listen
[1:04:37] Faith cometh not by hearing the counsel
[1:04:40] or the opinions of men you know Faith
[1:04:43] don't come by listening to some some
[1:04:45] nice motivational speech you know Faith
[1:04:48] come by his word amen and his word
[1:04:51] creates Faith amen hearing the word this
[1:04:55] seen this and they knowed she knew it
[1:04:58] was the truth she asked for Mercy going
[1:05:01] back to to to to Joshua and they there
[1:05:03] she say she asks for Mercy watch for
[1:05:06] both her and her family she asks for her
[1:05:09] and her family just like they did in
[1:05:11] Egypt notice there was given to her a
[1:05:14] token a red token that a Scarlet string
[1:05:17] she let the people despised down out of
[1:05:19] the window and that string was to be a
[1:05:22] token in her time that was the thing
[1:05:26] that's the thing she needed to have God
[1:05:29] would not destroy an angel would not
[1:05:32] come near her as long as she had the
[1:05:36] token but what if she say oh I let them
[1:05:39] down I done a good
[1:05:41] deed so now to keep anybody from
[1:05:44] criticizing me seeing the Scarlet rope
[1:05:47] hanging out here I'll pull the Rope back
[1:05:50] what what what if she was like that
[1:05:53] Hallelujah the judge the Judgment Angel
[1:05:57] would have never passed over her house
[1:05:59] Hallelujah she had to have the token
[1:06:02] displayed it had to remain there so you
[1:06:06] tell me in this
[1:06:09] age how does that line up when we look
[1:06:11] at the word is there a token for this
[1:06:13] age that we need to have if we don't
[1:06:16] have the token on display yes what the
[1:06:20] Judgment Angel have to do they can't
[1:06:22] Passover because listen here rules
[1:06:26] Hallelujah is not dependent on you it's
[1:06:29] not dependent on me it's not dependent
[1:06:31] on History it's one thing they looking
[1:06:34] for they're looking for the token that's
[1:06:36] the main thing that's it the main thing
[1:06:38] is you show the token so you show the
[1:06:42] ticket you show the pass so you can
[1:06:45] pass outside of that you get lick up
[1:06:49] outside of that there's no hope outside
[1:06:53] of that you're lost outside that you
[1:06:56] fail if you don't have the token on
[1:06:59] display which is the main thing in this
[1:07:01] hour you have
[1:07:03] nothing you could give to the poor you
[1:07:06] could sing in the choir you could have a
[1:07:09] Poe and contribute in whatever way you
[1:07:12] believe if you don't have what a
[1:07:14] destroying Angel looking for that is the
[1:07:19] token that's the main thing that's it he
[1:07:21] have no choice but to execute judgment
[1:07:25] because that's the instruction to look
[1:07:28] for the main thing he not coming to see
[1:07:30] the the color the clothes you wear he
[1:07:33] not I'm going see the style your
[1:07:36] here he coming for the token that's the
[1:07:40] identifier that's the mark you looking
[1:07:42] for that's the main thing and if you
[1:07:45] have that then you could Rejoice tonight
[1:07:48] then you could shout then you could be
[1:07:50] in Revival because you know you're
[1:07:52] striving for for for for perfection
[1:07:55] because you're striving to ensure that
[1:07:57] you have the main
[1:07:58] [Applause]
[1:08:00] thing
[1:08:02] it
[1:08:04] wonderful
[1:08:06] hallelujah amen thank you
[1:08:09] Jesus
[1:08:11] Hallelujah we winding down you
[1:08:14] know we're winding down because at the
[1:08:18] end of the
[1:08:19] day I think it's
[1:08:22] clear God's word hallelujah
[1:08:25] is so simple yes that you don't need a
[1:08:28] master's or a
[1:08:30] doctorate you don't need you know some
[1:08:33] great Theologian to come to explain
[1:08:37] Hallelujah he said listen this is what
[1:08:40] I'm looking for right I am willing to
[1:08:43] pay I'm willing to sacrifice I'm willing
[1:08:45] to give the best that I have because I
[1:08:50] value this bride so much Hallelujah that
[1:08:54] I am willing yes to send my only
[1:08:57] son sacrifice him born of a virgin to be
[1:09:02] tested and tried on this Earth just like
[1:09:05] you and I listen because he realized at
[1:09:09] the end of the day the bride he looking
[1:09:11] for is special he don't want any old
[1:09:14] bride he want a bride that can not be
[1:09:16] deceived amen a bride that will put on
[1:09:19] the full armor a bride that could
[1:09:22] represent and reflect him a bride that
[1:09:25] could be Jesus Christ on two feet
[1:09:28] Hallelujah a bride where the virtues
[1:09:30] could be running through and leaking out
[1:09:33] because they love him so much that they
[1:09:37] trust his word and apply it to their
[1:09:40] life that's what he looking for right he
[1:09:43] don't trust anybody with his
[1:09:46] bride so he set the
[1:09:48] guidelines it's not man determining this
[1:09:52] he said this is what I want I want you
[1:09:54] to love me I want you to serve me I want
[1:09:56] you to worship me I want you to pray I
[1:09:59] want communion with you I want
[1:10:01] fellowship with you listen I want you to
[1:10:03] love your brother and your neighbor cuz
[1:10:05] when you do that you do it unto me I
[1:10:07] want you to work when you work you work
[1:10:10] unto me I want you to have the right
[1:10:12] attitude because the right attitude
[1:10:15] towards any Divine promise of God will
[1:10:17] bring it to pass he leave promises that
[1:10:20] are very specific very specifically
[1:10:23] geared to his bride and he said listen
[1:10:25] all you have to do is do do do these
[1:10:27] things you know follow these steps just
[1:10:31] add to your faith virtue and to Virtue
[1:10:34] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[1:10:36] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[1:10:38] kindness add charity so he gave a
[1:10:41] guideline and you say listen this is the
[1:10:43] main thing so when I come essentially
[1:10:46] imagine as a father you walk out your
[1:10:49] house and just before you leave you say
[1:10:50] son here what I want when I reach back
[1:10:53] here I want you to clean up your bedroom
[1:10:55] all right all
[1:10:56] right and you walk out and leave now you
[1:11:00] know what the instructions are the
[1:11:03] instructions are clean up your bedroom
[1:11:06] so
[1:11:07] imagine you as the son hearing the
[1:11:10] instruction and you know what you decide
[1:11:13] I go in and do a painting for daddy boy
[1:11:15] I go and paint a picture of
[1:11:17] Daddy and I decide here are going and
[1:11:20] and craft some mural or something for
[1:11:23] daddy cuz I love daddyy so much
[1:11:25] and you know what else are going and do
[1:11:28] I feel I going to make a sand castle in
[1:11:30] the house for Daddy because daddy like
[1:11:33] to go to the beach no no no no no so
[1:11:35] here's what happens in that scenario
[1:11:38] when the father
[1:11:39] returns he sanca look nice the mural
[1:11:43] look nice the painting look nice but
[1:11:45] what's the main thing the main thing is
[1:11:48] he give an instruction that that room
[1:11:50] must be clean yes so if he come on the
[1:11:53] room dirty and God forbid they get
[1:11:59] licks there's a consequence for not
[1:12:03] being able to present the main thingu
[1:12:06] because his instructions were very very
[1:12:08] clear it wasn't complicated and listen
[1:12:11] it was listen God is not in the Treasure
[1:12:14] Island he is not in the I forget long
[1:12:16] time they used to have a thing where you
[1:12:18] get a clue here and you go here and you
[1:12:20] get a clue there and you run down so and
[1:12:21] you find the next clue God is nothing in
[1:12:23] that God is God in Simplicity he gave
[1:12:27] clearly defined instructions that even
[1:12:30] the uneducated and illiterate could
[1:12:33] understand these fishermen that couldn't
[1:12:35] sign the name was able to understand he
[1:12:39] said in that time T in
[1:12:43] Jerusalem wait in Jerusalem just wait
[1:12:48] until you be indued with power from on
[1:12:50] high so his instruction is always simple
[1:12:54] he didn't say listen I want you to go
[1:12:55] down there and make a left and count 10
[1:12:57] steps and walk backwards flip on your
[1:12:58] head no no no no no he said very
[1:13:01] specific Noah here what I want you do
[1:13:03] build an ark and you building your own
[1:13:05] Ark I giv you the guidelines I giv you
[1:13:08] the instructions he said Moses here here
[1:13:11] what I want you to go to Egypt but don't
[1:13:14] just go because at the end of the day
[1:13:17] God want the
[1:13:18] glory so he don't want you just go he
[1:13:21] say this is how I want you to go I want
[1:13:23] you go and you be me all right and Aeron
[1:13:26] will be you all right I want you to go
[1:13:29] and don't want you just set them free
[1:13:31] and say Let Let My People Go I want you
[1:13:33] to bring them from there to a mountain
[1:13:35] to worship on the next side very clear
[1:13:38] instructions in Joshua time he say
[1:13:40] listen I want you to walk around once
[1:13:42] every day Hallelujah and on the seven
[1:13:44] day seven times in Gideon case he said
[1:13:47] listen every man that lap in the water
[1:13:50] like that only choose them leave
[1:13:54] everybody else alone
[1:13:55] and when you go these are the
[1:13:57] instructions you have a picture you have
[1:13:59] a lamp you break the picture very very
[1:14:03] specific so he don't want to he don't
[1:14:05] want you to mess it up you knowall I I
[1:14:07] remember one time my brother he he he
[1:14:10] showed me a concept and he he he taught
[1:14:12] me a concept he said he learned that a
[1:14:14] guy said listen when you want to make
[1:14:17] sure your business works well like a
[1:14:18] well oil M machine you need to make
[1:14:21] things stupid proof
[1:14:25] when you don't want mistakes and you
[1:14:28] want quality and you want the same
[1:14:31] result every time you need to make sure
[1:14:33] it's not open to random
[1:14:37] interpretations so in doing so God real
[1:14:40] careful with his bride he don't want
[1:14:42] anybody manhandle his bride so he give
[1:14:46] very specific instructions that every
[1:14:49] individual could understand because he
[1:14:51] said listen at the end of the day I
[1:14:53] coming for the token are coming for the
[1:14:56] main thing and I want you to know in
[1:14:58] advance not everybody will
[1:15:01] listen so he say one will be taken and
[1:15:04] the other will be left because he gives
[1:15:09] Specific Instructions and not everybody
[1:15:11] could be humble enough to be obedient
[1:15:14] enough to be able to apply that
[1:15:18] instruction to their
[1:15:20] life as we close there's a message of
[1:15:23] testimony upon the sea
[1:15:26] paragraph

[1:15:32] you get in a mess that's what's the
[1:15:35] matter with people today they don't like
