[30:08] allah be done and said in jesus name we
[30:10] ask it
[30:11] amen god bless you and welcome
[30:13] and we want to go straight to the word
[30:14] of god if it were bibles i'd like you to
[30:16] turn to first corinthians chapter 9
[30:20] we want to read from verse 24 to 27.
[30:23] we want to go also to philippians
[30:25] chapter 2 reading from verse 3 to 8.
[30:28] and luke 15 verse 11 to 13
[30:31] this morning
[30:33] good to see all of you all tonight today
[30:36] it's good to be here
[30:40] so
[30:41] first coming just 9 24. know you not
[30:44] that they which run in a race run all
[30:47] but one receiver the prize
[30:49] so run
[30:51] that you may obtain
[30:53] and every man that's traveling for the
[30:54] mastery is temperate in all things
[30:57] now they do it to obtain a corruptable
[31:01] crown but we are incorruptable
[31:04] i
[31:05] therefore
[31:06] so run
[31:08] not as uncertainly
[31:10] sulfite eye not as one that beats the
[31:12] ear
[31:13] but i keep under my body
[31:16] and bring it into subjection least that
[31:19] by any means
[31:21] when i have preached to others i myself
[31:23] should be a cast away
[31:27] and philippians chapter 2 reading for
[31:29] verse 3
[31:30] let nothing be done through strife
[31:33] or vainglory
[31:35] but in lowliness of mind let each esteem
[31:37] other better than themselves
[31:39] look not every man and his own things
[31:41] but every man also on the things of
[31:43] others
[31:44] let this mind be new which was also in
[31:47] christ jesus who
[31:49] been in the form of god taught enough
[31:51] robbery to be equal with god
[31:53] but made himself of no reputation
[31:56] took upon him the form of a servant and
[31:58] was made in the likeness of sinful men
[32:01] like baptists of men and being found in
[32:04] fashion as a man he humbled himself
[32:07] and became obedient unto death even the
[32:09] death
[32:10] of the cross
[32:12] and all our
[32:13] is from luke chapter 15 you want to read
[32:15] from verse 11
[32:18] to 13.
[32:20] and he said a certain manner two sons
[32:22] the younger of them said unto his father
[32:24] father give me the portion
[32:26] of goods that followed to me and he
[32:29] divided into them his living
[32:31] and not many days after the younger son
[32:33] gathered all together and took his
[32:35] journey
[32:36] into a far country
[32:38] and there
[32:39] [Music]
[32:40] wasted his substance with god this
[32:42] living let's pray one more time father
[32:44] we thank you we have read your
[32:45] scriptures lord and
[32:47] it's strange texts and what to be said
[32:49] this morning and what i believe you want
[32:51] me to share with your people may you
[32:53] bless it and interpret it to their
[32:54] hearts and lives that no one would leave
[32:56] you the same way they came
[32:58] bless those that are connected live and
[33:00] those that would hear the message
[33:01] afterwards and jesus might ask it amen
[33:03] amen god bless you may have your seats
[33:05] oh praise god
[33:07] i have a title this morning
[33:10] so run that you may obtain
[33:13] so run
[33:15] that you may obtain
[33:17] so it's not what you do but it's how
[33:21] and i didn't want to put it as an
[33:23] inspiration
[33:24] but the underlying thought behind this
[33:27] is
[33:28] fighting the spirit of entitlement and
[33:31] complacency
[33:33] it's very odd but
[33:35] this is what we have to share
[33:37] this morning fighting the spirit
[33:39] of entitlement and complacency
[33:42] habakkuk said i will stand up on my
[33:44] watch and set me up on the tower and
[33:46] will watch to see what he will see unto
[33:48] me and what i shall answer when i'm
[33:50] reproved amen and the lord answered and
[33:53] said write the vision
[33:55] make it plain
[33:56] upon tables
[33:57] that he
[33:58] may run that reason it not walk
[34:02] stop walking it's not a run
[34:04] but a run you have to get to see the
[34:05] vision plane
[34:06] and you would understand why you can't
[34:08] walk you have to run
[34:10] why you have to be enthused about all
[34:11] these promises
[34:13] and why if you get entitled and
[34:15] complacent you it wouldn't do any good
[34:17] you'll be messed up
[34:18] oh is the name of the lord
[34:20] so the bible says for the vision is yet
[34:22] for an appointed time
[34:24] so that is why you have to run with
[34:25] patience the race that is set before
[34:28] you can't be frustrated and fed up they
[34:30] can't take it no more you have to
[34:32] understand is a race it's not a sprint
[34:35] because there is nothing swift it's not
[34:37] a sprint
[34:38] it's a race a long race
[34:41] a long distance have mountains and
[34:42] valleys and things to climb
[34:44] but it's a race that we must win
[34:47] and we have to run it a certain way
[34:49] oh glory to god you don't want to be in
[34:52] it to be also ran
[34:54] you have no price for also run you have
[34:56] to run to obtain
[34:58] you have to run to get to the mark and
[35:00] to the goal and that's why paul said i
[35:03] forget the things of the past i press
[35:05] towards the mark of the high calling
[35:07] so you have to have ambition
[35:09] you have to have aim
[35:11] you have to have some kind of desire to
[35:12] take you above where you are
[35:14] and further than where you are
[35:17] if you're satisfied with where you are
[35:18] you are messed up
[35:20] because you have to have a fight inside
[35:22] of you
[35:23] because you're wrestling against flesh
[35:24] and blood the devil is not under
[35:26] quarantine let me say that the devil is
[35:29] not under quarantine he's alive and well
[35:31] and doing this must mischief as he has
[35:33] always done
[35:35] oh glory to god and if he's not another
[35:37] current senior that could be in our
[35:38] spirit under quarantine we may wear a
[35:41] mask and take social distance but in our
[35:43] spirit we are shoulders of the cross
[35:46] oh glory to god we intend to run this
[35:48] race to win
[35:50] not to also run
[35:52] or give the lord a shout
[35:54] we need to aim high
[35:56] we need to climb higher because we were
[35:59] born for the skies as eagles
[36:01] do you believe that this morning
[36:03] but abandoned amen relax he said the
[36:06] very name ephesus was a strange kampung
[36:08] meaning aim at and relaxed
[36:10] the high aspiration of this age that had
[36:13] begun with the fullness of the spirit
[36:15] the depth of god whereby they were
[36:17] aiming at the high calling of god begin
[36:20] to give way to a less
[36:22] watchful attitude
[36:24] a less addend following of jesus christ
[36:26] began to manifest itself as an omen that
[36:29] in the future ages the physical vehicle
[36:31] called the church would sink into the
[36:34] awfulness of the depth of satan it had
[36:37] begun relaxed and was drifting already
[36:40] the age was backsliding it has left his
[36:43] first love
[36:44] when the bible said on the last day the
[36:45] love of many gonna watch school
[36:48] the prophet said only among the elect
[36:50] will have love
[36:52] the love of many gonna wax call because
[36:53] of inequity
[36:55] iniquity is knowing to do right and
[36:56] doing wrong
[36:58] you know better than that oh he said i
[37:00] rather you're hot or you're cold if
[37:02] you're cold you know you're dead if
[37:03] you're hot you're on fire but because
[37:06] you look warm oh glory to god complacent
[37:10] entitled people
[37:12] entitled believers
[37:14] entitled church members
[37:16] see that god owe them something
[37:18] and they deserve better and they deserve
[37:20] more oh my lord
[37:24] complacency
[37:25] meaning self-satisfaction
[37:28] especially when accompanied by
[37:30] unawareness of actual dangers or
[37:32] deficiencies
[37:36] danger
[37:38] unaware
[37:40] walking about like you're foolish and
[37:42] simple
[37:44] instead of being wise
[37:46] the foolish versions they wasn't
[37:48] studying about the extra oil
[37:50] they had enough to have their lamp lit
[37:54] for a while
[37:56] but the energy
[37:57] and the backup to have extra oil they
[38:00] failed deal
[38:02] they didn't have the wisdom of
[38:04] revelation
[38:05] to get the extra oil
[38:07] you are not here to enter the wreath
[38:09] you are not here to be also ran you here
[38:12] to win
[38:13] you here to run with a goal and a
[38:15] purpose
[38:16] paul said it perfectly
[38:19] oh hallelujah
[38:22] complacency a feeling of smug
[38:26] or on critical satisfaction with oneself
[38:30] or one's achievements
[38:32] let me read it again
[38:34] a feeling of smug
[38:36] uh a critical satisfaction with oneself
[38:40] or one's achievement
[38:42] no
[38:42] an entitlement
[38:44] is a right to a particular privilege or
[38:47] benefit
[38:49] if someone has a sense of entitlement
[38:52] that means the person believes he
[38:54] deserves
[38:56] certain privileges
[38:59] and whatever you feel you're entitled to
[39:02] question who's supposed to pay for that
[39:07] yeah
[39:08] yeah you know they talk about vaccine
[39:11] and the vaccine will give not free but
[39:13] you know what the vaccine is not free
[39:14] you know
[39:15] somebody paying faith you know if the
[39:17] government pay for it give any people
[39:19] free but somebody paid they call the
[39:20] pharmaceutical companies not doing it
[39:22] for free
[39:24] they're doing for a whole lot of money
[39:26] so what we take as for granted as what
[39:29] we're tied to
[39:30] somebody paying for it
[39:32] so let's talk about that political son
[39:35] oh give the lord a shout let's let's
[39:36] talk about this this young man
[39:39] oh give the lord a shout could we be
[39:41] present this morning let's talk about
[39:42] this young man
[39:46] who felt he was so entitled that he had
[39:49] the right not to wait but to go to his
[39:51] father and say father
[39:52] you see what you have for me
[39:54] i wanted to now
[39:59] what i am entitled to all right like
[40:02] that was spiritual administration he
[40:04] take the money
[40:06] he held out of our country nobody got
[40:08] counselling
[40:09] advise him
[40:10] teach him
[40:11] share with him
[40:13] he just burned the money down to the
[40:15] ground
[40:17] he even invested
[40:20] he opened my business with it
[40:22] he didn't work for it he didn't earn it
[40:24] but he could paint it
[40:26] that's the spirit
[40:28] of entitlement
[40:30] yeah in it
[40:32] you didn't label for it
[40:33] but you could burn it
[40:36] that is why god have no spoiled children
[40:39] because he know the human spirit
[40:41] that's why when people win lotto and
[40:42] lottery and whatnot within three years
[40:44] all the money burn
[40:46] because they never earn it
[40:48] they don't know how to handle it and
[40:50] that is why god had just dropping
[40:51] blessings of character
[40:54] oh glory oh god help me this morning
[40:57] maybe you didn't come for this kind of
[40:58] message but we have it for you this
[40:59] morning
[41:00] we got it locked barrel wrapped and
[41:03] prepared for you this morning
[41:05] oh hallelujah that's why god is dropping
[41:07] the blessings of the character he said
[41:09] character is a victory not a gift
[41:12] that's why all them preachers with this
[41:14] blessing until blessed be stressed and
[41:16] all who bless and bless have no
[41:17] character because they can't manage when
[41:19] god give them that's why god wants
[41:20] somebody to manage power he needs to see
[41:23] character he needs to see what you go
[41:25] through go see him in somebody
[41:28] oh
[41:29] hallelujah hallelujah
[41:31] so you see what enticement is in that
[41:33] young man
[41:34] make him lose everything
[41:37] not just lose the money
[41:39] worse than that
[41:40] what entitlement does
[41:42] it make him lose himself
[41:46] because the power in what he didn't work
[41:49] for
[41:50] or what he didn't in
[41:52] end
[41:53] give him a certain right
[41:56] he could flash on his friends and flush
[41:58] with his car and flush with his house
[42:00] and flash with his belt and flush with
[42:02] everything until the money
[42:05] ran out
[42:07] when the money ran out
[42:09] be it shame pride mixture all together
[42:12] shaken together
[42:15] the big house that they thought he was
[42:17] living
[42:18] he was living in the band behind that
[42:23] he still have a few clothes from he was
[42:25] flashing so you could flush try that
[42:28] but the eaton and the dining
[42:31] was with knife and fork
[42:33] and tablecloth
[42:34] was with the pigs
[42:36] he lost fission
[42:39] he lost focus
[42:42] he lost a sense of direction
[42:45] and he was there in his comfort zone
[42:47] nobody knew
[42:50] but this pig food it's so bad after all
[42:53] i had some ketchup left over
[42:56] had some pepper left over
[42:58] and he was going through that for a
[43:00] while
[43:01] and the bible said he came to himself
[43:05] [Music]
[43:06] you see sometimes god had to do things
[43:08] for you to come
[43:11] to yourself
[43:13] no man could do that for you
[43:15] you go through enough stuff to recognize
[43:17] your own failures your shortcomings and
[43:19] your mistakes and so on when you go
[43:21] through enough stuff you have to come
[43:24] to yourself
[43:25] and when you come to yourself nobody
[43:27] could take you away from the connection
[43:29] and the reconnection with your father
[43:32] oh glory to god he didn't have no sense
[43:34] of shame anymore he was stripped
[43:36] and he was ready to get back home but
[43:38] really want to go there you want to go
[43:39] forward
[43:40] hallelujah
[43:42] so all you who have rights and
[43:43] privileges and feel this and i feel you
[43:46] are entitled to who paying for that
[43:50] some children
[43:52] they don't care all the concern of it is
[43:54] what they need
[43:55] what they feel what their parents are
[43:57] supposed to give them and some parents
[43:59] foolishly give them everything that they
[44:00] want
[44:02] call them spoiled children
[44:04] i'll see if they take parents or cut
[44:06] your tail and put some licks on your
[44:08] life will cut your tail and put licks on
[44:10] you
[44:11] because it's not the way
[44:13] god raises his own children
[44:15] and if god will raise his children that
[44:17] way do raise yours that way
[44:19] because they'll be spoiled rotten
[44:21] that's why the first church was an
[44:23] experienced church with fire holy ghost
[44:25] cleansing and as the church move on it
[44:27] gets less watchful
[44:29] people have less experience they come
[44:31] and join and they become members of the
[44:32] church
[44:33] and the church just went downhill
[44:35] because no fire was present
[44:37] because the people kept complacent
[44:40] in sports
[44:41] many times teams that win championship
[44:45] most times next time they fail and flop
[44:47] because why
[44:49] they they get relaxed
[44:51] they don't seem they need to push
[44:54] to stay on top
[44:56] and that relaxed and that entitled they
[44:59] tell themselves they're skillful they
[45:00] have a lot of skillful men and another
[45:02] group they tapping the ball they're
[45:03] doing this thing they practice it every
[45:05] single day and afterwards they come to
[45:07] the court i went championship that come
[45:09] they cut the throat of the other team
[45:11] that won
[45:13] what happened
[45:15] relax
[45:16] taking it easy
[45:18] entitlement
[45:20] is a false impression of feeling i
[45:23] deserve it
[45:25] and i deserve more
[45:31] it's a condition
[45:33] that people deserve something special or
[45:36] someone owes me something
[45:38] and when you don't get that you get
[45:40] upset
[45:41] you get angry
[45:43] you get angry because it doesn't fulfill
[45:45] the expectation of what you think
[45:48] that you are entitled to
[45:52] so this entitlement affects your spirit
[45:55] it affects your marriage
[45:57] it affects you on the job it affects
[45:58] everywhere because because of your
[46:01] thinking you speak certain things
[46:04] and your attitude goes out a certain way
[46:06] because of that spirit of
[46:09] entitlement
[46:11] do you believe that
[46:14] say it's my money i have to buy what i
[46:15] want that's true
[46:17] but then when you buy things above where
[46:19] you could manage and handle
[46:21] put your hat
[46:23] right you're not very hungry rich in
[46:24] your pet your heart up there
[46:27] and you have to pay for the height very
[46:29] heart-rich
[46:31] and it's your money
[46:34] but you're you're right
[46:35] that behind you
[46:41] so then
[46:42] you live in anger resentment
[46:45] and frustration because others are not
[46:49] responding to the way you think you
[46:51] deserve
[46:53] katamata straight out of minister
[46:55] overseas
[46:56] rip him
[46:58] and he felt like i was unfair
[47:00] but he was off and what he was teaching
[47:03] and preaching i had to tell him the
[47:04] truth
[47:06] he challenged people if he preached and
[47:07] think come and talk to him i decided to
[47:09] go and talk to him with the other
[47:10] ministers
[47:11] he didn't expect that he was shocked
[47:14] but
[47:15] this is what i will do
[47:17] you make your boss and see if he's
[47:19] thinking wrong let somebody come and
[47:20] talk to us good fine i'm coming
[47:25] because this is my father's word
[47:27] and i am standing with the word

[47:31] them as long as they stay with the word
[47:32] i we we are friends we go work together

[54:46] they bake it
[54:47] they make it
[54:49] god dropping down fresh bread every
[54:51] manner every single day fresh
[54:54] from god's bakery
[54:56] but these rascals say
[54:57] this bear is too light
[55:02] the one whole wheat one
[55:05] they want whole grain manner
[55:12] entitlement
[55:14] we want meat retirees like bread

[55:39] we forget yesterday
[55:41] what god did for us as far as we can say
[55:43] when things going good hallelujah we
[55:45] have a testimony glory glory glory when
[55:47] things get going bad or things going off
[55:49] we forget his faithfulness
[55:52] we forget his trueness
[55:54] we forget how we kept us come on peace
[55:56] back to me
[55:58] there's a different kind of service is
[55:59] there an interruption there's a pastoral
[56:01] kind of stuff because this is what i get
[56:03] for you this morning because i want you
[56:04] to get on fire i wanted to get all
[56:06] complacency i want you to know you're
[56:08] not entitled
[56:10] you have to fight for it
[56:13] [Music]
[56:19] when i see
[56:20] what paul said it shook me up
[56:24] did you get what paul said
[56:26] this is paul who met the jesus christ
[56:29] this is paul who met pillar fire you
[56:31] can't see him in killer fire this is
[56:33] paul called to be opposite of the
[56:35] gentiles this is paul saying how he's
[56:37] going to run
[56:39] he's not running just to run he's
[56:41] running to obtain oh come on now
[56:50] when you feel entitled
[56:52] you just feel like
[56:54] you could take things for granted
[56:57] you plant a promoter tree pump city tree
[56:59] what you take for granted
[57:02] the insects and worms depend on the
[57:03] country
[57:05] they're not taking for granted
[57:07] they're working
[57:09] and when you snoring sleeping they're
[57:11] working
[57:12] when you're coming now it's big worm
[57:15] big bees
[57:17] big buzz whatever it is bugs
[57:19] because they're working
[57:21] so what i'm beginning to realize
[57:23] it's not a matter of taking your
[57:24] salvation for granted
[57:26] is understand the support systems that
[57:29] god require for you to maintain and
[57:32] uphold
[57:33] your salvation
[57:35] your redemption your blessing
[57:38] and you can't take it for granted so
[57:39] paul said
[57:41] clearly
[57:42] the reason he buffeted his body and end
[57:44] up tough
[57:46] how's the purpose of that
[57:48] say tough
[57:50] some people do so
[57:55] too soft
[57:58] the devil's you fisher if anybody
[58:01] he will kill a baby he will kill old
[58:02] people he kill everybody you know
[58:04] because he's trying to cut people off
[58:06] from breaking through we are about to
[58:09] break through i know it i'm speaking it
[58:10] [Music]
[58:11] you hear what i said
[58:13] but this spirit has to go
[58:16] so we are fighting it we gotta fight it
[58:19] because you see this is not gonna keep
[58:20] it back from pressing into the revival
[58:22] fire
[58:23] i am not no catholic priest i'm not
[58:24] bringing a wafer for you
[58:27] oh glory to god every one of you are
[58:29] priests unto god
[58:30] every one of you have to connect to god
[58:32] you're not connecting to god through me
[58:35] sorry maybe other pastors he could
[58:37] connect through that but not that not
[58:39] here
[58:40] when the veil was ran from the top to
[58:41] the bottom he showed you to have direct
[58:43] access
[58:46] [Music]
[58:47] [Applause]
[58:48] god forgive you then you have to forgive
[58:49] your own self when god forgive you
[58:52] some people don't want to forgive
[58:53] yourself so they end up in a pity party
[58:55] you know
[58:56] my lord
[58:57] so this is something that bunks up here
[58:58] two of the biggest challenges
[59:00] confronting work places in 2020 are
[59:02] complacency and entitlement while there
[59:04] are many external factors that can
[59:06] affect how someone feels and thinks
[59:09] complacency and entitlement are direct
[59:12] reflections of one mindset amen
[59:17] pride which makes a person think more
[59:19] than himself
[59:20] more about himself or herself than what
[59:22] he actually is the bible specifically
[59:24] exhorted us let not a man think more
[59:26] highly
[59:31] so when your mind think you up there
[59:34] oh jesus gave lots of parables you know
[59:35] he said when you invite you to a feast
[59:38] take the seat at the lowest table
[59:41] you see if your mind just tells yourself
[59:43] you're on and you are it and you're
[59:45] sitting on the high table they say if
[59:47] you take a city high table leave
[59:48] somebody more worthy than you comes
[59:52] no and they have to move you
[59:56] so if you take the lowest seat they
[59:58] could move you up
[1:00:02] but when you take the highest seat
[1:00:04] there's only one place to move here
[1:00:06] that's dull
[1:00:10] all these are principles of living
[1:00:13] let me say again all these are
[1:00:15] principles
[1:00:16] of living
[1:00:18] take the lowest seat
[1:00:20] let them promote you let them recognize
[1:00:22] you you're big oh sorry we didn't oh
[1:00:24] it's you sorry sorry
[1:00:27] and we could take you to your voices
[1:00:38] and this is what somebody shared about
[1:00:40] a few examples of an entitled heart what
[1:00:42] was given to me was not what i deserve
[1:00:45] [Music]
[1:00:51] others are blessed easily but why am i
[1:00:53] still struggling i deserve more than
[1:00:55] them
[1:00:56] i deserve that job because i'm more
[1:00:58] efficient than that person
[1:01:01] since i've gone through a lot from my
[1:01:02] childhoods i deserve to be more blessed
[1:01:04] by god
[1:01:06] i am deserved to be treated well i'm
[1:01:07] working hard for the church
[1:01:13] entitlement
[1:01:16] the fruits of entitled spirit did not
[1:01:19] refer to the spirit
[1:01:21] the fruit of entitled spirit is
[1:01:23] comparison
[1:01:26] and that's me so canada
[1:01:28] i better than she i better than she had
[1:01:30] comparison discontent
[1:01:32] disappointment opinionated false
[1:01:34] expectation from people and god jealousy
[1:01:37] and envy
[1:01:38] so but it's to be an entitlement you
[1:01:39] can't rejoice with somebody who get
[1:01:40] blessed with something because you
[1:01:42] figure that should be my job
[1:01:46] so you can't the bible says rejoice with
[1:01:47] your brother and rejoice with your
[1:01:48] sister rejoice you can't rejoice because
[1:01:50] you figure is that where they get there
[1:01:55] are they coming to so long
[1:01:57] i should not have a husband long time i
[1:01:59] should have wife long time i said that
[1:02:00] this long time
[1:02:01] look a long time and you go through all
[1:02:03] of that
[1:02:04] oh my praise god amen
[1:02:08] one of the breakthrough to all of this
[1:02:10] is to be grateful
[1:02:12] and to be thankful
[1:02:14] because complaining weakens your feet
[1:02:17] you hear what i'm saying
[1:02:18] complaining weakens your fate so you
[1:02:21] begin to thank god for the day i wake up
[1:02:23] in the morning
[1:02:25] you should see me sometimes my wife says
[1:02:27] so i had to hold my back a little bit so
[1:02:29] i'm just pause
[1:02:30] to finish straighten up
[1:02:32] i thank god i could straighten up
[1:02:34] there's some people who got straightened
[1:02:35] up
[1:02:36] but i straightened up
[1:02:38] i could make one step two step take my
[1:02:40] time
[1:02:41] but i'm getting there
[1:02:42] because they get older the bones
[1:02:44] creaking
[1:02:45] as they're going all the things
[1:02:46] happening
[1:02:47] but you press it on anyhow
[1:02:49] oh give the lord some praises this
[1:02:51] morning
[1:02:52] hallelujah you love him
[1:02:55] oh praise the name of the lord
[1:02:57] my god
[1:02:59] so don't focus on your own life
[1:03:02] baby said mind the things of others
[1:03:05] and it's get away from your selfishness
[1:03:08] get away from your ungratefulness
[1:03:09] because you know ungratefulness
[1:03:12] my god
[1:03:14] and when jesus healed ten lepers one
[1:03:16] only one came back you know
[1:03:17] what was jesus first response where are
[1:03:19] the other name
[1:03:22] they're men having fun
[1:03:24] one came back
[1:03:25] out of ten
[1:03:26] god appreciate
[1:03:28] gratefulness
[1:03:30] are you grateful
[1:03:32] you see when you're grateful you're not
[1:03:34] going to be worried and stressed out
[1:03:35] about what's going to come
[1:03:36] because you're trying for what if god
[1:03:38] isn't if god healed you of uh
[1:03:40] your foot was bent and your horse
[1:03:42] straight on your foot go get healed your
[1:03:43] hand goku could heal other patchwork god
[1:03:45] bring you so far god could take care of
[1:03:47] you
[1:03:48] are you not worried about people and i
[1:03:49] remember in kyogre with a few people as
[1:03:51] we pray for them pray for them pray for
[1:03:52] them i know god like a buddhism with 10
[1:03:54] people
[1:03:55] and after all i say lord i commit them
[1:03:57] into your hands after that never take
[1:03:58] them back home
[1:04:01] i am not i am not your i am not your god
[1:04:04] god the god who start to work in you i
[1:04:07] want to think about that now
[1:04:08] not some church study working you know
[1:04:10] no church called you know is the god
[1:04:13] that started to work on you is able to
[1:04:15] finish it
[1:04:17] you received the call of god upon your
[1:04:19] life
[1:04:20] the devil didn't call you god called you
[1:04:22] yes you went through this you went
[1:04:23] through that but god called you your
[1:04:25] backslide but god still called you the
[1:04:27] devil couldn't call you all who you
[1:04:29] phone you call that is why you could
[1:04:31] bounce back
[1:04:33] because there's a calling upon your life
[1:04:35] or give the lost some praises
[1:04:38] oh glory to god you know what i said
[1:04:39] that is why it could bounce back
[1:04:41] [Music]

[1:04:46] some and bring in some
[1:04:49] oh glory to god yes yes yes people are
[1:04:51] going to be delivered right under this

[1:05:07] woman president of america i'm not ready
[1:05:08] for that i'm waiting to see what's going
[1:05:10] to happen among god's people
[1:05:11] because i know what is promised among
[1:05:13] god's people and that's what i'm looking
[1:05:15] for so now my light is like a torchlight
[1:05:17] shine on this thing about complacency
[1:05:19] and upon uh uh um entitlement and i
[1:05:23] recognize that have to shake people's
[1:05:25] lives and homes
[1:05:26] they come like a husband saying they
[1:05:28] waiting for the wife to bring
[1:05:31] breakfast

[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:01] i'm
[1:06:02] alive i have strength

[1:06:07] who got fired from his job
[1:06:08] and he came back home all depressed
[1:06:11] and when his wife heard he got fired she
[1:06:14] took him one of the best news out

[1:06:29] do
[1:06:30] and she hold the the frying pan
[1:06:33] this way
[1:06:35] because she want to know before you lose

[1:06:39] and she'll be rated man why are we gonna
[1:06:41] pay the bill and are you gonna do this
[1:06:42] and how are you doing

[1:06:46] were talking about and encouraging his
[1:06:47] husband and cook good food frame and
[1:06:48] whatnot she was inspired
[1:06:51] that is the kind of help bt want

[1:07:09] to make you feel to go out there and
[1:07:12] try again oh glory
[1:07:15] isn't this what the services do to you
[1:07:19] isn't this what the gospel does to you
[1:07:22] it helped bring you all to the
[1:07:24] the dumps to bring you onto the
[1:07:25] depression and frustration and tell you
[1:07:28] know what i could break out
[1:07:29] i could break through
[1:07:31] i could break the strong barrier i could
[1:07:33] get to where i want to go
[1:07:35] oh glory to god i'm not fighting the air
[1:07:38] i'm not beating not beating up there's
[1:07:39] nobody fighting you're not fighting
[1:07:41] you're not don quixote fighting windmill
[1:07:43] [Applause]
[1:07:44] glory though god you're fighting i'm not
[1:07:46] against flesh and blood but against
[1:07:48] principles and powers my god i feel the
[1:07:51] devils backing up this morning
[1:08:04] we need
[1:08:06] a spirit of gratitude
[1:08:09] it cannot be that the trials block up
[1:08:11] not all what god have done for you
[1:08:13] you're so much you're so much in
[1:08:15] distress that you almost want to curse
[1:08:17] god that was the devil tell job tell god
[1:08:20] i'll make him curse you get mad crack at
[1:08:22] him
[1:08:24] and what the devil bring trials after
[1:08:26] trials after trying joe was real blessed
[1:08:28] everybody knew joe was not blessed
[1:08:31] only marketplace draws a fine words to
[1:08:32] the people but when he tries to come and
[1:08:34] hit him so
[1:08:39] the beginning was not too bad
[1:08:41] it was just drugs
[1:08:43] you see many boys come
[1:08:45] and his wife started helping him clean
[1:08:48] and then he had to kiss himself
[1:08:50] because afterwards you get tired
[1:08:52] but to show you the grace in that man he
[1:08:54] say you're she's like he's
[1:08:56] calling him dead
[1:08:58] maybe i'll get insurance afterwards but
[1:08:59] do something
[1:09:01] but but but but but what's your grace
[1:09:04] upon job he said you speak like a
[1:09:06] foolish woman
[1:09:07] he knew he a minor foolish woman no
[1:09:09] foolish woman can i be his wife
[1:09:14] god did not deem that
[1:09:16] god didn't set that up
[1:09:18] job job couldn't be where he was with
[1:09:20] all that kind of woman by him so he know
[1:09:22] his wife under pressure and under
[1:09:24] pressure he doesn't say the wrong thing
[1:09:26] so i want to ease the pressure so you
[1:09:28] can say the right thing
[1:09:30] could the sister say amen brother see
[1:09:32] amen everybody see amen oh hallelujah
[1:09:36] so sometimes that ungratefulness is the
[1:09:37] source of one's own misery
[1:09:39] and people spread that misery
[1:09:42] ungrateful people are not only grateful
[1:09:44] to god but to their families and their
[1:09:45] friends and their coworkers and their
[1:09:46] neighbors they're gone faithful to the
[1:09:48] church leaders they're quick to judge
[1:09:50] condemn everyone who has fallen short of
[1:09:51] their standards
[1:09:54] i obama say anybody you see somebody
[1:09:55] giving trouble in church i'm saying this
[1:09:57] wrong and that wrong and that offer that
[1:09:58] off nine out of 10 times them off
[1:10:04] but they start something and they almost
[1:10:06] have a placard
[1:10:14] is everybody's fault they upset somebody
[1:10:17] driving too slow sometimes you do fast
[1:10:19] your car please
[1:10:22] did you too hot did you too cold you'd
[1:10:23] bring it in the military too
[1:10:26] just like at least
[1:10:28] i tell somebody sometimes do you don't
[1:10:31] do you're dumb
[1:10:32] don't you're damned i say i do what i
[1:10:34] feel like to do
[1:10:36] because if i cater for people you would
[1:10:38] do don't do don't you just walk away
[1:10:41] so i just had to do i feel like
[1:10:44] oh my
[1:10:46] so thanksgiving give a grateful heart
[1:10:48] and and and when you come you're not
[1:10:50] thankful spirit you're not in that mean
[1:10:52] angry spirit you bless god for this
[1:10:54] brother let's go for this sister you get
[1:10:55] that newbie he could get the new shoes

[1:11:06] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:09] thank you lord jesus oh praise god amen
[1:11:13] so therefore you have to look at your
[1:11:15] own attitude start to examine how you
[1:11:18] are entitled how you believe you're
[1:11:19] entitled and focus on helping others
[1:11:22] amen now let's go all right
[1:11:24] such trust that happens this morning
[1:11:27] i want to
[1:11:28] wear you out but
[1:11:31] brother brianna
[1:11:33] he says and we know that there's going
[1:11:35] to be a bride and there's going to be a
[1:11:37] wedding supper silver in the skies
[1:11:39] that's as sure to be as god is because
[1:11:42] it is in his word and we know that those
[1:11:44] that are going to make up the bride is
[1:11:46] going to be in his church and they're
[1:11:48] going to appear before him without spot
[1:11:50] or wrinkle here we go and they have the
[1:11:53] material and it now to make themselves
[1:11:55] ready if you notice she has made herself

[1:15:52] oh give the lord a shout
[1:15:54] a first pull a second pull a purple oh
[1:15:58] give the lord a shout in the house
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:11] when when moses and all them
[1:16:12] troublemakers that follow moses of egypt
[1:16:15] it wasn't all elected people in a whole
[1:16:17] about three kind of believers and more
[1:16:21] all kind of believers
[1:16:23] but they say all of the lord said come
[1:16:24] with me i'm still reading that's right
[1:16:26] he opened the earth and sold them up
[1:16:28] they were good people too sure they were
[1:16:30] they were fine people
[1:16:31] fine people swallowed up
[1:16:34] yes but that didn't do it not all said
[1:16:36] lord lord but the ones that do it the
[1:16:38] will of my father
[1:16:39] not he that starts
[1:16:42] is he that finishes
[1:16:44] there are no short cuts you are
[1:16:46] disqualified at the end of the race
[1:16:49] so it's not running the race it's how
[1:16:51] you run
[1:16:56] you are no shortcut shaking hand joining
[1:16:58] church denomination or
[1:17:00] confessing confessing the message
[1:17:05] i'm a believer of the brother brother
[1:17:08] and you never say but i believe too
[1:17:10] the bible said he never believes i'm
[1:17:11] trembling amen
[1:17:14] oh my hallelujah
[1:17:16] so paul
[1:17:18] paul says
[1:17:19] uh he said watch this is the amplified
[1:17:21] do you know that in a race all the
[1:17:23] runners compete
[1:17:25] but only one received the prize
[1:17:27] so run your race that you may lay hold
[1:17:29] of the prize and make it yours
[1:17:32] i love that
[1:17:33] run the race and lay hold of the prize
[1:17:36] and make it yours
[1:17:38] you have to want it as a possession
[1:17:41] [Applause]
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:42] what we are preaching you have to want
[1:17:44] it as a possession
[1:17:46] as the owner of it
[1:17:48] you actually have it
[1:17:53] now every athlete who goes to training
[1:17:55] conducts himself temporarily and
[1:17:58] restricts himself in all things
[1:18:00] so what paul's saying now if you're
[1:18:02] going to training you have to come into
[1:18:04] discipline
[1:18:05] there's no training on discipline
[1:18:07] playing football well you practice when
[1:18:10] you practice
[1:18:11] doesn't work so even
[1:18:14] waiting inside the army not cleaning the
[1:18:16] boots and shoes
[1:18:18] and you say what that have to do with
[1:18:20] i think is cleaning boots and shoes and
[1:18:21] making up your bed do you know that
[1:18:26] but somebody come inside and say but
[1:18:28] what where are you fighting
[1:18:31] i woke up
[1:18:33] i want to fight the enemy
[1:18:35] but they start every morning
[1:18:38] inspecting your dead makeup every single
[1:18:40] day
[1:18:42] every single day
[1:18:44] that's the routine you want for
[1:18:45] discipline
[1:18:49] i'll jump off and say oh god i don't run
[1:18:51] to the battle no bed makeup
[1:18:57] you can imagine joshua there's a bunch
[1:18:58] of people in this message when i bring
[1:19:00] you the show shout and somebody feeling
[1:19:01] led
[1:19:02] had a dream last night
[1:19:07] i just feeling hallelujah
[1:19:09] i need to
[1:19:11] break the rhythm of the spirit
[1:19:12] everything falls down nothing jericho
[1:19:14] was i'm straight richard
[1:19:16] because you're breaking the order of the
[1:19:17] spirit
[1:19:18] you have to follow the holy spirit
[1:19:19] because joshua heard from god and then
[1:19:22] if we hear from god you will get his
[1:19:23] supernatural instructions
[1:19:25] so paul said so paul was saying no every
[1:19:27] athlete who goes into training conducts
[1:19:29] himself temporarily restricts himself in
[1:19:31] all things they do it to win a reit that
[1:19:34] will soon wither but we do it to receive
[1:19:36] a crown of eternal blessedness that
[1:19:38] cannot wither therefore here we go here
[1:19:41] we go therefore i do not run uncertainly
[1:19:44] without definite aim
[1:19:46] i do not box like one bit in the air and
[1:19:48] strike him without anniversary but like
[1:19:51] a boxer
[1:19:52] like a boxer i buffet my body
[1:19:55] i handle it roughly i discipline my
[1:19:58] hardships and subdue it for fear that
[1:20:01] after proclaiming to others the gospel
[1:20:04] and things pertaining to it i myself
[1:20:06] should be unfit
[1:20:08] not stand the test be unapproved and be
[1:20:11] judged as a counterfeit
[1:20:12] so you know what paul was saying here i
[1:20:15] am not seeing myself as entitled
[1:20:21] i hope you see that this morning
[1:20:23] so paul
[1:20:24] wasn't under the spirit of entitlement
[1:20:27] or had the sense of entitlement so he
[1:20:30] couldn't be complacent
[1:20:33] so he brought himself in order
[1:20:36] to keep what he got
[1:20:38] and to strive and run correctly or give
[1:20:41] the lord some praises
[1:20:44] paul could i rock back and said i'm an
[1:20:46] apostle i am a diss i am a dot paul
[1:20:49] could i rock back on all of that he did
[1:20:51] not
[1:20:52] he said the reason i'm doing this
[1:20:54] because he said because he's like a box
[1:20:57] i buffered my body handed roughly
[1:20:58] disciplined by hardship and shaped you
[1:21:00] with for fear that after proclaiming
[1:21:02] that others the gospel and things
[1:21:03] pertain to it i myself shall become
[1:21:05] unfit
[1:21:06] oh my hallelujah ephesians 4 amplifies
[1:21:10] letting him the tv still no more like
[1:21:11] thieves and children
[1:21:13] rather than be industrious making and
[1:21:14] honestly in his own hands let no foul or
[1:21:16] polluting language or evil word who's to
[1:21:19] do it for you
[1:21:20] that's your mouth that you
[1:21:22] come out your mouth but only such speech
[1:21:25] as in good and beneficial to the
[1:21:27] spiritual progress of others as is
[1:21:29] fitting to the need and occasion that it
[1:21:31] may be blessing and give grace to the
[1:21:33] fever to those who hear it
[1:21:35] oh my
[1:21:36] and then this other scripture this is
[1:21:38] colossians chapter 3 verse 5 mortified

[1:21:49] covetousness which is ideology for which
[1:21:52] things shake the wrath of god comment
[1:21:53] upon tyrion of disobedience oh my
[1:21:56] colossians 3 amplified say so kill
[1:22:00] deaden or deprive of power
[1:22:03] that same scripture we just read this is
[1:22:04] the amplified of it
[1:22:06] kill
[1:22:07] deaden or deprive of power the evil
[1:22:09] desires linking in your members
[1:22:12] whose animal impulses and all that is
[1:22:15] earthly in you that is employed in sin
[1:22:18] sexual advice impurity sensual appetites
[1:22:21] unholy desires and all greed and
[1:22:23] consciousness for that is idolatry the
[1:22:26] define of self and other created things
[1:22:28] instead of god

[1:23:28] he said watch watch
[1:23:30] he says now how long does a baby cry
[1:23:33] until he gets satisfied
[1:23:35] that's the way the believing christians
[1:23:36] should do god's child if you see that
[1:23:39] god made his promise don't give it up
[1:23:41] cry till it's answered

[1:26:59] the bible talk about working your own
[1:27:00] salvation out

[1:27:05] it's nothing to take lightly
[1:27:07] he came unto his own his own received
[1:27:09] him now

[1:27:12] and when jesus began to preach
[1:27:14] they ball oh father's eat man in the
[1:27:16] wilderness and jesus and everyone dead
