[48:20] church
[48:21] Bethlehem Tabernacle and the fellowship
[48:23] and it was really a wonderful time in
[48:25] the presence of the Lord and we are here
[48:28] one more time on a Easter Sunday
[48:32] just realizing that it's quite a few
[48:35] times we haven't had the Easter Sunday
[48:36] like this with the whole pandemic and
[48:38] that kind of stuff so we are in for a
[48:39] time this morning we are looking for God
[48:42] to do something beyond our expectation
[48:44] beyond our imagination I don't know what
[48:46] you came to do but I came to get
[48:48] something more from the Lord I came to
[48:50] climb higher than I've ever climbed
[48:52] before I'm not here to preach to you I'm
[48:54] preaching to myself
[48:56] Hallelujah because I need something from
[48:59] the Lord and I don't know about you but
[49:00] I believe you need something in the Lord
[49:01] as well and we want to hear direct from
[49:03] God this morning him to speak to our
[49:05] hearts Hallelujah because it's the

[49:23] thank you so much musicians thank you
[49:25] brother Anthony for the wonderful
[49:28] worship service and the music systems
[49:30] and the musical so can we go to our
[49:32] Bibles reading First Corinthians chapter
[49:35] one and reading first Peter 2 for
[49:38] scripture readings this morning
[49:41] amen
[49:44] reading First Corinthians
[49:47] chapter 1 and reading verse 18 and as I
[49:52] read the scripture I remember about a
[49:53] Terence salutable deterrence and Tamara
[49:56] Terry preach on this and such a blessing
[49:59] First Corinthians 1 verse 18 for the
[50:01] preaching of the Cross is to them that
[50:04] perish foolishness
[50:07] but unto us which are saved it is the
[50:09] power of God
[50:12] so unto them that perish it's
[50:14] foolishness but to us which I save it is
[50:17] the power of God for it is written I
[50:19] will destroy the wisdom of the wise and
[50:22] I will bring to nothing the
[50:23] understanding of The Prudent where is
[50:26] the wise where is describe where is the
[50:29] disputer of this world hath not God made
[50:32] foolish the wisdom of this world
[50:36] for after that in the wisdom of God the
[50:39] World by wisdom knew not God in other
[50:41] words the total wisdom of this world
[50:43] could never understand God
[50:46] they can study it they could analyze it
[50:48] they could try to figure it out but
[50:50] after they graduated all the wisdom you
[50:52] could acquire here and the Earth you
[50:54] will never understand God
[50:55] but it pleased God by the foolishness of
[50:58] preaching
[50:59] oh Hallelujah so we're here for some
[51:01] foolishness this morning
[51:03] it pleased God by the foolishness of
[51:06] preaching to save them that believe for
[51:09] the Jews require a sign and the Greeks
[51:11] seek after wisdom but we preach Christ
[51:14] crucified unto the Jews a stumbling
[51:17] block and unto the Greek's foolishness
[51:20] Hallelujah many people will think we are
[51:22] foolish this morning many people think
[51:25] you're wasting your time going to church
[51:26] many people think you're wasting your
[51:28] time committing your life and your
[51:30] energy and your strength to this gospel
[51:32] but to us who understand it's our life
[51:34] it's our strength it's our joy it's our
[51:37] peace height sounds crazy oh I might
[51:40] look crazy you wake up on a Sunday
[51:42] morning to come to church and nobody
[51:45] could understand you but unto them which
[51:47] are called Jews and Greeks Christ the
[51:50] power and God and the wisdom of God
[51:51] verse 24 25 because the foolishness of
[51:55] God
[51:56] come on young people it's wiser than men
[51:59] and the weakness of God if you can find
[52:02] a weakness the weakness of God is
[52:04] stronger than men for he see your
[52:07] calling Brethren how that not many wise
[52:10] men after the flesh not many mighty not
[52:14] many noble are called but God had chosen
[52:18] the foolish things of the world to
[52:20] confound the wise and God had chosen the
[52:24] weak things of the world to confound the
[52:26] things that are Mighty and the base
[52:29] things of the world and things which are
[52:31] despised had God chosen yea and things
[52:34] which are not to bring to nor things
[52:37] that are may the Lord had a blessing to
[52:39] the reading of his word and reading
[52:41] first Peter
[52:42] chapter 2 and reading verse 9 First
[52:45] Peter chapter 2 and reading verse 9 but
[52:48] ye are a chosen generation
[52:50] a royal priesthood and a holy nation A
[52:54] peculiar people that he should show for
[52:57] the Praises of him who are called you
[52:59] out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[53:02] which in time past were not a people but
[53:05] are now the people of God which had not
[53:08] attained Mercy but now have obtained
[53:11] Mercy may the Lord had a blessing to the
[53:13] reading of his word you may be seated in
[53:15] the house of the Lord this morning and
[53:19] we are so happy this morning to see what
[53:22] God is going to do I have a title this
[53:24] morning the god of the unexpected
[53:28] the god of the unexpected
[53:31] and for a subject unexpected ways
[53:35] unexpected places an unexpected times
[53:39] and an inspiration transfer of power
[53:44] transfer of power
[53:46] and I chose this text the god of the
[53:49] unexpected
[53:51] because Easter morning was unexpected
[53:56] when Jesus rose from the dead not even
[53:59] the disciples expected it
[54:02] they were astonished
[54:04] even though they had heard messages
[54:06] about it when it actually happened the
[54:08] reality of it was a lot for them to even
[54:11] process because they didn't think it was
[54:12] going to happen but I don't want to
[54:13] really talk too much about the disciples
[54:15] yet I want to go back all the way to the
[54:18] beginning because God has always been
[54:20] the god of the unexpected
[54:23] and God has always used the unexpected
[54:26] he has a way of doing things in an
[54:28] unexpected way
[54:30] in unexpected places and at unexpected
[54:33] times and that's how God has always
[54:36] operated because if something is
[54:38] expected then you could do something
[54:39] about it but when something is
[54:41] unexpected then you really don't know
[54:43] how to treat with it and God loves to
[54:45] work around what the devil is trying to
[54:47] do and you have to realize that the
[54:50] devil has always been trying to do
[54:51] something since he was up in heaven
[54:53] try to overthrow but then when he tried
[54:56] to overthrow and he had an expectation
[54:58] that because he didn't try to overthrow
[54:59] thinking he's going to lose he went to
[55:01] try to overthrow thinking he could get
[55:03] power to himself
[55:04] but he had an expectation but a joy that
[55:06] he would have win this battle but he
[55:08] didn't realize that the god of the
[55:10] unexpected had some Sons
[55:13] who did something that was unexpected
[55:15] these Sons draw their swords and against
[55:18] the expectation that the devil had that
[55:20] he was going to win up there these sons
[55:22] did the unexpected and they kicked the
[55:24] devil Out of Heaven
[55:26] and send the devil down on the earth and
[55:28] then God started to keep doing the
[55:30] unexpected because when Satan came on
[55:33] the earth he thought he was going to
[55:34] rule the Satan thought this was his
[55:36] territory he was walking here and then
[55:38] God placed man on the earth and God did
[55:41] one again the unexpected by giving man
[55:45] power on the earth God has never wanted
[55:47] to keep his power for himself we have
[55:49] preached so many times within God was
[55:51] locked up the power to heal the power to
[55:54] deliver the power to restore the power
[55:56] to redeem the power to baptize the power
[55:59] to save the power to heal the power to
[56:01] open prison bars but God didn't have
[56:03] nobody he was a laptop he had nobody he
[56:05] was sick he had nobody he could have
[56:07] seen the song of Amazing Grace so God
[56:09] had to make a way for this thing to
[56:11] happen and this thing to unfold him and
[56:13] God gave power to this man called Adam
[56:16] and Adam was given Dominion to rule it
[56:20] to rule his life to rule his house to be
[56:24] just like his father a transfer of power
[56:27] took place Hallelujah that's my
[56:29] inspiration a transfer of power took
[56:32] place and Adam had power Adam had
[56:34] Authority he didn't have to go to God
[56:36] for permission to move a mountain he
[56:38] didn't have to go to God for permission
[56:40] to name an animal he didn't have to go
[56:42] to God for permission because he was
[56:43] given power there was a transfer of
[56:46] power and Adam under inspiration could
[56:49] decide where he wanted the mountain to
[56:51] be he could decide where he wanted the
[56:53] trees to be he could decide how he
[56:55] wanted things to look if he didn't like
[56:57] how the mountain looked yesterday in
[56:59] that spot he had the power to move the
[57:00] mountain to decide he didn't have to
[57:02] turn around his chair if he wanted to
[57:04] change his view he could have just
[57:06] change his view without turning around
[57:07] his chair because he could move
[57:08] mountains and move streams and move
[57:10] Rivers but Satan infiltrated God's Eden
[57:14] but God was not surprised Satan expected
[57:17] friends that when man fell that was it
[57:20] that the power would have moved to him
[57:22] but we know through the preaching of the
[57:24] message that the unexpected happened
[57:27] and when Satan thought he would catch
[57:29] the deed to control the Earth it slipped
[57:32] out of his hand the unexpected happened
[57:34] and the god of the unexpected took back
[57:38] the power that he had given to Adam and
[57:40] that power left man and went back into
[57:42] the hands of the original owner so Satan
[57:45] thought that he could have outsmarted
[57:48] God and had gotten access to the power
[57:50] but that power is reserved only for some
[57:53] sons and some daughters who were in the
[57:55] thoughts in the back part of God's mind
[57:57] so from way back in Eden God has always
[58:00] had a mission to transfer power one more
[58:03] time back to man who would have dominion
[58:06] so since the Garden of Eden call us had
[58:08] one objective God doesn't want to rule
[58:11] this Earth this Earth is not his
[58:13] jurisdiction Heaven is his jurisdiction
[58:15] the Bible said the Earth Is His
[58:17] footstool but this Earth belongs to some
[58:20] people who are supposed to have the
[58:22] authority God didn't give a minion to
[58:25] the Earth to himself he gave Dominion to
[58:27] man him
[58:28] you don't hear me this morning the
[58:30] dominion over crawling things creeping
[58:33] things situations God didn't give it to
[58:35] angels He didn't keep it to himself he
[58:38] said I'm putting you man to have
[58:39] dominion dominion over everything power
[58:43] over everything control over everything
[58:46] [Applause]
[58:49] Hallelujah
[58:50] Hallelujah so I want you to catch
[58:53] something friends we're talking about
[58:54] unexpected ways unexpected places
[58:58] unexpected times unexpected things
[59:00] that's why I read the scripture in First
[59:02] Peter that hear our chosen generation
[59:05] that was unexpected Hallelujah nobody
[59:08] thought God would choose you nobody
[59:10] thought God would choose me if you look
[59:12] at your book report your family history
[59:14] what your grandfather did what your
[59:16] great grandfather did with your great
[59:18] great great great grandmother did nobody
[59:21] would say God would ever choose you they
[59:23] are so much trough in your closet in
[59:25] your father Closet in your grandparents
[59:27] closet you were not born in this natural
[59:30] world from a line that was deserving of
[59:32] this blessing but God still say you are
[59:35] a chosen generation and the devil cannot
[59:38] understand that because it's unexpected
[59:40] or you don't hear me this morning oh
[59:43] Hallelujah and the same way Easter was
[59:46] unexpectedly going to get to it
[59:48] you'd think if Jesus if the devil knew
[59:50] Jesus was going to race from the dead
[59:52] and what is going to happen as a
[59:53] consequence he was going to allow that
[59:55] to happen
[59:59] God did you unexpected and is but but a
[1:00:02] joy is about time Satan understand that
[1:00:04] God is a good to be unexpected you know
[1:00:05] because every single time the devil try
[1:00:08] to do something to stop God's movement
[1:00:10] God does the unexpected there has never
[1:00:13] been a time so when man fell and God
[1:00:17] looked at man and the devil looked at
[1:00:19] man the devil saying look again and
[1:00:22] God's saying well look what I'm gonna do
[1:00:23] now
[1:00:25] look what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna
[1:00:27] make a way for them to get right back
[1:00:29] there they fell but I'm gonna do the
[1:00:31] unexpected I'm still gonna use man I'm
[1:00:34] not gonna throw him away God said Adam
[1:00:36] where are you
[1:00:39] you know the devil taught God is going
[1:00:41] to leave and I'm there to just fall
[1:00:42] apart
[1:00:43] but God did he unexpected he said Adam
[1:00:46] are looking for you Adam where you're
[1:00:48] hiding I don't where you went I come
[1:00:50] down for fellowship and you're not here
[1:00:52] Adam what you're doing you're not in
[1:00:53] your position you're not in your place
[1:00:55] you're not worshiping you're not
[1:00:57] shouting and I'm not gonna just leave
[1:00:59] you to do what you want to come and look
[1:01:00] in for you Adam you have to do something
[1:01:02] we have to do something about this
[1:01:03] situation and I didn't invest so much
[1:01:06] into you to allow this to fall and I'm
[1:01:08] not going to let the devil allow this to
[1:01:10] fall so I'm gonna do the unexpected
[1:01:14] I'm gonna find a way to get you back to
[1:01:16] Eden
[1:01:18] I'm gonna find a way to restore your
[1:01:20] line
[1:01:21] even though you fall I'm gonna send
[1:01:23] another man who's gonna raise back this
[1:01:25] line again
[1:01:26] I'm gonna find somebody else to undo
[1:01:30] what the devil did it's gonna be an
[1:01:32] unexpected thing in an unexpected way at
[1:01:36] an unexpected time with the unexpected
[1:01:38] people oh Hallelujah you don't hear me
[1:01:41] this morning
[1:01:42] oh Hallelujah
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:46] and throughout scripture I'm gonna jump
[1:01:49] all over this morning but I want you to
[1:01:51] understand that the objective of man
[1:01:53] falling and the objective of sin was to
[1:01:55] drive to one thing death
[1:01:57] because the only way Satan could have
[1:01:59] held people was through death
[1:02:01] he couldn't get access to anybody until
[1:02:03] you died
[1:02:05] so the devil had one objective death
[1:02:07] because death was an automatic transfer
[1:02:09] into his territory
[1:02:11] and God said you know what I'm gonna do
[1:02:13] I'm gonna use this same thing called
[1:02:15] that
[1:02:22] I'm going to use this same death thing
[1:02:23] or the devil think you have control over
[1:02:25] so for all those Generations all those
[1:02:28] ages all those Heroes of Faith died and
[1:02:30] they went into this holding place this
[1:02:33] paradise place and the devil felt pretty
[1:02:35] comfortable because he had the keys
[1:02:39] to death and health
[1:02:40] so he was comfortable that it will all
[1:02:42] come in there he did not expect that he
[1:02:45] was going to lose control over that
[1:02:46] jurisdiction because he had the keys to
[1:02:48] death and hell but when Jesus came he
[1:02:50] said I come in to do a secret work a
[1:02:53] secret mission and the only way I could
[1:02:55] get access to those who have fallen
[1:02:57] before I have to go to the same way the
[1:02:59] devil think I should go
[1:03:02] so Jesus was looking at death one way
[1:03:05] and the devil looking at death another
[1:03:07] way Satan is thinking that if Jesus died
[1:03:10] he will go and get locked up just like
[1:03:11] Joseph locked up just like Isaiah locked
[1:03:14] up just like Moses it is he had an
[1:03:17] expectation of what was going to happen
[1:03:19] but Jesus had a unexpected
[1:03:22] or you don't hear me this morning he's a
[1:03:24] god of the unexpected so he is walking
[1:03:27] to Calvary and the devil is saying look
[1:03:29] at him oh gosh account unknown to this
[1:03:31] Cross of Calvary I'm counting down to
[1:03:34] Jesus dying and God is saying I'm
[1:03:36] counting down to Jesus dying oh you
[1:03:38] don't hear me this morning when you go
[1:03:39] to your trial the devil ticket is going
[1:03:41] to finish you and God is saying
[1:03:43] accounting unto your child because it's
[1:03:44] going to get you stronger and the same
[1:03:47] trap the devil think he has for you is
[1:03:49] the same thing God wants to use for you
[1:03:50] oh come on now you don't hear me this
[1:03:53] morning so the same Cross of Calvary
[1:03:55] Satan is looking at this cross and he's
[1:03:58] happy you know
[1:04:00] in every age when the devil did
[1:04:02] something fingers going to win he
[1:04:04] thought the plan was going to work out
[1:04:05] you know I want you to catch this for a
[1:04:07] minute Satan taught every plan he had
[1:04:09] was going to work out he's telling me
[1:04:11] Troy Daniel and Alliance then and right
[1:04:13] there in the Lion's Den the god of the
[1:04:16] unexpected stepped into the lion's den
[1:04:18] you don't you don't hear me this morning
[1:04:20] the God will be unexpected in an
[1:04:23] unexpected way in an unexpected place at
[1:04:26] the unexpected time and the lion say but
[1:04:28] wait a minute it's an unexpected man boy
[1:04:30] this man different I can't eat this man
[1:04:32] because it's an unexpected thing inside
[1:04:34] of this man those Hebrew boys they were
[1:04:37] walking they didn't know how God was
[1:04:39] going to do it but they knew they were
[1:04:41] servingly God of the unexpected they
[1:04:43] didn't know when it's going to deliver
[1:04:44] they were comfortable to die but the god
[1:04:47] of the unexpected came in an unexpected
[1:04:51] place at an unexpected time in an
[1:04:54] unexpected way and the god of the
[1:04:56] unexpected stood there with them in the
[1:04:58] fiery furnace and they were not burned
[1:05:01] he loves to do the unexpected he loves
[1:05:04] to disrupt plans and programs he loves
[1:05:06] to change things around he loves to do
[1:05:09] what listen you should have been dead
[1:05:11] already but the god of the unexpected
[1:05:14] has made a way for you to be here listen
[1:05:17] the devil didn't expect you to be here
[1:05:19] this morning he thought that you were
[1:05:21] going to sit down at home and say this
[1:05:23] is just another day but the god of the
[1:05:25] unexpected he made a way to create an
[1:05:28] unexpected outcome yes you're gonna get
[1:05:30] the Holy Ghost we read the scripture a
[1:05:33] royal priesthood a chosen generation A
[1:05:36] peculiar people which the Bible says
[1:05:39] which in times past were not a people in
[1:05:42] other people oh you don't hear me in the
[1:05:44] time passed you would not have been
[1:05:46] considered but God had to do the
[1:05:48] unexpected and get a group of people to
[1:05:52] finish this great work that the devil
[1:05:54] will not expect oh you don't hear me
[1:05:56] this morning he had to find people who
[1:05:59] went through all kind of situations went
[1:06:01] through drugs went through last step
[1:06:03] went through pornography went to the
[1:06:05] Baptist Church went to the Methodist

[1:06:12] a kind of situation grew up in message
[1:06:15] grew up outside of the message or kind
[1:06:18] of situation but the god of the
[1:06:20] unexpected said I'm gonna find a way an
[1:06:23] unexpected way maybe your old-fashioned
[1:06:25] service maybe on a street corner maybe
[1:06:28] somebody gonna invite you maybe you're

[1:06:32] hear a tape maybe somebody's gonna
[1:06:34] invite you to church it's gonna be an
[1:06:36] unexpected way in an unexpected service
[1:06:39] at an unexpected time when you think
[1:06:42] it's just a normal service it's an
[1:06:44] unexpected day an unexpected time this
[1:06:48] is not just a normal Easter Service no
[1:06:50] it's an unexpected day unexpected time
[1:06:53] unexpected way
[1:06:55] [Applause]
[1:07:02] they thought it was just a normal day
[1:07:05] but that Easter morning they could not
[1:07:07] have expected what was happening they
[1:07:10] could not have expected that he was not
[1:07:12] there in the Tomb they went there to
[1:07:13] take care of the body and when they got
[1:07:15] there he was not there he was not there
[1:07:17] they expected him to be there but he was
[1:07:21] not there the devil expected you to be
[1:07:23] dead
[1:07:24] [Applause]
[1:07:27] but the god of the unexpected he is very
[1:07:30] much alive and the god of the unexpected
[1:07:32] said listen because I live
[1:07:36] you are gonna live also and the same
[1:07:39] work that I do
[1:07:41] you see the devil didn't even expect you
[1:07:43] to be able to say it but the secret is
[1:07:45] the word is in the bride you know who
[1:07:47] you are you know what you're called to
[1:07:49] do you know what you're born to do and
[1:07:51] listen when you're feeling sick and you
[1:07:54] worship God that's unexpected when you
[1:07:58] come to church and you have no money in
[1:08:00] your bank account that is unexpected
[1:08:02] when the devil thinks that it was a sit
[1:08:05] down dead in the church and you get up
[1:08:07] and you stand up and you move a little
[1:08:10] bit that's unexpected do something
[1:08:12] different this morning do the unexpected
[1:08:15] this morning if you never move your
[1:08:17] shoulder like this
[1:08:18] [Applause]
[1:08:21] or you don't hear me this morning
[1:08:24] audition make the Baptist shout they
[1:08:27] should make the evil come on now
[1:08:28] somebody help me I might preach on the
[1:08:31] black I don't know what's going to
[1:08:32] happen this morning but we're on an
[1:08:34] unexpected day unexpected way unexpected
[1:08:37] Place unexpected time
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:42] you may be seated
[1:08:43] [Music]
[1:08:45] [Applause]
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:52] [Applause]
[1:08:57] before Saul became Paul nobody would
[1:09:00] have expected Brotherhood that this
[1:09:02] would be the messenger for the church
[1:09:04] each he was there when Stephen was
[1:09:07] stoned he was there persecuting the
[1:09:09] Brethren but one day this man called
[1:09:12] Saul was on his road to Damascus and an
[1:09:15] unexpected thing happened it was an
[1:09:17] unexpected way in an unexpected place on
[1:09:20] an unexpected time and yet an unexpected
[1:09:23] visitor he wasn't even looking for Jesus
[1:09:26] he wasn't planning to see Jesus he
[1:09:28] didn't expect to see Jesus but on the
[1:09:31] road to Damascus on the road to Damascus
[1:09:34] an unexpected day in unexpected way in
[1:09:38] an unexpected place
[1:09:42] the unexpected God met a man who had no
[1:09:46] expectation oh God help me this morning
[1:09:48] this would make the most broken person
[1:09:51] shout because you can come with no
[1:09:53] expectation and the god of on the acts
[1:09:56] unexpected could meet you
[1:09:58] [Applause]
[1:09:59] [Music]
[1:10:03] [Applause]
[1:10:05] you have to forgive me this morning
[1:10:11] and Saul was no fool
[1:10:13] he said Jesus
[1:10:15] he said who are you Lord I'm Jesus who
[1:10:17] you persecute
[1:10:20] and God sent this man to get prayed for
[1:10:24] but a punch I want you to imagine the
[1:10:25] next Sunday service when them brothers
[1:10:27] see the man who was now saw no call Paul
[1:10:31] they didn't expect to see him in church
[1:10:35] but it was an unexpected service
[1:10:37] and Paul came in an unexpected way
[1:10:39] because you're still an unexpected God
[1:10:41] and although they might have had
[1:10:42] problems with Paul
[1:10:46] they have to take note
[1:10:48] that the God will be unexpected had
[1:10:50] taken somebody their rule out
[1:10:52] somebody that counted out I was going to
[1:10:55] find a way to use him and in the same
[1:10:57] way God could take somebody who is
[1:10:59] unexpected there's a preacher inside of
[1:11:01] here who we don't know there's a
[1:11:03] prophetess inside of here who we don't
[1:11:04] know there's somebody inside of here who
[1:11:06] God gonna use that we don't even know
[1:11:08] about it yet because that's how God
[1:11:10] loves operate there's some ways about to
[1:11:12] be healed in this service that we don't
[1:11:13] know about it yet we're going to hear
[1:11:15] about it as another praise because I
[1:11:16] have to believe that it got to be
[1:11:18] unexpected will keep doing unexpected
[1:11:20] things it's one thing about him we know
[1:11:22] for sure he doesn't change and if he has
[1:11:25] always operated in an unexpected way we
[1:11:27] could expect him to do it again and
[1:11:29] again and again and again
[1:11:37] you remember the Stephen Paul amen
[1:11:39] sister Jewel
[1:11:44] what we know for sure he do it again we
[1:11:46] don't know how
[1:11:47] because he always had unexpected way
[1:11:50] but we know it's going to happen
[1:11:52] how he's going to do is going to be
[1:11:53] unexpected
[1:11:57] he could openly Red Sea
[1:11:59] he could walk on the water
[1:12:01] which one you want him to do he could do
[1:12:03] anyone but if you need to get to you he
[1:12:05] get to you whether you walk on water
[1:12:06] openly Red Sea he could do it he could
[1:12:08] build a boat like Noah he could do what
[1:12:10] he wants to do unexpected way
[1:12:13] unexpected things unexpected places it
[1:12:16] could be in your you could be driving on
[1:12:17] the car on your way to work next week
[1:12:19] and then all of a sudden unexpected
[1:12:21] place
[1:12:24] [Applause]
[1:12:25] Paul and Silas in prison
[1:12:30] it is expected that when you're in
[1:12:32] prison
[1:12:34] you feel down you feel depressed you'll
[1:12:36] abandon you feel alone but at the
[1:12:39] Midnight Hour
[1:12:40] unexpected time
[1:12:43] an unexpected place
[1:12:45] this has to do an unexpected thing that
[1:12:48] in the midst of the child has started to
[1:12:51] get started to do the unexpected and
[1:12:55] when you do the unexpected the god of
[1:12:57] the unexpected begins to respond to you
[1:13:00] doing the unexpected
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:05] and the prison doors start to open up
[1:13:08] and whenever the prison so
[1:13:10] you see God here he unexpectedly
[1:13:13] sleeping
[1:13:17] every door open it was so powerful that
[1:13:19] when they got back to the Believers the
[1:13:21] Believers didn't even expect them
[1:13:24] they said it had to be their ghosts
[1:13:26] because of the unexpected
[1:13:29] Hallelujah you know what this means we
[1:13:31] have to lift your expectation
[1:13:34] our expectations are too low we have to
[1:13:37] lift and it's harder no because God has
[1:13:39] been so high
[1:13:43] Hallelujah somebody gives the Lord a
[1:13:45] shout out praise
[1:13:49] [Applause]
[1:13:57] when Jesus came he brought the
[1:13:58] unexpected message
[1:14:01] he said you have heard it before
[1:14:05] but I say unto you
[1:14:09] love your enemies
[1:14:13] do good at the damn that curse you
[1:14:15] offend you hurt you
[1:14:20] they say what can I preach against this
[1:14:21] is not what we expected
[1:14:24] Jesus started his preaching in an
[1:14:25] unexpected way he said his Spirit of the
[1:14:27] Lord is upon me for here that part they
[1:14:30] could have expected it
[1:14:33] because he wasn't the first person to
[1:14:35] find where it was written
[1:14:37] but when he finished reading he did the
[1:14:39] unexpected
[1:14:40] he said this day
[1:14:43] this scripture
[1:14:45] is fulfilled that was unexpected
[1:15:05] do you know any devil has an expectation
[1:15:06] of you
[1:15:11] School teachers have expedition of their
[1:15:13] students
[1:15:15] when people write the report they say
[1:15:17] when you finish school likely to succeed
[1:15:19] that's an expectation
[1:15:22] and somebody right I don't even know
[1:15:28] you have most likely to succeed most
[1:15:30] likely to achieve this yeah somebody say
[1:15:32] I don't even know now when you you don't
[1:15:34] even know what to expect
[1:15:36] for some of you right if they do get
[1:15:38] help trouble
[1:15:40] somebody has seen him at a young age
[1:15:42] trouble
[1:15:46] there's something about defying
[1:15:48] expectation
[1:15:50] to be successful in business you need to
[1:15:52] be able to find a way to do the
[1:15:54] unexpected
[1:15:57] to win a war
[1:15:59] you have to study and find a way to do
[1:16:02] the unexpected friends if you're
[1:16:04] fighting a war and every time you try to
[1:16:06] attack
[1:16:07] the enemy expecting you You're Gonna
[1:16:09] Lose You Know
[1:16:10] and that is scriptural no because
[1:16:12] remember when Elisha was here
[1:16:14] and the king of Syria and then was
[1:16:16] trying to to fight something and they
[1:16:17] say but wait a minute every time you try
[1:16:19] to attack teacher in Israel and then
[1:16:20] we're losing
[1:16:21] as if they're reading our plans
[1:16:24] because Elisha was seeing what's going
[1:16:26] on before it happened
[1:16:27] so they couldn't outsmart they couldn't
[1:16:29] plan because in while in a secret
[1:16:32] chamber God given the prophet of God in
[1:16:35] sight into what's happening
[1:16:44] so in our natural lives you have to find
[1:16:45] a way to do the unexpected
[1:16:50] no we're not saying this for points huh
[1:16:54] but Friday morning I get up pretty early
[1:16:57] and I decided to go and fry some eggs
[1:17:00] and things
[1:17:02] before my wife wake up
[1:17:04] I'd only say I do do it often
[1:17:07] but it was unexpected
[1:17:15] fries I'm such a dissenting
[1:17:19] and it was unexpected
[1:17:23] what I did not expect
[1:17:25] was when she saw that she asked me if I
[1:17:26] wanted to cook for the brunch
[1:17:30] now that was unexpected
[1:17:35] but the point I want to make is this if
[1:17:36] you want your marriage to be successful
[1:17:40] yeah correct right on this road
[1:17:42] or should I hit a reverse
[1:17:46] if you want your marriage but you have
[1:17:48] to find ways to do the unexpected
[1:17:52] one Valentine's and I'll tell you which
[1:17:53] one I went and buy some things
[1:17:59] and my wife said to me well I appreciate
[1:18:01] the robot I feel they do it with like
[1:18:03] form like you just do it
[1:18:11] won't tell you
[1:18:13] the one you're not preach a week or so
[1:18:15] but we're finding a soft answer
[1:18:20] but the issue was it I didn't go
[1:18:22] unexpected enough
[1:18:28] so it was unexpected but it wasn't high
[1:18:30] on the unexpected scale
[1:18:33] because it more unexpected it is you
[1:18:35] created the experience of I can't even
[1:18:37] believe you do that boy
[1:18:40] because to be truly unexpected you have
[1:18:42] to put thought and effort on different
[1:18:43] things into it
[1:18:46] and I want you to understand that the
[1:18:48] reality is this life God interrupts Our
[1:18:53] Lives because somehow our lives just get
[1:18:55] too predictable
[1:18:59] they say in terms of security and
[1:19:01] defense they say a certain drive home
[1:19:03] the same exact way all the time
[1:19:05] you ever hear that before
[1:19:08] you have the exact pattern all the time
[1:19:10] that is a problem
[1:19:11] you have to change it up a little bit in
[1:19:13] other words when you set a duty
[1:19:15] unexpected because I want you to
[1:19:16] appreciate where I'm going with this the
[1:19:18] devil has a expectation of how you're
[1:19:20] going to operate
[1:19:23] I want you to honor any Devil Knows Your
[1:19:25] timetable and your schedule
[1:19:29] when you wake up he takes note
[1:19:32] When you pray he takes note I wonder if
[1:19:34] he has any notes this morning of your
[1:19:36] prayer
[1:19:39] because if currently I'm not rebuking
[1:19:41] here
[1:19:42] you have much notes on your prayer life
[1:19:43] then I want you to start to do the
[1:19:45] unexpected
[1:19:46] and let it devil say hold on hold on
[1:19:48] love me or something something changed
[1:19:49] so never gone away
[1:19:51] because normally I was right in this
[1:19:52] spot he gets up and he go to Facebook
[1:19:54] and I get together and checking news and
[1:19:56] getting coffee and the last human thing
[1:19:58] I already had known reason to write pray
[1:20:00] any schedule
[1:20:02] but all of a sudden I'm writing
[1:20:04] something unexpected
[1:20:06] and when you break pattern the devil
[1:20:08] doesn't know what to do
[1:20:09] because that's where you can live a life
[1:20:11] by the brown City never don't know what
[1:20:12] to do with you because he tried every
[1:20:14] day he writes I didn't get frustrated I
[1:20:15] can't write no more because he praying
[1:20:17] here he prayed here I look for him here
[1:20:19] he praying I thought he's got me on
[1:20:21] Facebook hell here we praying I Tony is
[1:20:23] going to get back to the white boy
[1:20:24] praying he shouldn't be there and doing
[1:20:26] something in the job but somehow he
[1:20:27] listened that tape when he's supposed to
[1:20:29] be frustrated he's smiling
[1:20:34] expected
[1:20:42] do you realize that when Jesus came his
[1:20:44] life was just an unexpected life
[1:20:48] he was just breaking the patterns
[1:20:51] when nobody thought think it happened
[1:20:55] somebody he messed up that
[1:20:59] he breaks tradition
[1:21:01] Ally traditionals
[1:21:04] he said only have this thing and and
[1:21:05] that's why I realized why but I'm preach
[1:21:07] against organized religion so much
[1:21:10] because when you organize things there's
[1:21:12] no spirit in there
[1:21:14] but when he could be free to move it in
[1:21:16] spirit and he could sing a song you
[1:21:18] could do an instrumental you could you
[1:21:20] could see read a poem you could you
[1:21:22] could you could write on your car I love
[1:21:24] Jesus
[1:21:26] you just had to do things you ever see a
[1:21:28] cafe game out and that's why I want to
[1:21:29] be no Lord help me Lord I don't want my
[1:21:31] wife I want God I would only devil to
[1:21:33] bring him out
[1:21:37] because I want to do the unexpected
[1:21:40] you know how much the devil gets upset
[1:21:42] when you're supposed to be sad and you
[1:21:44] say Lord I will praise you
[1:21:48] the whole challenge to job was to curse
[1:21:51] God and die
[1:21:53] and even his wife
[1:21:55] was leaning to that expectation she said
[1:21:57] why you don't do it
[1:22:01] because everything was looking like the
[1:22:03] formula was equal because going on there
[1:22:04] you know you lose this you lose this you
[1:22:06] lose this you lose this the equality was
[1:22:09] just waiting to write it out you know
[1:22:10] are we still waiting
[1:22:13] and then job daddy unexpected
[1:22:16] so these skin worms destroy my body
[1:22:19] yet in my flesh I will see God
[1:22:22] the Lord Give the Lord take away blessed
[1:22:25] be the name of the Lord
[1:22:27] when job taught he could get upset he's
[1:22:30] something else the unexpected came over
[1:22:32] him and he began to Worship in the midst
[1:22:34] of the situation
[1:22:36] and that's how you overcame
[1:22:38] that's why the key to your overcoming is
[1:22:40] your worship the kids are overcoming is
[1:22:42] your prayers the key to your overcoming
[1:22:44] as you shouting and jumping and and
[1:22:46] being happy all the time and being in an
[1:22:48] atmosphere because God know you love him
[1:22:50] he loves when they talk about him he
[1:22:52] loves any Fellowship about him he loved
[1:22:54] on your praise him he loves when you
[1:22:55] worship Him He loves when he acknowledge
[1:22:57] Him
[1:23:04] for you
[1:23:07] oh can the church say Amen many many men
[1:23:12] from the message a door inside the door
[1:23:15] brother Branham said I'm not going to be
[1:23:16] too much longer with you but you know
[1:23:18] God is unusual
[1:23:21] God does things in an unusual way
[1:23:24] at an unusual time in an unusual Place
[1:23:27] sometimes the unusual people God is
[1:23:30] unusual he does the unexpected many
[1:23:32] times
[1:23:33] oh Amber Ibraham said in the
[1:23:35] unchangeable god working in an
[1:23:37] unexpectable way speaking about how
[1:23:39] Jesus came into Jerusalem he says
[1:23:41] scriptures just fulfill of Us coming the
[1:23:43] way he will come but they fail to see it
[1:23:45] see he did the Messianic sign prove that
[1:23:48] he was Messiah and they rejected it
[1:23:51] because he came in an unexpected way to
[1:23:53] them he was too humble
[1:23:56] he was too lowly he was too meek
[1:23:59] Hallelujah was it a king to lead them
[1:24:01] out from under the Romans but he said my
[1:24:03] kingdom is out of this world and I come
[1:24:06] into fight the political around when I
[1:24:07] come and fight the government no no no I
[1:24:09] come in for the kingdom of the most high
[1:24:11] the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand the
[1:24:14] kingdom of the Lord is at hand that's
[1:24:15] what I've come for not the kingdom of
[1:24:17] this world the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:24:19] hand and I'm looking for citizens of
[1:24:21] that Kingdom who will be a royal
[1:24:23] priesthood who will be a holy nation who
[1:24:26] will be a peculiar people who will
[1:24:28] separate themselves from all kind of
[1:24:29] uncleanness who will separate themselves
[1:24:31] from filthiness who will separate
[1:24:33] themselves from all these things of the
[1:24:35] world that's who I'm coming for people
[1:24:37] who know there's more to life than money
[1:24:39] more to life than business more to life
[1:24:42] than family More Alive than
[1:24:46] that the doctor can only help you so
[1:24:48] much but the great physician can help
[1:24:49] you all the way that there's a life
[1:24:51] beyond this life that you can put on
[1:24:53] this body
[1:24:55] but there's another one waiting
[1:24:56] somewhere
[1:24:57] and he can give you access to that new
[1:24:59] body he gave you access a new work a new
[1:25:01] talk a new life a new experience a new
[1:25:05] Joy a new peace a new victory A New Hope
[1:25:09] a new expectation oh Hallelujah
[1:25:11] somebody's saving
[1:25:15] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:25:18] oh Hallelujah God chooses the unexpected
[1:25:22] he took a prostitute called Rahab and he
[1:25:25] used the unexpected oh come on somebody
[1:25:27] help me when Samson was on the earth
[1:25:29] they took and they tried to block him up
[1:25:32] in the gate and the expectation was that
[1:25:34] he gave they put brother Stephen was
[1:25:35] going to be enough to contain him and
[1:25:37] then the god of the unexpected Came Upon
[1:25:40] This Man Called Samson and he moved the
[1:25:42] whole gate well that was that that was
[1:25:44] unexpected they sent us what three
[1:25:46] thousand men brother punch to Corner
[1:25:48] Samson every time they send men to
[1:25:50] Corner somebody before they got them
[1:25:52] they send men with shields and Spares
[1:25:54] and helmets and weapons to get one man
[1:25:56] with a Sheen and when they're surrounded
[1:25:58] as one man the unexpected came over
[1:26:00] Samson and Samson did the unexpected
[1:26:03] because he was working with the god of
[1:26:04] the unexpected and in an unexpected way
[1:26:07] on an unexpected day in unexpected time
[1:26:10] he cleaned up 3 000 men but Abraham said
[1:26:13] they were dead brass helmets and with
[1:26:15] the job one of our donkey he did the
[1:26:17] unexpected
[1:26:19] should have crumbled into pieces but
[1:26:21] when you take
[1:26:24] natural things and put it into the hands
[1:26:26] of the god of the unexpected then
[1:26:28] unexpected things begin to happen and
[1:26:31] that Jawbone became a powerful weapon a
[1:26:34] weapon of mass destruction it was one
[1:26:36] man on a Jawbone this is a story you
[1:26:38] know you hear a news reporter in an
[1:26:40] unlikely turn of events
[1:26:45] in an unlikely to the event you know you
[1:26:47] can read the whole Bible like that
[1:26:49] Joshua fighting his battle sun going
[1:26:52] down it gets in too dark and in an
[1:26:54] unlikely to Live Events Joshua Spin and
[1:26:57] say a son stand still and the god of the
[1:26:59] unexpected did an unexpected thing this
[1:27:02] had never happened before I want you to
[1:27:04] appreciate how much of the Bible never
[1:27:07] happened before
[1:27:09] Joshua didn't have anybody to reference
[1:27:12] that they did that before but the god of
[1:27:14] the unexpected loves to do things that
[1:27:16] were never done before and set a new
[1:27:19] president break a new record oh come on
[1:27:21] now that's what makes Easter so powerful
[1:27:24] you know
[1:27:27] because when Jesus died in the ground
[1:27:32] did not expect
[1:27:34] you know the undo button when you do
[1:27:36] something I never undo button the devil
[1:27:38] told her when Jesus died that was it you
[1:27:40] know
[1:27:42] you call your car undo it
[1:27:45] and when Jesus died
[1:27:47] before the undo button because
[1:27:51] when Jesus died by a punch not only the
[1:27:54] undo but may say no but he went down
[1:27:56] into hell
[1:27:59] and the devil who was celebrating didn't
[1:28:01] expect anybody else in the party because
[1:28:03] he had everybody locked up he said
[1:28:07] who knocking on the door then he said
[1:28:09] the door kick open
[1:28:10] and see a man with no spare no shield no

[1:30:27] expected so you don't know what to do he
[1:30:31] foreign
[1:30:32] if you want to see a picture of the

[1:30:53] of trials in the midst of problems in
[1:30:55] the midst of situations you don't hear
[1:30:57] me this morning
[1:31:02] Hallelujah
[1:31:04] Hallelujah
[1:31:06] Hallelujah the devil knew that Jesus had
[1:31:09] power over sickness this was a new to
[1:31:12] the devil
[1:31:14] before Jesus came nobody Castle there
[1:31:16] was no
[1:31:17] [Music]
[1:31:19] read the Bible before Jesus came nobody
[1:31:21] Castle Devils the most they did was when
[1:31:24] David was there driving Devils by his
[1:31:27] music but casting them out and saying
[1:31:30] come out devil this was the first time
[1:31:32] the devil had people coming back
[1:31:41] had sent some time ago somebody on Earth
[1:31:44] sent me back
[1:31:47] what you mean send me back well I don't
[1:31:49] know is there somebody up there who's
[1:31:50] sending people back
[1:31:55] what do you mean send back who who up
[1:31:57] there I don't know all I know I was
[1:31:59] there one day and then I wasn't because
[1:32:01] he said get out and I have nowhere to go
[1:32:03] so I'll come back
[1:32:05] [Applause]
[1:32:11] because the Devil Himself didn't know
[1:32:14] when the devil measure you say if thou B
[1:32:17] he did really read it if don't be trying
[1:32:19] to figure you out boy

[1:32:23] something about you if don't be the Son
[1:32:26] of God and Jesus Martin or not

[1:32:32] every word
[1:32:33] the devil looking back straight answer
[1:32:35] you know
[1:32:37] and this will confuse the devil because
[1:32:38] you're here this morning and you are
[1:32:39] giving my answer
[1:32:42] the kind of mistakes you make you
[1:32:49] if don't be because you know we do last

[1:33:06] morning
[1:33:08] [Applause]
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:11] so I wanted a picture with a huge Jesus
[1:33:13] down there in hell and then they will
[1:33:15] get kicked out to him that is him
[1:33:20] telling him or the devil you see he was
[1:33:22] asking me who sent me back is he
[1:33:27] and then they will say well we you
[1:33:29] imagine you ever see a situation where
[1:33:31] you know this is a big gangster and the
[1:33:32] big answer behind everybody else and you
[1:33:34] see what attack them now
[1:33:36] anybody God save all night out of it

[1:33:48] the Next Room I go and put somebody to
[1:33:49] eat yes
[1:33:50] to the devil dear
[1:33:52] nobody guys know and Jesus just woke up
[1:33:55] and grab the keys
[1:33:58] the keys are dead the keys are hell that
[1:34:00] is the keys to the devil own world he
[1:34:02] take it
[1:34:04] you know how embarrassing that is
[1:34:07] to be in your house and I walk into your
[1:34:09] house and take your keys to your house
[1:34:13] so I could walk in anytime walk out
[1:34:16] anytime I could walk in this morning and
[1:34:19] take something out this morning so when

[1:34:23] hell he gave away literally oh you don't
[1:34:26] hear me this morning we can walk in
[1:34:28] anytime and grab anybody out from the
[1:34:32] clutches of the devil that's why there's
[1:34:34] power in the church over sickness over
[1:34:38] diseases over doubt overlust over fear
[1:34:42] over unclean spirits I don't care what
[1:34:44] Spirit you came and hear this with we
[1:34:47] have the keys the keys of power
[1:34:51] you could go free if you want to go free
[1:34:53] you can go free if you want to go free
[1:34:55] you can go free if you want to go free
[1:34:58] you have to forgive me
[1:35:00] [Applause]
[1:35:14] and God only keys for himself you know
[1:35:17] you don't need the keys to himself the
[1:35:19] keys is for man the keys for his sons he
[1:35:22] went Peter got a revelation he said Upon
[1:35:24] This Rock I will build my church and the
[1:35:26] Gates of Hell will not Prevail and unto
[1:35:28] you I give you the keys whatever you
[1:35:30] buying on Earth I will honor it and
[1:35:33] buying it in heaven and whatever you
[1:35:35] lose on Earth I will honor it and lose
[1:35:37] it in heaven all you have to do is speak
[1:35:39] so you want to go free this morning you
[1:35:41] are free
[1:35:43] and we bind every Spirit of lust every
[1:35:46] Spirit of lion every Spirit of black
[1:35:49] biting every Spirit of a gossip every
[1:35:52] Spirit of fornication every Spirit of
[1:35:54] adultery every Spirit of Doubt
[1:35:56] depression fear sickness disease
[1:35:59] whatever it is we come against it with
[1:36:02] the same power that was released on
[1:36:04] Resurrection Sunday morning
[1:36:09] [Applause]
[1:36:10] I'm almost done
[1:36:12] [Applause]
[1:36:22] to God
[1:36:23] of the unexpected
[1:36:29] but that was a secret mission
[1:36:31] because the whole purpose
[1:36:33] the whole plan was not for Jesus to come
[1:36:36] and do these things
[1:36:37] the whole Ministry the whole purpose the
[1:36:40] whole objective was about getting this
[1:36:43] power into the hands of a people
[1:36:47] it was about the transfer of power
[1:36:53] the first transfer didn't work
[1:36:58] because Adam fell
[1:37:00] and It reversed the transfer
[1:37:03] you know you do online transfer to
[1:37:05] somebody anything the money come back
[1:37:07] so any devil taught you as one gate
[1:37:10] he never had to spend anything you know
[1:37:13] spendingly not his money
[1:37:18] the money went back into the bank
[1:37:20] account
[1:37:21] after the original owner
[1:37:23] charges reversed
[1:37:25] and over all of the ages all God could
[1:37:27] do is a little transfer
[1:37:31] a temporary transfer
[1:37:33] somebody just keep them going until he
[1:37:35] finds somebody he could transfer the
[1:37:37] whole thing to
[1:37:42] so that's why Samson brother and we
[1:37:44] could have a little he had a little
[1:37:45] transfer
[1:37:46] Joshua Earl transfer he's like God
[1:37:49] getting my little credit card with a
[1:37:50] limit
[1:37:53] they could spend a certain amount
[1:37:55] but God not in the limited business
[1:37:58] you know God credit card have no limit
[1:38:01] and in this age you're giving you a card
[1:38:03] with no limit yeah
[1:38:04] in their age was card with limits but in
[1:38:07] this edges have god with no limit
[1:38:11] you know
[1:38:13] maybe nobody experienced it maybe went
[1:38:15] to pave us another card and it ain't
[1:38:16] hoping and going through
[1:38:19] maybe it's not anybody here went through
[1:38:20] that maybe nobody
[1:38:23] said why are you looking like you're so
[1:38:25] Italian
[1:38:26] hoping this thing just
[1:38:29] and then when it goes through it's like
[1:38:31] yes Lord
[1:38:38] but if I say right now we lay hands on
[1:38:39] your sick he said but when that time
[1:38:41] comes and they have the unlimited card
[1:38:43] you say you command the devil so go
[1:38:49] [Music]
[1:38:49] [Applause]
[1:38:52] you see right now you're saying Jesus
[1:38:54] name but when that I come you speak
[1:38:56] because it'll be Flesh of My Flesh born
[1:38:58] of my bone to a one
[1:39:02] I am my father are one you have to say
[1:39:04] in Jesus name because that new name will
[1:39:06] be a new locked up you dare speak
[1:39:11] so throughout all the ages God handed
[1:39:14] out cards
[1:39:16] with limits
[1:39:18] but when Jesus came all I was in God
[1:39:24] he has a pattern over a point he said oh
[1:39:26] that was in God
[1:39:27] he poured it into Christ
[1:39:29] [Applause]
[1:39:30] and the first unlimited credit cards had
[1:39:32] to walk around
[1:39:35] healing
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:37] Deliverance
[1:39:42] one time Jesus preaching neighbors like
[1:39:44] today and and and and he said oh God he
[1:39:46] saves going so good we go in a while
[1:39:50] I said before that I wasn't going to be
[1:39:52] too long well that just changed
[1:39:55] he said to go for a while
[1:39:57] people
[1:40:03] you say whatever anything
[1:40:07] they said I'm a little boy here like I
[1:40:09] don't even
[1:40:10] Mommy
[1:40:13] he'd have five love and two fishes
[1:40:16] one of the Deacons
[1:40:19] are not picking anything
[1:40:23] what are these among so many
[1:40:27] I just said bring it
[1:40:30] and he pulled all the unlimited card
[1:40:34] and he blessed it and you know you have
[1:40:37] the arm you know you had the the tap
[1:40:38] thing now
[1:40:45] and when you press it but you just tap
[1:40:47] that card

[1:43:01] save the whole nation
[1:43:03] [Applause]
[1:43:07] [Music]
[1:43:09] trying to find a place to close out
[1:43:11] but unexpected people
[1:43:13] in an unexpected way
[1:43:15] Abraham's testimony was unexpected
[1:43:19] and throughout scripture but ibraham's
[1:43:21] life was a life of unexpected
[1:43:29] if you go through some possibility you
[1:43:31] have to wonder
[1:43:33] how a man of God to reach so depressed
[1:43:36] till he came to the point he wanted to
[1:43:37] kill his own self
[1:43:41] but when he tried he quoted the
[1:43:43] unexpected he said put a gun to my head
[1:43:45] foreign
[1:43:54] because nothing
[1:43:56] could ever stop the plan of God
[1:43:59] nothing
[1:44:01] could stop the plan of God the doctors
[1:44:04] report
[1:44:05] of God prison can't stop the plan Accord
[1:44:08] money or no money cast out the plan of
[1:44:11] God sickness cannot stop the plan of God
[1:44:14] depression cannot stop the plan of God
[1:44:17] the children giving all the trouble in
[1:44:20] the world cannot stop the power of God
[1:44:22] I don't care they're drunk this morning
[1:44:24] cannot stop the plan of God I don't care
[1:44:26] if they in sin they cannot stop the plan
[1:44:28] of God I don't care if they reject God
[1:44:31] it cannot stop the plan of God
[1:44:34] [Applause]
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:44] I am putting it to you this morning that
[1:44:47] when Jesus stood at the grave of Lazarus
[1:44:49] if a man who was dead
[1:44:52] could have no control he had nothing to
[1:44:54] say about punch when Jesus got there
[1:44:55] four days later he said roll already
[1:44:58] Stone
[1:44:59] nobody who was there had an expectation
[1:45:02] what is going to happen next least of
[1:45:04] all Lazarus
[1:45:08] because I shall understand what Lazarus
[1:45:10] went through you know
[1:45:12] it's one thing will punch with the
[1:45:13] people who was there seriously you know
[1:45:14] because Lazarus who taught but is it for
[1:45:16] me
[1:45:19] Brethren C on the other side yes
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:24] all these songs and everything but wait
[1:45:27] a minute what I feel anyway
[1:45:30] I'm feeling something
[1:45:34] I want you to process it in a Lazarus
[1:45:36] there wrapped up
[1:45:38] trying to open his eyes instead of a
[1:45:40] tomb and I preachers years ago he can't
[1:45:42] even walk properly because he tied up
[1:45:45] and Lazarus come out there trying to
[1:45:46] figure out what's going on
[1:45:53] and Jesus said lose him and let him go
[1:45:58] Lazarus himself had no power to control
[1:46:01] him even coming back
[1:46:03] because the voice of the Resurrection
[1:46:09] had already spoken to him and when the
[1:46:11] voice of the Resurrection speaks undo it
[1:46:15] it's like when the word is spoken upon
[1:46:17] your life you can't undo it when the
[1:46:19] blessing is spoken about you you can't
[1:46:21] undo it nothing you could do could
[1:46:23] change your word or prophecy about your
[1:46:25] life because having an outer pathway but
[1:46:27] this word
[1:46:28] could never pass away and it's like an
[1:46:31] arrow that is shot from the ball
[1:46:33] you could only stop it before the arago
[1:46:34] but when I will leave
[1:46:35] [Music]
[1:46:38] and every time you come to church
[1:46:39] brother popwell is arosen or being shot
[1:46:41] right now we're shooting arrows at your
[1:46:43] house
[1:46:46] right now we shoot Arrow this morning on
[1:46:48] your children right now and again hit
[1:46:50] all over and they're trying to
[1:46:51] understand why they're feeling convicted
[1:46:52] why they're feeling so why we're good
[1:46:54] something just pulling them that's the
[1:46:56] power of prayer it's arrows being shot
[1:46:58] this morning that's why you don't have
[1:47:00] to worry that's right off the Fret
[1:47:02] because God is in control of these
[1:47:03] things can the church say Amen Let me
[1:47:05] find a place to close are they enjoying
[1:47:07] the law this morning
[1:47:13] I'm trying to find a place that goes out
[1:47:15] the musicians could begin to get ready
[1:47:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:47:21] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:47:26] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:47:29] so we're preaching about this thing so
[1:47:31] death death was the great divider
[1:47:35] that was that thing that was stopping
[1:47:37] everybody from going Beyond a certain
[1:47:38] point it was understood that when he
[1:47:40] died I was able when Jesus came he'd use
[1:47:43] the same thing the devil thought was his
[1:47:45] tool to pull people to himself
[1:47:48] Jesus went to the same channel of death
[1:47:50] but he was the only one who walked
[1:47:52] through the road until macaron and
[1:47:53] walked back out
[1:48:01] and when he did that on Resurrection
[1:48:02] morning
[1:48:04] he opened the key to the transfer of
[1:48:07] power
[1:48:08] and the same law and the same principle
[1:48:10] that the devil thought he could have
[1:48:12] used is the same law and principle that
[1:48:15] God also used
[1:48:16] so God wrote a will
[1:48:20] and in that will he write certain things
[1:48:25] that would apply to certain people
[1:48:27] in my death
[1:48:29] I want to pass on some property
[1:48:31] when I die I passing on some
[1:48:34] accounts
[1:48:36] are passing on some power that is vested
[1:48:38] in me
[1:48:39] when I die I want to make sure that
[1:48:43] certain things that I have get passed on
[1:48:46] one of the things I want to pass on is
[1:48:47] this unlimited credit card
[1:48:50] and to my wife
[1:48:52] I leave my unlimited credit card
[1:48:55] whatever you're buying on earth born in
[1:48:57] heaven whatever you lose on Earth lose
[1:48:58] in heaven same words that I do you're
[1:49:00] gonna do also
[1:49:03] as my father sent me so saying that you
[1:49:06] always locked up and he will super
[1:49:08] Church super race you and your children
[1:49:10] so this will is Broad it's specific but
[1:49:13] it Broad
[1:49:15] so we'll be preaching the only world and
[1:49:17] any end will come but this is until you
[1:49:19] answer your children the damage are far
[1:49:21] off
[1:49:22] not just physically far far in mind fine
[1:49:24] Spirit they don't want to hear from you
[1:49:25] or from God but it's unto them as well
[1:49:28] locked up in this will but the only way
[1:49:30] this will could be read is if he died
[1:49:33] so when Jesus died
[1:49:36] the world went into effect immediately
[1:49:39] and what was not transferable before was
[1:49:42] now available to be transferred
[1:49:45] but this was so important to God's
[1:49:48] sister Marilyn that he says a need
[1:49:49] because every will has an executor
[1:49:52] and the role of the executor is to make
[1:49:55] sure that they obey what he will say is
[1:49:57] supposed to happen
[1:49:58] the job of the executor is to ensure
[1:50:01] that the property that's supposed to
[1:50:03] come to you comes to you
[1:50:06] [Music]
[1:50:07] and Jesus said listen I will send my own
[1:50:10] executor
[1:50:13] and when Jesus died
[1:50:15] rose again and left he come back as the
[1:50:19] executor
[1:50:20] in spirit form
[1:50:22] he said yes a little while and the world
[1:50:24] will see me no more but you are going to
[1:50:26] see me
[1:50:27] he said I'm going to be with you even in
[1:50:29] you
[1:50:29] so the executor who not only come to
[1:50:33] confirm and enforce what is in the will
[1:50:36] he also knows the will inside her
[1:50:38] because he want to rule you will
[1:50:40] and he said by these precious promises
[1:50:44] that's in this will you could become
[1:50:46] partakers
[1:50:47] of this divine nature
[1:50:49] this Divine walk this Divine Life this
[1:50:53] Divine experience and he put into this
[1:50:55] world what you read in First Peter but
[1:50:58] he our chosen generation
[1:51:00] a royal priesthood a holy nation A
[1:51:03] peculiar people that he should show for
[1:51:05] the Praises of him who had called you
[1:51:07] out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[1:51:09] in other words in that will he write
[1:51:11] some names brother Clarence or people
[1:51:13] who weren't even born yet
[1:51:16] who formally in darkness
[1:51:19] but by virtue of this will being
[1:51:21] enforced they can walk into a Marvelous
[1:51:23] Light
[1:51:24] which in time past were not a people
[1:51:27] so he slipped into that well and
[1:51:29] unexpected people
[1:51:30] who he would meet in an unexpected way
[1:51:33] the unexpected time and do an unexpected
[1:51:36] thing through an unexpected profit with
[1:51:39] an unexpected message in 2023 they could
[1:51:42] come and have an unexpected service to
[1:51:45] get a Holy Ghost
[1:51:47] that will be in their soul that will
[1:51:49] give them an unexpected life
[1:51:52] that will make them people who will
[1:51:54] forgive which will be unexpected make
[1:51:57] them a people who will love
[1:51:59] in a different kind of love that will be
[1:52:01] unexpected
[1:52:03] because there'll be no love except for a
[1:52:05] love inside a bride
[1:52:07] can the Church Say Amen oh
[1:52:11] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:52:17] so that is transfer of power
[1:52:20] could bring back Authority and control
[1:52:24] and jurisdiction
[1:52:26] because the job of the executor is not
[1:52:29] to do the work of what the will is
[1:52:31] supposed to enforce
[1:52:33] it's just to make sure the powers get
[1:52:36] transferred
[1:52:37] so the executing of the work itself
[1:52:40] belongs to those to whom the power have
[1:52:42] been transferred
[1:52:43] so the power of God is to enjoy power is
[1:52:47] transferred and once the power is
[1:52:48] transferred like if I train my daughter
[1:52:50] to run the business is to allow her to
[1:52:53] run the business so either to run the
[1:52:54] business that's what adoption is about
[1:52:56] so God can say your check is as good as
[1:52:58] the father's check I do expect to write
[1:53:01] all the checks if you hear and you can
[1:53:02] write check too
[1:53:04] you with me so the job of the Holy Ghost
[1:53:06] and the tutor and the training is to
[1:53:08] bring you to a state that you can also
[1:53:09] operate like the father to ease up the
[1:53:12] work and the father so the father can
[1:53:13] say this is my beloved Son and whom I'm
[1:53:15] well please so God's whole objective and
[1:53:17] Mission and purpose of this whole Plan
[1:53:19] of Redemption and this whole
[1:53:21] resurrection and this release of power
[1:53:23] is to put Power into your hands so you
[1:53:25] could go into your home and have
[1:53:27] dominion in your home and have dominion
[1:53:29] in your job and have dominion in your
[1:53:31] life and have dominion over your body
[1:53:33] and I'm dominion over your thoughts your
[1:53:36] actions
[1:53:39] worship
[1:53:41] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:53:45] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:53:49] Easter means Resurrection Easter means
[1:53:53] power Easter means freedom resurrection
[1:53:57] power means Redemption is now possible
[1:53:58] resurrection power means Pentecost is
[1:54:01] now possible Resurrection means a super
[1:54:03] church is now possible all these things
[1:54:06] were locked up in God's mind but they
[1:54:08] were not possible until the cross and
[1:54:11] that's why the preaching of the Cross
[1:54:12] and the way to the Cross is foolishness
[1:54:15] to the world but to us it's the gospel
[1:54:17] it's our joy it's our Bedrock I should
[1:54:20] have been dead but Jesus died in my
[1:54:23] place and he was able to raise from the
[1:54:25] dead so I can have a life in this gospel
[1:54:28] not a Life to Live how I want but the
[1:54:30] life in this word a life in this gospel
[1:54:33] a testimony on this Earth in 2023 that
[1:54:37] God is real and you can walk holy you
[1:54:40] can live holy you could live pure you
[1:54:42] could live under a higher law you can
[1:54:45] live under a higher law we could break
[1:54:47] records and do the unexpected it like
[1:54:50] that was done through all the ages oh my
[1:54:53] I'm closing out so when the doctor said
[1:54:56] there's no hope Easter says there's a
[1:54:58] higher law that there's resurrection
[1:55:00] power when the family thinks you cannot
[1:55:02] change Easter said is a higher law that
[1:55:05] the Holy Ghost is going to come upon you
[1:55:07] and you're gonna have a different walk
[1:55:08] you're gonna have a different talk
[1:55:10] you're gonna have a different way of
[1:55:11] living can the church say Amen come on
[1:55:13] keep on shouting we're getting ready to
[1:55:15] close out
[1:55:17] [Applause]
[1:55:25] hallelujah hallelujah God could not only
[1:55:29] resurrect Lazarus but he's sure he could
[1:55:31] raise himself up and he could raise you
[1:55:33] up also there's a higher low Easter
[1:55:35] activate breaking the natural law that
[1:55:38] man thought he understood the wisdom of
[1:55:40] man said that rain could not have come
[1:55:42] in the days of Noah the wisdom of a man
[1:55:44] said the strength of Egypt was too
[1:55:46] powerful for the slaves to cut free but
[1:55:49] God came through every single age and
[1:55:51] did the unexpected he sent rain when
[1:55:54] they had no rain he broke out slaves
[1:55:56] from the greatest military power on the
[1:55:58] earth at the time he found a man called
[1:56:00] Peter who wasn't uneducated he found a
[1:56:03] man called James and John and Andrew and
[1:56:04] Matthew and he turned them into fishes
[1:56:06] of men he found a 20th century Prophet
[1:56:09] from a little house in Kentucky and made
[1:56:11] him the voice of this age made him the
[1:56:13] messenger of this age throughout every
[1:56:15] age he found unlikely people
[1:56:17] unexpected people he used prostitutes he
[1:56:20] used thieves he used criminals he used
[1:56:23] the good the bad the all medium
[1:56:24] different he used whatever he could find
[1:56:26] as resources to make his plan come to
[1:56:28] life because he's a god of the
[1:56:30] unexpected he sent Joseph in prison that
[1:56:33] was unexpected and he took that
[1:56:35] unexpected situation and made him ruler
[1:56:38] of Egypt God could take you from where
[1:56:40] you at and take the thing that holding
[1:56:42] you down and make it an Unexpected
[1:56:44] Journey for you when you have no food
[1:56:46] like that woman with her Widow when
[1:56:48] Elijah went to visit her she expected to
[1:56:51] die but the god of the unexpected paid
[1:56:54] her a visit oh you don't hear me this
[1:56:55] morning I'm closing out
[1:57:01] just had enough is enough they keep
[1:57:04] taking on the crops and Samuel went out
[1:57:06] there brother Papa he didn't know how
[1:57:08] he's going to do it he was a farmer but
[1:57:10] his feet
[1:57:12] he did something unexpected and the god
[1:57:14] of the unexpected showed up my
[1:57:16] encouragement to you do something
[1:57:18] unexpected and watch the god of the
[1:57:21] unexpected show up praise God when it's
[1:57:24] not expected worship God when it's
[1:57:26] unexpected smile when it's not expected
[1:57:29] pray one is not expected listen
[1:57:32] Jericho
[1:57:34] first day they went around once went
[1:57:37] back home second day they went around
[1:57:38] once went back home third day they went
[1:57:41] around once went back home four days
[1:57:43] went wrong once went back home fifth day
[1:57:45] they went around once by this time they
[1:57:47] stopped writing because they say there's
[1:57:49] a pattern
[1:57:51] we know what's going to happen
[1:57:53] we know it's going to take place
[1:57:55] but they didn't know that it got to be
[1:57:57] unexpected tell Joshua on the seventh
[1:57:59] day
[1:57:59] walk around seven times
[1:58:03] catch demo of God
[1:58:05] god of the unexpected and after the
[1:58:07] seventh the time you walk around just
[1:58:09] Shout
[1:58:10] they wouldn't expect that
[1:58:12] do the unexpected just shout don't raise
[1:58:15] no sword to raise no Shield just shout
[1:58:17] because my strength is in when you
[1:58:20] worship I could flow to the channel of
[1:58:22] worship I can talk to the challenge of
[1:58:24] Praise so I can imagine the children of
[1:58:26] Israel went through once on the first
[1:58:28] day went back home twice and under 70
[1:58:31] they went around once and when the enemy
[1:58:34] told he was going to go back home they
[1:58:35] went wrong a second time well now they
[1:58:37] say well look like something happened
[1:58:38] different
[1:58:41] that serve is different it's an
[1:58:43] unexpected service unexpected D
[1:58:46] unexpected time so we've been a little
[1:58:48] longer than usual
[1:58:51] and after his seventh time
[1:58:54] didn't expect that kind of attack you
[1:58:57] know the normal attack is running into
[1:58:58] the wall climbing by the wall also with
[1:59:00] their shout and he said and they shout
[1:59:03] and the walls began to shake church I
[1:59:05] want to challenge you when you go back
[1:59:07] to your home just enter and worship when
[1:59:09] you go into your job do the unexpected
