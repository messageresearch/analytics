[35:08] we also also thank the bride universal
[35:11] for this virtual convention on the team
[35:15] the manifestation of the sons of god
[35:17] dynamic survivor
[35:19] under the inspiration placing of sun's
[35:22] adoption time i'm taking the scripture
[35:25] from ephesians chapter one
[35:27] three to five he said blessed be the god
[35:31] and father of our lord jesus christ
[35:33] who have blessed us with all spiritual
[35:35] blessings in heavenly places christ
[35:37] jesus
[35:38] according as he has chosen us in him
[35:41] before the foundation of the world
[35:43] that we should be holy and without blame
[35:46] before him in love
[35:48] having predestinated us to the adoption
[35:51] of children by jesus christ to himself
[35:54] according to the good pleasure of his
[35:56] will i'm also taking the scripture from
[35:58] romans 8 22 and 23
[36:02] for we know that the whole christian
[36:05] groaned
[36:06] and travailed in pain together until now
[36:10] and not holy day but ourselves also
[36:14] which have the first fruits of the
[36:16] spirit even as
[36:17] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[36:20] for
[36:20] adoption to with the redemption
[36:24] of our body and we want to thank god for
[36:27] this virtual convention and i want to
[36:30] read something also from the prophet
[36:32] the believer's position in christ
[36:36] it says and we are groaning
[36:39] waiting for that time of adoption
[36:42] and we believe that one of these days
[36:45] the holy spirit will move in
[36:48] not with a new breath for we have
[36:51] received
[36:52] that through christ
[36:56] in the sister one zero six one one he
[37:00] preached
[37:00] revelation chapter five in
[37:02] jeffersonville
[37:03] i also read paragraph 108 we are
[37:07] waiting for the fullness of adoption
[37:10] this will take place when at the first
[37:13] resurrection
[37:15] that's when our bodies will be changed
[37:17] from these
[37:18] viral creatures that we are and we are
[37:22] having
[37:22] a body like his own glorious body
[37:26] for we shall see him as he is and will
[37:29] be like him
[37:31] when he appears will appear in his
[37:34] likeness
[37:35] will have a body like his a glorious
[37:39] glorified body and all the tires and
[37:43] struggles of life
[37:44] will fade off into the little mist and
[37:47] blow
[37:48] away to never be no more and these
[37:51] athlete tabernacles
[37:52] which we now grown in we are waiting
[37:56] for that earnest for the salvation
[37:59] fullness
[38:00] in his fullness to come hallelujah so we
[38:03] thank the lord for all that he has done
[38:05] for us
[38:06] and we know that at the time of creation
[38:09] we have the plant kingdom we have the
[38:12] animal kingdom
[38:14] and we have the human kingdom now in the
[38:16] garden of eden
[38:18] and at the plant kingdom we have the
[38:20] tree of life and the tree of knowledge
[38:22] of good and evil
[38:24] and the animal kingdom we have the
[38:26] serpents
[38:27] then in the human kingdom we have adam
[38:30] and eve
[38:31] but when the four came king
[38:35] that was a product from the animal
[38:38] kingdom
[38:39] and apart from the human kingdom took
[38:41] the fruits
[38:43] to go and sacrifice from the plant
[38:44] kingdom
[38:46] ever who came through adam through god
[38:50] took a lamp from his talk to also go and
[38:53] sacrifice
[38:55] now adam and eve after therefore use
[38:58] aprons from their plant kingdom to cover
[39:02] themselves
[39:03] and we know the prophet told us that the
[39:05] aprons were the religion
[39:07] but when god came down he took a lamp
[39:10] from the animal kingdom to do the
[39:13] sacrifice
[39:14] and to clothe them and that blood i was
[39:17] using on them
[39:18] it was a type of the same blood that
[39:20] would come on cavalry
[39:22] but sadly when their blood came
[39:25] uncovering
[39:26] their redemption only came on adam and
[39:29] eve
[39:30] seed nothing was applied to the plant
[39:33] kingdom
[39:34] and the animal kingdom so as we speak
[39:38] the plant kingdom is crying is growing
[39:42] how does deforestation how the waters
[39:45] have been polluted
[39:46] the people have thrown abortion oh
[39:49] fractures into the rivers
[39:51] they are groaning for redemption how
[39:53] their whole earth is polluted
[39:55] the ozone layer has been depleted they
[39:57] are all waiting for
[39:59] adoption and the bible said not only day
[40:02] but even we we are also groaning because
[40:06] after birth that is not the end of it
[40:08] you need to be adopted
[40:10] and just like in a jewish custom when
[40:13] you take the law
[40:14] and you want to go through adoption you
[40:17] have to go to a welfare home
[40:19] to adopt a son by law but in the jewish
[40:22] custom
[40:23] they don't adopt by law they adopt their
[40:25] own children
[40:26] but this child has to be seen as a
[40:28] proper child take it to a teacher
[40:31] and this teacher will teach that child
[40:33] and then a ceremony is performed for
[40:35] that child
[40:36] through the adoption ceremony where a
[40:38] robe is put on him
[40:40] and he's shown in a public ceremony oh
[40:42] if we look through the bible
[40:44] when jesus was born he was also adopted
[40:47] he was born in a manger but one day on
[40:50] the
[40:50] day in the river jordan god cried out
[40:53] from heaven
[40:54] that this is my beloved son in whom i'm
[40:57] well pleased to dwell
[40:59] but that was not just the end of it he
[41:01] also went to matthew translation
[41:03] where the same god cried out this is my
[41:06] beloved son
[41:07] hear ye him so we can see that he was
[41:10] adopted
[41:11] and from that day he spoke just like the
[41:14] father
[41:15] if we take the jews who apply the blood
[41:18] in egypt
[41:19] that was not the end of it they passed
[41:21] through the rescue
[41:22] in baptism on the wilderness they had
[41:25] their trials
[41:26] but that was not the end of it they
[41:28] crossed cadiz bania
[41:29] and when they got to the land they were
[41:31] placed on the land
[41:33] that was the completion of that justice
[41:35] ceremony for them
[41:37] when we take the bride the brothers of
[41:40] what
[41:40] had a new breath but a new birth alone
[41:44] now if you ask a normal christian in
[41:46] town he'll tell you
[41:47] i'm born again i'm born again baboon
[41:49] again is not enough
[41:51] you need to be placed and need to be
[41:52] adopted and to be placed properly
[41:55] so that you know that you have an
[41:56] inheritance but we thank god
[41:59] the message through the former reign
[42:01] which is a teaching reign
[42:03] has taught us just like the jewish boy
[42:05] and now we have been placed
[42:07] because we are groaning for that
[42:08] adoption now on the day of the
[42:10] resurrection
[42:11] we shall say oh lord we thank you that
[42:14] we have arrived
[42:15] we are taking our position because the
[42:17] bible told us everywhere our future
[42:19] trend
[42:20] we should take possession so we want to
[42:22] thank the lord
[42:23] for their sons and daughters has been
[42:25] taught
[42:26] and has been adopted just like our
[42:28] prophet when he was born
[42:30] the pillar of fire came there oh in 1983
[42:34] he came through the sky and said as the
[42:36] john the baptist was sent to foreign
[42:38] first coming
[42:39] i'm sending you to foreign coming that
[42:41] was not enough
[42:43] in 1946 in that cave an angel was sent
[42:46] from the presence of god
[42:47] to come and speak to him to give you two
[42:49] signs to go and look for the bride
[42:51] out of the gentile world that was not
[42:53] enough almost sunset
[42:55] on the 28th of february 1963 he was also
[42:58] adopted
[42:59] when he was carried up for about 28
[43:01] minutes
[43:02] by several angels to be adopted from
[43:05] that day
[43:06] he stopped saying when he come when he
[43:08] come from that time he started saying

[50:07] to 18. for as many as are led by the
[50:11] spirit of god
[50:12] they are the sons of god for you have

[50:28] itself beareth witness
[50:29] with our spirit that we are the children

[52:26] and now you're trying to call out that
[52:29] group
[52:30] of sons to abduct them
[52:33] we realized that the old law was that a
[52:35] son was born into a home
[52:37] he was a son but the tutor raised him
[52:39] and when
[52:40] he was of age he had been the right kind
[52:43] of a son now this is a prayer he's
[52:44] praying
[52:45] he was taken out and i put a purple robe
[52:48] on in a ceremony and adopted
[52:50] and that's what you're trying to do
[52:52] these full gospel people
[52:54] now to get them out to themselves
[52:58] somewhere alone with you in faith
[53:02] take that word reason again to get them
[53:04] out to themselves somewhere
[53:06] alone with you in faith to adopt them
[53:09] into the kingdom of god and give them
[53:11] the right
[53:12] to go forth and to do the things you did
[53:16] let me read that again hallelujah and
[53:18] that's what you're trying to do
[53:20] these full gospel people now to get them
[53:23] out of themselves somewhere alone with
[53:25] you
[53:25] in faith to adopt them into the kingdom
[53:29] and give them the right to go forth and
[53:32] to do the things that you did
[53:33] some just went but there are some god
[53:36] going to
[53:36] shed scent oh glory to god not just the
[53:39] went once the sent ones
[53:41] and the sent one as a jesus as my father
[53:43] sent me so send are you
[53:45] and for god to send them out he has to
[53:47] be in them or give the lord some praises
[53:50] hallelujah
[53:51] glory to god you say i pray god that you
[53:53] will take these few examples
[53:55] great saint paul writing said seeing
[53:57] that we are compassible with such a
[53:59] great crowd of witnesses
[54:01] let us lay aside every weight and today
[54:04] after a a tread in this gospel from 1975
[54:07] to this hour i see we under
[54:09] the the edge of it we're just looking
[54:12] over the the time as it was when all
[54:15] things will be fulfilled
[54:17] you know when jesus when the cavalry a
[54:18] lot of scriptures start to be fulfilled
[54:20] one after each other one after the other

[54:32] destination oh glory to god so he's
[54:35] praying

[54:38] they would like to run but they are sick
[54:40] and father i pray tonight as i've
[54:43] brought them again the plain simple
[54:44] truth

[56:27] into the liberty the glorious liberty
[56:30] of the sons of daughter of the living
[56:32] god who i feel the quickening power here
[56:35] to this morning

[56:44] you will be seated
[56:48] now when they become a son yes i'm
[56:50] hearing him
[56:52] when he was adopted into the same family
[56:54] he was born in
[56:55] like that same family he was born in now
[56:58] listen presbyterian friend methodist
[57:00] baptist pentecostal
[57:01] when you're born again that only puts
[57:03] you in the family
[57:04] it's your character your
[57:08] conduct that gives god confidence in you
[57:12] not the man sermon your conduct
[57:16] your character i'm not talking this
[57:18] morning
[57:19] about the blessing of a church i am
[57:21] talking about the person of a son
[57:24] and when you say son you're talking
[57:25] about individual then you as an
[57:27] individual
[57:28] have a right to want to be placed and i
[57:32] want to give you a word
[57:33] you are predestinated unto the adoption
[57:37] of
[57:37] sons oh glory to god god is already
[57:40] pre-determined
[57:42] that you're gonna get up there
[57:44] somebody's gonna make it up the mountain
[57:48] oh give the lord a shout it's crowded at
[57:52] the bottom
[57:53] but somebody gonna take it up to the
[57:55] mountain
[57:56] oh glory to god hallelujah at the bottom
[57:59] you find church members
[58:01] at the bottom you find the hypocrites at
[58:03] the bottom behind the liars
[58:05] at the bottom in front of fornicators at
[58:07] the bottom behind the adulterers
[58:09] but somebody's gonna break past whoa
[58:12] it's crawling at the bottom
[58:14] but there's gonna be a place another sun
[58:17] abortion
[58:18] a field son a predestinated son
[58:23] hallelujah there is room at the top
[58:27] for you oh glory to god
[58:33] there's room
[58:37] at the bottom you find in mediocre at
[58:39] the bottom you find the foolish
[58:41] at the bottom you find the simple at the
[58:43] bottom second timothy
[58:45] heavy and high-minded at the bottom but
[58:47] at the top
[58:49] oh glory to god your son's gonna climb
[58:52] oh hallelujah we have not received a
[58:55] spirit
[58:56] of bondage to fear
[59:06] okay the reason
[59:10] that we haven't got the great church
[59:11] mashing on today
[59:13] is because god can't find people to put
[59:16] his
[59:16] confidence in we're not talking about
[59:19] believing the message
[59:21] we're not talking about believing a
[59:22] prophet we're not talking about having
[59:23] books and tapes
[59:24] we're talking about god finding people
[59:28] that he could have confidence in
[59:37] the holy spirit the holy spirit keeps
[59:39] saying
[59:40] they are tearing up they are breaking up
[59:44] they are doing this they're off on the
[59:47] lines
[59:48] stay with god's word that is the pattern
[59:53] that is the blueprint now the same
[59:56] son that was born into the family
[59:59] could be adopted into the same family
[1:00:02] or placed into the same family or give
[1:00:05] them a position
[1:00:06] in the family that he was born into and
[1:00:09] i do believe
[1:00:11] that is the work of the holy spirit
[1:00:13] today
[1:00:14] among the church is trying to place in
[1:00:17] the church
[1:00:18] positionally apostles teachers
[1:00:22] prophets no no no he said we have seen
[1:00:25] many false alarms
[1:00:28] guys are possible by god the prince and
[1:00:31] i can't make an apostle just an apostle
[1:00:33] that is apostle because they're feeling
[1:00:35] apostolicious
[1:00:37] false alarm nice man making their own
[1:00:40] claims that's not god putting that on
[1:00:42] them
[1:00:42] them claiming things watch
[1:00:46] we have seen many false alarms and so
[1:00:48] forth moving among the people
[1:00:50] which only indicated that the real
[1:00:54] genuine adoption was at hand
[1:00:57] i believe it god
[1:01:00] has to place into the church
[1:01:04] not man plays a man but god
[1:01:08] has to place into the church that's the
[1:01:11] business of god not man
[1:01:13] all glory that i'm still reading it's
[1:01:16] god's business
[1:01:17] but today i want to tell you it's god's
[1:01:19] will
[1:01:20] that you'll be placed as a son
[1:01:24] into your position in the kingdom of god
[1:01:27] and no devil in hell ordained to cut you
[1:01:30] off from that
[1:01:31] tell the devil this morning he's a liar
[1:01:34] no
[1:01:34] devil in hell not only that no trial
[1:01:38] nor testing because you it has been
[1:01:40] predetermined
[1:01:42] it has been determined before if you it
[1:01:45] has predestinated
[1:01:47] it has been predetermined that you're
[1:01:50] going to climb
[1:01:51] oh glory to god you're going to go
[1:01:54] through the mountain if you have to
[1:01:56] you're going to go to the sea if you
[1:01:58] have to
[1:01:59] but you've got to make it up there you
[1:02:02] don't belong to the crowd
[1:02:04] you have to be called aside you have to
[1:02:07] be called uphiller
[1:02:10] oh my hallelujah
[1:02:12] [Applause]
[1:02:17] you say i believe that is
[1:02:20] the time that the church has arrived at
[1:02:22] today that the great move in the church
[1:02:24] is for god
[1:02:26] he said we have seen false alarms but
[1:02:27] now god will place
[1:02:30] in his church correctly
[1:02:34] you know this is like walking slowly and
[1:02:37] driving slowly drawing jews of these
[1:02:38] quotes
[1:02:39] placed in the church correctly apostles
[1:02:42] prophets teachers evangelists
[1:02:44] not man made seminary broughton
[1:02:47] but god will place into the church not
[1:02:49] theology run overs
[1:02:50] and overnights but god will place in the
[1:02:53] church as god has
[1:02:54] chosen as the holy ghost has tooted this
[1:02:57] church
[1:02:57] and raise it up and in dear god will
[1:03:00] adapt into his
[1:03:01] position his sons god will do that
[1:03:06] god must do that god has to do that
[1:03:09] as many that led by the spirit of god
[1:03:12] they are the sons of god we are led by
[1:03:15] the spirit of god
[1:03:16] we know we are sons of god if their sons
[1:03:19] ears
[1:03:20] if their sons ears if their sons heirs
[1:03:24] it means we have an inheritance we're
[1:03:26] not here just to say we're here
[1:03:27] gloria put us here just to exist god put
[1:03:30] us here
[1:03:31] because we are ears while i reckon that
[1:03:34] the present suffering
[1:03:35] the hell you're going through the trials
[1:03:38] are going through
[1:03:38] the testing they're going through the
[1:03:40] depression the frustration
[1:03:42] oh god you're locked down oh you're wary
[1:03:44] you're tired
[1:03:45] but i reckon the present perfect it's
[1:03:48] not worthy
[1:03:49] to be compared with the glory that shall
[1:03:53] be revealed
[1:03:54] in your flesh
[1:03:55] [Applause]
[1:03:57] oh glory to god oh glory to
[1:04:01] god the sufferings is not ready to be
[1:04:04] compared
[1:04:06] oh glory to god huh
[1:04:11] hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:04:15] this coronavirus bring a lot of wild
[1:04:18] people in this objection
[1:04:19] they had to adopt the bars they can't go
[1:04:22] in the bars they used to
[1:04:23] they can't go into the cinema as they
[1:04:25] used to they can't go into the party as
[1:04:27] they used to
[1:04:28] they can't go online as they used to it
[1:04:31] bring the flesh on that kind of
[1:04:32] subjection
[1:04:33] by a virus but god wants some
[1:04:35] disciplined sons
[1:04:37] god wants some sons to get an order
[1:04:40] that's why the holy ghost led jesus
[1:04:42] christ
[1:04:43] into the wilderness
[1:04:44] [Applause]
[1:04:49] into his place of trying
[1:04:55] [Applause]
[1:04:58] [Music]
[1:05:00] [Applause]
[1:05:07] if is going to church and hear a nice
[1:05:10] sermon
[1:05:11] and enjoy reserving church we all made
[1:05:13] it
[1:05:15] we reach if we saying amen all the amens
[1:05:19] across the world
[1:05:20] they made it amen hallelujah
[1:05:24] but listen to this but how can the
[1:05:28] church
[1:05:29] the pentecostal church the pentecost and
[1:05:32] the methodist and baptist church be
[1:05:33] adopted
[1:05:34] until they come to discipline
[1:05:39] oh you made me eating discipline after
[1:05:41] i'll go back home
[1:05:43] steal her son
[1:05:47] still in the family here but no
[1:05:49] inheritance
[1:05:52] still a believer simple
[1:05:57] the end on the side of the fool is
[1:05:59] foolish
[1:06:01] the mother decided to wise wise because
[1:06:03] the wives have wisdom of revelation
[1:06:06] to know it will take decline they
[1:06:09] stretch
[1:06:10] the going up the pushing past you
[1:06:13] pass your fears past your feeling
[1:06:15] because of that bondage to fear you know
[1:06:17] yes
[1:06:18] that fear that's behind you oh god the
[1:06:20] fear of the unknown
[1:06:22] the fear of getting all the fear of
[1:06:24] dying the
[1:06:25] fear of you're not going to make it the
[1:06:27] fear of not going to get the holy ghost
[1:06:30] the fear of not being healed all that is
[1:06:32] fears
[1:06:33] but the spirit that he releases not for
[1:06:34] fear the spirit is releasing is the
[1:06:37] spirit of adoption
[1:06:39] whereby we cry not our pastor
[1:06:42] not our apostle not our prophet
[1:06:45] not our church but our father
[1:06:49] or give the lord a shout god want to
[1:06:52] reconnect you
[1:06:53] with the perfect connection that the
[1:06:56] spirit can draw freely
[1:06:58] from father the son he said in sun june
[1:07:00] 14 20
[1:07:02] at that day you're going to know i am in
[1:07:05] the father
[1:07:06] not you and the church not you and the
[1:07:08] pastor come on now
[1:07:10] oh give the lord i shall not you and
[1:07:12] some
[1:07:13] man away with man
[1:07:16] you and god
[1:07:28] how could the baptist church be adopted
[1:07:31] until they come to discipline we have
[1:07:33] got to be disciplined first
[1:07:37] to all you indisciplined people we have
[1:07:39] got to be disciplined place
[1:07:41] for all you didn't get licks when you
[1:07:42] were small you have got to be
[1:07:44] disciplined first
[1:07:45] for all your own correction we have got
[1:07:47] to be disciplined first
[1:07:49] for all you feel you get away you have
[1:07:50] captivities and faith
[1:07:52] all you feeling left to do your own
[1:07:54] thing you have got to be disciplined
[1:07:55] first
[1:07:57] god could not trust this power with the
[1:07:59] church
[1:08:05] it's hard to tell what you will do
[1:08:08] how could a father trust his business
[1:08:09] with a boy that might simply pollute his
[1:08:11] whole inheritance
[1:08:12] i miss son boy take over you ready take
[1:08:15] over and to take over my up
[1:08:18] he couldn't do it the church has to come
[1:08:21] to a place
[1:08:22] to where it is disciplined
[1:08:26] when the adoption time come if the tutor
[1:08:29] that raised the child
[1:08:30] from the child not worthy
[1:08:33] you hear who finding that out
[1:08:40] is the holy ghost right and holy ghost
[1:08:43] don't lie
[1:08:44] you can't ride him you can't say tell
[1:08:46] him tell him
[1:08:50] tell him i ain't so bad i am why is i
[1:08:53] foolish but
[1:08:55] only simple
[1:09:01] that can't make it now if the tutor that
[1:09:04] raised the child found the child not
[1:09:06] worthy
[1:09:07] they absolutely still remain a son but
[1:09:10] missed
[1:09:11] that adoption missed the adoption
[1:09:14] oh so now we find out if you could make
[1:09:16] it clean
[1:09:17] they're here and you're going to push
[1:09:21] instead of picking my option you pass it
[1:09:22] clean miss it don't miss the adoption
[1:09:26] but if there was abducting the family
[1:09:28] then there was
[1:09:29] full shell fellowship with any check
[1:09:31] that they wrote was just as good as the
[1:09:32] father wrote
[1:09:33] that's what the matter is a day brother
[1:09:35] the church ought to be in adoption right
[1:09:36] now
[1:09:37] bringing into the full phase of favors
[1:09:40] of god
[1:09:41] but the thing we are up and down in and
[1:09:42] out up and down in and out
[1:09:44] till god can't trust us with nothing
[1:09:45] hardly one day we belong to assemblies
[1:09:48] next day we belong to something else
[1:09:50] and then peter first peter 4 said
[1:09:53] beloved think it not strange considering
[1:09:56] the fiery trial which is to try you
[1:09:58] as though some strange thing happened to
[1:10:00] you that's not a lot of believers go
[1:10:02] through it like it's a strange thing i
[1:10:03] mean
[1:10:04] i pray every day
[1:10:09] you're doing wrong i i achieve
[1:10:12] i do my best but look what happened here
[1:10:14] look what happened here think it's not
[1:10:15] strange concerning
[1:10:17] firing not this trial fiery anybody
[1:10:20] willing to think about that word called
[1:10:21] fiery
[1:10:22] fiery child which is which is to try you
[1:10:25] as though some stranger to you he said
[1:10:27] but rejoice
[1:10:30] that is growth now if you rejoice i miss
[1:10:33] your trial
[1:10:34] you get immature that is my kind of sin
[1:10:37] the father said look at him now oh glory
[1:10:39] to god you see how we behave
[1:10:41] i miss his fiery childs it make the
[1:10:44] devil get confused
[1:10:46] never scratch his head because he
[1:10:47] expected to give up he expected to pack
[1:10:50] up
[1:10:50] he expected to go back with the crowd oh
[1:10:53] really to god go back fishing
[1:10:54] he expected to do this and do that but
[1:10:56] yeah you're rejoicing
[1:10:58] because you know you're always at hand
[1:11:02] reward behold i come quickly and my
[1:11:05] reward is with me you know your reward
[1:11:07] coming brother
[1:11:08] but rejoice in as much as you are
[1:11:10] partakers of christ's suffering
[1:11:12] so you see paul peter here is showing
[1:11:15] that this suffering
[1:11:17] is comparing with christ suffering you
[1:11:19] can't let him suffer alone he suffer for
[1:11:20] you
[1:11:21] he paid the price name in his hand he
[1:11:23] balled my god while the forsaken me pay
[1:11:25] the price they embarrass him to shame
[1:11:27] him
[1:11:27] they beat him to whip him and you just
[1:11:30] want to slide in the ball who will
[1:11:31] really stop with his supper
[1:11:33] [Music]
[1:11:36] i i reckon that the present suffering
[1:11:41] is not worthy to be compared with
[1:11:46] not worthy to be you can't put them on
[1:11:48] the same scale then
[1:11:50] don't put them on the same scale put
[1:11:52] yourself in here and put glory here
[1:11:54] and watch the glory and rejoice for your
[1:11:56] suffering
[1:11:57] don't put them on the same scale start
[1:11:59] to rejoice because your adoption on its
[1:12:01] way
[1:12:02] start to rejoice because the reward is
[1:12:04] on its way
[1:12:08] [Applause]
[1:12:10] glory he says
[1:12:14] but rejoice in the much of your
[1:12:15] particulars of christ's sufferings that
[1:12:17] when his glory shall be revealed
[1:12:19] you may be glad also with exceeding joy
[1:12:22] if you be approached if you be
[1:12:25] reproached
[1:12:26] for the name of christ happier ye for
[1:12:29] the spirit of glory
[1:12:30] and of god rest it upon you for in their
[1:12:33] party evil spoken of but on your part
[1:12:36] he is glorified oh my so bad
[1:12:40] angel came to him 1946 introduced the
[1:12:42] dispensation of adoption
[1:12:44] breaking past the pentecostal anointing
[1:12:46] that fell in 1906
[1:12:48] because they had gifts signs tongues
[1:12:51] wonders
[1:12:52] and they thought the the they all have
[1:12:54] come of later rain
[1:12:55] but rain can't come to the seed not
[1:12:56] there if the rainfall there's no seed
[1:12:58] wasting time
[1:12:59] so the gifts they had was to create an
[1:13:01] atmosphere for the world to come
[1:13:03] the pentecostal if they had received
[1:13:05] that malachi for prophet the world was
[1:13:07] going to drop
[1:13:07] just in the center of that spirit and
[1:13:09] rapture gone already
[1:13:11] but there was not elected like you are
[1:13:14] names in the book to receive this raptor
[1:13:17] message
[1:13:18] when you check them out they were
[1:13:19] shocked they were only hiding the seed
[1:13:22] the seed was yet to come and the seed
[1:13:24] was totally perfection
[1:13:26] the capstone revelation of jesus christ
[1:13:28] and that's who you are
[1:13:30] joseph to reject him that's who you are
[1:13:34] so i said climb up the critics are down
[1:13:36] there the critics are not up they are
[1:13:38] young
[1:13:38] the people trying to pull you down
[1:13:40] because they don't trying to put you
[1:13:41] down where they are
[1:13:42] don't bother with them they can't go
[1:13:45] where you are going
[1:13:46] you are called to hire order okay the
[1:13:49] lord i shout
[1:13:51] let me say it again the critics and the
[1:13:53] liars
[1:13:54] the people that are jealous and envious
[1:13:56] i'm trying to pull you down
[1:13:57] they are dumb that's why they're trying
[1:13:59] to pull you down they see you climbing
[1:14:01] up
[1:14:01] oh glory to god give me my mountain
[1:14:04] what moses said is mine and if the lord
[1:14:07] be with me
[1:14:08] if the lord be with me i shall be able
[1:14:12] to drive them out oh glory to god you
[1:14:16] have to seize the caption as yours
[1:14:18] i learn to possess a mountain to possess
[1:14:23] hallelujah oh glory to god amen
[1:14:27] hallelujah so what does adoption time be
[1:14:30] identifying
[1:14:31] adoption time the spirit of adoption
[1:14:33] being released
[1:14:35] what is that what does that do make me
[1:14:37] show monsters and say who we are
[1:14:39] no that's spirit of adoption will direct
[1:14:42] you to the wilderness
[1:14:43] we'll tack you to your place of trying
[1:14:46] because in your place of trying
[1:14:47] is where the word image is where
[1:14:50] characters are going to be formed
[1:14:52] you can form that the child supposed to
[1:14:54] bring all that
[1:14:55] all characters another gift card is a
[1:14:57] victory
[1:14:58] to get victory out of a test and when
[1:15:00] that test comes you have to feel it or
[1:15:02] pass it or give the lord a shout come on
[1:15:04] now
[1:15:04] we fail so much where we will pass and

[1:20:09] these sons in the last days we were
[1:20:12] predestinated
[1:20:14] onto adoption adoption is placing
[1:20:18] a son not just to be born
[1:20:21] but god has a plan for you to be an
[1:20:24] adopted son
[1:20:26] and daughter of god oh hallelujah
[1:20:30] go stay with the crowd the hypocrites
[1:20:32] are there
[1:20:33] don't stay with the crowd the church
[1:20:35] members they they love dear
[1:20:37] they feel they just like everybody else
[1:20:39] but you are different
[1:20:41] you are called to a higher order you are
[1:20:43] called to claim
[1:20:44] adoption is not for those at the bottom
[1:20:47] look at the pyramid
[1:20:48] where it's wide at the bottom
[1:20:52] oh glory to god the pyramid narrows as
[1:20:55] they get to the top
[1:20:56] some people as when they hit patients so
[1:20:58] just knock them down
[1:21:03] summers get bonked off on their
[1:21:04] temperance they temper hit them so bam
[1:21:06] they're dying to tempers at all they're
[1:21:08] temper taking them
[1:21:09] so they can't go further that is like
[1:21:12] back on the privilege
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:21] so this is no game let me continue
[1:21:24] that's what god was done in transport
[1:21:26] transfiguration when he took his own son
[1:21:29] own son after he had been proven to be
[1:21:33] the right son
[1:21:36] so jesus come and say uh father oh
[1:21:39] overcome last year i was in the first
[1:21:41] part of life adopt me now
[1:21:45] father didn't say that the bible said
[1:21:47] jesus grew in knowledge
[1:21:49] and wisdom and found fever with good men
[1:21:52] and with god
[1:21:53] jesus had a breakthrough and spend time
[1:21:56] in prayer
[1:21:57] he said to commune with the spirit that
[1:21:58] was within him
[1:22:00] it took time like that morning lord
[1:22:02] hallelujah glory hallelujah see back
[1:22:04] receive the lord
[1:22:04] is even lord good night lord in jesus
[1:22:06] name amen
[1:22:07] no like not jesus one time he spent all
[1:22:11] night in prayer
[1:22:13] he had to and that's why i'm saying if
[1:22:16] jesus would make flesh was was have to
[1:22:18] be earnest to pray endlessly
[1:22:19] what's more what about us and are saved
[1:22:21] by grace
[1:22:24] when so so when he had proven to be the
[1:22:27] right son
[1:22:28] and understood all temptations
[1:22:32] not some so you're going on very head
[1:22:35] and aching with your house
[1:22:46] the prayer was leaders not into
[1:22:47] temptation the prayer was
[1:22:49] father don't take them all to the world
[1:22:51] they're in the world keep them
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:22:54] the prayer wasn't that peter he said
[1:22:55] that your faith failed not
[1:22:57] but the devil is sifting
[1:23:01] devastating sifting sifting if he could
[1:23:03] see if you're just a field

[1:27:35] been
[1:27:35] in other words seasoned out onto

[1:30:36] they were signed they put the signet of
[1:30:37] the ring and stamped it on something
[1:30:38] like that
[1:30:39] he said when jesus had been obedient
[1:30:40] it's a blasphemous name and god placed
[1:30:43] in position this is him
[1:30:44] no prophecy when the member is born
[1:30:48] by the holy ghost into the family of god
[1:30:52] and as proven that word on the line is
[1:30:55] proof

[1:31:39] knowledge temperance patience brotherly
[1:31:42] kindness
[1:31:42] godliness in him then god seals them
[1:31:46] or places him and that is when you see
[1:31:50] the sons and daughters of god so right
[1:31:52] now we're in church
[1:31:54] but hear what we about to see sons

[1:32:05] that is predestinated i believe god said
[1:32:08] he would have a church
[1:32:09] with a spot or wrinkle i believe in
[1:32:11] predestination
[1:32:12] that the bride is predestinated she's
[1:32:14] got to be there
[1:32:16] i am hope i'm with her now it's up to me
[1:32:19] to work out my own salvation with god
[1:32:22] until these things are approved of god
[1:32:25] and then sealed into the kingdom of god
[1:32:27] there is the holy spirit now watch
[1:32:30] when the church comes to this place
[1:32:34] or the individual
[1:32:38] then he says the church is going to be
[1:32:39] there let me say it
[1:32:41] real good so you get it the church is
[1:32:45] predestinated to be there
[1:32:48] i want to be part with it but the only
[1:32:50] way i will be with it
[1:32:52] is to be part of it how do i become part
[1:32:54] of it by being
[1:32:55] in it how do i get in it by the baptism
[1:32:58] of by one spirit oh my

[1:33:24] you are just yourself that is when
[1:33:27] visions is perfect
[1:33:28] holy spirit works of god everything is
[1:33:30] made manifest
[1:33:32] because why you and christ become one
[1:33:35] these virtues from what's called
[1:33:37] ordination
[1:33:39] these virtues has to be in deer before
[1:33:42] the capstone will even come on it
[1:33:45] you might shout you might sing you might
[1:33:47] speak with tongues and dance
[1:33:48] that has nothing at all to do with it
[1:33:50] until these things are scripturally
[1:33:52] proven
[1:33:53] and sealed into you and the holy spirit
[1:33:56] sees you as an individual
[1:33:58] then you are son and daughter of god he
[1:34:00] doesn't see us as a church
[1:34:02] he sees your individual so you have a
[1:34:04] right to want your own mountain
[1:34:06] because it's not church thing you can't
[1:34:08] hide behind nobody
[1:34:09] you can hide down your parents you can't
[1:34:11] hide behind your wife you can't hide
[1:34:12] behind your husband you can't hide in
[1:34:16] anybody
[1:34:22] the pillar of fire is identified
[1:34:24] scientifically by some paradox
[1:34:26] by its character and everything else
[1:34:27] just the same as it was it was dwell in
[1:34:30] the body of god's only begotten son
[1:34:32] so does it dwell in the body of the
[1:34:34] abducted son for this day
[1:34:37] what is that they tell her fire
[1:34:40] ephesians 4 13 till we all come to the
[1:34:43] unity of the fate
[1:34:45] the knowledge of the son of god unto a
[1:34:47] perfect man you shall come to please
[1:34:49] unto the measure
[1:34:50] of the statute of the fullness of christ
[1:34:53] and the amplified that it might
[1:34:55] develop until we attain oneness in the
[1:34:58] fate
[1:34:59] and in the comprehension of the full and
[1:35:00] accurate knowledge of the son of god
[1:35:02] that we might arrive at really mature
[1:35:05] manhood
[1:35:07] the completeness of this personality
[1:35:10] which is nothing less than the standard
[1:35:12] height of christ's own perfection
[1:35:14] the measure of the status of the
[1:35:16] fullness of christ and the completeness
[1:35:18] found in him
[1:35:19] oh my god be my judge
[1:35:22] i am not i am only trying to point out
[1:35:25] something that is the truth
[1:35:27] we have chosen leaders of men instead of
[1:35:30] leaders of the holy spirit
[1:35:31] we have wanted men to unlock out our
[1:35:34] part and to lead us
[1:35:35] listen to these words we we have chosen
[1:35:38] wanted men
[1:35:39] to alert our part and to lead leaders
[1:35:41] denominations like methodist and
[1:35:43] baptists
[1:35:44] to set organization as an example and we
[1:35:46] follow that
[1:35:47] but nowhere in the bible are we to do
[1:35:49] such as that
[1:35:51] there isn't one text of the scripture in
[1:35:53] all god's bible
[1:35:54] where he ever organized a church or
[1:35:55] where he ever spoke of realization
[1:35:57] not one place in the bible but always
[1:35:59] contrary to it onto the adoption
[1:36:02] or the placement of the people how that
[1:36:04] god trying to place his people
[1:36:05] and when god places one the whole church
[1:36:08] wants to be like that one
[1:36:09] have the same kind of things do the same
[1:36:11] thing we are cut out different
[1:36:13] we are made different we are matured
[1:36:15] nature different
[1:36:16] we are positionally placed different
[1:36:18] each one for different work
[1:36:20] maybe one for a little kind of work
[1:36:22] another for a large work
[1:36:24] watch and we are going to stop for a
[1:36:25] second on adoption and balaam says
[1:36:28] let me hear you say it and he asked the
[1:36:30] congregation to see that
[1:36:31] placing and the corrections say placing
[1:36:33] the body
[1:36:35] the body of jesus christ of jesus christ
[1:36:38] positionally positionally in christ
[1:36:42] in christ where the holy spirit where
[1:36:45] the holy spirit
[1:36:46] is leading us that is being placed
[1:36:50] hallelujah and he said the book of
[1:36:52] ephesus
[1:36:53] is to do that it is god's pleasure to do
[1:36:56] his will
[1:36:57] it is god pleasure to place you it is
[1:37:00] god's pleasure
[1:37:01] it does give god's joy it pleases god to
[1:37:04] place his people
[1:37:06] oh glory to god oh hallelujah
[1:37:09] that's what he does he sent for the holy
[1:37:11] spirit and given the baptism holy ghost
[1:37:13] i want you pentecostal people to get
[1:37:14] this out of your hearts
[1:37:15] pentecost is not a denomination
[1:37:17] pentecost is an experience
[1:37:18] it is the holy ghost and you couldn't
[1:37:21] organize the holy ghost
[1:37:22] now placing the sun first thing after
[1:37:24] the sun was in
[1:37:25] he become a son but then we find out his
[1:37:28] behavior
[1:37:29] is what set him to adoption whether he
[1:37:33] behave right
[1:37:34] or not not perseven
[1:37:37] not his teaching not his revelations
[1:37:41] not his mysteries his
[1:37:45] behavior do i know all mysteries
[1:37:49] and i am badly behaved i am messed up
[1:37:58] i'll see no more on that after
[1:38:02] you have proved yourself and sanctified
[1:38:06] yourself
[1:38:07] with your good behavior obedient to the
[1:38:11] holy spirit
[1:38:12] no matter what the world say but ibrahim
[1:38:15] said
[1:38:15] i'm going to rub this really hard
[1:38:17] because i don't mean it to be rude
[1:38:19] please don't really the only thing that
[1:38:22] i'm mean
[1:38:22] i don't want to be what worries me is to
[1:38:25] take people and preach to them gods and
[1:38:27] truth
[1:38:27] and they turn right back just keep on
[1:38:29] doing the same thing and say they got
[1:38:30] the holy ghost
[1:38:31] that just really ruins me they come
[1:38:34] right back to the same thing just like
[1:38:35] the general israel they want a king so
[1:38:37] the king could rule over them
[1:38:38] and make them act like the amorites and
[1:38:40] amalekites and philistines we should be
[1:38:42] so on fire for god
[1:38:44] we should be going day and night nothing
[1:38:46] should be able to stop us
[1:38:48] we should be so sweet so pleasant so
[1:38:51] kind so christ-like in our lives it
[1:38:54] takes our everyday life not a sunday
[1:38:58] life
[1:38:59] not a wednesday life our everyday life
[1:39:06] the crowd they're not every day
[1:39:09] they could be sunday
[1:39:15] then he says it takes everyday life and
[1:39:17] he dropping jesus said consider the lily
[1:39:19] of the field how it grows and toil right
[1:39:23] solomon had robes that was a raid with
[1:39:24] glorious silk and needlework and things
[1:39:26] but that wasn't what he was talking
[1:39:28] about
[1:39:29] in order for the lady to grow it has to
[1:39:31] toy day and night
[1:39:33] so there's a mystery inside this little
[1:39:34] talk
[1:39:37] it's not just an illegal way no the toil
[1:39:40] the climb because the crowd is at the
[1:39:42] bottom
[1:39:44] there's no toil you fellowship in here
[1:39:46] you're photoshopping here you're talking
[1:39:48] here
[1:39:48] talking here moving here moving here
[1:39:50] retoilers is the one who makes a
[1:39:52] difference they get above
[1:39:54] the noise and the higher you go
[1:39:57] the less noise there is and when you
[1:39:59] reach midway people say i can't make it
[1:40:03] forget about it you can't reach it up
[1:40:06] there at the bottom
[1:40:08] but they're telling you climbing you
[1:40:10] can't get up higher
[1:40:12] if you listen to that and hear that and
[1:40:14] let it stick in your head you start to
[1:40:15] slide back down
[1:40:17] forget them
[1:40:21] there is room at the top
[1:40:24] for those who willing to pay the price
[1:40:27] there is room at the top
[1:40:28] for those who are prepared to claim paul
[1:40:31] said forgetting the thing that i passed
[1:40:35] i press forward oh glory god i push
[1:40:38] forward
[1:40:40] the getting here that pass i pressed
[1:40:41] towards the mark where's the mark the
[1:40:43] mark is up there
[1:40:44] i'm almost done my
[1:40:48] where are they at show me where they're
[1:40:49] at god is calling his children aside by
[1:40:51] manifestation
[1:40:52] they don't have to say one word about it
[1:40:55] you see something happen
[1:40:56] positionally placed in his son getting
[1:40:58] him in order just exactly with the same
[1:41:00] things
[1:41:01] and he's just as in much authority his
[1:41:03] word is as good as
[1:41:04] archangel and better the son was adopted
[1:41:07] put on a high place set out there
[1:41:09] change his robe change his colors the
[1:41:11] father of ceremony said this is my son
[1:41:13] from henceforth he's governor he's ruler
[1:41:15] he's over all my heritage
[1:41:16] all what i got belongs to him so watch
[1:41:20] the church is supposed to be
[1:41:21] predestinated under adoption
[1:41:25] he could begin to play something he says
[1:41:29] when a man god can take a man and adopt
[1:41:31] him into the family and give him
[1:41:32] something
[1:41:34] god could do that right first
[1:41:37] try that nothing that will get he he has
[1:41:41] that
[1:41:42] no he said try that maybe we have
[1:41:44] already tried that
[1:41:45] yeah who claimed to be apostles be
[1:41:47] trying that too
[1:41:49] who claimed to be prophet we're trying
[1:41:50] that too who claimed to be minister man
[1:41:52] half son of man want to be son of man
[1:41:54] son of mine wannabe
[1:41:55] we're trying that too hallelujah trying
[1:41:58] everything
[1:42:00] and see if it is right the bible said
[1:42:02] try the spirits
[1:42:04] this man claim a certain thing try it
[1:42:05] see if it's right if it is right move
[1:42:07] right with it
[1:42:08] lord send us something else keep moving
[1:42:11] just keep moving say
[1:42:13] till every fellow take its place then
[1:42:16] you're going to see the church of god
[1:42:17] begin to get in this place
[1:42:19] then is when the philistine will go to
[1:42:20] backing up the shorts will go off
[1:42:22] here we'll go down faces will be washed
[1:42:24] singers will be missing that's right
[1:42:26] and then we'll have the church and gets
[1:42:28] into his mighty power
[1:42:30] and then is when you're gonna have an
[1:42:31] asset to fire a few of them you will see
[1:42:33] when that holy church stands together in
[1:42:36] its power
[1:42:37] positionally priests are sons of god
[1:42:39] adopted into the family of god
[1:42:40] a powerful church that he's coming for
[1:42:44] oh my place another son i'm finished
[1:42:47] last quote
[1:42:48] take him out to a sitting place have a
[1:42:50] ceremony before angels
[1:42:52] place him positionally what he is in the
[1:42:54] body of christ then that person has the
[1:42:57] authority
[1:42:58] let me say this if you me as a
[1:42:59] fanatic from this night on
[1:43:01] that very same thing i'm speaking of
[1:43:05] will be done there will be a power put
[1:43:07] into the church
[1:43:08] and now it's coming in that the holy
[1:43:10] spirit was so annoyed the people
[1:43:12] till they will speak the word i will
[1:43:14] create itself right there we haven't
[1:43:16] seen powers
[1:43:17] like that coming the church now i knew
[1:43:18] it for a fact see unto this mountain

[1:43:22] but believe that what you say shall come
[1:43:23] to pass you can have what you have said
[1:43:25] the placing of the church and position
[1:43:29] where the fullness of the power of the
[1:43:31] holy ghost
[1:43:32] comes into the church then the critic's
[1:43:34] mouth will be shut
[1:43:36] it will be a short time jesus come right
