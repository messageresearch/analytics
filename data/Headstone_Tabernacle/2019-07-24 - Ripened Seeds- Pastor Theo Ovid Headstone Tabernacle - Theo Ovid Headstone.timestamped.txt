[22:47] for reading from verse 24
[22:59] Oh Leslie from verse 26 rather and he
[23:02] said so is the kingdom of God as if a
[23:06] man should cast seed into the ground and
[23:08] should sleep and rise night and day and
[23:12] the seed should spring and grew up he
[23:15] knoweth not how for the bringing forth
[23:18] fruit of its herself first the blade
[23:21] then the ear after that the full corn in

[23:30] because the harvest has come may God
[23:33] bless this word universe would even be
[23:35] seated or praise the name of the Lord
[23:38] tonight of a title ripened seeds ripen
[23:44] seeds another inspiration to lay in the
[23:48] presence of the Sun no on sunday we talk
[23:52] about sweat it out and many people not
[23:56] interested in sweating anything out
[23:59] they interested in a short cut but there
[24:02] are no short cuts the word is God
[24:07] forget your feelings tonight forget the
[24:09] emotions forget you have to snap out at
[24:12] the humanistic ground and break into the
[24:14] realm of what God have said define
[24:17] revelation what could have said so have
[24:19] a few quotes to share with you tonight
[24:21] not just coral bless it and inspire see
[24:23] that you know it's not something that
[24:25] you don't know since that you already
[24:26] know but it's how we apply it to our
[24:29] lives and ourselves this is the age
[24:32] where there's so much destruction with a
[24:35] cell phone with the internet with
[24:36] friends or the phone and you know these
[24:39] we didn't have cell phone we didn't have
[24:42] a ton of this destruction you have no
[24:45] internet and all these access only
[24:48] special people that cell phone in those
[24:49] days but the point is we had more time
[24:52] in prayer more time to study law and
[24:55] things of God and today with the hustle
[24:58] and bustle it's so difficult but we are
[25:03] still called to distinction and
[25:05] this responsibility and bam talk about
[25:09] the brighter responsibilities of Christ
[25:11] and the word and the prayer it is a
[25:14] responsibility you have to determine to
[25:17] make a commitment to it you have to
[25:19] determine to stir yourself up because it
[25:21] has to be done you have to do it you
[25:25] have to push and press your way this is
[25:29] what Eagles were designed for his Eagles
[25:32] wasn't designed to be grouped like the
[25:35] fly Zulu and find a meetin and see about
[25:39] their own kind and so designed to do and
[25:43] God be too and his people going to fly
[25:45] in this hour he chose you because you
[25:48] are special he chose you because you can
[25:51] be pressurized don't think you can
[25:54] handle that you can because he will
[25:56] never give you more than you can bear
[25:57] because he is faithful say he is
[26:00] faithful tonight he is faithful tonight
[26:03] he knows what you're going through
[26:05] remember everyone is going through
[26:07] something because they try and come to
[26:09] try every man on the earth every man
[26:11] woman family home will be trying to
[26:14] desert none will escape none will escape
[26:18] every man woman child family gonna be
[26:22] tried and desert or glory that God you
[26:24] take in your trial now you take in your
[26:26] tribulation no you take in your pressure
[26:28] now some will take it all in the
[26:30] tribulation you come here to escape the
[26:32] tribulation or glory to God by coming
[26:35] into the child of your feet
[26:36] hallelujah because a worse time lays
[26:39] ahead for the unbeliever and the make
[26:41] believer and the church member become in
[26:43] the brightest rapture don't ever make
[26:46] war with the remnant of the woman see
[26:47] when the bat is raptured the devil be
[26:50] angry that he couldn't get a hole up on
[26:52] that bride so the remnant of the church
[26:54] members he would be loosed after them Oh
[26:56] glory to God the devil after you know
[26:58] you better praise God
[27:00] Oh hallelujah praise God because he has
[27:02] something in you that's why he's after
[27:04] you no of course I know he's after he's
[27:06] supposed to be after you you are the
[27:08] bride of Jesus Christ or glory to God if
[27:11] you don't know two hundred thousand
[27:12] thousand Devils have been loosed against
[27:15] the bride
[27:16] that was loose against you they'll stop
[27:18] those Devils the target and church
[27:20] members these are the different demons
[27:21] now this level target and bride all
[27:24] glory to God ones that potentials in you
[27:27] you are targeted all glory to God you
[27:30] are target for demonic attacks for
[27:32] pressure for stress or glory to God for
[27:35] all kind of depression and frustration
[27:37] you are targeted or glory to God and
[27:41] what all this pressure is for you see
[27:43] each of us we see there's pressure and
[27:45] trials and testing but the god he see
[27:47] you are getting right on because you
[27:50] have to be a ripened seed or glowing of
[27:53] God not a fresh soldier a trained
[27:55] soldier or glow either God a ripened see
[27:58] we believe that so but herb and him say
[28:00] watch Nietzsche he said a thing watch
[28:02] he said you watch nature we see where
[28:04] every age designed it out in the last
[28:07] age of chakras pulled away we have 15
[28:09] years nearly 20 know of the message
[28:11] sweeping from nation to nation this one
[28:13] in hooked up across the nation and no
[28:15] organization it can't organize there's
[28:18] nothing ever been like it or will be
[28:20] hereafter but the team that's the matter
[28:23] with the message today is those who
[28:25] obtain it in their hearts must leave in
[28:28] the presence of the Sun to get ripen
[28:32] uh-huh we're not talking about church no
[28:35] we're not talking about coming to
[28:36] service now we're talking about coming
[28:38] into presence Oh hallelujah
[28:41] so this message supposed to bring us
[28:43] into presence
[28:45] hallelujah not just talk not explanation
[28:50] but to draw you into presence and in
[28:53] that presence you got to stay on the
[28:55] deal and abideth very few gonna get
[28:58] there but I can me that's a different
[28:59] thing altogether they're not writing
[29:01] notes and writing some code and writing
[29:03] something is trying to remember and
[29:05] reading some book no no no no no that is
[29:08] laying there in presence Oh hallelujah
[29:12] there's a purpose for that hallelujah
[29:15] watch to get ripen you can pick up the
[29:18] message
[29:19] and let the sun-baked all the greenness
[29:22] out of you to make you mature Christians
[29:25] you see what I mean God is coming to
[29:28] receive his church and we must have that
[29:30] type of Christian for him to receive or
[29:34] glory to God so it's not just Christians
[29:36] is that type or Kobe give the Lord a
[29:39] shout tonight it's not just Christians
[29:42] in that type your wife have to notice
[29:44] your husband after know this though you
[29:46] never have to notice your friends after
[29:48] notice it's not just Christians it's the
[29:50] type mature Christians ojala the wheat
[29:54] has got to get right
[29:57] Oh glory to God amen and the evening
[30:01] light produces that Oh glory to God
[30:03] somebody said to me at anybody right now
[30:06] precious brother of mine he said he's
[30:07] seen like a sock on a vine he said we
[30:10] discussed it in the room the other day
[30:11] but I rather was these two before the
[30:13] conditions of the time the feeling of
[30:16] the Spirit in the churches today hold
[30:18] began to drop down ministers from
[30:20] everywhere interviews asking what
[30:23] happened what has happened but I rather
[30:25] asked me are they living off the spirit
[30:27] of Satan or what so if they feeling less
[30:30] of the anointing less of the presence he
[30:32] said I said no the circle is of the
[30:34] strength of the vine it lives because
[30:36] the citrus food and lemon will grow in
[30:38] an orange tree but it will not be
[30:40] oranges do it live by its life so the
[30:42] church so call is only a grafted sucker
[30:45] living under the name of religion under
[30:47] the name of the church Catholic and
[30:49] Protestant just suckers and just as it
[30:51] have churches that are suckers enough
[30:53] Christian people or church members
[30:54] that'll just suckers then living under
[30:56] the branch of the message and
[30:58] Christianity and they are Rascals and
[31:00] they are just suckers producing the own
[31:02] life they're not interested in
[31:03] transformation the not interested and
[31:05] delights me and change this reason will
[31:07] come at the church because church is a
[31:08] covering and it covers the a brigade of
[31:10] a religion a message religion not a life
[31:15] transformation yet they're in the fruit
[31:22] what they are because it wasn't
[31:24] convicted it wasn't in the original
[31:26] predestinated plan of God that's the
[31:29] reason they have to deny the word and
[31:31] the other kind of fruit the real genuine
[31:34] tree in the roots was predestinated to
[31:37] pay for oranges God had given a
[31:39] buffet-style that you choose who you
[31:41] want you have to eat the whole rule or
[31:43] give the Lord a shout do you get what
[31:46] I'm saying there it's not buffet style
[31:48] you pick and choose what you want you
[31:50] have to eat the whole scroll or glory
[31:52] record and you could prophesy about your
[31:54] own life Oh glory to God you know you're
[31:57] gonna make it hallelujah no you're gonna
[32:00] get a break truth you're not you're
[32:02] gonna deliver runs you'll know you're
[32:04] gonna get victory
[32:04] you can prophesy about your own life
[32:06] because they eat the whole scroll or
[32:09] glory to God amen
[32:11] jesus said I am the vine you are the
[32:13] branches and if there's ever scripture
[32:16] that really uncurse this thing is the
[32:20] scripture st. John 15 I am the vine ye
[32:23] are the branches every branch that does
[32:24] the producer me I cut off Oh glory to
[32:27] God hallelujah and every branch that
[32:29] group it begin to produce I'm gonna
[32:31] prune it that'll bring forth more fruit
[32:33] and heaven is my father glorified that
[32:35] to bring forth much fruit or glory that
[32:38] got stuck or not interested in branches
[32:40] he interested in fruit or chlorine
[32:42] O'Connor when the farmer put on the seed
[32:44] he sleep he's raised he's sleepy wake up
[32:47] hallelujah and he seen it growing he's
[32:49] no not how it just growing because
[32:51] there's a law in it because once you put
[32:54] the see there's a law in it you don't
[32:56] have to do nothing there's a law in the
[32:58] seed in itself to let the devil try to
[33:00] mess with your mind there's a law of the
[33:02] seed inside of you and to give it clear
[33:12] jesus said you have to buy the knee not
[33:16] we after me not be like a false teeth
[33:19] attached to me you have to be connected
[33:22] to me not connected but connected
[33:26] because when you're connected then the
[33:28] light will flow from the vine to the
[33:31] branch and then for this root
[33:33] all glory to God so we're talking about
[33:35] a connected life I connected life not to
[33:39] touch life not a reason oh when I gave
[33:42] life but that but the connected life you
[33:45] have to want that kind of life because I
[33:47] connected life the life of Christ
[33:50] control true or glory does not remember
[33:52] he's trying to get the church in
[33:54] position that he Co said there is my
[33:56] spirit flowing freely or glory to God
[34:01] you want to see a spirit flowing freely
[34:02] because that is what was in the
[34:04] beginning there was darkness coming in
[34:06] and the Spirit of God begin to move or
[34:08] glow in their garden and God said let
[34:10] there be light or something else to move
[34:13] because the voice speaks to move is that
[34:18] practice until you're a beginner move
[34:20] okay it's chaos until the spring begin
[34:22] the move although it's confusion until
[34:24] the speaking of all all the confusion
[34:27] and message will be canceled when the
[34:29] spirit begins let me say that in all the
[34:37] confusion all the darkness all the mess
[34:40] in the message that will be wiped out
[34:43] when the spirit begins to move on
[34:47] because God will speak once more the
[34:51] world with Tyra from God once more or
[34:55] glory to God the fire want to be upon
[34:58] the sons of God to speak dusty of the
[35:01] Lord because a bribe alive - here the
[35:03] Lord while she wills keep still when the
[35:06] Spirit begins to move then you look for
[35:08] the miraculous to take place because
[35:10] when omnipotence speak you'll get the
[35:14] Lord I show the miraculous gonna take
[35:16] place or going a goodbye omnipotence
[35:26] I'm Jesus naked clean you can do nothing
[35:30] without me
[35:30] if you forgot you are the branch again
[35:32] through chipper I know we undo your own
[35:34] thing like some disconnected branch and
[35:36] you're on your own
[35:36] you're wrong that is brain that's not
[35:42] connected to the source somebody some
[35:45] group somewhere some pasta and they
[35:47] perfect in with scenes there is one body
[35:54] and by one spirit you have baptized into
[35:57] one body or let me say this with my once
[35:59] great you are connected to the body the
[36:04] body is a spirit connection that's why
[36:06] the first message was you must be born
[36:08] again to get a new birth to get a fresh
[36:11] connection to come from the power source
[36:15] let's continue
[36:16] she said if that tree ever puts forth
[36:19] another branch it will be its original
[36:21] fruit original so that's alpha branch
[36:25] produce something and God sent two
[36:27] processes and God have on listen alpha
[36:29] branch produce another book of Acts that
[36:31] was the Alpha does he simply die Scott's
[36:35] plan alpha produce book of Acts then
[36:38] after the book of Acts though you have
[36:40] grafted plants Church ages grafts
[36:44] grafton Luther Wesley grafts coming in
[36:47] when the Prophet came he brings a condom
[36:49] in the world to bring back original
[36:51] restoration of what was in the beginning
[36:53] that is why it said he shall tell the
[36:56] house of the children back to the faith
[36:57] of the fathers because we are going back
[36:59] to the original or glory of God you are
[37:03] going to be original or cash oh you are
[37:07] going to be original no photocopy no
[37:11] carbon copy no clone and nothing you
[37:13] gonna be original I am Alpha and Omega
[37:16] the first and the last row is the same
[37:18] church just because it wasn't trying to
[37:24] those guys in gonna rupture but it
[37:25] already my god let them get sealed away
[37:29] and it so if it put for another branch
[37:32] it would be original fruit and there's
[37:34] got to be a restoration of all these
[37:37] things right
[37:38] at the end of the vine there is to be a
[37:41] restoration of the evening light to
[37:43] light it up and to make it right and
[37:45] will come out of the vine not a
[37:47] denomination grafted in it but the
[37:49] original production of the word is got a
[37:51] comfort for the even time there will be
[37:53] light in the even time it takes light to
[37:55] write knit it takes what all perfectly
[38:01] in the scripture I did I won't be called
[38:02] the all-night fruit cannot write them
[38:04] unless the sunlight and said that's
[38:06] nature right no matter how much you
[38:08] preach here we go whatever you do it
[38:10] cannot be right man it cannot be
[38:12] manifested it cannot be vindicated only
[38:15] by him you said I am the light of the
[38:17] world so he flatly pancake on the
[38:20] teachers and the preachers and everybody
[38:23] right until the light comes it could
[38:35] only be right when by him who said I am
[38:37] the light of the world okay now watch
[38:39] this what is you know so there has got
[38:44] to comfort a power the Holy Spirit
[38:48] Himself the right or to vindicate or to
[38:53] prove or to make manifested that what he
[38:57] predicted would happen in this day after
[39:01] all the talk is over it has to come for
[39:04] a power the Holy Spirit itself this is
[39:08] the person of the Holy Ghost this is not
[39:10] baptism this is the person of Christ

[1:16:25] presence till it tenders up and get
[1:16:28] sweet in the spirit so he can't be done
