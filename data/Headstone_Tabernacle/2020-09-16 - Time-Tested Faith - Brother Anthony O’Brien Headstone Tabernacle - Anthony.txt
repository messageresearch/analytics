bibles we have a one scripture reading tonight amen in the book of genesis and we want to read from genesis chapter 18 and just 9-14 there amen please go on talking about syria in the tent and uh praise god i know you're very familiar with the scripture but uh the holy spirit amen uh let's kind of whisper this to me today so praise the lord i want to bring it out just where he said it amen so praise god genesis chapter 18 and um amen just for context really and reading from verse nine amen and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life hello sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed oh shall i have pleasure my lord being old also and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety bear a child which i'm all is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son may god add blessing to the reading of his word tonight amen let's bow our heads one more time o heavenly father lord lord we thank you for the privilege tonight to be called the sons and daughters of god lord is a privilege it's an honor father and lord we thank you for the grace if you put upon our lives to answer this call that you have placed upon our souls law lord we're here to answer tonight lord we know that you put faith in our souls to receive your word tonight so father we pray that your anointing will come down and bless your people lord as we for a few moments we preach the word tonight lord help me there god take me out of the way father and use me lord to speak to your people lord in a mighty way and may be blessed lord father over the internet hook up lord wherever your people are tonight lord may your holy spirit abide with them tonight lord and breathe life upon them tonight father raise them up in health lord and strength lord father you know what they have need of but lord you have already provided it father all we need is a faith to receive your promised word so grounded almighty god we pray now that you bless your people for a few moments as we uh enter into this scripture lord may the holy spirit quicken your word to us tonight and strengthen us for the journey in jesus name we pray and ask it amen and amen glory to god hallelujah amen give him a praise offering oh hallelujah we love him oh hallelujah glory to god amen amen please god well have a seat amen praise god god bless you amen make yourself comfortable tonight amen tonight we have to speak the word of god amen glory to god hallelujah amen so we read this context our scripture genesis 18-9 for our message that the lord put upon my heart sunday morning amen he told me time tested fate amen so that's what we're here to speak tonight amen time tested faith glory to god so god bless you church amen certainly uh greet you in the precious name of jesus christ and we know that this might be a frightful hour for many but for the elect few it's a most powerful hour it's a glorious hour amen because if there ever was a time to have faith in god now is that time oh hallelujah pray if there ever was a time to believe the scriptures of god to believe what god said to believe that what god spoke will come to pass now is that our tonight oh hallelujah praise god amen oh hallelujah i believe it with all my heart and so tonight we come away praise god just for a few moments for a little faith message amen amen i love wednesday nights amen i love midweek services praise god you know on a sunday you get to take in the word and you get a rest in the weekend after the long week amen you get a chance on the lord's day to do your duty amen but in the mid week is just a couple hours that you steal amen praise god because sometimes you're on the ropes in the midweek amen but being on the ropes is not a bad thing praise god because sometimes the trainer catches a chance to slip around where you are just at the side of the ropes just when you are against the beating praise god to whisper our words and due season praise god to show you how to defeat the enemy you meant get him on that left side please got it the trainer holly can slip around the side of you pray while you're on the ropes please go to man and show you how to defeat the enemy praise god so that's what we're here for tonight amen for god to show us how to defeat the enemy and for us how to get the victory praise god we believe tonight that fate is a victory praise god that overcomes the enemy that overcomes the world greater is he that is in you tonight than he that is in the world oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen we believe it tonight praise god so faith to take a hold of god's promised word in order to stay the course in order to stay in the atmosphere hallelujah it takes faith to do that isn't that right now is the hour where we prove what has been in us all along oh hallelujah now is the hour where we prove that we are standing not upon what man said but upon what god said not standing upon our thoughts not upon our emotions our emotions will fail our reasoning will fail our eyes will fail us there's just despair all around although you can't look to the left you can't look to the right however david said i'll look into the hills from whence commit my help oh holla the enemy is all around on those hills but my help don't come from the hills my help come from the lord which made heaven and hurts oh hallelujah praise god amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory man hallelujah amen amen now is the hour where we prove what has been inside of us all along all the time we just talk all the time we're just coming to church but this is the hour where we hold shas to that which is true oh hallelujah glory to god man oh where your fate when everything else falls away when every system crashes when everything of the world fell apart when everything that you think is so strong falls apart this is the hour when your fetch bedrock concrete fate is what stands in the cap hallelujah hallelujah hold to god's unchanging hand oh i might be able to feel nothing but the devil cannot move me tonight my faith declares it to be so i may not see with my eyes but in my heart i already have it tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god give him praise hey amen amen hallelujah amen so for a few moments tonight oh hallelujah i feel something coming down the line oh it's the holy ghost and power your faith is pulling it on the line oh don't you worry don't you fret there is a man in here tonight who can turn on the lights you turn on the light in your soul oh the kingdom of god will be the word of god turn to power in your hearts in your life in your soul oh hallelujah and it takes place to move the power oh she's got fates the little remnants she's got fate the little woman hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory hallelujah oh it feels good tonight amen hallelujah so what do we endeavour to present tonight is time tested fate hallelujah time tested faith those are true just three words but there's a lot in there isn't that right first want to talk about fate and then we want to talk about testing well that's another subject oh it's awesome to have faith but then god's love to test that fate to see if it's real to see if it's pure to see if it's the real thing amen oh it's got to be tested in order to be trusted oh hallelujah and then finally we're going to talk about time if the lord permits oh god loves to put time on things hollis stretched things way out until his word came the word of the lord tried joseph oh in prison oh however he was called of god he had a prophecy of his life holly is what's the switch from the prophet to the prophecy hallelujah in his life but yet he had to wait till the word of god and his season will come to pass hallelujah oh my my my amen hallelujah to put it another way tonight so what we're talking about tonight if you put it another way we can say faith that stands the test of time amen that's what they're talking about amen time tested faith praise god hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory amen oh so now jesus said by your fruits you shall know them isn't that right in order to know what kind of tree it is we have to see the fruits that it is bearing oh hallelujah and faith is the evidence of things you can't see oh hallelujah so by faith you declare that my fruits are coming my fruits are coming even though you can't see it even though the devil can't see it your faith is prophesying it shall be it shall be it's going to be on your anointing your faith is anointing the promise of god to you it's a reality to you it's a divine revelation to you oh hallelujah isn't that right that's why we can't stress enough the importance of revelation of personal revelation from god because when you see it the devil can't shake you when you see it the devil can't move you when you see it nobody have to tell you to worship nobody have to tell you to hook up on a wednesday nobody got to tell you to hook up on a sunday your heart is burning within you as he speaks to you by the way you can't help but praise him you can't help but shout you can't help but praise god you can't help but kill any atmosphere oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god in many many man hallelujah so until your fruits come in your faith is what stands in the gap and testifies that the prophecy is true hey man your faith is declaring it all the time all the time and then when it happens it comes as a confirmation of your faith amen that you truly did believe in the word of god for the hour oh hallelujah praise god that the word of god is true and that god said soul and that he cannot lie oh hallelujah hallelujah amen isn't that right praise god hey many man first peter four says beloved thinking not strange concerning a fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you oh of this situation the circumstance that the world is facing is no strange thing this fire trial oh hallelujah hallelujah brother but peter says rejoice oh hallelujah he gives a word of god hallelujah of encouragement here tonight rejoice because in as much as you are partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed oh you shall be glad also with exceeding joy oh hallelujah brother i'm rejoicing tonight oh because i know that my promise is coming down the road oh it's coming hallelujah the ark is coming up the road oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen oh glory thank you lord jesus amen amen hallelujah amen oh so we know hebrews 11 kind of defines for us what faith is i'll just read through it quickly amen just a little faith message tonight amen destroy our souls towards the promise of god hallelujah this is the hour this is the hour praise god amen hallelujah stand still and see the salvation of your god amen amen hallelujah hebrews 11 says now faith is the substance of things hoped for it is the evidence of things that are not seen oh however you may not see your blessing but faith is the evidence you may not see your healing but your faith is the evidence you may not see things working out you may not see things working out for you or for your family or for your household but faith is the evidence faith stands in the face of the devil and says it shall be it shall be it shall be hallelujah oh glory to god man i'm not afraid of the son of man or his words faith it says for by it the elders obtained a good report amen isn't that right and true faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god the very foundation of god of of the world isn't that right was spoken by the god that spoke hallowed those words and faith let there be light let there be an earth let there be this let there be that oh hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah the very world was framed by it so that things which are seen around us are not made of things which do appear it was an invisible god who spoke let there be light it was an invisible god who spoke the earth into existence and everything you see around you does visible was made by something that is invisible and this invisible god always had a desire in his heart to become visible among the people that's why the god of glory became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace full of truth that invisible god was made visible and he said even though that's god has sent me even so send are you that invisible god was going to fail himself in human skins he was going to walk among us while he failed in peter failed in james failed and john if that's what he did in the early church then he's going to do it again tonight god tonight the invisible god hallelujah is looking for skin veils or how to fail himself inside oh holy i'm profess his name one more time to the nations oh get a lot of shadow praise oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god amen glory to god amen oh hallelujah my faith declares it deep down in my heart the spirit is moving i might feel nothing on the outside but faith is turned faith is rising tonight oh any enemy coming like a flood positive more positive faith is positive tonight oh hallelujah oh brother hallelujah i don't know if we'll get through this tonight oh hallelujah my god hallelujah hey many man oh there's atmosphere in the church tonight well i pray you feel that atmosphere too all you gotta do is raise your hands and you watch god crack the skies you watch god come to your rescue he'll fill you with the holy ghost he'll fill you with the power of god he'll give you what you need just have faith tonight oh hallelujah for the blessing for the miracle have faith in god [Music] hebrews 11 and verse 6 says but without faith it is impossible to please god then to please him isn't it for he that coming to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so we're here to diligently seek him tonight holy with all your hearts with all your soul with all this within you hallelujah praise god with all industry all in her business like hallelujah hallelujah you're holding fast all unmotivated moved hot fully persuaded hallelujah hallelujah that's how you got to be in this season and he will reward them that diligently seek him seek him without end pray without ceasing i'll fight without ending hallelujah hallelujah don't fight until you're tired fight until you win hallelujah don't you give up don't you let go oh if i lose my teeth i use your gums but i'm not giving up i'm not backing down i'm not throwing in the towel hallelujah oh my my my hallelujah and what a bible teacher we had yesterday praise god amen what a masterpiece talking about that woman hallelujah oh my she didn't give up she didn't back down she said if you give me this trial this thing ain't done yet it's not over until it's over it's not over hallelujah hallelujah oh she said all is well it is well it's going to be well but she was on her way she had to see the man of god and tonight hallelujah let the world know it's all right they can't help you this truth i have although this truth i have for the holy ghost they can't help us with that it is well don't worry about it but i've got to get there i've got to get to that secret place where man and god meets hallelujah where god gives man an experience and he is never the same i can't hallelujah oh glory glory glory glory amen oh give him a praise offering tonight hallelujah oh my god verse 32 hebrews 11 says and what shall i most say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and parak and samson and jephthah and david and samuel and the prophets and through faith who subdued kingdoms who wrought righteousness obtain promises stop the mouth of lions hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah there's going to come a group that's going to stop the mouth of coronavirus or they're going to stop them out of disease of cancer hallelujah holiday of anything pray it won't stand anyway all of this practice shall not see death oh there's how many hearts fought coming from the lord oh honey god's going to get that bright fate oh hallelujah seven thunders give us faith to call for the power hallelujah to stop hallelujah or sickness in their tracks to stop diseases to bring forth a revival oh a revival of the just and the just shall live by faith oh hallelujah praise god amen hallelujah oh my amen through early quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness in your weakness they were made strong waxed valiant and fight oh david said teach my fingers to fight oh hallelujah pray fight for the promise fight for what's yours fight for your children fight for your family fight for the holy ghost fight every inch of crown that you claim to stand upon the devil's gonna prove it but you are here tonight we didn't come in this world to leave it the way it was no we're going to shake it we're going to shake the nations we're going to shake this world once more this will be here direct from god manifested sons and daughters of god oh hell if he did that then it will do it tonight oh it's the same faith oh hallelujah amen the prophet said there's no difference in the old testament new testament it's the same faith same fate david had same fate peter it was the same faith hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right oh my same face only one faith huh hallelujah all right he said no women receive their dead wax violence and fight during our flight the armies of the aliens and women who received their dead raised to life again just like the bible said amen and others with torture not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection oh my hallelujah oh they were looking to the unseen oh my eyes were upon something they could not see didn't materialize yet or their eyes were beyond this world their fate was beyond what they could feel what they could what they could uh experience in there and oh my praise god and they chose death they chose torture amen rather than accepting deliverance others had trials of cruel mocking and scourging yay moreover of bonds and of imprisonment there was stone there was sound asunder they were slain with the sword they wondered about her sheepskins goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented oh hallelujah my my my come on now what's your trial what's your test these were destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy great sages and prophets ma isn't that right yeah they were destitute oh but hallelujah they wanted in deserts mountains and in the dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report true faith received not the promise god harvard provided some better thing for us that day without us should not be made perfect oh hallelujah hallelujah our glory oh god has provided something better for us isn't that right is that why he sent a prophet to release a message to take us to perfection order to take us to adoption hallelujah to take us to get these virtues in us a better thing for us that day without us are not made perfect that this thing when built in you would bring up the dead in christ oh hallelujah i say yes sir oh hallelujah that's the purpose glory to god to cap the church or finally amen get her ready for the rapture amen isn't that right so whenever long hair now fate faith is more common than you realize the prophet said most of us use faith every day without realizing it isn't that right hallelujah this little word faith prophet said have faith in god hallelujah and uh time tests of faith he said oh i'm told that an old testament that faith in the old testament was the same way it is in the new testament here's the prophecy said so many people stumble at the thought of faith but it's so simple to have faith he said for instance you can't move out of your seat if you were able to come in and sit down you cannot move from your seat unless you had faith that you do it oh my he said you can't put your hat on again unless you had faith that you could do it he said never can you draw another breath unless you had faith you could do it he said faith is so common that when we look at it for something a little unusual and go way over the top of it trying to find it he said it's what's right next to us oh hallelujah [Applause] hey man so this subject we're talking about tonight is not something way in over your head brother it's something right next to you holiday you live in it every day and you don't even realize when you turn your key in your car and you say i'm going somewhere i'm going out to get the groceries i'm going to do this or whatever that faith take faith to do that to know that that coward start praise god and know that you was gonna come back hallelujah you told your wife he was coming back you told your husband you was coming back how do you know it was faith that told you that praise god hallelujah isn't that right calm and simple isn't that right he said in the old testament when the blood was applied on the door he said i'm told it was put on by hyssop dipped in the blood and rubbed over the door isn't that right his up is common weed and that is how it was applied by his up by something you could reach down anywhere and just grab a handful of it without even half trying isn't that right how appropriate that is and tonight to apply hyssop as fate he said you put the blood on by faith and how we're covered by the blood by fate by common fate holly branham said well you say but miracles and for healing brother branham is it some different type of fate no he said it's the same faith oh hallelujah he said there's only one faith and all good things and all and all good things and all things that are original a original fate hey many men isn't that right amen amen hallelujah glory to god amen amen isn't that right okay let me skip down here he said now faith is not a myth it's something that you actually possess like this it's a substance isn't that right amen he said if i had he said if i was starving and you come to me and said i'm starving hallelujah uh you say what would you give for your life i'd say well i want a loaf of bread the prophet said well you go into your pocket you'd pull out 25 cents or how much ever he said and you'd hand it to me and say here you are brother mr branham you don't have to starve he said well i might not have the bread yet but i got the purchase power of the bread oh hallelujah is that right now i may be a mile away from the bread but i can be just as happy with that quarter in my hand oh hell is when i got the brain in my hand because i've got the purchasing power of the bread oh isn't that right and when faith speaks to your soul and tell you something's gonna happen something's gonna take place you might as well rejoice because it's going to happen you've got the purchase and power tonight oh raise up your hands hallelujah oh and give god glory give him honor thank him because it's going to happen it's got to happen thank him in advance oh our faith already claims it to be so oh hallelujah hallelujah hey man amen isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah glory glory hallelujah the prophet says an astounding thing here let me back up a little bit he said now we know that man cannot move a mountain just by speaking to it he was talking about that reference scripture he said if you say to this mountain we move and don't doubt in your heart isn't that right he said now you didn't know that man can't move a mountain just by speaking to it he said the only thing you could do what would that that would be deity so then he said if the mountain let me say that again the only thing that could do that would be deity to move that mountain he said so then if the mountain is before us here's what he said and our objective is right and our motive is right then it isn't us speaking anymore it's deity that's speaking then it has to move oh hallelujah so when you line up with the word of god for your season and time it'll mean no more you speaking but it'll be deity speaking through you and in you hallelujah professor in the face that you claim to have hallelujah demonstrating on the spot here it is here it is hallelujah glory to god deity speaking through you oh isn't that then he said it has to move then he says i truly believe that the church is on the brink of one of the greatest outpourings that it has ever had in this age he said i believe it oh hallelujah hallelujah he said it's just something he said i can't say the lord told me but he said just something inside me just catching a hold of something that i haven't seen all my life until just now he said i don't know how glorious it is to know that just before the coming of the lord that these things are happening oh my hallelujah glory to god amen do you believe it tonight oh do you believe there's something coming forth from the lord that god's speaking to outpour his spirit one more time oh hallelujah he said now faith always experience an experience always a company's fate yes amen an experience always accompanies faith and how could it be tonight he said he said what good does it do to preach a bible uh of a god i could heal of a god that's got power isn't it and tell the people that the days of miracles has passed what good does it do to send ministers to seminaries and colleges and learn all these different things and then come tell the people that something that was isn't anymore he said what does it do it's just like taking a man that's freezing to death and say here's a nice picture of a big painted fire he said the man cannot get warm by a painted fire he is freezing he's got to have warmth oh hallelujah he has to have present tense warmth isn't that right and a man that's thirsting for god cannot be satisfied until something happens he said it's an experience oh hallelujah glory to god i feel religious now it's an experience oh it comes by experience it comes by fire oh hallelujah glory to god oh that kind of an experience he said it'll bring forth great faith oh hallelujah you'll never know what it is he said you cannot trust a god you've never met oh that's powerful hallelujah some people they say they know about god but do you know him in the power of his resurrection have you felt it have you felt a mantle drop on you do you know what it is oh you might know the blessings of god but you don't know the power of god when it strikes you oh hallelujah when it struck the prophet he was numb for days all in the presence of that angel oh hallelujah but brother you've got an appointment to meet that angel personally tonight oh and have an experience oh then you'll know what you're talking about then you'll know who you're praying to it'll be an experience in your soul oh hallelujah from eternity to eternity hallelujah glory to connie man oh hallelujah hallelujah he said a man ain't qualified to stand behind the platform until he's met god and had an experience no person he said has the right to call himself a christian until first they had an experience with god he said that's right it was abraham he said he was just an ordinary man that came down and dwelt in in china down in the city of earth he was just an ordinary believer but one day remember scripture where we read tonight abraham he said one day god met him and he spoke to him and abraham had an experience and after abraham had that experience he could tell sarah go buy the birdie praise corn buddha get all the pins ready isn't that right we're going to have a baby i don't care how old you are amen isn't that right see why he had an experience first of talking face to face with god and he could call those things which you're not as though they were oh hallelujah after he had met god after he had an experience oh hallelujah a supernatural faith a spiritual thing isn't that right not before it it was uh that's what mattered with the people tonight in this big cities all the cities in the world it's because they refuse to receive the holy spirit he says oh my your methodist you baptist you presbyterian catholic said you're human beings and christ died for you and you've got just as much right to these blessings as a pentecostal house he said but the only thing it is that you just have to sign your name on a book a church book instead of saying this instead of staying there until you've got that experience that god has changed you by the baptism of the holy ghost he says it takes an experience to accompany faith he said and you know where you've been why david know what he's talking about when he met god hallelujah and the backside of the desert oh isn't that right the same god of delivering me from the bear what was his testimony the same god that he lived me from the lion is the same god i will deliver this philistine into my hands he knew that god is ru real he had a bear to prove it he had a deadline to prove it that that that chord was real oh he was real with the pair he was real with the lion and he's real with goliath he's real tonight he's real in your situation he's real in your heart wielding your soul reeling your trial oh hallelujah hallelujah don't you worry oh he is there all the time even though you don't feel him it's the only thing that can contact him is your fetch that reaches out like a receptacle and pulls a signal of god wherever you are tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory glory amen oh my hallelujah glory glory amen brother sister hallelujah isn't that right knows what he's talking about hallelujah abraham he waited 25 years until our baby was born why he had an experience of meeting god isn't that right brother sister he said there's a secret place that every believer should go on the backside of the desert he said there on those sacred sands oh i love it he said oh no doctor of theology no greek no hebrew scholar no school no seminary they might twist you up in all kinds of things but if you ever met god on them sacred sands satan cannot put his feet on those hands oh my hallelujah hear what he's saying here he said you know you met god something is real what is it you talk to god yourself you had an experience oh hallelujah no man is the right take the pulpit he said unless he's gotten on the backside of there's an experience no man no person has the right to call himself a christian until he had a backside of the desert experience oh god give us that experience tonight oh give us that experience that goes past the flesh past your spirit deep down in the soul something happens something takes place oh holla anchors that fate in there oh hallelujah that proves that you're accepted in the beloved isn't that right the dark sky is another sign of disapproval oh the bright sky is another sign of his approval his approval is the acceptance of the beloved oh therefore he can take you to the dark skies he can take you to the sunny times he can take you up the mountain down the valley it's all the same pray i'll praise him all the same he's the god of the mountain he's the god of the valley too he's a god of your circumstance god of your trial he's a god right where you are tonight whatever you need tonight reach up in faith and claim it hallelujah and say every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line everything christ died for i'm here to receive it i'm here to speak it i'm here to claim it by faith say to this mountain be there for remove and beat our gas into the sea and believe that what you spoke from your heart you shall have it tonight oh it belongs to you it belongs to you tonight reach up and claim it hallelujah grab ahold of that fate hey many man glory to god hallelujah hey many man oh my my my my my my hallelujah he said oh my they've got to be in the backside of the desert experience it's still the back side of the desert he said but we call it upper room oh my it's still about out of the desert too he said it's where you meet god oh how ridiculous it is tonight to take people in the church just by baptizing the water putting their name on a book oh but he said we need an old fashioned saint paul's revival he said in a bible holy ghost right into the church again and a real old-fashioned meeting an experience he said after you had experience then you know what you're talking about oh hallelujah praise god you're not hoping so not maybe so but it's real amen amen how do you know you met god amen said satan can't put his dirty feet on that place you know you've talked to somebody there you know something happened yes sir you were there you know all about it and from then on he said you can go and conduct yourself like a real christian hey many men is the anointing that makes a difference it teaches you how to walk in jesus name oh because the anointing is in you nobody have to walk next to you to make sure you're doing the right thing saying the right thing huh making sure you're forgiven making sure you repented no the spirit is teaching you showing you how to repent showing you how to make it right oh hallelujah that's what makes a difference e many man from the marriage of the lamb but i've read this so many times but i'll read it again tonight it seems so fitting he said so many says if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or gambling or from lying or stealing he said i'll serve him he said but that's up to you see you got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome shall inherit oh hallelujah you got to put your faith out there hallelujah risk it all all right for this glorious gospel risk it all hallelujah sell all that you have and follow after him tonight oh he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him oh damn that given 110 oh hallelujah give all amen he said data overcomes and inherit all things they that overcome you see you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she has made herself ready i like that word he says so you couldn't push us through a little pipe and pull us out on the other end and then say blessed is he that overcome it you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself isn't that right he said i have to make decisions for myself he said and in doing that we show all faith and respects to god oh hallelujah you make a conscious decision hallelujah whether i maintain my family or a lot let me maintain christ you make a decision to stand hello to stay to abide oh hallelujah let this life of christ live in me hallelujah honey you make a clear solid decision tonight oh although he's slimy yet i'll trust him oh i'll do it seven times hotter i will not bow down you make a decision oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god he said and in doing that we show office and respects of god amen that's how you show it by doing something not by talking about it not by explaining it away but by actually doing something about it making a decision going out there proving it isn't that right abraham was promised a child but he maintained his promise for 25 years he said ups and downs he had oh it wasn't always good days he had aches and pains just like you you have diabetes high blood pressure this that all kind of thing praise god but he's waiting on his body change he's waiting on his change to come and you know god would not lie hallelujah the god that spoke the word to him shall surely visit him and his wife sarah and they're gonna have that son oh hallelujah it didn't matter what he felt didn't matter what the doctor said whatever god says was true and he held faster that for 25 years isn't that right temptations all kinds of things in those 25 years but he held with the word of promise so says the scriptures isn't that right and israel was promised a land but they had to fight for every inch of it the prophet said wherever the souls of your foot treads upon that have i given you god said to joshua it was all there the land was all there all the blessings is all there god gave it to them but they had to fight for it oh all the promises is here all the blessings is here only the prophet already spoke it it's already laying out there hallelujah all of the evidence of the new land has already preached to you hallelujah isn't that right but they have to fight for it he said and that's the same way it is about divine healing god's got the power to heal you but you've got to have the courage to accept it oh by faith hallelujah you said you've got to fight every inch of the way oh isn't that right he said god god amazing grace to save you he'll do it but you'll fight every inch of your way he said i've been behind a pulpit 31 years and every inch of it has been a fight constantly oh what are you going to do you're going to sit back you're going to give up oh brother this is another time for giving up this is not a time for throwing in the towel if brother branham had to fight and he was a prophet for the age how about you and i tonight oh you've got something to fight for you've got to fight and you've got something to fight for brother i'm fighting for the holy ghost i'm feeling very valuable hey man what about that white woman huh she fought her way to the prom seven thunder seats for a seven thunder revival oh however every seat shall bring forth after its kind oh hallelujah oh hallelujah glory to god amen we know in whom we have believed amen isn't that right oh and god is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises oh hallelujah glory to god amen isn't that right hallelujah the prophet dropped off another bomb here uh amen he said abraham was was represented the elected church living poor out in the deserts and so forth he said but notice just before the destruction of sodom there was an angel come to him isn't that right he said an angel was talking to abraham oh i was wondering why the lord showed me genesis 18. here it is it ties right in here now oh hallelujah praise god amen our angel talked to abraham and his back turned to the tenth sarah was on the inside of the tent an angel told to abraham i'll visit you according to the time of life and sarah in her heart laughed inside of the tent and the angel with his back to and said why did sarah laugh what kind of telepathy was that isn't that right he said remember that angel now he says he is what he says that angel had the last message not before the water fell but before the fire fell he said who was that angel he said it was christ he said abraham called him elohim jehovah almighty the logos he said sure prophet says he said he was god he said here is his is now here the prophet said just before the destruction of fire again he said that same angel is amongst his people today oh hallelujah revelation 10 down come a mighty angel the prophet is gone but is his angel gone no he's still here doing the same things hallelujah oh brother that fire is fixed into fall just before the fire fell down come the angel and revelation 10 says a mighty angel came down from heaven clothed a cloud rainbow upon his head oh hallelujah utter those voices brother that voices went forth to find you to find me to call a bride to a revival or to wake up the dead in christ to give a faith for great translation hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh that same angel the prophet said is amongst the people today calling to the church members come out from among them get away from it quickly she's going to sink just as certain oh hallelujah that angel is here tonight oh that's how we know that the fire is fixing the fall because that angel will come just before the firefight oh halloween we know fire's gonna fall praise god in this season oh i like the same rain that rose noah's boat is what drown the people praise god in the same dynamics we're calling for is what's going to judge the people today well it's fire fall in time oh hallelujah the morning comet and does the night also oh isn't that right the morning comes for you the night for the unbeliever but for you oh hallelujah glory up to glory wave after wave of his presence picking you up taking you to a rapture a blessed home in the skies isn't that right oh i'm running out of time my god do you believe it tonight hallelujah pregnant oh hallelujah right do you see it hey man he says here on uh praise god he says god of civil age yeah he said the body is waiting for the word which is the spirit of life to confirm it and make it alive and that's what she is waiting for he says no other life will work in her she can't come to life any other way yet she feels it out there she knows it's going to happen faith see that little woman and then there happens she wakes up and god says let there be and she come forth just like the first one comfort hey manny man isn't that right oh my i'm getting ready to close now amen oh we made it oh it feels good amen let me just come through now here the prophet said on a message here time tested the memorials of god he said not long ago here down in australia he said under the british crown like south africa and stuff like that he gives a background here he says they talk about a bridge that they wanted to build from north sydney to south sydney he said and they call over to the country to get architects to build this bridge bridge builders to come now and build this bridge he said but none of them would take it no one would dare take it and as soon as they got there they found out that the bottom of that sea was shifting sands and it was quicksands and stuff nothing would stand on that foundation they tested it and sounded went on and so on and said we wouldn't believe we'd be able to undertake to build such a bridge he said it cannot be done so after a while a young architect the prophet said come up from england uh come down famous man reputable man he had a good reputation prophet said oh i like that i like a man with a reputation you don't have to be a big man you can be a pauper that lives in an alley and have a reputation far better than a potentate absolutely he says and you don't have to be rich you can just have a reputation oh hallelujah right it'll declare your reputation will declare what you are it makes you what you are it gives you a good reputation isn't that right said you know my reputation okay so he says this man went down here with a wonderful reputation look the situation over walked the banks for a few days and stuff like that when he finished the vein he said i'll take the job why he said sir you know what you're doing he said i thoroughly understand oh my he was completely sure isn't that right he said well this great architect uh american architects all over the world bridge builders they say they're afraid of the job that's the feedback he's getting is that right praise god he said but sir i'm not afraid of the job he said i'll take it he said amen he said i realize i have a reputation and stuff like that he said but i'll take it prophet said he had a vision oh holly said before a man can make a reputation he has to have a vision of what he is doing oh isn't that right the bible said without a vision the people perish that's why god sent us a prophet to show us a vision of how to build oh hallelujah how to build halal how god will rebuild this church in the power of the spirit oh not by my not by power oh holly it's a vision all i need to put the materials together to also make a church that'll make a revival oh hallelujah isn't that right he said oh blessed be the lord that's the reason there's a heaven to go to that's the reason we can have reputation as a christian we know what material is in this building oh hallelujah that's right it's the blood of jesus christ in that building that's right he's staying his blood washed away all the stains took me from the alleys of hell and made me his servant he said and then i believe him isn't that right it's not right the prophet amen the bible said he that luck of these things are blind hallelujah and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins but when god pours these virtues into you faith knowledge temperance patience callingness hallelujah isn't that right what is it he's building a building in you tonight or with the right materials to make the right stature the statue of a perfect man oh he the divine architect hallelujah glory to god is building a building tonight oh he is this great builder he is the master builder tonight amen oh hallelujah god almighty isn't that right he said when man did it the first thing he did he went down there he said now to get this bridge started he said what we got to do we got to build a solid foundation music get ready he said we got to go he said we knew that down beneath had sand and the earth on down there stuff like that but but beyond the sand was solid rock is basically what the prophet said here so he said he got in there and got great tubes down and he began to blow away the shifting's hand with some pumps until he blew it palm down to solid rock and when he got on the rock he anchored them great big bolts in there and got it ready oh and he blowed out each one praise god amen hallelujah got down to a foundation hallelujah a foundation of faith isn't that right lori then he went over got around him got the very best architects he could find best scientists and stuff like that still talking about the building he said oh what a memorial it would be to this reputation of this bridge builder isn't that right praise god hallelujah hallelujah amen he said and the prophet said uh uh long ago they had smelters they used to take gold he said and they would know if it was right or not and all the sludge was out of it and stuff like that he said unless it was fool's gold he said but all the fool was out of it he said why because the beaters they beat it he said and he beat it and turned it and beat it and turned it until the beta see his own reflection in the gold oh hallelujah isn't that right and the prophet said that's the way he does his church he gives you trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test until the life of christ is reflecting in your life for hallelujah until you become peaceful sober meek galatians five isn't that right gentle humble ready amen submissive willing to turn your head on the things of the world looking straight to calvary oh hallelujah to the one who's doing the beating my god oh we're not talking about the devil we're talking about god taking you to the wilderness taking you through your trial taking you to your testing beating beating beating until he gets the world out of you then you are tan tested then your faith is tried by fire oh hallelujah is worth a better thing than gold until silver that perishes what is gold character is not a gift it's a victory oh hallelujah hallelujah amen amen oh my he said he's the one doing the beating many times you think it's strange because fiery trials and sicknesses and persecutions but it's only done to test you to get the dirt and sludge out of you to get the slowness out of you to wake you up to the place where you can look and see the reflection or a man see the reflection of christ in you christ in you the hope of glory hallelujah he talks about the bridge so he said they tested it and it stood praise god he said it got some locomotives brought it out on the bridge brother and that bridge when it was built it stood it's not it's to the test of time hallelujah glory to god brother when the bands went playing and the whistles went blowing he said it was an awful vibration but when he walked across that bridge she never moved hallelujah praise god and he said jesus christ came from heaven the glory the glory come down down here what to do to build a church and the material that he is putting in it is time-tested material oh hallelujah we've struck it glory hallelujah what is he doing he's building a church tonight and the material he's using is not wishy-washy it's not something from somewhere it's not some substitute substitute there's not some counterfeit count of each no no no but it's time tested time tested material oh faith was tested in poor hallelujah was tested in the airiness none of the tested in martin it was tested it was tested it was tested and in this age we have seven living voices that's been tested throughout the ages

enemy in every age oh hallelujah oh i feel like shouting now oh i feel like dancing now hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen [Music] the material that he's putting in you is time-tested material he said you might come to the altar and make a confession oh hollywood when you can't stand he just pitches you to one side but what god wants is a time-tested church not somebody as a christian today and a backslider tomorrow he can't place you nowhere but he's got to go to church he's got to get a christian nurse that went through the trials that went through losses that went through sickness to sorrow to death until stand with the testimony oh hallelujah oh give him a shout out oh that's the man yes sir that's the man he's looking for the prophet said i don't care if you're a papa i don't care if you're a beggar you can play something softly if you're a rag picker whatever you are god puts the test to you oh he's looking tonight for time tested material oh hallelujah glory to god i feel so privileged happy i.e when trials come your way why time tested time proven hallelujah i believe one of these days our great church said old prophet said oh now i feel religious he said let me tell you the prophet knocked the puppet he said that time tested church will come into existence someday oh he knocks apartment again he says there may be half of them sleeping in the dust of the earth he said i don't know where they are at but god's got his material all tested and one day he's coming to take the forefront he said follow me right through the atmospheres right through the stratospheres and the spheres on stairs and spheres into the presence of almighty god he will go with a time-tested church that's a memorial to his grace that's a memorial that god gives him may the
