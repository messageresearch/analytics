ministry and the Ministry of perfection they have which is God given a man we give God all the glory and the praise hallelujah well today I want to bring a thought to you and I brought some slides along maybe the brothers will help me to get them going for you and I would like us to stand as we go straight to the scriptures and I have a selection of scriptures which it is my prayer that they will be inspiring to you in this great inspiration they that sow in tears shall reap in joy a man and it's a very very special inspiration to me I wanted to start in the book of Genesis chapter 47 because we're talking about seed today seed in the days of Joseph was the most valuable commodity it was almost a currency in itself it was worth more than money practically and and I hope we feel the same way today that these seeds are so precious shall we say exceedingly precious amen Jose is Genesis 47 and then Joe and 23 then Joseph said unto the people behold I have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and you shall sow the land praise the Lord sow the seed and they're sewing it Joseph never did it you have to sow and Hosea 10:12 goes on to say so to yourselves in righteousness reap in mercy break up your fallow ground for it is time to seek the Lord till he come and reign righteousness upon you Amos 8:11 behold the days come saith the Lord that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst of water but of hearing the words hearing the words of the Lord let's go on to acts 3 6 then Peter said silver and gold have I none hmm but such as I have I give thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk let's close with Galatians 3:16 Thank You brothers now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made and is safe not seeds and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ Lord Jesus we want to thank you just for this honor to speak about your word and Lord to get behind Malachi for as your word has taught us and but the Branham picked up this great statement it is God's law to receive a vindicated servant and Lord Jesus we thank you for Malachi 4 in this season we see the vindication we see how you've worked with him we see the perfect sounding of his message God we just can't thank you enough that we have been called by this voice of the seventh angel God we give you glory and we give you praise today be with us in these few words may they bring great encouragement in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you can't be seen it says God bless you I've got a title I'm trying to harmonize and synchronize with the inspiration today which is sowing and reaping and I've just chosen a title oh here is seed amen and we know that one of the greatest messages brother Branham preached on seed is the spoken word is the original seed praise be to God and we are just gonna touch on this great scenario which happened in in Genesis 47 where I tell you the famine you can't say they were surprised because Joseph was under a kind of eagle anointing where he knew it was coming he knew there would be good time and he knew there would be a bad time after that and that Eagle anointing prepared him for that bad time to come and Joseph put all that seed into storage and we've been told the same thing by brother Branham to store up the food amen in your car you should be having the tapes playing amen if you go online you should be looking at what the Prophet is saying don't waste your good years spend your good year as well get into the messages spent your time praying spend your time going through the books and spend your time just storing up and when you think you've got enough store up some more and add some more and some more you will never have enough of this message praise the Lord and what you store will become spiritual food in due season there's coming a time when when everybody is crying amen when the pressure comes down something is going to rise up in you the world will never understand it but God is already on the job now are you glad for Malachi 4 can you wave your hand and say Amen hallelujah to God be the glory I'm going to go my first slide brother at the back there and I'm taking a quote just to start with the the seed is not air with the shock and I want to start with this Luther went to husk with his first word that just shall live by faith Wesley had two words amen and it was sanctification the second work of grace Pentecost had the third word the restoration of the gifts Amen so that was the three that came but the entire seed has to come forth the entire seed and I'm so glad for this message which is the entire seed of God amen brother Branham called at the end time seed sign when you see the seed come only in this time can we say lo here is seed for you because the end time has produced the entire seed Luther couldn't do that Luther could only preach justification Moosa could only say lo here is justification he was surrounded by Catholicism but he said here I stand so help me God here I stand by faith alone solo today he stood and all Luther to say is no here is justification or Wesley could say is lo here is sanctification a man that's all he had he never knew the things that were coming later but he said lo here is sanctification and he and the spirit roared through him lo here they call them Methodists but he said lo it is living right the pentacle they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they said lo here is the Holy Ghost here is the new birth here is baptism in Jesus Christ's name here's the gifts of the Spirit but they weren't there yet because there was coming one more stage and we can say in this age though here is seed for you from Malachi for it is precious seed hallelujah it is great seed exceedingly precious praise be to God I'm so glad just to know these things we living in the seed age hallelujah who can show them into these things hallelujah glory be to the name of the Lord amen that's what we are with we are a seed people we have the entirety of the seed the entirety you know you can take one drop of water out of the sea and that drop of water contains the whole ocean hallelujah even though it's only one drop but every element of the ocean is in that one drop and I tell you the seed that Malachi 4 is giving us brother it's got everything in it everything you need is in it even rapturing faith is in that seed hallelujah glory to God rapturing faith is inside there hey man if you need a healing it's in there if you need deliverance is in there if you need the Holy Ghost it's in there hallelujah by these promises you shall become like God Himself praise the Lord glory be seated for a moment spoken word is the original seed what I'm trying to say to you this is the law of reproduction and then to bring forth of its kind in these last days the true church bride the true church bride and it doesn't just stay back and say well Branham was a great man true even the Pope knows that even the Pope knows that but the true bride comes to the headstone it will be a super Church can I hear a super Amen super hallelujah a man next to you is a super brother a super sister hallelujah tell them my super brother super Church super race hallelujah my momma I feel good brother okay super sign super bright super message hallelujah I feel a super address right here tonight brother hallelujah the devil is finished already we have a super message for him it is written it is written hallelujah god bless you hallelujah can't you see some I want to move quickly the seed the seed life is different to the plant life the seed life is a is a powerful life a man the plant ends with a shock because the seed is the next plant praise the Lord it says super race as she nears the headstone there'll be so much like him they'll even be in his very image hallelujah follow me brothers thank you George IRA says we know that a seed when it falls in the right kind of ground not upon rocks that's all gone now nor in thorns and thistles it would choke it out but in good rich fertile faith do you hear what I said first our faith I can feel fertile faith tonight hallelujah I can feel somebody say Amen that's the word first our faith amen glory like Rahab she had first our faith she received the messengers she applied the token she made peace with Joshua hallelujah God bless you I'm so happy to be in Enugu I feel fertile thank you tonight hallelujah BIRT our faith anything from the Bible you say Amen anything from the message say preacher we want to know what the prophets hear the Prophet said it we believe it that settles it shout Amen somebody hallelujah glory oh I feel so happy tonight he's so glad to be here hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen so now that's the reason Amen because this for our faith understands mysteries it understands mysteries that's the reason in quick Q&A nineteen amen I think it anyway 4:03 that's the reason these great mysteries could not be given to Lucifer could not be given to Wesley could not be given to the age that has just gone by the Pentecostal age Amen that was previous Amen now cover your shout now hallelujah the person of Christ Himself the son of man you understand revealing himself in human flesh it could not have come until now I'm so glad to be alive now I'm so glad to be with you now because now faith is faith is now hallelujah we can praise the Lord now hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah hey man take a seat as I finish the sort of platform here he says the bride according to masterpiece returns back in the last days I will restore saith the Lord a man he said that's he said that's the reason she was in review second time he said she was reviewed second time she was perfectly second time as she was first time said God have mercy hurry hurry hurry life getting the grain aha getting the grain if anybody hears playing games with double life hurry get in the grain if anybody here playing Church hurry hurry hurry get in the grain don't play games soon we'll be leaving here the world is changing the world is changing we're not just going to stay here we have to have rapturing faith but it's in the messages shout amen as you find your seats hallelujah thank you lord I don't care what they try to do with this message the Bible says it is incorruptible seed there's no preacher can corrupt the seed it is incorruptible hallelujah after two thousand years this seed is incorruptible they can say this they can say that they can see the other but the seed is incorruptible shout incorruptible God bless you amen amen amen hallelujah something is going on but devil can't stop it amen he can't corrupted because he won't deceive the elect and we're not like Eve we will say brother that's not what the prophet says you can't corrupt the seed the seed is incorruptible hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah spoken word is the original seed amen it says now the Gentile dispensation is to be finished when this anointed messenger arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible from the seventh to the messenger in the former rain aren't you glad this Messenger William Marion Brennan has plotted the entire seed of the Bible you have the entire seed of the Bible a man brother we can hold our heads up high Amen we can tell the devil the entire seed is in my soul tonight hallelujah glory to God amen all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into the bride hallelujah hallelujah amen he planted the entire Bible praise the Lord third seal I want you to be sure God promised Eve a time would come when the word would be restored by seed this word itself would become seed and we are sowing this seed and we're going to reap in joy now the whole Bible has become seed hallelujah that means it is now portable it has now become a plantable seed and it's in your heart and Satan can't stop it and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies hallelujah there's a seed in you my brother hallelujah it shall possess every Katy praise the Lord can we shout hallelujah glory to God hey man this word would become seed but pains these men if they pick this up and go out with it they can make more sense to it a man to bring it to a place me I just want to lay the seed Amen I just want to lay this brother I just want to lay the seed then hope they will make it come to life who wants to make this come to life hallelujah I want to make this come to life I want to see it Enugu the seed coming to life I want to preach this message I want to shout this message I want to leave this message until it starts to take life and to live in me they won't see Branham but they'll see the Jesus Christ in his people hallelujah and they will take knowledge that you have been with Jesus influence 1963 what we've seen happen should put every soul in action are you in action today what we've seen should put every soul in action who can shout amen to that one hallelujah every soul in action it should make a church that would make a revival here in Phoenix till the people would be flying in from Europe to see what taken place they say there's a place in Arizona called Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix there's something that is broken out there it could be a new girl he said Maricopa Valley but it could be a new girl it could be your church back home but this is gonna break out hallelujah Amen this is something broke out to the seven thunders of Revelation there's not even wrote in the Bible is being manifested hallelujah brother something's gonna break out they won't even understand it we won't be quoting we will be speaking the Word of God hallelujah because the word is going to take life hallelujah this is the seed take take a seat for a moment there was a there was a unep that had so much he was working on a queen Candace but he came to Jerusalem to worship but he came to Jerusalem and he he left Jerusalem a bit wandering and he took his Bible and he went into a portion of Isaiah and at the same time God was working an angel was directing someone and he sat there what does this mean and Philip came up to him and said these words I understand this now what you're reading do you understand so it's not just he had the Bible he had the written word hey man he didn't know what he was reading he said who is this man what's the prophet talking of himself or was he talking about another one and Philip was listening and Philip said lo this is geez that we're talking about it and he gave him the seed and he baptized the eunuch and by the time he finished baptism the unit came to thank him and Philip was gone because he did his work hallelujah let me read before the brown said he said although an angel directed Philip to him but the germ of life had to come through the body Philip or brother we're on the line now where the germ come from through the angel no the angel showed him where to go an angel is a messenger but here is a son Philip had the germ the message the word that's how a child can be born hallelujah Church I'm so glad for this seed that we have we're not only reading the Bible but we're understanding what it's saying Alleluia we have the word but we have the understanding also hallelujah praise be to God Church this is a very great thing you can have the Bible here but about the prophecy of spoken word is the original seed the Bible has got to be in you the word is a seed as long as it's laying here it won't do nothing but when it comes in here then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit the works of God then visions come power comes humility comes all your know-it-all is gone hallelujah because it's not about it being here you can't say well I've got a Bible it's got to be inside here hallelujah I put a picture up there if you if you catch it amen about Jesus walking on the road to Emmaus Church the disciples were walking with him and he said didn't our hearts burn within us because the word was already inside here and when Christ spoke there it is their hearts was burning because the word was already inside there it was reviving the word that was already in there hallelujah while Jesus was just walking he didn't tell them who he was but their heart was burning and burning and burning Church the precious seeds had been sold and that's what it is all about Feast of Trumpets keep walking and watch more unfold don't leave it no matter what somebody else says stay in that keep walking with that watch it unfold and reveal itself because the word is a seed and a seed in the right kind of brown will bring forth its kind hallelujah that is the law of reproduction hallelujah praise the Lord for these quotations and brother Branham goes on in power to transform it says if you want to go in the rapture plant it in your heart who wants to go in the rapture plant it in your heart because inside that seed is rupturing faith amen amen if if you want to go in the rapture planted in your heart if you want to be Christians place that word I believe it was Ezekiel said take that scroll and eat it eat it up the word may be bitter but Ethan anyway it will change you praise be to God if you want to go in the rapture eat that word get that word on the inside praise be to God that's why we're so glad he said in spoken word here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name praise God she has thus saith the Lord then it is germanized the Holy Spirit waters it until it serves its purpose praise be to God that's what's going on church something is inside here and but ever can do nothing about it it's already happened this world is changing even you you look at what your children tell you when they come home from school the age of Sodom is here you hardly know what to say to your kids because the world is changing because of the media and they're behind everything they don't only preach tolerance but they are evangelizing the subject the world is changing in the days of Joseph the money was failing now I'm not gonna say the money is failing now but times are changing everybody know what what 2008 was when even Lehman Brothers collapsed just like that the times are changing IT is changing ID your identification is changing even artificial intelligence is changing even the way you you study now you better know what the future is holding for you before you even start to study because when you get there you find a robot is doing your job for you the world is changing you need the Eagle anointing in your life to prepare you this world is changing hallelujah you need something in your life now just like Joseph knew something was going to change but he knew to prepare and to store up the food and some days some days you see young people they spend more time online than even in the world may it change tonight that is my burden tonight that this message might become precious until you spend more time in the message than on whatsapp Facebook all these things that you that you think are precious they're not precious the Bible is precious the word is precious the promises are precious hallelujah that's what's precious I pray that even tonight you will say Lord let me not call anything else precious but this message this message is more than life this message is gonna save you and your family I know other things are important but this is the most important thing precious seed precious seed the world is changing next year the world will be even more this message is going to save your life this message is your parachute it's gonna save you hurry get into the grain get into the word hallelujah it is precious we can take your seats for a moment I won't be long with you every word in the Bible is God's thoughts and laid in seed form this is from the India trip he says and if that is received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible it brings the thing to pass you see what I mean how powerful which the church could be the Bible said let the mind that was in Christ be in you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he now your thoughts if they become expression like God said let there be a world there was nothing there but God said let there be a world hallelujah and I don't care what you're facing but if you can say let there be no cancer the cancer will go out of existence let there be no sickness will go out of existence let there be no demonic bondage it will go out of existence because you have the mind of Christ and in your heart as you think so shall you be can you shout Amen somebody glory to God hallelujah who is thinking I'm gonna make the rapture who is thinking I'm gonna be adopted hallelujah you shall be praise the Lord amen let me wind up here he says if you ask me for an oak tree and I give you an acorn potentially you have an oak tree because it's in seed form if you want and when you want God in your life just accept him as your Savior potentially you are a full stature son of God you will grow into the stature of God like the Acorn grows into the oak tree praise the Lord I want you to catch this over here now but when you sow a seed don't dig it up every morning to see if it's germinating don't dig it up to see leave it there God is going to take care of it hey man leave it there hallelujah huh you can spend your time saying thank you Jesus don't dig it up amen it will bring forth of its kind all you've got it don't know is the revelation of water who has the revelation of water the Bride of Christ like Rebecca she had the revelation of water she knew to give water to the camp camels and you have the revelation of water that the seed needs water to carry you to the rapture shall Amen hallelujah when you sow a seed be seated when you sow a seed don't dig it up every morning if you do your seed will never come up you've got a plant it this is in the Church of the Living God you've got to plant it commit it to the earth leave it alone it's up to nature and God you have to water it and that's the only way accepted in a good heart already fertilized all the creepers and rocky places and stony doubts taken away in the rich soil of faith and committed to God commit that to God and walk away testifying because he is the high priest of your profession he is the high priest of what you say when you sow that seed you've got a profess God is gonna bring that seat of us hallelujah that's your profession the high priest will take care of your profession shout Amen somebody hallelujah hey man who believes they're gonna make it hallelujah tell your neighbor your parents say I am gonna make it tell your neighbor I am gonna make it by the grace of God hallelujah I'm gonna make it brother so much Alleluia amen praise God you're gonna make it brother something greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world hallelujah hey man is the word in you are you ready now I'm winding down now are you ready are you ready now it says in the message possessing the enemy's gates if you're ready he says in the church LAist power to heal all disease can you shut him into that in you there's a power to heal all diseases hallelujah in the Church of the Living God lays the power to overcome all temptation can I hear amen to that to overcome all temptation in the possession of the church lays the power to change sin and to throw it away can you throw it away let me see you throw it away unbelief goodbye hallelujah you can throw it away because it's in the church now it's in the church right now you can throw away sin whatever you ask in my name it shall be given to you praise the Lord hallelujah okay be seated while I just close up here we see did God bless you so much Abraham election this is paradox you know Isaac calling Jacob Grace Joseph perfection there

hallelujah I feel so happy nothing can keep you down there he will turn your captivity here one day you're a prisoner then you're in charge in the book of Acts one day Paul and Silas we're prisoners but God turn their captivity why because they began to sing they began to shout they forgot to worship God they began to sing and say Oh God you can turn our captivity hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah then there was an earthquake and the big soldier that was holding them captive he came in Moore said don't hurt yourself don't hurt yourself and in the same night he was saying what must I do to be saved the same night Paul was preaching to his family and the same night he was washing their wounds hallelujah God can turn your captivity he can get you out of any prison they that sow in tears
