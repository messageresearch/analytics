[8:55] inspired draw closer to you granted
[8:58] father in Jesus and we ask you tonight
[9:01] wanna turn to one portion of Scripture
[9:02] for people's chapter level wanna read a
[9:05] couple of verses dear when we verse 1
[9:07] then 100 to 500 until he 1 to 40 Hebrews
[9:11] chapter 11 verse 1 now faith is the
[9:16] substance of things hoped for the
[9:17] evidence of things not seen
[9:20] verse 5 by faith Enoch was translated
[9:24] that he should not see death
[9:26] I was not found because God had
[9:29] translated him but for before his
[9:33] translation he had this testimony that
[9:36] he pleased God our old faith is
[9:38] impossible to please him for he that
[9:40] cometh to God must believe that he is
[9:43] and that is a rewarder of them that
[9:46] diligently seek Him as belong to verse
[9:50] 31
[9:55] my feet the holiday huh
[9:59] yo stop with the harlot and so unlike
[10:02] Rhea but is my feet by feet the
[10:05] hallelujah perish not with them that
[10:07] believe no when she had received the
[10:09] spies with peace what shall i must see
[10:13] for the time would feel me to tell of
[10:16] gideon of barack of samson of Jeff Todd
[10:19] of David also signer of the prophets who
[10:21] to feed subdue kingdoms wrought
[10:24] righteousness obtained promises stopped
[10:27] the mouths of lions quenched the
[10:29] violence of the fire escaped the edge of
[10:32] the sword out of weakness were made
[10:35] strong rocks violent and fight tuned to
[10:40] flight the armies of the Indians women
[10:43] received their dead raised the life
[10:45] again
[10:45] others were tortured not accepting
[10:47] deliverance that they might obtain a
[10:50] better resurrection others a trial of
[10:52] cruel mockings and squadrons here
[10:54] moreover of bonds imprisonment they were
[10:57] stoned they were sawn asunder were
[10:59] tempted were slain with the sword they
[11:02] wandered about in sheepskins and
[11:03] goatskins being destitute afflicted
[11:07] tormented of whom the world was not
[11:09] worthy they wandered in deserts and
[11:11] mountains and dense caves of the earth
[11:14] and these all having obtained a good
[11:16] report through faith received not the
[11:18] promise God having provided some better
[11:20] things for us the day without us should
[11:24] not be made perfect may God blesses
[11:25] woody would be seated I want to take a
[11:29] title from verse 34 we said quenched the
[11:33] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[11:36] sword out of weakness were made strong
[11:38] rocks fear and in fight to deflect the
[11:42] armies of the aliens and the title of
[11:44] the night is out of weakness they were
[11:46] made what a time last Sunday the
[11:52] continuation of the Book of the
[11:54] mission of Jesus granny I believe the
[11:57] Holy Spirit used or Birla mightily to
[12:00] bring out the history and and the
[12:04] channels that God use having some real
[12:07] colorful stories and tonight just want
[12:11] to draw some inspiration out of weakness
[12:13] they were made strong another thought
[12:16] it's very strange but changes equal
[12:19] pressure over time that's like a formula
[12:21] that's achievable so I put I want to do
[12:25] some work around the yard home and I was
[12:26] looking for couldn't get me on the fire
[12:29] final the cut lines so I excited with
[12:32] the old-fashioned way
[12:34] I've taken a compass and Robin again to
[12:35] stone it's an old fashioned with a shock
[12:38] muneca I recognize that apply pressure
[12:41] and had to take some time but every time
[12:46] I keep pushing the Cutlass on the stone
[12:48] for some water you can fire them you see
[12:51] the edges getting shiny getting shocked
[12:54] I could feel so I begin to think about
[12:59] what pressure over time does not just
[13:03] time but what pressure over time what it
[13:08] does it brings a change and this life of
[13:12] feet is not a 110 feet is a it's a life
[13:20] my feet you come here tonight you come
[13:24] here my feet tonight and if you come by
[13:26] feet you want to receive something
[13:28] tonight okay not just natural you come
[13:32] in let by the spirit you come to hear
[13:35] something from God it's not right
[13:37] praise the Lord judges 6:14 and the Lord
[13:41] look upon him this is top this is Gautam
[13:44] the Gideon and call him a goal in this
[13:47] guy mind and thou shalt save Israel from
[13:49] the hand of the Midianites have that i
[13:51] sent thee he said on the air oh my lord
[13:55] where it shall I save Israel before my
[14:00] son is poor in
[14:02] and I am the least in my father's house
[14:06] and the lord senator and surely I will
[14:09] be the T and thou shalt smite the
[14:12] Midianites as one man
[14:14] it is amazing whole board will take the
[14:18] lease the lowest the weakest the one
[14:25] that you didn't expect for your would
[14:27] even team to do great things with
[14:31] hallelujah so board would use and
[14:35] channel and go past human weaknesses and
[14:38] whatever it is that his sovereign
[14:40] purpose will be accomplished and that is
[14:43] why that book of the generation of Jesus
[14:46] Christ that is so important to know back
[14:49] and to the bride will be fulfill all
[14:51] that was prophesied you believe that so
[14:55] all these different brothers because he
[14:57] was he livin in the chapter of the hues
[14:59] of faith but his out of witness they
[15:02] were made strong David wasn't a big
[15:04] mighty man with muscles and qualify for
[15:07] the army but God used him as somebody
[15:10] under qualified I'm not qualified to
[15:14] qualify him the deeper go higher so when
[15:18] you're thinkin not qualified are you're
[15:19] unqualified God could qualify you
[15:21] because it's not by might nor by power
[15:23] it is by his spirit nobody like to have
[15:27] their witnesses exposed but God did
[15:29] identify these characters in the Bible
[15:32] to show not only their strengths but
[15:34] their weaknesses the not only their
[15:36] strength but their struggles and to show
[15:39] that he can he would denied an because
[15:41] they are part of him
[15:42] you're part of the can plan on his great
[15:45] mystery isn't that right
[15:47] Jacob I love you so I heat he knew all
[15:50] about Jacob before Jacob was even born
[15:52] hallelujah he know the kind of person
[15:55] Jacob was going to be but that didn't
[15:57] stop him from predestinated Jacob on to
[16:00] a desired end
[16:02] hallelujah so all what you brought you
[16:04] have a desire in the behind it or glory
[16:07] to God these stories of Abraham of Moses
[16:11] up Sarah all of them
[16:12] you don't only see their faith and their
[16:14] strength but you saw their weaknesses
[16:16] also hallelujah and that is why he
[16:19] bruising that mr. important because
[16:21] Hebrews 11 didn't take to come just
[16:23] their weaknesses
[16:24] it's show their faith in God it didn't
[16:27] say rehab on a prostitute he said I hate
[16:29] the holiday hab by fate
[16:32] she didn't care sure the rest of them
[16:34] because she operates under the level of
[16:36] faith it shows how much caught on his
[16:38] feet or glory of God by fate the elders
[16:41] obtained a good report and I think you
[16:44] have a good report tonight but God will
[16:46] do something better for us that table of
[16:49] us and that made perfect so God call us
[16:51] something higher something further
[16:53] before the battle for you can be hotter
[16:55] and heavier because it's a great shape
[16:59] to take us out to this age or blow it up
[17:02] God we will take a great faith to pull
[17:05] on that cap you you believe that even
[17:09] the prophets of the third Pole is the
[17:10] hope we can feed some people do our
[17:12] Bulldog faith and go to get him speaking
[17:14] fake just speak the world or glory to
[17:17] God amen
[17:18] we believe that hallelujah so this fate
[17:23] built out of weakness build out the
[17:26] struggles built out of battles
[17:28] hallelujah all mine Abraham and God say
[17:31] you have a son hallelujah impossibility
[17:35] but God drop out on him to see how his
[17:38] feet will get activated how could her
[17:40] old man his wife and child Aaron could
[17:43] believe God on a Bible said it when
[17:46] believed God or glory level and that
[17:49] belief was imputed unto him for
[17:51] righteousness and the Bible says blessed
[17:54] is the man unto whom god would not
[17:56] include sin or glory the court because
[18:00] the faith
[18:01] yep I'm the blood of Jesus was even shed
[18:04] yet or Chloe the corner court call that
[18:07] man righteous go
[18:09] you I a shot in the house Jesus they're
[18:12] comin County and pay the price yet but
[18:14] the faith and Ibrahim God call them and
[18:16] righteous God righteous seed so what you
[18:32] see feet is a journey features are
[18:36] process fit as a same time because 18
[18:41] tell Abram 25 years and I love the
[18:43] phrasing that the brother branham
[18:45] brought he said when Abram came to the
[18:47] fullness of believe in you to get in on
[18:49] struggles you think he didn't have dogs
[18:51] when Sir didn't wanna make breakfast for
[18:53] him didn't think he got problems but he
[18:58] believed God
[18:59] not Sarah face not Sarah looked but he
[19:04] believed God Sarah physical looks wasn't
[19:07] encouraging to him because it couldn't
[19:09] be possible
[19:10] he was Sarah encouraged him to go until
[19:12] it heha and two years
[19:19] I mean oh praise God
[19:24] so Hebrews quenched the violence of fire
[19:29] as skilled another sword out of weakness
[19:31] no there are many people inside of that
[19:33] scripture they know their name everybody
[19:35] you know he said time would feel to tell

[20:20] here I'm not man got enough profit to
[20:22] turn our hats back to the faith of the
[20:26] fathers or give the Lord a show it has
[20:29] always been about the fate let me say
[20:32] that it has always been about the faith
[20:34] because sin is unbelief always been
[20:40] about defeat hallelujah

[42:28] the weakest of Christians when he met
[42:31] Satan he said it is written man shall my
[42:34] bread alone but by every word that
[42:36] proceedeth the mother of God
[42:37] the weakest question can take that stand
[42:41] God in His Word and every time when he
[42:45] would meet the enemies it is written he

[44:22] promise Terry you see the Jerusalem
[44:24] until McEwen perform on hang and they
[44:27] stay there until powerful on my hand I
[44:29] want to get her something here no glory
[44:32] to God I remember the quotation the
[44:34] world of God will be fix it and any way
[44:37] any time any place under any condition
[44:39] the Word of God alone I Lord I want to
[44:44] emphasize the fact alone not the world
[44:47] and I just not the word on a preacher
[44:50] just the word alone you would have got
[44:56] alone it is written world if he sit on
[44:58] no matter who he is what for me comes in
[45:00] ways act it well defeat Satan the
[45:04] written word of God so the devil don't
[45:08] want two things you know you don't want
[45:09] you in praise and worship and he don't
[45:11] want it with you written with no watch
[45:20] now here's another statement I want you
[45:23] to remember and that's you especially a
[45:27] so sick setting here but cancer cases
[45:29] and so for tonight he wanted to remember
[45:32] this that the right mental attitude this
[45:38] is a minor how you choose to think
[45:42] that's your your mind disposition
[45:48] because somebody could tell you
[45:50] something on you could choose to we see
[45:51] something negative for you to something
[45:53] positive he said the right mental
[45:57] attitude towards any divine promise of
[46:00] God will bring it to pass can you
[46:03] understand what I need the right mental
[46:06] attitude towards and if I promise of God
[46:08] we bring it up as gifts you will take
[46:10] the right mental attitude towards
[46:12] anything
[46:13] God has for me
[46:16] did you yell at anything anything
[46:24] performance you can have it I think that
[46:29] going over your head let me say that
[46:31] again anything God promised you could
[46:33] have it let me say it again
[46:36] anything God promised you gotta be angel
[46:43] of God coming to your house you can have
[46:46] the pillar fire in your home you could
[46:48] have a rainbow over your home you could
[46:51] have healing you can have Sealand you
[46:54] could have the liver runs you could have
[46:56] multiplication in your house your food
[46:59] could multiply in your house whatever
[47:01] you have listened when but apparently
[47:04] testimony or speaking skills since the
[47:06] haughty Rises that's nothing but the
[47:07] truth no that statement nothing but the
[47:11] truth that wasn't just a normal sheet
[47:12] metal oh that actually past dimensions
[47:17] when she said that back that past
[47:19] dimensions and went into the a break
[47:22] internment in heaven now having looked
[47:25] up their own heaven is right here in a
[47:27] faster dimension the energy said has
[47:29] nothing but achieved godhood that and
[47:31] that was so pleasing to God that God
[47:34] dropped down on the prophet and said
[47:36] give that woman whatever whatever
[47:39] whatever did you get at whatever
[47:42] whatever she wanted or glory to God
[47:46] whatever she wanted it was available or
[47:49] glory to God because this son had access
[47:52] to give that woman whatever she wanted
[47:57] because she said the right thing let me
[48:00] use a sinner I came after I saw we
[48:04] striving for like every because share
[48:06] the right then split the right take off
[48:07] the right wing get the right results
[48:10] hallelujah
[48:12] we find out we find him as soon as God
[48:16] came upon him he was anointed so Jesus
[48:20] he was waiting for his anointed
[48:21] he's 12 to 13 he was waiting for his
[48:25] anointing and that came when he got
[48:27] baptized fullness of the Godhead bodily
[48:30] 12 tell him he was anointed he made the
[48:33] Christ not right so what's something now
[48:36] no when he God came upon England on
[48:39] today went to new business and out after
[48:42] 40 days he defeated Satan by the Word of
[48:45] God and he did that so he brought this
[48:50] is part 1 again any divine promise in
[48:52] reach of the weakest of Christians if he
[48:56] was God why did he let Satan say it dub
[48:59] the Son of God before the miracle he
[49:01] says written and so then season always
[49:03] try to quote the word so what that shows
[49:06] that you can defeat sittin on the Word
[49:08] of God no matter the wood of corporal
[49:10] defeats isn't any place any way under
[49:12] any condition it's if it's in a belly of
[49:15] a wheel if it's in a lion's den if it's
[49:17] on the bed with a cancer it's leaning on
[49:20] the brilliant a debt in an automobile
[49:22] accident the Word of God will defeat
[49:24] Satan anywhere and the weakest Christian
[49:28] can use it it's your god-given privilege
[49:31] to do it Oh glory to God did you hear
[49:35] that now it's your privilege of code
[49:37] back that word the Lord that keep a
[49:40] vegan Lord that keepeth thee the Sun
[49:42] shall not smite thee by day nor the moon
[49:44] by night he shall preserve thy soul
[49:47] it's your word the Lord is my shepherd I
[49:51] shall not want
[49:52] it's your little Fiat me beside the
[49:54] still waters it's your good we restore
[49:57] it my soul dear do I walk to the valley
[50:00] of the shadow of death I shall fear no
[50:01] evil for thou art with me thy rod and
[50:04] staff they comfort me

[50:15] longer in the Bible yours will give the
[50:17] Lord a show
[50:19] [Applause]
[50:21] go with what you're not saying because
[50:30] you feel like you received if somebody
[50:33] say I know I'm saved because I had a
[50:34] children to me that's not why I am
[50:36] saying citizen could with me around that
[50:38] storm anyway and he can you to upon your
[50:41] feelings that's right but when I walked
[50:43] back and said don't say at the Lord
[50:45] my fear is built on the Word of God he
[50:48] can whip that away he can beat you on
[50:52] your feelings but he can't be sure
[50:54] you're safe because your faith is
[51:04] resting wear underwear and he cannot
[51:08] defeat that
[51:09] [Applause]
[51:14] you're feeling up you're feeling down
[51:16] you're feeling go you feeling - Kristen
[51:18] you know feeling forget that
[51:19] yes here's a question forget that tell a
[51:21] feeling go somewhere else you're a
[51:23] Christian because clutch net so you're
[51:25] Christian because God told you you're
[51:26] crystal because by putting him on the
[51:28] book and you see a name like John and
[51:30] you're shaking and you're worshiping is
[51:37] that feel as though this is believers
[51:39] though this
[51:41] [Applause]
[51:48] now listen let's continue remember Jesus
[51:52] had all the qualities of the father in
[51:54] him do you believe that he sure did
[51:57] all the fine gifts of God was in Christ
[52:00] he was the offspring of God but notice
[52:03] when he met Satan no I'd get us all
[52:05] different parts in the message so I
[52:06] won't put you together like this to him
[52:07] I find it something repetitive but
[52:09] there's some key things inside here I
[52:10] want you to get all right that's why I'm
[52:12] seeing it back but watch but but when he
[52:16] met sit and for you for your example he
[52:19] never used one gift on him when Satan
[52:22] came he said is written and he was put
[52:24] into ternary 727 14s belief on the SAMS
[52:28] man shall it be better alone so what is
[52:30] risk with me would you know just wasn't
[52:32] just touring that you know he's
[52:33] eternally stolen the bread Jesus given
[52:35] Scripture man shall not live by bread
[52:37] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[52:39] out of the mouth of God Satan tell me
[52:42] who you talking to
[52:42] he talking to by the believe in cotton
[52:44] Christian okay the Lord a shout come on
[52:47] now come on now
[52:48] say it I'm gonna eat your can do he is
[52:50] talking to a Bible believer called a
[52:52] Christian so Jesus was floatin
[52:56] undercoats he was broken on the
[52:58] scriptures he went even back set on the
[53:01] world man shall live by bread alone but
[53:04] this descriptor I say that so I'm not
[53:06] out here with you
[53:22] no knowledge of the principles of land
[54:12] that's what Satan had since the Canadian
[54:15] see understand don't reform so that my
[54:20] till had a bus that I'm destroy that I'm
[54:23] sure the devil he of power over himself
[54:26] now he fit the rule because he put me of
[54:29] character there was nothing in him that
[54:32] he'd ever could hold on to couldn't pull
[54:34] him with temptation couldn't pull in
[54:35] here and pull in here because he was
[54:37] clean on the inside from all unbelief a
[54:40] life of faith was inside of him he was
[54:43] flowing through him that's why he said
[54:45] Peter come Andrew come is fear talking
[54:49] here I'm never a respondent because they
[54:52] are seeds of God they they don't know
[54:54] yet who they are they just following a
[54:56] man with a beard come I will make you
[54:59] fishers of men and then drop the message

[55:23] get notice here it is I want you to see
[55:25] it and get it know the Word of God the
[55:28] written word of God will defeat Sita
[55:33] anywhere any place any time it is
[55:38] written there it is listen this is if I
[55:41] don't want to get here
[55:41] everybody wouldn't have gifts so Jesus
[55:49] brought it down to a place where those
[55:52] who do not have gifts that to Putin that
[55:56] do not have much very much faith could
[55:58] say it is written everybody don't have
[56:04] gifts so Jesus brought it to a place
[56:06] where it goes with all gifts it is
[56:10] written it is written I don't need a
[56:13] gift to say that I just need to say it I
[56:16] am THE LORD thy God ideality of all I

[56:34] [Applause]
[56:35] [Music]
[56:43] [Music]
[56:55] there was a little woman in Germany but
[56:58] a year two ago she had transferred is it
[57:01] on the back of the transmitter did of
[57:03] being English I could read it she have
[57:05] been crippled in a wheelchair for 15
[57:06] years and she got this she read her she
[57:09] must call the past there's no pastor
[57:11] called some Christian then confess
[57:13] everything that she had everything that
[57:14] she had done wrong and make it right
[57:15] with God and then lead up over her heart
[57:18] and pin it on a underneat garment and
[57:21] then have feet so when she got all this
[57:24] done a pastor was there she put it in
[57:26] her heart she said no almond ever you
[57:29] have had me long enough get away and up
[57:33] she got and when walking that is how
[57:36] simple it was perfectly healed normally
[57:40] it is just your simple faith in
[57:42] believing people try to make fear too
[57:45] complicated it is not complicated it's a
[57:48] simple childlike feet you know the blood
[57:51] in the Old Testament was applied by this
[57:53] earth you heard that so many times you
[57:55] know what hyssop is just common weeds
[57:56] you find it anywhere
[57:58] down in Egypt it grows out up a cracks
[58:00] in the building where the wind pack the
[58:02] seed they get it in a little diamond
[58:04] shape leave hyssop is common so what
[58:07] does that mean you don't have to have a
[58:09] super faith to a title engineer just
[58:12] common feet believe it that's all
[58:16] email hallelujah let's see if we could
[58:21] hit the home stretch here Wow from
[58:24] perfect strength but a Brannon read this
[58:26] scripture where God told pouring my
[58:28] grace is sufficient to thee for my
[58:30] strength is made perfect in weakness and
[58:32] he said for my strength is made perfect
[58:36] in weakness and he says now he said no
[58:38] this unusual text and this text on
[58:41] weakness because we are always
[58:42] testifying we are so strong we try to
[58:45] make our weaknesses excuses we want to
[58:48] tell our big Br
[58:49] how great we are and I think that's one
[58:51] of the things that God give me this text
[58:53] for was to get
[58:55] both of our mind the little things that
[58:58] we do and what we come to it for is to
[59:01] find out where our falses and the things
[59:03] we might better ourselves if we would
[59:06] come to church for any other objective
[59:07] I'm afraid we won't get too much out of
[59:09] coming to church we must come to find
[59:11] our weaknesses find our bad places house
[59:14] to see all that we are and put our trust
[59:17] in somebody that are strong but so there
[59:20] are so many of us like to testify or
[59:22] like to think we are insufficient
[59:24] therefore we meet an excuse I have no
[59:27] education I have no ability I'm unable
[59:29] to do this and if you keep that up and
[59:31] do that in that way keep going like that
[59:33] then you can't among anything but the
[59:36] very thing that we make excuses by our
[59:38] weakness God uses that very thing to
[59:42] tackle the job with he waits for us to
[59:45] get in that condition so he can use us
[59:47] we take the exclusive say well I can't
[59:50] do this I'm insufficient I can't do this
[59:52] and God takes that very thing to do job
[59:55] is true and the reason why he chooses us
[59:58] is because we in that condition
[59:59] now that sounds strange there's a few
[1:00:01] minutes we get it
[1:00:02] God's willing we find out that those
[1:00:05] people who are the weakest and they
[1:00:07] rejected by the outside world is God he
[1:00:09] rose
[1:00:09] that's a conquerors in the front line
[1:00:12] take those who are feeding themselves
[1:00:14] unwitting and I said that I remember
[1:00:16] when Batman was preacher nobody sees an
[1:00:19] unfolding in wood and so on he said when
[1:00:21] the voice said in line or a tripod Judah
[1:00:23] had prevailed and you know where that
[1:00:24] was and they got negate cemani so it

[1:00:30] Judah everything to hoop the seven seals

[1:00:34] possible it's got paths Jesus battle in
[1:00:37] the Garden of Gethsemane hallelujah to
[1:00:39] take the full mantle
[1:00:40] to go to Calvary and when he overcome
[1:00:42] his human spirit and the choice of will
[1:00:45] and he battled with it in human will and
[1:00:47] you overcome that and you recognize that
[1:00:48] he's going forward he overcame right
[1:00:50] there that was a lion Oh hallelujah

[1:10:48] the bright we'll be in the rapture
[1:10:50] we got a raptor gonna be in the pride
[1:10:52] that fake was an e knock Oh glory to God
[1:10:55] hallelujah
[1:10:56] he couldn't share our faith with his
[1:10:58] wife there's not much going on get Y
[1:11:02] fast when you get hot please not that oh
[1:11:05] no this has to be in you you can't share
[1:11:09] it you know how the testimony please God
[1:11:12] and one day was walking he got lighter
[1:11:14] and lighter and lighter and then he took
[1:11:15] off let me finish
[1:11:16] oh my oh my magically every hero God
[1:11:28] ever had on the front line was that type
[1:11:31] Ella please i poisoned above rejected a
[1:11:34] person that thought he was insufficient
[1:11:36] a person that have no belly at all then
[1:11:39] that's the person in the good ship
[1:11:41] so what could stack using them when they
[1:11:44] feel like they can't they haven't got
[1:11:46] nothing that's why I got stuck at all of
[1:11:48] them and do something with them when we
[1:11:50] are thinking that we are able to do it
[1:11:52] then God can't use that because we all
[1:11:54] wanted to do it ourselves
[1:11:55] see and then we get the fever's now on
[1:11:59] the other side with insufficient we
[1:12:01] don't want to do it then if we just
[1:12:02] listen to the call of God that's the
[1:12:04] very thing that God wants us to do the
[1:12:06] kind of sheep that so he can when there
[1:12:09] we go here we go what all this weakness
[1:12:11] is about what but always talking about
[1:12:13] listen it's bad when we are insufficient
[1:12:16] ourselves then we are subject to yield
[1:12:20] to God's Spirit so sometime go lay
[1:12:23] around your runn until you feel and flop
[1:12:25] because you run in your run you do in
[1:12:27] your do and when you recognize you can't
[1:12:30] do it then your give room nobody to do
[1:12:33] it because you try and you feel you try
[1:12:36] and it didn't work out you put your best
[1:12:39] foot forward and it still wasn't good
[1:12:40] enough
[1:12:41] God don't want your best foot forward he
[1:12:43] want your foot to be out of it
[1:12:44] altogether you want you to give room
[1:12:47] that he could step in to show you with
[1:12:48] your boss
[1:12:49] others but by your micro power but by
[1:12:51] his spirit I want this spirit come upon
[1:12:52] your life then that's what happened
[1:12:54] Sampson the spirit of walking upon
[1:12:56] Sampson happened to David speed of
[1:12:58] walking upon David all and
[1:12:59] I just woke him up on them and they did
[1:13:01] this under this and after what they felt
[1:13:02] it was they flesh and all continents but
[1:13:04] the spirit looking upon them and this
[1:13:05] was accomplished
[1:13:06] so in this is God put the word in the
[1:13:08] bright to use the word in the brain
[1:13:10] because the spirit upon a penny custom
[1:13:12] and was a whole disaster and a mess
[1:13:14] so Court is not doing that again he's
[1:13:16] not anointing flesh he imagined would so
[1:13:19] that's why I take all these years to get
[1:13:21] this word in the bride he said the world
[1:13:24] is being preached so called or team that
[1:13:26] this word is preached to get inside of
[1:13:28] you know you have to know it is inside
[1:13:30] of you you have to believe it inside of
[1:13:32] you that's what faith is about inside of
[1:13:36] you
[1:13:38] [Music]
[1:13:40] it is something that's revealed to you
[1:13:42] that is not yet but you know it will be
[1:13:44] so ever ever revelation but you're not
[1:13:47] ripen and experience yet you're right
[1:13:49] and you're getting revelation but you
[1:13:51] don't have the experience of it yet that
[1:13:53] is faith
[1:13:54] Oh glory to God so when God drop I use
[1:13:57] upon Abraham he had a revelation he
[1:13:59] couldn't give it to Sarah a fast Sarah
[1:14:01] is concerned she is barren she can't
[1:14:04] have no chance he's past childbearing
[1:14:05] age so do talk that talk to me but far
[1:14:08] as Abram concerned he arising do you see
[1:14:13] that Isaac has not manifest yet it's in
[1:14:15] his fate it's in the seed inside of him
[1:14:18] he had to testify the singer God said so
[1:14:20] because Sarah is the wound that he gonna
[1:14:22] use to make this CD rom hack manifest so
[1:14:26] he can't be forced Mira he got drunk
[1:14:28] Sarah he can't give up Sarah
[1:14:30] he can't somebody to kidnap Sarah Soraka
[1:14:32] stay right here whatever condition she's
[1:14:34] in
[1:14:34] or the crunchy punky she is that is the
[1:14:38] woman that gonna be used by God to
[1:14:39] produce this child for Liza and if you
[1:14:42] believe Isaac coming here EE Sarah will
[1:14:44] be change so it will take some pressure
[1:14:46] it will take some time it will take
[1:14:48] twenty five years
[1:14:49] [Laughter]
[1:14:52] but that change coming I do return unto
[1:14:56] thee according to the time of life
[1:14:58] transformation is coming change is
[1:15:01] coming if we take some pressure it's my
[1:15:03] pick something guardian and when we are
[1:15:20] insufficient ourselves I'm gonna lose
[1:15:22] then we are subjects to yield to God
[1:15:24] spirit as long as we think we can do it
[1:15:27] we can't do it but when we get to a
[1:15:30] place where we know we can't do it
[1:15:32] that's the problem there but we have to
[1:15:40] come to a place where we know we can't
[1:15:43] do it then we yield ourselves to God and
[1:15:47] he does it so that if it is us trying to
[1:15:51] do it we will feel I think I want to
[1:15:55] read it again if it is us trying to do
[1:15:59] it we would feel but when we just heal
[1:16:03] ourselves a God then God can feel
[1:16:08] [Music]
[1:16:13] when them guys come with all moldy bread

[1:17:48] always supposed to be the know about see
[1:17:50] God Cal I save things going off key
[1:17:53] something going off key because God have
[1:17:56] to keep his word he is god this is land
[1:17:59] possession time more than was drifting
[1:18:01] from Egypt to this land the journey was
[1:18:04] the direct one God send them to the
[1:18:06] wilderness in order to make sure time
[1:18:08] and pressure change their mind but Egypt
[1:18:13] was in the heart yes it was a short
[1:18:15] journey you know but God passed them a
[1:18:17] tough road to hope that time and
[1:18:20] pressure will change and main and change
[1:18:22] your heart
[1:18:23] from then the leeks and onions in Egypt
[1:18:25] but it was in the heart
[1:18:27] Oh glory to God hallelujah you want him
[1:18:31] cross over and run back and after was
[1:18:33] right at Hayes mania when they stumble
[1:18:35] there and they said we can't take it I
[1:18:36] wasn't gonna say hard enough that was it
[1:18:39] that was all that wilderness journey God
[1:18:41] was being ridden he could handle that
[1:18:43] but not when you learn in front of your
[1:18:45] man could imagine a reached this point
[1:18:49] this is 2019 and I'm taunting God's
[1:18:52] promises and I'm told is you could take
[1:18:53] it God will finish
[1:18:55] anybody want the question of what will
[1:18:57] finish with them we had near another
[1:18:59] worry first believed so I am back in no
[1:19:04] no we never know be aware labor or glory
[1:19:08] of God to be part of Hebrews 11 we are
[1:19:11] well able to be counted but Emma Wallen
[1:19:14] brothers with it we are wherever don't
[1:19:17] tell me God blessed you're here and do
[1:19:19] this for you here look away for you here
[1:19:21] and open that door for you here and that
[1:19:23] corner was closed that I don't have to
[1:19:25] open we will moved it or Fiasco no glory
[1:19:31] no God hallelujah
[1:19:33] [Applause]
[1:19:39] you cease lack of strength or weakness
[1:19:42] let me talk about a turban I'm not the
[1:19:44] most sinful weakness but weakness is a
[1:19:46] lack of faith because faith is the
[1:19:49] victory that overcomes the world and if
[1:19:52] you study you you went good very far but
[1:19:55] God brings the wood brick bring the wood
[1:19:56] no for your faith in Him see in the word
[1:20:00] so when you take 15 it what this is what
[1:20:02] this is what power in you then you seal
[1:20:05] yourself another get charged up because
[1:20:07] you will get no calls got a charge of a
[1:20:11] cell phone I'm sure people don't make no
[1:20:12] miscibility if there was reading the
[1:20:14] Bible as much as I do but for right now
[1:20:16] forget this church and revival right now
[1:20:19] but didn't want to miss the course it
[1:20:22] and attach it up right shredder charged
[1:20:24] up it's a function well you have to
[1:20:26] charge up the effectively function when
[1:20:30] somebody boxes in the lawful discharge
[1:20:32] and then the funeral home dispose of
[1:20:34] them outside after selling in church
[1:20:36] muezzin chants the discharge arrange it
[1:20:40] because there's no pressure over time
[1:20:43] that's what prayer does to Adam you can
[1:20:46] say good morning good evening gotta take
[1:20:47] some time I'm still there with intense
[1:20:49] elijah a man of like pastor prayed
[1:20:51] earnestly did you hear that inner prayer
[1:20:55] yeah just say prayers he prayed
[1:20:58] earnestly that it will not rain then he
[1:21:00] prayed again for him so is an approach
[1:21:03] of desperation
[1:21:05] its approach of businesses that much is
[1:21:08] the axis shall be given see condition
[1:21:10] and fine not gonna be open if somebody
[1:21:13] Taylor and run as they asked yesterday
[1:21:14] oh god I get it now I seek and I didn't
[1:21:16] find I'm not played over but anywhere
[1:21:18] don't further he that asked it he that
[1:21:20] seek it either knock it it has to have
[1:21:23] some condition to Jive you not just a
[1:21:25] not once but to keep knocking the door
[1:21:27] open when you understand this you don't
[1:21:29] open it what you want then you're not
[1:21:31] stopping is go open you wanna walk you
[1:21:33] have come to go back and come to get in
[1:21:34] you come to get your request made known
[1:21:36] make manifest
[1:21:38] let me see oh my
[1:21:40] [Music]
[1:21:44] remember one thing we must master
[1:21:47] especially young preachers and ly
[1:21:49] members alike there's one thing that you
[1:21:51] have got to master if we expect the
[1:21:53] fulfill go design our life that is we
[1:21:55] have to master the thought of human
[1:21:57] ability if we ever get to a spot where
[1:22:00] we think we can do it with our
[1:22:02] intelligence and our abilities we have
[1:22:05] got to master that in such a way that we
[1:22:07] can get rid of the thing leader societal
[1:22:09] gorkon users and make a complete
[1:22:11] surrender we cannot use one ability but
[1:22:13] is it vegan we have got to surrender
[1:22:16] complete surrender to come to God you've
[1:22:18] gotta surrender him both soul body and
[1:22:21] spirit everything you are has to be
[1:22:24] surrender to God in order he can work
[1:22:26] his will in you and I know that's hard I
[1:22:29] know so he's not saying it as easy
[1:22:32] singing that's hard I know because we
[1:22:36] all always wanted to do our part in
[1:22:38] something we know you know we want to do
[1:22:40] it we see well I just know it should be
[1:22:42] done this way but as long as you're
[1:22:44] doing it that way it's gonna be wrong go
[1:22:47] we'll never use that effort maybe with
[1:22:50] the help of the Lord we're going to get
[1:22:51] into that few minutes to show you how
[1:22:53] God cannot use your ability so he put
[1:22:57] his ability in you and use that not your
[1:23:00] own is his ability so we are here
[1:23:03] tonight by the ability of God we speak
[1:23:05] tonight by courts ability hallelujah are
[1:23:08] you at me no and what what what no no
[1:23:12] ability I don't care whose it is
[1:23:15] we'll never be usable in the sight of
[1:23:17] God God has to get all of our abilities
[1:23:19] out of us before he can achieve his
[1:23:21] purpose so he got something for us to do
[1:23:23] as long as we feel we're doing a pretty
[1:23:24] good job out of it then we will never
[1:23:26] you people use of God what good did it
[1:23:28] do nothing he said it was so wet then
[1:23:31] God can achieve his purpose by sinning
[1:23:33] not a revival
[1:23:34] he needs to send a killin so we can
[1:23:38] revive you need to die before you can be
[1:23:41] born again he needs a killing of
[1:23:44] ourselves this Tabernacle needs are
[1:23:46] killing on me with it all of us we need
[1:23:49] a killing so we can be revived to a new
[1:23:53] life
[1:23:53] whole turn you hope to a new experience
[1:23:56] we first need a day of mourning that's
[1:23:59] what we call it a day of mourning we
[1:24:01] need a place of yielding to the spirit
[1:24:03] instead so much only turn upon schooling
[1:24:05] upon programs or campaigns and rely upon
[1:24:08] so many ministers to cooperate we allow
[1:24:11] so many if we can't get some money we
[1:24:12] won't do it we won't go into the cities
[1:24:14] without that he said we have got to get
[1:24:16] away from that that is human ability you
[1:24:20] an ability of man and fight for men man
[1:24:22] go contrary to the leader of this five
[1:24:23] old gang he said he put a modify for so
[1:24:26] he here today I magnify for tomorrow
[1:24:28] he's no fool he's already fool because
[1:24:32] the bishop the bishop keep the money
[1:24:35] food animal is he that person was a
[1:24:37] soldier - minister he's all fallen angel
[1:24:41] fall from way for my mind sister
[1:24:45] immediately becomes a fallen angel Oh
[1:24:49] dies when man appointed and then man get
[1:24:52] disappointed he must get disappointed
[1:24:54] and mana point but when got a point to
[1:24:56] disappoint when court appoint a man
[1:24:59] nobody could on appointed but when man
[1:25:02] appointed as a different thing about it
[1:25:03] you look at my disappointment that's how
[1:25:05] you have to seek the Lord you have to
[1:25:07] look to hear from God gonna have to
[1:25:09] speak to you
[1:25:10] Oh hallelujah let me let me see no watch
[1:25:14] he said so we have got to carry from
[1:25:16] your nobility
[1:25:16] we gotta get to a place where we can
[1:25:18] surrender our souls and lives even to
[1:25:19] the housewife so not my past and another
[1:25:22] housewife farmer mechanic whoever we are
[1:25:25] we gotta surrender completely to God we
[1:25:28] are nothing then Gorka start using us
[1:25:29] and he said that include all of us
[1:25:31] everyone that's the thing we got to do
[1:25:33] history proves history does that God
[1:25:37] always choose the nobodies to become in
[1:25:38] somebody's go take the person that is
[1:25:41] nothing and I hope this get don't deep
[1:25:43] to us good here and it equal to that you
[1:25:45] realize that you've got to become
[1:25:46] nothing I don't know it all not agree
[1:25:48] somebody better nobody and you're glad
[1:25:50] to come to dust and you've got to come
[1:25:52] to a place where you know you're nothing
[1:25:54] and don't ever rise above that as soon
[1:25:56] as you rise up over to rise above God
[1:25:57] you got to keep yourself in the dust
[1:25:59] could imagine people saying I am the
[1:26:01] Holy Ghost Lucas in here you stay neat

[1:26:13] four everywhere here and in the typical
[1:26:15] I often said the greatest enemy I've got
[1:26:17] his william branham he's the one that
[1:26:18] gets in going to me he's the one that
[1:26:20] gets lazy he's the one that gets to our
[1:26:21] place sometimes way thinks he can do
[1:26:23] something about it when he does that
[1:26:24] shows quad right out the picture when I
[1:26:26] could get rid of that guy then I can get
[1:26:28] to a place that he's out of the way and
[1:26:30] court can come over and pick things that
[1:26:32] william branham knows nothing about
[1:26:34] [Applause]
[1:26:36] hallelujah glory to God so God passes
[1:26:40] nobles and get to beat this God passes
[1:26:41] those who think there's something to
[1:26:43] take somebody above nothing in order to
[1:26:45] work his purpose in their life court set
[1:26:47] up all my strength is made perfect in
[1:26:50] your weakness oh my I want to skip if we
[1:26:54] ever get to happen let me say let's
[1:26:55] something to console you I'm going to
[1:26:56] close here is some that encourages us
[1:26:59] are you ready out of weakness and
[1:27:03] humility God chooses the people the bill
[1:27:08] his kingdom out of if we ever get to
[1:27:13] heaven if we ever stand in the presence
[1:27:15] of God with his church we were standing
[1:27:17] a bunch of people that's been weak and
[1:27:20] rejected and cast out by the world and
[1:27:23] knows nothing I'm gonna close I want to
[1:27:27] read a scripture and this is from okay
[1:27:31] and I keep the past when David and his
[1:27:33] men would come to Z Glock under to the
[1:27:36] day that the Americas had invaded
[1:27:37] assault and Ziggler had smitten Ziggler
[1:27:40] and burn her with fire up taking the
[1:27:42] woman captive and what the errand is
[1:27:44] true not any either great or small but
[1:27:46] tied him away and went on their way so
[1:27:50] David Iceland came to the city and
[1:27:52] behold it was boom with fire
[1:27:53] and their wives and their sons and their
[1:27:56] daughters were taken captives
[1:28:03] and then David and the people that were
[1:28:06] with him lift up their voice and wept
[1:28:07] until they had no more power to weep so
[1:28:12] this is this is depression on steroids
[1:28:16] the week till they have no more tears to
[1:28:18] weep they do any Lord's business and
[1:28:22] come to see the wise taken away the
[1:28:25] city's pillaged so then David and the
[1:28:32] people that were with him lift up their
[1:28:34] voice and wept until there was no more
[1:28:35] power to weep and they were too wise
[1:28:37] you're taking in the captives a hen WOM
[1:28:39] his jester lights and Abigail the wife
[1:28:42] of Navarre the camera light and evil was
[1:28:44] greatly distressed for the people speak
