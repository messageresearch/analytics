[41:55] Pharaoh's daughter he refused the world
[41:58] refused all the offers that could be
[42:01] offered to him to gain something greater
[42:03] and better and in life there will be
[42:07] always offers in front of you and the
[42:10] choices that you take and decisions that
[42:12] you make you will see the fruit of that
[42:15] Pharaoh
[42:16] look and see madhavan's fear Allah can
[42:20] see people that were hungry and
[42:22] struggling and slaves but when Moses saw
[42:24] those very same people through the same
[42:27] window that Pharaoh saw Moses saw the
[42:30] people of God sometimes they may look
[42:35] like mud daubers they may look like
[42:37] nobodies they make like trodden and
[42:40] despise and so on but look again be
[42:44] careful you're looking at the people of
[42:47] God hallelujah everything might be right
[42:53] with Jacob but he had a heart for the
[42:57] boot right he wasn't right but he wanted
[43:00] the boot right and because he had a
[43:03] desire for the bird right God God God
[43:06] loved him he loved him and he knew he
[43:10] was going to be changed and God loved
[43:13] you
[43:13] God knew that you are going to be
[43:19] changed that's why you are here this
[43:27] morning you are not going to stay as you
[43:30] are

[43:54] yes yes yes there was chaos in the
[43:57] beginning darkness cover the earth but
[44:00] then God said let there be light and God
[44:03] went down into the chaos and God brought

[1:01:34] other side and I can by sharing my
[1:01:37] testimony maybe you could identify and
[1:01:40] say well it's the same card there is the
[1:01:43] same gone here as the God in the value
[1:01:46] it's the same God in the mountain not
[1:01:50] another God the same God and therefore
[1:01:53] we use that opportunity to come and
[1:01:56] share with you what God is doing for us
[1:01:59] we don't further do we want to go to the
[1:02:01] word internal violence to first Kings 19
[1:02:17] and read him from verse 1 to 9
[1:02:31] when you get its amen
[1:02:33] and by the way let me the lady that sang
[1:02:36] that song was really inspirational
[1:02:39] middle Oh bless you amen
[1:02:43] and Ahab is read me the Lord blessed
[1:02:47] with two hearts and a have told Jezebel
[1:02:51] all that Elijah had done and withal how
[1:02:55] he had slain all the prophets with the
[1:02:57] sword you can join with me tree
[1:03:00] thence Jezebel sent a messenger unto
[1:03:03] Elijah saying so let the guards do to me
[1:03:07] and more also if I make not thy life as
[1:03:11] the life of one of them by tomorrow
[1:03:13] about this time and when he saw that he
[1:03:17] arose and went for his life
[1:03:19] and came to Bathsheba which belonged to
[1:03:22] Judah and left his servant there but he
[1:03:27] himself went a day's journey into the
[1:03:29] wilderness and came and sat down on the
[1:03:31] juniper tree and requested for himself
[1:03:34] that he might die and said it is enough
[1:03:38] now O Lord take away my life for I am
[1:03:42] NOT better than my father's and he lay
[1:03:45] and slept under a juniper tree and
[1:03:48] behold then an angel touch him and said
[1:03:51] unto Him arise and eat and he looked and
[1:03:55] behold there was a cake Baken on the
[1:03:57] coals and a cruse of water at his head
[1:04:01] and he did eat and drink and laid him
[1:04:04] down again and the angel of the Lord
[1:04:07] came again the second time and touched
[1:04:09] him and said arise and eat because the
[1:04:13] journey is too great for thee any rolls
[1:04:17] and delete and drink and went in the
[1:04:19] strength of that meat forty days and
[1:04:23] forty nights on to Horeb the Mount of
[1:04:27] God and he came today into a cave and
[1:04:30] Lodge there and behold the word of the
[1:04:33] Lord came to him and said unto Him what
[1:04:36] doest thou here Elijah may the Lord
[1:04:40] bless thy readin and then we go to
[1:04:41] chapter 2
[1:04:54] reading from this one
[1:05:05] amen
[1:05:07] can you read with me and when the day of
[1:05:09] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[1:05:12] with one Accord in one place and
[1:05:15] suddenly they came a sound from heaven
[1:05:18] as of a rushing mighty wind and it
[1:05:22] filled all the house where they were
[1:05:24] sitting and they appeared unto them
[1:05:27] cloven tongues like as of fire and sat
[1:05:30] upon each of them and they were all
[1:05:32] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:05:35] speak with other tongues as the Spirit
[1:05:37] gave them utterance and and they were
[1:05:41] dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men
[1:05:44] out of every nation under heaven now
[1:05:48] when this was noised abroad the
[1:05:50] multitude came together and were
[1:05:52] confounded because that every man heard
[1:05:54] them speak in his own language and they
[1:05:57] were all amazed and marvelled saying one
[1:05:59] to another behold and not all these
[1:06:02] which speak galilaeans and how here we
[1:06:05] every man in our own tongue wherein we
[1:06:08] were born and then finally we go back to
[1:06:11] Luke chapter 6
[1:06:23] read in verse 12
[1:06:34] amen
[1:06:35] and it came to pass in those days he's
[1:06:39] talking about Jesus that he went out
[1:06:42] into a mountain to pray and continued
[1:06:46] all night and pray to God this is one of
[1:06:51] the most amazing Scripture the Jesus in
[1:06:54] whom 12 God spent the whole night
[1:06:57] talking to God made a lot less the
[1:07:01] reason to our hearts you can have your
[1:07:03] seats if you don't mind I can
[1:07:15] um probably notice message what here is
[1:07:19] Dow Elijah I was doing a little quote
[1:07:22] from it now Elijah had just completed a
[1:07:29] great victory in Mon common and God had
[1:07:33] been prepared at him brother Branham was
[1:07:36] saying that God was preparing him and
[1:07:38] then he said I was listening to brother
[1:07:40] David to Bridget who was seen what a
[1:07:45] Ministry of the supernatural meant no
[1:07:48] one knows unless you have to go true
[1:07:50] with it
[1:07:51] what it means and people think as a
[1:07:54] prophet speaking that I am a
[1:07:56] isolationists because I am NOT out
[1:08:00] amongst the people but it isn't because
[1:08:03] I don't like people I love the people
[1:08:05] but I cannot be a servant of God and a
[1:08:09] servant of the people at the same time I
[1:08:12] must keep myself before God so that I
[1:08:15] can serve his people so all this is true
[1:08:20] for also the true servants of God I
[1:08:21] believe that no minister of the gospel
[1:08:24] has any business out in social
[1:08:26] gatherings and this is brother Branham
[1:08:27] speaking to us ordinates before he goes
[1:08:30] into the pulpit those are sacred grounds
[1:08:33] if he does then he comes to the pulpit
[1:08:35] on fit and on anointing and when a man
[1:08:38] is on anointed he is unable to hear
[1:08:40] clearly from God what God wants the
[1:08:43] people to hear amen
[1:08:45] I think a minister should lay in the
[1:08:47] presence of God listen carefully
[1:08:50] no remember I'm not very good of it and
[1:08:54] I tend to go a little this is what God
[1:08:58] has played on my heart to go a little
[1:08:59] deeper and I like going T and the song
[1:09:04] the lady sang she says she wants to go
[1:09:06] higher so it is not by chance he sang a
[1:09:09] song to coincide with the message I want
[1:09:13] to go deep and not that you don't go
[1:09:15] deep but I just want us to go a little
[1:09:17] deeper
[1:09:18] amen and I think that's what God wants
[1:09:20] his children to do because we are
[1:09:23] supposed to be identified with the
[1:09:25] dynamics
[1:09:27] we have the mechanics but the dynamics
[1:09:30] wouldn't work by itself it has to hit
[1:09:33] the diner mechanics and then Gore has to
[1:09:36] do something to get the two of them to
[1:09:38] work it's like when you have a chemistry
[1:09:42] are you doing in lab and you have the
[1:09:45] oxygen and the hydrogen if you want
[1:09:48] water you can leave them separate h2o
[1:09:52] you have to join the edge with the to
[1:09:55] undergo if you want water otherwise it
[1:09:58] remains h2o correct so what good is good
[1:10:02] to have the edge I'm thirsty you are
[1:10:05] thirsty I have the edge I have the two
[1:10:07] and I have the oh but I need water since
[1:10:12] when you put them together then the
[1:10:14] water comes and we have to understand
[1:10:17] that we have the dynamics which is in
[1:10:20] the spirit and you have the word but you
[1:10:22] gotta get join the two together and we
[1:10:24] have to find out how to do that because
[1:10:26] the back where the Brenham didn't see
[1:10:28] when you get he said when you get to
[1:10:30] know who you are
[1:10:33] so whatever it is it's here what we just
[1:10:36] get has to get to know because if you
[1:10:40] don't get to know it will remain like
[1:10:42] that and then we can't blame God if the
[1:10:45] rapture is taken long are you follow me
[1:10:47] because God has already identified and
[1:10:50] sent you everything but it's taking us
[1:10:53] longer to know where the h2o is so that
[1:10:57] we could join them together because once
[1:10:59] you join them together is gonna flow
[1:11:02] amen then the Lateran and the former
[1:11:05] rain becomes wandering amen
[1:11:08] so it's not something God has to do
[1:11:10] again it's already here we just have to
[1:11:13] connect to be able to see it but then he
[1:11:17] says when you get to know who you are
[1:11:20] so if I don't know who I am then I'm
[1:11:23] trying to find out and if you don't know
[1:11:25] who you are then you're trying to find
[1:11:27] out and if the spirit is there he would
[1:11:29] leave you to who you are
[1:11:31] in da right alright so let's go back
[1:11:35] here as you take a literary because I
[1:11:38] don't all right where am i all right
[1:11:40] so you need to lay in the presence of
[1:11:42] God in his she kind of glory know the
[1:11:45] word Shekinah is a given name in Hebrew
[1:11:48] and it means God's manifested presence
[1:11:51] or his dwelling place amen
[1:11:55] and by the way that my subject this
[1:11:58] morning is under the juniper tree into
[1:12:01] his Shekinah glory and the text is
[1:12:04] meeting with God so I want you to follow
[1:12:07] this
[1:12:08] so he says lay in the God in the
[1:12:10] presence of God and she kinda means gods
[1:12:13] manifested presence all his dwelling
[1:12:15] place so after laying in his dwelling
[1:12:18] place the minister thereafter walks out
[1:12:21] before the congregation and tells the
[1:12:23] people what the Holy Spirit wants to be
[1:12:25] told to them this did Elijah and for the
[1:12:29] purpose of clarity Elijah here types the
[1:12:32] church so this lean and the presence is
[1:12:36] not only for the minister it types the
[1:12:38] church see we want to get stuff but we
[1:12:41] don't want to lay and you're not gonna
[1:12:44] do it by your intellectuals because
[1:12:47] that's that's failed already
[1:12:49] denomination that's what they work of it
[1:12:51] the bride has to go deeper you can use
[1:12:54] mental faith to get things that you need
[1:12:57] amen alright so you have to lay in his
[1:13:00] presence amen
[1:13:02] and that's the hard work lean in his
[1:13:05] presence oh we want a lot of things from
[1:13:08] God but look I don't have time to Lee
[1:13:10] and it wouldn't work because you cannot
[1:13:14] tell God how you want to get what he
[1:13:15] told you that you're gonna get you have
[1:13:18] to go his way the word wing and we are
[1:13:22] so busy that we don't want to like not
[1:13:24] on I'm willing to sleep I'm talking
[1:13:27] about laying in his presence
[1:13:31] and that's where the church is failing
[1:13:34] we want all the miracles we want all the
[1:13:36] signs and we want to speak tenders and
[1:13:39] everything else but we are not prepared
[1:13:41] to lay dead speak now if I speak just
[1:13:45] not gonna you're not gonna have any
[1:13:47] Ripple but if God speaks you go back
[1:13:50] amen but you have to live in his
[1:13:54] presence amen all right he said did you
[1:13:57] with the parents saying did you ever
[1:13:58] notice after the wickedness of the night
[1:14:01] has settled down and you walk out into
[1:14:03] the morning real early into the
[1:14:06] stillness and quietness of the dawn
[1:14:08] where the drew has brought the freshness
[1:14:11] the fragrance of the flowers
[1:14:14] oh what an atmosphere what it's the same
[1:14:17] when you can come out of a room of
[1:14:19] prayer so that God sorry so that you
[1:14:23] could come out of a room of prayer where
[1:14:24] you will lay in his presence and you
[1:14:27] come out fresh many times we come out
[1:14:31] stale because we didn't I and I cannot
[1:14:34] eat stale food now I don't know what
[1:14:39] you're in Trinidad but in Grenada we
[1:14:41] cannot eat stale food because it's not
[1:14:43] our custom the fruits and the trees are
[1:14:45] all over the place so we would rather go
[1:14:48] and eat mango then eat stale food now I
[1:14:51] know you keep quiet and I hope I'm not
[1:14:53] touching your toes but we write we write
[1:14:56] when it's fresh it goes down easier amen
[1:15:01] so when it's fresh it's good are you
[1:15:03] hurting me when you're in the presence
[1:15:05] of God lean in his presence and you walk
[1:15:07] out you're fresh and that's your revival
[1:15:11] right now
[1:15:15] amen glory so we can't eat something
[1:15:20] that's been gone long ago we ask why you
[1:15:22] come every day to hear the word
[1:15:23] otherwise we're just gonna - you could
[1:15:26] stay home and just play the tape
[1:15:28] but why you think that's not enough you
[1:15:30] need to get that fresh kill simple what
[1:15:35] we killing it all the time and every
[1:15:37] time you kill it you see something new
[1:15:39] and that's what you waiting on and one
[1:15:42] of these things is gonna break one of
[1:15:46] the cells is gonna unfold and it's gonna
[1:15:49] let loose an explosion
[1:15:55] but we gotta do the first part we have
[1:15:58] to connect the what h2o all right
[1:16:02] so God has been preparing Elijah and
[1:16:05] remember lighter types of church for a
[1:16:07] great outstanding miracle there you go
[1:16:10] and he had called all Israel together
[1:16:13] and he thought surely if Israel could
[1:16:16] see the supernatural hand of God on
[1:16:18] display then they would believe that God
[1:16:22] was truly God and they worship would be
[1:16:25] to him
[1:16:25] just imagine and I want you to think
[1:16:28] about this because he lighter is
[1:16:30] thinking if they see the supernatural
[1:16:32] then his journey is over his book is
[1:16:35] released if they see the supernatural
[1:16:38] that's his thinking and that's your
[1:16:40] thinking and I write glory Lord God but
[1:16:45] just imagine that it took five hundred
[1:16:48] and eighty five years from the time
[1:16:50] Egypt with your came out of Egypt to the
[1:16:53] time Elijah is doing this montano
[1:16:55] Montcalm our showdown I must remember to
[1:16:58] take my time and speak because I'm the
[1:17:00] home alright it's five hundred and
[1:17:05] eighty five years since the Great and
[1:17:07] notable miracles in Egypt and it's not
[1:17:10] like that don't know it's in the book
[1:17:12] it's in the books that you don't read
[1:17:16] anymore
[1:17:16] it's in the books amen we don't you know
[1:17:21] people hadn't listened to you have you
[1:17:23] ever going on believe us home and you
[1:17:25] don't hear the Prophet preaching anymore
[1:17:26] Oh in the early days we usually have it
[1:17:30] having preaching morning noon or night
[1:17:31] but something happened between then and
[1:17:33] now now you heard me don't get quiet
[1:17:38] something happened between then and now
[1:17:40] is it because you have all the books in
[1:17:43] your head because every time you listen
[1:17:47] to the Prophet there's something new
[1:17:51] every time you come here there's
[1:17:53] something new so when you shut it off
[1:17:57] you're shutting off the fragrance you're
[1:18:00] shutting off the freshness and yet you
[1:18:04] wanna smell sweet how's that gonna work
[1:18:08] [Applause]
[1:18:09] [Music]
[1:18:11] it's not gonna work like that in Grenada
[1:18:14] there's something called a cowboy back
[1:18:16] Co boy bat means you don't wander the
[1:18:19] show you just kind of wet
[1:18:21] certain parts and then you dry and
[1:18:23] you're gone and to make up for what the
[1:18:25] soap enriched you spray Cologne and that
[1:18:30] Cologne you hope is gonna take care of
[1:18:33] all the stench right then of course you
[1:18:39] don't do that it's raining out you don't
[1:18:41] do coke boy bites you do the real thing
[1:18:44] but it had home yeah there's something
[1:18:47] call a cowboy but you're just going out
[1:18:48] pick and you make sure you have a big
[1:18:51] bottle of cologne and you probably use
[1:18:52] about five when you mix it up then it's
[1:18:55] supposed to be good but it'd be so after
[1:19:00] an hour here comes the real set and then
[1:19:06] you know is it me hey you follow me and
[1:19:12] I'm trying to say that if you shut off
[1:19:14] the tapes and you shut up the books you
[1:19:17] can do like you're taking a cowboy back
[1:19:19] I don't have to go further so after five
[1:19:25] hundred and eighty-five years since the
[1:19:27] Great and notable miracles in Egypt on
[1:19:29] the Moses when God had so powerfully
[1:19:32] displayed the supernatural here once
[1:19:34] again as they did in Egypt Israel was
[1:19:36] once more sliding down into pale worship
[1:19:40] how does that work we've seen the
[1:19:43] supernatural you've seen God do great
[1:19:46] things
[1:19:47] pop the waters and 585 years we just
[1:19:53] have 60 70 years next day won't be 70
[1:19:55] years in all right next year Israel is
[1:19:59] going to be 70 years and all those
[1:20:00] people who were born at that time they
[1:20:02] look they're supposed to not die
[1:20:03] until they see the Messiah we are here
[1:20:07] since we became a nation
[1:20:09] she'll be something in 2018 and Jesus
[1:20:13] said that this generation shall not pass
[1:20:15] away until all the things that I've told
[1:20:18] you which is the three questions is
[1:20:20] fulfill and it's gonna take us on a ways
[1:20:25] if we don't connect the edge to all so
[1:20:34] we have to understand that while you're
[1:20:36] going along and everything things are
[1:20:39] happening it may not be happening in
[1:20:41] your house but it's happening we not be
[1:20:44] happening in your life but it's
[1:20:45] happening and you ain't gonna stop it
[1:20:48] you got to get with the program or the
[1:20:52] program is going to leave you out you
[1:20:57] got to come in his presence you're gonna
[1:20:59] turn it back on the thing that brought
[1:21:04] you is the thing that's gonna deposit
[1:21:06] you whatever started you is going all
[1:21:12] the way
[1:21:15] you can change it that's why the wife
[1:21:22] you started with is the one you go to
[1:21:23] the end you can change meet with mid
[1:21:26] wiki so well honey you know I think it's
[1:21:29] the way you get off it don't work so you
[1:21:33] wanna get quiet hope I'm not touching so
[1:21:39] I get here when you get quiet is not to
[1:21:40] speak of all those things alright so so
[1:21:44] the hair that were torn between the
[1:21:47] worship of God and bear they were
[1:21:49] constantly driven back and forth between
[1:21:51] the ways they had picked up in Egypt and
[1:21:53] the Word of God sent to them by the
[1:21:55] prophets they were not able to hear
[1:21:58] God's voice anymore the priests of
[1:22:00] Jezebel and it's prophet seems to
[1:22:03] overwhelm the long the Lord prophets
[1:22:07] voice which was only Elijah could
[1:22:10] imagine Israel which is a chosen people
[1:22:13] of God had no false prophet and truth
[1:22:15] and it has always been that way
[1:22:18] four hundred verses one eight hundred
[1:22:21] and fifty verses wrong how does that
[1:22:25] work and remember God takes this man but
[1:22:30] not the spirit Satan takes this mana not
[1:22:33] despair Oh church how does that work
[1:22:41] it seems to me the longer the time is
[1:22:44] the hotter the people the more sold out
[1:22:48] you get that's how it's supposed to be
[1:22:54] not following this and following that
[1:22:56] and following here and following their
[1:22:58] stay where the where there is no shut up
[1:23:10] there is no other way is only one way
[1:23:15] [Applause]
[1:23:17] it's a proven way it works
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:23:25] [Applause]
[1:23:28] and God will let you play with it until
[1:23:30] you realize oh my it's a Brooke cuz
[1:23:34] it'll make you want to go that way
[1:23:35] alright go ahead
[1:23:36] and then you'll find out it broke it
[1:23:38] don't work no more and then you find
[1:23:40] yourself struggling to come back we're
[1:23:41] to the origin
[1:23:43] I don't care which church the chipster
[1:23:46] you always come back to the origin no
[1:23:49] word
[1:23:57] you didn't get salvation in the church
[1:23:59] you got it in the world
[1:24:01] but we seem to lose focus and then we
[1:24:04] start looking for the church not the way
[1:24:06] in the beginning was the word in the end
[1:24:12] shall be the plan have another chap pass
[1:24:18] away but your Engel move the world
[1:24:24] I don't care how bright you are I don't
[1:24:28] care how many subjects you got ain't gon
[1:24:31] change for you
[1:24:35] I don't give you the Prime Minister's
[1:24:37] cousin that ain't got nothing to do it
[1:24:40] it I have a door here so if anybody get
[1:24:50] upset I could sleep Judah and Israel had
[1:24:58] backslidden they had a king a neighbor

[1:39:55] good comment for what better offer
[1:40:05] I wonder if we really believe us boy
[1:40:08] Kobe scratch-off was as long as you're
[1:40:14] doing anyway what's gone we change the
[1:40:21] promenade and then we sit down and walk
[1:40:25] with me you want him back with you and
[1:40:28] you pull out the page what's in that
[1:40:33] covenant is a whole page but God you
[1:40:39] remember us over the same oh god the
[1:40:40] fear I mean the world in fear but God is
[1:40:43] just God did not just leave us so if he
[1:40:49] said better you didn't see the tire and
[1:40:51] he cannot lie
[1:40:58] and make a comment if you said Oh better
[1:41:04] one come if you move or change governor
[1:41:07] what I do in here let me go on so today
[1:41:18] we're mine how'd it go back
[1:41:20] excuse the old man I know how cannot as
[1:41:22] fast as I used to be so where is it in
[1:41:26] our day abomination would be deceptive
[1:41:28] because sin is not getting less it's
[1:41:31] growing
[1:41:32] you just can see it because it's
[1:41:34] invisible why it is principal that is
[1:41:39] and if we were fighting a fight with a
[1:41:42] tang clan clan and we seen one another
[1:41:44] it's a different story you could come up
[1:41:48] and say well I sure don't fight I can I
[1:41:51] look blow here and there but that's what
[1:41:52] I'm five I heard me but I know the fight
[1:41:56] we talk about spirits not zooming in and
[1:41:59] zooming out
[1:42:03] and you can hope to beat a spirit in
[1:42:06] your body and in your flesh
[1:42:08] you better get some spirit
[1:42:11] [Applause]
[1:42:14] they go up if you don't want to fight to
[1:42:21] be one-sided going leg in his presence
[1:42:27] and I'll tell you where is this I come
[1:42:31] in there so he's hiding and not only and
[1:42:36] therefore if he's hiding only the truly
[1:42:39] spirit-filled ones would see him I just
[1:42:44] went to speech a circus services room
[1:42:46] and I found out they are gifted men who
[1:42:49] are not truly spirit-filled that's
[1:42:53] dangerous because they have a
[1:42:55] manifestation of the real Holy Ghost but
[1:43:00] the life which is the person of Christ
[1:43:05] it's not there that means dangerous men
[1:43:10] gifted Canady night how many of you does
[1:43:16] this at the TD jakes wait baby doll I
[1:43:21] know
[1:43:23] no hands for why would I want to listen
[1:43:28] to him if I have somebody who can see
[1:43:33] what he cannot see
[1:43:37] and I will tell you I hope he doesn't
[1:43:40] mind he's truly gifted let me leave it
[1:43:44] there let's move on and the Provost said
[1:43:53] now we can shout we can scream we can
[1:43:57] speak matones and have signs and things
[1:44:00] but where is the sincerity about the
[1:44:03] Word of God and in the Church of God
[1:44:07] this idolatry had become a grief to
[1:44:09] Elijah Elijah is the type of the church
[1:44:13] is it a grief I had some Amen Connor
[1:44:19] we got a ship the boat horn again
[1:44:22] signals here this side I'll call it as I
[1:44:31] see it
[1:44:32] hello because I'm asking you is it a
[1:44:35] grief is it grieving you this is boring
[1:44:43] you to action
[1:44:46] cause if you're not if it's not grieving
[1:44:49] here you're sleeping or the two kinds of
[1:44:52] people in this in this war those who are
[1:44:54] wake and those who are sleep and these
[1:44:58] days if you're sleepy means you're dead
[1:45:01] you dying twice physically spiritually
[1:45:05] you cannot afford to be like that now
[1:45:08] when the Prophet was are wrong he had so
[1:45:10] many demons and sort of fight
[1:45:12] could you imagine now could you imagine
[1:45:15] now if there was ever a time to churches
[1:45:22] beyond this God the church should be
[1:45:23] focuses now that glass all over the
[1:45:27] place
[1:45:27] the Philistines the armor eyes the
[1:45:30] besides the mists heights the club play
[1:45:33] nights all the ice
[1:45:39] and only the truly spirit-filled that is
[1:45:46] why I don't even think you realize what
[1:45:51] kind of man your Shepard is no I don't
[1:45:56] have to give props God give him props I
[1:45:58] doesn't give people purpose I speak the
[1:46:02] facts because if is either there it's
[1:46:05] not there you can't pretend it's there
[1:46:07] and it's not there and it because it's
[1:46:09] there I'm here and one of the problems
[1:46:19] is we are canceled far from God that we
[1:46:22] can discern what is spirit-filled are
[1:46:27] supposed to be gifted and somebody
[1:46:31] raised for say nice things
[1:46:33] China lalala and all the people in that
[1:46:39] section gone leaving that which made
[1:46:43] them to be here sit please you're
[1:46:50] baptized and you receive the world and
[1:46:53] you've been fed who could you get
[1:46:55] perfected some wheels it's like you're
[1:46:59] going a restaurant and you order food
[1:47:01] and you want me to be free you're gone I
[1:47:06] see you're not being a bit oh then we'll
[1:47:07] pay for it but I dominate
[1:47:15] what you eat is were you painful are you
[1:47:18] getting me we are looking always for
[1:47:21] their easy way there is no easy way but
[1:47:26] Abraham said the Christian walk is a
[1:47:28] rugged Rock this is do you know a rugged
[1:47:31] meet not smooth you need to take a hike
[1:47:36] in the rugged terrain and understand
[1:47:40] when you come back why you have ten
[1:47:42] bruised rocket means not smooth
[1:47:50] if you find your life smooth don't leave
[1:47:52] here until you ask God to change
[1:47:57] [Applause]
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:03] okay let's roll this idolatry had become
[1:48:07] a grief to Elijah and as Christians we
[1:48:10] should always watch what we do and say I
[1:48:11] find there is a level of concern Sarah T
[1:48:14] among believers and I'm coming I'm
[1:48:16] coming from home now I used to we began
[1:48:20] some serious prayer about six years ago
[1:48:23] they spray and then spray I'm done with
[1:48:27] laying in his presence so I'm not
[1:48:29] preaching to you something I hope work
[1:48:32] I'm preaching to you what I have
[1:48:34] experienced and one of the things God
[1:48:37] showed us when we really got down to
[1:48:40] pray and by the way praying easy for
[1:48:43] those who think crazy no no no no no no
[1:48:45] no there's a struggle until you break
[1:48:50] through you ain't wait until you break
[1:48:56] through cause that part before you break
[1:49:00] through is you're dying you know
[1:49:05] patience with God and you accident for
[1:49:07] patience how does that work can you
[1:49:12] spend 50 minutes in prayer
[1:49:15] it's a better move for every I know
[1:49:17] that's why you're like that cuz those
[1:49:21] who bring like Jesus he stayed all night
[1:49:25] I'm not telling you about Peter now I'm
[1:49:28] not telling about Paul I'm speaking
[1:49:30] about the Messiah and if he did that
[1:49:34] whole night you think at 10 minutes ago
[1:49:39] work for you
[1:49:40] but you know why we look 10 minutes
[1:49:42] because our experience is equivalent to
[1:49:45] 10 cents committed Allah so we could
[1:49:50] only pray what we experienced and we not
[1:49:53] prepared to go deeper to get higher
[1:49:56] you cannot go higher going up heaven is
[1:50:00] the only place where higher means going
[1:50:02] down on your knees if my people which
[1:50:12] are called by my name shall humble what
[1:50:15] that means is kneeled on stoop don't lie
[1:50:18] down down fibrous to pray standing
[1:50:20] stooping sitting different ways and
[1:50:22] David didn't even take that chance you
[1:50:24] see a falling prostrate and you afraid
[1:50:28] if I come in your house and your
[1:50:29] prostate on the floor but I don't think
[1:50:31] you crazy
[1:50:35] and yet that is evidence of your growth
[1:50:37] in going because as you grow in God you
[1:50:42] get more sincere sincerity comes from
[1:50:47] growth in God where we are now I wasn't
[1:50:52] there before and then we found out that
[1:50:53] we used to talk casually now coming by
[1:50:56] in tomorrow and fix the thing but we lie
[1:50:58] we didn't go and we didn't call and say
[1:51:01] we can't make it so it's come a habit
[1:51:06] but it is called
[1:51:08] lying the first man I ever hear talk
[1:51:12] straight is William Branham when he said
[1:51:14] every hung leg and I stood at attention
[1:51:17] I said Oh God we shall a man kept say
[1:51:22] that bring him and they brother Branson
[1:51:28] we've got don't do this then he's and
[1:51:31] he's obligated to do it then he is not
[1:51:33] God you say that
[1:51:38] Goodin you don't deserve the right to
[1:51:43] speak to God until you stay with God the
[1:51:53] more you stay talking to your wife and
[1:51:56] it is the easier it cut it gets I don't
[1:52:00] like to go there but I just pull it
[1:52:01] right
[1:52:02] Boggan on way and what is happening with
[1:52:08] marriages today's Tschida heat it and we
[1:52:13] talking all by tax
[1:52:17] you can up your she answer back not now
[1:52:26] Sam house and if you're talking to her
[1:52:31] you were talked about and I say white I
[1:52:35] know your bread I know and if you can't
[1:52:37] talk to her you're gonna talk to me or
[1:52:39] you can put on a smile a casual hello
[1:52:42] god bless but how far does it go so we
[1:52:46] cut that out because we found out as we
[1:52:49] pray and we got muslin see things change
[1:52:54] and the angel told William Branham my
[1:52:58] prophet
[1:52:59] yes - if you can become more he was
[1:53:06] already sincere you know of anybody who
[1:53:09] promised somebody something and reached
[1:53:10] halfway down the road and bring it all
[1:53:13] the way back after preacher and the end
[1:53:18] I said am i enough you want to get rid
[1:53:23] of cancer then your heart go down in the
[1:53:25] basement you can stay in the veranda
[1:53:30] y'all go in the engine room
[1:53:33] we want so much things from God but we
[1:53:36] are not prepared you can get more speed
[1:53:42] from the book if you're not in the
[1:53:43] engine and in separatin
[1:53:50] it had to be easier than that yes but is
[1:53:53] not in the Bible not that what you want
[1:53:59] is knowing that Bible matter get the
[1:54:01] next Bible you have a lot of able regain
[1:54:05] this so this brother had a problem a
[1:54:10] problem of self-indulgence in the flesh
[1:54:14] in the flesh I hope a talking store
[1:54:17] could speak in green Erica talk about
[1:54:20] internet not too sure and I don't want
[1:54:22] to live my welcome but he had a problem
[1:54:26] itself and doesn't he love the Lord
[1:54:28] hard-working praising God Shelton and I
[1:54:33] prayed for him and I thought that God
[1:54:38] but I go in the church every morning
[1:54:41] pray lay in his presence and then I go
[1:54:43] to work you don't have to do that
[1:54:44] because you're not fire everything fire
[1:54:47] home in fire so I would drive up going
[1:54:51] for a half an hour and those are the
[1:54:53] brothers who followed me and we will
[1:54:54] pray and he will be praying and crying
[1:54:56] every single day and it got to me I said
[1:55:02] what is he crying so Allah isn't he
[1:55:05] victorious didn't he get the victory and
[1:55:07] I wouldn't approach him because I'm
[1:55:08] waiting some of us don't weigh a lot of
[1:55:12] experts in the message and by the way X
[1:55:14] means you're not there again
[1:55:24] and I was weighted and that came
[1:55:28] communion service and after the message
[1:55:32] I saw anything and I said what's wrong
[1:55:33] brother he said I can't take communion
[1:55:35] no he didn't say I come to come here you
[1:55:37] see I happiness problem I said where you
[1:55:39] had a sit at communion because you can't
[1:55:41] be taking communion after reading all
[1:55:43] the scripture says judge yourself fix it
[1:55:45] up we'll make it right with God and stay
[1:55:47] there until it's right and I said maybe
[1:55:52] you're not sincere enough cuz everyday
[1:55:55] he would come and I think he's getting
[1:55:57] the victory and same thing the night
[1:55:59] same thing no this is a brother his
[1:56:01] whole life
[1:56:02] that's what he did and this message that
[1:56:05] I'm preaching him I'm not preaching this
[1:56:07] him because of because I have nothing to
[1:56:09] say it works that's telling you that God
[1:56:15] changes people and God heals and God
[1:56:17] delivers and it don't work I'd be lying
[1:56:22] original I and this message that God has
[1:56:26] sent to us with the dynamics of the
[1:56:28] mechanics has enough power to change the
[1:56:30] body but the reason why you're still in
[1:56:36] the press where you are it's because
[1:56:39] you're not sincere
[1:56:40] you're like the lady that told brother
[1:56:42] Branham I wanna stop smoke she would be
[1:56:46] in the prayer line all the time she
[1:56:48] would be in the prayer line day after
[1:56:50] day and better brand I pray for her
[1:56:52] the Prophet didn't go away I don't care
[1:56:57] who prefer if you don't want that double
[1:57:00] go he married to you
[1:57:04] even the devil does nowise marriage he
[1:57:08] married he stayed there you had a
[1:57:10] divorce him
[1:57:11] Oh quick the divorce in the natural but
[1:57:16] we not divorcing in the spiritual that's
[1:57:19] where the divorce need to be and the
[1:57:22] most wish to separate and you cannot
[1:57:23] separate and still have him light a new
[1:57:26] thing now in Grenada and applause from a
[1:57:28] white but she's my girlfriend
[1:57:33] so men would it was still living and
[1:57:36] sleeping by the lady but a divorce that
[1:57:40] went on here not that can't be going on
[1:57:42] here but separate means to set power
[1:57:46] rate and I'm saying to you the power is
[1:57:53] real and the only reason why you ain't
[1:57:55] seen it in your life if you're not
[1:57:57] seeing it
[1:57:57] because you didn't mean it and they
[1:58:02] don't know when you mean something
[1:58:05] coming up here for me tonight you ain't
[1:58:07] going make a move if you want him to
[1:58:10] stay if you still like it he's still
[1:58:15] like that spirit let me tell you you
[1:58:16] cannot get rid of the devil unless
[1:58:18] you're headed
[1:58:25] if I regard iniquity in my heart God
[1:58:29] will not hear me on the reason why many
[1:58:33] of us are lights is up and down or we
[1:58:35] get a little picture even getting a
[1:58:36] little revival in the three weeks the
[1:58:38] revivalist only plan we got just alyou
[1:58:46] it Noorie it's because of a lack of
[1:58:52] sincerity we should have been higher
[1:58:55] than where we are now this one I we
[1:58:58] bridge joke you're making that's the
[1:58:59] most powerful force that ever hit this
[1:59:01] lit hip to moon missus not comparable
[1:59:06] and God bless against the hearts and the
[1:59:09] minds of simple people why complicate it
[1:59:18] we complicate the message the message is
[1:59:21] not complicated
[1:59:23] [Applause]
[1:59:25] looking for other ways to pop the water
[1:59:30] but it don't need the voice of God that
[1:59:35] can pop the water when God come down he
[1:59:39] will pass your water he will separate
[1:59:42] your situation he will divide it for the
[1:59:46] Word of God is powerful
[1:59:48] [Applause]
[1:59:54] Shabba that's not so like that and you
[2:00:01] telling me you're still with this yes
[2:00:03] now SEP super this sorry can I say that
[2:00:06] [Music]
[2:00:08] I'm passionate sorry I'm very passionate
[2:00:11] cuz this is my life that's all I got
[2:00:17] I want much more like David said I don't
[2:00:20] want to be rich don't want to be pushed
[2:00:22] just give me this and I'm holding on to
[2:00:25] this until dot-com and so after that
[2:00:32] experience the briella came to me said
[2:00:33] Burton this is the situation with me I
[2:00:39] said well now mean business with God I
[2:00:42] said you were making the problem God is
[2:00:45] already giving her the deliverance to
[2:00:47] his will and what his spirit and spirit
[2:00:50] his life will you not take any life if
[2:00:53] you take it you would lose it and I said

[2:01:17] gonna be gone to pray we found the sound
[2:01:20] like the oil in the church now I hope
[2:01:29] I'm pushing nobody tools because pray

[2:07:35] song leader but he have a problem with
[2:07:37] women his wife could not make children
[2:07:43] so he blame her and he was looking for a
[2:07:45] baby I would say he didn't get it
[2:07:50] and he would drift off and I didn't even
[2:07:54] know that was happening until one day
[2:07:55] after the word he you were screaming on
[2:07:58] the floor and there may be good to find
[2:07:59] out he repented because his phone had
[2:08:02] all the ladies in it

[2:08:41] blame somewhere else isn't that easy
[2:08:43] easy put somewhere else not me who me
[2:08:47] could be then who

[2:09:02] don't go we don't talk casual life if we
[2:09:12] cannot do it we cannot do it but you're
[2:09:14] not gonna get him doing that
[2:09:16] what have we found a move of God so
[2:09:23] powerfully the sister had a baby when
[2:09:28] the baby was born it had jaundice and
[2:09:31] they kept the baby in a special
[2:09:35] incubator and she and I didn't even know
[2:09:39] how much trouble she was going to until
[2:09:41] she me give the testimony and the baby
[2:09:44] had white blood cell count higher than
[2:09:48] the red fightin the infection and it got
[2:09:50] so high that the doctor said it's
[2:09:52] climbing every day it was climbing 12 13
[2:09:56] they called me when it hit 14 so what's
[2:10:01] happening here
[2:10:01] he said the baby is getting worse in the
[2:10:04] beginning they didn't call me because I
[2:10:06] figure the doctor tell them II could
[2:10:07] hunt you know but it was getting worse
[2:10:09] and then he said when it hit 14 will
[2:10:12] taking it from you god is danger and
[2:10:18] that morning it hit 14 and they called
[2:10:20] me and I said I just finished in the
[2:10:21] church brain I said Lord what do I do
[2:10:25] and the Lord directed me to go in a
[2:10:28] certain place because the the what make
[2:10:32] it worse her baby was not taking the
[2:10:34] milk which could you read it to the
[2:10:37] problem because the milk helps to fight
[2:10:39] the infection Bressman
[2:10:41] are you following me I can say that and
[2:10:45] she it wasn't flowing and she was
[2:10:47] getting real anxious it's our first baby
[2:10:50] just married and you know how that means
[2:10:52] I'm just growing getting worried that
[2:10:58] morning one of the relative scream out
[2:11:03] check the whole church
[2:11:05] and I didn't know why then after we
[2:11:10] found out and that morning I was gonna
[2:11:11] say Lord what do I do
[2:11:12] and a lot directed me and I went to this
[2:11:14] lady that I usually buy peppermint oil
[2:11:16] from and I said I need something that
[2:11:19] talks about breast feed
[2:11:20] she said well mom is my Hannah I don't
[2:11:23] know what to do I said well you are
[2:11:24] empty ebook she said look under there I
[2:11:26] said what page is breastfeeding she say
[2:11:28] I don't know I said well let me go and
[2:11:29] since God is my witness I open it and
[2:11:32] they're in a carrot page breastfeeding
[2:11:35] problems God is my witness I don't
[2:11:40] really been cutting but I tell any I
[2:11:42] open it just breastfeed him problems I
[2:11:44] say I want a photocopy that she said all
[2:11:47] right I took the book I bring it
[2:11:48] downstairs and I see the hair that Pete
[2:11:49] had other things so I said well Lord I
[2:11:51] hope that's not sin and I tear them out
[2:11:53] and I photocopy them and I now put them
[2:11:55] back with group I can't lie and the glue
[2:12:03] stick it really nice you won't know and
[2:12:08] I said thanks and I went to the hospital
[2:12:10] and that started I said go in the
[2:12:12] hospital Testament said stop you need
[2:12:13] oil call the elders anoint them with oil
[2:12:17] so I went looking for oil and oil in
[2:12:20] Grenada you know like the olive oil
[2:12:22] there was it expensive and I have my
[2:12:25] liquor cap she always walking my little
[2:12:27] care so I said I need just this amount
[2:12:29] and I didn't tell her why she said well
[2:12:32] if you need them yet go in there and I
[2:12:33] walked to everybody and then they say
[2:12:35] good to that way and when I saw the lady
[2:12:36] and I said I need someone she said come
[2:12:38] and she poured out her bottle which
[2:12:39] normally will sell for $15 and she
[2:12:41] purchased some and she gave it to me she
[2:12:43] said you can leave I said I don't want
[2:12:44] to pay for because I remembered Abraham
[2:12:47] and I pull out $10 I said she said I
[2:12:50] said no take it and then I said I'm
[2:12:52] going to pray for a sick person and I
[2:12:56] went to the hospital and when I walked
[2:12:58] into the hospital they said you cannot
[2:13:00] see the baby the mother has to come out
[2:13:03] I said well I want to pray for the baby
[2:13:05] said no you can't see I said well if I
[2:13:07] can't get the baby I'll get the mother
[2:13:08] because she's getting it from the mother
[2:13:10] and I showed out what to do in the page
[2:13:13] tell you how to hold a baby to
[2:13:15] breastfeed apparently out of
[2:13:16] in a certain position real techniques
[2:13:19] and you put it in a way then it flew and
[2:13:22] so on and so on she had a picture but
[2:13:24] the the number on the white blood cell
[2:13:26] had risen for them to take the baby and
[2:13:29] I am no in tinfoil and I said father God
[2:13:31] in the name of Jesus I cannot reach the
[2:13:33] baby but I can reach the mother I pray
[2:13:35] that you would touch that baby and then
[2:13:39] I left I said keep me up to date the
[2:13:43] next morning she said president of them
[2:13:46] is gone down I said what does it
[2:13:53] she said normal England of the disease
[2:13:58] he goes well normal
[2:14:00] [Applause]
[2:14:10] let me go quickly I just express these
[2:14:16] things to you to show you what praying
[2:14:18] in his presence does so the Prophet was
[2:14:26] saying I find as a level lack of
[2:14:28] sincerity alright and this is where we
[2:14:31] are feeling because if we are not truly
[2:14:32] honest and sincere with each other how
[2:14:35] can we be with God
[2:14:36] so sometimes operator God is as casual
[2:14:39] as or words to a burden and if your
[2:14:42] brethren can't take what you say can
[2:14:44] Gothic and you're not going to get God
[2:14:47] moving if you're in serious the Bible
[2:14:50] clearly says in Matthew 5:37 let's
[2:14:52] you're a be a and your Navy knee you're
[2:14:56] ready for the rest and whatsoever is
[2:15:00] more than these comment of evil
[2:15:04] I would like the 'man know like the word
[2:15:11] how do we serve one another is how we
[2:15:14] serve God so if I am honest and sincere
[2:15:16] with you I will be so cool with God then
[2:15:21] my prayer will be different my life will
[2:15:24] be different my walk with the different
[2:15:27] my talk
[2:15:31] and that's what's all in the truth but
[2:15:34] this is a spirit is not bringing it up
[2:15:36] Trinity this is a spirit all over catch
[2:15:40] your lies I don't care how you dress it
[2:15:45] is a lie if you didn't do it and you
[2:15:48] didn't call and say I can't do it you
[2:15:49] like to him because if you tell me
[2:15:52] you'll come into fixed maggiore and I'm
[2:15:53] dependent on you because I really need
[2:15:55] it fixed on your didn't show you gave me
[2:15:58] a lie to bank and they become NSF not
[2:16:05] sufficient funds do you do it and we
[2:16:16] don't just lie to one another we can
[2:16:17] even tell the pasta I'm pass our own
[2:16:19] pass on do it tomorrow
[2:16:21] I had the brother called me today
[2:16:23] because I heard I knew he was supposed
[2:16:25] to go by me to do something he sent me a
[2:16:27] text I said I can't do it today but I do
[2:16:30] tomorrow and I could Bank that can God
[2:16:36] Bank Hills
[2:16:40] can God Bank yes cuz you depend on his
[2:16:43] world
[2:16:43] what does he depend on if your prayer is
[2:16:50] not something for him to take and God
[2:16:52] hear me God is no respecter person you
[2:16:54] could be in the best change if you're
[2:16:56] hot not right nothing happening and this
[2:17:02] is all over the world the word we have
[2:17:06] is enough to raise the dead every Sunday
[2:17:13] for hosts the dead gonna hear when your
[2:17:17] brother ain't even here we are seen and
[2:17:19] he alive you have people you know when
[2:17:25] they tell you to come here anymore in
[2:17:26] because you're not incoming but you're

[2:17:33] when you get quite like that let's get
[2:17:35] free and at the in Trinidad so I want
[2:17:40] you to treat me nice all right so let me
[2:17:43] move on so he says anything that is not
[2:17:46] here on me Chamitoff even now how we
[2:17:49] serve one another I saw we serve God
[2:17:50] all right now many a time our praise him
[2:17:53] that because his lack sincerity when we
[2:17:55] get real serious with God it will show
[2:17:57] up in a walk with others a man under
[2:17:59] pressure is what he is irony a man under
[2:18:03] pressure is what he is his real true
[2:18:06] characteristics will show when he is
[2:18:08] under pressure a pipe that you say you
[2:18:11] just fix it fix until I open it oh you
[2:18:17] put some tape on it you put whatever it
[2:18:18] is a lot of promise today our pipe join
[2:18:21] us the knock llamas they're not the same
[2:18:25] thing and it's easy to join pipe where's
[2:18:28] another story to get the whole thing to
[2:18:30] work you say a Christian are you
[2:18:37] you sure you're not out Joyner joined us
[2:18:42] brother this sister or join this and
[2:18:44] join that
[2:18:44] god bless god bless Dino enough the life
[2:18:49] is abyssal Whovian you remember take
[2:19:01] these words they are serious there's no
[2:19:06] other shortcut and God looking for his
[2:19:09] people to move from where they are and
[2:19:12] it's the simple things we leave undone
[2:19:16] he's ready and saying God hides and what
[2:19:20] we make it complicated let's let me go
[2:19:25] on so when he's on the pressure gets him
[2:19:31] all riled up stirred up these didn't
[2:19:35] even have to get them riled up he always
[2:19:37] right you ever have people like that
[2:19:41] they always your fritters music god
[2:19:43] bless just I look at him and just say
[2:19:45] sorry
[2:19:53] then you'll see the rail man come on if
[2:19:56] he has a temper it will show I had a
[2:19:59] brother that you stay hit his wife
[2:20:01] trusting betta she will come he see
[2:20:04] relative I'm afraid and he had to get
[2:20:07] serious to stop be thorough
[2:20:11] I said until you get your wife to not be
[2:20:15] afraid of you as if it's the children
[2:20:16] you ain't reached no way she must feel
[2:20:19] comfortable in your present your wife
[2:20:23] comfortable in your purse or your boys
[2:20:25] big on your hand big a vice versa
[2:20:29] because this is women hittin
[2:20:44] [Music]
[2:20:46] so you have a template to a show and
[2:20:48] here is God puts all his children this
[2:20:53] is a path alike because history know how
[2:20:55] to behave what makes it bad is one that
[2:20:59] is not a certain but a day in the house
[2:21:03] the worst thing to have is cousins that
[2:21:05] come in your house and behave bad and
[2:21:07] India but Incas audio so the real
[2:21:16] children know how to behave you know how
[2:21:19] to walk they know how to talk they have
[2:21:21] an experience but it's not only children
[2:21:25] anyhow I hope you are altering or what
[2:21:30] your God that we all are children look I
[2:21:33] gotta go gotta push this I don't want to
[2:21:36] miss miss the rapture might come before
[2:21:39] we see again and I want this to be get
[2:21:40] perfected so it does literally testimony
[2:21:42] could help you may God help you so you
[2:21:46] will see the real man if he has a
[2:21:48] template to show if he's meek it will
[2:21:50] also show if he's meek and gentle now we
[2:21:52] get in there it will also show God put
[2:21:57] all your own pressure on the test to see
[2:21:59] whether there's any hitters flaws
[2:22:03] I love that God is a God of perfection
[2:22:07] you are supposed to be a statue of
[2:22:09] perfection God doesn't do like other men
[2:22:13] after you don't bring it
[2:22:15] why are you going on you checking it so
[2:22:19] after you make the foot you'll kick it
[2:22:20] to see if we could swing cuz you don't
[2:22:24] make sense I've been offered the catwalk
[2:22:25] so when you make the honeys or you
[2:22:29] working good right
[2:22:30] hello every pot working I don't have to
[2:22:34] be standard a head first or he put but
[2:22:36] whatever he did it works and how does he
[2:22:39] know put it on no what
[2:22:40] yes Gordon just called Moses and say hey
[2:22:48] go get some boy since long Moses no yeah
[2:22:54] a job to do it we just didn't know how
[2:22:57] he had to be done we had an idea but the
[2:22:59] idea is not good idea
[2:23:00] Yahweh's us know his ways he thought he
[2:23:03] thought God idea was boxing hit it Bam
[2:23:06] Bam Bam and then God show him that
[2:23:08] naughty way because when he did that the
[2:23:10] other end for you like imagine I tried
[2:23:14] to pop up I ought to run for my life
[2:23:15] and I supposed to be the deliverer so
[2:23:18] maybe I mix it boy I miss it somewhere
[2:23:20] but God and way enough and the backside
[2:23:26] that he doesn't he come from one side
[2:23:28] front seat place of prestige to a place
[2:23:32] where no party no
[2:23:39] and all the others he and the manimals
[2:23:42] these caring care of animals God sir

[2:27:07] original you have see whether Branham
[2:27:12] say he can see horse of young people's
[2:27:13] laugh and any lighter I met up at horse
[2:27:16] so when I was is see we they have our
[2:27:21] own ideas and we don't link it with you
[2:27:24] way and that way we just get tired you
[2:27:30] gain this so let's move on I have to
[2:27:32] move it lighter got to see Israel in the
[2:27:34] Chu State under pressure under pressure
[2:27:39] and this church will never know what it
[2:27:42] is until
[2:27:42] have pressure when God move you from
[2:27:46] your little comfort we say but I don't
[2:27:49] want to move
[2:27:50] well I know if he's our son when you get
[2:27:56] to the one to pray not have to break
[2:28:01] they're not the same enough that they
[2:28:04] were mentioned I want to pray and I have
[2:28:06] to pray what the night is pre-meeting
[2:28:07] where we have to go to pre I just make
[2:28:12] from it in home
[2:28:13] I want to pray and that comes from what
[2:28:17] love and if you're in love you'll be
[2:28:20] sincere that's another problem again
[2:28:22] lack of sincerity is lack of what do you
[2:28:25] know that God had a problem in the first
[2:28:27] church age with all the you notice what
[2:28:31] he said you bump them up oh you're
[2:28:32] dissing your dad and I'm pleased with
[2:28:34] you but no it dies for sage and then men
[2:28:41] get that what we doing down in samia's
[2:28:43] way demlove the first loan and Jesus see
[2:28:49] when he come would I find fit do you
[2:28:51] know fit and love is cousin in fact
[2:28:54] we're ancestor can't go beat or the
[2:28:56] other for me to have it I must have
[2:28:58] confidence and if I have confidence is
[2:29:00] because of a relationship then how you
[2:29:02] could pray and ask God for things and
[2:29:03] you don't have a relationship because
[2:29:04] you're not talking to him
[2:29:09] some of us only talk mime in church what
[2:29:12] kind of relationship is that no wonder
[2:29:15] when you're not gonna know God doesn't
[2:29:16] even return what is looking for
[2:29:18] worshipers what time
[2:29:22] Wow only four people katalk what time
[2:29:26] you could shoot it from me if you don't
[2:29:28] mind what time I said sure not top-load
[2:29:31] what time yes he said let the God that
[2:29:40] is supernatural show himself alive let
[2:29:43] him be God if BL is because if he can
[2:29:47] answer let him answer let it go that
[2:29:49] answer let that God keep his word let
[2:29:51] that God I'll be gone alone I wonder if
[2:29:53] this challenge is not for us to prove in
[2:29:55] this dreadful times the word we preach
[2:29:57] if it is indeed the truth then it got to
[2:29:59] be on display don't you feel that this
[2:30:05] is not something you pray now this is
[2:30:09] Gideon in the house if God is real and
[2:30:18] is true and everything he says is right
[2:30:20] that I want some
[2:30:23] I don't want to be alone
[2:30:28] 195 son hope in the final son but

[2:31:15] it we want it bad thanks me right how

[2:42:05] [Music]
[2:42:11] [Applause]
[2:42:20] sometimes I'm praised a message I had a
[2:42:22] friend in school well we grew up
[2:42:25] together and he was a revolutionary he
[2:42:30] became the commission of police and in
[2:42:32] the time of Bishop he brought me into
[2:42:33] the army to be the bodyguard of the
[2:42:36] prime minister's wife and while we were
[2:42:39] in school with me
[2:42:40] we've argued every single day he against
[2:42:46] God I forgot I'm giving up King given up
[2:42:49] he holy and I hold my own and as we got
[2:42:55] older he got bolder
[2:42:58] I got bolder and then the revolution
[2:43:02] fell like that
[2:43:03] batts and he was left with nothing he
[2:43:09] got the press started to drink
[2:43:15] and we started drifting because now he's
[2:43:18] saying things as I can handle because
[2:43:21] the material God enemies are my enemies
[2:43:26] his friends are my friends whatever side
[2:43:30] he have I am on anyone coming against
[2:43:35] him meets me dices all it is that's what
[2:43:41] it is and we party to this day he thinks
[2:43:47] I abandoned him but I did not abandon
[2:43:50] him God cut the time to this day I don't
[2:43:57] know what I would tell him if I see him
[2:43:58] he's sick dying and I saw God hand in my
[2:44:05] life and I said Lord maybe it's because
[2:44:09] I stood faithful or whatever it is I am
[2:44:13] grateful today I'm still holding my end
[2:44:18] he undoing what are you willing what is
[2:44:25] the thing that keep you going what
[2:44:28] driving you over every time on a
[2:44:32] preacher the full and me much more
[2:44:36] minutes out of time there is a boolean
[2:44:44] there is a pull here let me run so the
[2:44:56] time has come to produce the evidence
[2:44:57] surely we are forced to get dung in
[2:44:59] earnest and get into that secret place
[2:45:02] because let me tell you something
[2:45:03] don't let them people come and ask you
[2:45:05] where is your God a missionary event or
[2:45:11] our India and they say hello
[2:45:14] don't bring new tracks do bring nothing
[2:45:16] everything you bring in we already know
[2:45:18] in fact the Bible come from us we stop
[2:45:21] Mohammed use of Jesus but until you
[2:45:24] could bring at Jesus that could raise
[2:45:26] the dead and open eyes to talk to us but
[2:45:31] Abraham said that missionary left with
[2:45:33] his help turned on and he tail between
[2:45:35] your legs not willing to tell them there
[2:45:38] is somebody that can do that that can
[2:45:41] make the word live Isis succulent people
[2:45:47] now for this for the Christian faith
[2:45:51] now there's two questions in the world
[2:45:52] let's Christians any message and they
[2:45:55] trace on outside I'm not talking about
[2:45:56] the outside one's talking body here if
[2:46:00] you have to come to that place that's
[2:46:03] where you really go know why you're
[2:46:04] believing
[2:46:08] it's not knowing them right now
[2:46:10] everything aromas nice but if you had to
[2:46:15] give it up account and they said hey if
[2:46:20] you recant we spare you but if you keep
[2:46:24] in that name you go in you don't have a
[2:46:28] prayer life you don't have a
[2:46:29] relationship is going you will tell them
[2:46:30] hello I go in with you
[2:46:32] I mean it you know what the devil tells
[2:46:37] you what to tell God Joe whatever you do
[2:46:41] him is all right but if I could hit the
[2:46:43] body I was squeezing day and we could
[2:46:48] talk holmen's all mysteries on all
[2:46:50] testimonies until or unless they touch
[2:46:53] this this real thing are you willing to
[2:46:58] make that sacrifice in prayer
[2:47:01] nicely real thing that secret place
[2:47:06] where he dwells and takes of take us up
[2:47:10] to where he is we can shorten that's
[2:47:12] good we can run and that's good we can
[2:47:14] sing that's good but there is more and
[2:47:16] we ought to go after it to see a living
[2:47:20] manifestation of God for when the
[2:47:23] supernatural is presented faith Rises
[2:47:26] [Applause]
[2:47:28] and what we have now has the rise but
[2:47:31] Abraham said many cars gonna do it what
[2:47:35] they have it cannot do it and if you
[2:47:37] forgot and you go back in the seals
[2:47:38] which came from heaven and drawn by the
[2:47:41] angel that anything on that tree God is
[2:47:44] up the devil
[2:47:47] you like the hitter he said that is
[2:47:52] pagan worship but a parent was too plain
[2:47:55] go back in your books if you have many
[2:47:59] times you give a lot of credence the
[2:48:01] things that got dumped
[2:48:04] he dumped why because he saw the Train
[2:48:08] of Nimrod I never never stop walking
[2:48:13] step by step Jesus Judas he never will
[2:48:20] stop until we go Soph it has to rise and
[2:48:28] what we have now has to rise now you
[2:48:31] looking for body change I don't have a
[2:48:33] body change but but it changes move it
[2:48:35] it's called rapture in rapture and fit
[2:48:39] is a higher fit know if you're not fit
[2:48:41] to stop you to take I went low to take
[2:48:47] small one if you don't have fat for that
[2:48:55] which body changing there's no such
[2:49:01] thing as well I feel sorry for you
[2:49:04] no you feel sorry for yourself Jesus
[2:49:06] told that is Madonna weep for your self
[2:49:10] I already in you commanded and for your
[2:49:18] children your body has to change and
[2:49:21] it's good to rejoice but reality is your
[2:49:24] name there for body change we call
[2:49:29] remember that book written long before
[2:49:31] we born and God have names and double
[2:49:35] not this not a book like Diana this is
[2:49:40] called a page ym is the book there's any
[2:49:46] mine that he alone knows and he allocate
[2:49:51] 144 for the Jews I wonder how much he
[2:49:53] allocate for the sentence God is omnibus
[2:49:57] go ahead
[2:49:58] you wanna hear up numbers 1 to 8 and one
[2:50:06] of the 8 was not his how much went in
[2:50:10] the AK check and see the animals and
[2:50:15] contain them lights greased upper room
[2:50:22] 128 of numbers small numbers they are
[2:50:29] about 1.5 million people in the message
[2:50:31] or wrong the world how much names in the
[2:50:35] book because you have a lot of people
[2:50:39] who are attracted to the book they like
[2:50:42] the book the love about the book but
[2:50:46] they're naming one the book and it's
[2:50:49] easy to know where name is I think but
[2:50:51] at this brother he talked about why's
[2:50:53] the name well that name had to be in the
[2:50:55] book no name surprise God none hello I
[2:51:06] cannot surprise God you cannot surprise

[2:51:14] will see if I could get some time hello
[2:51:19] you missed the boat
[2:51:21] I said it's not hope is now fate and
[2:51:26] they've gotten talking to you then
[2:51:29] something wrong because he prepares he
[2:51:33] what Jesus said all that them is here
[2:51:35] none is lost and we were there in the
[2:51:38] room with him when you are they always
[2:51:44] close to him

[2:52:01] with you especially today we need real
[2:52:05] comfortable I gotta go I had something
[2:52:09] here I must leave with you
[2:52:12] Pentecost can do denominations cannot do
[2:52:15] it then it leaves just a little bright
[2:52:16] and he always said little bright
[2:52:19] my sheep know my voice no I heard my
[2:52:25] sheep and he didn't put chips because
[2:52:28] sheeps is not a word and sheeps is not
[2:52:34] our you can say single a sheep Lordships
[2:52:38] so he said my sheep no ships no no my
[2:52:49] voice not will know already know I heard

[2:53:00] that bride will hear is still small
[2:53:03] voice while dong on her right the honest
[2:53:06] in his Shekinah presence and they will
[2:53:09] bring that rapture in feet we look
[2:53:12] forward we look around their groups look
[2:53:15] along the groups in the message there's
[2:53:17] an increase in sickness there's increase
[2:53:20] in hospitalization like never before the
[2:53:24] rates of divorce I never thought I'd
[2:53:26] live to see so much divorce in the
[2:53:27] message is that they never heard Mary's
[2:53:29] own divorce what about nothing to do
[2:53:32] with them is that fellow named Nimrod
[2:53:37] unless desire to conquer and have a
[2:53:41] church like grace and his church is

[2:54:11] divorce rates on the rise
[2:54:13] hospitalization under eyes more people
[2:54:15] need more prayer and the plagues and

[2:54:53] nobody knows the day or the hour God
[2:54:56] written on you

[2:55:10] Prophet says if you're in common I will
[2:55:12] squeeze you because I'm gonna lose none
[2:55:19] and the devil done a my all and God said
[2:55:25] you're coming after them but they are
[2:55:26] mine and my sheep will hear my voice and
[2:55:34] hearing the voice is good what if I say

[3:07:36] sing without ceasing
[3:07:37] hello wild why not beam up of my oh god
[3:07:41] casual like me and you better you better
[3:07:46] take the word for what he says it needs
[3:07:48] no private God let me go again but after
[3:08:01] the fire still that wasn't enough and
[3:08:04] that has happened when people backslide
[3:08:07] you heard me that is happening the scene
[3:08:10] go there hearing God and the power of
[3:08:12] God moving through and they want more
[3:08:13] than that Israel had reached that place
[3:08:17] and Elijah just did not know what to do
[3:08:21] and there are ministers who just don't
[3:08:23] know what to do we get
[3:08:29] so what did he do he took off but when
[3:08:34] I'm said I'm glad that there is a
[3:08:36] juniper tree me too you got you have one
[3:08:42] dole I know
[3:08:44] look at my casual if you don't have one
[3:08:49] get one this morning but unit batteries
[3:08:53] are kind of bushy thing that does give
[3:08:55] shade so much I can sleep and you
[3:09:00] can eat and you can lay and God like
[3:09:05] juniper trees why president says they've
[3:09:10] got meet him in a juniper tree day and I
[3:09:13] don't have Juna pretty down here in the
[3:09:15] same situation you come in president
[3:09:21] except there's a thing in law I don't
[3:09:23] know be a lawyer I said when president
[3:09:24] said there was wind case by that they
[3:09:29] did that direct so my case is that you
[3:09:31] in the case and if there's precedent
[3:09:33] said what we'll do for death I want mine
[3:09:37] too
[3:09:38] [Applause]
[3:09:44] so let me run quickly he said oh I'm so
[3:09:48] glad there is a juniper tree we're all
[3:09:49] God's people needs to go know me what
[3:09:51] say the Prophet you say love needs to go
[3:09:54] not should go need is something higher
[3:09:57] in others you must do it when they are
[3:10:02] discouraged or when they are
[3:10:04] disappointed or when they are dismissed
[3:10:08] I'm giving us some more adjectives but
[3:10:11] disliked or had a big one or the boos
[3:10:14] are nothing like that word a or
[3:10:22] disinherited as a new thing now
[3:10:25] everybody who was supposed to get that
[3:10:26] that somebody if they inheritance a
[3:10:28] natural type spiritual or damaged your
[3:10:34] people are the stolen damaged goods
[3:10:37] nobody want to touch them obviously for
[3:10:40] people he she's damaged goods as if you
[3:10:43] in a damaged
[3:10:47] as far as icons on all of us get damaged
[3:10:52] and what did God do with the damage you
[3:11:01] see I didn't come to call on damaged
[3:11:04] stuff and I the problem in the church
[3:11:09] too many were just people too many good
[3:11:11] people 20 nice but I was nice I was
[3:11:14] wretched I was a rich and I knew that
[3:11:20] that's another thing if you don't accept
[3:11:23] your was a rich drama problem cause
[3:11:25] everybody a cop is he did Lord oh listen
[3:11:28] he doesn't he or he interact ordained
[3:11:30] and yet people who does analyze he could
[3:11:35] make it why he can't make it rain on
[3:11:37] walking crooked oh yeah I know but I
[3:11:40] want that wall job is just identifying
[3:11:43] yeah yeah you see I want to make I talk
[3:11:46] to that one but not I want long hear
[3:11:49] expert remember X beans they out of it
[3:11:53] [Applause]
[3:11:54] we can analyze the pasta message and
[3:11:57] annoyed modern he telling him what he
[3:12:00] preached when God gave it to him
[3:12:04] interpreters like Nimrod
[3:12:10] you know what mockery means the
[3:12:13] interpreter of the gods and mockery was
[3:12:17] named Redwoods cush was Bell was fellas
[3:12:20] and by the way welcome from River rebel
[3:12:26] rebel Belle is BL so all rebels get
[3:12:32] their origin and the connection from
[3:12:36] Nimrod
[3:12:40] words are very important don't minimize
[3:12:44] them everything means something where
[3:12:49] did I learn that in prayer everything
[3:12:52] God say have a meaning when you're
[3:12:54] reading the exodus I can say already
[3:12:56] lamby so and this year and it's a lord
[3:12:58] or looking for if it wasn't important
[3:13:00] you wouldn't have put it it's just that
[3:13:03] you can't see it not because it that
[3:13:06] don't mean you have iron significance
[3:13:11] meaning don't tell them names and you've
[3:13:17] been here is not by chance you could
[3:13:23] have been somewhere else and if you're
[3:13:25] not somewhere else you're here in all
[3:13:29] right then make it count
[3:13:32] you don't have much time
[3:13:34] make it count I saw a man Welles listen
[3:13:39] to me preach in Grenada and as they're
[3:13:41] preaching waiting like the service he
[3:13:43] would get up and walk out and I knew he
[3:13:47] was walking out because you didn't like
[3:13:48] the message and God didn't make me do
[3:13:51] not I just preaching and not trying to
[3:13:52] reach him and a preacher and I'm not
[3:13:54] never change and bad gas stroke so I say
[3:13:58] like Elijah he go change change what the
[3:14:02] man died wife compeletly but to be
[3:14:04] looked at it going on and in his
[3:14:09] condition temper high like a kite and I
[3:14:14] have learned sickness don't change you
[3:14:16] death don't change you better be careful
[3:14:19] and aspirated in you come when you're
[3:14:22] ready wanted to go is when you go make
[3:14:25] children
[3:14:32] don't play with God you get rid of us
[3:14:37] for it now the word come to cut it off
[3:14:43] don't cut it off Monday and Wednesday
[3:14:46] when I look for it
[3:14:47] like that people who love strawberry
[3:14:48] cigarettes and go back for the but again
[3:14:55] same every week and our week time you
[3:15:02] can't sterilize you notice the messages
[3:15:09] is the same message with a different
[3:15:10] slant to the same people know if the
[3:15:16] people growing the message will grow
[3:15:18] whether you can't even go higher if you
[3:15:20] angry and after a while he acts good
[3:15:26] what to do because if it happened in
[3:15:30] lighter who was God prophet we can
[3:15:33] minimize nobody every minister goes do
[3:15:37] that I go to it I would preach and then
[3:15:42] I got a message after a message somebody
[3:15:45] fight on the way home in the bus
[3:15:54] and you can tell me in Trinidad I do
[3:15:56] happen spirits are the same they remove
[3:16:02] I remember this colored lady who got hit
[3:16:06] by a car so they asked her if she wanted
[3:16:08] to sue for damages that's another new
[3:16:10] thing in defeat she said lost in no
[3:16:15] child
[3:16:15] I don't need damage I need repairs and I
[3:16:21] think that's what the church need today
[3:16:23] a lot of repair you like I needed it and
[3:16:29] we find that place of repair
[3:16:31] under the juniper tree I won't stop just
[3:16:33] now cuz I can't give everything here
[3:16:36] because you see there's something here
[3:16:38] there's a there's a current there's a
[3:16:40] whirlwind there's a there's a spin I can
[3:16:44] feel good talking and food is something
[3:16:49] when it nice it has heated slow
[3:16:56] nobody ever going KFC and just leave
[3:16:59] walking and gasoline and KFC's the worst
[3:17:03] food ina see people aside the big so I
[3:17:10] say if I had a cave see diamond comin in
[3:17:14] and they will Sydney and chew the board
[3:17:17] well it's not the board is not born to
[3:17:20] the thing that is the period she came
[3:17:23] from cause he used to be born is not
[3:17:27] born it's soft bonus something when
[3:17:29] you're bagging suppose a crack
[3:17:38] I hope this mean you're taking it way
[3:17:48] Ridge all right coming down so Elijah
[3:17:52] was so disappointed think he had done
[3:17:54] exactly what God told him to do and that
[3:17:56] the people would believe but he found
[3:17:58] out that all the miracles God told him
[3:18:00] to perform which he did still Jezebel
[3:18:02] not only refused what he said but she
[3:18:05] countered what he was saying and there's
[3:18:07] a lot of counters in the message in
[3:18:11] Grenada is a column counter-revolution
[3:18:13] once you in agree what Bishop said use a
[3:18:14] counter you contain what go today you
[3:18:20] have a better way there's no better way
[3:18:23] to bring a child but it's true word Lima
[3:18:28] if a woman make a baby and she's in
[3:18:30] labor
[3:18:30] she will never be close to the child the
[3:18:33] more your labor is the moral challenge
[3:18:34] of matchstick is everything watch them
[3:18:38] to have hard labor you cannot get the
[3:18:41] favor that child where are you wrong
[3:18:42] alright but if she the next field nuttin
[3:18:47] or hosting nothing just Remington him
[3:18:49] spin our are closing
[3:19:01] jeez Abell counted what he's in and she
[3:19:04] said I was stopping camp in and if he
[3:19:06] didn't stop our chopper fee head talk
[3:19:10] about that test and when the devil gets
[3:19:13] a hole of a person he just does him
[3:19:15] often
[3:19:16] Elijah felt heartbroken one day we does
[3:19:20] feel sometimes hosts we feel sometimes
[3:19:22] when disappointment arise in spite of
[3:19:24] all the signs he did no change so the
[3:19:26] skirts are not broken he ran to the
[3:19:28] juniper tree for refuge and rest there
[3:19:30] he was over there all by himself he had
[3:19:32] left his servants further back and gone
[3:19:35] on by himself
[3:19:36] and when he got serious with God we will
[3:19:39] and when we get serious regard we will
[3:19:40] come to him alone alone you ain't
[3:19:44] serious until it is you alone here
[3:19:46] no friends no father no mother you alone
[3:19:50] that's when you're ready all right yeah
[3:19:54] but I've just my little key in a nice
[3:19:57] little song when we get serious with God
[3:20:02] he will come to him we will we will come
[3:20:04] to him alone in sincerity under the
[3:20:07] juniper tree all of us ought to have a
[3:20:09] place we can go when trouble arises
[3:20:11] let's bow our heads
[3:20:20] this medicine
[3:20:31] while your heads are bowed and your eyes
[3:20:37] are closed I want you to think about
[3:20:41] this all your problems all the things
[3:20:46] you suffer all the disappointments
[3:20:48] everything that you got you do you have
[3:20:50] a place of refuge with God a place of
[3:20:53] retreat a place where you spend time in
[3:20:56] prayer not an hour but a time when time
[3:21:02] runs out when the curtains drop down and
[3:21:05] the world is shut out once the thing we
[3:21:12] need to go back we can't keep runnin and
[3:21:17] we can keep shipping if you want that
[3:21:19] change then you have to do something to
[3:21:21] get that change
[3:21:28] fit is what you believe that God will do
[3:21:35] but you got to do something to you have
[3:21:38] to accept what he said you have to
[3:21:40] believe what you say
[3:21:42] are you gonna just move along with the
[3:21:44] life you have or you want something
[3:21:47] deeper with going until you lay in his
[3:21:50] presence
[3:21:51] remember he lied I went there and he
[3:21:53] laid and then God dropped down he sent
[3:21:57] that Raven Raven is the most intelligent
[3:21:59] bird in the world to feed him with
[3:22:03] meanness in under the juniper tree God
[3:22:06] feeds you he takes care of you that's
[3:22:10] when you make an experience that's when
[3:22:12] nobody could come and tell you something
[3:22:13] else too many people have been easily
[3:22:16] led you need a personal touch with God
[3:22:20] God wants you to go deeper and it can't
[3:22:24] work unless you go down lay in his face
[3:22:30] there's things to be done here God is
[3:22:34] identified this place to lead the charge
[3:22:39] that's one of the reasons I'm here this
[3:22:41] morning he always has a place this is
[3:22:47] your juniper tree have you gone to the
[3:22:51] place where you forgot to come in the
[3:22:52] house of God and just lay or you're busy
[3:22:55] going you don't want to find yourself in
[3:22:59] trouble and then go and lay it won't be
[3:23:03] genuine it won't be true it be because
[3:23:08] you need him not because you love him
[3:23:11] I'm talking to Christians if you're not
[3:23:15] yet saved then there's no what time I
[3:23:17] good as any because you are running out
[3:23:18] of time what I'm calling the believers
[3:23:22] now the charges go deeper
[3:23:26] normally in Grenada I don't call an
[3:23:28] altar call I let the spirit speak to you
[3:23:31] what does the spirit tell you stay where
[3:23:34] you are
[3:23:35] go as you're going or are you willing to
[3:23:39] be sincere and be honest and said god I
[3:23:41] cannot continue the way I'm going I've
[3:23:45] got to get something Maury
[3:23:49] well the same place you got salvation is
[3:23:52] the same place you'll get that deeper
[3:23:53] work on your knees maybe I'll break that
[3:23:58] this moan and say isn't that somebody
[3:24:00] would fall on the knees
[3:24:02] it's a Lord God all me break me and
[3:24:08] change me
[3:24:13] is there somebody after all that you
[3:24:18] heard are you going to continue how
[3:24:21] you're going are you satisfied with your
[3:24:24] prayer life what if something come in
[3:24:27] your life are you satisfied that there's
[3:24:28] in this connection with you and God you
[3:24:32] can bring him down or you could go up
