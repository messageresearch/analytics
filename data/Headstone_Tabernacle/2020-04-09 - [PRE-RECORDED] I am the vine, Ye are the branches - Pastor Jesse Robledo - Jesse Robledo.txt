trouble doesn't you haven't got it yet because chuckling but you're gonna break out take a break the Holy Spirit or should I be Jesus and his raiment shone at the Sun and God Himself said this is my beloved son here in other words there it is what he says is all of it and then he was given equal of course it was God but God in the flesh of Jesus Christ manifested himself to the people God adopted his own son now when the Pentecostal church are these people in his last days here that's beginning to find a new birth being born again they taught that settled it no sir your ups and downs in and solves things like that God can't please she was a son but when you have you when you stay in the kingdom he didn't say stay in the medicine Association he did not see that stain emrys's groupid he did not see that he said when you stay in the kingdom stay in the gospel stay right no stay wrong steer right one of these days god no convention pastor God will call you out and set you aside and adopt you as a son before the people and give you something that will shape the message with it hallelujah not just to shake the church shake the nation's we wasn't all to prophesy the church we record the prophesy the nation's we had speakin just the Union we are speaking international that's the voice that God put in a bride oh yes it redundant like I've never heard it before once more the world will hear direct from God not books and tapes no living poppin apples literally pesos God walking on two feet let me see the brimstar amen hallelujah hallelujah someone to introduce you to this morning not a bitumen but a better man Oh hallelujah praise God got a better man a better man be seated [Applause] [Music] remind me I said better manage many of a wholesaler of bertocchi Samuel this Samuel how long you were born so on I done with him I fire you know even though he's fired in the position but I fired him I found a better man go on annoying one in a son sir Jesse bring out David Oh David is coming alright just one more mode option Brown says here gotta sweeten train the places Church in position the manifests himself not talk offense but more talk we had a for 50 years try the places Church to manifest himself getting one he can walk through and says there is my spirit flowing freely I can work here get another one over here and please and I can please him adoption manifested him take him out put a ceremony him I visit him with an angel tell him something but if he's making up something that won't work we had a lot of that I mean manifestations the sons of God when God manifests himself he sends him out what he does he go what he says is the truth what he does is the truth what he does he manifests Christ how do you judge him by the way he associated with the ministers Association how do you judge him by the way he steers with the world right with the world last what I have here is that we have lived two looters each Wesley's age all down to the ages and the tentacles of each each age is given a promise of the world and the people of that age that manifests that promise world is the seed of that age you know it's almost comical when I guess somebody put on somebody a shock they thought a shock this one is shocking with shock but the Prophet said the ones here the people that manifest the promised world is the seed of the eat it has no visible manifestations sorry it doesn't have new people and infestation the people that manifest the promise would of the age is the seed of that age according to what Jesus said right here they are the children of the kingdom that's right the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operate and choose children is those seeds of the kingdom of that age oh praise the name of the Lord let's say is the life behind the name that make the demons tremble as we stand and invite God's servant to the pulpit a gesture of little all the years I've known him have never heard a tweet false doctrine like the preacher no never heard him preach some kind of cool stuff that you can find anywhere but here it is he's gonna bring forth to you the Word of God it's the line behind mein gott match oh it's the life being randomly [Music] the light behind me this is a life behind the name that makes the demons tremble is life behind the name that makes the proud heart humble it was God who devised a plan that in all things as a man so he could give you must a life behind hallelujah let's give him praise somebody I'll enjoy it to the land we thank you we praise your Holy Name amen or the overhead asks me what song I would like to come up on and I thought of this old song you know because we're back to the life a lot of people have skirted to life you know is good I've heard many good teachings and many good preachings but you know unless the life is there that's the only thing that's gonna shake the devil's tail and then preach you won't do it amen it's the life what we need in Jeffersonville Indiana today is thousands of live not preached voices but live voices that's the Thunder that shakes the Delta hallelujah amen and if we have that light the devil is finished this morning hey hallelujah to the lamb amen and so while we sing this one more time let's greet somebody Amen and say good morning I know we have probably done this before this morning several times amen but it's to life behind a name that makes the deep and tremble [Music] that makes stuff humble it was God who devised a plan meadows they take [Music] is the light behind me that makes the diamond scramble this is right behind at me that messed up our humble it was God who devised a plan [Music] so here give us the light hi hallelujah to the whale breeze this wonderful name hey man hallelujah God richly bless you you may be seated just a moment while I greet you how many are happy to be in the house you know we go to work during the week and we're tired and weary but David said one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after if there was one thing that you desired some would desire a million dollars some would desire this that but David desire to dwell in his house all the days of his life and we're so thankful that God has given us this opportunity amen to come in his presence I greet you this morning in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ I want to just sincerely say that I am delighted delighted to be back in Trinidad amen I was very touched last year with the fellowship and the unity of the spirit that I felt and we have got to really work on that area of the unity of the Spirit you know we've got to get started and we know that the unity of the Spirit can only come by the spirit but if we can get started thank God can do the rest Amen hallelujah so but anyway I am here to just give a little testimony and these fine preachers that have come before me brother Peter and brother Paul I I was thinking of changing my name last night how on earth can I follow Peter and Paul just trying to make a name up or something a Silas or something or you know perhaps may have been more more powerful but amen fear not in his eye you know you're not in a vision Amen we are in reality here amen you know I like what brother Thea Ovid spoke there the book of Acts regarding Paul you know he Paul was of course God's man and you know of course there was some suspicion around him especially when the the scorpion had bit him but it didn't break Paul's strut he just shook it into the fire you know and what I want to say by saying this is that the devil could label you you can either choose to wear that label or you could choose to and by the grace of God you see that label did not stick amen and I come here humbly to put my shoulder to the wheel and because I always look at a man's motive his objective what he's trying to achieve and I like how brother Ovid is inclusive and there's no denomination there's no I'm always I would say I love Brotherhood I'm in nobody circle I love Brotherhood see Brotherhood is interred it's an international thing you see because it's one of the things that the that one of those caterpillars and Palma worms ate up you know Brotherhood and he hates Brotherhood and I'm here to make sure that I stand with my brother and the fine ministers who are here no doubt could have could probably do a better job than I can today but I do want to say that I'm happy I bring you greetings from original faith Gospel Tabernacle amen I also want to thank God for all the specials that went forth and and my wife will sang charity amen god bless you Rebecca now I know she does not want this said but I will say it because I just feel to say it it's her birthday today and she's 18 years old I just don't know how I get older she gets younger I just can't figure that out amen but you know when you stop counting birthdays as well that's as that's how old you are you stop we're not living in this time you know we're living in eternity so therefore I appreciate my wife and I thank her for the song the God richly bless you thank you once again brother Peter for that message Adam wear out that I like that where do you hide a tree I never heard that in the forest amen time for hiding has come is come to his end and we are certainly here to declare the gospel of God we have got to the hour is late we cannot play with God God is not to be played with you see we've got to mean what we say and say what we mean and brother Paul god bless you richly for the wonderful message the manifestation of a token amen we certainly do appreciate you for that message and how the Holy Spirit came down last evening so I pray that God would say something today that would bless his people it's we're not here to see somebody or any particular preacher whatever we're here to hear from God and I believe if we come with that expectation God will never disappoint us see because we receive what we come expecting so therefore I feel very humbled and and I thank God for my precious brother ovid we've been friends for many years and one thing I just want to say is this okay brother Overton I we we go way back we've traveled the world in many places and we've had a very healthy friendship and one thing that I appreciate for that overt is that he's always been a friend to me amen I appreciate that very much and spite it's not conditional you know you have people sometimes that are your friend based on conditions and those conditions changed and you don't know Lord come to find it but brother obut has always been around I appreciate your pastor may God bless him this church a man this work and may the Lord prosper 'it we ever prosper him and prosper this work here on this island made it reflect Jesus Christ because world is longing to see Jesus we have we have heard many ministers many fine sermons the world is longing to see Jesus and I believe we are living at the time of the manifestation of the sons of God they're going to feed Jesus I will guarantee you they're going to see Jesus hallelujah where will he be mister Jesus in you and I praise God hallelujah snot it won't be that we are actually professing it it will be God manifesting himself amen that's the that's the Jesus that the world wants to say anyway so let's stand to our feet as we go straight to the word I don't want to keep you too long I had asked your pastor how long do I have and I always have a tendency of going over my time and I don't want to do that this morning I know we have meals in between services and so forth so but once again I am happy to be here I want to draw your attention to the book of John verse 15 and also verse 15 Saint John 15 verse 1 Saint John 13 verse 34 are you ready amen you know my world my words can fail but God's Word cannot fail and if we did nothing but read the scripture we would be blessed amen Saint John 15 I like this dis just thought I just want to give you a little testimonials before I get into it this thought came to me while I was packing to come here you know I had I had some messages and things that had preached impact and the Lord had dropped this thought in my heart and I you know how you speak to the Lord well I'm packing I had handled but he he he gave it to me so I know that the Lord will bless so the title of my message if I would before I forget I am the vine and ye are the branches and I like how God distinguishes that because no matter how much God we become or like God we will never be God I am the vine and you had the branches so we'll get into this here just a few minutes amen st. John 5 and verse 1 I am the true vine not just a vine but the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purchased it that it may bring forth more fruit so therefore don't worry about the trials and tribulations you have a few little fruits here and there God wants more fruit that he's going to purge it amen because he wants more fruit from you amen the trials of this life is more precious than gold amen and now ye are cleansed through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the French or listen to this as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself a man except it abide in the vine now therefore you cannot join the vine you cannot you have to be born into the vine amen no man no more can ye except ye abide in me now let's read that again as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for o listen to this for without me ye can do nothing oh I like that position without him we could do nothing amen we could try be a good Christian but without him we can do nothing amen because god this is fruit time and sea time bride time and I believe that we are all looking for the same thing and we are all striving for the same thing but we have to use God's Way of doing it see hallelujah there's no other way to bring forth truth he said I am the vine ye are the branches so therefore if a man abideth not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if now here's the condition of this promise if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you hiren oh my hearin is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples amen Saint John chapter 13 we just go back to verses or two chapters rather st. John chapter 13 and verse 34 verse 34 a new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another now listen to this next these next few words as I have loved you that ye also love one another now God's love is the highest form of love we know and he wants us to love one another as he also loved us I'm not talking about a filial conditional love I'm talking about an agape love amen as we are reaching and approaching that great headstone a man the stone of power the stone which the builders have rejected and refused has become the headstone of the corner amen it's the universal unconditional love that remains the same regardless amen of circumstances and situations amen that is how he loved us and by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have love one for on amen may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let us just bow our heads in a word of Prayer our Heavenly Father we have read your word Lord any man who can read English and read his Bible can read the context of it father but Lord we asked that the author father who wrote the word Lord would come down among us Lord and reveal the context Lord and reveal the meaning and reveal Lord to us that which you have in store for us this morning Lord we take ourselves out of the way and father we ask that you would bless your people and may the Spirit of Almighty God move from chair to chair heart to heart father down in the basement in the lower level and out in the the yards father may your spirit be felt all over the place father for we know that there's a prophecy that went forth this in itself shall make come to pass the tremendous victory and love divine father so we don't seek another message we don't seek another revelation we don't seek another anything this in itself shall make come to pass a tremendous victory and love divine so we're looking for the tremendous victory father God victory over ourselves victory over Lord anything that would keep us from dashing into the presence of Almighty God so we ask that you would take control of this service and we ask it in a wonderful name of Jesus Christ amen and amen god bless you you may be seated amen well over the years I have become a slow starter but I trust that God would kick us into another gear and just shortly here I have to I'm not as young as I used to be you know I used to run the pulpit all around and I still do that from time to time but the point I want to make today is really as I said the title I am the vine and ye are the branches you know the Prophet said that God had a beautiful bride tree on a day of Pentecost that was a wonderful tree signs wonders and miracles was was vindicated you know I mean God I mean he didn't just have a church that he called the church God himself went with them everywhere working amen these signs and wonders and miracles amen and no apostle no teacher at that time anybody who was placed in the body of Christ and God was using them never ever to credit for anything that God did amen so if that be the case God is looking for a group of people God is looking for a bride that will come back to a place where we can get out of the way and God can use us in a way that he used the first Apostolic Church I think I just think that we just get in a way sometime amen and when we learn how to get it out of the way then God can move and do the things that he promised to do amen brother Brad said what is a gift a gift is to know how to get out of the way praise this wonderful name hallelujah they were spirit filled and worked and I like that spirit fill and word fan the Word of God that was in Jesus Christ hey man who fed them a mint for three and a half years or so in his ministry and even though they didn't understand all the things that he was speaking but yet they were had and it went in a form of a see oh listen you may say I don't understand what's going on you don't have to understand you have to just believe what God is saying hallelujah he never said do you understand he said do you believe a man and faith in a man the right attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass because God said so all repeats are gone explain that to me preacher I cannot explain it Amen I just believe it because God said so there's gonna be a dynamics revival God said so there's going to be manifestation the sons of God God said so I can't explain it praise God but I believe it because God said so go over be to God the world wants an explanation but let me tell you something I don't have an explanation but I have a faith in my heart praise God I like what the brother said one time I'm not here to wait for something to happen I'm here to make something happen glory be to God if we can get started that God can do the rest hallelujah normally be to god she's spirit-filled and were fed oh my think of it God all that God was he poured it into Christ hey man and Christ we know according to brother branham how he spoke he said that Christ was the mystery of God revealed all that was in Christ all that was in God rather he poured it into pranks so he walked the earth as a mystery they wanted to know who God was they had to go through Christ because he was unfolding that great mystery he came in the volume of the book hallelujah hey glory be to God and brother Brad said he was a mystic to the world so if he was a mystic to the world amen we today are all that Christ was he pours it into the church so that we are the mystery of Christ revealed and if he was a mystic to the world so will we be mystics to the world hallelujah hallelujah hey man I like that now amen as we getting warmed up now praise God the same spirit life that was in Jesus now I'm referring to those that were baptized with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost a man I don't know what your teaching is or what people may be preaching today but I believe in a guru good old-fashioned back to God Holy Ghost revival have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe a and back to the original Bible back to the apostolic teaching back to where the Word of God is laying praise God hallelujah hey you know what brother and say it was a theme of every apostle and if you are an apostle or you claim to be an apostle you've got to preach the same hey have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe the Holy Ghost will change your life the Holy Ghost will change your water the Holy Ghost exceed your aptitude lower it be to God the Holy Ghost is fire fire fire on nature's need to be changed glory be to God glory be to God hallelujah oh my lord that's what I want amen listen you can say anything you're this and you're that you're this you're that but what happens when a young man a man falls and trips and say oh he made that and they heard in the convention a man that they were this does God failed God cannot fail what they should be saying hallelujah is have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that's where you've got to get started Oh hallelujah hey man go Ruby to God you know I haven't changed you know sorry maybe you maybe see it at a moment I will talk about spirit life spirit life amen the same life that was in Jesus flowing through the predestinated by a branches these branches were not on the tree they were born into the tree and brother Bram said if this bright tree ever bring forth another branch it'll write another book of acts behind her hallelujah let me tell you the original branchy early church they had the fruits they had the leaves they have the bark they had the SAP light fame had all of these things were working in harmony amen hallelujah and one beautiful thing that I like Amen that the brother was mentioning it yesterday hey man how God could so Tabernacle his people where they can say but they can take notice that they have been with Jesus now you don't even have to say anything see we think that we are identifying ourselves by saying things it's not what you say is how you live that's what shakes the devil hallelujah remember when Jesus was passing through the tombs amen those Devils shouted out oh Jesus have you come before to cast us out before time they recognized that he was Messiah hallelujah hey Manny God is going to have a church team ahead hallelujah with the same spirit the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead shall dwell in a bride a man glory be to God that's what I believe got to keep it balanced you know huh Amen hallelujah amen so therefore they had joy hey man hey joy oh yes they did there's a lot of people don't believe in joy today it's okay well if they don't believe in joy let them not believe in joy but they had joy how many believes I had joy how many still have joy they man hallelujah that time they had wonders they had miracles amen hallelujah but you see what I want you to understand amen but all of these things took place because there was a source of energy that was beyond themselves amen and a source the power the energy a met was in divine the life that Jesus had was in define if you abide in me and my words abide in you you will have that energy to do the things that he said that we would Luke glory be to God but you gotta abide in divine glory be to God hallelujah hey that's Zoey you know amen eternal life there's only one form of eternal life Amen that Zoe that's the life of Christ amen that's a life of Emma ham he had no beginning he had no end hallelujah amen and listen when you filled with the Holy Ghost he fills you with Zoe and you can no more die than God and self came back glory be to God because in you is eternal life you come from God and you go back to God again nowhere be to God Hey start testifying about that you know you know we have got to preserve said if we confess our Prada what we believe confess it Amen that God takes that confession and he can be touched by the hearing by the feeling of our infirmities and he hears our confession then God has to intercede for what you just said you put God on the spot Amen God shall deliver me God shall heal me you are positive that's your confession you're not negative you're speaking it hey man because you're speaking his word now if it wasn't his word that he has he's norm he's not obligated to that but if it's his word that he said oh my god hallelujah I'm gonna make intercession for that son I'm gonna make intercession for that daughter oh holiday and watch God come down because he's backing up his word this vine was the great source of power Jesus made it very clear and let us never forget this church he said I am the vine and you are the branches hallelujah to the lamb without me ye can do nothing I [Music] like that you know why it puts God in his place and it puts me in my place oh yeah that means me without God I am Finnish God without me he's still God no repeats of God hallelujah which means that God does not need you me he's still God hallelujah oh praise God hallelujah he's still gone he's still in a fiery furnace today he's in the fiery furnace there's a song that was sung by somebody I heard some time ago and he said I heard long ago how the fourth man coming to fire and he asked his mama this is according to the lyrics where is f fourth man today he said he's still in the fire he's still there he's in the fire of trials that you're going through let me tell you something you don't even have the strength to hold on to God you're not holding on to him he's holding on to you [Applause] because your predestinated before the foundation of the world no repeats our God amen he has never lost one not one they do the calculations but Isaac that's a hundred percent he never failed he still the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world what's his name Jesus and that's that's the personal here to brag about here to brag about Jesus a man a man let's continue [Applause] Hey now there's been a long time since I've been worn out you wear me out already praise amen but I feel the Holy Spirit moving amen hallelujah glory be to God but now listen the vine continues to live amen see even if without the branch and the branch should fall off that branch dries up this is why I say never leave the Word of God never leave the original message that was brought to us as from Malachi for never leave that praise God because it's keeping you alive who would have thought who would have thought 2016 when the world is going crazy you know that world is going crazy everybody everybody's shooting everybody out back in the States I'm not even gonna get into that this world is insane but who kept you [Applause] hasn't been my strength I tell you that aiming the lordís chasing me sore but he's not giving me over to death praise God that's why I love him that's why I praise Him that's why I glorify Him go ahead we have to be dependent on the Holy Spirit not act like we call equal with him hey man we have to be dependent on the Holy Spirit no repeats our God and the Acts of the early church was because Jesus this energy was in the Holy Spirit was in them okay [Music] you have to abide in him and he and you the branch comes forth to bring forth fruit leaves fruits listen I've seen too many branches without fruit even without leaves you know the LEAs brother Graham says Pentecostal clapping their hands but you see I want to let you know that the leaves are still part of the tree when he restores something he doesn't just restored up to the fruit and get rid of everything below because now we're a fruit time that's how did you hear a lot of doctrines like that oh we have the fruit we don't need to leave and they sit there dead as dead can be hey but let me tell you have you seen a tree aim it has a little fruit on the top and you can't even sit under it and get some shade the leaves is still part of the tree glory be to God hallelujah man glory be to God it had leaves and had the fruit praise God and it had most of all the life now listen Amen the original life Amen that was in the vine hallelujah manifested the fruit of identification I'm talking about original branch you want to know what a tree is the Bible says by their fruits you shall know so the fruit identifies the tree and the branch cannot do anything without the vine so there must be some supernatural power pushing out pushing out pushing through the branch pushing through the branch the next thing you know here's a little leaf come out amen thank God for the leaves you may not have the fruit yet but thank God for the leaf keep pushing out and there's another leaf comes out don't worry but God ain't meant control keep on pushing and keep on pushing until the fruit is made manifest and that will identify what that tree is Luise jesus said the fruit we shall know that see the fruit identifies a life in the brain in other words he loves fruits when we bear much fruit he's glorified the fruit is not glorify when we bear much fruit then he is glorified hallelujah because that's what he put the tree therefore to bear fruit that he may be gore hot this is why I said praise God let's sing that song is a life behind name Amen is time that we focused back in that life hey man hallelujah that life that come that is actually in the vine and ye are the branches amen deceit see because of bride see this is bride time and the shuck is dead and the virgin word this is work version war time see back to the Bible back to the original now you can be seated because I want to read this quote that would probably help you because I am NOT just speaking from my mind here I just want you to understand where I'm getting this from Amen that way you understand now the vine doesn't bear fruit does it he's asking a question what was he talking to the church I am the vine and ye are the branches the branches is energized by the life of the vine hmm hallelujah I'm getting somewhere here now therefore Jesus had no lips it's a night on earth but mine and yours so you see he needs a body he needs a man he has no hands but mine and yours and he energizes us and we bring forth his life as he brings it through us whether in preaching the gospel by lips or seen visions by I see whether it whatever it is laying hands on the sick remember there's an energy behind that hallelujah whatever it is is Christ working through the branch of his church every office listen every office literally electrified by his presence he said isn't it wonderful here we are now it's either told I either told the truth or a lie if I told the lie God will never have anything to do with a lie see you know that see if I've told the truth then God is obligated to vindicate that truth so therefore we are speaking about see Christ was working through the branch of his church he has a church in every office and every in every church there are offices and he put some apostles some teachers some evangelists some prophets etc etc you know that there has absolutely nothing to do with man that's that's the work of God common work of God and we are striving to the position we please push hoping and you know we're in birth pains as it were but you see this branch that I'm talking about and this vine the vine literally electrifies the branch now if you notice the branch is energized by the life that's in the mine the branch has no power in itself remember without the vine you are nothing so if a miracle takes place it wasn't a branch it was a life that come through the vine and into the branch that's the energy Amen that got places in his church and in every office I'm talking about the dynamics Amen that hallelujah that knows how to turn the word on for too long the word has been off you know Amen sure God sent a prophet amen and he did God use them to the mighty works like he's we have never seen and the previous generations nor this generation but isn't it amazing that you go on YouTube and you find old timers old timers I don't want to listen to some of these young guys that going around putting their their their testimonies about what brother Brown all the errors are you kidding me there's no errors in brother Browns message that mean don't tell me there's an era tell me you misunderstood or you don't have any understanding there is no era in this message this message is vindicated hallelujah this message comes from God and goes back to God again praise God hallelujah brother Branham said you may silenced his body but you never silenced dis poise Amen hallelujah what is that boys that voice is the Holy Spirit it's on the earth now calling the people back to the Word of God no repeats our God hallelujah oh I feel like preaching now come on now hey hey hey hey don't worry to God listen I want to tell you something we should all learn the message because brother Brown was said in the church ages amen some of these ages lasted for hundreds of years and the messenger was long gone but they were still under the anointing of their messenger hallelujah which means us nobody they can follow there's nobody that can make it more clear Holloway and this Malachi 4 was to do two things this Malachi 4 was to do two things amen reveal the seven thunders amen and restore the faith back to the apostolic public to think but it'll be these divinely revealed truths that will literally I was telling a brother some time ago I said you know what you preach just prophet we preach vindicated prophet cause a prophet was vindicated by the revelation of the seven seals that may him Saint Luke 17 30 holla that made him our revelations ten seven hallelujah in the days of the voice the mystery of God should be finished finish why don't people understand what finish means should I should I define it or something finito finished glory be to God they call me a while man but listen I'm a zealous for this word amen has never misguided me it has kept me [Applause] man why a man the branch praise God now listen the branch is the body the church where the bread have said amen so in this body the Holy Ghost uses our lips or hands and so forth you see and Christ is working through every branch and every office literally electrified by the presence of God every office that's passed through evangelists every office apostle teacher could you imagine you walk into an office this label apostle this label evangelist you walk in open the door that's your office just making a natural illustration here you turn on the light the light don't turn on and you still go in there sit and work in the dark you try the outlets it doesn't work but you assist in saying in this office because you think this office is yours but when God has put in the church Apostles teachers evangelist whatever I'm gonna tell you something there between over there walking that office flip that switch there is a man that can turn on the light every office will be electrified with the power of God vindicated praise God as I have often said it takes a whole lot more than going out to the print shop and print in your business car to say you are an apostle you are a teacher and so forth both the the print shop can say it but God has got to say there is my spirit flowing freely there's another one over there I have tried him I have proven him amen he has gone through great trials but there he is there's a son like me he has the right attitude he has a right behavior no repeats a God and we are not there yet but we're striving striving to be positionally please glory be to God striving to be pulls Ashley plays take my head so you see when you can be seated if you can't have momentum amen listen there cannot be listen there cannot be Amen an apostle and a teacher whatever God has to vindicate that himself no man can do that but God himself [Applause] and just to show you that it has nothing to do with men Peter had a great idea the fall of Judas well we need to replace the office mm-hmm and they selected a good man you see Matthias good man I'm nothing wrong with you no fine brother he was a fine brother fine brother and so you know they thought they had it all set oh we finally got 12 all the sudden news come done newsflash you know Saul was arrested Saul of Tarsus are you kidding me he had papers to her arrest the early church he went out to get authorization from his denomination to kill out everything that was interrupting the comforts of that day and what happened is while he went with these papers God looked at these papers and last because God had another paper oh there's a warrant for your arrest hallelujah no repeats on Collins we got there's a no is a warrant for your arrest and he did not know anything about it hey man and he was riding his horse riding his horse riding it alone and boom wow what did he run into he ran into the pillar of fire he ran into the power that's in divine Oh hallelujah glory be to God amen [Applause] man chose Mathias but God told Paul go read hallelujah Rover be to God hey man hallelujah and the hardest thing was for to get convinced Ananias and a nice I have a man I want you to pray for yes Lord who is he saw who saw you mean the murderer you mean the one net has come to arrest me and put everybody in jail same one not another one hallelujah listen he may not have been qualified like brother Remus but he was shoulder that is why Paul the Apostle said pour the prisoner of Jesus Christ not by the will of man but the will of God hallelujah don't worry be to God if God adopts you if God places you don't expect man to be on your side but as long as he's on your side Jesus of Nazareth approved of God hey I'm gonna be approved of God no repeat Oh God hallelujah hey oh it's a long time since I've a man was able to shop horrify God it's a long time but I know where I'm spending I know we are going this is a manifestation other sons of God nobody beats our God amen brother Lori be to God we've got to get to that place we've got to get to that place a man don't litter then we'll shake you from it don't let our demons shake you from it have your eyes on the prize amen glory be to God [Applause] the responsibility the responsibility now is on the bride day without us can not be made perfect we have got the comfortable section that it would be nice to come to perfection we got to come to perfection [Applause] Hey Oh No go read hallelujah hallelujah hey man said that to tell you this I don't care what you've done I don't care how much you feel you're unqualified ain't listen amen we have a plan and God has a plan and his plan is very different than our plan hallelujah as long as there's breath in your body there is God hallelujah who can implement his plan and a babe it's contrary to man's thinking and a nice finally responded he was that what I have chosen him and I will show him what things he was for my namesake hallelujah you know where he sent them he sent them to straight street I like that Street because the first thing you have to when you come to the oil go to straight street get your life straightened out get all the crooked places straight straight straight straight straight straight straight straight and he told Ananias where to find him hallelujah to the lamb and what I like here's the ball here's a bomb here's the bone he said brother saw no more enemies all but brother saw [Applause] he didn't ask anybody else he didn't go to the Amen corporate headquarters he had a revelation that he was a brother in spite of all that he did Hey no way hallelujah the dynamics come to get the ball rolling hey man hallelujah that's the word turned on how does the Dan not the dynamics is the word turned dog watch what happens when the word is turned off [Music] shake you know ho ho then cripples walk in the blind seeing the dead is raised because it's not you it's a life that's in the vine and the word is turned on this morning hallelujah your repeats are comedy man and the dynamics of this church what will it be a read pillar of the same original measure that come down on the day of Pentecost amen the same feeling the stream holy goat Norby took god hallelujah amen oh listen to me hallelujah little baby to God amen God takes his man but never his spirit amen the spirit that was on Paul oh is here today the spirit that was the palm brother branham is here today the spirit that was upon apostles in the form of the Holy Ghost is here today who is that spirit as the angel of God the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah [Applause] [Music] we are [Applause] [Music] hallelujah I'm close with this musicians I ran out of time my watches tell me I ran out of time hey man but I want to tell you something I believe with all my heart hallelujah amen I believe with all my heart oh let me just reduce that to of a perfect man now in building the virtue the building this monument this building this statue see it starts off with the foundation stone faith virtue knowledge temperance patience dollars brotherly kindness now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love and listen and he controls he controls no no bishop in another country not this church he control hallelujah and he is her head he controls and he is the streets of every one of these things he was referred to faith virtue knowledge simple patience you know that's the electrifying power that brings down virtue through your virtues I have to I have to just read one more thing one more thing because I want to show you something hey man just one more thing where the whole bit is that alright just one more thing hey man hallelujah I was telling our church you know when you go to Africa different places you can't preach it out where they'll pull you right back into the pulpit and I'm beginning to feel that way now you know what amen there's though one more thing I wanted to just drop in god bless your rich friend amen you see that is my belief but I have to stay with this word amen this original word which cannot fail you see and all that we have been afraid it from and we appreciate let me just say this we appreciate every man of God everybody that have went before us to us better understand certain things and give credit to where credit is due I would like to I would like to believe in staying on the positive side we are better people today for their works of many of these brothers some will say oh we're worse whatever but we are better people you know we're wiser every trial comes your way teach us a lesson we knows things today that we didn't know years ago and it can only make you stronger it can only make you more mature if you get you only closer to God or mice hallelujah amen but anyway I what I was looking at you just can't find it right now but what I was looking at when brother Branham I often wondered in my heart when brother Branham was giving the testimony of the resurrection of that little fish I want you to catch that now the resurrection of that little fish little fishy I give you your life I always wondered why he tied in the voices to that experience but if you read it and you could study it and you know this story is true he said that the Lord told him that there was going to be a resurrection of some creature see so now just before that happened listen brother Branham said an anointing and energy come down on the lake it was so powerful that those that were with him felt oh it is good to be here is they almost thought that they were being raptured but what did brother Graham said he said I couldn't keep from uttering those voices [Applause] and he said it wasn't me it was the vine using the branches using thus the Church of the Living God that anointing is here now by the grace of Almighty God and that is my testimony amen everywhere I go listen I am not afraid seven thunders give faith seven thunders is Brys revival because brother Branham said that a nice cat cannot skirt around that praise God whatever it is it is gospel truth even don't you may have your opinion about it this and that I don't care is gonna happen because it was spoken amen and is going to be some people say well we have revival all in all they men but I'm not talking about this you wait to them thunders uttered their voices to that point that could take the hurt of the time a man handed there it'll spice and everything else but listen you have got to have the right character before he entrusts you with that sword hey man or else you'll cut the ear off I [Applause] want to let you know there's nothing humanistic about what is about to take place is totally spiritual Peter said I'll die for you oh really hey man I'll go to the death will you I believe he was honest but he lacked the power to do it hallelujah and the only thing he had was a sword and he cut the ear off Peter put your sword away hey man he that uses the sword will die by the sword hey hey man hallelujah and even Jesus hope if my kingdom was of this world my people would fight I want to let you know your kingdom is not of this world so don't get in a fight with people who are trying to get you in a fight love your brother love your sister amen it doesn't mean you agree with them but love them anyhow be a better person I like what the Bible says he I love him because he first that's a big word for me he first today we say oh I love him if we have a whole list of things that we want people to make right God had a whole list on you I love him because he first loved us when what kind of love it wasn't filial it wasn't conditional Amen it was a couple of unconditional and that proves it shows that we are expressing the right character and the right behavior we don't hate anybody we love everybody and everywhere I have gone I have preached I have had to preach what my conviction is but at the end of the day you know what one thing that shook me several months ago and it's a song I was listening to a tape across the banner of time and brother Brown said beyond the curtain of time where the Branham said nothing but perfect love yeah we'll make it there he didn't just make that thing he said listen me thus sayeth the Lord he said because there is nothing but perfect teaching perfect revelation so in spite of whatever it is that we believe whatever we've got to come back to that perfect love and that put a new perspective in my understanding the Bible says love your enemies it didn't say you're not going to have enemies because you have to have enemies to love [Music] not that you make them enemies but I've met some people there predestinated to hate you that's that's just about it they don't like you they're not impressed with you I mean you can do somersaults backflips anything else you can preach the fire of God down by the grace of God they just don't like you that's not you see and that is your trial to love him to love the unlovable when God tell me something when we were in the world and when we were not even in the position even thinking of God his mind was full of us his mind for he was mindful of us his mind was full of us and he loved us in our conditions only God could do that not only only God can do that but he's trying to teach his church to love the same way because here is I'm gonna close now our brother are you gonna you know I'm just I do this all the time I'm sorry somebody in the field was counting how many times I said I'm gonna close out I think it was eight times or so but listen this let me get back to the scripture a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved that you also love one another and by this by this by what by this love that we are Trish by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have love one for another I'm closing with that God bless you let us remember her friends we living in a strange time we're living in a time that you know there's a lot of different opinions and things like that but there is a truth as sure as there is counterfeit assures there's error or whatever some are well we have to remember to pray for one another because if it wasn't for the grace of God we too would be in a situation that we cannot so it just helped me to understand that we must love one another the fighting and all the name-calling in it that's not God let me tell you something that's not God a brother a brother he put me on a group text just before I left New York I didn't ask him to put me in a group text but he did and in what's up some of you know the ministers know what's us what's up app so the next thing I hear is ding ding ding ding ding ding ding answer all right now it's going on here how dare you post that on my page I did not post that on your page I'm gonna call the police okay call the police you have I call my lawyer huh is this a is this where we have come down when the son of man cometh will he find faith on the earth I asked somebody some time ago I said you know when the son of man cometh I'd like to I'd like to hope that he finds anybody at all you see we are doing sometimes the devil's work and when we do the devil's work then the devil don't have to do that part the devil is working sure but let's let's put him back to work Satan there's an opening there's a job opening now you try to divide us now hallelujah father grace of God love will conquer all things because charity never faileth god bless you halleluyah halleluyah what Isaac do you know the song I'm so glad that the Lord look yeah I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out but here's the here's a two-fold a part of that it's good that he brought you out but God doesn't leave you in the air if he brought you out here to put you somewhere amen and we know where we are going amen we are we have been placed by the grace of God into the new land that's the land of promise amen through a birth amen and now we're in a new land for the branch said we fought in the wilderness you see but we were fighting one another but we're going to meet the real enemy over on the other side and we've got to stand together by the grace of God I'm going to tell you something I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out if it had not been for Jesus oh where would I be I'm so glad that the low road [Applause] I've been shouting since the law brought
