this morning bless the scripture will be read and may be magnified and glorified in our midst in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you and welcome we appreciate you coming out this morning may god richly bless you amen and if we were bibles we wanted to sin john we will be in the book of sin john 10. we want to read verse 1 to 5 at first then 14 to 15 and then 23 to 30. praise the lord it's in john 10 1-5 14-15 and 23-30 let's read very very this is jesus speaking verily verily i sent to you he said enter it not by the door into the sheepfold but climb it up in on up some other way the same as the teeth and the rubber so there's a way to enter in anybody come to the window he that enter it in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter opened it and the sheep here at his voice he called it his own sheep by name and leaded him out and when he put it forth his own sheep he go it fought before him and the sheep follow him and they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers verse 14 i am the good shepherd i know my sheep and i'm known of mine as the father knoweth me even so no i the father and i laid on my life for the sheep because of verse 23 and jesus walked in the temple in solomon's porch then came the jews wronged about him and said unto him how long does thou make us to doubt if don't be the christ tell us plainly jesus answered them i told you and you believe not the works that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me but you believe not because you are not of my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life that and they shall never perish neither shall any man plot them out of my hand my father which give them me is greater than all and no man is able to plot them out of my father's hand i and my father are one oh what a scripture reading today oh give the lord some praises oh hallelujah let's bow our heads one more time father we thank you for your blessed word we thank you for the scriptures as a comfort our souls our rescue of our lives this is what we feed on father blessed and interpreted to our hearts in jesus may ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh blessed i could i feel like a room right now he said i know them i call them my name no man able to plug them out of my father's hands they can't plug them out of my thank you god bless you praise the name of the lord praise be to jesus hallelujah give the lord a shout thank you lord amen so the title i have this morning is my sheep know my voice a stranger they will not follow and that that sheep is not talking about tea or sheep all right this is jesus she'd be talking about here he said my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow so when they see people going after strangers you know happening they have to question whether or not they belong to him as a sheep because his sheep know his voice and you know what his voice is right his voice is his word so when you're heartening to the word and listen to the word you show your god's sheep oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you lord jesus my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and the prophet gave her a story one time of those small eastern places the rules is very narrow and he says there are people selling goods at the side of the road and the sheep and the shepherds fought walking and the sheep following him and they said the sheep wouldn't even bother with what they selling inside the road whatever vegetables it doesn't matter don't even watch initial but like that and they're following the shepherd praise god my sheep know my voice and they follow me they're not in the they're not in the thing of following strangers and following strange stuff oh glory to god they're following the word oh blessed be the name of the lord and we find out in the scripture praise god he said now is my soul troubled what shall i say father saving from this hour from this course came i unto this world is jesus and then he said father glorify thy name then there came a voice of heaven saying i have both glorified it and be glorified again and the people that stood by said it thundered oh glory to god it stood it thundered the people heard that thunder but jesus was saying the voice speaking to him oh god god have a voice you know god is that mute god is not dumb god could speak god could speak to you this morning god is not mute god is not dumb god can speak oh glory to god and i believe this is an important message today and in this message praise god we are referencing some wisdom versus faith some of it the prophet was told to stop food and he said you will need this in this hour come in here it's store up food because you're going to need it oh glory to god you will need to know that his sheep hear his voice and why are you saying that brother ovid because no other age no other time have there been so much voices everybody have a voice whether it's a tick-tock voice where is a facebook voice where there's a whatsapp voice everybody have a voice everybody is saying something you i'm bombarded 24 7 my voices but amidst this all my sheep know my voice oh glory to god i miss all the voices that coming forth he said my sheep gonna know my voice and a stranger they will not follow oh glory to god because his voice is the word and the word will bring an influence upon your life or give the lord a shout your care be influenced by unbelievers you can be influenced by net believers oh give the lord a shout you're gonna be influenced by the word of god oh hallelujah glory to god you feel the anointing of that that anointing coming right off the word of god my sheep know my voice oh glory to god and the voice of god is a thunder oh glory to god so when you hear the voice of god you hear in the thunders of god oh glory to god right in the tablets of your heart oh hallelujah praise god praise god we have the blessed assurance that no man could talk you out of god's hands he said pick up your pen and write he said one of the scriptures he said it would

sheep know my voice a voice of course is his word when he is speaking my sheep know my voice my voice has to be proven to them to be true that's why when i read a quote here i i'm not playing with

you know if any donkey could come behind i don't have to be here for nothing to be fulfilled but god have to be here for it to be fulfilled come on now come on no i am not god oh give the lord i shout

stranger you're on your own but jesus said my sheep know my voice just filter out strangers i filled out a long time when god delivered from the catholic church i delivered from all them things from the priests what the priests say what this one say when i found this i found an absolute when i found this i find an anchor when i found this message nothing ain't gonna move from this don't ten thousand five listen we pump gas lamp and cairo we had outside latching on toilet all glory day we had to walk in and everything else and that has stopped nothing oh glory to god we didn't care we had

voice oh glory to god and i'm following i still follow him my sheep know my voice and they follow me oh give the lord follow the word brethren all glory to follow the church follow the word what does the word say [Applause] a stranger they will not follow in other words in other words they will not understand a theological voice that is teaching contrary to the word the sheep don't understand that like if like if we have an upgraded version of what the rams say they're not upgrading software you know have a new version because windows 10 always been losing 11. there's not that enough god have no updated vision his original word is original and the devil have to hear original to twist it let's continue he said the sheep can't understand that no more than the eagle last night could understand the clocking of the hymn they don't understand it because it's an eagle no there's a voice of politics great voice all mixed up in their churches and everything else and this is one time i said i messed you get tapped with that former man in america taking sides by that former man that former guy caught up in politics and plumb of the word the devil control all the kingdoms you think god in charge you know you think god put somebody and put somebody here he allowed them to be there but the devil controlling all kingdoms and governments all not some and he's a righteous man people say long time you don't you don't look in the you they look you don't like you you don't like candle indeed to see what they seem cleverly no you say you're writing a night when you think any day you see somebody lazy lazy lazy every time you see them walking lazy talking lazy and you hire them and when you hire them you say oh god they're lazy you didn't see it you see somebody off any day yeah i think candles them they could be writing tonight you see them off they're nice but they're off they're sincere but they seems to be off we have a right to prove all things you know we have no it have no scripture to say swallow what they've given you hold that here yeah no that's why jesus said my sheep in my voice that's some time ago that's a man whistling colonical sheep and make this cheap noise about the sheep let's go straight so don't bother with him the real shepherd comes when he makes his noise oh let's see make about two and go and follow him my sheep so i strange i could impersonate and do it whistling and doing all these cheap business something like that she paying buddy ain't nothing because i ain't no way talking about a death to hear any other voice all i could hear is what what promise for me when i dreamed last night and i see it so and what come to me you ever hear them people on the internet they'll be talking and i feel god speaking to my spirit you know god they talk to them at all and you know he is like he was telling me got to talk so she was telling me and the way i see it and that god not talking to them all them see the man come back into power i call them is liars and they still have followers you know following people and people say we believe them no they're preaching other scriptures and whatever but they are liars the source spirit is a lie even though they're talking truth sometimes 99 can be true but you see the lie they talk the spirit alive that is the problem there that not not not the correct what you know the spirit life that lie on god and said this will happen and that will happen and that's what happened i didn't happen god don't lie if god said what happened praise god [Applause] if god says something gonna happen nothing could stop it he know the end from the beginning he's not he's not guessing he's not gambling he's not rolling his eyes i hope on the lucky over seven look he's not rolling his eyes when he said dusty of the lord say the lord oh i shall deliver you that's thoughts here the lord they're gonna get a breakthrough that's tossing of the lord you're gonna be healed that's dossier when god speaks that listen every demon in your body of sickness have to tremble when god prophesy over your life of your deliverance of your healing of your restoration glory the god hallelujah glory to god amen the voice of politics is so much stronger on the earth today than the voice of god until people sow their christian book right for a mass of popularity political power if there's so many voices in the earth today that is absolutely a heart thing because it deadens the voice of god it deadens the supernatural there are so many he described intellectual voices great voices of mighty men mighty men he's not weak men are not these are low men and mighty men who are intellectual that in their intellectual conditions they even shake nations bringing great organization together great campaigns florida and a person would be a bit confused it's enough to confuse them i know one minute said every time you post something is something i'll give the vaccine well you know he's an anti-vaccine man and he'll be talking his anti-vaccine like if he had no message to preach all he could talk about what are they doing now what is going to do like if half of them dead who preaching that some of them who peddle it call them conspiracy theories i see the next one that conclude from the same covert they blasted blasting and blasting it one man said god i shall take the vaccine then i'm going people who they listen to nothing wrong a bit confused it's enough to confuse them and how i can see if they remark the beast will add a booster shot so maybe the bastard beasts are working so good need a boost to get the rest of the beast it's so foolish what kind of nonsense is that busy marketing beast are you going for a booster shot because i have to survive this because i have a punch for the enemy and i ain't playing stupid i'm wearing my mask i'm washing my hands i'm doing all the things i have to do don't be a fool joseph can i stand up to the potion let me show you a scripture joseph stupid to show that woman's scripture is not scripted she's interested in she don't want to talk about scripture he ran for his life end up in prison you better run for your life okay the lord i shout glory to god i ain't playing you know sorry it's not one of the preachers who likes it oh i presented this jewish when you finish with that you lose the test you lose the money everything else joseph did the best thing you have to know in life when to stand and you have to know when to run and with this corona virus run don't walk run because they will catch you and when it hit your soul you don't know what it might do you so you better do what you had to do or whatever don't do it do it quickly because omni run or comedy chrono wherever you don't even this is better over walking warning about covered let me say that again good this is about the ovid warning your body covered never say i didn't tell you hallelujah all right so watch he said no this causes the voice of god to be placed way back somewhere the true voice of god and the voice of god they say how will we know it's the voice of god because for today it wasn't a vindicated prophet that's willing brown now today how do we know it's the voice of god because it's the manifestation of the prophet's word this is god's prophet and a true voice of god will only bring back that real living supernatural god with a supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word and we know it's the voice of god because amen the others there's so much other in the realm it's almost dead in that out but it will glisten it will come forward it will do it so regardless of what hypocrites whatever people it have it will still have the voice of god that want to glisten and they're gonna go okay let's settle in and buckle it now just want to get into this here won't keep it too long um there are two sources of two sources sorry wisdom or knowledge and faith there's only two sources or by two sources which we must live did you know that there's only two sources that we can draw our life from and one of them is wisdom the other is faith and if we think that and if we think what wisdom produces and then what fate produces we find out that god was the order of fate to believe for people to believe and to trust his word and satan is the order of wisdom trying to get the people to accept his wisdom and pull him away from defeat that's in god's word now god is the order of fate satan is the order of wisdom now he said to eve that you will be wise knowing good and evil right now you see where that starts with where that wisdom come from no he was clarifying this he went further to say the wisdom that i want to get straightened out on before we start there's the wisdom of god our wisdom of god is to stay with the word so god wisdom is very simple stay with the word and you're wise regardless of what anybody say stay with the world that's god's wisdom but satan in his wisdom tried to twist the word so that's the wisdom i'm speaking of so it's not just wisdom wisdom he's talking about the wisdom that twists the word do you mean satan that order with a pitchfork and a red head and two horns no he's a wood twister that's what he does twist the word no there's a certain amount of faith that goes with satan listen listen there's a certain amount of faith that goes with satan in order to accept satan you've got to believe satan so there's a perverted fate to a perfected thing and anything that would try to twist the word of god and make it something that it doesn't it's the wrong spirit right offering wisdom against god's wisdom so we're going to refer to it as wisdom and not satan's fate so he could have said satan feet and god's feet but he's showing you know is satan's wisdom fighting god's feet now we know this scripture in ephesians 4 and verse 14 after coming to a perfect man that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried a boat with every wind of doctrine by the sleigh of man and conan craftiness whereby the and wait to deceive the amplified say so that we no longer be children tossed like ships to and fro between chance gust of teaching and wavering with every change in wind of doctrine the prey of the cunning and the cleverness of unscrupulous men now they're talking about pastors apostles people behind me pulpit there's not pan lovers and party goers this is the sleigh of men describing in the amplified what that is about the prey the cunning and the cleverness of unscrupulous men gamblers engaged in every shifting form of trickery in inventing errors to mislead right in training that i saw a picture of a guy marching by the anti-vax people going along the port of explain to protesters and protesters and the unexpected where he was getting the vaccine he played smart trippiness as i said he vaccinated no but he might want people and there's some people seem to have a gift have a spirit to project error somebody sent some clip of some man in some gas station a woman telling them why you take off your mask and leave your mask home and and stop your mask and whatnot and different things and you do like he caught it differently i say but i really have a genuine thing do you want to run fishing lights and the woman say trying to kill him no you're begged to wonder why would somebody get a spirit why would somebody be crafty clever trying to twist the word to suit their gender inventing errors to mislead all right so look at second corinthians four therefore seeing we have this ministry paul speaking we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness so paul is actually going the opposite to show you what is being presented to the ministry that was allocated to him not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully that means the word of god could be handled deceitfully and he is saying we're not doing that not handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god let's hear what amplifies about that therefore since we do not hold and engage in this ministry by the mercies of god we do all and engage in this ministry by the mercy of god granting us favor benefits opportunities and especially salvation we do not get discouraged spiritless or disbonded with fear or become faint with weariness and exotic exhaustion we have renounced disgraceful disgraceful ways secret thoughts feelings desires unhandedness the methods and arts that men hide through shame we refuse to deal craftily to practice trickery and cunning or to adulterate or handle dishonestly the word of god but we state the truth openly clearly candidly and so we commend ourselves in the sight and presence of god to every man's conscience or give the lord some praises hallelujah let's drill along a little deeper here what is this wisdom the prophet was talking about here now he said now what is the wisdom we're talking about something that will not agree that all this word is the truth it is something that will take away from the truth are you ready expressing itself as a higher knowledge and more wisdom that is what they try to present the faithful ministry will bring up the hidden mysteries that was hid from before the foundation of the world that's a quote that's that's somebody will say that that's based upon what brahman says bringing up the mysteries of god and explain to the church think about that quote a minute as if men have some mysteries god didn't have already revealed how on earth could any man bring a mystery that has not been revealed when god and a prophet to reveal every mystery so this mystery that was hid before the foundation of the world has to be already been revealed so when men come to try to present they have something in their back pocket that nobody else have is the black bag you know sometime when i listen to these preachers i see they started the word of god and started preaching they were all even glory hallelujah waiting for the black back to come i always said in the middle instrument they bring on the black bag like nothing but you know that's their own bag but they get the people saying amen first amen first i want a black back come the people can using amen don't do that you know because my sheep know my voice when you hear the black back come out they say you can't digest that because there's another word i heard a preacher say he had a pinfall in the church nobody's saying amen but when i listen he's not preaching any word he preached his thoughts and he said if a pin fall you could hear it why wouldn't say amen i said but this man believed brother brown you mean ghosts and a whole prophet my mother picked a whole man i have one thing from this message and you want to say he meant to that listen this is a powerful thing you know if you know how much you put inside of you if you know listen if you know how much the word inside of you even if you read it literally we because the word have been so pumping you have more the secret is the word is in the bride [Applause] that remind me some bum somebody backs in the airs and on the streets or something so i said wait a minute i'm first he said i might be backstage and drunk buy a stupid godsend a prophet you can't take that out when you know about revelation god's a nine-time messenger you might be dead drunk as ever you might be struggling and whatnot but you know the truth you know god had promised all these churches in the last days god promised sons of god children who had to be turned back to the faith of the fathers in the last days listen you are eager you might be wounded but you're still an eagle you might be tired but you must be eager you might lost wing lost feathers but you're still are you gonna give the lord eagles give the lord a shout inside of here glory i prefer to be a vaccine eating than to be executive chicken or can might fight that one will give the lord a shout glory to god i make my people to be a wounded eagle than to be a glorified chicken with all the perks and all the hair and all kind of things like that oh gloria come on you eagles my god this word is for you my sheep hear my voice listen to the word of god hear the word of the lord oh glory to god hallelujah let's let's say it again it is something that will take away from the truth expressing itself as a higher knowledge more wisdom nobody never said nobody ever revealed that and you heard about you hear that people come people comedy selfish days they can't wait to tell somebody that no they can't forgive the neighbor they help nobody here but oh you hear that the head stimulated what they have behind the property is a superman s on his chest because he's bringing up mysteries that they never hear so before no they can't find the prophet preaching them things and you ask yourself why i could preach about nimrod go and discover nimrod and the number was just a numerator the mystery of nimrod history of nimrod naman lineage and whatnot all that is bible and thing too but we is he promising that now you are named family would he promise to that that's information that's not revelation so don't get tired of information and revelation is not the same thing revelation brings faith revelation is revealing power revelation is when you hear from heaven revelation is not what you're hearing you have in your head revelation is when god spirit bring the word and reveal it to you [Music] [Applause] glory sometimes god gave me revelation they can't explain anything but you know something dropped inside your heart and no devil could take it out he said upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of healthcare prevail against it why i think we stand in the way we standing because we have a rock revelation oh glory to god the devil could never take me out do you take not a long time it's too late now okay the lord some praises we're standing on a rock [Applause] and if wisdom of that sort come from satan his children live by that wisdom oh they do yes and if faith of god comes from god and god's word god's children lives on faith the bible said that just shall live by wisdom no faith the joshua by faith not what we can learn but what we can believe oh let me say it again not what we can learn but what we can believe that is what you're living by not how much mysteries do you miss it do you know the mystery trumpets over the vials what about the wolves why would a woman in the sun how much mystery mode tick tick tick because knowledge shall increase and faith shall go so low down that jesus asked the question when is son of man coming will there any be faith left will i find faith in the earth so much of knowledge so much a box and yet the question was asked when the son of man cometh shall he find fate on the earth oh glory to god faith on the earth there was famine and god tell the prophet elijah i have commanded a woman to feed thee dear god and tell the woman a word but god tell elijah that woman under a command to feed you and god has said a word to that woman but locked up in that predestinated seed had a fate and when she went to break one last break one last bread one last meal and a man of god came up to us and bit me a kid first as she turned to do it she yet dost hear the lord oh give the lord a shout that is when faith is working [Applause] and the bible went on to save so beautifully there were many widows but the one was elijah's scent oh god this should make you shout there are many peoples there are many churches there are many sisters and brothers but god sent a word to you today oh glory to god my sheep hear my voice a stranger [Applause] they will not follow hallelujah oh glory my god i feel like rumbling in the camp oh glory to god i feel that rumbling in the camp oh glory to god we rolling into 2022 with faith not with wisdom not with knowledge with fate we're living in times of uncertainty but be certain of god oh give the lord a shout times may be uncertain but we are not uncertain on god oh we are certain this will surely come to pass oh hallelujah wisdom has reasoning faith has no reasoning but wisdom has reasoning now what we are doing trying to do this morning follow what the lord said lay up food you're going to need it one of these days so god told the prophet to preach this lay up food because we will need it and i feel we need it now because some of you had to stop listen to what's up stop your facebook stop all your voices again that contrary to this because something could be so stimulating that is stability on you not that's what we're preaching here you know what you want to listen to what you want to hear cut it out cut it out either listen to that i'm foolishness you know no i listen to the word of god i have no time with them nothing i don't listen to people send me forward this and that i didn't read it sometimes i have no time for that you really attempt to check and check answers you releasing our time for that the serpent was more subtle than all the beasts of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman ye as god said believe in saying the word you shall not eat of every tree of the garden so the woman the devil bowler boiled her god said you shall not eat every tree she corrected him roman says we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garment god had said he shall not eat of it no neither shall he touch it does he die so he didn't know the full story so he put something out and he catched and started wheeling the fish now because he gets full state now so when he hear him you shall naturally die aha this is your channel watch but i'll say faith holds to that the serpent says you shall not surely die a reason god is too good i'm still reading god is too merciful he loves you too much you hear that same old devil today god is too good to do this god won't do this god won't punish he will do just exactly what his word said he will do he said you shall not surely die see what he's trying to do getting her to reason with him in a minute that you reason on god's word you're losing faith so once you start to reason start to figure it out and console yourself because you know i think someone says control yourself because you don't want to do what god said that's the problem you know people hearing hearing hearing but you don't want to do what god said now i recognize there are lots of unbelievers in this message you know when bahrain preached when i first read that message i couldn't understand the unbelieving part i could i could you cannot believe it i just see it make believe in part and they believe apart basically unbelievable i couldn't catch that one no we're catching it there are people who in this message seen coming to church and they are unbelievers they don't really believe they believe the dream they believe their thoughts their ideas they believe what they want to believe when coming to this a problem but my sheep not to you over cheap all i have is a wife that i still my wife that's what i have right now only stands out my sheep jesus said that knows my voice his voice is the word oh hallelujah all right now watch so watch don't have no yes knows maybe so stay right with it eve had the right approach but she listened to his reasoning there are so many people today that has the right knowledge that knows that this word should be god's word and it's god's word but they stand and let some seminary student reason them out of it a way watch from the holy spirit away from the things of god reasoning we have to cast them down so once they find yourself get caught up in reason there's a problem there you have to really walk in faith so the serpent said in the woman you shall not surely die for god know it i can imagine what he said for god knoweth that in the day you eat thereof your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil some real good boy oh god i want to know i want to be like god knowing good and evil he has given her a reason you will be like and be equal with god in other words you want to really be right with god take my advice listen to me god don't mean that he didn't when you hear that get away from it the piss of a serpent it sounds reasonable but don't reason just believe it god said so and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eye a tree to be desired to make one have knowledge and to make one wise you see what it was satan presented knowledge knowledge that was contrary to the word how to make one wise she took of the fruit did eat give with her husband with her he did eat the eyes were open and they knew they were naked and they sold fake leaves what started it off reasoning see faith has no reason you believe when you're prayed for you accept god's word for healing do reason with your feelings don't reason with nothing else there is no reasoning to it god said so that's a flip you must believe don't reason believe don't try to have wisdom just believe the word wait for a moment we'll go back to the seed again what was it the devil tried to do with wisdom make god's word say something it didn't say that's what wisdom does push something on people that god did not say oh give the lord a shout in the house glory to god hallelujah you said well i tell you brother branham you ain't have the right interpretation the bible said prophecy is of no private interpretation oh glory to god so who else is the prophet outside of our prophet oh give the lord i shout now god sent one messenger to interpret the word so all we have to do is to go back to the source glory to god hallelujah hallelujah praise god go back to the source and the source is the days of the voice revelation 10 7 of the seventh angel when he shall begin to slung the mystery of god shall be finished glory to god what the prophet said the bride will say oh glory to god you believe that he said watch he said why is it no private interpretation the word of the lord comes to the prophet it's interpreted by the prophet the prophets already interpreted to you could we continue all right all right in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god see the word is in god it was god it was his torch that was with him see god taught is as eternal as god is that in skin milk brother see god taught was his word in the beginning and watch in the beginning was the word god taught and the word was with god and the word was god his thoughts is what he was that's you too what your thoughts are is what you are that's a big one you know let me read that again what your thoughts are is what you are no matter how you try to live by something else your torch is what you are you might go along act like a nice fellow but in your heart you are an adulteress or whatever it is that's what you are your torch and god taught was his word and that was him with him and him isn't that right god taught was expressing the human body and let's go back to genesis he said when the serpent said you shall not surely die now when what it presents what is it trying to make the word say something it doesn't say as satan was presented to her you shall not surely die it's trying to make the word say something so it's a twisting of scripture oh hallelujah what does fear do believe it just the way it is and all you say is god said so god said so you said to speak the word god said so i will never leave you i'll never seek you i'll be rich even in you to the end of god said so oh glory to god what is his voice his voice is his word isn't that right praise god hallelujah thank you lord jesus he said in the last days talking about the thunders that daniel heard in the last days these seven voices would be known by the real true church oh glory of course by them thunderstorm voices out those voices the true church will know what those voices are let's continue now watch there are atmospheres from these two sources knowledge and faith both release our atmosphere so there are some people that where they could sit down for six hours because there is the atmosphere of knowledge and information and you know there are some people i know somebody who always wanted to study but guess what they're talking work so instead of going on going on to get a job they only go in degree after degree after degree after degree after degree and you know what they're not even finishing a degree so by time they definitely want to jump on the next one jump on the next one no this is real this isn't that i'm not making fun you know or because they don't want to go to it's easier to do studies and there's some people just like that in church they're easy to get knowledge they don't want to go and get applied to apply the knowledge that they hear into their lives that's what he's supposed to be working on working on you not working on the world working on you creating the atmosphere for the world to be effective to you because all them heard moses and it was not effective to them oh glory to god only just one caleb the world had effect on oh glory to god so i could appreciate all the gray i have turned greater and fall off except you apply it except it become effective to you you're wasting your time is that honest i mean with you you're wasting your time yeah come here to waste your time you come here to get the word for your soul oh glory to god you're coming here the voice of god in the last days we had to

wife which you can't take your husband you every man have to have their own revelation oh glory to god every man had to pay the price now the time to get set along and pay your price allows them to

of atmosphere of wisdom [Applause] therefore you should fight for the praises inside of here fight for the worship inside of here come in the spirit before the song leader come here it should be a rumbling in the camp an atmosphere of praise and worship by the time the first piano note hit the first order note hit the first kiss i hit there's the atmosphere inside of here by the time the song didn't finish the minutes are shaking because you're coming under the anointing by the time you come behind here the glory of god filled the tabernacle the minister can't even stand to minister

gay david give up when he when he handled a beer so god i'd be a tribal god i killed him by dawn i don't know i don't know i used to die yes i didn't expect this beard thing now i didn't see anybody's sheep are you the idea i'm insane for no beer business this be a child coming god no goliath coming down the road david casey goliath god's single light he needs the beer experience he needs the lion experience because goliath is coming why you think i'm preaching this this morning goliath is on his way okay the lord i shout my sheep hear my voice [Applause] [Music] [Applause] don't ever forget this message because the voice of god is the word almost done watch this the seed word of life can't grow in that kind of atmosphere wisdom it just can't do it one day it's come to a showdown wisdom and faith come to our shoulder jesus and satan jesus satan met these two great forces wisdom and knowledge come to the showdown now both of them use the word so he's bringing it down now i'm just zooming on both of them use the word conversion say amen and says don't miss it now okay say god open my heart and the congregation said god opened my heart that's how brother panama didn't want to miss it watch both of them use the word of god the same bible it won't work in an unconverted channel this is children don't know this is going down deep he's showing you bought using the word bought using the bible bought using coach bought using a message but it won't work in an unconverted channel it sure won't it certainly won't both of them use the word of god but satan used it from a head knowledge and it didn't work you have a scripture here and he read from hebrews let us therefore fear a promise being left us to enter into his rest as you should have seen come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well unto them but the word preached did not profit them doesn't mean that being mixed with knowledge wisdom no faith in them but he's saying all that is not me he's saying that he's showing is not being mixed up with knowledge and wisdom not being mixed with faith in them that heard it he said you can have all the word you can know that word from a to z it will never work for you have you ever seen men take that word and try to make it work say brother glory to god it just won't work you can't fool with the word no no no no no no matter what you profess the word testify of itself give the lord a shout the word testifies of itself no matter what you claim the word gives the testimony jesus didn't say i am the son no a voice came over him said this is my
