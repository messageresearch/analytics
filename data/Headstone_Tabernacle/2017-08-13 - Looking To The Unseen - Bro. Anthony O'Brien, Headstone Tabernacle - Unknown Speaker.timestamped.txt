[49:13] Testament and in the New Testament want
[49:16] to read Romans II and we also want to
[49:18] read a Hebrews 11 so so we read first
[49:24] from Habakkuk which is almost latter
[49:29] part of the Old Testament and have a cup
[49:37] to a man reading from verse 1 how about
[49:47] to induce one says I will stand upon my
[49:51] watch and set me upon the tower and will
[49:54] watch to see what he will say unto me on
[49:58] what I shall answer when I am approved

[50:37] we go through the series a in Lord
[50:40] please to do that but but I just want to
[50:44] read a food for who says Amen so Romans
[50:48] 8 verse 1 says they therefore now no
[50:51] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[50:54] Jesus walk not after the flesh but after
[50:59] the spirit for the law of the spirit of
[51:02] life in Christ Jesus has made me free
[51:05] from the law of sin and death for what
[51:08] the law could not do in that it was weak
[51:11] through the flesh God sending his own
[51:13] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[51:15] for sin condemned sin in the flesh now
[51:19] the righteousness of the law might be
[51:21] fulfilled in us
[51:23] who walk not after the flesh but after
[51:24] the spirit
[51:26] now Hebrews 11 and we'll just read from
[51:37] from verse one now Hebrews 11 amen and
[51:44] it says now faith is the substance of
[51:46] things hoped for the evidence of things
[51:49] not seen for by it the elders obtained a
[51:53] good report through faith we understand
[51:56] that the worlds were framed by the Word
[51:59] of God so that things which are seen
[52:01] were not made of things which do appear
[52:05] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[52:08] excellent sacrifice than King by which
[52:11] he obtained witness that he was
[52:12] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[52:14] and by it he being dead yet speaketh now
[52:20] let me skip down to this 13 here no I
[52:24] want to pick up something in this
[52:27] chapter verse 13 says these all died in
[52:30] faith not having received the promises
[52:33] but having seen them afar off and were
[52:37] persuaded of them and embraced them and
[52:41] confessed that they were strangers and
[52:43] pilgrims on the earth Hebrews 11 14 says
[52:47] for they that say such things declare
[52:50] plainly that they seek a country and
[52:53] truly if they have been mindful of that
[52:55] country from when they came out they
[52:58] might have opportunity to have returned
[53:01] say for instance like Egypt and the
[53:04] Israelites come out and they wanted to
[53:06] go back every time something happened
[53:07] because they were mindful of that
[53:09] country see but he said but now they
[53:12] desire a better country that is and
[53:15] heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to
[53:19] be called their God for he had prepared

[1:00:20] dimension where God is the seventy
[1:00:23] mention coming to the fourth dimension
[1:00:26] influencing the third oh we going to

[1:01:10] and so on and all these things happening
[1:01:12] right among us but we can't see it so

[1:01:55] a voice because he was taking place in
[1:01:59] those dimension whoa I'll only write

[1:17:44] have what's called human science is
[1:17:45] man's science and so on
[1:17:47] the observance on the study of nature
[1:17:49] and how it affects us and the
[1:17:52] environment that's what science is just
[1:17:54] a study of how things systematically
[1:17:56] progress in nature and so and you know
[1:17:59] God made all of it so God is reflected
[1:18:02] in nature isn't that right what a brand
[1:18:05] said if you look close enough you'll see
[1:18:07] God on the flowers you see going in the

[1:18:40] as a captive sly and clever just as a
[1:18:43] dog it's playful and fun to be around

[1:23:46] sonship many my oh my oh please gone we
[1:23:56] man oh wow
[1:23:58] alright so amen so I started thinking
[1:24:03] about this dimension that we in and yet
[1:24:07] certain laws that govern this dimension
[1:24:09] isn't that right and in all dimensions
[1:24:12] there's something called the law of
[1:24:14] gravity basically it says what goes up
[1:24:17] has got to come back down the earth it
[1:24:20] tells the atmosphere the earth pulls
[1:24:21] objects towards it so once you're within
[1:24:24] the gravitational field
[1:24:25] halleluyah off you're an object up there
[1:24:28] it's got to come now and knock but Jesus
[1:24:31] already decide those laws when you stood
[1:24:34] up on the mountain and he was talking to
[1:24:36] them he said go into all the world and
[1:24:38] preach the gospel all of a sudden begin
[1:24:41] to raise up out of their sight the Bible
[1:24:44] said a cloud received him hallelujah
[1:24:47] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:24:51] he said but tarry in Jerusalem I'm
[1:24:54] coming back down at the appointed time
[1:24:57] I'm gonna come back and visit you Oh
[1:24:59] hallelujah Allah with the Holy Spirit
[1:25:01] with the Holy Ghost in other words I
[1:25:04] come back when I want gravity can't hold
[1:25:06] me no more in the spirit world it's zero
[1:25:09] gravity
[1:25:10] there's no spin hole in you there's no
[1:25:13] fill tool in you there's no unbelief
[1:25:15] hole in you there's nothing to pull you
[1:25:18] down it's only th pushing you up on up
[1:25:22] into the heavenlies up into the Rainbows
[1:25:25] up into the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:25:28] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now
[1:25:35] when you lift your hands in the
[1:25:37] sanctuary when you lift your hands in
[1:25:39] the service what are you doing defying
[1:25:42] gravity other sign I know who I am I
[1:25:45] know who my father is all earlier this
[1:25:48] work and hold me one of these days I'll
[1:25:51] soon be gone it won't be long friends
[1:25:54] it's gonna be soon friends Oh hallelujah
[1:25:58] praise coffee like dancing
[1:26:03] [Applause]
[1:26:08] in our dimension there's something
[1:26:11] called buoyancy I didn't research if you
[1:26:15] throw an object into the water or if
[1:26:17] you're underwater there's part of it
[1:26:19] that's supposed to sink in there is
[1:26:20] another part that's teased up and
[1:26:23] depending on the mass or the density of
[1:26:24] the object it could either sink or it
[1:26:27] could show that a certain portion but
[1:26:29] Jesus already defied that law because
[1:26:31] one needs disciples were in a boat and
[1:26:34] they were in a song and they were all
[1:26:36] worried but all of a sudden they look
[1:26:37] and it saw something coming up on the
[1:26:39] water at first he thought it was a
[1:26:41] course but upon further scrutiny he
[1:26:45] thought it was Jesus walking on top of
[1:26:48] the water that has nothing to do with
[1:26:51] natural laws he wasn't a natural praise
[1:26:54] God he was from the supernatural
[1:26:57] hallelujah those laws on a subject to
[1:26:59] him that's how a son of God operates Oh
[1:27:02] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise
[1:27:05] God hallelujah hallelujah nothing to do
[1:27:12] with natural laws so spiritual or image
[1:27:14] Galilean motion
[1:27:16] oh my hallelujah is nigh hallelujah
[1:27:20] there's natural laws but it's also
[1:27:22] spiritual laws and there was a law of
[1:27:25] sin and death this one time that Paul
[1:27:27] talked about and when you were born this
[1:27:29] law of sin and death was within your
[1:27:31] members hallelujah it was of taking away
[1:27:34] the roots of your heart how are you
[1:27:36] driving in to do sin Paul said when I
[1:27:39] would do good evil is present with me so
[1:27:42] there's another spirit playing in my
[1:27:44] members is he talked about it is not
[1:27:46] right praise for when I could do good
[1:27:48] evil is present with me when I try to
[1:27:51] pray the devil try to hold me down when
[1:27:54] I try to break through the devil try to
[1:27:56] hold me down when I try to have page the
[1:27:58] devil said you did this tree to detach
[1:28:00] you you did whatever the law of sin and
[1:28:03] death
[1:28:03] willing you aware from what you want
[1:28:06] from what you need but Paul says there
[1:28:10] is therefore now no
[1:28:12] condemnation to them who are in Christ
[1:28:14] Jesus for the law live the life in
[1:28:18] Christ Jesus is what sets you free from
[1:28:22] the law of sin and death
[1:28:24] praise God
[1:28:28] it's a greater law it's a greater power
[1:28:31] that's going to come into you and burn
[1:28:34] all the root of evil
[1:28:35] another slick in your heart you are
[1:28:38] going to be walk like a Christian talk
[1:28:40] like a Christian act like a Christian
[1:28:43] praise God hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:28:55] a promise to you receive it o Holy Ghost
[1:28:57] you are going to receive something or
[1:29:01] out of the world doesn't know about it
[1:29:02] Oh hallelujah hallelujah we try within
[1:29:05] ourselves Oh hallelujah but there's

[1:34:20] what we could see and its profit
[1:34:22] identifier that went in came in we drop
[1:34:25] down into a hickey it's never got going
[1:34:29] is a loop that loop was time it's nine
[1:34:32] I'm not hickey represent times all right
[1:34:35] are we dropped on from eternity at the
[1:34:37] time and we bypass Oki often is not we
[1:34:40] didn't know who he was we come into a
[1:34:42] state of ignorance as it was it's not
[1:34:44] right we didn't know who our Father was
[1:34:46] didn't know who I'm we're called to do
[1:34:48] who our family was what all rights was
[1:34:51] it's not who we are connected to praise
[1:34:53] or who our family was we had no idea
[1:34:56] so it took the voice of God to call us
[1:34:59] in every age to call every seed to call
[1:35:02] every son's on the call every thought in
[1:35:04] every age Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:35:08] praise God thank you Jesus oh I shudder
[1:35:11] to think that in every age even in a
[1:35:14] horse and buggy age or people drink tea
[1:35:17] and people had they had all these ping
[1:35:19] England in different places in John
[1:35:20] Wesley and all the revivals that took
[1:35:22] place all back in their day they had no
[1:35:25] TV they had no internet they had no cell
[1:35:28] phones
[1:35:28] Ohan earlier nothing like that it was a
[1:35:30] completely different lifestyle yet in
[1:35:33] that age and yet end up disposition the
[1:35:36] voice of God found a way to contact John
[1:35:39] Wesley the voice of God on the way to
[1:35:43] contact Martin Luther holler because I
[1:35:45] was his time that was his Jesus
[1:35:48] I was his days for God to be manifested
[1:35:51] in their day and I think about our days
[1:35:54] and sometimes we complain but I know you
[1:35:56] say it's so hard sometimes to find the
[1:35:59] time to be with God sometimes you find
[1:36:01] it so hard to pull a 5-time from the
[1:36:04] work schedules and from the work routine
[1:36:06] and from all the hustle and the bustle
[1:36:08] of life and I shudder to think that even
[1:36:11] still know things have change and though
[1:36:14] the lifestyles of people have changed a
[1:36:16] long time ago people had one job no
[1:36:19] people have three trying to pay the
[1:36:21] bills trying to make ends meet
[1:36:23] single-parent homes they have different
[1:36:25] challenges
[1:36:27] even in the midst of those challenges
[1:36:29] Paul is still gone car is still gone and
[1:36:34] the supernatural is still there and the
[1:36:37] same signs that Jesus is when he was
[1:36:40] here on earth the same signal is here
[1:36:43] the dead I was raised the blind that saw
[1:36:46] the that walk both elements are
[1:36:49] still on the earth right now all it
[1:36:53] takes is a supernatural faith to reach
[1:36:56] up into that place and pull down those
[1:36:59] promises for allergy but it is still
[1:37:02] here divine healing hasn't stopped Oh
[1:37:05] hallelujah hallelujah rapport is Telenet
[1:37:09] he might have taken his prophet but part
[1:37:12] is still here Oh hallelujah Rihanna and

[1:37:43] so right now we will be contending for
[1:37:45] it but we haven't seen that perfect
[1:37:46] church yet we are only pressing for it

[1:37:51] we're doing this morning hallelujah
[1:37:53] hallelujah prepare for the dynamics we
[1:37:55] can look to the rapture yet no we have
[1:37:57] to die out the rapture is coming but in
[1:38:00] order for you to be ready for that
[1:38:01] rapture you have to receive power power

[1:38:29] it's not right it's not right astronauts
[1:38:34] before they could go into space they
[1:38:37] have to go into training first because

[1:38:50] to know how to move how to go how to put
[1:38:53] your hand this way also glide across
[1:38:55] that way well so it is in the
[1:38:58] supernatural but in order for you to

[1:41:38] that means therefore that what events
[1:41:42] are to take place in future and what
[1:41:45] events are past it's already set in gold
[1:41:47] mine is now it supposed to happen a
[1:41:53] certain way it supposed to take place at
[1:41:55] a certain time Gord shooters proffered a
[1:41:58] vision but that vision is now dusty at
[1:42:01] the Lord it cannot change is now it's
[1:42:05] gotta happen exactly though we go smoke
[1:42:07] it Amen hallelujah God's prophet so go
[1:42:10] to prophet when a vision break he say it
[1:42:13] transport him to the event itself into
[1:42:16] the place where is happening and he see
[1:42:18] shadows of people and I think that will
[1:42:21] happen he said sometimes their
[1:42:23] subconscious
[1:42:24] oh he he explains it here let me see let
[1:42:26] me see let me see if I can read it here
[1:42:27] you actually explained it here and a
[1:42:29] message picked her up is it well yeah
[1:42:32] amen all right is that now what he said
[1:42:34] nah let's let's see settle lines already
[1:42:36] all right he said as the meetings go on
[1:42:39] each night the annoying thing begins to
[1:42:40] get very deep even if you understand he
[1:42:43] said you break into another dimension
[1:42:45] see he said sometimes I don't know how
[1:42:48] loud I'm talking
[1:42:50] just imagine standing here no talking
[1:42:53] and something that happened back yonder
[1:42:55] 40 years ago and in the spirit I'm back
[1:42:59] there with them and where that is
[1:43:03] happening and knowing but I'm knowing
[1:43:05] that I'm talking but I don't know where
[1:43:08] my voice is Wow
[1:43:10] so he can't even hear his own voice he
[1:43:13] is fully in the event of what's taking
[1:43:15] place he's so far away from the present
[1:43:18] that he could do longer his own voice
[1:43:19] speaking but he's conscious there's a
[1:43:23] different consciousness in our eye he
[1:43:25] said I know I'm supposed to be here in
[1:43:27] this tabernacle he said I am here but
[1:43:30] yet I am always on the somewhere he said
[1:43:34] you don't know what a feeling it gives
[1:43:36] he said it's no wonder daniel said he
[1:43:39] was troubled at his head and different
[1:43:41] things that have taken place see he said
[1:43:43] now how many ever dreamed a dream he
[1:43:45] said he said now you couldn't dream a
[1:43:47] dream you know I couldn't tell you
[1:43:49] dreaming a dream he said you couldn't do
[1:43:52] it he said now he said that's your
[1:43:54] subconscious
[1:43:55] he said no one ordinary person dreams
[1:43:57] dreams for his subconscious is probably
[1:44:01] about that far from him I'm trying to
[1:44:03] demonstrate but he said when this
[1:44:05] conscious becomes inactive this one
[1:44:09] takes over this one sets up is that
[1:44:11] right you can't know how many remember
[1:44:12] the things that you dream how many
[1:44:14] remember the things that you dreamed
[1:44:15] years ago what caused you to remember it
[1:44:18] well you are somewhere in some kind of a
[1:44:21] condition wasn't you because you still
[1:44:23] remember it
[1:44:23] when this conscience became active he
[1:44:26] said well now some people doesn't dream
[1:44:28] at all their conscience could be way
[1:44:31] back like that like overturn our wall
[1:44:33] somewhere he said no a person he said
[1:44:36] now you can make yourself what you are
[1:44:38] he said I believe that all gifts and and
[1:44:40] callings are without repentance so he
[1:44:42] said God gives them serenity as he will
[1:44:45] God he said you couldn't come to God
[1:44:47] less God called you it's not so we know
[1:44:51] that it's God who calls you is my right
[1:44:54] God who gives you you take God who put
[1:44:56] you in a church he said it's God who
[1:44:58] does everything not in him rest all in
[1:45:01] all in there
[1:45:03] he said that scriptural as it can be and
[1:45:05] you know that's right if that but now
[1:45:06] look he said a fear his subconscious is
[1:45:11] not back there neither is it here
[1:45:13] he said it's right here he said you
[1:45:16] don't go to sleep use a spring from one
[1:45:18] into the other one into the other and
[1:45:20] then when you just let it alone and then
[1:45:23] it comes at its own leisure he said see
[1:45:25] this is but here here is just raising up
[1:45:28] like her not hold to see something he
[1:45:32] said you're praying he said we wait just
[1:45:34] a minute there's something breaking here
[1:45:35] no he said this is it he said but here
[1:45:37] it's raising up looking through like a
[1:45:40] Knothole to see something you're praying
[1:45:41] you're trying to take a parable which is
[1:45:43] words that God gave me alone to know and
[1:45:46] it just keep repeating then you break
[1:45:48] you see the position as you're
[1:45:50] contacting them you say and then they
[1:45:52] catch their spirit it goes to them then
[1:45:55] you just see something happen
[1:45:57] maybe it'll close off maybe you look
[1:45:59] again maybe you'll see something else
[1:46:01] that'll close on and so on he said but
[1:46:03] when God gives it just as his leisure he
[1:46:05] just looks like he raises you up
[1:46:07] he said he raises you up over the fence
[1:46:10] and lets you see the whole thing said
[1:46:13] that's what it's all about so here's a
[1:46:15] prophet explaining what these visions
[1:46:17] are like and it's really the
[1:46:19] subconscious and the conscience
[1:46:20] he's slipping into those two worlds
[1:46:22] sometimes you'd be praying and by the
[1:46:24] time he gets up he's in a different
[1:46:26] place seeing different pictures
[1:46:28] experiencing different things not aware
[1:46:31] of the present but in somewhere in the
[1:46:33] past or future seeing things that I've
[1:46:35] been looking at things that will be oh
[1:46:38] what a place to be in I was God's
[1:46:42] prophet isn't all right proving that
[1:46:44] that supernatural world was right there
[1:46:46] all of you right there among us he was
[1:46:49] no learning man he was no big education
[1:46:51] but I was a gift of God given to see
[1:46:54] what man couldn't see to go into the
[1:46:57] spiritual realm and to see things that
[1:47:00] are before things that are holily that
[1:47:02] think that was it's not right no for a
[1:47:05] message that I would Lord here there is
[1:47:07] a prophet discerning I wanna read this
[1:47:09] here again our readers here know you
[1:47:11] don't know we are strangers he said I
[1:47:12] believe although your life all through
[1:47:15] your life is ministering to somebody
[1:47:16] you get all through your life you've had
[1:47:19] a hunger haven't you he said ah now here
[1:47:21] in these days that you're coming to now
[1:47:23] he said yes I see something coming
[1:47:25] before me is that oh it's a but you have
[1:47:28] a stomach trouble don't you that is not
[1:47:31] right he said you've never served God
[1:47:33] like you wanted to so he's picking up a
[1:47:35] hunger and a stomach trouble he said
[1:47:37] you've never entered into that place
[1:47:39] that you've hunger and thirst for isn't
[1:47:42] that right you can right he said do you
[1:47:44] want to receive him he said may the Lord
[1:47:46] Jesus heal you and fill you with his
[1:47:48] spirit until your heart is bubbling over
[1:47:50] with His grace in the name of Jesus
[1:47:52] Christ I ask it amen he said now go our
[1:47:55] cistern receiving the name of Jesus
[1:47:56] Christ he's still deserting he says
[1:47:58] let's see he said now he's here let's

[2:08:04] close out this sick sense of fate right
[2:08:06] so we have five senses see taste feel
[2:08:08] smell in here but at six cents is what
[2:08:11] we use to contact go and see come by
[2:08:13] hearing and hearing the Word of God and
[2:08:17] the preaching of the word is what brings
[2:08:19] faith so that's why the devil try to
[2:08:21] keep you out of the atmosphere try to
[2:08:22] keep you out of the Assemblies
[2:08:24] holily for signal your selling of
[2:08:26] ourselves sometimes things get in the
[2:08:28] way
[2:08:29] on a life captain away mistakes on this
[2:08:31] thing hallelujah but it pays the pina
[2:08:34] atmosphere k9 atmosphere until car take
[2:08:38] over I said God do something for you
[2:08:40] only poor to do sunny for you but you
[2:08:43] have to be any atmosphere of it
[2:08:44] Cornelius was praying always giving arms
[2:08:47] just a live out in the atmosphere pray
[2:08:51] instead anointing speaking oh until
[2:08:54] something takes place are there
[2:08:56] something breathe forth in his life
[2:08:58] break forth in the supernatural oh yeah
[2:09:01] that's what we're looking for this
[2:09:02] morning a man say to believe what God
[2:09:07] said will come to pass see faith is the
[2:09:11] only sense that has the ability to reach
[2:09:13] God the contact God the core God on the
[2:09:16] scene is now right as Hebrews 11 it says
[2:09:18] now faith is some of the substance of
[2:09:20] things hoped for the evidence of things
[2:09:22] not seen for by it the elders obtained a
[2:09:24] good report and true faith we understand
[2:09:27] the world will frame by the Word of God
[2:09:29] so that things which are seen were not
[2:09:32] made of things which do appear is now
[2:09:35] right
[2:09:36] Oh musicians could get ready to come I'm
[2:09:39] almost finish but a balance out on
[2:09:42] Israel and the church he said me won't
[2:09:44] have time on this to go back there but
[2:09:46] we're going to start up here at the
[2:09:47] beginning of the church and and that was
[2:09:50] when he said no you found another church
[2:09:52] the word church means called out to call
[2:09:55] our people he said I believe in I need
[2:09:57] every denomination under the heaven
[2:09:59] today there's got to be some good people
[2:10:02] in every one of them and I believe that
[2:10:04] if Jesus comes it's good to be a call
[2:10:07] out group and I believe that way away
[2:10:10] away away from the coming of the Lord as
[2:10:13] far as the church is concerned or
[2:10:15] conditions are no conditions for the
[2:10:17] coming of the Lord
[2:10:18] he said we can have faith for divine
[2:10:21] healing let alone to be raptured he said
[2:10:24] has got to come something to happen he
[2:10:27] said why if somebody speak of rapture
[2:10:29] and they say well what are you talking
[2:10:31] about some of the people members of the
[2:10:32] church they talk about divine healing
[2:10:34] said I do believe and such he said they
[2:10:36] can't see well he said I believed it
[2:10:38] they hypnotized them said well how could
[2:10:41] that person ever go in a rapture
[2:10:43] how could he resurrects on the dead when
[2:10:44] there's nothing to resurrect from
[2:10:45] there's nothing to resurrect him it's
[2:10:48] just a make-believe
[2:10:50] a mental psychic when you say I believe
[2:10:52] Jesus Christ is the son of God he said
[2:10:55] that's all right he said but brother if
[2:10:57] that isn't coming from the heart hear
[2:10:59] what he says why it's only mentally he
[2:11:03] said if it can't come from the heart it
[2:11:06] can't come from the heart until the Holy
[2:11:08] Ghost
[2:11:09] there's record of it jesus said no man
[2:11:12] or the Bible said rather no man can say
[2:11:15] that jesus is a christ only by the Holy
[2:11:18] Ghost and you can't say it in yourself
[2:11:21] the Holy Spirit has to speak it from you
[2:11:25] he said when Peter confessed him he said
[2:11:28] thou art the Christ son of the Living
[2:11:30] God he said blessed are thou Simon bar
[2:11:33] Jonah for flesh and blood has not
[2:11:35] revealed this to you but my father which
[2:11:38] is in heaven
[2:11:39] and I say thou art Peter upon this rock
[2:11:42] I'll build my church and the gates of
[2:11:44] Hell shall not prevail against it he
[2:11:47] said you see where we're at
[2:11:48] he said to a man so the Holy Ghost in
[2:11:51] you is what bears record of Christ
[2:11:54] hallelujah hallelujah in your heart and
[2:11:57] in your life the holy goat has to speak
[2:12:01] back bow out the Christ in order for you
[2:12:04] to be a proper witness so that when the
[2:12:06] Holy Ghost can speak back to God that a
[2:12:10] genuine son of God speaking back Oh
[2:12:12] hallelujah
[2:12:14] that's what we want not just a mental
[2:12:16] state but a spiritual state part on on
[2:12:20] the inside
[2:12:20] the thing that ankles the finger rules
[2:12:24] the thing that held brother Branham in
[2:12:26] is trial that's the thing that's got to
[2:12:29] speak back so you see me here I trust
[2:12:32] him
[2:12:33] power the Christ Oh hallelujah I believe
[2:12:36] every promise in the book is right whoa
[2:12:39] only the Holy Ghost could speak back
[2:12:41] like that in many many many lujah and
[2:12:45] God could see his own reflection in you
[2:12:47] speaking back to him isn't alright you
[2:12:50] can play something softly a meadow one
[2:12:52] that Jesus told Nicodemus you must be
[2:12:54] born again
[2:12:56] ignite jesus answered verily verily I
[2:12:58] say unto thee except a man be born of
[2:13:01] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[2:13:04] into the kingdom of God that which is
[2:13:07] born of the flesh is flesh and that
[2:13:09] which is born of the Spirit is spirit
[2:13:12] he said Marvel not that I see entity you
[2:13:14] must be born again the wind blew it
[2:13:17] where it listeth and don't hear it the
[2:13:19] sound thereof
[2:13:20] what you don't know where it's coming
[2:13:22] from or where it was so it is every one
[2:13:26] that is born of the Spirit
[2:13:28] Oh hallelujah hallelujah work and figure
[2:13:31] out no more you will no longer from here
[2:13:33] you are from eternity you just passing

[2:13:54] cause Jacob please God and you are gonna
[2:13:57] please God also because without faith is
[2:14:00] impossible to please him isn't there a
[2:14:03] man one more quote that I'm finished the
[2:14:07] Prophet said at the end of the
[2:14:08] Pentecostal age we're supposed to
[2:14:10] receive according to the word and God
[2:14:12] help me tonight to show you through here
[2:14:14] with receive a messenger that will take
[2:14:16] all those loose ends I'll be and reveal
[2:14:18] the whole secret of God for the rafting
[2:14:20] of the church and it's coming for seven
[2:14:22] mysterious thunders that's not even
[2:14:24] written at all that's right and I
[2:14:26] believe that through those seven
[2:14:27] thunders will be revealed in the last
[2:14:28] days in order to get the bride ready
[2:14:30] it's together for rapture and see
[2:14:32] because what we got right now we won't
[2:14:35] be able to make it there is something
[2:14:37] we've got to step further and we can
[2:14:40] have sweet enough for divine healing
[2:14:41] hardly but we've got to have enough heat
[2:14:43] to be changed in a moment and to be
[2:14:46] swept up out of this earth and we have
[2:14:48] finally after a while the Lord willing
[2:14:49] where it is written
[2:14:50] a man Israel in the church he said I
[2:14:53] believe when the border line tonight
[2:14:54] even I was wondering about all my
[2:14:56] meetings and things and how I have to
[2:14:58] cancel them and I truly truly believe
[2:15:00] that before the church can have the
[2:15:02] rapture it's got the abrupt rain see we
[2:15:05] cannot plead for divine healing you said
[2:15:06] but we've got our faith that will change
[2:15:08] and
[2:15:09] in this body and be ticularly he said I
[2:15:11] believe there's a church on its route
[2:15:13] tonight a power of the Living God that
[2:15:17] men will speak and the word here and
[2:15:19] there you get a little flash like
