[20:18] and it is another book of Acts amen
[20:22] another book of Acts pre-scored
[20:25] hallelujah isn't there a he many men
[20:29] Christ in a true church is a
[20:32] continuation of this book of Acts that
[20:34] we're talking about tonight
[20:35] isn't that right praise God the Prophet
[20:38] said so isn't that right hallelujah so
[20:40] we're looking for a continuation of what
[20:43] God started to do in the early church he
[20:46] promised to do it in the Omega church he
[20:48] promised to do it among our people our
[20:50] nother people in the land who under
[20:53] their messenger will be the final voice
[20:56] to the final age and I believe tonight
[20:59] that God has such a people to name a man
[21:03] a man do you believe it tonight
[21:04] please God is so thankful to be living
[21:06] in the land of the living tonight praise
[21:09] God are we going to have a testimony
[21:11] just like Enoch Han but before we leave
[21:14] here remain we're gonna please God amen
[21:18] we're going to live something to our
[21:21] families to our friends to our
[21:23] co-workers wherever we are we going to
[21:26] live something amen amen we're not going
[21:29] to be deceived a man not like Eve praise
[21:33] God but we're gonna take the whole word
[21:34] amen and apply it praise God and do
[21:37] something about this word that we've
[21:39] heard for years and generations isn't
[21:42] that right holiday but it got a tick on
[21:44] form it's got a tick on flesh praise God
[21:47] amen hallelujah hallelujah begin to
[21:50] think about it more and more and it's
[21:52] not the work of man it's a work of the
[21:54] Spirit and we were living in an age
[21:56] where a man has been in control I've
[21:58] been in charge of things has been ruling
[22:00] things moving things around here seeing
[22:02] things having a say it's now right but
[22:05] that's only for a time and a season the
[22:08] time of the Spirit is beginning to
[22:09] switch over at some point it's gonna
[22:12] switch over from the natural to the
[22:14] spiritual isn't that right will be no
[22:17] more man doing the work but if we do
[22:20] work up the Holy Spirit the Prophet said
[22:22] it was they call it the book of Acts
[22:25] but what it's supposed to really be is
[22:26] the acts of the Holy Ghost in the
[22:29] Apostles amen amen
[22:31] is what wrought the works amen the Bible
[22:34] said the Lord went everywhere with them
[22:36] confirming the word with science with
[22:40] wonders and with miracles a many men
[22:44] with power with anointing with his
[22:47] presence Oh hallelujah hallelujah is
[22:50] night so I'm really excited tonight
[22:52] about what is God God is about to do
[22:55] because a man had his opinion about
[22:58] things Holloman has is say about what's
[23:01] supposed to take place but when God is
[23:02] in charge we cannot argue with it
[23:05] you cannot dispute it there is no debate
[23:08] God said so whatever God says in the
[23:11] church if God choose to set in the
[23:15] church apostles prophets teachers
[23:19] evangelists and pastors and ministers
[23:22] for your perfection for the work of the
[23:25] ministry to raise you up for such a time
[23:28] as this and who could argue with that
[23:30] the spirit is in control brother
[23:33] if court choose to fill you then Court
[23:35] is in charge
[23:36] if court choose to heal you then
[23:38] quarters in charge
[23:40] if court choose to redeem your family
[23:42] then court is in charge tonight if God
[23:45] choose to give you your heart's desire
[23:47] or no man can do nothing about it
[23:50] hallelujah
[23:56] in the book of Acts if you look back in
[24:00] the scripture the disciples will place
[24:04] my fire in the upper room no man came
[24:09] down and said you had to do this you
[24:12] supposed to do that
[24:13] there was no bishopric it's now right
[24:16] there was no rulership it was a Holy
[24:18] Spirit moving among them holy men speak
[24:22] as you read in the scripture and they
[24:24] will move by the Holy Ghost Peter stood
[24:27] up on that day a man the pier Pentecost
[24:29] and say repent every one of you and be
[24:32] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[24:35] the remission of your sins and you shall
[24:37] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[24:40] this promise is unto you and to your
[24:43] children and to as many of them as I
[24:45] power off the season a change town come
[24:52] the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit was
[24:55] now in charge brother sister tonight I
[24:58] long to see a church under the influence
[25:01] of the Holy Ghost of the Holy Spirit
[25:04] where there's no more man to win
[25:07] anything man not making a decision no
[25:10] more but called himself Pilate revealing
[25:13] himself anointing the people by fire
[25:16] placing this one place in not one place
[25:20] in that one that's what we come for come
[25:30] the final place in Christ is no man long
[25:36] to find his place in this world man
[25:39] tried to find a natural purpose and man
[25:42] go to all kinds of lengths all kinds of
[25:45] breaths and widths and depths to try to
[25:47] figure out his purpose to try to figure
[25:50] out what he's here for
[25:51] and looking for self-fulfillment they go
[25:54] into all kinds of endeavors where it's
[25:57] science where is technology where it's
[26:00] in the pursuit of business where it's in
[26:02] the pursuit of knowledge hallelujah but
[26:04] the Jesus said
[26:05] seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[26:09] then all these other things shall be
[26:11] added unto you if you wanna find your
[26:14] purpose you got to come to the one who
[26:17] made your purpose in the beginning he's
[26:20] the one who knows what your next step is
[26:23] if you don't know where to go if you
[26:26] don't know what you're supposed to do
[26:27] next
[26:28] look to Jesus tonight look to car
[26:30] tonight look to the pillar of fire he
[26:34] knows what you have need of he knows
[26:37] what you're supposed to do tonight oh I
[26:46] forgot anoints had an inspiration here
[26:48] my inspiration is one is a majority amen
[26:52] praise God
[26:53] one is a majority and now we can tie
[26:56] that in here now we talking to
[26:57] individuals individuals priests gone and
[27:01] remember in this book of Acts now when
[27:03] the Holy Spirit come down and anointed
[27:06] the disciples I was sitting there 120
[27:08] what is it saying each one got their own
[27:10] lake of fire isn't that right the Holy
[27:14] Ghost pours out upon individuals it
[27:17] always does
[27:18] it always has praise God no church could
[27:22] hold a Holy Ghost isn't that so no group
[27:25] could come out and call claims they
[27:27] they've got the Holy Ghost or they've
[27:28] got the angel or they've got the power
[27:31] or they've got the key or daily it group
[27:34] you can't have that it's not biblical
[27:36] it's not scripturally supported
[27:39] hallelujah so we cast it out praise God
[27:42] the Holy Ghost pours out on individuals
[27:44] oh the church could hold a honey but the
[27:47] Holy Ghost you've got to get it for
[27:49] yourself
[27:49] oh somebody say man oh I now feel like
[27:54] preaching tonight oh you've got to get
[27:56] it for yourself

[28:02] can't get it for you
[28:03] your wife can't get it for you you've
[28:05] got to pray you've got to cry you've got
[28:09] to hold on to the horns of the altar as

[43:33] same spirit I was upon Moses is upon you
[43:36] how come
[43:38] and I've called you for this purpose the
[43:40] people in here the voice the people may
[43:42] not have known please go early to the
[43:44] extent of it but Joshua knew and as he
[43:47] keep the command the people who paid the
[43:49] people respected he told them march
[43:51] around Jericho once every six days on a
[43:54] seven day march 7 times they were here
[43:57] in instructions from court on my cheek
[44:02] that the man of God hallelujah was
[44:05] speaking from God speaking Paul cause
[44:09] keep your silence isn't that right just
[44:14] imagine for a six-day period they have
[44:17] to keep their silence because not a word
[44:19] they couldn't speak they couldn't do
[44:22] nothing well under silence God wanted to
[44:25] do a work it take obedience for you to
[44:28] really come into that condition praise
[44:30] God hallelujah
[44:31] think about it you couldn't speak
[44:32] couldn't say anything just march around
[44:35] in silence obeying every command or
[44:38] paying every instruction but that's how
[44:40] God is gonna have a church in this last
[44:42] days God it's gonna take individuals and
[44:46] he's gonna try them and he's gonna put
[44:48] them true stuff
[44:49] heavy stuff that's up a core know each
[44:52] holily unless a corn or wheat fall into
[44:55] the ground and die he will abide alone
[44:57] I'm quoting quale to be alone tonight
[45:00] no no no oh but there's more coming
[45:03] there's more fruits coming or the waving
[45:06] of the sheaths malachite was already
[45:08] gone for CH an adopted son has already
[45:11] come out praise God there's gonna be
[45:13] more top that sons Oh hallelujah
[45:15] hallelujah
[45:17] it's gonna be more sons a man adopted
[45:20] perfecting ojala used by God just like a
[45:24] prophet was is now bring you under
[45:31] obedience God wants to bring you on a
[45:33] subjection to the word so that you could
[45:36] follow the entire world full obedience
[45:39] to the Holy Spirit entitles you to the
[45:42] token it's nothing fallopian so all of
[45:45] the Word of God obedience or what he
[45:47] said obedience or what he says to do how
[45:50] to conduct yourself isn't that right
[45:52] because if he pills a man on one
[45:54] condition he's got to do it on a pillar
[45:56] man on the same condition isn't that
[45:58] right and if Cornelius was just
[46:01] if Cornelius was devout if Cornelius was
[46:04] sanctified praying always giving arms
[46:07] and a memorial in heaven for his prayers
[46:10] and God fill him with the Holy Ghost and
[46:13] God's got to do the same thing to
[46:15] somebody who's just somebody who's the
[46:17] pouch somebody who's praying always
[46:19] somebody who's in the spirit
[46:21] somebody who knows who they are what
[46:23] they call to - somebody's waiting on God
[46:26] waiting for God trusting in him
[46:29] believing in him and calling upon his
[46:31] name what would go to for that man but
[46:34] what go to for that woman he has a
[46:36] feeling he has to seal you
[46:39] God is obligated hallelujah though his
[46:41] promise to you if you keep him at your
[46:44] end of the bargain is Nair I'm so happy
[46:52] tonight one is a majority in God a man
[46:56] is no one person could change the course
[46:58] of events look at that woman with a dead
[47:01] baby

[47:27] prayer cards and different ones and and
[47:28] people come up with

[47:31] structure taking place but this one

[47:41] needed something she wanted and she

[47:49] with that
[47:49] no.11 she begin to battle she begins a
[47:51] fight she was not gonna take no for an
[47:54] answer and that's how you got to be

[47:59] from God
