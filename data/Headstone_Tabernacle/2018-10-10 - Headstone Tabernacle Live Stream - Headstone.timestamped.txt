[26:48] Bible back to the word back to the
[26:51] original tonight that is who you are
[26:54] tonight or do you believe that tonight
[26:57] the Holy Spirit knows who he is after

[27:26] shall conceive but she didn't know it
[27:29] there was no name Mary
[27:31] but it was just words on the book a
[27:34] virgin shall conceive but when Mary was
[27:37] born a prophecy was hanging over her
[27:40] head because she was supposed to fulfill
[27:42] the name Holly the words I was in the
[27:45] book
[27:46] her name was not bearing per se that was
[27:49] a natural name but her name was a name

[28:18] was an original group up there we did
[28:20] not fall to the devil's lie they did not
[28:23] fall to the devil's deception but they
[28:25] held sure they stand strong to the Word
[28:29] of the Living God I believe tonight I am
[28:32] speaking to that group that group would
[28:35] be destinated I can't hear I can't hear
[28:39] I believe tonight
[28:41] somebody say man I believe tonight I'm

[29:22] on the understanding of God all of what
[29:24] God said his knowledge his understanding
[29:28] his wisdom he said his ways are higher
[29:32] than your ways and his thoughts are
[29:35] higher than your thoughts or our pots

[1:04:15] his kingdom to when God made Adam in the
[1:04:18] beginning when God rested on the seventh
[1:04:20] day he turned his back imagine God is so
[1:04:23] confident and something that he has done
[1:04:26] that he is so pious he is so at rest
[1:04:29] that he is willing to turn his back and
[1:04:32] let things run knowing that Adam has
[1:04:35] God's mind on the matter he knows that
[1:04:39] he has a son down there who would do the
[1:04:42] right thing he knows how he has a son
