Lord the psalmist David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord and Lord thank you for waking us up this morning Lord not just from our beds but waking us up Lord from Lord the conditions of the past and law where we have come from that we could see the newness and the cleanness of what you're doing in this hour and in this season Laurie thank you for your

you found us Lord and sends a great message of deliverance to us Laura we can look beyond and look up our Redemption draweth nigh we see the signs everywhere Lord of what's taking place Lord in the

that we already lured them law because we know your promise to come Lord and your promise to take complete control so lo me you bless your church this morning me you blessed by the orbit as we pierce a common preach this morning may you give him strength eNOS but is it comes to minister the word to us and may you bless this little greeting that I bring to the church before the pastor comes into the pulpit of the secret deaths this morning may you bless every son every daughter that's here know me you bless those that are connected on the internet and those whatever would I would hear the tape father may your Holy Ghost have the preeminence to be bless the word and the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen just some notes of phrases before we move on pre-scored Priya's going I like another priest that sounds like that praise God praise God good morning to the Church of the Living God I want to thank you all for praying for me a lot this morning I want you all to give God tongues I'm pleased with me for on Friday made it one year since I had angioplasty stent procedure done in my heart thank God for safe and a perfect procedure it is the hand of God thank you lord thank you Jesus Roberto Rudolf Thomas [Music] and also from but Alexis where the Alexis would like to give Taunton her thanks and praise and he says all is well so he reminds me of that woman who had that that dead child and racing down the road they say what's going on why is feeling she don't worry about it all is well all is well you don't know my story but all is well you don't know the trouble I've seen but all is well can the church say Amen and our last one of praise reading scenes for years my spine has been curved in my back and on Wednesday night while worshiping I felt my spine straightening I want to give God a high note of praise for my healing praise God for the pterence of it god bless you and Terence and he who started the work in you is more than able to bring it to completion more than able to bring it to pass Oh hallelujah so before you take your seats evidence of your Bible just for this greeting would eternal me to one portion of Scripture but Reuben will be preaching so I'm just here to greet you give my New Year's greetings to the church but I want to read quickly from Daniel 12 from verse 1 Daniel 1201 and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the churn of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased with a lord at a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning so I like to take this time I just wanted to greet you in the precious name of Jesus Christ isn't it good to be back home here in China Nana with the home church as well I bring greetings from Ghana from brother Solomon mechina and the life tabernacle of tamale and the convention over there with an at-sea go where the Ramon Thomason brother Oh Lu where the pollen and Jake are and all the churches and we had a really tremendous time in the convention it was really a mighty mighty mighty meeting and the theme of the convention was taking Jesus out of history now we don't serve a historical God he's a present tense chord and the same thing he did back then and many times where the Branham said it's easy to talk about what Jesus did and it's easy to talk about what he's going to do but it takes a great key to speak about the present tense realities of the Living God especially as we see them falling before our very eyes so but in Solomon had a burden to take Jesus out of history that he's not just the God of yesterday he's not just the God of forever but he's also the God of today and he is still as real today as he was then and he still has you today as you will be in the future and we are looking for a great manifestation in this new year of everything and the Prophet prophesied you believe that this morning so I was certainly want to wish every brother every sister every family every young brother every young sister every young child every member of the church was I connected a happy and blessed and a wonderful new year and that may this year be a year of your spiritual breakthrough may this year be a year of every breakthrough that you have been looking for because there's a promise of restoration there's a promise of all at the cankerworm eats and all the locusts all a palmer worm everything is to be restored and by the rant about the fullness of time and III was invited to preach about Alfred Davidson's a church for all last night I didn't know I was gonna be pitching over last night but I end up reaching over or last night or over there as well and I preached when time runs out because time is running out and I spoke about the blending of time into eternity because everything that's happening around us it's a blending of time into eternity because time is running out and I spoke about how when and I preach the message here before I said when demon left the sheep the countdown of God started and times had to run out on Goliath David they've even know what is going on and Goliath didn't know what's going on but in the economy of God God was counting down time because since the fall of man in the Garden of Eden a clock started in this break from eternity that is a countdown until we reconnect with eternity so everything around us is nothing because we are creatures of eternity trapped in time and we come from God and we are going back to God and that's the great mood that's taking place now we are leaving this place we are getting out of here and we are closer today than yesterday we are closer this year than last year we are closer this month and last month you a closer know that maybe we started this service because every minute that passes it's a countdown going on a countdown to the rapture a countdown to the resurrection a countdown to our complete transformation you may be seated but the turan spoke about a spine straightening out those that do that know that those are easy signs we're gonna see more comfortable said missing links will be restored hallelujah as we near the headstone every service we come nearer to the headstone in this endtime all forces are loose every devil is against this message every demon is against his bride hallelujah but his bride is not anybody's bride it's a bride of Jesus Christ she could never be defeated she could never be crushed she could never back up because she is the bride of Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord so in the face of every situation because situations will come in your life situation will come in the world situation will come in the church situation will come because God allows situations to come God is never surprised God doesn't read a newspaper and say what is this because everything in his mind was written before there was a world before there was a moon before there was a star we wake up and wonder what's going on but God in the economy of God he knows the end from the beginning he is Alpha and Omega is the author and the finisher so these are the principles of life that as we enter into unknown waters because we are walking into unknown waters or as I said we have not been this way before but we are depending on the mighty angel even the one with the swept-back wings that guide us every day to guide you on your job to guide you in your marriage to guide you in your prayer life to guide you with what scriptures to go to to be able to live every day because this message I was saying to her over in the office this message is not a politically correct message the world can feel free to claim what they believe and what the agenda is and when they identify to be well I am free this morning with my identification I'm identify with the rapture I'm identify with a prophet whose purpose was to turn the hearts of the children black Smith of the Apostolic fathers can the church say man you can take that out of me you can put it out of me you can brand it out of me you may be seated and every son must be tested every son must be tried hallelujah because it's an individual up here I cannot speak for anybody else it's an individual up here my account is to code we have to report to God because he has no grandchildren there's only sons and daughters hallelujah what have you done with the wood what have you done with his gospel what have you done with this message and in this last hour it's a great hour of charge you think the devil is gonna sit down and let you walk out of this earth know all hell is trying to find you because it's a seed in you that's per sitting light there's light over you from when you were born there was light over you when you were walking in the world there was light over you because there's a seed germ that's inside of your soul can the church Haman Oh hallelujah may be seated so take courage get confidence in this that we have believed we have not believed cunningly devised fables this class was did not start last year 20 years ago his gospel started when we were there before there was a moon before there was a stop this story of redemption how God wanted to express his attributes his love the fact that he is the father the fact that is the healer the fact that he's a redeemer is that an assumption it's a fact it's a truth it's the present reality that he will hide us under a canopy under his medallion in the time of trouble in the midst of the storm that's when we speak to the storm when there's no food on the table then you speak for food you may be seated hallelujah I'm not a preacher this morning just had to greet you but this is a new year this is a new season it's a new time it's a new dispensation and if God be for us tell me who can be against us Oh hallelujah you may be seated listen God don't need us to defend him he is fully capable of defending himself let me say that one more time cor don't need us to defend him he is fully able to defend himself he put the moon there he put here o dare to break Pharaoh [Music] Jesus to Herod listen you are only there because my father allow you to be there if I want to call it angel from heaven to fight for me I could choose that but I have to go through these things you may be seated [Applause] happy new year hallelujah we'll have a brief church meeting after service I want to share a few things with you you know so we see the signs everywhere see Iran declaring war it's no longer this room a declaration of war for the first time the red flag is flying which means war you think it's a game I was seeing in my wife this morning Daniel didn't go looking for trouble the Hebrew boys in were looking for trouble but their trouble comes we will deal with trouble we now look into listen that's why I gave it acts the Lord shall I push you because I want to be led to act and I don't want to act anyhow I want to be led to act but if you give me the order to act I'm not backing down we are not going to bow down we are not gonna die because if those who died in the Dark Ages didn't give up for this gospel you think I'm gonna give up now this gospel is dripping with blood God will still have young people and some killers who will stand for righteousness no matter the obstacle no matter the situation can the church give the Lord a shout of praise let me come out right here so I wanna you made me see that it's on a suit by the Stephen Oliver you appreciate by the Stephen Oliveri he's our administrator fella and if you're responsible for the children with the over and I are not here and I want to thank him for his service while we were out a minute but the anthony o'brien god bless you and Anthony ministering last Sunday and then or last night or elder brother brother George kindly amber to see you know but Anthony appreciate these men of God hey man and I'm under great expectation for what this year will present to us and it's rarely something else friends when we appreciate the fact that God is not surprised that's a big lesson in life in and I was preaching the continuation of the generation of Jesus Christ couple weeks ago and how God plan things a certain way to unfold things to confuse the devil to confuse the devil it sucked and I said God is the author of confusion but a gorge but he loves to confuse the enemy become better brands hidden message would look washed up it will look defeated but it's when Samson looked defeated that's when his hair was growing up can the church say man so we tangoed for a seven seals seven Thunder message from a vindicated prophet messenger of sin of Revelation 10 prophet of sin Luke 17 today we have a true message of Malachi 4 5 and 6 that is the Turner hats back before the Great and dreadful D because a dreadful day is coming it's coming come to church amen but in that time in a time of trouble like the world has never seen Micah will stand up and deliver every name that's on the book and that's why Jesus taught us all disciples don't rejoice because you have power but rejoice because your names are written because if your names are written there's no devil no demon no principality no power nothing past that in person nothing to come nothing could separate you from the love of God that wrote your name on the book and put it in blood that nothing could change the speed of God in you that is leaving you to adoption leading you to perfection and leading you to manifestation of the sons of God service is this the time for the manifestation of the sons of God when born sons fills son's adopted son speak and what you see will be created can the church give the Lord a shout of praise so I salute you happy new year I'll speak to you after the service brother Anthony give the Lord

mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I eat let my belly was bitter said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings or praise the name of the Lord so that

almighty being humble himself unfolding himself and comment about your flesh that any man could touch with his hands what is he doing claiming his Road trying to get into man he went and offered his own blood when no other blood could do no wonder he was the priceless price of heaven no wonder he was king of kings he unfolded himself and come down and submitted himself on the cross and dying when he was stand-in there someone said I could call my father and he could send me ten legion of angels but my kingdom is not of this world and hear the crowd say nowhere with him i wailing him why didn't he tell her and say away with you here's the reason he couldn't friends look at it damn was his own children to think of a man's children crying for their daddy's blood if my children was running from my blood there has been nothing as I could see take me he if he refused to do it he lost his child his very creation his human beings and they was the one that was calling for his blood could you imagine the children calling for their father's blood that is the reason he couldn't say no if he said no they were lost I will die freely from my children my children and any other father would look what he was his own children crying for his blood oh my and the blood of sheep couldn't do it well of course couldn't do it well if cattle can do it but a blood of God himself and the great Hungarian person among Stein I was here and fleshed them then he cleansed the way that he could come and live in your heart know that same spirit that thundered from Mount Sinai is living in the human being what a marvelous supporter said every heart jump a man done a sin he committed adultery he stole or broke the Sabbath or some commandment then he had to get a lamb he had to bring this ram into the elders no there's a reason why I'm reading it right with me this may be a bit a long time but I want you to go it and it is a reason I'm reading this watch this Saudi man sin he commits adultery he stole he broke a Sabbath then he had to get a lamp this is poor system he had to bring the llama to the elders they had to look this lamb over the lama to be blameless had to be without a flaw on it look at the significance here the lamb had to be blameless for a blamed person I remember a little story I don't know what I ever told them not just a little fiction story under the law if I all mother horse had a Colt and it was a mule you know and his ears broke down his knees knocked what a cross a horrible can knew that knew he could look at himself is oh no my when he must have come he will kill me because he couldn't feed me I'm not going to live look at me what I'll be looking miss I am but if the mother could speak back to that little fellow she was in wait a minute honey you can live because you are my first and you have a but right now when the master come out and seized you with all your condition he has got to go back and get a lamb without blemish on it and kill it so that crippled up looking moon could live you see the priest never seen the mule he saw the limb it wasn't whether the mule was perfect it had to be a perfect lamb I hope you see it it isn't whether you are good enough to be a Christian or not it is whether he was good enough and if God accepted him and his blood makes an atonement God don't see you he sees the lamb that's a little mule could stick up his tail in the air and snort and jump and run over the field and have a good time he is going to live but one perfect had to die that was me William bear him no good not fit to live would you go to hell born in a sinful family raised a sinan over at all but one day I accepted and when God looked on Christ Christ took my place then God don't see me he sees the perfect one then as long as I am here in him I am perfected not in myself in him this is the part of what I got - not my perfection I don't have any but it is this perfection or give the Lord a shout or glory that God is not your perfection it's his perfection Oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God let's bet his cap it off here so Paul said when the worshiper come and bring if you don't wrong he come with a little lamb the priests check the lamb and so on and here comes the man that was done wrong I have been stealing and I know no I'm subject to death because I did wrong God wouldn't want me to steal his commandment see not know I'm going to leave my hands upon the lamb and gore commandment said he had thou shalt not steal I stole I know am sorry that something got the answer for my sin cause I stole and God said add a video of that day you die you steal you got a die fit so he required if I didn't want to die I had to bring a lamb so I leave the land on here I put my hands a little fellow I said Lord I'm sorry as I stole I confess and promise you I won't steal anymore except me no I'm gonna accept him because the lamb took that place oh isn't that right hallelujah so you see now we see that

and a transforming power by seven little noises my god hallelujah glory to God praise the name of the Lord so the lamp take the book on seal division we sent it to John Whitehorse red horse black horse pale horse soars on the altar and the seven seals silence because under they have a bride and the prophecy them Tumblr's under the silence he put the tunnels under the silence and the tunnels was gone to get the bride not 14-ton does just seven seven thunders loosen seven spirits though all of the earth hallelujah God took the prophet but the spirits remain Alou and that spirit come to produce the testimony of Jesus by the spirit of prophecy or glory no got the prophesy of this bride that will not come to perfection before the resurrection I want to see it again you have to come to perfection before the resurrection and that's why I read is not your perfection it is his perfection Oh underneath the blur hallelujah glory to God hallelujah so this prophetic vision of the end time that was loosed by that malachi for prophet came in two parts one was the learning of his word as he said in the time of the revelation of these things being made known so we have been living under the time of the revelation of these things being made known but at some point it has to change to the manifestation of these things that was made known Oh glory to God I say the time is at hand or glow in the core the change of the mechanics the dynamics the change from the revelation of these things we may known all the mysteries been revealed these mystery truths been revealed into the manifestation because you cannot see seven thunders just design review institutes because seven thunders is to become a manifestation seven thunders is in two parts revelation and manifestation I say the time is at hand for the manifestation of the seven thunders or glory to God where sons will be placed in their ranks o God put the patch upon the sons make this one a general make this one a lieutenant make this one this slowly and that's all yeah and put the stamp of a pool I'll lose the money earth steve was a deacon busting the word ripping food Oh hallelujah give the Lord a shout all of them filled with the Holy Ghost all of them were the open vision I wonder holy Sh I have this vision the whole church have a prophetic vision what the prophet reveal that you have to become you have to become a living would practice continue Oh hallelujah what about their seven seals seven spirits seven angels seven horns seven churches seven sevens he says external mists of the lamb have been slain having seven heads seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God similarly only what is those seven spirits them seven messengers he interpreted that he converts every spirit in the Sun messages he said every scene Columba Arrhenius John Wesley Martin and so forth the seven spirits which are seven men which asked seven messages so he accomplished the men you have to preach the messages these seven men go coming to you so when you convert that the seven spirits or glory the zodiac must commend to you this book is not coming to you but this pyramid is all glory hallelujah hallelujah show trone's lightnings seven lamps or seven stars call seven spirits meaning manifestations of the Holy Spirit of the seven Church ages at the seven seats of most of the people here they are seven seas of mercy seven seats seven churches seven stars several manifestation seven spirits seven lamps all mine how God is perfect Oh glory to God so what the Prophet did the Prophet come and bring us a big panoramic of this vision of the end time sharing the truth is supposed to be the sixth season unfolded judgment the white horse right now riding straight to hell or glory to God but he saw a vision of the pride being called out he saw a vision of a break come back and step he saw a vision of a bride just like the first one or walking on what Christians own as national tour he saw that right and the one hold out the step before he said get back and step what step this step of the world there's only seven steps ago get back and step faith virtue knowledge although he stepped of a flagship in the twenty seven steps alone it's not twenty seven mysteries is only seven mysteries there's seven voices seven thunders seven voices seven steps glory to God are you with me hallelujah praise be to Jesus hallelujah so what all his messages to produce is supposed to bring back listen carefully the Ministry of Jesus Christ not my ministry - no it's supposed to restore the Ministry of Jesus Christ back among the people then he said at the finishing of the seventh seal we're supposed to be all the way up there and then we are worshiping the Living Christ him moving in and out among us who is that Christ Oh hallelujah priest we believe that thank you lord thank you lord hallelujah give him some praises glory to God hallelujah hallelujah uncle oh Jesus glory God alone holds the key who do men say I the Son of Man am though I the Christ so Court holds the key to Revelation God alone knows that though there is no school no theologians no teaching of the Bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it is impossible for them to know about it about it God has hid the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers it's a personal individual of fear with the person that Christ is revealed to them so when somebody want to manage you and bring you onto the umbrella like if you go lose your salvation if you go lose your life you will not die at church or whatever it is all of that is foolishness because this is not you and Mary and God this is not you deep past and very you and God we pass this data fulfill our role and a purpose but you are his sons and daughters and the faithful ministry is placed for your perfection to bring you into the channel that is spirit could flow freely or glory to God because the spirit have to come into the body and flow out pizza was in the body and it flowed out to the ether when you knock it flowed out at Cornelius house right Peter yet spake these words God shucked him he didn't expect that when he began to speak the word the Holy Ghost fell on Cornelius and open up the door for the Gentiles they serve a truth look the Holy Ghost that fell on us well on them so broad mixing up this thing God has to permit us to choose alone and grow an Italian tower no it's going the opposite board about the finish the sentence that is where we have to get desperate because there was so much only force in the bucket to access equality equal in last drop any bucket when that access I said you know book is closed brightest ceiling foolish virgins foolish virgin oh my particular more hallelujah it's a personal individual of fear with the person that Christ revealed to them and if you say there we go he revealed to me and the life that Christ producer in the Bible that same life is in him does not produce itself you have got the wrong revelation I am man talk all connoting but the angel and his ministry and this and that and so on overseas I I everybody claim in some kind of thing but the light is something completely different and that's what seeing if the angel come and say something and the life is Nydia we want where that angel change the angel dismiss that angel say I don't want you because it has to produce a life I don't want to enjoy it merely because I give and I'm a slacker and there's no life with it and I claim in some manifestation I don't want no manifestation like that I want that I don't need to see a sign you know I just want this I want this thing living in me I want to know my wife could see it feel it I want him a churn that see it let me drop this bomb on you he said the ministry has reached perfection when Christ is representing that is not talking Christ that is not preaching a message that is repetition the same life that Jesus had who's the not your flesh nor Putin if people bunks you to get it just sticky but honey this sticky but love oh bloody bees could understand that the bees body language you're talking you're

that Christ producer in the Bible that same life is in him does not produce itself in you you cut the wrong revelation if the life of Jesus ever put for another body of believers it will be the fruit the first one did they will write a book of Acts behind it and no man was in charge of the book of Acts no apostle no super Pope no message Pope no anointed apart not none none will judge the Spirit of the Lord let Philip hear Peter when dear Paul reindeer they were led by the spirit that is the book of Acts it was the awesome man it was the acts of the Holy Ghost or Chloe the Gordon Waddell about to anoint you because we are some acts to do all glory to God Satan he went indoors Eden and he perform an act and throw them both spread in the garden but God said this bride will not be like Eve so what we're for Satan to form this even have his all his people have all his forces his political forces his demon forces his religious forces and he going to anoint a bride Oh God with the white the white horse rider the he goes itself the prize will become the internet word or get the lure - oh no wonder the Bible said I'm the spirit [Applause] that's that loser that's that Wesley talking about that's the Pentecost that is despair that's all rainbow dhole rainbow that's the glory Oh give the Lord a shout are you saying that glory will be upon the bride yes yes yes that's the job story going to come upon your life you'll be robbed but the canopy of life you'll be taken into the tent of his loves its banner over me it's love they will write a book of us beyond your misses it cause it's the same life see what I mean you just can't get away from it it's the life of Christ in you being injected in you by the Holy Spirit it's self living its life through you he said God here we go is known by simplicity and a revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate so the person who can read and write in him or anybody they could get a revelation of Jesus Christ and God can make himself known to that person the most illiterate listen therefore you don't need education to get revelation you don't have to be educated to get revelation here we go see not your theology it's a revelation of Jesus Christ upon this rock I'll build my church no other rocks accepted no nothing's accepted nor the Roman rock nor the protest nor the school knew nothing but on exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ through the new bird he borns in there and he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of Christ has projected so true you whipped preeminence --is that means yourself is disappearing the life of christ project and true you say we'll be okay I know me right I hunt you I know me I know my nature and son like that but when Christ begins to take over I would see less of me and more of him because you will know you and when you begin to behave and a behavior that is unlike you you know is him come on come on come on now come on now you are you but when his lies begin to be projected through you you'll find yourself operating on a level not the humanistic realm but the realm of Revelation brilliant of vision so that's the three steps is that any humanistic okay look you wanna say Graham is they get very posture in fact we see we see that all extremist for me you feel it look like a bird tell me chouhi I do ever do that say when I should I like I'd let them s and some pastors have got rank on the anybody shootin no they wanna get one person a no I didn't do that I'm meeting by yourself and shoot your poo one shot don't shoot you will know who I'm talking to I don't need to take pulpit time to blast one person with an issue no I will tell you and you will know if you want talking to you can have time as you pass the session on blast and I worked and I personally trying to get to look around one time a sister own semen even before he the statement even finishes in email amen amen amen I think it passed a blast in the image most evil emitted a - she said no she is totally he said what's God's revelation unfolding by lack of this revelation is why we are so much divisions among us so much mockery so much division is because the people lack that revelation they lack that revelation the teachers he is saying teachers lack the revelation of Jesus Christ now whatever early teaching is intellect all right I think I'll tell you wrap up here listen to more always I feel inside like a rock finish or like rocks I feel like I know started here right now there's not even second witness telling me first real focus six hours even I would do a community service because treated shape exactly laughing anyone service today grace take some more I want to see let me see where I'm at see what peach I'm out here I have 32 pages I'm a singer Norrish peach 15 yes I've told two pigeons on OHP 15 soap opera in Annie train right now all right so this is pick up a pen and write the Lord spoke to him I was seeking the Lord and the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write I crushed the pen to write his Spirit gives me a message for the church and I want to bring it to you it has to do with the world and the bride now I notice these things we heard before but I want to hear it again I feel as a special season on time and I feel as applicable to the time and sees me in that is why I'm bringing it to you this is what the Prophet this is what God spoke here is what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species would bring forth after its own kind even according to Genesis 111 and God said that it had been for grass the hope even see the fruit trees and fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth it was so whatever life was in the seed came Fortin to our plant Denson to the fruit sighs the process the very law applies to the church today whatever seat staff to the church will comfort and be like the original seed because it is the same seed in these last days here we go the true bride church christ seed we'll come to the headstone number one hallelujah we'll come to it the headstone the bride church will come to the headstone Danny said in system does the does the tund escape the pyramid so that Thomas is the headstone yes the tundish is the capstone revelation of Jesus Christ in two parts mechanics and dynamics so people fight up with mechanics these years not even understanding them mechanics was only making with dynamics because he said my word is spirit and life it's not just a meaning of the word it's power being manifested so your promise is not just a word promise your promise has to be a living promise I manifested promise when quad get around the world of Isaac he added word for 35 years but an Isaac had to come Duff indicate the word that boardgame 25 years ago God not lying to us if God said in elastico be a super church they know light super is another life as we near the headstone that mean every message should be pushing us towards the head start [Applause] [Music] which is the love because the love is the strength of the entire body so as a claim of higher getting more and more stronger and stronger it doesn't destroy all let's continue what the true bride church christ seed will come to the headstone and she will be this is prophecy she did not choose members there's not natural church this is the right she will be the super church a super race as she nears him the in the brain will be so much like him that they will be in his very image number one very image before power image i'm not hearing you before adam at power what it was said let us make man in our image and likeness then let them have dominion so to come back to power you have to come back to image to come back to power you have to come out to the pyramid to come back to power get some melted and virtues hallelujah she the bride will be in his very image so he is prophesied that you will have the token he is prophesied you will have all them seven virtues he is prophesied you will have the life of Jesus Christ he is prophesied he will come to perfection or to the Lord so you can sit here under that prophecy without giving for some worship [Applause] what is image why let the spirit that tentacle openers right explain why the bright have to be is very image the next statement identifies why this is an order to be united with him there will be one that is why the Holy Ghost can never come out alive they were praising and blessing God continually so they had an atmosphere to prepare themselves for the atmosphere so if there is no worship nothing is coming and the revival coming that church is a tribulation Church every church is tribulation Church image purpose of image to be one with him

like Adam but before he could marry her she also fallen she liked Adams wife was put to the test whether she would believe the world I've got a live and oh the wood and died she doubted she left wouldn't die but here we go from a little group of the true seed of the world as if we sparked it have fallen seed but is the true seed so from the true seed have a little group coming out call represent Christ for the beloved bride she's a vision of his word she is a vision because she knows no man-made creature dogmas by and to the members of the bride will be fulfill all that was promised to be made manifest by the vision the word promise came to the Virgin Mary but the world of promise was he himself think about that now the word was he he's not saying the world is doctrine the word of promise was he himself to be made manifest so it's more than just word were changing the heap so the mystery come not as the word and the word change to him ah who is him as many as received him to them gave he power he and the world is the same in the beginning was the word will become him by the word becoming flesh that's him but for him that coming to you do is come by the word the word coming to you that's the secret and then the world turned to spirit power in you it come like right under the devil's nose God slip the word inside of you in silence and the devil is messed up because

made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfill his own word of promise to the version it was an angel that brought her the message but the ancient message was the Word of God and He fulfilled it at a time the members of the bride will love him they will have his potentials for he is their head not some man in England not some analyst it's not some man in Africa or South America actually I don't know where he is their head hallelujah and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies our subject our heads [Music] so our wife could be a bull head not subject to us gonna be bright in that sense you're not subject yourself to the ministry that why some people would jump from church to church they won't want to be under new subjection they want to be
