[51:25] we have had quite some sessions of uh
[51:28] things pertaining to life and godliness

[51:35] the older ones there are stuff that
[51:37] sometimes we don't know we're not aware
[51:39] of and a lot of stuff had been shared
[51:41] downstairs and I want to invite brother
[51:43] Andrew now I'm going to share something
[51:45] for us for a few minutes and that give

[52:19] for the for the opportunity to be able
[52:21] to share with you and just for a brief
[52:25] thought um um and it's just going to be
[52:28] a few minutes just for a brief thought I
[52:30] want to talk about the field of
[52:33] potential and it's
[52:35] basically we're talking about life and
[52:38] godliness and I'm very very passionate
[52:41] about the subject because I don't just
[52:43] believe that we are to have good success
[52:47] just in the spiritual but leave out the
[52:49] Life part
[52:51] amen all right so if you could stand for
[52:54] just a few minutes just to read read a
[52:57] scripture with
[53:00] me so I want to read
[53:02] [Music]
[53:06] from 2 Corinthians
[53:10] 9 verse
[53:22] 6 and it reads on this
[53:25] wise but this I say he which swe it
[53:29] sparingly shall reap also
[53:33] sparingly and he which Seth
[53:36] bomul shall reap also
[53:41] bomul and just one more
[53:44] scripture and it's Ecclesiastes
[53:48] 9 verse
[53:55] 10 and and it
[54:00] says whatsoever thy hand finder to
[54:04] do do it with thy
[54:07] might for there is no work nor device
[54:12] nor knowledge no wisdom in the grave
[54:16] without thou
[54:17] goest amen may the Lord add a blessing
[54:20] to the reading of his word let's just
[54:23] open up in a quick word of prayer Lord
[54:24] Heavenly Father Lord
[54:26] um we know that we need you more than
[54:28] ever in this season Lord Jesus and we
[54:31] just come to create an atmosphere of
[54:33] good ground where we could be nurtured
[54:36] where we could have life and have it
[54:38] more abundantly Lord we ask that these
[54:41] few words be a blessing to your people
[54:43] in your name we pray amen amen you may
[54:45] have your seats
[54:48] amen all right
[54:50] so
[54:52] it's um like we said it's just a a few
[54:55] words
[54:57] and basically in the Bible there's a
[55:00] whole lot of good stuff there's a lot of
[55:03] um like nuggets there's a lot of success
[55:05] principles and within these sessions we
[55:08] would have gone through the
[55:10] righteousness of of
[55:12] profitability um the righteousness um we
[55:16] want to talk about thinking big right
[55:18] because God pulled aside his servant and
[55:22] told him to count the Stars if he can
[55:25] right and God count counted him
[55:27] Believing on that promise as
[55:30] righteousness right we want to talk
[55:31] about the righteousness of Taken
[55:33] territory we would have spoke about that
[55:34] in one of the sessions and strategic um
[55:37] planning and so on but today we're just
[55:40] going to talk very briefly about the
[55:41] field of potential and we believe that
[55:44] God would have put man here on Earth to
[55:47] dress and to keep and to
[55:50] occupy and we must have a great
[55:53] representation about how it is that we
[55:56] we do it so when the Bible would have
[55:58] said do it with all your
[56:00] might right it made me wonder about
[56:03] these stories in the Bible and I see it
[56:06] now
[56:08] David he took his job very
[56:11] seriously right and I wondered if it is
[56:14] that the brothers had an opportunity
[56:17] before to take care of the
[56:19] sheep and then I begin to wonder if they
[56:23] also had a chance to meet up with the
[56:25] lion
[56:27] or to meet up with the bear and what was
[56:30] the outcome or what was that particular
[56:33] report did they come back to their
[56:35] father Jesse and say lamb
[56:38] down it was
[56:40] quick right we didn't get to see what
[56:43] happened right but David the Bible said
[56:46] David said that the that the lion took
[56:49] the
[56:51] sheep and he took back the sheep and
[56:53] slew the lion
[56:57] now for some persons who may not have
[57:00] taken that job so seriously they may
[57:03] have
[57:04] recommended to the to the lion listener
[57:08] pepper and salt does Go real good with
[57:11] this if it is that you smoke it a little
[57:13] bit it does add to the flavor right
[57:16] because there's no way that they go in
[57:18] and attempt to take it that
[57:21] seriously right it also came to me in
[57:24] the story of Joseph
[57:26] very very powerful story as well where
[57:29] Joseph was sold into slavery and he had
[57:33] an opportunity to say boy them Brethren
[57:35] they're just so wicked and
[57:37] evil are you going and work hard at
[57:40] all and in the house of pitifer his
[57:44] hands were blessed he was so blessed
[57:47] that he was elevated to the head of the
[57:48] home because what he did he did it with
[57:51] all his might and potifa was able to see
[57:54] the blessing of the Lord upon his life
[57:58] amen
[58:00] so I just want to close by just reading
[58:04] two more scriptures and I know that is
[58:07] very very brief right but it's supposed
[58:09] to be a taster amen so I want to go to
[58:13] Proverbs
[58:15] 20:4 now you don't need to find it but
[58:17] if they could put it up it'll be it'll
[58:19] be great Proverbs
[58:24] 20:4 and it says
[58:27] the slugged will not
[58:30] plow by reason of the
[58:33] cold therefore shall he beg in Harvest
[58:38] and have
[58:39] nothing and when I was reading this I
[58:42] begin to think about it and I and I told
[58:46] myself like
[58:47] this the sluggard refuse to plant
[58:52] because they have an excuse that's right
[58:55] whether it's cold whe whe it's hot
[58:56] whether it's rainy whether it's sunny
[58:59] they have an
[59:00] excuse and because they have an excuse
[59:03] they will depend on the persons who
[59:06] didn't have an excuse wow right and
[59:09] they'll still leave themselves
[59:10] vulnerable they will still have
[59:18] nothing and at that point I mean there's
[59:21] so many passive passive Christians out
[59:25] here at that
[59:27] point that's when that's when the old
[59:30] gospel songs really really hit
[59:33] great because you want to sing Jesus
[59:35] we're depending on
[59:38] you but you didn't
[59:41] plant that's is when The Neighbor mango
[59:44] looking real real big and juicy you want
[59:47] to help them you're saying hey that one
[59:49] right
[59:51] there if it is that the neighbor tell
[59:53] them well your Rod broken don't worry
[59:54] I'll fix your rod
[59:58] they didn't
[59:59] plant right so last
[1:00:03] scripture last scripture and it's
[1:00:08] Proverbs 24 verse
[1:00:22] 30 proverbs 24:30
[1:00:29] and in the Bible there's a lot that is
[1:00:33] said about the man that is void of
[1:00:37] understanding and we want to
[1:00:40] see what is the situation here with
[1:00:43] persons who don't understand their field
[1:00:46] of
[1:00:47] potential and God is looking for a
[1:00:50] return on his
[1:00:52] investment because you are planted here
[1:00:54] on Earth
[1:00:56] so Proverbs
[1:00:59] 24:30 it reads on this wise it says I
[1:01:02] went by the field of the
[1:01:06] slothful and by the vineyard of the man
[1:01:09] void of
[1:01:11] understanding and lo it was all grown
[1:01:14] over with
[1:01:15] thorns and Nettles had covered the face
[1:01:18] thereof and the stone wall thereof was
[1:01:21] broken
[1:01:22] down then I saw and considered it well I
[1:01:26] looked upon it and received
[1:01:32] instruction so the person who is
[1:01:36] full and void of understanding he does
[1:01:38] not understand that he has productive
[1:01:42] capabilities and profitable capabilities
[1:01:44] within his field right and that's why he
[1:01:48] could leave it and neglect it because
[1:01:50] when one Thorn comes it becomes a
[1:01:53] becomes a little issue don't worry I'll
[1:01:55] deal with that tomorrow but it begins to
[1:01:57] multiply very fast right and then you
[1:02:00] have the whole face of it that is all
[1:02:02] grown over and the fact that the wall is
[1:02:05] broken down there's no protection on
[1:02:07] that field of potential so that mean
[1:02:10] even if it is at something was to grow
[1:02:12] up through
[1:02:14] it anybody could come and rub steal
[1:02:18] destroy
[1:02:19] kill and we need to be able to protect
[1:02:23] our field of potential and make sure
[1:02:26] that it's productive and make sure that
[1:02:27] it's profitable and make sure that it's
[1:02:29] that it's generational and make sure
[1:02:31] that it's a blessing onto blessing unto
[1:02:34] people
[1:02:35] amen so I hope that that was a blessing
[1:02:39] to you and I hope that you are blessed
[1:02:41] today right I thank you for the for the
[1:02:44] opportunity to speak to you and I'm
[1:02:46] looking forward for whether young
[1:02:48] whether old that you come to the
[1:02:50] sessions for life and to Godliness it's
[1:02:52] no longer generally youth service and
[1:02:55] you could feel free to invite someone
[1:02:57] and I'm sure that they'll be very
[1:02:58] blessed
[1:03:01] [Applause]
[1:03:05] amen
[1:03:08] Al and right
[1:03:10] now in the good times and
[1:03:14] bad you are on your
[1:03:18] throne You Are God
[1:03:21] Alone singing You Are God Alone

[1:04:05] are
[1:04:08] unchangeable
[1:04:12] unshakeable
[1:04:15] unstoppable that's who you are
[1:04:18] hallelujah hallelujah God Alone amen
[1:04:23] praise the lord we appreciate what but
[1:04:25] Andrew Shar
[1:04:27] what an appetizer I don't want to miss
[1:04:29] the next session I hope all of you can
[1:04:31] make it the next time we're having it
[1:04:32] and be a blessing to you so let's bow
[1:04:34] head one more time father God we thank
[1:04:35] you for your word and we pray a bless it
[1:04:37] interpret to our hearts in Jesus name we
[1:04:39] ask it amen and amen I have a scripture
[1:04:42] I to read for you 2 Samuel CH 24:
[1:04:45] 10 to 25 and when you sit down keep your
[1:04:48] Bibles open we want to look at a context
[1:04:50] scripture of Luke 14 from verse 12 so
[1:04:54] just 2 Samuel 24 verse
[1:04:58] 10
[1:05:01] wow and David had smot him after that he
[1:05:06] numbered the
[1:05:07] people and David said unto the Lord I
[1:05:10] have sinned greatly in that I have
[1:05:14] done and now I beseech thee Oh Lord take
[1:05:17] away the iniquity of thy servant for I
[1:05:21] have done very
[1:05:23] foolishly for when David was up in the
[1:05:26] morning the word of the Lord came unto
[1:05:28] the prophet God David SE saying go and
[1:05:34] say unto
[1:05:35] David thus sayeth the Lord I offer thee
[1:05:40] treatings choose thee one of them that I
[1:05:44] may do it unto
[1:05:45] thee so God came to David and told him
[1:05:50] and said unto him shall seven years of
[1:05:53] famine come unto thee in thy land
[1:05:56] or will thou flee three months before
[1:05:58] thine enemies while they pursue thee or
[1:06:02] that there be three days pestilence in
[1:06:05] thy land now
[1:06:07] advise and see what answer I shall
[1:06:11] return to him that sent
[1:06:14] me and David said unto
[1:06:16] God I am in a great straet let us fall
[1:06:20] now into the hand of the Lord for his
[1:06:23] mercies are great and let me not fall
[1:06:26] into the hand of
[1:06:29] man so the Lord sent a pestilence upon
[1:06:35] Israel from the morning even to the time
[1:06:38] appointed and there died of the people
[1:06:41] from Dan even to BBA 70,000
[1:06:47] men and when the angel stretched out his
[1:06:50] hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it the
[1:06:53] Lord repented him of the evil and said
[1:06:55] unto the angel that destroy the people
[1:06:56] it is
[1:06:58] enough stay now thine
[1:07:00] hand and the angel of the Lord was by
[1:07:04] the treesan place of Aruna the
[1:07:08] jebusite and David spake unto the Lord
[1:07:12] when he saw the angel that smoke the
[1:07:14] people and said lo I have sinned I have
[1:07:17] done wickedly but these sheep what have
[1:07:20] they
[1:07:21] done let thine hand I pray thee be
[1:07:24] against me against against my father's
[1:07:26] house and God came that day to David
[1:07:30] said unto him go up Ray an altar unto
[1:07:34] the Lord in the thres Floor of Arona the
[1:07:38] jebusite and David according to the Sint
[1:07:41] of God went up as the Lord
[1:07:44] commanded and Arona looked and saw the
[1:07:48] king and his servants coming on towards
[1:07:51] him and Arona went out and bow himself
[1:07:54] before the king
[1:07:56] on his face and upon the
[1:07:58] ground and Arona said wherefore is my
[1:08:01] Lord the king come to his servant and
[1:08:03] David said to buy the treesan float of
[1:08:07] thee to build an altar unto the Lord
[1:08:10] that the plague may be stayed from the
[1:08:13] people and Arona said unto David let my
[1:08:17] Lord the king Take and offer up what
[1:08:19] seeth good unto him behold here be oxen
[1:08:23] for burnt sacrifice instruments other
[1:08:26] instruments of The Oxen for wood all
[1:08:29] these things did Aron as a king as a
[1:08:33] king give unto the king and Arona said
[1:08:35] unto the king the Lord thy God accept
[1:08:38] thee and the King said unto Arona n but
[1:08:42] I will surely buy it of thee at a
[1:08:44] price neither will I offer burnt
[1:08:48] offerings unto the Lord my God that
[1:08:51] which cost me
[1:08:53] nothing so David bought the trees floor
[1:08:58] and The Oxen for 50 shekels of silver
[1:09:01] and David built there an altar on the
[1:09:03] Lord and burnt offerings and peace
[1:09:06] offerings so the Lord was entreated of
[1:09:08] the land and the plague was teed from
[1:09:12] Israel may God bless his word you may be
[1:09:19] seated
[1:09:21] Hallelujah you want to know where but
[1:09:23] over that this morning
[1:09:27] the scripture from Luke 14 familiar
[1:09:29] scripture reading from verse 12 Luke
[1:09:31] chapter
[1:09:32] 14 Jesus about to speak then said he
[1:09:36] also to him that b him when thou makest
[1:09:39] a dinner or supper call not thy friends
[1:09:42] nor thy Brethren neither thy Kinsmen nor
[1:09:45] thy Rich neighbors least they also bid
[1:09:48] thee again and recompense be made you
[1:09:51] call your friends they call your rich
[1:09:52] people and then them call you back hear
[1:09:54] what he says but when th makest a feast
[1:09:58] call the poor the meme the lean the
[1:10:02] Blind and thou sht be blessed for they
[1:10:05] cannot recompense thee for thou sht be
[1:10:09] recompensed at the resurrection of the
[1:10:11] Just note how Jesus constantly reminding
[1:10:15] them of to do stuff that God recognizes
[1:10:19] and that God
[1:10:21] sees verse 15 and when one of them that
[1:10:24] sat and meet with him heard these things
[1:10:26] he said unto him blessed is he that
[1:10:28] shall eat bread in the kingdom of God
[1:10:30] and then he said unto him a certain man
[1:10:32] made a great supper and B many sent his
[1:10:36] servant at supper time to say to them
[1:10:38] that were bidden come for all things and
[1:10:41] not ready and they all with one consent
[1:10:43] begin to make excuse just like what but
[1:10:46] Andrew talk about making excuse the
[1:10:48] first said unto him I have bought a
[1:10:49] piece of ground I must needs to go and
[1:10:51] see it I pray to have me excuse another
[1:10:53] said now listen The Man by
[1:10:55] cow beef the man have rice peas macaroni
[1:11:00] pie salad the man fix up his place and
[1:11:03] invite people only hear
[1:11:08] excuses and they all with one consent
[1:11:11] begin to make excuses another said verse
[1:11:14] 19 I have bought five UK of oxen I go to
[1:11:16] prove them I pray to have me excuse
[1:11:18] another said I have married a wife
[1:11:20] therefore I cannot come so the servant
[1:11:22] came and showed his Lord these things
[1:11:23] then the master of the house being Ang
[1:11:25] angry said to his servant go out quickly
[1:11:27] into the
[1:11:28] streets and Lanes of the city and
[1:11:31] bringing hither the poor the meme the
[1:11:33] Halt and the blind yes am and the
[1:11:35] servant said Lord it is done as thou
[1:11:37] commanded and yet there is room amen
[1:11:39] amen and the Lord said unto servant go
[1:11:41] out to the highways and hedges and
[1:11:43] compel them to come in that my house may
[1:11:45] be filled for I say unto you that none
[1:11:47] of these men which were bidden shall
[1:11:50] taste of my supper and there went great
[1:11:52] multitudes with him and he turned and
[1:11:54] said to them If any man come to
[1:11:58] me and hate not his father and mother
[1:12:02] and wife and children and Brethren and
[1:12:06] sisters ye and his own life also he
[1:12:09] cannot be my
[1:12:12] disciples and whosoever do not bear his
[1:12:14] cross and come after me cannot be my
[1:12:20] disciples for which of you intended to
[1:12:23] build a tower sth not down first and
[1:12:25] counted the cost whether he have
[1:12:28] sufficient to finish it least happily
[1:12:31] after he had laid the foundation and is
[1:12:34] not able to finish it all that behold it
[1:12:36] begin to mock him saying this man begin
[1:12:40] to build and was not able to finish may
[1:12:43] God bless his
[1:12:49] word hallu to pay you have to count the
[1:12:52] cost
[1:12:55] there's a price for
[1:12:57] everything what we call free is not
[1:13:00] really
[1:13:02] free if we say after service there are
[1:13:05] meals downstairs everybody have one is
[1:13:07] free for everybody it is free to you but
[1:13:10] it cost the church or whoever putting
[1:13:11] out it cost somebody salvation is free
[1:13:14] to us but Jesus is who went to the
[1:13:17] Cross so what we think is free is not
[1:13:24] free
[1:13:26] notice the three options that David got
[1:13:29] not one of them was Spong cake with
[1:13:32] dressings in
[1:13:33] it it was dead
[1:13:36] serious so much months of famine let
[1:13:39] enemy run after you or pestilence David
[1:13:42] say better fall in the hands of God than
[1:13:43] the hands of man man's still dreader
[1:13:46] than
[1:13:47] that God send pestilence the prophet God
[1:13:51] spoke to David and said go make a
[1:13:53] sacrifice
[1:13:55] David went to pay he said come to buy it
[1:13:57] the man said no I Ox in here that
[1:14:03] free I have wood I have everything here
[1:14:07] is free you up to you I'm giving you it
[1:14:09] free David said I will not offer to
[1:14:12] God what cost me
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:19] nothing not David not David remember one
[1:14:24] time you say your to give this to God
[1:14:26] give give it to some bot thing What
[1:14:28] Remain what what you have some kind of
[1:14:31] old clothes you want to wear again you
[1:14:32] want to give some no give it to somebody
[1:14:34] don't no don't do that that's what you
[1:14:36] have to do give your best to God if
[1:14:40] you're working work with all your might
[1:14:41] and all your strength it have no reason
[1:14:44] for a Christian to be ratting on the
[1:14:48] job you should be always doing your
[1:14:51] best everything cost even Freedom
[1:14:57] cost somebody 16 they wait to reach 18
[1:14:59] like everything is a magic number when
[1:15:01] you reach that 18 like that like just
[1:15:02] magic has
[1:15:05] happen you want your freedom but Freedom
[1:15:08] have a cost it have a cost of discipline
[1:15:12] no matter young fellas when they reach
[1:15:13] 18 they find as we said already them the
[1:15:16] driver they get a w car because they get
[1:15:18] license and so happen they reach 18 and
[1:15:20] they driving to get a wer when police
[1:15:22] come all them lock up they have a 10
[1:15:23] years to make
[1:15:26] because they thought they're free they
[1:15:28] could smoke they're free I could drink
[1:15:30] you're free you could go to parties and
[1:15:32] and lime you're free but are you really
[1:15:37] free because Israel came out of Egypt
[1:15:41] but Egypt didn't come out of
[1:15:42] them after bondage for so much years
[1:15:46] those people they were so wicked they
[1:15:48] say let us get a captain to lead us back
[1:15:50] to
[1:15:53] Egypt because the cost
[1:15:56] is what he didn't want to pay the price
[1:15:58] of Deliverance The Cost of Freedom the
[1:16:01] cost of being saved and to stay
[1:16:03] Sav the cost of being delivered and you
[1:16:06] remain delivered there's a price for
[1:16:09] that because if you let unbelief come a
[1:16:12] worst thing happen the same sickness but
[1:16:14] I'm pray for people they get healed and
[1:16:15] by even time they get back sick again is
[1:16:17] because of unbelief because of their
[1:16:18] attitude he said the same you have to
[1:16:19] have faith to keep it off of
[1:16:22] you it's not to sit down and Rock back
[1:16:25] and it going just going to work out so
[1:16:27] have a title are you willing to pay the
[1:16:29] price
