[20:01] Jesus might ask it amen God bless you
[20:04] and welcome if in the Bible I'd like to
[20:07] turn to three portions of scripture ex
[20:08] Isaiah chapter 63 verse 4.
[20:12] Exodus chapter 14 verse 13 to 20 and
[20:15] Romans 8 1-2
[20:18] reading from
[20:21] Isaiah 63
[20:24] verse
[20:27] okay
[20:29] it's uh 63 verse 4.
[20:58] 63 verse 4 for the day of vengeance is
[21:01] in my heart
[21:03] on the year of my redeemed is come
[21:07] and Exodus chapter 14 verse 13 and Moses
[21:10] said unto the people fear not fear ye
[21:12] not stand still I see the salvation of
[21:15] the Lord which he will show you today
[21:17] for Egyptians whom you have seen today
[21:19] you shall see them again no more forever
[21:22] the Lord shall fight for you he shall
[21:24] hold your peace
[21:26] and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore
[21:29] Christ down unto me speak under the
[21:32] general Israel that they go forward but
[21:34] lift up thou thy bread and turtle thy
[21:37] hand over the sea and divided and
[21:40] eternal Israel shall go on dry ground to
[21:42] the midst of the sea and I behold I will
[21:45] harden the hearts of the Egyptians and
[21:48] they shall follow them and I will get me
[21:51] on upon pharaoh and upon all his hosts
[21:53] upon his chariots upon his Horsemen and
[21:56] the Egyptians shall know that I am the
[21:59] Lord when I have cut me honor upon
[22:01] Pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his
[22:03] Horsemen and the angel of God which went
[22:06] before the camp of Israel removed and
[22:09] went behind them and the pillar of cloud
[22:11] went from before their face and stood
[22:13] behind them and it came between the camp
[22:16] of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel
[22:18] it was a cloud on Darkness to them but
[22:21] it gave light by night to these so that
[22:23] the one came not near the other all the
[22:26] night Allah scripture from Romans
[22:28] chapter 8 verse 1 and 2.
[22:34] there's definitely no no condemnation to
[22:36] them which in Christ Jesus who worked
[22:38] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[22:40] for the law of the spirit of life in
[22:43] Christ Jesus had made me free from the
[22:45] law of sin and death may God bless us
[22:47] what you may be seated praise God thanks
[22:49] so much for being here this evening
[22:50] praise God's have a title the day of
[22:53] vengeance is in my heart and the year of
[22:55] my redeemed is come
[22:57] and have an inspiration Redemption by
[22:59] power
[23:01] okay so it's very interesting how Isaiah
[23:05] capture all these things about the day
[23:07] of vengeance and description now
[23:10] identify not only vengeance is in his
[23:12] heart God but that the year already my
[23:15] redeemed has come
[23:17] so God has designed a particular time
[23:19] and season for his redeemed his people
[23:23] that he called to bring to Redemption
[23:25] now we're not talking about salvation no
[23:27] we're talking about Redemption a
[23:29] Redemption means Faith virtue all these
[23:31] virtues coming into you that is when
[23:33] you're fully redeemed redeem is to bring
[23:35] it back where I was before and before we
[23:38] fell and God wanted being a restoration
[23:40] because we as man was back there in
[23:43] represented by Adam so God has to bring
[23:46] us back that complete Redemption our
[23:48] Redemption is in two parts Redemption is
[23:50] by Blood and also by power Redemption is
[23:53] also coming in and going out coming
[23:54] going out
[23:56] um Redemption of two parts it's out of
[23:59] and going into now many of you like just
[24:03] a matter of the scripture you talk about
[24:04] Ephesians and Redemption as two
[24:07] different parts coming out of and
[24:10] entering into first you have to come up
[24:12] some people want to bring the world in
[24:13] with them but you got to come out of the
[24:15] world to enter into Christ you have to
[24:18] come out of unbelief to enter into fate
[24:19] they cannot be wanting in your way to
[24:22] really have genuine Faith you must
[24:24] absolutely leave everything that is
[24:27] contrary to the word of God so you come
[24:29] like a clinging to the word of God not
[24:31] even your feelings not even your
[24:32] emotions not even your past you're
[24:34] clinging to God's word there are some
[24:36] people still stuck in a rut by their
[24:38] history by their environment by their
[24:40] home by what happened to them when there
[24:42] was a child and you're still wallowing
[24:45] inside the deer you have to kick all
[24:46] them things away and say God your word
[24:48] is true you can't lie I've been through
[24:49] them things but that can't bring me to
[24:51] where I'm supposed to be no the only way
[24:52] I can activate what God wants for me now
[24:54] is to receive his word and this is a
[24:57] trust will help you today what about a
[24:59] reader he said we cannot base salvation
[25:02] upon prayer
[25:05] as good as it may be we cannot base
[25:08] salvation on prayer for if that be so
[25:11] the Muhammad the muhammadins are saved
[25:14] the Buddhists are saved the hidden are
[25:16] saved so it cannot be based on prayer
[25:18] neither can it be based upon experience
[25:21] salvation is not based on experience
[25:24] because people can have any kind of
[25:26] experience the muhammadans have
[25:27] experiences the Buddhists have an
[25:29] experience every different religion have
[25:31] experiences and neither can salvation be
[25:34] based upon fasting
[25:35] prayer experiences sensation or
[25:39] sincerity many people say well it
[25:42] doesn't make a difference just what I
[25:43] believe as long as I'm sincere in what I
[25:45] believe well if that be so the
[25:47] is saved the Buddhist is
[25:50] saved all the rest of them the heedness
[25:52] saved for I say that they can outshine
[25:54] us any day when they come to prayer and
[25:55] fasting Sensations and so forth they
[25:58] cannot shine us and salvation doesn't
[26:00] pertain or is not based upon the other
[26:02] things but the word of God
[26:03] God said so salvation is strictly upon
[26:06] God said so God said so feeling on her
[26:10] feeling prayer or no prayer whatever is
[26:13] God has done it it's nothing you could
[26:15] have done salvation is a rook wrought by
[26:17] God could we give God some prisons
[26:19] hallelujah salvation can be based upon
[26:22] any church any Creed nothing but the
[26:25] word of God it is God's word God's word
[26:27] is so perfect not one iota it ever will
[26:30] fail all heaven will fail Earth will
[26:32] fail praise God John said I saw a new
[26:35] Heaven and a new Earth I want you to
[26:37] notice in technique how infallible the
[26:39] word of God is when the two T's and
[26:42] Jesus was dying on the crosses together
[26:44] they took Hammers and broke the teeth
[26:46] leg perhaps maybe the man who had the
[26:48] hammer had already drawn back the hammer
[26:51] to break the legs of the Lord Jesus so
[26:53] that they could get away over the
[26:54] Sabbath but before the hammer could ever
[26:56] strike the legs of the Lord Jesus his
[26:58] word must be fulfilled there wasn't a
[27:01] bone in his body to be broken because
[27:03] the Bible said that one bone could be
[27:06] broken because the law is when they when
[27:08] they kill you and crucify you they break
[27:09] your bones but the word say not one of
[27:11] his bones will be broken isn't that
[27:13] right Hallelujah before the hammer could
[27:16] strike his legs a Roman spear hit his
[27:18] body hit his side and blood and water
[27:20] came forth they pierced my hands and my
[27:23] side all the word of God has got to be
[27:25] fulfilled every word so the reason I
[27:28] like to get people I know I'm going to
[27:30] have to answer before in the day of
[27:32] judgment based not upon my own thoughts
[27:34] based upon my own Doctrine I want their
[27:37] soul experience based on the word of God
[27:40] so it will stand because I knowing that
[27:42] great day we're gonna have to answer for
[27:44] everything so our hope is built on
[27:46] nothing less but Jesus Christ and his
[27:48] righteousness I dare not trust in a
[27:51] sweetest frame but I holy lean on Jesus
[27:53] name Oh Glory to God be arrested on that
[27:56] Solid Rock word no devil could move them
[27:58] from there he said Upon This Rock I will
[28:01] build my church and the gates of hell
[28:03] can never Prevail against it so once God
[28:05] puts you on a rock of Revelation there
[28:08] is enough devils in hell to shake you
[28:10] over that no trial no testing no
[28:12] pandemic praise God hallelujah nothing
[28:15] present nothing to come to separate you
[28:17] from the love of God in Christ Jesus
[28:19] hallelujah praise God bring it on devil
[28:22] Oh Glory to God hallelujah Bring It On
[28:27] God said so Upon This Rock I'll build my
[28:30] church and the case of heaven will never
[28:33] be real against it Oh Glory to God
[28:36] hallelujah praise God praise God God
[28:39] can't give you power until you are
[28:41] tested Give the Lord a shout on that I
[28:44] want to say it again God cannot give you
[28:46] a power until you are tested so when
[28:49] Jesus got the Holy Ghost he went to the
[28:51] Wilderness to be tested by that devil
[28:54] but when he came to the test it is
[28:56] written it is written it is also written
[28:59] when he came to the test he returned in
[29:01] the power of the spirit will give the
[29:04] Lord a shout that's how Jesus did it he
[29:06] returned in the power of the spirit oh
[29:09] give the Lord a shout hallelujah please
[29:11] tell inspired we're still anointed
[29:14] Hallelujah
[29:15] glory to God you may be seated but
[29:18] before Jesus could start his ministry
[29:21] before Jesus will get them Motors
[29:23] humming he had to go into the temple to
[29:25] find a place where it is written the
[29:28] spirit is now upon me they thought he
[29:31] was reading scripture that day but it
[29:33] was literally happening to him he had
[29:35] the spirit upon him they couldn't see it
[29:37] they couldn't touch it they couldn't
[29:39] feel it they didn't know it but it was
[29:41] there anyhow and one of these days that
[29:43] same Spirit oh God the world can't see
[29:45] it but people can't see it but are gonna
[29:47] be upon you oh Hallelujah the spirit of
[29:50] God is upon me because he had anointed
[29:53] me you have to be anointed for purpose
[29:54] you have to be at whatever power you
[29:56] have to be placed for power or glory to
[29:59] God but you have to find the scripture
[30:00] to declare the acceptable year of the
[30:03] Lord all glory to God unto the Heavenly
[30:06] of Vengeance and today we have two packs
[30:09] of Glory to God tendencies in my heart
[30:11] but I hear the redeem Has Come Oh Glory
[30:14] that God
[30:24] for Glory to God

[59:34] came into the restaurant
[59:35] is something we talk about so many times
[59:37] over the years
[59:38] I'll begin to condemn a lady who was
[59:40] there
[59:41] who works with some men drinking and
[59:43] carrying on he said I study I thought oh
[59:46] God how can you style it how can you
[59:48] look at such a stat when even in my
[59:51] heart I'm as bad as I am yet I won't let
[59:54] my little serum Rebecca will have to
[59:56] raise up in such a generation to see the
[59:58] coming Lord why won't you do it Lord why
[1:00:00] don't you just wipe it off the face of
[1:00:01] this it
[1:00:02] I sat down there started to weep
[1:00:06] I saw a vision
[1:00:08] I saw as it was the world whirling
[1:00:10] around the air
[1:00:12] undested a rainbow around the world
[1:00:14] and someone was speaking to me said
[1:00:16] that's the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:00:18] around this world
[1:00:19] that keeps him from destroying it
[1:00:22] if God can see sin the day you eat there
[1:00:24] of that day you die
[1:00:26] every man under the blood there's a free
[1:00:28] moral agent to make your choice but if
[1:00:30] you ever die your soul soil is beyond
[1:00:32] the mercy of that blood you're already
[1:00:33] judged before you get there
[1:00:35] there's nothing left for you
[1:00:37] then I see myself
[1:00:39] I see my Lord Jesus standing there with
[1:00:40] a crown of thorns on his head the tears
[1:00:42] running down mix up with blood as it
[1:00:44] washed off his beard I see my sins
[1:00:46] coming before him
[1:00:48] and every time they would come before
[1:00:50] him still he was shaking the Thorns with
[1:00:54] sticking his voice more
[1:00:55] he would stagger back
[1:00:57] so he's describing as if the sins his
[1:01:00] sins hitting Jesus and as it hit him the
[1:01:02] Thorns just
[1:01:04] just penetrate more
[1:01:08] he said father forgive him he know not
[1:01:11] what he's doing
[1:01:12] and again I would do something then his
[1:01:14] blood was like a bump on a car
[1:01:16] protecting the car shivering me from the
[1:01:18] wrath of God on this event
[1:01:20] I come to him slowly not down to him I
[1:01:22] looked down lean in front of me there
[1:01:24] was an old book of sin and my name wrote
[1:01:27] across the top
[1:01:28] I said Lord will you forgive me
[1:01:30] certainly he said with loving eyes
[1:01:32] reached his side got some blood out and
[1:01:35] wrote in it pardon
[1:01:37] included back in the sea of
[1:01:39] forgetfulness
[1:01:40] I said Thank You Lord
[1:01:43] listen to these words now he said no I
[1:01:45] forgive you
[1:01:47] and you are condemning her
[1:01:51] he said that changed the picture for me
[1:01:54] I come out of it
[1:01:56] I walk over there and sat down to her I
[1:01:59] began to talk she's had some rough life
[1:02:02] back before her I said was you never a
[1:02:04] Christian she said I was raising a
[1:02:06] Christian home I said what happened
[1:02:08] she told me about the mystery with the
[1:02:10] husband and how the children and so
[1:02:12] forth and all these years you'll never
[1:02:13] live a peaceful since you met God she
[1:02:15] said say that's the truth I said won't
[1:02:17] you receive him right now
[1:02:19] she said will he hear me I said he's
[1:02:21] knocking at your heart now
[1:02:23] and out of that put deer on the floor
[1:02:26] knelt down before the audience of people
[1:02:29] slot machine stopped vulgar cursing
[1:02:32] stopped and everything else I lifted up
[1:02:34] my hands and then poor wrinkled hands
[1:02:37] led her to Jesus Christ friends
[1:02:39] I don't care what you have done how
[1:02:42] black your sins are how smart your life
[1:02:45] is God Is Standing tonight knocking at
[1:02:50] your heart's door to forgive you no
[1:02:52] matter who you are
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:03] that's it that's it
[1:03:05] in the Old Testament if a man lost his
[1:03:07] inheritance and squatter come on his
[1:03:09] land he could not hold it any longer
[1:03:11] from the owner until 50 years and after
[1:03:15] 50 years the tree of Jubilee came by and
[1:03:19] the Year of Jubilee is when the Year of
[1:03:20] Jubilee come along everything went back
[1:03:23] to the original beginning again all
[1:03:26] slaves they went back if a man was
[1:03:29] holding in the field and the trumpet
[1:03:31] song that he heard it he chewed on his
[1:03:32] whole I'm no more a slave I can go back
[1:03:35] to my home and family everything was
[1:03:38] given back if my squatter was on the
[1:03:40] ground he had to get off the ground you
[1:03:42] have to go off the ground because the
[1:03:44] legal owner was coming back and
[1:03:46] Hallelujah one of these days the kingdom
[1:03:48] of this world will fall and the legal
[1:03:51] owners will come back one of these days
[1:03:53] Glory they're going to win Christ went
[1:03:55] to Calvary there was 40 days into the
[1:03:58] Ascension it was a debate whether
[1:04:00] Satan's group could take it and say he
[1:04:02] did not raise from the dead they begin
[1:04:04] to start a proclamation it's his
[1:04:06] disciples stolen from the night his
[1:04:08] people come and stole him but on the
[1:04:10] 50th day was the day of Pentecost and
[1:04:13] the legal owner come down from among
[1:04:16] them and sure it was no organization it
[1:04:19] was a feeling of the Holy Ghost that was
[1:04:21] God's anus
[1:04:23] for his church to be controlled not by
[1:04:26] organization and so forth oh give the
[1:04:28] Lord some Praises at the end of the 50th
[1:04:31] day there was no more dispute Oh Glory
[1:04:34] to God instead to go with the old
[1:04:36] Orthodox difficult church God sent the
[1:04:39] Holy Ghost back and run all the
[1:04:42] squatters out all them no praise demons
[1:04:44] gets run out all them dead certain
[1:04:47] church members get run out and only
[1:04:50] church and fire isn't that right it's
[1:04:52] the power the Holy Ghost had come down
[1:04:54] no Brethren not to hurt their feelings
[1:04:57] he said the earnest of our Salvation is
[1:05:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:05:02] any organization and I'm gonna close
[1:05:05] with this oh my Hallelujah the 50th year
[1:05:08] was the day of Jubilee and the power of
[1:05:11] God was taken back to his original the
[1:05:12] 50th day the Year of Jubilee is when all
[1:05:14] things went back and there will come
[1:05:18] another year of Jubilee or give the Lord

[1:15:37] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:15:41] by the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:15:44] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:15:48] and when he had given thanks broke it
[1:15:50] and said take eat
[1:15:53] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:15:57] this do in remembrance of me was 25.

[1:16:21] death till he comes
[1:16:24] wherefore whosoever shall eat his bread
[1:16:26] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:16:28] unworthily
[1:16:29] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:16:32] the Lord
