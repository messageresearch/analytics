[45:49] i certainly want to salute our pastor
[45:51] but ovid
[45:52] and certainly want to thank
[45:54] uh him for the opportunity to speak to
[45:56] the church this morning
[45:58] so reading from second corinthians
[46:01] uh chapter five
[46:03] and reading from revelation 21
[46:06] this morning
[46:08] second corinthians 5
[46:11] and reading just one verse 17
[46:15] and therefore if any man be in christ
[46:19] he is a new creature
[46:22] all things are passed away behold
[46:25] all things are become new
[46:28] i want to read it one more time
[46:30] therefore if any man be in christ
[46:33] he is a new creature
[46:36] all things are passed away behold all
[46:39] things all things not some things but
[46:42] all things
[46:43] are become new
[46:45] and reading from the book of revelation
[46:46] 21
[46:48] a reading from verse one
[46:50] revelation 21
[46:52] reading from verse one
[46:54] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[46:57] for the first heaven and the first earth
[46:59] were passed away
[47:00] and there was no more sea
[47:03] and i john saw the holy city knew
[47:05] jerusalem coming down from god out of
[47:07] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[47:11] her husband
[47:13] so not only did john see
[47:15] the holy city the new jerusalem coming
[47:17] down
[47:18] from god out of heaven but he saw how it
[47:21] was prepared
[47:23] not just how it was prepared but the way
[47:25] it was prepared
[47:27] john describes it as prepared as a bride
[47:29] adorned for her husband in other words
[47:31] very precise very careful
[47:35] very intentional preparation
[47:38] verse 3 and i heard a great voice out of
[47:40] heaven saying behold the tabernacle of
[47:42] god is with men and he will dwell with
[47:45] them and they shall be his people and
[47:47] god himself shall be with them and be
[47:49] their god
[47:51] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[47:53] the eyes and there shall be no more
[47:55] death
[47:56] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[47:59] there be any more pain for the former
[48:02] things are passed away
[48:04] and he that sat upon the throne said
[48:06] behold i
[48:08] make all things new and he said unto
[48:10] them right for these words are true and
[48:13] faithful in other words make sure and
[48:15] take note of this
[48:16] you could rest your faith on this you
[48:18] could rest your hope on this for these
[48:21] words are true and faithful and he said
[48:24] unto me it is done i am alpha and omega
[48:27] the beginning and the end i will give
[48:29] unto him that is a fist of the fountain
[48:32] of the water of life freely he that
[48:34] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[48:37] i will be his god and he shall be my son
[48:40] may the lord add a blessing to the
[48:41] reading of his word
[48:42] you may be seated this morning in the
[48:45] presence of the lord wherever you are
[48:46] this morning i don't think we'll ever
[48:48] get used to preaching to empty benches
[48:50] but i believe in my heart that we are
[48:52] connected by that invisible bond
[48:56] that bond from our invisible father our
[48:58] heavenly father and we are connected in
[49:00] fate and connected around the promised
[49:02] word of god this morning
[49:05] so i have a title this morning behold i
[49:08] make all things new behold i make all
[49:12] things new and for a subject the journey
[49:15] of the overcomers and an inspiration he
[49:18] that overcometh shall inherit
[49:20] all things so we're under expectation
[49:23] this morning
[49:24] for the time that we are here to hear a
[49:26] word from the lord and that we can kind
[49:28] of grow in the presence of the lord and
[49:30] in the spirit of the lord and i'm on the
[49:32] expectation friends for a new thing for
[49:34] a new walk for new talk for a new place
[49:38] for a new experience as that song we
[49:40] heard said i want more i'm not satisfied
[49:44] with what i have seen i'm not satisfied
[49:46] with just my experience i'm not
[49:48] satisfied with where i'm at i want more
[49:51] and this promise is scripture we read
[49:53] and we just read speaks of a new thing a
[49:56] new experience can the church say amen
[49:58] so just to lay an introduction before i
[50:01] get into the message from the message as
[50:03] i was with moses
[50:04] with iran i'm in the early part of his
[50:06] ministry he was speaking here he said
[50:09] i've kind of got to a place where i want
[50:11] to get more boldness is there anybody
[50:14] who feels that way this morning they
[50:15] want to get more boldness we see all
[50:18] these things happening around us but we
[50:20] need to get not less boldness we need
[50:22] not to get more fear we need to get more
[50:24] boldness but ibrahim said i want to take
[50:26] the initiative side regardless of
[50:29] whether it's under the discernment so
[50:31] whether manhattan himself was going
[50:33] through uh discovery of his ministry and
[50:37] a discovery of what the scripture said
[50:39] he said regardless of whether it's under
[50:41] discernment i want to go forward and
[50:43] challenge the enemy is that anybody who
[50:45] feels that way this morning you want to
[50:47] go out and challenge the enemy in a bold
[50:50] and he goes on i'm more like a timid
[50:52] sort of person and i only try to work as
[50:55] i see the spirit of god working and then
[50:58] i speak he said but that's not exactly a
[51:00] fate in other words he said i've been
[51:02] waiting to see and then act he said but
[51:04] that's not exactly a fate that's seeing
[51:06] exactly what's going to happen before
[51:08] you say it i want to step out and fear
[51:10] tonight so but abraham was going through
[51:13] something he said i've been waiting and
[51:14] i've been watching and i wait but
[51:15] tonight i want to step out on fate and i
[51:17] want to come out when something new that
[51:20] i haven't done before take the other
[51:22] side and say satan jesus christ sent me
[51:25] to do this and you have got to leave the
[51:27] people and just make a bold command
[51:30] without even seeing anything believing
[51:32] it with all of my heart and i believe
[51:34] god will confirm it with great signs and
[51:37] wonders and i'm putting it to the test
[51:39] tonight it's a new place so i want to
[51:42] challenge you where you are this morning
[51:44] this evening wherever you are to put god
[51:46] to the test today it's a new place put
[51:49] god and his word to the test oh
[51:52] hallelujah you don't need to wait for a
[51:53] sign you could have fear this morning
[51:56] for your healing you could have faith
[51:57] this morning for a breakthrough you
[51:59] could have faith this morning for a
[52:01] revival you could have faith this
[52:02] morning for your children you could have
[52:04] fear this morning for an old-fashioned
[52:07] sin killing sky blue holy ghost revival
[52:11] you don't need nobody to be around you
[52:13] to have a revival you don't wait for
[52:15] these men to have a revival you could
[52:17] have it today you could have it in your
[52:19] home you could welcome the presence of
[52:21] the lord can the church say amen
[52:24] doing something new going where you have
[52:26] not gone before challenging yourself to
[52:29] press and worship and trust god more
[52:32] than you ever did before can we set a
[52:34] new record today to do what we have
[52:36] never done before that's what brother
[52:38] branham was entering into he was
[52:40] entering into a place he had never gone
[52:43] before he was entering into a fate that
[52:46] he never went before and that could only
[52:49] come when you go through a
[52:50] transformation of your mind and a
[52:52] transformation of your soul to realize
[52:54] that we want more and we cannot be
[52:56] satisfied with just a formal religion
[52:59] cannot be satisfied with just a lukewarm
[53:02] hallelujah i'm in the message kind of
[53:05] service but the promises of god that are
[53:08] real to us today and the promise of the
[53:10] holy ghost just as real as it was on the
[53:13] day of pentecost
[53:14] can the church say amen
[53:17] hallelujah
[53:18] you know anybody who knows me knows i'm
[53:20] not much into sports
[53:23] that has been never my ministry never my
[53:25] portion
[53:27] when i was very young i tried and it
[53:28] didn't quite work out
[53:30] but one thing i admire about the
[53:32] sporting arena is the olympics
[53:35] every four years or so they would come
[53:38] together
[53:39] and for some reason it doesn't matter
[53:42] and since the time they started it to
[53:44] now there's always a record that's being
[53:46] broken
[53:47] there has never been an olympics where a
[53:50] new record was made was not made
[53:53] every single olympics whether it is in
[53:55] cycling or it's in running or it's in
[53:57] whatever it is every single time man
[54:00] with the ability of man come together
[54:02] and they break out they break a record
[54:05] hallelujah man makes up his mind that
[54:08] i'm gonna push more than i did the last
[54:10] time
[54:11] man picks up his mind that i know
[54:13] somebody else may have had the record
[54:15] before but this time i'm going for
[54:17] something greater i'm going for
[54:19] something more powerful and i feel that
[54:21] we are at the time now that the bride of
[54:23] jesus christ has to break a record do
[54:26] you know the bible has been about
[54:27] breaking records oh hallelujah
[54:30] hallelujah every prophet every apostle
[54:33] every king every son of god was
[54:36] challenging a record that was set before
[54:39] them hallelujah and that's when when
[54:41] jesus came he came to break every record
[54:44] he took five loaves and two fishes and
[54:46] fed five thousand and broke a record
[54:49] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[54:52] lord and that's how god is he said the
[54:54] same works that i do you are going to do
[54:56] also and greater in other words you got
[54:58] to break some records i believe we are
[55:00] come together as a church we might be
[55:03] virtuous we might be in our homes but we
[55:05] could break a record for having a
[55:07] revival that could start in our homes oh
[55:10] hallelujah starting our lives blessed be
[55:13] the name of the lord somebody give god a
[55:16] shout out praise
[55:17] breaking limitations doing what has not
[55:20] been done before accessing the unlimited
[55:23] resources of god do you know the
[55:25] resources of god are unlimited there's
[55:27] no limit to the resources of god when
[55:30] last have you made a withdrawal
[55:32] from the unlimited resources of god when
[55:34] last have you made a withdrawal from the
[55:36] unlimited resources of god
[55:40] blessed be the name of the lord
[55:42] oh just lay in the background

[56:11] your eyes this morning to see that we
[56:13] are more than able we are more than

[56:59] rapture can the church say amen
[57:03] blessed be the name of the lord
[57:07] hallelujah hallelujah keep those mothers
[57:10] coming
[57:11] oh let's create some tectonic movement
[57:13] this morning in the message christ has
[57:15] revealed in his own word still in the
[57:17] background
[57:18] but abraham said listen to this
[57:22] if einstein had only the spiritual
[57:25] application
[57:27] as he had the physical application
[57:29] so listen so god through the prophet was
[57:32] seeing what einstein had done
[57:34] and said einstein tapped into something
[57:37] in that realm of the physical
[57:38] application that's scientific
[57:40] application and brother branham said if
[57:42] einstein had only the spiritual
[57:44] application as he had the physical
[57:46] application as he studied the laws of
[57:49] light and so forth he could have told us
[57:51] something so bernie bannon
[57:56] when i heard his message speaking about
[57:58] einstein message of that great center
[58:01] somewhere into the skies
[58:04] that an einstein said this he said if
[58:06] anybody ever contracted with that great
[58:08] center you could create it
[58:11] do anything and the power would be
[58:13] unlimited see but a man i'm speaking a
[58:15] mother so you say einstein without a
[58:17] revelation and a spiritual understanding
[58:20] new that somewhere out there was a great
[58:23] center
[58:25] and if you could just get into contact
[58:27] with that great center then you could
[58:29] create it you could do anything didn't
[58:32] the prophet say when them someone turned
[58:33] us out of their voices to that group who
[58:36] could take the word and hand it there to
[58:38] slice and cut they could say what they
[58:40] want and what they speak would have to
[58:41] come to pass
[58:43] oh hallelujah what is it in contact with
[58:46] that great center and i'm looking for a
[58:48] people this morning some mama somewhere
[58:51] some father somewhere some young brother
[58:53] somewhere somebody around the world who
[58:56] will get in contact with that great
[58:57] center
[58:58] oh where unlimited resources of god
[59:02] could be on display oh to shake this
[59:04] world
[59:06] to shake this world are we in can the
[59:08] church say amen
[59:09] oh are you in revival
[59:12] oh i'm in revival this morning
[59:15] let's go on still in the background from
[59:18] the message jehovah jireh
[59:20] brother bannon said but mary
[59:23] when the angel met her
[59:25] she didn't doubt god
[59:27] she said behold the handmaid of the lord
[59:30] be it unto me according to thy word
[59:33] then and never was there anything like
[59:35] that before
[59:36] but she didn't question she didn't
[59:39] reason she just took god at his word and
[59:41] went along rejoicing telling people she
[59:44] was going to have a baby
[59:46] knowing no man
[59:47] when that had never been done before
[59:50] oh wouldn't it be fine if all these
[59:53] mary's in here
[59:54] or these marys connected this morning
[59:57] would take that kind of attitude
[59:59] wouldn't it be wonderful if all the
[1:00:02] people could take that attitude don't
[1:00:04] question if god said so that settles it
[1:00:07] that's all that settles it now he is the
[1:00:10] final voice all authority
[1:00:12] hallelujah then abraham believed him and
[1:00:15] when he did abraham hadn't questioned
[1:00:17] but god said i'm going to tell you
[1:00:19] how it's done abraham i'm the bosom one
[1:00:22] i am your mother in other words you're
[1:00:24] just a baby to me you're 100 years old
[1:00:26] but you're just a baby and the natural
[1:00:29] stream of life has passed from you
[1:00:32] but i am your life giver i am your
[1:00:34] mother now don't dis that's nurse from
[1:00:36] me and you'll have your string like a
[1:00:38] young man we're gonna get into that in a
[1:00:40] minute he said i could heal your body
[1:00:42] and make you a different person while
[1:00:44] you are here on earth
[1:00:46] oh hallelujah i can prolong your days i
[1:00:49] want you to take that to heart this
[1:00:51] morning i can give you good health
[1:00:53] that's your promise all these negative
[1:00:55] thoughts i can give you good health i
[1:00:57] can do that because i am the breasted
[1:00:59] one oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:01:03] oh hallelujah
[1:01:06] last quote for the background
[1:01:08] but iran i'm in a message of hidden
[1:01:10] light and but overhead read this
[1:01:12] a few weeks ago
[1:01:14] i've noticed among oppression that many
[1:01:16] of you
[1:01:17] as coming into you as full gospel people
[1:01:19] coming from the baptist church myself
[1:01:22] and accepting the doctrine
[1:01:24] of the baptism of the holy spirit being
[1:01:26] a separate work of the holy spirit
[1:01:29] and when martin luther reached
[1:01:31] justification by faith he thought that
[1:01:33] settled it so brethren brother brown was
[1:01:35] addressing this comfort that exists that
[1:01:37] people reach and they feel they have
[1:01:39] arrived somewhere he said when martin
[1:01:41] luther reached justification by faith he
[1:01:43] thought that settled it oh so we are
[1:01:46] coming against that spirit of being
[1:01:48] satisfied and being comfortable he said
[1:01:50] that was the light of his day and he
[1:01:52] preached it and he believed it and held
[1:01:54] on to it and it was the light of that
[1:01:56] day then he entered into another veil a
[1:01:58] man john wesley
[1:02:00] hallelujah got raised up john wesley and
[1:02:03] he smashed calvinism to the ground to
[1:02:05] the place where it ought to have its
[1:02:07] right balance

[1:03:30] welcome mat i'm reading let's move on up
[1:03:33] into deeper depths and never colonize
[1:03:36] ourselves to organize ourselves and to
[1:03:39] get into a place where there is we
[1:03:41] believe this and that's all let's
[1:03:43] believe this plus how much more we could
[1:03:46] hear from god that's what we're looking
[1:03:48] for this morning we believe this plus
[1:03:51] how much more we could hear from god and
[1:03:53] god could use anybody if your heart is
[1:03:56] open this morning to receive from god
[1:03:59] you can get a word from the lord this
[1:04:01] morning
[1:04:02] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:04:06] everybody feeling fine
[1:04:08] so we building so just to get into
[1:04:11] the thought a bit this morning
[1:04:14] and in our bible study
[1:04:15] there's a kind of theme that we're on to
[1:04:17] now
[1:04:18] we read it in colossians 3
[1:04:20] and i'll just read just the first three
[1:04:22] verses to connect to this colossians 3
[1:04:24] verse 1
[1:04:26] paul is speaking to that church
[1:04:29] the colossian church and he said if you
[1:04:31] even be risen with christ so he's not
[1:04:33] speaking to strangers he's not speaking
[1:04:35] to visitors he's not speaking to people
[1:04:38] who didn't know what he was talking
[1:04:39] about he said if ye then be risen with
[1:04:42] christ in other words you have a
[1:04:43] relationship with god if he then be
[1:04:46] risen with christ you have had an
[1:04:47] experience with god the call of god has
[1:04:50] been upon your life you understand that
[1:04:52] this is the resurrection gospel it's a
[1:04:54] gospel to move from death to life if ye
[1:04:58] then be risen with christ seek those
[1:05:00] things which are above
[1:05:02] where christ sit on the right hand of
[1:05:04] god set your affection on things above
[1:05:08] not on the things on the earth for ye
[1:05:11] are dead and your life is hid with
[1:05:14] christ in god can the church say amen
[1:05:18] and then we now read the scripture this
[1:05:21] morning now
[1:05:22] this message today
[1:05:24] about being in christ
[1:05:26] and we read the scripture
[1:05:28] second corinthians 5 17
[1:05:31] therefore if any man be
[1:05:34] in christ
[1:05:35] he is a new creature
[1:05:37] all things are passed away behold behold
[1:05:41] all things become new
[1:05:43] can the church say amen
[1:05:45] if any man be in christ so this message
[1:05:49] today is to those who are in christ
[1:05:52] hallelujah not those who are in the
[1:05:55] message
[1:05:56] not those who are in church
[1:05:58] not those who are in an inspiration
[1:06:01] one inspiration or the other it is for
[1:06:03] those who are in christ
[1:06:05] it's not to those who are in a doctrine
[1:06:08] or to those who are in a belief
[1:06:10] or to those that are in a system this
[1:06:13] message is to those who are in christ in
[1:06:16] other words being in christ is a
[1:06:18] prerequisite or the foundation for where
[1:06:21] we're going next can the church say amen
[1:06:24] and it says if any man be in christ so
[1:06:27] it's not up to me or you to judge who
[1:06:29] the man is if any man gets into christ
[1:06:32] he hallelujah is a new creature this has
[1:06:35] nothing to do about group has nothing to
[1:06:37] do with association has something to do
[1:06:39] with belief it is just getting into
[1:06:42] christ he is a new creation all things
[1:06:45] are passed away old habits are passed
[1:06:47] away all behaviors are passed away all
[1:06:51] problems are passed away all situations
[1:06:54] are passed away and all things every
[1:06:56] service becoming new hallelujah every
[1:06:59] week you're seeing a new thing
[1:07:01] hallelujah because your eyes are being
[1:07:04] changed your heart is being changed your
[1:07:06] desires being changed because you are in
[1:07:09] christ you're not caught up in yourself
[1:07:12] you're not caught up in your emotions
[1:07:14] you're not caught up in your ambitions
[1:07:16] you're not caught up in your desires you
[1:07:18] are in christ
[1:07:23] from the message
[1:07:24] and exposition of the seven church ages
[1:07:26] the laotian church age
[1:07:28] but the random said but now
[1:07:30] speaking about jesus
[1:07:32] he is standing in the midst of the
[1:07:34] church
[1:07:36] hallelujah as he stands there revealing
[1:07:39] who he is in this last age he calls
[1:07:42] himself the author
[1:07:44] of the creation of god
[1:07:46] hallelujah so jesus is the author of
[1:07:48] creation of god brother branham said
[1:07:50] this is another creation
[1:07:53] this that he is referring to has to do
[1:07:56] with the church i'm reading
[1:07:58] this is a special designation of himself
[1:08:01] he is the creator of that church so this
[1:08:04] church that we are talking about and
[1:08:06] this new creation we are talking about
[1:08:09] and the relationship with the author of
[1:08:11] the creation of god has nothing to do
[1:08:13] with the work of man
[1:08:14] hallelujah suffering god dealing with
[1:08:17] individuals and bringing them into a new
[1:08:20] creation his creation and he's singular
[1:08:23] is the author of creation the author of
[1:08:27] the creation of god can the church say
[1:08:29] amen
[1:08:31] the heavenly bridegroom
[1:08:34] created his own bride
[1:08:36] oh my so it was not a happenstance it's
[1:08:39] not it's not a watching you and you turn
[1:08:41] into this and this is how and this is
[1:08:43] why i know he is creating
[1:08:45] his own bride he is very much involved
[1:08:49] in the process of bride shaping of bride
[1:08:52] honing of bright perfection of bright
[1:08:55] mentoring of bride coaching a bright
[1:08:58] scolding of getting her into position
[1:09:02] the heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:09:05] bride
[1:09:06] as the spirit of god listen to the
[1:09:08] prophet he came down and created in the
[1:09:11] virgin mary the cells from which his
[1:09:13] body was born
[1:09:15] but ibrahim said i want to repeat that
[1:09:17] he
[1:09:18] created the very cells in the womb of
[1:09:21] mary for that body
[1:09:23] it was not enough for the holy spirit to
[1:09:26] simply give life to a human ovum
[1:09:29] supplied by mary
[1:09:31] that would have been sinful mankind
[1:09:33] producing a body
[1:09:35] that would not have produced the last
[1:09:37] adam of him it was said lo a body has
[1:09:41] thou father prepared for me god not mary
[1:09:44] provided that body
[1:09:46] mary was the human incubator and she
[1:09:49] carried that holy child and brought him
[1:09:52] to earth
[1:09:53] brought him to birth it was a god man he
[1:09:56] was the son of god he was of the new
[1:09:59] creation man and god met and joined he
[1:10:03] hallelujah was the first of this new
[1:10:06] race
[1:10:07] oh
[1:10:08] hallelujah so remember the brands we
[1:10:10] could have a super church a super race
[1:10:12] as we near the headstone but abraham is
[1:10:15] saying that he jesus was the first of
[1:10:17] this new race he is the head of this new
[1:10:20] race colossians 1 18 and he is the head
[1:10:23] of the body the church who is the
[1:10:25] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[1:10:28] that in all things he might have the
[1:10:30] preeminence and now he connected to the
[1:10:32] scripture he read second corinthians 5
[1:10:35] 17 therefore if any man be in christ he
[1:10:39] is a new creation
[1:10:41] all things have passed away behold all
[1:10:44] things are become new
[1:10:45] there you can see that though man was of
[1:10:48] the old order or creation now in union
[1:10:53] with christ
[1:10:54] hallelujah he has become the new
[1:10:56] creation of god
[1:10:58] ephesians 2 10 for we are his
[1:11:00] workmanship hallelujah the results of
[1:11:04] his work that's what workmanship is the
[1:11:05] result of your work right created in
[1:11:08] union with christ jesus
[1:11:10] onto good works
[1:11:11] ephesians 4 24 that he put on the new
[1:11:15] man
[1:11:16] hallelujah which after god is created in
[1:11:20] righteousness and true holiness
[1:11:22] this new creation is not the all
[1:11:25] creation made over or it would not be
[1:11:28] called a new creation this is exactly
[1:11:32] what it says it is new creation it is
[1:11:35] another creation distinct from the old
[1:11:38] one
[1:11:40] oh hallelujah brethren goes on no longer
[1:11:43] is he dealing by ways of the flesh that
[1:11:45] was how he dealt with israel he chose
[1:11:47] abraham and of abraham's issue through
[1:11:50] the godly isaac line but now out of
[1:11:53] every kindred tribe and nation he has

[1:24:25] jerusalem can the church say amen
[1:24:28] let me try to finish this quote
[1:24:30] and get to my text
[1:24:32] he elected
[1:24:34] by his own decree he elected oh my the
[1:24:37] members of his new creation he
[1:24:39] predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:24:41] children according to the good pleasure
[1:24:43] of his will by his omniscience and
[1:24:46] omnipotence he brought it to pass
[1:24:49] brought it to pass his past tense
[1:24:54] who he foreknew he called past tense who
[1:24:56] he called he justified past tense who we
[1:24:58] justify he had already glorified you
[1:25:02] have to realize that when god in
[1:25:04] eternity dealing with us in time in his
[1:25:07] world this time is already finished you
[1:25:09] know
[1:25:11] so he could speak in what we call past
[1:25:13] tense but to him because he's an
[1:25:14] eternity no beginning no ending he's
[1:25:18] already seeing the end before the
[1:25:19] beginning oh you don't hear me this
[1:25:20] morning so he can read it in past tense
[1:25:22] who he foreign who he called it
[1:25:25] justified who would justify he hath all
[1:25:28] ready glorified your healing is already
[1:25:32] finished you being sealed already
[1:25:34] finished you being in the rapture
[1:25:36] already finished we are just walking
[1:25:38] through a process of what has already
[1:25:40] been finished

[1:25:51] my my my mind let me try to
[1:25:55] contain myself
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:25:59] by his omniscience and omnipotence he
[1:26:01] brought it to pass
[1:26:03] how else could he know that he would be
[1:26:05] standing in the midst of the church
[1:26:08] receiving glory from his vision
[1:26:10] if he did not make sure
[1:26:13] so but abraham said god
[1:26:14] am i he made sure he is making sure
[1:26:19] everything god is doing is to make sure
[1:26:22] that his plan don't feel

[1:36:13] it out that is the only atmosphere
[1:36:16] around it that fire comes to consume it
[1:36:19] but ibraham said it's only the
[1:36:20] atmosphere wrong and the sin that's upon
[1:36:22] the earth that will be destroyed
[1:36:25] see now we realize that the heaven means
[1:36:27] the atmosphere
[1:36:29] he said what does it do these thistles
[1:36:32] and sickness and death and politics and
[1:36:34] sinful man and sinful woman and evil

[1:37:06] to burn the sin
[1:37:07] burn the sickness and it'll be taken
[1:37:09] away listen to the prophet
[1:37:12] all this its existence that's in the

[1:37:21] contaminated with
[1:37:23] and friends don't be caught up in the
[1:37:25] contamination

[1:38:06] wasn't made for that purpose
[1:38:09] listen to the prophet sin caused it to
[1:38:11] be like that
[1:38:12] it was made by god and all of our bodies
[1:38:16] our flesh that we live in now was put on
[1:38:18] the earth when god created it because
[1:38:21] you are out of the dust of the earth it
[1:38:23] was all laid out here when god himself
[1:38:25] created it and in him the great eternal
[1:38:28] was a thought which is his attribute
[1:38:31] now sin has caused all this to happen
[1:38:34] and god through this age
[1:38:36] this is now is gathering up his material
[1:38:40] oh because he's about to fix what has
[1:38:42] gone wrong all these years listen to the
[1:38:44] prophet
[1:38:46] satan is still here that's the reason
[1:38:48] all these things happen
[1:38:52] all these negative things all these news
[1:38:54] all the sin all the satan is behind it
[1:38:56] all in here
[1:38:58] he is still here and all of his evil
[1:39:00] forces are still here notice that's why
[1:39:02] the earth now be so filthy
[1:39:04] that's why the scum and ridiculous thing
[1:39:07] that goes on bloodshed war politics sin
[1:39:11] adultery all kinds of filthiness go on
[1:39:14] because satan is a ruler of this earth
[1:39:17] and this atmosphere
[1:39:19] both heaven and earth now is
[1:39:21] contaminated with devils that can accuse
[1:39:24] us before god and jesus is there to
[1:39:27] intercede for us see while the accuser
[1:39:30] keep pointing a finger they did this
[1:39:33] they did this they did this but the
[1:39:36] blood
[1:39:37] still covers
[1:39:38] he came to redeem that elected that he
[1:39:41] foresaw that's why it's so filthy today
[1:39:45] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:39:49] by the branham goes on he said the same
[1:39:52] way he takes the individual
[1:39:54] through the three stages of grace
[1:39:57] hallelujah hallelujah is the same way
[1:40:00] the world has to go through the same
[1:40:02] thing
[1:40:03] and the world went through and noah was
[1:40:05] here the world was baptized and when
[1:40:07] jesus came
[1:40:08] blood sprinkled to sanctify the earth
[1:40:10] but now it's missing one last element
[1:40:12] which is the fire
[1:40:14] it's the same way we go to us
[1:40:16] individuals can the church say amen
[1:40:19] oh hallelujah hallelujah and it was it's
[1:40:22] in this message but iran said something
[1:40:24] really powerful he said if he ever
[1:40:25] healed a person he has to do it again
[1:40:28] when the same conditions is met so we
[1:40:31] are here today to create the same
[1:40:34] conditions for healing to take place for
[1:40:37] deliverance to take place
[1:40:38] he ever saved a man he's got to do it on
[1:40:41] the same grounds he did it the first
[1:40:43] time if he ever filled a man with the
[1:40:45] holy ghost he has got to do it on the
[1:40:48] same grounds he did it the first time if
[1:40:50] he ever raised a man up from the grave
[1:40:52] he's got to do it the second time and
[1:40:54] every other time on the same principle
[1:40:58] oh my he doesn't change oh what a hope
[1:41:01] that gives me what is it not in some
[1:41:04] man-made theory something that groups of
[1:41:07] men have come together but his
[1:41:09] unchangeable word
[1:41:11] oh my my
[1:41:13] my my my
[1:41:15] oh glory glory glory glory
[1:41:17] let me skip through here
[1:41:21] oh my
[1:41:25] [Music]
[1:41:30] see
[1:41:31] but the random goes on see the heart has
[1:41:33] to be cleansed like that
[1:41:35] before god could come down in the person
[1:41:37] of the holy ghost
[1:41:39] which is christ coming down and dwell in
[1:41:42] the human heart it first must be
[1:41:44] repented it must be baptized in water in
[1:41:47] his name to to show who it belongs to
[1:41:50] then it must be cleansed by the blood of
[1:41:52] jesus and then the holy fire the holy
[1:41:54] ghost from god comes down and burns out
[1:41:57] all the desire of sin how could this
[1:41:59] ever be intellectual
[1:42:02] how we can have another way to do this
[1:42:06] it's a process
[1:42:08] it is a process
[1:42:12] hallelujah
[1:42:13] oh
[1:42:14] my my my
[1:42:16] hallelujah see amber ibrahim goes on
[1:42:18] typing the the the individual and the
[1:42:21] earth see the earth redeem goes back to
[1:42:23] its original owner again
[1:42:25] he took it from satan he pulled taking
[1:42:28] the earth away from satan just like he
[1:42:30] took you away from satan do you know god
[1:42:31] already took you from satan
[1:42:35] hallelujah
[1:42:37] like he took a little woman at the well
[1:42:39] away from satan
[1:42:41] that that woman who was that that woman
[1:42:44] who was at the well he said go call your
[1:42:46] husband
[1:42:47] hallelujah
[1:42:49] but everyone said jesus took that one
[1:42:51] from
[1:42:52] god loves to go into situations and take
[1:42:54] people
[1:42:55] who the devil think is his and snatched
[1:42:57] him
[1:42:58] he took that little woman at the well
[1:43:01] away from satan
[1:43:03] and but ivan i'm typing against the
[1:43:04] priest who thought he was with god and
[1:43:06] go there take him
[1:43:08] so but abandon bills in this whole new
[1:43:11] earth
[1:43:12] satan will be taken away from the earth
[1:43:13] just exactly like satan was taken from
[1:43:15] you satan cannot bother or he can tempt
[1:43:19] but he cannot get a born-again christian
[1:43:21] cannot get a born-again christian
[1:43:24] for god from the foundation the world
[1:43:26] foresaw him and sent jesus to redeem him
[1:43:29] and the blood speaks for him how can he
[1:43:32] sin when it can be seen even by god
[1:43:35] hallelujah oh the only thing he's here
[1:43:37] is your voice he sees your
[1:43:39] representation
[1:43:41] oh and by the same means listen to the
[1:43:43] prophet saying by the same means for the
[1:43:45] world is one of his attributes so but i
[1:43:48] branham is saying that the earth is a
[1:43:50] creation of god
[1:43:51] the earth itself is one of his
[1:43:53] attributes the world just the same as
[1:43:56] you are one of his attributes
[1:43:58] so god is coming for his attributes he
[1:44:01] is redeeming his attributes he is
[1:44:03] restoring his
[1:44:04] attributes whoo
[1:44:07] because it was god's thinking in the
[1:44:08] beginning to have to have a world to be
[1:44:11] on a throne to be a king to be a
[1:44:13] redeemer to be a healer that's his
[1:44:15] attribute these processes makes us clean
[1:44:18] a temple for his dwelling place
[1:44:21] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:44:24] the holy ghost with fire that does the
[1:44:26] cleansing
[1:44:28] amber about him said you know when a man
[1:44:29] receives a baptism of the fire this is
[1:44:32] 1964. so for all those who who i want to
[1:44:35] experience and they're sitting down and
[1:44:37] they're taking notes and things this is
[1:44:38] 1964. whatever i'm saying you know when
[1:44:41] a man receives the baptism of the holy
[1:44:43] ghost the baptism of fire there's a lot
[1:44:45] of noise around there
[1:44:47] they think that's a shame to hear people
[1:44:49] scream and shout like that
[1:44:52] but i said just wait till this earth
[1:44:54] gets a baptism
[1:44:56] oh my brother

[1:55:54] when you get that baptism of fire then
[1:55:58] the holy ghost can come in what as it
[1:56:00] does it burns up listen to what it does
[1:56:02] it burns up everything contrary to the
[1:56:06] word out of you
[1:56:08] so the holy ghost itself the spirit of
[1:56:11] truth will guide you into all truth
[1:56:16] which underscores that you cannot be in
[1:56:18] the same place
[1:56:20] this week as last week
[1:56:24] because if the holy ghost is operating
[1:56:26] in your heart it should be it have one
[1:56:28] mission a seeker mission to find what is
[1:56:31] not the word and destroy it
[1:56:36] you heard what i read
[1:56:38] it burns up everything contrary to the
[1:56:41] word out of you
[1:56:42] so the fire of the holy ghost when it
[1:56:44] comes in it has a mission it has a
[1:56:47] purpose it has an objective to hunt in
[1:56:49] your heart
[1:56:51] and find what has done the word and burn
[1:56:52] it
[1:56:55] so if you have behaviors and thoughts
[1:56:58] and things that is not the word it's
[1:56:59] either one or two things
[1:57:02] oh just one thing really that holy ghost
[1:57:04] there that you claim to have
[1:57:07] not there no
[1:57:08] because the holy ghost will it don't
[1:57:10] need you to operate it
[1:57:13] let me say that one more time the holy
[1:57:14] ghost don't need you you are not the
[1:57:16] battery pack for the holy ghost
[1:57:18] the holy ghost has its own dynamo its
[1:57:21] own power
[1:57:23] oh come on now let's push now the holy
[1:57:25] ghost don't need you to wind it up the
[1:57:27] holy ghost is good
[1:57:30] when that fire comes in your heart as
[1:57:32] you come into peter and coming to them
[1:57:33] brother's heart hunting the holy ghost
[1:57:36] does the transformation
[1:57:39] so you have to really be careful what is
[1:57:42] in you and what is working in you
[1:57:45] because if you are not changing you need
[1:57:46] to be desperate to receive the holy
[1:57:49] ghost so the fire can begin to work and
[1:57:51] burn out
[1:57:53] oh hallelujah holy i hope this helps
[1:57:55] somebody
[1:57:57] people sitting on your message any
[1:57:58] message have you received the holy ghost
[1:58:02] since you believed
[1:58:04] could there still the baptist doctrine
[1:58:06] in your message
[1:58:07] you have it when you believe
[1:58:10] have what
[1:58:11] because i'm not seeing new creature
[1:58:13] behavior
[1:58:14] you still can't forgive that's one of
[1:58:16] the first things you can't be humble
[1:58:18] that when the first sign of the holy
[1:58:19] ghost humility

[2:10:01] is there anybody this morning wants to
[2:10:04] surrender themselves to god's
[2:10:06] germ-killing sin killing process that

[2:10:11] ghost itself
[2:10:13] to fall upon your body your mind your
[2:10:15] soul your heart and consume you
[2:10:18] like if anything is sterilized but
[2:10:20] ibraham said and we have heard a lot
[2:10:21] about sterilization and sanitation and
[2:10:24] and and on these things the last year
[2:10:26] he said if anything is terrorized the
[2:10:28] best sterilization we have ever had has
[2:10:31] been fire
[2:10:32] you can take anything with a random set
[2:10:34] and wash it with soap suds
[2:10:36] and all these chemicals that they talk
[2:10:38] about is still in free but you burn it
[2:10:40] once oh it's over and when the holy fire
[2:10:44] of god sterilizes the earth
[2:10:47] with the chemicals he has lifted his
