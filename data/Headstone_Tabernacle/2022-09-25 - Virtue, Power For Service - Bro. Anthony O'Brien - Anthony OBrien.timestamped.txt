[54:45] 12 years
[54:47] and spent all her living upon Physicians
[54:50] neither could be healed of any
[54:52] came behind and touched the border of
[54:54] His Garment and immediately her issue of
[54:57] blood snatched man dried up
[55:00] Jesus said who touched me
[55:03] when all the night we denied Peter and
[55:06] they that were with him said Master the
[55:09] multitude throng thee and pressed thee
[55:11] and see it though who touched me
[55:14] and Jesus said somebody had touched me
[55:17] here's why for I perceive that virtue is
[55:21] gone out of me
[55:23] and when the woman saw that she was not
[55:24] him she came trembling and falling down
[55:28] before him she declared unto him before

[1:14:32] that's the atmosphere you have to be in
[1:14:35] God announces the times and the season
[1:14:38] but we that's not in our power oh but we
[1:14:42] shall receive power that's your promise
[1:14:44] we don't know what's going to happen
[1:14:45] when it's gonna we don't know when it's
[1:14:47] gonna happen we have an idea what's
[1:14:48] gonna happen we've seen God do it before
[1:14:50] we know God could do it again but oh
[1:14:53] it's inducted all power to say when this
[1:14:55] revival is going to take place in other
[1:14:57] words it can take place in five minutes
[1:14:59] it could take place in five hours it
[1:15:02] could take place tomorrow I don't know
[1:15:03] but when it does break make sure that
[1:15:06] you receive power after the Holy Ghost
[1:15:08] comes upon you so that you can be
[1:15:11] Witnesses
[1:15:13] because you can't be a true witness
[1:15:15] without the Holy Ghost
[1:15:18] you're only telling about somebody
[1:15:20] else's testimony you're only talking
[1:15:22] about somebody else's experience and you
[1:15:25] can't go to heaven on somebody else's
[1:15:27] experience you have to go on your
[1:15:29] experience you have to be real you have
[1:15:31] to be anointed you have to be
[1:15:33] commissioned you have to know you
[1:15:35] receive something and you have to be
[1:15:37] able to wave it in a devil's face and
[1:15:40] say I don't belong to you anymore I've
[1:15:44] been protest by the blood I've been
[1:15:46] filled with the Holy Ghost wave it in
[1:15:49] his face and say look here I've been
[1:15:52] sealed from glory to glory to glory
[1:16:00] oh
[1:16:01] Hallelujah
[1:16:03] hey man
[1:16:04] that's what it is
[1:16:07] I wonder if it comes we've got to be
[1:16:08] concerned about receiving our portion
[1:16:12] so we come for
[1:16:13] we come to jump on child wear a nice
[1:16:15] suit wear a nice dress oh look at me

[1:16:21] no
[1:16:23] your company be changed
[1:16:26] because we are going to a place that
[1:16:27] cannot change
[1:16:29] so the time to change is here
[1:16:32] the time to change is now
[1:16:34] the time to be happy is now the time to
[1:16:37] Rejoice is now the time to worship is
[1:16:40] now and a time to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:16:42] is right here on Earth
[1:16:46] right in the devil's Eden
[1:16:49] right in the midst of all that the devil
[1:16:51] has created all these distractions all
[1:16:54] these confusions all these voices all
[1:16:58] these noises but somehow God found a way
[1:17:01] through the full essence of preaching
[1:17:03] through the word of almighty God he cut
[1:17:06] through all the noise he cut through all
[1:17:09] the darkness he cut through all the hell
[1:17:11] do you know how many Devils God fought
[1:17:14] to bring you here this morning
[1:17:16] last week
[1:17:18] oh do you know how many Devils you
[1:17:20] overcame
[1:17:21] oh you can't even count them on your
[1:17:24] finger oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:27] hallelujah
[1:17:27] [Applause]
[1:17:30] when the Devils when the legion asks
[1:17:33] Jesus to let us go into the pigs
[1:17:36] then is when we really saw how much
[1:17:38] Devils was in our morning
[1:17:44] there's hundreds of pigs running off the
[1:17:46] cliff
[1:17:47] hundreds and each one of them are almost
[1:17:50] represented our spirit
[1:17:52] I was in Naman
[1:17:54] think about it
[1:17:56] one man sit on there
[1:17:59] no your body's a temple
[1:18:01] see mine is very powerful and mine could
[1:18:03] host a whole number of things
[1:18:07] it's not right
[1:18:08] I think Mary had Seven Devils from the
[1:18:10] castle I don't know
[1:18:12] seven imagine that one human body
[1:18:15] that's a lot of devils
[1:18:18] the human body is very powerful God
[1:18:20] knows that because he created it for his
[1:18:21] purpose
[1:18:22] he created it to house this
[1:18:27] so how's this but the devil tried to
[1:18:29] fill it with all kinds of other stuff
[1:18:31] you understand like pride and lust and
[1:18:34] fornication adultery and evil commit and
[1:18:36] don't uh think things like that isn't
[1:18:39] that right the devil tried to pack it
[1:18:40] with all kind of nonsense
[1:18:42] but when you start to get that out
[1:18:45] kick that out one by one ten by ten
[1:18:48] hundreds by hundreds then you could fill
[1:18:51] yourself with this
[1:18:53] foreign
[1:18:54] that's what you was created for
[1:18:58] to house this power
[1:19:02] oh you don't hear me this morning and if
[1:19:04] one could put a thousandth of flights
[1:19:06] then think how much power there's having
[1:19:08] it
[1:19:08] [Applause]
[1:19:10] Legion done frightened already because
[1:19:13] as far as he concerned all of them gone
[1:19:15] in one shot with one of this in you
[1:19:18] wow he's gone
[1:19:24] oh you don't hear me this morning
[1:19:27] when the pride got to know who she is
[1:19:29] she'll speak and it'll create itself
[1:19:32] just like that
[1:19:35] oh Hallelujah
[1:19:37] oh think about it now amen as we
[1:19:41] continue all right amen
[1:19:42] oh hallelujah praise God Revival is
[1:19:45] right we got to be concerned about
[1:19:46] receiving our portion so the Revival is
[1:19:48] our opportunity this morning
[1:19:50] that God creates not by might or power
[1:19:53] but my spirit sending a Revival to
[1:19:56] create an opportunity for you to get
[1:19:58] into the pool
[1:20:00] for you to get your portion forget to
[1:20:02] get your inheritance it's an atmosphere
[1:20:04] is created for the Holy Ghost
[1:20:07] for you to get your portion but you
[1:20:10] can't get caught up in the atmosphere
[1:20:11] you have to be praying seek and looking
[1:20:13] searching and you cannot stop until you
[1:20:16] get what is yours
[1:20:18] because there were certain tribes that
[1:20:20] went into the land and did not defeat
[1:20:22] all of the inended any enemies
[1:20:25] I did not drive out all the inhabitants
[1:20:28] God was at Benjamin but he didn't try
[1:20:30] them out he was in Asha but he didn't
[1:20:32] drive them out but God said there was
[1:20:34] one that took them out his name was
[1:20:36] Caleb and Caleb said praise God I am
[1:20:39] going to expel these these these These
[1:20:42] are malachite praise God these hit us he
[1:20:44] shall be sites this
[1:20:47] Philistines all these personal demons

[1:20:52] spirit with him Hallelujah Allah that's
[1:20:55] the strongest day and if the Lord be
[1:20:58] with me then I shall be able to drive
[1:21:00] them out
[1:21:01] he had confidence listen you don't hear
[1:21:04] me this morning oh I need some shelters
[1:21:06] this morning to help me preach this
[1:21:08] message I need some worshipers to match
[1:21:10] up the place praise God a man oh I'm
[1:21:13] tired of Pebbles I'm tired of Satan I'm
[1:21:16] tired of demons squatting on my line I'm
[1:21:19] fed up I hope somebody's fed up here
[1:21:21] with me this morning oh Hallelujah
[1:21:25] oh I gotta move I'm sorry I can't stand
[1:21:27] still praise God the holy spirit is here
[1:21:30] gotta do something even the prophet
[1:21:33] right around his vehicle oh mercy oh
[1:21:36] Hallelujah listen oh
[1:21:42] I don't know I'm not even reading
[1:21:44] anything
[1:21:45] the Holy Spirit
[1:21:47] was with them other brothers
[1:21:49] the Lord was with them Caleb saying the
[1:21:51] Lord is with me he wasn't necessarily an
[1:21:53] exclusive thing you know
[1:21:54] the Lord is with the other tribes too
[1:21:56] but it didn't drive them out they didn't
[1:21:59] have the tenacity they didn't have the
[1:22:01] five the verb
[1:22:03] they didn't have the determination they
[1:22:05] took to drive out the devil and all his
[1:22:08] flesh he didn't have what it took so the
[1:22:11] remainers are found in their side but
[1:22:13] Caleb said that God is with me then I
[1:22:16] shall be able
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:22] okay okay
[1:22:25] let me bring it another way maybe we'll
[1:22:26] catch the other crowd
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:22:30] who didn't get it yet amen I got
[1:22:32] compassion for you man praise God
[1:22:38] 's power is unlimited
[1:22:41] random said that his power is unlimited
[1:22:43] which means if he gives you power here

[1:22:47] himself
[1:22:48] to help you climb and get your
[1:22:50] inheritance to get your portion so
[1:22:54] there's nothing lacking in God's power
[1:22:56] God's ability to do it this morning what
[1:22:59] he needs is your faith
[1:23:00] to connect with the power that he's
[1:23:03] already given you
[1:23:04] the Lord said if
[1:23:06] what about him said you have with the
[1:23:08] powers Lane here this morning but not
[1:23:10] enough rich
[1:23:12] to move the power of God and because the
[1:23:15] word was not mixed with French many
[1:23:17] perish in the wilderness
[1:23:19] oh but this morning shall the son of man
[1:23:23] when he come shall he find faith on the
[1:23:25] Earth

[1:24:41] field and guess what the great thing
[1:24:42] about faith is like a muscle the more

[1:29:58] tear I cry I'm coming back home to Jesus
[1:30:02] I Belong To Heaven
[1:30:04] and you belong with me
[1:30:06] oh I live forever for eternity oh
[1:30:10] Hallelujah do you feel that way this
[1:30:12] morning I'm Heaven bound this morning oh
[1:30:16] Hallelujah this world is not my home I'm
[1:30:20] just a traveling through oh Hallelujah
[1:30:23] Oh Glory
[1:30:26] I'm like an arrow passing through time
[1:30:28] praise God oh Hallelujah pick up the
[1:30:31] holy ghost from witness then we ought to
[1:30:33] hear praise God hey man
[1:30:37] is that the way you feel all right
[1:30:39] we're going on get a little later on see
[1:30:41] it's another message the sign that Paul
[1:30:43] spoke of times tongues was assigned to
[1:30:46] the Believers or the unbelievers you
[1:30:48] know in the context right now notice but
[1:30:50] in this
[1:30:51] the Holy Ghost is a sign
[1:30:54] he said I mean and the Holy Ghost is a
[1:30:56] seal
[1:30:56] he says it's a sign that God kept his
[1:30:59] children chosen children it's also a
[1:31:01] seal right and he said to reject it is
[1:31:03] to be cut from the people
[1:31:05] and to receive it is to be finished with
[1:31:08] the world and all the things of the
[1:31:09] world oh wonderful oh praise God the
[1:31:13] only reason the devil has any power is
[1:31:15] because you still have anxious face to
[1:31:16] work with yourself a little bit of lust
[1:31:18] a little bit Pride a little bit of head
[1:31:20] a little bit of this but when God
[1:31:21] finished the work in you he have nothing
[1:31:24] to work in
[1:31:25] he's bound
[1:31:27] he's Bound by a chain of circumstance
[1:31:29] because he can't find somebody to work
[1:31:32] through
[1:31:33] he can't find unforgiving Spirits
[1:31:35] because there's forgiveness across your
[1:31:37] chest the blood of the age across your
[1:31:40] chest forgiveness forgiveness no matter
[1:31:43] what they did for you slide off the back
[1:31:45] of your praise God like a pruned duck or
[1:31:48] forgiveness Mercy Hallelujah don't worry
[1:31:51] about it oh I'm going to heaven I want
[1:31:54] to travel light if you're going to
[1:31:56] heaven you have to travel lights take
[1:31:57] off all the heavy stuff kick out all
[1:31:59] your baggage take on all the excess
[1:32:01] things who did this and who did that my
[1:32:04] mother my father forgive oh Holly who is
[1:32:07] my mother who is my father damn datura
[1:32:10] works of God oh hallelujah praise God
[1:32:12] that's my brother that's my sister oh
[1:32:14] all them now keep his Commandments and
[1:32:17] love with them hallelujah praise God
[1:32:20] Amen Hallelujah glory to God
[1:32:24] forgive those that hurt you despitefully
[1:32:27] use you and persecute you
[1:32:29] why
[1:32:30] so that your father in Heaven might be
[1:32:32] glorified you're not here to glorify
[1:32:34] yourself you had to glorify your father
[1:32:36] in Heaven that's why we forgive it's not
[1:32:39] about us it's not about me it's not
[1:32:42] about anything I could do it's about
[1:32:43] what God has already done it's what God
[1:32:46] forbidden did in my life I was in the
[1:32:48] mighty claim I was really warmed up I
[1:32:51] was really messed up down here in
[1:32:53] Trinidad but the hand of almighty God
[1:32:56] pick me up turn me around planting my
[1:33:00] feet on higher ground and if God did all
[1:33:03] that for me why can't I forgive somebody
[1:33:06] who used me and persecuted me and hated
[1:33:09] me and rejected me it's a love of God
[1:33:12] shining out
[1:33:13] expressing God's kindness to that
[1:33:16] individual I love you I forgive you God
[1:33:20] loves me and he loves you too praise God
[1:33:22] hallelujah
[1:33:25] oh Hallelujah
[1:33:30] Hallelujah
[1:33:34] now it takes a spirit to do that
[1:33:38] say that one time
[1:33:39] you're not gonna do that in your flesh
[1:33:41] no it takes a spirit of spirit of
[1:33:45] forgiveness
[1:33:47] take the hood out
[1:33:50] to take the anguish out
[1:33:53] because every time you see the person
[1:33:54] every time you remember the situation
[1:33:57] comes up like vomit in your throat and
[1:34:01] you want to spill it
[1:34:03] but it takes broadly kindness Spirit of
[1:34:05] forgiveness
[1:34:07] to sweep over do something for you
[1:34:11] I'm telling you because I experienced it
[1:34:13] that's why I know
[1:34:17] it's another spirit it's a presence that
[1:34:20] comes over you it sweeps over your heart
[1:34:23] and life it does something to you
[1:34:25] and you know you are different you know
[1:34:29] it
[1:34:30] you know it
[1:34:32] because when you come down from that
[1:34:34] anointing and you go out into the world
[1:34:36] and you shake hands you feel it upon you
[1:34:41] [Music]
[1:34:44] it's a real thing
[1:34:47] and I genuinely believe this is I
[1:34:49] generally believe personal conviction
[1:34:51] now that the church has to find that
[1:34:53] that's that sweet spirit that comes upon
[1:34:57] the mother when she's ready to give
[1:34:59] forth bring forth our baby and when
[1:35:02] you're getting ready to bring forth
[1:35:03] Jesus Christ you got to have another
[1:35:05] spirit with you that sweet spirit is
[1:35:08] going to sweep over you it's going to be
[1:35:11] over the individual because it's a sign
[1:35:13] that you're getting ready to bring forth
[1:35:16] something Supernatural
[1:35:17] [Applause]
[1:35:23] that's not that is not skim milk
[1:35:27] because not everybody's going to be able
[1:35:28] to do that now
[1:35:32] Spirit of forgiveness
[1:35:35] oh my all right
[1:35:37] well that's interesting
[1:35:39] praise God
[1:35:42] oh Hallelujah you're loving this morning
[1:35:44] man
[1:35:45] praise God
[1:35:48] well
[1:35:50] what is in charge
[1:35:52] amen
[1:35:53] praise God hallelujah okay here we go
[1:36:01] hey man sorry for that please go all
[1:36:04] right
[1:36:05] so let me continue now see she says what
[1:36:07] the Holy Ghost okay so he says
[1:36:10] it says the Finish thing right
[1:36:12] all right
[1:36:14] I wanted to read something here
[1:36:16] okay
[1:36:18] a Revival is a spiritual awakening is
[1:36:19] that right it's a spiritual story
[1:36:21] right you can be a Revival nothing
[1:36:23] happened to you see you go on the scene
[1:36:24] you got to let it change you right so
[1:36:27] here's Queen of Sheba Prophet said he
[1:36:29] said oh what if the Christian church
[1:36:30] tonight what if the Christian church
[1:36:31] today could believe the gift that God
[1:36:34] had sent them the Holy Ghost what if
[1:36:37] they would receive it what if all the
[1:36:39] nominations would rally around Solomon
[1:36:42] with that gift the Holy Ghost the holy
[1:36:44] spirit is a gift to the church and the
[1:36:48] church turns it away and shuts It Off
[1:36:50] with our doctrines and our theologies
[1:36:53] and things right you know man-made
[1:36:55] Creeds he said we shut Christ right out
[1:36:57] he said don't let the Holy Spirit come
[1:36:59] in no no Miracles no shouting no
[1:37:01] speaking in tongues no Praises of God
[1:37:03] what our condition to be in he said well
[1:37:05] if the Holy Spirit done that in the book
[1:37:07] of Acts he said it got to do the same
[1:37:09] thing today
[1:37:11] it's the same Jesus right if he was that
[1:37:14] in the alpha he has to do the same thing
[1:37:16] today in the Omega isn't that right
[1:37:17] right because the book of Acts isn't
[1:37:19] also act the apostles just what we said
[1:37:22] earlier he says the acts of the holy
[1:37:24] spirit in the apostles and it's the same
[1:37:26] Holy Spirit in the church today that it
[1:37:29] would act the same way and give the same
[1:37:32] results he said why accept the
[1:37:34] substitute when the skies are full of
[1:37:37] the real Pentecostal power
[1:37:41] foreign
[1:37:42] the skies are full of it this morning
[1:37:45] it's right up there somewhere in the
[1:37:46] atmosphere all you have to have this
[1:37:48] morning is a strong hand of Fate to cut
[1:37:51] out the promises of God and pull along
[1:37:53] your portion this morning
[1:37:55] oh but the skies are full of it the
[1:37:58] prophet said it isn't that right and we
[1:38:00] believe it it's not right he said the
[1:38:03] skies are full of it
[1:38:04] he said we don't have to have a
[1:38:06] substitute we have we can have the real
[1:38:08] he said I know it's the truth my brother
[1:38:09] my sister it's true I'm now the act of
[1:38:12] the holy spirit amen okay so Saint Luke
[1:38:14] 8 we're at the story with a woman to the
[1:38:16] blood issue right she was in a Revival
[1:38:18] she come to Revival everyone is around
[1:38:20] touching Jesus but she come with a need
[1:38:24] and that's what made the difference she
[1:38:27] come with a need in her heart she needed
[1:38:30] something and that need drove her to her
[1:38:33] knees and she began to crawl and grapple
[1:38:37] because she had to get to the Messiah
[1:38:38] she had to capture Jesus because she had
[1:38:41] a need oh the doctors couldn't help her
[1:38:44] the Pharisees couldn't help her the
[1:38:47] sadduce he's going to help her but there
[1:38:49] was one man on the earth with the gift
[1:38:52] that she needed if she could just touch
[1:38:54] the hell of his comments she knew in
[1:38:57] herself she already told herself and
[1:39:00] convinced herself that if she could just
[1:39:03] Touch the Hem of His comment she knew
[1:39:05] she would be made whole and when she was
[1:39:07] convinced she was concerned oh and she
[1:39:11] began to fight she began to press she
[1:39:14] began to pray and that's what you have
[1:39:16] to do this morning
[1:39:22] [Applause]
[1:39:28] when the power of God really strikes
[1:39:30] home all kind of things will be crawling
[1:39:31] in here
[1:39:32] what kind of spirits in her
[1:39:35] it's called dreams his grace the gods
[1:39:38] ever pulls the Holy Spirit out upon the
[1:39:40] church will be the grace of God not
[1:39:41] anything that we did not have works that
[1:39:42] we could boast that's his grace his
[1:39:44] Reign falling upon the church but it
[1:39:46] brings up the just and the unjust
[1:39:51] it falls under scripture and the
[1:39:53] unscriptural
[1:39:54] all of them coming up weeds thistles
[1:39:57] bread I'll read it just now I have a
[1:40:00] quote on it
[1:40:00] praise God but you got to know what
[1:40:02] Spirit you are off
[1:40:04] you got to know you are like Caleb Caleb
[1:40:07] represent the bride Helen wasn't mixing
[1:40:09] matters Caleb come to chop he comes a
[1:40:12] kick he comes a bite if he loses teeth
[1:40:15] he uses gums but Caleb come to get his
[1:40:18] Mountain he come to get his inheritance
[1:40:20] and you have to be convinced this
[1:40:22] morning come on now oh that is not
[1:40:25] enough troubles in hell that can stop
[1:40:27] you from getting your blessing I come
[1:40:30] too far I come to find this life to have
[1:40:34] some devil come and turn me back around
[1:40:36] and make me go back the same way I come
[1:40:38] brother no I've already made all this
[1:40:41] effort I'm going all the way praise God
[1:40:43] let me keep on pressing keep on striving
[1:40:47] how do you not know that you're just
[1:40:49] inches away from your blessing
[1:40:52] oh Hallelujah
[1:40:55] how many know that
[1:40:58] time without a story about a man digging
[1:41:00] for gold or something he knew exactly
[1:41:02] where it was digging digging digging
[1:41:04] digging
[1:41:05] he got tired
[1:41:06] so I stopped digging
[1:41:09] I can't do any more you give up and
[1:41:12] somebody else came and dug in the same
[1:41:13] place he dug and got it
[1:41:17] after all that effort wasted
[1:41:20] because he didn't get what he set out to
[1:41:21] his heart to do in the first place
[1:41:23] isn't that right I think it's the Wright
[1:41:26] brothers when they discovered to fly
[1:41:28] they weren't the only ones who were
[1:41:29] trying to uh to learn uh manpowered
[1:41:32] flights and so forth like that you know
[1:41:33] there were other people trying to matter
[1:41:36] of fact there was another famous group
[1:41:37] that was trying to do the same thing
[1:41:38] they had finances they had engineering
[1:41:41] they had all the men on the team they
[1:41:42] had the best and they kept trying trying
[1:41:44] they couldn't do it and a bunch of two
[1:41:46] raggedy guys who won a bike shop
[1:41:49] kept going and they kept going and going
[1:41:52] and going until they figure it out they
[1:41:55] didn't have all the money in the world
[1:41:56] didn't have all their friends they
[1:41:57] didn't have all the connections they
[1:41:58] didn't have all the networks but they
[1:42:01] kept going until they figured it out
[1:42:02] they were persistent in their goal this
[1:42:06] woman of the blood issue was persistent
[1:42:08] in her goal and I'm telling you church
[1:42:10] if you are perseverance if you are
[1:42:13] persistent in your goal if you make up
[1:42:16] your mind that you're not gonna let the
[1:42:18] devil get the victory this morning then
[1:42:21] you will achieve what you are looking
[1:42:23] for
[1:42:26] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:30] hallelujah so I'm here to encourage you
[1:42:32] this morning
[1:42:33] keep pressing
[1:42:34] it's right at the door
[1:42:37] amen virtue powerful service so what is
[1:42:40] virtue what is it it's strength right
[1:42:42] power right
[1:42:43] statue of a perfect man Prophet
[1:42:45] identifies with him he said no here's
[1:42:46] what you do what's the first thing we
[1:42:47] have faith and we're born again that's
[1:42:50] that's living the foundation right then
[1:42:52] after we lay the foundation secondly you
[1:42:55] add to your foundation right
[1:42:57] he said after your faith you're going up
[1:42:59] in the building right you can't just
[1:43:00] stay the foundation so you add to your
[1:43:01] foundation you say add to your feet
[1:43:03] Peter said here add to your first year
[1:43:06] after faith
[1:43:07] so then add virtue to your feet this is
[1:43:10] the next column right because I guess
[1:43:12] he's pointing out the chart there he
[1:43:15] said that's the next column right first
[1:43:16] Port your foundation fee then to your
[1:43:19] feet at virtue now right here knocks a
[1:43:23] lot of us down he said
[1:43:25] wow he said yes
[1:43:27] he said that doesn't just mean live a
[1:43:30] virgin life right like to be virtuous
[1:43:33] right he said you know like the woman on
[1:43:34] man and so forth to be virtuous that
[1:43:36] doesn't that's nothing to do with that
[1:43:37] the Bible said he said we read over here
[1:43:40] in the Book of Luke where it said virtue
[1:43:41] went out of him
[1:43:43] he said that's right congregation says
[1:43:45] amen right okay we're on the word amen
[1:43:47] he said now if we're gonna be like him
[1:43:49] we must have virtue
[1:43:51] amen you must have it in order to be
[1:43:54] like he was
[1:43:55] isn't that right then we must have it to
[1:43:58] be like him it's the first song that I
[1:44:00] ever loved in the hymns the prophet said
[1:44:02] one of the greatest to be like Jesus
[1:44:04] right he said well if I'm going to be
[1:44:06] like Jesus I've got to have virtue
[1:44:10] and the past that it can pass forward
[1:44:12] from me to the people isn't that right
[1:44:15] amen it's wonderful he said now put you
[1:44:17] now before you can let it out you got to
[1:44:20] have it first it's got to be in you to
[1:44:24] give out to others
[1:44:25] amen I love it here praise God he said
[1:44:27] amen's got to be in you before you can
[1:44:30] let it out you've got to have it first
[1:44:32] you haven't got it it won't come out
[1:44:34] there's nothing for it to come out of
[1:44:37] oh Hallelujah just like Peter said when
[1:44:40] he came up to the gate called Beautiful
[1:44:41] there was a man laying there
[1:44:44] from his mother's womb he was there a
[1:44:47] long time
[1:44:48] praise God he was there when Jesus was
[1:44:50] alive Jesus crucified died rose up on
[1:44:53] the third day now I'm still in there
[1:44:56] he was about 40 years old or something
[1:44:57] that's not right I think 40 something
[1:44:59] it's not right he was there a long time
[1:45:02] Jesus probably knew that man was there
[1:45:04] but but God the will of God knew that
[1:45:06] Peter was gonna pass by one day
[1:45:09] and give that man his portion so there
[1:45:11] he laid there crippled waiting for his
[1:45:14] time and season oh Hallelujah he's with
[1:45:16] him by the gate praise God I don't know
[1:45:19] how long he was waiting therefore but he
[1:45:21] was waiting Hallelujah all of a sudden
[1:45:23] here come his time and season Here Come
[1:45:25] Peter walking down the road and Peter
[1:45:28] said I don't have silver and gold I
[1:45:30] don't have money I don't have a phone
[1:45:32] card I don't have a a a insurance man
[1:45:35] that can give you or nothing but I got
[1:45:37] something I can give you he had
[1:45:39] something to give the man strength
[1:45:41] something to get the man power or
[1:45:44] healing for his body and the same virtue
[1:45:47] that heal and woman with a blood issue
[1:45:49] come out of pizza and strengthen his
[1:45:52] ankle bones and he rose up
[1:45:56] oh do you hear what I'm saying
[1:45:59] you have to have it to give it Peter had
[1:46:02] it to give it and there's going to be a
[1:46:04] bride on the Urge there's going to be
[1:46:06] sons and daughters in here this morning

[1:47:05] so uh he said uh sorry you gotta have it
[1:47:08] first it's something to come out of he
[1:47:10] said now what if someone tried
[1:47:11] draw virtue out of us and the check
[1:47:14] wouldn't return
[1:47:16] amen the bank check right he said the
[1:47:18] check wouldn't return insufficient funds
[1:47:20] see nothing there to draw from check

[1:50:41] anyone that knows that word Virtue says
[1:50:43] mean says must have it but you went out
[1:50:44] and to heal a woman I was sick he's
[1:50:46] expecting that same virtue in his church
[1:50:49] remember we have to have the same work
[1:50:51] same signs that they had in the early
[1:50:53] church that's the kind of church Jesus
[1:50:55] coming back for in the last days they
[1:50:57] have to have Jesus walking in it Jesus
[1:50:59] walking on two feet Jesus wearing a tie

[1:51:35] what is virtue virtue is strength he
[1:51:38] says it's here power that's it amen says

[2:03:29] happy because if he don't go the
[2:03:32] comforter cannot come

[2:19:21] whose seat is in itself upon the Earth
[2:19:23] God's power to transformed Prophet said

[2:19:31] of his word
[2:19:32] ah the spirit of the word is what does
[2:19:36] the transformation you got that amen
[2:19:39] that's the answer right he transforms he
[2:19:41] plants his seed then he throws his
[2:19:43] Spirit on it the watering spirit
[2:19:47] water water the seed bring it to life
[2:19:49] which is the Holy Ghost right we got
[2:19:51] that all right and it brings forth the
[2:19:53] product his holy spirit transforms the
[2:19:55] seed wood into to be Vindicated of its
[2:19:59] kind
[2:19:59] what kind of a seed you are that shows
[2:20:02] just what's in you
[2:20:04] he said you can't hide it whatever you
[2:20:07] want inside it shows on the outside
[2:20:10] is anything with a lily right you see it
[2:20:12] same thing see you can't you can't just
[2:20:14] you just can't keep from it
[2:20:15] it'll speak for itself
[2:20:17] right amen he said in another place he
[2:20:20] said you can't make that tree anything
[2:20:21] but what it is see it's going to be that
[2:20:24] way the Holy Spirit transformed the seed
[2:20:26] that's on the inside no matter what kind
[2:20:29] of seed it is now listen to the snow
[2:20:31] no matter what kind of seed it is it
[2:20:33] will transform it so we're talking about
[2:20:35] transform power coming up on a seed
[2:20:37] so that seed is a discrepancy then the
[2:20:41] power of the spirit watering spirit will
[2:20:42] bring that discrepancy to life
[2:20:45] yes a chicken right so you have to be
[2:20:47] careful what kind of seed is in you
[2:20:50] what you received oh so we thank God for
[2:20:53] Revelation
[2:20:54] says you pray God ask God for Revelation
[2:20:58] praise God to know what seed is in you
[2:21:01] to know what you are receiving because
[2:21:04] when that great watering Spirit comes it
[2:21:06] raises all of the seeds up oh Hallelujah

[2:21:18] God isn't that right okay it's that way
[2:21:21] see can't keep from it you got you can't
[2:21:22] make the tree anything but what it is
[2:21:25] see that's that's the code God put in it
[2:21:27] when he spoke the season there isn't
[2:21:30] that right let every seed bring forth of
[2:21:31] his kind right God put the seed in the
[2:21:33] earth so all the time when God was
[2:21:36] moving his son and the moon and
[2:21:37] separating the water from the land and
[2:21:38] so forth like that what he was really
[2:21:40] doing was creating an environment for
[2:21:42] those Seas to come up because of the
[2:21:44] water covered the land these seeds can't
[2:21:45] come up so all Genesis 2 10 Street
[2:21:48] Genesis 4 Genesis five God is just
[2:21:50] creating creating but he's coming down
[2:21:52] to that seed then when he hit Genesis 1
[2:21:54] 11 he said let every seed bring forth
[2:21:56] after its kind he couldn't say that back
[2:21:58] there he had to separate a woman into
[2:22:00] heaven from the woman of the earth and
[2:22:01] stuff like he was still working on you
[2:22:03] but when he come down to the time and
[2:22:06] season
[2:22:07] are you getting what I'm saying now so
[2:22:09] all these years coming up God was just
[2:22:11] working on you you weren't what you are
[2:22:14] not what you was yesterday you could
[2:22:16] always look back and see how much you've
[2:22:18] grown how much you've learned what stuff
[2:22:20] you come true yeah it was tough yeah it
[2:22:23] was hard yeah it might have seemed dark
[2:22:25] oh Hallelujah everyone has dark times
[2:22:28] maybe you felt like you walked away but
[2:22:30] that's all right God's hand was still
[2:22:33] upon your life he was still forming you
[2:22:36] he was still getting you down to Genesis
[2:22:38] 1 11 so that that seed that was always
[2:22:41] in itself in the Earth
[2:22:43] that seat was always in you but God was
[2:22:46] just working on you all these years he
[2:22:49] was just working on you working on you
[2:22:51] getting you ready to bring forth life
[2:22:55] [Applause]
[2:22:57] just like he worked on the earth just
[2:22:59] like he formed the Earth out of chaos
[2:23:01] out of Darkness out of confusion all
[2:23:04] these years my brother all these years
[2:23:07] my sister he's been pulling you out of
[2:23:09] Darkness pulling you out of confusion
[2:23:12] forming something in your soul so that
[2:23:16] you could bring forth life
[2:23:18] are you hearing what I'm saying there's
[2:23:21] a seed in your soul and in that seat is
[2:23:23] the purpose of God and that purpose must
[2:23:26] be accomplished there is not enough
[2:23:28] devils in this universe that can stop
[2:23:31] the purpose of God from coming forth in
[2:23:33] your life
[2:23:35] so he separated you from your mother's
[2:23:37] womb come on he separated you from your
[2:23:40] family separated you from your work
[2:23:42] somebody you from everything else in the
[2:23:44] world what was he doing he was working
[2:23:47] on you working on you bringing you out
[2:23:50] of chaos forming you forming you getting
[2:23:54] you ready for Genesis 1 11.
[2:23:57] let every seed
[2:24:00] bring forth after it's kind
[2:24:02] and then that transforming power
[2:24:05] always take a hole
[2:24:06] bring the seat to life
[2:24:08] time and season do you got it now
[2:24:11] so it wasn't in vain

[2:26:54] unfailing god oh where the church has
[2:26:57] missed it by just saying I spoke in
[2:26:59] tongues I've got it now he said you've
[2:27:00] just gotten started that's for sure amen

[2:27:35] said no no no you'll pull up the wheat
[2:27:37] also
[2:27:38] the master said amen so let them boot
[2:27:40] grow together now here's what we want to
[2:27:41] get to he said there's a wheat field out
[2:27:44] here the prophet said
[2:27:45] he said and there's creepers nettle
[2:27:47] balls stink weed everything else is in
[2:27:51] it is that right he said but now in here
[2:27:54] there's also wheat is that right it
[2:27:57] caught three kind of Believers right
[2:27:58] okay so now the rain comes off upon the
[2:28:02] Earth to water it
[2:28:04] and now what's the rain for he said to
[2:28:06] water the nettle balls now watch and pay
[2:28:09] attention see he said now not to not to
[2:28:12] not to water the creeper he said he said
[2:28:15] no he said not to water the nettle ball
[2:28:16] no watch pay attention he said the water
[2:28:18] come not to water the creeper he said
[2:28:20] the rain is sent for the wheat
[2:28:22] but the nettle ball and the weed is just
[2:28:25] as thirsty as the wheat is
[2:28:27] he said on the same rain that falls on
[2:28:29] the wheat falls on the weed and that
[2:28:32] little old weed will stand right up the
[2:28:33] street like that happy and rejoicing
[2:28:35] just as much as the little wheat was
[2:28:37] stand up and stand himself up
[2:28:40] oh Hallelujah so they're all standing up
[2:28:42] they're all shouting they're all looking
[2:28:44] like smelling like acting like
[2:28:46] Christians but one of them is wheat and
[2:28:48] the other one is weed oh but the rain is
[2:28:51] bringing it all to life but you've got
[2:28:53] to know what is in you this morning oh
[2:28:56] you gotta stand like Joshua and Caleb
[2:28:58] and say give me my mansion and when the
[2:29:02] Dynamics Falls you're going to possess
[2:29:04] that
[2:29:06] you didn't come to occupy a church bench
[2:29:08] he didn't come to take up space but you
[2:29:10] come to get your inheritance you come to
[2:29:13] get the Holy Ghost in your soul so that
[2:29:16] you can climb that pyramid so that you
[2:29:18] could go up into the Rapture can we say
[2:29:21] man
[2:29:23] Hallelujah that's who you come for this
[2:29:25] morning amen and the same rain that
[2:29:27] falls in a week falls on the weeds amen
[2:29:30] the stand up straight like that just the
[2:29:31] same right just as much he said but by a
[2:29:33] fruits you shall know them there you are
[2:29:37] see Prophet said now the same Holy
[2:29:39] Spirit hear this Mom hit his bum
[2:29:43] excuse me now the same Holy Spirit can
[2:29:45] bless a hypocrite
[2:29:47] that knocks some of you Armenians right
[2:29:49] out he said but that's the truth that's
[2:29:51] the truth see been taught holy ghost or
[2:29:53] Holiness which I believe in Holiness too
[2:29:55] but that same Spirit the rain falls
[2:29:58] under just and the unjust he said but by
[2:30:02] their fruits you shall know them so you
[2:30:05] are going to bring forth fruit and your
[2:30:07] fruit will remain faith will remain
[2:30:09] thought you will remain knowledge will
[2:30:12] remain Temperance will remain you're
[2:30:14] gonna live these virtues and no devil is
[2:30:16] going to take it from you because it's
[2:30:18] your possession it's your individual
[2:30:21] inheritance oh do you believe it this
[2:30:24] morning musician can get ready to come
[2:30:26] if I look out here and I go to get the
[2:30:27] wheat I get wheat but the weeds is all
[2:30:30] bound up see and they live on the same
[2:30:33] rain that fell for the wheat and the
[2:30:34] rain was not sent for the weeds it was
[2:30:36] sent for the wheat but the rain being on
[2:30:38] the field the wheat being uh the weeds
[2:30:41] being in the field just got as much
[2:30:42] benefit out of the rain as the rest of
[2:30:43] them did and the same rain that made the
[2:30:45] wheat live is what made the weed live
[2:30:48] it's not right he says no I'm letting
[2:30:51] off the pressure he said they all eat in
[2:30:52] the same pasture that's what the Bible
[2:30:53] says rain falls under justinly unjust
[2:30:56] people set together here's what I talk
[2:30:58] about Revival they set together crowds
[2:31:00] of people some of them are and some of
[2:31:02] them are not they all fall on The Same
[2:31:05] Spirit he said but the same spirit will
[2:31:07] bless the same crowd it'll fall the rain
[2:31:09] will fall in the cockle boat just as
[2:31:10] right and Street number Rejoice the same
[2:31:12] rain falls in a wheat and makes it but
[2:31:14] by their fruits you are known Christians
[2:31:16] so he says Christians bear Christian
[2:31:19] lives oh hallelujah what is the Holy
[2:31:21] Ghost given form amen getting ready to
[2:31:24] wind down now the church has come
[2:31:25] through these schools she married back
[2:31:28] Yonder a long time ago became a
[2:31:30] denomination an organization but you
[2:31:32] notice the birth produced something else
[2:31:34] and now it's got to a place where the
[2:31:37] Pentecostal Church where the New Birth
[2:31:38] has been tested and tried and and now
[2:31:40] it's come into a place Prophet said
[2:31:42] here's you said no God doesn't deal with
[2:31:44] the church just as an organization
[2:31:47] he doesn't just deal with the church as
[2:31:48] a group of people he deals with the
[2:31:51] church as an individuals
[2:31:54] individual in the church that's each of
[2:31:56] you here this morning I've got to be
[2:31:58] concerned about receiving your Holy
[2:32:01] Ghost about receiving your penny about
[2:32:03] you receiving your promise your portion
[2:32:06] Hallelujah that's how he's dealing with
[2:32:08] you
[2:32:09] your road and my road is two different
[2:32:11] Road
[2:32:12] praise God I might be able to go to some
[2:32:14] of the trials you go through you might
[2:32:16] be able to go through my trials but we
[2:32:18] all got trials we all got tests some to
[2:32:21] the waters some to the flood some two
[2:32:24] great trials but all through the blood
[2:32:27] oh Hallelujah isn't that right and God
[2:32:30] promised that when the enemy come in
[2:32:32] like a flood he raise up a standard
[2:32:35] against that enemy oh hallelujah
[2:32:37] hallelujah take the same word and stand
[2:32:41] against the enemy
[2:32:42] having done all to stand isn't that
[2:32:44] right oh my Hallelujah propaganda now
[2:32:48] it's got a time it's no secret we all
[2:32:50] see it that when a man proves and God
[2:32:53] loves him he takes him out somewhere to
[2:32:56] himself
[2:32:58] we're in the front of angels he does
[2:33:01] something for him he lifts him up there
[2:33:04] in the presence of God you can play
[2:33:06] something softly and Gifts him and fills
[2:33:09] him and sets him out the prophet said
[2:33:12] that's the age that we are living in do
[2:33:16] you believe it this morning that's this
[2:33:18] age we live in here now not what anybody
[2:33:20] else says I was doing but your
[2:33:22] individual walk with God where God take
[2:33:25] you over to the side God deal with you
[2:33:27] as an individual your trials your
[2:33:29] testing you overcome like David on the
[2:33:32] back side of the desert you fight your
[2:33:35] lion you fight your bear you meet your
[2:33:38] Goliath you conquer your enemy on any
[2:33:41] ground he comes upon and then God will
[2:33:44] place you over to the side and make you
[2:33:47] King over many things
[2:33:49] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh that's the
[2:33:53] age we're living in same holy spirit
[2:33:55] that saved the lutherans that sanctify
[2:33:58] the methodists that baptized the
[2:34:00] Pentecostals is Now setting in order the
[2:34:03] coming of the Lord Jesus when it'll be
[2:34:06] so powerful
[2:34:07] that body will come into this group a
[2:34:10] church that'll draw the rest of them
[2:34:12] from the grave you could begin to stand
[2:34:14] if you want said there'll be a
[2:34:15] resurrection
[2:34:17] that's what the Holy Ghost is for
[2:34:19] what is the Holy Ghost he said without
[2:34:21] us they cannot be made perfect
[2:34:23] oh do you believe it they lived in one
[2:34:26] day under that but we live in another
[2:34:28] day and when the enemy comes in like a
[2:34:30] flood he says the spirit of God will
[2:34:32] raise us standard against it see we're
[2:34:35] in a day now
[2:34:37] amen and amen is not right he said but
[2:34:40] now we need the spirit of God
[2:34:42] the spirit of God raises a standard he
[2:34:44] said what is it he's pouring in his
[2:34:47] spirit
[2:34:48] and then those who are resting out
[2:34:49] yonder in the grave or under the altar
[2:34:52] of God as it Scriptures as a crying he
[2:34:55] said how long Lord how long how much
[2:34:57] longer God is waiting on me he's waiting
[2:35:00] on you he said the church is waiting on
[2:35:03] me and you adoption time when God can
[2:35:07] pour into us his fullness his power his
[2:35:13] resurrection and then when the church
[2:35:15] and Christ become so close together till
[2:35:19] Christ becomes visible Among Us and
[2:35:22] raises the dead and then we go into the
[2:35:25] Rapture may the Lord richly bless you
[2:35:28] I'm finished this morning oh May the
[2:35:31] Holy Spirit pour out upon you may you
[2:35:34] receive your portion May virtue pour out
