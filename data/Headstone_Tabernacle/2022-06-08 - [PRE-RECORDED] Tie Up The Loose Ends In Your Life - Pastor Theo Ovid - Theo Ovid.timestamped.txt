[30:56] i remember thee and the kindness of thy
[30:58] youth the love thine disposals when the
[31:00] winters after me in the wilderness
[31:03] in the land that was not sown israel was
[31:05] holiness unto the lord and the first
[31:07] fruit of his increase all that devour
[31:09] him shall offend the evil shall come
[31:11] upon them saith the lord
[31:14] hear ye the word of the lord o house of
[31:15] jacob and all the families of the house
[31:17] of israel thus saith the lord what
[31:20] iniquity have your fathers found in me
[31:23] that they have gone far from me
[31:26] and i've walked after vanity and i
[31:28] become vain
[31:30] neither said they where is the lord that
[31:32] brought us out of the land of egypt that
[31:34] led us through the wilderness to a land
[31:36] of desert and of pits through a land of
[31:38] drought and
[31:39] shadow of death to a land that no man
[31:41] passed through
[31:42] where no man dwell
[31:44] and i brought you into a plentiful
[31:46] country to eat the fruit thereof and the
[31:48] goodness thereof and when you entered
[31:51] you defiled my land and made my heritage
[31:54] an abomination
[31:56] and the priest said not where is the
[31:58] lord
[31:59] and they that handle the lord knew me
[32:01] not the pastors also transgressed
[32:03] against me
[32:05] and the prophets prophesied by bear
[32:07] and walked after things that do not
[32:09] profit wherefore i would yet plead with
[32:12] you saith the lord and with your
[32:14] children's children will i plead for
[32:18] pass over the eyes of chittim and see
[32:20] senator keita consider diligently and
[32:23] see if there be such a thing at a nation
[32:25] change to gods which are yet no gods but
[32:28] my people have changed their glory for
[32:31] that which dot not profit
[32:33] be astonished o e heavens at this and be
[32:36] horribly afraid be very desolate say the
[32:39] lord for my people have committed
[32:42] two evils
[32:44] they have forsaken me the fountain of
[32:46] living waters
[32:47] and i've hewed them out
[32:50] systems
[32:51] broken systems that can hold no water
[32:55] or what a condition to be in after all
[32:57] these years
[32:59] and my spirit is still tonight
[33:01] because i
[33:03] i realize how far
[33:05] the church is from what god require and
[33:08] what god must have of us
[33:10] and we have to come up to line with
[33:12] god's requirement and god's program
[33:15] oh praise the name of the lord and i
[33:17] trust that all of you would have
[33:18] listened to the bible study we have was
[33:20] very important bible study about uh the
[33:23] will of god for you to be sanctified so
[33:25] if you have not listened to it please do
[33:28] amen
[33:29] but obama was praying
[33:31] and he was talking about men and
[33:33] position
[33:35] and then he switched to the ministers
[33:37] and as my brethren standing this morning
[33:39] i pray that each of these ministers and
[33:41] hear
[33:42] these
[33:43] ministering spirits that god hear my
[33:45] prayer and i pray that you will purge
[33:49] that gift that's in there
[33:53] purge
[33:55] that gift
[33:57] that is in them
[33:58] if they are preachers make them better
[34:00] preachers
[34:01] if the evangelists make them better
[34:03] evangelists if their teachers make them
[34:05] better teachers if their pastors make
[34:07] them better pastors god grant that
[34:10] they'll be filled with the spirit of god
[34:12] and they'll be energized by the great
[34:14] supervine
[34:16] that will give them life eternal and
[34:18] power to minister wit and to touch the
[34:21] needy world as it so needs today
[34:24] or give the lord some praises
[34:27] isn't that something
[34:29] you say forgive us of our shortcomings
[34:31] forgive us of our narrow-minded beliefs
[34:35] and little sectarian ideas and let us be
[34:37] baptized into one big brotherhood into
[34:40] one big fellowship that the kingdom of
[34:43] god might be furthered by our coming
[34:45] together this day we asking jesus what a
[34:47] prayer
[34:48] oh glory to god hallelujah
[34:52] thank you lord you love him tonight
[34:54] hallelujah
[34:56] and that's what the matter is if it's an
[34:58] order the church
[34:59] it's got the mechanics ready it only
[35:02] needs the dynamics tonight if we can get
[35:05] the mechanics ready
[35:06] get your hearts right
[35:09] here we go the things that we can do
[35:13] that's where i get that from
[35:15] get the mechanics ready our hearts right
[35:18] what is that the things
[35:21] that we can do then he said follow him
[35:23] in every word
[35:24] follow him baptism fall him in every
[35:27] order he told us to do get every
[35:29] mechanic ready and stand there then we
[35:32] are ready for the dynamics to be lit off
[35:34] and only god can do that and that's to
[35:36] drop into our hearts the fate that says
[35:39] i am now healed
[35:41] or give the lord some praises tonight
[35:44] so malachi 4 the scripture we read he
[35:47] came to tie up the loose ends in the
[35:50] church isn't that right that we could
[35:51] get a message that we could be prepared
[35:53] and be ready for the coming of the lord
[35:55] isn't that right
[35:56] hallelujah and god in the loose ends was
[35:59] to release what the power back in the
[36:00] church because god could only use the
[36:03] conduit of his word and because the word
[36:05] was scattered through seven ages he then
[36:07] seven ages from eternity to gather all
[36:10] that scattered word and bring it back
[36:12] and tie it back into the word that he
[36:14] can release the fullness of the holy
[36:15] ghost and the fullness of the holy ghost
[36:18] has visited the church making manifest
[36:20] luke 17 30 this son of man back again in
[36:23] this last day oh glory to god and i
[36:25] believe the angel of god the
[36:27] manifestation of the holy spirit is that
[36:29] angel trying to get the people back to
[36:31] the word because he can only vindicate
[36:33] the word
[36:34] and now he's here to gather up and tie
[36:37] all the loose ends in your life
[36:39] so tonight you have to be under
[36:41] expectation for your loosens for your
[36:44] looseness to be tied up because before
[36:46] you could get that full manifestation of
[36:48] introducing the messiah the 60 you have
[36:51] to tie up all the loose ends and before
[36:53] you get your portion before you get your
[36:55] inheritance before you get your baptism
[36:57] before you get your fire before you get
[36:59] your dynamics you have got to tie up the
[37:02] loose ends in your life
[37:04] oh give the lord some praises tonight
[37:07] hallelujah hallelujah
[37:08] he said he will do for you the same you
[37:10] don't want adoption if you will stand
[37:12] here we go after you receive the holy
[37:14] ghost and make yourself a christian you
[37:18] know born a christian you're the joint
[37:20] church and become a christian he said i
[37:22] make yourself a christian you have
[37:25] something to do because we give the lord
[37:26] a shout tonight
[37:28] make yourself a christian and act like a
[37:30] christian should if you put your faith
[37:32] in god's word and your eyes towards
[37:35] heaven and let your pants be batted at
[37:37] the knees and be reverent before god
[37:39] there will be someday that god will take
[37:42] you over to my side and give you a power
[37:45] and a gift that the whole world will
[37:47] know he's been with you
[37:51] placing a son in position
[37:53] oh blessed be the name of the lord you
[37:54] love him tonight
[38:04] so the bible said his wife
[38:06] not the jewish members
[38:09] the scripture his wife
[38:11] had made herself ready the church
[38:13] members will just continue on being
[38:14] church members but the wife she want to
[38:16] make
[38:20] herself
[38:21] ready
[38:23] so many says if the lord will take this
[38:25] evil spirit from me
[38:27] from drinking or from gambling or from
[38:30] lying or stealing i will serve him but
[38:33] that's up to you
[38:37] you see you have got something to
[38:39] something to do something too
[38:42] they don't overcome shall inherit all
[38:43] things they don't overcome you have
[38:46] power to do it
[38:49] that's the word now
[38:52] that is the word now i don't care what
[38:53] you feel or what you think this is the
[38:55] word now the word tell me that
[38:58] that you have power to do it
[39:00] the words say that
[39:02] and the word can't lie
[39:05] let your feelings be a lie tonight not
[39:08] that word that word is true
[39:14] you have power to do it
[39:15] but you must be willing to lay it down
[39:19] she has made herself ready
[39:22] oh my what i see
[39:24] and i'm seeing it more and more how far
[39:26] churches and and people has fell away
[39:28] from god fell away from the principles
[39:31] fell away from the spirit fell away from
[39:33] the expectation and it's all mechanical
[39:36] and intellectual and just tidy it's
[39:39] astonishing
[39:41] that's why god said in jeremiah is
[39:42] astonishment
[39:44] i bring you all to bless you and
[39:45] everything else and like my people leave
[39:47] and find other gods
[39:53] they leave me the living fountain to
[39:55] heal themselves systems broken systems
[39:59] that can hold no water
[40:01] they leave the living fountain
[40:04] you see god could not push us through a
[40:06] little pipe and pull us out the other
[40:09] side and say blessed is he that overcome
[40:11] it
[40:12] you have nothing to overcome
[40:14] so i want to rip the entitlement over
[40:16] you that you believe a message and
[40:18] you're entitled to what you're entitled
[40:19] to fight
[40:21] for every single inch that is what
[40:23] you're entitled to
[40:26] you're entitled to no rapture
[40:28] you're entitled to the resurrection
[40:30] you're entitled to leave here and we
[40:32] change the movement
[40:34] like the special thing not what the word
[40:35] saying here you have to have rapture in
[40:37] faith
[40:38] that's the ticket you have to have it
[40:40] to leave here who give the lord a shout
[40:43] not teach him you have to have that
[40:46] that's why he said malachi 4 to turn our
[40:49] hearts back to the faith of the fathers
[40:51] that are living faith
[40:52] that a living god that a reality a
[40:55] manifested reality of the glory of god
[40:58] was in their midst or give the lord a
[41:00] shout that that pearce in their spirit
[41:03] when they beat them they went back and
[41:04] pray and the building shook and they
[41:07] were refilled with the holy ghost that's
[41:09] why the prophet said the dynamic that
[41:10] this church will be a refilling of the
[41:12] holy ghost
[41:14] oh glory to god hallelujah get your soul
[41:16] on fire get your heart on fire ask
[41:20] yourself tonight what is it in my life
[41:22] that i have to do that must be done oh
[41:24] give the lord some praises
[41:27] hallelujah praise god you're with me
[41:29] tonight i want to drive it we have
[41:30] another time here i want to just drive
[41:32] it home you see god could not push us
[41:35] through a pipe and pull us out the other
[41:37] side and say blessed he'll overcome it
[41:39] you had nothing to overcome he just
[41:41] pushed you through but you've got to
[41:42] make decisions for yourself i have to
[41:45] make decisions for myself and in doing
[41:48] that we show our faith and respects to
[41:50] god
[41:52] oh glory to god and doing what i love
[41:53] decisions oh praise god it is because
[41:56] you see the fruit of your decisions you
[41:58] make a wrong decision you get messed up
[42:00] you make a right decision you see the
[42:01] fruit of that love decisions you have a
[42:04] decision to make tonight if any man
[42:06] don't want to follow after me he's not
[42:07] worthy of me oh glory to god you have to
[42:10] go after him and pick up your cross you
[42:12] have something to carry oh give the lord
[42:13] a shout tonight

[42:28] angle full one thing you'll get out of
[42:30] my mother's truth

[42:51] doing that we show his feet and our
[42:53] respects to god abraham was promised a
[42:57] child but he was maintained this promise
[42:59] for 25 years the ups and downs he had
[43:02] the temptations in those 25 years but he
[43:05] held to the world of promise and israel
[43:07] was promised a promised land but he had
[43:09] to fight for every inch of it wherever
[43:12] the sole of your foot tread upon that
[43:14] have i given to you go said to joshua it
[43:16] was all dear the lamb was there and god
[43:18] gave it to them but they had to fight
[43:20] for it and it's the same way it's about
[43:22] divine healing god has got the power to
[43:24] heal you if you've got the courage to
[43:26] accept it but you have to fight every
[43:28] inch of the way god has got amazing
[43:30] grace to save you and he will do it but
[43:33] you have to fight every inch of your way
[43:35] i've been behind the pulpit over 21
[43:38] years and every inch of that has been a
[43:40] fight constantly we must fight if we
[43:43] must reign so we find out the bride has
[43:45] to make ourselves ready be willing to
[43:47] lay aside every weight that does so

[51:11] to have power in it it's got to have
[51:13] sincerity
[51:15] sincerity
[51:17] brings power
[51:22] how could you be sincere when you're in
[51:24] iniquity
[51:26] or you could be sincere when you're
[51:27] doing the wrong thing
[51:30] all you can be sincere when you know
[51:31] your heart you're wrong
[51:33] you can't be sincere
[51:35] you could be sincere to repent
[51:37] and then you get right
[51:39] then you could ask god if you had
[51:42] condemned your god greater than your
[51:43] heart your own heart condemning you
[51:46] so god wants to release you from that
[51:48] condemnation to bring you into a
[51:49] cleansing that's why go back and listen
[51:52] and study back that message that we talk
[51:54] on tuesday
[51:56] about sanctification
[51:58] what god wants for your life and that is
[52:00] the will of god for your life
[52:02] sincerity brings power a long time you
[52:04] hear that like that sincerity that's why
[52:06] god tell the prophet what be more
[52:08] sincere when god examined the heart and
[52:10] god put all his instruments and so on
[52:12] everybody externally saying big prophet
[52:14] and prophet and prophet but when god put
[52:15] his binoculars and do his zoom zoom and
[52:17] zoom inside there he said i want you to
[52:19] be more sincere
[52:21] that is the realm of the spirit
[52:23] there's the realm of people getting
[52:24] delivered
[52:25] that's in that realm there
[52:27] and that was yes i sanctify myself for
[52:30] dear sake
[52:31] you have got to make a sacrifice you can
[52:33] sit down like you some king on some
[52:34] throne and god entitled to do this for
[52:36] you and do that for you god entitled do
[52:38] nothing for you he entitled me send a
[52:40] prophet
[52:41] and he shall turn half and he put a
[52:43] message here for us to take and apply or
[52:45] give the lord a shout he said hear me
[52:47] when i'm taminacker not talking about is
[52:49] the token you've got to apply the token
[52:52] oh glory to god and the token have to be
[52:53] displayed
[52:55] not just applied but displayed it means
[52:57] that you have to take it act upon it and
[52:59] then you have to have it so activated
[53:01] it's had to come back out to you
[53:03] to reflect the very thing that you apply
[53:07] sincerity brings real worship not forms
[53:11] but genuine
[53:12] power worship to know your past from
[53:15] debt and to life
[53:16] god wants to perform his word by his
[53:18] power and when the church denies his
[53:20] power how can he perform and vindicate
[53:22] his word when the church explains it
[53:25] away and say from some other day
[53:27] who wants to fulfill that word
[53:29] oh hallelujah

[58:06] that we don't have it
[58:08] hard enough always the chain is as
[58:10] strong as the weakest link
[58:12] so you have a nice strong chain there's
[58:14] a big chain oh
[58:16] but you know how strong it is
[58:17] once under your devil jabbing on
[58:24] and when he hit your soul and you see a
[58:25] reaction he said aha i know i know where
[58:27] to hit them now
[58:31] that's the part you have to protect
[58:34] because he party enemy coming for
[58:36] he knows he know where they hit you
[58:40] and where just where you're weak is
[58:41] where you coming to get you
[58:43] you come in strong you put big burger
[58:45] proof in front there and you have a back
[58:46] door the back day that don't have
[58:48] nothing there
[58:49] you think you're making it hard for
[58:50] himself
[58:52] so he go get blue torches torched in
[58:54] front in front of it and he have an
[58:55] entrance back there just open entrance
[58:57] and come in
[58:58] because you did that
[59:00] you didn't secure that back door
[59:03] the front door because every person will
[59:05] see in front secure but what they didn't
[59:07] secure was the back door
[59:09] you have to tie up the loose ends
[59:12] could we say amen
[59:15] all right
[59:16] a man under pressure is what he is when
[59:18] he's under pressure his real true
[59:21] characteristics will show when he's
[59:23] under pressure
[59:24] get him all riled up and stir it up you
[59:26] will see the real man come out if he got
[59:28] temper it will show itself if he's meek
[59:30] and gentle a ritual itself put him under
[59:32] pressure once and god puts all his
[59:36] children
[59:37] on the test
[59:38] to see whether there is any flaws in
[59:40] them
[59:41] flaws
[59:44] before the test this flows i mean that's
[59:46] coming to expose more flows go the
[59:48] position intestine to embarrass you know
[59:51] you got to know where the floors are at
[59:53] to tie it up
[59:57] to get it covered
[59:59] to get protected
[1:00:01] you're the story your life speaks to
[1:00:03] lord i can't hear your words
[1:00:04] whatever you are the life that you live
[1:00:06] shows what kind of spirit is in you
[1:00:09] you may impersonate the wrong thing or
[1:00:11] impersonate the writing
[1:00:13] you may impersonate a christian
[1:00:15] but they will by and by come a time
[1:00:17] when the strain will be put on
[1:00:20] then it will show what you are a chain
[1:00:22] is as strong
[1:00:24] as its weakest link
[1:00:26] so then you talk about the virtues now
[1:00:27] this is why he's such a perfect man he's
[1:00:29] talking about no matter how strong this
[1:00:32] is built up and that is built up if he
[1:00:33] got a weak link there's where she breaks
[1:00:36] so you could be strong in faith i'm
[1:00:38] gonna fit you're speaking in word and
[1:00:39] whatnot and then
[1:00:41] you see temperance whoo
[1:00:44] when you see that devil recognize that
[1:00:46] temperature is trouble oh patience oh
[1:00:48] god but that you never ride in a boy and
[1:00:50] you get your blowing
[1:00:52] because your steam run out of patience
[1:00:54] you see patients just trying to practice
[1:00:55] all the time it runs straight out it'll
[1:00:57] leak out
[1:00:58] that's why the bible calls for charity
[1:01:00] to burn the perfectness to seal the
[1:01:02] whole building that there will be no
[1:01:04] leaks in the building
[1:01:05] at your feet virtue and knowledge and
[1:01:07] after that charity the come now and come

[1:01:19] anvil oh glory to god when you start to
[1:01:21] walk like that devil's
[1:01:23] fall into the right and throwing off
[1:01:24] yourself to the left they alter your way

[1:01:34] jurisdiction and just as adam devil
[1:01:36] could mess with adam before eve come on

[1:01:54] their word creates them just like that
[1:01:56] oh glory to god and our jurisdiction
[1:01:59] every devilish subject to the sons of
[1:02:01] god has that have been positionally
[1:02:03] placed with the pillar fire veiled all
[1:02:06] glory to god
[1:02:07] what a thing to look forward to
[1:02:09] what a thing to expect hallelujah they
[1:02:12] ought to be nobody tired and they
[1:02:14] struggling and they automatic or you're
[1:02:16] supposed to have great expectations
[1:02:20] hallelujah of course a lot of
[1:02:21] directing's going to come hallelujah
[1:02:23] nations against nation wars and rumors
[1:02:26] of wars earthquakes and diverse places
[1:02:28] pestilence and all kinds of stuff but

[1:02:33] shall the end come no no coming until
[1:02:36] this gospel is preached
[1:02:38] oh glory to god and the only way this
[1:02:40] gospel is preached is a bright
[1:02:41] positionally placed with power
[1:02:43] the preacher's gospel with signs one of
[1:02:45] the miracles reproducing the original
[1:02:47] grain
[1:02:48] proving he boosted in it that jesus
[1:02:50] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:02:52] forever oh give the lord some praises
[1:02:55] tonight
[1:02:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:58] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:03:00] so you have to have all these virtues
[1:03:02] inside of there he said when you
[1:03:03] surrender your complete being then the
[1:03:05] holy spirit just pours through you
[1:03:08] watch in these virtues you are living

[1:03:17] flowing through you why because all the
[1:03:19] virtues inside of you so he's using his
[1:03:21] own word or glory not no flesh and blood
[1:03:23] trying to play a tango or trying a
[1:03:25] little thing it's not that is the holy
[1:03:27] spirit flowing through the word inside
[1:03:29] of you you become a conduit you become a
[1:03:31] branch and divine life is flowing
[1:03:33] through you they preproduce fruit
[1:03:36] that's a man full of virtue then people

[1:03:41] knowledge he believes the word
[1:03:42] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:03:45] kindness full of love of of the holy
[1:03:46] ghost what is it a stature that the
[1:03:49] unbelievers can look and say there's a
[1:03:51] christian
[1:03:52] there's a man or woman who knows what
[1:03:55] they're talking about you've never seen
[1:03:57] a kinder sweeter godly person you are
[1:04:00] sealed i see your shoes on both sides
[1:04:02] whether you're coming or going you are
[1:04:04] sealed just the same there you are when
[1:04:06] a man or woman possesses this
[1:04:09] then the capstone comes down and sees
[1:04:12] them into the kingdom of god which is
[1:04:14] the holy ghost
[1:04:16] i know you don't have taught much but
[1:04:18] when a man possesses this what this fate
[1:04:20] of birthday kindness then they kept
[1:04:22] showing charity the holy ghost itself
[1:04:23] comes down seal the man inside the idea
[1:04:26] then that must speak for itself as
[1:04:27] christ failed
[1:04:29] oh hallelujah
[1:04:30] oh glory to god
[1:04:33] hallelujah
[1:04:34] now to fix a problem
[1:04:37] you have to recognize that the problem
[1:04:39] exists
[1:04:44] i think that would say in a game
[1:04:46] to fix any problem
[1:04:49] you have to understand a problem exists
[1:04:51] because if you don't think the problem
[1:04:53] exists you can't fix it
[1:04:58] you can't fix if you don't know there's
[1:05:00] a problem
[1:05:03] but david said i acknowledge my
[1:05:06] transgression
[1:05:08] and my sin is before me
[1:05:10] so the first thing is to identify and
[1:05:13] acknowledge your loose ends
[1:05:17] no that's not my losers are yours
[1:05:20] i am mind satire
[1:05:22] everybody have their own to type
[1:05:25] i'm not hearing you
[1:05:26] whether you say amen or not you still
[1:05:28] have to tie it up
[1:05:29] because if you don't tie it up the devil
[1:05:31] will tie you up
[1:05:33] or give the lord a shout as either you
[1:05:35] tie up your loose ends or the devil tie
[1:05:37] you up because enticing spirits and the
[1:05:39] chaos conspiracy going to follow loose
[1:05:41] ends
[1:05:47] identify the loose ends and deal with
[1:05:50] them by the word
[1:05:52] hallelujah
[1:05:54] hallelujah
[1:05:56] oh glory to god
[1:05:58] but
[1:05:59] as human nature we avoid or deny
[1:06:03] many times we go into denial we don't
[1:06:05] want to accept this is so
[1:06:08] this is how we going through or this is
[1:06:10] what taking us or this one overtaking us
[1:06:12] we don't want to admit it
[1:06:14] hallelujah
[1:06:16] loose ends can be spiritual
[1:06:19] physical
[1:06:20] emotional
[1:06:22] intellectual
[1:06:24] or logical
[1:06:26] sometimes it's not a pleasant thing
[1:06:29] loose sense is what we push aside
[1:06:31] loose sense is what you don't want to
[1:06:32] deal with right loosen the watch your
[1:06:34] pivot asleep and to deal with it
[1:06:37] so you sleep longer
[1:06:40] why do these people just go and drink
[1:06:42] why do people go on booze
[1:06:44] they're certainly loose ends and issues
[1:06:46] that they don't want to deal with
[1:06:48] so when they're drinking
[1:06:49] with friends and
[1:06:51] big loving
[1:06:53] but it's loose ends inside of there
[1:06:56] eating them up
[1:06:57] and the pain
[1:06:58] like a store pain the rum shop or
[1:07:00] whatever it is and the pain and the pain
[1:07:02] and the pain all they'll do is to get
[1:07:04] rid of them loosens and get them sprayed
[1:07:06] off for them and they're free and no
[1:07:08] more money going for cigarette no more
[1:07:09] money going for booze no more money for
[1:07:11] those kind of things because they're
[1:07:14] getting satisfaction guaranteed by that
[1:07:17] living fountain
[1:07:19] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:07:22] hallelujah
[1:07:23] so you have to deal with the loose ends
[1:07:26] you have to bring the looseness to
[1:07:27] completion you have to finish you have
[1:07:30] to meet the demands of what it demands
[1:07:32] of you

[1:08:18] hidden for years whatever it means
[1:08:21] it means to tie up
[1:08:23] those loose ends
[1:08:24] oh hallelujah
[1:08:26] could we continue a little more
[1:08:29] god tempered this bright together with
[1:08:31] the spirit the tempest the individual
[1:08:33] together with that spirit when you are
[1:08:34] born into that kingdom very life that is
[1:08:37] in his church that wasn't life was in
[1:08:39] the vine jesus is inside of you isn't
[1:08:42] that right
[1:08:43] what body do you belong to the body of
[1:08:45] christ i want to skip down and watch she
[1:08:47] said no watch
[1:08:49] there can be a leak up here somewhere
[1:08:50] there can be a leak in your patience let
[1:08:52] somebody smite you on one side of the
[1:08:54] face and you turn the other one but you
[1:08:56] say that dirty hypocrite then there's a
[1:08:57] leak somewhere so you see somebody smite
[1:08:59] here and then it's exposed where you're
[1:09:01] leaking
[1:09:02] he said we better leave that alone now
[1:09:04] when you are sealed into the the body of
[1:09:06] christ then you are spirit-filled and
[1:09:08] you are son of god now when closing
[1:09:12] i might say this
[1:09:14] anything different from this is a broken
[1:09:17] system
[1:09:18] and will finally leak out what you put
[1:09:20] in it
[1:09:21] if you're putting all your hopes all
[1:09:24] your time and everything in one of those
[1:09:26] stagnated systems they are broken
[1:09:28] systems and they will leak out
[1:09:31] their people put their hopes in churches
[1:09:34] hopes and pastors and ministers they
[1:09:36] hope not in christ
[1:09:38] and they will be disappointed
[1:09:40] because man will feel them
[1:09:42] and churches will feel them but jesus
[1:09:46] never fails
[1:09:48] so your hope has to be built in jesus
[1:09:50] christ
[1:09:51] and his righteousness isn't that right
[1:09:54] hallelujah
[1:09:55] oh blessed be the name of the lord

[1:16:45] not right wind up why your life is not
[1:16:47] right
[1:16:48] why you cannot take communion something
[1:16:50] is wrong
[1:16:51] resolution in your life
[1:16:53] because everybody's supposed to take
[1:16:54] communion
[1:16:56] and the only reason that you're not
[1:16:57] taking it is because something is wrong
[1:16:59] in your life

[1:17:04] deal with that
[1:17:06] get right with god and partake of the
[1:17:08] bread
[1:17:09] another wine
[1:17:11] remember this christ
[1:17:13] in the true church is a continuation of
[1:17:15] the book of acts and the book of
[1:17:17] revelation shows how the antichrist
[1:17:19] spirit would come into the church and
[1:17:21] defile it making it how lukewarm
[1:17:24] formal
[1:17:25] and powerless
[1:17:26] it exposes satan revealing his works uh
[1:17:30] the attempted destruction of god's
[1:17:32] people and he and and he fights and and
[1:17:34] right down to the time he's cast a lake
[1:17:36] of fire he fights that he cannot stand
[1:17:39] it he knows here we go if the people get
[1:17:42] the true revelation of the true church
[1:17:45] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:17:48] that she can do the greater works she
[1:17:51] will be an invincible army if they get a
[1:17:54] true revelation of the two spirits
[1:17:57] working within the framework of the
[1:17:58] christian church and by god's spirit
[1:18:01] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:18:03] spirit and i was thinking about this
[1:18:05] thing about this word design and how
[1:18:07] there's such a great need of this
[1:18:08] illness because you haven't determined
[1:18:10] will protect you
[1:18:11] from spirits and deceivers
[1:18:13] ask god for discernment discernment of
[1:18:16] spirit
[1:18:17] oh hallelujah
[1:18:18] by god's spirit discern and withstand
[1:18:21] the antichrist spirit satan will be
[1:18:22] powerless before her he will be
[1:18:24] definitely tortured today as when christ
[1:18:26] withstood his every effort to gain power
[1:18:28] over him in the desert yes satan hates
[1:18:30] revelation but we love it where true
[1:18:33] revelation allies the gates of hell
[1:18:35] cannot prevail against it but we will
[1:18:38] prevail against them oh glory to god
[1:18:42] when the church
[1:18:44] allowed herself
[1:18:46] to move away from the original like adam
[1:18:49] and eve dead setting
[1:18:51] there was no strength in her she has
[1:18:54] become a monstrosity
[1:18:56] the minute the church moved towards form
[1:19:00] and ceremony and towards priesthood by
[1:19:03] organizing the ministers into a group
[1:19:05] that decided leadership apart from the
[1:19:08] holy spirit and his word that very
[1:19:10] moment death entered
[1:19:12] and she started to get sick
[1:19:15] and as she got sick here we go
[1:19:18] she changed to a powerless group of
[1:19:21] people whose only weapon was argument
[1:19:29] only weapon
[1:19:31] i write you wrong mysteries you do have
[1:19:33] none
[1:19:34] i have this you have that you have this
[1:19:36] only argument
[1:19:38] she could produce nothing in the spirit
[1:19:41] for her hopes were built on program and
[1:19:43] not faith in his word they sold program
[1:19:46] they reprogrammed the sword perversion
[1:19:49] the re-perverted children
[1:19:51] so whatever you need to do
[1:19:54] to close and to tie up that loose end
[1:19:57] go do it
[1:19:59] i ain't talking about talking all this
[1:20:01] is getting into action this is you
[1:20:03] confronting yourself and sitting down
[1:20:06] because our enemy come in
[1:20:07] and you have to know how you're going to
[1:20:09] wage war
[1:20:10] and if you have what it takes to deal
[1:20:12] with what's coming
[1:20:15] don't think it's business as usual
[1:20:18] this coronavirus confirm is not business
[1:20:21] as usual
[1:20:22] all demoting is business assurance they
[1:20:24] can flood fair
[1:20:25] it is not business as usual
[1:20:29] okay
[1:20:31] i'm finished
[1:20:33] you could play something
[1:20:37] what a loose sense
[1:20:39] the untidy stuff
[1:20:41] the area of weakness
[1:20:43] the area
[1:20:45] of leakage
[1:20:47] and when
[1:20:48] those areas are tighter
[1:20:50] the weakness disappears
[1:20:53] and you feel that strength
[1:20:56] coming back to you
[1:20:58] again
[1:21:00] hallelujah
[1:21:01] illusion in the garment or dress
[1:21:04] a area of weakness that make you dress
[1:21:06] weak
[1:21:07] and it provokes the avenue for further
[1:21:09] weakness
[1:21:11] when the devil find that weak spot and
[1:21:13] he hit your deer he come back again
[1:21:17] he want to break you
[1:21:19] and destroy you
[1:21:22] that leakage
[1:21:24] is where you lose
[1:21:26] the energy
[1:21:28] where you become less productive
[1:21:31] keeps you in a depressed mode
[1:21:34] you just don't know
[1:21:36] what to do
[1:21:37] you just don't have the strength and
[1:21:38] everything else

[1:21:54] and to deal with them
[1:21:57] whether it's painful
[1:21:59] whether it's difficult whether it's
[1:22:01] unpleasant you still have to deal
