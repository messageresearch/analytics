[4:41] 111
[4:43] for scripture reading. And then we'd
[4:45] like to offer a word of prayer tonight.
[4:49] Commit the service into the hands of the
[4:51] Lord.

[4:52] &gt;&gt; That his spirit could move upon us

[5:02] We keep that song. Move in this place

[5:07] Psalm chapter 111
[5:10] says, "Praise ye the Lord. I will praise
[5:14] the Lord with my whole heart in the
[5:17] assembly of the upright and in the
[5:19] congregation.
[5:21] The works of the Lord are great, sought
[5:24] out of all them that have pleasure
[5:26] therein.
[5:27] His work is honorable and glorious, and
[5:30] his righteousness endureth forever.
[5:33] He hath made his wonderful works to be
[5:36] remembered. The Lord is gracious and
[5:40] full of compassion. He had given meat
[5:43] unto them that fear him. He will ever be
[5:46] mindful of his covenant. He had showed
[5:49] his people the power of his works that
[5:52] he may give them the heritage of the
[5:54] heathen. The works of his hands are
[5:56] verity and judgment, and all his
[5:59] commandments are sure. They stand fast
[6:02] forever and ever and are done in truth
[6:06] and uprightness. He sent redemption unto
[6:09] his people. He had commanded his
[6:11] covenant forever. Holy and reverent is
[6:14] his name.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[6:17] wisdom. A good understanding have all
[6:20] they that do his commandments. His
[6:23] praise endureth forever.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; God bless his word tonight. We believe
[6:29] it and we will pray now together. Why
[6:31] don't you just lift your hands and pray
[6:33] together as we pray and uh as we release
[6:36] our faith into the atmosphere tonight,
[6:39] &gt;&gt; let us pray and and and call upon him
[6:42] &gt;&gt; that he would answer at a time of his
[6:44] choosing tonight.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Almighty God, Lord, we come into
[6:49] your house tonight. We come, Lord, from
[6:52] different places, Lord, different parts,

[38:30] You appreciate the Lord.
[38:33] [Music]
[38:36] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[38:43] We have a prayer request we want to take
[38:46] to the Lord. And
[38:48] please pray for my nephew who was
[38:50] battling for his life in an ICU with
[38:52] sickle cell anemia from sister Elizabeth
[38:55] Pinkra. And maybe there's someone in the
[38:57] room tonight with a need. Maybe for you,
[39:00] maybe for a loved one. And as we
[39:02] approach the throne of grace tonight,
[39:04] knowing that God is more than able. He
[39:06] is still a healer. He is still a
[39:08] restorer. He is still able to replace
[39:11] the missing limbs as the prophet said.
[39:14] He is able to turn back what body issues
[39:18] you have had. High blood pressure, low
[39:20] blood pressure, diabetic. It doesn't
[39:22] matter what the situation is. He is the
[39:24] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Shall we approach the throne of grace?
[39:28] Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord for
[39:31] Lord your presence that's here. Father,
[39:33] you have taught us through your word
[39:34] that Lord, where there are two or three
[39:36] gathered in your name, there you are in
[39:37] the midst of them. And we thank you for
[39:39] your August presence that's here. We
[39:41] thank you for the believers who have
[39:43] come from near and far father to do one
[39:45] thing to lift the name of Jesus higher.
[39:47] Father Lord in this age of darkness
[39:50] where gross darkness is upon the earth
[39:52] and upon the people Lord we are Lord
[39:55] commissioned by the word to arise and
[39:56] shine for our light is come. And father
[39:59] we come and unite in faith Lord for Lord
[40:02] this nephew of sister Pinkra Lord
[40:04] battling for life in the ICU knowing
[40:06] Lord that Lord Lazarus was dealt with
[40:09] and Lord there are so many situation in
[40:11] the scripture where you are proven
[40:12] yourself time and time again. We pray
[40:14] dear God that the angel of the Lord will
[40:16] visit him right now. May you touch him
[40:18] from the crown of his head to the souls
[40:20] of his feet Lord. Father, for every hand
[40:22] that was raised here in the tabernacle,
[40:24] those that are connected online, Father,
[40:27] you know, every need, every situation,
[40:29] every problem, whatever it is, Father,
[40:31] we bring it to you knowing that you are
[40:33] more than able, Father. Lord, may you
[40:35] touch your people one more time. May you
[40:37] give us a charge in the supernatural.
[40:40] Lord, we were so blessed in the service
[40:42] this afternoon, Lord. We pray you
[40:43] strengthen your servant with Hashem.
[40:46] Lord, 80 years old standing in the
[40:48] pulpit, Father, and preaching like just
[40:50] as he was a young man, Father, Lord, may
[40:52] you strengthen your servant in this
[40:54] season. We thank you for the love gifts
[40:56] in the body. We thank you for Brother
[40:57] Joash. And Lord, we thank you for what
[40:59] you're about to do tonight. Father, may
[41:01] you lift us even higher. Father, may you
[41:04] give your people a charge in the
[41:05] supernatural. Lord, we are not a normal
[41:07] people. Father, you called us for such a
[41:09] time as this. If there's a backslider in
[41:11] our midst, may tonight be their night.
[41:13] If there's someone sick, may they have a
[41:15] testimony that while Peter yet spake
[41:18] these words, healing poured out. The
[41:20] Holy Ghost poured out, deliverance
[41:22] poured out. May you touch the fathers,
[41:24] may you touch the mothers, may you touch
[41:26] the children, may you touch the
[41:28] visitors, may you touch every single
[41:30] believer in the mighty precious name of
[41:32] Jesus Christ. And when it is over, we'll
[41:34] say, "It was good to have been here." We
[41:36] commit this service into your hands in
[41:38] the precious name of Jesus Christ. And
[41:39] the church says,
[41:40] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And amen. You may be
[41:44] seated for a few minutes.
[41:46] Certainly a great privilege to be here
[41:48] tonight in the presence of the Lord. One
[41:50] more time. There's no place we'd rather
[41:52] be than in the house of the Lord. When
[41:55] God's people gather themselves together
[41:56] and call on Jesus, something is about to
[41:58] happen. Hallelujah. Something is about
[42:01] to take place because you are here. This
[42:03] gospel is about you and I, friends. We
[42:06] are here to cause something to happen.
[42:08] But the Brandham said they got to do
[42:09] something for something to happen. It
[42:11] doesn't matter how you came in, how you
[42:12] feeling. It doesn't matter. He's the
[42:14] same yesterday. But the Brandham said if
[42:16] the people get into one minor and one
[42:17] accord in 5 minutes, there'll not be a
[42:20] feeble person in the room. May this be
[42:22] that kind of a service. Can the church
[42:24] say amen?
[42:26] &gt;&gt; So I'm just here to welcome you tonight.
[42:28] On behalf of our host, Pastor Bovit, I'd
[42:30] like to welcome one and all to the
[42:32] second service of the convention and to
[42:34] salute the portion of the body of Christ
[42:37] that's here. We certainly want to
[42:39] acknowledge all of the visitors and in
[42:41] particular we want to acknowledge uh
[42:43] some of the ministers who already
[42:44] announced uh in the first service. But
[42:47] to add to the ministers that uh came
[42:49] from overseas, how many appreciate our
[42:51] president Charles Akachchobee from
[42:53] Inugu, Nigeria? He's here with his wife
[42:56] and his daughter and his son. God bless
[42:59] you, brother Charles. Certainly happy to
[43:01] have you here with us. We want to
[43:03] acknowledge our precious brother, Olu
[43:05] Yimbo. God bless you, brother Olu.
[43:08] We love you. We appreciate you.
[43:12] And there are a number of ministers that
[43:14] are here from uh his church with him as
[43:16] well. Brother Andrew Alasa, God bless
[43:18] you.
[43:21] Brother Tuks, God bless you. Absolutely.
[43:24] Wonderful to have you here as well.
[43:27] Brother Emmy,
[43:29] don't hide in the front.
[43:32] God bless you. Certainly a great
[43:35] blessing and a privilege uh to be here.
[43:38] And we certainly want to also
[43:40] acknowledge uh some of the local
[43:42] ministers that are also here this
[43:44] evening with us. Uh precious brother
[43:47] Terren Tornel. God bless you, brother
[43:48] Tornel.
[43:50] We appreciate you. your wife for being
[43:53] here with us this evening. We also
[43:55] recognize brother Roland Samuel is here
[43:57] as well. God bless you, brother Roland.
[44:00] And his wife also, brother MelchzDC and
[44:03] his wife. God bless you. Welcome. We are
[44:06] so happy to have you here with us by the
[44:08] grace of God. We thank God.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know somebody's hiding.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Harry. Brother Harry is hiding.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Harry.
[44:24] So good to have you here with us and uh
[44:26] certainly want to salute our precious
[44:28] brother Yadel Thornill who is here on
[44:29] the platform with us. We're going to
[44:31] hear a greeting from him. He has always
[44:34] been a blessing. You you love and
[44:35] appreciate our brother Yadel Tornill.
[44:38] Amen.
[44:40] And tonight our minister tonight will be
[44:43] brother Stephanus Colen Brener from
[44:44] Germany. How many appreciate brother
[44:46] Stephanus
[44:49] a true son and servant of the Lord with
[44:52] a humble heart dedicated to the people
[44:54] of God and we are so grateful for every
[44:57] single one all the churches all the
[44:59] believers that are here. We love you. We
[45:01] appreciate you. We salute you. There's
[45:03] only one Lord. There's one faith, one
[45:05] baptism. We have one enemy and that
[45:07] enemy is going to be destroyed before we
[45:10] leave this place. In my heart as the
[45:13] children of Israel were leaving Egypt,
[45:15] it was not just they were not leaving
[45:17] one hoof behind. And I don't believe
[45:19] we're leaving one young person behind.
[45:21] We're leaving no family behind. The
[45:23] prophet taught us all that we love or
[45:25] loved us is going to be there. We are
[45:26] taking them. We are arresting them. And
[45:29] I believe God has raised up men of God
[45:31] like Stephanus and Yadel who will drive
[45:34] this message to the coming of the Lord.
[45:36] So as brother Yadel gets ready to come
[45:38] to the platform to greet before brother
[45:40] Stephanus preaches let's just sing that
[45:42] song only believe
[45:44] only believe all things are possible
[45:48] only
[45:51] believe
[45:54] [Music]
[46:02] all things are possible
[46:05] All
[46:07] things are possible.
[46:15] [Music]
[46:28] I'm falling.
[46:30] [Music]
[46:41] Oh,
[46:43] there.
[46:45] [Music]
[46:50] Oh.
[46:54] [Music]
[46:57] Hallelujah.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; How we give him praise and thanks. We
[47:02] thank you father
[47:04] presence with us. The privilege to be
[47:06] gathered in your house tonight.
[47:10] May you bless your people. Bless these
[47:12] few words is our prayer. In the name of
[47:14] our loving Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[47:16] we pray.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. Amen. and greetings in
[47:20] the wonderful name of our Lord and
[47:22] Savior Jesus Christ.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; What a privilege it is to be with you
[47:25] all again one more time by God's grace
[47:28] to see brethren of like precious faith.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we all come for one motive is
[47:34] to be drawn closer to him.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; At the end we see no man save Jesus and
[47:38] him glorified amongst us.
[47:41] So we thank brother Tio and the
[47:44] headstone tabernacle on this side for
[47:47] allowing us the opportunity to be here.
[47:49] If we have our Bibles we just want to
[47:51] take a little portion of scripture
[47:53] reading before we have our seats taking
[47:56] from St. John chapter 8, it says verse
[47:59] one, then Jesus went unto the mount of
[48:01] olives, and early in the morning he came
[48:03] again to the temple, and all the people
[48:04] came unto him, and he sat down and
[48:07] taught them. And the scribes and
[48:10] Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken
[48:13] in adultery. And when they had set her
[48:16] in the midst, they said unto him,
[48:17] Master, this woman was taken in adultery
[48:20] in the very act. Now Moses
[48:24] in the law commanded us that such should
[48:26] be stoned. But what sails thou?
[48:31] This said they tempting him that they
[48:33] might have to accuse him. But Jesus
[48:36] stooped down and with his finger
[48:39] wrote on the ground as though he heard
[48:41] them not.
[48:45] So when they had continued asking him,
[48:47] he lifted up himself and said unto them,
[48:51] he that is without sin among you, let
[48:54] him first cast a stone at her.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; And again he stooped down and wrote on
[49:00] the ground. And they which heard it,
[49:02] being convicted by their own conscience,
[49:05] went out one by one, beginning at the
[49:08] eldest,
[49:09] &gt;&gt; even unto the last. And Jesus was left
[49:13] alone and the woman standing in the
[49:15] midst.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus lifted up himself, he saw
[49:20] none but the woman? And he said unto
[49:23] her,"Woman,
[49:25] where are those thine accusers? Had no
[49:28] man condemned thee?" She said, "No man,
[49:30] Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither
[49:35] do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more."
[49:40] Hallelujah.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; How we love him tonight. May the Lord
[49:43] add his blessing to the reading of the
[49:44] word. We may be seated.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; What a lovely scene that God has given
[49:52] us here in the book of St. John chapter
[49:54] 8. And uh we know that
[49:59] John was the eagle.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; All right. We had Matthew, Mark, Luke,
[50:04] and John. These four zone you had
[50:07] Matthew was the lion. We had Mark was
[50:12] the ox.
[50:14] We had Luke the scribe.
[50:17] That was the man.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; And we had John was the eagle.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; He was the one lifted up the highest.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Brother, he saw our day.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; He saw the bride. He saw the new
[50:26] Jerusalem. Hallelujah. The one that knew
[50:29] the love secrets of God. And here was
[50:32] John writing and God in ordaining the
[50:35] chapters
[50:37] John gave us a scene here that he God
[50:40] allow him to write
[50:42] &gt;&gt; and we know John was a man of love.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; So in God gave a story here through John
[50:48] and he say all the chapters you put in
[50:50] it put it in the eighth chapter.
[50:52] Hallelujah. Because God is specific
[50:54] about his numbers.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; God is in nature. He's in numerology
[50:59] &gt;&gt; brother.
[51:00] So God knew that eight is a number of
[51:03] eternity. Eight speaks of new
[51:05] beginnings.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Eight cries you back to the first.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; So we saw in Genesis chapter 8, Noah,
[51:14] brother, eight souls were saved
[51:16] &gt;&gt; to make it over into the new land.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; And in Genesis chapter 8 is when they
[51:20] left that old earth and they entered
[51:22] into the new land,
[51:24] &gt;&gt; brother. And Noah offered an offering up
[51:26] to God. So God is in numerology.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Put this eight inside of
[51:32] here."
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Because something new starting here.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; It looked like a a a story that look a
[51:39] kind of a how adulterous woman.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; But it was something new that God wanted
[51:44] to do with her.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; What I could say here tonight, I want to
[51:48] type her brother as part of the bride.
[51:53] It might be hard to say but I don't
[51:56] believe she was a serpent seed
[51:58] &gt;&gt; because a serpent seed they they are not
[52:01] considered in redemption.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Redemption is only for predestinated
[52:06] seed.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Serpent seed cannot be forgiven.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; So to hear go thy way and sin no more.
[52:15] Esau can hear that.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Judas can hear that. Hallelujah. But she
[52:20] could have heard that. So I want to
[52:22] place her among the bride.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; And God said, "Put it in the eighth
[52:27] chapter because this is a new
[52:29] beginning."
[52:31] &gt;&gt; And in this chapter, the scene starts
[52:33] off not down in a valley, but up on a
[52:36] mountaintop.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; On the Mount of Olives.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a place to be.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; This is the mount from where the
[52:43] ascension took place.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; This is the mount on which brother Jesus
[52:48] wept. David years before wept over
[52:51] Jerusalem
[52:52] &gt;&gt; on this mount,
[52:54] &gt;&gt; oh Jerusalem. So that was the mama eagle
[52:57] longing to hover
[52:58] &gt;&gt; over her brood.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; And they would not.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; But here was a little eagle. Hallelujah.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; That was predestinated in God's mind to
[53:08] respond to mama eagle.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; And they met up on a mountain top.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; What a place to be.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. on this mount of olives
[53:19] &gt;&gt; because there are great things
[53:21] prophesied for here.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Zachchariah shows us this mountain will
[53:24] cleave
[53:24] &gt;&gt; and that city will push up from this
[53:26] mountain.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the bride was brought to
[53:30] this city to this place and Jesus taught
[53:33] in the temple very early in the morning.
[53:36] So it was a sunrise.
[53:39] Hallelujah.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; It was a rising of the sun on that
[53:42] morning. And here was an adulterous
[53:45] woman brought into his presence.
[53:47] at the rising of the sun. Hallelujah.
[53:51] [Applause]
[53:52] &gt;&gt; But what brought it there were accusers.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; There were people seemingly using the
[53:58] law of Moses. So they knew God for what
[54:01] he was,
[54:03] &gt;&gt; but they couldn't recognize him for what
[54:04] he is.
[54:06] Hallelujah.
[54:08] The present tense God made flesh amongst
[54:10] them. They couldn't have that
[54:12] revelation.
[54:14] So they said Moses in the law said that
[54:18] such should be stoned.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Now you realize what happened.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; It takes two people to commit the act.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; But here we saw one person.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; You see, but that wasn't important.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; You were the one that was important.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; So he come to take one of a household,
[54:40] one of a family.
[54:42] The important thing is not how you came
[54:44] or who brought you but the important
[54:46] thing is coming.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; So the accusers seemingly religious
[54:51] people
[54:53] &gt;&gt; brought her into the presence of the
[54:55] master.
[54:56] [Applause]
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; And they using the Bible
[55:03] &gt;&gt; to bring condemnation to the bride.
[55:09] But
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus had a way he handled this.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; They accused him. They accused her.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; And you know what Jesus did?
[55:20] &gt;&gt; He stooped down.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; And he started
[55:26] right on the ground.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:31] [Applause]
[55:33] &gt;&gt; When anything about the bride comes into
[55:36] effect,
[55:38] The Lord himself must come down.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; So you know what happened in this last
[55:46] age?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; God didn't stay above.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; A mighty angel descended from heaven.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; And we know it was none other than the
[55:55] Lord Jesus Christ himself. He stoop down
[55:58] &gt;&gt; and when he stoop down the hand came
[56:00] into effect.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Yeah,
[56:05] &gt;&gt; we know the hand is the fivefold.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; So there is one that points out
[56:11] &gt;&gt; we don't write with the little pinky.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't write with the
[56:15] evangelist. You have the pastor.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; You have the prophet.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; You have the apostle, the one that goes
[56:21] the furthest,
[56:22] &gt;&gt; the teacher, the other one. And then you
[56:24] have the evangelist,
[56:26] &gt;&gt; short and fiery.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; But God stood down and he start to use
[56:30] the finger.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; He started to write with the prophet.
[56:39] What an age this bride is living in
[56:42] &gt;&gt; things that the world never saw before.
[56:44] Things they never heard.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; God started right. The prophet started
[56:48] coming operation.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; And they continued condemning him. And
[56:52] brother, the scripture said he rose up.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Now we know when he came down, he had a
[56:56] book open in his hand.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; He had names in his
[57:00] &gt;&gt; redemption was in progress. Hear
[57:05] what he said.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; He that is without sin among you
[57:10] &gt;&gt; cast the first
[57:11] [Music]
[57:13] &gt;&gt; the religious people of that day with
[57:15] the all the religious scholars and so
[57:17] forth. They didn't have what it took to
[57:20] bring condemnation.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; He never condemned Moses's law. But he
[57:25] was the God of Moses's law.
[57:29] So there is something called grace
[57:31] &gt;&gt; that supersedes the law.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Before there was a law, grace was in
[57:39] effect.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Because the lamb was slain before the
[57:42] foundation of the world. So there was
[57:44] already a supreme sacrifice on her
[57:47] behalf before the sin was committed.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Who was first? The sinner or the savior?
[57:55] Amen.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; The savior was first. Hallelujah.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; So the voice started speak now.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; He that is without sin.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; And you know what happened when these
[58:07] brothers recognize
[58:09] &gt;&gt; they can't go according to the law is
[58:12] something different he brought.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; But you see grace and love goes
[58:16] together.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus had to love this woman.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is not failure now.
[58:23] Because we will notice she ought to be
[58:26] condemned.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; She didn't ask for forgiveness.
[58:30] [Applause]
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; But her name, it was who she was.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; She didn't ask for it, but he brought it
[58:40] to her. Adam didn't go looking for
[58:42] forgiveness, but the law was slain
[58:44] before the foundation of the world on
[58:46] his behalf.
[58:49] Love and grace are twin sisters. They go
[58:52] together. And it took the love of God
[58:54] for that woman to apply this grace to
[58:56] her life.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And in the application of grace, there
[59:01] was no condemnation to her, but a word
[59:04] that was given to the accusers.
[59:06] [Applause]
[59:08] &gt;&gt; God dealt with the accusers
[59:10] &gt;&gt; in expressing grace to her.
[59:14] Zambulat Tobaya
[59:17] in the book of Daniel a lot of accusers
[59:19] that accuse Daniel and cause him to be
[59:21] dung in the lion's den. But all accusers
[59:24] have their part in the lake of fire
[59:27] &gt;&gt; because the book of revelation shows us
[59:29] the accuser of the brethren is cast down
[59:32] which accuse them before our God day and
[59:35] night.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; So God deals with all the accusations.
[59:43] He stoop down
[59:45] &gt;&gt; and he started right again.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; I believe God's still writing.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; You have names that you're writing.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; God know how to write. You know how to
[59:54] spell.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; God wrote on mountains
[59:57] &gt;&gt; in our generation.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; If you ever doubt,
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; come back and look at this. Amen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; So God have things that are written
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; and God have things that are written
[1:00:09] between the line
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; that people can't see but the bride know
[1:00:12] what he said
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; things to inspire faith in our heart
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; to continue along this journey. So this
[1:00:20] lady when the accusers
[1:00:23] you you know allow for the scripture say
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; they which heard it being convicted by
[1:00:29] their own conscience Paul say herein do
[1:00:31] I exercise myself that a conscience
[1:00:33] fight of offense before God and man
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; and that's how we practice
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; hallelujah where we could be justified
[1:00:39] in all things of our lives brother the
[1:00:42] prophet say if he could reach to that
[1:00:43] stage we have brother he say he's fit
[1:00:45] for the rapture then
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; so the bride must reach to a place
[1:00:49] brother where we be sure of who we are
[1:00:51] and where we are standing. The scripture
[1:00:53] says they went out one by one beginning
[1:00:56] at the eldest.
[1:00:59] So the big high priest with the might on
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; seemingly the most holy one for the edge
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; from the elders straight down to the
[1:01:09] lowest
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; drop the stones
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; and the woman was left standing in the
[1:01:19] midst with Jesus on the mount.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where that city would be.
[1:01:27] So what brought you to Christ don't
[1:01:29] always stay with you.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Sometimes your sickness bring you to
[1:01:33] Christ.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; But that that don't don't when they left
[1:01:37] if you leave the mountain top it's down
[1:01:39] you going.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; So all the accusers went downwards after
[1:01:43] that. But the woman was on the mount.
[1:01:46] Hallelujah.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Pyramid mountain. The top of the pyramid
[1:01:51] brother. She was up in the capstone. She
[1:01:54] and him alone.
[1:01:56] Hallelujah.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "Woman, where are thy the
[1:02:01] accusers?"
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Had no man accused thee?
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; She said, "No, Lord."
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither do I condemn thee.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Go and sin no more."
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; You see what happened there is a name
[1:02:19] change took place there. You know, it
[1:02:21] was a nature change. She was no longer a
[1:02:24] church. She was bride. She wasn't just
[1:02:27] forgiven, but she was justified.
[1:02:30] Justified is as though you never did it.
[1:02:35] And that is what it takes for her to
[1:02:37] enter into that city
[1:02:41] up on the mountain top. The prophet say
[1:02:43] your new life is in lamb's book of life.
[1:02:46] Your marriage certificate.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where the true eternal germ
[1:02:50] from the beginning take hold. You're not
[1:02:53] only forgiven but you are justified.
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; That is what is taking place with this
[1:02:59] bride here
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; to recognize who we are.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; We are part of him
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; and one day we all will be with him on
[1:03:07] that mountaintop.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; All accusers will be cast out
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; and we will spend an eternity together.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; May God bless you all. We love you all.
[1:03:23] [Applause]
[1:03:25] Oh, you appreciate.
[1:03:28] Hallelujah. How precious brother Yana

[1:04:00] Amen and amen. Thank you Lord. Oh, we
[1:04:04] love the Lord.

[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:04:12] Thank you, Jesus. You can give me a key
[1:04:14] for that song. There is a river that

[1:10:19] Dear heavenly father,
[1:10:22] Lord Jesus, we come to you, Father,
[1:10:24] before your throne
[1:10:27] this evening, Lord.
[1:10:30] And I believe everyone in here
[1:10:33] can say, "Thank you, Jesus,
[1:10:36] for that river, Lord. It didn't run dry
[1:10:40] for me, but it keeps on flowing, Lord.
[1:10:46] Lord, we pray Lord Jesus tonight.
[1:10:49] Father, may this river keep flowing
[1:10:52] through the hearts of the people.
[1:10:54] Father, may your spirit move among your
[1:10:57] people, Lord Jesus. May you pour out
[1:11:00] your blessings, Father. Lord God, may
[1:11:04] your spirit pour it out, Father,
[1:11:06] tonight, Father. Lord, may we see what
[1:11:09] that river can accomplish, Father. Lord,
[1:11:12] as we heard what it accomplished,
[1:11:14] Father, to that woman, Father, Lord,
[1:11:17] Father, and we are needy people, Father,
[1:11:20] Lord God, Father, but when that river
[1:11:22] touches our soul, Father, Father, it
[1:11:25] will make a difference, Father. Lord, so
[1:11:27] I pray, Lord Jesus, while the word goes
[1:11:29] forth tonight, Father, may you meet
[1:11:32] every need, Father, of your people,
[1:11:34] Lord, and touch them, Father. Heal them,
[1:11:36] Father, while the world goes forth, like
[1:11:39] when the world goes forth, Father. Lord,
[1:11:41] may you bring deliverance, Father, and
[1:11:43] healing and salvation, Father, and a
[1:11:46] complete restoration, Father. We ask it
[1:11:49] in Jesus Christ's name. And we thank
[1:11:51] you, Father, for this opportunity to be
[1:11:54] here and speak to your people, Father.
[1:11:56] May you move me out of the way, Father.
[1:11:58] Lord, but Lord, also may you move the
[1:12:00] thoughts of the people out of the way,
[1:12:02] Lord. May you speak to them, Father. May
[1:12:05] nothing be between you and them, Father.
[1:12:08] Lord Jesus. Father, that you can speak,
[1:12:11] Father, to them, Father. Lord, and your
[1:12:13] word will accomplish whatever it's sent
[1:12:15] for. Lord, we thank you for this
[1:12:17] opportunity. May you bless it in Jesus
[1:12:20] Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Amen. The

[1:12:41] again. Amen. Um purchase your purchased

[1:12:56] can't stand today in his presence. And I
[1:12:59] love that brother Yeda. Thank you very
[1:13:01] much. Praise the Lord. The accuser.
[1:13:05] The accuser forced that woman into the
[1:13:09] presence of God. Praise the Lord. And
[1:13:12] when you come in the presence of the
[1:13:14] Lord, things going to change. And I'm
[1:13:17] looking for tonight for that anointing
[1:13:19] to drop down to change everything.
[1:13:21] Praise the Lord. What we cannot change,
[1:13:24] but he will change it.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; But I love that finally it was the woman
[1:13:29] individual alone with Christ. We're
[1:13:32] sitting here as a group, but God wants
[1:13:35] to deal with every one of us
[1:13:36] individuals. Praise the Lord. May he
[1:13:38] grant it tonight. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:42] I will praise our special creed.

[1:14:19] local church. Amen. Can we give them a
[1:14:21] hand clap for all their sacrifice, their
[1:14:24] love and their labor, the musicians, the
[1:14:27] technicians, the kitchen staff, the the
[1:14:29] the the the translators, everyone who
[1:14:32] joined in, the trustees. Amen. May God
[1:14:34] richly bless you and reward every
[1:14:37] effort. Praise the Lord that you has put
[1:14:39] into this meetings. Amen. We love and
[1:14:41] appreciate from your heart. I feel home
[1:14:43] here. Praise the Lord. And it's good to
[1:14:45] be back in Trinidad. Amen.
[1:14:50] Amen. I want to greet every minister
[1:14:52] here present. I don't want to name it
[1:14:54] due to time, but God bless you richly. I
[1:14:57] appreciate everyone standing for this
[1:14:59] end time message. Amen. There's a last
[1:15:02] push to be done. Praise the Lord. Maybe
[1:15:04] tonight, maybe tomorrow. We don't know.
[1:15:07] But there's a final push. Praise the
[1:15:08] Lord. Amen. One day we're going to break
[1:15:11] the sound barrier. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[1:15:14] we take a flight. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:16] You appreciate the words this morning,
[1:15:18] brother Shem Ali. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:15:20] Speaking about perfect love.
[1:15:23] Hallelujah. Let me tell you, your
[1:15:25] journey started with charity. Your
[1:15:28] journey started with the love of God.
[1:15:31] Otherwise, you never would be sitting
[1:15:33] here. It started with the love of God.
[1:15:36] And it proceeded with the love of God.
[1:15:39] And your life will be kept by the love
[1:15:41] of God. Praise the Lord. And we thank
[1:15:44] God for the love of God that is poured
[1:15:47] out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit.
[1:15:50] And it will produce exactly what the
[1:15:53] word says it will produce. Amen. Praise
[1:15:55] the Lord. We cannot thank God enough.
[1:15:58] Amen. If you would write the love of
[1:16:00] God. Amen. The ocean wouldn't fit to ink
[1:16:03] for that ink to write about the love of
[1:16:05] God. Luke the hor son would not be
[1:16:08] enough to write about the love of God. I
[1:16:12] speaking about a love of God to you.
[1:16:15] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. How
[1:16:17] great and rich and deep the love of God
[1:16:20] is. Amen. Praise the Lord. I bring
[1:16:22] greetings on behalf of my wife, Sister
[1:16:24] Hannah. She cannot be here and didn't
[1:16:26] made it this time. And my two children
[1:16:28] and bring greetings from my brother
[1:16:30] Jonathan, sister Irene Coen, Brena. They
[1:16:33] love you. And the whole church in
[1:16:35] Altonbach Albas in Germany. They love
[1:16:37] and appreciate you. Amen. Praise the
[1:16:40] Lord.
[1:16:42] Hallelujah. Amen. In the preparation, I
[1:16:45] was I was said Lord is there something
[1:16:47] what I can open up a code that I can
[1:16:50] open up. Now I want to come on in the
[1:16:52] mighty God unwave before us.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; There was a wave chief that preached
[1:17:00] this message and he not only preached
[1:17:03] this message but he lifted out.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And one day he said
[1:17:07] come to the mighty the unveiling of the
[1:17:10] mighty God unveile it.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you he was a wave chief.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; That means there's others coming behind
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; that are going to lift this message and
[1:17:21] there will be one more right one more
[1:17:23] availing of almighty God in your life in
[1:17:27] this message. Brother Prenham says, "I'm
[1:17:30] telling you when you break that
[1:17:32] traditional barriers that Jesus is the
[1:17:35] way back and he isn't now." When you
[1:17:38] find he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:17:42] forever, he says there's no limit to
[1:17:45] what God could do right here in his
[1:17:47] convention.
[1:17:49] And I want to sit in a meeting. I want
[1:17:52] to rejoice in a meeting where there's no
[1:17:54] limit what God will do in a convention
[1:17:57] like this. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:17:59] Praise the Lord. And show this world
[1:18:03] what they need. Not a world far off, but
[1:18:06] a world revival that will be filled and
[1:18:10] baptized with the presence of the living
[1:18:12] God and more faith in whailing himself
[1:18:15] into human flesh.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; What is going on, brother Stephanus in
[1:18:22] this meeting? God is pouring down.
[1:18:25] Praise the Lord. And maybe someone here,
[1:18:27] maybe someone here where God will unveil
[1:18:30] it. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. He has
[1:18:33] broken every barrier, every veil, every
[1:18:36] veil. Nothing could hide his presence.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; He says when people gets hungry in their
[1:18:42] heart.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; There's a whale ready to be broke.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Are you hungry in your heart?
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Then there's a whale ready to be broke.
[1:18:53] You can't just depend on that. Rent
[1:18:56] everywhere by his great Holy Spirit
[1:19:00] tonight.
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:02] [Applause]
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Let us go to the scripture.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; I want to read from Colossians 1:27
[1:19:19] from Romans 8 18 and 19.
[1:19:24] Ephesians 3:8
[1:19:27] and John 17:52-
[1:19:31] 24.
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:46] Let's just pray before we approach the
[1:19:48] word of God. Dear heavenly father, Lord
[1:19:51] God, as we approach your sacred word,
[1:19:53] Lord, it's anointed, Father. Lord, it's
[1:19:55] open. It's revealed to us, Father, Lord.
[1:19:58] But Lord, may you anoint it that it
[1:20:00] becomes the living word in our lives,
[1:20:03] Father. Lord God, may you reveal to
[1:20:06] everyone what these scriptures means to
[1:20:08] them personally, Father. Not to a group,
[1:20:10] Father. Not to the church in in general,
[1:20:14] Father, but to each one of us
[1:20:16] individual. May you bless your word as
[1:20:18] we read it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:20:21] And amen. Colossians 1:27.
[1:20:25] To whom God would make known what is the
[1:20:29] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:20:36] you the hope of glory.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So Christ is in you
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; and his mystery hidden to the world
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; comes with a glory. Hallelujah. And the
[1:20:48] riches is the fullness of this glory
[1:20:51] will be made known which means made
[1:20:54] visible in your life.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; It will be unveiled one day.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The riches of this
[1:21:00] glory. Romans 8:18.
[1:21:10] For I reckon that the suffering of these
[1:21:13] present times
[1:21:15] are not worthy to be compared
[1:21:18] to the glory which shall be revealed in
[1:21:22] us.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; So there's a glory to be revealed in you
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; and it's not comparable to all the
[1:21:30] sufferings you have gone through.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for the earnest expectation
[1:21:37] of the creator wait for the
[1:21:40] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; So there's a glory that is going to be
[1:21:45] revealed in you. Praise the Lord. And
[1:21:48] that glory is the same glory that you
[1:21:50] had with him before the foundation of
[1:21:52] the world. And when this is revealed in
[1:21:55] you, it will become a manifestation. And
[1:21:58] all creatures are waiting for his glory
[1:22:00] to be revealed and manifested. Ephesians
[1:22:04] 3:8
[1:22:07] and it talks about how this glory will
[1:22:09] be unveiled.
[1:22:12] Amen. in Ephesians 3 and Paul speaking
[1:22:15] about it and he says personally he says
[1:22:18] unto me this personal testimony who I am
[1:22:21] less than the least of all saints is
[1:22:24] this grace given that I should preach
[1:22:28] among the Gentiles the unsearchable
[1:22:32] riches of Christ now watch and to make
[1:22:36] all men see what is the fellowship of
[1:22:41] the mystery
[1:22:42] Praise the Lord. So Paul says there's a
[1:22:45] fellowship of the mystery and all men
[1:22:48] will see what what a fellowship of the
[1:22:52] mystery will produce.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which from the beginning of
[1:22:56] the world has been hid in God who
[1:22:58] created all things by Jesus Christ.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; John 17:E5.
[1:23:07] And now Jesus is praying. He says, "Oh
[1:23:09] now, oh father, glorify thou me with
[1:23:13] thine own self,
[1:23:16] with the glory which I had with thee
[1:23:19] before the world was."
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Verse 22,
[1:23:26] "And the glory
[1:23:28] which thou has given me,
[1:23:31] I have given them."
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; That they may be one even as we are one.
[1:23:38] In verse 24, Father, I will that they
[1:23:42] also whom thou has given me be with me
[1:23:46] where I am, that they may behold my
[1:23:51] glory which thou has given me for thy
[1:23:54] lovest before the foundation of the
[1:23:57] world. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[1:24:00] seated.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, I want to speak
[1:24:03] tonight about the glory that you had
[1:24:06] with him.
[1:24:08] restored back
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; by the true fellowship.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Because Paul is speaking about a
[1:24:18] fellowship with the mystery. Praise the
[1:24:20] Lord. And the mystery is Christ. The
[1:24:24] mystery, Christ in you, the hope of
[1:24:28] glory, the mystery that has been hidden
[1:24:31] before all ages. But this mystery has to
[1:24:34] be revealed. Praise the Lord. And it
[1:24:36] comes by a fellowship with this mystery
[1:24:40] first on the inside then to a
[1:24:42] manifestation on the outside. And this
[1:24:44] mystery is coming with a glory. And this
[1:24:47] glory is going to be the same glory that
[1:24:49] you had with him before the foundation
[1:24:51] of the world.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; My inspiration Christ in you the hope of
[1:24:56] glory. Amen. Let's get started.
[1:24:59] Hallelujah. What was before the
[1:25:01] beginning? Before the beginning, you had
[1:25:03] fellowship with God. It started with
[1:25:06] fellowship. You had fellowship in the
[1:25:08] mind of God. You were then an attribute
[1:25:11] with God. Praise the Lord. And you came
[1:25:13] to be a son and a daughter of God. And
[1:25:15] Joe picked it up and says, "Where was
[1:25:18] thou?" When the sons and daughters of
[1:25:20] God shouted for joy, you were there. I
[1:25:23] was there. And we had fellowship with
[1:25:26] God Almighty. Praise the Lord. Before
[1:25:28] the foundation of the world. So this was
[1:25:31] before the beginning. Now what was in
[1:25:33] the beginning is it was Adam and Eve.
[1:25:36] They had fellowship with Jehovah God.
[1:25:39] Praise the Lord. He was her father. He
[1:25:41] was their mother. He was all to them.
[1:25:44] And they had fellowship with him. And
[1:25:46] today we find out, Amen. By the grace of
[1:25:50] God, we will find out that your
[1:25:52] fellowship will determine your future.
[1:25:56] And I want to speak about it because the
[1:25:58] fellowship that you have will determine
[1:26:01] your future.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; If you take one thing is what fellowship
[1:26:05] do you have?
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And by the grace of
[1:26:08] God, I want to speak it to prove to
[1:26:11] check yourself. What fellowship do you
[1:26:13] have in your life? Because your
[1:26:15] fellowship will determine your future.
[1:26:17] And by the grace of God, I want to lay
[1:26:19] it out. Praise the Lord. Amen. in
[1:26:22] heaven. Twothirds of the angel they they
[1:26:25] stopped the fellowship with the word of
[1:26:27] God and it determined their future.
[1:26:30] Praise the Lord. They took side Amen
[1:26:32] with the devil. They took side with
[1:26:35] Satan and it determined their
[1:26:37] fellowship. They took it determined
[1:26:39] their future. Their future they were
[1:26:41] cast out on this earth. But one day
[1:26:43] they're going to be destroyed. Praise
[1:26:45] the Lord. Their fellowship determined
[1:26:47] the future. Hallelujah. But there's one
[1:26:50] third that stood with Michael. One third
[1:26:53] that said, "No, I cannot leave it.
[1:26:55] Whatever you say, where should I go?
[1:26:58] Where should I go?" You have words of
[1:27:00] eternal life. The disciples had
[1:27:02] fellowship and they stayed in a
[1:27:05] fellowship. And one day the fellowship
[1:27:07] turned into a manifestation on the day
[1:27:10] of Beccent and it determined their
[1:27:13] future. Their fellowship they had
[1:27:15] determined their future. Amen.
[1:27:18] Hallelujah.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, let's go back in
[1:27:21] the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve had
[1:27:24] fellowship with God. Brother Brandham in
[1:27:26] the voice of God in his last days. He
[1:27:28] said, "Adam heard his voice in the cool
[1:27:31] of the evening." Amen. I pray you hear
[1:27:34] his voice. Brother Brandham prays while
[1:27:36] the message go. He says, "Father, while
[1:27:38] I preach, may the still small voice
[1:27:41] speak to them and have fellowship.
[1:27:43] Praise the Lord. May God grant it
[1:27:45] tonight in the cool of the evening.
[1:27:47] Praise the Lord. And he said, Adam heard
[1:27:49] his voice and he had fellowship with him
[1:27:52] and there was no condemnation to Adam.
[1:27:56] No condemnation when you have fellowship
[1:27:58] with Christ. Praise the Lord.
[1:28:00] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Now in one,
[1:28:03] Brother Bram says, "Now when Adam and
[1:28:06] Eve listened to the lie of the devil,
[1:28:09] the holy image of God left them.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; They went out with the fellowship of the
[1:28:16] word. They started to have fellowship
[1:28:18] with a lie and this actually broke their
[1:28:21] fellowship with God.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; So we are coming back to the word. The
[1:28:27] faith is restored. The world is
[1:28:29] revealed. The word is revealed. And we
[1:28:31] are coming back to real fellowship. I
[1:28:33] tell you this word brings us back to
[1:28:36] real fellowship.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now when Adam and Eve
[1:28:40] listened to the lie of the devil, the
[1:28:41] holy image of God left them. Their
[1:28:44] fellowship was broken with God.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, not only their
[1:28:50] fellowship with God was break was
[1:28:52] broken, Brother Brandham says, he
[1:28:54] continues, he says, as soon as their
[1:28:56] fellowship was broke between God and
[1:28:59] them, he says, then their fellowship
[1:29:02] between each other was broken.
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:14] So your def fellowship will determine
[1:29:17] your future.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And God said I will restore.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; He said I will restore divine
[1:29:23] fellowship.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He said there going to
[1:29:26] be an Eden condition where we have
[1:29:29] fellowship with Christ.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; And that's why I say first we have
[1:29:33] divine fellowship with him and then we
[1:29:36] have fellowship one with another. Praise
[1:29:38] the Lord because it will be a
[1:29:39] restoration of the fellowship with
[1:29:42] Christ Jesus the word. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:44] And then we will have fellowship one
[1:29:46] with another. Praise the Lord. Talking
[1:29:48] about an Eden. Talking about a love of
[1:29:51] God. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:29:54] Amen. So God created man in the
[1:29:57] beginning but man lost fellowship with
[1:29:59] God.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; I want to go in the message the basis of
[1:30:03] fellowship. Now we find out, but now we
[1:30:06] find out that what makes men longing to
[1:30:09] fellowship. Now the fellowship was lost.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; The fellowship with God was lost.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; And he said we find out that what makes
[1:30:18] man to long to fellowship
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; is because that he had once had
[1:30:23] fellowship
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; and his fellowship was with God.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Your fellowship was with God.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a longing inside for
[1:30:35] something to have fellowship back with
[1:30:36] God.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; There's somewhere he's trying to find
[1:30:40] his way back
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; because his origin was to fellowship
[1:30:45] with God.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Benam since two in 6,000 years
[1:30:52] after he lost his fellowship with God,
[1:30:55] he became a wanderer.
[1:30:58] Had to shift for himself. God taken care
[1:31:02] of him before then, but now he finds he
[1:31:05] has to man finds out he has to shift for
[1:31:08] himself and it's a pretty hard thing to
[1:31:11] do.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; And we all experience that. It's a
[1:31:14] pretty hard thing to do without him.
[1:31:16] Praise the Lord. So he doesn't have a
[1:31:19] loving father man to watch over him and
[1:31:22] to protect him and to guide him and to
[1:31:25] direct him and to feed him and to close
[1:31:28] him and to care for him like he did. So
[1:31:31] instead of coming back, he tries to
[1:31:34] fight his own way.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the all the world. Praise the
[1:31:38] Lord. They are trying to find their own
[1:31:40] way instead of coming back to him.
[1:31:43] Praise the Lord. To a true fellowship.
[1:31:45] Hallelujah. Amen. So the own way is not
[1:31:49] working. Look at Cain. Look at K Cain
[1:31:52] tried to do it by his own way, but he
[1:31:55] couldn't enter into the fellowship.
[1:31:57] Amen. Hallelujah. He couldn't just do it
[1:32:00] by himself. Praise the Lord. But a true
[1:32:02] revelation with Abel brought back
[1:32:04] fellowship. Amen. Hallelujah. So
[1:32:07] question, what brought back the what
[1:32:09] brings back the fellowship? Hallelujah.
[1:32:12] Let's go. Praise the Lord. Amen. What
[1:32:14] brings back the fellowship? No intellect
[1:32:17] will bring you in fellowship with God.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said sin came by
[1:32:23] civilation. So your intellect will never
[1:32:27] get you back in fellowship with God.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; So your thinking mental conception time
[1:32:32] is over. Praise the Lord. Because it can
[1:32:35] never bring you back in fellowship. No
[1:32:37] man can bring you back in fellowship. No
[1:32:40] idea can bring you back in fellowship.
[1:32:42] No Greek can bring you back in
[1:32:44] fellowship. Nothing can bring you in
[1:32:46] fellowship that is coming back in
[1:32:48] fellowship. No idea can bring you back
[1:32:51] in fellowship. No greed can bring you
[1:32:53] back in fellowship. Nothing can bring
[1:32:56] you in fellowship that is coming by man.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Brother Brham says,
[1:33:03] brother Brennham continues. He says
[1:33:05] you'll never be able to done to to
[1:33:08] denominate people to fellowship. All
[1:33:11] right.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; So no denomination will you bring you
[1:33:16] back in fellowship
[1:33:18] maturity group
[1:33:22] God in a fellowship but God will take
[1:33:26] individuals.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; He will pick up on here.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; He will pick up on here. He will pick up
[1:33:34] on here. He will say this is my chosen
[1:33:36] one. I have predestinated him and I long
[1:33:39] to have fellowship with him and he will
[1:33:42] reveal himself to him. Praise to whoever
[1:33:45] he wants to, he will do it. But it will
[1:33:47] be the grace of God coming to your way.
[1:33:50] Praise the Lord. Giving you something.
[1:33:52] Hallelujah. A longing in your heart to
[1:33:55] say, I want to go back to my father.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you will never be able to
[1:34:02] denominate people to fellowship. It just
[1:34:06] won't work. It's not God's program.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise the
[1:34:13] Lord. So the denomination will not bring
[1:34:16] you your intellectual will not bring
[1:34:18] you. Brother Brandon says justification
[1:34:21] will not bring you in fellowship.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; He says now hearing the word and being
[1:34:26] just as religious as you want to be.
[1:34:28] Still that don't put us in fellowship.
[1:34:32] But there's a work of justification.
[1:34:35] But justification just doesn't bring you
[1:34:37] back in fellowship. Brother Brennan
[1:34:39] says, he continues, "Sanctification
[1:34:42] will not bring you in fellowship. Your
[1:34:45] sanctification still not in fellowship.
[1:34:48] Still didn't do it." Praise the Lord.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But there's more to come
[1:34:53] that brings you back in fellowship.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In the message, brother
[1:34:57] Benim continues, "But when the true
[1:34:59] blood came,
[1:35:01] the blood of Jesus Christ, God's son."
[1:35:05] Now, what is the blood? The blood is the
[1:35:07] life. It's not the literal blood of
[1:35:10] Jesus Christ, but the life that was in
[1:35:12] the blood. When this comes, the Holy
[1:35:15] Spirit in the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:35:18] when he comes, hallelujah, praise the
[1:35:21] Lord, he broke down the middle part of
[1:35:24] the middle wall of partition. Praise the
[1:35:27] Lord. So, something has to be broke to
[1:35:30] bring you back in fellowship. And it's
[1:35:32] the blood of Jesus Christ, the life of
[1:35:34] Jesus Christ, the spirit of Jesus
[1:35:37] Christ. It will break down every
[1:35:39] partition wall that has separate you
[1:35:42] from the fellowship of God.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Benham, he tore down
[1:35:47] the curtain from the top to the bottom.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. He turned
[1:35:53] it down. And now the believer whosoever
[1:35:57] will let him come into the shakina
[1:36:00] glory.
[1:36:01] Praise the Lord. So true fellowship you
[1:36:04] will only find in the shikina glory in
[1:36:07] the same glory that you had with him
[1:36:10] before the foundation. And God made a
[1:36:13] way by his blood by his spirit to bring
[1:36:17] you back into shina glory. So you have
[1:36:20] the same glory that you had with him
[1:36:23] before the foundation of the world. The
[1:36:25] same fellowship you had with him before
[1:36:28] the foundation of the world. Hallelujah.
[1:36:31] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Brother
[1:36:34] Branham, and a man through
[1:36:36] justification, believing the word,
[1:36:39] sanctification, cleaning from his sin,
[1:36:42] he is subject to enter into the
[1:36:44] Pentecostal chakina. Praise the Lord. So
[1:36:47] justification, sanctification makes you
[1:36:50] subject to enter into the Pentecostal
[1:36:52] china. Praise the Lord. And how do you
[1:36:55] enter in? By one spirit. We are all
[1:36:57] baptized into one body. In this body.
[1:37:01] Hallelujah. Is his glory. In this body
[1:37:03] is his power. In this body is life.
[1:37:06] Praise the Lord. And by one spirit, you
[1:37:08] are baptized into this body.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Now maybe as a little help an example of
[1:37:18] the royal priesthood of the high priest
[1:37:20] in continues brother Brenamin's message
[1:37:23] he speaks about a high priest. He said
[1:37:26] then now then once a year the high
[1:37:28] priest had to be dressed in a certain
[1:37:31] way.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; He had to be anointed in a certain way.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; He had to have a certain ma made
[1:37:39] clothes.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And on the end of his garment he had a
[1:37:43] bell and a prom a a a pom grenade.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had to walk a certain way
[1:37:51] to make that play. And you have to work
[1:37:54] to walk a certain way. You have to be
[1:37:57] dressed in a certain way. Praise the
[1:38:00] Lord. Hallelujah. For real fellowship
[1:38:02] with God, brother Pam. And he had to
[1:38:05] walk a certain way to make that play.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; How did he walked? Holy,
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; holy,
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; holy unto the Lord.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Holy, holy unto the Lord. He was
[1:38:18] sanctified. He said they're holy, holy
[1:38:21] unto him. Hallelujah. What was he doing?
[1:38:24] He's approaching the shikina glory.
[1:38:27] Brother Bram says the real fellowship.
[1:38:31] That's why I say a true fellowship. A
[1:38:34] real fellowship in Shikina glory. Praise
[1:38:37] the Lord. There's where you find the
[1:38:39] real the real fellowship. Praise the
[1:38:42] Lord. But now watch what has what he had
[1:38:45] to be dressed. Brother Brandham said,
[1:38:47] "Up a certain way."
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; And it reminds me, Joseph was dressed by
[1:38:55] his father in a certain way. Praise the
[1:38:58] Lord. Hallelujah. This robe had seven
[1:39:01] colors. It was a certain way. He had to
[1:39:04] be dressed. And the bride of Jesus
[1:39:06] Christ has to be dressed in a certain
[1:39:10] way with a certain role. Praise the
[1:39:13] Lord. To enter into Shakina glory. It's
[1:39:16] a certain rope, a certain made close.
[1:39:20] Praise the Lord. Amen. And a priest was
[1:39:23] anointed in a certain way. And there's
[1:39:26] only one true anointing we know. It's by
[1:39:28] the Holy Spirit. Praise the Lord. And he
[1:39:31] had to walk in a certain way, worshiping
[1:39:34] holy, holy unto the Lord. Now, Brother
[1:39:38] Brandham says, now you see, he said he
[1:39:40] had to make a noise.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In this convention, you
[1:39:47] have to make a certain noise.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; If you want to walk like the high priest
[1:39:52] walking into Shakina glory, you have to
[1:39:54] walk a certain way. You have to make
[1:39:57] some noise. Praise the Lord. Before you
[1:40:00] enter into Shakina glory.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:06] Brother Bren says, "I tell you, when the
[1:40:09] church lets off its noise, there's
[1:40:11] something happens
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; right as sure as the world. Cuz
[1:40:15] everywhere the Shikina glories, there's
[1:40:17] a noise."
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; When you come in this fellowship with
[1:40:23] Shikina glory, there's going to be a
[1:40:25] noise. There's going to be a shouting.
[1:40:27] There's going to be a worship. Holy,
[1:40:29] holy, holy unto the Lord. You cannot
[1:40:32] stop praise the Lord. But you start.
[1:40:34] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Father. I
[1:40:37] saw your grace upon my life. I cannot do
[1:40:40] else than to cry out to you. Hallelujah.
[1:40:43] Praise the Lord. Amen. So, tonight I
[1:40:46] hear the noise of some people. They are
[1:40:48] ready to break through their inner
[1:40:50] whale. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:53] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Now
[1:40:57] brother Brandham we know that brother
[1:40:59] Brandham says then praise the Lord in
[1:41:02] Jesus day before Jesus day man to enter
[1:41:05] behind the inner whale was this.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; But he said now not to enter into this
[1:41:12] fellowship is this.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; So if you want to make it in the rapture
[1:41:18] you better get ready and start to enter
[1:41:20] into this kind of glory.
[1:41:24] Amen.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; And God made a provided way where you
[1:41:27] can enter in, how you can enter in.
[1:41:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is happening in a shakina
[1:41:34] glory? Brother Brandham, the basis of
[1:41:37] fellowship. He said that stuff from
[1:41:39] Aaron that was dead. Nothing but an old
[1:41:42] stick. It had to come to life. It
[1:41:45] bloomed and it blossom on it laying in
[1:41:48] the presence of God.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You take a old stick,
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; a dead stick.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; But there's a chain of God in that
[1:41:59] stick.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; That stick was once a word of God made
[1:42:03] manifest
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; because God spoke, "Let there be trees."
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; And there was a cheat of God for life.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; But when this stick came into the
[1:42:12] presence of God, that stick couldn't
[1:42:14] help anything else than to bring forth
[1:42:17] life.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; That stick had to blossom out. That
[1:42:22] thing has to bring forth fruit in the
[1:42:24] presence of God. Praise the Lord.
[1:42:27] Brother Brandham says when divine
[1:42:29] fellowship is restored, he says the
[1:42:31] fruit is ready to come forth.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You are looking for a
[1:42:40] miracle. You're looking for deliverance.
[1:42:43] You're looking for anything. Come into
[1:42:45] the presence of Almighty God.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] Hallelujah.
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Let me go deeper.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; In Luke 17:E 20,
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:43:13] praise the Lord, he was asked a question
[1:43:16] before. He said, "When is the kingdom of
[1:43:18] God coming?
[1:43:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in this kingdom is a
[1:43:24] shina glory. He says, "When is this
[1:43:27] kingdom coming? When is this glory
[1:43:29] coming? When will it be revealed?"
[1:43:31] Praise the Lord. Brother Jesus turned
[1:43:34] around and he says, "The kingdom of God
[1:43:36] cometh not with observation."
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; When this starts in your life, your wife
[1:43:44] might not see it. Your son might not
[1:43:46] see, your church might not see, but
[1:43:48] something is going on. Jesus said,
[1:43:51] "Behold, the kingdom of God is within
[1:43:54] you."
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But something is going
[1:43:58] on on the inside. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:00] Something is started in the inside. The
[1:44:02] devil cannot stop it. The accuser cannot
[1:44:05] stop it. But something is going on on
[1:44:08] the inside. But one day, what is on the
[1:44:10] inside will come out to the outside.
[1:44:13] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:44:16] Hallelujah.
[1:44:18] Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. This
[1:44:21] kingdom is not coming. But Jesus said
[1:44:24] this kingdom is in you. How can it be be
[1:44:27] in you? By predestination.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; This kingdom is in you. Hallelujah. But
[1:44:33] it will be manifested one day. Praise
[1:44:36] the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Let us go on. 2 Corinthians 3. But even
[1:44:41] unto this day when Moses is read, the
[1:44:45] whale is upon their heart.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was speaking to the Pharisees,
[1:44:50] he said, "In your heart, there's a
[1:44:52] whale." Amen. There's a whale that is
[1:44:54] separating you to see the truth.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; It's separating you. You cannot see.
[1:44:59] Praise the Lord. The whale is upon their
[1:45:02] heart. So not, he's not speaking about a
[1:45:04] whale in the temple, but he says now is
[1:45:07] a whale in your heart. It says,
[1:45:09] "Nevertheless,
[1:45:10] when it shall turn to the Lord, the
[1:45:13] whale shall be taken away." When it's
[1:45:17] turned to the Lord, now what did Peter
[1:45:20] said? He said, "Repent." He said,
[1:45:22] "Return, be repent and baptize, and you
[1:45:26] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:45:28] Ghost." If you turn to the Lord, the the
[1:45:32] whale on your heart will be rent away.
[1:45:35] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now the Lord, praise the
[1:45:40] Lord, the Lord is that spirit. And where
[1:45:43] the spirit of the Lord is, there's
[1:45:46] liberty. So Jesus was speaking, when
[1:45:49] that whale is rent in your life, the
[1:45:51] spirit of God has a liberty. We were
[1:45:54] singing about the river that is flowing
[1:45:57] freely. Praise the Lord. But when this
[1:45:59] whale is ran, you come back in
[1:46:01] fellowship and that river starts to flow
[1:46:04] from your heart from Shakina glory from
[1:46:07] the altars of your heart it will flow
[1:46:10] out. It will flow out to others. Praise
[1:46:12] the Lord.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And then Jesus
[1:46:16] continues, but we all Hello. Paul
[1:46:18] continues, "But we all with open face
[1:46:21] now beholding as in a glass the glory of
[1:46:24] the Lord are changed into the image from
[1:46:27] glory to glory even as the spirit as by
[1:46:32] the spirit of the Lord." So you're going
[1:46:34] to be changed from one glory. There's a
[1:46:38] glory along with justification, a glory
[1:46:40] with sanctification. But there's another
[1:46:43] greater glory coming by the baptism of
[1:46:46] go of of by the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:49] Ghost. And the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:51] will rent down the whale. The blood of
[1:46:54] Jesus Christ in your life will rent down
[1:46:57] every way for the shakina glory itself.
[1:47:00] The Holy Ghost itself. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:03] Here is my spirit flowing freely. Praise
[1:47:05] the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. So I believe
[1:47:10] Hallelujah. I believe I believe tonight
[1:47:14] there's a people in the land that know
[1:47:17] their God. Where the whale is ramp
[1:47:20] tonight where the spirit of God can flow
[1:47:23] freely. Shina glory in the sockets of
[1:47:27] your heart radiating out the love of
[1:47:31] God. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. A
[1:47:35] people in the land that know their God,
[1:47:38] they will do great exploits because they
[1:47:42] have fellowship with God himself.
[1:47:45] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:47:50] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. So,
[1:47:53] let me say this. The time is at hand
[1:47:56] that God will make known the riches of
[1:48:00] this mystery. Christ in you, the hope of
[1:48:02] glory.
[1:48:03] This time is here.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; The this kingdom
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; will come in a power.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; This kingdom will come in power. Praise
[1:48:13] the Lord. The king of kings will sit on
[1:48:15] the throne. The presence of God will be
[1:48:18] all over this place. Hallelujah. You
[1:48:21] walk in a room, Shakina glory is going
[1:48:23] with you. Brother Brham had it when he
[1:48:26] was walking in the tent. Praise the
[1:48:28] Lord. Shakina glory was going with him.
[1:48:30] Paul had it. Shakina glory was with him.
[1:48:33] He had true fellowship with almighty
[1:48:36] God. The sick got healed in his shadow.
[1:48:39] The lame got to walk. The blind got to
[1:48:41] see. Praise the Lord. And he came by
[1:48:43] true fellowship with God Almighty again.
[1:48:46] Fellowship. Praise the Lord. In his
[1:48:49] people. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But let me lay it out.
[1:48:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:59] Paul speaks in Ephesians 3. He says,
[1:49:03] "And I preach among the Gentiles the
[1:49:06] unsearchable riches of Christ.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; And to make all men see what is the
[1:49:13] fellowship of the mystery."
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Paul
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; had fellowship with the mystery
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; because he broke through.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; He knew
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; the shikina glory. Amen.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; He knew the liberty of the spirit.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; The whale was rent for Paul.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; He had this fellowship.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; But he said that all men will see. Then
[1:49:38] it will be made known now what a
[1:49:41] fellowship of the mystery produces.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; If we have fellowship with the mystery,
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; all men will know that you had
[1:49:53] fellowship with the mystery.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:59] Let me make it plain.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Noah had fellowship
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; with the mystery of his day.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; The word of God came to him
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; and he had fellowship with the mystery.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Moses, he had fellowship
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; with the mystery of his day.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh didn't know nothing about it.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh couldn't stop little Moses.
[1:50:24] Amen.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; But he had a mother that teach him the
[1:50:26] mystery about his life.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; And he has started to have fellowship
[1:50:31] with the mystery. Joshua had fellowship
[1:50:34] with the mystery of his day.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Paul had fellowship with the mystery of
[1:50:38] his day.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; William Brham had fellowship with the
[1:50:41] mystery of his day.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Until when? Until the mystery the
[1:50:47] fellowship of the mystery was made
[1:50:49] known.
[1:50:54] Noah, and I want to make it plain. Noah
[1:50:57] said, "It will rain."
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Why did he said it? How could he stand
[1:51:03] 120 years and say, "It will rain. It
[1:51:06] will rain. It will rain." Because he had
[1:51:09] fellowship with that mystery. He may God
[1:51:12] may turn the wife around, and children
[1:51:14] around. He didn't take care because he
[1:51:17] had fellowship with the mystery. It will
[1:51:20] rain.
[1:51:23] But one day the fellowship business
[1:51:26] mystery had to turn into a manifestation
[1:51:29] be made known
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; that all men shall see that he had
[1:51:35] fellowship with the mystery. The
[1:51:38] manifestation is the vindication of the
[1:51:41] fellowship.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; And I thank God that Noah took
[1:51:47] fellowship with that mystery in heaven.
[1:51:49] I want to speak with him about it. How
[1:51:51] did you hold on? He will say, I had
[1:51:53] fellowship with the mystery. It couldn't
[1:51:56] be stopped. Amen. Brother Pam says
[1:51:58] Joshua and Caleb had it in their heart.
[1:52:01] Praise the Lord. They had the promise in
[1:52:04] their heart that this land belongs to
[1:52:06] them. So they started to have fellowship
[1:52:09] with this mystery and it was so strong
[1:52:11] upon Caleb that he said this mountain is
[1:52:14] my mountain. This was coming with
[1:52:17] fellowship with the promise. So he
[1:52:20] continued,
[1:52:21] praise the Lord. He didn't care if it's
[1:52:24] 10 years in the desert. He continued to
[1:52:27] have fellowship with the mystery.
[1:52:31] 20 years he continued fellowship with
[1:52:34] the mystery. 30 years he didn't stop at
[1:52:38] fellowship with the mystery. But in the
[1:52:40] 40s years he something was pushing him
[1:52:43] out. He said, "Therefore, give me this
[1:52:46] mountain. I had fellowship 40 years with
[1:52:51] this mystery, but now the time has come
[1:52:55] for my mountain. Therefore, forgive me.
[1:52:58] I want to see a manifestation of the
[1:53:00] mystery of the fellowship I had with
[1:53:03] him.
[1:53:18] Praise the Lord. There was a mystery
[1:53:21] laying in Moses and Moses tried by his
[1:53:24] own strength to fulfill that mystery.
[1:53:28] But you cannot produce it by your own
[1:53:30] self because brother Brandham said it's
[1:53:32] not by intellect. It's not by forming a
[1:53:35] group. It's not by this. It's not by
[1:53:37] this but by my spirit says the Lord.
[1:53:40] Praise the Lord. 40 years. 40 years he
[1:53:45] was running away from the presence of
[1:53:46] God. 40 years he was in the wilderness.
[1:53:50] But the mystery stayed with him. But one
[1:53:53] day a burning bush experience. Praise
[1:53:55] the Lord. The Holy Spirit came down upon
[1:53:58] him. Praise the Lord. He said come. Come
[1:54:01] to the presence of God. Come to the
[1:54:03] shina glory. There's a shikina glory
[1:54:06] tonight in the burning bush. Praise the
[1:54:08] Lord. It is here tonight. But he said,
[1:54:11] "Come, come to the burning bush in his
[1:54:14] presence." That mystery started to
[1:54:17] operate. And now it was ready in the
[1:54:21] burning bush. The whale was rent for
[1:54:24] him.
[1:54:25] He understood that I, Lord God, will
[1:54:28] deliver my people. Moses, you don't have
[1:54:31] to do it, but I will do it. I'm going to
[1:54:33] use you. Praise the Lord. And the
[1:54:36] fellowship with the mystery started into
[1:54:38] a manifestation.
[1:54:40] Pharaoh couldn't hold him. No greed
[1:54:42] could hold him. Nothing could hold him.
[1:54:45] But now the fellowship by the spirit.
[1:54:48] Hallelujah. Produced a manifestation
[1:54:51] and it came to pass. Hallelujah.
[1:54:56] Hallelujah.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:59] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:55:02] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham at
[1:55:05] fellowship is that mystery. He was
[1:55:07] reading Malachi 4 and something was
[1:55:10] striking his heart. He says there's
[1:55:12] going to be an Elijah before that great
[1:55:14] and dreadful day. There's going be to be
[1:55:17] an Elijah. But one day he was baptizing
[1:55:20] one person and a voice came out to
[1:55:22] heaven from heaven and said your message
[1:55:25] will forun the second coming of Christ.
[1:55:28] Praise the Lord. And he started to have
[1:55:30] fellowship. He didn't put it aside, but
[1:55:33] he started to have fellowship with what
[1:55:35] the angel with what the voice said and
[1:55:37] he started to fellowship and he found
[1:55:38] where it's written
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; and God manifested it.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. There's a bride here in
[1:55:49] Trinidad. There's a bride all over the
[1:55:51] world that is having fellowship because
[1:55:54] the seed is in the bound. Brother
[1:55:56] Brandham says the word is in the bride.
[1:55:59] But what it needs to have fellowship
[1:56:00] with that word. You can hear it a 40
[1:56:03] years. You can hear it at 20 years. But
[1:56:05] once you get in fellowship with that
[1:56:07] mystery, praise the Lord. It will start.
[1:56:10] It will bring the revival. It will
[1:56:12] bring, hallelujah, the manifestation.
[1:56:15] Hallelujah.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; What seed is in the power? A seed of a
[1:56:19] right conduct as a Christian.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; There's a seed of behavior in this
[1:56:26] message for a Christian. Hallelujah.
[1:56:28] There's a seat of the life of Christ in
[1:56:31] the bride because brother Brandon
[1:56:33] preached a message called the token. So
[1:56:36] there's a life seed in you. Praise the
[1:56:38] Lord. But this life seed has to come
[1:56:40] into manifestation and it will come by
[1:56:43] fellowship with that mystery. Praise the
[1:56:45] Lord. How can Christ live in me? How can
[1:56:48] Christ live in you? Let me challenge
[1:56:50] you. How is Christ living in you? You
[1:56:53] only start. Brother Bram says just get
[1:56:55] in the spirit. Just get started. You
[1:56:57] say, "Lord Jesus, Christ in me, the hope
[1:57:00] of glory." But Lord Jesus, you said,
[1:57:03] "This will come alive. This will start
[1:57:05] to work in me. Let charity, let the love
[1:57:08] of God, let faith, let virtue, let
[1:57:12] knowledge, let temperance work in me.
[1:57:14] Father, build me up. Oh Lord, what is
[1:57:17] that?" It's a prayer to have fellowship.
[1:57:20] Build me up, Lord. Build me up into that
[1:57:22] stature. And you start to have
[1:57:24] fellowship. And one day God can come
[1:57:27] down and well and bring it to a
[1:57:29] manifestation
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; in this message.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; There's seats of adoption of a power of
[1:57:40] authority that is resting upon you.
[1:57:42] Praise the Lord. But we are looking
[1:57:44] forward for the full power of God to
[1:57:47] bring it into a manifestation.
[1:57:50] Hallelujah. Seeds of perfections.
[1:57:52] Hallelujah. Many seeds have been sold,
[1:57:54] but we are waiting for the
[1:57:55] manifestation. It's already manifesting
[1:57:58] time. We are singing this song. It's
[1:58:01] manifesting time. What is it?
[1:58:03] Hallelujah. You have fellowship with
[1:58:05] that mystery and Satan cannot stop it.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:11] Hallelujah.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:16] [Applause]
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey,
[1:58:20] brother.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; It's not a fellowship
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; on the outside,
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; but the fellowship you have on the
[1:58:29] inside
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; that determines your future.
[1:58:35] [Music]
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; David said Psalm 1, he said, "Blessed is
[1:58:41] the man."
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Let me say it different. Blessed is the
[1:58:46] bride of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; That walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:58:51] ungodly,
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; nor standeth in the way of sinner,
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; nor sitth in the seat of the scornful,
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; but her delight,
[1:59:01] her delight
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; is in the law of the Lord.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; And the law of the Lord is this.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; The law of the Lord is this.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; But her delight is in the law of the
[1:59:15] Lord. and in his law
[1:59:18] does he meditate day and night.
[1:59:23] So David knew the secret place in
[1:59:26] meditation in fellowship with the word
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; and it was his experience
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; and he said blessed is the man
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; that mediates day and night.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:47] What is following
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; after mediation in your heart
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; day and night
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; he shall be
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; like a tree planted
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; by the rivers of living water.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; What is David saying? Here is my spirit
[2:00:05] flowing freely.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; There's no more whale that can separate
[2:00:10] you from the operating of the Holy
[2:00:12] Spirit. He shall be there will be a
[2:00:15] manifestation
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; of another tree of life.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; And I heard a message. There's going to
[2:00:21] be a restoration of a bride tree. And
[2:00:24] this bright tree will be restored once
[2:00:27] again by a true fellowship in your
[2:00:30] heart.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; And he shall be like a tree planted by
[2:00:34] the rivers of water that brings forth
[2:00:37] his fruit in his seasons.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; And his leaves shall not wither. and
[2:00:41] whatsoever he does.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Shall prosper.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Prenham says there's going to be
[2:00:51] a bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; She will be an invincible army.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Whatever she said, it will prosper.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; She will have dust, says the Lord, or
[2:01:03] she will be quiet,
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; but it will be there.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it will become it will come
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; by the fellowship
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; with the mystery
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; David continues the ungodly are not so
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; they don't have fellowship
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; with a promise
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; but are like the chuff which the wind
[2:01:28] drive away
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; but God said I will restore
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; abiding fellowship with his word
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; and Jesus said if you abide in me
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; and my words abide in you
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; what is he speaking he's speaking about
[2:01:45] a fellowship he said there will be
[2:01:48] someone somewhere somehow he will start
[2:01:52] to come in fellowship with me and he
[2:01:55] will not go in and out but he will be
[2:01:57] abiding fellowship with me the word
[2:01:59] praise the lord hallelujah and he said
[2:02:01] he will be this fellowship will be so
[2:02:04] intense I will be in him my words will
[2:02:07] be in him. So whatever then from this
[2:02:09] fellowship he will speak of it will
[2:02:12] happen. Praise the Lord.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; When you fellowship with this mystery,
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; brother Brenam says no one can persuade
[2:02:28] you different.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Because something has happened on the
[2:02:33] inside.
[2:02:35] There's no more whale.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; The whale is rent. The glory of God came
[2:02:40] down into your life.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Let me take that. Amen. His presence is
[2:02:53] here.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; But let me just strive that when Joshua
[2:02:58] was there, praise the Lord. God spoke to
[2:03:01] him. This book of law shall not depart
[2:03:05] out of thy mouths,
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; but thou shalt meditate therein day
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; and night.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, let me meditate.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; More day and night.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; That thou must observe to do according
[2:03:22] to all that is written therein.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; When he had praise the Lord, this God
[2:03:32] continued and he says, "For then
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; thou shalt make thy way prospers."
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Nothing shall stand before you.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; And then thou shalt have good
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; success.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Joshua, if you have fellowship with this
[2:03:52] word,
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; take the law of Moses. Take the law of
[2:03:56] God. Have fellowship and nothing will
[2:03:59] stand before you.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; And Joshua did so and a manifestation
[2:04:08] came forth. Jericho's wall failed.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; It could not stand before that.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; But in the midst of the congregation,
[2:04:16] there was one man.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; And this man called Akan.
[2:04:21] And Akan. Now watch. I just want to lay
[2:04:23] it out. Ahan.
[2:04:26] You say Akan. Achen. Thank you. Achen,
[2:04:31] he saw the miracles that was done among
[2:04:34] the people.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Achen was walking through dry sea.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Achen saw the cloud of glory.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Achen saw the mana from heaven.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Achen was eating the mana from heaven.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Achen saw the rock beneath the rock. He
[2:04:57] saw the living waters flowing.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Achen felt the anointing of God.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Achen saw the miracles. There was no
[2:05:06] sick among two million people.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Achen saw the power of God.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Achen saw it all. Praise the Lord. Achen
[2:05:14] might have seen a vindicated prophet for
[2:05:17] his day.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Achen saw it all. Praise the Lord.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; But Achen, he was looking to the riches
[2:05:24] of Jericho. Yeah.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Now watch out. In his heart, he started
[2:05:30] to desire the items of Jericho.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; So Achen started to shift from the
[2:05:38] fellowship of the promise for the
[2:05:42] complete country, for the complete land
[2:05:44] to be theirs. Achen started to shift his
[2:05:48] fellowship in his heart and he turned to
[2:05:51] the riches of the world to the riches of
[2:05:54] Jericho and he started to have
[2:05:56] fellowship with his desires for the
[2:05:59] riches of Jericho.
[2:06:00] [Applause]
[2:06:06] And in shifting his desire, in shifting
[2:06:09] his dis his his fellowship, he started
[2:06:12] to become disobedient
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; to the word of God.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; What was the result?
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; His inside fellowship that he had
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; started to come to a manifestation.
[2:06:31] Israel lost the battle.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Not only here, but all Israel lost the
[2:06:36] battle.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; 36 Israel's lost their lives.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; And he, his family, and his house was
[2:06:44] destroyed.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Blooded out
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; because God is looking on the heart
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; of one single Israel out of two million.
[2:06:57] one had had changed his fellowship with
[2:06:59] the promise for Israel and he was
[2:07:02] blotted out. Amen.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Because he shifted his fellowship.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Balam.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Balam.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; He had a wrong fellowship.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Not on the outside, but on the inside.
[2:07:22] First,
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; he had a desire of influence.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; He had a desire of money. and his
[2:07:30] desire, his fellowship, what he had on
[2:07:32] the inside. One day it became a
[2:07:36] manifestation.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; And he was killed by the Israelites
[2:07:42] along with the Medidianite kings.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Let me take another examples.
[2:07:49] Judas
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; his chariot is
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; he was walking with Jesus
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; and Jesus was speaking in parables
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; then he was revealing it to his
[2:08:04] disciples
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; but something on the inside of Judah's
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; exeriot
[2:08:10] he didn't started to have fellowship
[2:08:12] with this mystery that was expressed to
[2:08:14] him
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; but he kept on a fellowship with a
[2:08:18] hidden mystery that he had in his heart.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; He had a desire for the lust of the
[2:08:25] money
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; that he kept a little desire in his
[2:08:28] heart for money.
[2:08:31] He was seeking for a natural kingdom to
[2:08:34] come in power.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; And he kept that secret all over the
[2:08:38] time he was with Jesus.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; And he kept the fellowship. And that
[2:08:41] fellowship on the inside of his heart
[2:08:43] was so strong.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; It became so strong he couldn't push it
[2:08:48] back.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; But one day he betrayed Jesus Christ.
[2:08:54] [Applause]
[2:08:58] And when he recognized it,
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; it was too late.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; The rich young ruler.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; He kept all the commandments.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; He came in church
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; and if you wanted to point to one in a
[2:09:21] church, you would have pointed to him.
[2:09:24] Yeah.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Look how he walks.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; He never missed one commandment. He's
[2:09:30] perfect on the spot to every commandment
[2:09:32] that is given by God.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Everything you could see him, you could
[2:09:37] put no finger to him.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; There was no condemnation in the church
[2:09:42] towards him.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "I have all done this." What a
[2:09:45] prophet said.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; And Jesus looked deeper,
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; more deeper,
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; more deeper. He was looking through the
[2:09:55] flesh. He was looking to his spirit. But
[2:09:58] he came to his heart. He came to his
[2:10:00] soul. And he said, "One thing lack." He
[2:10:04] said, "Give up all your money and give
[2:10:05] it to the poor." Because Jesus saw that
[2:10:09] a rich young ruler still had fellowship
[2:10:11] with something else in his heart.
[2:10:14] [Applause]
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; And Jesus was be standing before him.
[2:10:22] And the word is trying to correct the
[2:10:24] error.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe tonight.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; The word is trying to correct an error
[2:10:32] in your life.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; The rich Rangulo
[2:10:39] didn't want to give up the fellowship
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; he had with the money
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; and he turned around.
[2:10:48] This fellowship in his heart was more
[2:10:51] important to him than the fellowship in
[2:10:54] Shikina glory abiding with Jesus Christ.
[2:10:58] He said come follow me.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; What does it mean? Come stay with me.
[2:11:03] The presence of God is with me. The stay
[2:11:05] within his presence. He will do
[2:11:07] everything that is wrong. He will do it
[2:11:09] right. But he just couldn't let go.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; He kept on holding with the mystery that
[2:11:15] he had in his heart.
[2:11:19] So the fellowship in his heart
[2:11:21] determined his future.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Let me go through it.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Let me take another example.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; There was a son
[2:11:38] and he was the son of a rich man.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Very rich man. And all the land that you
[2:11:46] could see belonged to him. All the
[2:11:48] treasures in this land belonged to him.
[2:11:51] He had cattle like no one else had
[2:11:53] cuddles. He had servant like no one else
[2:11:55] had ser had had servants. He had all the
[2:11:59] riches there was in this land.
[2:12:02] And he had two boys.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; But one boy started to desire
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; the prosperity of his father.
[2:12:12] [Music]
[2:12:14] He started to have a desire and in his
[2:12:17] heart you see before you speak something
[2:12:20] you have it in your heart.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; So he had something in his heart. He saw
[2:12:25] the riches
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; and he wanted to have it before it's
[2:12:29] time.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; So he went went to his father and he
[2:12:33] said give me my inheritance
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; before the time.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; And he speak. Why did he said it?
[2:12:40] because he was thinking in his heart.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; He was meditating on his heart about the
[2:12:46] riches that his father had.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; But little did he take care about a
[2:12:51] fellowship his father had in his heart.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; But he missed the point.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; So he started to have fellowship and he
[2:12:59] said, "What can I do with this riches?"
[2:13:01] And he started to have fellowship with
[2:13:03] this with this riches with this
[2:13:06] inheritance.
[2:13:08] And he went to his father and he said,
[2:13:10] "Give me my inheritance."
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; And the father didn't said, "I don't
[2:13:14] give it to you." But the father said,
[2:13:17] "Okay, you have it here,
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; but you're going to learn a hard
[2:13:20] lesson."
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; He had fellowship.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Now, the fellowship in his heart became
[2:13:28] a manifestation
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; and the father gave it to him
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Now I now it all belongs
[2:13:34] to me. Whatever was for me is in store.
[2:13:36] it's now mine. And he went his way
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; and a manifestation of the desire in his
[2:13:42] heart of the fellowship he had in his
[2:13:44] heart started to manifest.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; But it became lesser and lesser
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; and lesser
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; and lesser.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Until all the inheritance, all that his
[2:14:00] desire was no more.
[2:14:03] verse.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; He found himself with a pig.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; And he had only one desire. He said, "If
[2:14:13] I could eat, what a pig eat."
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Speak about a hungry soul that lost
[2:14:19] fellowship with the true mystery.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; But one day the mercy of God dropped
[2:14:25] down.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; And he, brother Bam says, he came to
[2:14:29] himself.
[2:14:30] He said, "I had fellowship with my
[2:14:32] father."
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; And there was another mystery with my
[2:14:36] father. And there was a desire in his
[2:14:39] heart for another fellowship. The money
[2:14:42] was not enough. The world was not
[2:14:45] enough. Nothing was enough for him
[2:14:47] anymore. But he said, "Let me go to the
[2:14:49] father's house. And if I only can be a
[2:14:52] servant. If I only can come near to the
[2:14:55] presence of God. If I only can come near
[2:14:58] to Shakina glory. If I only can labor in
[2:15:02] shakina glory. I know all is going to be
[2:15:05] well. But let me just be near in the
[2:15:07] shina glory. I don't care what is it.
[2:15:10] But father just let me serve you.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; And he turned around. He made his steps.
[2:15:16] He walked to his father. Praise the
[2:15:18] Lord. And his father was waiting for him
[2:15:22] because his father had a desire in his
[2:15:25] heart for fellowship. And he knew one
[2:15:28] day he will come back again because he
[2:15:31] know his son was a true seed of God.
[2:15:34] Praise the Lord. And this seed, brother
[2:15:37] Prelim said, it might be concrete over
[2:15:40] the sea. It might be down in the earth.
[2:15:42] It might be hidden somewhere. But one
[2:15:45] day when the light will struck the sea,
[2:15:48] praise the Lord, nothing can stop the
[2:15:50] sea to come forth. Why? Why? Because the
[2:15:55] prodical son in a pig's stand, he
[2:15:58] started to change his fellowship. He
[2:16:00] said, "I know where I come from. I know
[2:16:03] my father. I know where my destin I know
[2:16:07] my hope." He says, "I want to be back
[2:16:09] there in fellowship." And he drove him
[2:16:11] back into the father's hand. Praise the
[2:16:14] Lord. Speaking about a restoration.
[2:16:17] Speaking about something in his heart
[2:16:19] that has changed. Praise the Lord.
[2:16:21] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; He started to meditate about his
[2:16:31] father's home.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; And he went into action.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Let me give another example.
[2:16:43] Samson.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; There was a promise hanging over Samson.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; But Samson,
[2:16:55] he had a gift of God.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; But in his heart,
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; he had lust for the liar.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; He was laying in the night and he was
[2:17:07] meditating about the liar.
[2:17:10] He had fellowship in his thought first
[2:17:13] before he had fellowship in a
[2:17:15] manifestation with the liar.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; His fellowship in his heart became a
[2:17:21] manifestation.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; And God let it happen.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "Samson,
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to teach you a lesson.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to teach you a lesson. A true
[2:17:34] fellowship with the divine promise for
[2:17:37] your life
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; will bring something to pass. A
[2:17:41] supernatural happening will bring it to
[2:17:43] pass.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; And in a prison, his eyes blotted out.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; He couldn't see.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; You speak about a man that was broken
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; in a prison door behind prison doors.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; People were mocking him. Yes,
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; people were laughing him.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Not only were laughing them on him, but
[2:18:07] they were laughing about Jehovah, God.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Because in him they saw the power of
[2:18:12] Jehovah
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; and they said, "We defeated it. It is
[2:18:16] finished. We have the victory."
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; But the promise stayed with Samson.
[2:18:22] But somewhere in a deep dark prison,
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; not seeing anything,
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Samson started to meditate on the
[2:18:33] promise.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; He felt something on the backside of his
[2:18:37] hair.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "There is a promise still
[2:18:41] coming out."
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; And he started to meditate.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; He started again to have fellowship
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; with the promise over his life.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I said, "Lord God, if it's
[2:18:54] possible, Lord, let me at one more time
[2:18:57] fellowship with the mystery over my
[2:19:01] life." And he said one day, he said,
[2:19:04] "Lord God, once more, Lord, I meditated
[2:19:09] on your Lord. I meditate on your
[2:19:11] promise. But today, Lord, let it be, let
[2:19:15] it be a manifestation of the true
[2:19:18] fellowship with the divine promise for
[2:19:20] my life.
[2:19:23] And he called the young lad and he said,
[2:19:25] "Lead me to the pillar. I feel the locks
[2:19:28] have grown out. I feel it's back again.
[2:19:31] I have found a true fellowship with my
[2:19:34] personal promise." And he said he was
[2:19:36] strong. He said, "Lead me to that
[2:19:38] pillar." Praise the Lord. And it should
[2:19:40] be power between the pillars. And he
[2:19:42] said, "Let thy praise the Lord." And he
[2:19:45] started to push. He started to push once
[2:19:49] more, Lord. Praise the Lord. Once more,
[2:19:51] Lord, let this promise, let the
[2:19:54] fellowship that I had with this promise,
[2:19:56] let it come to a manifestation. And he
[2:19:59] started to push, push, push, push.
[2:20:02] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And the
[2:20:04] pillars started to give up. They said,
[2:20:06] "There's a stronger force in Samson.
[2:20:09] Praise the Lord. The pillar looked to
[2:20:12] Samson. The pillar acknowledged a
[2:20:15] mystery in Samson. They acknowledge a
[2:20:19] power of God in Samson. And it had to
[2:20:21] push back. They had to pull back. And
[2:20:24] they pulled back. Praise the Lord. Until
[2:20:25] the building fell down.
[2:20:28] [Music]
[2:20:33] [Applause]
[2:20:36] Hallelujah.
[2:20:39] Hallelujah.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Let me say it in a different way.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Samson
[2:20:48] had fellowship with the promise of seven
[2:20:52] locks. Again,
[2:20:54] [Applause]
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; it was his personal secret of his
[2:21:00] personal seven seal.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; There was something for him.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; And it was hidden to the outside world.
[2:21:08] But it was open for him.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; His seven virtues
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; was growing out again.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; What you had before the foundation of
[2:21:21] the world is growing out again.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; What he lost in the valleys of sin
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; was growing out again.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; And he started to have fellowship
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; with his secret.
[2:21:37] and he started to prepare himself
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; for the final victory.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; And when his life
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; uttered its final voices,
[2:21:48] it thundered in the house of the
[2:21:49] Philistines.
[2:21:52] [Applause]
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Talking about a bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. A promise,
[2:22:02] a statue of a perfect man. You only get
[2:22:05] started in a fellowship with the stature
[2:22:07] of a perfect man. Brother Brennham said,
[2:22:10] "If we prostrate ourselves before living
[2:22:13] virtue, a living patience, a living
[2:22:16] temperance, a living godliness, a living
[2:22:19] brotherly kindness, and a living
[2:22:21] charity," he says, "Praise the Lord." We
[2:22:23] just have fellowship with it. You're
[2:22:25] going to see a manifestation.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:29] [Music]
[2:22:33] [Applause]
[2:22:35] Hallelujah.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Let me wind it down.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; In a message the mighty God unveiled
[2:22:40] before us,
[2:22:42] Jesus said, "Well, that's exactly what a
[2:22:45] church has done." It come from Luda
[2:22:48] Wesley. Now, back to the original grain.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; He says, "Back to its original glory."
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; Back to the glory it was at the
[2:23:00] beginning. Hallelujah.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; It changed from Pagan down into Luther
[2:23:08] and from Luther down to Wesley, from
[2:23:10] Wesley out into Pentecost and on and on
[2:23:15] changing from glory to glory producing
[2:23:19] the hidden mana.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; He says now it's ripe.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; And I believe it's ripe.
[2:23:28] This message has come to a maturity.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; This message is ripened.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. By fellowship with the
[2:23:38] promise.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now it's ripe to bring back
[2:23:44] exactly like he was at the beginning. He
[2:23:47] says the same ministry,
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; the same Jesus,
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; the same power,
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; the same Holy Ghost,
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; the same one that came down on the day
[2:24:00] of Pentecost
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested
[2:24:05] today from glory and to glory to glory.
[2:24:09] So, brother Brandham says the same
[2:24:12] glory, the same power that was in the
[2:24:15] church will be manifested again. Praise
[2:24:17] the Lord. Why? They had fellowship with
[2:24:20] the mystery. Praise the Lord. And one
[2:24:22] day it will come to pass.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, brother Brandham. And it's
[2:24:27] back to its original seed with the
[2:24:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same
[2:24:32] signs the same wonders the same baptism
[2:24:37] some kind same kind of people
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; same kind of people
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; acting
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; the same way
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; with the same power
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; the same sensation.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; It's from glory unto glory.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; And he said the next will be change from
[2:25:05] this glory into a body like his own
[2:25:08] glorious body where we shall see him.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; May the musician come.
[2:25:16] [Applause]
[2:25:29] Hallelujah.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in the message the
[2:25:48] basis of fellowship.
[2:25:52] He says, "Under the blood
[2:25:57] which is the life."
[2:26:00] He said, "And the blood
[2:26:03] brings the fire."
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; The sacrifice
[2:26:11] was offered by fire. Amen.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; If you play something softly,
[2:26:21] let's stand to our feets. I'm finished.
[2:26:33] You see,
[2:26:36] if the rich rang rangul young ruler
[2:26:42] would have only given up
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; the fellowship in his heart
[2:26:49] if he would have sacrificed it,
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; the fellowship that he had in his heart.
[2:26:57] The high priest was standing before him
[2:27:00] and he God Almighty Jehovah, God
[2:27:03] Almighty Jehovah
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; and his brother was there
[2:27:10] making by his mental ideas
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; a sacrifice
[2:27:15] and God told him if you would only do so
[2:27:19] what he does.
[2:27:22] But you see the fellowship he had in his
[2:27:24] heart to say it has to be something I
[2:27:27] can do
[2:27:29] was greater
[2:27:31] and instead of putting that on the altar
[2:27:34] to say Lord that's the way I always
[2:27:36] thought it has to be
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; and he didn't laid it out
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; and his destiny
[2:27:48] was determined
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; yeah by what was in his heart.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; Church,
[2:27:55] we can preach mighty messages,
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; but this is coming to the bottom of your
[2:28:01] heart.
[2:28:03] [Music]
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; What fellowship?
[2:28:08] Check yourself.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Before we continue with this convention.
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; What fellowship?
[2:28:18] With what? Do you have fellowship in
[2:28:19] your heart?
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is asking you.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; What fellowship did you had two weeks
[2:28:28] ago?
[2:28:30] What fellowship?
[2:28:32] What desire is in your heart?
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; What were you meditating day and night?
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; And we all have failed.
[2:28:46] But his mercy and his grace
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; is greater than that.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; It's greater. We heard that.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; We heard that with the woman that was
[2:28:58] caught in adultery.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; But there was something in her heart
[2:29:04] that is that she stayed in the presence
[2:29:06] of God.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; She could have run away when the others

[3:01:09] word as it were to see what we are
[3:01:12] fellowshipping with dear God, where our
[3:01:15] fellowship is Lord and with whom our
