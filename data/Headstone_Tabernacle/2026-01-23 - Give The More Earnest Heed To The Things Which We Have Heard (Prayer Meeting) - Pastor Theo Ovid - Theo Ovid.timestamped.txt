[0:01] in progress.
[0:02] &gt;&gt; We want to start tonight in a word of
[0:04] prayer. Let's bow our heads as we uh
[0:07] begin tonight as we bow our heads and
[0:08] ask God's blessings upon us tonight,
[0:10] Lord, for the service and everything
[0:12] else committed in the hands of the Lord
[0:14] tonight. So, let's bow our heads and
[0:15] pray. Almighty God, we thank you, Lord,
[0:17] to be gathered in your name, Father.
[0:20] Lord, we thank you that we could connect
[0:22] this way, Lord. And we want to Lord get
[0:26] ourselves into the spirit of the Lord
[0:28] and begin to Lord, separate ourselves
[0:31] from everything else, Father, every
[0:32] other distraction, Lord, and get that
[0:34] locked in with you tonight. We pray,
[0:37] dear God, that you would bless each and
[0:38] everyone as they would begin to call
[0:40] themselves aside now for prayer. Lord,
[0:43] we seek your face tonight, Lord. We know
[0:45] that you alone have the answers, Lord,
[0:46] Father, that we seek tonight. So Lord,
[0:49] we commit, Lord, this prayer time into
[0:51] your hands, Father. This service, Lord,
[0:53] this this time of prayer and worship and
[0:56] praise and faith and the word, we commit
[0:58] into your hands tonight, dear God. And
[0:59] we pray, Lord, it will be a great
[1:01] blessing for us all, Lord, Father. We
[1:03] all need you, Lord. Lord, we bring our
[1:05] needs before you, Father, knowing that
[1:07] you will provide for our needs according
[1:08] to your riches and glory. May a blessed
[1:10] time of your word being spoken to us
[1:12] tonight. pray it'll be a a a great
[1:15] inspiration tonight, Father. It will
[1:17] help us to key in, oh God, Father, to
[1:19] the season and time in which we're

[1:22] you all the praise, honor, and glory

[9:12] Oh, I have known the father's
[9:16] care for me.
[9:19] He's been good.
[9:23] He's been good through it all. He's
[9:28] always there for me.
[9:33] It's been good to me
[9:38] through the storm,
[9:41] through the night.
[9:45] But what made
[9:48] everything will be all right
[9:52] cuz I have a father
[9:56] care for me.
[9:59] has been
[10:03] all
[10:07] the
[10:09] care for me. He's been there. He's been
[10:14] there.
[10:16] He's been there through it all. He's
[10:21] always
[10:22] there for me.
[10:27] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[10:37] Heat. Heat.
[10:48] Oh,
[10:58] God.
[11:00] You are
[11:05] God.
[11:07] You are
[11:13] you
[11:17] serious
[11:23] prayer. Oh God
[11:28] pray.
[11:30] Oh, God
[11:33] answers
[11:34] prayer.
[11:37] God
[11:39] answerers pray.
[11:42] He so good
[11:45] to me. Well, just praise him right now
[11:49] on your way tonight.
[12:05] He's so good.
[12:08] He's so good.
[12:15] Oh, God.
[12:18] He's so good.
[12:21] He's so good.
[12:29] Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Uh let us
[12:32] tonight bow our heads for a word of
[12:33] prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[12:36] for guiding us together. And it's such a
[12:38] great honor and privilege that we could
[12:40] gather around this end time message. And
[12:43] truly this message give us spiritual
[12:46] inter insight into what has happened,
[12:48] what is happening, and what is about to
[12:50] happen. And father, you said that this
[12:54] bride will be a haunted, persecuted
[12:56] group. And even right now, Lord, the
[12:59] American experience is unlike anything
[13:02] that they've ever seen before, even to
[13:05] their own people. And Lord, they just
[13:07] have a prelude of what is yet to come.
[13:10] The bride will be a hunted, persecuted
[13:14] group, Lord, that they're going to close
[13:16] the churches down. All these things are
[13:19] yet to happen. And here we are gathering
[13:22] around this word looking to be
[13:24] empowered, looking to be strengthened,
[13:26] looking to have Lord what it takes to
[13:29] face the challenge of the hour. Because
[13:30] that is what the message came to prepare
[13:33] us to deal with challenges, not to back
[13:35] down, not to give up, not to let go, but
[13:39] to hold strong and to hold the line. So,
[13:43] Father, bless this exhortation tonight,
[13:44] what will be shared. God, you know
[13:47] what's upon my heart. And I pray that
[13:48] you'd bless it and inspire this to the
[13:52] people right where they are in their
[13:53] homes and that the presence of God will
[13:56] minister to them right where they are.
[13:57] In Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And amen.
[14:00] God bless you and thanks for being here
[14:01] tonight. Uh it's a privilege to be in
[14:05] this position that we could share God's
[14:08] word. So if you have your Bibles, I'd
[14:10] like to take two portion of scripture.
[14:12] one from Hebrews chapter 2 1 verse verse
[14:15] 1 and Hebrews 6 11 and 12. These are the
[14:19] scriptures we're going to use tonight.
[14:21] Begin to start it off with Hebrews 2:1
[14:24] reads, "Therefore,
[14:26] we ought to give the more earnest heed
[14:28] to the things which we have heard, least
[14:32] at any time we should let them slip."
[14:37] Hebrews 6 verse 11 and 12
[14:42] Paul speaks and we desire that every one
[14:45] of you do show the same diligence
[14:51] to the full assurance of hope unto the
[14:54] end. that ye be not slothful,
[14:58] but followers of them who through faith
[15:01] and patience inherit
[15:05] the promises. Now this last verse here,
[15:08] followers of them. In other words,
[15:11] imitate them who through faith and
[15:14] patience
[15:16] inherit the promises. May God bless his
[15:19] word.
[15:21] So tonight I have a title that I've
[15:23] titled this give the more earnest heed
[15:27] to the things which we have heard.
[15:30] It means to take an extra air
[15:34] to take extra a conscious
[15:38] intentional mind to what what you're
[15:40] hearing. You know the Bible speaks about
[15:43] don't be a hearer of the word only but
[15:46] be a doer.
[15:48] What that means? There are people that
[15:49] just here. They love to hear. They're
[15:53] not in the doing part. They like to
[15:56] argue, debate, hear, respond.
[16:01] Abraham use a word. Satan is the
[16:02] greatest sophist or the biggest
[16:04] argument, debater. That's what he is.
[16:08] But the part I want to get to tonight is
[16:10] that be not slutful.
[16:14] Slutful.
[16:16] What does it mean to be slotful?
[16:19] Bible called that word slotful. That
[16:22] word slotful means lazy.
[16:25] Someone who is slotful is lazy
[16:29] and unwilling to make the effort to
[16:31] work.
[16:34] So it's lazy, idle, inactive.
[16:40] Slutful goes beyond physical laziness.
[16:44] It includes spiritual negligence, lack
[16:47] of discipline, and failure to act when
[16:50] God calls for obedience.
[16:53] Don't be slothful.
[16:57] And I'll keep saying it. I've said it
[16:59] over and over. The people in this
[17:01] message now have grown to become
[17:04] entitled.
[17:06] And when you are entitled,
[17:08] you can't really be grateful because you
[17:12] want more and more and nothing is enough
[17:16] because as far as you are concerned,
[17:18] this is what you're supposed to have.
[17:21] This is what you're supposed to get.
[17:24] So
[17:26] if you are entitled
[17:29] or feel entitled,
[17:31] you wouldn't see the need to press, to
[17:34] push, to labor, to sweat. And brother
[17:38] Abraham,
[17:39] he used this scripture, taking heed, and
[17:43] he used this. Oh, may God drive that
[17:46] home in this tabernacle this morning. He
[17:49] says, we ought to give the most earnest
[17:51] heed. What type of people ought we to be
[17:54] when we see the great Jehovah come down
[17:58] and do the things that he does and see
[18:00] them compare scripture by scripture that
[18:02] they're the truth and we sit around
[18:04] sometimes like warts on a log just so
[18:08] unconcerned.
[18:10] We ought to be busy every minute trying
[18:13] to get people to Christ. We ought to be
[18:16] lively stones. We should never be
[18:19] slotful like we are. We'll go to church.
[18:23] We'll see the Lord Jesus do something
[18:25] and bless us in such a way. We'll go
[18:27] back and say very nice meeting. So he's
[18:30] dealing with an attitude at that time in
[18:33] the brand of tabernacle that people were
[18:35] seeing things and say very nice meeting
[18:37] because afterwards they get accustomed
[18:39] to it. They get all the miracles, all
[18:42] the healings. They get accustomed to it.
[18:44] And afterwards, people sat so long in
[18:47] this message. They're accustomed to
[18:48] hearing mysteries, hearing long talk,
[18:51] hearing revelations, hearing
[18:52] informations and knowledge and word that
[18:56] the training now is to come to hear
[18:58] more, get more information and so on.
[19:01] Now listen to this here. Now the
[19:04] preaching of the word, we enjoy it, but
[19:07] that's not the main thing.
[19:11] That's not
[19:13] listen, we should not worship the Lord
[19:17] just after we get through preaching the
[19:19] word as we usually do. Just worship him.
[19:21] That's wonderful. But we should worship
[19:24] him every hour of our life. When we are
[19:28] at work, we should worship him. Every
[19:30] time the opportunity presents itself,
[19:33] worship the Lord by testifying of him.
[19:37] If you see some of you ladies see a
[19:39] woman in the wrong, worship the Lord by
[19:41] taking her and saying, "Sister, there's
[19:44] a better life than this." You men at
[19:46] your work, when you hear a man using the
[19:49] name of the Lord in vain, get a chance
[19:51] to one side, slip over, take him by the
[19:53] hand, and said, "There's a better life
[19:55] than this." You shouldn't use those
[19:57] words. Tell him in a meek, gentle way.
[20:01] All those things is a worship. So he is
[20:06] showing here that worship is beyond
[20:09] coming to church and raise your hands
[20:12] and praise God and you raise your hands.
[20:13] It's beyond that. And when we see
[20:16] someone sick and the doctors say that
[20:19] there's no more can be done, we ought to
[20:22] worship the Lord by telling them there's
[20:25] a God in heaven that answers prayer.
[20:31] Brother Brandham was speaking. Should I
[20:33] read this tonight?
[20:37] And he's talking about a guy
[20:40] who let me see. Okay. All right. I'll
[20:43] just keep we need to go back to the
[20:45] power of God
[20:48] and something that can do the same thing
[20:50] today.
[20:51] Persecution
[20:53] always gives strength to the church. We
[20:56] have had it too easy.
[20:59] We get slough.
[21:01] We get to a place when we don't want to
[21:04] move on because everything is just
[21:07] handed to us. Then he said these words.
[21:11] Are you ready? It takes sorrow
[21:15] and tears
[21:17] and sweat
[21:19] and prayer and faith
[21:23] and promise to move forward in the power
[21:27] of the Holy Spirit. And as your pastor,
[21:32] what I want to see is the church move
[21:34] forward in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[21:38] We can't look back to how it has been.
[21:42] We have to look forward to what God
[21:44] promised.
[21:45] And this is what he said, what it takes.
[21:48] It takes sorrow and tears. And this is
[21:52] where a revival get birthed.
[21:55] A revival get birthed in humility, in
[21:58] repentance, in acknowledging your sins,
[22:01] in putting away sins, known sins. This
[22:05] is where revival fires get a hold.
[22:08] Praying at home, you're putting the Lord
[22:10] to be in front of you. You're putting
[22:13] the Lord to be David said, "As the Lord
[22:16] at my right hand, I shall not be moved."
[22:18] Before you go here, before you speak,
[22:21] before you act, you ask God to intervene
[22:25] and be present. Let me say it one more
[22:27] time.
[22:29] I don't much mysteries people preach and
[22:31] revelations and who high and who is on
[22:34] top and who is the main man and who
[22:36] figure out the man of the hour, how the
[22:37] message of the hour, all of that. It
[22:40] takes sorrow
[22:43] and tears
[22:45] and sweat and prayer and faith and
[22:50] promise to move forward
[22:53] in the power of the Holy Spirit. That
[22:56] zeal and power that they had in those
[22:58] days has long time vanished from our
[23:01] assemblies. I'm afraid if the windows
[23:03] would be shut out at night, people would
[23:05] run every way and never come back. He
[23:07] was talking, this is what I didn't read
[23:09] before. He was talking about when they
[23:11] were running when the Pentecostal move
[23:13] and the Holy Ghost and was running them
[23:14] from from from country to country, from
[23:16] state to state and there was a time a
[23:19] group of people come up and shot through
[23:21] the windows with pistols and rifles and
[23:23] the old an old sister standing there on
[23:25] the floor with her hands up in the air
[23:26] praising God while the windows was being
[23:28] riddled with bullets from rifles and the
[23:30] bullet struck the woman dressed and fell
[23:33] to the floor without harming her. So
[23:36] this is before they could do anything in
[23:38] Hollywood to show bullets falling off
[23:40] and you're protected. This was Holy
[23:42] Ghost protection.
[23:45] And brother Brandham said, "I'm afraid
[23:46] if the windows would be shut out
[23:47] tonight, people would run every way and
[23:49] never come back again."
[23:52] Then he said this here,
[23:58] but human beings are so thoughtful in
[24:00] their mind that it takes an emergency.
[24:05] Something arises and when they do it
[24:08] throws them into desperation and really
[24:10] in doing that in desperation it brings
[24:13] out real thing that you are. It shows
[24:17] what you are made out of in the time of
[24:20] desperation. It usually pulls out all
[24:22] the good things that is in you. So
[24:25] listen friends, we talk about revival
[24:29] not because God promised a bride
[24:30] revival, seven thunder bride revival.
[24:32] This is exclusive bride promises.
[24:34] They're not for church members. They're
[24:35] not for church folks. This for people
[24:37] who's just in the message. This is
[24:39] bride. You say out of a true group of
[24:43] the of the true word who represent
[24:45] Christ with a beloved bride. So the
[24:48] bride comes out of the church in this
[24:51] message. There is a church and there's a
[24:54] bride. The bride is pulled out of the
[24:57] church. So coming out of spiritual
[24:59] dryness,
[25:01] God want to begins a move. And I believe
[25:04] it has started. I think people are
[25:06] coming to themselves and it has to come
[25:09] with brokenness, with humbling, with
[25:12] repentance, a hungering for God,
[25:15] persistent prayer. The wealth revival
[25:18] came after years of prayers by the
[25:19] churches and the emphasis was repentance
[25:22] and holiness and surrender to Christ.
[25:25] The Isuza Street revival from 1906 1909
[25:28] the emphasis was the baptism of the Holy
[25:30] Ghost that came under brother Semo
[25:34] and coming to the end point I call it of
[25:37] the regular church routine because this
[25:40] is what it is now church on Wednesday
[25:42] church on Friday church on Sunday
[25:43] whatever day and people just go in a
[25:45] regular routine but we have to come to a
[25:48] place as individuals where you have a
[25:51] dissatisfaction with your own behavior
[25:54] attitude your own self and that you
[25:56] could come to the place where you have a
[25:58] expectation that God can move and God
[26:01] will move. Not just coming to hear the
[26:03] word but you're coming to see God move.
[26:05] You're coming to expect God to move. A
[26:08] willingness in your heart to obey the
[26:10] word because this is what we see in
[26:12] people not acting upon what they
[26:14] hearing. a willingness to obey the word,
[26:17] to obey the Lord,
[26:19] to obey the spirit, and let it go of
[26:22] pride and personal agendas. Like I said
[26:26] Wednesday night, I'm not there to
[26:27] confirm your dream or your vision or God
[26:29] tell you and what not. That is not what
[26:30] I'm there for. You can't confirm God.
[26:33] God confirmed his word. When a church,
[26:36] as the prophet said, is believing that
[26:38] the Holy Spirit is just as real as it
[26:41] was at Pentecost.
[26:43] We know the quote, custom quote. Listen
[26:46] to this friends. Revival comes from God.
[26:50] Revival comes from God. And prophet said
[26:52] no man, no minister could bring a
[26:54] revival. So I wrote here, the farmer can
[26:57] prepare the ground and sew the seed, but
[27:01] God sends the rain. You'll be a fool not
[27:06] to prepare the ground. You'll be even a
[27:09] bigger fool if you don't sow the seed.
[27:12] Because when the rain falls, what will
[27:14] it fall on? And the ground I'm talking
[27:17] about here is your heart.
[27:19] Who is responsible
[27:21] to get your heart ready? The Bible said
[27:25] his wife had made a herself.
[27:28] But what I'm saying here has nothing to
[27:31] do with church. Nothing to do with
[27:33] church. Doesn't matter what church
[27:34] anybody believes because Jesus explained
[27:38] this in the very first parable that he
[27:40] presented. Some fell on the wayside.
[27:42] That's a heart. Some fell on rocks.
[27:45] That's another type of heart. The first
[27:47] is totally unprepared. That's wayside.
[27:51] The second is partially prepared rocks
[27:54] short for a while and then dry up. The
[27:56] third
[27:58] thorns
[28:00] were vines
[28:02] tied up, tangled up, choked.
[28:05] And the last ground, good ground, he
[28:07] calls it, bring forth fruit to
[28:10] perfection.
[28:12] So these four groups are in the message.
[28:15] These four groups are here in go a
[28:18] prophet and what the brother Ram say.
[28:19] These are four groups within churches.
[28:22] These are four hearts within lives. You
[28:25] have a particular heart here tonight
[28:27] that fits into one of those categories.
[28:30] Wayside,
[28:32] stony,
[28:34] thorny, and good ground.
[28:37] Listen to this now. But Brana,
[28:41] notice something about Mary. This is
[28:43] Mary who see be done in accord. She did
[28:47] not wait till she was positive.
[28:50] She didn't wait till she felt life or
[28:52] some physical sign that she was going to
[28:54] have a baby before she said anything
[28:56] about it. She took God's word. Here we
[28:59] go.
[29:00] God word was good enough for her and she
[29:02] started rejoicing right away. So tell me
[29:05] something. If there is no rejoicing, if
[29:08] there is no worship, if there's no
[29:10] atmosphere, what word people taking in,
[29:13] it doesn't make sense. This here is what
[29:15] God says. If you take the word, you will
[29:19] start to rejoice, not complain. Because
[29:22] complaining does what? Weakens your
[29:24] faith. What complaining does? Hinders
[29:26] your faith. And everything of God is of
[29:28] faith. So the devil want you to
[29:31] complain, want you to be angry, want you
[29:34] to be upset, want you to be, hear me,
[29:37] hear me tonight, triggered.
[29:39] And if you are easily triggered, that
[29:42] mean you could be easily manipulated.
[29:44] Because when you are triggered, you
[29:46] wouldn't say the right things and you
[29:48] wouldn't act the right way because
[29:50] you're under a pressure by the trigger
[29:52] that trigger you. You have to get over
[29:55] that. You have to come out of that. And
[29:58] then brother Abraham said, "Oh,
[29:59] evangelist temple, if you people here
[30:01] tonight, you know it's the will of God
[30:03] to break forth here tonight. You know
[30:05] it's the will of God to send a revival
[30:07] in this tabernacle tonight. God give the
[30:09] promise. I've been asked to stay over
[30:11] another week. I've accepted it to stay
[30:13] another week because I Mary didn't wait
[30:16] till she was positive. She didn't wait
[30:19] till she seen a physical sign. Mary
[30:21] could have waited till she had come to a
[30:23] sign she was going to be a mother. You
[30:25] could wait after the meeting over until
[30:27] you feel that you could move your
[30:28] leg and you'll feel a little
[30:30] better or you could hear a little better
[30:32] from that of that death or the cancer
[30:34] seemed to be that it wasn't bothering
[30:35] you so much. That is not taking God at
[30:40] his word.
[30:41] To take God at his word, here we go. Is
[30:45] to hear his word and accept it and start
[30:48] rejoicing with it. So, you know what
[30:50] this means? If you take God and his
[30:52] words and you hit that tabernacle, you
[30:54] come into the church right away, you
[30:57] have to be able to be in a spirit of
[30:58] rejoicing and thanking God because that
[31:00] that word is yours. That word become
[31:04] personal. You know, somebody give you a
[31:05] gift and you have a joy to receive a
[31:07] gift. That gift is not for everybody.
[31:10] You got the gift. It is wrapped. It have
[31:12] your name on it. It have a tag on it for
[31:14] you that is yours. You are grateful. You
[31:16] are thankful because you got a gift. You
[31:18] can rejoice. This is what we're talking
[31:20] about. Without sensation, without
[31:22] feeling, without emotions, you just
[31:23] start to thank God and praise God for
[31:25] his word.
[31:27] Now, friends, for a while now, I'm
[31:29] trying to get you to see how God sees
[31:32] things. And he said, "My thoughts are
[31:35] not your thoughts." And we are impressed
[31:37] many of times with our own thoughts only
[31:39] to realize our own thoughts is is
[31:41] foolishness. Right? What is important is
[31:43] God thoughts. Now in Matthew 25
[31:47] when the parable of the talent 10
[31:50] talents five talents 10 produce 10 five
[31:52] produce five and one bury it and that
[31:54] guy he had a lot of talks a lot of mouth
[31:56] he's a mo champion and then verse 26
[32:00] said his lord answered and said to him
[32:02] thou wicked and cut for servant now from
[32:05] a humanistic standpoint we could say the
[32:08] man lost anything what he got is what he
[32:11] gave back but that is not how God
[32:13] interprets that's Oh, how God sees
[32:15] things. God called him a wicked and
[32:17] slutful servant. Thou kneest that I reap
[32:20] where I sowed not, guarded where I have
[32:22] not stra. Thou artest therefore to have
[32:25] put my money to the exchanges, and that
[32:28] at my coming I should have received mine
[32:30] who owned with usery or with uh
[32:33] interest, right? Take therefore the
[32:37] talent from him, and give it unto him
[32:39] which are 10 talents. For unto everyone
[32:42] that hath shall be given, and he shall
[32:45] have abundance. So he is saying, when
[32:48] you have, you'll get more. You'll have
[32:50] abundance. But from him that hath not
[32:52] shall be taken away even that which he
[32:55] hat, and cast ye the unprofitable
[32:59] servant into outer darkness, there'll be
[33:02] weeping and nashing of teeth. From this
[33:04] scripture here, you could see clearly
[33:06] that God is interested in profitability.
[33:09] God is interested in increase. God
[33:11] interested in reproduction. That's the
[33:13] whole law of a seed. A seed is not
[33:14] buried to bring forth one more seed. A
[33:17] seed is buried to bring forth abundance
[33:19] 100fold, 60fold, 80fold. You don't
[33:21] burying one seed to bring forth one
[33:23] seed. That doesn't make any sense. When
[33:25] he tell Adam, multiply, replenish. He
[33:27] didn't expect Adam to do just one seed.
[33:29] No. The earth must be filled. His bar
[33:32] must be filled. The wedding supper must
[33:34] be filled. Okay. Romans 12:10-13.
[33:38] We going here. All right. Romans 12-13.
[33:41] Be kindly affection one to another with
[33:44] brotherly love.
[33:46] That's an effort there to be kind.
[33:50] To be kind means you want to tell
[33:52] somebody good morning, hello, hi, how
[33:54] you doing? That's being kind.
[33:57] How are things with you?
[34:00] In honor prefer one another. Not you
[34:02] some big shot some big sawati. I'm some
[34:04] big up somewhere and you your head
[34:06] passing and you passing everything
[34:08] straight and like you have no manners
[34:10] seen it plain tonight
[34:13] be say you have no brought up se who who
[34:16] who bring you up
[34:19] be kindly affection one to another with
[34:22] brotherly love in honor preferring one
[34:26] another. So that eliminates selfishness,
[34:29] that eliminates jostling because you are
[34:32] preferring your brother, you're
[34:33] preferring your sister. Then verse 11,
[34:37] astonishing word, not slotful in
[34:40] business.
[34:42] And that business, I don't want you to
[34:43] see it as business outside like like you
[34:45] have a business and so on. I want you to
[34:47] see as God's business, not slotful in
[34:50] business, but fervent in spirit serving
[34:53] the Lord. So God don't want no half dead
[34:56] Christian. He don't want no half dead
[34:58] worship, half dead attitude, half dead
[35:00] coming to church, half dead serving him.
[35:02] He want you to be fervent in spirit
[35:04] serving the Lord, rejoicing in hope,
[35:06] patient in tribulation, continuing
[35:09] instant in prayer and you see no way
[35:11] frustrated and you want to give up and
[35:13] your your your temper and your anger.
[35:15] No. Distributing to the necessity of
[35:18] saints given to hospitality
[35:25] what Brandham said here
[35:28] what good someone give my boy after this
[35:31] is over if God's willing we take our
[35:32] vacation go up to the mountain to hunt
[35:35] what good did it do the man to give him
[35:37] a gun if he isn't going to use it is set
[35:41] in there a fine gun but he will never do
[35:43] good unless he uses
[35:46] Listen tonight. That's the way your
[35:49] faith is. It's a fine faith. You read.
[35:54] I'm still read. You believe. You have an
[35:57] experience with God. You believe. But
[35:59] faith without works is dead. Put it to
[36:02] work.
[36:04] Don't be slutful. Get it going.
[36:09] And then
[36:11] you see where I'm at. them on the
[36:14] repeat. Okay. Page four, the nine pages
[36:17] here. Then he said this, God recognizing
[36:22] there's message,
[36:24] I want you to think about his word.
[36:27] Create in me a revival.
[36:31] Let me be the revival.
[36:34] Note, he say revival in the church. Rev
[36:38] tabernacle that is external.
[36:42] Yes. Say Lord bless us Lord. Send a
[36:44] revival father send a fing tabernacle
[36:46] church. We are not talking about the
[36:48] church. We talking about you, me, us
[36:53] individuals. God
[36:56] create in me. You know what? Let's say
[36:59] tonight right where you are. Repeat
[37:00] after me. God
[37:03] create in me a revival.
[37:06] Let me be the revival.
[37:10] Let each one of us be the revive,
[37:14] the revival in me.
[37:18] Make me, Lord, to hunger.
[37:22] Make me to thirst.
[37:25] Create in me, Lord,
[37:28] that what is needed in me.
[37:32] Let me
[37:34] from this hour on be thine,
[37:38] more consecrated servant, a better
[37:41] servant, more blessed of you,
[37:45] more able,
[37:47] more humbler,
[37:49] more kinder,
[37:51] more willing to work,
[37:54] more looking to the things that are
[37:56] positive
[37:58] and forgetting the things that are in
[38:00] the past and the negative. hips. Let me
[38:03] press towards the mark of the high
[38:06] calling of Christ. Amen. Praise the name
[38:09] of the Lord. May God bless you. All of
[38:12] you who confess this is words that you
[38:14] have to speak. Many times we say the
[38:18] wrong thing.
[38:20] Change your words.
[38:23] Change what you speak.
[38:26] What spoke here? We said we could do
[38:29] this quickly.
[38:32] This prophet is amazing man. You know
[38:35] people uh talk about the revelations and
[38:39] the mysteries and so on. But there's
[38:42] something so outstanding about his life.
[38:45] The people that he could work with, the
[38:48] people that he hunted with, the people
[38:51] that he worked with all wasn't
[38:53] Christians. There are some of us who
[38:54] religious
[38:56] and give you a chance. You put you in a
[38:58] bag, a sack and you climb up some
[39:00] mountain, stay by yourself somewhere and
[39:01] see the world and thing and you you in a
[39:03] religious framework. You're not in the
[39:05] real world.
[39:06] Jesus said they are in the world but not
[39:09] of the world. You have to get a balance.
[39:11] You have to be able to plug into God and
[39:13] man. I want to repeat that. Listen to
[39:17] this prophet.
[39:20] He says
[39:22] the law say you could kill a phone.
[39:24] That's a young uh uh um thing and and
[39:29] there's nothing against it but not just
[39:32] to keep shooting them. It's a perversion
[39:35] your attitude. So he's talking about
[39:36] this man that will hunt with him. He
[39:39] will just shoot his little phones. I
[39:40] said Bert, you don't have to do that.
[39:43] You are the meanest guy I ever seen.
[39:47] I don't think anybody right now would be
[39:50] shooting or hunting or going out with
[39:52] any meanest guy you ever seen. I don't
[39:53] think so. Like that's not how our
[39:56] religious framework made up right now.
[39:59] And this is what I want to show you
[40:01] here. Brother Brham was hunting with
[40:04] this man. The man said, "Oh, Billy, get
[40:07] next to yourself. You're a
[40:08] chicken-hearted preacher." The man know
[40:11] Billy's a preacher. He called him
[40:13] chickenarted. I said, "Why?" I said, "It
[40:15] don't take a chickenarted preacher to
[40:16] know right from wrong." I said, "You
[40:18] shouldn't do that."
[40:21] One year when I went up there, he had a
[40:23] little whistle. He could take that
[40:26] little whistle and it will go like a
[40:28] little baby deer crying for its money. I
[40:30] thought, "You are not going to use that
[40:32] bell." He said, "Oh, get next to
[40:34] yourself, Billy." Now right here
[40:37] with your present thinking with your
[40:40] present Christianity
[40:42] if you was with this bird guy and he
[40:45] bring this whistle to whistle like a
[40:46] baby phone you stay with him or you
[40:49] saying you pack up you done hunting wait
[40:51] where you went or you moving with this
[40:53] bird guy he said get next yourself Billy
[40:57] we went hunting that day a very fine
[41:00] hunter oh you see that the man is the
[41:03] meanest man but He's a fine hunter. I
[41:07] love to follow with him. Okay. So, this
[41:10] man know the bush. You know the bush.
[41:13] This man know his stuff. And we had
[41:15] separate in the woods and you will never
[41:17] have to think about hunting him. He
[41:20] knowed where he was at. He hunted till
[41:23] about noon together. And then we were
[41:25] going to separate and go back down
[41:27] different mountains to come back to our
[41:28] camp. Just before 11:30 was walking in
[41:32] front. We hadn't seen a track at all.
[41:34] And there was about a 6 in snow on the
[41:36] ground. Good tracking weather. But the
[41:37] deer season had been on for a while and
[41:40] much shooting going on. And the deers
[41:41] were all afraid. We call it spooked.
[41:44] They were scared. Stay in the tickets
[41:46] under the bush piles wherever they could
[41:48] be, especially when the daylight was on.
[41:50] So he kindly stooped down little
[41:52] opening. And the first thing you know, I
[41:54] seen him reach into his coat. I thought
[41:56] he was going to get his lunch. We had
[41:58] our lunch together. We packed our hot
[42:00] chocolate and some sandwiches where we
[42:02] got lost. and he reached in deer and
[42:04] pulled out this little old whistle and
[42:06] he gave a little cry. When he did, just
[42:09] across the opening about the distance of
[42:12] this place, a mother do stood up. Now,
[42:16] that's the mother deer, the dough. She
[42:19] was a beautiful animal. It I'll never
[42:21] forget how she looked. She raised up
[42:24] those great big beautiful ears standing
[42:27] up, big brown eyes, and the veins look
[42:30] like in her face. You could just see
[42:31] them. And he looked around me, that
[42:34] lizard looked in his eyes, kindly pulled
[42:36] himself down. He said, "But I thought,
[42:39] Bert, you won't do that." And I heard
[42:41] the lever come back and he bolt back and
[42:45] throwed the shell into that 30 rifle.
[42:53] I said, "But surely you won't." So he
[42:55] squeal again like that, the old mother
[42:57] day. And now very unusual for them to
[43:00] raise up like that. Praise it. Are you
[43:03] following me? Are you hearing me
[43:04] clearly? Anybody hearing me? Okay, let's
[43:08] watch.
[43:10] And she walked right out into the
[43:12] opening. Now, any of you brethren that
[43:14] hunt knows they won't do that. What it
[43:17] was though? What was she standing there
[43:20] and both moved and the deer saw him? Did
[43:22] she run? No, she stood there. What was
[43:25] it? She wasn't playing church. She was a
[43:29] mother. There was something in her was
[43:31] real. It was real love. A baby was
[43:35] crying and she had something in her that
[43:39] called and answered. She was a mother.
[43:42] She seen the hunter. She quiver a few
[43:45] times and she looked again for that
[43:47] baby. I seen Brett B. But leveled that
[43:50] rifle down. The scope here would come
[43:52] right across her heart. I thought, "Oh,
[43:55] he was a dead shot." I thought, "Oh my,
[43:57] in another second or two, he will blow a
[43:59] lawyer heart plum to her." I thought,
[44:01] "How can you do it, Bert? How can you be
[44:04] so mean? That mother out there
[44:06] displaying real mother's love. She isn't
[44:08] a hypocrite. There's a baby in trouble.
[44:11] Doesn't know that she's a mother. How I
[44:13] thought, how can you do it? That big
[44:17] 180 grain bullet that close would blow a
[44:19] 15t and blow a hard plum through." I
[44:21] thought, "But how you can do it, you
[44:24] cruelhearted man. Shoot that poor mother
[44:26] heart right out." I turned my back. I
[44:28] thought, "Oh, God, have mercy on that
[44:29] man. How can he be so cruel?" I waited.
[44:33] Waited.
[44:34] The gun never fired.
[44:37] I turned to look and he looked around at
[44:40] me and the tears running down his
[44:43] cheeks. He threw the gun on the ground.
[44:46] He said, "Billy, I've had enough. Tell
[44:48] me about Jesus."
[44:50] This is too much tonight. There on the
[44:53] bank of snow, I lead that cruelarted man
[44:56] to Christ. Why? Not my preaching. No,
[45:02] but because he's seen something real.
[45:05] He's seen something that was not put on.
[45:08] He's seen something genuine. And I am
[45:11] telling you tonight, friends, the world
[45:14] is looking for something genuine, not a
[45:16] man-made creed. So the bravery of that
[45:19] mother do that came right up to him
[45:22] fearless break that man.
[45:25] He said watch I'm telling you tonight
[45:27] friends the world is looking for
[45:28] something genuine not a man-made creed
[45:32] but a Jesus who lives and reigns and
[45:34] brings love and peace and joy and breaks
[45:37] down differences and makes men love men.
[45:39] Women love women. The world wants to see
[45:41] something real. Brother, sister, God's
[45:44] got it for you. It is here right now.
[45:47] Just meet the real thing. Just become
[45:49] much Christian as she was a mother. I
[45:52] don't care. They call you holy ruler.
[45:53] They call you fanatic. They you will
[45:56] stand in the face of the enemy and
[45:57] declare that you love God. That's what
[45:59] faith. That is what we need tonight,
[46:01] friends. Something real. Then he said,
[46:04] "Let's bow our heads." Now I wonder
[46:06] while we are waiting a minute, would
[46:08] there be someone in the building tonight
[46:10] that raise your hand saying, "God, give
[46:12] me that kind of spirit of Christianity
[46:15] that makes me as loyal to Christ as that
[46:17] mother dear was for a baby. Lord, I've
[46:19] been a church member for years. I'll
[46:21] profess to be a Christian, but really I
[46:22] haven't got that real something. I need
[46:24] a real faith. I need a born-again
[46:26] experienced God. I need those secret
[46:28] sands that will change me from a
[46:30] cowardly doubter into a real faith
[46:32] warrior that can take God at his word."
[46:34] You want to be remembered in prayer,
[46:36] raise up your hands above you, all over
[46:37] the building. God bless you. That's
[46:39] good. You say, "God, remember me." And
[46:40] so on. He said, "Now I've been very
[46:43] zealous of my nomation." You should be.
[46:45] That's good. But don't never put that
[46:48] ahead of Christ. That is where the
[46:49] church is slipping tonight is getting
[46:52] away over on creeds. Then decrees in the
[46:54] messages. I believe this and you order
[46:56] to believe that. I believe this way. I
[46:57] see it. So then my angle and all that
[46:59] all is foolishness in God's sight.
[47:02] Brother Brham came to introduce Jesus
[47:04] Christ. Not message wars, message
[47:06] fights, not debates. He said, "Come back
[47:09] to Christ." Think of it. Say, "God
[47:12] created me a love. Give me faith." Just
[47:15] as much faith to stand for you and to
[47:18] accept my healing tonight. That mother
[47:21] there had to stand there fearless
[47:23] because something wasn't her was real.
[47:26] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[47:29] I close.
[47:34] Are we going tonight? Okay.
[47:39] He's talking about the the box car and
[47:42] when things are loose, he goes by a lot
[47:44] of our lives. The reason we don't get
[47:46] the Holy Ghost, we might carry on act
[47:48] like we got it, but the fruits are
[47:49] known. So, he's looking to shake up that
[47:51] buskar. What did he do? Justification,
[47:54] he called her. Sanification, he cleansed
[47:56] her. The Holy Ghost, he sealed her. Pack
[47:59] a tight, close the door, and the last
[48:01] thing, put a seal to seal unto the
[48:04] destination. Grieve not the Holy Spirit,
[48:06] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[48:08] your destination. When God give you the
[48:10] Holy Ghost, it's a finished work. And
[48:12] there's the final quote here tonight,
[48:16] Brother Brandon.
[48:18] He says, "Oh God,
[48:21] let us check up tonight.
[48:23] Grant it knowing that these great things
[48:27] are only warning us of the soon
[48:30] rapturing church.
[48:32] And if we are laden with sin,
[48:34] with unbelief,
[48:36] and with slutfulness,
[48:39] we shall not make that rapture. We know
[48:43] it, Lord. So we pray father that you
[48:46] will burn into us the Holy Ghost dong
[48:49] our hearts oh God set our souls on fire
[48:53] with your blessing help us to
[48:55] understand. I want to read that part
[48:57] again. If we are laden with sin
[49:00] with unbelief
[49:02] with slothfulness
[49:04] we shall not make that rapture. We know
[49:08] it Lord. So we pray that you will burn
[49:10] into us the Holy Ghost down into our
[49:13] hearts. Oh God, set our souls on fire
[49:16] with your blessing. Help us to
[49:18] understand. Let's bow.
[49:21] Heavenly Father, I've shared what you
[49:25] put upon my heart to share with your
[49:26] people
[49:28] that they should take earnest heed
[49:32] that things would not s
[49:34] God. The message would have become
[49:36] arrogant, proud, indifferent.
[49:40] Berly cars have been kicked out the door
[49:43] and they're content
[49:45] how they are.
[49:48] Lord, you said the bride, she was
[49:51] asleep. There was no revival to stir the
[49:54] bride, to wake up the bride. And seven
[49:56] thunders is what going to wake up this
[49:59] bride. She was in a slumber. Oh God, the
[50:02] church is slumbering. God, I pray
[50:04] tonight that this be a wake up call. I
[50:07] pray tonight that this will stir their
[50:09] spirits up like how you stir them up to
[50:11] build the temple. Like how you stir them
[50:13] up to get men that handle craft and
[50:15] brass and all that is necessary to put
[50:18] it together. Oh Jesus, come tonight and
[50:21] set the church in order. Oh Jesus, come
[50:23] tonight and put fire into every soul. Oh
[50:26] Jesus, come tonight and burn revelation
[50:29] and vision into people's lives. Oh God,
[50:32] I've seen it, Lord. I've seen it so
[50:33] clear, so plain with clarity. No
[50:37] minister could bring a revival. It has
[50:38] to come
[50:40] by the people. Therefore, the people
[50:43] have to see something. You told Habac,
[50:46] write the vision and make it plain.
[50:47] Brother Brandon wrote it. You have it on
[50:49] books and tapes. And you have ministers
[50:51] coming behind that prophet to make the
[50:54] vision plain. That prophet said, "I hope
[50:57] that these men could make take the
[51:00] message to make more sense to it to
[51:03] bring it to a place where the seeds
[51:05] could come to life."
[51:08] God, he didn't send the message for us
[51:10] to just to talk about we have a message.
[51:13] He sent a message that we could become
[51:14] the message, a manifestation of the word
[51:17] of God. Father, tonight stir the
[51:19] husbands, stir the wives, stir the
[51:22] mothers and fathers. Lord, let the
[51:24] mothers look back and see.
[51:27] Was I a great mother? What kind of
[51:29] mother? What kind of mother am I? What
[51:33] kind of father am I? What kind of son?
[51:35] What kind of daughter?
[51:37] What kind of husband? What kind of wife?
[51:40] Wife rude, wife answering back, wife
[51:43] rebellious, wife manish and bullying.
[51:46] What is that? God, the spirit of wives
[51:50] is in the word. The spirit of the
[51:52] husbands is in the word. The spirits of
[51:54] how to be a father is in the word. You
[51:56] were the first father. You were the
[51:57] first parent. And we could learn from
[51:59] that. We could understand how you felt
[52:02] when Adam fell. How a father would fail
[52:06] and what you did about. You give the
[52:08] example of the prodical son. How the
[52:10] father felt. Even though his son may
[52:13] choose a certain road and end up in a
[52:15] destructive mode, but the father was
[52:18] still looking out for him because once a
[52:20] son always a son. Oh God, help your son
[52:22] and daughters here tonight. We're not
[52:24] here to embarrass anyone or shame
[52:26] anyone. You spoke about thoughtful. You
[52:30] spoke about being an imitator of those
[52:33] who through faith and patience inherit
[52:35] the promises. And Lord Peter said by
[52:39] these promises and the message came to
[52:41] release promises to us. It has nothing
[52:44] to do with pastors, has nothing to do
[52:45] with churches. It has to do with you and
[52:48] your sons, you and your daughters
[52:49] bringing us back to Eden through a
[52:51] message of the hour that have restored
[52:53] the full word to get us back there by
[52:55] you having the preeminences. Oh God,
[52:57] tonight have the preeminences.
[52:59] Overshadow every son, every daughter,
[53:01] overshadow everyone. Anyone that would
[53:03] listen to this may stir their spirit up
[53:06] and set their souls on fire to serve you
[53:09] with ferveny. Not thoughtful in
[53:11] business, not thoughtful in God's
[53:13] business. Not stant in their own
[53:15] business, but to be fervent in spirit,
[53:17] making that progress that will bring
[53:19] glory and honor to your kingdom. You
[53:21] have tested us. You have tried us. You
[53:23] want to see our motive and objective why
[53:25] we want what we want. Why we desire what
[53:27] we desire. You said in your word, we
[53:29] have not. We ask not because we have
[53:31] not. We ask not. And then we ask, we ask
[53:33] for the wrong motive, wrong objective,
[53:34] and don't get it. So help us tonight.
[53:37] Stir our hearts to the right motive, the
[53:39] right objective, that we will work for
[53:41] your kingdom, and we will work for your
[53:42] honor and your glory that your that
[53:44] you'll be glorified in our midst. Even
[53:47] when the Greek said we would see Jesus,
[53:49] Jesus didn't point at himself. He point
[53:51] to the cross when they were received. So
[53:53] father, tonight, take them to Calvary.
[53:55] Take them to the cross. Take them to
[53:56] debt to self. Real debt to self. And
[53:59] debt has a cost. Even as a revival have
[54:01] a cost. Revival always have a price.
[54:05] God, we can't say we want revival and
[54:07] don't want to pay that price. So help
[54:09] the homes here tonight, the
[54:11] dysfunctional homes, the homes that are
[54:13] not right, the homes that need to get
[54:16] right. Help them tonight and stir their
[54:18] hearts and spirits. I come with them at
[54:19] their hands in Jesus name I ask it. Amen
[54:22] and amen and amen. God bless you. So
[54:25] friends, this is what I have on my heart
[54:27] and I trust them that it would be a help
[54:30] to you as you get in and pray tonight.
[54:32] So God be with you as we get on and
[54:34] pray. God bless you. Praise the Lord.

[1:37:34] Father, we praise you, Father. We thank
[1:37:36] you. We thank you for your presence,
[1:37:38] Lord. We thank you for your spirit,
[1:37:40] Father. We thank you for making a way.
[1:37:42] We thank you how you keep your word when
[1:37:44] the enemy come like a flood. Lord, the
[1:37:46] spirit rais the standard. We thank you
[1:37:48] for healings. We thank you for miracles.
[1:37:51] We thank you for restoration. We thank
[1:37:53] you for revival. We thank you for the
[1:37:55] appointment of the baptism of the Holy
[1:37:56] Ghost. We thank you for adoption. We
[1:37:58] thank you for perfection. We thank you
[1:38:00] for the awakening, Lord, a spiritual
[1:38:01] awakening. We thank you for coming out
[1:38:03] of drought, coming out of dry and barren
[1:38:05] land into the land of bliss, the land of
[1:38:08] water. Father, oh God, you said he that
[1:38:10] believeth on me, as the scripture had
[1:38:12] said, out of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:38:14] of living water. And you promised life
[1:38:16] to come, Lord. Oh God, the farmer have a
[1:38:18] responsibility to prepare the land. The
[1:38:20] farmer have a responsibility to plow the
[1:38:22] land. The farmer have a responsibility
[1:38:24] to sew the seed. But Lord, your part is
[1:38:26] to send out the rain. And oh God,
[1:38:28] tonight you send Lord a prophet Lord who
[1:38:31] revealed the son of man who brought this
[1:38:33] complete seed. The seed is whole. The
[1:38:36] seed is complete. The seed is perfect.
[1:38:38] Not Jacob grace seed, but Julia
[1:38:41] perfection seed. It's perfect. And
[1:38:43] father, that's a seed that you put in
[1:38:45] the heart of a bride. a seventh under
[1:38:47] sea of perfection. Oh God, the secret is
[1:38:49] the word is in the bride. And now Lord,
[1:38:52] we pray you would send the rain, the
[1:38:54] rain of promise, the rain that you
[1:38:56] promised, Lord. Even since Joel shall
[1:38:58] come to pass, Lord, you're going to pour
[1:39:00] that rain, even the latter rain, oh God,
[1:39:02] the former and latter rain in the same
[1:39:04] month. Oh God, come tonight, Lord. Pour
[1:39:06] upon your people, Father. Pour into
[1:39:08] their homes, Lord. Pour into their
[1:39:10] hearts, Lord. May it be a rejuvenation,
[1:39:12] Father. May there be a revival, Father.
[1:39:14] I ask them to say the words, "Oh,
[1:39:16] creating me a revival. Let me be the
[1:39:19] revival. Create in me a revival. Let me
[1:39:22] be the revival." It's down to personal.
[1:39:24] Father, oh God, ownership of that
[1:39:26] revival, oh God, start that revival
[1:39:28] tonight in the homes and lives of your
[1:39:31] children. And when we come on Sunday,
[1:39:33] Father, may there be an explosion of
[1:39:35] righteousness. May your righteousness,
[1:39:36] oh God, fall as rain. Father, may there
[1:39:39] be explosion of your glory, of your
[1:39:40] power, of your presence. and confirm
[1:39:42] your word with signs, wonders, and
[1:39:44] miracles. Bless the church, Lord. Bless
[1:39:45] your people, Father. Bless their
[1:39:47] ministry, Father. Bless the elders, the
[1:39:49] deacons, oh God, the helps, the
[1:39:51] trustees, the ushers, Lord, from the
[1:39:53] backbench to the the pulpit to the
[1:39:55] backbench. Father, the musicians,
[1:39:57] Father, the Sunday school, Father. Oh
[1:39:59] God, all the technicians, the sound
[1:40:01] service leaders, Lord, all the staff,
[1:40:03] Father God, may you bless them in a
[1:40:05] special way. May they be excited, oh,
[1:40:08] coming to church. maybe under great
[1:40:09] expectation. Oh God, to see you work
[1:40:11] among us, to see you come among us,
[1:40:13] Lord. Lord, the prophet not only preach
[1:40:15] the word, but he got to wait afterwards
[1:40:17] to wait on the angel and to see the
[1:40:19] angel work and the angel move. Oh God,
[1:40:21] may you come among us, Father, because
[1:40:23] he said when he is gone, healing is not
[1:40:25] gone. Oh God, the power is not gone. Oh
[1:40:28] God, the angel already descended with a
[1:40:29] shout. Oh God, and here we are, Father.
[1:40:32] You said the Holy Spirit, oh, the
[1:40:34] manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that
[1:40:36] angel trying to get the people back to
[1:40:37] the word because you could only confirm
[1:40:39] and vindicate the word. So Lord, I
[1:40:40] commit them into your hands. I thank you
[1:40:42] for them gathered here tonight, Lord.
[1:40:44] May you bless them and their families,
[1:40:45] Father. Forgive their past and bless
[1:40:47] their future. Commit them into your
[1:40:49] hands in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and
[1:40:51] amen. God bless you. Thanks again for be
[1:40:53] here tonight. May God give you a victory
[1:40:55] upon victory. Come to church on the
[1:40:57] great expectation that God will do above
[1:40:59] that we can ask or think. God bless you.
[1:41:01] We are this.
