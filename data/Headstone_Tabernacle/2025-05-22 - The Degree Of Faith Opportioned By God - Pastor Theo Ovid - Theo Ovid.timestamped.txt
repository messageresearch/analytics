[19:31] reading and prayer.
[19:35] Psalm chapter
[19:37] 24, which says, "The earth is the Lord's
[19:41] and the fullness
[19:42] thereof, the world and they that dwell
[19:46] therein. For he hath founded it upon the
[19:49] seas, and established it upon the
[19:52] floods. Who shall ascend into the hill
[19:55] of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his
[19:59] holy place? He that hath clean hands and
[20:03] a pure heart, who hath not lifted up his
[20:05] soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully,
[20:09] he shall receive the blessings from the
[20:10] Lord and righteousness from the God of
[20:13] his
[20:15] salvation. This is the generation of
[20:17] them that seek him, that seek thy face,
[20:21] oh Jacob. Silah, lift up your heads, oh
[20:25] ye gates, and be lift up ye everlasting
[20:27] doors and the king of glory shall come
[20:30] in. Who is this king of glory? The Lord
[20:34] strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in
[20:36] battle. Lift up your heads, oh ye gates.
[20:40] Even lift them up, ye everlasting doors,
[20:43] and the King of glory shall come in. Who
[20:46] is this King of glory? The Lord of
[20:48] hosts. He is the king of glory. Sailor,
[20:54] may God add blessing to the reading of
[20:55] his word. Let's bow our heads as we pray
[20:58] and commit the service unto the Lord.

[33:30] Lord. Teach me
[33:33] Lord to win. Father, we praise you
[33:36] tonight and we bless you tonight. We
[33:38] thank you for your presence. We thank
[33:40] you for your spirit. We pray you come
[33:42] down in a special way and have the
[33:44] preeminences. In Jesus name I ask it.
[33:47] Amen and amen. God bless you. Thanks
[33:49] again for coming out tonight. And if you
[33:52] have your Bibles, I'd like you to turn
[33:53] to Romans chapter 12. Within the whole
[33:56] chapter of Romans chapter
[34:02] 12, I beseech you therefore, brethren,
[34:05] by the mercies of God, that you present
[34:07] your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[34:09] acceptable unto God, which is a
[34:11] reasonable service.
[34:14] Be not conformed to this world, but be
[34:17] transformed by the renewing of your
[34:19] mind, that you may prove what is a good
[34:23] and
[34:24] acceptable and perfect will of God. For
[34:27] I say through the grace given unto me to
[34:30] every man that is among you, not to
[34:32] think of himself more highly than he
[34:35] ought to think, but to think soberly,
[34:38] accordingly as God has dealt to every
[34:42] man the measure of faith. For as we have
[34:46] many members in one body, and all
[34:48] members have not the same office, so we
[34:52] being many are one body in Christ, and
[34:56] everyone members one of
[34:58] another. Having then gifts differing
[35:01] according to the grace that is given to
[35:04] us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy
[35:06] according to the proportion of faith, or
[35:09] ministry, let us wait on our
[35:11] ministering. Or he that teacheth on
[35:14] teaching. Or he that exaltth on
[35:16] exhaltation. He that giveth, let him do
[35:19] it with simplicity. He that ruleth with
[35:22] diligence, he that showeth mercy, with
[35:25] cheerfulness. Let love be without
[35:27] dissimilation, uphour. That which is
[35:29] evil, cleave to that which is good. They
[35:32] kindly affection one to another with
[35:34] brotherly love, in honor, preferring one
[35:37] another, not slotful in business, but
[35:40] fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,
[35:42] rejoicing in hope, patient in
[35:44] tribulation, continuing instant in
[35:47] prayer, distributing to the necessity of
[35:49] the saints, given to hospitality. Bless
[35:52] them that persecute you, bless and curse
[35:55] not, rejoice with them that do rejoice,
[35:58] weep with them that weep. Be of the same
[36:01] mind one towards another. Mind not high
[36:05] things, but condescent to men of low
[36:08] estate. Be not wise in your own
[36:12] conceits. Recompense to no man evil for
[36:15] evil. Provide things honest in the sight
[36:17] of all men. If it is possible as much as
[36:21] light in you, live peaceibly with all
[36:23] men. Dearly, beloved, avenge not
[36:26] yourselves, but rather give place unto
[36:28] wrath. For it is written, "Vengeance is
[36:31] mine. I will repay, sayeth the Lord."
[36:34] Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed
[36:36] him. If he thirst, give him drink. For
[36:39] in so doing, you shall heap coals of
[36:41] fire on his head. Be not overcome of
[36:46] evil, but overcome evil with good. Let's
[36:49] bow heads. Heavenly Father, thank you
[36:50] for your word, and it's so good to be
[36:52] here tonight. this exciting time we're
[36:54] living in and to hear words of life and
[36:56] to hear you unfolding this word in
[36:58] simplicity. Father, may you come and
[37:00] confirm your word tonight with the
[37:01] supernatural presence and power and
[37:03] confirm it with signs, wonders, and
[37:05] miracles. We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
[37:08] God bless you. You may be
[37:10] seated. Praise God. Ask God to confirm
[37:13] the word with signs, wonders, and
[37:16] miracles. He's still in the signs,
[37:18] wonders, and miracles business. Oh,
[37:20] praise God. Hallelujah. could heal you
[37:22] completely, deliver you completely, seal
[37:23] you completely, baptize you completely.
[37:26] He's still in the signs. One is the
[37:27] miracle business. Amen. Praise God.
[37:30] So, tonight I have a title
[37:35] uh the degree of faith aortioned by
[37:39] God. I know it sounds strange, but we'll
[37:42] get to it. The degree of faith aortioned
[37:47] by God. The term aortion spelled a p o r
[37:51] t i o n e d refers to the act of
[37:55] dividing and assigning
[37:58] something according to a plan or
[38:01] specific
[38:03] distribution. It is often used in
[38:05] context such as distributing blame
[38:07] resources or responsibility among
[38:10] individual or groups. For example, one
[38:12] might say the costs were aortioned among
[38:14] the team members based on their
[38:18] contributions. So tonight we want to
[38:20] talk about the degree of faith aortioned
[38:22] by God. That's the title actually. But
[38:24] this service tonight is a continuation
[38:26] from Sunday.
[38:28] And after Sunday service I just knew
[38:30] what was next. So Paul
[38:33] here was getting personal when he
[38:38] presented this text that we read.
[38:40] present your body a living sacrifice.
[38:44] Amen. He wasn't talking to the church as
[38:46] a church
[38:47] group. This was speaking to you, the
[38:51] elect, the individual. Isn't that right?
[38:55] And to go further, he spoke about the
[38:58] renewing of the mind. Amen. Now, we read
[39:00] the whole chapter of of Romans chapter
[39:03] 12, and you would see it's all connected
[39:06] together in growth and maturity. To go
[39:11] further, he speaks of the renewal of the
[39:12] mind, a
[39:14] reframing or resetting of your mind. He
[39:18] said, "Be you renewed in the trans a
[39:20] renewing of your mind." Isn't that
[39:21] right? That you may
[39:23] prove what is that good and perfect will
[39:25] of God. Hallelujah. In doing this, you
[39:29] are now in position to prove what is the
[39:32] will of God for you. As God sees you. So
[39:37] in other words, let's back up a little
[39:40] bit. He said, "New heart." Because we
[39:42] don't have a heart towards God. We had a
[39:43] rocky heart, a stony heart against God.
[39:46] So God give you a new heart. Then he
[39:48] said, "New spirit," which is a refreshed
[39:50] spirit that you could get along with the
[39:52] Holy Ghost. Because with your rotten
[39:54] spirit your old Holy Ghost come near
[39:57] that. So you need a new spirit then then
[40:00] he promise his spirit to come inside of
[40:02] there. Now I know this is not taught
[40:04] much in the message but it's still the
[40:06] word. They think because they believe
[40:07] the word and that the message and the
[40:09] head high and you know I guess they
[40:11] smoke some kind of grass or something.
[40:12] So they head high without a transmission
[40:15] of
[40:16] life. But Paul here went further.
[40:21] How to see yourself,
[40:25] how to think about yourself. And this is
[40:29] before you deal with others.
[40:32] This is so important. This was such a
[40:34] thrilling thing for me to see it.
[40:37] How to see yourself and how to think
[40:41] about yourself. And that is why let's
[40:44] see if we get it here.
[40:49] This Bible is just too
[40:54] big. Well, I'll go back to this one
[40:57] here. So, he said here now, for I say
[41:00] unto you, through the grace given unto
[41:02] me to every man that is among
[41:05] you. Not to think of himself more highly
[41:09] than he ought to think.
[41:13] That's it. That's how you see yourself
[41:14] now, right?
[41:15] This have nothing with nobody. This this
[41:18] have nothing with with Lucifer, right?
[41:21] The devil not in the picture here. This
[41:24] is you seeing you. This is you feeling
[41:28] about you. This is you thinking what you
[41:30] supposed to have or what what what
[41:32] you're supposed to where you're supposed
[41:34] to be. So this addresses all those
[41:36] people that feel entitled
[41:39] and feel is their right to this and
[41:41] they're right to that. Right.
[41:44] But to think soberly
[41:47] according to as God has dealt to every
[41:51] man the measure of faith.
[41:54] And now
[41:56] watch I didn't have the get the quote
[41:59] for it. Just just couldn't get my hand
[42:01] on it. But Bam but Ram says you cannot
[42:03] know somebody else position.
[42:06] You can only know yours.
[42:08] So it don't make sense wasting time
[42:10] minding people business.
[42:12] find try to press on to find what God
[42:14] called you to do and then do it with all
[42:17] your might. Amen. Could we continue?
[42:20] Ephesians 4:7 says this. But unto every
[42:24] one of us is given grace according to
[42:28] the measure of the gift of Christ. That
[42:31] mean each one of us have a measure.
[42:34] Amen. Or is aortioned a measure or given
[42:38] a measure or divided a measure. each one
[42:41] and God give you grace with that
[42:43] measure. Hallelujah. That mean everyone
[42:46] don't have the same measure.
[42:49] So when a man think himself highly of
[42:53] himself higher than the measure that God
[42:55] give him, that's a little problematic
[42:58] to that man
[43:00] because that will cloud somebody's view
[43:03] of others
[43:05] by virtue of how they see themselves.
[43:07] Are you with me?
[43:09] So unto every one of us is given grace
[43:10] according to the measure of the gift of
[43:12] Christ. Wherefore he saith when he
[43:13] ascended up on high he let captivity
[43:16] captive and give gifts unto men. Now he
[43:19] gives some apostles a gift. Some
[43:22] prophets gift evangelist gift. Pastors
[43:25] and teachers gifts. What for? The
[43:27] perfection of the saints. Work of the
[43:29] ministry. Edify fan of the body of
[43:31] Christ. Till we all come unity to faith,
[43:33] knowledge of the son of God, perfect man
[43:35] unto the measure of the statue of the
[43:39] fullness of Christ. So it come right
[43:41] back to this statue of a perfect man is
[43:43] not statue. Everybody has to say measure
[43:45] is a measure that will be released to
[43:48] you. Isn't that right? Purpose. purpose
[43:52] that we henceforth be no more children
[43:54] tossed to and fro carried about with
[43:55] every wind of doctrine by the slay of
[43:58] men and conrafter whereby the lie away
[44:00] to deceive but speaking the truth in
[44:03] love may grow up into him in all things
[44:05] which is the head even Christ from whom
[44:08] the whole body fitly joined together and
[44:10] compacted by that which every joint
[44:12] supplied according to the effectual
[44:14] working in the measure of every part
[44:16] making increase of the body unto the
[44:19] find of itself in
[44:22] Wow.
[44:24] Hallelujah.
[44:26] Now watch the sequence of how Paul
[44:29] unfold this word in Romans 12. He speak
[44:32] to them as an individual. Present your
[44:34] bodies living sacrifice between you and
[44:37] God. Amen. All right. Then he says don't
[44:41] be conformed to this world but transform
[44:44] how? By renewing of the mind, a new
[44:47] mindset, a new attitude. Change your
[44:50] attitude, change your mindset and you
[44:53] see something different altogether
[44:55] because you are trapped within you and
[44:58] your thinking within you and your
[45:00] thoughts.
[45:03] Now this transformation is important to
[45:06] see because he went deeper in verse
[45:09] three that every man that is among you
[45:12] not to think of himself more highly or
[45:14] to think but to think soberly according
[45:18] as God has dealt to him the measure of
[45:20] faith. Praise the Lord. Let me just
[45:23] see the mix.
[45:26] All right.
[45:30] All right. I think I have to get that.
[45:34] Praise the Lord. Do you love him?
[45:37] Then serve him.
[45:39] Serve him with all your heart. Praise
[45:42] the Lord. All right. So, I'll show you
[45:44] where I got that title from. Don't get
[45:48] scared. All
[45:50] right. The
[45:52] Amplified speaks of this. Do not conform
[45:56] to this
[45:57] world, but be transformed, changed by
[46:00] the entire renewal of your mind, by its
[46:04] new ideals and new attitude. Now, verse
[46:07] three is where I want to anchor this
[46:08] tonight. For by grace, unmmerited favor
[46:11] of God given to me, I warn everyone
[46:15] among you not to estimate and think of
[46:19] himself more highly than he ought. In
[46:24] other words, not to have an exaggerated
[46:26] opinion of his own importance,
[46:31] but to rate his ability with sober
[46:36] judgment, each according to the degree
[46:40] of faith aortioned by God to him. And
[46:44] that is why I get this the degree of
[46:46] faith aortioned by God. Amen. So this is
[46:50] so great to see this. I'll show you
[46:54] why. Because right after
[46:58] that, Paul begin to speak of for as we
[47:02] have many members of one body. Amen. So
[47:05] in other words, if you don't have the
[47:08] correct pictures, you can't see the body
[47:10] correctly.
[47:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you get that
[47:14] tonight?
[47:15] To go to this verse here, verse four, To
[47:19] see the body of Christ, you have to be
[47:21] able to see yourself correctly.
[47:25] Because when you see yourself more
[47:27] important than others, higher than
[47:28] others, uh to be uh uh thrown over
[47:31] others, when you see that like that, you
[47:33] can't see the others, right?
[47:37] Because you could see yourself as a
[47:38] head, but you might be a to.
[47:43] Do you understand that? So Paul now
[47:46] going into the panoramic of the vision
[47:49] of the body of Christ. He's no longer on
[47:52] the ground talking to individuals. He
[47:54] zooms out and he's looking down on the
[47:57] entire body to bring the body of Christ
[47:59] as a picture. Hallelujah. To the people
[48:02] who's listening
[48:04] he said for we have many members in one
[48:06] body just like our body and all members
[48:10] have not the same
[48:11] office. Amen. So we being many one body
[48:16] in Christ and every members and one
[48:19] members are one of another. Amen. In
[48:22] other words, we are members of the same
[48:23] body.
[48:27] What if the pastor see this? They will
[48:28] stop the crap and try to say that they
[48:30] higher and who are more spiritual and
[48:32] who you know all that is foolishness and
[48:33] go outside and they peding that to the
[48:35] people and the people deceive believing
[48:37] that nonsense and that make them bright
[48:39] because of a super mind by the pullpit.
[48:44] So Paul is presenting a picture. For we
[48:48] being many as one body in Christ and
[48:50] everyone members one of another having
[48:53] then gifts. Here we go. Differing
[48:58] according to the grace that is given to
[49:00] us or the grace aortioned to you. So you
[49:03] can look and see what this one have.
[49:05] Look and see what is have and find this
[49:06] one have and jealous have and find you
[49:09] should have that too. Hallelujah.
[49:12] The revelation being that everybody have
[49:14] grace. Everybody have a measure.
[49:17] Everybody give them a portion. Everybody
[49:19] given a gift.
[49:22] Hallelujah.
[49:24] Hallelujah.
[49:26] Amen. Having gifts different according
[49:28] to the grace that is given to us.
[49:30] Whether prophecy, let us prophesying
[49:33] according to the proportion of faith.
[49:35] Hallelujah. Or ministry. Let us wait on
[49:38] our ministry. Amen. He that teacheth on
[49:40] teaching, exaltth in exhortation. He
[49:43] that giveth, let him do with simplicity
[49:45] all of his gifts to give.
[49:49] He that ruleth with diligence, not be a
[49:52] slack ruler.
[49:54] It's telling you how to live. Rule with
[49:57] diligence. He that showeth mercy with
[50:00] cheerfulness.
[50:02] Let love be without dissimilation.
[50:04] Abhore that which is evil. Cleave to
[50:06] that which is good. Be kindly affection
[50:08] one to another with brotherly love. In
[50:11] honor preferring one another
[50:15] prefer who he
[50:17] she not at all. I first second and
[50:21] third.
[50:22] Do you understand what going on? Men
[50:24] shall be lovers of their own self.
[50:26] That's why we say the bride will be
[50:28] governed by the senses. Five senses. Not
[50:32] the bride. The church will be governed
[50:33] by by five senses. But the bride
[50:35] governed by faith. Amen. Amen. Could we
[50:38] say amen somebody?
[50:40] Hallelujah. Second Timothy, that's the
[50:43] church members head highminded and so
[50:45] on. All
[50:46] right. Be and he said no honor be not
[50:50] thoughtful in business but fervent in
[50:52] spirit serving the Lord. All right. Let
[50:53] me just continue
[50:55] now. All right. Let's go.
[51:01] But I'm talking about working in a small
[51:04] measure here. You talk about United
[51:06] Nations, the nation united together,
[51:08] united in time and they always done it.
[51:10] The UN is nothing but a rubber balloon
[51:12] that carried about every nation wind of
[51:14] doctrine. It will bust and blow up at
[51:16] anything. It can't. Neither can the
[51:18] congress of churches work. It's an
[51:20] organization by man contrary to the
[51:23] system with their system contrary to the
[51:25] word of God. It can't work. The
[51:27] assemblies of God and and the
[51:28] Pentecostal kingdom, full gospel people,
[51:30] how can they forfeit the evangelical
[51:32] teaching? He said, there you have it.
[51:34] the hour that we have arrived at and
[51:36] that's a big machine that is set up and
[51:39] they got the mechanics. Come on United
[51:41] Nations now the only thing they have is
[51:44] Satan in there with the dynamics. Now if
[51:48] he said they had the mechanics but Satan
[51:50] is the dynamics to them. What about the
[51:52] bride?
[51:54] We have the mechanics and Lov the
[51:58] capstone the Holy Spirit itself Christ
[52:01] will be our dynamics. Amen. Amen.
[52:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[52:08] Even the image of the beast have to come
[52:09] to life.
[52:11] So spirit coming to life is the image on
[52:14] of the beast versus the image of God.
[52:17] The image of beast in the world system
[52:18] and the image of God in a bride. Are you
[52:21] convinced of this? Do you believe what
[52:23] the brother says? Satan is their
[52:26] dynamics.
[52:28] So he's bringing spirit life to the
[52:30] mechanics that they have and the Holy
[52:32] Ghost the token the spirit itself
[52:34] bringing life.
[52:38] Hallelujah. I hope they bring these
[52:40] seats to life. That's the five ministry.
[52:44] Oh glory to God. Hallelujah. So what
[52:46] they got in mechanics? The only thing
[52:48] they have is Satan in there with the
[52:50] dynamics to force the marking of the
[52:53] beast. And when she is forced down, then
[52:55] the dynamics is working. The mechanics
[52:58] is there. They already got them. Let me
[53:00] say something too. This is united time
[53:03] to see the church is uniting. Nation
[53:05] uniting. It's uniting time of God and
[53:07] his bride. I say this with reverence and
[53:09] respect. I believe the bride of Christ
[53:11] is called. I believe she's sealed into
[53:13] the kingdom of God. I believe the
[53:15] mechanics is there. They are waiting for
[53:18] the dynamics that will take her off the
[53:20] earth in the rapture. And I believe it
[53:23] with all my heart. We don't know how
[53:26] he's going to do it, but he is going to
[53:28] do it. He is the dynamics.
[53:33] They have Satan. We have Christ. Okay.
[53:36] The Lord has shout in the house. He is
[53:39] the dynamics. We just become here we go.
[53:42] Members of the machine of his body.
[53:48] That's the only way it could work. Not
[53:50] become a church member.
[53:53] member of the body. And to become a
[53:55] member of the body is by one spirit. We
[53:58] are baptized into that body. You can't
[54:02] join that body. And in this fellowship,
[54:04] in this church, this body, my pastor and
[54:06] I pastor, what I have to do with the
[54:07] body of Christ that have nothing to do
[54:08] with the body of Christ. That's an
[54:10] invisible body. That's a universal body.
[54:13] That's a bride out there. Every nation,
[54:15] out there, every tongue, he have his
[54:17] people. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[54:20] Hallelujah.
[54:22] So no man can say this is a bride and
[54:23] this is another bride. That's
[54:24] foolishness. That's just man talking
[54:25] human trinadian mouth. Hallelujah.
[54:31] Jesus.
[54:34] So they are waiting for the dynamics
[54:36] that will take her off the earth into
[54:38] glory in the rapture. I believe it with
[54:40] all my heart. He is the dynamics. We
[54:43] just become members of the machine of
[54:44] his body. What? forming ourselves into
[54:47] his image as we see him uniting himself
[54:51] with us in his works with his love gifts
[54:54] as he hands them to us before the
[54:56] wedding supper and we are waiting and
[54:59] watching for that for what love gifts as
[55:03] he hand them to us we have gifts
[55:07] coming we have tongues interpretation of
[55:10] tongues we have gifts of healing coming
[55:12] on gifts of prophecy coming gift of
[55:14] discernment coming Come on, write with
[55:16] me. Every gift going be back in the
[55:17] church. Not just no fight for ministry.
[55:20] It every gift back in the church.
[55:23] Another Ephesians back on the earth. Oh,
[55:25] give the Lord some praises.
[55:28] [Music]
[55:29] Hallelujah.
[55:31] Are you ready? He said the dynamics of
[55:33] this church will be a refilling of the
[55:36] Holy Spirit. How you get refilling? You
[55:38] ain't get filled yet. A refilling is a
[55:40] refilling. It mean they get filled
[55:41] before you say I want a another one.
[55:44] Isn't that right? Not only Acts 2, but
[55:46] Acts 42 and they prayed after getting
[55:48] licked. They prayed after getting
[55:50] beaten.
[55:54] Oh God, stretch forth your hand that we
[55:56] could go forth and they will reveal
[55:58] fresh baptism. Fresh fire. Oh, how the
[56:02] church need that tonight. Oh, we need
[56:04] that tonight. Fresh fire. Fresh baptism.
[56:08] The dynamics of this church will be a
[56:10] refill of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[56:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here we go. That
[56:16] we have worked in a small measure while
[56:20] the headstone is coming down to unite
[56:23] with the body. When he and the head body
[56:26] unites together, the full power of the
[56:28] Holy Ghost, that's what they waiting
[56:30] for. Full power. Not partial power, not
[56:33] temporary power, not small power, but
[56:36] full power. This Bible have full power.
[56:39] Not no two, not Hallelujah. Not a no two
[56:43] piston engine. Oh, give the Lord a
[56:45] shout. That's your lawn mower and
[56:47] different things. We talking about full
[56:48] power. Full power to lead the earth. Oh,
[56:51] glory. Blasting power. Smoke in the
[56:54] devil face power. Oh, glory to God.
[56:56] Signs and wonders. Power to shake this
[56:59] world once more. This world will not be
[57:01] shook by books and tapes. Come on, give
[57:03] the Lord a shout. This work, this world
[57:06] will not be shook by 4-hour explanation
[57:08] service or mystery service. The world
[57:10] will be shook when the power of God
[57:12] strike the church and there'll be a
[57:14] living faith. A living God, living
[57:19] manifestation. Oh, you mean we don't
[57:20] need a manifestation? Liar. Shut them
[57:22] out. We need a manifestation. There will
[57:25] be no manifestation of God to stir the
[57:27] bride. He will send it. He promises. It
[57:31] will take those seven thunders to wake
[57:33] the bride up again. Oh, give the Lord a
[57:35] shout. The devil can't take that out the
[57:38] book. The devil can't take allow the
[57:40] tape. It will take a manifestation of
[57:42] what?
[57:44] Manifestation of God to steal the bride.
[57:48] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[57:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[57:53] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to God.
[57:56] Then he said the dynamic is the Holy
[57:58] Spirit. That why the devil don't want to
[58:00] go near it. That's why the people fear
[58:02] it. But it's good enough for me. It's
[58:04] the old time Holy Spirit and the devil
[58:07] won't go near it. That's the reason
[58:09] people fear it. But it's good enough for
[58:11] me. Give me that old time religion. Give
[58:14] me that old time religion. What kind?
[58:16] The same one on Pentecost. The same fire
[58:19] fell on Pentecost. The same fire.
[58:22] Hallelujah.
[58:24] Give me a microphone.
[58:30] Thank you Jesus.
[58:33] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[58:36] Thank you Jesus. So the dynamics of this
[58:38] church will be a refilling of the Holy
[58:40] Ghost that will work in a small measure.
[58:43] No pastor could cancel that. No pastor
[58:45] could explain that away. They can't rip
[58:47] that out and say no dynamic. That means
[58:49] what? You talking many pullpit. You
[58:51] explaining mysteries. Hallelujah. Yeah.
[58:53] The mysteries better bring power. I
[58:55] know. That's why he said, "Is this the
[58:56] mystery of the thunders that will bring
[58:58] a power back into the church?" Says,
[59:00] "What time is it? Will we leap and jump
[59:02] over walls or we just sit down and
[59:05] scratch?" When that power come, you have
[59:07] to run like Joel army. You know,
[59:08] hallelujah. To fight and we shall not
[59:10] trust one another. You know, nobody
[59:12] jumping one another. You know when an
[59:14] anointed come. Oh, praise the name of
[59:15] the Lord. Everybody in position is a
[59:17] mighty army marching. The devil going to
[59:20] shake when that army had to move. That
[59:22] is Joel. My joy already saw the army.
[59:25] Oh, give the Lord a shout. That army is
[59:26] in the word. That army was prophesied in
[59:28] the last days. Oh, give the Lord a
[59:30] shout. Thy seed shall possess the gates
[59:32] of the enemy. We are royalties of
[59:34] Abraham. We coming to possess. We coming
[59:37] to inherit. We coming to manifest. We
[59:40] come to claim and to vindicate.
[59:42] Vindicate Malachi 4. Vindicate Corin a
[59:45] prophet. They don't believe in Branam.
[59:47] They call him a false prophet. But we
[59:49] will be the vindication that our prophet
[59:51] has already come. Give the Lord a shout.
[59:53] It last already come because we are the
[59:55] children whose hearts have been turned
[59:57] literally back to the faith of the
[59:59] fathers and be doing what the fathers
[1:00:01] did. Give the Lord a shout. The fathers
[1:00:03] said, "Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk."
[1:00:05] They walk the talk. Okay. The Lord a
[1:00:07] shout, "Silver and gold have I none, but
[1:00:09] such as I have I give it unto thee."
[1:00:10] That was the faith of the fathers. And
[1:00:12] the faith of the fathers are living
[1:00:14] still. The faith of the fathers is in
[1:00:16] Trinidad. It's around the world. It is
[1:00:19] here tonight. This faith is what is
[1:00:21] preaching to you. Oh, glory. Faith is
[1:00:23] what is teaching you. It's the faith of
[1:00:25] the fathers. That faith is the original
[1:00:27] faith. It's what Abraham had. It's what
[1:00:30] Noah had. That faith is God said so.
[1:00:33] Okay. The Lord a shout. We don't care
[1:00:35] what man dream and what man think and
[1:00:37] what angels some man meet. We don't care
[1:00:40] about that. We want to know what God
[1:00:41] said. Okay. The Lord a shout. And if God
[1:00:44] said you're going to get a revival,
[1:00:46] you're going to get a revival. If God
[1:00:48] said you're going to be healed, you're
[1:00:49] going to be healed. If God said you
[1:00:51] going to be delivered, you will be
[1:00:52] delivered. Oh, praise. That's your
[1:00:54] original faith. God said so. Oh,
[1:00:58] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That
[1:01:01] original faith was prayed back in
[1:01:02] Genesis.
[1:01:04] Be seated.
[1:01:05] 1 Corinthians 12. Verse 4. Hallelujah.
[1:01:11] Hallelujah.
[1:01:12] I couldn't wait for tonight. Praise God.
[1:01:15] Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:01:19] 1 Corinthians 12:4 says, "Now there are
[1:01:22] diversity of gifts but the same spirit."
[1:01:25] Amen.
[1:01:27] There are different administration but
[1:01:29] the same Lord. There are diversity of
[1:01:32] operation but is the same God which work
[1:01:35] it all in all. Does the people in the
[1:01:37] message know that?
[1:01:39] How they get sitting on the throne and
[1:01:41] judge this and judge this and judge this
[1:01:42] all this all this off and they had to be
[1:01:43] careful you know because they on the
[1:01:45] verge of blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[1:01:48] that's right it's a shame that the
[1:01:52] message have become so disrespectful God
[1:01:54] will judge them people God will judge
[1:01:57] some and take them off the chessboard
[1:01:58] take them off the earth and God will
[1:02:01] leave some to judge that others will
[1:02:03] see I repeat God will take some
[1:02:07] completely off the chessboard God right
[1:02:10] and God will leave some that others may
[1:02:13] see when they are judged.
[1:02:16] There are differences of administration
[1:02:18] but the same lord. There are diversities
[1:02:20] of operation but the same god which
[1:02:22] workketh in all but the manifestation of
[1:02:24] the spirit is given to every man to
[1:02:26] profit with tong to one here we go is
[1:02:30] given the spirit the word of wisdom. So
[1:02:32] when Joshua come, remember what it was
[1:02:35] about, right? Cross over, fight, and
[1:02:39] divide the land. It's just three things.
[1:02:41] Not 24 things. It's a 100 things. It's
[1:02:43] just three things. You can't fight if
[1:02:45] you cross over. It's not like you're
[1:02:47] bowing arrow, you're pelting from a
[1:02:49] distance and you're pelting. You can't
[1:02:50] fight like that. The people on the other
[1:02:52] side, they have Jordan River. You had to
[1:02:54] cross to go and deal with them. So the
[1:02:57] first thing where they get over is
[1:02:58] Jordan River. How do we cross? Well,
[1:03:01] Joshua solved that. God solved that. Let
[1:03:02] the men walk and Jordan open up. So,
[1:03:05] they cross over now. Next thing is
[1:03:07] fight. Hallelujah. You kind of divide
[1:03:10] and and and been fighting and you get
[1:03:12] land and then you lost the land and you
[1:03:14] lost your life and what you had to fight
[1:03:15] and beat them and then you could conquer
[1:03:18] the land and then you could divide the
[1:03:19] land. So here how it's dividing up here.
[1:03:22] to to one is given the spirit the word
[1:03:25] of wisdom to another the word of
[1:03:28] knowledge by the same spirit to another
[1:03:30] faith by the same spirit to another the
[1:03:33] gifts of healing by the same spirit to
[1:03:35] another the working of miracles
[1:03:39] give the Lord a shout this is the word
[1:03:41] this is for us you know this Pentecostal
[1:03:44] stuff you know this is the word you know
[1:03:47] to another the working of miracles to
[1:03:49] another prophecy to another discerning
[1:03:52] of spirits to another diverse kind of
[1:03:54] tongues to another the interpretation of
[1:03:56] tongues. Give the Lord some praises.
[1:03:59] Every gift have to come back in the
[1:04:01] church. Let me prophesy tonight. Every
[1:04:04] single gift is necessary and needed back
[1:04:07] in this last day church. Not a devil
[1:04:09] move until we say so. Or can the Lord a
[1:04:12] shout in the house?
[1:04:17] Let's continue. Paul and all these
[1:04:19] workketh that one and the selfsame
[1:04:23] spirit dividing to every man severally
[1:04:26] as he will. As who will? As he will. The
[1:04:31] Holy Ghost doing the dividing. The Holy
[1:04:33] Ghost doing the aortioning. When he
[1:04:35] aortion you this and aortion you that.
[1:04:37] And he doesn't have to ask anybody
[1:04:39] permission as to what to give you. Come
[1:04:41] on now. You ain't hear me tonight. You
[1:04:43] didn't hear me tonight. He don't have to
[1:04:44] ask anybody permission how to bless you.
[1:04:47] Oh, glory to God. That is why David
[1:04:49] said, "My cup, run it over." He didn't
[1:04:52] say, "Make bless you." He said, "My cup,
[1:04:54] run it over." Oh, give the Lord a shout
[1:04:56] is much more than I could handle. It's
[1:04:58] much more than I could receive. It start
[1:05:00] to drip off now. Oh, glory to God. And
[1:05:03] when your cup begin to run over, it must
[1:05:05] hit somebody. Somebody must get a
[1:05:07] blessing. Some family, some friends,
[1:05:09] somebody, some neighbor. Praise. Give
[1:05:11] the Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:05:13] Hallelujah. Verse 12. And as the body is
[1:05:16] one, here we go. And had many members
[1:05:19] and all the members of that one body
[1:05:21] being many are one body. So is Christ.
[1:05:24] And then the bomb come. For by one
[1:05:26] spirit we are baptized into one body.
[1:05:30] Not by one book. Not by one tape. Not by
[1:05:33] believing some message. No. By one
[1:05:35] spirit. Whether you believe the message
[1:05:37] or not. By one spirit. You can't take
[1:05:40] that out the Bible. by one spirit. Just
[1:05:42] as they take in water baptism and dip
[1:05:44] you down, God has to take you and dip
[1:05:46] you into the spirit. And when you get
[1:05:47] back up, oh glory, you get drunk like a
[1:05:49] like on the day of Pentecost. Get the
[1:05:51] Lord a shout in the house by one spirit.
[1:05:54] You baptize just as they get dipped in
[1:05:56] water. You have to dip in the spirit.
[1:05:58] Have you been dipped into the spirit?
[1:06:00] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:06:02] I'm making it plain for you. You have to
[1:06:04] get a dip in the spirit. Not your ankle.
[1:06:06] Hallelujah. Not your hands getting wet.
[1:06:09] Glory to God. There's no Catholic
[1:06:11] church, not no sprinkler in your head,
[1:06:13] but you have to get a dip by one spirit.
[1:06:17] You have to get baptized, but the Holy
[1:06:19] Ghost and fire. That's what John said.
[1:06:22] There is one standing among you. He
[1:06:24] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:28] and with fire. That Holy Ghost is alive
[1:06:30] tonight. That Holy Ghost is real
[1:06:32] tonight. He want to seal you. He want to
[1:06:35] baptize
[1:06:37] you.
[1:06:40] [Applause]
[1:06:41] Here we go. For by one spirit are we all
[1:06:45] baptized into one body. Whether we be
[1:06:48] Jews or Gentiles, whether be bond or
[1:06:51] free, we have all been made to drink. I
[1:06:55] like that. Drink of that one spirit. We
[1:06:59] have to drink it. You have to drink it.
[1:07:01] And when you drink it is go down in your
[1:07:03] belly. Oh, give the Lord a shout. He
[1:07:06] that believeth on me, as the scripture
[1:07:08] had said, I'm having myself a time
[1:07:09] tonight. Out of his belly, I shall flow
[1:07:12] rivers of living water. They got to
[1:07:14] drink that spirit. You're going to be
[1:07:15] baptized in that spirit. You're going to
[1:07:17] be drunk with that spirit. Oh, we feel
[1:07:19] him here tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:07:24] Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:07:28] Hallelujah.
[1:07:31] Hear this. For the body is not one
[1:07:35] member but many. See, I love God. I love
[1:07:40] how he does things. These comedians is
[1:07:42] not really comedians. No, these anointed
[1:07:45] ones out there, these characters out
[1:07:46] there standing by the pulpit trying to
[1:07:48] be God Almighty
[1:07:51] himself. These filthy guys, watch.
[1:07:56] If they see the picture
[1:07:59] correctly, they cannot see themselves as
[1:08:01] the only pebble on the beach.
[1:08:04] Like something I saw on the internet,
[1:08:06] you show the earth. When you zoom, you
[1:08:09] see Mercury and when you zoom that small
[1:08:11] thing, you know, we we in a galaxy, you
[1:08:14] know. So when you think you big and
[1:08:15] think when you zoom out are bigger than
[1:08:17] you, you know.
[1:08:20] So you thinking you're the only pebble
[1:08:21] on the beach because in your mind high
[1:08:24] and lift it up
[1:08:27] and you only find out that you are one
[1:08:29] of
[1:08:31] the member of the body.
[1:08:33] Think about it. Think about this little
[1:08:34] finger feeling led to leave the body. I
[1:08:37] can't take this little finger no more.
[1:08:39] You know where you going.
[1:08:43] Hallelujah. The I find he only seen in
[1:08:45] front. He want to see
[1:08:48] behind. The I want permission to go to
[1:08:51] the
[1:08:51] back. He fell up. See, I only see him
[1:08:54] one way. I only see him one way. I only
[1:08:55] see him one way. I can't stand no more.
[1:09:03] This this hand want to shake the
[1:09:05] brother. So this hand going back there.
[1:09:06] Somebody hand back. I see you brother.
[1:09:10] You put your hands. Put your hands that
[1:09:12] way. Hear what Paul says. For the body
[1:09:16] is not one member but many.
[1:09:19] If the foot shall say, because I am not
[1:09:23] the hand, I am not of the body. Is it
[1:09:25] therefore not of the body?
[1:09:28] If the air shall say, because I'm not
[1:09:29] the eye, I am not of the body. Is it
[1:09:31] therefore not of the body? If the whole
[1:09:33] body one eye, where were they hearing?
[1:09:35] Exactly. This is Paul teaching about
[1:09:39] this thing. the clarity of how the
[1:09:41] believers, how the church supposed to be
[1:09:44] seeing things in a healthy balanced
[1:09:47] manner.
[1:09:50] If the whole body were eye, where were
[1:09:52] they hearing? If the whole body were
[1:09:53] hearing, where were the smelling? But
[1:09:56] now had God set the members, every one
[1:10:00] of them in the body as it had pleased
[1:10:03] him. Amen. You see, when the brothers
[1:10:05] and the ministers and the pastors and
[1:10:06] so-called shepherds don't see this, they
[1:10:08] can see the a part of the body and nice
[1:10:10] bride. But God put it in a way that you
[1:10:13] can't do without me and I can't do
[1:10:15] without you. Let's live,
[1:10:18] let's talk, let's fellowship because you
[1:10:22] ain't going nowhere with that stupid
[1:10:23] attitude cuz that's not scriptural. Give
[1:10:25] the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:10:28] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:31] Amen. If all the member were one, where
[1:10:34] if all were one member, then where was
[1:10:36] the body? Now are there many members,
[1:10:39] but yet one body? And the eye, he's
[1:10:42] drilling down deeper. Can it say unto
[1:10:45] the hand, I have no need of thee.
[1:10:51] Nor again the head to the feet, I have
[1:10:53] no need of you. Nay, much more those
[1:10:56] members of the body which seem to be
[1:10:58] more feeble
[1:11:00] are necessary.
[1:11:02] Could we see that, brethren, and expand
[1:11:05] our minds to value the penny and the
[1:11:07] silver dollar?
[1:11:11] Because Abraham was a silver dollar and
[1:11:12] Lot was a penny, but God used pennies.
[1:11:14] Sometimes it provide change. Let's let's
[1:11:16] let's continue.
[1:11:24] The one that seem more feeble and
[1:11:26] necessary, and those members of the body
[1:11:28] which we think to be less honorable,
[1:11:30] upon these we bestow more abundant
[1:11:32] honor, and our uncommonly parts have
[1:11:34] more abundant comedliness. For our
[1:11:36] comely parts have no need, but God had,
[1:11:39] here we go, hear the word used, tempered
[1:11:41] the body together, having given more
[1:11:44] abundant honor to that part which he
[1:11:46] lacked. So that is why God didn't put
[1:11:49] the fif ministry in one man. If a man
[1:11:52] claimed to have the fif ministry, that
[1:11:53] man is a definitely anointed liar.
[1:11:56] You hear it from this pulpit here. You
[1:11:59] didn't hear it privately.
[1:12:01] Yeah. You know how whispering preaching
[1:12:03] or
[1:12:04] whisper. I I don't do that. Whatever I
[1:12:07] say, I say with conviction. I say from
[1:12:09] my heart. I say from by the word pit
[1:12:11] here. No whispering stuff. Amen. If a
[1:12:14] man say he has the fivefold ministry, so
[1:12:16] you don't need the other brethren. He is
[1:12:18] going to perfect these saints that he
[1:12:20] has. That is really his saints. That is
[1:12:23] not God's saints. Because listen, second
[1:12:26] Timothy have the the pastors and know
[1:12:28] that's Matthew 24 false anointed ones.
[1:12:30] But second Timothy, second Timothy uh
[1:12:33] second Peter 1:47 that have a five for
[1:12:35] ministry because that is the bride.
[1:12:39] Faith and virtual, that's the bride. All
[1:12:41] right. Amen. So watch God tempered the
[1:12:44] body together having more abundant honor
[1:12:46] to that part with lack. Here the reason
[1:12:49] that there should be no schism in the
[1:12:51] body but that members should have here
[1:12:54] we go the same care one for another.
[1:13:00] I don't see nobody getting vexed with
[1:13:01] their foot or the toe and taking a
[1:13:03] hammer vex with you and you're beating
[1:13:05] your toe. Hallelujah.
[1:13:08] You put your hammer, you put your finger
[1:13:10] there, say you see this, you touch that
[1:13:12] there and you start to bust licks on
[1:13:15] that thumb
[1:13:17] there. That what men be doing just
[1:13:20] beating up the body that's not the body
[1:13:23] have a fivefold in the body and five
[1:13:25] outside the body them could claim
[1:13:26] whatever they want to claim. But the
[1:13:28] body of Christ is tempered. That's why
[1:13:31] we have to come to the measure of the
[1:13:33] stature of the fullness of Christ. Isn't
[1:13:37] that right? Now he said for we are the
[1:13:39] body of Christ and members in
[1:13:40] particular. And now hear this deep here.
[1:13:42] I have to talk about but no schism
[1:13:44] membership have the same care one for
[1:13:45] another. So that is evidence of growth
[1:13:47] and maturity where you there are some
[1:13:49] people only care about yourself. You
[1:13:51] know you know you know the word behind
[1:13:53] that selfishness.
[1:13:56] That not the body that is not the
[1:13:58] vision. That's not the kingdom. that
[1:14:00] they the the piece of beef that the
[1:14:02] senses that the flesh that is part of
[1:14:04] the manifestation of fleshliness
[1:14:07] selfishness this growth and maturity
[1:14:09] shows this here now watch that there
[1:14:11] should be no skin in the body that all
[1:14:13] that the members should have the same
[1:14:14] care one for another why because that's
[1:14:16] a fellow member of the body I care for
[1:14:19] him because he's part of this whole
[1:14:21] thing now ye are the body now watch the
[1:14:25] part almost missed this one and whether
[1:14:29] One member suffer, all the members
[1:14:33] suffer with it.
[1:14:38] Charity suffered long and it's kind.
[1:14:43] Hallelujah. Rejoiceth not in iniquity.
[1:14:46] You you hear what happened to him. There
[1:14:49] some people that that where the tongue
[1:14:50] is at. They want to see in the pit. They
[1:14:53] want to see on the ground. They want to
[1:14:54] see a graveling. They want to see a deer
[1:14:56] to to to show that they on top.
[1:14:59] Hallelujah.
[1:15:03] When one member suffer, all member
[1:15:06] suffer me. I I ain't know about them.
[1:15:08] No, it just say that. But here the other
[1:15:11] part. When one member be honored,
[1:15:15] all the members rejoice with it. Now,
[1:15:18] this is a problem. This is a problem for
[1:15:20] the jealous and the envious, the
[1:15:22] malicious and the wicked.
[1:15:24] Yes. Am I too hard tonight?
[1:15:28] Are we warming up?
[1:15:34] This part is very important. When God
[1:15:36] bless you, see who rejoicing with you.
[1:15:39] There some people the face was smiling
[1:15:41] only time when they see the bless the
[1:15:42] face just turn that that that that smile
[1:15:45] just going up. That's that's you wipe
[1:15:47] the smile off your face with that
[1:15:48] blessing. You got you know what
[1:15:50] happening? Something inside their heart.
[1:15:52] They vex. They upset. Oh, they can't
[1:15:55] handle it. Oh, glory to God. And God,
[1:15:59] God easy. You know, God, we are doing.
[1:16:02] He said, David, he prepared a table for
[1:16:04] me in in the presence of my enemy. God,
[1:16:06] they're doing it privately. You know,
[1:16:08] God making sure the enemy eyes big and
[1:16:09] open. They sleeping. They sleeping on,
[1:16:11] you know, they watching and God putting
[1:16:13] the table and putting the mat and
[1:16:15] putting the tablecloth and putting the
[1:16:17] napkin, put in the fork, put in the food
[1:16:20] and you could sit down there and angels
[1:16:22] watching. He prepare a table for me in
[1:16:24] the presence of my enemies. Oh, surely
[1:16:26] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[1:16:29] the days of my life. Oh God, you could
[1:16:31] watch but you can't touch. Oh, give the
[1:16:33] Lord a shout in the house. You could
[1:16:35] watch but you can't touch.
[1:16:37] [Music]
[1:16:42] If you follow God and obey God, the
[1:16:44] devil is not a problem.
[1:16:48] Let me say it again. Good. If you're
[1:16:50] following in God's way, in his word, the
[1:16:53] devil is not a problem. Because this
[1:16:55] word meet the devil anywhere, anytime,
[1:16:57] on a place, under any condition, God
[1:16:59] will bless you. He telling he said, "If
[1:17:01] I'll bless you when you're going out,
[1:17:02] I'll bless you when you're coming in.
[1:17:03] I'll bless you when you pray. I'll bless
[1:17:05] you here. I'll bless your water. I'll
[1:17:07] bless your FL. But if you disobey,
[1:17:10] I will let your enemy do this. Enemy do
[1:17:12] that. Enemy do that." So if you're
[1:17:14] watching the enemy attacking your house,
[1:17:16] home life, marriage, and mine, what are
[1:17:18] you doing?
[1:17:20] how you living. Why don't you repent
[1:17:22] tonight and get all your foolishness and
[1:17:24] let the blessing of God follow you?
[1:17:30] And find God's favor. David found favor.
[1:17:33] Joseph found favor. These guys, let's
[1:17:36] find favor. You have a
[1:17:37] way. Blessed is the man that walketh not
[1:17:40] in the counsel of them godly. Nor stand
[1:17:42] in the way of sinners. Nor sit in the
[1:17:44] seat of the scornful, but his delight is
[1:17:46] in the law of the Lord and thought he
[1:17:47] meditate. Day and night he shall be like
[1:17:51] a tree planted. Not a surface tree. Not
[1:17:55] somebody dropped your No, no, no. He
[1:17:57] shall be planted by water. Oh, glory.
[1:18:01] Whatever you do, shall Come on, shout
[1:18:04] out, whatever you do shall prosper. We
[1:18:09] have a promise of prosperity in
[1:18:11] following God's plan and program. I'm
[1:18:13] not talking about Pentecostal prosperity
[1:18:15] foolishness. I'm not talking about that.
[1:18:17] I'm talking about the blessings of
[1:18:18] Abraham, the blessings of Joseph. That
[1:18:21] means he will add to you. Oh, give the
[1:18:23] Lord a shout in the house. Come on now.
[1:18:27] Give the Lord some praises.
[1:18:32] When one member rejoice, when one man is
[1:18:35] honored, all the member rejoice with it.
[1:18:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Come and rejoice
[1:18:39] with us. Hallelujah. We have found the
[1:18:41] coin that was lost. Hallelujah.
[1:18:43] Hallelujah. Now you are the body of
[1:18:45] Christ members in particular and God has
[1:18:47] set some in the church. First apostles,
[1:18:49] second there are the prophets, third be
[1:18:51] teachers, after that miracles, then
[1:18:53] gifts of healing, helps, government,
[1:18:55] diversity of tongues, all of that. It
[1:18:57] never said a pastor or a shepherd. He
[1:19:02] said God said this in the church.
[1:19:03] Apostles and prophets and teachers and
[1:19:05] miracles, gifts of healings, helps
[1:19:09] governments, diversity of tongues. Then
[1:19:11] Paul went on deeper. Are all apostles?
[1:19:14] Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are
[1:19:17] all miracle workers? The answer is no.
[1:19:21] Have all the gifts of healing? The
[1:19:23] answer is no. Do all speak with tongues?
[1:19:26] Do all interpret? And he said, but
[1:19:28] coveret earnestly the best gift. I'll
[1:19:30] show you a more excellent way. And then
[1:19:32] he went on to 13 to say h about charity.
[1:19:36] Do I speak with the tongues of men and
[1:19:37] angels? Though I know the mysteries of
[1:19:39] the seals, the vials, the plagues, the
[1:19:41] woes, and the pope that's coming.
[1:19:43] Hallelujah. And have not charity, I'm
[1:19:46] wasting my time. Glory to God. Though I
[1:19:49] preached for 60 years with every
[1:19:51] knowledge pumping out and I have not
[1:19:54] charity. Oh God. Waste of time. And then
[1:19:58] to describe the kind of behavior charity
[1:20:00] have. Charity have a behavior. Charity
[1:20:02] is not for the other side. Charity is
[1:20:04] for this side. A man is a liar if he
[1:20:07] cannot demonstrate the love of God to
[1:20:09] his own people. Come on, give the Lord a
[1:20:11] shout. Charity is to be manifested here.
[1:20:13] It is kind. It seeketh not own. Is not
[1:20:16] easily provoked. It believeth all
[1:20:18] things. It hope all things. It endureth
[1:20:21] all things. Come on. Give the Lord a
[1:20:23] shout in the house.
[1:20:25] Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:20:28] Hallelujah.
[1:20:30] So we have to get a dip in this charity
[1:20:32] to manifest it on this side. If we dead
[1:20:35] and gone on that other side is perfect.
[1:20:37] But this side we need that. When that
[1:20:40] love came over the br to deal with the
[1:20:41] killer bull, he said I wish it happened
[1:20:43] all the time. He says something came
[1:20:45] over me. Not something had to come upon
[1:20:47] the bride. Oh glory to God. Give the
[1:20:49] Lord some praises. So listen
[1:20:53] listen. If we have not attained yet to
[1:20:55] charity, what do we have to boast about?
[1:20:59] We we are nothing.
[1:21:04] like for Instagram like what's the
[1:21:06] what's the point? My truth bigger than
[1:21:08] yours. I'm more revolution than you. I
[1:21:10] higher I have a better jacket. My jacket
[1:21:12] is gray. Your jacket is
[1:21:14] white. Is that jacket
[1:21:16] competition? You see the foolishness is
[1:21:19] kind of but said it take perfect love to
[1:21:22] enter there. He a say long in the
[1:21:25] message.
[1:21:27] He say the
[1:21:28] Bible it take perfect love.
[1:21:32] Amen. Amen. Amen. Now bear in mind when
[1:21:36] that which is perfect is come, God shows
[1:21:39] that which is in part. We had part for
[1:21:42] seven ages. When God sent William
[1:21:45] Brandham wasn't to bring part, he was to
[1:21:48] bring that which is perfect. Because
[1:21:50] when he connect the pipes that was
[1:21:52] broken up through seven ages, now the
[1:21:54] current of the Holy Ghost flowing
[1:21:56] through the seven pipes. Hallelujah.
[1:21:59] Because the word was catrice of natures
[1:22:01] by the nominational praise God spirits
[1:22:05] and once the devil break up this thing
[1:22:06] the spirit can't move trapped by
[1:22:09] circumstance
[1:22:11] the nonoperation of the spirit because
[1:22:14] the word was conquered or the word was
[1:22:16] was was was crushed but what brother
[1:22:18] Brandham did he say seven angels come
[1:22:20] from eternity to gather the scattered
[1:22:23] word to tie back into the word it's like
[1:22:25] some joints they start to tie back so
[1:22:27] they start to tie back
[1:22:28] And when they tie back the horn can
[1:22:30] flow. So when he come back to adoption
[1:22:32] for us he said you have to say there is
[1:22:34] my spirit flowing freely. That means a
[1:22:38] dead man be in the pullpit. He has no
[1:22:40] ambition. He has no Hallelujah. He's a
[1:22:42] real unock then he not not sping his own
[1:22:44] seeds his own revelations playing
[1:22:47] prophet and whatn not playing God.
[1:22:50] We'll get it. You know all them who
[1:22:52] playing this God who who play the Holy
[1:22:54] Spirit. You will see how Jesus play this
[1:22:56] this this thing.
[1:22:59] Brother,
[1:23:01] when a church is groaning
[1:23:05] under the persecution of the outside
[1:23:08] world, believing on the Lord Jesus that
[1:23:11] the promise of the Holy Ghost. It's just
[1:23:13] as real, just as real to us as it was to
[1:23:17] Pentecost. How they grown and cry on
[1:23:20] labor pains. But when they are born one,
[1:23:23] two, and positionally born. Hallelujah.
[1:23:26] Then the Holy Ghost has set in the
[1:23:28] church. Apostles, prophets, teachers,
[1:23:33] praise God, pastors, evangelists, then
[1:23:36] he gives into speaking in tongues,
[1:23:39] interpreting of tongues, knowledge,
[1:23:41] wisdom, gifts of healing, all kind of
[1:23:44] miracles. That is the whole package.
[1:23:47] Hallelujah.
[1:23:48] That is the whole dinner with dessert.
[1:23:51] That's the whole package for the
[1:23:52] ministry and for the people. Oh, give
[1:23:54] the Lord some praises. We're going to
[1:23:56] have a perfect church inside of here.
[1:23:58] That is what is promised in the last
[1:23:59] days. A church with Jesus walking in it.
[1:24:02] The shout of the king in the camp. Glory
[1:24:04] to God. Hallelujah.
[1:24:07] Let's continue. Could you take a little
[1:24:08] more? All right.
[1:24:12] I've noticed that I kind of teach I
[1:24:13] teach on Sunday teaching again today.
[1:24:16] But Abraham says this is my purpose of
[1:24:17] he said this is my purpose of doing
[1:24:19] this. The church is always trying to
[1:24:21] take somebody else's
[1:24:23] corner but don't do that. You can never
[1:24:27] raise corn in Ephraim's corner if you
[1:24:29] are manet. You've got to take your place
[1:24:32] in Christ positionally or it's get deep
[1:24:35] and rich. We have been taught many times
[1:24:38] we all have to speak with tongues.
[1:24:39] That's wrong. We all got to do it. No we
[1:24:41] don't. They all didn't come to do one
[1:24:43] thing. Now you are first born into the
[1:24:46] kingdom by the Holy Ghost. Then next you
[1:24:49] are predestinated unto what? Adoption.
[1:24:52] What is that? You are predestinated into
[1:24:55] the placing. Yes sir. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:25:00] Hallelujah. Man said can't take his
[1:25:03] land. I have a I I can't have a healing
[1:25:05] service when half you say I go out there
[1:25:07] to preach a baptism in Jesus name and
[1:25:08] the trinity and brethren say oh he is
[1:25:10] old Jesus only. I can't go over here
[1:25:12] with divine healing. Half of them say
[1:25:14] divine healing is all right. And a lot
[1:25:16] of them enjoy miracles of the Lord and
[1:25:17] say, "Well, I believe but Abraham is a
[1:25:18] prophet." But let me tell you something.
[1:25:20] As long as his spirit is on him, he's
[1:25:21] discerning. He's the Lord's servant. But
[1:25:23] his teaching is rotten. It is no good.
[1:25:25] Who ever heard such Tommy rod is either
[1:25:27] of God is not of God. How you going to
[1:25:29] act? Here we go. Man won't keep his
[1:25:32] ground. Ephraim won't keep his ground.
[1:25:35] Why? Why? Because they watching what man
[1:25:37] doing. Ephraim watching what this one
[1:25:40] doing. Amen. Take that to the individual
[1:25:41] in church now. This one watching this
[1:25:43] one doing I supposed to be there. I
[1:25:46] should have that. They thinking yourself
[1:25:48] a certain way. And God hates that
[1:25:51] because he cannot positionally place you
[1:25:53] when your mind messed up. You have to
[1:25:55] get a renewal of your mind. You have to
[1:25:57] get clear glasses. The devil give you
[1:25:59] some bluish thing. Every you seen
[1:26:00] everything
[1:26:01] blue. You need some green glasses or
[1:26:04] pink glasses. Everything pink and you
[1:26:05] seeing clearly, you know, you see it
[1:26:07] pink. You have a colored view because of
[1:26:10] how you think. And the Bible said, "Let
[1:26:13] each man don't have a exaggerated view
[1:26:15] of himself."
[1:26:18] That's what I'm message. You know what's
[1:26:19] behind that? A fiveletter word. You know
[1:26:21] what it is? Pride.
[1:26:24] That word that really is
[1:26:26] if brothers only humble yourself,
[1:26:28] they'll recognize that they need others.
[1:26:32] And they'll begin to respect others. If
[1:26:34] I complain about every minister, he
[1:26:35] this, he this, he this. I have no trust
[1:26:36] in no. And one brother every time I talk
[1:26:39] to him you talk about this minister
[1:26:40] negative negative negative. I said my
[1:26:42] goodness when you get some positive
[1:26:44] stuff. We born in sin shape. You think
[1:26:47] we born on a righteous. We born from the
[1:26:49] Virgin Mary. Virgin Mary is the mother.
[1:26:52] We born in sin shape iniquity.
[1:26:55] We come in the world speaking lies. God
[1:26:57] by his blood and grace save us.
[1:27:02] We not in a position to judge others
[1:27:04] like Moses sitting on Moses seat. We we
[1:27:06] are not God.
[1:27:10] Jesus did better than those disciples.
[1:27:13] Shall we call on fire like Elijah did?
[1:27:16] Call on fire. They're feeling powerful.
[1:27:17] I feel anointing God. Jesus said all you
[1:27:20] know. Do you know what spiritual just
[1:27:23] leave them feel alone? He say all you do
[1:27:25] know what spirit of just the anointing
[1:27:28] making you act a certain way. All right.
[1:27:30] Let me see if I close up here.
[1:27:32] Brother man said won't keep his ground.
[1:27:35] Ephraim won't keep his ground. God won't
[1:27:36] keep his ground. Benjamin won't keep his
[1:27:38] ground. They're all running out here
[1:27:40] with the Philistines all mixed up. How
[1:27:43] are we going to get placed? But we have
[1:27:45] been born by the Holy Ghost. All right.
[1:27:47] We are born to predestinated. Then after
[1:27:50] being born, we are predestinated under
[1:27:52] adoption to be placed in the body of
[1:27:54] Christ. You see what I mean? What is the
[1:27:56] body of Christ? Some are apostles, some
[1:27:58] are prophets, some are teachers, some
[1:28:00] are evangelists, some are pastors,
[1:28:02] others are gifts of tongues,
[1:28:03] interpretation of tongues, wisdom,
[1:28:04] knowledge, miracle. You see how he place
[1:28:06] all of that? He placed all of that in
[1:28:08] the body, including tongues,
[1:28:10] interpretations and miracles along with
[1:28:12] pastors and teachers, evangelists. All
[1:28:14] of that is part of the body. Hallelujah.
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:20] Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:28:25] We are born in the spirit of God.
[1:28:28] Receive the Holy Ghost and cry aba
[1:28:29] father. Hallelujah. We are children but
[1:28:31] we can't get nowhere. We can't whip the
[1:28:35] Philistines. I want to read this part
[1:28:37] here. He said look at Billy Graham the
[1:28:40] Muhammad and said prove it. This some
[1:28:43] Muslim guy. Look at Jack Co standing
[1:28:45] yonder and that atheist that church of
[1:28:47] Christ shaking hands with the 80s out
[1:28:48] there supposed to be a Christian shaking
[1:28:50] hands with a devil like Joe Lewis a
[1:28:51] freethinker even cuss God and said there
[1:28:53] was no such thing as God and shaking
[1:28:55] hands with him taking sides against
[1:28:57] brother Jaku how are you going to do
[1:28:59] anything on the Pentecostal many of them
[1:29:01] against him when every preacher in our
[1:29:04] land ought to stood toeto toe with him
[1:29:06] and said God sending your power there we
[1:29:09] are we can't be placed so if you revival
[1:29:13] divert you revival them having revival
[1:29:16] really really
[1:29:20] talk about you know somebody having
[1:29:21] something the others wouldn't support it
[1:29:23] cuz not they not not not not them
[1:29:25] producing it all of that so I see this
[1:29:29] way if somebody get a breakthrough
[1:29:30] that's a breakthrough for the kingdom
[1:29:33] I want people to get a breakthrough I
[1:29:36] want the pastor and minister get a
[1:29:37] breakthrough when a pastor minister or
[1:29:39] apostle whoever get a breakthrough they
[1:29:41] get a breakthrough not for themselves
[1:29:43] That's a man getting a breakthrough that
[1:29:45] could do more for the kingdom of God.
[1:29:48] If he see it, you know, God bless us and
[1:29:51] he see for himself and his church and
[1:29:52] what not. He he he has a problem that
[1:29:55] that have a limit that have a time
[1:29:56] limit. All right. Ephraim don't want to
[1:29:59] stay. One of them go over here. We find
[1:30:01] mana say over here. Oh, the Lord give me
[1:30:03] a good corn field. And God say, wait a
[1:30:06] minute. I'm supposed to raise oats, but
[1:30:07] I'm going to get corn, too. Hallelujah.
[1:30:11] He said, "You ain't got nothing to do
[1:30:13] with corn. Get oats. Oats is your part
[1:30:16] to raise. You ain't supposed to hurt
[1:30:18] sheep when you're supposed to hurt
[1:30:20] cattle." God wants to place the church.
[1:30:23] But every one of them wants to do the
[1:30:24] same thing. So which man could place the
[1:30:26] church? Bangali.
[1:30:29] Glory. When you're with me, you're the
[1:30:31] five. When you're not with me, you're no
[1:30:32] longer 54. That a man placing others.
[1:30:35] You know what I'm saying? Now watch
[1:30:36] this. Now you watch. All right. You
[1:30:39] ain't supposed to hurt sheep and you're
[1:30:40] supposed to hurt her cattle. God wants
[1:30:41] to place the church. Every one of them
[1:30:43] wants to do the same thing, but you
[1:30:44] can't tell them a thing about it. No,
[1:30:45] they still got that goaty nature. But
[1:30:47] but but but but you can't tell them. You
[1:30:50] can't place the church. Here we go. And
[1:30:52] this is the part. You know, the church
[1:30:54] is supposed to be predestinated unto
[1:30:56] adoption of children. Yes, sir. Yeah.
[1:30:58] Where God can take a man and adopt him
[1:31:01] into the family and give him something.
[1:31:04] So adoption have something that goes
[1:31:05] with it. A man can't have no dry
[1:31:07] adoption.
[1:31:09] You say adopted and you have not get but
[1:31:12] you you had the Bible long time.
[1:31:13] Somebody get the Bible long time. You
[1:31:15] say go get the Bible. God has to give
[1:31:17] you something. That identify I have
[1:31:21] approved this man.
[1:31:24] So God can take a man adopt him into the
[1:31:26] family give him
[1:31:27] something. We just have to say yes is
[1:31:30] the Lord is Lord. No he didn't say that.
[1:31:32] Try it.
[1:31:34] See if it is right. bring you adoption.
[1:31:37] Come with you and your angel. Come with
[1:31:39] them. Both of all you come. Oh, give the
[1:31:41] Lord some praises. Do you understand
[1:31:42] that? This is what this is what we train
[1:31:44] to do now. A man claims something, bring
[1:31:46] it or angel talk to you. You meet an
[1:31:48] angel along the road and come bring you
[1:31:50] and angel and come. Let's talk about it.
[1:31:54] Try it. But they don't want to try it.
[1:31:57] The way you accept that. No, we supposed
[1:31:59] to try what you claim.
[1:32:02] We supposed to try what you claim. You
[1:32:03] make a claim. We supposed to try that.
[1:32:05] Not because you say so you got a dream.
[1:32:07] No, I don't want to hear about dream. I
[1:32:08] want to try it.
[1:32:11] Watch. The Bible said try it. See if it
[1:32:14] is right. If it is right, move right
[1:32:17] with it. Then say what? Lord, send us
[1:32:20] something else. Keep moving until every
[1:32:23] fellow take his place. Then you're going
[1:32:24] to see the church of God begin to get in
[1:32:26] his place. Then is when the Philistines
[1:32:29] will go to backing up. The shorts will
[1:32:31] go off. Here will go down. Faces will be
[1:32:34] washed. Sigers will be missing. And when
[1:32:35] the church gets into this mighty power,
[1:32:37] when they will have a nast and safara, a
[1:32:39] few of them, you will see when that holy
[1:32:43] church stands together in its power,
[1:32:45] positionally placed as sons of God,
[1:32:47] adopted into the family of God, a
[1:32:49] powerful church standing in his glory.
[1:32:51] That's what he's coming back for. Oh,
[1:32:53] glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:32:56] Adam bride couldn't wait. That's what
[1:32:59] Adam found. That's what Christ found.
[1:33:01] Couldn't wait. That's what the matter
[1:33:02] with the people today. They can't wait
[1:33:05] for the real Holy Spirit to take the
[1:33:08] church in position. Do you get that now?
[1:33:11] Do you understand that tonight? Do you
[1:33:13] understand that? And and I want people
[1:33:15] who going to be hearing it to listen
[1:33:16] again.
[1:33:18] The reason we have all these false
[1:33:20] manifestation, false claims, false
[1:33:22] revelation because they wouldn't wait
[1:33:24] for the real Holy Spirit to take the
[1:33:26] church in position because they have a
[1:33:28] time for that. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:33:30] shout. How be it we speak wisdom to them
[1:33:33] that are perfect or them that are
[1:33:35] mature. Why would God speak wisdom to
[1:33:37] immature people to babies and so on? It
[1:33:40] has to be mature people. It has to be
[1:33:42] people come to rightness. Had to people
[1:33:44] come to brotherly kindness, forgiveness.
[1:33:49] Where you can identify you are right for
[1:33:51] the age you're living in. Watch this
[1:33:53] here now. They can't wait for the real
[1:33:55] Holy Spirit to take the church in
[1:33:57] position. They got to manufacture
[1:33:58] something initial evidence tongues to
[1:34:00] get more members in the church. Watch
[1:34:02] all these kind of tummy rot instead of
[1:34:04] waiting upon the Lord for the real
[1:34:07] manifestation of the resurrection of
[1:34:09] Christ making himself known among the
[1:34:11] people. She can't wait. He said when
[1:34:13] that time come then the seven thunders
[1:34:15] being manifested then him moving in and
[1:34:17] out among us then we are worshiping the
[1:34:20] living Christ. It have no man inside of
[1:34:22] there. It have no pastor, apostle,
[1:34:24] prophet, teacher, evangelist inside
[1:34:25] there at all. him moving in and out.
[1:34:27] Then we worshiping the living Christ.
[1:34:29] Oh, glory to God. Then he talk about
[1:34:31] king lamb worship. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:34:33] shout. Praising, blessing, and honor and
[1:34:35] glory. Oh, glory to God. This is the
[1:34:37] word. Now, you could read back what I'm
[1:34:39] saying back in the message. Hallelujah.
[1:34:42] Praise God. Praise God. He says a phony.
[1:34:45] If it wasn't, this world would be a
[1:34:46] flame. Watch. Okay. Today, they try to
[1:34:48] manufacture something. Glory to God. She
[1:34:50] got worked up trying to manufacture
[1:34:51] something. He says it's a phony. If it
[1:34:53] it wasn't this world would be a flame
[1:34:55] with the power of God. The church would
[1:34:57] be on fire. The dead will be raised. All
[1:34:59] kind of things taking place. If that
[1:35:00] talk about the real thing then no
[1:35:02] explanation where you need to know the
[1:35:04] mysteries and as a pastor you need to
[1:35:05] sit down and learn some more mysteries
[1:35:07] and mysteries. Sit
[1:35:09] down teach me. So why why I need the
[1:35:13] Holy Ghost
[1:35:14] for you see that the pope come in and
[1:35:17] the message
[1:35:18] popes they really want that father job
[1:35:20] bad. Brother
[1:35:22] George. No, I'm not father Leo who who
[1:35:25] get mapped
[1:35:27] up. They really want to be father father
[1:35:30] over people. So watch this thing now. He
[1:35:33] said if was the real thing you the world
[1:35:36] would be a flame with the power of God.
[1:35:37] The church would be on fire. The dead
[1:35:40] would be raised. All kind of thing would
[1:35:41] be taking place. But what did they show?
[1:35:43] Before Christ could get to her, before
[1:35:44] he got her to plant his own seed, she
[1:35:47] have wheat seeds. The nominal national
[1:35:48] seeds. That's the reason she's reaping a
[1:35:50] harvest right now. So the noman seed
[1:35:53] spirits have taken on the message. So
[1:35:54] that why they have the camp now. If if
[1:35:56] is Baptist Methodist all over again in
[1:36:00] the message just their public baptist
[1:36:03] but they when they believe they receive
[1:36:05] receive is Baptist doctrine again. You
[1:36:07] know what I mean? Just the message
[1:36:08] quoted and the Baptist message is
[1:36:10] Pentecost that that would have now.
[1:36:13] Hallelujah.
[1:36:14] Here we go. From Christ of God reveal.
[1:36:17] Let me stretch you. His body will do the
[1:36:19] works that he promised like in Mark 16
[1:36:21] and so forth. His body not the church.
[1:36:25] His body will do the works that he
[1:36:27] promised in Mark 6. Watch here this
[1:36:30] part. This is good. His body was not
[1:36:32] held in the grave but was recognized
[1:36:33] with him in the resurrection. Then the
[1:36:35] body of his believing children will not
[1:36:37] be held in the grave when he comes but
[1:36:39] will be recognized with him because he
[1:36:41] died for the purpose to resurrect his
[1:36:43] bride. body recognized because it is his
[1:36:47] body. Because it is the word. It is so
[1:36:50] completely yielded from denomination
[1:36:52] things to him. He is the word. Here we
[1:36:55] go. And it is recognized with him
[1:36:57] because now we have the first fruit of
[1:36:59] our resurrection by and know we have
[1:37:01] passed from death until life and by his
[1:37:03] personal headship that he's the same
[1:37:05] yesterday, then forever by doing the
[1:37:07] same things through Christ that he did
[1:37:08] in. Amen.
[1:37:11] So the works that Christ did when the
[1:37:12] bride begins to do is evidence of the
[1:37:15] personal headship.
[1:37:17] Glory to God. Hear the bomb. The life in
[1:37:21] the body is a vindication of the rapture
[1:37:25] is at hand.
[1:37:27] Oh, glory to God. Oh, that enough to
[1:37:29] make your re that make a dead saint come
[1:37:32] alive. The life in the body is a
[1:37:35] vindication of the rapture is at hand.
[1:37:37] When you see the head hip and the body
[1:37:41] becoming one
[1:37:44] and the fullness here we go of the
[1:37:47] measure of his manifestation
[1:37:51] shows that the body is about to ready
[1:37:53] receive the headship they can't get away
[1:37:55] from it it's not when he come and
[1:37:57] recognize how much books we have how
[1:37:58] much books we know how much we talk how
[1:38:00] much we quote have nothing to do with
[1:38:01] that it has to come into our
[1:38:02] manifestation he's talking about the
[1:38:04] fullness of the measure of his
[1:38:06] manifestation shows that the body is
[1:38:08] ready to received the headship. Oh, he
[1:38:10] is bringing life to the body in a
[1:38:12] vindication of the rapture. Oh, glory to
[1:38:15] God. Hear that? He's bringing life to
[1:38:17] the body as a vindication of the
[1:38:18] rapture. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:38:21] Hallelujah. I'm going to close. My God.
[1:38:24] Hallelujah. Praise God. Acts 3:13 6 3:16
[1:38:28] when Peter asks how the mighty miracle
[1:38:31] had been taking place upon the
[1:38:32] one. Jesus said he experienced and this
[1:38:34] wise his Jesus name through faith in his
[1:38:37] name had made this man former
[1:38:40] strong the faith which is by from him
[1:38:43] Jesus had given him the man his perfect
[1:38:46] soundness in the presence of all Jesus
[1:38:49] name Jesus faith brought the miracle
[1:38:53] Peter did not claim it was his own human
[1:38:55] faith any more than he claimed he was
[1:38:57] his own name he said that Jesus name
[1:39:00] used in faith which is from Jesus
[1:39:03] performed a great work. This faith in
[1:39:06] what the Lord was speaking about in
[1:39:08] Revelation 2:13, it was his faith. It
[1:39:11] was not in him. It was his own faith
[1:39:13] that he had given to the believers. The
[1:39:16] faith of Jesus Christ. So Peter didn't
[1:39:19] claim to be God. He claimed is his faith
[1:39:21] in Jesus. Isn't that right? So Romans
[1:39:24] 12:3 said, "According as he had dealt to
[1:39:26] every man, brethren, the measure of
[1:39:28] faith, and by grace you are saved."
[1:39:31] Isn't that right? is a gift of God. My
[1:39:33] brethren, notice our Lord Jesus with
[1:39:35] respect of persons. In the Pergaman age,
[1:39:37] they were humanizing salvation, having
[1:39:40] turned from the truth, the door of their
[1:39:42] fellowship. Watch. In an age of rapid
[1:39:45] degradation, there were still a few that
[1:39:47] had a measure of that faith of our Lord
[1:39:50] Jesus Christ. Not only used that faith
[1:39:52] in acts of power, but withtood those who
[1:39:55] dare to say that they were saved simply
[1:39:57] on the grounds of joining church.
[1:39:58] Musician, come on, please. Hallelujah.
[1:40:02] They knew that no man could truly
[1:40:03] believe unto eternal life and the
[1:40:05] righteousness of God apart from the
[1:40:07] measure of faith of the Lord Jesus
[1:40:08] Christ. And today's church, here we go,
[1:40:11] is filled with mental believers.
[1:40:14] Who said that? But she said that. No, I
[1:40:17] didn't say that. But Ram said that.
[1:40:18] Today's church is filled with mental
[1:40:21] believers who endorsed the virgin birth,
[1:40:23] the shed blood, going to church, taking
[1:40:25] communion, and are not reborn at all.
[1:40:27] Amen. Even so in that third age was the
[1:40:29] same problem. Human faith wasn't enough
[1:40:31] then. It is not enough now. It take the
[1:40:34] very faith of the son of God to drop
[1:40:36] into the man's heart so he can receive
[1:40:38] the Lord of glory into the temple not
[1:40:40] made with hands. This was a living
[1:40:42] faith. I live by the faith of the son of
[1:40:45] God. Paul did not say he lived by faith
[1:40:48] in the son of God. It was the faith of
[1:40:50] the son of God that has given him life
[1:40:52] and kept him in Christian victory. Oh,
[1:40:55] give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:40:58] Hallelujah. I said all of that to come
[1:41:00] to this. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham.
[1:41:04] We've got theologians. We've got doctors
[1:41:06] of divinity. We have got great men all
[1:41:08] over the world, smart, intelligent,
[1:41:09] educated. But it takes the simplicity of
[1:41:12] believing God to make his word speak out
[1:41:15] to show that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:41:17] yesterday, day and forever. It takes a
[1:41:19] humble heart dedicated to God to bring
[1:41:22] Jesus Christ into present tense.
[1:41:25] Wonderful.
[1:41:27] And I'm closing here with this scripture
[1:41:29] from Philippians chapter 2 verse 3-10.
[1:41:33] This caps off the whole thing. Paul
[1:41:35] speaks, "Let nothing be done to strife
[1:41:38] of vain glory, but in loneliness of
[1:41:41] mind, let each esteem the other better
[1:41:44] than themselves. Look not every man on
[1:41:46] his own things, but every man also in
[1:41:48] the things of others. Let this mind be
[1:41:50] you which is also in Christ Jesus. Who
[1:41:52] being in the form of God, taught not
[1:41:54] robbery to be equal with God, made
[1:41:56] himself no reputation, took upon him the
[1:41:58] form of a servant, made in the likeness
[1:42:00] of men, and being found in fashion as a
[1:42:02] man, he humbled himself and became
[1:42:04] obedient to death, even the debt of the
[1:42:07] cross. That's in the amplified. And this
[1:42:09] is where we could close. Do nothing from
[1:42:12] factional motives, through contentious
[1:42:14] strife and selfishness or for unworthy
[1:42:16] ends or prompted by conceit and empty
[1:42:18] arrogance. Instead, in the true spirit
[1:42:21] of humility, this is it here. Now,
[1:42:24] loneliness of mind, you can't really be
[1:42:27] humble if you don't have a loneliness of
[1:42:29] mind. Let each regard the others as
[1:42:32] better than and superior to himself. as
[1:42:36] big thinking more highly of one another
[1:42:40] than you could do yourself. That's an
[1:42:41] exercise you know. That's a hard thing
[1:42:44] that you could actually think somebody
[1:42:45] more superior than you. Because you see
[1:42:48] when you think you hard on somebody, you
[1:42:50] belittle them, you mock them, you tell
[1:42:52] jokes on them, you laugh at them because
[1:42:55] you seen them down there.
[1:42:58] Let each of you esteem and look upon and
[1:43:02] be concerned not merely his own interest
[1:43:05] but also the interest of others. And
[1:43:07] this is a bomb. Let this same attitude
[1:43:10] and purpose and humble mind be in you
[1:43:13] which was in Christ Jesus. Let him be
[1:43:17] your example in humility who here we go.
[1:43:21] Although being essentially one with God
[1:43:24] and in the form of God, possessing the
[1:43:27] fullness of the attributes which make
[1:43:28] God God, did not think this equality
[1:43:31] with God was a thing to be eagerly
[1:43:33] grasped or retained but stripped
[1:43:35] himself.
[1:43:38] Jesus never s I am God. I am the Holy
[1:43:40] Ghost. I am it. Look me here. He never
[1:43:44] talk like that. He never boast. He never
[1:43:46] bring them things out. Yes sir.
[1:43:49] He stripped himself of all privileges as
[1:43:51] to assume the guise of a servant, a
[1:43:54] slave. In that he became like men and
[1:43:58] was born a human being. After he had
[1:44:00] appeared a human form, he abased himself
[1:44:02] and humbled himself still further and
[1:44:05] carried his obedience to the extreme of
[1:44:07] death, even the death of the cross. And
[1:44:09] he stooped so low. God has highly
[1:44:11] exalted him and has freely bestowed upon
[1:44:13] him a name that is above every other
[1:44:15] name that at the name of Jesus Christ
[1:44:17] every knee shall bow on heaven and earth
[1:44:20] and under the earth. May God bless his
[1:44:22] word with let's all stand and praise
[1:44:23] God. Father God we thank you tonight. I
[1:44:25] pray your blessing poured upon your
[1:44:26] people inspire them father that Lord the
[1:44:30] measure you appropriated to them. May
[1:44:32] they see and catch it by revelation that
[1:44:34] they need to think differently a new
[1:44:36] attitude a renewed mind a loneliness of
[1:44:39] mind. And granted, Father, I commit them
[1:44:41] hands into your hands. Bless the
[1:44:43] upcoming services coming Sunday, special
[1:44:45] youth service. May they invite some
[1:44:46] young person out that they could hear
[1:44:48] this special word from the Lord.
[1:44:49] Granted, God in Jesus name we ask it.
[1:44:51] Amen. God bless you. Thanks again for
[1:44:53] coming. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:45:05] Oh, let's all praise him tonight. Glory
[1:45:08] to God. Give him praise. Lift your hands
[1:45:10] and worship him with all your heart. Oh,

[1:48:42] heart. Oh, can we give the Lord a hand
[1:48:45] of praise
[1:48:46] tonight? Praise God. How many appreciate
