walking in that provided way we are here this morning Lord reaching up Lord knowing that you are reaching down of waiting to make a connection with your sons and daughters of who true spiritual amnesia have forgotten who they are but we come here this morning to be reminded that we are sons and daughters of the Living God we come this morning to be reminded that we are kings and priests of offering holy sacrifice up just like the share of hymns singing holy holy holy holy are you Lord caught on my team Lord you are holy in this place up you are mighty in this place up Lord we lift up a

we commit a service into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen amen you love the Lord this morning let's just sing one song before read the scriptures take

Allah Oh help me you may rise in me her capstone our love so take me in to the Holy of Holies yes long Jamie and pile of blood to the holy holy all the time.she the call I'd say cleanse my hear me to the holy holy Jamie in my table Oh [Music] take me to the hole please of hole take the coal so take the cold pens my lips here oh honey take the cold cleanse my lips [Music] god bless you this morning and welcome to service this morning you have your Bibles thank you but Anthony thank you musicians would you turn with me to one portion of scripture reading Isaiah six reading from verse one to eight inclusive Isaiah 6 and verse one and Isaiah 6 verse one in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above its to the seraphim's each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one cried and saw another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts o a whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that crying and the house was filled with smoke then said I was me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim's unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lord this had touched our lips and then iniquity is taken away and I sin purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here I am send me me the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord and it's certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the Lord this morning to take time away from what's not important to spend time doing what is most important because we appreciate as sons and daughters of God that we are here temporarily temporarily to prove to the devil that even this is Satan's Eden that this bride will not be deceived will not be like even in the midst of the sin in the midst of the evil in the myths of the adultery and fornication and spiritual wickedness in high places that God is pulling out a bride out of Satan's Eden God is pulling out a people for his name's sake and he is more than able to do it he has done it before and he can do it again in every age and every dispensation and every season God has always had a witness he has always had somebody who he could send forth whether reluctantly or willingly he has had somebody and he could send forth when was here Moses was somewhat reluctant he said I can talk I can speak but but he still went fought because he was sent for a purpose Gideon had his own complexes but God will always have a witness so rather willing or unwilling whether reluctant or push like Jonah he had a ministry and he ran away from it he was the unwilling prophet but if God has called you for something whether you are willing or unwilling whether you are prepared or unprepared whether you feel like it or don't he like it when God puts his hand upon you there is nothing that you could do about it up because he calls based on his foreknowledge and his foreknowledge allows him to see what you cannot see his foreknowledge allows him to understand what you don't yet understand because his ability is to see your future his ability to see your past your present his ability is to know what you dreamt last night that you can't even remember because he knows everything about you he is concerned about the animals he is concerned about who's in government he is concerned about where you work he is concerned about where you live he is concerned about what you ate up he is concerned what happens tomorrow and he is able to factor every single thing into his plan and he is able to make all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose and the love took order you couldn't even put it in your heart because you could never understand love because he is love it takes a while to reach the kind of love that he had when you didn't even know him he still loves you when you had not met him he still loved you before you were born and you could even come to consciousness of who you were his love left glory and sent his son to die for you when you could not even appreciate it he died for you when you could not say thank you he died for you when you couldn't write your name up he died for you when you didn't even know yourself somebody say man hallelujah so don't let the suffering of this present time weigh you down for you to stay in spiritual amnesia it's one thing to have spiritual amnesia it's another thing to stay in spiritual amnesia we were born in spiritual amnesia we were born not knowing who we were we were poor not knowing who our Father is up we were born not knowing that we were royalty we were born not knowing how we were sons of the king we were born not knowing that royalty was flew into our veins up we were born could not appreciate who our heritage was and understand that even on Joshua and everyone who went before wish they could have been here we were born not understanding that up because we forgot where we were we forgot where we came from and the same way God had to remind a jobber where was our when I lay the foundation of the eternal morning stars sang together we are here this morning to be reminded of where we come from reminder of where we are going reminded of what's for us that's greater than what's against us that there's a power in you that your situation cannot stop there's a power in you that your past cannot stop there's a power in you that your mistakes cannot stop there's a power in you if your children cannot stop there's a power in you that your bank account cannot stop there's a power in you then your boss cannot stop there's a power in you that hypocrisy cannot stop there's a power in you that your sin cannot stop because the sin that you have in your members was already conquered by the mighty Conqueror and he said because I live not because you live but because I live you will live also you add the results of his life you are the results of his ministry you add a result of his victory you add a result of his overcoming and because he overcame you could overcome because he is victorious you could have the victory because Oh somebody help me this morning [Applause] hallelujah so don't look next to you don't look who's around you that's totally unimportant this morning don't look back what don't look forward don't look left or right I want you to look up look up because that's my Redemption coming from your redemption is not coming from the pulpit your redemption come from God God will move every prop around your life he will move everything you're leading on until you could only trust him he is not compromising his trust he's not compromising his love because this is bright time because it's bright time it means it's an understanding of his husband time also because bride and husband have to become one can the church same and everybody feeling fine so I promise you today I'll not be too long with you I have a sunday-school message this morning just to our hearts to remembrance and to make us conscious of not only the battle that we face but the gravity of the situation that we are in this morning and I believe it's a crossroads for us how many appreciate but over this morning and services for the last few services every service a masterpiece and I share with him what my thought was gonna be this morning so I want to take title this morning woe is me for I am undone reading from Isaiah 6 verse 5 and we understand that and we have heard it and I'll just talk for a bit that it is impossible for your walk with God to be one that's really genuine until you have an experience with God you can read about God you could know about God and until you have your own individual experience with God it's just here see it is just here see you are rejoicing perhaps on what somebody else went through and you hear what Peter went through and what Moses went through and how deep it had an experience and Moses has an experience and Joshua had an experience and brother Branham had an experience and the experience is over the years since the Prophet left and yes they are an encouragement to us but all of that until it becomes an experience with us and God it's just hearsay but a Branham said ladies say you cannot be worn by a painted fire so knowing what happened over the years is great information it has a great understanding and there are those who have specialized and gotten their PhDs and church history but church history without a personal experience with God is just that church history and our whole desire is to have an experience with God Moses had an understanding that that he was one of them are doubles and he made his limited attempt to bring some kind of relief and he ended up killing one man and ran away and he had basically given up on his ministry giving up on his objective given up on his burden because his human effort have filled but when he had an experience with God via meeting the burning bush there was a transformation that he could not undo and you cannot undo an experience with God you kind of reset an experience with God it will change you forever so if you find yourself struggling trying to make sense of what's going on in your life you need an experience and and if you have had one experience there is room for another experience and another experience and and this room to be filled and his room to be refilled and and and refill them and refill them and the room filled once more can with the present and the Spirit of God can the church Shaymin Moses had an experience Joshua had an ex fears before he could go and deal with Jericho yeah in his alone time he has nobody around him meditating wondering how to take it he is trying to figure it out because it's human nature to try to figure it out every time we wake up in the day we kind of figure out how to live how to make it how to make ends meet how to pay the bills it it's in our nature to figure stuff out how to get marriage to work how to save more money how to fix the car how to make it through the traffic how to buy food how to cook everything is about figuring it out and Josh Shaw was there trying to figure it out he didn't have an experience but all of a sudden the captain or the chief captain came by to give him an encounter with God of hosts and and just was any vigilance Olli will do through his sword and challenge one time because he wants to make sure that he's not being deceived he wants to make sure that nothing slips him so he asked the question are you for us or are you against us are you for our purpose are you follower plan because I want you to know we're about to take over Jericho if you don't know it I'm here meditating and how to keep these people to the land that was promised so are you for that or are you against that because if you are against the rapture and the resurrection and you are against perfection and adoption you are against the manifestation of the sons of God then we have means and ways to deal with it up but if you are trying to make it to Keenan's land and you are trying to overcome and separate yourselves from the world and you will be seated and the angel of the Lord is punished and the chief captain I'm the one with the pan I'm no one who already has the tape of what already took place so I'm coming to just rewind the tape for you so you could know how to approach it we already know what you need to do we already know how you need to approach it so you don't have to worry anymore because I've come to give you a set plan on how to overcome this situation that you are trying to figure out on your job I'm come to give you plans from the world on how to deal with this situation if you're trying to figure out in your family this mountain that's in front of you this wall that's in front of you this barrier that in front of you this Jericho in your life and the angel gave him what he needed to do and experience with God Gideon had an experience with God now mighty man of Valor he didn't believe it just like many people come to service this morning and no matter what we see or what we preach it is all on an intellectual level until Killian see well listen if you show me something get my same human experience give me something that I could rest my feet on coz he after some of the rest of it on that is between you and God alone nobody else has to know this is this is you and God and your confidence some of the you rest your feet on because if your feet is on the pasta and something happens in a pasta then your feet will feel if your feet is on your mother your father then if they are not there then your feet will feel that's why people backslide because their feet was on something that could not last but if your faith is on an experience a personal experience with God whether the pastor calls whatever it takes hallelujah hallelujah lets it be the name of the Lord with a Franciscan I get a little bit more in the monitors thank you Paul had an experience that was so powerful to him he actually kept it a secret for 14 years until the Corinthians dragged it out of him so personal so unbelievable that he never said anything about it it was an experience when he was caught up in heaven to the paradise of God where he heard divine secrets that was almost beyond the capability of man to utter and even when he started to express it he shared it as if he was somebody else he was talking about he said I know a man in Christ who 14 years ago was caught up in the third heaven and the way he was talking about it they could have thought that he was talking about somebody else it was only after a while they're realizing he was shared experience that he had what experience have you had and the church same and keep your motto salmon I'm not gonna be too long with you but we're going somewhere this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if you have your Bibles let's read it said this little sunday-school cry I'm gonna get to my tech shortly 2nd Corinthians 12 and verse 1 2nd Corinthians 12 verse 1 it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago whether in body I cannot tell or whether out of body I cannot tell God knoweth such and one caught up in the till heaven something happened to Paul and he's sharing it and I knew such a manner where in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter of such an one when I glorify yet of myself I will not glory but in my name limit ease but to our desire to glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth but now I forbear lest any man should think of me above that which you see at me so Paul was saying I've been keeping this thing to myself because I don't want no glory I don't want you to see me picking on that I am I don't want you to have no no forth understanding of my ministry and Paul goes on and on in this scripture so you read it as your homework but Paul an experience and it took him 14 years before he was willing to share it with the people that he was ministering to and these are the experiences that shape us these experiences these encounters is what makes us having a walk with God so different that you could weather the storm of time because you're not leading than anybody can the church same so can we talk about Isaiah a little bit this morning Isaiah the prophet said is one of the greatest prophecies in the Bible in the message in his presence there are 66 books of the Bible there are 66 chapters in Isaiah Isaiah starts off in Genesis the middle of Isaiah he brings in the New Testament at the end of Isaiah he brings in the Millennium Jess exactly Genesis the New Testament and Revelation perfect Isaiah was one of the major prophets those are the prophets wood and he is meditating in the courts of the Temple in Jerusalem trying to gain some perspective and what had just transpired the recent death of King Uzziah dangers and threats from foreign empires when all of a sudden he is caught up in his own experience and the Bible says in the year that King Uzziah died I also saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple what it is to see the Lord friends that's why we came here this morning not to see the preacher or to see one another but to see the Lord and if you ever get an encounter to see the Lord suddenly your world changes it will never be the same again but to understand the context of this build up the book of 2nd chronicles tells us that eyes that Uzziah was 16 years old when he took the throne and he would reign in Jerusalem for 52 years under his leadership the nation rose to incredible Heights of power military power financial power and as long as you say I saw the Lord the kingdom but the people had flourished the kingdom was strong but King Uzziah but about him said that he went above his estate he went above his station and and the King did something that the priest is supposed to do and he went into the temple and he offered incense and over 80 priests warned them King if you do that you'll be violating the way we operate and I want us to understand our history from the beginning of time God had ruled from the days of Moses onwards and and trod by the prophets it had never been caught planned to have a king over his people that was a manly King it was just before the dawn of the age of David at the the cheering of Israel had looked outside of themselves as is often the case looked at the kingdoms around them and said why don't we have a king like the Philistines do why don't we do things the way the world is doing it why are we why are we restricting ourselves to hearing from the prophets and Samuel who was the Prophet at the time felt so bad about it God had to comfort his prophet and since Samuel they have not rejected you they have rejected me it had been God's plan to give them a king but that thing was gonna be king Jesus that had been his plan to give him a king and his name is gonna be Jesus but the choice of the people they want a man they want a man they want a man to leave him and that's how we end up with King Saul and then we know all the king so by the time King Uzziah is there these kings and the prophets suppose we work in hand-in-hand for different roles different responsibilities what the King is supposed to do is not for the priests to do what the priests and the prophets supposed to do is not for the king to do God has an order the kingdom has our aura but Uzziah went outside of the order and because you were no saddlery order the Bible said leprosy came upon him but a Branham brought out that Isaiah you saline on you sire rely on his ayahs counsel rely on his ayahs advice because for the most part he was a great man the Prophet said he was a great man until he got too big for himself and once you get too big for yourself caught us a wheel off stripping you down and I want you to understand this is Isaiah the prophet these are prophet but gifts and callings are without repentance so this prophet as a call is Prophet as a gift but the gift and the call comes without repentance I see I didn't realize what was happening in his life as a prophet this is not a church member this is not somebody in Israel or Judah or tribe this is a prophet a major Prophet the Prophet would say yes later he would speak about a virgin shall conceive and yes this is not that time this is in the year that King Uzziah died Isaiah's trouble because his uncle as it were his support system as it were where he went for advice as it were weight when he feeling down you want to talk to somebody that person who according to his she was also family to him God had removed what he was leaning on God had removed that structure the force Isaiah to be alone just like Jacob had to be left alone just as Moses had to be left alone just as Paul had to be left alone just Esther to be left alone go through the Bible God is a core of the individual he doesn't look at the group he doesn't even look at your family he's a good of the individual and wants an individual relationship can the church hey man is this helping anybody this morning - sure to what extent God is about the individual in acts five with Ananias and Sapphira even though Ananias lied and died his wife wasn't judged because of him she was given the opportunity as an individual to represent her position to stand before the throne that was in Peters heart and she also lied and got judge her on the merits of her actions and caller-id wanted a deal when I say justice he wants to deal with every one of us hears individuals up but I see had been hiding behind Uzziah he had been leaning on Uzziah he had been depending on his ire if you sire him call I don't know how he felt if he was troubled and God stripped away everybody with me Sunday school this morning we're not getting into too much of the deep things this morning but we are coming to your home we're coming to you in your bedroom we're coming to you and nobody else is there to you being alone with God and many times things block our vision of God somehow we leave in our jobs we lean on the comfort of our home we we lean on a leader we lean on somebody we know God we love God we trust God but we are not really depending upon him many times God has to remove our props allow us to become ill allow us to lose a job allow the leader to die a locust to happen to see how we're gonna do it and I see it did what was the best thing to do is found himself in the temple and in the temple something happened he said I saw the Lord can the church same era and the Lourdes was sitting on the throne hallelujah this was not any throne this is this room this is the throne above every other throne this is this is not justice room but God was on the throne and once he's on the throne he's judge once he's on the throne he's the king of kings he is the presiding judge on the turn and Isaiah stood there everybody with me this morning we make decisions and our decisions our judgments when a judge makes a decision it's called a judgement your choices your decisions with what you do when the day comes and who your friends are these are your judgments based on the information that's presented to you you make a decision this is going to be my friend and that's a judgment but as I say a stood there in front the Lord and he saw the Lord sitting on the throne and the throne was not empty God is on the throne he's in control in the presence of the Lord Isiah started to feel uncomfortable as the I started to feel naked as yes I didn't feel what he didn't realize all along and he screamed that woe is me in other words I'm in trouble before he sort of no he didn't realize that he was in trouble woe is me I am undone it was only in the presence of the Lord that he realized that he was undone many people come to church and they don't realize that they are undone that word undone means unfinished unwarned incomplete is like your shoelace is untied he thought everything was okay going through the routine in the absence of King Uzziah but in the presence of the Lord and here was the Bible said he he Caesar to seraphim's two wings over their faces in reverence two wings over their feet in humility and two wings they are flying the eye in action and that's attributes of true worship and they are saying holy holy holy is the Lord holy holy holy is the Lord and the prophets said these angels didn't know what sin was but yet they covered their faces in reference these are the syllables but yet they covered their feet with wings phenazine desire action many of us we have action without reference action without humility we come to church how we want to we speak to one another how we want to not realize that I when we come into the house of God we are coming into the presence of God he was in the same temple not a different temple it was the same temple but then he saw something and he hadn't seen before may God uncover your eyes this morning to see what you have not seen before to seek God upon his throne to see what's happening around us to see the signs of the time to see that no matter what you are going to right now there's still something that you need to do to be complete Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Isiah was alone above the Thrones to the seraphim's each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and by the Branum said in a message list but when he got there in the temple that day and he seeing those cherubims waving these wings back and forth and realize that these angels ministered in the face of god and them angels didn't even know what sin was of understand in the presence of God they had to cover their holy faces hallelujah to stand in the presence of God hallelujah how did you come to the house of God this morning are your faces covered in the presence of God this morning did you come with reverence in the house of God this morning did you come knowing that he is here this morning to heal to deliver to break the chains to break the curse of sin did you come with cover did you come this morning in total reverence because you realize that he is God and this is not just a church service but there is an approach to God and he is sitting on his throne this morning his truth is above the prime minister his truely's above the presidenta his truth is above your duck top his truth is above your natural father his truth is above the pastor his truth is above the country he is the king of kings he's the Lord of lords huh he is good all by himself and he's still sitting on the trona he's moving things around it's morning to bring deliverance to set the captives free this morning hallelujah hallelujah and one cried unto another verse three and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory the whole earth is full of his glory this morn and he is holy this mornin your condition doesn't change the fact that he is wholly in Sam's 99 the Lord reigneth let the people trim up he set it between the cherubims let it be moved up the Lord is great in Zion and he is high above all the people let them praise thy great and terrible name for it is holy the Kings strength of also loving judgment of dough does establish equity don't execute his judgment and righteousness in Jacob this is the king we are talking about this morning exalts he the Lord our God and worship his footstool for he is holy it is impossible for you to get anything from God what a revelation that he is holy hallelujah and in his holiness it makes us weaker in his holiness it shows who we really are in his holiness we lean naked before Korah you cannot hide in his holiness you cannot deceive in his holiness you can't display Church in his holiness he is here this morning and he is on his throne hallelujah and one cried another said holy holy is the Lord of hosts and he whole earth is full of his glory Church ft angels who don't know what sin is which spend all of their time seeing holy holy holy holy is the Lord holy holy holy holy is the Lord and they don't know what sinners didn't make a mistake yesterday but they'll live their life saying holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty they didn't lie last week but this time they are saying holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty they didn't have an argument with their spouse this morning but they are saying holy holy holy is the Lord God on my team how can you come into the presence of God and not be reverent and not be saying holy holy holy is the Lord Almighty I know trouble but that doesn't change the fact not holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty I know you are tired but that doesn't change the fact of not holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty you should be walking every day holy holy holy is the Lord Almighty holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty there's none like him there's none like him in all the earth holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty holy holy holy is the Lord God on my team it's reverence its worship it's acknowledging God and that creates an atmosphere it's not trying to work the people up it's a revelation that he is holy and if angels who didn't make mistakes of sing praises unto him what about us who were created the worship and with a different gratefulness up we could see worship that the Angels cannot even say he is holy he is holy he is holy he is holy because he is holy that's why you dress reverently to come into the house of God because he is holy it's why you speak a certain way when you come around the tabernacle because he is holy and you realize that he sits on his throne it's why you even in your house you operate a certain way it's because he is holy because he is holy it's why the Prophet was serious clothes you're not supposed even where in your house you figure that out up but he was speaking about the consciousness of the holiness of God the consciousness about the throne of God the holiness of God His Holiness has nothing to do with your condition His Holiness has nothing to do with your mistakes His Holiness has nothing to do with how long in the message or how long in church he is just holy he is just holy so you have no excuse this morning to not worship what is your excuse to not worship this morning what is your excuse what stress you have that you cannot see holy is the Lord what problem you have that you cannot worship and give God praise this morning you have no excuse this morning you have no excuse I'm not talking about you this morning I'm talking about him because that's what Isaiah saw when he when he saw the Lord and he saw the angels and he sort of seraphim sup he was so moved when he sort of building beginners shake the Bible said the pulse of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke the incense of worship the house was filled up it was milky white because praise was an attack it was milky white you may be seated it's a sunday-school message the smoke and the worship and the praise didn't mean that sin was not there because the smoke and the worship and the praise uncovered uncovered the cynic was there because it was a smoke and the moving of the Pope's and the angels that were swear was where were flying around and the Lord being present at that that was Isaiah to stop looking around him the atmosphere had changed so much that Isaiah stop looking at the throne he stopped looking at the angels he had forgotten about King Uzziah and all of a sudden he started to look at himself he was so overwhelmed with what he felt he was so overwhelmed with what he saw he was so overwhelmed he was so overwhelmed look around him and he looked at himself and when he looked at himself in that presence when he looked at himself in that anointing when he looked at himself in the presence of the King on the throne in the throne room and the seraphim's and he angels around and he said woe is me I didn't realize I was in trouble I thought I was okey I thought I'm in the message for time I worship I thought I'm a believer woe is me I'm in trouble I didn't realize that I mean here in the temple he wasn't in a bar he wasn't on the street he wasn't with a prostitute he was in the temple and the temple uncovered the sin and the shame the temple uncovered the filth that was in his mouth the temple [Applause] the random said one year we have a church where sim cannot stay in the church because the King on his throne will uncover will expose will lift up what's going on in your life lift up your situation you see in that presence I see I couldn't blame anybody people still talk about well it have hypocrites and this one do this and this one do that and I don't know how he live it and he Deacon did this and he did that and the Minnesota dish and this person see this but in the presence of God it was not about anybody else I say looked at Jess himself not his child his wife his cousin his brother his neighbor nothing is here Lord boys me I didn't realize it I didn't think I was in this much trouble I thought I was all right I'm a spiritual man this is a prophet a major prophet who found that there was silliness members a prophet who found it and he was in trouble and didn't realize it it was not that he didn't know the word I didn't know the Lord didn't know the Scriptures he has what's called for this purpose he was born with his purpose cannot judge him then said I what is me for I am undone he came to acknowledge his problem God didn't say this is your problem it wasn't the pastor saying this you know what your problem is here this morning you don't need a pastor to tell you what your problem is the world opens up what your problem is he said I am undone and he came to his problem he said because I am a man of unclean lips he identified what was his problem can you identify your problem in the presence of God what you need help with what you want change in your life can you identify your struggle that you know has been there but this morning the presence of God is lifting off the covers so bring you directly to confront who you are when everybody else because nobody had a reason the point that Isaiah the question his life is integrity this was you science prophet this was an anointed man of God but in the presence of God there's a conversation taking place that nobody else is around for and my desire this morning for me as an individual it's Lord show me show me where I am undone this morning show me what I lack this morning show me what I need this morning I didn't realize that I was this empty I didn't realize that I was just needy I didn't even know what I need but in your presence I'm a man of unclean lips I'm I'm a man struggling with whatever it is this morning oh god oh god oh god and Isaiah the prophet said the Prophet said he's tatted to confess what was his problem he started to confess what was his need he started to admit what he was doing he started to confess where he had gone wrong he said I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips so he was not just cereal pray for me he was Nessie remember me in prayer this was this was not that he had come to confront the reality say I am a man of unclean lips I'm not afraid to admit it I'm not afraid to confess it because I can't get help if I keep it hidden any longer but a Branham spends a lot of time preaching about unconfessed sin but when you confess the devil cannot hold it on you anymore woe is me so I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips and any please do this in the context for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts so when people are hiding what's going on in their lives it's because they have yet to see the king the Lord of hosts because once you see the king the Lord of hosts it means you have stopped looking at man there are no more use iers in your life and all I'd left to see that could help you along your journey to the rapture is to see the king because only in the presence of the king can you get the help that you need so my simple objective this morning is to point you to the king and to remind you that he is here and to remind you that he is on his throne and to remind you to check yourself because I'm trying to check myself this morning I can't check you too oh let me say that one more time I'm not here this morning to tell you what you're doing wrong I'm trying to solve my problem this morning just like Isaiah I'm trying to come to terms in the presence of God what I need to do [Music] I'm losing my I'm losing my voice a little bit because the devil doesn't like to get exposed whether Branham said switch on the light and all the insects ants of course scampering we are here a small to switch on the light in your life because he is the light in the true room it's like they're smokers in census worship there's praises and frames don't be afraid of it don't be afraid of it it's like telling a child take the bitter medicine it might burn now but you're gonna get better if you don't take if you're gonna stay in trouble if you don't take it you're gonna steal in pain but if you take the treatment this morning from the master surgeon who's on the throne from the doctor on the throne this morning you'll be all right can we take a little more war is me I'm in trouble if a prophet could be in trouble don't you think preachers get in trouble if a prophet get in trouble don't you think ministers get in trouble if a prophet you get in trouble don't you think Ellis and get in trouble if a prophet I get in trouble do you think deacons I get in trouble evening a prophet to get in trouble you think I should get in trouble there are young people who look at their parents and they know that something is not right and instead of praying that God help them they disrespect them not knowing that their parent needs an experience just as the young person needs an spirits with God the attitude changes when you get the picture that every single person in this room is not here to show but here to get an encounter with God I'm the first to say I'm undone can you admit it when the Prophet spoke about he said I'm undone woe is me this strips the self-righteous skirt to the floor feeling like nobody knows the trouble you see in and deep down inside you being eaten up because you have been leaning on other stuff and God is systematically breaking all the stuff around you until you have nothing a lead on until nobody else when you look around you there's nobody there left alone I'm undone I am unfinished I am incomplete I am NOT okey all scriptures have to be taken in its correct context when Moses was about to open up the Red Sea stand still and see the salvation of the Lord that was appropriate then when Potiphar's wife was coming to Joseph Jews his stand still and see the salvation of the Lord but as you see by quoting scripture isn't that what wrong Scripture there's a time to say let the weak say I am strong that has his context but is it trying to say Lord who is me I'm undone I need help America I'm here this morning because I need deliverance I'm not trying to impress anybody I'm not trying to people to think I'm I'm because I'm shooting I'm shooting that everything is all right Lord woe is me because I'm in your presence this morning and I cannot afford to go home the same way that I came [Applause] [Music] said it's a sunday-school class this morning very simple I wanna make sure that's Neal this down so you get it a picture of that scenario that scene a vision of what took place not just to see it externally but to put yourself in that same place I say I was a religious man spiritual man living in a religious nation spiritual nation God's nation God's people there had been no switched from the Jewish dispensation to the Gentile dispensation to that time they were still thoughts people he had responsibility with the holy things of God yet until that moment he had never fully seen the holiness of God he had been operating in his ministry and had never seen the Lord miss it one more time Isaiah had been operated in his ministry and had never seen the Lord have you seen the Lord have you had that experience with God that growls you and becomes your anchor that you could say like the old ones do but my uncle holes despite the storm because the storms will come suddenly in the presence of the Lord he understood that all of our human righteousness is as filthy rags he understood it has nothing that we can do of our own accord there's no sacrifice that we can make no good thing we could produce nothing I will ever give us the right to even stand in the presence of God he didn't even activate the presence of God God chose to show himself to Isaiah like he has come to show himself to you this morning [Music] I'm not gonna be too much longer minister your heart this morning and for those who really catch it they will hold on to the horns of the altar and say Lord who is me I man grunting the prophet and a messenger anointed ones at the end time he is praying cleanse our heart Lord is this your prayer cleanse our heart from all filth of the world Lord I stand ready for cleansing this is the prophet I stand ready for Clemson I stand ready with this church out of it all the listening in and whoever will listen to this tip I stand Lord and Acts for cleansing Lord take me to the potter's house and break me up mould me a servant this

walk the earth in st. glens all have Lord from all fields of this world I want you to listen to the prayer because similarly yes I said what took place at Isaiah it takes God to do the cleansing you cannot cleanse yourself that's your mistake you cannot cleanse yourself you need to come and lay at the altar for God to perform the surgery and you have to surrender all the problems we come and we put things at the altar and then we pick it back up and go back home with it take the coals cleanse my lips yeah that's why I asked but aunty we just sing that song because this is where this song comes from this is where this song comes from take me past the outer court through the holy place into the Holy of Holies it's a Holy Ghost itself is the lord of this drawn mighty and tower it does share of hymns in their place and in that place I realize that I'm empty I'm wanting I'm nothing and I pray that the angel will take the coals with the tongs and place it upon my lips i Stern Lord I'm still reading a prayer from the Prophet and asked for cleansing law take me to the potter's house and break me up mould me a Sylvan that you would want for Lord Jesus I'm a man of unclean lips as Isaiah cried dwelling with people of unclean lips and war as me for I see the revelation now he's placing it in context for us in the message for I see the revelation of God being made manifest as Isaiah saw the angel in the temple I see the endtime Lord and war is me and my family woe is me and my people or eternal God have mercy upon us I plead for myself and the people let us not perish with those who believe not but may we live with the believers is this your prayer this morning hallelujah hallelujah the musician get rid get ready I'm not gonna be too much longer then flew one of the seraphim's unto me having a light cold in his hand which he had taken from the tongues with the tongue some of the altar and he leaned it upon my mouth and said lo this has touched her lips and an iniquity is taken we and I sin perched in other words beyond Isiah recognising his own uncleanness and that of the people Isiah actually saw the willingness of God to forgive anyone who would turn back to him anyone who would confess to him or God was looking for from Isiah was a confession a confession of the desire to be changed a confession of what you know to be wrong a confession of your need Isiah enough to plead for it he didn't have to beg for it mercy came and touched him and he became aware that it was the delight of God to forgive and to cleanse in a message God's power to transform but around said Isaiah lips he was just an ordinary man of unclean lips he said Lord I'm among unclean people and I got unclean lips boys me because I've seen the Lord and an angel came down cut the fire wooley fire off of God's altar and transform his lips from the lips of a wandering man to the lips of a prophet with thus saith the Lord courts transforming power hallelujah thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord in a message influenced better bound said then what you could mean to pay something softly when he confess his sins then come the cleansing or you cannot become you cannot be clean from your sin until you confess it's sin till you recognize it sin then come the cleansing as soon as he said woe is me for my eyes have seen the vindication of a great God the Angels the burners the sacrifices I hear and the posts is moving at their voice and here they are in this vision flying back and forth he had saw something real a vision or come down he said I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell among unclean people said he cried out for mercy and himself a sinner then what happened one of the cherubims went over to the old tongue and took the tongue he could be in a play take me into the Holy of Holies one more time and took the tongues and pick up a live coal and picked it on his hand not carried in a tongue now picked up the coal put it in his hand and come and laid it upon the prophet's lips and said that anything could you what is iniquity but the Branham said iniquity is something that you know it's wrong and still holding on to it we know your creature on all your behavior is wrong and still hold on to it he said that's iniquity but when he confessed that he was wrong there was a cleansing power he took a call of fire we see how God sets his servants in order and what he fixed him with her weaker being humble reverent and put his self in action watch when he cleanse a silver he never done it by a seminary he never done it by a bunch of books we find here that God cleanse his servants by fire a call of fire touch the Prophet cleanse his lips court cleans his servants by holy fire not by books not by education geology but he cleanse his servants by fire and this morning we own expectation for fire fire to move to the tabernacle fire to move through your life fire to move through your heart may the
