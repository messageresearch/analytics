[50:56] quickness
[50:57] whom he will
[51:00] and in john 6 63
[51:03] jesus speaks
[51:04] it is the spirit that quickness
[51:07] the flesh profited nothing
[51:10] the words that i speak unto you
[51:12] they are spirit
[51:13] and they are life
[51:15] final scripture reading from ephesians
[51:17] 2 verse 1 and 2.
[51:20] and you had he quickened
[51:23] who were dead in sin and
[51:25] dead in trespasses and sins
[51:27] wherein in time past he walk according
[51:29] to the course of this world
[51:31] according to the prince of the power of
[51:33] the ear the spirit that now work it in
[51:36] the children of disobedience may god
[51:39] bless his word you may be seated
[51:42] this morning i have a title
[51:45] it is a spirit that quickness
[51:48] i have a subject the quickness power
[51:53] let's go
[51:56] the word is dead
[51:58] until it is quickened
[52:01] by the spirit
[52:04] the word is dead until it's quickened by
[52:05] the spirit
[52:07] so watch now
[52:08] god always stands behind his word isn't
[52:10] that right
[52:11] so watch on on once it has to be
[52:13] revealed it's revealed to prophets we
[52:16] realize that all the mysteries of god
[52:19] is mean known to prophets
[52:22] and them alone
[52:24] let me repeat it again
[52:25] all the mysteries of god
[52:28] is made known to prophets
[52:31] and them alone
[52:33] sub fifo ministry and ministers and
[52:36] pastors have to draw from what god speak
[52:38] out of the mouth of prophets
[52:41] amos 3 7 says surely lord god will do
[52:43] nothing but reveal the secrets until
[52:46] servants the prophets
[52:48] now
[52:49] the power of revelation brings
[52:51] stimulation to the believer
[52:53] for the power of wine or natural wine is
[52:56] to stimulate
[52:57] so wine symbolizes revelation
[53:00] it have water has to turn into wine and
[53:03] wine brings stimulation and that is what
[53:05] revelation does
[53:07] a person that is slumped on watch when
[53:10] the power of revelation of the word
[53:11] gives stimulation of joy to the believer
[53:15] so when you see a dong and you're low
[53:17] and you're struggling you need a
[53:18] revelation when god speaks to you reveal
[53:21] himself to you and it brings joy
[53:23] to you as a believer
[53:25] that is something god has reserved for
[53:27] you
[53:28] divine revelation which comes as wine
[53:32] that brings stimulation and it brings
[53:34] joy to the believers so i don't care
[53:36] what condition you in and god break a
[53:38] revelation upon you all of a sudden you
[53:40] get excited you get stimulated please go
[53:43] this morning i'm not tired i just need a
[53:45] quick name and once that quick thing
[53:47] come all the tiredness go
[53:49] because the quickness power has now come
[53:51] upon you
[53:52] oh praise god you could be drunk and
[53:53] weary and drag yourself inside of here
[53:56] but once an anointing praise god that
[53:58] makes the difference what's that
[54:00] anointing praise god you can't live
[54:02] without it once that come upon you every
[54:04] day all the blues gone
[54:05] all the wearing is gone
[54:07] all the troubles go on because you're
[54:09] under the anointing the devil can't take
[54:12] that from you now that is belong to the
[54:14] sons and daughters of god oh glory to
[54:16] god jesus and the spirit is upon me for
[54:19] he hath anointed me
[54:20] jesus himself had to be anointed he was
[54:22] the son of god he was the word made
[54:24] flesh but the anointing had to come upon
[54:27] him and the anointing have come upon you
[54:30] just as they come upon christ it has to
[54:31] come upon you
[54:33] not by might no by power his spirit
[54:36] oh glory to god i want to tell you this
[54:38] morning is the spirit of quickness the
[54:40] flesh prophet that nothing all glory so

[1:04:14] let's continue now
[1:04:16] i'll skip this here watch
[1:04:19] remember when the sixth chapter is what
[1:04:21] we read you see it is a spirit of
[1:04:23] quickness the flesh profited nothing the
[1:04:26] words that i speak unto you their
[1:04:27] spirits and their life
[1:04:28] the word
[1:04:30] itself is spirit
[1:04:34] it is spirit in word form
[1:04:38] that's why the word could turn the
[1:04:39] spirit
[1:04:40] that's why the foolish version cannot
[1:04:42] get the oil because they didn't have the
[1:04:44] word to turn into spirit
[1:04:46] oh give the lord a shout
[1:04:48] hallelujah praise god you have to have
[1:04:50] the word in you what's the secret
[1:04:53] the word is in the bride how did the
[1:04:55] word get in the bride
[1:04:56] we pumping it every sunday every
[1:04:58] wednesday every tape you hear
[1:05:01] every permission read every time you say
[1:05:03] amen every time you claim it
[1:05:05] that word coming into you
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:10] [Applause]
[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:21] a thought has to be a thought before it
[1:05:24] can be a word
[1:05:25] or when a thought is presented or the
[1:05:27] word is an expression of a thought
[1:05:29] this is god's thought that he has placed
[1:05:31] in the word and when we receive it from
[1:05:33] him it becomes a word
[1:05:35] so revelation is god taught drop to you
[1:05:37] and bypass your mind drop into your
[1:05:38] heart
[1:05:39] because isaiah had caught god's thoughts
[1:05:42] and it's flick up in his mind avoiding
[1:05:44] shall conceive he was in the pause
[1:05:47] and say but
[1:05:48] that can happen
[1:05:51] you see how god in a bypass reasoning
[1:05:54] you say oh simeon an old man who's
[1:05:55] supposed to be in rock and chair the
[1:05:56] gift to give him for his retirement and
[1:05:58] you're not staying home he's still going
[1:05:59] to church because god revealed to him
[1:06:01] that he could see the lord christ i know
[1:06:03] christ coming inside this house christ
[1:06:04] is coming to be offered up in the temple
[1:06:07] so he's making sure he is dear because
[1:06:08] you have to witness this thing because
[1:06:10] god revealed him it's a revelation the
[1:06:13] old man dragging himself every sunday
[1:06:15] morning because god revealed to him he
[1:06:17] shall not see that that coming you know
[1:06:19] but he shall not sit until
[1:06:21] until
[1:06:23] uncertain they have to be full until
[1:06:25] there is a lie god has finished with you
[1:06:27] yet god has finished with me yet that
[1:06:29] angel has to take his time and take a
[1:06:31] stroll and go for our next wrongs or

[1:07:25] know how i could get this here this is a
[1:07:27] spirit of correctness it's turned into
[1:07:28] my soul preach that pray is the spirit
[1:07:30] of preaching it i get preached spirit
[1:07:33] spirits have to breathe spirit it's the
[1:07:35] spirit that quickness i care quickly so
[1:07:37] we run after a man for this man can
[1:07:39] quickly run him back to this man rather
[1:07:55] we find out this stimulates give joy
[1:07:56] because it's god's word and a new wine
[1:07:59] stimulates when it reveals the word it
[1:08:01] brings joy beyond measure
[1:08:04] sometimes we went through that it brings
[1:08:06] us joy till you're over flooded you
[1:08:08] receive people don't know what they what
[1:08:09] what they talk they don't know what to
[1:08:11] say is joy
[1:08:13] hallelujah i know there's a lot of
[1:08:16] fanaticism people carrying on i know
[1:08:17] sometimes they they do that when the
[1:08:19] music is jumping up and down everything
[1:08:20] else i've seen people in a day as long
[1:08:22] as the music is playing everybody's
[1:08:24] jumping screaming when will they stop it
[1:08:25] stop that's all right you said no watch
[1:08:28] i'm concerned about the people's lives
[1:08:30] right
[1:08:30] but now
[1:08:32] what you once you start bringing the
[1:08:34] word now the thing that is actually
[1:08:37] brings life is the word
[1:08:39] not philosophy not from time magazine
[1:08:42] not from ukraine and putin and the pope
[1:08:45] and rome that is not they're not they're
[1:08:48] not bringing life
[1:08:50] well i talked to our friend and the
[1:08:51] friend was telling me that i've seen it
[1:08:53] i've seen something so i'll go by your
[1:08:55] friend and see it so
[1:08:58] more friends the devil have to show his
[1:08:59] show and so on so and so
[1:09:01] and then how do you process it so
[1:09:03] i'm a friend i met so you know
[1:09:06] you will you you'll get plenty of
[1:09:08] resources
[1:09:09] but if you want life
[1:09:11] only the word giving you that
[1:09:14] come to the word
[1:09:15] now watch jesus told them luke 24 49
[1:09:18] behold i send the promise of my father
[1:09:20] upon you and you go to jerusalem and
[1:09:22] wait until what was the promise of the
[1:09:24] father jewel 2 28
[1:09:27] i'll pour out the spirit isaiah 20 19
[1:09:31] there'll be stamina rips and other
[1:09:32] tongues they went up there as we went
[1:09:34] through this well i believe i've waited
[1:09:36] long enough let's just accept it by
[1:09:38] faith that was a good baptist doctrine
[1:09:40] but it didn't work with them brothers
[1:09:42] the first thing you know it has become
[1:09:44] it had to become a reality because
[1:09:48] people find they're waiting too long for
[1:09:49] this promise
[1:09:50] god i waited to go for the holy ghost i
[1:09:52] wasn't alone for this i waited too long
[1:09:54] for that but what it had to become a
[1:09:55] reality and they waited on their
[1:09:58] ministry here we go for the word to be
[1:10:02] vindicated
[1:10:03] and when you come to seek the holy
[1:10:05] spirit you do the same
[1:10:07] you have to wait
[1:10:09] you have to wait until god do something
[1:10:11] for you you can lock god neck
[1:10:14] god promise it god can't lie
[1:10:16] you could tell god you promised me the
[1:10:18] holy ghost
[1:10:19] and i want it
[1:10:21] oh hallelujah praise god you want what
[1:10:24] you promised
[1:10:25] oh glory to god amen
[1:10:28] all right now watch
[1:10:29] he said no what he said yes you can
[1:10:31] accept by faith you have to accept
[1:10:32] christ by faith that's exactly right but
[1:10:34] you accept the holy spirit by faith but
[1:10:36] then the holy spirit come and give the
[1:10:38] circumcision as a witness that you
[1:10:41] accepted your faith so the same thing we
[1:10:44] must do we must wait on the holy spirit
[1:10:48] till it's done something
[1:10:50] not necessary because we spoke in
[1:10:52] tongues not because we danced or we got
[1:10:54] emotional or we shouted until we are
[1:10:57] changed
[1:10:58] that's a key component that changed
[1:11:00] until something actually happened i
[1:11:02] don't care what form it comes in just so
[1:11:05] it happened that's the main thing
[1:11:08] okay let's continue now watch the
[1:11:09] written word brings forth of its kind
[1:11:11] you know you receive it in your heart
[1:11:13] and believe it you must read a word and
[1:11:15] be such a scholar till you know all the
[1:11:17] ins and outs of the word that will never
[1:11:20] do you no good until it first becomes
[1:11:22] quickened to you
[1:11:25] so like if you're praying
[1:11:26] or you're washing your wares or you're
[1:11:28] doing something you're sweeping the
[1:11:29] floor and something in your heart say go
[1:11:31] and pray now that's it that's the time
[1:11:33] to go and pray
[1:11:35] it's better you pray under the
[1:11:36] inspiration guided to pray for five
[1:11:38] minutes that you go and they say praying
[1:11:41] i pray oh
[1:11:43] are you laboring and you you're going
[1:11:44] through you're going through
[1:11:48] because sometimes god would whisper pray
[1:11:49] now
[1:11:50] sometimes somebody have a need somebody
[1:11:52] in trouble and god bring somebody to
[1:11:54] your heart and mind and pray for them
[1:11:57] and you begin to pray afterwards you
[1:11:58] hear this was happening and that was
[1:12:00] happening but there's a law deed upon
[1:12:01] your heart to pray for that individual
[1:12:03] you can't be praying for yourself all
[1:12:05] the time you know you have to pray for
[1:12:06] saints you have to pray for souls you
[1:12:08] have to pray for lies people in hell
[1:12:10] people people in church and in hell
[1:12:12] people in church are not happy they are
[1:12:14] christians who are not happy that's a
[1:12:16] sad thing
[1:12:17] that's a sad thing
[1:12:19] praise god i have no joy that's
[1:12:21] accepting
[1:12:22] praise god i say if i die i don't want
[1:12:24] the happiest man praise god i'm blessed
[1:12:27] i feel privileged i feel honor i feel i
[1:12:29] live a full life
[1:12:30] praise god that's how i feel i don't
[1:12:32] know how you feel i feel good about god
[1:12:35] i feel good about his grace about
[1:12:37] feeling good about his call i feel good
[1:12:39] at how he helped me all through these
[1:12:41] years he don't have to do one more thing
[1:12:43] for me to trust him or believe him i
[1:12:45] don't ever see a miracle i don't have to
[1:12:47] see a sign i love him still oh glory to
[1:12:50] god if you don't answer my prayer still
[1:12:51] love him i will still serve him or give
[1:12:54] the lord some praises
[1:12:55] glory to god yeah you ever see me coming
[1:12:57] with a long face
[1:12:59] praise god hallelujah pray maybe i smile
[1:13:01] too much oh glory to god but christians
[1:13:04] got not happy
[1:13:12] because they have they connect their
[1:13:13] life with external things
[1:13:16] and when those external things are not
[1:13:17] there or fulfilled then you know the
[1:13:20] happiness is not there but when you get
[1:13:22] happiness on the inside
[1:13:24] where whether you live under a tent or
[1:13:26] under a big size umbrella you still have
[1:13:28] the joy
[1:13:29] okay what i said when they live under a
[1:13:32] tent or oversized umbrella you still
[1:13:34] have the joy of the lord which is the
[1:13:35] strength you can still praise him anyhow
[1:13:38] oh glory to god we have to come free you
[1:13:41] know

[1:14:21] think and he thinks no he going
[1:14:23] and that means nothing
[1:14:24] because he on his way out
[1:14:27] praise the flesh

[1:14:31] nothing
[1:14:32] oh my
[1:14:33] so watch it will do you no good until it
[1:14:36] first become quickened to you and if you
[1:14:38] only know one word and it's quickened
[1:14:41] that's all you need
[1:14:43] did you get that
[1:14:45] you don't need all your words you know
[1:14:46] just one word

[1:16:26] be overdriving sleeping but paul reject

[1:16:53] my god my god
[1:16:54] let's continue
[1:16:57] today
[1:16:58] with great intellectual messages
[1:17:01] we can explain it till we can see the
[1:17:02] picture
[1:17:04] but that isn't what we are looking for
[1:17:05] tonight
[1:17:07] we are not
[1:17:08] looking for the mechanics
[1:17:10] we are not looking to have him explained
[1:17:13] we are looking for the dynamics of it do
[1:17:16] you understand what this church is
[1:17:18] looking for
[1:17:19] i'm not talking about no other church no
[1:17:20] other group what this church is looking
[1:17:22] for is the dynamics
[1:17:23] of it
[1:17:25] that's it we have got the mechanics of
[1:17:26] religions the bible so bottle eyes take
[1:17:29] like a great 16 35 coach train sitting
[1:17:32] on a track but if you haven't got the
[1:17:34] steam in it it takes a dynamic to
[1:17:36] perform with the mechanics what we need
[1:17:38] now is to see that what we have been
[1:17:40] taught listen to this and this is what
[1:17:42] i've been fighting for all these years
[1:17:44] and brother branham frame it in the
[1:17:46] words that only he could bring it out he
[1:17:48] said watch
[1:17:50] what we have been taught
[1:17:52] all these years is it the truth or is it
[1:17:55] not
[1:17:55] it's been explained over and over and
[1:17:59] over
[1:18:00] through the different seminaries and
[1:18:02] churches and so forth until we are
[1:18:04] looking to see who this person is
[1:18:07] until that church becomes both dynamics
[1:18:10] and mechanics and the spirit of god and
[1:18:12] move him do the things that he did
[1:18:15] if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the
[1:18:17] bride
[1:18:18] for he said in single 1412 he that
[1:18:20] believeth on me the works that i do
[1:18:22] shall we do also i'll give him a charge
[1:18:25] of my dynamics in his mechanics that the
[1:18:29] world will not be able to withstand it
[1:18:31] i'll raise him up in the last day praise
[1:18:34] god the dynamics and mechanics together
[1:18:36] the mechanics with our dynamics no good
[1:18:39] so all the mysteries and word word word
[1:18:40] with no dynamics no good the dynamics
[1:18:43] without mechanics no good because like
[1:18:45] you are a bacterial sparking so packs
[1:18:47] packs all these pasta
[1:18:49] where's the car
[1:18:51] you can't drive
[1:18:53] you have power you have all the battery
[1:18:55] look at that
[1:18:57] and you're sure enough the power on the
[1:18:58] battery but we're going to move over
[1:19:00] there
[1:19:00] you need the car
[1:19:02] the mechanics you need to put the
[1:19:04] battery inside of there both have to
[1:19:06] work together do you get it now
[1:19:09] now we see that enoch come
[1:19:11] under god's provided way with his word
[1:19:13] we find that the mechanics were so
[1:19:15] perfect
[1:19:15] in him
[1:19:16] that when his dynamics got to working in
[1:19:18] the angel it just took him off the earth
[1:19:21] first airplane flight to heaven
[1:19:24] praise be to jesus paul ii corinthians 3
[1:19:28] do we begin to commend ourselves or need
[1:19:30] we have some others epistle of
[1:19:32] commendation to you or letters a
[1:19:34] combination from you you are our epistle
[1:19:36] written in our hearts known and read of
[1:19:38] all men for as much as you are
[1:19:41] manifestly declared to be the epistle of
[1:19:43] christ ministered by us in other words
[1:19:45] you are physical letter
[1:19:47] the word root on you
[1:19:49] you are written epistles you are the
[1:19:50] expression of what i'm preaching and
[1:19:52] what i'm teaching this is the policy you
[1:19:54] know written not with ink but with the
[1:19:56] spirit of the living god not in tables
[1:19:58] of stone but in fleshly tables of the
[1:20:01] heart and such trust have we through
[1:20:03] christ to god word not that we are
[1:20:05] sufficient of ourselves to think
[1:20:07] anything of ourselves but our
[1:20:08] sufficiencies of god who
[1:20:11] have made us able ministers of the new
[1:20:14] testament
[1:20:16] then he qualifies that not of the letter
[1:20:20] but of the spirit
[1:20:22] for the letter killet
[1:20:24] but the spirit
[1:20:25] give it life
[1:20:27] it is the spirit that quickness
[1:20:29] it was the same in the old testament
[1:20:30] paul being well trained knew the
[1:20:32] scriptures by the word you see the
[1:20:34] scriptures here we go no matter how well
[1:20:36] you know them
[1:20:39] let's slow down right there
[1:20:41] no matter how well you know them
[1:20:44] if the spirit doesn't quicken them
[1:20:47] then the letter kill it
[1:20:50] people dying because of letter
[1:20:52] writing church
[1:20:53] if there's no spirit equipment
[1:20:56] so you need to understand what you have
[1:20:58] to connect with
[1:20:59] you have to connect with the quickening
[1:21:01] power
[1:21:02] that quickens the world to you
[1:21:04] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:21:06] praise god you see all these churches in
[1:21:09] america george osteen are called caller

[1:21:15] motivational stuff right and you know
[1:21:17] which thousands of people he asks one
[1:21:18] service twenty thousand people
[1:21:20] because they connect to what he is
[1:21:21] saying they don't want to hear about
[1:21:23] repentance and that they want to hear
[1:21:25] those things to make them live better
[1:21:27] live they look like they're not they're

[1:21:40] we understand
[1:21:41] that this is the climax
[1:21:43] and we are the end of time
[1:21:46] we understand maracai 4 behold i said
[1:21:49] elijah before when
[1:21:51] the great and terrible day of the lord

[1:22:00] they had the dynamics
[1:22:01] [Applause]

[1:32:27] here comes somebody knocking peter
[1:32:29] man long they're calling for you
[1:32:31] peter going down there i could imagine
[1:32:32] peter never experienced that before this
[1:32:35] bunch of people convinced of a bunch of
[1:32:37] people he was just he was devout he was
[1:32:40] an arms giving man god know they say a
[1:32:43] memorial was in heaven for the way the
[1:32:45] man used to give the man wasn't baptized
[1:32:47] he managed no scripture yet the man just
[1:32:50] a nice man a sanctified man a man
[1:32:53] whoever right can have a heart
[1:32:55] praise god and when peters have to talk
[1:32:57] and give testimony about jesus only
[1:32:59] crucify him praise god and everything
[1:33:01] else why peter yet spit this word holy
[1:33:04] spirit the quickness the holy ghost the
[1:33:06] dynamics the power the anointing that
[1:33:08] breaks the yoke the fetter that fell
[1:33:10] upon them that heard the word and they
[1:33:12] were filled with the holy ghost before
[1:33:14] they were even baptized in water or give
[1:33:16] the lord some praises that means when
[1:33:18] your heart right when you're half right
[1:33:20] when your heart right when your heart
[1:33:22] right god could do something special for
[1:33:23] you by his spirit he said not by might
[1:33:26] know my power but by my spirits hear the
[1:33:29] lord god want to do something special
[1:33:30] for you tonight just shake it check your
[1:33:32] mind
[1:33:33] to watch your mind trying to interpret
[1:33:35] what is happening here and i can't even
[1:33:36] interpret it
[1:33:37] [Applause]
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:49] it's never come to us through word only
[1:33:51] the word got to be quickened and made
[1:33:54] alive in the demonstration of the power
[1:33:56] of the holy ghost
[1:33:57] ephesians 2 we read that scripture you
[1:34:00] had to quickened who were dead in sin
[1:34:02] and trespasses oh glory to god oh glory
[1:34:05] to god i want you to notice here of the
[1:34:07] prophet apostle paul how he made mention
[1:34:10] you as he quickly who were once dead
[1:34:14] you have he quickened who are once dead
[1:34:16] in sin and trespasses walking after the
[1:34:18] kingdom of the world after desire of the
[1:34:20] flesh
[1:34:21] fulfilling desire of the mind
[1:34:24] what caused this change here we go
[1:34:25] that's right what caused this change for
[1:34:27] one time being dead to be quicker
[1:34:29] quicker means to be made alive there was
[1:34:31] a change from debt to life there is no
[1:34:33] other so great as to change him from
[1:34:35] debt to life a man if he will die
[1:34:38] physically and could be healed
[1:34:39] physically what would be a great thing
[1:34:42] and nothing so great as when he is

[1:38:00] time elijah they bury him
[1:38:02] bone steer and they was trying to put a
[1:38:04] dead man in that grave and that dead man
[1:38:06] hit that bone and the equipment power
[1:38:09] that was still on the bones it doesn't
[1:38:12] stop you know
[1:38:13] this thing is thick of eternity you know
[1:38:15] when they drop that dead man the man
[1:38:16] bombs back to life because the
[1:38:18] quickening power was on the light of
[1:38:20] gold
[1:38:20] said that same spirit that praised jesus
[1:38:23] christ from the dead dwelling you that's
[1:38:25] going to quicken your mortal body
[1:38:28] oh glory to god give the lord a shout in
[1:38:31] the house
[1:38:32] glory to god of that same spirit
[1:38:35] same spirit
[1:38:36] hallelujah
[1:38:38] glory to god
[1:38:40] let's go
[1:38:42] jesus identification
[1:38:45] was to manifest the word of god
[1:38:47] which he was
[1:38:49] and the church identification today
[1:38:52] is to manifest
[1:38:54] the promised word of this day
[1:38:57] by the same spirit
[1:38:59] that manifested and quickened with them
[1:39:02] the same spirit quickens the world to
[1:39:04] the believer today and manifests the
[1:39:06] same thing
[1:39:07] showing that the token is on this person
[1:39:10] oh glory to god now i can see the
[1:39:12] importance of this
[1:39:14] praise god i ain't got it yet but you're
[1:39:16] gonna find all this strickland power
[1:39:18] it's evidence of the rapture
[1:39:20] praise god resident in your body it's
[1:39:22] like you get the rapture ticket
[1:39:24] praise god
[1:39:27] you have to have it you have got to get
[1:39:30] it and i hope this make it desperate
[1:39:32] oh praise god oh look i'm talking that
[1:39:34] and the next thing we have here the
[1:39:36] earnest of the resurrection he said
[1:39:38] lucky woman claiming they got the holy
[1:39:40] ghost i going out here wearing shorts
[1:39:41] and things and could you do it how could
[1:39:44] the spirit of god in you ever do such a
[1:39:46] thing
[1:39:46] he's not a filthy spirit he's a holy
[1:39:49] spirit now listen this is deep
[1:39:51] when you become
[1:39:53] subject to that spirit
[1:39:55] it shows your whole being suffering to
[1:39:57] that spirit
[1:39:58] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:40:02] but this seed word made manifest
[1:40:05] or quicken he said hallelujah or made a
[1:40:08] life
[1:40:09] the spirit
[1:40:11] is this word
[1:40:13] made manifest
[1:40:14] in you
[1:40:16] that's why it's important to receive the
[1:40:17] word
[1:40:18] because jesus said the words that i
[1:40:20] speak their spirit
[1:40:23] and their life
[1:40:25] what is it it's the earnest and man i
[1:40:27] see this so this is so glorious it is
[1:40:30] the earnest of the resurrection
[1:40:32] this body will be raised again
[1:40:35] because it has already started
[1:40:37] it was one subject to sin mind
[1:40:40] corruption but now it's got the illness
[1:40:42] it turned heavenly
[1:40:43] so when you get the holy ghost you have
[1:40:46] the anus
[1:40:47] of the resurrection itself you have a
[1:40:49] guarantee
[1:40:50] like if you fall on the dog that's why

[1:47:57] my god
[1:47:58] hallelujah now watch
[1:48:01] the disciples right you say i have the
[1:48:03] keys jesus i have the keys of death and
[1:48:04] hell don't fear anymore for every
[1:48:06] forwarding predestination seed of god
[1:48:08] come to life when that light spread
[1:48:10] across the earth of this glorious gospel
[1:48:13] it will bring forth the crop that god
[1:48:14] ordered to do i'm alive or quicken the
[1:48:17] word means the word quicken the greek
[1:48:18] words means something that's made a life
[1:48:20] after death not only that he will send
[1:48:22] the same life that quickened me the
[1:48:25] power that brought me from the grave i
[1:48:27] will send it upon you amen this is
[1:48:29] dramatizing jesus in the same power
[1:48:31] that brought me from the grave i will
[1:48:33] send it upon you
[1:48:35] to quicken you that way i am you may be
[1:48:37] also
[1:48:38] oh praise the name of the lord we must
[1:48:41] get them to christ we're this quick and
[1:48:43] powerful i'm wondering today if what's
[1:48:46] happening
[1:48:47] are we really getting the people to god
[1:48:49] or are we just getting them to church
[1:48:51] we must
[1:48:53] get them to christ
[1:48:55] where this quickening power it's good to
[1:48:57] go to the church sure but if that's far
[1:48:59] as we go it's not fine enough
[1:49:01] when you come to church that's good but
[1:49:03] go on to christ
[1:49:05] from the church because we must receive
[1:49:07] this quickening power
[1:49:09] if we ever expect to be in that general
[1:49:11] resurrection because that's the only
[1:49:14] thing will ever bring us from the dead
[1:49:16] oh glory to god
[1:49:18] hallelujah i have to have something to
[1:49:20] bring you out
[1:49:22] jesus knew it was resident in him that's
[1:49:24] why he said destroy this body in three
[1:49:26] days i raised up myself
[1:49:28] myself
[1:49:29] because it's something inside of me the
[1:49:32] quickness power and when jesus died at
[1:49:34] calvary the devil was clean cleaning
[1:49:36] glasses and toast in and rejoicing he's
[1:49:38] dead but jesus knew his body will not
[1:49:41] see corruption
[1:49:42] and before them three days up up from
[1:49:44] the grave he arrows praise god a woman
[1:49:46] come to see him oh to bring grave clot
[1:49:50] angel roll away the stone he said tell
[1:49:52] them i'm not dead tell them i'm risen
[1:49:56] from the dead go and tell my disciples
[1:49:58] i'm peter oh glory to god i'm not dead
[1:50:02] i'm alive i'm alive i'm alive you
[1:50:06] calculate dead man he rose from the dead
[1:50:08] oh give the lord a shout and he come
[1:50:11] back upon this church upon his believers
[1:50:14] to prove he's the same yesterday today
[1:50:16] and forever and the only way he could
[1:50:18] prove it is by his works
[1:50:20] [Applause]
[1:50:22] by the same signs
[1:50:24] same wonders
[1:50:26] same miracles
[1:50:28] oh my so the holy spirit is here on
[1:50:31] earth looking out for individuals that
[1:50:33] god has ordained to life
[1:50:36] in this age and as soon as it finds it
[1:50:39] it does just like it did on jesus christ
[1:50:41] the great super son of god now that
[1:50:43] quickening power that came upon jesus
[1:50:47] quickened him to manifest every promise
[1:50:49] of the word for that day
[1:50:51] so does the holy spirit that come upon
[1:50:53] us in this day is not a mockery holy
[1:50:56] spirit so when jesus got the anointing
[1:50:59] of the holy ghost after overcoming
[1:51:01] lucifer
[1:51:02] in the wilderness he said the spirit of
[1:51:04] god is upon me for he had anointed me he
[1:51:08] was reading the scripture he found the
